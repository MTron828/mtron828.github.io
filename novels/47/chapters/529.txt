530 A Meeting Gift For Senior Sister RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

After hearing Ye Xuan address her as senior sister, Yanran also looked at Ye Xuan and said, “Hello, Senior Brother.”

Not far away, Ouyang Xiu was dumbfounded when he saw this scene.

This kind of thing was really something that he had never seen before. Could seniority be decided by words alone? Was this a custom that was unique to the Great Wilderness Divine sect?

These two people were really weirdos, and a perfect match for each other.

!!

While Ouyang Xiu was sighing to himself, Ye Xuan and Yanran turned to look at him.

At this moment, Ouyang Xiu’s heart had turned cold.

“I’m doomed this time…”

Just now, he was so engrossed in watching the two of them act out that farce that he forgot that he was in immense danger.

He definitely would not be able to resist their combined attacks.

Yanran held her sword aloft and approached Ouyang Xiu step by step, speaking in an extremely cold tone, “Old Man Ouyang, if you’re smart, you’d better take out the mammoth cauldron. Otherwise, don’t blame me for what I’m about to do.”

“Tsk! Since it’s in my possession, it belongs to me.”

The mammoth cauldron was a divine-rank magic treasure, so there was no way he was going to hand it over?

The sequence of events that led up to this point was very simple. Yanran had originally seen this mammoth cauldron in an ancient cave.

Just as Yanran was about to grab it, the heaven devouring divine sparrow flew over, forcing her to retreat.

However, by the time the danger had passed, Ouyang Xiu, who was hiding in the dark, took the opportunity to take the mammoth cauldron for himself, which enraged Yanran.

Thus, the two of them had been fighting for several days.

Ye Xuan did not say anything when he saw the two of them arguing.

From the conversation between the two of them, he already had a rough idea of what had happened.

However, what Ye Xuan really cared about was not the mammoth cauldron, but the heaven devouring divine sparrow.

It was obvious that there were entrances to the true tomb from the other continents. This much was obvious thanks to the presence of Yanran and Ouyang Xiu.

In any case, among these treasures, the only one that Ye Xuan really took a fancy to was the treasure in the coffin that he had set his eyes on at the beginning.

However, it was a pity that his cultivation level had not reached the heights it had back then as it was now, which led to him losing the chase.

If he still wanted to find the traces of that treasure at this time, it would be difficult.

At this moment, Ouyang Xiu was looking at Ye Xuan and Yanran with an ugly expression. He knew he had no hope of winning now.

Knowing this, Ouyang Xiu felt ashamed, but he still said unwillingly, “Little brother, you must consider this matter carefully. After all, becoming my enemy is not a good thing for you.”

Things had already come this far, but Ouyang Xiu still had not given up hope. Perhaps he might still be able to get Ye Xuan not to interfere.

After all, after one reached the supreme realm, most people would become more cautious when doing things.

Even if Ye Xuan helped out, there were no real benefits for him. After all, the mammoth cauldron would still end up with Yanran, and there was only one treasure.

Yanran could not help but look at Ye Xuan. After all, the two sects had been separated a long time ago, so there was no real relationship between them.

Besides, even now, she was not clear about how strong Ye Xuan was. After hearing Ouyang Xiu’s words, what choice would he make?

Would he help or just stand by?

Still, no matter what choice Ye Xuan made, Yanran would not take it to heart. After all, she had great confidence in her own strength.

She would be able to defeat Ouyang Xiu alone.

Moments later, Ye Xuan said with a smile, “Do you know what’s the most annoying thing in my life? It’s the thing you just did!”

As soon as he said this, Ye Xuan once again looked at Yanran and said with a smile, “Senior Sister, since this is our first meeting, I’ll help you get this mammoth cauldron back as a gift.”

After hearing this, Yanran was stunned.

What did Ye Xuan mean by this?

With her own ability, she could also take it back herself, okay? How could he call it a meeting gift?

“Senior Brother, there’s no need to be so polite. I’ll take it back myself.”

After hesitating for a while, she refused Ye Xuan’s offer. After all, she did not want to owe anyone anything.

Moreover, she still wanted to properly display her strength. At that time, once he was convinced, he would have to obediently call her senior sister?

However, what Yanran did not expect was that Ye Xuan’s thoughts were exactly the same as hers, and he had taken action first.

At this moment, Ye Xuan stood in front of Yanran without hesitation and said, “Senior Sister, just stay behind me. I’ll settle this for you!”

Although Yanran felt a little strange, it was the first time she was protected by someone like this, so she was not sure how to feel.

With her strength, when did she need others to protect her?

Even though this feeling was very strange, it also made her feel slightly warm.

This guy was both hateful and admirable at the same time.

Seeing her reaction, Ye Xuan made a pose he thought was handsome and raised his right hand high.

Moments later, an extremely overbearing sword intent wreaked havoc in all directions, even creating spatial cracks around them.

At that moment, the entire space began to tremble violently, as if it was afraid by Ye Xuan’s sword intent.

Seeing this, Yanran was so shocked that she could not speak…

‘His Sword intent is this powerful?’
