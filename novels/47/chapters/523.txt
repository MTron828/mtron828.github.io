524 The Divine Gate Opens

Seeing the unfolding situation, Elder Tongtian and Daoist Qing Feng stopped fighting and focused on Ye Xuan and Elder Taiyin.

More and more spectators arrived, looking to watch the show.

However, unexpectedly, the battle they were looking forward to ended too quickly.

Ye Xuan simply raised the Cloud Heaven Sword up high, and then casually swung it at Elder Taiyin.

!!

In that instant, a huge gulf appeared in the blood-red sea as the sword strike’s indomitable momentum cascaded through the blood-red sea and passed through Elder Taiyin’s body.

Time seemed to stop briefly at this moment, before Elder Taiyin’s body slowly split into two and fell into the blood-red sea.

At this moment, the surroundings were surprisingly quiet. No one made a sound. Then…

“Heavens!”

“Just one move?”

Despite this being a battle between supreme realm experts, there was such a huge distance between the two combatants. Elder Taiyin could not even block a single move?

After dealing with Elder Taiyin, Ye Xuan unhurriedly put the Cloud Heaven Sword back into its scabbard.

It was as if he was not surprised at all by what he had done.

After the two halves of Elder Taiyin’s body fell into the blood-red sea, his body began to quickly decompose, releasing black mist that scattered into the sky.

Then, as if sensing the power of Ye Xuan’s sword strike, the entire ancient tomb began to tremble violently.

“Ah! What’s happening?”

The onlookers’ expressions changed as they looked around in panic.

Moments later, huge waves suddenly rose up in the blood-red sea. As the waves crashed against each other, a divine gate that exuded an ancient aura emerged from the depths of the sea, and a surge of energy rippled outward around it.

At this moment, the onlookers were all scared silly and began to flee in a panic.

Ye Xuan was still hovering in the air calmly. He unsheathed the Cloud Heaven Sword again, and the waves instantly subsided.

Yuelun had also flown over to Ye Xuan’s side at this time, and her eyes were fixed on the gate.

“The true tomb has finally appeared!”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan was also very surprised. After all, he had seen the heaven devouring divine sparrow enter the divine gate some time ago.

Now that the divine gate had opened once again, he finally had a chance to pursue the heaven devouring divine sparrow. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Unfortunately, the divine gate was releasing an extremely powerful aura, which was likely related to the fact that it had just appeared.

If one had not reached the supreme realm, there was simply no way to approach and enter it. One could only watch from afar.

Boom!

As the divine gate opened, the space within the entire ancient tomb began to crack, and more and more treasures appeared.

“Heavens! There are so many treasures here!”

Seeing that, the onlookers were all overjoyed, and immediately started to head for the treasures, ignoring the potential dangers.

After all, these treasures were all from some big shots from ancient times. Even if they obtained just one, it would be of great help to their cultivation.

No mystic lord realm expert could resist such temptation. They split up and chased after different treasures.

Even Yuelun seemed extremely happy as she focused on a treasure that was releasing flowing light and rushed over.

At this moment, Chu Tianba had also set his sights on a divine pill, and he was grinning from ear to ear.

“It’s actually a divine pill! Hahahaha!”

Chu Tianba chased after the divine pill without any hesitation. He knew that if he obtained and consumed it, it would only be a matter of time before he reached the supreme realm.

Elder Tongtian had his eyes on a treasure as well. The battle between him and Daoist Qing Feng had been abandoned, and they each chased after a treasure.

After the divine gate appeared, it was not only the interior of the ancient tomb that became lively, but even the area outside the ancient tomb was the same.

Ye Xuan did not care for these treasures at all. His eyes were fixed on the divine gate.

For him, the treasures that had just appeared were nothing in comparison to what was within the coffin on the back of the huge black tortoise.

As such, Ye Xuan decisively unleashed his supreme realm cultivation and charged into the divine gate with the Cloud Heaven Sword in hand.

After everyone left, the body that had been cut in half and scattered slowly condensed under the effect of the strange power!

Elder Taiyin’s body was gradually reformed bit by bit.

As soon as it was complete, he stared at the direction where Ye Xuan disappeared with a fierce expression. Then, he took out the divine fruit and swallowed it.

“Damn it! You overestimated yourself this time Ye Xuan!”

“I won’t be killed by you so easily!”

After saying this, Elder Taiyin shivered as he recalled the power of the sword strike Ye Xuan had unleashed.

Given the current situation, he could not provoke Ye Xuan no matter what. At the very least, he had to wait until he was strong enough to completely crush Ye Xuan.

This narrow escape from death made him understand many things. He had no time to care about the treasures.

After finding a place to hide, he focused on completing his breakthrough and forging his divine body.

As long as he was alive, there would be hope. Revenge could wait.

At the same time, the people outside the ancient tomb were also very excited when they saw the streaks of light inside the ancient tomb.

“The ancient tomb has already opened. Let’s hurry up and charge in!”

As soon as he finished speaking, thousands of cultivators rushed into the tomb.

Li Dahai stood alone at the forefront of the Great Wilderness Divine sect’s group. When he saw the cultivators swarming in front of him, he became even more agitated.

...

“Damn it! Why did you all go inside to fight for the treasures, and leave me outside to take care of the disciples?”

The more he spoke, the angrier he became. After all, almost all of the chiefs were here, but he was the only one left outside to babysit the disciples.
