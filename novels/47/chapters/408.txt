409 Do You Want To Stay At My Place?

Su Changhe’s mouth twitched when he heard that. He quickly whispered in Han Sikong’s ear.

“Senior Han, please don’t make fun of me. I’m not doing this for these women, I’m just afraid of their teacher.”

“That fellow’s strength is far too terrifying. If I didn’t do my part to take care of them, he would probably come to Qingyang City to personally deal with me.”

“Oh?” Han Sikong raised his eyebrows and looked at Su Changhe in surprise.

What kind of terrifying existence was it that could actually make the arrogant Young Master Su so frightened?

Furthermore, the Su family’s headquarters was in Qingyang City, and his father was also a powerful heaven realm expert.

Under such circumstances, Su Changhe was still so afraid of the other party. Could it be that their teacher’s strength exceeded the heaven realm?

“Who is Young Master Su referring to? Could it be that his strength is very terrifying?”

“Terrifying isn’t even enough to describe him. That guy can only be called abnormal!”

“I’m sure you know the strength of my family’s two heaven realm elders. They couldn’t even take one strike from him. They almost died on the spot,” Su Changhe said.

“It’s terrifying just recalling it. I’ve never seen such a powerful cultivator!”

“What? He injured two heaven realm experts with one strike?”

“If that’s the case, I’m quite interested in this person.”

Han Sikong narrowed his eyes.

Han Sikong knew the two Xia family heaven realm elders quite well. He had even fought them a few times.

Someone who could severely injure those two with one sword strike would be extraordinarily powerful.

When did the East Continent have such powerful cultivators? How had such a person escaped his notice?

If what Su Changhe said was true, then the teacher of these two women was indeed worth befriending.

“Where is their teacher from? Which holy land?”

“The chief of the Great Wilderness Divine sect’s Cloud Sky peak, Ye Xuan.”

“Great Wilderness Divine sect, Cloud Sky peak?”

Hearing this, a sage-like old man suddenly appeared in Han Sikong’s mind.

That old man had suppressed almost all the top holy lands in the East Continent by himself. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

That old man was Tian Xuan!

Tian Xuan was from Cloud Sky peak. Could Ye Xuan be his successor?

If so, then his strength made sense.

Immediately, Han Sikong turned to look at Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun. A mysterious light flashed across the depths of his eyes.

With his strength, he could naturally tell at a glance that the two women possessed the unique aura of divine bones.

‘Heavens! Both of them have high-grade divine bones.’

Han Sikong took a deep breath, and his expression became serious.

In the cultivation system of the mystic world, the higher the grade of one’s divine bones, the more potential they had to become peerless experts.

Zhuge Yueyue had already reached the first level of the materialization realm, and Feng Xiyun was a second level divine mystic realm cultivator.

He did not expect Ye Xuan’s disciples to be so talented!

‘This is really unbelievable! Ye Xuan’s luck in taking in disciples is so good. It seems that the Lin family has really kicked an iron plate!’

Thinking this, Han Sikong simply smiled and said nothing.

He also understood why Su Changhe wanted to befriend Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun at the cost of offending the Lin family.

It seemed that the Su family had made their choice to side with the Great Wilderness Divine sect.

The Great Wilderness Divine sect was extremely powerful and was one of the top holy lands of the Yangli divine empire, so it was indeed a good choice.

“What do you two fairies want to do? If the two of you don’t mind, I will immediately order people to clean up this mess.”

“Please don’t worry, I’ve decided not to have any ill intentions. I behaved inappropriately back then, and now I only want to atone for my sins. I hope Chief Ye Xuan can forgive me!”

“In Qingyang City, under the protection of our Su family, even the Lin family will not be able to make a move easily.”

Hearing this, Zhuge Yueyue started to hesitate.

She had a conservative personality and did not want to make a big deal out of it.

After all, Lin Dong still had the Immortal Divine sect behind him. If they were dragged into this conflict, it was extremely likely that it would cause a lot of trouble for her teacher.

“Senior Sister, since Young Master Su has invited us so graciously, why don’t we go over and stay for a few days?”

“Teacher has already gone to explore the surrounding area yesterday, and we don’t know when he will return. Rather than staying at an Inn and worrying about Lin Dong’s revenge, why not stay at the Su family’s residence for a few days instead?”

Feng Xiyun, who was at the side, spoke up at this point.

Although she was not afraid of the Lin family’s revenge, it would naturally be best if she could avoid it.

After all, her identity was extremely special. Unless it was a critical moment, it was best not to expose her identity.

“Since that’s the case, then we’ll go with Junior Sister’s suggestion!”

Zhuge Yueyue thought about it seriously and then agreed with Feng Xiyun’s idea.

However, Zhuge Yueyue was still worried about Ye Xuan.

The archaic divine mountain range which Ye Xuan was exploring was extremely dangerous.

Still, given her teacher’s current strength, unless he encountered a mystic lord realm descendant of an ancient beast, there would be no threat to him.

However, that strange aura that the beasts possessed was worrying. She regretted asking him to investigate this matter and felt a little guilty. That being said, all she could do now was pray inwardly that he would be safe.
