796 Flattery

As a peerless expert, Mengyu was proud and arrogant. She would never take advantage of others when they were in danger.

She had watched the battle just now. She felt that he was indeed qualified to fight her. However, that was the extent of it… Fight, not win.

The gap between an ancient realm expert and a sealed immortal realm expert could not be made up by external forces.

“Haha, you’re really interesting. Do you really think you can beat me?”

Mengyu smiled and said these words nonchalantly. At this moment, she was still a little confused. Where did Ye Xuan get the courage to challenge a sealed immortal realm expert as an ancient realm cultivator?

Could it be that this kid still had a trump card?

Seeing that Mengyu did not take him to heart at all, the corners of Ye Xuan’s mouth curled up slightly, but he did not say anything.

Instead, he observed at Daoist Yi Feng’s situation. As long as the latter completed sending all of these vengeful spirits into the reincarnation door, he would be able to fight Mengyu without worry.

At such a critical moment, he had to avoid accidentally angering this Great Demoness.

Ye Xuan appeared very calm at this moment. He smiled and said, “It is my honor to be able to fight Senior Mengyu.”

“I heard from my teacher a long time ago that you cultivate the Devouring Heaven technique and are very powerful. If I can fight you for one or two rounds, I’ll be satisfied.”

Hearing this, Mengyu felt somewhat proud. It seemed that in Tian Xuan’s heart, she was quite strong. Perhaps the cold and aloof Tian Xuan from back then was not such a boring person.

“Haha, you’re quite good at this. You’ve won my favor.”

Mengyu smiled as she said this. She looked in Daoist Yi Feng’s direction, wishing he would say something.

It seemed this martial nephew of his was much better at sweet-talking. Sigh…

Seeing the two people in the sky chatting happily without any signs of a war, everyone was stunned.

“What is Junior Brother Ye Xuan doing?”

“Why is he chatting so enthusiastically with this witch?”

Ao Lei, Gao Shun, and the rest were all staring at each other, not knowing what to make of the situation.

Just now, Ao Lei had already decided that he would do his best. Even if he had to mobilize the full power of the entire sect again, he had to stop Mengyu and help Ye Xuan and Daoist Yi Feng stall for time.

However, it seemed that Ye Xuan was doing it himself by flattery.

“Cough cough… It truly is different when nandsome people talk. At the very least, people are willing to listen to them,” Gao Shun muttered these words to himself.

If the person standing in front of Mengyu was an ugly man, the outcome of those words would probably be completely different.

“Sigh, it’s really good to be handsome…”

Boom!

Suddenly, huge energy fluctuations erupted from the door of reincarnation, sweeping toward Daoist Yi Feng and Ye Xuan.

Puchi!

Daoist Yi Feng instantly spat out blood, andeven Ye Xuan felt extremely uncomfortable at this moment.

After seeing Daoist Yi Feng spit out blood, Mengyu became a little flustered, but quickly concealed her emotions.

She did not choose to attack at this moment. Instead, she watched the two of them adapt to the situation. After adjusting himself with great difficulty, Ye Xuan consumed a medicinal pill and looked a little better.

“Martial Nephew Ye, help me stall for a little more time,” Daoist Yi Feng sent a message to Ye Xuan. Now that he had sent most of the vengeful spirits into the door of reincarnation, there was only one more thing left to do.

As long as he was successful, he would be able to go all out to deal with Mengyu.

He was already burning with anxiety, and so was Ye Xuan.

However, he was also very clear that at such a critical moment, only by staying calm could they ensure that everything would go smoothly.

“Suppress!”

Ye Xuan once again mobilized the spiritual power in his body to help purify these vengeful spirits. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

After doing all this, Ye Xuan turned around and looked at Mengyu.

“Senior Mengyu, you can be said to be a beauty that can topple a country. Since ancient times, you can be considered number one. As such, I’m very happy I got the chance to meet and chat with you.”

Ooh! More flattery!

Despite knowing it was all empty words to stall for time, Mengyu was still tickled. It seemed that this fellow was a ladies’ man.

If she had met him back then, instead of Daoist Yi Feng, would the outcome have been different? Who could reject a handsome and talkative little guy?

“Haha, you little brat, don’t think that you can escape death just because you keep flattering me.”

“Your Great Wilderness Divine sect still has to pay back those old debts.”

After hearing these words. Ao Lei and Gao Shun had worried looks on their faces. However, at this moment, a discordant voice rang out.

“You great witch, it should be our Great Wilderness Divine sect who wants to settle old scores with you!”

“Back then, tens of thousands of our members of our sect were slaughtered by you, but you were only stabbed by a sword!”

After hearing this, everyone looked over and realized that the person who said this was Li Dahai.

Ye Xuan was so angry that he wanted to curse. Damn it! Was this guy going to undo all the hard work he had put in to butter her up?

Why did he have to nitpick at this critical moment?
