696 Trump Cards (Part 1)

The same thought flashed through the minds of the other four disciples.

At the thought of using their trump cards, the five disciples were a little unwilling. After all, they were only temporary allies, and would eventually become enemies vying for the golden throne.

However, if none of them revealed their trump card, this fight with Xiang Yun would go on forever.

After she used her potato hammer to force the five of them back, she placed the hammer on her shoulder and raised her hand and made a beckoning gesture.

!!

“Seriously, you idiots are too weak.”

Hearing this blatant insult, the five of them became even angrier.

“Damn it! Am I really being humiliated by a little girl?”

At this moment, the five of them once again charged at Xiang Yun and engulfed her in a flurry of attacks. Xiang Yun remained calm and went on the defensive, rendering their attacks ineffective.

However, as time passed, her strength gradually began to wane because she had been exerting herself against five opponents.

This was their plan anyway. If they did not want to reveal their trump cards, then the only way to end this fight was to drain her of energy before finishing her off.

Unfortunately, things did not go to plan. Sensing her strength wane, she took out a pill and swallowed it without hesitation, immediately recovering to her peak condition in the blink of an eye.

“What the heck? What kind of pill is that? I’ve never seen a pill that can restore a person’s energy to their peak condition so quickly!”

The people watching outside the ancient realm were utterly dumbfounded, and immediately turned to look at Ye Xuan in unison, making him feel a little awkward.

“Ahem, it’s nothing much. It’s just a high-grade soul-returning pill. It’s nothing special. ”

Hearing this, everyone’s jaws dropped.

If this kind of medicinal pill was put up for grabs, many people would die fighting over it. Despite this, Ye Xuan did not consider it special?

At this moment, even Daoist Canghai felt embarrassed. He looked at Ye Xuan and asked tentatively, “Little Brother Ye, just how many medicinal pills did you give your disciples?”

It seemed that these disciples of his often consumed this pill, so he was a little worried about how many she possessed.

If this situation continued to develop like this, this little girl would never run out of energy as long as she had enough medicinal pills.

After hearing Daoist Canghai’s question, Ye Xuan’s lips curled up slightly as he replied, “I didn’t give them too much. I only gave each of them a hundred pills.”

When they heard these words, they felt as if tens of thousands of horses were trampling on their hearts.

A hundred

Just how rich was Cloud Sky peak?

Was this not cheating?

Seeing their shocked expressions, Ye Xuan simply smiled enigmatically.

In fact, he definitely did not have that many high-grade soul-returning pills, and had only given them three each, with Zhuge Yueyue getting two more.

However, was he going to let these people know that?

Hell no!

Although it was not a lot, it was enough for this battle.

Xiang Yun also gradually adapted to the rhythm of fighting against five people, and became more skilled and nimble with her body.

Due to her size, she could easily maneuver around the battlefield and dodge most attacks. Furthermore, despite her diminutive figure, her hammer hit like a truck. As such, she was a nightmare to fight against.

On Zhuge Yueyue’s side, she and Mu Beichen were still locked in battle, and already fought for more than a thousand rounds. To a certain extent, they had already figured out the other party’s attacks.

Smiling faintly, Mu Beichen hovered in the air and said, “Truly worthy of being Chief Ye Xuan’s eldest disciple!”

Zhuge Yueyue smiled and replied, “You’re quite strong yourself.”

After exchanging some pleasantries, they once again mobilized their sword auras.

“Zhuge Yueyue, since we’ve already reached this stage, let’s not drag this out any longer. Let’s decide the winner with this move.”

Zhuge Yueyue had no objections to this and accepted his challenge.

“Sure, let’s do this!”

After that, they put some distance between each other and began to prepare their ultimate moves.

Mu Beichen threw the Xuanming Sword into the sky. As he performed a number of hand seals, the Xuanming Sword began to transform.

“Is that a sword control technique?”

After seeing this scene, many people noticed that Mu Beichen was using a heaven-grade divine power!

Under his control, the Xuanming Sword floated in front of him and began to exude a terrifying amount of sword aura. Then, the Xuanming Sword began to rapidly multiply.

“Ten Thousand Swords Empire.”

The sword control technique that Mu Beichen used could create ten thousand copies of a sword, increasing its lethality manifold.

Zhuge Yueyue was surprised to see this, and the Cloud Sky Sword in her hand trembled uncontrollably.

She lowered his head to look at the Cloud Sky Sword and muttered to herself, “Even you are excited?”

The corners of her mouth curled into a smile. She then gripped the Cloud Sky Sword tightly with both hands and soared into the sky.

At this moment, she looked like an angel who had descended from the heavens, sacred and inviolable.

Seeing this scene, everyone’s jaws dropped in shock. They had already guessed which move Zhuge Yueyue was going to use
