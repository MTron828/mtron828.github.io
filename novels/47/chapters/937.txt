938 Righteous Hero

The Nine-tailed Sparrow had never expected that someone would bravely stand up to the flood dragon when she was in danger.

Furthermore, this Thunder-Devouring Beast’s bloodline was not weaker than the flood dragon’s at all. He was also a descendant of an ancient divine beast.

Because of this, she had already begun to feel grateful. It seemed that there were still good and righteous people in this world who would lend a helping hand when they encountered injustice.

She was surprised by the Thunder-Devouring Beast’s domineering appearance. His entire body was releasing purple lightning, and his aura was shockingly strong.

It had to be said that the appearance that the Thunder-Devouring Beast had worked so hard on had actually come in handy today. At the very least, it was useful in attracting women, was it not?

On a separate note, Ye Xuan was also very shocked when he discovered the person who said this was the Thunder-Devouring Beast.

Turning around and seeing the latter’s nonchalant expression, he wondered to himself, ‘When did this kid become so brave?’

Was this even the same Thunder-Devouring Beast from earlier?

Yanran was also puzzled. Although her contact with the Thunder-Devouring Beast was quite brief, she already had a rough idea of the Thunder-Devouring Beast’s character, and this was definitely out of character for him.

Where did he get the guts to say this?

“Ye Xuan, is Little Thunder stupid? Why did he suddenly become so bold?”

Yanran looked at Ye Xuan blankly and asked. Her current silly and cute appearance formed a sharp contrast with her cold image from before.

After Ye Xuan recovered from his dazed state, he said with uncertainty, “Perhaps this is the courage that love has given him.”

“Ah? Love?”

Yanran was completely dumbfounded. She did not understand what Ye Xuan was talking about at all.

At this moment, Ye Xuan just smiled and did not say anything else. He turned his focus back on the flood dragon, which was releasing a terrifying amount of killing intent.

It was obvious that a great battle was about to break out soon, and everyone could feel the atmosphere turn oppressive.

Ye Xuan was quite befuddled by the Thunder-Devouring Beast’s actions.

After thinking for a moment, he said to Yanran, “Let’s see how things develop first. There’s no need to be anxious.”

After the flood dragon and the Thunder-Devouring Beast’s gazes clashed, the flood dragon finally spoke coldly. Its words made the onlookers tremble involuntarily.

“I was wondering who it was, but it turned out to be the coward who hid himself and didn’t dare to come out for ten thousand years. Do you go senile from age? Do you actually think you can defeat me?”

The flood dragon was full of disdain. The others might not understand and might be frightened by the appearance of the Thunder-Devouring Beast. As the two had fought before, it was very clear about the Thunder-Devouring Beast’s strength, or rather lack thereof.

Seeing that the flood dragon was about to expose him, the Thunder-Devouring Beast hurriedly roared, “Shut your stinking mouth!”

“You’re just a mixed-blood creature. How dare you criticize an actual descendant of a divine beast!”

“My goodness!”

After hearing the Thunder-Devouring Beast’s words, Ye Xuan could not help but exclaim.

What was wrong with this beast? Why did he become so brave?

On the other side, after hearing the Thunder-Devouring Beast’s words, the Flood Dragon’s expression turned cold. The fact that it was a mixed-blood creature was undeniable, without which it would have reached a higher realm by now.

Coincidentally, this was the reason why the flood dragon wanted to fuse its own mixed bloodline with the bloodline of an actual divine beast descendant like the Thunder-Devouring Beast so that it could break the shackles of its bloodline. This was why it had tried so hard to devour the Thunder-Devouring Beast back then.

However, despite this Thunder-Devouring Beast’s lack of strength, he was very good at escaping, and it could not catch him at all! Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

It had chased after the Thunder-Devouring Beast for nearly a hundred years, but had never even come close to touching him.

At this moment, when it heard the Thunder-Devouring Beast say that it was a mixed-blood creature, the anger in its heart could no longer be suppressed.

“You… You’re very bold!”

The flood dragon bared its teeth and said this. Its eyes were already filled with killing intent. It turned its attention away from the Nine-tailed Sparrow and focused on the Thunder-Devouring Beast.

It was worth mentioning that the Thunder-Devouring Beast might not be good at other things, but it was very good at transferring aggro.

“You’ll definitely regret what you just said!”

As soon as it finished speaking, the flood dragon instantly released dense pitch-black divine runs. Its killing intent seemed to make the surroundings freeze.

Seeing this, the Thunder-Devouring Beast, which had been pretending to be calm, was now somewhat flustered. He of course knew that he could not defeat the flood dragon.

The reason he said all that was because he had learned how to impress girls from Ye Xuan. He wanted to gain the Nine-tailed Sparrow’s attention, so he pretended to be awesome and said those words.

Obviously, what he said just now had worked, and he had successfully attracted the Nine-tailed Sparrow’s attention, and it seemed that he had earned a favorable first impression.

However, he did not want to fight the flood dragon!

Despite seeing that the flood dragon was already charging toward him, he still stubbornly said, “You little worm! You actually dare act so unrestrained in my territory? You actually want to fight me?”

“Piss off! You’ll have to earn the qualifications to fight me first! Beat my brother, and then I’ll consider fighting you!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the Thunder-Devouring Beast flew behind Ye Xuan. He still had a calm expression on his face, as if the entire was par for the course.

However, Ye Xuan was dumbfounded at this moment. What was this fellow trying to pull?

After showing off, he wanted Ye Xuan to clean up his mess?

Where did this fellow learn such bad tricks?
