684 Prelude To Battle (Part 2)

“Mu Beichen and the Reincarnation Fair’s rankings are too high. If we fight them, we have no chance of winning.”

‘Haha, her presence here is a blessing. I’ll challenge her later and secure my spot at the summit!’

Many people shared the same thought.

Zhuge Yueyue almost burst out laughing when she noticed their gazes.

They thought that her third sister was easy pickings, but would soon find out just how wrong they were.

She turned around and stared at Xie Tianyu coldly.

“Xie Tianyu, we don’t have to waste any more time. Hurry up and pick your door!”

Zhuge Yueyue did not hesitate to issue a challenge to Xie Tianyu.

Today, a fight between the two of them was unavoidable.

Xie Tianyu thought the same as well. He replied coldly, “Hmph! You think you’re all that, don’t you? Bring it on!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he stepped into the fourth door without hesitation.

Seeing this, Hua Rufeng asked, “Sister Zhuge, how about I deal with him instead?”

As the chief disciple of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, he was confident in his chances.

After all, Ye Xuan had personally guided him in the past 30 days, allowing him to improve by leaps and bounds. Moreover, he had even mastered the most powerful divine power of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, the Great Desolation technique.

Even if he were to face Mu Beichen head-on, he was confident that he would be able to hold his own proudly.

He wanted to use this opportunity to help Zhuge Yueyue to repay Ye Xuan. However, Zhuge Yueyue did not agree. She said, “Senior Brother Hua, leave him to me. After all, this is a grudge between me and him. Moreover, this involves my teacher’s reputation.”

“Help me take care of Xiang Yun. I’ll set off first.”

After saying this, Zhuge Yueyue briefly gave Xiang Yun a few instructions before stepping into the fourth door.

Seeing that his suggestion was rejected, Hua Rufeng smiled helplessly.

Then, he looked at Xiang Yun and asked, “Little junior sister, which door do you want to enter?”

Xiang Yun hesitated when she heard this.

She originally wanted to enter the fourth door with her first sister, but after finding out that she would have to fight her first sister, she gave up on this idea.

After scanning the remaining six doors, she pointed to the seventh one and said, “Senior Brother, I’ll enter this one.”

“Alright, then go on ahead,” Hua Rufeng said with a smile.

After making sure she entered safely, he entered the eighth door.

The moment he did, many people became happy.

“Haha, everyone, let’s meet at the peak!”

As soon as he finished speaking, this person flew toward the seventh door before anyone else could reply.

However, just as he was about to step inside, he was pulled back by someone else.

“Haha, Brother, you probably won’t be able to deal with what’s behind this door.”

“Is that so? Fine! Let’s fight to see who earns the right to enter this door. What do you say?”

After hearing this, the disciple who had stopped him instantly flew into a rage out of humiliation.

“Can you listen to my advice? I’m only doing this for your own good. I’m afraid that you’ll be deceived by her young age.”

“Haha! Your joke is really funny. Not! Do you think I’m a three-year-old child?”

At this moment, the two disciples were already arguing.

However, just as they were arguing fiercely, someone took advantage of the situation and quietly stepped inside the seventh door.

“F*ck!”

By the time the two of them noticed it, it was already too late. However, there was nothing they could do. After all, they could no longer enter the seventh door, so they could only choose another one.

On the other side, Zhuge Yueyue and Xie Tianyu were already at a standoff inside the space behind the fourth door.

Even though they had not started fighting, the atmosphere was already extremely stifling.

Outside the ancient realm, everyone was watching this scene with bated breaths.

Almost everyone here had witnessed the earlier conflict between the Supreme Divine sect and the Great Wilderness Divine sect, and knew that this would be the curtain-closer of their feud. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Daoist Gu Hao’s breathing quickened. Whether or not the Supreme Divine sect could regain its dignity depended on Xie Tianyu.

They had already lost miserably earlier, so this was their final chance at redemption.

Even though there were ten doors, all eyes were on Zhuge Yueyue and Xie Tianyu.

Yuelun came over to Ye Xuan’s side and said softly, “Junior Brother Ye, Xie Tianyu was defeated by Yueyue previously. Do you think his courage to fight her again this time is due to him having mastered a divine power that can restrain her?”

Judging from Xie Tianyu’s actions, he must have made ample preparations.

Moreover, because they had fought before, he had a better grasp of Zhuge Yueyue’s strength than most.

There had to be a basis for his confidence.

After Ye Xuan smiled, he glanced at the confident-looking Daoist Gu Hao and said, “Senior Sister Yuelun, don’t worry. No matter how well-prepared he is, Yueyue can still handle it.”

“Oh?”

After hearing this, even Ao Lei was surprised.

Could it be that Ye Xuan also taught Zhuge Yueyue an ultimate move?
