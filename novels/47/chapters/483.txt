484 Pixiu, Danger!

Boom!

Each step the black tortoise took was extremely slow, but contained terrifying power. Then, while everyone was watching, a powerful aura suddenly emerged from the direction of the archaic divine mountains, and a huge ancient beast descendant made its appearance.

“What? It’s actually a Pixiu…”

Seeing this, Situ Mo’s expression changed drastically.

!!

He had not expected there to be another terrifying ancient beast descendant aside from the heaven devouring divine sparrow.

Furthermore, from the aura it was exuding, this Pixiu had already reached the supreme realm!

“What the hell is going on? The situation in the East continent is going to change drastically now!”

The onlookers were all terrified when they saw the Pixiu.

Even Situ Mo was anxious. He quickly said to the Reincarnation Fairy and the cultivators behind him, “The appearance of the Pixiu is an ominous sign. We must leave as soon as possible!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Situ Mo quickly crushed the teleportation talisman in his storage ring and brought everyone away.

Although he was a middle-stage mystic lord realm expert, and might be able to hold his own if the two beasts fought, he would not be able to protect the disciples.

Reincarnation Fairy was the Saintess of the Jade Lake Divine palace, so he had to ensure her safety. As such, he chose to retreat first and await reinforcements.

Boom!

At this moment, a lightning bolt the size of an arm suddenly fell from the sky and crashed into the ground below.

A huge crack suddenly appeared in the ground, and one could see tendrils of lightning emerging from the impact site.

With the appearance of the black tortoise and the Pixiu, panic set in.

In addition to the cultivators from the Jade Lake Divine sect, there were also experts and disciples from other top holy lands present. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

In that instant! Everyone’s expression changed.

“What happened?”

When they looked up, they were shocked and stunned.

“Oh my God, it’s actually a Pixiu!”

“Hurry up and run!”

This voice echoed many others in the area, as all of the cultivators who were situated on the outskirts of the archaic divine mountain ran for their lives frantically.

Situ Mo and the others did not stop fleeing after teleporting either.

“This is really unbelievable. I thought that the most dangerous thing in the archaic divine mountains would be the heaven devouring divine sparrow, but now a Pixiu has shown up.”

Reincarnation Fairy’s face was extremely pale. She felt that this was related to the ominous feeling she had sensed the night before.

The Pixiu used the power of lightning to attack the black tortoise.

The destructive power that erupted caused the archaic mountains to tremble. However, although the Pixiu was extremely powerful, the black tortoise seemed to be stronger.

The power of lightning then transformed into a huge purple dragon that tore through the sky and bombarded the black tortoise.

Shockingly, the black tortoise simply ignored the purple lightning dragon and simply continued moving forward.

Then, as soon as the purple lightning dragon touched the huge coffin, it dissipated into nothingness.

What terrified Situ Mo and the others the most was that although the huge black tortoise seemed to move very slowly, every step it took seemed to bring it further and further away from the Pixiu. No matter how hard the Pixiu tried to catch up, it could not.

Just as everyone was wondering if the black tortoise was about to disappear without a trace again, flames that could burn everything suddenly erupted from the other direction of the archaic divine mountains.

Buzzzzz!

An ear-piercing screech was heard as a huge bird soared into the sky. Each of its feathers contained the power of true fire.

“What? The heaven devouring divine sparrow has also appeared ..”

Everyone’s expression changed drastically when they saw this.

They had not expected that the heaven devouring divine sparrow, which they had been searching for all day, was actually hidden underneath a leyline outside the archaic divine mountains.

The heaven devouring divine sparrow soared into the sky, and then its huge wings suddenly began to spin, forming a spinning wheel of fire that covered the sky.

“Saintess, be careful!”

A fireball containing terrifying power suddenly hurtled toward the Reincarnation Fairy.

Seeing this, Situ Mo’s expression changed drastically. The spiritual power in his body swept out, and he used his most powerful divine power to condense a barrier to block the fireball.

After all, this fireball was something created by a supreme realm existence. Although it was just a casual attack, even he might not be able to withstand it.

Seeing this, Reincarnation Fairy’s face turned even paler.

At this moment, the fireball hit the barrier, and its flames started to devour the barrier.

“I… Am I really going to die here?”

She stared at the fireball that was inching closer and closer to her with a desperate expression. She wanted to run, but the fireball had a large impact radius that she would not be able to outrun even with her short-distance teleportation talisman.

“No…”

“No!”

Situ Mo shouted anxiously as he tried to use his divine power again.

However, at this moment, a lightning bolt suddenly fell from the sky and was about to hit him.

Now, Situ Mo was caught in a dilemma.

He could choose to try and block the fireball, or protect himself and the other disciples behind him.
