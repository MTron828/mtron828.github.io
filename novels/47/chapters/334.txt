335 Golden God Palm

The cold-looking man briefly examined the mysterious power contained in the fragment before storing it into his sea of consciousness. Then, it transformed back into its dragon form and slowly circled the depths of the endless sea.

A year…

He only had to wait another year.

The ancient black dragon had lived for close to two million years, and a year was just a blink of an eye.

!!

After receiving the ancient black dragon’s order, the sea race launched a full-scale attack on the Huangyu Zone, while also keeping up their war efforts in the Tianze Zone as a distraction.

The Tianwu Zone, which was next to the Huangyu Zone, was also not spared.

In this war, those below the core formation realm were not even qualified to be cannon fodder.

Core formation realm cultivators that were rarely seen in small and medium-sized empires were easily found in abundance in this war.

Only unity realm experts had any chance of affecting the tide of battle in any meaningful way.

As the war between the two races intensified, the land was filled with extremely violent energy. Spatial cracks appeared everywhere and void power erupted from those cracks.

Mountains collapsed, and blood flowed like rivers. The world was filled with the dense scent of blood.

In this war, core formation realm and unity realm experts fought in the outside world, and pattern condensation realm experts fought within the spatial turbulence. However, in the depths of the spatial turbulence, that was where the King realm experts fought. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Incidentally, most members of the sea race avoided these depths, fearing that Ye Xuan would suddenly materialize out of nowhere and kill them. In some sense, he contributed to the war in his own way.

Buzzzzzz!

In the pitch-black darkness of the spatial turbulence, a huge hand suddenly slapped toward a white shark the size of a small mountain, turning it into dust in an instant.

The dead two-pattern condensation realm was a sea race expert. Although he was powerful, he was still not Jun Lingtian’s match.

Jun Lingtian’s strength was not particularly outstanding in the Huangyu Zone. However, ignoring Ye Xuan and Shangguan Wan’er, he was the strongest pattern condensation realm expert here, a sixth-level pattern condensation realm expert.

He was also a step away from engraving his seventh profound pattern.

Not far away, the pitch-black darkness was lit up by sword qi, which wounded a sea race expert.

This was Zhao Yuzhen, the master of the Myriad Swords Hall..

However, compared to Jun Lingtian, Zhao Yuzhen was slightly weaker. He had only engraved three profound patterns.

With the two experts joining hands, they became a huge obstacle to the advance of the sea race’s pattern condensation realm experts.

Of course, although they were strong, they were not the strongest pattern condensation realm experts. In many other zones, it was not uncommon to see seven or eight-pattern condensation realm experts.

However, Jun Lingtian came from the Divine Gate Holy Land, so he naturally had many powerful trump cards.

All in all, unless a King’s realm expert attacked, he would remain relatively safe.

Of course, the trump card he had was to guard against Qian Daoliu’s main body. Over the many years, he had yet to see any trace of Qian Daoliu’s main body.

Jun Lingtian even had a suspicion that this fellow had been killed by someone, or was trapped somewhere. Eventually, his focus shifted to the war between the two races.

When he first learned that Ye Xuan had defeated the sea race King realm experts in the Huangyu Zone, his heart had been filled with shock. Even now, he still found it hard to believe.

Roar!

At this moment, a low growl suddenly rang out from the spatial turbulence, which then turned into a sound wave that swept towards Jun Lingtian.

“Hmph! You’re seeking death!”

“Heavenly Seal!”

“Hmph!” Jun Lingtian snorted coldly. His palm was filled with terrifying power, which soon transformed into a huge palm that slapped the sound wave.

The two powerful energies collided fiercely, and the energy fluctuations formed instantly shook the surrounding space.

At this moment, a dazzling aurora suddenly flickered and pierced through space in an instant, heading straight for Jun Lingtian. It wanted to shatter Jun Lingtian’s sea of consciousness.

Seeing this, Jun Lingtian’s lips curled into a cold smile. He did not dodge or evade.

It was the tail of an abyssal python that contained penetration intent.

“Golden God Palm!”

“Die!” Jun Lingtian growled, and his body blossomed with dazzling golden light. The surrounding space trembled, and a huge golden palm suddenly fell from the sky, slamming toward the abyssal python with unparalleled power.

Boom!

…

“How is this possible? You’ve actually comprehended annihilation intent, and even fused it!”

The abyssal python was sent flying thousands of meters away by the golden palm. Its pitch-black eyes were filled with shock.

Jun Lingtian’s power had completely exceeded his imagination. This guy had actually fused annihilation intent, palm intent and wave intent.

When combined with the earth-rank martial technique Golden God palm, its power was terrifying!
