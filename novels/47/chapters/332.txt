333 Perfecting Sword Intent Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

In the depths of the spatial turbulence, mysterious ripples suddenly appeared, revealing the figure of a young man.

This young man was obviously Ye Xuan.

He hovered in place and kept making hand seals. The spatial and strength intents in his body suddenly swept out engulfed the area he was in.

Soon, an independent space appeared in the surrounding spatial turbulence.

After a month, Ye Xuan had finally created an independent space in the spatial turbulence.

Compared to the Tianyuan continent, the independent space was rather small, but it was actually the size of Earth. Also, thanks to the infusion of spatial and strength intents, it had an extremely sturdy spatial barrier.

The moment this independent space was formed, a powerful suction force gushed out from within and started frantically absorbing the surrounding spiritual energy. At the same time, Ye Xuan also used his spiritual sense to refine the spiritual energy and inject it into the independent space.

After that, Ye Xuan set up more formations and continuously strengthened its spatial barriers. This independent space was only to conceal the heavenly phenomena, so he did not need to develop other aspects of it.

One layer after another, he kept stacking the formations. However, as the number of formations increased, the difficulty of making a new layer also increased.

After half a year, Ye Xuan was finally done.

“It’s time,” Ye Xuan mumbled.

The independent space had been reinforced by the power of multiple formations. Even a great emperor might not be able to break through its defenses.

Furthermore, its capabilities in terms of concealing auras was especially powerful.

In this newly-created independent space, other than the power of the surrounding multiple formations, there was only chaos. However, since it had already been created, in time, it would evolve into a realm with its own laws and become a mystic realm.

Moments later, Ye Xuan flicked his sleeve, and the Destiny Divine Tower appeared in the center of the independent space. Then, his body flashed and he reappeared in the place where Shangguan Wan’er was cultivating in seclusion.

“It’s time,” Ye Xuan looked at Shangguan Wan’er and said with a smile.

“Great!”

Hearing this, Shangguan Wan’er was ecstatic.

She was finally going to awaken her special constitution. That being said, she was also incredibly curious about what special constitution Ye Xuan would awaken.

“Yue, Qingyan, Yan’er, cultivate well. I’ll help Wan ‘er awaken her sword physique first.”

“Don’t panic if you sense any strange phenomena!”

Before Ye Xuan left, he gave a few instructions to Yue and the others.

“Yes, Teacher.”

Ye Xuan and Shangguan Wan’er appeared on the top floor of the Destiny Divine Tower.

“I gave you the Dream Star Spirit Flower earlier. It’s time to use it,” Ye Xuan said.

“En!” Shangguan Wan’er nodded.

She slowly opened her hand, revealing a starry flower that exuded a dreamy light. Then, it turned into specks of starlight and scattered into the sky.

Ye Xuan stretched out his hand, and his spiritual sense helped her to quickly refine it.

“Ding! Thanks to the host, his disciple has obtained a 46-day epiphany experience opportunity. The host has received a randomized 10x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained a 460-day epiphany experience opportunity!”

“Wan’er, next, I will help you to perfect your sword intent! Use the epiphany opportunity well,” Ye Xuan said.

“Alright, Teacher!”

Shangguan Wan’er nodded.

Moments later, Ye Xuan reached out and clenched his fist. A divine sword appeared in his hands, and the power of his perfect-level sword intent rippled.

At present, Shangguan Wan’er’s sword intent had reached the seventh level.

Therefore, Ye Xuan chose to start showcasing his sword intent from the seventh level. He took extra care to ensure that her shortcomings were addressed.

Shangguan Wan’er’s gaze was transfixed on Ye Xuan as various insights filled her mind.

As time passed, the sword qi that Shangguan Wan’er was emitting became more and more terrifying.
