453 Jealousy?

“Wait... If I remember correctly, your opponents were Hidden Sword peak cultivators, right?”

“What’s the result of your matches? Did you defeat your opponents?”

Suddenly, Yuelun recalled something important.

In order to target Ye Xuan, Gao Shun had specially arranged for two Hidden Sword peak cultivators to deal with Feng Xiyun and Zhuge Yueyue in the first round.

If these two girls lost, Ye Xuan’s mood would be terrible.

When Feng Xiyun heard this, she smiled mischievously.

“Don’t worry, Chief Yuelun. We won both our matches. Martial Uncle Gao was so angry that he vomited blood and fainted. His disciples were forced to carry him back to Hidden Sword peak.”

When Yuelun heard this, she laughed. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“I didn’t think that such a wonderful thing would happen while I was not there. It’s really a pity.”

Yuelun was not on good terms with Gao Shun either, so seeing him suffer a loss was quite gratifying.

Feng Xiyun then recounted the entire story to her.

The corners of Yuelun’s mouth involuntarily curved up, and she had already begun to imagine the scene in her mind. She did not expect Ye Xuan to have such a sharp tongue. A few sentences were all it took to consign Gao Shun to his fate.

‘This guy is getting more unruly… but I like it.’

At the thought of this, she smiled widely.

When Feng Xiyun and Zhuge Yueyue saw this scene, they were dumbfounded.

“Senior Sister, I suddenly have a strange feeling. It seems that Chief Yuelun has taken a fancy to our teacher…”

At this moment, Feng Xiyun quietly went over to Zhuge Yueyue’s side and whispered in her ear.

When Zhuge Yueyue heard this, she was shocked. When she did a double take, Yuelun did indeed look like a maiden in love.

“It seems... that it’s really as you said...” Zhuge Yueyue was stunned.

After some time, Yuelun came back to her senses and said, “Mm! You’ve done well and did not let your teacher down.”

“For the past hundred years, Gao Shun has been looking for an opportunity to suppress Cloud Sky peak. This Seven Peaks competition is undoubtedly his best opportunity, and he has no doubt made preparations for this.”

“However, you two turned the tables on him…”

“Hahaha!”

Yuelun could not help but laugh.

When Feng Xiyun and Zhuge Yueyue saw this, they also revealed smiles.

“I almost forgot...”

At this moment, Yuelun seemed to have thought of something. His gaze fell on Feng Xiyun, and her eyes were filled with curiosity.

“Little girl, didn’t you only start cultivating a little over a month ago? Your opponent was a ninth-level divine mystic realm cultivator. How did you defeat your opponent?”

As soon as she finished speaking, the surrounding disciples of Water Sky peak also looked up.

In the past Seven Peaks competitions, ninth-level divine mystic realm cultivators were considered top experts. Other than the talented geniuses who had broken through to the materialization realm, the majority of the ranking disciples had reached this realm.

Hearing this, Feng Xiyun smiled.

“It’s all thanks to Teacher. I’ve already broken through to the first level of the materialization realm…”

“What? Materialization realm?”

When Yuelun heard this, she stood up in shock. Everyone else was dumbfounded as well.

What kind of f*cking talent was this?

In a month? A month?

Li Xue’er’s eyes dimmed.

“I’ve been cultivating for more than three months, yet I’ve only reached the third level of the divine mystic realm.”

She had lost to Zhuge Yueyue, which was fine because she was her best friend, but now this new junior sister had surpassed her as well!

Was every disciple of Cloud Sky peak so monstrous?

Feng Xiyun smiled, but did not say anything.

Zhuge Yueyue walked over and held Li Xue’er’s hand.

“Although Junior Sister Feng has just started on the path of cultivation, in order for her to catch up with others as soon as possible, Teacher helped her to absorb a precious bone of a heaven realm descendant of an ancient beast.

“Hiss!”

As soon as she finished speaking, the surroundings fell deathly silent. Everyone’s eyes were filled with shock.

A precious bone of that level?

Something that valuable would even tempt Yuelun.

What was Ye Xuan thinking? how could he give it to his disciple so selflessly?

Yuelun was even more stunned.

She naturally knew the origin of the precious bone that Zhuge Yueyue was talking about. It was the precious bone of the ancient ape that Ye Xuan had obtained back then. She had thought that the precious bone had helped Ye Xuan reach the mystic lord realm.

However, it seemed that it was given to his disciple instead.

‘Isn’t this guy spoiling his disciple too much? Why isn’t he so good to me?’

Yuelun felt like pouting, but restrained herself. After all, how could she be jealous of a disciple, right?
