855 The Incomplete Cloud Sky Technique (Part 2)

Completing the Cloud Sky technique was Qian Yi’s lifelong wish, and had been the wish of those who had gone before him.

Now that he finally saw a glimmer of hope, how could he miss it?

Seeing Qian Yi’s sincere expression, Ye Xuan smiled. This guy was quite sincere.

“Get up first.”

After Ye Xuan finished speaking, he sat back down and pondered for a moment before saying indifferently, “Your Cloud Sky technique and ours are of the same origin, but yours should be the upper half.”

“The upper half alone should have only allowed you to reach the mystic lord realm at best, but you managed to reach the supreme realm. From this, I can tell that you or those before you have spent a lot of effort trying to fix this incomplete technique.”

Elder Qian Yi nodded.

“It is as you said, Sword Immortal Ye. I admire your insight,” Elder Qian Yi said with admiration.

After pondering for a moment, Ye Xuan’s face was still expressionless as he spoke, “Continuing to open up a new path on a broken road is not wrong. You and your ancestors have done very well.”

“Unfortunately, the new path that was created has already gone wrong.

Perhaps you have also noticed it yourself, because after breaking through to the supremacy realm, there have been no signs of any further improvement.”

Elder Qian Yi immediately replied, “Yes, yes, it’s like I’ve encountered a dead end. If I don’t resolve this problem, I will never advance ever again.”

“Please, Sword Immortal Ye, tell me how I should resolve this problem.”

This was the crux of this matter. Could Ye Xuan really change his fate?

Well, in the past, Ye Xuan did not have the ability to deal with such matters, but it was different now.

‘This is quite interesting. If I really help him complete the cultivation technique, will I get a reward from the system?’

Honestly, if not for the possible system reward, Ye Xuan would not have bothered. After all, neither he nor his disciples were using the Cloud Sky technique any longer. However, the temptation of a system reward was too hard to resist.

At this moment, Ye Xuan had already stood up and released a purple beam of light with a wave of his hand, which slowly covered his entire body.

Since the lower half of the Cloud Sky technique was in his possession, it was indeed possible to complete the technique. The main issue lay in streamlining them after the countless modifications and improvements each half of the technique had undergone over the years.

Without the necessary insight, it would be difficult to identify and comprehend the connection points. Moreover, the slightest misstep would lead to an imperfect technique.

At this moment, Elder Qian Yi was looking at Ye Xuan eagerly. Then, Ye Xuan disappeared and reappeared in front of Elder Qian Yi, sending him flying with a palm strike.

Puchi!

A streak of red blood spurted out, and Elder Qian Yi felt waves of unbearable pain assault his body.

“Martial Uncle Ye…”

Hua Rufeng was completely stunned. This Elder Qian Yi was not some random person. He came from the Great Wilderness Divine sect of the Heaven continent!

If something happened to this person while he was visiting them, they would have no way to explain themselves to their sister sect. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Hua Rufeng stood rooted on the spot. What was with this sudden turn of events?

However, one thing was certain. If Ye Xuan really wanted to kill Elder Qian Yi, no one in the sect could stop him.

‘Oh no, this is bad. This time, I’m doomed.’

Hua Rufeng’s only thought was to immediately return to the main peak and call for help.

On the ground, Elder Qian Yi was dazed and confused. He did not know why Ye Xuan had severely injured him. He could clearly sense that the cultivation he had painstakingly worked on for his entire life had been destroyed.

“Ahhh!”

This was something he had spent countless years accumulating, but it was destroyed by someone on a whim today. This was not something he could accept.

Seeing that Ye Xuan was already closing in on him, Elder Qian Yi felt hopeless, but struggled desperately to escape. However, there was no way he could escape the hands of a sealed immortal realm expert.

In an instant, Ye Xuan appeared once more in front of Elder Qian Yi and placed his hand on the latter’s head.

In the blink of an eye, a terrifying amount of power was transmitted into Elder Qian Yi’s body, causing his entire body to emit a purple glow.

“Good heavens!”

When Feng Xiyun, who was at the side, noticed this scene, she was surprised, but immediately understood what was going on and quietly watched.

Originally, when she saw her teacher attack, she had also wanted to say something to dissuade him. However, based on the current situation, she had been worrying too much…
