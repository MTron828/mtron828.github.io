841 A Great Battle (Part 1)

“You are quite strong, but still nothing special. You should start preparing to meet your maker,” the golden-furred growler ancestor said with a gloomy expression.

His strength was completely revealed at this moment, and he charged toward Ye Chen like a comet.

Ye Xuan watched him approach calmly. He could tell that the golden-furred growler ancestor’s innate divine power was far more powerful than the little golden-furred growler’s.

“Die!”

With a cold snort, Ye Xuan instantly drew his sword and charged over to meet the golden-furred growler ancestor. In the blink of an eye, he unleashed a red sword beam at the latter.

Boom!

The world shook violently as the destructive shockwaves from the impact swept out into the surroundings, including…

“Oh no, dodge quickly!”

People immediately shouted loudly. When two experts of this level were fighting, everything around them would be annihilated.

They were too close for comfort!

Many of the creatures at the boundary between the continents were instantly annihilated by the powerful shockwaves. They did not even have time to scream.

Fortunately, before the battle, Ye Xuan had intentionally or unintentionally approached the Xuan Continent’s area, which confined the majority of the damage in that region. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Hiss…”

“This battle is so terrifying!”

Both the chiefs and the members of the Great Wilderness Divine sect were in awe. Their Sword Elder was going toe-to-toe with a true immortal!

“Hahaha, Sword Immortal Ye is indeed worthy of his name. His strength is simply unparalleled!”

Once they had reached a safe distance, everyone turned to watch the battle once more. After all, when would they ever be able to witness a battle between experts of this level?

This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!

The outcome of the first clash soon became evident, as the golden-furred growler ancestor staggered backward and spit out a mouthful of blood.

“This… This can’t be happening. Why did I lose?”

At this moment, he still did not believe that he was actually at a disadvantage against this kid.

How humiliating!

After the shockwaves died down, Ye Xuan held the Godsword aloft and walked over to the golden-furred growler ancestor, who was shouting hysterically, “You damned b*stard! How dare you humiliate me!. I definitely won’t let you off!”

The anger in his heart could no longer be extinguished. He had never been humiliated like this in his life, and to see this happen in a low-level world was simply unbearable.

If this matter was known by the people up there, he would never be able to raise his head proudly again.

Thinking this, he once again mobilized the spiritual power in his entire body, as divine runes emerged all over his body. This gave him a significant strength boost.

This made Ye Xuan frown. The sword move he had just used was very powerful and easily suppressed the golden-furred growler ancestor.

However, it did not cause much damage to him at all. After all, his body had incredible defensive properties. This thick layer of golden fur was basically impenetrable, and even if several more experts ganged up on him, he would be able to hold his own.

“Trying to defeat me with your meager strength? Stop daydreaming!”

You won’t even be able to pierce my fur!”

After his strength was amplified by the divine runes, the golden-furred growler ancestor’s confidence grew stronger.

He laughed unrestrainedly, believing that no matter how heaven-defying Ye Xuan was, he could easily deal with him. His eternal realm body gave him endless confidence.

Although Ye Xuan relied on the Godsword and his mysterious divine powers to suppress him, it would not change the final outcome. Once Ye Xuan ran out of spiritual power, victory would be his!

Killing an immortal was no easy feat!

“Oh? Is that really the case?”

Hearing those arrogant words, the corners of Ye Xuan’s mouth curled up slightly and he smiled.

The golden-furred growler ancestor was confused by this. He could tell that Ye Xuan was mocking him, and that was something he could not and would not endure.

“B*stard, I will force you, and your entire sect to apologize for killing my descendant!”

After roaring fiercely, he opened his mouth wide, and that terrifying devouring power made its appearance once more.

There was no comparing the strength of the devouring power released by the little golden-furred growler and the golden-furred growler ancestor. The closest description would be that they were like the difference between heaven and earth.
