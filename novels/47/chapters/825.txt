826 Golden-Furred Growler (Part 1)

Currently, Wu Kong had completely gained the upper hand, forcing the tiger to retreat. His strength grew in tandem with his size, and had thus increased greatly.

Furthermore, augmented by the Golden Invincible Body, his fur was impervious to the tiger’s claws.

His entire body was a weapon. Even if he only relied on his own defensive capabilities and just stood there, he could exhaust the tiger’s strength.

At this moment, the tiger had already been suppressed to the point where its heart was filled with anger.

It refused to believe that, as a descendant of the ancient divine tiger, it was no match for a furry monkey.

“Hahaha, you little tiger, if you have any real skills, then show them to me as soon as possible.”

“Today, I will definitely give you a good taste of our East continent’s power.”

Wu Kong was getting more and more overbearing.

After hearing these words, the tiger became even angrier. It gritted its teeth, but despite how annoying this monkey was, it was unable to do anything about it.

This monkey actually dared to look down upon the experts of the Xuan continent.

Moments later, another voice rang out.

“Hmph! I thought it was some expert, but it’s just a little monkey. How dare you behave so arrogantly! Is this all there is to the East continent, that they have to rely on a puny monkey?”

After hearing these arrogant words, the people of the East continent were enraged.

“Who is this person? How dare he be so arrogant?”

“There are countless experts in the East continent. Why would we let a little monkey represent us?”

In the sky, a golden-furred growler whose entire body was burning with raging flames appeared.

He raised his head high and looked down at Wu Kong.

“It’s actually a golden-furred growler?”

Mu Beichen rubbed his hands together as he said these words.

“I didn’t expect this thing that only existed in ancient records to appear. This is really surprising.”

No one expected that there would be such a rare species in the Xuan continent. Although the golden-furred growler was only a middle-stage heaven realm expert, his noble and rare bloodline meant that he was almost invincible among experts of the same level.

That tiger just now might not even be able to withstand a single blow from the golden-furred growler.

After seeing the golden-furred growler, Zhuge Yueyue also could not wait to fight.

If they did not stand up for themselves today, when the other continents joined together, they might look down on the East continent.

Sensing that Zhuge Yueyue was itching to fight, Ye Xuan turned around and said, “Don’t worry, let’s see how this little monkey will deal with the golden-furred growler.”

After making a rough estimation of the battle strength of the golden-furred growler, Ye Xuan was somewhat surprised. He really did not expect that these creatures from the other continents would be so powerful.

‘Perhaps it’s really like what Yanran said. The East continent lags behind the other continents,’ Ye Xuan thought to himself.

Turning around to look at his disciple, an idea appeared in Ye Xuan’s mind.

It had been a long time since he had performed spiritual power infusion on his disciples. With the imminent reunification of the continents at hand, it would be a lie to say that his disciples did not feel pressure when facing the geniuses from other continents.

After all, they were representing the glory of the East continent.

He had to find a time to perform spiritual power infusion on them.

Seeing that her teacher did not approve of her going out to fight, Zhuge Yueyue could only watch.

She wondered if this monkey could defeat the golden-furred growler, and everyone was watching the battle, as this was also the first time the two continents had a showdown. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Everyone wanted to take a good look at the geniuses of the other continents.

“Haha, this is really interesting. A golden-furred growler against a monkey. What will the outcome be?”

In a certain hidden space, a person spoke to himself. He was also watching the battle.

The golden-furred growler appeared in front of Wu Kong. As it breathed, it caused the wind and clouds to move. Its innate ability was related to the bloodline it possessed.

When he saw the golden-furred growler appear, Wu Kong felt pressured. However, he did not know the meaning of fear, so he immediately roared, “What kind of monster are you? Report your name. I won’t kill an unknown junior like you.”

Hearing this, the golden-furred growler’s hair stood on end, and he stared at Wu Kong with a murderous look.

“Who do you think you are? You’re courting death!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he instantly launched an attack. A red beam of light shot toward Wu Kong at high speed.

Seeing this, Wu Kong panicked and crossed his arms in front of him to block the attack in a hurry.

Boom!

A huge explosion erupted, shattering the mountains nearby.

The first exchange between the two had actually caused such devastating damage.

On the receiving end, Wu Kong rubbed his sore arms. He had cultivated the Invincible Golden Body technique, so why did it suddenly hurt so much?
