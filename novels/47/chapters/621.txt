622 Secluded Cultivation (Part 1)

Not only was Xiao Feng grateful to his teacher, but he was also grateful to Ye Xuan. Had the grudge between the two peaks not been resolved, he would have been left by the wayside and would have had to live out his days as a mediocre cultivator.

“Alright, get up quickly. The gathering is coming soon, so I have to cultivate in seclusion for a few days. You can come with me.”

“I hope that your strength can also improve with this. You can then try to get a good ranking at the gathering.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Gao Shun took Xiao Feng with him to cultivate in seclusion.

!!

Elsewhere, Ye Xuan had already brought Xiang Yun back to Cloud Sky peak. Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun also hurried over. After seeing Ye Xuan’s frown, Zhuge Yueyue asked nervously, “Teacher, why did you bring Third Sister back so quickly? Shouldn’t she be learning how to read in the study hall?”

Ye Xuan did not really know how to answer that question as he looked at Xiang Yun, who was still smiling from ear to ear.

Learn to read?

This little girl was already a dropout!

After waving his hand, Ye Xuan said helplessly, “Yun’er has already beaten up all of the children at the study hall. She even beat up Elder Huang.”

“Therefore, she’s been sent back.”

“Uh…”

Hearing this, Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun were also very helpless.

Before sending her to the study hall, Zhuge Yueyue had explicitly warned Xiang Yun not to cause trouble, but it seemed that her warning had fallen on deaf ears.

At this moment, Feng Xiyun squatted down and asked, “Third Sister, why did you beat everyone up the moment you arrived?”

“They asked for it,” Xiang Yun replied seriously, “They actually wanted me to be their underling. That’s never gonna happen!”

“Hmph! I didn’t even beat him very hard.”

After saying this, she looked at Feng Xiyun and asked very happily, “Second Sister, I’ve already beaten up all of my peers in the study hall. Have I become invincible among my peers?”

“Uh…”

They were at a loss as to what to say. That old man had really led Xiang Yun astray.

Why did he have to tell her such things?

Now, she would rather beat up her peers than make friends with them.

“Teacher, how should we deal with this matter?” Zhuge Yueyue asked worriedly.

After all, this was a very important matter. If Xiang Yun could not even recognize words, how could she cultivate?

Ye Xuan shrugged with a helpless expression. After rolling his eyes, he said, “There’s no other way. Since she’s dropped out, we’ll have to be responsible for her learning.” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“There’s no rush though. After all, she’s still young and doesn’t need to learn how to use divine powers yet.”

“I’ll leave the responsibility of teaching her how to read to you both. If you really can’t teach her, I’ll teach her how to train her body first.”

Hearing this, the two of them agreed. Actually, even if one did not know how to read, they could still train their bodies.

After all, there was no need for a cultivation technique or divine power to do so. All one needed to do was exercise and train.

Ye Xuan wanted Xiang Yun to train her body first so that she could lay a solid foundation for her cultivation in the future.

Although Ye Xuan’s method of training his body was easy, it was also very powerful.

As long as she could train her body well, she would be able to display even more of her extraordinary strength. The one thing it did require was tenacity, as well as a large amount of heavenly treasures. However, the latter was something that Ye Xuan had plenty of.

“Teacher, for the time being, Xiyun and I will teach her. We’ll each take turns taking care of her and teaching her while we cultivate.”

Ye Xuan nodded.

“Alright, I’ll leave it to you guys then.”

“I will have to enter secluded cultivation for a few days. We’ll discuss any other matters after I’m done.”

As soon as he finished speaking, his disciples left, and Ye Xuan entered his cultivation room.

Ever since he planted the water cloud fruit tree on Cloud Sky peak, the spiritual energy here had become more concentrated, which was a boon to anyone cultivating here.

Moments later, Ye Xuan took out the fiery phoenix’s divine bone that he had yet to fully absorb. Since it still contained power, he wanted to finish absorbing it while he was in seclusion.

As for the immortal heavenly treasure, Ye Xuan was not prepared to refine it yet. He wanted to wait until he reached the peak of the supreme realm first. At that time, he would be able to break through to the ancient realm smoothly.

“Does this fiery phoenix divine bone contain enough power to help me reach a breakthrough?” Ye Xuan muttered to himself.

At present, he was still an early-stage supreme realm cultivator. After the various battles, his cultivation foundation had solidified and stabilized. As such, now was the best time to push forward and seek a breakthrough.

Ye Xuan immediately took action, and began to refine the remaining power in the divine bone, causing dense power to fill his body.

“F*ck…”

Ye Xuan was truly shocked. There was still this much left?

Ye Xuan heard crackling sounds all over his body, and he hurriedly activated his cultivation technique to control the power in his body, forcing it to be absorbed slowly.

After a while, things began to calm down, and Ye Xuan regained full control of the situation. As such, Ye Xuan began to push forward with his cultivation.

After some time, Ye Xuan’s body started to emit a dull sound…
