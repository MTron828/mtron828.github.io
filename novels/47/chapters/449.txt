450 You’re Too Weak

When Yu Wuyuan heard this, he frowned and a cold light flashed across the depths of his eyes.

He had wanted to express his elegance, but had not expected Zhuge Yueyue to be so discourteous. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Junior Sister is really anxious. Since that’s the case, I’ll do as you say!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the terrifying aura of a third-level materialization realm expert suddenly erupted. Even the arena trembled slightly.

Yu Wuyuan slowly raised the Flood Dragon Sword in his hand.

“Hahaha! Ye Xuan, do you think my disciple is capable?”

Gao Shun revealed a smug smile.

Ye Xuan simply smiled.

“Mm, not bad indeed. To be able to reach the third level of the materialization realm at such a young age, he must be a disciple that Senior Brother has carefully nurtured, right?”

“Junior Brother’s eyes are truly sharp!”

Gao Shun’s face was filled with pride.

At this moment, an intense battle broke out.

The surging spiritual power in Yu Wuyuan’s body swept out, and the sharp blade of the sword, which could cut through iron like mud, emitted sharp sword qi that flashed toward Zhuge Yueyue.

Seeing this, Zhuge Yueyue’s expression did not change at all. With just a slight movement of her feet, she easily dodged Yu Wuyuan’s attack.

Yu Wuyuan’s sword strike missed and his face instantly turned ashen. Zhuge Yueyue had not even drawn her sword!

“Very good! You have successfully provoked my anger!”

Yu Wuyuan slowly turned around, and his spiritual power surged into the Flood Dragon Sword.

Then, as it shone brightly, an illusory phantom of a huge flood dragon appeared!

“Mm… I didn’t expect Yu Wuyuan to have such high attainments in the Sword Dao…”

“It seems like Cloud Sky peak is going to lose…”

Everyone’s expressions changed when they saw this.

Even the chiefs were startled by this.

Hidden Sword peak was indeed worthy of its title as the number one peak in the Great Wilderness Divine sect. It had many disciples and experts. It seemed that it would not be easy for the other peaks to get a good ranking in the Seven Peaks competition.

Elder Tongtian smiled and said, “Daoist Gao, your disciple has indeed made great strides in the Sword Dao. It seems that he has received your true inheritance!”

“Hahaha!” Gao Shun’s face was full of smiles, “Daoist Tongtian may not know, but Yu Wuyuan is my second disciple. His level of talent is extremely outstanding, especially when it comes to the Sword Dao!”

“Moreover, this kid has also broken through to the third level of the materialization realm at such a young age. Although he can’t be compared to Fellow Daoist Tongtian’s disciple, he’s still a dragon among men to have obtained such strength at such a young age.”

“Hahaha…” Elder Tongtian stroked his beard and smiled. He naturally knew that Gao Shun was full of pride at this moment.

He briefly glanced at Ye Xuan and found that the latter’s expression was calm, without the slightest hint of anxiety.

This puzzled him.

Could it be that Cloud Sky peak’s Zhuge Yueyue was even stronger than Yu Wuyuan?

Thinking this, Elder Tongtian turned his attention to Zhuge Yueyue.

He was very curious about how this girl would deal with this attack.

Right at this moment, a sinister expression appeared on Yu Wuyuan’s face. He then roared in anger, “Flood Dragon Divine Slash!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the bright sword qi emitted by the sword surged into the flood dragon phantom, and it charged toward Zhuge Yueyue with unparalleled momentum.

Zhuge Yueyue simply raised her hand. Until now, she had not even unsheathed the Cloud Sky Sword.

“What is Junior Sister Zhuge trying to do? She’s not even using her weapon against such a terrifying attack?”

“Yu Wuyuan is a third-level materialization realm expert. Isn’t Junior Sister Zhuge being a little too overconfident and careless?”

At this moment, as Zhuge Yueyue slowly lowered her right hand, a surge of powerful sword intent suddenly exploded forth, suppressing Yu Wuyuan’s sword qi with absolute force.

“What…”

Everyone’s expression changed drastically when they saw this.

Although Zhuge Yueyue did not use an artifact, the terrifying sword intent that shot up into the sky was far stronger than Yu Wuyuan’s attack.

Everyone could clearly sense that with her attainments in the Sword Dao, even ten of him would not be a match for her.

“This is unbelievable…”

Then, Zhuge Yueyue struck his body with her own sword qi. Despite his best efforts to block the attack, a few of his ribs were shattered, and he was sent flying to the corner of the arena. His white clothes were already stained with blood.

Yu Wuyuan got back up with great difficulty, his eyes filled with disbelief.

“Sword intent…” Gao Shun cried out involuntarily, the smile on his face suddenly freezing.

That had been Yu Wuyuan’s all-out attack. Not only did it not severely injure Zhuge Yueyue, but it had not even forced her to use the Cloud Sky Sword.

Even Mu Beichen’s expression changed when he saw this.

“Fairy Zhuge’s sword intent is indeed terrifying! The sword qi is bone-piercingly cold and can even attack the soul!”

“Her casual attack had dispersed and overpowered her opponent’s full-power attack. I’m not sure if I could pull it off with such ease.”

At this moment, Mu Beichen began to doubt his own strength.

At this moment, in the arena, Zhuge Yueyue slowly raised her head. The corners of her mouth curved into an arc.

“You… You’re too weak!”

“You’re not even qualified as practice material. Just accept your defeat.”
