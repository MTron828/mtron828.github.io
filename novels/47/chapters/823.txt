824 Playful Provocation

“Sit properly first.”

After gesturing for Wu Kong to sit in front of him, Ye Xuan extended his hand and injected a stream of spiritual power into Wu Kong’s head.

At this moment, Wu Kong saw many golden words appear in his mind.

The complete cultivation technique appeared in his mind, which shocked him tremendously. At this moment, he was no longer the ignorant furry monkey from a month ago.

After this period of cultivation, Ye Xuan even allowed him to read many Dao scriptures, so he had a slight understanding of various cultivation techniques.

He could clearly sense that this divine power seemed to be tailor-made for him and was very suitable.

Therefore, he immediately knelt on both knees and said excitedly, “Thank you, Teacher!”

Ye Xuan shook his head and said, “I hope you can master this divine power that I’m imparting to you. Spend some time comprehending it, and then show me what you can do with it.”

The little furry monkey’s comprehension ability was quite good, so it did not take long to successfully grasp it.

After some time, Wu Kong stood up. After some fiddling about, his body grew several times larger.

“Hehe, interesting, interesting.”

“Gotta get even bigger!”

The little furry monkey was so excited that it started babbling nonsense. He had never expected this Heavenly Transformations technique to be so interesting, so he suddenly became playful again.

In the blink of an eye, the little monkey had grown to a height of several dozen meters. As his body continued to grow, the little monkey could clearly sense that the strength it possessed was increasing at the same time.

“Holy sh*t!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the little monkey’s body had already grown to a height of 100 meters, scaring Ye Xuan.

What was worth mentioning was that this divine power was indeed quite good for scaring people. After all, size was also a form of deterrence.

“Ding! The host has taught his disciple a heaven-grade divine power, Heavenly Transformations, and has received a critical reward from the system…”

It finally appeared!

Hearing the familiar system notification, Ye Xuan’s lips curled up slightly.

“Ding! Congratulations on obtaining a 10,000x critical reward. You have received the immortal-grade divine power, Divine Amplification!”

Ye Xuan stood up immediately when he realized that it was an immortal-grade divine power.

“God’s Amplification?”

The Heavenly Transformations technique could only increase one’s body size and strength, but the Divine Amplification technique was different. It could increase one’s cultivation level!

Furthermore, there were no side effects!

It was truly worthy of its name!

He had really hit the jackpot this time!

Ye Xuan was extremely happy. Even when he looked at the little monkey, he found him particularly pleasing to the eye. With this divine power, he would be able to face his enemies with greater confidence, be it those experts from the other continents, or the mysterious master of the strange realm.

After he was done being happy, Ye Xuan looked at the little monkey. At this moment, who was playing around by continuing to grow and shrink.

However, he suddenly felt that something was wrong. Moments later, he understood why he felt that way.

After the little furry monkey became even larger, his head had already reached deep into the clouds. Once there, he reached out his hand toward a large continent not far away. He grabbed it tightly and tried to shake it non-stop.

“Oh my god!”

“What exactly is going on?”

The people of the other continent were all shocked. They immediately walked out and looked up.

A giant palm appeared in the sky, and then they saw a big monkey head looking at them. It was smiling and shaking the edge of their continent.

Seeing this playful monkey, the experts of this continent were furious.

“You damned monkey, who gave you such guts?”

With a roar, a huge tiger with a crown on its head suddenly appeared.

This tiger was a mystic lord realm expert, and it charged at Wu Kong without hesitation.

Seeing this, Wu Kong was dumbfounded. He could not react in time at all and was somewhat overwhelmed.

His cultivation level was not comparable to this tiger, but thanks to the Heavenly Transformation technique, it was still able to match this tiger.

After being attacked, the little monkey was also burning with anger. He gritted his teeth and said, “You damned cat, how dare you attack me! You’re simply courting death!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he clenched his fist and punched the tiger. The tiger felt a sense of danger, and dodged by a hair’s breadth.

The punch slammed into the ground where it had once stood, creating a huge pit.

Seeing this situation, the group of experts from this part of this continent were furious.

“Damn it, isn’t the East continent openly provoking us?”

“Our two continents have only collided for a few dozen days, and nothing has happened since. However, it seems they are taking the first step to provoke us!”
