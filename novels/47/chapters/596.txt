597 Killing Mo Nan

Everyone from the Great Wilderness Divine sect was familiar with this scene.

After all, this was the attack that Ye Xuan had used to deal with Elder Taiyin.

When he faced Mo Nan, he was actually using the same move again!

The only difference was that he was not using the same sword.

“This aura is really too strong. Even though I’m many miles away, I still feel like I’m being suppressed to the point where it’s hard to breath.”

“Perhaps even an ancient realm expert would find it difficult to deal with Martial Uncle Ye’s attack.”

While the crowd was discussing, Mo Nan’s arrogance had long since vanished, and was replaced by a panicked expression.

“This can’t be happening! I don’t believe it!”

“How did this brat obtain such a powerful divine power?!”

After he shook himself awake, he realized that, from the beginning to the end, Ye Xuan had never used his full strength and had only been teasing him.

At this very moment, he felt as if his dignity had been crushed and pounded mercilessly.

Fury erupted from the bottom of his heart, and Mo Nan pushed the strange power to its limits, becoming even stronger!

“Bring it on!”

“I’ll behead all of you today!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Mo Nan charged at Ye Xuan without hesitation.

A white skill emitting thick black mist condensed and bit at Ye Xuan.

In the sky, Ye Xuan’s expression did not change at all as he gently swung the Godsword, splitting the white skull in half effortlessly.

Meanwhile, Mo Nan staggered and vomited blood several times, falling to the ground.

“Ancestor!”

When they saw their ancestor being beaten to the ground, the Immortal Divine sect cultivators cried out in panic.

If Mo Nan lost, their lives were forfeit.

Some people were already feeling regretful. Why did they choose to become disciples of the Immortal Divine sect? Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Pfft!

After spitting out a few more mouthfuls of blood, Mo Nan slowly crawled out of a deep pit and onto the ground. He could not even stand up. He felt as if all the bones in his body had been shattered by Ye Xuan’s attack.

Not only did that sword harm him physically, but it also attacked his soul!

Even now, he still found it unbelievable. He had already cultivated the demonic body, so why could he not withstand a single attack from Ye Xuan?

At this moment, he felt dispirited.

When he saw how flustered his sect’s disciples were, he let out a deep sigh.

He was unwilling to see the sect’s legacy and existence disappear in front of his very eyes.

Moments later, Ye Xuan slowly floated in front of him and pointed the Godsword at him from a distance. He said with a cold expression, “Old man, have you finally come to your senses now?”

Mo Nan was dejected to hear those words. After all, he had already given his all in today’s battle.

However, in the end, he still failed, and had no chance of winning.

“Hurry up and make your move. I know my own since, and have never hoped to be pardoned.”

“In order to refine the demonic body, I threw away any care for my own life. Even if I were to go to the ninth layer of hell and suffer all kinds of torture, I would not regret it.”

After saying that, Mo Nan even looked relieved.

He believed that the reason why he did this was not to make himself stronger, but to protect the Immortal DIvine sect.

Ye Xuan was still staring at him with a cold gaze. This old man only had himself to blame for this.

He might believe that his actions were justified despite killing countless innocent people, but so what?

It was true that the mystic world where the strong preyed on the weak, and no one would uphold justice for them.

However, this also applied when he was the weaker party. One had to win to be right!

At this moment, Ye Xuan remained silent as he stabbed the Godsword into Mo Nan’s abdomen, which devoured all of the black mist in his body.

The demonic body that Mo Nan had been so proud of could not hinder the Godsword, and was instantly torn apart.

Because of his previous experience with Elder Taiyin, Ye Xuan was not careless, and immediately surged with power again to shatter Mo Nan’s soul, lest he revive with the help of the strange power.

He could not afford to leave behind any seeds of trouble for the future, as it might come back to bite him later on.

At this moment, snowflakes began to fall from the sky. It was a very strange sight.

Ye Xuan’s movements were swift. He pulled the Godsword horizontally, and Mo Nan’s body instantly disintegrated and turned into ashes.

The strange power was also completely devoured by the Godsword.

Even his soul was gone. No matter how powerful the strange power was, it would not be able to save Mo Nan’s life.

After taking care of Mo Nan, Ye Xuan waved his hand and left.

The legs of the Immortal Divine sect cultivators were already trembling…
