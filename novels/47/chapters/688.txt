689 A Harmonious Scene

After all, that matter was between him and Daoist Gu Hao. There was no need to involve Xie Tianyu in it.

“It’s nothing. Let’s return to the sect first. We’ll discuss this matter later.”

Thus, the Supreme Divine sect’s participation in the gathering came to an early end.

After this, everyone turned their attention back to the other duels.

!!

After Zhuge Yueyue successfully cleared the stage, Mu Beichen and the Reincarnation Fairy also defeated their opponents as well.

Some of the other battles were still ongoing.

At this moment, people suddenly noticed that there was no movement at all from behind the seventh door, nor was there any sign of fighting.

Seeing this, everyone was stunned.

“This”

“What exactly is going on? What happened just now?”

Everyone was extremely confused at this moment because the battles behind the other doors were extremely intense and hair-raising. For example, the battle between Zhuge Yueyue and Xie Tianyu.

Mu Beichen and the Reincarnation Fairy also unleashed their strength and defeated their enemies splendidly.

Why and how had things turned out so differently with Xiang Yun?

“Just which sect does that disciple come from?”

“I know him. If I’m not wrong, he’s from the Lingyun sect in Longtian Mountain. His name should be Lin Qiaosheng.”

“Oh? He’s actually from the Lingyun sect?”

After hearing this, everyone immediately turned around and looked at the cultivators from the Lingyun sect.

Seeing everyone looking at him with curious gazes, the sect master was at a loss.

What the f*ck?

Was this how his sect would become famous?

Who could accept becoming famous like this?

Would he have to teach his disciples storytelling in the future?

This damn disciple!

However, after seeing this disciple’s face, the sect master understood that this seemingly harmless little girl was actually the most terrifying one among the competing participants. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Lin Qiaosheng was also cursing at this moment. It was impossible for him to defeat Xiang Yun.

Furthermore, he had been forced to discard his pride and tell her stories to keep her happy. Otherwise, he would have to revisit the torture he had experienced earlier.

Those hammer strikes f*cking hurt!

“Once upon a time, there was a mountain. There was a temple on the mountain. In the temple, there was a group of young monks. They lived a happy life every day”

Lin Qiaosheng really could not think of anything, so he could only make the stories up. Whenever he touched his head from time to time, the pain would flare up again, causing him to wince.

After listening to story after story, Xiang Yun was happily laughing. From time to time, she would urge him, “What’s next? What happened next?”

“Don’t dawdle. Hurry up, or I’ll hit you a few more times.”

Hearing this, Lin Qiaosheng’s face instantly turned pale.

‘F*ck, who taught this little devil? Why was violence her solution to everything? Ugh’

Helpless, Lin Qiaosheng could only continue to make up stories. Moreover, he had to observe her expression at all times, afraid that he would accidentally make her angry.

Fortunately, or unfortunately, Xiang Yun became even more fascinated by his stories. He had already made up ten stories, and was running out of ideas.

Why had she not gotten bored yet?

How did his stupid stories even make sense?

When Lin Qiaosheng mentioned that the temples of these young monks had been destroyed by a monster, Xiang Yun empathized with them.

After all, she had a happy family, but it had been destroyed by a group of monsters.

“And then?”

Xiang Yun wanted to know what happened to these little monks.

“Although the temple was destroyed, these young monks did not give up. They used their hard-working hands to rebuild a taller and bigger temple in its place. They lived a fulfilling and beautiful life again.”

This kind of story really had no actual plot. Even Lin Qiaosheng felt very embarrassed when he made it up. However, it was the best that he could do under the present circumstances.

After listening to this story, Xiang Yun instantly thought of his own encounter and lowered her head.

Then, she suddenly looked at Lin Qiaosheng and said with ill intentions, “Your story is really bad. You deserve to be beaten up!”

‘What the f*ck?’

Lin Qiaosheng was dumbfounded. What kind of logic was this?

“Ah”

After being hit by her hammer again, a few of his teeth flew out.

“Wahhh”

A grown man was actually beaten to tears by a little girl. Moreover, he was crying openly.

How humiliating!

“There’s no justice in life! Someone teach her a lesson! If this continues, I’m going to die”

Lin Qiaosheng shouted hysterically. He really could not hold it in any longer.

...

Everything about this situation was completely unbearable!
