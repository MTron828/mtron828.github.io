861 Heaven Burning Flames

Ao Lei became more and more excited and said firmly, “The Heaven Burning Flames only exists in ancient records, but it is said that it is an immortal-grade cultivation technique. Back then, I was fortunate enough to witness these flames inside an ancient ruin, and it felt like I had descended into the fiery depths of hell!”

After hearing Ao Lei’s words, everyone was taken aback and in disbelief.

However, when they looked at the ball of flames, it truly felt like it had emerged from the depths of hell. If they were struck by it, they would probably have already been incinerated!

Also…

Immortal-grade cultivation technique?

Were their ears deceiving them?

Was Feng Xiyun’s Heaven Burning Flames technique not a heaven-grade cultivation technique? Had Ye Xuan somehow improved it?

How utterly heaven-defying!

Even heaven-grade cultivation techniques were priceless treasures to them, yet Cloud Sky peak seemed to have no shortage of immortal-grade cultivation techniques…

It was unfair! The heavens were unfair! Why was the difference between them so great?

“This is truly unimaginable. If he really gains full control over those flames, who would be able to defeat him?” Ao Lei exclaimed while taking a deep breath. He was extremely excited.

No matter what, the appearance of such a powerful cultivation technique was a boon to the Great Wilderness Divine sect, and would further strengthen the claim of orthodoxy.

No one would dare to dispute their claim after this!

However, there were still burning questions in their minds…

What was going on inside Cloud Sky peak?

Was Elder Qian Yi still alive?

Thanks to the scorching heat, they could not enter the peak, and had to wait anxiously outside.

“Oh my God, this is so infuriating! At least let us know if Elder Qian Yi is still alive!”

After hearing Gao Shen’s anxious words, Yuelun said seriously. “In my opinion, if Junior Brother Ye is really angry, then Elder Qian Yi has almost no chance of surviving. We should start making arrangements now.”

“At the very least, we have to hold a proper funeral for him.”

“I think you’re right, Junior Sister.”

While the other chiefs were discussing the matter, Zhuge Yueyue remained silent. She was extremely flustered. After all, she understood the Heaven Burning Flames the most as this was her second sister’s cultivation technique.

However, her second sister was unable to release the Heaven Burning Flames to such an extent, which meant that it was her teacher’s doing.

Her palms were covered in sweat, and she wanted nothing more than to rush inside to see what was going on in the Cloud Sky Peak.

…

Inside Cloud Sky Palace.

“Teacher, what is going on?”

Feng Xiyun, who had been quietly waiting for her teacher to impart the cultivation technique to her, suddenly noticed that there was something abnormal happening to her teacher.

Her expression changed when she sensed that familiar flames were burning continuously in Ye Xuan’s body. The flames seemed to have the same origin as the flames in her body, and she felt drawn to them.

While Ye Xuan was cultivating the Heaven Burning Flames, Feng Xiyun’s body began to resonate.

“This feeling… How wonderful.”

Snowflakes were falling outside, and a cold wind blew against her face, but why did she still feel so hot? Not long after, Ye Xuan stretched out his right hand, and a familiar ball of flames instantly appeared out of thin air.

“Ah!”

Feng Xiyun was extremely shocked when she noticed the flames. Was this the same Heaven Burning Flames that she cultivated?

When the ball of flames appeared, Feng Xiyun felt that the precious bones in her body pulse in tandem with the rising and falling of the flames.

At the same time, the temperature of her body began to rise rapidly.

“Xiyun, focus!”

At this moment, Ye Xuan finally spoke up. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Feng Xiyun snapped back to her senses after hearing this and refocused herself. Seconds later, Ye Xuan stretched out his hands and pressed them onto Feng Xiyun’s back, transferring the burning flames into her body, along with his insights into the cultivation technique.

As this continued, her skin turned red all of a sudden. She felt that her body was on fire, and it was almost unbearable.

“Stay focused. This cultivation technique is an immortal-grade cultivation technique, and is very profound.”

“With your current level of talent, it’s very difficult for you to master this cultivation technique, so I’ll guide you through each step of the way.”

“You have to memorize the route my spiritual power takes. Wherever my spiritual power goes, you have to follow,” Ye Xuan warned with a serious expression.

Hearing this, Feng Xiyun gritted her teeth. She was aware of her teacher’s hard work in preparing this for her, and was determined not to let his efforts go to waste.

She was extremely grateful. She had not expected Ye Xuan to teach her an immortal-grade cultivation technique this time. It was as he said. If she only relied on herself to master it, the chances of success were zero.

However, in order to better impart the cultivation technique to her, her teacher actually cultivated it himself. Only then could he provide her with the insights necessary for her to grasp the technique. Thinking this, Feng Xiyun’s eyes were filled with tears again. Her teacher was really too good to her.
