Chapter 113: The Grand Elder Of The Qian Gate

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

It was common knowledge that core formation experts were rich. As such, how could Ye Xuan allow such riches to escape his grasp?

Whoosh!

Ye Xuan moved, and his figure suddenly appeared several hundred meters away. Although the five elders from before had long been reduced to ashes, their storage rings were still intact.

Storage rings were forged from extremely rare and sturdy materials. Even with his strength, he could not destroy them.

Moments later, Ye Xuan spread out his spiritual sense, and soon located the storage rings of the five elders.

When he looked into the storage rings, he smiled!

As expected of the storage rings of a top-ranked sect’s elders, they were full of treasures!

Other than one or two elders, who had comparatively less, the rest were quite rich.

After some time, Ye Xuan had completed the plundering of the Xuanyin sect.

“It’s time to take in another disciple!”

Ye Xuan touched his chin and muttered to himself. Then his figure turned into a stream of light and headed toward the Qingyun sect.

Whoosh!

Ye Xuan’s figure flew through the sky rapidly. In the blink of an eye, he crossed a distance of dozens of kilometers.

Not long after, Ye Xuan spotted a familiar figure!

The old king also sensed a familiar aura. When he turned around and saw Ye Xuan, he was shocked.

This guy was so fast! Was he really a peak core formation realm cultivator like himself? Why was there such a difference between them?

Well, apart from having condensed sufficient divine element, Ye Xuan had already met the standards of a unity realm cultivator in other aspects.

When the old king witnessed Ye Xuan’s speed, he knew that if he had tried to escape from Ye Xuan after fighting him, he would not have had the chance to escape.

Ye Xuan glanced at the old king indifferently. He did not slow down, but passed him in an instant and left him in the dust.

Soon, a large gap formed between the two figures.

At this moment, the scrying orb in the old king’s hand flickered with a bright light. He immediately stopped in his tracks and infused his spiritual power into the scrying orb to transmit information.

Hopefully, Li Yan had not acted rashly!

The old king prayed fervently that this was the case.

…

The Qingyun sect,

After the Xuanyin sect’s attack was resolved, everyone finally relaxed. The injured cultivators all returned to their own cultivation abodes to recuperate. Many people were digesting the sword intent that Ye Xuan had displayed!

Everything seemed to be returning to its previous calm state.

However, suddenly, a terrifying aura suddenly descended on the Qingyun sect, shattering the peaceful atmosphere.

An old man in a fiery red robe hovered in the sky. He had fiery red eyes, and powerful energy fluctuations radiated from his body.

Although this aura was deliberately restrained, it still made everyone feel pressured and fearful.

It was because everyone could clearly sense that this newcomer’s power was no weaker than that of the Xuanyin sect’s patriarch. Although this person was still inferior to Elder Ye Xuan, he was an invincible powerhouse to the people present.

Elder Ye Xuan had just left, and another peak core formation realm expert had arrived. Did the heavens want to destroy the Qingyun sect?

Wan Shanhai suppressed the uneasiness in the heart and hurriedly showed himself to speak with this expert. Unexpectedly this person was from the Qian Gate, and he was their grand elder, Li Yan!

The other party was different from the patriarch of the Xuanyin sect. Li Yan was widely recognized as a peak core formation realm expert in the Great Qian Dynasty, and was extremely powerful!

Wan Shanhai had not expected such a terrifying expert to come to the Qingyun sect!

After finding out the identity of the other party, the uneasiness in Wan Shanhai’s heart dissipated significantly. The other party must have come because of Ye Xuan!

He had not expected the Qian Gate to have learned of Ye Xuan’s feat of killing so many top experts of the Xuanyin sect so quickly.

The other party might punish the Qingyun sect, but it would not be to the extent of killing them.

“Is Ye Xuan here?”

Li Yan hovered in the sky. His eyes were filled with indifference as he looked down at the cultivators of the Qingyun sect from above.

“Elder Ye Xuan has already left. We’re not sure where he went,” Wan Shanhai quickly replied.

He was smart enough not to mention that Ye Xuan was heading to the Xuanyin sect to settle the score. After all, if Li Yan got angry because of this, he might attack the Qingyun sect!

Now that Ye Xuan was not present, there was no one here who could deal with Li Yan.

Moreover, Ye Xuan’s attack on the Xuanyin sect was undoubtedly a violation of the rules that the Great Qian royal family and the Qian Gate had jointly established, Therefore, this matter could not be exposed.

“Oh?”

Hearing this, Li Yan sneered.

‘Does Wan Shanhai really think that I am a three-year-old child? How could he hope to hide such a thing from me? Ye Xuan must have gone over to the mysterious dark sect by now, right?’

However, he was not anxious at all. With the old king overseeing matters at the Xuanyin sect, what could Ye Xuan do?

Then, he thought about the reports of Ye Xuan’s achievements. He was still very doubtful of the veracity of the information he had received.

Had Ye Xuan really reached the peak of the core formation realm? How could a 20-year-old young man do so much? It was too unbelievable!

There had to be a problem with the information! RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Could it be that an unknown force had interfered in the battle between the Qingyun sect and the Xuanyin sect?

“Ye Xuan… has he reached the peak of the core formation realm?”

“Also, has the patriarch of the Xuanyin sect reached the peak of the core formation realm? Did the patriarch and elders of the Xuanyin sect really die at the hands of Ye Xuan?”

Li Yan asked the three most crucial questions immediately.

He wanted to see how Wan Shanhai would answer them.

As the sect leader of the Qingyun sect, Wan Shanhai naturally knew the truth. He wanted to use Wan Shanhai’s words to verify whether the information he had received was true or not.

Wan Shanhai was just a true core realm cultivator. He would not dare to lie in front of him.

“Uh…”

Wan Shanhai hesitated and did not know how to answer.

If he admitted it, would that not prove that Ye Xuan had killed a top-ranked sect’s patriarch and leader? At that time, Ye Xuan and the Qingyun sect would be targeted by the Great Qian royal family and the Qian Gate.

However, if he denied it, would that be equivalent to deceiving them? When they found out later, the result would be pretty much the same.

Besides, Wan Shanhai did not want to deny it. Ye Xuan’s achievements were also the pride of the Qingyun sect.

Moreover, Ye Xuan was really strong now, so why did he need to bow down to others?

“Hmm? Wan Shanhai, answer my question! Otherwise…”

As soon as he finished speaking, Li Yan snorted coldly, and his terrifying spiritual pressure engulfed Wan Shanhai.

Sensing this, Wan Shanhai’s expression changed!

After Yue and Li Qingyan, who were in the crowd, sensed this terrifying pressure, two jade tokens suddenly appeared in their hands.

If Li Yan really dared to make a move against the Qingyun sect, they would crush the jade tokens without hesitation!
