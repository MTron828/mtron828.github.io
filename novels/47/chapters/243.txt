Chapter 244: Does This Guy Still Have A Trump Card?

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“How is this possible?”

“You actually have other fused martial intents?”

Qian Daoliu looked at Ye Xuan in shock.

In the past month, Ye Xuan’s strongest attack was undoubtedly the fusion of the fire, sword, and wood intents, which was what allowed him to fight Qian Daoliu.

However, he had now displayed a second triple intent fusion, which was the fusion of sword, heavenly lightning and wind intent.

How did this guy do it? Why did it seem so easy for him?

The power of this triple intent fusion was extremely terrifying. Just a single sword strike had heavily injured Qian Daoliu, and the destructive power of heavenly lightning was preventing him from recovering.

Zhu Tuyuan felt even more despair upon seeing this.

“Don’t kill me! Don’t kill me!”

When he saw Ye Xuan’s figure disappear, Zhu Tuyuan was completely flustered.

However, no matter how he struggled, he could not change the result.

Another sword qi containing triple intent fusion burst forth!

“Ye Xuan!” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Zhu Tuyuan’s despairing roar reverberated through the sky.

Buzzzzzz!

In just a few seconds, the black mist giant dissipated and disappeared entirely.

However, even though the black mist giant had been completely destroyed, Zhu Tuyuan’s soul still remained.

He silently sneaked into the depths of the chaotic space, trying to escape Ye Xuan’s notice.

However, he was destined to fail.

The azure divine sword was swung down, and the sword strike devoured Zhu Tuyuan’s soul.

An expert of a generation, the master of the Nether God sect, Zhu Tuyuan, had fallen!

“Ye Xuan!”

At this time, Qian Daoliu finally finished healing his injuries.

When he discovered that Zhu Tuyuan’s aura had completely disappeared, his eyes were filled with a monstrous rage.

“Qian Daoliu, it’s your turn!”

Ye Xuan slowly turned around, his gaze landing on Qian Daoliu.

Although his fusion of sword, heavenly lightning and wind intents could indeed seriously injure Qian Daoliu, he would need something more powerful to kill him.

Therefore, Ye Xuan decided to use his strongest power.

Quadruple intent fusion!

Sword, fire, heavenly lightning, and wind intents!

This was his most powerful sword attack.

When he was in secluded cultivation earlier, he had used the epiphany experience to comprehend this attack. However, with his current level of strength, he could only use it twice.

“Ye Xuan! You’ve truly surprised me. However, you won’t be able to kill me!”

He had never thought that he would be beaten into such a sorry state by a mere tenth-level unity realm expert, even if this was just his clone.

Ye Xuan looked at Qian Daoliu expressionlessly, and then slowly raised the azure divine sword in his hand.

The power of the quadruple intent fusion spread out.

“What?”

Qian Daoliu saw this and immediately frowned. He actually felt a life-threatening danger from this sword attack.

“How is this possible?”

Jun Lingtian and Zhao Yuzhen’s expressions changed drastically. The power of this sword strike seemed to far exceed the previous one.

Was this guy still hiding a stronger trump card?

Qian Daoliu’s eyes could not help but widen in shock.

Could this be quadruple intent fusion? How was this possible? How could this guy’s comprehension ability be so freakish?

How was he able to find the point of balance between four martial intents?

At this moment, Qian Daoliu was no longer calm. This threat to his life caused his body to tremble uncontrollably.

Buzzzzzz!

Qian daoliu’s body turned into endless strands of blood qi, condensing into transparent blood-colored droplets.

“Ye Xuan!”

“You’re really strong! You managed to force me to use my trump card. You should be proud of yourself!”

Moments later, the countless blood-colored droplets in the chaotic space suddenly shot out everywhere.
