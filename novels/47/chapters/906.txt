907 My Answer

Ye Xuan had used a completion chance to restore the Godsword to its peak, and the outcome had not disappointed him.

Originally, he had thought that it would be an immortal-grade sword, but it turned out to be a chaos-grade sword!

As such, the Godsword was now his strongest weapon.

After fiddling with the Godsword in his hand for a moment, Ye Xuan said indifferently, “Anything is possible.”

“Since you know about this sword, I won’t say anything more. Today, this sword has returned, and you will become its first meal.”

As soon as he finished speaking, cold sweat instantly broke out on Shan Ling’s forehead. His eyes stared straight in Ye Xuan’s direction, fully focused and vigilant.

“Do you really want to be my enemy?”

Until now, he still refused to give in and threatened, “Do you understand how terrifying the lightning tiger clan is in the Heavenly Dao World?”

“If you offend our clan, when you come to the Heavenly Dao World, you will be hunted down! Do you understand?”

After saying these words, Shan Ling stared at Ye Xuan. However, there was not the slightest bit of hesitation or fear on his face, so Shan Ling quickly continued, “Young man, you’ve already reached the sealed immortal realm at your current age, so it’s obvious that you are shockingly talented.”

“However, you have to be clear that the sealed immortal realm is not the end. It’s just a starting point. If you want to advance further, you have to be wary not to let things like this drag you down.”

After saying this, seeing that Ye Xuan remained silent, Shan Ling began to believe that his words were effective.

“Hahaha! Seeing that you are so talented, I want to invite you to join me. The lightning tiger clan will definitely nurture you well in the future.”

“Under the protection of our clan, when you arrive at the Heavenly Dao World in the future, you will be able to roam the world effortlessly.”

“What do you think? Think about it seriously.”

After saying this, Shan Ling looked at the Godsword in Ye Xuan’s hand with eyes filled with desire, but no one noticed it.

At this moment, when people heard Shan Ling try to recruit Ye Xuan, their hearts trembled. An invitation from a powerful force like that was not something that any ordinary person could ignore.

At this moment, Yanran looked at Ye Xuan with a complicated expression. She was absolutely unwilling to see her sweetheart do such an ignoble thing.

It looked like Shan Ling was trying to rope Ye Xuan in, but in reality, he just wanted Ye Xuan to become a servant of the lightning tiger clan.

Yanran did not make a sound at this moment and quietly watched. She did not believe that Ye Xuan would capitulate.

After a moment of silence, Ye Xuan raised his head to look at Shan Ling. The corners of his mouth curled up slightly as he spoke.

“Are you done?”

Hearing this, Shan Ling’s fur stood on end and it immediately took a few steps back.

“What do you mean by that?”

Shan Ling was very confused. Did this guy really want to be his enemy?

“Do you really not understand how powerful I am in the Heavenly Dao World? In this world, countless geniuses can only dream of joining my clan, yet I will never give them the chance.”

“Are you going to let this chance slip by?”

Shan Ling said with a cold expression. However, Ye Xuan did not want to waste his breath talking any more. He raised the Godsword aloft and unleashed a slash!

Ye Xuan did not stop there. He hurled the Godsword into the air, as it spiraled and created a whirlwind of sword qi.

Then, he charged forward!

Boom!

A huge explosion sounded, and the entire world trembled. Blood-colored raindrops kept falling from the sky.

“This… What move is this?”

The expressions of everyone present changed drastically. They could sense the inexorable pull of the abyss from this move, and felt that they were no longer in control of those lives.

It almost seemed like this sword strike would split the world apart.

“Immortal-grade technique…”

Yanran muttered to herself. Her face had turned pale. She was shocked that Ye Xuan could actually unleash such a shocking sword technique. However, she was happy for him. Ye Xuan was indeed worthy of being her man.

He did not yield to Shan Ling, and he responded in the most overbearing way.

Under this blood-red sky, space began to distort and twist inch by inch.

At this moment, Shan Ling was trapped within, and it was as if he had been mired in a quicksand pit that he could not get out of.

“Argh!”

He roared as he unleashed all of his strength to resist Ye Xuan’s sword strike and break free. With a huge explosion, the East Sea nearly imploded, sending pillars of water sky high!

However, Shan Ling could clearly sense that the danger had not abated, and the sky was still blood-red. At this moment, he was truly afraid. This was quite possibly the most powerful and profound sword move he had ever seen.

While he panicked, Ye Xuan approached, and then swept past his body in the blink of an eye. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com
