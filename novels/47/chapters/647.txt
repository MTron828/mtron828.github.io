648 The Ancestors Arrive

Daoist Canghai felt that this scene was too similar to the battle between him and Chief Tian Xuan. That year, he had lost miserably…

The fear he felt grew, but Daoist Canghai refused to give up. After all, the battle had not started yet, so it was still uncertain who would win.

Just as they were discussing things, another group of people appeared and landed in the empty space to the left of Daoist Canghai.

At the forefront was an old man in a black robe. He looked like a sage and smiled hypocritically at the two Daoists.

“It’s been a long time since we last met. I’ve missed you so much.”

The two of them turned around and looked at him in unison. Daoist Xu Yun was the first to speak. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Hehe, I was wondering who it was. So it’s Gu Hao from the Supreme Divine sect. I didn’t expect you to still be alive.”

This man was also from the same era as Daoist Canghai and Daoist Xu Yun.

Daoist Xu Yun’s eccentric words made Daoist Gu Hao so angry that his beard started trembling.

He and Daoist Xu Yun had been fighting for a lifetime and neither of them was willing to give in to the other. It was already good enough that they did not immediately start fighting right there and then.

Gu Hao’s face darkened and he immediately retorted, “Haha, Daoist Xu Yun, you sure know how to joke. Aren’t you still alive and well? I won’t die before you do.”

As soon as he finished speaking, the Daoist Gu Hao crossed his legs.

At this moment, the ancestors of three major forces had arrived, causing the place to quieten down. No one dared to discuss things too loudly.

To ordinary disciples like them, these experts were legendary existences. Today was the first time they had seen their true faces. As a result, they were like fans at an idol meetup.

The three experts did not continue to talk after sitting down, and simply waited quietly.

At the same time, the number of people at the foot of the mountain began to increase. So far, some forces from the Supreme Divine sect, the Tianxia Academy, the Jade Lake Divine sect, and the Heavenly Mountain Divine sect had all appeared, among others.

Even the forces from the more remote areas gradually rushed over, as well as some forces that had remained hidden for countless years.

After a while, the group from the Great Wilderness Divine sect also arrived.

The first to arrive was Ao Lei.

Unfortunately, Yi Feng had opted not to come. As the oldest figure in the Great Wilderness Divine sect, Yi Feng was no longer bothered about the gathering, especially now that Ye Xuan was around and could bring the sect to greater heights.

It was for this reason that he did not come out of seclusion this time and decided to continue cultivating.

Seeing that Ao Lei had arrived, Elder Tongtian and Chu Tianba went up to greet him.

“Brother Ao, you’ve finally made it. I’ve been waiting for you.”

Chu Tianba’s face was full of smiles. It had been a hundred years since they last met.

He could not help but sigh with emotion. Time passed quickly, and age had caught up to them.

The unyielding spirit from his youth had long disappeared, replaced by the kindness and geniality of an old man.

“Haha, Brother Chu, it’s great to meet you today.”

As they were old friends, they chatted for a while before Ao Lei finally went over to greet the ancestors.

“Greetings, Daoist Canghai and Daoist Xu Yun.”

Ao Lei did not even hesitate to ignore Daoist Gu Hao.

Daoist Canghai smiled, and Daoist Xu Yun also nodded toward Ao Lei. Both laughed inwardly at Daoist Gu Hao being snubbed.

Then Daoist Xu Yun suddenly recalled something and asked, “Ao Lei, did your martial uncle Yi Feng not come?”

Hearing this, Ao Lei laughed and replied, “Yes, he’s currently at a critical moment in his secluded cultivation, so he didn’t come this time. I hope that you won’t blame him for this.”

Daoist Canghai laughed heartily. “Yi Feng is still obsessed with cultivation? I can’t believe he missed such a grand event.”

“Yeah,” Daoist Xu Yun said with a smile, “It seems he no longer has an interest in these things.”

“If I remember correctly, he used to say that a man should travel all over the world. He’s going against his own words now and is busy cultivating in seclusion.”

Upon hearing this, Ao Lei stood quietly on the spot. He was actually very clear about what had happened to Yi Feng.

A long time ago, Yi Feng had encountered some problems and felt extremely guilty. That was why he had sealed himself in that secret chamber and never showed himself again.

On the path of cultivation, everyone would encounter different things, and would have various regrets. If these regrets became an obsession, then they would harm the cultivator’s progress.

Yi Feng was an extraordinary expert, but he was still attached to the mortal world. He was in the Great Wilderness Divine sect, but his heart was not.

He was once a peerless genius, and even had the potential to surpass Chief Tian Xuan. However, after that incident, he was stuck at the early-stage of the Supreme realm, unable to make any further progress.

“Sigh…”

Ao Lei waved his hand after letting out a deep sigh. Chief Tian Xuan had also interfered in the matter that Yi Feng had encountered, but he was still unable to resolve it.

Just as Ao Lei was about to turn around and leave, an angry voice was heard.

“Ao Lei, you brat! Are you blind? Don’t you see me here?”

At this moment, Daoist Gu Hao could not hold it in anymore. The three of them were all top experts of the same era, yet Ao Lei had only paid his respects to Daoist Canghai and Daoist Xu Yun. Could it be that the Supreme Divine sect was being ignored?

The atmosphere immediately turned heavy.

Ao Lei just smiled, turned around and said, “Eh… I’m so sorry, I didn’t see that Daoist Gu Hao was here too. I’ve been disrespectful, this is indeed my fault.”
