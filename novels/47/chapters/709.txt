Thank you readers!

After hearing Zhuge Yueyue’s words, Xiang Yun did not continue making a fuss.

There were many things that she did not know, but she knew that her teacher was doing all these things for her sake.

Seeing that Xiang Yun had finally calmed down, Ye Xuan chuckled. It seemed that his words were very good at tugging at his disciples’ heartstrings.

“Ding! The host has given his disciple, Xiang Yun, an ancient golden crystal. The host has received a 10,000x critical reward!”

He had not even held the crystal for a minute, yet somehow the system had accepted the fact that he was the owner of the golden crystal.

Would he be able to do this with other things in the future?

Although Ye Xuan still looked very calm, he was so happy that he wanted to jump up and down.

“Ding! Congratulations, the host has obtained an ancient purple crystal from the critical reward.”

Eh?

A purple crystal?

He was unsure what the difference in color represented, but since it was a 10,000x critical reward, it would definitely be superior to the golden crystal.

At this moment, Ye Xuan’s heart was full of joy, and even the corners of his mouth had curled up unconsciously.

However, at this moment, Xiang Yun, who had been silent all this while, seemed to have recalled something and spoke bluntly, “Teacher, although I don’t know much, I know that not long ago, you mentioned to us that if you want to reach the next realm, you only need an opportunity.”

“Coincidentally, this crystal might be able to help you, yet you’re unwilling to accept it. In that case, what kind of treasure can help you?”

As soon as she finished speaking, everyone was gobsmacked. Ye Xuan was on the verge of breaking through to the next realm?

How was this possible?

How long had it even been since Ye Xuan had reached the supreme realm?

All of the members of the Great Wilderness Divine sect were dumbfounded, and the outsiders were even more so. Xiang Yun’s words were like throwing a bomb into a calm lake.

“Is this true? Sword Immortal Ye is still so young, yet he’s actually about to reach the ancient realm?”

If Ye Xuan really could break through, he would be the first in the East continent, and his status as the number one expert in the East continent would be cemented. He would even surpass the experts of the older generation, like his teacher, Tian Xuan.

“Unfathomable, it’s simply unfathomable”

“A peerless expert has appeared in our Great Wilderness Divine sect.”

Ao Lei was already dancing excitedly like a child.

However, it was a pity that Ye Xuan would not accept the crystal from Xiang Yun, so he would probably have to wait for another opportunity for his breakthrough.

Then, out of the blue, Ye Xuan suddenly took out a crystal that was emitting purple light.

“Little girl, you don’t need to worry about these things. I will just use this purple crystal.”

At this moment, there was deathly silence

And then all hell broke loose!

“F*ck! I was wondering why he wasn’t interested in the golden crystal. It turns out that he actually has a better crystal!”

“What was the point of all those words earlier then? Was it all an act?”

“I really have to give it to him. Fine! Show off your fancy treasure! I’m not gonna look at it! Let’s just leave!”

At this moment, the purple crystal in Ye Xuan’s hand released an extremely powerful aura, and the purple light it emitted expanded to a radius of a thousand meters.

Even Gao Shun could not help but chime in with his two cents.

“I really have to hand it to you, Junior Brother. I was feeling bad for you at first, but it seems my sympathy was wasted. This purple crystal probably contains a hundred times more power than the golden one, right?”

“If you really refine it, then wouldn’t breaking through be a simple matter?”

Ao Lei had also gotten closer to take a good look at the crystal.

“Hahaha! Junior Brother Ye is always like this! Everything he does is so shocking.”

“Whether it’s his divine powers, divine swords, and even now this purple crystal He truly is one-of-a-kind!”

That being said, everyone was very puzzled. Where did Ye Xuan obtain this purple crystal?

Were crystals like this produced in other places in the East continent? Would they not have known about such a place? What other opportunities had they not discovered in the East continent? Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Ye Xuan had not participated in the gathering, so he definitely had not gotten it from there

At this moment, Xiang Yun was right next to the purple crystal, examining it closely. When she discovered that it actually contained more power than her crystal, her face instantly blossomed with a smile.

“This is awesome! Teacher’s purple crystal is much stronger than the one I just got!”

Seeing her jump up in excitement, Ye Xuan rubbed her little head and said, “Yun’er, you don’t have to worry about me. I actually have quite a lot of treasures.”
