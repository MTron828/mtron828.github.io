419 The Compensation

“I heard that Su Changhe is a very filial kid. Tell me, is this true?”

Ye Xuan looked at Su Tiansheng.

Su Changhe’s heart almost beat out of his mouth when he heard those words. He was extremely nervous.

‘Father, please don’t ruin your precious son. I’m very filial.’

“Hahaha! Thankfully Changhe has taken Chief Ye Xuan’s teachings to heart. He has indeed become much more sensible and filial.”

Su Tiansheng naturally understood what Ye Xuan was implying and said with a smile.

“That’s good!” Ye Xuan nodded in satisfaction.

At this moment, the few figures on the tall building flew over.

“Mu Beichen from the Heavenly Mountain Divine sect greets Chief Ye Xuan!”

“Reincarnation Fairy from the Jade Lake Divine sect greets Chief Ye Xuan!”

“Xu Changqing of Tianxia Academy greets Chief Ye Xuan!”

Ye Xuan was a little stunned by this.

What were these people trying to do? What did they want from him?

At this moment, Zhuge Yueyue whispered, “Teacher, Mu Beichen helped us when we were in trouble.”

“Oh?”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan’s eyes twitched slightly, and then he looked deeply at Mu Beichen.

Moments later, Ye Xuan’s heart trembled.

‘He was born with a Dao body! This guy actually has an innate Dao body!’

Ye Xuan was surprised to see this.

In the past 100 years, although his cultivation had not improved much, he had heard news about the young and peerless geniuses of the East continent.

Among them, Mu Beichen was especially prominent. He was even touted to have the potential to become a sealed immortal realm expert by the Heavenly Mountain Divine sect.

He then turned to look at the Reincarnation Fairy and Xu Changqing. The latter’s talent was a little lacking compared to the former. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“You must be the Mu family’s Saint, Mu Beichen?”

“I’ve heard of your name before. Seeing you now, the rumors are indeed true. You’re really young and have a promising future.”

“Hahaha! Chief Ye Xuan really knows how to joke. Compared to Chief Ye Xuan’s feats, what does my little achievement count for?”

Mu Beichen said humbly.

The terrifying sword qi that Ye Xuan had released just now had indeed amazed him.

This was the domineering sword qi that he had been pursuing. Unfortunately, the Heavenly Mountain Divine sect did not have such a terrifying sword technique.

However, if he could make friends with Ye Xuan, perhaps he might obtain an unexpected harvest.

“Chief Ye Xuan’s sword technique just now was really amazing. I’ve never seen such a terrifying sword qi. I’m very impressed!”

However, in the face of such praise, Ye Xuan remained unperturbed.

“Your talent in cultivation is extremely outstanding, and you’re also a genius in the art of the sword. As long as you stick to your original heart, your future is limitless,” Ye Xuan said with a smile.

Hearing this, Mu Beichen briefly pondered this matter.

It was a great honor to be praised by a mystic lord realm expert.

“Thank you for your praise, Chief Ye Xuan. I’ll definitely take your words to heart.”

Ye Xuan displayed a satisfied expression when he heard Mu Beichen.

This Mu Beichen was not only born with a Dao body, but he also had a good character. He was indeed a rare talent.

Innate Dao bodies were even stronger than divine bones, and bestowed upon the cultivator monstrous talent.

Unfortunately, such a talented person was not his disciple, and nor could he poach the Saint of another sect so wilfully. It was the same for the Reincarnation Fairy.

Just then, Ye Xuan’s gaze fell on the guardians behind Mu Beichen and the Reincarnation Fairy.

Seeing this, Situ Mo walked out with a smile.

“I’m Situ Mo, the law enforcement elder of the Jade Lake Divine sect. I was really amazed by Fellow Daoist Ye Xuan’s display of strength just now.”

“So it’s Elder Situ. Nice to meet you.”

Ye Xuan nodded politely.

Although he was powerful now, his ego had not swelled to the point where he believed himself to be invincible.

Moreover, if he wanted to do well in the East Continent, it would be better to make more friends.

Ye Xuan and Situ Mo chatted for a while.

Right at this time, Gao Shun also finished hearing Lin Youming’s explanation of the course of events, and walked over with an ugly expression.

Were it not for the fact that the Lin family could still bring him many benefits in the future, he would have killed Lin Youming right there and then.

Still, no matter what, the problem in front of him had to be solved.

“Junior Brother Ye, I’ve already gained a rough understanding of what happened.”

“On behalf of the Lin family, I want to first apologize to the two martial nieces,” Gao Shun said sincerely.

Feng Xiyun and Zhuge Yueyue hurriedly returned the greeting when they heard this.

No matter what, Gao Shun was also a chief of the sect. They had to maintain their protocol and respect.

“How about this, Junior Brother Ye? I have the top-grade earth-rank magic artifact, the flaming red caltrop, as well as the top-grade earth-rank artifact, ice-snow armor, as well as some top-grade medicinal pills. I’ll give them to you as a token of apology.”

“I hope you can spare the Lin family for my sake this one time.”

Gao Shun looked at Ye Xuan with a face full of sincerity. This was already the greatest price he could pay.
