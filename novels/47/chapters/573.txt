Chapter 574 – 574 A Mountain Of Gold (Part 2)

574 A Mountain Of Gold (Part 2)

As a princess, Feng Xiyun did not really understand the concept of money, and even wanted to hand over her share to Zhuge Yueyue to manage.

However, Zhuge Yueyue would not allow that, so she still got half of the amount, which was about six thousand taels.

“Ding! Congratulations! The host has given his disciples 12,000 taels of profound gold. The host has obtained a 10,000x critical reward…”

“Congratulations, the host has received 120 million taels of profound gold!”

!!

Hu…

120 million taels of profound gold!

After hearing the system notification, Ye Xuan was overjoyed. This was an enormous sum of money!

He was now a member of the nouveau riche! He could buy whatever he wanted!

Should he renovate the residences on Cloud Sky peak?

Should he go on a spending spree at an auction?

The possibilities were endless!

It only took a short while for the 120 million taels of profound gold to be transferred into his storage space.

Seeing the small mountain of profound gold, Ye Xuan’s heart beat wildly. He could not wait to start spending it.

To be honest, while 120 million taels of profound gold was indeed a lot, if he were to start buying precious treasures and artifacts, it would not last very long.

In addition, alchemy required start-up capital. Those herbs and furnaces would not fall from the sky. Therefore, he still had to watch his spending. At least for now.

The reason why he had asked Han Sikong if he could sell some of the treasures he possessed was to earn more money. After all, he had obtained plenty of treasures in the ancient tomb, and many of them were useless to both him and his disciples, so he might as well sell them.

However, before auctioning them off, he still had to see what other system rewards he could obtain by giving them to his disciples. The original item might be useless, but the system’s reward would likely be something useful.

Ye Xuan had already made a plan for this, and he knew very well which items he could or could not sell.

Moreover, if he bought some stuff from the auction and gave them to his disciples, he would be able to reap even better rewards. Was that not simply wonderful?

Thinking this, Ye Xuan looked at his two disciples again and said, “My dear disciples, show me what you obtained from the ancient tomb.”

After hearing this, the two girls were instantly invigorated. Zhuge Yueyue was the first to speak.

“Teacher, I was quite lucky in the ancient tomb this time. I was able to obtain an imperial sword of good quality.”

As soon as she finished speaking, Zhuge Yueyue slowly took out a sword. However, Ye Xuan could not help but frown when he saw it.

The killing intent contained within this sword was simply too dense. If it was used over long periods of time, it would not be good for its user.

However, this was not a big deal. Ye Xuan gently brushed his hand over the sword and instantly wiped away the evil intent mixed within the sword, leaving behind only pure killing intent.

After examining it carefully again, Ye Xuan returned it to Zhuge Yueyue and said, “This sword is quite good, and is suitable for you to use at this level. It should be able to help you to deal with enemies of the same level.”

Hearing this, Zhuge Yueyue felt very happy. If her teacher said so, then the treasure was worth the trip to the ancient tomb.

“Xiyun, what did you gain?”

Ye Xuan looked at Feng Xiyun and asked. She smiled and took out a wind chime from her storage space.

Ye Xuan picked it up and examined it carefully. He found that although it was a good quality treasure, it was not an imperial treasure. Still, it was quite good. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

After returning the wind chime to Feng Xiyun, Ye Xuan began to think carefully.

During this trip to the ancient tomb, Zhuge Yueyue’s overall gains seemed to surpass Feng Xiyun’s. However, in terms of cultivation, Feng Xiyun’s improvement was faster.

Feng Xiyun’s strength had already reached the peak of the materialization realm. When she left Cloud Sky peak, she had only just entered the materialization realm.

From the looks of it, Feng Xiyun should have obtained some other treasures that helped her increase her cultivation level within the ancient tomb.

Zhuge Yueyue had reached the middle-stage of the void realm, which was higher compared to the early-stage void realm cultivation that she had before she left Cloud Sky peak.

Even though her improvement was not as fast as Feng Xiyun’s, it was much faster than most other cultivators. She had basically almost caught up with Hua Rufeng, who had been cultivating for far longer than she had.

After checking the harvest of his two disciples, ye Xuan also smiled in relief.

‘They did well.’

After a moment’s deliberation, Ye Xian took out the Godsaber he had obtained after killing the white-browed old man.

The Godsaber was short and sharp, and its power could not be underestimated. Even Ye Xuan had almost been injured by it.

“Xiyun, you don’t have a suitable weapon to wield, so I’ll give you this Godsaber.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan handed it to her.

Feng Xiyun was stunned. The moment she touched the Godsaber, she could sense the extremely dense killing intent within it.

In terms of quality, this Godsaber was even comparable to Zhuge Yueyue’s imperial sword.

“Teacher…”

At this moment, Feng Xiyun was already at a loss for words. However, Ye Xuan continued to strike while the iron was hot and said, “Alright, alright, there’s no need to say anything more. Just take what I give you. Why are you being so polite? Since I’ve already given it to you, I must have thought things through.”

“Yueyue already has the imperial sword, and the Cloud Sky Sword, but you don’t have a proper weapon yet.”

“Both of you are precious to me. I will not be biased. Take this Godsaber and use it well.”
