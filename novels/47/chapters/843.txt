844 Heavenly Stairway

Seeing Ye Xuan return, Ao Lei immediately went forward to ask, “Junior Brother Ye, do you know what just happened?”

Ye Xuan shook his hand. He was also unsure of what had happened.

Perhaps only some extremely ancient figures could understand such a scene. Unfortunately, their most senior expert, Daoist Yi Feng, had already passed away. Otherwise, they might be able to glean some clues about this situation.

When the golden light shone down, the entire land became filled with life force, as if heralding the dawn of a golden age. After some time, the eight continents completely fused together. Then, more golden light appeared, and a golden staircase appeared within the light.

After looking at the staircase, everyone’s jaws dropped.

“Oh my god! The Heavenly Stairway actually appeared!”

No one had expected that the moment the eight continents were unified, the Heavenly Stairway would actually appear in this world.

When the Heavenly Stairway appeared, it symbolized that the battle for the immortal path was about to begin. It also symbolized that a fierce battle was about to occur.

Only by becoming the victor here could one obtain the opportunity to perfect one’s Dao and become a true immortal. Ye Xuan’s expression also changed drastically.

Turning around to look at his own disciples, Ye Xuan was already thinking how he should give them some motivation.

After all, Ye Xuan did not need to cross the Heavenly Stairway to become a true immortal. However, his two disciples were different. The two of them could not compare to other top geniuses in terms of their strength. Xiang Yun was only an exception.

Therefore, if they failed to seize this opportunity, they would not have the chance to perfect their Dao. The Heavenly Stairway gave everyone a fair chance. If they persevered and fought bravely against various geniuses to be the winner, they could also succeed in perfecting their Dao.

Ye Xuan glanced at the various continents, but remained silent.

From the conflict between the East continent and the Xuan continent, it was clear that there were many geniuses in the other continents.

‘Haha, in that case, I’ll have to put in some effort.’

The corners of Ye Xuan’s mouth curled up into a smile. The appearance of the Heavenly Stairs was almost like a sign for him to start reaping rewards from the system.

“Hehe, the Heavenly Stairway has already appeared. Let’s wait and see who will emerge as the final victor.”

In the sky, an old man stroked his beard happily and said these words.

Meanwhile, among the other forces, many people smiled at the same time.

Although the battle for the immortal path had not truly begun, undercurrents were already starting to emerge.

At this moment, Ye Xuan could clearly sense that there were already quite a number of people paying attention to his two disciples. Obviously, when Zhuge Yueyue displayed that sword move, she had become a target for the top geniuses of the other continents.

Zhuge Yueyue also noticed these gazes and became nervous.

“Teacher…”

Just as she was about to continue, Ye Xuan waved his hand and said, “Don’t worry, I’m here.”

After comforting Zhuge Yueyue, Ye Xuan suddenly thought of the little monkey and came up with a wonderful idea.

He might have to take on the identity of Daoist Ling again…

“Everyone, hurry up and head back to focus on your cultivation. The battle for the immortal path will soon begin!”

After saying this, Ye Xuan swept his gaze across the crowd and brought his two disciples back to Cloud Sky peak.

After the appearance of the Heavenly Stairway, the atmosphere became much more solemn. On the surface, the world still looked calm, but in the dark, the situation had already become turbulent, as people desperately started accumulating strength.

These forces were surprisingly generous at this time. In order to nurture a peerless genius, they had emptied their coffers.

At this moment, they wanted to take a gamble. If their geniuses emerged victorious, then their entire force would quickly prosper.

Ao Lei was also aware of this. Thankfully, the Great Wilderness Divine sect had just recruited many talented disciples. Therefore, if they nurtured them properly, the sect’s chances to shine at the Heavenly Stairway would increase tremendously.

All of the forces in the eight continents began to act in full swing. Every disciple was cultivating desperately.

At this moment, a portion of the genius disciples who had yet to reveal their talents did so.

A golden age was about to arrive…

On the other side, in the strange realm, the three strange monsters who had luckily escaped from Ye Xuan’s hands had already gathered in a mystic realm, secretly plotting something.

“Damn it, Ye Xuan’s combat strength is really too terrifying. The most terrifying thing is his speed of improvement. If this continues, it’ll be impossible for us to go back and take revenge,” North Heavenly King said fiercely.

Hearing this, the other two strange monsters stared at each other, not knowing what to do now.

“Other than the East continent, there are also many capable people guarding the other continents. If we want to find a breakthrough in these places, it will also be very difficult.” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Given the current situation, what should we do?”

After pondering for a moment, North Heavenly King suddenly said, “This time, the eight Continents have been united, and the Heavenly Stairway has reappeared. If we stir up disputes between different races and cause strife among them, what will happen?”
