955 Evil Scheme

Hearing the other elder’s complaint, Huangfu Qi of the Immortal Divine sect said moodily, “Do I look like I understand what the ancestor is thinking?”

“Sigh… We’d better guard this place well and do our job well. Otherwise, we’ll suffer the ancestor’s wrath. That won’t be pretty.”

His words were filled with helplessness. After all, the opening of the ancient palace this time was filled with many opportunities, but thanks to their assignments, these opportunities and treasures had nothing to do with them.

Huang Feng felt very unhappy when he heard Huangfu Qi’s words, but could do nothing about this matter. After all, the ancestor’s temperament was well-known. One wrong move, and they would suffer a fate worse than death. Thus, he stopped complaining.

After calming down for a moment, Huangfu Qi suddenly thought of something and spoke.

“Eldest Senior Brother once mentioned to me that he wanted to deal with Sword Immortal Ye of the Great Wilderness Divine sect. Therefore, he captured these people and set up a trap.”

“Back then, the Great Wilderness Divine sect of the East continent destroyed the Immortal Divine sect there, which damaged our power of fate. There’s no way the higher-ups will tolerate that.”

“No matter what, the ancestor will definitely not hold back this time. Furthermore, the ancestor has even consulted those from the Heavenly Dao World and has already obtained their approval.”

Hearing these words, Ye Xuan was also very shocked.

“This damn old man actually wants to deal with me?”

At this moment, Ye Xuan was filled with killing intent, and his gaze was extremely cold. The thing he hated the most was people threatening those who were close to him.

The reason why Gongsun Ming captured these people and trapped them in the cave was because he wanted to grab hold of Ye Xuan’s weakness.

However, what confused Ye Xuan was why Ao Lei and the others had been captured, yet his two disciples were fine.

Was this related to the fact that Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun had the amulets that Yanran had given them? If so, how did Gongsun Ming find out about them?

Thinking this, Ye Xuan felt a chill run down his spine. It seemed that Gongsun Ming had been observing him like a venomous snake.

“Hmph… interesting. Fortunately, I was quick-witted enough to discover this danger in advance. Otherwise, his scheming might really have been effective.”

Ye Xuan also felt very lucky at this moment. Fortunately, he had sensed that something was wrong and had decided to investigate. Thus, he had discovered their hidden scheme.

In that case, there was no need for the Great Wilderness Divine sect to hold back. They had to return the favor.

“Who is it?”

Huangfu Qi suddenly felt a chill run down his spine and immediately shouted. The ancestor had instructed them to kill anyone who approached this place, regardless of who they were.

If they failed to accomplish their duty, then only death awaited them. This was why they were always on high alert, and quickly assumed battle stances once they detected that something was amiss.

At this moment, Ye Xuan showed himself in front of them unhurriedly.

The two of them looked at each other, and their hearts instantly turned cold.

“Ye… Ye Xuan…”

Seeing Ye Xuan appear here, their hearts sank, and even wondered if they were hallucinating.

Should Ye Xuan not be in the treasury now? Why did he come here?

Huangfu Qi was the first to recover. He took out a jade pendant and prepared to crush it to send a message to Gongsun Ming.

However, before he could exert his strength, a bright light flashed by, and his entire arm fell to the ground.

“Ahhhh!”

Huangfu Qi instantly shouted hysterically. Hearing this scream, the guards stationed here immediately rushed over.

However, when they realized that the enemy they were facing was actually Ye Xuan, their advancing figures stopped in their tracks, and their eyes were filled with fear.

“Ye Xuan, what exactly are you trying to do? Why did you suddenly injure our people and trespass into our territory,” an elder questioned loudly.

However, Ye Xuan simply unleashed a sword beam in response, splitting the elder into two.

Seeing that Ye Xuan had no intention of wasting time with words, the guards from the Immortal Divine sect trembled and took a few steps back.

They had hoped that Ye Xuan had not realized their scheme and wanted to convince him to leave peacefully, but it seemed that this was not going to happen.

“It seems that the Immortal Divine sect does not wish to continue existing…”

Ye Xuan was already burning with anger at this moment, and these people were perfect for him to vent that anger.

With a casual wave of his hand, a terrifying force swept out and killed all of them immediately.

It was a one-sided massacre!

After all, the strongest among these people from the Immortal Divine sect had only reached the late-stage of the ancient realm. To Ye Xuan, they were no different from ants.

At this moment, Huangfu Qi, whose left arm had been cut off by Ye Xuan, was the only one left standing, trembling with fear.

Ye Xuan was staring at him with a cold gaze and roared, “Hurry up and tell me where you have locked up the disciples of my sect!”

Huangfu Qi still had some backbone. Although he knew that Ye Xuan’s strength far outstripped his, he was unwilling to back down.

He said impudently, “Hehe, Ye Xuan, you are indeed very powerful, and I’m no match for you. However, you must be dreaming if you think you’ll be able to save them!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he tried to commit suicide.

However, how could Ye Xuan allow him to escape so easily? FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Ye Xuan unleashed a wave of energy that forced out the poison pill that Huangfu Qi wanted to consume. He said with a cold expression, “Do you think that it is so easy to die? Dream on!”

“It seems that you’ve got some backbone. Let’s see if you’ll be able to last until I’m done with you!”
