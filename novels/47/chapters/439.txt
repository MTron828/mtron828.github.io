440 Another Mystic Lord Realm Expert

The Great Wilderness peak’s meeting hall was very crowded and lively at this moment.

Other than Ye Xuan and his disciples, the cultivators from other peaks had all arrived at the competition venue.

Of course, this did not only include the cultivators who were participating in the competition, but also the disciples who came just to watch.

“Take a guess. Which peak will become the champion of this year’s Seven Peaks competition?”

“In my opinion, since the Senior Brother Hua isn’t participating, it will either go to Hidden Sword peak or Returning Cloud peak.”

“The probability of it being the former is probably higher though. I heard that Senior Brother Gao has already reached the materialization realm, and not a low level either.”

“I don’t think so. Although Senior Brother Xiao Beichen of Returning Cloud Peak is low-key, he’s also extremely strong, and no weaker than Senior Brother Gao Tianyu! In my opinion, he has a higher chance of winning the competition”

“Did you guys miss a peak? Don’t you guys think that Cloud Sky peak has great potential?”

Just then, someone mentioned Cloud Sky peak.

As soon as he finished speaking, everyone laughed at him.

“Hahaha! Chief Ye Xuan’s strength is indeed terrifying, but his disciples have only joined our sect for less than three months. How strong could they possibly be?”

“That’s right, in my opinion, those two little junior sisters are at most divine mystic realm cultivators. They don’t have the strength to vie for the top position.”

“Instead of them, I think Senior Sister Li Hanyi has a higher chance.”

Everyone was in a heated discussion over the competition.

The place where they were gathered was the square in front of the meeting hall, in which there was an arena erected at the center, which was where the competition would take place.

Right at this moment, a dazzling streak of light flew past.

Countless people suddenly appeared. The cultivator standing at the very front was Chief Gao Shun, and behind him was his son, Gao Tianyu. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Senior Gao Tianyu really has an extraordinary bearing. I didn’t think much of it at first, but seeing today, I can tell that he really lives up to his reputation!”

Even in the crowd, Gao Tianyu was like a shining star, attracting everyone’s attention.

After all, he was a popular candidate for the top position, so he was naturally the focus of countless cultivators.

Gao Tianyu’s mouth curved into a smile when he noticed the adoring gazes around him. His face was full of confidence. He truly enjoyed being the center of attention.

At this moment, another bright streak of light flashed across the sky.

“Hahaha! Senior Brother Gao Shun, I thought that I had already arrived very early. I didn’t expect you to be faster!”

The tone of voice was bold and rough. It was Liang Dahai.

Gao Shun looked at this fatty indifferently and did not say much.

Suddenly, a beautiful figure descended from the sky. That graceful figure immediately attracted everyone’s attention.

Upon seeing Yuelun, Gao Shun and Liang Dahai narrowed their eyes.

“What? The aura of a mystic lord realm expert?”

The two of them looked at each other and saw the shock in each other’s eyes.

Yuelun had actually broken through to the mystic lord realm!

That meant that, after Ye Xuan, she was the youngest mystic lord realm expert in the Great Wilderness Divine sect!

At that moment, Liang Dahai felt the pressure on him multiply.

One had to know that in the Great Wilderness Divine sect previously, he was the strongest cultivator other than Gongsun Shouyue and Gao Shun.

Now, not only had Ye Xuan reached the mystic lord realm, but even Yuelun, who was weaker than him, had also broken through.

F*ck! This was a little embarrassing.

“I can’t believe that Chief Yuelun broke through to the mystic lord realm. This is truly unbelievable!”

“The heavens have truly blessed our sect. We now have four mystic lord realm cultivators!”

“Hahaha! It seems like the Seven Peaks competition is getting more and more interesting! I heard that Water Sky peak and Hidden Sword peak are not on good terms. I’m really looking forward to this competition!”

“Eh? Why haven’t I seen anyone from Cloud Sky peak? Did they oversleep?”

The people around them looked around and did not see Ye Xuan and his disciples, so they were puzzled.

At this moment, a bright golden light shot up into the sky and fell from above the meeting hall. Then, a handsome man in white appeared, his clothes fluttering in the wind as he stood with his hands behind his back.

“It’s Chief Ye Xuan and those two little junior sisters!”

When the crowd saw this scene, they clamored.

They had been hearing so much recently about Ye Xuan’s strength, but they had never seen him in person.

Seeing him today shocked them. This was even truer for the female cultivators, who now were somewhat infatuated with Ye Xuan.

Gao Shun sensed Ye Xuan’s arrival and his gaze immediately turned cold.

“Oh my God, he’s so handsome?”

“Eh? Chief Ye Xuan’s aura seems to be stronger than the law enforcement elder’s. Could it be…”

As soon as that person finished speaking, everyone quickly looked up.

“Brother, you’re right. Could it be that Chief Ye Xuan’s strength has already surpassed Chief Gao Shun’s?”

At the thought of this, everyone felt shell-shocked.

Ye Xuan had only joined the Great Wilderness Divine sect barely a hundred years ago. Furthermore, a hundred years ago, he was a puny mystic meridian realm cultivator, while Gao Shun was already a mystic lord realm expert back then.

Not only that, many of Gao Shun’s disciples were older than Ye Xuan.

Had Chief Ye Xuan already reached the peak of the mystic lord realm?
