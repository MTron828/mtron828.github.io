Chapter 41: The Dust Has Settled

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“This… This is impossible…”

At the same time, the life in Duan Wuyi’s eyes slowly faded away.

However, before he died, he managed to sense the extremely terrifying aura around Ye Xuan’s body.

He had only felt such power once while he was alive. That terrifying aura he had felt back then belonged to the master of the Xuanyin sect!

This guy had actually reached the golden core realm at the age of 20. All the cultivators in the Great Qian Dynasty had been fooled!

Such monstrous talent was unprecedented!

Was the Xuanyin sect really going to be destroyed at his hands?

However, Duan Wuyi had no way of knowing what the future would be like. After all, those were his dying thoughts.

Whoosh!

Gusts of strong wind blew across the surroundings, sweeping up the dust on the ground.

Not far away, Baduluo witnessed this scene and his entire body stiffened. He looked at Ye Xuan in shock.

This guy dared to kill a cultivator from the Xuanyin sect… was he crazy?

“Everything will soon be settled.”

......

At this moment, Yue slowly raised the sword in her hand and said those words with a cold expression on her face.

“No… I don’t want to die.”

Baduluo’s eyes were filled with fear.

However, as a brilliant sword gleam flashed by, Baduluo’s head was separated from his body.

Before his last shred of consciousness dissipated, Baduluo seemed to recall the people who had died at his hands. They stood quietly at the end of a dark tunnel, staring at him calmly.

Hu Hu!

The strong wind in the surroundings grew stronger and stronger.

The bangs on her forehead were pushed behind her ears. Her clothes, which were stained with fresh blood, fluttered in the wind. Yue, who was holding her sword in her hand, was in a daze.

Everything was over… she had avenged all the villagers of Linshi village.

Her parents, Grandpa Village Chief, Aunt Wang… as well as the rest of the villagers of Linshi village; their deaths had finally been avenged.

However, the moment she killed Baduluo, her entire body crumpled to the ground, and she felt lost.

Yue’s vision blurred. She, who had slaughtered the bandits without displaying the slightest change of expression, was now sobbing on the ground.

As she held her sword in her hand and half-knelt on the ground, the faces of her family from all those years ago kept appearing in her mind.

“Yue…”

“Sister Yue…”

“Little Yue…”

…

Yue seemed to see those familiar faces waving at her. Those naughty children of Linshi Village were playing with each other; her old father had just returned from chopping firewood on the mountain; and her mother was washing clothes by the river.

Clatter…

At this moment, the dark clouds in the sky were emitting flashes of light, as thunder rumbled in the skies above. Raindrops started falling, painting a stark scene of dreary death.

At the same time, the illusion in Yue’s mind suddenly faded. A large and warm hand patiently rubbed her head.

“Teacher…”

Yue’s body trembled. She could no longer suppress the sadness in her heart. She suddenly turned around and hugged Ye Xuan.

The hatred, pressure, and heartache that had been suppressed deeply in her heart over the past two years bubbled forth at this moment.

She had finally taken revenge personally for the deaths of the almost three thousand people of Linshi village.

Back then, she often thought about her identity as the only survivor of Linshi village. Her one and only goal in life was to take revenge on those bandits, and she felt incomparable pressure because of it.

Were it not for the hatred and desire for revenge in her heart, she would not have been able to persevere in the Qingyun sect.

She had once thought that if she really managed to take revenge for Linshi village in the future, then she would be able to die without regrets.

Linshi village had not only been her hometown, but also her entire world. When the villagers of Linshi village fell at the hands of the bandits, her world collapsed.

However, things were now different. She had a teacher.

Ye Xuan’s appearance was like a candle, lighting up her dark life. Where?her teacher was, there was her world!

Ye Xuan gently patted Yue’s head and transmitted a trace of gentle power into her body to calm her restless emotions.

A moment later, Yue calmed down.

“Teacher, I want to go back to Linshi village to take a look!” Yue wiped the tears on her face and said to Ye Xuan.

“Okay!” Ye Xuan nodded gently, and then brought Yue over to Huang Ling and Xue Min.

The very next second, Ye Xuan waved his sleeve, and an extremely pure power enveloped them as they flew away.

After Ye Xuan and the others left, the sky rumbled with the sound of thunder, and a torrent of rain fell.

It was like an outpouring of rain from the nine heavens. It washed away all of the blood on the ground. The rescued villagers prostrated themselves.

“Thank you, benefactor, for saving our lives!”

“Thank you, benefactor, for saving our lives!”

The villagers ignored the falling rain as they knelt in the direction where Ye Xuan and the others had left. Their eyes were filled with gratitude.

The boy whose parents had died in the hands of the bandits wiped the tears from his cheeks and kowtowed heavily in the same direction.

…

Linshi village!

The village that had once been filled with laughter and happiness was now a shadow of its former self. Walls were broken everywhere, which were covered with spider webs, and the villagers’ furniture had long become moldy.

The houses were also filled with rainwater, which passed through the ruined roofs. The weeds in the village were as tall as an adult’s waist!

Thunder continued to rumble as the dense clouds dispensed rain over the surrounding area.

Yue quietly looked at the ruined village, her memories overlapping with the scene in front of her. She looked absent-minded as she slowly walked through the village. No matter how heavy the rain was, she toiled to find the villagers’ bones and remains amidst the storm, and buried them.

After spending half a day, Yue finally buried the villagers’ and her mother’s bones in the village. Then, she went to the Netherworld Forest to look for her father’s bones.

After doing all this, Yue erected a memorial monument in their honor.

Then, Yue slowly walked over to the grave of her parents and tearfully knelt down.

The rain slowly dripped onto her face, intermingling with her tears. In Yue’s mind’s eye, she could still see and hear her parents’ cheerful laughter. She could not help but immerse herself into the memories of the past. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Yue!”

Sitting by her bedside, in a slightly dim room, her mother looked at her dotingly.

“Yue, remember to forget. You must live on. As long as you can live a safe and happy life, father and mother will have no regrets!”

As her words trailed off, the candle flame that dimly lit up the room was extinguished.

..

Yue stayed in front of her parents’ grave for a long time.

Suddenly, a bright smile appeared on Yue’s face. Then, she kowtowed in front of her parents’ tombstones again.

“Father, Mother, you don’t have to worry. Yue will definitely continue to be happy!”

“Because Yue has met the best teacher in the world…”

The rainstorm came and went. After Yue paid her respects to her parents, the dark clouds in the sky slowly dissipated.

However, Yue’s clothes had been soaked in the rain, and they clung tightly to her body.

Since Yue’s cultivation had already reached the fifth level of the true essence realm, she used the true essence power in her body to evaporate the moisture from her clothes.

“Alright, let’s go to Jiangqing city!”
