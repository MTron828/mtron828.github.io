728 Activating The Defensive Formation

Thank you readers!

After the meeting came to an end, Zhuge Yueyue’s mind was in a daze. She returned to the Cloud Sky Peak without even realizing it.

Seeing her return, Feng Xiyun and Xiang Yun came over. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Feng Xiyun asked worriedly when she saw her frowning face, “First Sister, did anything important happen?”

It was the first time she saw Zhuge Yueyue’s expression this serious, so she had a bad premonition.

Zhuge Yueyue did not hide anything from her and told her everything that happened in the meeting.

After learning of this news, Feng Xiyun’s face also turned pale.

She knew very well that if these ferocious beasts really rushed out of the desert region, the entire East continent would very likely turn into a living hell.

Zhuge Yueyue was actually very helpless. However, she glanced at the plaque of every chief in the history of Cloud Sky peak and made her decision.

“No matter what, we must defend!”

After saying this, Zhuge Yueyue said firmly, “No matter what, this place is our home. It is a place that we need to do our best to protect”

“Even if we have to sacrifice our lives for this, we must protect this place. Before Teacher ends his seclusion, we must not let these evil things taint our home.”

Hearing this, Feng Xiyun’s expression also became determined as she said, “Alright, First Sister, if you need us to do anything, just say it. Xiang Yun and I will definitely do our best to help you and protect our home well.”

“Yes, yes, yes. If First Sister needs anything, just say it. Xiang Yun will definitely listen to your instructions obediently.”

Xiang Yun did not know what kind of disaster was about to happen, but she could already tell that she would be able to fight very soon, which made her a little excited.

It had been a long time since she had fought with others, so she was itching for a fight.

Zhuge Yueyue could not help but burst out laughing when she saw Xiang Yun’s happy face. This little girl was so straightforward.

At this moment, Zhuge Yueyue seemed to have thought of something and was no longer as nervous as before. If push came to shove, Xiang Yun was their trump card, though hopefully they would not have to rely on the power hidden in her body.

After pondering for a moment, Zhuge Yueyue spoke again, “Alright, let’s start making our preparations.”

After saying this, Zhuge Yueyue lit a bunch of incense sticks and burned them for their ancestors.

Zhuge Yueyue then looked at Feng Xiyun and said without hesitation.

“Xiyun, let’s go and activate the formation first.”

“Alright”

The two of them immediately took action.

The defensive formation would not be activated under normal circumstances, and was intended for use during crises. The fact that they had been requested to activate it indicated the gravity of the situation.

As Zhuge Yueyue was the head disciple of Cloud Sky peak, Ye Xuan had already told her how to activate the defensive formation.

After leaving the Cloud Sky Palace, the three of them arrived in front of a huge rock.

Zhuge Yueyue approached it with a serious expression. Then, she took out her Cloud Sky Sword and stabbed it into a crack in the huge rock and injected her spiritual power into the sword, which in turn channeled it into the rock.

“Ooh! Shiny!”

After seeing a dazzling flash of light, Xiang Yu exclaimed in shock, “This is too beautiful”

After Zhuge Yueyue activated the defensive formation, the entirety of Cloud Sky peak seemed to be covered by a light barrier which emitting dazzling light.

One could sense that there were waves of fierce sword intent wreaking havoc above Cloud Sky Peak. In an instant, the wind and clouds began to swirl around the peak.

After seeing this scene, the other members of the Great Wilderness Divine sect all sighed with emotion.

“So this is what Cloud Sky peak’s defensive formation looks like? It’s really powerful.”

“It actually contains Chief Ye Xuan’s sword intent. I think even mystic lord realm beasts won’t be able to break through, right?”

During times of crisis, having a powerful defensive formation would set one’s heart at ease, and make one more confident in battle. The disciples of Cloud Sky peak were truly lucky.

After Ao Lei gave the order, the disciples of the other peaks began to make their preparations. They did not know what would happen in the near future, and the only thing they could do now was to make sufficient preparations in order to ensure their safety and battle readiness.

When Zhuge Yueyue activated the peak’s defensive formation with the Cloud Sky Sword, she immediately sensed the sharp aura in the sky. This made her feel more at ease.

‘I did not expect the formation to be so powerful. In this case, it should not be a problem for us to face a large number of ferocious beasts’

However, she also had to make other preparations, and one of them was to cultivate and break through to the heaven realm.
