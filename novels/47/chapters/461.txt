462 The Semifinals (Part 1)

The next morning, the square was packed with people. It was the semifinals of the Seven Peaks competition.

Now, there were only two arenas left.

Ye Xuan brought Feng Xiyun and Zhuge Yueyue over.

“Greetings, Sect Master!”

!!

Ye Xuan saluted Gongsun Shouyue and ignored Gao Shun beside him. Then, he went to his seat.

To Ye Xuan’s surprise, Yuelun was already sitting on the throne very elegantly.

It seemed that yesterday’s incident did not affect her too much.

However, when she noticed Ye Xuan’s arrival, her eyes darted away as she forcefully stabilized her emotions. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Seeing this, Ye Xuan smiled.

“Good morning, Senior Sister! It seems like you had a good rest last night.”

“That’s none of your business!”

Yuelun glared at Ye Xuan.

Ye Xuan simply smiled.

“We’re not done with yesterday’s topic yet, so why don’t we continue? Wasn’t Senior Sister curious about the power of that immortal-grade divine power? We can set a time to check it out later today.”

This guy actually mentioned it again…

Yuelun did not know how to face Ye Xuan. She did not expect him to be so shameless as to bring it up again.

Her face turned red, and her heart beat wildly.

“We’ll talk about it in the future.”

Yuelun did not dare to look directly at Ye Xuan and brushed him off.

However, when she realized what she had said, her face turned even redder.

“In the future? That’s great!”

Ye Xuan sat down with a smile on his face. He found the whole situation funny. This woman was still too naive.

When Feng Xiyun and Zhuge Yueyue saw this scene, they were puzzled.

“Xiyun, do you know what Teacher was talking about with Chief Yuelun yesterday? The atmosphere between them seems strange…” Zhuge Yueyue said

Feng Xiyun’s mouth twitched.

“I don’t know. They’re making it seem so mysterious.”

Was there something between their Teacher and Chief Yuelun?

At this moment, the crowd spotted Feng Xiyun and Zhuge Yueyue and immediately started shouting excitedly.

Cloud Sky peak’s performance in the Seven Peaks competition was unrivaled.

In particular, Zhuge Yueyue’s matches had shocked everyone.

Who would have thought that someone who had only been cultivating for more than three months would actually advance into the top four?

Furthermore, they were still unclear about her exact cultivation level.

It could be said that Cloud Sky peak’s image had undergone a tremendous change. Everything surrounding Cloud Sky peak was now a mystery.

Many people were now wondering if Zhuge Yueyue could make it into the finals.

“In your opinion, which two will be able to advance to the final today?”

The crowd started an extremely heated discussion.

“In my opinion, Gao Tianyu from Hidden Sword peak will definitely enter the final. As for the second spot, I think Zhuge Yueyue from Cloud Sky peak has a higher chance…”

“That’s what I think too. Although Li Hanyi from Water Sky peak is powerful, she could not easily defeat Feng Xiyun. Zhuge Yueyue is definitely stronger than Feng Xiyun.”

While this was happening, the drawing of lots for the matchups ended.

As Ye Xuan had guessed, Zhuge Yueyue’s opponent was not Gao Tianyu, but Bai Xuanyuan from the Great Wilderness peak.

Gao Shun was clearly manipulating the matchups.

However, he was not too concerned. After all, in the face of absolute power, all struggles were in vain.

“Junior Brother, what do you think of my disciple?” Gongsun Shouyue looked at Ye Xuan with a smile.

Bai Xuanyuan was his second disciple. Although he was not as strong as Hua Rufeng, he had also reached the eighth level of the materialization realm. In order to compete for the coveted position of champion of the Seven Peaks competition, every peak had poured in countless resources to strengthen their main candidates.

This naturally included Gongsun Shouyue. In the beginning, these cultivation resources were reserved for Hua Rufeng, but his first disciple had now reached the void realm, so most of these resources were now useless to him.

Thus, Bai Xuanyuan benefited.

Ye Xuan narrowed his eyes.

Fortunately, the cooldown period for spiritual power infusion had ended in time. Otherwise, Zhuge Yueyue’s second-level materialization realm cultivation would be quite lacking in comparison to these geniuses.

The other peaks were much richer than Cloud Sky peak, especially in terms of cultivation resources.

Given that the Seven Peaks competition was a grand event within the sect that only happened once every hundred years, no one wanted to be ranked last.

Therefore, in order to increase their ranking as much as possible, the various chiefs were willing to invest large amounts into their strongest candidates.

Ye Xuan looked at the young man in green standing behind Gongsun Shouyue, and nodded with a smile.

“As expected of Senior Brother Gongsun’s disciple. He’s truly a dragon among men! His talent is unparalleled!”

“Hahaha…” Gongsun Shouyue smiled.

...

How could he not understand what Ye Xuan meant by that? Although Bai Xuanyuan’s talent was not bad, when compared to Feng Xiyun and Zhuge Yueyue, he was sorely lacking.

However, unlike the other chiefs, Gongsun Shouyue was not too hung up on victory or defeat.

No matter who won in the end, everyone was a disciple of the Great Wilderness Divine sect.

At this moment, the judge arrived in front of an arena and said with a serious expression, The semi-finals are about to begin. Please remain silent!”

“After today, two cultivators will enter the finals of the Seven Peaks competition. However, the competition this year will be a little different. The final will also be held today!”

“Moreover, the final match will be held as soon as the results of the semifinal matches are confirmed. This way, it will truly test the endurance and combat experience of the finalists!”

“Therefore, the cultivators who are participating in today’s competition should pay attention. You must ensure that you retain sufficient spiritual power to compete in both matches.”
