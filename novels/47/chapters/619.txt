620 Dropout

This group of boys had actually lost to a little girl. It was really embarrassing.

“Daddy!”

Li Yi burst into tears when he saw Li Dahai. He ran up to hug his father’s thigh.

However, Li Dahai felt both embarrassed and angry.

!!

It was fine that his son lost to Ye Xuan’s disciple.

However, what was with that mouth of his?

How could he say that his father had eastern sh*t?!

At this moment, he even felt like slapping his son.

However, when he thought about his wife, he decided against it.

Further away, Ye Xuan said with a straight face, “Yun’er, what’s wrong with you? Before I left, I specifically told you to be serious about learning how to read. It’s only been a short while, but you’re already causing trouble?”

Xiang Yun became even angrier when she heard that. She replied angrily, “Teacher, it’s not because of me this time!”

“I wanted to study hard, but this group of little brats kept finding trouble with me, especially him. I really couldn’t stand it!”

“Otherwise, I wouldn’t have beaten them up like this. Hmph They even tried to gang up on me. I definitely couldn’t let them off.”

As she spoke, Xiang Yun became even more excited, as if she was not done fighting yet.

Looking at her puffed up face, Ye Xuan smiled and could not help but rub her head. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

This girl really had a bad temper. Offending her was like poking a bee’s nest, and violence was the way she solved problems.

After figuring out the reason behind the fight, Ye Xuan chuckled.

Since she was not the cause of the matter, she could not be blamed.

It seemed that he had avoided the task of having to perform damage control, which made him feel quite relieved.

The cause of this incident was not his disciple at all, but Li Yi. Li Yi had challenged his disciple and was defeated. Sword Spirit peak would probably be laughed at for a while because of this..

Li Dahai had also asked his son about it, and his son was really honest and straightforward, telling him everything that had happened without twisting the facts.

After hearing his son’s reason, Li Dahai’s face was as black as charcoal.

‘Is this silly boy really my son? He’s got no street-smarts at all…’

‘If he changed the story just a bit, at the very least, he would have shared the blame with Xiang Yun.’

‘Instead, this kid had caused the trouble, and actually admitted to it openly.’

“I’ll teach you a lesson when we get home!”

Li Dahai said helplessly, “Ahem, Junior Brother Ye. It was my son’s fault for what happened today.”

“He deserved this beating, and I’ll reprimand him further when I get home so that he won’t stir up any more trouble.”

Hearing these words, Ye Xuan’s expression remained calm.

“It’s alright, Senior Brother Li, let’s not blame these children. After all, they are still young and don’t know any better.”

“My disciple was a little too heavy-handed and beat up your son really badly. I’ll bring her over to Sword Spirit peak another day and ask her to apologize to your son.”

Upon hearing that, Li Dahai was speechless.

No way!

Li Yi was much older than Xiang Yun, yet he had lost to the latter easily.

If she was really forced to apologize to him, would that not be the same as telling everyone that not only was he lacking in terms of strength, but also that he was relying on his father’s status to bully others?

“Ahem, I don’t think that’s necessary.”

“It’s very normal for children to play around. He has to accept his loss. It’s his own fault, and he just has to train harder in order to get stronger.”

Li Dahai knew that his reputation had taken a hit today, so he did not stay for long. He picked up Li Yi and said goodbye to the chiefs present before slipping away.

The rest of the children were also brought back at this time. Today’s incident was indeed a little outrageous.

Everyone looked at the little girl beside Ye Xuan in shock.

How could this little girl be so strong?

A while later, Ao Lei curiously went over to Xiang Yun’s side, but quickly noticed that there was a powerful force protecting her body, preventing others from probing her.

It was obvious that this was Ye Xuan’s doing.

Then, after looking at it carefully, he suddenly noticed the seal on her forehead.

Hiss…

Ao Lei instantly thought of something and said with a smile, “Haha, Junior Brother Ye, this disciple you’ve recruited is amazing. She must be a very talented person!”

His eyes were still filled with disbelief, as he understood what that seal represented.

Ye Xuan replied very humbly, “No, no. My disciple’s personality is a little crude, so it’s hard to say what kind of achievements she will have in the future.”

Ao Lei’s expression stiffened. This kid was showing off again…

However, he had picked up a genius disciple from the middle of nowhere. He truly had an eye for talent and the luck of the gods.

He was also full of anticipation. What level would this little girl reach in the future?

While he was deep in thought, Elder Huang spoke up.

“Junior Brother Ye, why don’t you take your disciple back to Cloud Sky peak and teach her? I really can’t help you out this time.”

“Have pity on this senior brother of yours. My old bones can’t take a beating, you know.”

...

Elder Huang was already afraid of Xiang Yun. He had totally misjudged her temperament and capability.

Ye Xuan also felt very helpless at this time. This little girl had only joined the study hall for less than a day, yet was already dropping out.

This achievement would probably become a talking point in the sect for quite some time.

“Alright then. I won’t trouble you to teach my disciple anymore.”
