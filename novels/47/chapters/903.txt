904 High Ancestor Shan Ling

If the enemies were as strong as the last round, perhaps she might not really be able to hold on anymore.

After killing the seven experts, she knew that she had become a target, and that there was no way to avoid this fight. It was for this reason that she ordered Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun to retreat.

After all, if the two of them stayed here, it would only distract her during the fight if she had to protect them as well. Zhuge Yueyue obviously understood the seriousness of this matter and did not choose to stay. However, before returning to the rear, she took out five pills and handed them to Yanran.

“Teacher’s wife, these pills were given to us by our teacher. Consuming one will help you recover your strength. Use them.”

Seeing these medicinal pills, Yanran was stunned. She could tell that these medicinal pills were very precious. However, now was not the time to admire that, so she did not act pretentiously and simply accepted the pills.

Immediately after, she sent out a gentle wave of power that moved Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun to the rear.

After doing all this, she raised his head and looked at the sky. The aura around her body became stronger as she prepared herself for battle.

Back at the rear, Zhuge Yueyue was quite worried. After all, she could clearly sense that the opponent that her teacher’s wife was facing this time was not so easy to deal with.

However, she had no other choice. After all, with her current strength, going forward would only make things worse, and could thus only watch helplessly.

“What should we do? Teacher’s wife only just concluded the last battle. If another one begins right now, she might really not be able to hold on…”

At this moment, another loud rumble came from the sky, followed by the descent of a huge figure.

“The high ancestor of the lightning tiger clan!”

Everyone revealed shocked gazes. After all, this was one of the top experts of the Heavenly Dao World!

Although this fellow could not compare to the White Tiger of the four ancient divine beasts, his combat strength was quite heaven-defying, and exceeded the strength of the golden-furred growler ancestor by leaps and bounds.

After the high ancestor arrived, the scene suddenly became silent, as if someone had pressed the pause button.

After a long time, someone finally said fearfully, “Heavens… This time around, Yanran might have really angered the lightning tiger clan. Even such a powerful old monster like this fellow has come personally…”

Everyone’s faces had turned pale, and they were worried that they would be implicated by Yanran’s actions. If the high ancestor decided to make a move against the eight continents, it would definitely be an unprecedented disaster.

Even if this was just a clone, the clone’s combat strength far surpassed the sealed immortal realm due to the techniques and insights into the Dao he had. He might even be able to easily kill ordinary sealed immortal realm experts.

At this moment, Yanran also felt pressured, and even her breathing became slightly ragged.

“The lightning tiger clan’s high ancestor, Shan Ling!”

After she said this, a golden lotus mark appeared on her forehead, and her body began to release waves of golden divine light. Her expression remained serious as she quietly waited for the other party to arrive.

Soon Shan Ling descended and appeared directly above the East Sea.

He raised his head high and stared at Yanran. After a long time, he said, “You are the Saintess of the Great Wilderness Divine sect?”

“Our lightning tiger clan has never had any grudges with your Great Wilderness Divine sect, yet why did you kill so many of my descendants?”

“Shouldn’t you give me a reason?”

As soon as he finished speaking, his powerful spiritual pressure erupted and descended on Yanran, making it feel like she was carrying a huge mountain on her shoulders.

If she was not careful, she would probably suffer serious injuries.

‘His aura is too terrifying. He really is worthy of being one of those ancient monsters who have lived for countless years. Even being stared at by him is like being stared at by the Grim Reaper,’ Yanran thought to herself.

However, she also felt lucky that only his clone had come. In any case, it was absolutely impossible for his main body to come to this world, as not only did the Heavenly Dao laws not allow it, but this world could not support his existence at all.

Still, his clone was more than sufficient to deal with this situation.

After hearing the high ancestor’s question, Yanran straightened her back and replied coldly without backing down, “Reason? What reason is there to say?”

“The endless path of immortal cultivation is filled with life and death. Since your descendants were incompetent and bullied the weak, I killed them! Is there a need to say anything more?”

Hearing this, Shan Ling’s heart was already burning with anger, and he wanted nothing more than to kill Yanran. How could these nobodies kill bearers of such a noble bloodline.

He simply refused to accept this matter.

He stared at Yanran, full of killing intent. However, he did not make his move. After all, he was very clear that Yanran’s body contained a powerful karmic power as she was the successor of the Saintess of the Great Wilderness Divine sect.

If he chose to attack her, then those people from the Heavenly Dao World’s Great Wilderness Divine sect would definitely attack him. If that really happened, the situation would be difficult to manage.

Even though he was not afraid of the sect, there were quite a few ruthless people who had appeared in this sect in ancient times, and they were considered top experts within the Heavenly Dao World. No one would refute that statement.

Back then, these experts would kill their way into the other forces to exact revenge, and Shan Ling did not want to become a victim of their hatred.L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎
