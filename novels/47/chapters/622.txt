623 Secluded Cultivation (Part 2)

Ye Xuan’s cultivation had reached the middle stage of the supreme realm after absorbing just part of the remaining power.

However, this was not the end. As more and more power was absorbed, Ye Xuan continued to get stronger…

In the blink of an eye, six days had passed.

At this moment, Ye Xuan’s entire body was emitting golden light, and if one looked carefully, they would find that it contained many mysterious runes floating around Ye Xuan’s body. These runes originated from the fiery phoenix’s divine bone, and aided his cultivation significantly.

!!

His mastery of the fiery phoenix divine power had also reached new heights, and he actually did not dare to activate it at full power, as he was still unable to control such speed.

Had he become the fastest person in the East continent?

On the ninth day, Ye Xuan once again mobilized the power in his body and broke through to the late-stage of the supreme realm.

Bang! Bang!

After the muffled sounds rang out, his body released an even more intense golden light.

At this moment, Ye Xuan seemed to have undergone a qualitative change.

“I’ve finally broken through to the late stage of the supreme realm,” Ye Xuan muttered to himself.

His whole body seemed taut and full of energy, which felt amazing. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Furthermore, he was now even closer to the ancient realm!

His cultivation had improved significantly, and he had a deeper understanding of his divine powers.

Even his Sword Dao had become more powerful. Ye Xuan felt that he would soon be able to display the third move of the Flora Sword technique.

After thinking about it for a moment, Ye Xuan felt that it would take some time to completely consolidate his cultivation foundation.

The one unfortunate thing was that the body refining technique was incomplete, and as such was only a heaven-grade cultivation method.

However, Ye Xuan believed that if he studied and mastered it, given his comprehension ability, he would be able to complete the body refining technique and turn it into a true blue immortal-grade body refining technique.

After planning out his next actions, Ye Xuan ended his secluded cultivation and left the cultivation room.

When he did, he stumbled upon a situation in the Cloud Sky peak’s garden.

“Stop right there!”

“Not a single one of you can escape!”

“All of you, stop right there!”

Ye Xuan spotted a little girl riding a unicorn in the garden, waving a hammer in her hand and shouting at the white cranes in the distance.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan was at a loss.

This little girl, even though no one was playing with her, could still entertain herself and even had a lot of fun.

During Ye Xuan’s secluded cultivation, almost none of the beasts on Cloud Sky peak had escaped her whims and fancies.

Ever since Xiang Yun came to Cloud Sky peak, these beasts had never had a single day of Peace. They were miserable and could only wail helplessly at the sky.

“Third Sister, hurry up and come over here. It’s time to learn how to read.”

Zhuge Yueyue looked at Xiang Yun helplessly.

Over this period of time, she had been tortured quite a bit. She finally understood why Xiang Yun had dropped out after only a single day at the study hall.

Both her and Feng Xiyun’s efforts had only resulted in Xiang Yun learning four words. There was a long way to go before she could read, and it almost seemed like an impossible task.

She was not interested in learning how to read at all. Whenever she was free, she would chase and play with these exotic beasts, or beat up other children.

Thus, these nine days had been extremely frustrating for Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun.

After Zhuge Yueyue had just called for Xiang Yun, she suddenly noticed her teacher’s presence, and realized that he had ended his secluded cultivation.

She quickly grabbed Xiang Yun and brought her over to Ye Xuan.

“Congratulations on completing your secluded cultivation, Teacher.”

Xiang Yun hugged Ye Xuan’s thigh and said with a smile, “Teacher, can you send me back to the study hall? I’ve learnt a new technique and want to try it out on those brats. I’ll beat them up till their faces are swollen!”

Ye Xuan quickly changed the topic and said, “Yun’er, didn’t I tell you to learn how to read? Tell me how many words have you learned over the past few days.”

Upon hearing this, Xiang Yun’s eyes darted around as she answered with her head held high.

“Hehehe, Teacher, I’m really smart. I’ve already learned four words in nine days.”

“That’s fine…”

Ye Xuan unconsciously answered and was about to praise her further when he did a double-take.

“Uh… Only four words?”

Ye Xuan was dumbfounded.

Four words in nine days?

She was shockingly unique in so many ways.

It seemed that teaching her how to read was an impossible task.

“You only learned four words in nine days? Are you sure you’re not lying to me?” Ye Xuan asked in disbelief.

However, Xiang Yun shattered his hopes as she proudly replied, “Of course I’m not lying. Teacher, am I not amazing! I learned four words!”

Ye Xuan did not know whether to laugh or cry. How was he going to solve this problem?

In any case, it seemed like the prudent course of action was to teach her to train her body first.
