Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Thanks to the influx of the endless spiritual energy, Zhuge Yueyue’s entire body glowed with dazzling divine light.

“Oh my god! This is a sign of a breakthrough!’

Boundless blue light flashed and a diamond-shaped ice mark appeared on Zhuge Yueyue’s forehead. This was a unique sign of a breakthrough to the ancient realm.

“Is this for real? She’s going to break through to the ancient realm under these circumstances?”

Everyone was shocked. This was the first time they had seen such a special situation, so this was unprecedented.

“She discarded her obsession and chose to accept her true self. First Sister is really going to step into the ancient realm,” Feng Xiyun muttered to herself. Her eyes were filled with shock. She felt very incredulous at this moment.

On the other hand, Zhuge Yueyue felt that the immortal bones in her body were releasing terrifying energy, which was helping her body to evolve.

Moments later, a terrifying amount of power swept out, and Gongsun Zhi, who was the closest to her, was instantly forced back.

Gongsun Zhi only stopped after he was knocked back a thousand meters. He spat out a mouthful of blood and collapsed to the ground.

He still felt unresigned at this moment. He struggled to stand up again, but no longer had the strength to do so. He could only say, “What exactly are you…

How did you accomplish this?”

Zhuge Yueyue stared at him coldly. There was no emotion in her eyes. This seemed to be her answer to him.

“Accepting and then discarding your past emotions…”

Gongsun Zhi smiled helplessly. He had to admit this fact.

Zhuge Yueyue did not want to show mercy at this moment. She slashed her sword at Gongsun Zhi, and was about to take his life when something unexpected suddenly occurred.

A huge wrinkled hand appeared in the air and came flying toward Gongsun Zhi.

“Oh no, dodge quickly!’

Seeing this scene, everyone’s expression changed and they immediately retreated. The shocking pressure coming from this hand was so powerful that none of the cultivators present could raise their heads to see whose hand it was, not even Zhuge Yue Yue.

However, she knew very well that this hand belonged to an expert from the Immortal l)ivine sect who wanted to rescue Gongsun Zhi.

However, Zhuge Yueyue would not let him save Gongsun Zhi so easily.

Earlier, Gongsun Zhi insulted the Great Wilderness Sect and even dared to insult her master. How could she let Gongsun Zhi off so easily?

“Stop right there!”

As soon as she finished speaking, the Cloud Heaven Sword instantly flew out as she unleashed the Worldly Slash, and even opened the Sword Dao Door.

When these attacks crashed against the hand, the old man actually felt a trace of pain on his skin. However, his hand still grabbed Gongsun Zhi, and then his body erupted with power!

“Oh my god…”

When the old man released his true power, everyone finally understood how terrifying the old man was. Against someone this powerful, even most ordinary sealed immortal realm experts were helpless, much less Zhuge Yueyue.

His aura pushed Zhuge Yueyue to the ground, and she seemed to have been seriously injured. However, Zhuge Yueyue wiped the blood off her mouth and stood up immediately.

After the old man rescued Gongsun Zhi, he said coldly, “Little thing, you are indeed very talented, but unfortunately, your actions have seriously interfered

with my plan. Therefore, you can only die!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the old man released a powerful palm strike. He actually wanted to kill Zhuge Yueyue here.

Faced with this terrifying energy, Zhuge Yueyue felt as if she was facing the Grim Reaper. She could only close her eyes and accept her fate.

She knew very well that even if she did not kill Gongsun Zhi today, these people from the Immortal Divine sect would never let her off easily, as she would pose a threat to them in the future. They would not allow her to grow to that stage.

This was the cruel reality of the cultivation world.

Zhuge Yueyue had wanted to kill Gongsun Zhi, so that even if she died, she would drag a genius of the Immortal Divine sect with her.

However, given the current situation, there was no way for her to realize that

The huge palm flew toward Zhuge Yueyue, causing the world to tremble. However, at this moment, a huge staff suddenly appeared.

“Haha! I’m here!”

“Who is it?”ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

After hearing this voice, the onlookers were taken aback. Who would dare to interfere in the battle at this juncture?

On a cloud in the distance, a golden monkey flew over, holding a rod that was emitting golden light.

Not only that, but there were also extremely strange sounds coming from behind the golden monkey.

Thump thump, thump thump thump…

At this moment, everyone’s jaws dropped as they watched the monkey stir up the wind and clouds with the rod in his hand.

Zhuge Yueyue also took this opportunity to escape the palm strike while the old man was distracted. She cast a grateful look at the furry monkey.

However, the monkey was not here to save Zhuge Yueyue. Instead, his target was the pill.

“Hahaha, I’ll take this pill since no one wants it.”

After shouting in a despicable manner, the furry monkey immediately reached out to snatch the immortal pill.

However, when he saw this, the old man in the sky instantly became angry.

“Damned monkey, how dare you meddle in other people’s business!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the old man launched an attack at the monkey. It was another palm strike!

However, unexpectedly, the furry monkey ignored the terrifying palm strike…
