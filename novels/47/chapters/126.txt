Chapter 127: You Are Not Worthy Of Fighting Teacher

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

In the beginning, the leader of the Mad Saber sect had tried to restrain his laughter, but failed.

Moreover, among the many cultivators present, he could be considered to possess a deep understanding of Ye Xuan’s strength.

Heck, even the golden core realm expert from the Nether God sect was no match for Ye Xuan.

Besides, did Mo Tianyi really think that he was a pushover?

Sure, he had been low-key ever since that incident, but since the other party wanted to mess with him, there was no reason not to show off a little.

The leader of the Mad Saber sect casually stretched out his hand and grabbed the ball of hellfire, which was instantly snuffed out.

However, he stopped there. After all, there was a golden core realm expert standing behind Mo Tianyi.

“A core formation realm expert?”

Mo Tianyi saw this and could not help but frown.

He had randomly picked a cultivator to vent his anger on, but this cultivator turned out to be a core formation realm expert.

When he thought of this, he became even more furious. Another ball of hellfire condensed in his palm. Sure, he could not beat a core formation realm expert, but what about the others?

Right now, his heart was filled with displeasure. He had to find someone to vent his anger on. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

However, at this moment, a peerless beauty slowly walked out.

The woman held a longsword in her hand and looked at Mo Tianyi indifferently, before saying, “A mere seventh-level purple spirit realm expert doesn’t have the qualifications to challenge my teacher!”

“I can deal with you with just one sword strike!”

Li Qingyan slowly raised the sword in her hand. The tip of the sword radiated a sharp sword aura as it was slowly pointed at Mo Tianyi.

She, who had always been calm and collected, was currently filled with anger.

She would not care if Mo Tianyi defeated the third prince or insulted the Great Qian Dynasty. However, she could not just sit by and watch as Mo Tianyi insulted her teacher.

How dare he say that her teacher was trash?

How ridiculous!

Li Qingyan glanced at Ye Xuan. After obtaining her Teacher’s consent, she decisively chose to attack Mo Tianyi.

He was just a seventh-level purple spirit realm cultivator. He was not worth her teacher’s time at all.

Moreover, the meaning in Ye Xuan’s eyes was very obvious. He allowed Li Qingyan to use her full strength.

This guy was already attacking the young cultivators of the Great Qian Dynasty. Although he did not care much about the dignity of the empire, he was still a member of the Great Qian Dynasty. How could he sit idly by?

Still, Mo Tianyi was just a piddling purple spirit realm cultivator. It would be unbecoming of him to take action on such a weak cultivator.

Such small matters were better left to his disciples.

“It’s you?!”

When Mo Tianyi’s gaze fell on Li Qingyan, his eyes briefly lit up, before turning cold once again.

He had noticed Yue and Li Qingyan in the crowd from the beginning. After all, the two women were too beautiful, so it was nearly impossible to miss them.

However, when he noticed Yue and Li Qingyan, he also saw Ye Xuan beside them. Although he was a little unwilling to admit it, Ye Xuan’s appearance was definitely superior to his.

As someone of the same gender, he decisively chose to ignore Ye Xuan.

However, he was also a little surprised by the fact that he could not sense Yue and Li Qingyan’s cultivation levels.

Even so, he did not think much of it. After all, the two women looked very young. How strong could they be?

She even said that she only needed one sword strike to defeat him? That was really laughable!

However, it was also good. He had to defeat these two women using absolute strength to conquer them for himself.

At that time, not only would he gain fame, but he would also be able to take two beautiful women home. Would that not be great?

However, who was the teacher that this woman was talking about?

“Could it be that you are the strongest genius of the Great Qian Dynasty?”

Mo Tianyi’s gaze landed on Li Qingyan, and a trace of mockery flashed through his eyes. Although he already knew that it was not the other party, he still could not help but tease her.

“My Teacher is the strongest genius of the Great Qian Dynasty! But I’m more than capable of finishing you off!”

Li Qingyan slowly raised her longsword, and spiritual power from her dantian slowly poured into the longsword.

Such a person was not worth her time!

Seeing this, Mo Tianyi narrowed his eyes.

He actually felt an extreme sense of danger from this longsword.

“Can Li Qingyan really defeat Mo Tianyi?”

“Although Elder Ye Xuan’s ability to teach disciples is excellent, and their strength has increased rapidly, they might not be able to defeat Mo Tianyi. After all, he’s a personal disciple of the Nether God sect!”

The people around them could not help but reveal worried expressions.

“Did I hear you wrongly? You’re actually worried about Li Qingyan? Are you doubting Elder Ye Xuan’s strength? Given Elder Ye Xuan’s strength, do you think he wouldn’t know which of these two is stronger?”

“That’s right. If Elder Ye Xuan gave her his approval, he must be confident that she will win!”

“That makes sense. We got worried for nothing. Fairy Li Qingyan will definitely beat that arrogant person!”

“Hahaha! I am looking forward to seeing that guy defeated by Fairy Li Qingyan!”

“What an arrogant kid. Does he really think that he is the strongest genius of the Nanzhou Region just because he joined the Nether God sect? The Nether God sect is indeed terrifying, but that doesn’t mean that he is the same!”

“He’s just a seventh-level purple spirit realm, yet he wants to challenge Elder Ye Xuan? If Elder Ye Xuan simply waves his hand, it will be more than enough to crush him to death!”

“Mo Tianyi’s age is almost the same as the third prince’s. They are both around 26 years old. Reaching the seventh level of the purple spirit realm at such a young age is indeed worthy of praise, but that’s about it. Compared to Elder Ye Xuan, he’s nothing!”
