543 Ou Yunhai (Part 1)

Ye Xuan also sighed when he saw the man in luxurious clothes.

It was obvious that this man was very powerful.

“It’s actually Ou Yunhai. Why is he here?”

Yanran said in a soft voice, a complicated look in her eyes. She shot at glance at Ye Xuan, as if she had thought of some fun plan.

!!

After noticing Yanran’s gaze, Ye Xuan suddenly felt a little uneasy.

Could it be that this girl was going to cause trouble?

Ye Xuan was not too sure though. After all, he did not know too much about his girlfriend.

Soon it became apparent that something was up.

When Ou Yunhai arrived, he swept his gaze across the surroundings, then flew over to Yanran.

“Little Ran, you’ve actually here. I’ve been looking for you for a long time,” Ou Yunhai said to Yanran with a face full of concern. His eyes were filled with affection.

How could Ye Xuan not understand what was going on when he saw this? Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Could it be that this man was an obstacle to his path to love?

Yanran’s expression seemed to freeze as she spoke very impolitely, “Ou Yunhai, we’re not on good terms at all. Can you please stop calling me that?”

Even after hearing Yanran’s hostile tone, Ou Yunhai continued to lick his lips and smile.

“Little Ran, I understand that you don’t like me. You still think that I am a complete scumbag like before.”

“However, I can swear that from now on, I will turn over a new leaf and pamper you well.”

“I also understand that you only care about cultivation now and don’t want to talk about relationship matters, but it doesn’t matter. No matter how long it takes, I’ll always be waiting for you, okay?”

F*ck!

After hearing this, Ye Xuan had goosebumps all over his body.

This guy was something else alright!

A bona fide simp!

However, to be honest, Ou Yunhai seemed to be quite presentable, and he seemed to be a capable genius as well, so why did Yanran hate him so much?

By his own admission, he had not been a good person before, but to what extent?

Yanran said coldly, “Ou Yunhai! Can you please stop bothering me? Don’t force my hand.”

“What you do has nothing to do with me, so don’t put on an act in front of me. I’m not interested.”

Even though Ou Yunhai felt terrible, he did not say anything. After all, he had heard such words too many times.

After adjusting his state of mind, Ou Yunhai suppressed his anger and consoled himself.

He had to hang in there. As long as he did that, Yanran would eventually relent and give him a chance.

He was the Saint of the Heavenly Wind Divine sect, and there were no shortage of girls chasing after him. Therefore, he was very confident that he would be able to pursue Yanran eventually.

Suddenly, Ou Yunhai noticed Ye Xuan who was standing beside Yanran. Why did they look so intimate?

Ou Yunhai’s face turned frosty as he asked in an icy tone, “May I ask who this little brother is?”

“Oh? You’re asking me?”

Ye Xuan smiled and then said, “I’m Ye Xuan of the Great Wilderness Divine sect. I’m also a simp like you…”

“Ahem, I almost said the wrong thing. It’s a pleasure to meet you, Young Master Ou.”

Hearing this, Ou Yunhai was momentarily stunned. He tried to search for recollections of this person in his memory, but no matter how hard he tried, he could not recognize him.

However, when he heard that Ye Xuan was also from the Great Wilderness Divine sect, his nervousness subsided somewhat.

The reason why the two of them were so close was probably because they were from the same sect.

He had probably misunderstood just now.

“Haha, you’re actually a friend from the Great Wilderness Divine sect. It’s a pleasure to meet you…”

Before Ou Yunhai could continue, Yanran suddenly said, “This is Ye Xuan. He’s my boyfriend.”

At this moment, the entire place fell silent. Ou Yunhai’s face was once again covered in frost.

“Is this true?”

Ou Yunhai’s heart was like a brewing storm. He was so angry that his entire body was trembling.

He really could not believe it. Yanran had always been focused on cultivation, so how did she end up having a boyfriend without his knowledge?

Besides, how could this no-name become Yanran’s boyfriend?

At this moment, Ou Yunhai was trying to calm himself down. He believed that Yanran had said that on purpose to make him leave.

That had to be it.

After all, how could a talented person like Yanran be interested in such an ordinary person?

“What? You don’t believe me?”

“Then I’ll reluctantly repeat it to you. This man, Ye Xuan, is my boyfriend. Do you understand now?”

Yanran turned around to look at Ye Xuan playfully. Then, she hid in Ye Xuan’s arms and even deliberately rubbed her head against his chest. Only then did she look at Ou Yunhai and say, “Ou Yunhai, do you remember what I told you a long time ago? The two of us will never be together.”

“From now on, don’t come over and disturb me. I don’t want my boyfriend to be jealous.”

Hearing this, how could Ye Xuan not understand what Yanran was up to?

This girl was up to no good, and was definitely intending to pit him against Ou Yunhai.

...

That was the truth.

Ou Yunhai’s face turned from white to green, and then to black. He could not wait to kill ye Xuan.
