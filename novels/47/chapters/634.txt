635 Learning Alchemy (Part 2)

When she grew more proficient, she would definitely be able to refine higher grade pills.

On the other side, Zhuge Yueyue was starting to feel overwhelmed. Unlike Feng Xiyun, she did not manage to form any pills on her first attempt.

Feeling a little helpless, she could only look at her teacher and say, “Teacher, I’m not really suited to alchemy. Why don’t I continue to cultivate the Sword Dao?”

Even though she was a little disappointed in herself, her attributes were unsuitable and basically hindered her progress. There was little she could do about it.

After all, everyone was born different. She was suited to cultivate the Sword Dao of the sword, Xiyun was suited for alchemy, and Xiang Yun was suited for…

Cough, cough, she was quite suited for fighting…

Seeing that Zhuge Yueyue really did not want to refine pills, Ye Xuan had no choice but to acquiesce.

“Alright, since you don’t want to refine pills, head back and continue to cultivate your Sword Dao.”

“I also have high hopes for you. I hope that one day, you can inherit my position as sword immortal and become an unparalleled figure in terms of the Sword Dao.”

After hearing this, Zhuge Yueyue was overjoyed. Ye Xuan’s praise was her greatest motivation.

As Ye Xuan’s first disciple, she naturally had to practice her teacher’s sword techniques well.

She hoped that she could become a peerless sword cultivator like her teacher, and dominate the world with her sword.

“Teacher, I will definitely not let you down. Just wait and see. I will definitely become a Sword Dao expert,” Zhuge Yueyue clenched her fists and said.

When it came to sword cultivation, she was far more confident.

“Alright, go back and cultivate. I believe in you.”

Bearing Ye Xuan’s expectations for her, Zhuge Yueyue went to the rear of the mountain to practice her hell slash.

In these less than 30 days, she had to master the hell slash!

As for Feng Xiyun, after she finished refining a pill, she only rested for a moment before starting to refine another..

Ye Xuan had been standing by her side, guiding her and helping to point out her mistakes.

“Ding! As you have taught your disciple the refining method for the soul returning pill, you have received a 10,000x critical reward!”

“Ding! As you have given your disciple a certain number of herbs, you have received a critical reward!”

“Here it comes! Let’s see what my luck is like.”

“Ding! Congratulations. You have obtained the refining method for a high-grade soul returning pill. Do you want to learn it immediately?”

“There’s actually a high-grade soul returning pill?”

Ye Xuan was dumbfounded. He carefully examined the refining method and details, following which, he was beside himself in shock.

“Although this high-grade soul returning pill can’t bring the dead back to life, it can heal any serious injuries and even restore one’s physical strength.”

This was a really good thing to have in a fight!

“Haha. This pill is really not bad.”

After understanding its effects, Ye Xuan was elated. The system’s rewards had all been very pleasing recently. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Ding! Congratulations, you have obtained three rare spiritual herbs and a portion of high-grade spirit herbs..”

After hearing this notification, Ye Xuan was suddenly filled with anticipation.

Eh, it was actually the herbs required to refine the high-grade soul returning pill?

Ye Xuan was stunned. Wow, the system was being really considerate nowadays.

Just as he was immersed in joy, Feng Xiyun suddenly came forward excitedly.

She clutched a few soul returning pills tightly in her hand and shouted happily, “Teacher, I think I succeeded!”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan was shocked and quickly took the pills from her hand and examined them.

“Pretty good…”

At this moment, Ye Xuan looked at his disciple in shock. He had not expected that she would have such shocking talent for alchemy.

This was only her second time refining pills, yet she had refined a few high-quality medicinal pills!

“Cough, cough, these are good. Keep up the good work…”

So far, each of the three disciples he had taken in had their own strengths.

Zhuge Yueyue was good with the sword, Feng Xiyun at alchemy, and Xiang Yun possessed terrifying strength.

“This is only your second time making a soul returning pill, yet you’ve already reached this level. Very good.”

“Xiyun, you’re very talented when it comes to alchemy, but you can’t be arrogant. After all, the soul returning pill you just made is just one of the basic pills.”

“You can refine it a few more times to get yourself familiar with it. After a few days, I’ll teach you how to refine other pills, such as the feather immortal pill.”

After hearing this, Feng Xiyun’s eyes instantly lit up. She was very excited.

She had also heard of the feather immortal pill and knew how powerful it was.

If she could really master alchemy, then she would be able to support the peak in terms of cultivation resources in the future.

“Okay, Teacher, I understand,” she said excitedly. Then, she carried her cauldron back to her room to continue practicing.
