Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

In front of such a terrifying expert, he was just an ant.

At the thought of this, Elder Niejin’s heart was filled with despair.

Yin Susu was also restrained by this force and looked at Ye Xuan in a daze.

She had been worried about who Zhao Yuyan’s teacher was. If he was not as strong as the Sovereign King, then no one would be able to save Lin Qingping and her daughter.

However, not only had the crisis been resolved, but Ye Xuan also had everyone’s lives in his hands.

It was normal for Ye Xuan to be able to restrain her, but she had not expected that he would be able to do the same to the Sovereign King.

Was Ye Xuan really only at the fourth-level unity realm expert?

Countless thoughts flashed through Yin Susu’s mind.

The person with the most complicated feelings in the crowd was the Tower Master, Dai Weibo.

He had always been a cautious person, and after becoming the master of the White Moon Tower, he rarely made enemies.

He had been trying to figure out the identity of Zhao Yuyan’s teacher this entire time, but the thought of it being Ye Xuan had never crossed his mind.

In the Nanzhou Region, Ye Xuan was a famous big shot. How could he have any connection with a jinx?

“Teacher.”

Zhao Yuyan looked at Ye Xuan and blinked her eyes, as if trying to communicate something, but in the end, she held back.

She knew how powerful her teacher was, and she also knew that there had to be cultivators more powerful than her teacher in the Nanzhou Region.

It was precisely because of this that Zhao Yuyan did not dare to reveal Ye Xuan’s identity to others.

However, it seemed that even the Radiant Sky Sovereign King was no match for her teacher. Her teacher was too amazing!

“Yan’er, from today onward, you must remember one thing. The Tianyuan continent is a world where the strong prey on the weak!”

“Only by becoming stronger will you have the right to decide your own fate! If your personality is too gentle, you’ll eventually fall into someone else’s trap!”

“Today, I won’t force you!”

Ye Xuan looked at Zhao Yuyan.

She was still a kid, so it was alright if her personality was a little timid. She would change over time.

“Madam Zhao, please identify those people!”

Ye Xuan glanced at Lin Qingping.

Although Lin Qingping was Zhao Yuyan’s mother, she was only a little older than Ye Xuan.

Upon hearing Ye Xuan’s words, Lin Qingping’s eyes froze. She still had yet to recover from the shock just now.

She was as shocked as the others that her daughter’s teacher was so powerful.

Just what level was her precious daughter’s teacher at?

She did not dare to speculate. This was already beyond the scope of her knowledge.

“Ah, okay…”

Lin Qingping finally came back to her senses.

Lin Qingping could still remember those people who had cursed and insulted her precious daughter very clearly.

She was even more clear in her heart about who deserved death!

Immediately, Lin Qingping took a few steps forward and looked toward the crowd. When she saw the familiar yet unfamiliar faces, her body trembled, not with anxiety, but with excitement!

The day she had been waiting for had finally come. Today, she would finally avenge her daughter and husband.

When everyone saw Lin Qingping’s gaze, their expressions changed drastically, and their hearts were filled with apprehension.

Almost all of the cultivators in the White Moon Tower had ostracized Zhao Yuyan before, so it was a matter of whether Lin Qingping recognized them, or deemed their sin worthy of death.

Their faces turned pale and their foreheads were covered in sweat. Their minds were frantically recalling the past to see if they had gone overboard when messing with Zhao Yuyan.

Back then, no matter how arrogant they were and how much they insulted Zhao Yuyan, Lin Qingping could do nothing about it. At most, she could only kick up a fuss.

However, things were different now. There was an expert behind her, and her words could determine their life and death.

“That person, in order to get rid of Yan’er, hired thugs to kill my precious daughter!”

At this moment, Lin Qingping pointed at a cultivator in the crowd.

It was a young man. When he saw Lin Qingping pointing at him, he shook with fear.

Lin Qingping was right. He had indeed hired some thugs to get rid of Zhao Yuyan.

The reason was simple. He had been unlucky for a few days after accidentally coming into contact with Zhao Yuyan.

Luckily, Zhao Yuyan’s father noticed in time and stopped those thugs.

He did not expect Lin Qingping to actually remember this.

“I’m sorry, I was wrong, please have mer..”

However, before he could finish his sentence, his eyes suddenly lost focus and his body slumped down powerlessly. His body no longer contained life force.

Everyone’s hair stood on end when they saw this.

What had happened?

They only remembered that after Lin Qingping finished speaking, Ye Xuan nodded slightly, and then turned to look at the man, after which that man died immediately.

Could looks kill?

The Radiant Sky Sovereign King was shocked.

Although he did not know what kind of power Ye Xuan had used, he could clearly sense the man’s soul dissipate.

He had destroyed the other party’s soul just like that?

How was this possible?

What made him even more dumbfounded was that he had not felt any spiritual power fluctuations from Ye Xuan.

Terror filled his heart.

He was a unity realm expert, yet he was unable to figure out how Ye Xuan had attacked.

What was going on?

In fact, there was nothing special about it. Ye Xuan had only used his spiritual sense!

The divine forging technique could not only temper a cultivator’s spiritual sense, but it also contained the means to attack with it.

For example, the divine forging technique could transform his spiritual sense into a hammer to attack the opponent’s soul.

The Sovereign King was a second-level unity realm expert, and his soul was quite strong. However, he did not have any cultivation technique to temper his spiritual sense, so he naturally could not detect Ye Xuan’s attack. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“That one too!”

After that, Lin Qingping pointed out more cultivators in the crowd.

The cultivators who had been pointed out dropped dead silently one by one. Although their physical bodies were intact, their souls had been destroyed.

Everyone was scared out of their wits when they saw this strange scene unfold.

Only the Sovereign King had some inkling that Ye Xuan probably had some method of attacking the soul.
