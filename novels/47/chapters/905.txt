906 Here To Save The Day

However, she was very helpless at this moment, as she did not have the power to break the cage.

Once she was trapped inside, Shan Ling casually condensed a giant hand that grabbed Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun.

“Dodge quickly!” Yanran shouted anxiously.

She could only watch as Shan Ling approached the two girls. There was actually nothing she could do.

No one could react in time, and even Lu Xiu could only watch as Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun were captured by Shan Ling.

“Stop him immediately!” he shouted hysterically.

As soon as he finished speaking, everyone attacked together to try and stop Shan Ling, but a burst of the latter’s aura was enough to force them all back.

At the critical moment, a longsword that was emitting a thick blood aura flew over that shattered the giant hand that trapped Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun.

In their panic, Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun’s faces turned pale as they fell from the sky. However, the sword suddenly expanded in size and caught them in mid-air. After that, it carried them back to the ground safely.

Zhuge Yueyue finally came back to her senses, and looked at the sword happily.

“It’s the Godsword. Teacher has finally arrived!”

At this moment, everything seemed like it would be alright again. Simply seeing the Godsword was enough to fill her with a sense of peace and security. It was the same for Feng Xiyun.

As for everyone else, their expressions were mixed. Some of their expressions were filled with relief, while others were filled with fear.

Obviously, they were no strangers to this sword. The one who was the most surprised was Ou Yunhai.

“Ye Xuan…”

When those around him heard him mutter that name, they immediately started looking around, trying to locate Ye Xuan’s figure.

At this moment, Yanran was also stunned. Her previously expressionless face had blossomed into one that was full of joy.

“He finally made it.”

At this moment, all the worries in her heart had dissipated, and she knew that she no longer had to worry about the situation.

Her man had arrived!

As expected, after a moment, the space in front of her began to twist and shatter, and then a figure emerged.

“Oh my god… where did such a terrifying expert come from?”

In the ancient palace, the little monkey, who was constantly paying attention to everything, was also feeling very afraid at this moment. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

However, for some unknown reason, when Wukong saw this person, he felt that this person was rather familiar, which seemed strange to him.

“Have I met this person before?”

At this moment, no expression could be seen on Ye Xuan’s face. His figure suddenly flashed and disappeared, and in an instant, he reached the battlefield.

The moment Ye Xuan arrived, thousands of figures rushed over toward him. They were all disciples of the Great Wilderness Divine Sect.

“Junior Brother Ye!”

Lu Xiu greeted him. With the Sword Elder present, all of the sect’s cultivators were now filled with confidence.

“Who are you?” Shan Ling asked.

Clearly this newcomer was someone important, given the immediate change in the atmosphere when he arrived.

After Ye Xuan took care of his two disciples, he casually retrieved the Godsword. There was still no expression on his face as he looked at the huge monster in the sky indifferently.

After a moment of silence, Ye Xuan made the Godsword float in front of Shan Ling.

“Old monster, do you still recognize this sword?”

Shan Ling’s gaze instantly locked onto the sword. When he discovered the bloody aura it released, his eyes narrowed, and a fearful expression appeared on his face.

“This is… the Godsword?”

“Is this real?

Shan Ling’s haughtiness and arrogance dissipated right at that moment. Perhaps others might not know the origin of this sword, but he had witnessed just how terrifying this sword was.

In that chaotic ancient era, there was a human genius who wielded this Godsword and made a name for himself.

Even when he was fighting against the ten ancient ferocious beasts, he was able to maintain a firm advantage in battle. In that era, this expert was considered a peerless expert, and this Godsword was his chosen weapon.

The number of enemies that had fallen prey to the Godsword was simply too many to count. This sword was a nightmare that many experts did not want to recall. It was due to the feats that the expert had achieved back then that this sword had come to be called Godsword.

Even true immortals would be killed!

Seeing it again today reignited the fear that had been hidden in Shan Ling’s heart for eras.

“This… This can’t be real!”

“Back then, under our combined forces, he died in that battle. Why has his sword appeared in your hands now?”

Shan Ling’s face was filled with disbelief as he spoke hysterically.

Moreover, he could clearly sense that the aura released by this sword was not much weaker than how he remembered it back then. It was still in its peak condition, as if it had not suffered any damage.

With this sword in the picture, even if his true body was able to rush over, it would probably not change the outcome.

After seeing the fear on Shan Ling’s face, Ye Xuan remained silent and calmly had the Godsword return to his hand.

‘It seems that this sword is something famous from the ancient era.’

Ye Xuan could deduce that much from Shan Ling’s words and reaction.
