“Aren’t you being a little ridiculous? You’ve already finished showing off, so you’re leaving the troublesome part to me?” Ye Xuan said angrily.

However, the Thunder-Devouring Beast could not care less at this moment and said with a smile, “Big Brother, you told me not long ago that you would definitely help me get a beautiful partner.”

“Look! Just look at the way that Nine-tailed Sparrow is looking at me! This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I should be close to winning her favor, so you must help me seal the deal!”

“Big brother, it’s time for you to make a move. You have to suppress this little long worm, and then I’ll swoop in at the final moments to teach him a lesson. When that happens, I’ll be able to win her heart for sure!”

Hearing the Thunder-Devouring Beast’s words, Ye Xuan was speechless. He did not know what to say.

“But why don’t you do it yourself? Wouldn’t it be more effective if you defeated him yourself?” Ye Xuan asked unhappily.

After hearing this, the Thunder-Devouring Beast became a little sheepish.

“Ahem, Big Brother, it’s not like you don’t know my abilities. Also, although this little worm is a mixed-blood creature, it’s quite strong.”

“If I could win against it, why would I waste so much time talking to it? I would have just charged at it and beaten it up.”

Since the Thunder-Devouring Beast could not defeat the flood dragon at all, he admitted it openly. Therefore, he could only trouble Ye Xuan to help him. After all, the big boss had to step in to resolve the big problems, right?

Ye Xuan was also very helpless at this moment. In the end, his own words had come back to bite him. Now, he had to live up to what he said. However, he also gained a new understanding of the Thunder-Devouring Beast.

This fellow’s skin was thicker than a chopping board, right? How was he able to act so shamelessly? Who did he learn it from?

Since there was no other way, Ye Xuan stretched his body in preparation for battle. It seemed that he would be able to test out his strengthened lightning-attribute laws and techniques sooner than expected.

After seeing Ye Xuan step forward, everyone began to discuss in hushed tones.

“Why is this kid here?”

“Who is this person?”

It was obvious that many people present did not know Ye Xuan. They had never even heard of him, and were unaware of his strength.

At this moment, an expert chimed in with a serious expression, “That’s Ye Xuan. Outsiders call him Sword Immortal Ye, and he’s the Sword Elder of the East continent’s Great Wilderness Divine sect, and the previous chief of Cloud Sky peak.”

“He shot to fame when he killed a sealed immortal realm expert as an ancient realm expert, which everyone considered to be a miracle!”

“After becoming a sealed immortal realm expert, he even took on the clones of eternal realm experts from the Heavenly Dao World. Furthermore, he has never been defeated before!”

After hearing this, many people were stunned.

“The undefeated Sword Immortal Ye?”

“This kid was actually so powerful?”

“Killing a sealed immortal realm expert as an ancient realm cultivator is indeed miraculous!”

“How terrifying! I can even sense an unparalleled Sword Dao aura emanating from his body!”

“What’s his true combat strength like?”

A white-haired old man waved his hand and replied, “I don’t know what level his true battle prowess has reached. The only thing I know is that he is invincible in this world.”

After hearing this, everyone instantly understood that in this world, it was fine if they provoked others, but they could never provoke Ye Xuan!

Hearing these people’s words, the Nine-tailed Sparrow was also greatly shocked, and turned her gaze over to Ye Xuan, her eyes filled with doubt.

“Is this person really so powerful?”

They were fellow sealed immortal realm experts. However, since she was born, she had never been surpassed by someone within the same cultivation realm.

However, when she examined Ye Xuan, she realized that she actually felt a strong sense of danger from Ye Xuan, even more so than what she felt when she faced the flood dragon.

It was hard to believe that a human cultivator could actually reach such levels of power. Had he already comprehended the power of the laws of the world?

“Ye Xuan?”

As she muttered his name to herself, she watched closely, wanting to see just what was so special about him.

After Ye Xuan appeared, the flood dragon’s gaze also turned to Ye Xuan, which gave the Nine-tailed Sparrow some respite. As the seven-colored light flickered, the Nine-tailed Sparrow transformed into a graceful young lady in a seven-colored dress, exuding an extremely cold aura.

In certain aspects, she could even be compared to Yanran. Seeing this, Ye Xuan secretly praised the Thunder-Devouring Beast’s taste. It seemed that this little brother of his knew what to look for in a partner.

This Nine-tailed Sparrow’s beauty was simply mesmerizing. So mesmerizing in fact, that the Thunder-Devouring Beast even took a huge risk to insult the flood dragon in order to get her attention.

With the flood dragon approaching, Ye Xuan no longer hesitated. He also made his way to the flood dragon. With every step he took, divine lightning flashed under his feet.

Seeing this, the flood dragon became focused. It felt very apprehensive, as it could tell that the man in front of him was very powerful, to the point where it felt pressured.

This was the second time it had encountered someone that made it feel this way. The first was the Thunder-Devouring Beast. However, it soon found out that it was just a facade that was easily uncovered the moment the first move was made.

Was this human the same?

Thinking this, the flood dragon looked at Ye Xuan with a mocking gaze…
