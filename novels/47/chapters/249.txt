Chapter 250: Confusion and Panic

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Whoa!

999x?

Ye Xuan immediately checked out the description of the Great Heavenly Soul Illusion technique.

However, shortly after, he was completely stunned. He discovered that he could not understand this spiritual sense tempering technique at all.

Crazy!

“Phew! Then let’s ignore this for the time being! After all, I haven’t even finished cultivating the Heavenly Soul Nine Revolutions technique,” Ye Xuan said to himself.

Other than performing spiritual power infusion, he had completed everything else.

After that, Ye Xuan suppressed his strength and became his disciples’ sparring partner, allowing them to increase their combat experience.

Of course, as their sparring partner, Ye Xuan would also receive a corresponding reward from the system.

“Having a cheat-like system is awesome!”

“It’s time to clean up the remaining forces of those three major forces!”

“They should have quite a few treasures and resources, right?”

After he was done, Ye Xuan left the training room with Yue and the others.

“You girls should cultivate properly and master your own strength as soon as possible!”

“After I return, I will perform spiritual power infusion for you.”

“Also, you don’t have to worry about me!”

Then, Ye Xuan tore space apart and entered the resulting spatial crack.

In the meantime, the Nether God sect, the Blood Moon Temple, and the Yunjin Temple were in chaos.

Their respective elders were stunned to find that the soul jade tokens of Zhu Tuyuan, Qian Daoliu and Guang Liang had been shattered.

The Yunjin Temple was the first to discover this fact. After all, Guang Liang had died first.

Upon discovering this fact, the entire Yunjin Temple descended into chaos.

Guang Liang was a terrifying pattern condensation realm expert!

How could he have died?

How strong had Ye Xuan become?

It was utterly unbelievable!

As such, the Yunjin Temple’s monks came to the conclusion that Guang Liang’s death had been engineered by Zhu Tuyuan and Qian Daoliu.

However, what was the motive behind this?

The Yunjin Temple immediately mobilized their forces to gather information from the Nether God sect and the Blood Moon Temple.

After a short while, they received the news.

Zhu Tuyuan and Qian Daoliu were still alive!

This confirmed their suspicions.

Qian Daoliu and Zhu Tuyuan had definitely joined forces to kill Guang Liang.

The talk about joining forces to kill Ye Xuan was just an excuse to plot against Guang Liang.

However, what happened after that made them even more confused. After Guang Liang’s death, neither the Nether God sect nor the Blood Moon Temple attacked the Yunjin Temple.

What was going on?

The monks from the Yunjin Temple were filled with doubts.

However, they knew that no matter who did it, the person definitely had a grudge against the Yunjin Temple. Still, no one came over to attack them.

At the same time, the Nether God sect and the Blood Moon Temple also received the news of Guang Liang’s death.

They two were perplexed by this matter, and various speculations emerged regarding the cause of Guang Liang’s death.

Just like that, almost ten days passed.

The people of the three major forces immediately sensed that something was wrong.

Why was it taking so long to kill Ye Xuan? Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

It was 3v1, and they were all patter condensation realm experts!

They suddenly felt uneasy.

After almost a month, they received news that the Tower of Heaven had reappeared in the Qingyun sect, which set off waves throughout the entire Nanzhou Region.

It now made sense.

If Ye Xuan was hiding inside the Tower of Heaven and relying on its powerful defensive capability to survive, then it made sense that the fight was still on going.
