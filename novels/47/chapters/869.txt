870 Hidden Force

This took many disciples of the Great Wilderness Divine sect by surprise, and their admiration for Ye Xuan grew even more.

Martial Uncle Ye was truly too formidable, and had even reached a level that they could not fathom. In the East continent, no, in this world, who could compare to him?

“Teacher!” Zhuge Yueyue was also shocked, and looked at Ye Xuan blankly, who simply smiled and indicated for her to remain calm. Then, he walked out and waved his hand at the sky again, and the power became much denser again.

“I spent a lot of effort to obtain this opportunity, and now, I’ll give it to you. How much each of you can obtain will depend on your own efforts and luck.”

Hearing this, everyone became extremely excited. If they could refine this power, it would definitely benefit them greatly, and would give them a leg up in the martial arts competition against their sister sect.

They were at a disadvantage from the get-go as the East continent’s cultivators were weaker. With this power, they would be able to even the odds.

Even if they remained behind the top geniuses of the other continents, they would still be able to hold their own against geniuses like the little golden-furred growler.

“Thank you for your great kindness, Sword Elder!”

The disciples expressed their gratitude openly. Their voices were like waves that constantly echoed across Cloud Sky peak. Then, the dense power enveloped all of the sect’s cultivators, allowing everyone to benefit from it.

“Hehehe, will it be possible for me to reach the ancient realm?” Gao Shun muttered, which made Ye Xuan turn to glance at him.

Would this fellow become the third ancient realm cultivator of the sect. That would make things quite interesting. After all, the sect lacked top-level experts. Technically speaking, a sect without top-level experts would only have potential, and not true strength.

Sure, he was a sealed immortal realm expert, but he could be regarded as an anomaly, and might not be considered a true representative of the sect’s strength. Therefore, Gao Shun breaking through to the ancient realm could only be regarded as a good thing, and would increase the prestige of the sect. Otherwise, they would be looked down upon.

As everyone absorbed the power, their cultivation levels began to rise. Although the power was mostly useless to Ye Xuan, that was not the case for the rest of these cultivators. What he needed instead was to comprehend and perfect Daos.

Therefore, the best thing to do with this reward was to give it to the sect’s cultivators. That way, it would not go to waste.

After thinking for a moment, Ye Xuan took out a jade stone. As his right hand kept performing a hand seal, his left hand threw the jade stone into the sky. In the blink of an eye, a ray of light instantly enveloped the ground below.

The moment the light appeared, hundreds of figures appeared on the main peak. These figures represented the top fighting force of the Great Wilderness Divine sect and were all made up of elders. These elders were the ones that had been cultivating with Daoist Yi Feng.

However, since Daoist Yi Feng had passed away, and Ye Xuan had become the Sword Elder, they were all under his and Ao Lei’s command now.

Within a few short moments, they reached Cloud Sky peak and knelt.

“Greetings, Sword Elder!”

The group of people shouted in unison. Seeing these hundreds of elders, the disciples present were extremely shocked. Most of these disciples had not been around long enough to know that these elders existed in the sect, so their presence was a complete bolt from the blue.

Seeing this scene, the corners of Ye Xuan’s mouth curled up slightly as he said, “Everyone, please rise. You’ve all protected our Great Wilderness Divine sect for a long time, and have made great contributions. You should also absorb this power.”

After receiving Ye Xuan’s order, the elders became excited. They had sensed the power earlier, but without express permission, they held themselves back. After all, as the sect’s hidden force, they would never show their faces unless the situation was critical. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

It was not only that. They were also very proud, and would not take the initiative to ask for permission to absorb it. However, there was no longer any reason to hold back.

“Haha, Junior Brother Ye, we hear and obey,” an old man said with a smile on his face. Then, he immediately sat down cross-legged and prepared to absorb and refine the power.

Seeing this, the rest of the elders quickly followed suit, not wanting to waste any time.
