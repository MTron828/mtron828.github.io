928 Giving Up

The immortal path was long and exceptionally ruthless. If one was not careful and took the wrong path, it would only result in endless darkness and despair.

When danger arrived, one would quickly understand that not fighting was not an option, and would only result in misery. Many living beings had lost their lives in this way.

The Thunder-Devouring Beast was an auspicious beast with a pure bloodline. Its body was a priceless treasure. Moreover, it was guarding an immortal heavenly treasure. Thus, it was destined to be targeted for both reasons.

The only way for it to survive was to become powerful, more so than anyone who coveted it. Unfortunately, this was not the case. At this moment, Ye Xuan could not help but pity this Thunder-Devouring Beast. After all, it was really miserable.

It had been in this ancient palace since it had existed in this world. After waiting for such a long time, it finally had the chance to escape. However, it suddenly realized that there were many powerful cultivators around it, all of which were plotting to kill it, eat its flesh, and drink its blood.

After going through all kinds of difficulties, it found an immortal heavenly treasure, and wanted to hide away and eat it when it matured to increase its strength.

However, who would have thought that the seal of the ancient palace would suddenly be removed, causing the immortal qi of the Scarlet Blood Spirit Fruit to overflow and attract many powerful enemies?

Thinking this, the Thunder-Devouring Beast felt even more aggrieved. Large tears fell.

Why did only unlucky things ever happen to it?

In the past, when it encountered powerful enemies, it still managed to scare them away by acting tough. However, it had not worked on this human cultivator. What could he do?

‘Heavens, if you really wanted me dead, why did you have to torture me?’

Seeing the Thunder-Devouring Beast fleeing in front of him, still sobbing and reminiscing on its tragic life, Ye Xuan accidentally laughed out loud.

“Pfft, hahaha! I’m sorry, I’m sorry. I didn’t laugh on purpose. When I heard about your experience, I couldn’t hold on for a moment.”

This little fellow, the Thunder-Eater Beast, had a rough life.

If it were anyone else who had heard of this experience, they would indeed feel heartache for the Thunder-Devouring Beast for a few seconds, but after that, the scene of a huge beast sobbing its heart out would get to them.

At the thought of this, Ye Xuan could not hold it in anymore and laughed out loud again.

The Thunder-Devouring Beast’s face darkened, and the anger in its heart had reignited. However, even though it was angry, it did not stop running. It continued to flee into the distance like a bolt of lightning. Despite this, it could not shake Ye Xuan, who was inching closer and closer.

This cat-and-mouse pursuit went on for several hours, but it still was unable to escape Ye Xuan.

“Sigh…”

After running for its life for this long, the Thunder-Devouring Beast had already begun to accept its fate. It then lay on the ground and desperately breathed in the fresh air.

“If you want to kill me, then kill me.”

It gave up struggling because it had already tried its best, but to no avail. Thus, it decided to die a little more comfortably.

This human was really too terrifying. Not only could it not defeat him, it could not escape him either.

“Why don’t you continue running away?”

Seeing that the Thunder-Devouring Beast was already lying on the ground, Ye Xuan did not approach it. Instead, he floated in the sky and asked teasingly.

For some reason, he felt that this Thunder-Devouring Beast was quite to his liking. It would be an amusing subordinate to have, plus he could look cool while riding it.

After hearing Ye Xuan’s question, the Thunder-Devouring Beast almost burst into tears.

“What are you trying to pull? If you want to kill me, then hurry up and stop torturing me.”

“What did I do to offend you? No matter what, I have the bloodline of a divine beast. Can’t you show me some respect and end it quickly?”

It was really crying. How glorious was its ancestor back then? Its ancestor was one of the leading experts and possessed extremely powerful strength. However, things had turned out like this when it reached its generation. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

It did not know how to face its ancestors after dying. They would probably beat it to death with a stick for shaming their noble bloodline, even if they had to crawl out of their graves to do so.

Ye Xuan’s lips curled up slightly, and his expression was calm and collected as he pondered on how to approach this matter.

‘This Thunder-Devouring Beast is a strange beast. Although it has a powerful cultivation level, it spent almost all of its efforts on cultivating a tough exterior appearance.’

“With its strength, even an ordinary sealed immortal realm expert can easily deal with it.”

After exchanging blows with the Thunder-Devouring Beast, he had pretty much figured the other party out. It could not be said that the Thunder-Devouring Beast was weak. It was just that it had no experience in fighting others, so it did not know how to use the vast amount of power in its body.

Therefore, it could only use this power superficially to scare others away. It had a terrifying aura, but that was about it.

However, its overbearing appearance could not only be used to scare the enemy. If used well, it could also be of great use to Ye Xuan.
