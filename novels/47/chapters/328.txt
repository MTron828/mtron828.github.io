329 Getting Stronger (Part 2)

“Ding! As the host has helped his disciple to increase her innate bone value by 32, the host has received a randomized 3x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained 96 innate bone value points!”

“Ding! As the host has helped his disciple…”

System notifications kept ringing in Ye Xuan’s mind. After all of that, he proceeded with giving them heavenly treasures that would allow them to experience epiphanies.

“Ding! Thanks to the host, his disciple has obtained a 27-day epiphany experience opportunity. The host has received a randomized 7x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained a 189-day epiphany experience opportunity!”

!!

“Ding! Thanks to the host, his disciple has obtained an 30-day epiphany experience opportunity. The host has received a randomized 8x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained a 240-day epiphany experience opportunity!”

“Ding! Thanks to the host, his disciple has obtained an 33-day epiphany experience opportunity. The host has received a randomized 19x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained a 627-day epiphany experience opportunity!”

“Ding! Thanks to the host, his disciple has obtained an 46-day epiphany experience opportunity. The host has received a randomized 21x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained a 966-day epiphany experience opportunity!”

Ye Xuan would now be able to remain in a state of epiphany for more than five years!

This would give him enough time to increase his comprehension of supreme intents and engrave them as profound patterns.

The Imprisonment Divine Tower contained destruction and strength intents, which he was particularly keen to engrave as profound patterns.

“Alright! I’m pretty much done for now. You guys should consolidate your cultivation foundations,” Ye Xuan said to his disciples.

His disciples nodded their heads.

They could tell that Ye Xuan was about to enter secluded cultivation again.

“Oh right! Wan’er! This is a seventh-level heart of heavenly lightning, you can take it and refine it. However, don’t do it while you’re in a state of epiphany. That would be a waste.”

Ye Xuan flicked his sleeve, and took out the heavenly treasure.

Her current comprehension value was more than enough to refine the heart of heavenly lightning without the aid of an epiphany.

“Many thanks, Teacher!”

Hearing this, Shangguan Wan’er reached out to take it. With this, she would be able to comprehend seventh-level heavenly lightning intent. Furthermore, she would be able to use it to engrave a profound pattern!

Ye Xuan nodded, then condensed an energy body with the power of his spiritual sense, and then disappeared.

His disciples did not dare to relax. They immediately consumed their heavenly treasures to activate their epiphanies and began to comprehend their respective martial intents.

Prior to this, when Ye Xuan killed several sea race King realm experts in the stormy sea area, it caused a great commotion.

When the sea race sent experts to investigate, they failed to find any traces of the culprit. The possibility of it being Ye Xuan did occur to them, but they had no evidence.

Perhaps only their top experts would be able to trace Ye Xuan’s location. However, how would they dare to bother such experts over this matter?

In addition, after failing to find any concrete information about the other world, Ye Xuan stopped killing those sea race experts, except for those that had detected his disciples’ presence.

Now, as Ye Xuan entered secluded cultivation, the stormy sea area also welcomed a rare period of peace.

However, the war between the human race and the sea race had not ended yet. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

After the incident with Ye Xuan, the sea race had given up on their plan to completely occupy the Tianze Zone, and they had set their sights on the other territories of the human race.

Their goal was simple. They just needed to occupy enough territory.

As the war between the two races continued, countless cultivators died every day.

Although Ye Xuan was in seclusion, through the power of karma, he was able to vaguely deduce what was going on in the outside world.

Still, getting stronger was his utmost priority.

After half a year, Ye Xuan’s strength intent reached the sixth level, following which he spent three days engraving it into a profound pattern.

After that, Ye Xuan spent another year to successfully advance his comprehension of destruction intent to the sixth level, and he also engraved it into a profound pattern.

This vastly increased his strength, and he received another two baptisms of the power of the natural laws.

After engraving those two profound patterns, Ye Xuan’s epiphany was still ongoing, so he circulated the power of karma to forcefully deduce and comprehend life intent!
