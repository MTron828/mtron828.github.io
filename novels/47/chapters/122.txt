Chapter 123: Fairies!

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Soon, the news of the opening of the mystic realm’s entrance spread.

The cultivators, who had been waiting for a long time, all revealed excited expressions as they rushed toward the entrance.

Not long after, the endless forest was filled with cultivators, both weak and strong.

The local demon beasts of the forest were stunned, and instantly fled after sensing the aura of a core formation realm expert.

In the past, these demon beasts were the ones who took the initiative to attack humans, but now the tables had turned!

Was this a f*cking counterattack?

These low-level demonic beasts were not intelligent to begin with, but they could still accurately sense danger, especially when it was life-threatening!

Thanks to this, there was a stampede of demon beasts fleeing from the tide of human cultivators, leaving behind a trail of dust and debris in their wake.

Very quickly, the cultivators arrived at the entrance of the mystic realm in the middle of the forest.

About 30 meters off the ground, spatial ripples hovered in place.

This was the entrance to the mystic realm.

However, no cultivator dared to advance rashly. The spatial gate was not fully formed yet, so if they tried to enter recklessly, they would be devoured by the power of the spatial void.

At the same time, Ye Xuan also arrived with Yue and Li Qingyan.

Their appearance immediately attracted everyone’s attention.

“Ye Xuan!”

“Is that the legendary Ye Xuan? Why is he so handsome?”

“Oh my God! Is he really only 20 years old? My heart can’t stop pounding!”

“Wait, are those two his disciples?”

“They are too beautiful, just like fairies descending to the mortal world!”

“How infuriating! Why are such beautiful ladies not listed on the Great Qian Dynasty’s list of peerless beauties?”

“Hehe, brother, you don’t understand. That so-called list of peerless beauties is such a vulgar thing. How can it be worthy of these two fairies?”

“It is said that when the two fairies entered Ye Xuan’s tutelage, their cultivation levels were not very high. However, under Ye Xuan’s guidance, they became peerless geniuses in less than a month!”

“Are you kidding? Is Ye Xuan’s ability to teach his disciples so awesome?”

“How can this be fake? This is a fact that we all recognize, okay? Brother, aren’t you too ignorant?”

“That’s right! Not only is Elder Ye Xuan young and handsome, he’s also the best teacher in the world!”

“Oh my God! I also want to be his disciple!”

…

As the spatial gate slowly formed, everyone snuck glances in Ye Xuan’s direction and began to discuss enthusiastically.

The girls were infatuated with Ye Xuan’s handsome face, while the guys were deeply impressed by his powerful strength. Of course, the guys also stared at Yue and Li Qingyan.

Ye Xuan listened to the discussions of the crowd. Despite this, he was outwardly calm and expressionless.

‘Aren’t these guys too brazen? Do they really think I won’t notice?’

‘Wait, it seems like everyone is praising me. That’s not too bad then.’

‘Are these guys trying to get me to take them in as my disciples through flattery?’

Screech!

Just as everyone was embroiled in their discussions, a cry suddenly rang out, and then a huge demon beast carrying two cultivators slowly descended.

It was a powerful condor whose body was covered in black feathers.

“It’s the Black Mountain Condor!”

“It’s said that after the Black Mountain Condor reaches maturity, its strength is comparable to an eighth-level purple spirit realm human cultivator!”

“To be able to use such a powerful demon beast as a mount, the identities of these two people aren’t simple!”

Everyone’s gaze turned toward the Black Mountain Condor.

There were not many flying mounts to begin with. Furthermore, capturing a demon beast that had reached the eighth level of the purple spirit realm as a mount, was no simple matter.

After all, the stronger the demon beast was, the higher its intelligence would be! Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Most powerful demon beasts had their own dignity. Some of them would even choose death over becoming someone’s mount.

In any case, not everyone could be like Ye Xuan, who could directly use the system to obtain mounts.

“Hahaha, it’s finally time for the fun to begin!”

“As the saying goes, better late than never!”

On the huge Black Mountain Condor sat two people. One was an old man, and the other was a young man. Both were wearing blood-red robes.

The one who spoke was the young man.

He glanced at Yue and Li Qingyan in the crowd, and a hint of surprise flashed across his eyes, but he quickly turned away and swept his gaze across the crowd.

After a while, his gaze landed on a man dressed in white, and a mocking smile appeared on his face.

“Third prince, we haven’t seen each other in five years. I didn’t expect your cultivation level to still be the same as before. You’re really trash!”
