806 Daoist Yi Feng’s Choice

Based on the current situation, Mengyu was sure that Ye Xuan had the ability to kill her.

Even though she had the immortal bones, it was possible to exhaust its power too. Moreover, there seemed to be no way of blocking Ye Xuan’s move. Even her Devouring Heaven technique was powerless against this move.

However, she did not believe that Ye Xuan would kill her in such a way.

“While using this move, you and I will be in the same time flow. Even if you can kill me, you will be unable to escape the same fate as well.”

“Could it be that you want to sacrifice yourself in exchange for my life?”

“Can’t I?”

Ye Xuan laughed out loud. After hearing those words, Mengyu’s heart trembled continuously.

He was simply crazy. He was actually wagering his life for hers.

“Damn it, you’re crazy!”

Mengyu cursed. Her greatest wish had yet to be realized, so how could she die now?

If Ye Xuan wanted to die, then he should die by himself. She did not want to accompany him to the Netherworld.

Flustered, Mengyu tried her best to break free.

However, before the laws of time, everything she did was useless.

Although she was only stopped by a thin barrier, it was this barrier that made it impossible for her to escape.

Feeling her life force disappearing at an extremely fast pace, Mengyu became even more flustered.

“Go to hell!”

After figuring out that she could not break free, Mengyu made her decision. At the very least, she had to drag Ye Xuan down with her before she died.

Moreover, only by killing Ye Xuan could he escape the restraints of the laws of time in this space.

In the blink of an eye, Mengyu grabbed her demonic sword and tried to stab Ye Xuan.

However, at this moment, Ye Xuan, whose eyes had been closed suddenly opened them. Two sword beams shot toward Mengyu with incredible momentum.

Furthermore. Ye Xuan secretly mobilized his strength and swung his sword, forcing her demonic sword back. Once he did that, he flashed forward and stabbed his sword into Mengyu’s body.

Ye Xuan’s life force dissipated at this moment.

Mengyu shouted hysterically. Ye Xuan’s move just now had also cut off all of her life force.

Most importantly, it had actually severed her immortal bones!

“It’s you?”

Mengyu looked at Yi Feng. She could not believe that Yi Feng would tell Ye Xuan about this. However, only Yi Feng knew where her immortal bones were hidden.

The place where the immortal bones were hidden in her body could constantly change, so even if Ye Xuan’s spiritual sense was monstrous, he could not detect them.

However, the sword move that Ye Xuan had just unleashed still accurately struck her immortal bones.

The reason was that when Ye Xuan unleashed the sword move, Daoist Yi Feng had also activated his power, causing the immortal bones in Mengyu’s body to be revealed. This allowed Ye Xuan to accurately strike his desired target.

At this moment, the entire world once again shone with light. Everyone looked up at the same time and saw two more people falling from the sky

“Could it be the same outcome again?”

This scene was not unfamiliar to them at all, but it was also different.

After all, they could not sense Ye Xuan’s aura at all. It was obvious that the two of them were truly dead at this moment…

At this moment, Zhuge Yueyue silently cried, barely holding her wails in.

She had truly realized that her teacher would probably never appear by her side again.

From now on, she had to take on the responsibility of Cloud Sky peak and take care of her two junior sisters.

At this moment, Zhuge Yueyue felt as if she had lost all of her strength, and she fell limply to the ground.

“First Sister…”

After seeing Zhuge Yueyue’s helpless appearance, Feng Xiyun also cried and hugged Zhuge Yueyue tightly. After today’s battle, Cloud Sky peak’s pillar of support was gone.

The two of them were very sad. Fortunately, Xiang Yun was still unconscious and did not know that her teacher had died. Otherwise, she would have gone berserk again.

At this moment, Daoist Yi Feng slowly regained consciousness and muttered to himself, “Is everything settled?”

Looking at the two people falling from the sky, Daoist Yi Feng could no longer hold on and instantly descended to the ground.

This hatred that had lasted for over a hundred years was finally resolved at this moment…

After a long time, Yi Feng finally stood up and walked to Mengyu’s side.

After seeing that her body had turned cold, her heart was filled with indescribable emotions.

“This scene is familiar, almost like back then.”

However, this time, Yi Feng did not hold back. He mobilized all of the spiritual power in his body and slapped his chest.

Puchi!

Yi Feng instantly spat out a mouthful of blood, causing everyone to turn pale with fright.

Upon seeing this, Ao Lei’s expression changed drastically as he charged towards Daoist Yi Feng.

Yi Feng’s aura erupted, instantly forcing him back.

“Don’t come near me,” Yi Feng said dejectedly.

He did not want to experience such days anymore. All these years, he had been living in a nightmare every day. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

From today onward, he could be considered to have redeemed himself and could reunite with his former brothers.

Moments later, Yi Feng took out a manual. It contained all of the insights he had gained over the years regarding the Dao of Reincarnation. He casually tossed it to Ao Lei.

“Keep this book manual. After you truly comprehend the Dao of Reincarnation, go to the desert region and send the disciples of the Great Wilderness Divine sect who died there into reincarnation…”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yi Feng dug out his own immortal bones without hesitation. Then, he dug out the immortal bones from Mengyu’s body and instantly destroyed them. Vast energy fluctuations swept out.

“Don’t!”

Everyone from the Great Wilderness Divine sect were shouting crazily. They did not want to see such a scene take place.

They had never expected that Yi Feng would destroy both immortal bones at the same time in order to prevent Mengyu from reviving…
