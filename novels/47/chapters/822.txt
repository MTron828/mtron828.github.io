823 Heavenly Transformations

Hearing Ye Xuan say that he was impatient, the little monkey knew that his plan had been exposed. Thus, he told Ye Xuan the truth.

“Teacher, I’ve been cultivating here for dozens of days. Every day, I sit down and meditate on the cultivation technique.”

“I don’t want to continue like this. I want to learn some divine powers. Teacher, please teach me.”

Ye Xuan could feel the little monkey’s urgency and desire.

However, what the little furry monkey did not know was that if it had not cultivated diligently over the past dozens of days, even if Ye Xuan really wanted to teach him divine powers, he would not be able to learn them at all.

Fortunately, the Wu Kong had been cultivating seriously for more than 30 days, so he had rapidly improved and broken through to the heaven realm. Perhaps he would soon reach the mystic lord realm.

Honestly, in terms of potential, even Ye Xuan was a little envious of Wu Kong.

Now that the time was ripe, Ye Xuan did not want to stay here any longer.

‘Forget it, forget it. I’ll teach him some powerful divine powers. From today onward, how he lives will all depend on himself,’ Ye Xuan thought to himself.

He had been on this island for a long time, and it was time to leave.

The corners of Ye Xuan’s mouth curled up slightly as he looked at the little monkey.

“Alright, I know you want to learn divine powers, so I’ll teach you today.”

“However, I’ll tell you something first, and you must remember my words.”

Ye Xuan’s gaze became much more serious, and the little monkey immediately said, “Teacher, I’ll definitely remember what you say.”

“You have a very naughty personality. You will definitely cause trouble in the future. I won’t force you to do anything, but if you really provoke trouble in the future and someone asks who your teacher was, you can’t say that you were my disciple.”

Hearing this, the little monkey was a little confused. He did not know why his teacher said this.

Why is he so certain that I will definitely cause some trouble?

“Do you understand?”

Hearing this, the little monkey instantly quivered and said without hesitation, “Teacher, you don’t have to worry. I’ve already memorized your instructions. Even if I cause trouble in the future, I definitely won’t reveal that you were my teacher.”

Ye Xuan was very satisfied with the little monkey’s answer.

Since Wu Kong had promised, it was settled.

Even though this little monkey was mischievous by nature, his character was worthy of recognition. Since Wu Kong said that he would not expose Ye Xuan’s identity, Ye Xuan would take his word for it.

“Alright.”

“Now, I’ll teach you some divine powers. Tell me, what kind of divine power do you want to learn?”

This stumped Wu Kong. After thinking hard for a while, he still could not figure out what he wanted to learn. Thus, he simply looked at Ye Xuan and said helplessly, “Teacher, I don’t know. Why don’t you choose some divine powers for me?”

“Alright…”

Ye Xuan thought carefully about which divine powers were suitable for the little furry monkey. After some time, he smiled and said, “How about I teach you a sword-type divine power?”

“Sword?”

After thinking for a moment, Wu Kong picked up a branch and started waving it around. However, it did not feel right to him, so he quickly shook his head and said, “No, no…”

Ye Xuan felt somewhat disappointed. He specialized in the Sword Dao and wanted to pass it on, but it seemed that this furry disciple of his was not interested in the sword.

Well, he had better not regret missing out on this opportunity later.

After calming himself down, Ye Xuan said patiently, “If you don’t want to learn a sword-type divine power, I still have a lightning-type divine power. Do you want to learn this?”

Hearing this, the little furry monkey began to let his imagination run wild again. However, he still felt that this was not suitable for him.

“I don’t want this either.”

Ye Xuan was so angry that he wished he could turn around and leave. The divine powers he possessed were all ultimate moves, and countless people would line up for the chance to learn them.

However, Wu Kong was not interested in them at all.

“Teacher, the divine power I want to learn is the most powerful and domineering one,” Wu Kong weakly voiced his thoughts. It was not difficult. He just wanted to look cool and amazing as he defeated his enemies. He did not care about anything else. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Domineering?”

Ye Xuan thought hard for a moment, rummaging through his list of divine powers.

Back then, when he dealt with the white-browed old man, Ye Xuan obtained a heaven-grade divine power called the Heavenly Transformation technique.

After using this divine power, one could increase his body size and strength in a short period of time, making one look very powerful. It was quite good if one wanted to show off, but ordinary people could not bring out its true effects if they cultivated it.

However, this little furry monkey was different. The Invincible Golden Body would work in tandem with this divine power, and might even make this divine power on par with an immortal-grade divine power.

Thinking this, Ye Xuan smiled. This was the one.

“Alright, how about I teach you the Heavenly Transformations technique?”

Hearing this, the little furry monkey was stunned. Just by hearing the name of this divine power, he knew that it was definitely extraordinary.

“Thank you, Teacher. I will learn this divine power,” the little monkey replied excitedly.

Ye Xuan almost laughed out loud when he saw this. In any case, this was an opportunity to earn another harvest from the system, which he was kind of looking forward to.
