731 Each To Their Own

Without sufficient talent, there was no way to pass the assessment of these powerful sects and forces. Even if they volunteered themselves for menial labor, they would require some sort of connections in order to get in.

Thank you readers!

“Well, the most powerful one is definitely the Great Wilderness Divine sect,” a young man said slowly.

He wanted to join the Great Wilderness Divine sect.

“That’s right. The Great Wilderness Divine sect is blessed with great fortune now, so I’m sure they will be able to survive this crisis.”

“Besides, their disciple emerged as the champion of the gathering, so there’s no doubt about their strength.”

“Also, Sword Immortal Ye Xuan is there!”

As soon as he finished speaking, everyone started to get excited. After all, Ye Xuan was famous for being the number one expert in the East continent, and his countless feats and battles only proved his strength.

He had even defeated Daoist Gu Hao at the gathering recently.

“I’ve heard that Sword Immortal Ye has been in seclusion ever since the gathering ended. Do you think he might be trying to break through to the ancient realm?”

“That’s impossible, right? After all, Sword Immortal Ye is still young. How could he have reached the threshold of the ancient realm so quickly?”

Some people were still skeptical about this, but there were also some people who were very sure that this was the case.

They said, “This is very likely to be true. After all, Ye Xuan has an immense amount of fate energy. He can even already be considered to be a chosen one.”

“Besides, his potential is extremely great, and he reached the peak of the supreme realm quite some time ago. Wouldn’t it be easy for him to break through to the ancient realm?”

After hearing this, many people agreed.

“If what you said is true, then with Ye Xuan guarding the Great Wilderness Divine sect, it will definitely be very safe.”

“Besides, if even the Great Wilderness Divine sect can’t escape this crisis, then the other sects and forces won’t be able to escape either.”

As soon as he finished speaking, everyone seemed to have confirmed the goal in their hearts.

They all remembered clearly that the Great Wilderness Divine sect had spread the news that they would soon accept more disciples after the gathering ended.

The crowd maintained a period of rare silence, pondering on what they should do next.

There were indeed many places for them to choose from, but the safest place was the Great Wilderness Divine sect. However, the road to joining the Great Wilderness Divine sect would not be easy.

On the other side of the city, in the Su family’s residence.

Su Tiansheng, who had just received the news, was in a state of deep thought. He looked at the butler beside him and asked, “What do you think about this matter?”

However, Su Tiansheng rejected all of these people without exception. After all, he had to ensure the Su family’s safety first. There were thousands of people in the Su family, and he still did not know how to deal with this situation.

After the butler of the Su family heard the question, he said with a heavy expression, “Master Su, this crisis has arrived too suddenly.”

“Moreover, Qingyang City is right next to the border, and very close to that desert region.”

“If disaster really breaks out, Qingyang City will definitely be the first to bear the brunt.”

“Since that’s the case, we definitely can’t stay in Qingyang City any longer. We have to think of a way to discuss a feasible solution with the people of Cloud Sky peak.”

“Let’s see if we can send the main descendants of the family over first. After this crisis is over, we can rebuild the family again.”

Hearing this, Su Tiansheng also expressed his agreement and said, “Indeed, my thoughts are similar to yours. Yesterday, I instructed Changhe to bring some experts to Cloud Sky peak.”

“Changhe and Zhuge Yueyue of Cloud Sky peak have a good relationship, so it shouldn’t be difficult for them to get permission to stay there.”

At this moment, Elder Liu ran over in a hurry and said, “Master Su, I have already investigated the situation. The truth is just as you said. Many of the famous families in Qingyang City have already found a sect to seek refuge.”

“Among them, the Dai family chose the Jade Lake Divine sect, while the Hong family chose the Supreme Divine sect. They have already packed their belongings and will set off soon. ” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Hearing this, Su Tiansheng sighed.

In Qingyang City, everyone thought that these prestigious families would definitely work together to resist the enemy when they encountered a disaster.

However, who would have expected that before the crisis even arrived, these people had already packed their bags and ran away.

He was also very helpless at this time. He originally only wanted to send out a portion of the descendants to protect them and forget about it. He himself would then stay in Qingyang City.

However, if the other families left, then the Su family had no way of resisting the disaster by themselves.

Helpless, he could only make the same choice as them and ignore the lives of the ordinary folk of Qingyang City.

No matter how unwilling he was, what else could he do?
