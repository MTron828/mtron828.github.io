Chapter 285: Gift Packages

“Teacher!”

When Shangguan Wan’er heard this, she gritted her teeth and repeated herself.

If anyone else saw her like this, their jaws would probably drop. Had the sun risen from the west?

“Ah, my precious disciple is indeed filial. I am very satisfied!”

!!

Ye Xuan revealed a satisfied smile!

“Alright! As my disciple, I will naturally not treat you shabbily in terms of teachings or resources. Wait a moment, I’ll first finish up giving your Senior Sister her stuff, then it’ll be your turn!”

Ye Xuan no longer teased her.

“En!”

Shangguan Wan’er nodded. She looked at Yue and the others beside her. Her heart was filled with a strange feeling.

She had never imagined that she would have three senior sisters who were younger than she was. Moreover, they were weaker than she was in terms of cultivation level. In a certain sense, it was kind of amusing.

In any case, since she had already made her decision, Shangguan Wan’er did not dwell on this matter. She just watched quietly from the side.

After Ye Xuan gave the netherblood hell grass to Yue, he received a bloodsoul dream spirit flower from the system.

Ye Xuan even deliberately waved the bloodsoul dream spirit flower in front of Shangguan Wan’er, seemingly indicating that it would be hers later

Thinking this, Shangguan Wan’er’s heart started to beat faster.

Because Yue and Li Qingyan had never left the Nanzhou Region, and Zhao Yuyan was still young and did not know any better, none of them knew the value of the treasures they were receiving.

However, Shangguan Wan’er was different. After awakening a portion of her memories from her previous life, she was very knowledgeable about these heavenly treasures.

Everyone knew that unless one was fated with such treasures, it was impossible to obtain them.

After giving away the heavenly treasures that increased comprehension value, Ye Xuan gave away heavenly treasures that increased innate bone value, followed by pills, martial techniques, and cultivation methods.

After doing all this, Ye Xuan performed spiritual power infusion on the three disciples.

Shangguan Wan’er felt that her entire worldview had collapsed.

Was being Ye Xuan’s disciple this good?

Where could one find such a teacher?

Although Shangguan Wan’er had also learned about this to some extent through her investigations, seeing it for herself was still shocking.

The last vestiges of resistance in Shangguan Wan’er’s heart disappeared, and her attitude gradually changed.

She admitted to herself that the reason why she agreed to be Ye Xuan’s disciples was because she was interested in the treasures he had.

However, now that she saw how Ye Xuan treated Yue and the others, she was completely won over.

Could she also enjoy such treatment later? Was this guy really that good?

Her eyes were filled with complicated emotions. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

This guy was not stingy with his disciples at all.

Moreover, those girls seemed to be very loyal to this guy.

Furthermore, after Ye Xuan gave them all those treasures, he also helped them refine the treasures as well.

With their current cultivation, his disciples could still refine them alone, albeit with some difficulty. It would just take longer.

However, with Ye Xuan’s help, they would save time, as well as refine it more efficiently.

In just a few moments, they managed to perfectly absorb the energy within the heavenly treasures.

Of course, Ye Xuan also benefited from this, and his attributes increased correspondingly.

However, for the time being, Ye Xuan did not help Yue and the others refine the precious treasures like the Datura flower, netherblood hell grass, and the crimson dreamsoul branch.

These treasures would provide them with epiphany opportunities, so it was best to wait for the right opportunity to use them. Furthermore, they would also increase their chances of comprehending certain martial intents.

For example, if they refined the Datura flower, it would greatly increase the success rate of comprehending slaughter intent.

Therefore, Ye Xuan planned to help them refine it after he had comprehended more supreme intents.

He would benefit more from the system’s rewards in that manner, as he would be able to display the martial intents for his disciples to learn during their epiphanies.

That was the optimal way to maximize the usage of such heavenly treasures.
