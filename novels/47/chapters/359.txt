360 Chaos Heart Technique

“Don’t worry, teacher. I won’t let you down,” Zhuge Yueyue said with a determined look.

Since his teacher placed so much importance on the competition, she had to get a good ranking no matter what.

Now that she had awakened the profound ice divine bone, which was constantly nourishing her meridians, although she could not guarantee that she could win first place in the competition, getting a good ranking was definitely within her capabilities.

“Very good! No matter what the result is, don’t lose heart.”

Ye Xuan nodded in satisfaction.

“The profound ice divine bone has already awakened in your body, and you’re now a first-level mystic meridian realm cultivator. You have also passed the most crucial hurdle, which is to sense and refine spiritual energy.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan took out a cultivation method.

“This is the legacy cultivation technique of Cloud Sky peak. It’s called the Cloud Sky treasure manual.”

“With your current level of talent, it won’t be difficult for you to cultivate it. Of course, if you encounter any problems, you can come to me at any time.”

“Alright, Teacher.”

Zhuge Yueyue nodded her head respectfully and took the Cloud Sky treasure manual. Her eyes were filled with excitement. This cultivation method would be her first step on the path of immortal cultivation.

After that, Ye Xuan taught Zhuge Yueyue the cultivation method, as well as briefed her on some basic things to know as a cultivator. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Alright, go ahead and cultivate.”

“Oh right! From today onward, when the first wisp of purple aura rises in the East, you must come to the mountain peak to cultivate! There are three major tasks for you to complete every day, which is to cultivate, learn about the mystic world, and study divine powers.”

“When you break through to the divine mystic realm, I will teach you the Cloud Sky sword technique.”

Yueyue nodded her head.

Then, Ye Xuan continued, “I’ll be going into seclusion for the next few days. If you encounter any bottlenecks in your cultivation, don’t be anxious or impulsive. Wait for me to come out and resolve them.”

“Alright, Teacher!”

“Mm! You may leave now.”

After that, Zhuge Yue Yue left the small wooden house and returned to her own residence.

As soon as she returned to her room, Zhuge Yueyue opened the Cloud Sky treasure manual impatiently and started to examine the cultivation method.

Within just a few minutes, Zhuge Yueyue had gained a basic grasp of the cultivation method, and was already able to mobilize the spiritual energy in the surroundings and draw it into her body.

She then began to circulate around her body and refine it into spiritual power. She really wanted to reach the divine mystic realm as soon as possible and give her teacher a pleasant surprise.

While Zhuge Yueyue was cultivating, Ye Xuan had already left the courtyard and arrived at a cave on the mountain peak.

This cave was a cultivation abode prepared by Tian Xuan. It was also the place with the densest spiritual energy on Cloud Sky peak.

When Ye Xuan entered the cave, a system prompt rang out in his mind.

“Ding! As the host has given his disciple the cloud sky treasure manual, the host has received a randomized 9,999x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the divine-grade chaos heart technique!”

Woah!

A 9,999x multiplier!

Ye Xuan was completely stunned!

The cultivation methods in the mystic world were divided into heaven, earth, black, and yellow. This divine-grade cultivation technique that he had just obtained had clearly exceeded this limit. This system upgrade was really awesome!

At the same time, countless insights suddenly appeared in Ye Xuan’s mind. It was extremely obscure and difficult to understand. However, thanks to the system, he immediately gained a grasp of the basics.

Moreover, if he used the cultivation method in conjunction with the profound marrow pill, he might be able to advance his cultivation all the way to the materialization realm.

Thinking this, Ye Xuan took out the profound marrow pill he had just obtained, smiling.

“Hahaha! The good days are finally going to start rolling again.”

As Ye Xuan took the pill, a surge of medicinal power flowed through his body, and almost caused his meridians to burst.

“F*ck! It truly is a As expected of a supreme-grade heaven-rank pill. Its medicinal power is so strong, I almost died!”

As Ye Xuan was only a third-level divine mystic realm cultivator, the meridians in his body were still rather fragile.

As the terrifying medicinal power of the pill coursed through his body, blood seeped out of Ye Xuan’s meridians and even his limbs and bones. His expression was one of extreme pain.

After a long time, the terrifying medicinal power of the profound marrow pill finally cleansed all of the impurities inside Ye Xuan’s body. It then turned into a warm current and poured into ye Xuan’s dantian. In the depths of his dantian, a divine Golden Lotus slowly condensed.

Ye Xuan’s expression changed drastically when he saw this.

Although his cultivation had not improved much in the past 100 years, Tian Xuan had taught him a lot of knowledge about the mystic world and about cultivation.

“The Golden Lotus of the Great Dao!”

“Could this be the legendary Great Dao constitution?”

If one were to say that those who possessed God’s bones could be called geniuses among cultivators, those with Great Dao constitutions were existences that were unique throughout the ages.

The Great Dao constitution that Ye Xuan had awakened was one of the top constitutions among the human race.

Most importantly, with the Golden Lotus of the Great Dao, Ye Xuan’s affinity with the Great Dao would increase tremendously.

No matter what kind of profound divine power it was, he would only need to take a glance before being able to completely grasp its intricacies.

Not only that, the Golden Lotus of the Great Dao would continue to absorb the power of the world, which would then be channeled back toYe Xuan, helping him to improve his cultivation level.

How could any divine bone compare to such a terrifying ability?
