Chapter 50: Teacher’s Gifts

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Li Qingyan’s comprehension value was very high, much higher than Yue’s.

“I will heed Teacher’s instructions!”

When Li Qingyan heard his reminder, she nodded respectfully. Her eyes shone. She was still immersed in the joy of obtaining those high-grade martial techniques.

One had to know that even though the Li family was the strongest family in Jiangqing City, most of the martial techniques in their repository were yellow-rank ones. She had never seen such a large number of black-rank martial techniques. Moreover, each martial technique was a high-grade one.

The most advanced martial technique in the entirety of the Li family was only a low-grade black-rank technique, while the Thunder Sword Control technique that her teacher taught her was at low-grade Earth-rank. The difference between the two was not small.

Even the Sword Spirit technique of the Qingyun sect was far superior to the Li family’s best martial technique.

For cultivators, having wealth was undoubtedly extremely important. However, wealth had two aspects to it. One aspect was quantity, while the other was quality.

No matter how bad a cultivator’s talent was, as long as he or she had sufficient heavenly treasures and cultivation resources, they would be able to become a powerhouse of sorts.

However, without the quality aspect of wealth, their cultivation would have an upper limit. If Li Zhengyang’s original cultivation method had been the Sword Spirit technique, his strength would have definitely surpassed his current strength. Although he might not necessarily be able to reach the tenth level of the purple spirit realm, he would have at the very least reached the ninth level of the purple spirit realm.

Li Qingyan had obtained so many martial techniques at once and was slowly digesting them.

Ye Xuan was not in a hurry to examine Li Qingyan’s comprehension of these martial techniques. Instead, he examined the cultivation method and martial techniques he received from the system.

The mid-grade Earth-rank Three Thousand Thunder Sword technique was much stronger than the low-grade Earth-rank Thunder Sword technique. Moreover, the boost to its user’s cultivation speed was even greater.

Most importantly, after cultivating the Three Thousand Thunder Sword technique, the cultivator’s body would contain the power of Heaven and Earth Lightning, which was extremely tyrannical.

......

The Three Thousand Thunder Sword technique was said to be able to summon the power of Heaven and Earth Lightning from the void when it was cultivated to completion. Its wielder would then be able to summon three thousand extremely terrifying bolts of lightning to strike their enemies.

The high-grade black-rank Star Slash was a martial technique that evolved from the Windstorm Sword technique and the Windstorm Slash technique. The user’s sword qi would be transformed into an incomparably sharp slash which could even tear apart the void.

As for the Endless Sword technique, which was high-grade black-rank, it was a martial technique evolved from the Rampart Sword technique and the Three-feet Sword Defense technique. It had extremely potent defensive capabilities. When it was fully mastered, the tip of one’s sword would burst forth with endless streams of water, like rain, creating a defensive barrier around its wielder.

If Ye Xuan could train these two martial techniques to complete mastery, it would undoubtedly provide a great boost to his own strength.

Most importantly, as the strongest genius of the Great Qian Dynasty, Ye Xuan’s comprehension value was even more terrifying than Li Qingyan’s. It would not take long for him to comprehend these newly-acquired cultivation methods and martial techniques.

After a short period of secluded cultivation, he would be able to reach the small success stage. It would not take long for him to break through to the large success stage.

If Ye Xuan’s comprehension value could increase further, it would take even less time.

Moreover, before he left the Qingyun sect, he had learned from Elder Lin Qing that the three great sects were about to hold a competition, so he had been keeping an eye out for it.

The prizes offered by this competition could increase a cultivator’s comprehension value. Such treasures were extremely rare.

However, the three great sects were willing to pay such a price. The comprehension value boost that the treasure could provide was probably limited.

However, that did not matter. After all, Ye Xuan had the system. As long as he personally gave the heavenly treasure to his disciple, would he not receive a better one from the system?

“Well, it’s time for me to give you some pills and heavenly treasures!”

While Li Qingyan was immersed in the comprehension and digestion of her newly-acquired cultivation method and martial techniques in her mind, Ye Xuan spoke up again.

“What?” Hearing this, Li Qingyan was stunned.

To be able to receive such a high-level cultivation method and martial techniques from her teacher was already something beyond her wildest dreams.

After all, any one of the cultivation methods and martial techniques that Ye Xuan had given her could cause a sensation among countless cultivators in the outside world.

Now, her teacher was actually going to give her heavenly treasures and pills?

While Li Qingyan was lost in a daze, Ye Xuan waved his sleeve, and a few pills emitting rich spiritual energy suddenly appeared and fell into Li Qingyan’s hands.

“Ding! As the host has given his disciple an Origin Erosion pill (Grade 2), the host has received a randomized 8x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the Spirit Cleansing pill (Grade 2)!”

“Ding! As the host has given his disciple an Origin Erosion pill (Grade 1), the host has received a randomized 4x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the Blood Fusion pill (Grade 1)!”

“Ding! As the host has given his disciple…”

After Li Qingyan accepted the pills, system notifications kept popping off in Ye Xuan’s mind.

Then, Ye Xuan Thought for a moment, and then took out a jade-white liquid from his storage ring. It was the Mountain Chalcedony he had obtained from the system back then!

At that time, after he had given Yue the Dark Glacial Frost, he had received this heavenly treasure from the system. It could increase a cultivator’s innate bone value to a certain extent. It was an extremely rare heavenly treasure. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“This item can increase your innate bone value. I will give it to you. In the future, when the time is right, I will help you refine it!”

Ye Xuan stretched out his hand and lightly flicked it toward her. The Mountain Chalcedony landed in front of Li Qingyan.

“Ding! As the host has given his disciple the Mountain Chalcedony (one person’s portion), the host has received a randomized 6x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has received the Dark Glacial Heart (one person’s portion)!”

Obviously, the Dark Glacial Heart was also a heavenly treasure that could increase a cultivator’s innate bone value. In terms of quality, it was even more powerful than the previous Mountain Chalcedony.

The most important thing was that the Dark Glacial Heart had some similarities with the previous Dark Glacial Frost. However, the former contained the profound patterns of Heaven and Earth.

“What? Mountain Chalcedony?”

Li Qingyan felt her head buzzing. She was engulfed by a huge sense of happiness. She felt that everything that was happening around here was so incredible. It was like a dream. She was afraid that it would all disappear the moment she woke up!
