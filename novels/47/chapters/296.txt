297 Formation Mastery

Ye Xuan’s eyes lit up.

He would be able to achieve seventh-level heavenly lightning intent with this!

“You have only comprehended the embryonic form of heavenly lightning intent, so if you refine this by yourself, it will take you at least one or two years.”

“During this period, there might be sudden changes in the Qingyun sect.”

“That being said, don’t worry, when the time is right, I will help you refine it!”

Ye Xuan looked at Shangguan Wan’er and smiled.

Through the power of karma, Ye Xuan could vaguely predict the future of those with strong karmic ties to him.

If Shangguan Wan’er chose to refine it immediately, there was a high possibility that she would be affected by the sudden changes and be forced to halt the refining process, wasting it.

However, as he had only comprehended the embryonic form of karmic intent, he could not sense the time and place of the future changes too clearly.

All he knew was that it would happen within the next one or two years.

“Alright, Teacher!” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Shangguan Wan’er nodded obediently.

She no longer doubted Ye Xuan’s intentions after experiencing his generosity.

“Ah, also, if you don’t mind, I’d like to see your accomplishments in alchemy, artifact refining, and formations.”

Hearing this, Shangguan Wan’er was stunned.

Could it be that her teacher also had great attainments in these three fields? Did he want to see what level she was at before giving her advice?

“Transmit your knowledge of the three fields to me. After that, demonstrate what you’re capable of, and I’ll help point out the flaws,” Ye Xuan said in a serious tone.

“I will heed Teacher’s instructions!”

Shangguan Wan’er did not doubt Ye Xuan’s words, and she reached out her finger to touch Ye Xuan’s forehead.

Moments later, her knowledge in the fields alchemy, artifact refining, and formations, poured into Ye Xuan’s mind.

Ye Xuan closed his eyes and slowly digested the information.

When he felt that it was about time, he opened his eyes and motioned for Shangguan Wan’er to begin her demonstration.

Over the next few days, Ye Xuan watched Shangguan Wan’er refine pills, refine artifacts, and set up formations.

Although she had not fully recovered the memories of her previous life, she was still extremely skilled in these three fields. Even Ye Xuan could not help but marvel.

Whether it was artifact refining, alchemy, or the art of formations, the requirements for these three fields were the same. Cultivators had to reach the true essence realm before they could start practicing them.

Shangguan Wan’er’s artifact refining skills had reached the fourth grade, and she could already forge high-grade magic artifacts.

The weapon that Shangguan Wan’er had been using previously had been refined by her personally.

In addition, Shangguan Wan’er’s mastery of alchemy and formations had reached the fifth grade.

Fifth-grade pills were very helpful to the cultivation of pattern condensation realm experts, and formations of that level were useful in terms of attack and defense, especially for large-scale battles.

“You’re quite skilled. What you’re lacking now are basically formation diagrams, pill recipes, and forging materials,” Ye Xuan commented.

Of course, his words were simply nonsense.

“You should go into secluded cultivation for now. When the time is right, I will give you those things,” Ye Xuan continued.

“Many thanks, Teacher!”

Hearing this, Shangguan Wan’er was overjoyed.

She did not expect her teacher to be so proficient in these fields.

Honestly, who would not love such a teacher?

After Shangguan Wan’er left, Ye Xuan called Yue, Li Qingyan, and Zhao Yuyan.

Now that he had obtained the skills in the three fields from Shangguan Wan’er, he naturally had to teach them to his disciples to obtain rewards.Otherwise, how could he show off in front of Shangguan Wan’er?

He was looking forward to the system rewards he would receive.

Without the existence of the system, Ye Xuan would not have been able to branch out and learn so many different things.

Honestly, what Ye Xuan needed the most at the moment was the ability to set up formations.

This was because Ye Xuan knew very well that, whether it was Shangguan Wan’er’s Undying Xuan Huang sword physique, or the higher-level sword constitution he was about to obtain through the system’s rewards, both would definitely cause a heaven-shaking phenomenon when they were awakened.

As a formation master, he would be able to set up a formation to conceal the phenomenon and avoid attracting the attention of other experts, especially King realm experts.

This would prevent a great deal of future trouble.

Then, as per usual, Ye Xuan started distributing techniques, heavenly treasures, and the like to his disciples, followed by spiritual power infusion.

Although the speed of his disciples’ advancements was rapid, the gap between them and Ye Xuan was growing wider. After all, Ye Xuan’s system rewards had a multiplier, which was further compounded by the fact that he could earn rewards from all four disciples.

With Ye Xuan’s current cultivation level, a few dozen days’ worth of his cultivation was enough to allow Yue and the others to multiple breakthroughs in their cultivation.

Of course, he would still have to monitor the amount of cultivation boost rewards he would obtain in return to avoid any mishaps.

His current physical strength, and the amount of spiritual power his dantian could contain, was no weaker than a Human King realm expert. Still, he was finding it troublesome to maximize the benefits of spiritual power infusion.

The limiting factor was no longer his disciples, but him. As such, he had to find a way to further strengthen his body. After all, the speed of improvement was too slow if he only relied on the lightning bolts to temper his body.

Other than that, he would have to wait to engrave his next profound pattern to receive another baptism of the power of the natural laws to strengthen his body.
