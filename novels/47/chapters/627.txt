628 Increased Potency

So far, the only geniuses that Zhuge Yueyue knew of were Mu Beichen and the Reincarnation Fairy.

“Teacher, you don’t have to worry about this matter. I’ve already made preparations and will bring honor to Cloud Sky peak,” Zhuge Yueyue said with a determined expression.

Seeing her confident expression, Ye Xuan patted her head and carefully removed the leaves that had fallen on her head as she was cultivating.

“Alright, you’ve always made me proud. Just remember not to be complacent and get yourself hurt,” he said softly.

“This world is huge, and there are many geniuses you don’t know of. Always cultivate knowing that there might be someone stronger than you out there.”

“The gathering is the best place to experience this. Geniuses from all over the world will be there, and you will get to compete with them.”

Zhuge Yueyue nodded her head. She had never been arrogant, and understood that her potential might be lacking in comparison to other geniuses, but it mattered not.

She had the best teacher in history. This was her trump card, and also the source of her confidence.

“Alright, please bring Xiang Yun over here.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan began to make another vat of body refining solution. In order to advance his own body refining cultivation, he needed the system’s rewards, which he could only obtain from helping Xiang Yun with her own body refining cultivation.

Zhuge Yueyue only wanted to cultivate the Sword Dao, and Feng Xiyun was not suited for body refining cultivation. Therefore, only this lively third disciple of his would be able to help him with this.

The only regretful thing was that Xiang Yun still did not know how to read.

Sigh…

While Ye Xuan was deep in thought, Zhuge Yueyue arrived with a sleepy-looking Xiang Yun.

“Big Sister, why did you drag me here in such a hurry? I haven’t even woken up properly yet,” Xiang Yun said unhappily.

She had completely exhausted herself yesterday, and really wanted to sleep in. Waking up at sunrise was the last thing on her mind.

Zhuge Yueyue simply replied patiently, “Third Sister, morning is the best time to cultivate.”

“Since you’ve already decided to become a cultivator, how can you just laze around and sleep? Don’t you want to be invincible among your peers? Pull yourself together.”

When she heard her favorite catchphrase, it was as if she had been injected with a stimulant, and she suddenly became energetic.

“Hehe, very well, Senior Sister. Don’t you worry. I will definitely become invincible among my peers”

Then, she walked over to Ye Xuan and asked with a puzzled face, “Teacher, what should I do today?”

“Continue to soak in the cauldron like yesterday.”

“The only difference is that the herbs in the solution today are much more potent than yesterday. If you can absorb all of their medicinal power, then I’ll allow you to have fun for a few days,” Ye Xuan replied with a smile.

The herbs he had used to make the body refining solution this time were extraordinary. If she could refine all of their medicinal power, she would easily be able to break through and reach the materialization realm.

Ye Xuan’s confidence in her potential was the reason why he had decided to increase the potency of the solution.

If she really succeeded, it would be even easier for her to cultivate in the future. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

It was much harder to practice body refining cultivation as opposed to spiritual cultivation. If they were lacking talent, resources, or even the ability to concoct solutions, the journey would be an arduous one.

This was the difference between spiritual cultivation and body refining cultivation. Ye Xuan intended for Xiang Yun to cultivate both, but first she had to learn how to read.

With her level of talent, it was achievable.

Xiang Yun’s eyes seemed to light up when she heard that she could go out and play for a few days.

“Teacher, you’re not lying are you?” she asked expectantly.

Ye Xuan rubbed her head and said, “You know that I wouldn’t lie about such things. If you really manage to do it, I will honor my words.”

“Alright!”

It was just a pile of herbs. She had already refined some yesterday, so she would definitely be able to do it again easily today!

Seeing her confident expression, Ye Xuan could not help but smile and think to himself, ‘Try your best, but don’t cry later.’

In this cauldron containing the body refining solution, Ye Xuan had added in two high-grade spiritual herbs and other miscellaneous herbs. The potency had risen significantly as a result, and the temperature also rose sharply.

Before Ye Xuan could warn her, she jumped into the Boundless Cauldron.

In the blink of an eye, she jumped right out again.

“Wuwuwu… Why is it so hot?”

She shouted as she ran around the garden, trying to cool off.

After realizing that it did not work, Yin Yun jumped into the pond.

Seeing this scene, Zhuge Yueyue was startled.

Was body refining cultivation so painful?

Fortunately, she was literate.
