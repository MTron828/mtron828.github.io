“So don’t worry, you can keep the treasures you obtain for your own use, okay?”

Thank you readers!

After hearing Ye Xuan’s words, Xiang Yun was no longer hung up about the matter and began to peruse the golden crystal in her hand.

Turning around, she then ran over to Zhuge Yueyue and said, “First Sister, when we return to Cloud Sky Peak, can you help me embed this crystal into my bed?”

“I want to sleep soundly every day!”

Zhuge Yueyue really wanted to know what was going on inside her third sister’s head. Everything she said seemed to upend common sense.

!!

“Alright, alright. We’ll do it when we get back.”

Ye Xuan put away his purple crystal and looked around. He realized that everyone was still shellshocked, and sniggered.

This trip had been a very worthwhile one, and now that he had the purple crystal and the chaos immortal peach, he was ready to break through and reach the ancient realm.

The gathering had come to an end, and it was time to return.

However, before everyone left, the experts from the other factions and sects all gathered around the Great Wilderness Divine sect’s forces with smiles on their faces, clearly trying to forge a better relationship with them and leave a good impression.

“Haha, congratulations! Sword Immortal Ye’s disciple truly possesses boundless talent. This victory is well-deserved.”

“Sword Immortal Ye, your current cultivation level is already unsurpassed. I’m afraid that it won’t be long before you reach the ancient realm. I would like to congratulate you in advance,” Liu Xinghe came over and said with a smile.

Ye Xuan smiled and said, “Thank you for your kind words! I hope that I can really break through.”

Daoist Xu Yun also came over and said, “Little Brother Ye, you’re being too humble. With your potential, it won’t be difficult.”

“I’ve lived hundreds of years in my life and have seen and heard all kinds of things. However, this is the first time I’ve seen someone with your level of talent.”

“Although you’re still young, you’re about to achieve something almost no one in the East continent will be able to achieve in their lifetime. Make us proud by becoming the East continent’s first ancient realm expert”

Daoist Xu Yun’s praise was not exaggerated at all.

From the moment he met Ye Xuan, Ye Xuan had shocked him again and again.

Ye Xuan smiled and replied, “Haha, Daoist Xu Yun, you’re being too polite. Although I don’t know if I can do it, I will try my best.”

Hearing this, Daoist Xu Yun smiled happily.

“If you have time, you can visit the Jade Lake Divine sect. I’ll bring out the best tea leaves and have a few cups with you.”

“Alright, then have a safe journey, Daoist Xu Yun.”

After watching the others leave one by one, Ye Xuan sighed inwardly.

If his teacher was still alive, he would probably be smiling from ear to ear.

No matter what, Ye Xuan’s disciples performed well enough to make anyone proud, and brought glory to the Great Wilderness Divine sect.

His spirit in heaven would probably be very happy.

Sigh…

After seeing that Daoist Xu Yun had left, Chu Batian also came to bid together with the Reincarnation Fairy.

“Little Brother Ye, the results of this gathering have really opened our eyes. The Great Wilderness Divine sect is really going to shoot to fame after this.”

“Moreover, I was fortunate enough to witness how great your disciples are. Truly admirable,” Chu Batian said with a smile.

Although the Reincarnation Fairy had successfully obtained the legacy of the Saintess, she failed to obtain the coveted champion position thanks to Zhuge Yueyue’s efforts.

Because of this matter, her confidence had taken a blow, as she had believed herself to be invincible after inheriting the Saintess’ legacy.

Chu Batian was actually also very bitter. He had painstakingly prepared her for this gathering, yet she had lost. It was difficult to accept.

“Elder Chu, your words are too kind…”

Before Ye Xuan could finish, Gao Shun immediately interjected loudly, “Our Great Wilderness Divine sect has always paid great attention to the cultivation of disciples since ancient times. If you’re free in the future, you’re welcome to visit our sect for reference. We will welcome you with open arms.” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

After hearing this, the other forces present were at a loss for words. That was clearly a recruitment message targeted at their geniuses!

If their geniuses went there to visit, they would likely end up staying there forever!

Damn this shameless guy!
