401 Strange Power

After that conversation, Feng Xiyun’s troubled heart immediately calmed down.

As long as she had her teacher by her side, she would be content.

“Silly girl, don’t cry.”

“As long as I’m here, I will never allow anyone to force you to do anything. You can live your life as you please. I will stand behind you and support you,” Ye Xuan said with a gentle expression.

At the same time, a cold light flashed in the depths of Ye Xuan’s eyes.

He had heard of the Sky Wave mansion of the Yangli divine empire, which was the organization tasked with pursuing Feng Xiyun.

It was an extremely powerful organization whose purpose was to help the divine empire deal with matters covertly.

In the East continent of the mystic world, it was a powerful deterring force. However, from Ye Xuan’s perspective, it was not worth his time.

Ignoring the fact that the Sky Wave mansion could not afford to offend the Great Wilderness Divine sect, Ye Xuan alone was not someone the Sky Wave mansion could afford to offend.

After all, Ye Xuan was now an early-stage mystic lord realm expert.

In addition, he had the Dao fruits, the Cloud Heaven sword, and the Flora Sword technique.

Cultivators below the mystic lord realm were simply no match for him.

When Feng Xiyun heard this, she was even more touched and said with some affection.

“Teacher, can I hug you for a while?”

After saying this, Feng Xiyun felt a little embarrassed.

She was the princess of the divine empire, how could she be so unreserved? However, at this moment, she really wanted to hug her teacher, who was the source of her newfound security.

Hearing this, Ye Xuan’s mouth twitched. What kind of ridiculous request was this?

This was very unbecoming of their relationship. However, he decided to go with the flow.

“Ahem, ahem, just a quick one,” Ye Xuan said as he pretended to be calm.

Hearing this, Feng Xiyun’s eyes flashed with joy as she snuggled into his arms.

‘What a warm embrace. I really want to stay in Teacher’s arms forever!’

In the meantime, Ye Xuan was doing his best to stifle his involuntary physical reactions.

When Ye Xuan was on the Tianyuan continent, he had taken in a few disciples and had even hugged a few of them.

However, Yue, Qingyan, and Zhao Yuyan were still very young, so he had not been overly conscious about the matter. Feng Xiyun was a peerless beauty.

Still, he was her teacher, and he somehow managed to keep a straight face.

…

Several days later, in a desert within the East continent, bones and flesh were scattered everywhere, and the smell of blood filled the surroundings.

Under the rocky ground, a fire lizard slowly poked its head out, wanting to breathe in some fresh air.

At this moment, dazzling sword qi descended from the sky and cut off the head of the fire lizard.

The fire lizard died with its eyes wide open. The sword strike was too sudden, and it had no time to react.

It was not until the moment the head fell that the fire lizard saw its murderer clearly. It was a beautiful woman in a sky-blue long dress wielding a longsword.

Ta ta ta!

The sound of shoes stepping on the gravel lightly rang out. After a few moments, three figures suddenly appeared in front of the fire lizard.

“Teacher, it’s exactly as you guessed. This fire lizard also has a strange power,” Feng Xiyun said to Te Xuan after briefly examining the fire lizard’s corpse.

After that night, Feng Xiyun seemed to have changed into a completely different person. Her previous worries were all gone.

Now that she had a teacher who doted on her, and a cold yet gentle Senior Sister by her side, she was content and happy.

Just then, Zhuge Yueyue, who was hovering in the air, slowly descended and stood quietly in front of Ye Xuan. She did not say anything.

After this period of training, Zhuge Yueyue’s cultivation had already reached the first level of the materialization realm.

Even Ye Xuan was surprised by Zhuge Yueyue’s speed of breaking through.

Fortunately, he had a cheat-like system. Otherwise, this girl would catch up to him in no time at all.

“That’s right. From the looks of it, the berserk beasts’ attacks should be related to this strange power.”

“The strange power is an ominous sign. Who is behind this?”

Ye Xuan nodded, his expression solemn.

During this period of time, he had been traveling with them to investigate the truth behind the berserk beasts’ attacks.

After he had personally killed several beasts, he discovered that there was a strange dark aura residing in their bodies.

“But why would someone incite these beasts to attack? There has to be a larger scheme behind it all.”

Ye Xuan touched his chin and pondered the matter for a long time, but he could not think of anything.

Even he did not know where the strange power in the beast’s body came from.

From the looks of it, it would not be easy to investigate the truth of this matter.

At the very least, it would take much longer than he expected. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Furthermore, there were only 30 days left until the Seven Peaks competition.

That being said, Zhuge Yueyue’s progress had satisfied him. Not only had she successfully broken through to the first level of the materialization realm, but her Cloud Sky sword technique had reached the minor mastery stage, and she had obtained precious combat experience.

He was confident that she would be able to deal with Gao Tianyu during the competition. Her strength would shock the Great Wilderness Divine sect.

As for Feng Xiyun, because she had just stepped onto the path of cultivation, it would be quite difficult for her to obtain a good ranking during the Seven Peaks competition.

However, during this period of time, Feng Xiyun had continued to refine the power within the precious bone, and her cultivation level had been progressing well.

Within just a few days, Feng Xiyun had already broken through to the third level of the divine mystic realm.

It was about time to teach this girl some divine powers.

“Teacher, what should we do now?”

Zhuge Yueyue’s expression was a little sullen.

From the looks of it, there was no hope of finding the culprit behind the berserk beasts’ attacks anytime soon. However, Zhuge Yueyue knew that her teacher had done his best.
