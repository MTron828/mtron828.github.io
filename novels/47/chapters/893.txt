894 Xiyun Battles Shan Hai

At this moment, everyone from the East continent joined the party. They could not tolerate this arrogant lightning tiger anymore.

However, thousands of lightning tigers suddenly appeared in the sky.

“You’re just a bunch of ants, yet you dare to insult noble creatures like us?”

Among the group of lightning tigers that had rushed over, there were even many who had already reached the mystic lord realm.

At this moment, a great battle was about to break out, but Shan Hai’s gaze was still fixed on Feng Xiyun.

“Today, no one can save you from death!”

Shan Hai’s words were filled with killing intent. After saying this, he immediately attacked Feng Xiyun.

Feng Xiyun’s expression was extremely solemn at this moment. She had maintained her full concentration throughout the entire process. After all, she knew very well that if she were to make a mistake when dealing with an ancient realm expert, she would definitely die.

However, judging from the current situation, she was not completely powerless against him.

At this moment, the immortal bones in her body were releasing a shocking amount of energy that constantly surged through Feng Xiyun’s body.

As it did, Feng Xiyun closed her eyes tightly, as if she was undergoing some kind of sacred ritual. Under the effect of the immortal bones’ energy, the Heaven Burning Flames in her sea of consciousness had become more than 30 times stronger!

The corners of Feng Xiyun’s mouth curled up slightly.

“Teacher was right. The immortal bones in my body contain endless energy, and only when my life is in danger can I truly unleash their power.”

Feng Xiyun’s confidence grew.

“Hehe… a peak-level ancient realm expert? So what? I’ll still beat you up!”

As soon as she finished speaking, Feng Xiyun activated the Boundless Palm technique and infused it with her Heaven Burning Flames. Monstrous flames surged into the sky, turning it crimson-gold.

“It’s actually the Boundless Palm!”

Seeing this, Lu Xiu was stunned. He was not unfamiliar with this move, but it was one of Ye Xuan’s signature abilities. When did Feng Xiyun master it?

As Feng Xiyun’s hands were constantly performing seals, her aura swept out, and it was not much weaker than Shan Hai’s aura.

“Go!”

Feng Xiyun opened her eyes, and the Heaven Burning Flames crashed into the huge cage, destroying it.

Seeing this, a look of shock appeared on Shan Hai’s face as he was forced to take a few steps back. Feng Xiyun’s Boundless Palm was exquisite, and even briefly gave her the upper hand.

In the sky, Ou Yunhai’s eyes were also filled with disbelief.

“This little girl’s strength is actually so shocking. This… Could it be immortal bones?”

He had never expected that the second disciple of the Cloud Sky peak, who was not famous at all, would have something as powerful as immortal bones.

With such terrifying potential, she could become a Saintess in any faction.

“Damn this Ye Xuan! Not only does he have heaven-defying potential, but the disciple he accepted is also equally as talented. Could it be that I really can’t compare to him?”

At this moment, Ou Yunhai was looking at Feng Xiyun’s immortal bones, his eyes filled with greed.

However, he did not choose to attack at this moment. Instead, he wanted to see just what she could do in this current situation.

With the combined power of the Boundless Palm and the Heaven Burning Flames, Feng Xiyun had already suppressed more than half of the lightning tigers by herself, and was clearly playing a pivotal role in the battle.

Seeing more and more lightning tigers being killed, Shan Hai was infuriated.

“All of you must die!”

At this moment, he no longer cared if the Heaven Burning Flames burned his body. He passed through the wall of flames Feng Xiyun had erected and attacked her suddenly.

“Dodge quickly!”

Feng Xiyun was dealing with the other lightning tigers, but when she heard that shout, she immediately turned around to meet the attack. However, someone had already rushed in front of her.

Boom!

With a muffled sound, Lu Xiu instantly fell from the sky and landed on the ground. It was difficult to tell if he was dead or alive.

“Martial Uncle Lu!”

After seeing this, Feng Xiyun’s eyes instantly became bloodshot. A monstrous flame erupted, as her body began to pulse with power.

“You old fart! I will definitely kill you!”

With a furious roar, Feng Xiyun condensed a huge palm imprint and slammed it towards Shan Hai.

However, Shan Hai’s eyes were filled with disdain, as he too condensed his own palm imprint to meet Feng Xiyun’s attack.

Boom!

After the two palm imprints collided, a huge explosion erupted, stirring up giant waves throughout the East Sea.

“Even if you have a heaven-defying cultivation technique, your cultivation level is insufficient.”

“With your supreme realm cultivation, you still dared to think you could defeat me, a peak-level ancient realm expert? How preposterous!” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Shan Hai’s eyes were filled with arrogance. He instantly released bolts of divine lightning again, condensing a cage that trapped Feng Xiyun inside.
