332 Eighth-Grade Formation Master

“Thanks, Teacher,” Zhao Yuyan replied happily. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Buzzzzzz!

Moments later, Ye Xuan’s spiritual sense swept out and helped Zhao Yuyan refine the Void Divine Tower.

When Zhao Yuyan gained complete control of the Void DIvine Tower, her vision returned to normal.

“Ding! As the host has given his disciple the Void Divine Tower (high-grade holy artifact), the host has received a randomized 3x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the Destiny Divine Tower (high-grade holy artifact)!”

‘Finally, a decent harvest!’

Ye Xuan felt it for a moment, and his eyes lit up.

The Destiny Divine Tower contained fourth-level spatial and fate intents.

Although the spatial intent was useless to Ye Xuan, it was a different story for fate intent.

The reason why the sea race attacked the human race’s territory was to steal their fate.

The existence of fate was illusory, but if one could grasp fate intent, one could change the fate of others.

Under the influence of the power of fate, a cultivator who was originally unlucky could very likely transform into a peerless genius with the blessing of great fortune.

Other than that, if one’s comprehension of fate intent reached a certain level, one could forcefully steal the fate of others.

‘Awesome!’

Ye Xuan revealed a satisfied expression, then refined the Destiny Divine Tower.

Even though he did not possess fate intent yet, he could still steal the fate of others with the help of the Destiny Divine Tower.

However, he would leave that for another day.

The most important thing now was to awaken Shangguan Wan’er’s Undying Xuan Huang sword physique.

Thus, he began to teach his disciples formation mastery. He had to increase his level of formation mastery in order to conceal the heavenly phenomenon that would erupt when both their special constitutions awakened.

Time flew by, and three months had passed.

After several rounds of monthly teachings with his disciples, Ye Xuan was now a sixth-grade formation master.

However, he was not satisfied with this.

Even a top-tier sixth-grade formation would only be able to conceal the phenomenon from lightning tribulation realm cultivators.

A year later, Ye Xuan finally became an eighth-grade formation master after twelve rounds of teaching.

Even though it was only at the elementary-level, it was an existence already comparable to the great emperor realm experts of the Tianyuan continent.

Normally, only those who had broken through to the great emperor realm would have a chance to come into contact with eighth-grade formation masters, alchemists and artifact refiners.

‘I’ve finally broken through!’

Ye Xuan took a deep breath, and a hint of excitement flashed across his eyes.

In the past year, although he had spent most of his energy on improving his formation mastery, he had also made great progress in terms of alchemy and artifact refining, both of which had reached the skilled level of the seventh-grade.

Apart from that, he also continued his regular spiritual power infusions and gifts of heavenly treasures and cultivation resources.

His disciples had also become quite skilled in the three fields of study.

“My precious disciple, it’s time for you to follow me to do something big!”

Ye Xuan looked at Shangguan Wan’er with a smile.

“Alright, Teacher.”

She nodded.

“However, before that, you have to enter secluded cultivation and adjust your body to its peak state!”

“When you’re ready, I will help you to awaken your sword physique,” Ye Xuan said with a smile.

“Got it! Thanks, Teacher!”

Hearing this, Shangguan Wan’er’s eyes lit up.

“There is also a special constitution lying dormant in my body. When the time comes, I will awaken it with you.”

“You should adjust your body’s condition first. When the time is right, I will look for you,” Ye Xuan continued.

‘Teacher has a dormant special constitution too?’

Hearing this, a look of realization flashed across Shangguan Wan’er’s eyes.

‘That’s right, how could someone as powerful as Teacher not have a strong special constitution?’

However, her teacher’s strength had already reached such a terrifying level, yet he had not awakened the special constitution.

Did that not mean that the dormant special constitution in his body was extremely terrifying?

When she thought of this, Shangguan Wan’er was filled with curiosity, and she looked forward to the day when she would see what kind of special constitution her teacher had.

“Teacher, I’ll head off into seclusion now,” Shangguan Wan ‘er responded, and then her figure suddenly disappeared.

“En!” Ye Xuan nodded, then stepped into the spatial turbulence.

He wanted to set up a concealment formation personally.

At his current level, an offensive formation he set up could threaten the life of a great emperor realm expert.

Moreover, if Ye Xuan combined his formations with his spatial intent, he could create a space that was independent of the Tianyuan continent. The spatial barriers that space would have would be far tougher than the spatial turbulence, which could be torn open by fourth-level unity realm cultivators.

However, what Ye Xuan wanted to set up was a concealment formation, which could forcibly suppress the heavenly phenomena that would ensue once their special constitutions awakened.
