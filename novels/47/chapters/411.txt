412 The Might Of The Cloud Sky Sword

“Su Tiansheng, don’t say that I didn’t give you a chance!”

you can leave with your su family, but these three women must stay. Otherwise, you will be declaring war on my Lin family!

Lin youming slowly stood up, a cold smile on his face.

Earlier on, Lin Dong had already told him everything. However, Feng xiyun and Zhuge Yueyue did not put the Lin family in their eyes at all. Therefore, they had to be taught a good lesson.

He wanted to use this to tell the world the miserable consequences of offending the Lin family.

!!

The most important thing was that he could clearly sense that Feng xiyun and Zhuge Yueyue actually possessed the innate God’s bones.

He had actually encountered such a rare physique, and there were two of them at once.

Immediately, Lin youming had a change of heart and wanted to dig out the innate divine bones in their bodies.

As long as he obtained these two pieces of innate God’s bones, he would be able to transfer them to Lin Dong’s body through a special method.

It was also because of this that he didn’t hesitate to use the Lin family’s power to surround the street and even offend su Tiansheng.

However, even though his men had surrounded the street, the situation was not very optimistic.

Su Tiansheng’s attribute of getting stronger when he encountered a strong opponent was simply too heaven-defying. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have chosen to threaten them with his words. At the very least, he had to take down Feng xiyun and Zhuge Yueyue for now.

As for the SU family, he would slowly deal with them in the future.

Seeing this, su Tiansheng’s expression also became serious. He didn’t know what to choose.

After all, he didn’t know if Feng xiyun and Zhuge Yueyue were too important to ye Xuan.

If it was just a random disciple, then even if they offended the Lin family at all costs, they might not be able to get any benefits.

At this moment, Feng xiyun walked out with an indifferent expression. She looked at su Tiansheng, who had a grave expression, and smiled lightly.

master su, we’ve already troubled the SU family a lot for today’s matter. We can’t make any more sacrifices!

we’ll remember the SU family’s kindness today. If we can leave safely, we’ll definitely repay the SU family’s kindness in the future!

Seeing this, su Tiansheng’s heart was instantly moved, and he even looked at this Feng xiyun in a new light.

He didn’t expect that at such a young age, in such an emergency situation, he could still be so calm and composed, and even consider for them, he was a person with deep feelings.

Forget it! Wasn’t it just the Lin family? So what if I beat him up?

“Little girl, don’t worry. Just based on your words, this Lord will definitely take charge of this matter!”

“Hmph! You’re looking for death!” Seeing this, Lin youming’s eyes turned cold, and he was about to order his subordinates to attack.

At this moment, Zhuge Yueyue stood out. With a wave of her sleeves, the cloud sky sword, which was shining with bright light, suddenly appeared.

In an instant! Everyone’s gazes involuntarily fell on the cloud sky sword.

“Could this Suan ni magic treasure be the cloudsky sword?”

“Isn’t this old man Tian Xuan’s treasure? How did this little girl get it?” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Lin youming’s expression changed when he saw this.

As cultivators of the previous generation, almost everyone knew of the cloud sky sword’s reputation.

After all, the owner of the cloud sky sword was a terrifying existence that struck fear into the hearts of all the top-tier Holy Lands. He was the former chief elder of the cloud sky peak and a Supreme-state expert who had fallen a hundred years ago, the old man Tian Xuan.

“Hahaha! It really is the cloud sky sword!”

Su Tiansheng couldn’t help but laugh when he saw this.

The moment Yun Tianjian appeared, he already understood how important Zhuge Yueyue’s identity was.

The cloud sky sword was the symbol of the cloud sky Peak’s inheritance. With the cloud sky sword in Zhuge Yueyue’s hands, it meant that she was the next heir to the cloud sky peak.

This was enough to prove Zhuge Yueyue’s position in ye Xuan’s heart.

Just now, he was still hesitating whether these two people were worthy of his full protection. Now, what was there to hesitate about?

“Yingluo, Who are you?”

At this moment, Lin youming could not help but show a look of fear.

Zhuge Yueyue looked at him coldly, then walked out with an indifferent expression and said with a calm gaze.

“I’m the first disciple of the great wilderness divine sect’s chief elder of cloud sky peak, ye Xuan, Zhuge Yueyue!”

As soon as his words fell, everyone’s pupils could not help but suddenly shrink, their eyes full of shock.

“What? Ye Xuan, how is this possible?”

Beside him, Lin Dong’s face involuntarily turned pale, while his heart was filled with despair.

He didn’t want to believe it, but the cloud sky sword in Zhuge Yueyue’s hand was a slap to his face.

Other people might be unfamiliar with ye Xuan’s name, but he was different.

The reason was simple. His teacher was su Mobai from the temple of the immortals, and he had personally fought with ye Xuan before.

The most important thing was that when su Mobai and ye Xuan fought, he was there to witness it with his own eyes. He was even more shocked when he saw ye Xuan severely injure the two powerhouses of the heaven hidden realm with one strike.

However, it was a pity that he did not notice Zhuge Yueyue at all because he was attracted by ye Xuan. Otherwise, how would he dare to provoke Zhuge Yueyue?

Now that he saw Zhuge Yueyue reveal the cloud sky sword, how could Lin Dong not understand what kind of person he had provoked?

In an instant! Lin Dong’s face was pale and bloodless, while his body could not help but tremble.

The great desolation divine sect was a top Holy Land on the same level as the ageless shrine, and its overall strength even surpassed the ageless shrine.

When Lin youming heard Zhuge Yueyue’s name, his face turned ashen.

He looked at his son and almost vomited blood.

This good-for-nothing was really incompetent, even though she told him that these two little girls were only ordinary cultivators.

Wasn’t this a complete scam?

“Master, what should we do?”

The two powerful guards of the Lin family came to Lin youming’s back and asked with worry.

Some time ago, the news that ye Xuan had severely injured two powerhouses in the heaven hidden realm with one sword strike had spread throughout the East continent, so they had naturally heard of it.

damn it, no wonder su Tiansheng is trying so hard to protect these two little girls. It seems like he’s planning to join the great wilderness divine sect.

“This matter has become tricky, Yingying.”

Feng xiyun couldn’t help but be curious when she saw the Lin family’s solemn expressions.

“Senior Sister, what’s the origin of the long sword in your hand? Why are they so afraid when they see it?”

Zhuge Yueyue was also a little confused. I’m not too sure either, but my teacher told me that this cloud sky sword seems to be the magic weapon of the chief elders of the cloud sky peak!

moreover, the cloud sky sword’s reputation was built on the founder, old man Tianxuan. However, teacher didn’t mention the specific details!

“However, my teacher also instructed me to bring out the cloud sky sword if I encounter any danger!”
