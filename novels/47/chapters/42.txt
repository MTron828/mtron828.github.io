Chapter 43: Ye Xuan Is Still Alive?

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Ye Xuan?” Li Wuji squinted his eyes as his gaze fell on Gu Da.

“Is the Qingyun sect looking for revenge because of Ye Xuan’s death?”

“No.” Hearing this, Gu Da shook his head.

“That’s true. How could a mere Qingyun sect become our enemies for Ye Xuan’s sake?” Li Wuji smiled indifferently.

Qingyun sect’s ranking was far lower than the Xuanyin sect, and its overall strength lagged behind theirs as well. How could they have the courage to challenge the Xuanyin sect?

Even if the Qingyun sect wanted to investigate Ye Xuan’s matter, they could simply say that there were many cultivators fighting for the Seven-colored Chaos Lotus at that time, and that it was inevitable that some casualties would occur.

Since ancient times, treasures were obtained by those capable of obtaining them. If they possessed sufficient strength, they would naturally obtain these treasures. If they did not have the strength, then they could only blame themselves.

Even though Ye Xuan was surrounded and poisoned, it could be explained away as an accident, and it simply meant that the other party did not possess the strength to fight for these treasures.

If the Qingyun sect really wanted to pursue the matter, the only viable method of resolution was to send one representative to duel the representative of the Xuanyin sect in the arena.

However, the overall strength of the Xuanyin sect far surpassed that of the Qingyun sect. Every Xuanyin sect elder was no weaker than the Qingyun sect elders, only stronger. Whether it was a one-on-one or a group battle, the Xuanyin sect was not afraid at all.

“The Qingyun sect isn’t looking for revenge, but that’s because I have received news that Ye Xuan is very likely to be fine! He… is still alive!” Gu Da looked at Li Wuji and said slowly. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“What? That guy is still alive?” Seeing this, Li Wuji’s facial expression changed, and his eyes were full of disbelief.

That guy had been poisoned so deeply that his meridians and Dantian had been damaged. How could he survive?

......

“I’m not sure either, but my men recently spotted him riding a firebird and leaving the Qingyun sect!” Gu Da took a deep breath as he said all this with a solemn expression.

“Impossible. That guy was poisoned by the Five Poisons powder. How could he have survived?” Li Wuji said doubtfully.

The Five Poisons powder was not an ordinary poison. It was a top-tier poison refined by a top-tier fourth-grade poison master. In terms of lethality, it was almost as strong as a fifth-grade poison.

The most crucial point here was that the core ingredient of the Five Poison powder was the poisonous liquid from the mouth of a level six demonic beast.

The so-called poison master could be considered a type of alchemist.

However, the pills and?concoctions refined by poison masters were all highly toxic items. They were not like alchemists who refined medicinal pills.

“This fellow is only a mid-stage core formation realm cultivator. How could he possibly resist Five Poison powder? Moreover, he was seriously injured at that time…”

“Normally, other than a sixth-grade alchemist or pill king, no one can cure or treat the Five Poisons powder!”

For a moment, Li Wuji’s eyes were filled with disbelief.

How could a mere Qingyun sect have the connections or resources to hire a sixth-grade alchemist? It was also unlikely that Ye Xuan had the good fortune to stumble upon one.

“I can’t guarantee it either, but there are still many witnesses other than my men. But, based on the information I have on hand, there is a very high possibility that Ye Xuan is still alive!” Gu Da said.

When he had learned the news earlier, his face had also been full of disbelief. Ye Xuan, who had been deeply poisoned by the Five Poisons powder, should have died long ago, and his corpse should have rotted away.

“This matter cannot be taken lightly. We must determine whether he is alive or dead! If the strongest genius of the Qingyun sect in a thousand years has really fallen, the remaining few old fellows there will not be able to stop our Xuanyin sect’s plans!”

“But if Ye Xuan is really still alive, then the Xuanyin sect will be in trouble!”

Li Wuji scratched his chin and fell into a state of deep thought, his face full of solemnity.

Gu Da would never joke with him about such an important matter. Although Ye Xuan might not be alive, he had to consider the possibility of this news being true.

If Ye Xuan really had such monstrous luck, perhaps he could really resolve the Five Poisons powder?

Most importantly, not only was Ye Xuan the strongest genius of the Qingyun sect in the past thousand years, he was also the strongest genius among the younger generation of cultivators of the Great Qian Dynasty. He was someone worthy of their attention.

Facing such a monstrous talent, it was only normal for them to be somewhat flustered.

“Hehe, there’s no need to rush!” Gu Da stroked his beard and said with a smile.

“Brother Gu, what do you mean?” Li Wuji frowned.

“We both know the terrifying lethality of the Five Poisons powder. Even if Ye Xuan was lucky enough to survive, it would have caused irreparable damage to his cultivation foundation!”

“Now, let alone whether he can increase his cultivation level, it’s even hard to say whether he can maintain his original cultivation!”

Gu Da replied confidently.

When he learned that Ye Xuan was still alive, he had indeed been shocked, but when he remembered the lethality of the Five Poisons powder, he immediately breathed a sigh of relief.

The Five Poisons powder was so deadly that, even if Ye Xuan was lucky enough to neutralize the poison, its sequelae would definitely cause permanent damage to his cultivation.

“Hahaha, I was indeed too anxious. Many thanks for Brother Gu’s reminder!”

“The Five Poisons powder is not only known for its lethality. The after-effects of being poisoned by it are nigh incurable!”

Hearing this, Li Wuji’s tightly furrowed brows slowly relaxed.

“It’s a pity that no one killed such a genius with their own hands. Given Ye Xuan’s monstrous talent, the qi and blood essence contained in his body must be very rich. What a pity!”

At that moment, Li Wuji could not help but recall the time when he fought for the Seven-colored Chaos Lotus.

Many elders of the Xuanyin sect had joined hands and killed a core formation realm cultivator while the other experts were fighting for the treasure. They had absorbed his qi and blood essence into the blood stone.

The qi and blood essence contained in the body of a core formation realm cultivator had been beyond their imagination. The greedy elders then set their eyes on Ye Xuan.

Of course, the most important reason for this was that the Seven-colored Chaos Lotus had fallen into Ye Xuan’s hands. In addition, Ye Xuan’s talent was too monstrous. If he was allowed to grow and develop, it was very likely that he would become a threat to the Xuanyin sect.

Moreover, at that time, the leader of the Qingyun sect and the other elders were already being tied down elsewhere. No matter how strong Ye Xuan was, he was not a match for the combined efforts of these elders. They would definitely be able to kill him within a short period of time.

However, what made them feel rather regret was that when the elders of the Qingyun sect saw that Ye Xuan was in danger, they threw aside their opponents at the cost of incurring injuries and directly gave up the fight for the Seven-colored Chaos Lotus in order to save Ye Xuan.
