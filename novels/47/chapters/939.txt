940 No Big Deal

“Hahaha, if I’m not wrong, you’re also here to show off, right? Do you think you can fool me?”

Seeing that Ye Xuan and the Thunder-Devouring Beast were together, the flood dragon believed that his aura was also just for show. After all, birds of a feather flocked together.

The flood dragon would not be deceived by Ye Xuan!

Besides, its own cultivation level was higher than Ye Xuan’s, so what was there to be afraid of?

Thus, the flood dragon was full of confidence.

“You really want to help the Thunder-Devouring Beast?”

Ye Xuan waved his hand helplessly and said, “I have no choice. Unfortunately, I like helping people a lot, haha.”

Hearing Ye Xuan’s arrogant reply, the flood dragon was furious. It was an eternal realm expert, yet it was being disregarded by this human.

“Ha! You’re just a small ant. Have you really thought it through? If you fight me, you’ll lose your life if you’re not careful.”

“It’s not easy to cultivate to your level, so you shouldn’t be so impulsive and do something that will kill yourself.”

Hearing this, the others present felt that it made sense and began to discuss softly.

“The flood dragon isn’t wrong. Those who can reach such a level are not fools, so why help someone else and harm themselves? That isn’t too bright.”

The Nine-tailed Sparrow began to panic, as if Ye Xuan did not intervene, then she would have to fend for herself again, and she stood no chance against the flood dragon.

She was faced with a dilemma. She did not want someone else to face danger to help her, but also did not want to be captured and made into the flood dragon’s plaything. Unable to do anything about the situation, she simply clenched her fists tightly and stared nervously at Ye Xuan.

However, Ye Xuan said calmly, “You’re blowing things out of proportion. I’m just teaching a worm a lesson, not jumping off a cliff.”

As soon as those words were uttered, hushed whispers were heard from the crowd again.

“Heavens! Isn’t this kid so bold?”

“Could it be that he really has that much confidence in himself?”

Everyone was dumbfounded. From what Ye Xuan had just said, they could tell that he was unusually confident at this moment, as if fighting the flood dragon was no big deal to him.

How arrogant was this?

The Nine-tailed Sparrow was elated to hear this, and her heart was filled with hope. This fellow truly had the swagger down though, which elicited a mesmerizing smile from her.

Unknowingly, the way she looked at Ye Xuan was now filled with admiration. After discovering this, the Thunder-Devouring Beast began to panic.

“This development doesn’t seem right. Big Brother said that he would help me get a partner, but now he’s showing off instead…”

At this moment, the Thunder-Devouring Beast had completely lost its composure. What would happen if the Nine-tailed Sparrow fell for Ye Xuan instead of him? Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“I absolutely cannot allow this to happen. I have to think of a plan quickly.”

The Thunder-Devouring Beast would not allow his beautiful wife-to-be to fall for someone else. He had to take action.

On the other hand, after hearing Ye Xuan’s words, the flood dragon’s expression turned extremely ugly.

An invisible fury burned in its heart, and it could no longer restrain itself.

“Hahaha! Very good! You’ve got guts!”

As it spoke fiercely, the flood dragon’s gaze towards Ye Xuan was filled with killing intent. As a descendant of the dragon race, it was actually being mocked by a human?

This fellow wanted to teach it a lesson? Hmph!

“Don’t be so arrogant! You are responsible for your own words, so I’m going to make you show me just how you’re going to teach me a lesson.”

As soon as it finished speaking, it unleashed its power. The flood dragon let out a dragon roar, causing a tornado to suddenly appear in the sky, and a powerful aura to descend upon the surroundings.

However, Ye Xuan remained unfazed. He looked at the scene in front of him calmly as he stretched out his hand and casually waved it. Immediately, a terrifying amount of power was released, and the aura and tornado dispersed.

Furthermore, the power pushed back the flood dragon, suppressing it. Everyone who saw this was terrified.

“Whoa!”

“Such power. Is that an immortal-grade divine power?”

At this moment, the flood dragon freed itself from the surge of power, feeling slightly stunned. When it turned around and looked behind, it saw the ground had crumbled. Just looking at it made its scalp tingle.

“This brat actually has some strength…”
