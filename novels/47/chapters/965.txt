Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Heavens!” Lu Xiu exclaimed, “Could it be that Junior Brother Ye is trying to break through? The aura he’s releasing is too terrifying.”

At this moment, everyone was stunned. No matter how hard they racked their brains, they could not figure out what Ye Xuan was doing. Where did his soul go at this time?

When the soul was out of the body, the soul was the dominant self, so as long as something happened to the soul, the physical body would also change. However, since they could only see Ye Xuan’s body, they had no way of knowing what his soul was experiencing.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Ao Lei’s brows were furrowed as he stared at Ye Xuan. After a while, he said with a serious expression, “If I’m not wrong, Junior Brother should be comprehending a powerful Great Dao. Moreover, it has already reached an extremely critical moment.”

After saying this, Ao Lei surveyed the situation around him and said, “Everyone, surround this place and form layers to protect Chief Ye Xuan’s safety. He must be given the time to comprehend the Great Dao safely.”

“Understood! ”

After the disciples heard Ao Lei’s order they immediately surrounded Ye Xuan, forming a formation with him at the center.

No one knew where Ye Xuan had gone, but they could tell that he had encountered an opportunity, and that these were critical moments.

Back at Ye Xuan’s side, one could see that in this dark space, Ye Xuan’s face was abnormally pale and weak. He was extremely uncomfortable.

At this moment, the Forbidden Lord was constantly transmitting energy into his body, and at the same time, explaining the principles of the Great Dao to him.

“This world is incomparably vast. If you want to escape the restraints of the world, you must first cut off your connection with the world.”

“The first thing you have to do is sever all mortal thoughts!’

After hearing the words of the Forbidden Lord, Ye Xuan gritted his teeth and roared, “Sever!”

At this moment, Ye Xuan felt his soul twitch violently. It was as if a certain thing in his body had been cut off by Ye Xuan.

When this happened, Ye Xuan’s temperament underwent a huge change. He looked even more like an immortal.

“The second thing to remove is the various deeds of the past, and no longer be greedy for mortal achievements.”

After hearing the words of the Forbidden Lord, Ye Xuan realized that he was about to collapse. However, he persevered with all of his might and roared hysterically, “Sever!”

At this moment, Ye Xuan felt that his strength had become even purer, but it seemed to have reached its limit.

The Forbidden Lord was closely watching Ye Xuan’s condition. At this moment, he could not help but smile. With just one more step, Ye Xuan would be able to successfully step onto this new path.

“At this moment, with the blood as the guide and the body as the Dao, you will sever all the good and evil in the world.”

After hearing this, Ye Xuan did not immediately make his move. Instead, he asked, “What is good and evil, is it all black and white?”

Hearing this, the Forbidden Lord explained, ” Between heaven and earth, there is a criterion for judging between good and evil. You only need to sever this. From now on, you only need to stick to your own judgment and standard of good and evil, and no longer need to abide by the worlds standards.”

After hearing this, Ye Xuan vaguely understood what needed to be done.

Different people had their own judgment of good and evil, as did the world as a whole. Thus, after severing this, only his heart would make the judgment.

“Sever!”

Ye Xuan did not continue to think about it and swung his sword again to make the final strike.

It was also at this moment that Ye Xuan instantly sensed a surging energy being injected into his sea of consciousness, causing his entire soul to shimmer and transform. His entire body was filled with energy.

The Forbidden Lord chimed in at this point.

“Young man, at this moment, you have already removed all useless thoughts from your soul. Now is also the best opportunity for you to step onto the path of this Great Dao!”

“Don’t delay any longer. Hurry up and use your blood as a guide to create this new Great Dao! ”

At this moment, the blood in Ye Xuan’s entire body seemed to be boiling. It continued to develop, and even his body began to dry up. It looked extremely terrifying.

Those surrounding Ye Xuan also noticed this situation, and panic set in.

“Heavens! Senior Brother, what exactly is going on? The situation doesn’t seem right,” Gao Shun said worriedly.

His eyes were fixed on Ye Xuan’s body, watching as the latter’s body began to dry up. Even his life force was beginning to weaken.

At this moment, he was in full panic mode. Could it be that Junior Brother Ye had not successfully broken through?

Ao Lei was also very flustered at this moment, and did not know what was going on. After all, his scope of knowledge was not that broad.

“What exactly is going on? Under normal circumstances, this shouldn’t be happening.”

No matter how hard he racked his brain, he could not think of a reason. Ao Lei could only keep pacing back and forth, thinking about how to deal with this.

However, the only thing they could do now was to quietly wait here and protect him. There was nothing else they could do.

They stared at Ye Xuan’s body, which was constantly drying up, as if he had become a thousand-year-old corpse. It was extremely terrifying.

However, suddenly, a terrifying amount of energy surged out, causing Ye Xuan’s physical body to instantly recover.

“My goodness! ”

After discovering this situation, everyone at the scene was completely dumbfounded. The originally dark sky in the forest became cloudy, and it soon began to rain.

However, this rain was not ordinary rain. It was a rain of blood!

“Oh my god… Has he already stepped into the eternal realm?”

After a moment of shock, excitement instantly appeared on everyone’s faces.

“Oh my god, the Great Wilderness Divine sect finally has an eternal realm expert! ‘

Ao Lei was already so excited that he was jumping for joy. He had witnessed a historical moment for the sect..
