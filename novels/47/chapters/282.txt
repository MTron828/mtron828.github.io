Chapter 283: Treasures Galore!

Ye Xuan’s heavenly lightning intent had reached the sixth level, and he had engraved a profound pattern derived from it into his body. Therefore, it was easy for him to suppress the destructive energy of the heart of heavenly lightning, which made it safe to give it to his disciples.

“Many thanks, Teacher!”

Zhao Yuyan nodded excitedly, and then took the heart of heavenly lightning.

Ye Xuan waited for a while, but no system notification was forthcoming.

It seemed that there would be no reward for giving the same item, even if the cooldown period had ended.

However, Ye Xuan had an idea in mind. Perhaps there might be a way around it.

‘What? He actually gave such a precious heavenly treasure to his disciple?’

‘Is he putting on an act in front of me?’

Moments later, Shangguan Wan’er was dumbfounded.

Ye Xuan took out another heart of heavenly lightning.

How is this possible?

This guy actually had more?

“Qingyan, here’s one for you too! I’ll help you refine it when the time comes.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan gave a fifth-level heart of heavenly lightning to Li Qingyan.

Originally, this fifth-level heart of heavenly lightning had been Yue’s, but Ye Xuan switched it up to see if he could get a reward from the system.

“Ding! As the host has given his disciple a fifth-level heart of heavenly lightning, the host has received a randomized 3x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained a fifth-level heart of heavenly lightning!”

It worked!

Seeing this, a smile hung on Ye Xuan’s lips.

Although the multiplier was not high, at least he had earned a reward from it, which would give him another avenue to increase his supply of treasures and resources.

Shangguan Wan’er, who had witnessed all of this, felt that her worldview had collapsed.

Those were hearts of heavenly lightning!

Even King realm experts would be tempted by these treasures, yet this fellow actually possessed two of them?

Furthermore, he did not even blink as he gave them away. It was like passing out candy to kids!

Then, something even more absurd happened…

Ye Xuan took out another heart of heavenly lightning!

Was this guy running a factory?

Was this the treasure trove that Ye Xuan was hinting at?

“Yue, this belongs to you,” Ye Xuan said.

“Many thanks, Teacher!”

“Ding! As the host has given his disciple a fifth-level heart of heavenly lightning, the host has received a randomized 2x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained a fifth-level heart of heavenly lightning!”

Just like the one before, the multiplier was quite low.

Perhaps this was the system’s own way of penalizing him for skirting the rules.

In any case, it was still a useful way to multiply his items. In addition, he had two more hearts of heavenly lightning in his spatial storage.

The most important discovery was that he could retrieve the items he had given his disciples and, after the cooldown period was over, he could give it back to them to receive more rewards.

This was an infinite loop!

After that, Ye Xuan took out the Datura flower.

When Shangguan Wan’er saw this, she fell silent, not knowing what to say.

Why and how was he giving away such precious treasures so freely?

Also, why did he have so many of them?

This was simply mind-boggling!

What kind of great fortune had Ye Xuan encountered to have accumulated this many treasures?

Seeing that ye Xuan was about to give the flower of slaughter to Zhao Yuyan, Shangguan Wan ‘er finally couldn’t hold it in anymore.

There was a bright flash of light, and Shangguan Wan’er’s figure suddenly appeared in the main hall of Lingjiu peak.

“My precious disciple, do you want this too?”

Ye Xuan waved the Datura flower in his hand and looked at Shangguan Wan’er with a smile.

Shangguan Wan’er, who was two to three meters away from Ye Xuan, was staring at the Datura flower in his hand with a gaze that was full of desire.

This treasure was too important to her!

It would complement the blood-red saber that she already had and allow her to rapidly comprehend slaughter intent.

Furthermore, with its help, there was even a chance that she would be able to comprehend the legendary reincarnation intent, which would allow her to fully awaken the memories from her past life.

At that time, she would regain her comprehension of the natural laws of the world as well as the martial intents from her previous life.

Her strength would then soar!

Unbelievably, this fellow had actually not used it himself and was planning to give it to his disciple.

Was there something wrong with his brain? ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Unlike before, Shangguan Wan’er did not rebut Ye Xuan.

However, just as she was about to say something, Ye Xuan had already given the flower to Zhao Yuyan.

“Many thanks, Teacher!”

Zhao Yuyan’s little face was filled with excitement.

To Zhao Yuyan, the value of the Datura flower was not important. The most important thing was that it was something that her teacher had given her. That was what made her happy.

“Ding! As the host has given his disciple the Datura flower, the host has received a randomized 36x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has received the crimson dreamsoul branch!”

At this moment, a system notification suddenly rang out in Ye Xuan’s mind.
