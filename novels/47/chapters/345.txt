346 I Will Protect Teacher’s Homeland

“This sword qi…”

“Has she comprehended perfect-level sword intent and engraved it into a profound pattern?”

Zhao Yuzhen’s eyes were filled with shock.

The sword intent contained with Shangguan Wan’er’s casual attack had overwhelmed him.

The lightning tribulation realm expert, who had up till then been wreaking havoc among the human race’s experts, had been slain instantly.

“Put away Teacher’s jade token.”

“I will protect Teacher’s homeland,” Shangguan Wan’er said indifferently.

She was dressed in white and looked extraordinary. Her body was filled with an otherworldly aura.

Although Shangguan Wan’er did not look at the grand elder, he knew that she was talking to him.

“As my lady commands!”

The grand elder subconsciously nodded, his expression was a little dazed as he put away the jade token.

If Shangguan Wan’er had not appeared just now, he would have been dead, without even the chance to crush the jade token.

It was no longer a secret that Shangguan Wan’er had acknowledged Ye Xuan as her teacher.

Though it had confused many people at first, when Ye Xuan killed the sea race King realm experts in the spatial turbulence, everyone finally understood.

This guy had concealed his strength so well!

“Hehe! Destroy the sea race? Protect the Nanzhou Region? You’re quite arrogant!”

At this moment, a huge spatial crack suddenly appeared in the sky. Then, a powerful flood dragon emerged from the depths of the spatial turbulence.

Another lightning tribulation realm expert!

Everyone was shocked by this.

Why were lightning tribulation realm experts showing up now? Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Furthermore, this one seemed even stronger than the last!

“I love killing geniuses. Today, your head will be added to my tally!”

Moments later, another lightning tribulation realm Yaksha expert appeared from the spatial crack.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

As the surroundings trembled, another three extremely powerful sea race lightning tribulation realm experts appeared.

In total, there were five sea race lightning tribulation realm experts!

Two flood dragons, one Yaksha, and the other two were a demonic whale and a merman.

The aura they exuded as a group was simply overwhelming!

“Damn it! Aren’t they worried about karma affecting their tribulations?”

Why were they so fearless?

No matter if it was the human race, the sea race, or any other race, only cultivators who had undergone heavenly tribulations could achieve perfect physical bodies and become King realm experts.

Heavenly tribulations had three stages, which were the tribulations of heaven, earth, and human!

If it was a demonic cultivator, then it would be the demon tribulation in the place of the human tribulation.

Under the tempering power of the terrifying tribulation lightning, the cells in the cultivator’s body would be constantly destroyed and then reborn. Only after undergoing the tempering would they have passed the heavenly tribulation.

However, if they made the slightest mistake during this process, their body and soul would be destroyed!

The second tribulation was also known as the netherworld tribulation, as it involved the energy of the netherworld formed by tens of thousands of evil spirits, and contained the resentment and obsession of countless dead souls.

If an expert’s body was contaminated by negative karma, they would be prone to suffering qi deviation during this tribulation and dying as a result.

The third tribulation also involved tribulation lightning, and one had to withstand the power of tribulation lightning from the nine heavens in order to truly sublimate one’s physical body and become a King realm expert.

Although each tribulation was extremely dangerous, the benefits one could obtain from transcending the tribulations were self-evident.

This was especially so for the third tribulation, which was divided into different levels depending on the number and type of profound patterns that a cultivator had engraved during the pattern condensation realm.

The higher the level of the third tribulation, the more benefits one would obtain.

In this case, the one who had died to Shangguan Wan’er’s first attack had been a lightning tribulation realm expert who had just passed the first tribulation, whereas these five had all passed the second tribulation.

The flood Dragon with the golden horn on his head was also soon to face the third tribulation.

Their aura overwhelmed the human race’s experts.

With their current strength, they would be annihilated if they were to face these lightning tribulation realm experts.

Of course, this did not hold true for Shangguan Wan’er.

Ever since she had become yY Xuan’s disciple, Shangguan Wan’er’s strength had soared.

The eyes of the five sea race lightning tribulation realm experts were filled with monstrous killing intent. Terrifying energy waves swept out as they surrounded Shangguan Wan’er.

At the same time, they all took out their artifacts and weapons.

However, Shangguan Wan’er’s expression remained very indifferent the entire time.

“Die, human!”

A flood dragon smiled cruelly as his long spear erupted with black light, stabbing toward Shangguan Wan’er.

The spear strike was like the eye of a hurricane, concentrating the power it gathered at its tip.

Seeing this, Shangguan Wan’er slowly raised the longsword in her hand.

Bright sword qi flashed, blinding everyone. It was as if the entire world had gone dark!
