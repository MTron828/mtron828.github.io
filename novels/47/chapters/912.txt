913 Just Watch Me

Ou Tian was extremely furious at this moment. He said in exasperation, “You’ve got a big mouth, but please use your brain before you say such words again. You’re not even an eternal realm expert, so you’re not qualified to speak to me like that!”

Hearing this, the smile on Ye Xuan’s face widened as he said, “Hahaha, what a joke!”

“Back then, I went from nothing to the sealed immortal realm. It only took me ten years. Mark my words! In less than seven years, I will be able to catch up to your cultivation level. Do you believe it or not?”

Ou Tian was so angry that his hair stood on end. Where did this guy get the courage to say that he could catch up to him in less than seven years?

“Haha…”

Ou Tian chuckled. Did he really think that it would be easy for him to reach the eternal realm?

“This is too funny. Reach my level in seven years? Fine then, I’ll wait for you!”

“When the time comes, show me what you’re capable of!”

“Brat, I advise you not to be so arrogant. Otherwise, the one who will suffer will be you.”

Ye Xuan smiled and did not say anything. Everyone thought he was crazy, but he had the system.

Seven years?

In all honesty, seven years was too long. Ye Xuan had originally planned to reach the eternal realm within five years. If it were not for the fact that he wanted to consolidate his cultivation foundation, he would have charged toward the eternal realm right now.

Therefore, Ou Tian’s provocation meant nothing. He would use facts and strength to refute Ou Tian. That would be the most satisfying way. In any case, he did not think of Ou Tian highly.

He only challenged Ou Tian because the latter had spoken such condescending words to Yanran.

However, at this moment, Ou Tian misinterpreted Ye Xuan’s silence for hesitation.

“Since you’ve already said it, you have to think carefully about how to survive. You wanted to deal with Shan Ling, right? Then go ahead. I’ll watch by the sidelines.”

“If you can survive, then perhaps there’s hope for you to someday reach the eternal realm,” Ou Tian said mockingly.

The corners of Ye Xuan’s mouth curled up slightly as he replied, “In that case, just watch. I’ll put on a good show.”

“Remember to watch carefully. It might be beneficial to your future cultivation.”

Ou Tian’s eyes froze. As a true immortal, was there a need for him to learn from a sealed immortal realm cultivator?

Ye Xuan’s words were challenging the limits of his patience.

On the other side, Shan Ling was furious after being ignored and looked down upon. He roared crazily, causing the surroundings to tremble.

“Damn it! Even if you two are quarreling, it doesn’t mean you can ignore me!”

“I’m the high ancestor of the lightning tiger clan! How dare you mess around in front of me! I’ll teach you a lesson for not taking me seriously!”

After hearing Shan Ling’s roar, the bickering pair finally stopped.

Yanran looked at Ye Xuan worriedly and said, “Ye Xuan, you must be cautious. If you really can’t win, don’t force yourself.”

At this moment, she really wanted to lend Ye Xuan a hand, especially given Ou Tian’s words. However, with her current strength, she was incapable of harming Shan Ling, and would only get in the way.

Her heart was also burning with anger. She vowed that, after she completely refined her inheritance, she would definitely teach this arrogant genius just who was the real genius here.

Ye Xuan rubbed Yanran’s head and comforted her, “Don’t worry, I’ll be back soon.”

Yanran’s eyes instantly lit up, and she smiled brightly. She chose to trust her man. After all, he had never failed her.

In the blink of an eye, Ye Xuan had already flown out, Godsword in hand.

Seeing Ye Xuan’s determined figure, some people were excited, some were worried, while others were gloating. All of them could not wait to see the outcome of this battle.

Chief among those who were gloating was Ou Tian, who very much wanted to see Ye Xuan beaten to a pulp, and maybe even killed.

At this moment, he was secretly accumulating his strength. After Ye Xuan was defeated or killed, he would immediately make his move and save the day.

He would never miss an opportunity to show off.

A bloodthirsty aura had completely spread out in the area, dyeing the entire sky red, and at this moment, Shan Ling was able to use the innate ability of the blood race. As such, his combat strength had been greatly improved, and the onlookers felt a great sense of oppression. Their faces were pale and their bodies trembled involuntarily.Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com
