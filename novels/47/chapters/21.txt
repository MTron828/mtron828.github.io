Chapter 22: This Pill Is Yours!

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Due to this, even at the risk of offending the Evil Blood sect, Li Qingyan still decided to take a gamble.

“Hmph!”

Seeing this, Feng Yitai snorted coldly. The strength of a tenth-level purple spirit stage cultivator instantly erupted, which then formed a terrifying pressure that enveloped Li Qingyan and the others.

“Not good!”

Seeing this, the second elder’s face changed greatly. He hurriedly released the power in his body, protecting Li Qingyan and the others.

“Be careful!”

The very next second, the second elder’s body suddenly trembled, and he let out a muffled snort. His face turned pale.

However, no matter what, he still resisted Feng Yitai’s pressure.

Although his strength was only at the fourth level of the purple spirit stage, even a tenth-level purple spirit realm cultivator would find it absolutely impossible to defeat him with just a wave of pressure.

Feng Yitai’s gaze turned even colder when he saw this scene, and his eyes were filled with monstrous killing intent.

Of course, he did not make any excessive movements. After all, this was the auction house’s territory.

Most importantly, the strongest existence behind the auction house’s was no lower than the empty core stage. On the surface, that person was an existence on the same level as the Evil Blood sect’s commander!

......

He was merely a tenth-level purple spirit stage cultivator. How could he dare to act so presumptuously in front of the other party.

Of course, his actions had already marginally broken the rules of the auction house.

The reason why the auction house did not stop Feng Yitai’s actions was because the strongest existence behind the auction house was acquainted with the commander of the Evil Blood sect.

However, if Feng Yitai continued to be presumptuous, the other party would not sit idly by.

It was precisely because Feng Yitai saw this that he did not make too much of a fuss.

“I bid 40 million.”

After Feng Yitai withdrew his pressure, he continued to bid indifferently, no longer paying attention to Li Qingyan and the others.

He had already given them an obvious warning earlier. If the other party did not know what was good for them, then he could not be blamed for what followed.

“Sister... we... What should we do?”

Li Chen looked at his sister whose body was trembling and could not help but feel a little anxious.

Although he had not seen much of the world, he had gained a clear view of the situation clearly now.

The deputy commander of the Evil Blood sect was clearly determined to obtain the soul-returning pill. Moreover, he did not allow other cultivators to interfere in the bidding war between them and the Shadow Tower.

Li Qingyan did not speak, but her body could not stop trembling. Her rosy cheeks turned extremely pale and her nails dug into her palm.

“Forget it, let’s give up...” The second elder could not help but shake his head helplessly when he saw this scene.

Although the Li family’s strength was not weak, it was nothing compared to the Evil Blood sect and the Shadow Tower. If they continued to bid, it was very likely that they would completely offend these two big factions.

Inside the auction house, Feng Yitai would not make a move, but once they were outside, things would change.

Li Qingyan did not answer, but her beautiful eyes were full of unwillingness.

Power! If she had absolute power, she would be able to resolve this situation!

Unfortunately, this world was a cruel one where only power was absolute.

“Huh?”

Seeing this, Ye Xuan, who was sitting in the audience raised his eyebrows and looked at Li Qingyan below in surprise.

At the same time, several lines of virtual text appeared in his field of vision.

Comprehension: 299.

Bone: 79.

(Dual Spirit Physique: Innate affinity with both wood and fire attributes)

(Note: One can only fully activate the dual spirit physique after stepping into the true essence realm. Innately suited to be an alchemist, it can be said the owner of the dual spirit physique can achieve twice the result with half the effort when it comes to alchemy!)

Ye Xuan became quite interested in this girl.

With his true core state cultivation, he naturally was aware about everything that was going on inside the entire auction house.

Faced with the threat of a tenth-level purple spirit state cultivator, she was actually able to grit her teeth and persevere. Disregarding Li Qingyan’s comprehension and innate bone values, just based on her mental toughness alone, she was a worthy candidate.

“She is indeed suitable to be taken in as a disciple, but I still have to observe carefully!” Ye Xuan said in his heart.

In terms of comprehension, Li Qingyan could be said to have left Yue far behind. Her comprehension was dozens of points higher than Yue’s, which made him feel extremely surprised.

However, what made him most excited was that Li Qingyan actually had a natural wood and fire dual spirit physique, which was the most suitable physique for one to become an alchemist!

Of course, Ye Xuan would not directly take her as a disciple just because of this wood and fire dual spirit physique. After all, what he valued most in taking disciples was character.

Even if he could not bid for the treasure that he was interested in today, it would still be pretty good if he managed to take in a disciple.

At the same time, the bidding for the soul-returning pill became more and more intense.

“I bid 43 million.”

“I bid 45 million.”

“I bid 48 million.” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“I bid 51 million.”

Although the bids were getting higher and higher, the only ones who were really competing were the Evil Blood sect and the Shadow Tower.

After hearing Feng Yitai’s last bid, Lin You’s face changed greatly.

“Impossible. How can you still have 51 million? If you don’t have the money with you, I’m afraid you won’t be able to walk out of the auction house!” Lin You said with a cold look in his eyes.

“Hehe, it’s just 51 million. Our Evil Blood sect can still afford such a small sum!” Feng Yi Tai saw this and replied with a mocking look in his eyes.

If he did not bring enough money, he would not have dared to participate in the auction for the Violet Orchid.

“I bid 53 million.”

Lin You called out another bid, but his expression was extremely ugly. Although the value of the soul-returning pill was not low, it was definitely not worth 53 million!

However, for the sake of his commander’s injuries, he had to continue bidding.

“I bid 55 million.” Feng Yi Tai noticed his hesitation and responded indifferently. There was no trace of panic in his eyes, as if this 55 million was not a big sum.

“I bid 56 million.”

“I bid 58 million.”

“I bid 59 million.”

As more time passed, Lin You’s expression gradually turned ugly.

Feng Yitai had previously spent 30 million to bid for the Violet Orchid. Yet he actually still had sufficient funds to bid for the soul-returning pill.

“I bid 60 million.” Feng Yitai’s gaze remained indifferent as he announced a new bid.

“I bid 65 million.” When Lin You saw this, he could not help but grit his teeth and immediately increased the bid by 5 million!

“I didn’t expect your Shadow Tower to be so rich and overbearing. The soul returning pill is yours!”

At this moment, Feng Yitai revealed a smile on his face and said indifferently.

“Feng Yitai, what exactly does your Evil Blood sect mean by this?!”

Lin You was furious when he saw this. He felt like he had been played like a fiddle!
