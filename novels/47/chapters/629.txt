630 New Life Goal

Ye Xuan was stunned and very excited.

‘My disciple is really not bad. As expected of someone with the potential to become a sealed immortal realm expert!’

With this girl’s current strength, ordinary materialization cultivators would be no match for her.

If she were to learn some powerful offensive techniques, even a void realm cultivator would find it difficult to defeat her.

However, to learn these powerful techniques, she first needed to learn how to read!

After some time passed, Xiang Yun suddenly took a deep breath. The body refining solution in the Boundless Cauldron had turned clear.

After slowly opening her eyes, Xiang Yun immediately looked at Ye Xuan with a smile. She then got out of the cauldron.

“Hehe, Teacher, now can I be considered invincible among my peers?”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan laughed and replied, “You’re not far off.”

“Next time, I’ll teach you a few offensive techniques. At that point, you should be considered invincible among your peers.”

“But there’s one thing I have to tell you. Being invincible among your peers is no big deal. After all, you won’t be fighting your peers all the time. In the mystic world, you will often have to fight those from the older generation. You must become stronger so that you can fight every enemy you encounter.”

“It’s precisely because of this that you have to work hard now.”

Xiang Yun was stunned by his words. She lowered her head and started thinking as if this was a life-altering revelation.

“I should become invincible, not only among my peers, but in the world as well?”

Her eyes lit up as she muttered to herself. This was her new life goal!

“Okay then! I will become invincible and defeat all of my enemies,” she clenched her small fist and said solemnly.

Looking at this scene, Ye Xuan was content.

Fortunately, this little girl was still young. When she grew up and experienced more things, it would be impossible to deceive her.

“That’s all for today. Go back to your room and rest. If there’s anything else, we can discuss it tomorrow,” Ye Xuan said after thinking for a moment.

Unknowingly, the sun was about to set.

In general, today was quite a fulfilling day…

“Alright then, Teacher. Bye bye!”

As soon as she finished speaking, Xiang Yun ran off like the wind. As she ran, she seemed to have thought of something, and paused for a moment before rushing back to the rear of the mountain.

The beasts living there were probably going to suffer again…

Now that Xiang Yun’s cultivation had gotten off to a great start, it would be time to teach the other two disciples alchemy from tomorrow onward.

After thinking for a while, Ye Xuan put the Boundless Cauldron back into his storage space before returning to the Cloud Sky Palace.

At this moment, the sun was slowly setting in the west, and the warm and comfortable sun shone on the entire Cloud Sky peak.

However, amidst this beautiful scenery, there was a little girl running around, chasing the beasts and making them jump in fright…

At that moment, the system’s notification rang out.

“Ding! As you have given your disciple a number of top-grade herbs, you have received a stalk of photinia grass and a portion of precious spiritual herbs.”

“Nice,” Ye Xuan muttered to himself happily. Yesterday, he was still complaining that the herbs he received were not amazing, but his luck today was much better.

The system really was a cheat-like existence!

With the help of the photinia grass, his body refining cultivation would be able to make great progress again, and he might be able to reach the heaven realm.

Honestly, he was greatly anticipating the moment when he reached the supreme realm in body refining cultivation.

At that time, with the strength of both internal and external cultivation, Ye Xuan would probably face no obstacles while breaking through to the sealed immortal realm.

Thinking this, Ye Xuan brought up his status information panel.

[Host: Ye Xuan]

[Cultivation: Supreme realm (Spiritual cultivation), void realm (Body refining cultivation)]

[Skills: Boundless Palm technique, Fiery Phoenix technique, Flora Sword technique…]

[Treasures: Godsword, Cloud Heaven Sword, Rainbow Robe, Boundless Cauldron… ]

[Top-grade immortal treasurer: Chaos Immortal Peach x1]

[System evaluation: Very good. Your score is 99.9. Host, you’ve developed quite well recently.]

Looking at the system’s evaluation, Ye Xuan’s face instantly darkened. Was he that bad in the past?

Now, Ye Xuan still had to improve his body refining cultivation level, and then he could prepare to break through to the ancient realm. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

However, it would have to wait for the Divine Seal peak’s gathering to conclude. There were only less than 30 days remaining, and he still needed to reach the advanced stage of the supreme realm first.

After thinking for a long time, Ye Xuan started to concoct the body refining solution, and added the photinia grass into it.
