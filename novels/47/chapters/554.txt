555 The Great Battle (Part 1)

Before they separated, Yanran naughtily bit Ye Xuan’s hand, reminding him to always remember her.

At this moment, because the ancient tomb’s spatial realm had collapsed, all of the cultivators were forcefully teleported to the outside world.

It was the same for Zhuge Yueyue, but she was at a loss.

She was holding an imperial sword in her hand, which the cultivators nearby were all covetously.

!!

She had spent a lot of effort and almost lost her life obtaining this imperial sword.

It contained an extremely strong killing intent, and anyone with lacking willpower would instantly turn into a mindless killing machine if they held the sword.

Fortunately, Zhuge Yueyue’s willpower was very strong, which allowed her to successfully subdue the imperial sword.

Although the killing intent of this imperial sword was extremely strong, it was also an advantage. Using it, she could easily defeat enemies whose cultivation levels were higher than hers.

The moment they noticed the sword in Zhuge Yueyue’s hand, the eyes of the onlookers were filled with desire.

“It’s an imperial sword!”

“This little girl is quite lucky. She actually obtained an imperial sword in the ancient tomb?”

An old man with a head full of white hair had already taken a fancy to Zhuge Yueyue’s sword.

He said excitedly, “Little girl, this sword’s killing intent is too dense for you to handle, so you should help yourself by handing it over to me.”

Without waiting for Zhuge Yueyue’s reply, the old man immediately started to attack.

“Get lost!”

A crisp cry rang out, and Yuelun, who was also teleported out of the ancient tomb, easily repelled the old man.

After seeing Yuelun, Li Hanyi immediately ran over to welcome her.

Zhuge Yueyue also relaxed. She had been fighting with someone in the ancient tomb when she had suddenly been teleported out of the ancient tomb.

As the saying goes, one should not reveal one’s wealth. Zhuge Yueyue was also very clear about this.

However, due to the suddenness of the incident, she appeared in the outside world before she could put away her sword.

Were it not for Yuelun’s appearance, she would have been in danger.

Zhuge Yueyue walked forward to thank her respectfully, and Yuelun nodded in acknowledgment. Then, she looked coldly at the old man and scolded him.

“Could it be that you people from the Immortal Divine sect really think that our Great Wilderness Divine sect is so easy to bully?”

The old man was only a heaven realm cultivator, and he was an elder of the Immortal Divine sect.

Seeing Yuelun’s furious face, the old man’s face instantly turned pale.

His original plan was to snatch the sword from Zhuge Yueyue and then escape. After all, there were very few people who knew who he was in this place.

However, who would have thought that he would run into one of the experts from the Great Wilderness Divine sect so quickly?

He really did not know what to do in this situation.

Before he had left, the sect master had warned him not to provoke the people of the Great Wilderness Divine sect unless there were special circumstances.

How did the one person he targeted end up being a disciple of the Great Wilderness Divine sect?

Was his luck really that bad?

He did not rush over not immediately after the ancient tomb revealed itself, so he had no idea which sect Zhuge Yueyue was from. Otherwise, he would not have made a move just now.

After trying his best to calm himself down, the old man figured out a path of escape.

Moments later, he frantically ran toward the crowd, hoping to escape under the cover of the crowd.

However, to his surprise, Yuelun seemed to have read his mind and was waiting for him, blocking his escape route.

“Hehe, you still want to run away in this situation?”

Yuelun said coldly. Her killing intent had already been ignited.

The Immortal Divine sect and the Great Wilderness Divine sect had been at odds with each other for quite some time, especially after Ye Xuan killed one of their elders. The enmity between the two sects had intensified since then.

Since things had already gotten to this point, what else was there to say?

There was no need to be kind to one’s enemy. Otherwise, one would only end up harming oneself.

Thinking this, Yuelun did not hesitate to use her killer move. With one move, she killed the old man.

Huang Daning and his group, who had been sent out, happened to see this scene.

“Hurry up and stop!”

Huang Daning rebuked her angrily, and immediately attacked Yuelun.

However, was Yuelun afraid of him?

She turned around calmly and sent Huang Daning flying with a single slap.

Seeing this, the other cultivators hurriedly helped Huang Daning to stabilize his body as they glared fiercely at Yuelun.

“Daoist Yuelun, what do you mean by this?”

He really could not figure out why Yuelun would kill a member of the Immortal Divine sect in public.

Yuelun replied calmly, “That old man deserved to die. He tried to snatch a treasure that belonged to a disciple of my Great Wilderness Divine sect in public. Since I happened to see it, I meted out the appropriate punishment.”

“You should be clear about the way our Great Wilderness Divine sect does things. If someone offends us, we will definitely return the favor!”

“If you’ve got a problem with that, then come at me. I’ll take you all on!”

After hearing this, Huang Daning and the others were stunned. They did not know what to say.

...

Yuelun had always been known for her gentle personality, but she was being so overbearing now.

Given the series of events, it seemed that these people from the Great Wilderness Divine sect were very protective of their juniors.

Furthermore, Zhuge Yueyue was Ye Xuan’s disciple. How could Yuelun just sit by and do nothing?

“Hehe, you’re quite arrogant!”

Another voice rang out from behind the crowd, as an old man dressed in a gray robe appeared and looked at Yuelun with a contemptuous expression.
