570 Ye Xuan’s Warning

Han Tai’s heart had completely turned cold after what Daoist Hei Tie had done to him today. He even had thoughts of exacting revenge on this senior brother of his.

In any case, if he could keep his life, why not give up a hand?

Han Tai said, “I won’t trouble Fellow Daoist Ye to do it personally. I’ll cut off my right hand myself!”

After saying that, Han Tai pulled out his weapon and chopped off his right hand without hesitation.

!!

After doing so, Han Tai was in so much pain that he kept rolling on the ground.

At the very least this guy had guts, and had taken responsibility for his own actions. As such, Ye Xuan decided to allow him to live.

Seeing Han Tai’s actions, Ye Xuan’s anger had almost dissipated. He even noticed that Han Tai was already looking at Daoist Hei Tie with hatred.

‘Hehe, this is really interesting. There will probably be a good show to watch in the future,’ Ye Xuan thought to himself.

He was actually quite curious about what would happen between Han Tai and Daoist Hei Tie in the coming days. Revenge was probably on the horizon.

Thinking this, Ye Xuan felt very amused, but still pretended to be calm.

“Not bad, you’ve got courage. Let’s forget about what happened before.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

After saying that, Ye Xuan looked at the people around him with cold eyes and continued, “This is also to let all of you understand that my disciples are not so easy to bully.”

“If they were injured in a fight with their peers, I won’t be bothered. After all, they can only blame themselves for being too weak.”

“However, if a cultivator from the older generation dares to lay a hand on my disciples, then I can only advise them to wash their necks and await execution.”

After hearing this, everyone’s hearts trembled, and they felt very fortunate that they had not provoked Ye Xuan’s disciples.

There was also a group of onlookers who were very careful and whispered to the people of their own sects, “Remember the appearance of Ye Xuan’s two disciples and tell the disciples of our sect not to provoke them in the future. Avoid them if possible.”

“If you really provoke them, don’t blame the sect for not protecting you.”

“How terrifying! I’m afraid anyone who provokes them will die.”

The onlookers began to discuss one after another. There were even some people who drew portraits of Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun in order to have them distributed among the disciples of their sects.

No one wanted to be on the receiving end of Ye Xuan’s anger.

Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun were also very touched that their teacher would go so far for them. They no longer felt aggrieved by what had happened to them earlier.

To have such a good teacher was something that everyone else dreamed of. How could they ask for more?

After Ye Xuan warned the others, he looked at Han Tai again and said, “Your admission of guilt and willingness to accept responsibility has saved your life today.”

“However, if you’re unreconciled about this, then feel free to come and seek me out for revenge in the future.”

“No, no, no. I would never do such a stupid thing. I wouldn’t dare,” Han Tai quickly said.

It was already very good that he had survived this calamity. Besides, the one he truly wanted revenge on now was Daoist Hei Tie. There was no reason to provoke Ye Xuan again.

Hearing this, Ye Xuan understood Han Tai’s intentions. He simply looked at Daoist Hei Tie and said, “Haha, the Supreme Divine sect is truly eye-opening…”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan left with his two disciples without any hesitation. His words were filled with contempt for the Supreme Divine sect.

Who would join such a heartless sect, only to be abandoned and left for dead in times of trouble?

Were it not for Ye Xuan’s generosity, Han Tai might have already gone to see the king of hell.

Who would be willing to accept such a fate?

With this, a clear line was drawn between the Great Wilderness Divine sect, the Supreme Divine sect.

After settling this matter, Ye Xuan brought Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun to visit the Su family’s residence to check on Su Changhe.

However, in the end, he realized that this guy was just pretending and did not suffer any serious injuries. He had made his family worry for nothing.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan was so angry that he kicked the latter in the butt, as if he was disappointed.

“Teacher, a lot of people from our sect have gone to the Immortal Divine sect. Should we go and help?”

After leaving the Su family’s residence, Zhuge Yueyue looked at Ye Xuan and asked.

After Gao Shun was revived and recovered, he immediately rushed to the Immortal Divine sect to help the others. Yuelun also followed him.

However, it did not seem like her teacher planned on joining them.

Hearing this, Ye Xuan said with a smile, “What’s wrong? Don’t tell me you want to go there and witness what can only be described as a living hell?”

Ye Xuan could not bear to let his two disciples see the cruel scene of countless cultivators being slaughtered, so he chose not to help.

After all, the two big sects were irreconcilable, so Ao Lei and the others would definitely not leave behind any future seeds of trouble. Everyone in the Immortal Divine sect would be slaughtered, down to the last person.
