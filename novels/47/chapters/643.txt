644 Setting Off

On the other side, Xiao Feng had already noticed the cold-looking Zhuge Yueyue beside Ye Xuan.

He wanted to say hello, but could not bring himself to do it.

After all, they had already become strangers when they joined different peaks.

Zhuge Yueyue had originally been an existence that no one cared about. However, after joining Cloud Sky peak, she became the focus of everyone’s attention, and was acknowledged as a genius.

It was for this reason that luck could also determine a person’s achievements.

Zhuge Yueyue happened to be lucky enough to be recruited by Ye Xuan.

As for him, although Gao Shun had finally started to teach and nurture him seriously, he had not been able to cultivate properly for a very long period of time.

No matter what, he could not catch up with Zhuge Yueyue.

Gao Shun could only say very helplessly at this time, “Junior Brother Ye, I have to congratulate you. Your current cultivation level is an unattainable dream for me. Sigh…

“What are you talking about? I just broke through by accident. It’s just a small matter. There’s no need to make it public.”

On the other side, Xiang Yun emerged from behind Ye Xuan, looking around among the Hidden Sword peak disciples.

Then, she asked, “Who is Gao Tianyu? Is he here?”

After hearing this, Gao Tianyu subconsciously trembled. Why was this little girl still after him?

He had never provoked her.

After hearing Gao Tianyu’s name mentioned, everyone turned to look at him.

At this time, Gao Shun also turned around to look at his son doubtfully. Had his son offended Ye Xuan’s disciple?

Fortunately, before things could go any further, a few more figures appeared.

Looking at the group of beautiful women in front of them, many disciples began to secretly swallow their saliva.

At this time, Ye Xuan was also staring at Yuelun’s graceful figure. How long had it been since they last met? Ye Xuan even felt that his senior sister seemed to have become more beautiful.

At this moment, Yuelun led her group of Water Sky peak disciples over and greeted them.

“It’s been a long time since we last met.”

Hearing that, Gao shun smiled and nodded in response.

Ye Xuan, on the other hand, looked at Yuelun seriously and said, “Senior Sister Yuelun, we haven’t seen each other for at most 30 days. Why do I feel like you’ve become curvier?”

After hearing this, Yuelun’s face immediately turned red as she rolled her eyes at Ye Xuan.

At this moment, she suddenly thought of what Ye Xuan had said some time ago, about his offensive set of techniques.

After some time digesting the information, she finally figured out what he had been talking about.

This guy was such a pervert!

However, when given an actual opportunity, he dropped the ball halfway. He was really too unreliable.

Was he all talk and no action?

After that, Yuelun turned around and ignored him. Instead, she looked at Xiang Yun.

She squatted down and rubbed her head, asking, “Little beauty, do you still remember me?”

“I’ll definitely remember.”

Xiang Yun was very happy and immediately shouted, “Aren’t you the fattest one from Water Sky peak?”

After hearing this, Yuelun’s expression darkened and she glared at Ye Xuan. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

How could a child say such things? She must have learnt it from Ye Xuan!

Ye Xuan felt a little wronged at this time. This had nothing to do with him this time… really!

“Senior Sister Yuelun, have you forgotten about the matter we discussed before? When will we have an in-depth discussion?”

Ye Xuan smiled evilly and gave her a friendly reminder.

When she heard Ye Xuan mention it again, the conversation was brought to mind again, and her face turned red again.

She rolled her eyes and said, “Who wants to have an in-depth discussion with you? I certainly don’t want to.”

As soon as she finished speaking, Yuelun immediately turned to leave with her disciples.

“Hehe…”

Seeing this, Ye Xuan could not help but chuckle.

This puzzled Feng Xiyun, who asked, “Why is Chief Yuelun’s face so red?”
