578 Feng Lu (Part 1)

Even though it was profound silver, 20 million taels of profound silver was equivalent to 200,000 taels of profound gold! Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

At that time, if he were to give that amount to his disciples and get another bountiful reward from the system, would he still have to worry about money in the future?

Furthermore, this was just the starting price. Heavens!

At this moment, Ye Xuan already felt that he had a boundless future ahead of him. The excitement in his heart was indescribable, but there was no change in his expression.

“Ahem… Alright, let’s set that as the starting price then.”

After hearing that Ye Xuan had agreed to the starting price, Han Sikong’s heart was finally at ease.

He was really a little scared.

If Ye Xuan wasn’t satisfied with the price he just offered, and flew into a rage, he might even have died.

Why was this deal so frightening?

This was the most dangerous deal he had ever made in his entire life.

He was drenched in cold sweat.

“Alright, sir. If there’s nothing else, I’ll take my leave first.”

“Wait here a moment. I believe that the auction will begin soon.”

Ye Xuan nodded in acknowledgment and sat down again.

Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun also sat down next to Ye Xuan. They were also looking forward to watching the auction.

What kind of price would their teacher’s treasures be sold for?

As time passed, the seats in the auction hall were gradually filled up.

However, at that moment, Ye Xuan noticed that there was an argument outside the suite.

“Prince Zhanglu, there’s a VIP guest in Suite 001. You can’t enter.”

“Tsk! What VIP? I’m a prince, and the most important guest here!”

As soon as he finished speaking, a pot-bellied old man in a golden robe suddenly opened the door and walked in.

After seeing this person, Feng Xiyun could not help but frown.

Zhuge Yueyue had already noticed her junior sister’s strange behavior and quickly asked, “Xiyun, what’s going on? Do you know who this old man is?”

After thinking for a moment, Feng Xiyun replied, “Yes, I do.”

“He’s the prince of the Yangli divine empire. His name is Feng Lu, but people call him Prince Zhanglu. He can be considered my uncle, I guess.”

Zhuge Yueyue nodded in understanding.

They were wearing masks on their faces, so it was not strange that Feng Lu did not recognize Xiyun.

“Do you want to go over and say hello?” Zhuge Yueyue asked innocently.

Hearing this, Feng Xiyun felt helpless and said in an unpleasant tone, “It’s not as simple as you think. Although he’s my uncle, I don’t consider him as family at all, nor does he.”

“Besides, my status in the royal family pales in comparison to his, so I have no reason or right to greet him.”

After hearing this, Zhuge Yueyue came to a sudden realization. She secretly clutched Xiyun’s small hand.

“Let’s see which VIP actually stole my suite!”

Feng Lu walked into the suite slowly with an arrogant expression. After looking around, he ignored Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun.

He felt that these two women were only here to serve the VIP. Then his gaze fell on Ye Xuan.

Seeing him, Feng Lu frowned and thought to himself, ‘This person looks so young. Could it be that he’s from a large family?’

Thinking this, Feng Lu was relieved.

As long as it was not a particularly powerful family, he could easily resolve this matter.

At this moment, Ye Xuan did not say a word. He looked at Feng Lu with a calm expression.

A servant hurried over and said frantically, “I’m sorry, Sir. I couldn’t stop him just now and allowed him to come over to disturb you.”

After saying that, the servant’s legs started to tremble in fear. He still remembered that Han Sikong had specifically told him to serve Ye Xuan well and not to provoke him, otherwise, the people here would probably die.

However, to his surprise, no matter how hard he tried to stop Prince Feng Lu, the latter ignored him completely and just barged in. This put him between a rock and a hard place.

‘Prince, if you’re tired of living, don’t drag me into this. I haven’t lived long enough.’

Ye Xuan raised his hand and gestured to the servant, indicating for him not to meddle in this matter. Then, he stared at Feng Lu to see what tricks he would try to play.

After careful consideration, Feng Lu decided that Ye Xuan was indeed a young master from a major family who had gone out for a stroll out of boredom.

As such, this young master was probably trying to show off and had thus spent a lot of money to secure this suite.

After thinking for a while, Feng Lu calmed down and said with a smile, “May I ask which major family you are from?”

“I am a prince of the Yangli divine empire. You can call me Prince Zhanglu. I have always occupied Suite 001, and would like to ask for your cooperation to relinquish it to me.”

Royalty had always paid attention to etiquette in everything. This was also the practice of their empire.

After learning that this person was actually a prince of the Yangli divine empire, Ye Xuan was momentarily stunned and turned to look at Feng Xiyun.

Seeing this, Feng Xiyun nodded at ye Xuan, confirming that this person was indeed from the Yangli divine empire.

The corners of Ye Xuan’s mouth curled up slightly, and he said straightforwardly, “Oh? Prince Zhanglu? Good to know. Alright, you can get out of here now!”

Upon hearing this, Feng Lu’s face darkened.

Despite knowing his background, this person did not back down!

There were only two possibilities for such a thing to happen.

...

One was that this young man really had a great background, and the other was that he was a fool who did not know any better.
