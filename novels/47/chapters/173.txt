Chapter 174: Master Of The Divine Gate

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

A mere cultivator who had yet to make it onto the Nanzhou Region Genius Rankings dared to aim for the Tower of Heaven’s rankings. Was this not utter ignorance?

Furthermore, compared to the combat power rankings, the qualification ranking’s requirements were even more stringent.

This was because it did not evaluate the cultivator’s strength, but rather their level of talent! 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

In other words, as long as one’s level of talent was monstrous enough, even if they were only qi transformation realm cultivators, they would still be able to make it onto the list.

Gongsun Yao’s words caused quite a stir among many people.

Those cultivators who did not know Gongsun Yao’s identity revealed expressions of shock after being enlightened by the people around them.

Those cultivators from the ordinary empires were shocked. It turned out that only cultivators like Gongsun Yao could be called real geniuses.

Of course, some were shocked, while others did not think much of it.

Most of the latter came from the Great Qian Dynasty.

Was Gongsun Yao’s talent very monstrous? That would depend on who she was being compared to! The strongest genius of the Nanzhou Region? Who gave her that title?

She had only reached the ninth level of the purple spirit realm at the age of 16, yet she dared to hold the title of the strongest genius?

Then what about Ye Xuan?

Putting aside Ye Xuan, even Ye Xuan’s disciples could crush Gongsun Yao!

Although they did not know the current cultivation levels of Ye Xuan’s two disciples, they had definitely reached the purple spirit realm.

Most importantly, Yue was only 13 years old at the moment. Did that not speak volumes of her talent?

With such talent, Gongsun Yao still dared to look down on other cultivators. It was ridiculous.

When the cultivators from the Great Qian Dynasty saw Gongsun Yao’s expression, they were unhappy.

They wanted Ye Xuan to show himself and slap Gongsun Yao in the face. They wanted him to show Gongsun Yao what a true genius was.

After that, they would see if this girl still dared to look down on cultivators from the ordinary empires.

Ye Xuan did not pay much attention to what was happening around him. Instead, he calmed his mind and slowly stabilized his own cultivation foundation.

Now that he was only one step away from achieving perfect control of his own strength, he naturally would not allow himself to be distracted by miscellaneous matters.

“I didn’t expect that it would be so difficult to enter the two lists of the Tower of Heaven!”

“That’s right! Not only do we have to compete with current cultivators, we also have to compete with those peerless geniuses who have existed for tens of thousands of years, or even hundreds of thousands of years!”

“If that’s the case, wouldn’t the minimum requirement to enter the combat power rankings be the true core realm?”

“The master of the Divine Gate, the strongest genius of our Nanzhou Region in the past, actually reached the unity realm at the age of 20. Isn’t that too terrifying?”

While everyone was waiting for the Tower of Heaven to test the actual ages of the cultivators, they once again started discussing topics related to the Tower of Heaven.

When the master of the Divine Gate was mentioned, people could not help but be shocked!

However, when the cultivators from the Great Qian Dynasty heard this, they narrowed their eyes.

That person had reached the unity realm at the age of 20? It seemed that the master of the Divine Gate was not simple. He was comparable to Ye Xuan!

After a little understanding, they finally discovered that the Divine Gate was the strongest force in the Nanzhou Region, and that the master of the Divine Gate was the strongest genius in the Nanzhou Region a thousand years ago. Now, he was considered the strongest cultivator in the Nanzhou Region. With a single move, he could shatter space.

“Such a monstrous existence! Then, what is his ranking on the Tower of Heaven’s lists?”

“Master of the Divine Gate, ranked 23,121st on the combat power rankings, and 3,621st in the qualification rankings!”

“Oh my God, is this for real? The master of the Divine Gate is the strongest cultivator in the Nanzhou Region and was the strongest genius of the Nanzhou Region a thousand years ago. Who would have thought that he would only be ranked around the 20,000th place on the combat power rankings and around the 3,000th place on the qualification rankings. Isn’t this too ridiculous?”

“Are the requirements of the Tower of Heaven’s rankings so harsh?”

Everyone’s eyes were filled with shock.

As the saying goes, there is no harm without comparison. Only now did they understand the severity of the Heavenly Divine Pagoda’s two lists!

“How can the master of the Divine Gate’s ranking be this low?”

“Well the rankings were taken during his first time entering the Tower of Heaven. At that time, the master of the Divine Gate was only 20 years old, and he was a half-step unity realm cultivator.”

“After he left the Tower of Heaven, he quickly reached the unity realm. If he had come back to the Tower of Heaven again after that, he would likely be able to obtain an outstanding ranking. Perhaps he might even have been able to enter the top 1,000 on the combat power rankings!”

Gongsun Yao explained.

Every time the master of the Divine Gate was mentioned, she would be extremely excited.

Moreover, she was extremely familiar with all kinds of rumors about the master of the Divine Gate. Since he was his idol, she knew almost everything about him.

Back then, the ranking of the master of the Divine Gate in the Tower of Heaven had indeed caused a stir among countless people. Moreover, after the mystic realm closed, he had only spent half a year to reach the unity realm at the age of 20, which caused an even greater sensation within the Nanzhou Region.

However, it was a pity that the master of the Divine Gate never entered the Moon Demon mystic realm and the Tower of Heaven ever again.

As for the reason behind that, only the master of the Divine Gate knew.

“Such a monstrous genius is only ranked around 3000th on the qualification rankings and around 20,000th on the combat power rankings? Then what kind of monsters are the others?”

“Those are all true peerless prodigies, and they are all existences from tens of thousands of years ago, or even hundreds of thousands of years ago!”

Then, everyone’s eyes involuntarily focused on the two lists.

“First place: Ye Tian, Actual Age: 22, 88 levels, Cangzhou Region, Moon Demon Holy Land!”

“Second place: Yun Tianya, Actual Age: 22, 88 levels, Cangzhou Region, Moon Demon Holy Land!”

“Third place: Nangong Beicheng, Actual Age: 23, 86 levels, Qianzhou Region, Yuqian Palace!”

…

“56th place: Xu Kai, Actual Age: 34, 79 levels, Sichuan Region, Glacier Ice Empire!”

…

“23121th place: Jun Lintian, Actual Age: 20, 71st level, Nanzhou Region, Divine Gate!”

The combat power list was filled with the various names of genius cultivators, dazzling everyone.

However, they noticed that the top 50 of the combat power and qualification rankings were basically the same.

However, after the top 50, these two ranking lists diverged.

This was because there were many cultivators close to the age of 50 who had relied on their powerful strength to enter the combat power ranks. However, in terms of talent, they were far inferior to those young cultivators on the qualifications rankings.

When everyone saw this, their eyes were filled with astonishment.

When they had just entered the War God Hall, they did not know the value of these two lists. However, now, they were truly enlightened.
