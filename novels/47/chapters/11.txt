Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

As soon as the system finished speaking, a bird filled with fiery red power appeared in Ye Xuan’s system storage space. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

This was the blazing plume gifted by the system. It was a powerful Tier 5 mount.

The blazing plume was similar to the firebird from before in terms of appearance, but the fiery red color of its feathers was more powerful and saturated. The strength of a Tier 5 demon beast was equivalent to that of a human cultivator at the empty core stage.

“Not bad!” Seeing this, Ye Xuan could not help but smile.

“Let’s go. You can familiarize yourself with the mount on the way!”

After Ye Xuan withdrew his spiritual sense, he said to Yue.

“Okay!” Yue nodded obediently, then slowly controlled the firebird to fly.

Screech!

The firebird faced the sky and let out a long cry. Its huge wings suddenly shook, and it slowly squatted down in front of Ye Xuan and Yue. When the two came behind it, it flapped its wings and flew up high.

However, just as the firebird was about to leave the Qingyun clan, a stream of light suddenly appeared. A figure then stood in front of Ye Xuan and Yue.

“Elder Ye, are you leaving the Qingyun clan?”

The stream of light slowly dissipated, revealing a woman with a curvy figure.

......

This woman was Elder Lin Qing from before.

“I want to bring Yue outside the clan to train!” Ye Xuan said.

“I see, no wonder... What?” Seeing this, Lin Qing could not help but look curious. Just as she was about to say something, her expression suddenly changed, and he stared at Yue.

“Ninth stage qi transformation state?”

When the difference in strength between cultivators was too wide, cultivators with high cultivation level could spot weak cultivation states at a glance.

Of course, if these weak cultivators had special methods to cover their states, they could indeed prevent others from seeing through their own cultivation realms.

However, Yue obviously did not have this.

In addition, Lin Qing’s cultivation had reached the middle stage of the empty state, so she could naturally see Yue’s state at a glance.

“This... How did you do this?” Lin Qing looked at Yue with a face full of shock.

If she remembered correctly, three days ago, this little girl had still been at a weak fourth stage refinement state. How could she have crossed such a large state in an instant?

Most importantly, this girl’s aura was extremely stable. She did not look weak at all.

“Elder Ye, what on Earth is...”

Lin Qing turned her head to look at Ye Xuan.

What else could be the reason behind a weak cultivator being able to cross such a large state in just three days?

There could only be two scenarios.

Firstly, a cultivator could have taught her everything very quickly, or perhaps the girl had awakened a rare physique in her cultivation.

However, even if it was a rare physique, it would be impossible to jump states so quickly. At least, to Lin Qing’s knowledge, there was no such physique capable of doing that.

Most importantly, even if this girl’s physique was really unique, it was impossible for her to not see any clues of it, right?

In that case, there was only one other possibility.

“Elder Lin, what’s the matter?”

Ye Xuan did not seem to see Lin Qing’s questioning expression. He spoke to her indifferently.

Seeing this, Lin Qing could not help but look at Ye Xuan with a complicated expression.

It was obvious that Ye Xuan did not want to reveal the matter of the spiritual power infusion, so he pretended not to understand her meaningful gaze.

Forget it! Since this guy does not want to say anything, why should I ask?

However, even so, Lin Qing was still extremely shocked in her heart.

“It’s like this. My two disciples have left the clan to train for two months. Their names are Huang Ling and Xue Min. I don’t know where they are right now. If Elder Ye happens to meet them outside, please bring them back to the clan for me!

“Soon, our Qingyun clan will hold a competition. After the competition, there will be another competition between the three great clans. The clan leader said that the competition rewards are very special, so I want to ask my two disciples to come back and participate!”

Lin Qing explained.

“Special rewards?” Hearing this, Ye Xuan could not help but perk up.

“That’s right!” Lin Qing nodded and said again.

“Whether it’s the grand competition of the Qingyun clan or the grand competition between the three major clans, the rewards will all be very special. It seems like they’ll be able to increase a cultivator’s comprehension value!”

“What?” Hearing this, Ye Xuan’s eyes immediately lit up before his gaze fell on Yue.

“In that case, Yue, you go and register too!”

“Yes, master!”

Now that Yue had absolute trust in Ye Xuan, she naturally would not question any of Ye Xuan’s decisions.

If her master asked her to participate, she would have to put in 120% of her effort to win and obtain victory.

Hearing this, Lin Qing could not help but look at Yue. She did not say anything.

Although it was indeed a very rare thing for Yue to have broken through to the ninth stage of the qi transformation state at her current age, there was still a huge gap between her and the more talented disciples of the Qingyun clan.

Especially the personal disciples that the clan master and elders had taken in. All of them had already reached the true essence state.

Perhaps when it came to interior disciples, Yue’s current strength was indeed outstanding, but if she wanted to compete with personal disciples, she would not currently have any chance of winning.

“I won’t be out for too long this time. If I meet Huang Ling and Xue Min, I’ll definitely bring them back!” Ye Xuan said.

If he ran into them by chance, he could of course bring them back. Otherwise, he could not be less bothered about them.

“Thank you, Elder Ye!” Lin Qing said with a smile.

“Well, in that case, we’ll be leaving first!” Ye Xuan nodded slightly, then the firebird flapped its wings and flew away.

Lin Qing’s gaze fell on the firebird in the air.. She could not help but reveal a hint of confusion on her face.

“Spiritual energy infusion... How could this guy waste so much energy on a girl with such mediocre talent? Didn’t he hate taking in disciples more than anyone before?”

For a moment, all kinds of questions popped into Lin Qing’s mind.
