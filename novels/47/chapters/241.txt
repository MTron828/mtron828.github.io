Chapter 242: Helpless

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Zhu Tuyuan was terrified!

Ye Xuan had clearly not gone all out when he had killed Guang Liang earlier.

How could there be such a freakish existence in this world?

Which b*stard had provoked this monster? Did the heavens want to annihilate the Nether God sect?

Boom!

Waves of destructive power swept out and wreaked havoc on the chaotic space.

Despite fighting two pattern condensation realm experts, Ye Xuan was at ease.

The three of them were engaged in a frenzied battle within the chaotic space!

When fighting Qian Daoliu, Ye Xuan had to use the triple intent fusion to resist Qian Daoliu’s attack. Although Ye Xuan could not hurt Qian Daoliu, the latter could not hurt him either.

Luckily for Ye Xuan, the natural laws he had comprehended were not attack-oriented, but rather defense-oriented. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

A strange scene began to play out.

When Ye Xuan fought Zhu Tuyuan, he would use dual intent fusion, but then he would switch things up and use triple intent fusion against Qian Daoliu.

Naturally, this meant that he was in a stalemate with both of them.

Seeing this, Jun Lingtian and Zhao Yuzhen were confused.

If they had been in Ye Xuan’s position, they would have chosen to try and kill Zhu Tuyuan first to reduce the number of enemies.

However, Ye Xuan seemed to have no intention of killing Zhu Tuyuan.

At first, they were full of doubts, but they were soon dumbfounded.

This guy was actually using the battle to comprehend martial intent!

They felt their blood run cold.

“Ye Xuan!”

The blood giant’s enormous finger pointed at Ye Xuan.

Qian Daoliu’s reaction was exactly the same as Li Tiangang’s. Shock and disbelief were evident on his face. Zhu Tuyuan was no better.

They had never encountered such a terrifying thing in their hundreds of years of cultivation.

This guy was simply a monster!

He was the devil!

The black mist giant immediately began to struggle, trying to escape the chaotic space, but how could Ye Xuan give him the chance to do so?

Inside this chaotic space, the power of Ye Xuan’s spatial intent was strengthened, so he could confine and block Zhu Tuyuan.

As such they were forced to keep fighting Ye Xuan.

A month passed by.

This was by far the longest battle Ye Xuan had ever fought.

Zhu Tuyuan was on the verge of a mental breakdown.

“Ye Xuan, let me go. I really don’t want to fight anymore!”

“As long as you let me go, I’ll leave immediately and swear to never touch the Qingyun sect.”

Zhu Tuyuan was desperate. He felt completely helpless being beaten up and used like this. Furthermore, with each passing moment, he could sense Ye Xuan’s strength increasing due to the comprehension of martial intents.

Qian Daoliu was not any better.

At first, he had appeared mocking and unconcerned, but now, the blood giant’s facial expression was extremely gloomy.

Two pattern condensation realm experts were being bullied by a tenth-level unity realm expert.

The reason why pattern condensation realm experts were so strong was because they used the power of the natural laws to form profound patterns and engrave them into their bodies. Naturally, these patterns were derived from intents.

In Qian Daoliu’s case, his profound patterns had been derived from blood essence intent and water intent, both of which were defensive in nature.

As such, although Ye Xuan’s sword qi was overbearing and full of destructive power, it could not cause any real damage to him.

However, since the two intents that had reached the level where they could be engraved into patterns were defensive in nature, he could only rely on his weaker martial intents to attack Ye Xuan, like those icicles formed by ice intent earlier.

Unfortunately, the attacks formed using these weaker intents were useless against Ye Xuan. Therefore, Qian Daoliu felt a deep sense of powerlessness.
