Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

As Zhuge Yueyue and Gongsun Zhi fought, more and more people gathered around them. They were all shocked by the monstrous aura of this sword move.

“Could this be an immortal- grade cultivation technique?”

Gong Sunzi was using an immortal- grade cultivation technique?

“Impossible! How could this brat possibly grasp such a profound technique? I definitely won’t believe it! ”

After noticing this situation, the golden tiger was the first to express his opinion.

He had a noble bloodline, and with the help of his clan, he had barely mastered an immortal- grade cultivation technique. Therefore, if Gongsun Zhi had managed to do the same by virtue of his own talent, it meant that the golden tiger was inferior to him.

Just how terrifying was his level of talent?

Zhuge Yueyue was also quite surprised, but began to make preparations to deal with it. Since her opponent had already used his trump cards, she had to use hers as well.

“Isn’t it just an immortal- grade cultivation technique? Let’s see whose one is better then.’

After she said that, Zhuge Yueyue’s eyes suddenly flashed with a blue light. The next moment, the world shook violently again.

The Cloud Heaven Sword floated in the sky, releasing waves of powerful sword aura.

“Oh my god, is that another immortal- grade cultivation technique?”

“Are immortal- grade cultivation techniques so easy to come by now? Why does everyone seem to have one?”

The most shocking thing was that the two of them seemed to have truly grasped the mysteries of their immortal- grade cultivation techniques. This alone put them far above the other geniuses present.

It was precisely because of this reason that some of the disciples who liked to call themselves geniuses felt extremely embarrassed at this moment. Compared to these two, could they really be considered geniuses?

Zhuge Yueyue was floating in the sky, her long dress fluttering in the wind. Then, she said with a cold expression.

“Worldly Slash! ”

With that single command, the Cloud Heaven Sword immediately released an even more dazzling sword aura, and it felt as if the whole world had been frozen.

As the cold sword aura swept out, everyone’s souls seemed to be frozen.

This sword move was created by Zhuge Yueyue combining her own cold aura with the World Slash. It was different from the original World Slash, and its power was also greatly improved.

The two terrifying sword attacks collided once again, creating shockwaves that could be felt throughout the entire treasury. Those who sensed these shockwaves were taken aback.

What was going on? Could it be that a rare treasure had appeared?

With their curiosity piqued, many of them flew in the direction of the battle to see what the commotion was all about.

On the battlefield, due to the repeated collisions, both sides were constantly retreating.

Zhuge Yueyue’s beautiful face had turned extremely pale at this moment, and she could not help but spit out a mouthful of blood. Her condition had become much worse.

However, her gaze was still extremely cold. After wiping the blood from the corner of her mouth, she stood upright.

Gongsun Zhi was in an even worse state. His original white clothes were now covered in blood and in tatters. If one did not know, one would even think that he was a beggar who had just been bullied on the streets.

His entire body was trembling, and his gaze was dull. He could not believe what was happening in front of him.

“How could it be… How could I fail?”

“Why is this? I’ve been the peerless genius of the Immortal Palace since I was born. I’ve gone through countless dangers and trials to reach this level. How could I fail?!”

Gong Sun Zhi shouted at the top of his lungs. He looked at the sword in his hand, and could not believe what was happening.

“I’m the one with the Flowing Cloud Sword. Which genius in this world can compare to me? This is definitely not happening!’

At this moment, he was in a state of madness. He was filled with endless anger, and wanted nothing more than to tear Zhuge Yueyue apart.

He stood up shakily, his eyes red as if he had entered a demonized state.

Zhuge Yueyue stared at him coldly and said, “You are really funny. The only reason you are even still standing is because of this sword in your hand.”

“The confidence you have was given to you by this sword. As a sword cultivator, you have forgotten the original heart of a swordsman.” “My teacher has reminded me many times that if you want to win a battle, the most important thing is not how powerful your weapon is, but your own body.”

“You relied too much on your sword, so you lost to me!”

After hearing Zhuge Yueyue’s words, Gongsun Zhi completely collapsed. Every word was hammered into his heart.Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Impossible!”

Gongsun Zhi had gone completely crazy. He was the top swordsman in this world. No one could compare to him!

He started laughing like a maniac. His hair was disheveled, and he had become a lunatic.

“Haha! I am the most powerful genius in this world, an existence that no one can match!”

“No one can deny that, and no one can defeat me. It’s the same for you!’

He was unwilling to give up the fight.

As for Yueyue, by this time, she had adjusted her condition and taken a pill at the same time, allowing her to recover quite a bit, though not quite to her peak.

On the other hand, after Gongsun Zhi entered the demonized state, the aura he released became much stronger..
