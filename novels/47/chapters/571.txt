572 Purchasing Medicinal Herbs

Ye Xuan smiled and said, “You’re too polite.”

“I’ve already inquired about it. The businesses of the Qingyang Restaurant encompass a very wide scope, and have even spread to most areas of the East continent.”

“Therefore, I came here today to ask for your help.”

After hearing this, Han Sikong shivered and said, “Sir, just tell me what needs to be done. As long as it’s within my abilities, I will do my best to accomplish it.”

!!

That was what he said, but Han Sikong was terrified. Who would ask for help like this? Who would release such a terrifying aura and then ask for help?

After hearing Han Sikong’s answer, Ye Xuan found a place to sit down and took out a piece of paper from his storage space. On it was a list of all kinds of herbs.

“Actually, it’s not a big deal. I just want to collect some herbs. Since you have your hands in a wide range of businesses, I just want your help in collecting them.”

Hearing that, Han Sikong quickly looked at the list of herbs. Although some of them were not very common, they could still be purchased with a little effort.

In fact, it was not particularly difficult for him to obtain these herbs.

However, he had no idea what Y Xuan was going to do with so many herbs.

Was he going to use it to refine pills?

In any case, that was none of his business. What did make him happy though was that this was an opportunity to establish a relationship with Ye Xuan!

Ye Xuan’s fame had already spread far and wide. His combat ability was unparalleled, and he was known as the number one genius in the East continent. Furthermore, he was a supreme realm expert!

If they could build a good relationship with him, it would be extremely beneficial to the Qingyang Restaurant.

As the person in charge of the Qingyang Restaurant and a capable merchant, he had already made his decision.

“Ah, so it was like this. Just leave this to us.” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“It won’t be a problem for us to purchase these herbs, and I’ll definitely get them all sent to Cloud Sky peak as soon as I can.”

“However, we won’t accept any payment for this. Think of this as a small gift from our Qingyang Restaurant. What do you think?”

Han Sikong said all this as he looked at Ye Xuan expectantly. It was obvious that he wanted to be on good terms with Ye Xuan. However, the ball was in Ye Xuan’s court, not his.

Ye Xuan looked at Han Sikong indifferently. He obviously knew what Han Sikong’s intentions were. After thinking for a moment, he said, “There’s no need for such an arrangement.”

“I have enough money to pay for it, and it’s enough that you show your sincerity. After all, as cultivators, we hate to owe others things.”

“You should understand this, right?”

“Alright, alright, I understand,” Han Sikong quickly replied. Although he was a little disappointed, it was still proceeding in a favorable direction.

“How about this then? We’ll sell you the herbs we bought at cost price.”

Ye Xuan looked at Han Sikong indifferently. It seemed like Han Sikong was really trying to make friends with him.

Well, since he was this persistent, it would be a bit discourteous to keep rejecting the offer, and it might sour the relationship.

Ye Xuan said very calmly, “Alright, you can set the prices yourself. Just don’t overstep your boundaries.”

He had only come to purchase medicinal herbs to prepare the required materials for alchemy.

When he was in the ancient tomb, Ye Xuan had already thought about doing this.

Originally, he was prepared to leave this matter to the Su family, but there were too many herbs he required, so it was not convenient for the Su family to purchase them, as they lacked the necessary networks and connections.

As such, he had come to the Qingyang Restaurant instead to purchase the items.

Ye Xuan did not really care about the price of these herbs. After all, money was just a number to him.

Han Sikong said with a smile after carefully putting away the list Ye Xuan gave him, “Sir, just leave this matter to us. We’ll definitely satisfy your requirements.”

Ye Xuan was relieved to hear Han Sikong’s words.

Purchasing all these herbs was not something that could be done in a short time by just anyone. After thinking for a moment, Ye Xuan was already preparing to deal with other matters.

He had already thought of these things, but unfortunately, he had not had the time to do so recently.

Now, he should take advantage of this period of time to complete these things.

Ye Xuan asked in a flat tone, “It seems that your Qingyang Restaurant is also involved in the auction business, right?”

After being momentarily stunned, Han Sikong quickly said, “Yes, we are. Does Sir want to auction off some treasures?”

“That’s right, I do have some treasures that I want to sell, but this matter isn’t urgent. Let’s discuss it later.”

After saying that, Ye Xuan glanced at his two disciples while saying, “Help me to prepare a room first. There are some other things that I need to settle first.”

Han Sikong quickly replied, “Okay, I’ll get someone to arrange the best room here for you now.”

“Kaizi, go and make the arrangements now.”

Upon hearing this, the servant immediately said in a trembling voice, “”Alright… Alright, I’ll go immediately.”

At first, the servant had thought Ye Xuan was just a rich man’s son. Unexpectedly, even Lord Han Sikong, whom he admired so much, kept trying to please him.

It was obvious how powerful this person was.

At this moment, the servant was already sweating profusely. He was afraid that if he accidentally provoked him, he would lose his life.

Thinking about it, he felt very scared. Fortunately, this expert was magnanimous. Otherwise, he would not have lived after what he had done.

The servant quickly guided the three of them to a luxurious suite.

Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun were both very puzzled. What matters did their teacher have to settle in Qingyang City?
