922 Thunder-Devouring Beast

After calming herself down for a moment, Yanran’s emotions gradually stabilized as she looked at Ye Xuan and replied, “That fleeing shadow is an immortal heavenly treasure. It’s called the Scarlet Blood Spirit Fruit.”

“This…”

Everyone was stunned to hear that. This was a top-grade spiritual fruit!

Initially, Ye Xuan did not intend to fight for this treasure, but now he had changed his mind.

“This is interesting. No wonder it ran away. It’s actually a supreme-grade spiritual fruit that has already gained intelligence!””

If he could obtain it and give it to Yanran, he would likely receive a bountiful reward from the system.

Thinking this, Ye Xuan’s mouth curled up into a smile. He was only inches away from the eternal realm, so a reward like that might be enough for him to break through.

If he was lucky enough, he could even obtain a 10,000x critical reward. How awesome would that be? The more he thought about it, the happier he became.

“What are you laughing at?”

Seeing the sly smile on Ye Xuan’s face, Yanran had goosebumps. Was this guy thinking naughty things again? Furthermore, he was still hugging her, which caused her heart to beat wildly.

“Hehe, it’s nothing really. I just suddenly thought of something nice.”

Ye Xuan could not help but chuckle when he saw her expression. He eased the awkwardness by patting her head..

“Yanran, just wait for me here. I’ll be back soon with the immortal heavenly treasure for you.”

As he spoke, he did not forget to wink at Yanran, causing her heart to flutter. Her face instantly turned red. However, she also smiled. She knew that Ye Xuan would definitely succeed. After all, he had never failed to deliver on anything he promised her.

Because of this, Yanran was very touched. It seemed that her sweetheart was going to use this treasure to buy her heart. Although she felt it was unnecessary, she still liked how he treated her.

Honestly, no matter what Ye Xuan gave her, she would be very happy and treat it as a treasure. She adjusted her expression as she reminded him, “Remember to be careful. There seem to be other restrictions in this place. I was almost seriously injured just now.”

Hearing his words, Ye Xuan nodded. Then, he looked at the other experts, who were not far away. They had also stopped chasing the treasure, and could only watch helplessly as it flew away.

“This is interesting. Let me take a good look. I want to see if these restrictions can stop me.” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

After Ye Xuan said this, he let Yanran go and walked forward slowly. When he reached the others, he sensed a terrifying power emanating from the walls surrounding the palace complex.

Anyone who touched it would definitely be pushed back, and perhaps even be injured. After sweeping the area with his spiritual sense, Ye Xuan smiled and muttered to himself, “Found it.”

As soon as he finished his words, Ye Xuan’s hands instantly formed different seals, and his spiritual power slammed into a part of the wall.

In the blink of an eye, the space in front of him seemed to become distorted and torn apart. Then, something emerged.

“Thunder-Devouring Beast?”

When the others saw this huge creature, they all let out exclamations of surprise. Thunder-Devouring Beast was a divine beast that only existed in ancient books. It was a powerful beast that could be compared to true immortals in terms of strength!

“This definitely can’t be real. Why does the Mystic World contain such a powerful beast?”

Everyone was panicking at this moment. They could not believe what they were seeing.

After all, in the Mystic World, there were restrictions imposed by the laws of the world, which meant that one’s cultivation level was limited to the sealed immortal realm.

This was also the fundamental reason why Ye Xuan could kill those experts from the sealed immortal realm so frequently.

However, this Thunder-Devouring Beast was actually not suppressed by the laws of the world, and was a bona fide true immortal. It was not something they could deal with at all.

The moment the Thunder-Devouring Beast appeared, everyone finally came to a realization. It was no wonder the Scarlet Blood Spirit Fruit had been placed here for such a long time without being taken away. It was actually protected by the Thunder-Devouring Beast!

“Damn it! If we can’t deal with this beast, we definitely won’t be able to obtain the Scarlet Blood Spirit Fruit.”

In the face of such a powerful opponent, no matter how strong their desire for the Scarlet Blood Spirit Fruit was, they did not dare to rashly approach the treasure.

The aura released by the Thunder-Devouring Beast was terrifying. Even Ye Xuan could feel his breathing becoming hurried at this moment. He only returned to normal after spending some time calming himself down.

“I really didn’t expect to find such a terrifying beast in this ancient palace.”

Ye Xuan sucked in a deep breath. Then, he secretly mobilized his strength.

After Ye Xuan broke the wall, the Thunder-Devouring Beast let out a loud roar. Then, it stared angrily at Ye Xuan and released a terrifying amount of force, and even Ye Xuan was sent flying back hundreds of meters.

Seeing this, Yanran immediately flashed forward and caught Ye Xuan firmly. She asked with concern, “Ye Xuan, are you alright?”

It was only the first exchange, yet Ye Xuan had already suffered a small loss. The onlookers nearby were secretly delighted.

“Haha, this guy is too bold. He was asking for it,” a burly man said, and many people nodded in agreement.
