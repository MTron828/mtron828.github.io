290 A Group Of Rats And Ants

As for why Ye Xuan gave those instructions?

Well, he had the power of karma, so he could vaguely predict certain matters that were related to him.

Therefore, he knew that a number of people coveted his Tower of Heaven,

After all, who would not be tempted by such a precious treasure?

However, they did not know that once they obtained the Tower of Heaven, they would have to bear the corresponding karma.

In order to avoid any unforeseen circumstances, Ye Xuan had also used the power of karma to deduce the possibilities.

Those who would come to fight for the Tower of Heaven were basically nobodies, and Shangguan Wan’er’s strength was sufficient to deal with them.

“Oh right! I’ll leave this with you as well!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan took out a jade token and handed it to Shangguan Wan’er.

“Ding! As the host has given his disciple a jade token (advanced-stage Heavenly King realm) to his disciple, the host has received a randomized 3x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained a jade token (advanced-stage Heavenly King realm)!”

Seeing this, Ye Xuan frowned.

They were both advanced-stage Heavenly King realm jade tokens, but the difference in strength between the two was actually more than three times.

It seemed like the strength of the king realm was indeed closely related to the number of profound patterns one engraved into their bodies during the pattern condensation realm.

“Alright, Teacher!”

Shangguan Wan’er did not hesitate and accepted the jade token.

After receiving so many benefits from her teacher, she was grateful, but at the same time, she did not know how to repay her teacher’s kindness.

However, an opportunity had now presented itself.

“I’ll personally deal with those annoying ants!”

“By the way, I’m sure you’ve comprehended quite a few profound patterns. Let me take a look.”

Ye Xuan seemed to have thought of something, and his gaze fell on Shangguan Wan’er.

“Okay!”

Shangguan Wan’er nodded her head obediently, then layers of mysterious fluctuations rippled around her body.

The profound pattern of ice!

The profound pattern of the sword!

The profound pattern of water!

The profound pattern of metal!

There were a total of four profound patterns.

The profound pattern of the sword provided her with strong offensive power, while the profound pattern of water and metal belonged to the category of the five elements, so their power and utility was unquestionable.

The profound pattern of ice was a derivation of the profound pattern of water, and was thus more powerful.

It was said that if the profound pattern of ice was comprehended to a certain level, one could freeze their surroundings with a single thought. Even the soul and spiritual sense could be frozen.

Buzzzzzz!

At this moment, Shangguan Wan’er smiled and slowly raised her hand.

The four powerful intents suddenly fused together and erupted with a destructive power.

Ye Xuan was not surprised at all.

After all, Shangguan Wan’er’s comprehension value was 798, so it was only natural for her to be able to fuse four martial intents.

However, what surprised Ye Xuan was that Shangguan Wan’er’s comprehension of all four martial intents had reached the seventh level.

When such high-level martial intents were fused, what kind of power would they exhibit?

As expected of the reincarnation of an ancient great empress. She was truly a monster!

“Alright, your fifth profound pattern will be derived from slaughter intent. As for the remaining five, I will personally help you comprehend supreme intents,” Ye Xuan said.

Ye Xuan naturally would not be stingy and would do his best to make his disciples as strong as they could be. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Many thanks, Teacher!”

Shangguan Wan’er looked at Ye Xuan’s serious expression with a touched look on her face.

Ever since she had awakened a portion of the memories from her previous life, she had never relied on anyone.

That was because Shangguan Wan’er believed that with her talent and the memories of her previous life, she would walk an invincible path.

However, when she met Ye Xuan, everything changed.

Everything about him shocked her.

“Alright, You can go now,” Ye Xuan said.

“Yes, Teacher!”

After that, Shangguan Wan’er stood up and left the Tower of Heaven.

Ye Xuan, on the other hand, began his secluded cultivation in the depths of the spatial turbulence.

Buzzzzzz!

Shangguan Wan’er looked deeply in the direction of the Tower of Heaven, then stretched out her hand to tear space apart and return to the Qingyun sect.

However, as soon as Shangguan Wan’er arrived at the Qingyun sect, she suddenly sensed a few concealed auras.

“Hmph! Teacher was right, there really are some annoying flies!”

Shangguan Wan’er’s eyes turned cold.

Without Ye Xuan by her side, Shangguan Wan’er reverted to her previous noble demeanor.

Her spiritual sense was also far stronger than other cultivators in the same realm. Furthermore, these people were weaker than she was!

The people who came were basically all pattern condensation realm experts.

Those existences above the pattern condensation realm had been held back by the ancestor of the Divine Gate Holy Land.

Of course, even if a King realm existence really descended, with the jade tokens Ye Xuan had left his disciples, what was there to fear?

Buzzzzzz!

Shangguan Wan’er had always done things cleanly and decisively. Brilliant sword qi erupted, and swept toward one of those concealed auras.

Boom!

The terrifying sword qi split the cultivator in half.

Of course, the profound patterns in the cultivator’s body erupted with power and instantly healed his body.

“You bunch of rats and ants, hurry up and get out here!”

Shangguan Wan’er hovered in the sky, the longsword in her hand shining with a bright light, intimidating everyone around her.

“Shangguan Wan’er!”

“Why did you attack me? I have done nothing to your Luo Heaven Palace!”

The expression of the cultivator who had just reformed his body was extremely unsightly.

As the most powerful cultivator in the Miaoling Region, she was naturally well-known in the Huangyu Zone. They quickly recognized Shangguan Wan’er.

Shangguan Wan’er looked at the latter expressionlessly. Without saying another word, another wave of destructive sword qi swept out.

However, this time, the sword qi contained the sword, water, and metal intents.

The triple intent fusion of seventh-level intents could easily tear space apart and shatter mountains and rivers.

In an instant, spatial cracks appeared everywhere.

The cultivator did not have time to dodge and was turned into dust by the terrifying sword qi.

Even his soul dissipated!
