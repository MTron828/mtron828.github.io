427 Breaking Through

“Uh…”

Hua Rufeng was dumbfounded. This time, he heard it very clearly.

Third level of the divine mystic realm!

‘Are you f*cking kidding me?’

Even the young man who had joined the Great Wilderness Divine sect at the same time as Zhuge Yueyue was only at the eighth level of the mystic meridian realm.

Having reached this level in just two months, he was already considered a peerless genius of the younger generation of the Great Wilderness Divine sect.

During this period of time, Gao Shun had been quite pleased with himself, showing off his disciple in front of the other chiefs every day.

However, compared to Chief Ye Xuan’s disciple, was that guy not just trash?

Thinking this, Hua Rufeng wondered what Gao Shun’s reaction would be when he found out the cultivation levels of Ye Xuan’s two disciples.

“Hahaha…”

As soon as this image appeared in his mind, Hua Rufeng could not help but laugh.

However, he soon realized that he had lost his composure and quickly apologized.

“I’m really sorry. I suddenly thought of something happy and couldn’t restrain myself.”

When Feng Xiyun and Zhuge Yueyue saw this, they glanced at each other. Then, Feng Xiyun whispered, “Senior Sister, why do I feel that Senior Brother Hua is rather strange? Weren’t we talking about cultivation levels? Why did he suddenly laugh?”

Zhuge Yueyue’s mouth twitched. She did not know how to reply.

From the looks of it, Senior Brother Hua was indeed a little abnormal.

Teacher was the best. No matter what happened, he was able to remain calm and composed.

Hua Rufeng’s expression became extremely awkward and he quickly coughed a few times.

“Cough cough … Martial Uncle Ye, the cultivation of these two junior sisters really shocked me!”

“Master Uncle Ye is truly gifted at both cultivation and teaching disciples.”

“If the other chiefs find out, they would definitely be shocked.”

“Actually, it’s nothing much. I was just casually teaching them,” Ye Xuan said lightly.

“Uh…”

Hearing this, Hua Rufeng’s mouth twitched. Was this guy not showing off? Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Martial Uncle Ye is really modest. I’ve learned a lot.”

At this moment, Zhuge Yueyue was indeed curious.

“Teacher, what’s going on at Cloud Sky peak? Why are there so many people here?”

“That’s right. When we came back just now, we suddenly found that there were a lot of people in the peach forest to the north. They seem to be building something!”

Ye Xuan’s eyes twitched slightly. He did not answer immediately, but took a sip of the tea that Su Changhe had just given him.

It indeed tasted a little bitter when it first entered his mouth, but after carefully savoring it, the tip of his tongue was filled with a faint fragrance.

It was bitter, and then sweet.

“Ah …” Ye Xuan could not help but sigh. The taste of wealth was really different!

He had naturally heard of the name of this bitter spirit tea before. It was a specialty of Qingyang City. The price was extremely high, and those who could enjoy this kind of tea were mostly aristocrats.

“Cough cough!” As if sensing the resentful gazes of his two disciples, Ye Xuan coughed briefly before starting to explain.

“Those people are all from the Su family. They brought many gifts to our Cloud Sky peak, including ten thousand taels of profound gold. Oh right, they’re planning to build a palace for us in the peach forest.”

Feng Xiyun and Zhuge Yueyue’s eyes lit up when they heard this.

“Is it true?”

In these few days, Zhuge YueYue had brought Feng Xiyun to tour the other peaks, which were all magnificent in comparison to Cloud Sky peak, and had far better living conditions.

“Does that mean we’ll have a palace to live in in the future?”

“That’s right! I’m sure that the palace will be pretty large once it’s completed. At that time, you can choose whichever room or building you want,” Ye Xuan smiled and said.

“However, as cultivators, your priority should be on cultivation. Don’t get carried away with worldly possessions.”

“In the path of cultivation, the most important thing is to follow one’s heart. When one’s heart is clear, one’s actions will flow naturally.”

Hua Rufeng was stunned.

He had not expected Ye Xuan to have such a deep understanding of the laws of the world. It was truly shocking.

It was no wonder he managed to break through to the mystic lord realm at such a young age.

Hua Rufeng’s eyes revealed a look of enlightenment.

As the eldest senior disciple of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, he seemed to have restrained his Dao heart too much over the years because of his identity, and cared too much about what others thought.

This caused him to be extremely cautious in everything he did. He wanted to achieve perfection so that he would not be criticized by others.

However, he did not expect that it would cause him to almost forget his original heart for cultivation.

Thinking this, Hua Rufeng became emotional.

In fact, he was quite talented in cultivation. Even if he was compared to Mu Beichen, he was not much weaker. Yet, the latter had surpassed him by four levels, which dealt a huge blow to his self-confidence.

However, now that he heard Ye Xuan’s words, he suddenly had an epiphany.

After Ye Xuan finished speaking, a magical aura suddenly gushed out from Hua Rufeng’s body.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan could not help but raise his eyebrows.

“Hmm, could it be that this kid is about to break through?”
