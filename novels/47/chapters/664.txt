665 Li Hong (Part 1)

After hearing Li Hong’s words, everyone present was shocked.

Was this young man actually Daoist Gu Hao’s personal disciple?

If that was the case, would he and Daoist Black Iron be of the same status?

It seemed that this young man was extraordinarily talented.

!!

Seeing Li Hong slowly approaching the entrance, Gu Hao was very proud.

“Haha, Ye Xuan, this exceeded your expectations, right?”

“I prepared a backup plan specifically to deal with your disciples. Just wait and see as my disciple tears yours apart.”

Gao Shun involuntarily frowned when he heard this. He could tell that this young man had reached the advanced-stage of the void realm.

Could Feng Xiyun and Xiang Yun handle this newcomer?

Thinking this, Gao Shun started to worry.

“Junior Brother Ye, this fellow actually played a dirty trick. How about I ask Tianyu to come back down and help,” he whispered to Ye Xuan.

After hearing this, Ye Xuan smiled and watched Li Hong enter the ancient realm.

“There’s no need for that. My two disciples can handle him.”

Yuelun and Gao Shun were somewhat stunned. Ye Xuan looked pretty confident. Did he have some sort of backup plan as well?

Since Ye Xuan was not worried about it, then they decided that things would be fine. This junior brother of theirs was almost never wrong anyway.

Gao Shun looked at Li Hong’s figure from afar and sighed.

“The backup plan you left behind is this kid, huh? He looks quite strong. I hope he won’t disappoint me.”

Daoist Gu Hao replied calmly but proudly, “No, no, he’s not that strong. However, he’s more than strong enough for him to deal with those two girls.”

“Oh? Since you’re so confident, then let’s take a good look at what happens.”

At this moment, in the ancient realm, Xiang Yun was really having fun.

No one here could withstand her hammer. It felt like smashing vegetables, and she was enjoying herself thoroughly.

Liu Yun watched helplessly as the huge hammer descended upon him. He had no time to react at all.

Just when he thought that it was all over, a shiny black broadsword flew over and blocked the hammer.

By the time he reacted, he saw a young man slowly walking over. Liu Yun was momentarily stunned before he immediately greeted the newcomer, “Liu Yun greets Martial Uncle Li Hong.”

“Stand behind me. I’ll take over this battle.”

Li Hong smiled and asked Liu Yun to fall back. Then, he walked toward Xiang Yun.

From Li Hong’s gaze, it was as if he was looking at a plaything.

Sensing the aura emanating from his body, Feng Xiyun immediately stopped Xiang Yun from attacking and said, “Third Sister, stop for now.”

“This person is quite strong, so let me take over.”

Hearing this, Xiang Yun glanced at Li Hong. Seeing his arrogant appearance, she wished that she could swing her hammer at him. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Although she was still unhappy, she acquiesced to Feng Xiyun’s request.

It was not that she could not do it, but she would have to use the Endless Lightning skill that her teacher had taught her, which she still could not use skillfully.

Ye Xuan had also warned her not to use it unless she was in a real crisis, as one wrong move could result in a serious backlash.

“Alright, Second Sister. I’ll leave this disgusting fellow to you. If you can’t beat him later, I’ll help you.”

Feng Xiyun almost facepalmed.

Did her third sister not think very highly of her ability?

“Third Sister, listen to me. Just stay here and wait for me. Don’t wander about.”

As soon as she finished speaking, Feng Xiyun rubbed Xiang Yun’s little head and walked toward Li Hong.

She then waved her hands, and extremely terrifying flames condensed in her palms.

Seeing this, Li Hong was shocked.

“Is that… the Heaven Burning Flames? That’s something that only exists in ancient books.”

However, after taking a second look, Li Hong finally heaved a sigh of relief and said with a cold expression, “Haha, that’s just a fake version of the Heaven Burning Flames. You almost had me there.”
