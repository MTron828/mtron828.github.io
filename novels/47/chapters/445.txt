446 Tit For Tat

“Greetings, Elder Tongtian,” Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun greeted respectfully.

“Mm! Chief Ye Xuan, your two disciples are quite extraordinary!”

Elder Tongtian could naturally detect their divine bones, and their exceptional level of talent.

Ye Xuan smiled and was about to respond, but Gao Shun chose this moment to chime in, in a slightly mocking tone.

!!

“Junior Brother Ye, your two disciples have received such praise from Elder Tongtian. I’m sure they’ll do well in the Seven Peaks competition.”

“In comparison, my disciples seem a little lacking!”

Elder Tongtian narrowed his eyes.

He could clearly sense the animosity between Ye Xuan and Gao Shun.

It seemed that there would be a show to watch today.

Ye Xuan did not respond to Gao Shun, but turned to look at his two disciples.

“Did you girls hear that? Your Martial Uncle Gao thinks very highly of you two, so don’t let him down.”

“Don’t worry, Teacher. We won’t let him down.”

Feng Xiyun smiled lightly. Since Gao Shun had arranged for them to fight Hidden Sword peak disciples, she would show him what’s up.

The atmosphere turned rather strange.

Even though the two chiefs appeared to be rather polite on the surface, there was actually an undercurrent of animosity.

Behind Gao Shun stood a youth dressed in green.

This was Xiao Feng, who came from the same village as Zhuge Yueyue and Li Xue’er.

Seeing Zhuge Yueyue’s confident expression, Xiao Feng’s face was filled with complicated emotions.

He had been the one the chiefs fought over to recruit back then, but Zhuge Yueyue was now much stronger than he was.

It could be said that because of Zhuge Yueyue, Xiao Feng had been neglected by Gao Shun. Xiao Feng looked enviously at Ye Xuan.

How good would it have been if he had been the one to become Chief Ye Xuan’s disciple.

However, the people around him did not notice Xiao Feng’s unusual expression.

Ye Xuan said to Feng Xiyun after looking at the arena.

“My precious disciple, you should head out now.”

“En!” Feng Xiyun nodded respectfully, and then walked toward the arena.

“The competition has finally begun!”

“I didn’t expect the first match of the competition to be between Cloud Sky peak and Hidden Sword peak. This is going to be interesting!” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Seeing Feng Xiyun walk toward the arena, the crowd instantly became excited. Everyone knew about the conflict between the two peaks, so this would definitely be an explosive match.

At this moment, the first arena was the most lively, as most of the spectators had chosen to watch Feng Xiyun’s battle.

“I heard that this junior sister only joined the sect a month ago. Her cultivation level should not be particularly high. Do you think she’ll lose without putting up a fight?”

“It’s hard to say. After all, she’s Chief Ye Xuan’s disciple. In any case, we’re all only here to watch the show.”

When Feng Xiyun reached the arena, Gao Shun’s mouth curved into a cold smile. He then gestured to a disciple behind him.

“Go!”

“Teacher, don’t worry. I definitely won’t let you down!”

Feng Xiyun’s opponent was called Wang Zuo. After hearing Gao Shun’s words, the corners of his mouth curved into a smile and he leapt up.

Wang Zuo’s body was emitting a bright red light as he flew toward the arena.

In that instant, the crowd erupted with excitement as everyone started shouting and cheering.

Elder Tongtian was surprised to see this.

“Fellow Daoist Gao, I didn’t expect your disciple to be a practitioner of a fire secret technique!”

Gao Shun smiled and nodded his head, “This disciple of mine, although his cultivation is lacking, his constitution has a natural affinity with fire, which is why I allowed him to cultivate the secret technique.”

“There’s no need to be so modest. Such a constitution is extremely rare.”

“It seems that Fellow Daoist Gao’s disciples are all extraordinary talents!”

Elder Tongtian smiled and then looked at Ye Xuan.

When he noticed that the latter’s expression had not changed and remained calm, he became even more curious.

Could it be that Ye Xuan’s disciple possessed something even more extraordinary?

When Gao Shun heard that, the smile on his face grew even wider as he said proudly, “Fellow Daoist Tongtian, you may not know this, but although my disciple’s constitution is rare, it cannot be compared to Junior Brother Ye’s disciple!”

“That girl is Junior Brother Ye’s second disciple. She is a peerless genius with a high-level divine bone.”

Gao Shun intentionally revealed the fact that Feng Xiyun possessed a high-level divine bone to exaggerate her level of talent. Once she lost, he could use this to humiliate Ye Xuan.

Hearing this, Ye Xuan looked at Gao Shun indifferently.

“Senior Brother Gao’s words are true. My disciple is indeed very talented, but it’s a pity that she has only started cultivating a month ago. In comparison to Senior Brother’s disciple, who has been cultivating for three to four years, she hasn’t had enough time.”

“Senior Brother, since your disciple has been cultivating for so long, I’m sure that he has reached the materialization realm, right?”

When Gao Shun heard that, his expression immediately turned ugly.

He naturally knew in his heart that Ye Xuan had deliberately mentioned the gap between how long they had been cultivating.

Thus, even if Feng Xiyun was defeated by Wang Zuo, there was an excuse.

...

Elder Tongtian simply smiled when he heard this.

However, Mu Beichen was watching Feng Xiyun like a hawk.

He had an inexplicable feeling that Feng Xiyun was definitely not as simple as she looked.
