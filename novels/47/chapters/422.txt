Zhuge Yueyue had already reached the second level of the materialization realm, and the combat training had helped her stabilize and solidify her cultivation foundation.

It could be said that Zhuge Yueyue was completely different from the unwanted girl who was isolated in the meeting hall more than two months ago.

Perhaps Zhuge Yueyue had not realized it, but her current abilities had already reached a level where cultivators of the same generation could only look up to her. She now stood on the same level as many of the peerless geniuses of the East continent.

“Your Cloud Sky sword technique is already close to reaching the major mastery stage. It’s a pity that you don’t have a real lethal technique yet.”

“Still, there’s no hurry for that. I’ll pick out a suitable technique for you later.”

Zhuge Yueyue’s eyes lit up.

“Thank you, Teacher. You’re the best!”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan immediately smiled. He was very satisfied with this disciple of his.

Soon after, Ye Xuan’s gaze fell on Feng Xiyun.

“Xiyun, it’s your turn!” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Ah, right.”

Feng Xiyun had been spectating the battle between the two, so she was a little caught out when Ye Xuan suddenly called her name.

Ye Xuan’s mouth twitched when he saw this.

This new disciple of his was a little air-headed at times.

“Yes Teacher. I’m coming over now.”

Feng Xiyun naturally realized it as well and hurried over.

“Let’s begin. Like Yueyue, you use any move you want.”

Ye Xuan stretched out his right hand and signaled Feng Xiyun to start attacking.

“Alright Teacher. You have to be careful!”

Then, her expression turned serious as the spiritual power in her body gushed out and filled the surroundings with raging flames.

This fire was the Hellfire technique that Ye Xuan had taught her!

Seeing this, Ye Xuan was a little surprised.

He did not expect that the combination of the Hellfire technique and her divine bone would be able to unleash such a powerful force.

‘Very good! It seems that the divine power I imparted to her is very suitable for this girl!’

Ye Xuan nodded, but did not say anything.

Feng Xiyun was only a second-level divine mystic realm cultivator. However, the divine bone in her body still contained a lot of energy. If she could perfectly absorb it, she would eventually be able to catch up to Zhuge Yueyue’s cultivation level.

Of course, this was a matter of time. If she was too hasty, it was very likely to affect her cultivation foundation.

“Let’s start!” Ye Xuan said lightly.

Feng Xiyun suddenly erupted with the power of fire, and her figure left a series of afterimages as she used the Hellfire technique to bombard Ye Xuan.

The surging power of fire turned the surrounding bamboo plants into ashes as smoke filled the air. Amidst the flames, a hand snaked out and tried to punch Ye Xuan in the abdomen.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan’s lips curled up. Then, he flashed to the side and grabbed Feng Xiyun’s hand.

Moments later, the true dragon patterns within Ye Xuan’s body suddenly erupted, suppressing the Hellfire technique.

At this moment, Feng Xiyun revealed a cunning smile.

Suddenly, a dazzling pattern appeared on Feng Xiyun’s hand as she broke free from Ye Xuan’s grasp. As she opened her arms, the flames that filled the sky suddenly transformed into a raging fire dragon that shot toward Ye Xuan.

‘Hmm, this girl is quite smart!’

Ye Xuan raised his eyebrows.

Normally, cultivators would use the power of fire to attack, but this girl actually used the power of fire to strengthen her meridians and body.

That was how she managed to break free from his grasp.

However, in the face of an absolute power gap, this was all meaningless.

Ye Xuan tilted his body slightly and easily dodged the fire dragon. Then, he pushed Feng Xiyun away with a simple palm strike.

“Ah!”

Feng Xiyun rubbed her hands in pain as she pouted.

She had almost succeeded, but Ye Xuan had seen through her plan.

Looking at her aggrieved expression, Ye Xuan smiled and shook his head.

“Little girl, you’re quite smart. Unfortunately, you still lack actual combat experience. You only thought about how to defeat me, but you didn’t prepare any contingency plans for when your plan failed.”

“If we were in a life and death battle, that would leave you in a desperate situation!”

“The Hellfire technique is indeed powerful and can easily suppress cultivators of the same realm. However, you haven’t mastered it!”

Ye Xuan’s mouth twitched when he thought of Feng Xiyun’s Hellfire divine power.

If other cultivators knew that his two disciples were using heaven-grade divine powers, they would probably die of jealousy and anger.

“Then, Teacher, how can I improve my mastery of the Hellfire technique?”

Hearing this, Feng Xiyun hurriedly raised her head and looked straight at Ye Xuan.

“Actually, it’s not difficult. I’ll teach you a palm technique called the Sky River palm! This was created by the first few chiefs of Cloud Sky peak. The palm technique is extremely profound and contains both the gentle and unyielding nature of the ocean.”

“If you succeed in cultivating it, your strength will definitely improve by leaps and bounds.”

“In this one month, your assignment is to completely master this palm technique!”
