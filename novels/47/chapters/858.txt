859 Two Birds With One Stone?

What could make her teacher so worried?

She looked at him pensively, waiting for an explanation.

After a while, Ye Xuan finally spoke.

“Back then, although the Heaven Burning Flames technique, there were many problems with it.”

“Perhaps you didn’t notice anything wrong with it before this, but now that you’ve advanced to the mystic lord realm, it’s holding you back. If this situation continues, then cultivation will become difficult for you in the future. I have been worrying about this for a long time.”

Feng Xiyun was touched. It turned out that her teacher was worried about her cultivation and future. Tears appeared at the corner of her eyes.

“Teacher, you don’t have to worry about these things. You’ve already done so much for me. Furthermore, I don’t have any grand goals in life. Whether or not I become an immortal is irrelevant. I’m content to be able to stay by your side, Teacher.”

Feng Xiyun said these words with a sincere expression. Since becoming Ye Xuan’s disciple, she had experienced so many new things, and had experienced what it was like to have a family, even if they were not blood-related. Furthermore, Ye Xuan would always stand by their side.

All she wanted to do was to stay here with her sisters and teacher. This simple lifestyle was more than enough for her.

After hearing this, Ye Xuan’s heart trembled slightly, and he even felt that he had gone too far this time. However, this effect of his acting was still quite good.

“Sigh… Xiyun, perhaps the one thing I’ll never regret in my life is taking you three as my disciples. When I first brought you into the sect, I already said that I would protect all of you.”

“Right now, your first sister is already famous among her peers. As for your third sister, after she wakes up, she will also become incredibly powerful.”

“However, the problem with your cultivation technique worries me. I don’t want you to fall behind them and not have the chance to display your astonishing potential. Seeing this, how could I not care?”

Then, it was time to cut to the case.

“In order to solve this problem, I have studied countless ancient books and spent nearly a year perfecting this countless times. Fortunately, the effort I spent on the cultivation technique wasn’t in vain, and I successfully improved your cultivation technique!”

After hearing this, Feng Xiyun’s body trembled even more violently, and her eyes were filled with disbelief. Her teacher had actually gone so far for her!

At this moment, she could no longer control her emotions. She hugged Ye Xuan tightly as tears fell uncontrollably. It turned out that her teacher still doted on her so much and had gone to such great lengths to resolve her cultivation technique’s defects.

With a teacher like this, she had no regrets in her life. How should he repay him? After Ye Xuan said these words, Feng Xiyun could no longer care about so many things and continued to cry in Ye Xuan’s arms. In her heart, the knowledge of her teacher’s concern for her was better than anything else.

Ye Xuan rubbed Feng Xiyun’s head and said gently, “Alright, alright. You’re already a big girl, yet you still cry over such matters. Hurry up and prepare yourself. I will teach you the complete version of the Heaven Burning Flames technique now.”

“Alright.”

After Feng Xiyun calmed herself down, she obediently sat in front of Ye Xuan and adjusted her condition. At the same time, Ye Xuan said mentally, “System, complete the Heaven Burning Flames technique.”

“Ding! Congratulations! The Heaven Burning Flames technique has been successfully completed, and has advanced to the immortal-grade!” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Notification: The Heaven Burning Flames are extremely powerful, and can burn anything and everything!”

‘Oh my god… This is too damn awesome…’

It had advanced to the immortal-grade too!

Furthermore, it seemed to be really powerful as well. Perhaps he should switch cultivation techniques?

Ye Xuan was very satisfied with this. Now, he just had to see if he would earn a reward from the system.

If he did, then it would be killing two birds with one stone. Resolving Feng Xiyun’s cultivation technique problem, while hopefully also getting himself more chances to complete cultivation techniques.

It would be a huge harvest!
