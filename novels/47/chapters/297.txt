298 Fourth-Grade Alchemist And Formation Master

Of course, there was a more convenient way to improve Ye Xuan’s physical body, which was through the system.

As long as Ye Xuan helped his disciples strengthen their bodies, his would also be strengthened in turn.

However, it was not easy to do so, as he would need to strengthen their special constitutions, which required rare heavenly treasures. Furthermore, these heavenly treasures were specific to their corresponding special constitutions.

Ye Xuan himself had never seen anything that could strengthen the Demon Devouring Body.

At present, Ye Xuan only possessed heavenly treasures that could strengthen sword and fire special constitutions. In other words, he could only improve Yue’s sword jade body.

Since Li Qingyan possessed the dual-spirit body, he had to find a corresponding heavenly treasure for the wood element part of her dual-spirit body.

Alternatively, he could temper his disciples’ bodies with lightning bolts.

However, to do this, his disciples had to first comprehend heavenly lightning intent. Otherwise, the lightning bolts would do more harm than good.

Combining all these conditions, the only one who fit the criteria was Shangguan Wan’er.

Still, there was no rush. He had to settle the matter at hand first, which was to personally help his disciples become skilled in alchemy, formations and artifact refining.

In order to do that, he had to become skilled in those fields himself.

Of course, with his high comprehension value, it was not a very difficult task.

After that, Ye Xuan spent ten days reaching the second grade of artifact refining and formation mastery.

Of course, within the same grade, there were also several categories, which were expert, skilled, intermediate, and elementary.

Over the next few days, Ye Xuan first passed on the theoretical knowledge to his disciples. After they had understood most of it, he then began to teach them how to put it into practice.

However, before his disciples started refining pills, Ye Xuan taught Yue and Zhao Yuyan a cultivation technique which would allow them to obtain fire and wood elements. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

After all, it was the basic requirement for a cultivator to become an alchemist.

After that, they spent six days in the Tower of Heaven before Zhao Yuyan finally became a first-grade alchemist.

“Ding! Under the host’s guidance, the host’s disciple has successfully become a first-grade alchemist (elementary). The host has obtained a randomized 900x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has become a fourth-grade alchemist (elementary)!”

As soon as the system notification ended, a surge of information flooded his mind.

A smile appeared on Ye Xuan’s lips.

Fourth-grade alchemist!

In comparison, Yue’s comprehension value was lower, so it took her eleven days to become a first-grade alchemist.

“Ding! Under the host’s guidance, the host’s disciple has successfully become a first-grade alchemist (elementary). The host has obtained a randomized 777x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has become a fourth-grade alchemist (intermediate)!”

More alchemy knowledge surged into Ye Xuan’s mind.

Seven days later, Li Qingyan successfully became a second-grade alchemist. advanced to become a grade two Alchemist.

“Ding! Under the host’s guidance, the host’s disciple has successfully become a second-grade alchemist (elementary). The host has obtained a randomized 300x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has become a fourth-grade alchemist (expert)!”

More knowledge filled Ye Xuan’s mind.

Now, Ye Xuan was one of the best fourth-grade alchemists in the region.

In terms of talent in alchemy, thanks to her dual-spirit body, Li Qingyan had the most talent, excluding Shangguan Wan’er.

After this, Ye Xuan proceeded to repeat the process with formations.

Ten days later…

“Ding! Under the host’s guidance, the host’s disciple has successfully become a first-grade formation master (elementary). The host has obtained a randomized 666x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has become a third-grade formation master (elementary)!”

“Ding! Under the host’s guidance, the host’s disciple has successfully become a first-grade formation master (elementary). The host has obtained a randomized 789x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has become a third-grade formation master (intermediate)!”

“Ding! Under the host’s guidance, the host’s disciple has successfully become a first-grade formation master (elementary). The host has obtained a randomized 1,001x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has become a fourth-grade formation master (expert)!”

Now, he was an expert fourth-grade formation master too!
