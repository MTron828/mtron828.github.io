850 Checking On Xiang Yun

“Martial Uncle Ye, the Heaven continent’s Great Wilderness Divine sect has sent someone over. Martial Uncle Ao sent me here to invite Chief Zhuge over for a discussion.”

Now that Zhuge Yueyue had become the chief of Cloud Sky peak, she had taken over his previous responsibilities.

Hua Rufeng then continued, “This morning, an elder from the Great Wilderness Divine sect of the Heaven continent came and had a chat with Martial Uncle Ao Lei.”

“They talked about the relationship between both sects, and decided to try to bring the two sects closer. They even want to hold a competition between disciples.”

“Oh?”

After hearing this, Ye Xuan was a little stunned. Then, the corners of his mouth curled up slightly. This competition would probably be a good chance to earn some rewards from the system again.

Although it was just a small competition, both sides were testing each other’s strength. After all, they had been separated for a long time and had never interacted before. If they really took the merger route, the stronger side had to take the lead.

“Alright.”

Ye Xuan waved his hand and replied, “Got it. I’ll inform Yueyue to head to the main peak later.”

After hearing this, Hua Rufeng felt a little sheepish. After all, the elder from the Heaven continent was still waiting in the main hall. He had originally wanted to bring Zhuge Yueyue with him immediately.

However, it seemed that Martial Uncle Ye had his own ideas, so he did not say anything more and could only say dejectedly, “Alright, Martial Uncle Ye. I will return first.” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

As soon as he finished speaking, Hua Rufeng flew back to the main peak. Well, it should be fine if the chiefs of the other peaks were there. Even if Cloud Sky peak was a little late, it would be fine, right?

“Teacher, did someone come by just now?” Zhuge Yueyue came out in an apron and asked.

Ye Xuan turned around and said indifferently, “It’s nothing much. Just now, your Senior Brother Rufeng came over to ask you to attend a meeting at the main peak.”

“This…”

After learning about the meeting, Zhuge Yueyue immediately prepared herself, and was about to leave, when Ye Xuan laughed and said, “Just look at how anxious you are. You are now the chief of Cloud Sky peak. Why are you in such a hurry?”

Zhuge Yueyue’s face was a little puzzled, but stopped what she was doing.

“Teacher, don’t I need to rush over there immediately?”

Although she was now the chief, she was still young, so she subconsciously asked for Ye Xuan’s advice.

Ye Xuan smiled and rubbed her head. “Alright, alright. You can go over first, but there’s no need to be so anxious. You can make the dishes later after the meeting.”

In any case, Ye Xuan planned to go to the Cloud Sky cave to take a look at Xiang Yun’s situation, so it was fine if Yueyue attended the meeting first.

“Alright, Teacher, I’ll set off first,” Zhuge Yueyue said with a smile, and then rushed to the main peak.

After Ye Xuan watched Zhuge Yueyue leave, he turned around and saw Feng Xiyun coming out to check on Zhuge Yueyue. Honestly, life on Cloud Sky peak was quite comfortable and idyllic. However, how long could this peaceful lifestyle last?

After pondering this for a moment, Ye Xuan walked toward Cloud Sky Cave, and after unsealing it, Ye Xuan stepped inside.

Inside the cave, a tiny figure was sleeping soundly, or at least it looked that way. Ye Xuan gently approached Xiang Yun. Seeing her cute but mischievous face, he smiled.

“When you wake up, I wonder what kind of shocking things you will do…”

Ye Xuan could sense that although Xiang Yun was unconscious, her body was still cultivating on its own, slowly refining the huge amount of power within her body. Dense golden runes floated around her body.

These were slowly nourishing and transforming her body. Once this process was done, she would likely wake up, and her strength would have increased by leaps and bounds.

It might even be possible for her to reach the ancient realm or the sealed immortal realm!

At this moment, Ye Xuan could not tell what kind of cultivation technique Xiang Yun was cultivating, but he could clearly sense that it was a high-grade one. Based on his conjectures, this cultivation technique was probably related to reincarnation and rebirth.

During every reincarnation she experienced during this process, she might cultivate a different Dao and cultivation technique, allowing her to eventually perfect her Dao. Perhaps she probably cultivated more Daos than he did…
