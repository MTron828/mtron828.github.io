795 Stalling for Time

The two of them had been working together for such a long time, so Gao Shun immediately knew what Ao Lei wanted.

At this moment, everyone could already clearly sense that there would be another bloody storm.

After some time, Mengyu finally could not hold it in anymore.

“Yi Feng, you’re finally willing to show your face now. Were you shocked to see me?”

Daoist Yi Feng’s body trembled violently when he heard this.

The resentment in his heart appeared once again. Affected by this, he almost lost control of the door of reincarnation.

Fortunately, Ye Xuan was assisting him, and hurriedly shouted, “Martial Uncle Yi, don’t let her provoke you!”

Right now, the vengeful spirits inside the Soul Beckoning Banner were still surging out. There was no way to stop them. If the door of reincarnation was closed now, these vengeful spirits would probably go out of control again.

At that time, it would be very difficult to deal with, so no accidents could be allowed to happen at this critical moment.

Ye Xuan was also quite nervous at this moment. He really did not expect that Mengyu would actually appear at this time.

It was obvious that she had been paying attention to what was going on at Sky Mountain this entire time. Otherwise, why would she choose to appear now of all times? L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Daoist Yi Feng immediately reacted and mobilized his spiritual power to stabilize the door of reincarnation.

At this moment, he did not have the time to bother with Mengyu at all. Besides, Yi Feng no longer had any feelings for this person. If he did, it was only hatred.

After noticing that Daoist Yi Feng had gotten things under control, Ye Xuan turned his gaze to Mengyu. He calmly fiddled with the Godsword, smiling as he asked, “If I’m not wrong, you’re Mengyu, the Great Witch who slaughtered our sect members back then, right?”

Mengyu was somewhat stunned at this moment. She knew very well that Daoist Yi Feng still held a grudge against her.

In actuality, she previously did not know what emotions were at all. However, over the past hundred years, thanks to Daoist Yi Feng’s immortal bones, she had gradually come to understand what emotions were, and it was a terrifying force in its own right.

Mengyue was still staring straight in Yi Feng’s direction. After hearing Ye Xuan’s question, she finally turned to look at him.

She had no idea who this person was, but she could clearly sense that there was something familiar about his aura, so he asked, “Who are you?””

Hearing this, Ye Xuan smiled and briefly glanced at Daoist Yi Feng. It seemed that he had to stall for time.

“I am the chief of Cloud Sky peak and also Chief Tian Xuan’s disciple, Ye Xuan.”

“Tian Xuan’s disciple?”

Mengyu was stunned. She recalled the great battle back then, and how powerful Tian Xuan had been. Had her cultivation level not exceeded his, and without the help of the Devouring Heaven technique, she would not have been able to defeat him.

Tian Xuan was truly worthy of being called the most brilliant cultivator at that time. No one dared or could compete with him.

This young man in front of her was his disciple?

“Haha, how interesting! Back then, your teacher almost killed me.”

“I returned to the East continent this time to settle old scores with him, but I didn’t expect him to have already passed away.”

“However, you are his disciple, so you have to pay the debts he owes,” Mengyu said coldly. If Tian Xuan had not interfered, the matter of the immortal bones and her bloodline would have already been settled back then, and would not have been dragged out until today.

Because of this, she hated Tian Xuan very much. Sometimes, he would even curse Tian Xuan when she was sleep-talking.

Although Tian Xuan was no longer in this world, there was still this disciple of his who she could settle the score with.

Hearing this, Ye Xuan was stunned.

‘When I became the chief of Cloud Sky peak, no one mentioned to me that I had to repay this old debt.’

‘Damn it…’

In the blink of an eye, Mengyu released the aura of a sealed immortal realm expert, directing it toward Ye Xuan, and almost causing him to fall.

“Hahaha! Is that what the spiritual pressure of a sealed immortal realm expert feels like? Cough cough, it is indeed a little shocking.”

From this, Ye Xuan could clearly sense how terrifying this demoness was.

Although Ye Xuan only needed to take one more step to reach the sealed immortal realm himself, there was actually a huge difference between him and Mengyu.

Everyone was on tenterhooks.

Ye Xuan had just defeated the seven strange monsters by himself and then used his spiritual power to purify the vengeful spirits. Perhaps he was already exhausted.

Who could have predicted that Mengyu would take this opportunity to appear?

Everyone was very anxious at this moment. If Ye Xuan really could not hold on, then the situation here would change drastically in an instant. Millions of lives were on the line here.

However, before anyone could give voice to their worries, Ye Xuan’s aura erupted, instantly dispelling Mengyu’s spiritual pressure.

Seeing this, Mengyu frowned.

Ye Xuan said casually, “I’ve long heard that Senior Mengyu is powerful and can be considered the number one expert since ancient times.”

“As a junior, I naturally admire you greatly, and have always wanted to challenge you to a friendly fight. It seems that I finally have a chance to do so today.”

Hearing this, Mengyu’s lips curled into a smile as she stared at Ye Xuan.

Given her intelligence, how could she not understand that Ye Xuan only wanted to help Daoist Yi Feng buy more time?

However, Ye Xuan was clearly overthinking things…
