Chapter 189: Where Did Teacher Go?

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

At the same time, Ye Xuan’s tightly shut eyes slowly opened.

The red-armored man’s aura had completely disappeared. The master of the Moon Demon Holy Land was no longer in this world.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan fell silent.

He still quite admired the red-armored man.

“Forget it. It’s time to leave.”

After a moment of silence, Ye Xuan turned into a streak of light and reappeared again outside. He had already arrived at the War God Hall.

Whoosh!

When the crowd saw Ye Xuan appear, they were instantly thrown into an uproar.

Other than Ye Xuan, the other cultivators had been forcefully teleported out of the Tower of Heaven earlier. Now, a lone person had reappeared out of thin air. Anyone who was not an idiot could guess Ye Xuan’s identity.

“Ye Xuan! He’s Ye Xuan?”

“He’s so handsome! And so young!”

When the crowd saw Ye Xuan’s face, their hearts were filled with shock.

Not far away, Gongsun Yao, Jian Tiannan, and the others also redirected their gazes to Ye Xuan.

They had been curious about Ye Xuan’s appearance for a long time.

Especially Gongsun Yao, who was even more eager to know what Ye Xuan looked like. She wanted to know what this man, who had crushed the pride in her heart, looked like.

Soon, Gongsun Yao’s gaze fell on Ye Xuan.

In her field of vision, Ye Xuan’s handsome figure appeared.

There was nothing special about him, except that he was more handsome than she could imagine!

In an instant! Gongsun Yao felt her heart pound wildly.

Gongsun Wan was the same, her eyes flashing.

Whether in terms of age, strength, or looks, this guy was simply impeccable!

“Ye Xuan…”

Her originally dim and lusterless eyes were suddenly filled with light.

Ye Xuan seemed to have noticed something as well, and he then raised his head to look in the direction of Gongsun Yao.

The genius girl, who had always been incomparably arrogant and disdained everyone, was actually blushing slightly. She lowered her head very nervously, and her pair of hands gripped the corners of her clothes tightly.

Fortunately, Ye Xuan only glanced at her slightly, so Gongsun Yao was spared the embarrassment. Then, she secretly snuck glances at Ye Xuan.

Boom!

Gongsun Yao wanted to sneak a few more glances at Ye Xuan, but the space inside the War God Hall suddenly trembled. An invisible repulsive force suddenly appeared around all the cultivators.

“The mystic realm is about to close! Let’s leave quickly!”

The experienced cultivators shouted.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Soon, the cultivators turned into streaks of light and disappeared abruptly. Then, they were teleported back to the place where they had first entered the mystic realm.

At the last second before they left, Gongsun Yao took a deep look at Ye Xuan, trying to engrave his appearance in her mind.

Then, Gongsun Yao’s figure disappeared as well.

Whoosh!

When everyone left, the Tower of Heaven suddenly shrank rapidly, and then turned into a streak of bright divine light that flew into Ye Xuan’s body.

Other than Ye Xuan, there was no other person who knew that the Tower of Heaven had been taken away.

From this day on, the Moon Demon mystic realm would no longer have the opportunity provided by the Tower of Heaven.

When Ye Xuan opened his eyes again, he had already returned to the Jiangping Province, where the entrance to the arcane realm was located in the forest of demonic beasts.

At the same time, countless cultivators filled Ye Xuan’s field of vision once again.

However, compared to before the mystic realm opened, there were less people. Some people had been permanently buried in the mystic realm!

Then, Ye Xuan hovered in the air, and his spiritual sense suddenly swept out, looking for Yue and the others and the disciples of the Qingyun sect.

Seeing this, everyone tactfully restrained themselves. No one dared to fly higher than Ye Xuan.

Moreover, everyone looked at Ye Xuan with respect and admiration, as if they were looking at a god.

Before the mystic realm opened, Ye Xuan was already the undisputed strongest genius in the Great Qian Dynasty, but now he had shown himself to be the strongest genius even beyond their borders..

Everyone had witnessed the scene of Ye Xuan reaching the top of the Tower of Heaven, and he had already cemented his identity as an invincible existence in their hearts.

Not only that, the cultivators of the Great Qian dynasty were even feeling proud.

Although Ye Xuan’s achievements had nothing to do with them, they were from the same empire, so they at least had the right to brag.

“Finally found them.”

However in the air, Ye Xuan narrowed his eyes, and a divine light burst out of his pupils.

This time, there were not many disciples from the Qingyun sect who entered the mystic realm, and it seemed that their luck was not bad. They had all returned safely.

Moments later, Ye Xuan’s figure suddenly disappeared as he and the other Qingyun sect cultivators returned to Qingyun Mountain.

He still had many things to deal with.

The Yunjin Temple, the Nether God sect, and the Blood Moon Temple would definitely not let him off.

For the Blood Moon Temple, countless cultivators had witnessed him personally killing Li Tianyu at the Heavenly Lightning Pool. When he was at the entrance of the mystic realm, everyone present witnessed him killing a personal disciple and an elder of the Nether God sect.

Inside the mystic realm, he had killed two monks from the Yunjin Temple, though it might take them some time to investigate his identity.

Apart from that, Ye Xuan had another extremely important matter to deal with, which was to head to the Radiant Sky Empire and bring back that little girl, Zhao Yuyan.

…

Radiant Sky Empire, Lomo Province.

Countless cultivators were scattered throughout this vast valley. They had all been teleported back from the mystic realm.

Next to a tree, an adorable girl nervously looked at the cultivators around her. Her small hands gripped the corners of her clothes tightly, and her eyes were filled with nervousness.

“Teacher… Where did Teacher go?”

Zhao Yuyan could not help but feel lonely when she could not find Ye Xuan in the crowd. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

In the War God Hall, although she was not with her teacher, at least Senior Sister Yue was by her side.

When she saw her teacher reach the top of the Tower of Heaven, she excitedly cheered for her teacher together with Senior Sister Yue.

Especially when she saw countless cultivators looking at Ye Xuan with admiration, she felt an inexplicable sense of pride in her heart.
