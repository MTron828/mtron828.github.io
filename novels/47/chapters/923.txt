As time passed, Ye Xuan took a deep breath. Looking at the huge figure in the sky, he was very shocked.

Had it been another expert facing this Thunder-Devouring Beast, they might have already cowered before the battle and fled.

“This beast’s aura is simply too terrifying. Thankfully, the most powerful weapon it wields is its divine lightning, which means that I have a chance,” he muttered to himself.

This filled him with excitement and anticipation, so naturally, his mouth curled into a smile, and his expression became much brighter.

When it saw Ye Xuan’s smiling face, the Thunder-Devouring Beast was flustered.

“Damn it! Why is this kid smiling? What’s so funny?”

“Could it be that he has already thought of a plan to deal with me?”

Despite thinking this, the Thunder-Devouring Beast still maintained its calm appearance.

Others might think that it was very strong, but only he knew that it really was not all that strong. It had been sleeping in this ancient palace for countless years, and did not really cultivate.

Its strength was completely reliant on its innate abilities and talent that it had when it was born. Over the course of its lifespan, quite a number of people had tried to snatch the immortal heavenly treasure.

When it first encountered them, it was quite flustered. However, every single one had fled without fighting after it revealed its aura and awe-inspiring appearance.

None of them had the courage to actually try attacking it. It was precisely because of this that it had spent a lot of effort on its aura and appearance, but not any divine powers or abilities that would enhance its combat prowess.

Therefore, seeing Ye Xuan unperturbed by his aura, the Thunder-Devouring Beast was becoming really nervous.

‘Oh no, oh no! He’s getting closer to me.’

‘What should I do? Seriously, why is this guy so bold? How could he not be scared by now?’

The Thunder-Devouring Beast was extremely flustered. In fact, its physical strength was quite decent. However, because it had never left the ancient palace, and had never fought anyone, it was very timid.

Seeing Ye Xuan approach, it really did not know what to do at this moment. All it could do was trust its instincts and maintain its domineering appearance.

‘Ahhh! He’s still coming closer!’

Left with no choice, it let out a mighty roar, causing the sky to tremble, and thunderclouds to gather.

Seeing this scene, the people at the scene were so scared that their faces turned pale. They wished they could run away.

“Heavens! Just its roar is already so powerful. In that case, how powerful is this beast?”

“Damn it! How can Ye Xuan still be so brazen? If he angers this beast, the rest of us might end up being implicated!”

At this moment, everyone was very dissatisfied with Ye Xuan. They did not want to be dragged down with him. However, they did not dare to express their thoughts, so they simply gritted their teeth and endured it.

In the sky, Ye Xuan was also quite flustered at this moment. After taking a deep breath, he muttered, “What a terrifying aura. This fellow must be crazy powerful. It seems like I’m in for a tough fight.”

He could not afford to be careless. A single wrong move, and his life might be over. Honestly, he was even thinking of giving up at this moment. After all, there were plenty of other treasures in the ancient palace. There was no need to be so fixated on this one.

He glanced at the huge Thunder-Devouring Beast in front of him, and heard a little voice inside him ask, “Why don’t we just let it go this time?”

After this thought flashed through his mind, Ye Xuan quickly rejected it.

“I absolutely can’t. If I retreat now, I’ll become a laughingstock, and I’ll embarrass Yanran.”

However, it did not change the fact that he had to face this scary Thunder-Devouring Beast.

Damn it!

Ye Xuan was in a dilemma at this moment, not knowing what to do.

At this moment, both of them locked gazes, and neither side moved. Their auras continued to collide.

In fact, the two of them were extremely flustered. It was just that they were pretending to look calm on the outside. The two of them could be placed in the running for the award for best actor. There were no flaws in their performance.

The atmosphere between the two had the onlookers on the edge of their seats, and everyone was holding their breaths.

Seeing that the two of them still did not move, an old man with white hair said, “These two are not showing any signs of weakness at all. Truly remarkable. The moment one of them reveals a flaw, the other will take advantage of it.”

Hearing what was said, everyone felt that this was the truth, and they were all extremely flustered, and waited for the spark that would ignite a furious battle with bated breaths.
