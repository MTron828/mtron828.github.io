Feng Xiyun’s eyes lit up when she heard this. She hurriedly walked over.

“Thank you, Teacher. I will definitely cultivate diligently and will not let you down!”

Ye Xuan then taught the Sky River palm technique to Feng Xiyun.

Feng Xiyun’s comprehension ability was quite high. In just half an hour, she had already grasped the essence of the Sky River palm technique.

!!

After doing all this, a smile appeared on Ye Xuan’s face.

By now, he had basically accomplished everything that he wanted to teach his disciples for the time being. Zhuge Yueyue cultivated sword techniques, while Feng Xiyun cultivated palm techniques. Their attributes were ice and fire respectively. Moreover, the grade of their divine bones was rather high, reaching the seventh-level.

As for how much these two girls could grow in the future, it would depend on their own efforts and comprehension ability.

“Senior Sister, why don’t we spar?”

Feng Xiyun issued Zhuge Yueyue a challenge right after she had mastered the Sky River palm technique. She did not want to fight Ye Xuan again, as that would just be asking for a beating.

Although Zhuge Yueyue’s cultivation level was higher than hers, if Zhuge Yueyue suppressed her own cultivation level, the difference in strength between them would not be too large, with the only major difference being that Zhuge Yueyue had been practicing the Cloud Sky sword technique for a longer time, and that her combat experience was richer than Feng Xiyun’s.

Hearing her junior sister’s request, Zhuge Yueyue smiled and agreed.

When Ye Xuan saw this scene, his mouth twitched.

Were they giving him the cold shoulder?

Then again, when he thought about it more, it made sense for his two disciples to train together.

At this moment, a system notification suddenly rang out in Ye Xuan’s mind.

“Ding! As the host has taught the Sky River palm technique to his disciple, the host has received a randomized 10,000x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the divine power, the Boundless Palm technique!”

F*ck!

Ye Xuan almost jumped up in excitement.

This f*cking high reward multiplier was indeed a blessing!

While his two disciples were training, Ye Xuan also began to study the Boundless Palm technique.

Five days quickly flew by.

That morning, Ye Xuan was cultivating in his room, slowly comprehending the mysteries of the Boundless Palm technique.

“Hey, be careful! Put the stuff down properly! Don’t break them!”

Suddenly, there was a commotion on Cloud Sky peak.

Hearing this, Ye Xuan’s eyes opened slightly, and then he walked out of the room.

He saw a group of muscular men carrying boxes and carefully placing them in the courtyard.

“Who are you?”

Ye Xuan’s eyes were filled with confusion. Then, he saw Su Changhe behind the men.

“Chief Ye Xuan, we will meet again!”

Su Changhe ran over with a fawning expression on his face.

Beside Su Changhe was Hua Rufeng. It was obvious that the latter was the one who had brought them up the peak.

“Rufeng greets Martial Uncle Ye. This is Young Master Su from the So family of Qingyang City. Today, Young Master Su brought many servants to visit our Great Wilderness Divine sect. He said that he was acquainted with Martial Uncle Ye and is here to give you some treasures. Thus, Teacher told me to bring them here.”

“En!” Ye Xuan nodded, then his gaze fell on Su Changhe.

“As the saying goes, one doesn’t visit without a reason. What do you want?”

“Don’t misunderstand, Chief Ye Xuan. It was my father’s idea for me to come here and visit you. My father noticed that Cloud Sky peak was a little empty, so he wanted to give you some treasures to spruce things up.”

“This is also our Su family’s way of repaying Senior’s kindness. We hope Senior will accept it,” Su Changhe said with a smile.

“Treasures?” Hearing this, Ye Xuan raised his brows. Then, he walked over to the big boxes and opened them.

The next second, golden light flashed across Ye Xuan’s field of vision, almost blinding his eyes. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

‘An entire box of profound gold!’

Ye Xuan could not help but open his mouth.

(Profound gold is a currency refined from a special mineral in the mystic world.)

Ever since he had come to the mystic world, he had never seen such a large amount of profound gold in the past hundred years.

He was truly a member of the nouveau riche now. It seemed that the rest of these boxes also contained profound gold.

It was no wonder the other chiefs liked to go to the outside world to maintain good relations with the major families of the Yangli divine empire. It seemed that there was quite a lot of profit to be made.

Ye Xuan suddenly felt a little uneasy.

When he was on the Tianyuan continent, he was also a man of great wealth. Mere spiritual stones were worthless to him.

However, he was now in the mystic world. In the past 100 years, he had been guarding the poor Cloud Sky peak and had to rely on the relief of the great wilderness divine sect to survive.

In addition, Ye Xuan had not awakened any divine bones, so he had been unable to obtain any profound gold back then.

Furthermore, although the system was awesome, it did not supply him with money. Since Cloud Sky peak now had two more disciples, he had been worrying about how to cover their living and cultivation expenses.

Su Tiansheng was indeed a sharp person, and sent these boxes of profound gold to alleviate his need for money.

‘Very good! It seems that having more friends is a way to go!’

Ye Xuan was ecstatic internally, but deadpan externally.

Ye Xuan looked at Su Changhe and said slowly, “Young Master Su and Master Su are indeed thoughtful, but as cultivators, we don’t have much interest in these secular things.”

“Of course, this is a token of your Su family’s goodwill, so I will reluctantly accept it.”

Hearing this, Hua Rufeng’s mouth twitched.

As expected, the older the ginger, the spicier it was. Chief Ye Xuan was clearly very interested in it, but he was still able to put on a facade.

The others might not know, but he was well aware of Cloud Sky peak’s heritage.

Ever since Chief Tian Xuan passed away, the only properties left on Cloud Sky peak were those few wooden houses, yet this f*cking guy could still act so calm in the face of ten thousand taels of profound gold, which was amazing in its own right.
