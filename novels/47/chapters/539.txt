540 Couple System

After seriously thinking about what Ye Xuan said, Yanran had a general idea about what he meant.

Ye Xuan meant that they could get along better than friends during this period, but they could not do what a real couple could do.

Looking at Ye Xuan’s handsome face and his tender gaze, Yanran admitted that she was indeed interested in such an arrangement and subconsciously agreed.

“Alright…”

In any case, there was no harm in giving it a go first. If things did not work out later, she would not lose out. Furthermore, her pounding heart seemed to indicate that she did have some feelings for him.

Hearing Yanran agree, Ye Xuan was also very happy.

He actually gained a girlfriend so easily?

Although he was very happy, Ye Xuan did not dare to overstep his boundaries and do something that was out of line.

After all, their relationship was only temporary, and they would be separated after they left the ancient tomb.

Ye Xuan took out the Torrential Pear Blossom needles without hesitation and handed them to Yanran.

“Here, Junior Sister, just accept these as my token of affection. If you don’t accept them, I won’t be happy.”

Looking at the needles that Ye Xuan handed over, Yanran’s heart trembled.

She finally knew why Ye Xuan confirmed their relationship first. He actually wanted to give her these needles in another way.

At the thought of this, her heart was even more touched. This boyfriend of hers was quite likable.

He was afraid that she would not accept them, so he actually decided to use the relationship as the pretext instead, so that she could accept the needles with peace of mind.

Unknowingly, the way Yanran looked at Ye Xuan had changed, and her cold expression had been replaced by joy.

“Is this the feeling of love that the teacher was talking about? It’s so warm and makes me happy.”

Yanran thought about it happily. After all, this was her first time in a relationship.

At this moment, she seemed to be full of anticipation for the days to come, and she inadvertently smiled, which left Ye Xuan a little stunned and giddy.

After receiving the needles from Ye Xuan, she had to show some form of appreciation, so she took out a pendant and placed it in Ye Xuan’s hand.

“I’m poor, so I don’t have anything good to give you. This pendant is made from Great Desolation Jade. Take it as a token of affection from me.”

“Even though it’s not a rare treasure, it’s still very precious. Wearing it can make your mood even better, and your cultivation will also be smoother.”

She looked at Ye Xuan affectionately. This pendant could be considered her most precious treasure, and she usually carried it with her.

Although it was far inferior to the Torrential Pear Blossom needles, it reflected her feelings for Ye Xuan.

Her teacher had told her a long time ago that if a couple gave each other small gifts from time to time, their relationship would quickly become stronger.

After Ye Xuan accepted the pendant, he looked at it carefully, and then hung it on his belt.

“Haha, I’m very satisfied with this pendant.”

Ye Xuan looked at Yanran happily. Then, he walked around in front of the onlookers, as if telling them that he had a girlfriend.

After learning that Ye Xuan was very satisfied, Yanran was also very happy, and a brilliant smile adorned her face. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Ding! Congratulations on awakening the couple system and successfully binding yourself to your other half, Yanran. After officially confirming your relationship, you can get lottery draw chances. There are many amazing treasures to be found!”

This system notification completely stunned Ye Xuan.

“Couple system, what is this thing?”

Ye Xuan did not expect that his actions would awaken a couple system.

What could this newly-awakened couple system bring him?

The lottery was not the only thing, right?

While Ye Xuan pondered this matter, the next system notification gave him the answer.

“The couple system is another system apart from the master and disciple system. As long as you officially confirm your relationship and give the other half a gift, you can also get a 10,000x critical reward, or even a 1,000,000x critical reward!”

“Heavens! A 1,000,000x critical reward?”

Even Ye Xuan, who had seen many things, could not help but take a few deep breaths when he saw this. What kind of reward would he receive from a 1,000,000x critical reward? Would it allow him to immediately reach the sealed immortal realm?

At this moment, Ye Xuan was inwardly jumping with joy as if he had won the lottery.

This time, he had really hit the jackpot!

Amazing, amazing!

Thinking this, Ye Xuan was excited to win Yanran over as soon as possible. This system was a great source of motivation.

After carefully fiddling with the needles, Yanran solemnly put them away. With these, she would be able to display much more of her strength in combat.
