336 Ye Xuan, Invincible?

The abyssal python’s body was nearly 3,000 meters long, and its mountain-like eyes were full of fear.

Annihilation and destruction intents had some similarities, in the sense that both could destroy the soul of a cultivator.

The giant abyssal python immediately released its mighty aura and was about to escape.

“Hmph! Do you think you can run away?”

Seeing this, Jun Lingtian’s lips curled into a cold smile.

Moments later, Jun Lingtian rose into the air, and his body erupted with dazzling golden divine light that engulfed the abyssal python, which destroyed its body and soul.

He had killed it in seconds!

“Don’t tell me that this is not your limit,” Zhao Yuzhen muttered.

He had never seen Jun Lingtian display such a powerful martial technique.

“I’m not a monster like Ye Xuan. I don’t have as many secrets.”

Jun Lingtian chuckled.

“You’re right! That guy is too freakish.”

Zhao Yuzhen agreed with Jun Lingtian.

That person could not be judged with common sense.

No matter what one speculated his strength to be, he would always exceed those expectations, and by a country mile too!

Still, speculating was everyone’s favorite pastime.

“What do you think that fellow’s current strength is?”

Jun Lingtian could not contain his curiosity, so he asked Zhao Yuzhen.

“Perhaps the Saint King realm? Or maybe the great emperor realm?”

Zhao Yuzhen replied after some thought.

Be it the Saint King realm or the legendary great emperor realm, both were miles away from him.

Zhao Yu knew very well that with his level of talent, he would only be able to reach the Human King realm in his lifetime.

In his opinion, Ye Xuan’s strength having reached the Saint King realm was already extremely shocking. The Saint King realm was the pinnacle of the King realm, and only the legendary great emperor realm experts were stronger.

“You’re being too conservative. I think that Ye Xuan is already an invincible existence on the Tianyuan continent!”

Jun Lingtian’s eyes flickered with a strange light.

“Invincible?” Zhao Yuzhen was stunned.

Could it be that Ye Xuan’s strength had surpassed the great emperor realm?

Impossible! That was outrageous!

Zhao Yuzhen’s heart was filled with disbelief.

If Ye Xuan was really invincible, would he not be able to destroy the entire sea race by himself? If that was the case, why did he disappear after killing a few sea race King realm experts?

“Although that guy’s talent is indeed monstrous, and his strength can’t be judged by common sense, there’s no way he reached such an outrageous level, right?”

Zhao Yuzhen rebutted.

“You’re still so serious. I already said that all of this was speculation!”

“And you said it yourself. This guy can’t be judged by common sense. Maybe my guess is someone right,” Jun Lingtian said with a smile.

“In any case, let’s go! The sea race is attacking so ferociously, I’m afraid we’ll lose the Tianwu Zone.”

Then, the two of them headed toward another battlefield with the sea race.

The sea race army was humongous, and there were many who had reached the pattern condensation realm.

Even if powerful cultivators from the other zones came to help, it would be difficult to reverse the situation in the Tianwu Zone.

“Looking at how things are going in the Huangyu Zone, it seems that the sea race will soon reach the Nanzhou Region.”

“If the Nanzhou Region is in danger, will that guy appear?”

Zhao Yuzhen could not help but ask when he thought about the serious war situation between the two races.

“I’m not sure.”

Jun Lingtian shook his head.

If the Qingyun sect was still in the Nanzhou Region, then the answer would have been obvious. However, Ye Xuan had taken the Qingyun sect with him, so no one knew if he would appear.

The sea race invasion intensified, and the number of King realm experts increased.

Furthermore, the sea race dispatched many Heavenly King realm experts to guard against the possibility of Ye Xuan suddenly appearing.

“There’s one possibility that would make Ye Xuan appear.”

“When the Gongsun family is in danger, they will probably ask Ye Xuan for help,” Jun Lingtian said.

“When the Gongsun family helped Ye Xuan find the great elder of the Nether God sect, Ye Xuan promised them a favor!”

Zhao Yuzhen nodded.

However, he was not sure if the Gongsun family would use this favor. The fall of the Nanzhou Region was set in stone. Only Ye Xuan could change this situation.

Very quickly, the two of them arrived at the new battlefield, where countless people were fighting.

Martial techniques were being hurled left and right, and the stench of blood filled the air. Spatial cracks were everywhere.

This was a battle between the human race’s pattern condensation realm experts and the sea race’s. Jun Lingtian and Zhao Yuzhen hurriedly joined in. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

While the battle between the two sides was in full swing, the Destiny Divine Tower was filled with surging, terrifying sword intent.

Shangguan Wan’er hovered in the air, exuding a terrifying sword qi. She was like a heaven-splitting divine sword that soared into the sky, as if she was going to tear the whole world apart.

Ninth-level sword intent! The perfect level!

Under Ye Xuan’s guidance, Shangguan Wan’er finally achieved perfect-level sword intent.

Then, when Shangguan Wan’er’s sword intent reached the perfect level, a sudden change happened to her body.
