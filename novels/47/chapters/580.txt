581 Bidding War (Part 2)

He gritted his teeth and raised the bid again.

“1.4 billion taels!”

At this moment, all of the other guests’ jaws dropped.

He had actually raised the bid again?!

This price was enough to buy a pile of high-grade magic treasures. Was there something wrong with his brain?

Feng Lu knew that the price was inappropriate, but he was a prideful man.

After making the bid, Feng Lu looked at Ye Xuan arrogantly. It was obvious that he wanted Ye Xuan to outbid him.

‘If you have the ability, then come at me!’

He had already decided that if Ye Xuan continued to raise the price, he would decisively give up. He would make Ye Xuan suffer!

Unexpectedly, the corners of Ye Xuan’s mouth curved up slightly, and he sat down again, clearly not intending to raise the bid again.

‘What the f*ck?’

Feng Lu was dumbfounded when he saw this.

Was he really not going to bid again?

“1.4 billion taels going once… going twice…”

After calling out three times, the woman announced, “Congratulations to the guest in Suite 002 for winning the bid for this high-grade magical treasure for 1.4 billion taels of profound silver!”

When the gavel fell, it was over. This was the rule and Feng Lu understood it very well. At this moment, a sense of regret washed over him. He had played with fire and gotten himself burned.

However, this was only a small amount of money for him. As long as his pride was intact, it was worth the money.

In Suite 001, Zhuge Yueyue looked at the first auction item with a face full of curiosity. She then turned to Ye Xuan and asked, “Teacher, weren’t you the one who brought that item for auction? Why did you bid for it?”

Was her teacher playing around?

Ye Xuan pretended to be momentarily stunned for a moment and asked, “”Ah? Was it really mine?”

Zhuge Yueyue was really quite innocent and naive. She nodded and said, “”That’s right! It was among the treasures that you were sorting out in front of us earlier.”

Ye Xuan laughed and said, “Hahaha! I must’ve forgotten. Fortunately, I didn’t continue bidding. Otherwise, I would have lost a lot of money.”

Looking at Ye Xuan’s smiling face, anyone would be able to figure out that he was simply messing with the bid.

After some time, Zhuge Yueyue also figured it out. She covered her mouth and chuckled.

Feng Xiyun then chimed in while rolling her eyes, “Teacher, aren’t you being too mean to Prince Zhanglu?”

She had been shocked by his initial bid, and wondered when her teacher had become so rich.

Ye Xuan picked up the teacup calmly and drank it happily.

“This prince is so kind. He’s donating so much money to me in the name of pride. How funny! Let’s see how far I can take this.’

“Next up is the second auction item!”

After hearing the auction hostess’ voice, Ye Xuan immediately suppressed the smile on his face and even pretended to be very angry about what had just happened. He even glared at Feng Lu.

After seeing this, Feng Lu instantly felt refreshed.

It was money well-spent!

Hehe!

Did this kid want to play with him? He would show him who was the real boss around here.

It was just money, and he had plenty of it.

Feng Lu was delighted, and drank a cup of tea. He felt that even the tea tasted refreshing now. How comfortable!

He pulled the maidservant beside him to sit on his lap. The smile on his face was very wretched.

When the second auction item was revealed, the guests once again widened their eyes.

It was actually a low-grade spiritual artifact!

After sensing the surging power from the auction item, their eyes were glued to it.

Every spiritual artifact was extremely precious, and would almost never show up in the secular world. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

An ordinary major family would at most have two or three, but under normal circumstances, none of them would part with any.

At this moment, the guests were deeply astonished. To them, this spiritual artifact could already be considered a priceless treasure!

Ordinary magical artifacts were already extremely precious to them, let alone spiritual artifacts.

After seeing the purgatory whip on display, the crowd began to rub their hands in anticipation.

It was the same for Feng Lu. His eyes were already glowing.

“This spiritual artifact is called the purgatory whip. It’s a low-grade spiritual weapon,” the auction hostess continued.

“I won’t explain how powerful it is, as everyone can probably tell from its aura.”

“Let’s start the bidding now! The starting price is 1 million taels of profound silver!”

As soon as she finished speaking, Ye Xuan made a bid.

“1 billion taels!”

Hearing this, the crowd on the auction floor were once again dumbfounded.

“Oh my god, he’s actually playing this trick again?”

“Is he doing this because he failed in his first bid just now?”

...

People could not help but start to make guesses. However, this person’s participation also meant that they had to give up on this item.

As such, they decided to sit back and enjoy the show. They were certain that the guests in Suite 002 would not let this opportunity pass by.

Feng Lu smiled.

‘Haha, I’m going to make you prostrate yourself in awe today!’

“1.4 billion taels!”

“Hmph, so you’re out of money? Why is it only 1.4 billion?”

Ye Xuan looked at Feng Lu sarcastically and immediately raised the bid again.

“1.9 billion taels!”

“Hu…”

The other guests had already begun to take deep breaths to calm their excitement.

“Heavens! This is the first time I’ve seen someone pay such a high price for something. If it were me, I’d probably have to spend a few lifetimes to finish spending that amount.”

...

At this moment, the atmosphere was boiling over again.

This 1.9 billion taels of profound silver, if converted to profound gold, was 19 million taels of profound gold!
