492 Last Chance

In the north of the archaic divine mountains, Elder Taiyin and the disciples of the Immortal Divine sect gathered together.

Elder Taiyin’s gaze fell on the battle in the distance and frowned.

“How long has this battle been going on?”

“Senior Brother, it has been going on for an entire night!”

!!

“First, the Pixiu appeared, and then the heaven devouring divine sparrow. Now, there’s even a Zhuyan!”

“The situation is extremely urgent!”

Su Changkong quickly explained the situation.

Hearing this, Elder Taiyin squinted his eyes.

“What kind of treasure can cause three powerful ancient beast descendants to fight over it?”

Su Changkong looked at Elder Taiyin in front of him, and his heart was filled with shock. He had sent a request for assistance back to the sect earlier, but had not expected Elder Taiyin to be the one dispatched here.

They had no idea that Elder Taiyin’s target was the huge coffin on the back of the black tortoise.

Of course, no one knew that Elder Taiyin had a secret.

He was about to reach the end of his life. If he could not obtain this heavenly treasure and break through, he would die of old age just like Tian Xuan.

Elder Taiyin had spent 100 years in closed-door cultivation, but had yet to break through to the supreme realm. As such, he was overjoyed when he heard news about this heavenly treasure.

Furthermore, in Su Changkong’s report, it had been stated that the treasure was overflowing with endless life force.

As long as he managed to obtain the life force, he would definitely be able to break through and become a supreme realm expert.

Normally, according to the number of years Elder Taiyin had been cultivating, his lifespan would not be exhausted so quickly.

However, in order to break through quickly, Elder Taiyin had chosen to take the unconventional route and practiced many forbidden techniques, which had led to the exhaustion of his life force.

Due to this, from the outside, Elder Taiyin looked even older than Gongsun Shouyue and the others.

All in all, he did not have much time left. This heavenly treasure was his last chance.

“Listen up, no matter what price we have to pay, we must get this treasure!”

“As long as this treasure falls into my hands, I’ll satisfy any request you have,” Elder Taiyin said with a serious expression.

At this moment, Li Siyuan’s eyes brightened. After some thought, he stepped forward.

“Senior Brother, do you remember the chief of the Cloud Sky peak from the Great Wilderness Divine sect that I told you about?”

“What?” Hearing this, Elder Taiyin frowned.

Compared to other cultivators, he was more sensitive to the name ‘Cloud Sky peak’.

“What do you want to do? I’ve warned you before not to provoke the people of Cloud Sky peak!”

“Now that the Great Wilderness Divine sect is rising up, it’s not the right time for the two holy lands to fall out!”

“Even if you really want to fight them, you have to wait until that old man Gongsun Shouyue dies!”

Elder Taiyin reprimanded him rudely.

He did not want to be troubled by Cloud Sky peak at this critical moment.

If he could not obtain the treasure, he would definitely die soon, and with his passing, the Immortal Divine sect would surely decline.

Hearing this, Li Siyuan felt fearful, and hurriedly explained.

“Ah… Senior Brother, you’ve misunderstood. I didn’t mean it that way!”

“I just want to remind you that the chief of Cloud Sky peak, Ye Xuan, is also present here.”

“What?” Hearing this, Elder Taiyin furrowed his brows even more.

Then, as if he had thought of something, the corners of his mouth curled up.

‘I didn’t expect someone from Cloud Sky peak to be here!’

Elder Taiyin, who did not want to talk about Cloud Sky peak initially, was suddenly interested.

He was indeed afraid of Chief Tian Xuan and Gongsun Shouyue of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, but that did not mean he was afraid of Ye Xuan.

When he thought about how Chief Tian Xuan had humiliated him back then, he became even more furious.

Since Chief Tian Xuan’s disciple was here as well, was this not a chance for him to take revenge?

He had naturally heard of how Te Xuan had heavily injured Li Siyuan with one strike, but he had not been bothered by this.

After all, at his current level of cultivation, a casual slap was enough to kill a useless person like Li Siyuan. The latter’s strength was not even worth mentioning.

Although Ye Xuan’s strength was quite good in comparison, the other party was only a hundred years old, so how strong could he be?

Su Changkong’s expression changed when he heard this. He had an ominous feeling and quickly said, “Senior Brother Taiyin, Ye Xuan is indeed here in the outskirts of the archaic divine mountains, and he appeared last night!”

“However, he also destroyed half of the heaven devouring divine sparrow’s body with his destructive sword strike. His strength has undergone a huge change!”

“What?”

Hearing this, Elder Taiyin’s expression changed.

He was aware of how strong the heaven devouring divine sparrow was. It was a terrifying existence that had reached the supreme realm. Was the disciple of Chief Tian Xuan that awesome?

Could it be that this fellow had already reached the supreme realm?

That was simply impossible!

Ye Xuan had only been cultivating for a hundred years!

“That guy was just lucky with his sneak attack. Don’t give Senior Brother Tianyin the wrong idea.”

...

“At that time, the heaven devouring divine sparrow was distracted by the Pixiu. That’s why Ye Xuan’s sneak attack was successful,” Li Siyuan said disdainfully from the side.

Hearing this, Elder Taiyin squinted his eyes.

“I see. I was wondering how this guy managed to achieve such terrifying strength in less than a hundred years.” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Even so, the heaven devouring divine sparrow is a genuine supreme realm existence. It seems that Ye Xuan is not simple!”

Thinking this, Elder Taiyin became even more curious.

The new chief of Cloud Sky peak had become a legend since he entered the eyes of the public, but was he really that powerful?

“Forget it! Let’s go meet Ye Xuan!”

“If he’s really powerful, then we’ll just let this matter go! If he doesn’t live up to his fame, then it’s time to settle the score!”
