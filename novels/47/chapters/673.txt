674 Master, I Don’t Want To Stay Here Anymore

Not long after that, Li Hong appeared at the entrance, looking rather miserable.

After struggling to stand up, he spat out a few mouthfuls of blood again. His face was pale and weak.

It was obvious that being hit by Xiang Yun’s hammer had gravely injured him.

“Sorry, Master, I didn’t manage to fulfill your expectations,” Li Hong lowered his head and said. He really did not know how to face his master.

!!

At this moment, Daoist Gu Hao’s face was so gloomy that it would fit right in a haunted house.

“Useless! All of you are useless!”

It seemed that smoke was about to come out of his ears. The trump card he had painstakingly prepared had been defeated by a six-year-old girl.

“Hehehe…”

Gao Shun was quick on the uptake.

“Oh, just look at him. He did so well! He took three hammer strikes from Xiang Yun. That’s a new record, you know.”

Then, he turned around to speak to his disciples.

“You all saw how strong he was, right? He was a cut above the other disciples of the Supreme Divine sect. Truly worthy of being someone nurtured by Daoist Gu Hao!”

After hearing this, Daoist Gu Hao spat out a mouthful of blood.

It was simply infuriating. He had dispatched almost all of the disciples of the Supreme Divine sect, other than Xie Tianyu, to deal with Ye Xuan’s two disciples, but they had all been defeated, including his personal disciple!

How shameful!

“Gao Shun, don’t push your luck!”

Daoist Black Iron stared fiercely at Gao Shun. However, Gao Shun paid him no mind and replied disdainfully, “Why not? Wanna fight?”

After hearing this, Daoist Black Iron instantly backed down. His master had lost to Ye Xuan, and the sect’s disciples had been defeated by Xiang Yun. If he lost too, it would complete the treble and the Supreme Divine sect’s reputation would be thrown further down the gutter.

“Hmph! Don’t get too arrogant! We haven’t lost yet! It’s still too early to determine the final victor!”

It was then that Gao Shun recalled that Xie Tianyu had not been eliminated yet.

At this moment, the rankings were refreshed, and everyone could see that Xie Tianyu was already ranked 11th.

“He’s already ranked 11th?”

Gao Shun was momentarily stunned. When he scanned the rankings for the Great Wilderness Divine sect’s disciples, he discovered that the highest ranking one was Hua Rufeng at 18th.

Zhuge Yueyue’s name was not on the rankings yet, so he was unsure as to how she was faring. Turning around to look at Ye Xuan, he noticed that the latter remained calm and composed.

“Hehe, just watch carefully,” Daoist Black Iron said with a mocking expression.

“If that little girl wasn’t the reincarnation of a mighty figure, those two disciples would have been eliminated.”

“Besides, who knows if that girl lying on the ground there will be able to continue. She hasn’t woken up after so long.”

As he spoke, Daoist Black Iron’s gaze was focused on Feng Xiyun, who was still pretending to be injured and unconscious.

After hearing these words, Gao Shun remained unbothered. The current situation was fine. The more these two harbored hopes for Xie Tianyu, the harder they would fall later.

He would be able to enjoy himself much more then. Thinking this, Gao Shun happily rejoined the Great Wilderness Divine sect’s camp.

At this moment, a few more streaks of light flashed, signifying the end of those participants’ journey at the gathering. Among these figures, the one in the most dire straits was undoubtedly Yun Hai.

As a peak-level void realm expert, he had been eliminated before he could even step foot on the mountain.

It was too tragic…

Fortunately, he was not alone, and countless disciples of the Supreme Divine sect had experienced the same fate, including another peak-level void realm expert, Li Hong. Looking at them, Yun Hai felt much better.

“Yun Hai, what happened?”

After seeing Yun Hai’s despondent figure, the Ice Temple’s cultivators became worried. They knew his strength well, and had not expected him to be eliminated so early.

“Master, I don’t want to stay here anymore. Can we go back to the Ice Temple?”

Hearing this, Yun Hai’s master’s face darkened.

What kind of heavy blow did his disciple suffer to be able to say these words?

Then again, it made sense. Being beaten to a pulp by a six-year-old girl would do that to anyone. Even an ordinary person might not be able to accept this, let alone a genius like him.F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com
