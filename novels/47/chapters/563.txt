564 Domineering Ao Lei

Everyone felt a sense of lingering fear at how the Great Wilderness Divine sect dealt with things. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Mo Gen also understood that today’s matter was truly unsalvageable. In that case, he could only fight to the death.

“Yi Feng, I’m afraid today’s matter can’t be settled peacefully anymore. Bring it on! Let me see how much you’ve improved after so many years!”

The two of them had never liked each other since they were young anyway, and they still hated each other’s guts now.

!!

However, Mo Gen had already been injured by Ye Xuan. There was no way that he could defeat Yi Feng now.

The two of them started quickly and ended quickly as well. Mo Gen lost.

Across the battlefield, the Great Wilderness Divine sect emerged victorious. All of the Immortal Divine sect cultivators had been killed, and not a single one was left.

There was no room for mercy in a battle like this. It was kill or be killed.

After dealing with the enemies here, Ao Lei immediately issued another order, “Those who can move, follow me. Those who can’t move, stay here and recover.”

Upon hearing that, Li Dahai asked in confusion, “Senior Brother Ao, what are we going to do?”

“We’re joining the others to uproot the Immortal Divine sect,” Ao Lei said coldly as he looked in the direction of the Immortal Divine sect’s headquarters.

At this moment, the chiefs of the Great Wilderness Divine sect felt their blood boil. Although hundreds of years had passed, Ao Lei’s temper had not changed at all.

After all, he was once a ruthless person who had once challenged an entire sect by himself. No one could stop him.

Even when the sect master came out to plead for mercy, he still did not relent.

The reason why he was so tyrannical back then was because of the existence of Chief Tian Xuan. As long as Ao Lei was hurt, Tian Xuan would probably kill the perpetrator without any hesitation.

At this moment, Ye Xuan could not help but laugh. This normally gentle and elegant senior brother actually had this side to him.

Even though he had long heard of the legends regarding Ao Lei, this was the first time he was seeing it with his own eyes.

Au Lei pointed his weapon in the direction of the Immortal Divine sect in a domineering manner. Then, he led a large group of the sect’s cultivators and flew in that direction.

At this moment, the surrounding onlookers had already understood that the Immortal Divine sect was really finished this time.

They had traded the death of Chief Gao Shun for the destruction of their sect.

Ye Xuan did not follow them. Instead, he flew over to Gao Shun.

In this battle between the two sects, many of the Great Wilderness Divine sect’s disciples had also fallen. However, compared to the destruction of the Immortal Divine sect, their losses were not worth mentioning, save one, which was the fact that Gao Shun was killed by Elder Taiyin.

At this moment, the remaining cultivators from the Great Wilderness Divine sect all surrounded Gao Shun’s corpse silently and respectfully.

An atmosphere of sorrow filled the air, and some of the disciples could not help but shed tears on the spot.

Zhuge Yueyue came over to Ye Xuan and asked him with a tinge of hope.

“Teacher, can Martial Uncle Gao be saved?”

At this moment, Zhuge Yueyue’s heart was also very heavy. After all, she knew very well that Gao shun was killed because he was trying to save the sect’s disciples.

How could she repay the favor of having saved her life?

Cultivators never liked to owe others, because this was a matter that involved karma. If they were not careful, it was very likely that it would affect their cultivation and future.

Ye Xuan did not say anything at this time. He turned around and looked at his two disciples.

What made him happy was that his two disciples had not suffered any injuries, though they had used up too much spiritual power.

He patted their shoulders to comfort them.

Yuelun also came over to Ye Xuan’s side at this time. Looking at Gao Tianyu, who was still holding Gao Shun’s body and unwilling to let go, she also felt very helpless.

As a cultivator, it was inevitable to experience life and death of loved ones on the path of cultivation.

She did not want to see Gao Tianyu lose heart because of this, so she tried to comfort him.

“Tianyu, you must be strong, understand?”

“Your father was a good man. He did his best to protect everyone’s safety. From this moment on, Hidden Sword peak will be handed over to you. You must keep his legacy going.”

The others also felt very emotional after hearing these words.

The atmosphere at the scene turned unprecedentedly serious. Yuelun looked at Ye Xuan, but did not say anything. She wished that he had arrived earlier to prevent this tragedy, but things were already set in stone, so there was no point in wishing for the impossible.

After crying for a long time, Gao Tianyu suppressed the sadness in his heart. He turned around and looked at Yuelun, then said firmly, “I will uphold his legacy. Hidden Sword peak will continue to flourish in my hands!”

At this moment, Gao Tianyu’s heart was unprecedentedly firm and determined.

After hearing this, Ye Xuan was a little stunned and speechless. Had they really given up on Gao Shun?

“You little brat, why are you saying such things? Is it time for you to take responsibility for Hidden Sword peak yet?”

Upon hearing this, the disciples present were stunned. Some of them even discussed in whispers, “I heard that Martial Uncle Ye and Martial Uncle Gao were not on good terms. Does Martial Uncle Ye want to take this opportunity to bring down Hidden Sword peak?”
