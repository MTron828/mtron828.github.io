542 The Immortal Heavenly Treasure

Outside, as the aura of the sealed immortal realm existence raged and attackedm several supreme realm experts had already died.

As for Ye Xuan and Yanran, they were still safe and sound in the vast boundless cauldron’s internal space.

Incidentally, Yanran was still in Ye Xuan’s arms, which she felt rather conflicted about. She was embarrassed, but also felt very safe.

She discovered that she actually did not want to escape Ye Xuan’s embrace.

After continuing to enjoy it for a while, Yanran finally broke free. She slowly sized up the boundless cauldron’s internal space.

“Isn’t your boundless cauldron way too powerful? We even managed to escape the attention of that ancient sealed immortal realm existence.”

Yanran felt a little envious. Her mammoth cauldron paled in comparison. She really felt like throwing it away like that sword she had lent to Ye Xuan before.

She glanced at Ye Xuan behind her and could not help but think to herself, ‘I can’t go on like this. I cannot compare myself with him, otherwise, everything I have will seem worthless and useless.’

‘He’s taken out so many powerful magic artifacts, yet it doesn’t seem like he’s run out of them.’

The only thing that comforted her was that he was already her boyfriend nominally now. He would keep her safe, right?

Thinking this, Yanran became happy again.

No matter what, as long as nothing else happened, this man would always belong to her.

In this world where strength was respected, who would not look up to strong cultivators?

It was the same for Yanran. The stronger her boyfriend was, the safer and more proud she would feel.

After some time, the commotion in the outside world died down, and the aura of the sealed immortal realm existence also disappeared.

Sensing that the danger outside was gone, Ye Xuan stroked Yanran’s head.

“Alright, it’s safe outside. Let’s go.”

“Okay.”

Yanran nodded obediently. Then, Ye Xuan teleported them out, with Yanran still in his arms.

Not far away, the four powerful beasts were also injured by the aura of the sealed immortal realm existence. They were currently hovering in the air to recuperate.

More and more people slowly returned once they realized that it was safe again. Most of the supreme realm experts of the eight continents were eventually gathered here.

After seeing this, Ye Xuan was also very surprised. After all, he really did not expect the other seven continents to have so many supreme realm experts.

Now, he finally understood why the East continent was said to be the most desolate place. It was because there were pitifully few supreme realm experts there.

At this moment, the scene was quiet, which was rare. Almost everyone’s eyes were attracted by the coffin on the back of the black tortoise.

The coffin was a large part of the reason for the huge commotion that had just been caused.

“An immortal heavenly treasure!”

After sensing the spiritual fragrance it emitted, many people exclaimed in surprise.

It seemed that the heavenly treasure everyone had been waiting for was finally going to appear, and the experts present began to circulate their spiritual power in preparation for the inevitable competition.

No matter how dangerous it was, they had to try and snatch this immortal heavenly treasure. Not only would it increase their lifespan significantly, but it would greatly increase their strength, and perhaps even break through to the next minor realm.

“Hehe! I’ve been waiting for the appearance of this immortal heavenly treasure!”

At this moment, an extremely loud voice was heard. Then, a very fat man with a chain hammer in his hand rushed over.

The fat man seemed to be emitting a murderous aura. He was also very powerful, and his aura made many people’s hair stand on end.

“Oh my god! Isn’t that Slaughter City’s assassin leader?”

“I didn’t expect him to come and join in the fun.”

Many people exclaimed in shock. Even Ye Xuan had his eyes on the man at this time, and he could clearly sense the soaring killing intent emanating from his body.

It was obvious that this person was someone who was used to killing.

Boom!

There was a loud boom. The Pixiu, who had been recuperating, slammed its claws on the ground, scaring away the cultivators who were looking at it with greedy eyes. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

At that moment, everyone was shocked.

How long had it been? Had it already recovered?

Once the immortal heavenly treasure appeared, all of the ferocious beasts took action and used their divine powers to attack the black tortoise.

A great battle was about to take place.

Upon seeing this, the heaven devouring divine sparrow began to fly around in the sky. It let out a phoenix cry and began to absorb the surrounding spiritual energy frantically.

Then, it launched a fierce attack on the black tortoise.

Seeing that the battle had commenced, the cultivators present did not make their move. Instead, they waited quietly for the opportunity to come.

No one here was a fool. They knew that the first person to make their move would likely end up becoming everyone’s target.

It was for this reason that they were all quietly waiting for the right time. As they waited, the number of people that gathered here continued to increase.

After a short while, space twisted again, and a man in luxurious clothes appeared in the sky.

“It’s the Saint of the Heavenly Wind Divine sect, Ou Yunhai!”

“He’s also an advanced-stage supreme realm expert!”

The man’s arrival caused another commotion…
