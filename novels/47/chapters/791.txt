792 Ye Xuan Is Dead?

If he was really pulled into the void Ye Xuan would probably have a slim chance of survival under the powerful spatial forces at work there.

Sensing that something was wrong, Ye Xuan instantly broke free from Heavenly King Li’s hug, but it was already too late. This guy was already about to self-destruct!

The Godsword slashed upwards and cut off Heavenly King Li’s hand in an instant, and he fled as far as fast as he could.

‘F*ck! If you want to die, just die. Why must you drag me along with you?’

“Hehehe!”

As Heavenly King Li’s final peal of crazy laughter rang out, a shocking explosion erupted.

The people who were fighting stopped at the same time and looked up at the sky, and saw space shatter inch by inch. Everyone’s hearts trembled violently.

At this moment, Zhuge Yue Yue felt strength leave her body, and she collapsed hopelessly.

After the explosion, she could no longer sense where her teacher was. It was as if he had disappeared from this world.

Feng Xiyun covered her face and started crying. She lay on the ground and sobbed.

Fortunately, they had already sent Xiang Yun back to Cloud Sky peak. Otherwise, other problems would probably arise if the seal was loosened when her emotions ran wild.

“Junior Brother!”

This scene happened too quickly, and no one even had time to warn him. After the explosion, everyone’s hearts sank.

Gao Shun’s face was full of resentment as he looked at the sky, and Ao Lei’s eyes were bloodshot. Could it be that the Great Wilderness Divine sect would have to experience the same thing as they did a hundred years ago?

They could not accept this. Everyone present could not accept this.

In the hearts of everyone on Sky Mountain, Ye Xuan had become their pillar of support. His achievements and strength drove them to cultivate harder, and become stronger.

However, their once invincible Sword Immortal was now gone!

At this moment, no one could sense Ye Xuan’s presence at all. It was as if he had been reduced to ashes within that violent explosion.

“Martial Uncle, I didn’t even have the time to say goodbye to you…”

Hua Rufeng’s heart sank. He knelt down in the direction where Ye Xuan had been flying in the sky.

When the other disciples saw this, they all knelt down in unison, wanting to send Ye Xuan off one last time.

Everyone raised their heads and searched frantically for Ye Xuan’s figure, but failing to do so they were disappointed.

There was only a huge cauldron in the sky that seemed battered and damaged. There was nothing else.

“Boundless Cauldron!”

Zhuge Yueyue was stunned when she saw the huge cauldron. She stood up excitedly.

She was no stranger to the Boundless Cauldron. After all, her teacher had used it to refine pills in front of them before.

At this moment, everyone turned to look at the huge cauldron, and sure enough, a figure appeared out of thin air.

“Heavens! He’s still alive,” Gao Shun muttered these words to himself.

Seeing this familiar figure, everyone became indescribably excited.

Ye Xuan stretched out his right hand and used the Godsword to unleash several sword beams, instantly killing some of the more powerful vengeful spirits.

“He’s still alive. Teacher is still alive,” Zhuge Yueyue said in a trembling voice. She had really felt that she was going to be separated from her teacher forever, and that her teacher had disappeared without even saying goodbye.

Now, her body was filled with strength anew.

The rest of the onlookers were in an uproar.

“Unbelievable! Sword Immortal Ye managed to survive even that!”

“He beat all seven of those strange monsters, and even killed four of them! He’s invincible!”

After they came to their senses, the crowd instantly cheered and shouted, and their cheers echoed throughout Sky Mountain.

At this moment, Hua Rufeng shouted even louder and said, “All disciples of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, Martial Uncle Ye has dealt with the greatest threats! Now, it’s our time to shine! Get those beasts and show them the might of our sect!”

“Kill them all!”

After hearing this, the fighting spirit of the members of the Great Wilderness Divine sect was roused to its peak!
