345 I’m Here On Teacher’s Orders

“Ah!”

The grand elder let out a furious roar toward the sky. His white hair stood on end, and his eyes glowed with divine light. However, his aura was gradually getting weaker and weaker.

And as time passed, more and more human race experts fell. The sea race experts swarmed the remaining human cultivators.

“Detestable! If this continues, we’ll all die!”

“Damn it! The sea race’s attack is too fierce. I’m afraid the Nanzhou Region can no longer hold on!”

The grand elder’s expression was extremely unsightly.

Not far away, Jun Lingtian had also suffered considerable injuries, and the number of pattern condensation realm experts surrounding him was increasing.

At this moment, a powerful aura suddenly manifested itself, as a Yaksha made his presence known.

Lightning tribulation realm?!

The expressions of the human experts changed drastically when they saw this. They could sense the power of tribulation lightning brewing within the Yaksha’s body.

The power of tribulation lightning contained the power of the natural laws of the Tianyuan continent.

The lightning tribulation realm was the realm between the King realm and the pattern condensation realm. That being said, most lightning tribulation realm cultivators chose to cultivate in seclusion.

The reason was very simple. Tribulation lightning was affected by karma. If they accumulated too much negative karma, the tribulation lightning they faced during their three tribulations would likely become unbearable, and they would perish..

“Don’t worry! Although he’s powerful, he definitely won’t make a move!”

While the human experts were shocked, they believed that the Yaksha would not make a move.

However, moments later, they were proven wrong..

The Yaksha expert slowly raised his hand, and the trident in his hand erupted with monstrous divine might. The power of lightning filled the surroundings, as if trying to devour everything.

As two dazzling bolts of lightning flashed past, two human pattern condensation realm experts died instantly.

Seeing this, Jun Lingtian’s pupils involuntarily contracted, and a sense of uneasiness welled up in his heart.

Why did it feel like this lightning tribulation realm Yaksha was unafraid of tribulation lightning?

Before they could even react, the Yaksha expert killed another pattern condensation realm expert.

“Damn it!”

Seeing this, Jun Lingtian roared in anger.

However, the number of sea race experts surrounding him was simply too great. He could barely keep himself safe as it was.

Moreover, even if he did extricate himself from their encirclement, he would not be able to defeat that lightning tribulation expert.

Buzzzzzz!

Another pattern condensation realm expert died at the hands of the Yaksha expert, following which ten ninth-level unity realm experts were annihilated by a swing of his trident.

At this moment, the Yaksha expert raised the trident in his hand again, and his gaze fell on the grand elder.

“Curses!”

The grand elder’s expression changed drastically as he felt a sense of dread wash over him. He knew that he was next.

“No! I can’t die! I don’t want to die!”

Facing the threat of death, the grand elder moved to take out the jade token from his storage ring without any hesitation.

However, just as he was about to crush the jade token, he found that he could not move his body.

It was not only him. Even the lightning tribulation realm Yaksha felt a terrifying pressure descend on him, causing his speed to decrease rapidly.

A huge crack suddenly appeared in the sky, which spat out terrifying bolts of lightning.

Moments later, a streak of lightning flashed by, and a beautiful figure appeared in the sky.

The woman stared at the Yaksha realm expert expressionlessly. A divine sword suddenly appeared in her hand.

Buzzzzzz!

It was just a simple sword strike, but the world suddenly lost color!

The Yaksha expert had no time to reach and was instantly devoured by her sword qi.

His body and soul were reduced to dust, never to rise again.

In an instant, the surroundings fell silent.

“I’m here on teacher’s orders to destroy the sea race and protect the human race’s territory!”

The person was none other than Shangguan Wan’er.

“It’s her!”

“Shangguan Wan’er!”

“The master of the Luo heaven Palace!”

Many of the people who had come to support the Nanzhou Region were experts from the Miaoling Region, and they quickly recognized Shangguan Wan’er.

Wait!

Was that heavenly lightning intent? Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

When had Shangguan Wan’er comprehended a supreme intent?

Furthermore, it was to the level where it was engraved as a profound pattern!

A strange light flashed across Jun Lingtian’s eyes.
