860 Is Elder Qian Yi Dead?

Well, it was time to test his hypothesis.

Moments later, a stream of insights regarding the immortal-grade Heaven Burning Flames technique poured into his mind, and he began to study and comprehend it.

Ye Xuan had only glanced at it briefly when he broke out in cold sweat.

Holy hell!

He had never expected that the new Heaven Burning Flames technique would actually reach such a terrifying level. A cursory glance was all it took for him to feel astonishing pressure. If she could really successfully master this cultivation technique, then from now on, who would dare to provoke her?

Based on the current situation, the only cultivation technique that could compete with the Heaven Burning Flames technique in terms of power was the Stellar sword technique.

If he cultivated this technique in addition to the Stellar sword technique, just how powerful would he become?

Furthermore, anyone who cultivated this technique would not have to worry about the power of karma, as the Heaven Burning Flames could even burn that!

“Heavens! I’ve hit the jackpot this time,” Ye Xuan muttered to himself excitedly.

He then refocused himself and began to seriously study and comprehend the technique.

Because Feng Xiyun’s comprehension ability was insufficient, he had to grasp the essence first and simplify it before imparting it to her. Fortunately, Feng Xiyun was already cultivating the defective version of the technique, so she would not have to start from scratch, and it would not be too difficult to make the transition.

Waves of golden light shone on Ye Xuan’s forehead, and while he was cultivating this cultivation technique, strong winds and clouds surrounded the peak, and the sky began to surge with spiritual energy. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

In the blink of an eye, three Dao Flowers appeared out of thin air, releasing waves of shocking power.

“What is going on?”

At this moment, the chiefs in the meeting hall sensed this abnormality, and left the room. When they saw what was happening, their expressions changed drastically.

The phenomenon was happening above Cloud Sky peak!

“Could it be that Teacher has improved again?” Zhuge Yueyue was wondering what happened.

At this moment, Hua Rufeng arrived, completely drenched in sweat and flying at top speed.

Gao Shun noticed that his face was pale and that he was in a hurry. Moreover, Elder Qian Yi was not by his side. He suddenly had a bad feeling about this.

“Rufeng, what happened? Why did you come back alone? Where is Elder Qian Yi?”

The other chiefs all turned to look at Hua Rufeng, who cut to the chase and did not bother with the usual pleasantries.

“Martial Uncles, hurry up and go to the Cloud Sky peak. I’m afraid Martial Uncle Ye wants to kill Elder Qian Yi!”

“This…”

After hearing these words, everyone was shocked and in disbelief.

Why did Ye Xuan want to kill Elder Qian Yi? What could possibly be the reason for this? Could it be that this Elder Qian Yi had provoked Ye Xuan?

However, this was not the time for questions. Ao Lei immediately set off for Cloud Sky peak, and the other chiefs followed closely behind.

However, when they reached the vicinity of Cloud Sky peak, they were shocked to discover that they could not enter the peak!

This made them extremely anxious. Furthermore, they could sense that the temperature inside Cloud Sky peak was constantly rising.

“Oh no! Oh no! Is Elder Qian Yi really going to die?”

Gao Shun was very nervous. Judging from the current situation, something important had happened inside. However, Elder Qian Yi was just an early-stage supreme realm cultivator. In front of a sealed immortal realm cultivator like Ye Xuan, he was no different from an ant. Ye Xuan could easily crush him with a wave of his hand.

“What is going on in there? Could it be that Elder Qian Yi really provoked Junior Brother Ye?” Ao Lei was filled with anxiety.

Of all people, why did this fellow have to provoke Ye Xuan?

If the worst case scenario unfolded, then the two sister sects would become enemies instead of friends!

Boom!

While everyone was panicking, a huge ball of flames appeared, causing the temperature around Cloud Sky peak to skyrocket. After sensing this power, everyone was extremely surprised. Ao Lei’s expression changed drastically as he blurted out, “Heaven Burning Flames!”

“This…”

After hearing this, everyone was stunned. Was that what that was?

Everyone present knew about the Heaven Burning Flames, as it was Feng Xiyun’s cultivation technique. However, the flames she unleashed and these flames in front of them now could not even be considered to be on the same level at all!

“Senior Brother Ao, do you think these flames are really from the Heaven Burning Flames?” Gao Shun asked suspiciously, and the others also looked over at the same time.

Ao Lei’s expression was unprecedentedly solemn. He knew that he was not wrong. Back when he explored an ancient ruin, he was fortunate enough to see these flames, and would never forget them.

After all, this Heaven Burning Flames were already considered the most powerful flames in the world. Nothing could withstand them!

“It definitely is the Heaven Burning Flames,” Ao Lei said with certainty.
