Chapter 284: Fourth Disciple

A tree branch that was emitting a divine light suddenly appeared in the system’s storage space.

Ye Xuan opened his palm, and the crimson dreamsoul branch appeared in his hand.

Moments later, as Shangguan Wan’er watched transfixed, Ye Xuan gave Li Qingyan the crimson dreamsoul branch.

“Qingyan, this is your teacher’s gift to you!”

“After you break through, I will definitely help you refine it!”

“Many thanks, Teacher!” Li Qingyan said happily.

“Ding! As the host has given his disciple the crimson dreamsoul branch, the host has received a randomized 66x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the netherblood hell grass!”

As soon as the system notification ended, Ye Xuan suddenly sensed an extremely strong aura of death in his storage space.

This was the power of the netherblood hell grass.

Although refining it would greatly increase the comprehension value of the cultivator, there were also significant side effects.

There was a certain requirement for the strength of the cultivator who refined the netherblood hell grass. If they were not strong enough, the aura of death would seep into their consciousness and drive them crazy.

Of course, if one’s spiritual power was strong enough, they would be immune to this side effect.

That being said, none of Ye Xuan’s disciples had the ability to refine it yet.

In addition, it would only be dangerous if they refined it personally without his help, which would never happen because Ye Xuan would take every opportunity to reap rewards from the system..

When Ye Xuan took out the netherblood hell grass, it shocked everyone.

Demonic blood-red aura suddenly swept out and covered the entirety of the Qingyun sect in an instant.

When the cultivators of the Qingyun sect sensed this, their expressions changed drastically.

Some of the weaker ones trembled as if they had fallen into the pits of hell.

“What did Elder Ye Xuan do this time?”

Although they did not know how this phenomenon had come about, anything unusual had to have something to do with Ye Xuan.

Beside him, Shangguan Wan’er was completely dumbfounded. She stared at the netherblood hell grass in Ye Xuan’s hand with a dazed look.

Just as Ye Xuan was about to give it to Yue, Shangguan Wan ‘er could not stop herself from involuntarily taking a few steps forward.

She was tempted! She wanted this treasure!

However, the moment she raised her hand, she seemed to have thought of something, and gritted her teeth before putting it down.

This was something that he had given to his disciple. What did it have to do with her?

She struggled for a long time before finally making a decision. She bit her lips slightly and looked at Ye Xuan with a determined gaze.

“If I were to acknowledge you as my teacher, would you really give me such a precious treasure?”

“No!” Ye Xuan looked at Shangguan Wan’er and shook his head.

Her body trembled, and she lowered her head in a daze.

As expected! This guy was toying with her!

She had been too naive!

Just as Shangguan Wan’er was feeling extremely aggrieved, Ye Xuan smiled and continued speaking in a gentle tone.

“I have more precious spiritual items with me. If you need them, I can give them to you at any time!”

Shangguan Wan’er’s eyes suddenly lit up. She raised her head and looked at Ye Xuan in shock.

Was this guy telling the truth? Was he toying with her again?

The netherblood hell grass was already incomparably precious, and yet he said had an even better heavenly treasure? Was this a joke?

What should she do?

Fine then!

She bit her lip, then knelt down in front of Ye Xuan.

“I, Shangguan Wan’er, acknowledge Ye Xuan as my teacher today!”

“Disciple greets Teacher!”

The most powerful cultivator of the Miaoling Region, the master of the Luo Heaven Palace, the reincarnation of an ancient great empress, had abandoned the pride in her heart.

“Very good! from today onward, you will be my fourth disciple!”

After successfully conquering Shangguan Wan’er, Ye Xuan’s mood was excellent, and he helped Shangguan Wan’er up with a smile.

He was looking forward to what special constitution he would obtain after he helped this new disciple of his awaken her Undying Xuan Huang sword physique.

Shangguan Wan’er looked a little lost. She was not used to calling anyone her Teacher.

“What? What did you just call me?”

“I consumed too much spiritual power just now, so I didn’t hear what you said clearly,” Ye Xuan said with a teasing smile. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Teasing this tsundere empress brought him a lot of joy.
