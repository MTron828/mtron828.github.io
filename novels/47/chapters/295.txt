296 Seventh-Level Heart Of Heavenly Lightning

Who did it?

Based on the information they had on hand, it could not be Ye Xuan.

Despite the fact that he was very likely to be the reincarnation of some ancient almighty expert, such strength could not be obtained at such a young age.

Furthermore, according to the current information, there was basically no expert backing Ye Xuan up, though they now seriously doubted this fact.

The interval between the deaths of their subordinates had been so minute that even a King realm expert who possessed the profound pattern of wind would not have been able to kill them as quickly.

Those King realm experts who had sent subordinates had all contacted each other beforehand in order to ensure a fair competition between themselves for the Tower of Heaven, so when their subordinates died, they immediately contacted each other.

This whole situation was a mystery, which made them feel somewhat afraid.

No ordinary King realm expert could accomplish such a feat. Within the King realm itself, there were three major realms, which were the Human King realm, Heavenly King realm, and Saint King realm.

The difference between each realm was vast, and the reason why the ancestor of the Divine Gate Holy Land was able to restrain the other King realm experts was because he was a Saint King realm expert.

These King realm experts who were targeting Ye Xuan’s Tower of Heaven were Human King realm experts, so the thought that Ye Xuan might have a Heavenly King or Saint King behind him was particularly unsettling for them.

…

After cleaning up those subordinates, Ye Xuan returned to the Qingyun sect.

Ye Xuan’s power of karma also allowed him to vaguely see the karmic lines between him and those King realm experts, but as he had yet to comprehend the true form of karmic intent, he was unable to identify or trace them.

Still, Ye Xuan was not in a hurry. He had plenty of time in the future.

Moreover, after this incident, it was unlikely that they would bother him until they had completed their investigations.

Ye Xuan examined the surging power in his body, and a smile hung on the corners of his mouth.

After arriving at the Qingyun sect, Ye Xuan did not immediately call Yue and the others over. Instead, he entered the Tower of Heaven and locked the black giant and the golden demonic ape in the same space.

When the two demonic beasts saw each other, they charged without any hesitation and started fighting.

Roar!

Roar!

Both demonic beasts were extremely strong, especially in terms of their physical strength and toughness.

The destructive force from their attacks tore space apart and created spatial cracks everywhere. Were it not for the fact that the Tower of Heaven’s spatial intent was strong enough to repair the spatial cracks instantly, they might have escaped.

However, in their frenzied state, it was unlikely that they would even have the presence of mind to do so. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The golden demonic ape was beating the black giant up.

However, because the black giant had engraved the profound pattern of earth, its defensive capabilities were outstanding, which allowed it to take the beating while remaining relatively unharmed.

Ye Xuan watched all of this silently from the side. He used the battle between the two demonic beasts to comprehend their martial intents.

With Ye Xuan’s current strength, he had no interest in ordinary martial intents, but he would happily learn those that were related to a supreme or powerful intent, as well increase the levels of the martial intents he had already comprehended.

The vibration and fist intents were both a branch of the strength intent, so comprehending these would aid him greatly in the future.

In any case, Ye Xuan had already comprehended two supreme intents, so comprehending these other intents was naturally much easier.

Ten days passed quickly, and Ye Xuan got what he needed. Now, there was no need for these two demonic beasts to exist.

Ye Xuan waved his hand, and a surge of power gushed out, instantly killing the two demonic beasts.

After doing all this, Ye Xuan called Shangguan Wan’er over.

At present, among his disciples, Shangguan Wan’er had the greatest potential, so she was undoubtedly the most suitable person to reap rewards from.

It was also the same old routine as before, basically giving away martial techniques, cultivation methods, and spiritual sense tempering techniques, followed by heavenly treasures that could increase her innate bone value and comprehension value.

However, this time, Ye Xuan was far more careful when he performed spiritual power infusion, limiting himself to an appropriate amount. He paid close attention to any warnings he received from the power of karma.

After that, Ye Xuan’s strength increased again, and it seemed that he would have to enter a period of secluded cultivation again in order to stabilize and regulate his newfound power.

That being said, it was not time for that yet.

Ye Xuan then took out a heart of heavenly lightning.

“This is the heart of heavenly lightning that you’ve been eyeing. I will now bestow it upon you,” Ye Xuan said with a smile.

“Many thanks, Teacher!”

Seeing this, Shangguan Wan ‘er’s eyes brightened, and she took the heart of heavenly lightning excitedly.

It was actually a fifth-level heart of heavenly lightning!

With this, her heavenly lightning intent would reach the fifth level!

“Ding! As the host has given his disciple a fifth-level heart of heavenly lightning, the host has obtained a randomized 90x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained a seventh-level heart of heavenly lightning!”
