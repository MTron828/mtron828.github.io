532 Killing With One Move

‘If he said that, then what should I say later?’

‘Shouldn’t I be the one to say that?’

Ye Xuan was stunned. He was extremely unhappy that Ouyang Xiu had stolen his lines.

Ouyang Xiu was not in a hurry to make a move. Instead, he sneered, “As a sword cultivator, don’t tell me you don’t even have your own sword?”

!!

After hearing this, Yanran was also surprised.

Ouyang Xiu was right. Ye Xuan was clearly a sword cultivator, yet why had he not taken out his sword?

After hesitating for a while, Yanran took out a high-grade sword from her storage space and threw it over to Ye Xuan.

“Senior Brother, I’ll let you use this sword for a while.”

“Ah, but you have to return it to me after you’re done.”

After hearing this, Ye Xuan was dumbfounded. At first, she thought that his senior sister was so rich that she could casually give him a magic artifact. It turned out that she was only lending it to him.

After weighing the sword that Yanran handed over a few times, Ye Xuan returned it to her.

“Senior Sister, you can take this weapon back. I don’t need it for the time being.”

After hearing this, Yanran’s brows furrowed. Did Ye Xuan disdain her sword?

No matter what, this sword’s grade was pretty good.

Even though she was a little unhappy, she still asked curiously, “What about your own sword?”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan smiled slightly, and then took out his Cloud Heaven Sword, saying indifferently, “My sword is pretty ordinary.”

As soon as he finished speaking, the entire sky seemed to have lost its color. As the Cloud Heaven Sword asserted its dominance, the Disha Sword in Ouyang Xiu’s hand seemed to pale in comparison.

“That sword… It’s a divine-rank sword!”

Both Ouyang Xiu and Yanran were so shocked that their mouths were wide open.

Ye Xuan actually had a divine-rank sword!

Furthermore, the sword seemed to have recognized Ye Xuan as its master a long time ago, and they were completely in sync.

This damned person was just showing off, right?

He took out a divine-rank sword and called it ordinary!

Yanran did not know what to say anymore. She even wanted to kick Ye Xuan’s butt.

Why did he not take out this sword earlier?

If he did, she would not have made a fool of herself by lending him that inferior sword.

Now, looking at the sword Ye Xuan had just returned to her, Yanran suddenly felt very displeased. Moments later, she threw it down to the ground.

Comparisons were really ruthless…

When he saw Ye Xuan take out the Cloud Heaven Sword, Ouyang Xiu’s face, which had been full of pride, turned pale.

It was as if he had been pushed down from the top of a mountain. The difference between Ye Xuan’s sword and his was akin to the difference between heaven and earth.

Even sealed immortal realm experts would covet that sword!

“Why? Why do you have a divine-rank sword?”

Ouyang Xiu asked with a pale face. His earlier arrogance was no longer present.

When he first took out the Disha Sword, he believed that he would definitely win this time, but reality was cruel.

If this was a game, it was like a newbie going up against a pro. There simply was no comparing the two.

Ouyang Xiu’s face was already covered with cold sweat, as he frantically tried to figure out what to do.

Ye Xuan did not want to waste time talking to him, so he simply gripped his sword and used the second move of the Flora sword technique.

Ye Xuan did not hold back at all. After all, he was already annoyed by this stinky old man.

Moments later, an extremely terrifying sword beam coursed through the sky and came crashing down on Ouyang Xiu.

“Stop”

Ouyang Xiu shouted from the bottom of his heart as he tried his best to block Ye Xuan’s attack.

However, all his efforts were in vain.

The moment the Disha Sword touched the sword beam, it shattered in less than a second.

At this moment, Ouyang Xiu could only unwillingly open his eyes wide as he watched his body being split into two by Ye Xuan’s powerful sword beam. Even his soul was annihilated, never to be reincarnated.

“Uh…”

Yanran could scarcely believe what she had just seen. She rubbed her eyes in disbelief.

Ouyang Xiu, who she had been fighting fiercely with for several days, was actually killed by Ye Xuan in one move? Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

At this moment, even Yanran, who thought highly of herself, felt a little nervous.

After all, there was not much difference in strength between her and Ouyang Xiu. Since Ye Xuan could deal with Ouyang Xiu in one move, would it not be the same for her?

Yanran’s dazed expression was in stark contrast to her cold expression just now. Honestly, it painted an odd picture.

After looking at Yanran’s dazed expression, Ye Xuany took the mammoth cauldron from Ouyang Xiu’s corpse and thought to himself, ‘I wonder if I’ll get a 10,000x reward multiplier after I give this cauldron to Yanran?”

Thinking this, Ye Xuan got up and walked over to her, smiling.

“Senior Sister, this mammoth cauldron will be my gift to you.”

Hearing this, she quickly came back to her senses.
