Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Although Ye Xuan was already an eternal realm expert, even his current strength would not allow him to fully wield the Reincarnation Dao.

It was unclear how much time had passed, but when Ye Xuan finally opened his eyes and realized that the Forbidden Lord’s hair had already turned white.

Even so, the latter’s face was still smiling, as if he had already let go of everything in the past, and there was nothing left for him to worry about.

“Forbidden Lord, what’s wrong?”

Hearing this, the Forbidden Lord shook his head indifferently and said, “It’s just a small matter. I’ve already been imprisoned in this place for an unknown period of time, Besides, it’s just white hair.”

Ye Xuan felt very emotional at this moment. Not only did the Forbidden Lord teach him a new path, but he also gave him the Reincarnation Dao. This great kindness made Ye Xuan regard the Forbidden Lord as his teacher.

Perhaps the Forbidden Lord only considered this a matter of helping a junior, and had high hopes for him, but Ye Xuan wanted to do something in return.

“Do you know what method can help you escape this place?” Ye Xuan asked sincerely.

However, the Forbidden Lord waved his hand and replied, “There’s no need for you to waste your energy. After staying here for such a long time, I’m already used to it.”

“Besides, the cage I’m in was set up by a peerless expert.”

“At this moment, you are not even qualified to hear his name. Don’t take things too hard and try to accomplish the impossible. Otherwise, your life will be in danger.”

After sighing, the Forbidden Lord spoke again.

“Young man, I’m anticipating your future achievements. Perhaps one day, you’ll really be able to reach a realm that no one has reached.”

“I’ve already roughly divined your fate. Thanks to the three Dao Flowers in your body, your level of talent has reached unprecedented heights.”

“However, from today onward, it is up to you to pioneer your own path. I have already done everything I can to help you. You can only rely on yourself in the future.’

“l don’t know what will happen in the future. Perhaps we will meet again someday. By then, 1 hope you will be much stronger.”

After saying this, a brilliant smile appeared on the Forbidden Lord’s face, and he waved his hand and sent Ye Xuan out of the cage.

He did not say goodbye, as if certain that they would meet again one day in the future.

At this moment, a golden light flashed and shone upon Ye Xuan’s body, after which his soul returned to his body. However, it took some time for his body and soul to readjust themselves, which caused him to spit out a mouthful of blood.

“Junior Brother Ye, how do you feel?”

When everyone saw that Ye Xuan had returned, they immediately came forward to examine him with concern. Ao Lei was the one who asked about his condition.

Ye Xuan casually wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth, waved his hand, and replied, “It’s nothing serious. I just haven’t adapted to my current condition. It will take a while.’

After saying this, Ye Xuan sat down cross-legged and began to regulate his breathing.

With the help of the Forbidden Lord, Ye Xuan had already reached the eternal realm, and the three Dao Flowers, which represented the future, the present, and the past, had condensed into three Dao Spirits. However, these Dao Spirits were still dormant.

Ye Xuan could tell that these spirits were terrifying. When they woke up, it was likely that something big would happen.

‘The Great Dao that Senior taught me can shake the sky and split the earth with just my fists. I can intimidate my enemies with just a wave of my hand and a stomp of my foot.’

‘If I can really reach the end of this path, how strong will I become?’

Various thoughts ran through Ye Xuan’s mind, and he was filled with anticipation for the future.

The Forbidden Lord had also mentioned that after he broke through and

reached the eternal realm, the true path to immortality would begin. This

meant that he was just at the starting point.

The Heavenly Dao World, and perhaps even other worlds, were waiting for Ye Xuan to explore and conquer.

Some time passed, and Ye Xuan finished adjusting and adapting himself to his condition.

He could clearly tell that his combat strength had increased by hundreds, or even thousands of times. Even he himself could not accurately gauge how strong he was now. He would have to fight a proper opponent to figure this out.

After taking a deep breath, Ye Xuan relaxed his entire body, and an indifferent expression appeared on his face again. His temperament and appearance seemed to undergo a change at this moment, and he looked like a true immortal.

This was immediately evident to those around him, and they immediately began discussions in earnest.

“l don’t know if you guys have noticed, but after Martial Uncle Ye’s soul left his body, his aura underwent a tremendous change. It’s almost as if he’s become a completely different person, and no longer seems to be a part of this world.”

Ye Xuan had already become the person every disciple in the sect aspired to emulate. Even though he was not always around, he had become the pillar of the sect that everyone looked up to, and their strongest support when times of trouble came.

Thanks to him, everyone was driven to constantly cultivate and improve themselves.

“Junior Brother Ye, have you really reached the eternal realm?”

Gao Shun came forward and asked in disbelief.L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

At this moment, he was still very much dumbfounded, and could not comprehend how Ye Xuan had broken through and advanced to the eternal realm so easily.

Was it not rumored that reaching the eternal realm was harder than ascending to the heavens?

However, Ye Xuan’s soul had only left his body for a period of time, yet when it returned, he had magically reached the eternal realm.. It was simply magical and mind-boggling!
