891 Decisiveness

“I’ve always been this bold,” Feng Xiyun replied coldly.

Not only did she want to destroy the lightning tiger’s cultivation, she also wanted to take its life! It would experience what it felt like to be on the receiving end.

At this moment, the atmosphere had fallen silent. No one had expected Feng Xiyun to be so bold.

The lightning tiger race also had ancestors in the Heavenly Dao World, and were terrifying. Was she not afraid of their revenge?

“This is bad. It seems like we’ve really caused trouble.”

This situation made Lu Xiu nervous, and he did not really know what to do. This was the reality of the world. Those who had strong backgrounds could do whatever they wanted, and would not have to fear others seeking them out for revenge.

However, if they were defeated, they would be spared, and the other party would rarely even injure them too severely.

Thus, crippling the lightning tiger’s cultivation was akin to disregarding the lightning tiger race. There was no way the ancestors of the race would let Feng Xiyun off so easily.

“Hehehe!”

The lightning tiger laughed out loud.

“Little girl, I have to acknowledge your strength, but I’m afraid you won’t be able to live long in this lifetime.”

“Are you ready for the consequences? You actually dared to cripple my cultivation! Whether it’s you or the Great Wilderness Divine sect, both will not escape doom!”

The lightning tiger had already gone mad. Feng Xiyun was well aware that what she had done would have consequences, but since things had developed to this point, it was best to just finish the job.

In any case, she remembered her teacher’s words. He would resolve any problems she encountered.

Thus, an even denser killing intent rose in Feng Xiyun’s heart as she spoke with a cold expression.

“You are about to die, yet you still dare to spout nonsense. Even if I kill you today, what can you do to me?”

She instantly summoned her Heaven Burning Flames as she looked at the lightning tiger. It was looking at her mockingly, daring her to kill it. It did not believe that she would dare to do it.

Unfortunately, what the lightning tiger did not know was that Feng Xiyun had already made up her mind, and that it was thus in for a nasty surprise…

The final surprise of its life!

With a wave of her hand, the Heaven Burning Flames engulfed the lightning tiger, and within a minute, accompanied by the pained and anguished roars of the lightning tiger, it was turned to ashes.

Actually, there were not even ashes left. Such was the power of the Heaven Burning Flames.

“Master!”

Seeing that their master had been killed so easily, the subordinates of the lightning tiger were filled with anger.

“Damned b*tch, you actually dared to kill our master. Just you wait and see. When our ancestors arrive, they will definitely pull out your bones and skin you alive.”

After that subordinate shouted angrily, the whole group of subordinates immediately turned around and left without hesitation. From the looks of things, it was obvious that they were going to call for reinforcements.

When Lu Xiu realized that something was wrong, he immediately shouted, “Hurry up and catch them. Don’t let them escape!”

Once this order was issued, the scene suddenly became chaotic. The disciples of the Great Wilderness Divine sect launched attacks without hesitation, and tried to capture all of the subordinates of the lightning tiger.

However, at this moment, Feng Xiyun stopped them and said, “Actually, there’s no need for that.”

“This place is already being watched. We can hide the incident for a while, but we can’t hide it forever. There’s no need to do such useless things.”

Feng Xiyun understood very well that the East continent was full of spies from the other continents, who were all here for the ancient palace. There was no way they could suppress the news for long.

Therefore, it was better to just face the problem head-on.

“But…”

Lu Xiu was about to speak, but when he saw that the subordinates had already left, he could only give up.

“Sigh… Martial Niece Feng, you were too impulsive just now.”

Lu Xiu sighed. He felt very helpless.

Why were the disciples of the Cloud Sky peak all so eccentric?

She said she wanted to kill him, so she killed him without hesitation. Did she not think about the consequences of this matter at all?

It seemed like Ye Xuan’s disciples were all as unbridled as he was.

The other cultivators of the East continent were also worried.

Elder Tongtian said, “Martial Niece Feng, I suggest that you stay far away from this place. It might not be long before their reinforcements arrive…”

After saying this, Elder Tongtian did not continue, but his meaning was very clear.

If Feng Xiyun’s teacher was here, perhaps they would not have to be so worried. However, no one had spotted a single trace of Ye Xuan’s presence up till now, so they were all very worried about Feng Xiyun.

However, just as they were discussing animatedly, another voice rang out from afar. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Hehe! You’re really not bad!”
