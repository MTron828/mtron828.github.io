617 Disaster Preparation

Hearing Ye Xuan’s instructions, Xiang Yun said happily, “Teacher, you don’t have to worry. You know that I’ve always been very obedient. I’ll learn how to read seriously.”

Then, after settling Xiang Yun’s matter, Ye Xuan flew off.

“Ding! You have given your disciple Xiang Yun a body refining sheepskin scroll and have received a 10,000x critical reward!”

“Congratulations! You have obtained a heaven-grade body refining technique (incomplete immortal-grade technique).”

!!

“Oh?” Ye Xuan raised his eyebrows and muttered to himself, “An incomplete immortal-grade technique?”

After carefully reading through the technique’s description, Ye Xuan was genuinely surprised.

Even in ancient times, this technique would have been considered very powerful. That being said, it was incomplete, so the effects of the technique would not be fully unleashed until one mastered and completed it.

It was very suitable for Xiang Yun to cultivate.

“This little girl… I really want to know which reincarnated expert you are.”

While he was thinking this, he was flying toward the meeting hall.

By the time he arrived, the chiefs of the other peaks had already arrived.

Today, the summons to gather had been issued by Ao Lei, who had kept the discussion topic a secret.

Seeing that Ye Xuan had finally arrived, Ao Lei slowly said, “Everyone, I’ve called you here today to discuss something important.”

“Senior brother Ao, don’t keep us in suspense. Hurry up and tell us what’s going on.”

They recalled that Ao Lei had left abruptly from Cloud Sky peak after hearing some news, so they predicted that something serious was going on.

Ao Lei did not beat around the bush and said, “When we attacked and destroyed the Immortal Divine sect, each of you witnessed the strange power at work personally.”

“Previously, I ordered people to keep an eye on the secret realm in question. Not long ago, my subordinates sent news that the crack in the secret realm is slowly expanding.”

“Given this situation, it is estimated that it won’t be long before our mystic world is connected to the secret realm that contains this strange power.” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

As soon as he finished speaking, everyone’s expression changed.

If it was allowed to spread, it would definitely cause a major disaster.

Anyone who absorbed it, especially weaker cultivators, would have their minds and consciousness completely corroded by the strange power, and be transformed into mindless killing machines.

The berserk beasts’ attack had been a result of this, so all of them knew how devastating the recurrence of that incident would be to the East continent.

Gao Shun also opened his mouth with a solemn expression at this time.

“Senior Brother Ao, do you have a method to resolve this or seal the crack?”

Ao Lei waved his hand and said helplessly, “It’s already difficult to break the seal, so it’ll be even more difficult to seal it.”

“It’s not that there’s no way, but we would probably need a sealed immortal realm expert to do so? Even with our combined strength, we won’t be able to restore the seal.”

After hearing these words, everyone realized just how difficult it was to resolve this matter.

If the crack was to get bigger and bigger, the mystic world would have to face an unprecedented and devastating disaster.

At that time, no one would be safe.

Ye Xuan’s expression also turned serious.

With his current cultivation level, he simply did not have the ability to stop this disaster from happening.

He needed to become stronger!

If this strange power invaded the mystic world, no one could escape.

If he wanted to protect the people around him and the Great Wilderness Divine sect, he had to increase his strength as much as possible before disaster struck.

Looking at everyone’s expressions, Ao Lei continued, “Everyone, there’s no need to worry too much yet. Right now, the crack is only the size of a fist.”

“It’ll probably take a long time for it to expand to a threatening level.”

“However, I’m telling you this in advance to prepare you and motivate you to get stronger. Otherwise, when disaster strikes everything and everyone we care about will be swept away by it.”

“Cultivate diligently in the days to come, and remind your disciples to do so as well, so that they too can contribute to ensuring the safety of the sect.”

After saying this, Ao Lei’s mood turned pensive.

He was not sure if the Great Wilderness Divine sect would still be able to survive this disaster.

They did not know much about this strange power, other than that it was evil, and that it could contaminate and corrode the minds of living beings.

At this moment, after Ao Lei’s warning, everyone was trying to brainstorm ideas to resolve this matter.

No one knew when this calamity would come, nor in what way would it affect them.

The only thing they could do to protect themselves was to cultivate and grow stronger.

Ye Xuan suddenly asked, “Senior Brother Ao, there’s something that I need to tell you.”

“When I was in the ancient tomb, I met cultivators from other continents. There was even one who came from the Great Wilderness Divine sect…”
