Chapter 280: Profound Pattern

Even Shangguan Wan’er, who was the reincarnation of an ancient great empress, had only obtained a total of three spiritual items that would allow her to experience an epiphany.

Thus, the Datura flower was fatally attractive to her.

Hu!

Shangguan Wan’er took a deep breath and adjusted her condition. Then, she used her spiritual sense to start examining and comprehending the slaughter intent contained within the blood-red saber.

Since she was no longer worried about Ye Xuan’s matter, she could calmly focus on cultivation and comprehension.

Half a year had passed in the blink of an eye.

It had been a year since Ye Xuan began his secluded cultivation.

In this one year, the Qingyun sect was peaceful and steadily developing.

During this time, Ye Xuan’s deeds had already spread throughout the Huangyu Zone, and many powerful experts had already learned of Ye Xuan’s existence, as well as the fact that he had obtained the Tower of Heaven.

Some had ill intentions and wanted to take action. However, at the crucial moment, the ancestor of the Divine Gate Holy Land stepped forward personally, intimidating them.

However, after some time, the sea race launched another small invasion, and there were small-scale conflicts with the humans.

After hearing that the sea race’s king realm expert might make a move, the ancestor of the Divine Gate Holy Land personally went to the Tianze Zone.

With the ancestor gone, those experts with ill intentions began to stir once again.

The Tower of Heaven was the greatest opportunity in the Moon Demon mystic realm, as well as a powerful artifact.

Yet it was now in the hands of a cultivator from a small empire. It was extremely tempting!

As the saying goes, birds die for food, and humans die for wealth.

When the benefits outweighed the losses, there would naturally be people who would take the risk!

If they could obtain the Tower of Heaven for themselves, it would be a great boost to their strength.

Of course, they naturally knew that Ye Xuan’s talent was extremely monstrous, and if they touched Ye Xuan, it was very likely to invoke the weather of the ancestor of the Divine Gate Holy Land.

Even so, there were still quite a few people who were willing to do so.

Moreover, the ancestor only focused on restraining the king realm experts.

As a king realm expert, they believed that he would not stoop so low as to bully lightning tribulation realm and pattern condensation realm cultivators. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Ye Xuan, who was concentrating on refining the heart of heavenly lightning, was unaware of all this.

However, soon, Ye Xuan’s refinement of the heart of heavenly lightning was finally completed.

In the inner space of the Tower of Heaven.

Ye Xuan hovered in the sky, surrounded by the thousands of lightning bolts, and the surrounding space rippled with destructive power.

His strength had undergone a huge transformation.

Not only did his heavenly lightning intent break through, but the strength of his body had also reached an unimaginable level.

Every inch of his body and every cell in his body was filled with destructive lightning power.

Three days later.

Amidst the dark spatial turbulence, bright purple heavenly lightning suddenly flashed. It contained a faint wisp of the laws of the world.

Moments later, heavenly lightning struck the Tower of Heaven.

“What?”

When Shangguan Wan’er saw this, she jolted to her senses.

“What’s going on?”

Shangguan Wan’er’s gaze fell on the heavenly lightning, and her expression became extremely grave.

The power contained within it was enough to make even her heart palpitate.

Such powerful supreme intent!

“What did this guy do?”

Her gaze was fixed on the Tower of Heaven.

Inside, Ye Xuan’s tightly shut eyes slowly opened, and bright purple heavenly lightning flashed across the depths of his eyes.

The very next second, a bolt of destructive heavenly lightning flashed by, tearing space apart. Even the ground trembled.

Boom!

With the appearance of the heavenly lightning, profound patterns started to condense, releasing terrifying spiritual pressure into the surroundings, which seeped out into the spatial turbulence, and even out into the Qingyun sect.

“Such power!”

Jun Lingtian, who was meditating, turned pale.

“Profound pattern?”

“Could it be a profound pattern derived from heavenly lightning intent?”

At the thought of this, Jun Lingtian’s pupils contracted abruptly, and his eyes were filled with shock.

Everyone else in the surroundings also felt the pressure, which made their bodies and souls tremble uncontrollably.

…

In the inner space of the Tower of Heaven, Ye Xuan stretched out his hand and pointed toward the sky.

A profound pattern suddenly appeared in the sky.

If ordinary cultivators were to take a look at it, their souls would be severely injured.

However, Ye Xuan was not affected by it in the slightest.

The wondrous pattern was reflected in his pupils, and it bloomed with resplendent divine light.
