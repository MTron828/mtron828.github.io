544 Ou Yunhai (Part 2)

Ou Yunhai already had ten thousand whys in his heart. How did he lose to Ye Xuan?

Why did Yanran choose Ye Xuan, despite the fact that he himself had been pursuing her for so long to no avail?

He was infuriated by this, and his affection for Yanran quickly turned into hate.

‘F*ck this!’

!!

‘So it was like this.’

‘All this time, it was just my own fantasy. In the end, things were never going to work out.’

‘Fine then! Have it your way!’

At this moment, Ou Yunhai seemed to have lost himself. He raised his head and screamed.

Seeing this, even Ye Xuan felt somewhat bad for him. He was clearly not taking this rejection well.

Well, the man could only blame bad luck that Yanran had met him during this period. Relationships could not be forced anyway.

Even though he sympathized with Ou Yunhai a little, there was no way that he was giving Yanran up.

He was still curious as to why a peerless genius like Ou Yunhai was hated by Yanran, and if she had resisted the latter’s affections for so long, how did he manage to win her over so quickly?

That being said, Ye Xuan was very confident in his own appearance. Furthermore, he was kind and generous. Perhaps this made him incredibly attractive to women, or at least so he thought.

However, the true reason was not what he had imagined it to be. Yanran was a complete novice when it came to relationships.

The biggest reason behind why she agreed was that every time her eyes met with Ye Xuan’s, her heart would beat faster. It was because of this that she thought that Ye Xuan had successfully entered her heart. There were no other complicated reasons.

“Let’s leave first,” Ye Xuan said with a calm expression, and then he took Yanran’s hand and left.

He did not want to stay, lest Ou Yunhai suddenly lose control and attack him.

Even though Ye Xuan was not afraid of Ou Yunhai, he did not want to get entangled in a meaningless fight when the immortal heavenly treasure was so close by.

Yanran was very confused at this time, staring at Ye Xuan and asking, “Are you not afraid of Ou Yunhai? Aren’t you afraid that he’ll come and cause you trouble?”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan scratched his face and said, “You knew that he would come and find trouble with me, so why did you sell me out?”

After hearing these words, Yanran smiled and said sweetly, “As my boyfriend, isn’t this your responsibility? Are you afraid?”

Ye Xuan did not know what to say. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Who exactly taught this little girl this kind of twisted logic?

How could she treat her boyfriend like this?

However, thinking about it from another perspective, Yanran’s actions were actually not bad. At least Ou Yunhai would not be entangled with her in the future.

However, he was really a little surprised just now. Yanran, who seemed like an ice-cold goddess, also could display this sort of behavior. It was perhaps something he himself would have done.

Based on this situation, the two of them were actually quite compatible.

“Ye Xuan, I have full confidence in you, okay? You will definitely be able to beat Ou Yunhai and teach him a lesson. By doing so, you can even win my heart.”

Yanran clenched her little fist and looked at Ye Xuan with a sincere expression.

“It seems that you think very highly of me,” Ye Xuan said with a smile on his face, but he had already started to plan in his heart.

Ou Yunhai’s sudden arrival had given him a good opportunity to make some progress in his relationship with Yanran.

If he performed well this time, perhaps their relationship would progress to the next level.

Therefore, he had to seize the opportunity. As long as Yanran became his official girlfriend, the system might really give him that 1,000,000x reward multiplier.

Who would not be tempted by such a reward?

Yanran looked at Ye Xuan, then at Ou Yunhai. After thinking for a while, she said, “In terms of cultivation level, your cultivation level isn’t higher than Ou Yunhai’s. In terms of battle techniques, perhaps the two of you aren’t too far apart. However, in terms of other treasures, I believe that you will definitely be able to win this battle.”

She had personally witnessed Ye Xuan’s arsenal of treasures.

Since Ye Xuan could restrain Ou Yunhai with his divine-rank sword, what was there to worry about?

It was because of this reason that she dared to do that earlier.

She could also take advantage of this opportunity to test if he was sincere toward her.

If Ye Xuan had true feelings for her, then he definitely would not be afraid of Ou Yunhai. If that was the case, then he was deserving of becoming her boyfriend.

At this moment, Ye Xuan was still looking at Yanran with a smile. He had no clue as to what was going through her mind.
