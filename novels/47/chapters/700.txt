701 Frantic Race To The Throne

By this time, Feng Xiyun had returned from the ancient realm. As she was unable to reach the Summit Space, she came out early.

Seeing Xiang Yun go berserk again, she asked worriedly, “Teacher, Third Sister is constantly stimulating that hidden power in her body. Will there be any repercussions?”

Ye Xuan waved his hand and replied, “Don’t worry. I used so many herbs to help her refine and temper her body. This small matter won’t affect her.”

“In fact, it will only make her more proficient in controlling her body, and her body refinement cultivation will probably benefit a lot from this.”

!!

Ye Xuan was very calm, but my eyes were constantly observing the situation.

“Junior Brother Ye, it looks like our sect will definitely emerge as the champion after this.”

“Your third disciple is really awesome. She took down five people!”

Ao Lei was really happy. Now, the only one left standing from another sect was the Reincarnation Fairy, and she was still fighting evenly with Hua Rufeng.

As for the remaining four disciples on the ground, well, Xiang Yun was slowly approaching them, hammer in hand.

Inside the ancient realm, Zhuge Yueyue was quietly watching Xiang Yun’s performance. After seeing that she had easily taken care of the five people, she chuckled inwardly. Then, she turned her gaze to Hua Rufeng.

It seemed that Hua Rufeng’s battle would likely end soon.

After taking another soul-returning pill, she quietly adjusted the state of her body. After a while, Zhuge Yueyue stood up without hesitation and looked in the direction of the golden throne.

Moments later, rays of golden light descended from the sky. The path leading to the golden throne had been connected.

At this moment, the four people who had been beaten up by Xiang Yun also stood up and charged over as fast as they could.

Just now, they had been playing dead. They were waiting for the path to the golden throne to appear, hoping to rush to the throne and claim victory before anyone else could. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

However, at this moment, a huge hammer appeared in front of them, leaving them with nowhere to go.

“Argh! It’s her again! What exactly does she want?”

Seeing Xiang Yun blocking their path, these people instantly stopped in their tracks and did not dare to take another step forward.

“Hurry up and go away. Don’t block me,” the Reincarnation Fairy said with a cold expression. She immediately launched an attack and tied Xiang Yun up.

However, at this moment, a sword beam flashed past and cut open the spiritual ropes that bound Xiang Yun.

“First Sister!”

Seeing that Zhuge Yueyue was fine, Xiang Yun was overjoyed, but what followed was the weakening of her strength.

Zhuge Yueyue had a bad feeling when she noticed this. Perhaps she should not have gotten up so early

‘Forget it, I’ll fight the final battle myself.’

After all, she had already recovered to her peak condition. Furthermore, there was no opportunity to act injured again.

As the eldest senior sister, how could she lie to her third sister repeatedly?

“Xiang Yun, go over to Senior Brother Rufeng. Leave the rest to me,” Zhuge Yueyue said as she rubbed her little head.

Xiang Yun was a little unhappy at this moment, as she had not had her fill of fun yet, but she still obediently walked over to Hua Rufeng’s side.

Seeing the berserk girl turn obedient, those who were beaten up just now were dumbfounded.

Why was she like a different person now?

When more and more golden light appeared, the protective barrier sealing the golden throne was also released.

Seeing this, the Reincarnation Fairy’s eyes were filled with yearning. She attacked again and shouted, “Get out of my way. Don’t block me!”

However, Zhuge Yueyue used the Cloud Sky Sword to easily dispel her attack. With a cold expression, she said, “If you want to win, then let’s fight.”

“How arrogant!”

“Hmph!”

A young man snorted coldly and drew his saber to attack. A powerful force erupted as he did. Zhuge Yueyue once again calmly and easily blocked the attack.

However, at this moment, the Reincarnation Fairy also launched an attack on Zhuge Yueyue. She clenched her fist and threw a punch.

Zhuge Yueyue responded in kind. When their fists collided, the Reincarnation Fairy’s face turned pale.

She had almost used up all her strength fighting earlier, and although she too had medicinal pills, they were vastly inferior to the high-grade soul-returning pills.

At this moment, when the other three disciples saw Zhuge Yue Yue and theReincarnation Fairy fighting, they immediately seized the opportunity to rush onto the path to the golden throne.

“Hehe, the champion of this year’s gathering will definitely be me!”
