470 The Dust Has Settled

“Congratulations, Fellow Daoist Ye Xuan! Hahaha!”

At this moment, Elder Tongtian also came over to greet him with a smile.

“I didn’t expect that I would have the honor to see such an earth-shaking sword technique in the Great Wilderness Divine sect. This trip has truly been worthwhile!”

“You have an eye for talent, and your disciple will become a famous expert sooner or later.”

Ye Xuan smiled and did not say anything.

“Now that the Seven Peaks competition has ended, I should return to the Heavenly Mountain Divine sect. If Fellow Daoist Ye is free, you can visit our sect as a guest at any time. I will definitely welcome you with open arms.”

Elder Tongtian was deliberately trying to get on Ye Xuan’s good side. Although Ye Xuan was young, Elder Tongtian still admired him.

Furthermore, in his eyes, Ye Xuan’s potential was greater than Zhuge Yueyue’s. It had only taken him a hundred years to break through to the mystic lord realm.

This was a friend worth making, especially in the current chaotic times, where the beasts of the archaic divine mountains were attacking.

The sects and empires of the East continent were likely to go through another great baptism of chaos. Thus, befriending powerful allies was a given.

“Fellow Daoist Tongtian, I feel like we’ve hit it off well. I’ll definitely pay you a visit in the future.”

“Hahaha! That’s good. I’ll head back first. I’ll await your arrival at the Heavenly Mountain Divine sect,” Elder Tongtian smiled and left with Mu Beichen.

Before Mu Beichen left, he looked at Ye Xuan and Zhuge Yueyue with some reluctance.

Until now, he was still immersed in Zhuge Yueyue’s earth-shaking sword strike.

Ye Xuan turned around and said to Zhuge Yueyue after those two left, “We should also head back!”

“En!” Zhuge Yueyue nodded obediently, and then followed behind Ye Xuan as they left the arena.

“Oh my God, Sister Yueyue, you were so amazing just now. My eyes were almost blinded by your brilliance!”

“I’ve already decided. Besides Chief Ye Xuan, you’ll be my second idol. From now on, I’ll follow Sister Yueyue and live a good life. If you go east, I’ll definitely not go west!”

Su Changhe ran over with a smug expression on his face.

If someone who was not in the know saw this scene, they would think that he had won the Seven Peaks competition.

Ye Xuan’s mouth twitched when he saw this, and he glared at Su Changhe.

“Can’t you act with a little more dignity? If you continue like this, how can your father be at ease letting you take over the Su family?”

“Did your father ask you to come to Cloud Sky peak to be a cheerleader?”

Su Changhe immediately lowered his head in embarrassment.

He naturally knew that his father had sent him to Cloud Sky peak to get in touch with Ye Xuan and to ease their previous grievances.

More importantly, it was so that he could broaden his horizons and experience the strength of a top-notch holy land.

Of course, Su Changhe had also been closely observing the entire Seven Peaks competition, which was why he had realized that there were many people his age stronger and more talented than he was.

His talent was sufficient to hold its own in the Yangli divine empire, and that was about it. Therefore, he knew his previous arrogance was born out of ignorance.

“Chief Ye Xuan, I understand what you mean. I’ll definitely cultivate properly in the future and will definitely not let Father down,” Su Changhe raised his head and said with determination after thinking it through.

Compared to before, Su Changhe had indeed changed a lot. He was no longer as arrogant and foppish as before.

Moreover, Su Changhe had one good trait, which was that he would never go back on his word.

Hearing this, Ye Xuan nodded in relief. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

He had long guessed Su Tiansheng’s intentions, which were to use this experience to completely correct Su Changhe’s hedonistic lifestyle and attitude.

Thankfully, Su Change was not beyond saving, and thus far, the experience had made him a much better person.

Of course, Su Tiansheng probably also had other hopes.

Aside from allowing his son to have more contact with Ye Xuan, it would be best if his son could become Ye Xuan’s disciple.

In fact, such situations were not rare in the Great Wilderness Divine sect.

The direct descendants of the major families that had connections with the seven peaks were basically all disciples of the chiefs of these peaks. Such relationships were more beneficial for the transactions between the two sides.

Ye Xuan had the same idea, but it was not the time to take in another disciple yet. In any case, Su Changhe still had a ways to go before Ye Xuan would consider taking him in as a disciple.

“Alright! Now that the competition is over, let’s head back,” Ye Xuan said lightly, and then turned and left.

It was time for him to deal with other matters.

For example, the crack in the depths of the archaic divine mountain, which was filled with a strange dark power, and the ancient tomb that was hidden there. Just who had left this behind?

Was it the Black Tortoise carrying a huge coffin that Su Changhe had mentioned earlier?

After a while, they returned to Cloud Sky peak.

The originally lively atmosphere immediately became calm. After this period of time, the palace in the peach forest of Cloud Sky peak was nearing completion.

After returning to the Cloud Sky peak, Su Changhe immediately ran to the peach forest to supervise the work.

As for Feng Xiyun, the moment she returned to Cloud Sky peak, she said that she was exhausted and went back to rest.

Ye Xuan knew that this girl was probably pressured by her senior sister’s performance and wanted to quickly absorb the power of the precious bone in her body as soon as possible. Only then would she be able to catch up to Zhuge Yueyue.
