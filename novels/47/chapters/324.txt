325 The Dragon Race

If Ye Xuan was an old monster who had reached the Heavenly King realm, how did he get in?

This was an extremely crucial question. All of them fell into a state of deep thought.

There were only two possibilities.

The first was that he had fifth-level or higher spatial intent, and the second was that he was really below the age of 50.

Of the two, only the first made sense. Then, they came to a shocking conclusion. Even the Saint King realm experts among them had only comprehended second or third-level supreme intents.

Therefore, Ye Xuan was either an extremely powerful Saint King realm expert, or perhaps even a great emperor realm expert!

They were still uncertain, though. Ye Xuan had too many secrets.

…

“I’ve received an important piece of news. Not only has Ye Xuan comprehended spatial intent, but also strength intent!”

Not long ago, Jun Moyu and Jun Feitian had encountered Ye Xuan and saw with their own eyes how Ye Xuan fused spatial and strength intents, and effortlessly killed those sea race experts.

As he said this, the master of the Divine Gate Holy Land’s aura fluctuated slightly.

It was obvious that he was also shocked by this.

As old monsters themselves, they naturally knew how frighteningly difficult it was to comprehend supreme intents. They too had been peerless geniuses in their youth.

However, supreme intents were called supreme intents for a reason. Even now, they were barely scratching the surface of their comprehension of supreme intents.

With this revelation, their first conjecture was almost certainly confirmed. It seemed that Ye Xuan’s strength intent had reached a significant level as well, since he was able to fuse it with his fifth-level spatial intent.

“This guy is too mysterious! Is he an expert from the Huangyu Zone or another zone?”

“In any case, I’m pretty certain we don’t have to protect him now. It would take someone stronger than a Heavenly King realm expert to threaten his life.”

“Actually, they can’t even find him. They’ve sent a number of Heavenly King realm experts, but it has all been for naught. Knowing what we know now, I think those experts were pretty lucky. Otherwise, they would have lost their lives.”

“Ye Xuan has at least reached the Saint King realm.”

“Hahaha! Your Divine Gate Holy Land’s vision is indeed sharp. I really admire you guys!”

They continued their discussions for a while longer. Now, Ye Xuan was no longer viewed as a junior, but as someone of equal standing and strength.

At the same time, Ye Xuan’s name also spread among the sea race.

There were countless sea races in the endless ocean. The flood dragons and Yakshas were the most numerous, but there were even stronger ones like the abyssal pythons, demon dragons, and so on.

Of course, there were also weaker races whose bloodline did not allow them to advance to the King realm. These usually ended up being used as cannon fodder by the stronger races in battles.

Currently, the sea race had occupied the majority of the Tianze Zone, with only a few territories holding out because they were guarded by powerful King realm experts.

Unless the sea race sent more King realm experts, the situation would likely remain at a stalemate. Furthermore, the human race’s Saint King realm experts were ready to take action. The amount of territory lost had reached their bottom line.

If the sea race proceeded any further, things would truly take a turn for the worse. The Saint King realm experts began making preparations, and even set up several destructive formations in the remaining territories in the Tianze Zone.

“It seems that it’s basically impossible to completely occupy the Tianze Zone now!”

In the depths of the stormy sea area, the sea race experts were in a serious discussion.

There was a giant flood dragon, as well as a demonic whale that was as big as a mountain!

Next to these two behemoths stood a Yaksha, as well as a merman holding an ice staff.

These four were representatives of the races that were the main forces that invaded the human race’s territory.

However, behind these four great races, there was another race with extremely terrifying strength, the dragon race!

In the endless sea, the dragon race was the most terrifying clan and the true master of the sea race.

Although the dragon race was small in number, they were the absolute rulers of the endless sea and had ruled over the sea race for countless years!

However, there was a rumor on the Tianyuan continent that the current dragon race’s bloodline was not pure, and that they could only be called pseudo-dragons.Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m
