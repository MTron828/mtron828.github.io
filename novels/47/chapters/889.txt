890 Child’s Play

Furthermore, Feng Xiyun was Ye Xuan’s second disciple, not the first. If it lost to her, how was it going to compete with Zhuge Yueyeu?

Filled with anger, the lightning tiger erupted with power, causing its paw to regrow.

Immediately after, the bones in its body crackled as the power of its bloodline was released.

“Oh no! It seems like it’s about to go all out!”

Everyone became quite nervous. The ancient palace had not even opened, yet a deadly battle had already started. It was about to unleash its innate secret technique.

Lu Xiu also became nervous, and looked at Feng Xiyun worriedly. Would she be able to handle this?

Moments later, the lightning tiger’s eyes released dazzling light, and bolts of intense lightning descended, trying to strike Feng Xiyun.

Feng Xiyun, on the other hand, remained calm despite the powerful attack coming her way. The sky trembled, but all she did was wave her hand, and a sphere of fire appeared around her body.

The sphere of fire seemed indestructible, and even seemed to burn the lightning bolts. Feng Xiyun’s lips curled up slightly as she spoke.

“A noble bloodline? Haha, so what? I’ll still beat you up today!”

As soon as she finished speaking, Feng Xiyun slapped the lightning tiger. Her palm was infused with powerful fiery divine runes, which instantly condensed to form a giant palm in the sky.

The power of the Heaven Burning Flames could be felt all over the East Sea, which caused everyone to panic.

“Oh no, retreat quickly!”

The crowd snapped back to reality and quickly fled to a safe distance. The Heaven Burning flames could burn anything and everything, so who would dare to stay close and get burnt?

They had already witnessed the lightning tiger cutting off its own paw moments ago, so they did not want a repeat of that incident to happen to them.

“Oh my god! This is like a fight between gods.”

The battle between the two geniuses had already caused a stir in the world. It had only just begun, but the shockwaves everyone felt left them in disbelief.

How could they compete against these two? Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Boom!

A huge explosion erupted, and the crowd could only stare wide-eyed as the entire East Sea was enveloped in flames.

Feng Xiyun was like a fire sprite in the midst of the flames that filled the sky. As for the lightning tiger? Its situation was not too good.

After exchanging blows with Feng Xiyun, it instantly spat out a few mouthfuls of blood. The flames were everywhere, and despite its best efforts, it had been singed and charred all over its body.

Its originally pristine white fur was now charcoal black, and it had almost lost its life.

At this moment, it really could not accept that it could not even withstand a single attack from Feng Xiyun. How could he be defeated like this?

The more it thought about it, the angrier it became. It looked at Feng Xiyun with killing intent in its eyes. In an instant, it soared into the sky, eyes filled with bloodlust.

After adjusting its condition, it roared, “I have a noble bloodline! The noble bloodline of a lightning tiger!”

“I am invincible! All of you will die today!”

After saying this fiercely, the lightning tiger launched a flurry of attacks.

However, because it had already suffered heavy injuries, these attacks were nothing more than child’s play to Feng Xiyun. She barely even needed to block them.

Everything the lightning tiger did was in vain.

Feng Xiyun turned around and looked at the young man who had just been killed by the lightning tiger. She did not say anything, but her eyes were also filled with killing intent.

This ferocious cat was so inhumane that it would start a massacre for no apparent reason. Since it disregarded the lives of others, it was time to learn the value of its own life.

Her murderous intent even surprised herself. This was the first time she felt this way since she was born.

“Haha! I’ll let you experience what it feels like to be trampled upon!”

As soon as she finished speaking, Feng Xiyun did not hold back. She activated the Heaven Burning Flames, and her figure flickered like a wisp of flame.

Just as the lightning tiger was about to unleash another attack on Feng Xiyun, a flaming palm slapped his head.

Moments later, bright red blood splattered everywhere, and the lightning tiger’s huge body collapsed to the ground.

“This can’t be happening. I will never fall like this…”

Even in this state, the lightning tiger could not accept the outcome. It tried to gather its strength to resist, but it was futile. Its strength had been dispersed. Feng Xiyun had actually destroyed its cultivation.

“Damn it!”

“How dare you!”

The lightning tiger roared hysterically. It really did not expect Feng Xiyun to be so bold.
