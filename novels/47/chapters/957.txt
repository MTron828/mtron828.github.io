958 The Fake Ye Xuan

Now, only the leader of the ghosts. It looked around it, completely dumbfounded. Its ghostly figure was trembling.

“Sh*t… A sealed immortal realm expert!”

At this moment, the ghost was already panicking. It had indeed sensed that Ye Xuan was a powerful expert, but he had mistaken Ye Xuan to only be as powerful as the other two ancient realm experts in the forest.

At most, it would just have to exert more effort in order to deal with him.

However, a sealed immortal realm expert was a whole different ball game!

In the blink of an eye, the tens of thousands of ghosts that had made their way here had been wiped out, indicating just how powerful of an opponent they had encountered this time.

Panicking, the leader of the ghosts immediately turned tail and fled. However, it was a futile struggle.

A huge palm instantly descended from the sky and grabbed it effortlessly.

“Ah… great sealed immortal realm expert, I was indeed rude just now and offended you, so please accept my apology.”

All of its arrogance had disappeared at this point, which had been completely replaced by panic.

However, Ye Xuan was very clear that he could not be merciful when dealing with ghosts. After all, these things were vengeful and malicious. They would turn on him the moment he had his back turned.

“Hehe, you dare to put on an act here? Who do you think you’re trying to fool? Hurry up and tell me the truth. Where are the people who were sent here not long ago?” Ye Xuan asked with a cold expression, and he even released his Heaven Burning Flames.

If this ghost did not answer honestly, he would definitely use the Heaven Burning Flames to burn the entire forest to ashes.

After seeing the Heaven Burning Flames, which were especially deadly against ghosts, its figure trembled with fear.

It did not dare to lie at all, and said, “Great expert, that group of people should be in the forest ahead.”

After obtaining the information, Ye Xuan did not hesitate, and immediately incinerated the ghost into nothingness. The ghost did not expect Ye Xuan to be so ruthless, and used its remaining strength to shout hysterically, “You damn fellow, you actually dared to kill me. You will definitely regret it!” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

As soon as he finished speaking, he disappeared from this world.

Ye Xuan muttered indifferently, “You’re already dead, yet you’re still trying to scare me? What a joke!”

Rage surged in his heart. Ye Xuan glanced at Huangfu Qi, who was so frightened that his body trembled.

He had now truly experienced how cruel Ye Xuan was. He did not want to say anything at all at this point, as he was afraid that he would be implicated.

Even though Ye Xuan looked gentle and refined, he was actually a ruthless character who killed without blinking. One really could not judge a book by its cover.

After figuring out where Ao Lei and the others were. Ye Xuan immediately took action and flew toward the forest ahead.

Sure enough, after advancing for a while, Ye Xuan discovered traces of their presence.

“Senior Brother Gao.”

This voice was suddenly heard within the gloomy forest, which gave Gao Shun a fright. However, when he came back to his senses, he was overjoyed.

“Junior Brother, did you come to find us?”

At this moment, he was extremely excited. Only a moment had passed before he saw Ye Xuan’s figure appear beside him.

However, Gao Shun was only excited for a moment, and he unhesitatingly drew his sword to attack Ye Xuan.

Ye Xuan was extremely surprised when he saw this. He instantly reached out and grabbed his sword as he said angrily, “Damn it! Gao Shun, are you possessed? You actually dared to attack me?”

When Gao Shun saw that his attack was actually easily blocked, he shouted angrily, “Arrogant brat, you’re actually pretending to be my junior brother to fool me? You’re courting death!”

Hearing Gao Shun’s words, it was obvious that similar instances of this must have happened before. Otherwise, he would not be so angry.

During this period of time, he had already killed many ghosts disguised as Ye Xuan. In reality though, he was a little happy.

After all, he definitely could not win against Ye Xuan himself, so he felt a tiny bit of accomplishment defeating these ghosts that were disguised as Ye Xuan.

Ye Xuan also sensed his excitement at this moment and felt a little sheepish. Just how much did this guy want to win against him?

“Hmph! Stop pretending already! It’s useless!”

Gao Shun’s expression was cold as he said these words. He erupted with power, pulling the sword out of Ye Xuan’s hand. Then he unleashed another attack.

In the blink of an eye, a shocking Sword Dao aura was released, as a sword beam came hurtling toward Ye Xuan. Even though this sword beam seemed very slow, it contained the profoundness of the sword hiding its edge. Its true speed was actually terrifying.

However, how could Ye Xuan not know this? After all, his mastery of the Sword Dao far exceeded Gao Shun’s.

“Hey, that’s enough,” Ye Xuan said helplessly.

With a casual wave of his hand, he instantly shattered the sword beam, and even sent Gao Shun flying dozens of meters.

“Heavens!”

Gao Shun fell flat on his face, stunned senseless.

Why was this ghost so powerful? This simply did not make sense.
