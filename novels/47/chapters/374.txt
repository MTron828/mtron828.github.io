375 A Divine-Rank Artifact

The competition between the various chiefs of the Great Wilderness Divine sect was quite intense, so one’s own cultivation level was extremely important.

However, this guy seemed completely unbothered by this.

Seeing that Ye Xuan was unmoved by Yuelun’s beauty, Zhuge Yueyue breathed a sigh of relief.

“Hu!”

‘I knew that Teacher wasn’t that kind of person.’

!!

‘Chief Yuelun is really too evil, trying to seduce Teacher like that. Fortunately, Teacher is a gentleman and was not tempted at all.’

She was also feeling happy.

After all, her teacher had given her the Cloud Sky sword, which was undoubtedly a form of recognition.

However, Zhuge Yueyue was also a little worried.

Now that her teacher had given her the Cloud Sky sword, what magic artifact would he use?

As such, she looked at him in confusion and asked.

“Teacher, now that you’ve given the Cloud Sky sword to me, what magic artifact will you be using?”

When Yuelun heard this, she also looked over curiously.

The Cloud Sky sword was indeed the highest-grade magic artifact on Cloud Sky peak. It was also the artifact that Tian Xuan valued the most when he was alive.

Without the support of the Cloud Sky sword, how could Ye Xuan compete with the other chiefs?

Ye Xuan smiled.

The moment he had given his disciple the sword, the system’s notification had rang out in his head.

“Ding! As the host has given the Cloud Sky sword to his disciple, the host has received a 10,000x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the Cloud Heaven sword (divine artifact)!”

At that time, Ye Xuan had also been quite surprised. He had not expected the reward multipliers to have improved by this much after the system upgrade.

‘I’ve struck it rich! This new system is too awesome!’

At this moment, everyone’s eyes fell on Ye Xuan, waiting for the latter’s response.

“It’s just a magic artifact. I’ll just take out another one and use it instead.”

As soon as he finished speaking, the Cloud Heaven sword suddenly appeared in Ye Xuan’s hand, exuding immortal spiritual power. The terrifying sword intent contained within the sword soared into the sky, which made everyone’s heart palpitate, and they found it difficult to breathe.

“What?”

Yuelun stood up in shock.

A divine-rank artifact?

How could this guy have a magic artifact that surpassed the heaven rank?

Moreover, from its appearance, it seemed to be a top-grade divine-rank artifact!

Oh my God! How many more things was this guy hiding?

Yuelun was stunned.

Ye Xuan, whom she had looked down upon, was not only extremely strong, but also had a divine-rank artifact.

Was this really the same piece of trash that had joined the Great Wilderness Divine sect a hundred years ago?

Over the past hundred years, there had been countless people who criticized Ye Xuan, but he had never said a word in response.

Just this temperament alone was enough to make Yuelun admire him.

It was no wonder Chief Tian Xuan had chosen him as the successor of Cloud Sky peak.

Yuelun had also heard about Ye Xuan’s background. It seemed that he had ascended from a lower plane.

The mysterious world was a middle plane, so it naturally had countless ascendance shrines connected to lower planes.

However, most of the geniuses from the lower planes basically disappeared after ascending to the mystic world.

After all, compared to the cultivators who had ascended, the people born and raised in the mystic world had a much higher chance of possessing divine bones.

Of course, once a person who ascended awakened a divine bone, their advantage in cultivation would definitely far exceed that of the people of the mystic world. However, the number of people who successfully awakened a divine bone was few and far between.

Could it be that Ye Xuan was one of them?

However, what infuriated Yuelun the most was that he had called the divine-rank artifact, “just another artifact”.

Did he have to act so pretentiously?

A divine-rank magic artifact was a rare treasure even among the ancient holy lands and ancient clans.

She felt like cursing.

Zhuge Yueyue and Li Xue’er also jumped up in surprise when they learned that the sword in Ye Xuan’s hand was a divine-rank artifact. Their eyes were as wide as saucers.

‘Oh my God, a divine-rank artifact? It is said that if the full power of a divine-rank artifact is unleashed, it can kill even a sealed immortal rank cultivator!’

‘How could he have such a thing?’

Li Xue’er could not believe it.

Although Zhuge Yueyue was also shocked, she was happy to see her teacher in possession of a power magic artifact. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Wow! Is this what a divine-rank artifact looks like? Teacher, can I take a look at it?”

Zhuge Yueyue asked with curiosity.

“Here you go! If you like it, you can take it and play with it for a few days,” Ye Xuan said lightly, without the slightest hint of reluctance.

After all, she was his precious disciple. What was a mere divine-rank artifact in comparison.

Zhuge Yueyue took it excitedly. When she sensed the terrifying sword intent in the Cloud Heaven sword, her eyes were filled with shock.

The sword intent it exuded was enough to crush a mystic lord realm cultivator.
