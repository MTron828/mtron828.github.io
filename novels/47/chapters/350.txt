351 Just A Mere Ant

“He’s a great emperor realm expert?!”

“How is this possible?”

When Jun Xuantian saw this, his eyes were filled with shock. He of all people should have known Ye Xuan’s strength best.

When Jun Lingtian had reported Ye Xuan’s matter to him, he had only felt that Ye Xuan’s talent was rather monstrous and was worthy of the Divine Gate Holy Land’s attention. That was why he had acted to stop those King realm experts who were interested in the Tower of Heaven, and gave him those two jade tokens to ensure his safety.

However, he also gave the same level of treatment to other geniuses that he deemed had potential.

Never in his wildest dreams had he expected one of those geniuses, within the span of a few years, to even exceed his own cultivation level.

However, he was inwardly thankful that his assistance had earned the Divine Gate Holy Land favor with Ye Xuan.

This was a great emperor realm expert they were talking about!

The pinnacle level of cultivation within the Tianyuan continent!

Jun Xuantian’s heart was filled with complicated feelings. This revelation was simply too shocking.

Hundreds of thousands of miles away from the center of the battlefield, Jun Lingtian and Zhao Yuzhen also sensed the terrifying power. They looked at each other and saw the surprise and shock in each other’s eyes.

Who would have thought that Jun Lingtian’s outrageous guess was actually right!

As expected, Ye Xuan’s strength couldn’t be measured with common sense.

Everything surrounding that person was simply miraculous!

“A human great emperor realm expert is interfering in the war between the two races. Do you humans want to fight a decisive battle with us?”

At this moment, a deafening voice suddenly rang out.

This was the roar of a sea race Saint King realm expert.

Ye Xuan was able to kill a Saint King in seconds, so his strength had undoubtedly reached the great emperor realm. The other party had once again interfered in the war between the two races, which undoubtedly broke the rules.

Although it was only a jade token, it still contained the unparalleled power of a great emperor realm expert.

“A mere ant dares to order me around?”

Ye Xuan looked at the Sea race Saint King realm expert expressionlessly and pointed his finger at him.

A terrifying destructive force suddenly descended, instantly enveloping the expert with destruction intent.

“What are you doing?”

The Saint King realm expert looked at Ye Xuan in horror.

He had never expected that Ye Xuan would still dare to attack him.

Was this fellow really not afraid of a complete fallout between the two races?

Was he not afraid of destroying the Tianyuan continent?

“I’ll kill you,” Ye Xuan said lightly.

His body had already been engraved with five supreme intents, and his strength was far beyond that of ordinary great emperor realm experts.

Even the power stored within this phantom figure was enough to deal with this. After all, with the power of life intent and his tempered spiritual sense, the phantom figure could store more of his power.

The Saint King realm expert’s expression changed drastically upon hearing this.

However, when he tried to flee, he discovered that an invisible force had imprisoned him.

“Human great emperor, do you really want to start an all-out war with my race?”

“We advise you to think about it carefully. Don’t let your impulsiveness cause a great calamity!”

The sea race Saint King realm experts were incredulous.

They had not expected Ye Xuan to dare to act.

Was he going to try and clear the battlefield like how he did before with the Human King realm experts?

Was he really going to risk an all-out war, and the potential destruction of the Tianyuan continent?

In the past few years, the war had wreaked havoc on the Southern Territory, and countless human cultivators and ordinary people had died.

However, in the eyes of the great emperors, the Tian Yuan continent was so vast that it would be fine even if the sea race took over the Huangyu Zone.

After all, even within the Southern Territory, there were still hundreds of zones.

As long as the war between the two races did not engulf more than two major territories, it would not threaten the foundation of the human race.

However, Ye Xuan could not be bothered to care about what those great emperors thought.

Moments later, Ye Xuan slowly stretched out his palm and made a slapping motion.

Then, under the horrified gazes of many sea race experts, the Saint King realm expert who had spoken just now was reduced to dust, his body and soul vanishing into thin air.Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m
