557 The Great Battle (Part 3)

The enmity between the two sects could no longer be resolved. Almost all of the disciples had already started fighting.

Watching the battle between the two sects, the onlookers nearby consciously retreated into the distance to avoid being caught in the crossfire.

Zhuge Yueyue held her sword in her hand. She turned around and looked at Feng Xiyun and said, “Xiyun, be careful. Don’t stray too far away from me.”

Feng Xiyun agreed readily and followed Zhuge Yueyue as they charged into the crowd.

The outcome of this battle was a matter regarding the dignity and standing of the two sects, so there would definitely be no one who would admit defeat.

There were already grudges between them, and constant fights between the two sects had broken up in the ancient tomb. The attempt to snatch Zhuge Yueyue’s sword was the straw that broke the camel’s back.

The seeds of hatred between the two sides could no longer be suppressed.

Despite the battle having only just started, the Great Wilderness Divine sect was already pushing the Immortal Divine sect back.

After all, the great wilderness divine cult had several peak-level mystic lord realm experts, and even their top disciples were stronger than those from the other side.

As such, the Immortal Divine sect was on the losing end.

Looking at this, Mo Xuan Guan could no longer see any hope. He had never expected to see his sect one-sidedly defeated like this.

However, right at this moment, an old man in a black robe appeared in midair, sending Gao Shun flying with one punch.

Seeing this, everyone’s jaws dropped.

Taking a closer look, the black-robed old man was releasing a thick black mist, which looked extremely terrifying.

“It’s actually Elder Taiyin!”

Yuelun’s face paled, and her face was filled with disbelief.

Was Elder Taiyin not dead? Had he not been killed by Ye Xuan back then?

Not only that, he had clearly broken through to the early stage of the supreme realm!

“Heavens, is this for real? Shouldn’t he already be dead? Why is he still alive and well?”

Yuelun’s voice trembled as she spoke in disbelief.

At this time, Gao Shun was in a miserable state. After suffering Elder Taiyin’s sneak attack, he spat out several mouthfuls of fresh blood. The pride he had from earlier had long disappeared without a trace.

At this moment, the chiefs of the Great Wilderness Divine sect all turned pale.

If Elder Taiyin had not reached the supreme realm, they would still have the ability to fight him. However, things had taken a drastic turn now.

Elder Taiyin had broken through to the supreme realm, and they did not have the power to fight back.

“Hehe, congratulations on breaking through to the supreme realm, Senior Brother!”

Mo Xuan Guan looked at Elder Taiyin with a face full of joy.

Originally, he had thought that the Immortal Divine sect would lose this time and forfeit their dignity. Thankfully, the heavens had answered his prayers.

His Senior Brother was still alive!

At this moment, Elder Taiyin looked at many people of his own sect with an extremely cold expression.

Under the influence of this strange power, he could only maintain a tiny strand of consciousness.

“Useless bunch. Stand back and watch carefully,” Elder Taiyin said coldly.

Then, he flew out of the group and looked at the forces of the Great Wilderness Divine sect with killing intent.

Gao Shun finally caught his breath at this time. Yuelun asked very worriedly, “Senior Brother, how do you feel?”

Gao Shun shook his head and took a deep breath before saying, “It’s not a big deal. However, Elder Taiyin’s combat strength has increased significantly. If this situation continues, we will lose for sure.”

“In a while, I’ll see if I can hold him back. While I do that, you guys take the disciples and leave this place.”

“No, how could we do that? That would be akin to leaving you here to die!”

The chiefs of the Great Wilderness Divine sect rejected Gao Shun’s suggestion without hesitation. After all, they were not people who would easily abandon their companions.

At this moment, the disciples of the Great Wilderness Divine sect were so touched that they were speechless. So Martial Uncle Gao Shun, who they had always disliked, could also be so heroic and righteous.

Gao Shun still said resolutely and decisively, “Do as I say!”

“Using my life to save all of yours is a worthwhile deal.”

“These disciples are the future of our Great Wilderness Divine sect. As long as they are alive, they will definitely be able to avenge me in the future! Don’t waste any more time, leave quickly!”

After hearing this, the disciples did not know what to say.

All along, it turned out that Gao Shun had attached such importance to them.

“I’ll stay here and help you,” Yuelun said with a heavy expression.

“With the two of us working together, we can at least stall him for a little more time. This will increase our chances of survival.”

“There’s no need for that. You guys better leave quickly. Don’t hold me back,” Gao Shun answered resolutely and decisively. He started to circulate his forbidden secret technique.

Yuelun sensed what he was doing at this time, but she did not say anything.

After all, she was very clear that once he had decided on this, no one would be able to change his mind.

Using this forbidden secret technique had terrible repercussions. He might even be unable to break through ever again.

However, under the effect of this secret technique, his strength could also be raised to the supreme realm. That being said, it would not be enough to defeat Elder Taiyin, merely hold him back.

Moments later. Elder Taiyin’s gaze shifted to Zhuge Yueyue as he questioned her with an extremely cold expression, “If I’m not wrong, you’re Ye Xuan’s first disciple, right?”

Elder Taiyin’s eyes were filled with a brutal aura as he stared at Zhuge Yueyue. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

When he saw Ye Xuan’s disciple, Elder Taiyin once again recalled what Ye Xuan had done to him, and his killing intent skyrocketed.

Under the influence of the strange power, Elder Taiyin’s consciousness had begun to become fuzzy, and was gradually replaced by killing intent.

...

Sensing this, Zhuge Yueyue’s body trembled uncontrollably, her face pale and weak.

However, she still did not back down. After all, she was Ye Xuan’s disciple.

“That’s right! I’m Ye Xuan’s first disciple!”
