Hearing this question, Ye Xuan replied tongue-in-cheek, “Oh? It’s not that difficult. As long as you have hands, you can easily do it too, right?”

This stunned Gao Shun.

“Uh… Easy?”

He could only roll his eyes at Ye Xuan helplessly, not knowing what to say. Although it was a momentous achievement, perhaps from Ye Xuan’s perspective, it might really be an easy matter.

The only problem was this would not be the same for anyone else. In the end, it could only be said that comparisons with Ye Xuan would only cause more grief.

“Hehehe.’

Seeing Gao Shun’s helpless expression, Ao Lei laughed out loud. He then returned to the main topic and asked, “Oh right. Junior Brother Ye, let’s talk about serious matters first. Have you thought of a way to break this seal?”

Despite the good news about Ye Xuan’s breakthrough, the main issue had not been resolved. If they failed to break this seal, they would really be trapped in this cave forever.

Would Ye Xuan’s breakthrough change the situation? It was difficult to say. After all, it was likely that Gongsun Ming had created this seal with Ye Xuan specifically in mind.

“Haha, how difficult can it be?”

Ye Xuan smiled lightly. Then, he stretched out his hand and mobilized his spiritual power, causing a huge commotion to sweep the surroundings. “My goodness, is he trying to break the seal by force?”

Everyone was taken aback. However, from what they could tell, Ye Xuan was indeed doing just that!

Moments later, a loud rumbling sound rang out, causing the entire forest to tremble.

Elsewhere, Gongsun Ming, who was in the treasury, vaguely sensed that something was wrong with the seal he had set up.

“This is strange. Could it be that the seal I specially prepared was removed by someone?”

While hovering in the air, Gongsun Ming set up another formation, sealing the space in front of him. However, the bad feeling in his heart intensified.

After a while, he denied the possibility. The seal that he had so painstakingly created would not be so easily broken. Even if he were to break it himself, it would take some effort.

“Hehe, 1 don’t think they’ll be able to break my seal.”

After saying that, Gongsun Ming threw the matter to the back of his mind and stared at the crescent moon in the sky again.

“Ye Xuan, just wait and see! As soon as 1 break through to the eternal realm, you’ll be the first one I’ll deal with!”

“Your sect actually dared to destroy the Immortal Divine sect in the East continent and damage our fate power. There’s no way I’m going to let this go easily!FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“I’ll kill everyone in the Great Wilderness Divine sect, down to the last critter and insect!”

After saying those words with a cold expression, Gongsun Ming concentrated on his breakthrough, trying to break through to the eternal realm.

Elsewhere, Yanran had already arrived at a cave abode that was emitting an ice-cold aura, and had begun to cultivate in seclusion.

However, while she was cultivating, she suddenly opened her eyes and muttered, “Great Wilderness…

At this moment, Yanran had a strange feeling in her heart, seemingly warning her. Her instinct was telling her not to break through yet. Over the past few days, this feeling had become more and more obvious.

She could tell that something big was about to happen, but she could not figure out what it was. Every time she entered a state of cultivation, the two words ‘Great Wilderness’ would involuntarily appear in her mind, interrupting her.

“What exactly is going on?”

“Could it be that the Great Wilderness Divine sect is going to face a calamity? Or is there another reason?”

At this moment, she could not understand what was going on no matter how much she thought about it. She could only sit cross-legged in the icy cave abode quietly, enduring the baptism of the icy aura and continuously tempering her physique.

She was only a step away from the eternal realm…

“Ye Xuan, where are you?”

Yanran took out the purple wind chime that Ye Xuan gave her and tried to contact him. However, there was no reply from him at all. The bad feeling in her heart became even stronger.

She did not know where Ye Xuan had gone. Ever since the treasury opened, she had seen no sign of him. Even Feng Xiyun and Zhuge Yueyue did not know where he had gone.

Honestly, she really wanted to immediately set off to find Ye Xuan. However, after thinking about it carefully, she felt that breaking through was the most important thing to do at the moment. which was why she was in seclusion here.

Unfortunately, every time she tried to break through, something would stop her.

As for the other cultivators, they were all eyeing a medicinal pill that was emitting a golden light that had appeared in the sky, and were in a stand-off.

Up until now, no one had dared to make the first move. After all, it was likely that the first person to make a move would be mobbed by the other experts. The only outcome for such a situation was death.

Therefore, no one dared to take the risk, and the atmosphere at the scene was tense and solemn.

“Everyone, we definitely can’t go on like this. Why don’t I make a suggestion?”

“Those who made it here are all famous geniuses. Every one of us is powerful. There’s no doubt about this.’

“Moreover, we each believe ourselves better than the others. In that case, why don’t we decide this by way of a competition? Whoever makes it to the end will get this pill. What do you think?”

After Hou Yi, who had a human body and a deer head, made this suggestion, it received the approval of many of the experts present..
