Chapter 263: Ninth-Level Sword Intent

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Under normal circumstances, it would take most cultivators hundreds of tears to comprehend a sixth-level martial intent, which was the prerequisite for engraving a profound pattern on one’s body.

Therefore, for most cultivators, this was a long process of accumulation.

For example, if Ye Xuan did not assist her, Yue would take at least 700 years to break through to the same realm as Guang Liang.

However, with a teacher like Ye Xuan, the situation would be greatly different.

Ye Xuan’s first experimental subject was Yue.

When he helped Yue to awaken her sword jade body, this girl had comprehended first-level sword intent.

What Ye Xuan had to do now was to help Yue refine the spiritual items that could provide her with an epiphany experience.

After all, if Yue was not in a state of epiphany, even if Ye Xuan personally displayed his sword intent, she would have to spend at least several years to comprehend it and achieve a breakthrough.

“Yue, I will now display my sword intent. Learn as much as you can,” Ye Xuan looked at Yue and said.

“Alright, Teacher!”

Yue nodded obediently.

“Yan’er, Qingyan, you two have to watch carefully. It would be best if you can gain some enlightenment!”

“We will heed Teacher’s words!”

The two of them nodded obediently.

Ye Xuan motioned to Yue to take out the dreamland grass, which was something he had obtained after giving Yue the withered leaf bodhi he had obtained from killing Qian Daoliu.

It would allow Yue to enter a state of epiphany for two days.

It was also because he had given the Dreamland grass to Yue that he had received the Paramita flower from the system.

In addition, after dealing with the three major forces’ elders, he had obtained many heavenly treasures that could increase one’s comprehension value.

Despite the fact that the cooldown period had yet to end, Ye Xuan had given them to his disciples.

After all, he could not be stingy while he was experimenting..

Then, with Ye Xuan’s help, Yue began to refine the dreamland grass.

“Discard all distracting thoughts and pay attention to the sword intent I will show you!”

Ye Xuan’s voice rang out in Yue’s mind.

Under the effect of the dreamland grass, Yue had already entered a state of epiphany, and was fully focused on Ye Xuan and his longsword.

One man and one sword, one with the sword!

After that, Ye Xuan used his longsword to perform basic sword techniques.

Although these sword techniques were simple and unrefined, they gave off the feeling that they were infused with the natural laws of the world and could not be dodged.

Ye Xuan was just standing there, but he was like the incarnation of Sword Dao.

Countless insights flooded Yue’s mind, and she lost track of time. Her sword intent was rapidly getting stronger.

First-level sword intent!

Second-level sword intent!

Third-level sword intent!

Fourth-level sword intent!

By the end of the state of epiphany, Yue’s sword intent had reached the fourth level!

Shocking!

However, it was somewhat expected. After all, Ye Xuan had comprehended eighth-level sword intent, so he could display the appropriate aspects of sword intent to Yue according to her needs. He would only show her what she needed, step-by-step, never exceeding her level of comprehension.

In addition, Yue possessed the sword jade body, which further augmented her comprehension efforts. Even Li Qingyan and Zhao Yuyan would not be able to accomplish this.

Li Qingyan was more suited for the wood and fire-type martial intents, while Zhao Yuyan’s special constitution contained devouring intent, which was on the same level as the creation intent, which was extremely powerful.

If Zhao Yuyan could comprehend the devouring intent, augmented by the Demon Devourer body, she would be able to devour realms, and perhaps even worlds.

However, Ye Xuan himself had not comprehended devouring intent, so he had no way of helping Zhao Yuyan in this regard.

“Ding! The host has helped his disciple comprehend fourth-level sword intent and received a randomized 1008x critical reward. Congratulations. The host has comprehended ninth-level sword intent!”

Buzzzzzz!

As soon as the system’s notification ended, the world around them trembled.

Terrifying sword intent permeated the air and swept out in all directions.

Wherever the sword intent passed, everything trembled and submitted to it. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Even Yue’s sword intent was affected and seemed to submit to him, which amazed her.

Li Qingyan and Zhao Yuyan felt the same way.

Further away, the cultivators of the Qingyun sect were shocked and dumbfounded.
