624 Are You Going To Cook Me?

Zhuge Yueyue came over at this time and said helplessly, “Teacher, I’ve tried my best, but Third Sister is really struggling with this. Every time I turn around, she runs away from her lessons.”

Seeing Zhuge Yueyue’s helpless expression, Ye Xuan did not know what to do.

After a moment, Ye Xuan realized that Feng Xiyun was missing, so he asked, “Where did Xiyun go?”

Xiang Yun piped up happily, “Teacher, Big Sister Xiyun also entered secluded cultivation like you. It seems like forever since I last saw her… I wonder if she fell asleep as well.”

!!

As soon as she heard those words, Zhuge Yueyue smacked her on the head, which left her aggrieved.

‘Did I say something wrong?’

‘Why did big sister beat me up?’

“Teacher, Xiyun sensed an opportunity to break through, so she entered secluded cultivation. If everything goes well, she should break through to the void realm soon,” Zhuge Yueyue said.

Ye Xuan nodded in acknowledgment. Feng Xiyun had reached the peak of the materialization realm some time ago, so this was to be expected.

Thinking this, Ye Xuan turned to look at Zhuge Yueyue and said, “Yueyue, you’ve worked hard during this period of time. You should make the best use of your time to cultivate as well.”

“The gathering is coming soon, so just let me take care of Yun’er. You don’t have to worry about this matter.”

Hearing this, Zhuge Yueyue felt relieved. She had indeed wanted to focus on her cultivation, but because she was worried that Xiang Yun would cause trouble, she had refrained from entering secluded cultivation.

“Alright, Teacher. I’ll go and cultivate in seclusion.”

Then, she turned to Xiang Yun and said, “Third Sister, don’t be so naughty. You have to listen to your teacher and train seriously, understand?”

Xiang Yun just nodded out of courtesy. Who knew what ran through that small brain of hers.

Just as Zhuge Yueyue was about to turn around and leave, she recalled something and quickly said, “Teacher, I almost forgot. Han Sikong came by earlier and delivered the herbs you requested.”

She took out a storage pouch and handed it to Ye Xuan.

“The money from the auction is also included here. The cost to purchase the herbs has already been deducted from the total sum.”

Ye Xuan felt excited. After such a long time, the medicinal herbs that he had been waiting for had finally arrived.

Holding the storage pouch, Ye Xuan counted the amount of gold inside with his spiritual sense. There was almost 200 million taels of profound gold inside, which was a terrifying sum.

If he gave this sum away to his disciples, how much would he earn in return?

He would become a tycoon in the mystic world!

Haha, this feeling was awesome!

Ye Xuan then counted the herbs, after which he smiled.

“With the help of these medicinal herbs, things are going much smoother.”

Ye Xuan looked at Xiang Yun and became very excited. It was time to help this little girl refine her body.

Originally, Ye Xuan wanted to use these herbs to teach his disciples alchemy, but he had not expected to take in a new disciple who was this young.

As such, he had now decided to use these medicinal herbs on her instead.

In any case, he would be able to obtain rewards from the system through this process as well. He made his way to the garden and took out the Boundless Cauldron from his storage space.

After carefully picking out a few herbs, Ye Xuan placed them into the Boundless Cauldron one by one according to a certain order.

After adding a certain amount of spiritual liquid into the mix, Ye Xuan used his spiritual power to close the lid. The temperature within the cauldron rose significantly as Ye Xuan infused it with his spiritual power. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Zhuge Yueyue was watching all this happen with a confused look on her face. She did not understand what her teacher was up to.

However, when she turned around, she spotted Xiang Yun trying to escape, and quickly grabbed her and brought her over to Ye Xuan.

As Ye Xuan regulated the infusion of spiritual power into the Boundless Cauldron, the medicinal herbs within it began to be refined and merged within the spiritual liquid.

The sight of the boiling spiritual liquid sloshing around was a little scary, and Xiang Yun’s face had already turned pale.

Ye Xuan then said without thinking, “Yun’er, you can get in now.”

“Ah?”

Xiang Yun was dumbfounded, and bean-sized beads of sweat dripped down her face.

“Teacher, I’m sorry. I’ll listen to you from now on and won’t be naughty anymore. Please don’t cook me and eat me, okay?”

She was already scared out of her wits and hugged Ye Xuan and cried, looking very pitiful.

Ye Xuan was amused by this. This little girl actually knew the meaning of the word fear?

He then said nonchalantly, “Don’t you want to be invincible among your peers? This concoction will make you stronger. I’m not going to cook and eat you.”

“You just need to sit inside and let the medicinal power of the herbs and spiritual liquid refine your body. After this, you’ll definitely become stronger.”

After hearing this, Xiang Yun wiped her tears away, but still asked warily, “Teacher, are you sure you’re not lying to me?”

“Of course not. I never lie,” Ye Xuan said with a smile..

“Today, I’m going to teach you a body refining technique that’s quite special. If you can cultivate it to the point of mastery, you’ll be invincible among your peers.”

“How about it? If…”

Without waiting for Ye Xuan to finish, Xiang Yun immediately dove into the Boundless Cauldron, after which a squealing voice was heard.

“Owwww! It’s burning me to death…”

Ye Xuan was dumbfounded.

Was she really dead-set on becoming invincible among her peers?

She dove right in without thinking twice…
