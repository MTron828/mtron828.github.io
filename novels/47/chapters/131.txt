Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Seeing this, Ye Xuan reached out his hand indifferently. A longsword suddenly appeared in his hand, after which he casually slashed out!

Clang!

The deafening sound of weapons colliding rang out. Sparks burst out, and then ripples of energy spread out.

“This?”

When the old man saw this, he trembled.

How could the other party coincidentally cancel out his attack again?

This was very wrong!

An ominous premonition suddenly rose in the old man’s heart.

The young man opposite him had an extremely relaxed expression.

Did this not mean that his strength far surpassed his own?

Immediately, the old man hurriedly put away his ax and retreated frantically. At the same time, he wanted to take this opportunity to grab the Buddha Spirit Fruit and flee.

Even though he wanted to escape, he could not pass up the chance to obtain such a precious treasure.

However, would Ye Xuan let him do that?

Well, the answer to that was obviously no.

Ye Xuan raised his longsword, and an incomparably violent sword qi hurricane suddenly swept toward the old man.

“What?”

Seeing this, the old man’s facial expression changed, and he hurriedly crushed a protective jade token.

This jade token possessed the power to defend against the attack of a half-step unity realm expert.

Buzz!

The jade token formed a tough energy barrier around him. Then, the old man charged toward the Buddha Spirit fruit.

At the same time, another jade token appeared in the old man’s hand. This was a speed-boosting jade token.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan’s eyes turned cold. The terrifying sword qi hurricane accelerated and ruthlessly slammed into the old man’s energy barrier.

Sensing the terrifying power of the sword qi hurricane, the old man hurriedly crushed the speed-boosting jade token in his hand.

Following that, a cracking sound was heard.

The energy barrier suddenly shattered. The sword qi hurricane engulfed the old man’s body instantly. Wounds so deep that bone could be seen appeared on the old man’s body.

Although the old man had avoided most of the damage thanks to the speed-boosting jade token, he was still affected by the shockwaves.

Ye Xuan’s sword qi raged wildly in the old man’s meridians. As Ye Xuan snapped his fingers lightly, the power of the sword qi in the old man’s body split him into two!

The sword qi hurricane just now had contained only a little more power than a half-step unity realm expert’s attack. It was just enough to kill the old man without affecting the Buddha Spirit fruit.

If this person had chosen to run away decisively, Ye Xuan would not have bothered with him. Unfortunately, he was a greedy person, which caused his death.

Then, Ye Xuan put away the longsword in his hand. He took a step forward and was about to reach for the golden fruit.

Suddenly, a voice rang out.

“Almsgiver, that golden fruit is fated with Buddhism, so it should belong to this penniless monk!”

At the same time, an incomparably vast and terrifying pressure swept over.

It was a unity realm expert!

Seeing this, Ye Xuan frowned.

As expected, he still encountered a unity realm expert from the Nanzhou Region in the end.

However, Ye Xuan did not stop moving. Instead, he flashed forward and his palm instantly landed on the Buddha Spirit fruit.

As his palm and the Buddha Spirit fruit came into contact, Ye Xuan suddenly sensed extremely mysterious Buddhist chants slowly ringing out in his mind.

After taking the Buddha Spirit fruit, Ye Xuan calmly raised his head, and he stared into the sky.

Several dozen meters away, the space was brightened up by resplendent Buddhist light. Following that, a monk wearing a kasaya and holding a string of Buddhist beads appeared.

Seeing this, a cold smile hung on the corners of Ye Xuan’s mouth.

This monk was quite good at posturing. The Buddhist light that filled the sky caused his body to glow and look holy. If an ordinary person witnessed this, they would undoubtedly believe that Buddha himself had descended.

The terrifying pressure of the unity realm expert swept out, no doubt warning and threatening Ye Xuan.

There were indeed Buddhist sects in the Tian Yuan continent, and Buddhist cultivators were pretty much the same as ordinary cultivators.

Of course, there were specific titles for the division of realms in Buddhist sects, such as the Venerable Vajra and Arhat.

However, Ye Xuan did not know much about Buddhism. After all, there were no Buddhist sects in the Great Qian Dynasty.

Actually, there were not many Buddhist sects in the Nanzhou Region either.

He did not know which Buddhist sect this monk came from.

“Almsgiver, that Buddha Spirit fruit is fated with Buddhism. This penniless monk felt its call from afar. Almsgiver, can you part with it?” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The monk slowly turned the Buddhist beads in his hand while his other hand made an Amitabha gesture as he spoke slowly.

Even so, the monk’s gaze was fixed on the Buddha Spirit fruit in Ye Xuan’s hand. A hint of concealed greed flashed through his eyes.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan’s lips curled into a cold smile as he continued speaking indifferently.

“This Buddha Spirit fruit is mine to begin with. Just because you say it’s fated doesn’t mean that it’s yours.”

The monk was clearly greedy. The so-called fate with Buddhism was just his excuse.

This monk was so shameless.

“Don’t misunderstand, almsgiver. That Buddha Spirit fruit contains Buddhist chants. It resonates with our path of cultivation. Naturally, it’s fated with our Buddhism!”

“This penniless monk had already sensed it when I was outside the Moon Demon mystic realm. As soon as I entered the mystic realm, I followed the calling in my heart and rushed over from afar!”

“This penniless monk is fated with the Buddha Spirit Fruit. This is also a predestined karma. I hope that almsgiver can part with it!”

As he spoke, the monk’s gaze was still fixed on the Buddha Spirit fruit in Ye Xuan’s hand. His eyes did not leave it for even half a second.

Not only could the Buddha Spirit fruit increase a cultivator’s comprehension value, but after consuming it, one would also experience an epiphany. It could be said to be an extremely precious heavenly treasure!

“Oh? Then I feel that the Buddhist beads in master’s hands are fated with me. I wonder if you can part with it?”

Ye Xuan looked at the monk indifferently.

He could naturally see that the monk’s Buddhist beads were extraordinary.
