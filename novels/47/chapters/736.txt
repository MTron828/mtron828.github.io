737 Breakthrough!

Seeing more and more cracks appear on the realm barrier, Ye Xuan grew more and more excited.

Boom!

With a loud bang, Cloud Sky peak began to shake violently. Thick dark clouds began to gather above the Cloud Sky peak.

“This… What exactly happened?”

After sensing the commotion, everyone looked toward Cloud Sky peak in unison.

“Could it be that Junior Brother Ye actually succeeded?”

In the sky above the main peak, Ao Lei’s attention was fully focused on Cloud Sky peak. Next to him, Gao Shun also had a look of admiration on his face.

No one had expected that the first person in the history of the Great Wilderness Divine sect to reach the ancient realm would be Ye Xuan, who had been looked down upon for countless years.

“It’s really unimaginable. It’s a miracle.”

“Hahaha! Not bad, not bad. Our sect will definitely be able to survive this time!”

Ao Lei suddenly laughed out loud. The weight on his heart had finally been lifted. With an ancient realm expert guarding the sect, their chances of dealing with the impending crisis had gone through the roof.

“Junior Brother Gao, hurry up and make preparations. The recruitment of disciples will begin in 15 days. The heavens have not forsake our Great Wilderness Divine sect!”

“If we play our cards right, we can seize this opportunity to restore the glory of the Great Wilderness Divine sect!”

Gao Shun was similarly excited at this time.

“Senior Brother Ao, leave this matter to me. I will go and make the preparations now.”

Ye Xuan’s breakthrough was like the sun shining through on a cloudy day. The mood of the entire sect was lifted.

Within a few hours, news of Ye Xuan breaking through to the ancient realm spread throughout the sect.

…

At that moment, Zhuge Yueyue, Feng Xiyun and the others who were in the Cloud Sky Hall sensed the tremors on Cloud Sky peak and immediately stood up.

When they exited the Cloud Sky Palace and saw the black clouds rolling in the sky and the sound of thunder, they frowned.

“First Sister, such a huge phenomenon is happening at the rear of the mountain. Could it be that Teacher…”

Before Feng Xingyun could finish her words, Zhuge Yueyue rushed to the rear of the mountain without hesitation. Seeing this, Feng Xiyun grabbed Xiang Yun’s hand and quickly followed.

Even though they were not close, they still felt suffocated when they approached the Cloud Sky Cave.

“Could it be that Teacher is really going to break through?”

Zhuge Yueyue said in a daze.

At this moment, the strange phenomenon on Cloud Sky peak was visible from the sect’s entrance.

After seeing the dense black clouds in the sky, everyone felt a great pressure and could not help but hold their breaths.

“Hurry up and take a look!” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Outside the Great Wilderness Divine sect, a man said in shock, causing everyone to look in the direction he pointed at.

Ye Xuan’s illusory figure slowly floated in the sky, his entire body emitting a faint light. He looked like a divine celestial, giving off an extremely oppressive feeling.

“Oh my god, could this be the ancient realm that only exists in legends?”

“According to the legends, only an expert who has broken through to the ancient realm can cause such a phenomenon…”

“Every expert who has broken through to the Ancient One Realm has a mark on their forehead. This mark symbolizes the recognition of the world, as well as their powerful strength.”

At this moment, people started discussing intensely. After seeing Ye Xuan’s illusory figure, there were even some who felt like kneeling down. This was due to an innate reverence for the strong.

After the layers of dark clouds in the sky cleared, they could finally see Ye Xuan’s illusory figure clearly.

“It really is Ye Xuan! ”

After this abnormal phenomenon appeared, more and more people rushed over. At this moment, in a secret chamber on the main peak, even Daoist Yi Feng awakened from his seclusion.

“Ancient realm! This kid actually reached the ancient realm?”
