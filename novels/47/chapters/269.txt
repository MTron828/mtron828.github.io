Chapter 270: Do You Want It?

This sword strike, imbued with the power of heavenly lightning, tore through the endless spatial turbulence.

Buzzzzzz!

The black giant’s body was suddenly split in half.

The terrifying power of heavenly lightning wreaked havoc on its body, preventing it from healing itself.

Roar!

The black giant roared as a strange dark power gushed out of its wound, instantly dispelling the destructive sword qi and the power of heavenly lightning.

Then, its body reformed and became whole again, and it smashed its fist in Ye Xuan’s direction once more.

Clang!

Unfortunately, it could do nothing to the Tower of Heaven. The black giant’s eyes were filled with monstrous anger as it madly swung its fists at the Tower of Heaven.

Clang! Clang! Clang!

The black giant’s fists smashed against the Tower of Heaven like a lunatic.

However, Ye Xuan did not plan on dealing with the black giant immediately.

After all, there were precious martial intents to be comprehended. How could he miss this opportunity?

Buzzzzzz!

At the same time, Shangguan Wan’er killed all of the demonic beasts on her side.

After doing all this, Shangguan Wan’er’s gaze turned to Ye Xuan again.

However, Shangguan Wan’er’s thoughts were exactly the same as Ye Xuan’s. She planned to use the black giant to comprehend martial intents. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Ye Xuan saw Shangguan Wan’er’s actions and was speechless.

This woman! She was planning on using him as a tool!

‘I’m not going to fight for free and for someone else’s benefit. There’s no such thing as a free lunch.’

“Suppress!”

Ye Xuan’s eyes flashed with brilliant divine light, and the Tower of Heaven in front of him suddenly expanded countless times. Its vast spatial intent completely enveloped the black giant, pulling it into the Tower of Heaven amidst its deafening roars.

Soon, it shrank rapidly and was trapped in the Tower of Heaven.

Inside the Tower of Heaven, the black giant exploded with violent power, trying to tear space apart.

Unfortunately, it was useless.

Unless the black giant had a power that surpassed that ancient almighty expert, it would definitely not be able to break free from the shackles of the Tower of Heaven.

Buzzzzzz!

Moments later, the Tower of Heaven turned into a streak of light and entered Ye Xuan’s forehead.

“Why did you capture it? I can help you kill it!”

Seeing this, Shangguan Wan’er frowned.

She was of course aware that Ye Xuan wanted to use the battle to comprehend martial intents, but now that Ye Xuan had captured the black giant, the meaning behind it was self-evident.

“It’s better to capture it and bring it home as a sparring partner! This place is too boring!”

Ye Xuan looked at Shangguan Wan’er indifferently.

Shangguan Wan’er’s gaze turned cold.

How could she not know Ye Xuan’s purpose? He clearly did not want her to comprehend the martial intents of the black giant!

“Do you also want to use it as a sparring partner?”

“Or do you mean that I have something you want?”

Ye Xuan smiled faintly.

“Hmph!”

Shangguan Wan’er snorted and immediately turned her head away.

As the reincarnation of an ancient great empress, her goal was naturally to comprehend those supreme intents.

Of course, she was also interested in Ye Xuan’s Tower of Heaven.

However, given her status, she would not go as far as to snatch Ye Xuan’s things.

Moreover, after seeing Ye Xuan fight, trying to do so was meaningless. She was not sure if she could beat him, and even if she could, he could easily escape.

She also believed that he was the reincarnation of some ancient almighty expert, and had many trump cards.

“If you want it, I can give it to you!”

“But you have to agree to one condition!”

Ye Xuan looked at Shangguan Wan’er with a meaningful look.

He wanted to take Shangguan Wan’er as his disciple as soon as possible. He coveted her Undying Xuan Huang sword physique.
