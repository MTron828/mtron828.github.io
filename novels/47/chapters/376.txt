377 Role Model

“Hanyi, as my eldest disciple, you should be a good role model. You can’t slack off in your cultivation!”

“I won’t force you to emerge as champion of the Seven Peaks competition, but you can’t embarrass Water Sky peak!”

Yuelun glanced at Li Hanyi, then turned around and left.

As for Li Xue’er, she was standing beside Li Hanyi nervously.

After the other senior and junior sisters noticed that Yuelun had left, they hurriedly walked over.

“Little Junior Sister, what happened? Why did Teacher’s expression look so unsightly just now?”

“That’s right. I’ve never seen Teacher so angry ever since I joined Water Sky peak. Could she have been provoked by someone?”

Li Xue’er shook her head helplessly as she looked at Yuelun’s departing figure.

“Today, Teacher took me to Cloud Sky peak.”

“After much coaxing and pestering, Teacher was even willing to accept my good sister from Cloud Sky peak as her disciple. However, I didn’t expect that Cloud Sky peak’s chief wasn’t useless as the rumors said. Even Teacher was shocked by his strength!”

“Not only that, but my good sister, who is also Ye Xuan’s disciple, has already broken through to the first level of the divine mystic realm after just five days of being in the sect!”

“What?”

As soon as she finished speaking, everyone was dumbfounded.

In just five days, she had broken through to the first level of the divine mystic realm. Was she serious?

Those senior sisters who had joined Water Sky peak a few years ago, but were still struggling in the mystic meridian realm, felt as if all of their hard work and struggles were for naught.

“That’s impossible! How did she do it?”

Everyone’s eyes were filled with shock.

From their perspective, Cloud Sky peak was the weakest and most barren peak in the Great Wilderness Divine sect, and Ye Xuan, its chief, was only a second-level divine mystic realm cultivator.

However, Li Xue’er was now telling them that Ye Xuan was not what the rumors made him out to be, and that his only disciple had reached the first level of the divine mystic realm in five short days.

“Even Cloud Sky peak, which everyone has always regarded to be the weakest, has suddenly exhibited such terrifying strength. No wonder Teacher is so angry,” Li Hanyi took a deep breath, and then looked at her junior sisters with a serious expression. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Junior sisters, from today onward, we must work hard in our cultivation and not embarrass our teacher!”

“There are less than three months left until the Seven Peaks competition. During this time, I hope that all of you can at least improve your cultivation by one level, failing which there will be punishments.”

“Ah, this…”

When the crowd heard this, they immediately fell silent, their expressions desolate.

Was this goal not a little too big?

However, when they saw Li Hanyi’s serious expression, they could only suppress their dissatisfaction.

After all, Li Hanyi was the eldest disciple of Water Sky peak, and the one with the most authority after their teacher.

Hidden Sword peak.

In contrast to the tense atmosphere at Water Sky peak, Gao Shun was planning how to humiliate Ye Xuan after the Seven Peaks competition.

“Hmph! He really is ignorant. He’s just some random cultivator from a lower plane, yet he still fancies himself to be my opponent. Truly overestimating himself!”

A hint of killing intent flashed across the depths of his eyes.

At this moment, a handsome young man walked into the palace.

“Tianyu greets Father. I wonder what Father is looking for me for?”

The young man was Gao Tianyu, the eldest disciple of Hidden Sword peak, and Gao Shun’s only son.

Gao Shun doted on him quite a lot. Furthermore, Gao Tianyu was also quite capable and displayed great talent in cultivating.

If not for his obsession with women, his attainments in cultivation would definitely be no lower than Hua Rufeng’s.

Unfortunately, this kid only thought about how to enjoy women every day, which gave Gao Shun a headache.

He had such an upright character, so how did he give birth to such a son who was addicted to wine and women?

Gao Shun looked at Gao Tianyu, and he could not help but think of what Ye Xuan said before, and his eyes suddenly turned cold.

“Tianyu, you’d better restrain your actions. If you had placed your mind on cultivation instead of playing with women, you might have already surpassed Hua Rufeng.”

“I’m telling you, I’ve already made a bet with Ye Xuan. If you lose to Cloud Sky peak in the Seven Peaks competition in three months, I’ll skin you alive!”

Gao Tianyu smiled nonchalantly, his face full of disdain.

“Ye Xuan? You’re talking about the useless chief of Cloud Sky peak, right?”

“He’s just a mere second-level divine mystic realm piece of trash. Why is Father so worried? Even he isn’t my match, let alone his disciples.”

“Father, you don’t have to worry too much. The champion of the Seven Peaks competition will be me!”

Gao Tianyu patted his chest with confidence, his eyes full of pride.

In the entire Great Wilderness Divine sect, other than Hua Rufeng, who could suppress him, he feared no one.

Although he dallied with women every day, his cultivation level did not cease to rise. Otherwise, how could he attract so many female cultivators?

However, who would have thought that this handsome young man with extraordinary strength was a rapist?

Within the span of just a few years, Gao Tianyu had slept with countless beautiful girls.

Gao Shun was naturally clear of his precious son’s actions too, but he was helpless too and could only choose to turn a blind eye.

However, he would never allow Gao Tianyu to become his weakness.

Immediately, Gao Shun looked at Gao Tianyu sternly.

“As my son, you’ve only achieved this much, yet you’ve become arrogant and complacent?”

“Brat, Ye Xuan’s strength is far from as simple as the rumors say! Not long ago, I went to Cloud Sky peak in person. He has definitely hidden his cultivation level. Even I can’t sense what it is!”

“You had better rein in your desires for now. Our Hidden Sword peak has always been at odds with Cloud Sky peak. If he pins crimes onto you because of this matter, even I can’t protect you!”

The smile on Gao Tianyu’s face gradually froze when he heard this. A dark look flashed across the depths of his eyes.

‘What’s going on? Could it be that this good-for-nothing wants to use me as a bargaining chip to threaten Father?’

Gao Tianyu’s heart was filled with killing intent, but he was also confused.

Even if Ye Xuan had hidden his strength, how strong could he be? At most, he would have reached the materialization realm.

However, his father was a mystic lord realm expert!

Had that kid gone crazy? He even dared to threaten his father?
