642 Preparations Complete

Ye Xuan looked at Zhuge Yueyue and waved his hand. “From today onwards, you don’t have to be responsible for picking her up.”

“This…”

Could it be that her junior sister had caused trouble again?

Ye Xuan continued, “She just smashed the study hall with her hammer. Elder Huang was crying so miserably. There’s no way he would let me send her there again.”

After hearing these words, Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun sighed, then chuckled..

This little girl really could not settle down for even a moment, and did not even last the first day again.

Feng Xiyun squatted in front of Xiang Yun and rubbed her head. She smiled and asked, “Third Sister, why did you tear down the study hall?” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“You have to understand that this is wrong. No matter what the reason is, don’t do such things again, understand?”

“Yes, yes, I understand,” Xiang Yun replied straightforwardly, but who knew what would happen in the future?

“Alright, you guys should go and cultivate now. Focus on your preparations for the gathering.”

After saying this, Ye Xuan returned to the Cloud Sky Palace and continued to study how to refine higher-grade pills.

Xiang Yun was also dragged away by Zhuge Yueyue. Feeling slightly guilty, Xiang Yun did not cause any more trouble for the next 20 days. The entire Great Wilderness Divine sect seemed to be in seclusion.

On the day of the gathering, the door of the Cloud Sky Palace was finally opened again. Ye Xuan walked into the courtyard and watched the morning sun rise.

When he turned around, he could see cultivators flying across the sky from time to time. Everyone was getting ready.

“Teacher…”

Just as Ye Xuan was immersed in his thoughts, Zhuge Yueyue came to greet him with her two junior sisters.

Ye Xuan felt very pleased to see them all ready and full of confidence.

The Divine Seal peak’s gathering was the grandest event in the East continent, and sects and experts would compete to raise and preserve their reputation in the cultivation world.

Not long ago, the people of the main peak had rushed to the venue of the gathering, and Hua Rufeng had also returned to the main peak not long ago.

After cultivating assiduously in the garden with the water cloud fruit tree, he had actually reached the peak of the void realm, which was a pretty shocking feat.

In any case, Hua Rufeng was being groomed to be the next sect master, so this was a good thing for the whole sect.

What made him really happy was that, during the past 30 days, with his help, Zhuge Yueyue had also broken through to the peak of the void realm.

Moreover, she was already very familiar with the hell slash. She could now be considered to be among the ranks of the peerless geniuses.

However, Feng Xiyun’s situation was not as good. She had reached the middle-stage of the void realm, and her speed of advancement was obviously not as fast as Zhuge Yueyue’s, though this was in part because she had been immersed in practicing alchemy and simply did not have the time to cultivate.

After Ye Xuan continuously refined her body, Xiang Yun also broke through to the early-stage of the void realm.

Even though she was not a spiritual cultivator, she could already crush opponents of the same realm just by relying on the power of her physical body.

However, it was a pity that she could not learn divine powers properly despite her strength, which left her lacking in terms of techniques.

Over the past few days, Ye Xuan had painstakingly invited several teachers to teach her how to read, but so far, none of the teachers had been able to last a single day.

Left with no other choice, Ye Xuan could only use the stupidest method to teach her divine powers, which was through constant fighting and sparring to help her learn it from experience and muscle memory.

To be able to do this, Ye Xuan could already be considered a very competent teacher.

His hard work paid off, as after 20 days, she finally managed to figure out an offensive divine power, Endless Lightning.

Ye Xuan had obtained this divine power when he had killed Mo Nan, and it was a heaven-grade divine power of the Immortal Divine sect.

He found that it was suitable for her, so he spared no effort in teaching it to her, and also gave her the Thunderbolt Hammer, which would synergize with this divine power.

With these two, she would be a match for most void realm cultivators. Every time she fought, her attacks would make her opponent’s arm numb, and they even felt like they were facing a wild beast.

However, no matter how powerful she was, what was the use if she could not hit her target?

After the first clash, no one would be dumb enough to take her hits head-on.

Thankfully, the Endless Lightning technique would make up for this shortcoming, and the Thunderbolt Hammer would help her draw out the power of lightning.

However, Xiang Yun felt that the name Thunderbolt Hammer was too unpleasant to hear, so she changed it to Potato Hammer.

Ye Xuan did not know what to say about her naming sense, but most of what she did left him speechless anyway.

In the past 20 days, Ye Xuan had also raised his body refining cultivation level to the supreme realm. It was estimated that it would not take long for him to reach the peak of the supreme realm in this aspect.

After the gathering, Ye Xuan would be able to break through to the ancient realm.

What satisfied Ye Xuan the most was his spiritual cultivation level. Although he did not deliberately cultivate, he had reached the peak of the supreme realm, and his combat strength had once again improved significantly.

Moreover, Ye Xuan had become more familiar with the Heaven-splitting Sword, and could perform it easily.
