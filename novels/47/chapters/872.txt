873 Nine Serenities Of Frost

It was extremely difficult for Zhuge Yueyue to comprehend even a heaven-grade cultivation technique, let alone an immortal-grade one.

Although she was extremely surprised, she was already beginning to feel worried. Sensing her nervousness, Ye Xuan immediately said, “Don’t worry. Since I said that I’m going to teach it to you, I’ll make sure that you’ll be able to fully master it.”

This set her heart at ease, and a bright smile appeared on her face again.

“Alright, Teacher.”

She did not doubt her teacher’s words. After all, everything her teacher said would come true.

“Alright, sit down first.”

After gesturing for Zhuge Yueyue to sit down, Ye Xuan prepared to start. Last time, he had used the loophole in the system and obtained four chances to complete cultivation techniques. He also discovered that these chances applied to completing other things as well.

As he could no longer abuse that loophole, he thought long and hard about what to use them on, and decided on the fiery phoenix technique, as well as the Godsword, and boundless palm technique.

There was also one more technique he wanted to complete, but thinking of Zhuge Yueyue, he decided to use one chance to complete her Nine Serenities of Frost technique, which would hopefully allow her divine bone to transform into an immortal bone and increase her level of talent.

The chances of this happening were not low, as both the divine bone and the Nine Serenities of Frost technique were very compatible with her. However, this was all Ye Xuan’s conjecture. The actual outcome would actually be up to her own luck.

Well, there was no point dwelling on it. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“System, complete the Nine Serenities of Frost technique.”

“Ding! Congratulations! The host has completed the Nine Serenities of Frost technique!”

“Ding! Congratulations! The host has obtained the immortal-grade Nine Serenities of Frost technique!”

Whoa!

It really was upgraded to the immortal-grade!

Looking at the technique in his sea of consciousness, Ye Xuan took a deep breath. His guess was right. Furthermore, the complete Nine Serenities of Frost was not inferior to the Heaven Burning Flames.

The Heaven Burning Flames could burn everything, but the power of the Nine Serenities of Frost could prevent the appearance of all inner demons.

Once mastered, its user would never be disturbed by inner demons in their life. Moreover, it could even completely negate many mental-type attacks.

Upon use, it would cause the user’s surroundings to become a world of ice and snow, further augmenting the user’s power.

Ye Xuan wondered what would happen if he cultivated both techniques, since they restrained each other. Well, it would be a waste not to give it a try.

Then, he immediately began to cultivate the Nine Serenities of Frost technique, releasing his three Dao Flowers as he did in order to increase his comprehension ability to its peak.

Honestly, if Ye Xuan’s physique was not the Chaos Sacred Body, it would be very difficult to master this immortal-grade cultivation technique, and it would require at least a year to comprehend it.

Fortunately, this was not the case. Furthermore, Ye Xuan felt that if he managed to master and teach Zhuge Yueyue this technique, his Chaos Sacred Body would improve once again.

He calmed himself down, and focused his mind to comprehend the technique. Thanks to his Dao Flowers, he managed to shorten the time taken to master the cultivation technique to about an hour.

“Hiss…”

“An immortal-grade cultivation technique really lives up to its reputation. It’s really quite mysterious.”

After taking a deep breath, Ye Xuan opened his eyes and looked at Zhuge Yueyue. “Yueyue, the immortal level cultivation technique I’m going to teach you today is the complete version of the Nine Serenities of Frost technique. You must memorize it well.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan slowly placed his palm on Zhuge Yueyue’s back and instantly sent a wave of cold energy into her sea of consciousness, which made her face turn pale.

“Ah…”

She let out a brief cry, and then forced herself to endure. She clenched her teeth tightly, not wanting to make any more noise.

‘The energy that Teacher is transmitting is too powerful. I can’t hold on any longer. It’s about to overflow…’

She struggled to hold on, but did not give up. Unconsciously, her mind became hazy. This powerful energy was not weaker than Feng Xiyun’s Heaven Burning Flames.

However, at this moment, Zhuge Yueyue felt a warm feeling coming from beside her, so she immediately nestled closer.

Ye Xuan did not push her away.

“The wrath of the Netherworld, bone-chilling ice, freezing mountains and rivers for thousands of miles…”

In her dazed state, Zhuge Yueyue was still reciting the mantras of the cultivation technique that Ye Xuan had taught her.
