509 Zhuge Yueyue Versus Xie Tianyu (Part 3)

“Things are getting more and more interesting. So that is the Azure Dragon Slash?”

“If Xie Tianyu was up against someone else this time, perhaps he could have won easily, but it won’t necessarily be the same when facing Zhuge Yueyue,” Mu Beichen mumbled to himself and smiled when he saw the dragon in the air.

It was obvious that he had an understanding of Zhuge Yueyue’s strength.

Hovering in the air, Zhuge Yueyue saw Xie Tianyu’s swift and fierce attack, and a bright smile blossomed on her face.

“You claim to be a genius, yet the most powerful divine power you’ve mastered is only an earth-rank one…”

Zhuge Yue laughed scornfully.

At the thought of this, Zhuge Yueyue could not help but recall how much energy, resources and treasures Ye Xuan had spent on making her stronger.

With such a good teacher, if she were to be defeated, would that not also be a stain on her teacher’s reputation?

At this moment, the Cloud Sky sword in Zhuge Yueyue’s hand glowed even brighter, and her eyes became even more determined.

Moments later, a wave of overwhelming killing intent surged in all directions.

“Ah!”

Everyone’s eyes narrowed in shock.

The illusory hell emissary’s figure slowly formed above Zhuge Yueyue.

The moment the illusory hell emissary figure was fully formed, the killing intent that Xie Tianyu had released had completely disappeared, as if it had never been there.

Behind Xie Tianyu, the elder was also looking at this scene in shock.

“It’s really a heaven-rank divine power!”

“How did she manage to master a heaven-rank divine power?”

He looked at the dragon, which was being suppressed by the hell emissary..

The originally majestic dragon was now like a small worm in front of the hell emissary.

At this moment, Xie Tianyu’s face was dripping with sweat as he kept telling himself that this was all fake.

“This… This is definitely fake!”

“How could she have mastered a heaven-rank divine power?!”

His original arrogance had long since faded away, leaving only panic.

Xie Tianyu could clearly sense that the killing intent that Zhuge Yueyue had released could easily crush him.

When the hell slash was completed, Zhuge Yueyue said coldly, “Weren’t you being arrogant just now, thinking that you could easily defeat me? Then I’m afraid I’ll have to disappoint you!”

As soon as she finished speaking, Zhuge Yueyue swung her sword at Xie Tianyu without hesitation. It was as if the entire sky had lost its color.

The tall and mighty hell emissary seemed to charge directly at the dragon ready to tear it apart.

Xie Tianyu did not dare to relax. He gathered all his strength and tried to block the attack from the hell emissary.

However, all of his efforts were in vain.

In less than fifteen minutes, the dragon turned into pieces and scattered.

However, the hell emissary’s attack did not end there. Instead, it continued charging toward Xie Tianyu.

At this point, Xie Tianyu had no energy left to defend himself.

He could only close his eyes with a pale face, waiting for death to come.

Bang! Bang!

With a loud bang, the hell emissary’s powerful strike landed on Xie Tianyu.

“Pfft!”

Blood spurted out as Xie Tianyu’s body was sent flying a few hundred meters away.

He had actually been defeated in this battle, and in such an embarrassing way too.

At this moment, Xie Tianyu’s heart had already turned cold. As a peerless genius, he had lost to someone who had yet to make a name for herself.

Could it be that his existence had already become a stepping stone for her success?

“Tianyu, how are you feeling?”

The elder from the Supreme Divine sect ran over anxiously to examine his injuries.

However, when he noticed Xie Tianyu’s severe injuries, the elder’s killing intent intensified.

He had originally wanted to help Xie Tianyu block Zhuge Yueyue’s attack. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

However, as an elder, he really could not bring himself to do it.

If he were to intervene, it would be a huge blow to Xie Tianyu’s confidence.

At this moment, the elder was seething with anger. After all, Xie Tianyu was the Saint of the Supreme Divine sect.

This time, he had accompanied Xie Tianyu in order to prevent other people from attacking him, yet Xie Tianyu had suffered such a heavy blow.

What was he going to tell the sect master when he returned?

Han Tai had no choice but to feed Xie Tianyu a healing pill.

After seeing that Xie Tianyu was fine and recovering, Han Tai heaved a sigh of relief. Then, he turned around and stared at Zhuge Yueyue with a cold expression.

“Young lady, don’t you know how to control your strength? Didn’t your elders teach you to always leave a way out so that you don’t make enemies?”

Hearing this, the disciples from the Great Wilderness Divine sect clenched their fists.

It was obvious that the elder was trying to stir up trouble.

...

“He’s despicable and shameless. Does this elder not care about his reputation anymore?”

Li Hanyi frowned.

She knew that this matter was not so easy to resolve.

The Supreme Divine sect had an elder present, but the Great Wilderness Divine sect did not.

Ye Xuan’s whereabouts were unknown at this time, and Yuelun had also entered the ancient tomb to find Ye Xuan.

Under such circumstances, if this elder really took action, there was nothing they could do.
