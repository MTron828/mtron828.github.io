396 Imparting Knowledge

“Cough cough!”

Ye Xuan quickly coughed and then said seriously, “My precious disciple, you’ve already refined the ape beast’s precious bone and fused it with your own bloodline to reconstruct your body.”

“From today onward, you now possess the talent and aptitude for cultivation.” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“However, you’ve just stepped onto the path of cultivation, so you’re still lacking in terms of knowledge. Since we still have time until your senior sister returns, I’ll teach you about the cultivation world.”

Hearing this, Feng Xiyun raised her head slightly and secretly glanced at Ye Xuan.

She found that the latter’s expression had not changed at all, and she heaved a sigh of relief in her heart.

Feng Xiyun quickly shook her head and suppressed the thoughts in her heart. She took a deep breath and looked at Ye Xuan.

“I will definitely learn and listen attentively!”

“En!”

Ye Xuan took a deep breath and said slowly, “To truly step onto the path of cultivation, one must be able to sense the spiritual energy in the surroundings, and from there, refine the meridians in the mortal body into mystic meridians. This is also the first realm of cultivation, which is known as the mystic meridian realm.”

“The realm above the mystic meridian realm is known as the divine mystic realm, which is the realm you have just reached. Each major cultivation realm is divided into nine levels. It is only in this realm can one cultivate divine powers.”

“Above the divine mystic realm is the materialization realm. Once a cultivator reaches the materialization realm, he or she will have extremely fine control of their own power, and can detect any changes in their surroundings from dozens of miles away.”

Feng Xiyun was listening attentively. Although she was the princess of the divine empire, in the eyes of the public, she was just a tool used to form a marriage alliance for the divine empire.

As such, even though she was a princess, she was lacking in terms of such knowledge.

“The realm above the materialization realm is known as the void realm, wherein one can ignore the laws of space to some extent and teleport.”

“Once one breaks through to this realm, it means that one has mastered a certain amount of the power of the laws.”

“Of course, as for what the power of the laws is, it’s a little too early to tell you about that now. You’ll understand it in the future.”

“The realm above the void realm is called the heaven realm, which is a little different. There are only five levels in the heaven realm, which correspond to the five spiritual seas in a cultivator’s heart, liver, lung, kidney, and spleen.”

“Once a cultivator enters the heaven realm, they can perfectly hide their aura and appear like a mortal. This is the realm I have reached.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Feng Xiyun revealed an intoxicated expression. She did not expect the path of cultivation to be so interesting, or her teacher to be so strong.

“Teacher, what about the realm above the heaven realm?” She asked curiously.

Ye Xuan took a deep breath and slowly said, “Those who have surpassed the heaven realm are called mystic lord cultivators. Some also call them overlords!”

“Once a cultivator reaches this level, they are basically qualified to be the masters of their own holy land.”

“Our Great Wilderness Divine church currently has two mystic lord realm experts. One of them is the sect master, Gongsun Shouyue. The other is the chief of Hidden Sword peak, and also the law enforcement elder of the sect, Gao Shun.”

“Once one’s cultivation level reaches such a level, a casual attack can contain and evolve into thousands of Daos, using the profound power of the laws of the world.”

“Wow! Mystic lord realm cultivators are so powerful!”

She then asked again, “Is there an even higher cultivation realm?”

“Naturally!” Ye Xuan nodded, and his expression gradually became serious.

“Above the mystic lord realm is the supreme realm. Supreme realm experts are considered top-notch experts in the mystic world, but they are not the pinnacle of cultivation in the mystic world.”

“Above the supreme realm there is the ancient realm, as well as the legendary sealed immortal realm!”

“However, although the human race is powerful, we haven’t given birth to a sealed immortal realm expert in the past 10,000 years!”

“For a cultivator to reach this level, it is as difficult as ascending to heaven!”

“Therefore, you must remember, the path of cultivation is fraught with countless hardships. If you want to get stronger, you have to endure and overcome them, no matter how great the difficulty might be.”

“Cultivation itself is a fight against the heavens. If your heart is not stable and focused, one wrong step will lead you into a bottomless abyss!”

“Are you clear?”

Ye Xuan took a deep look at Feng Xiyun and then said with a serious expression.

Feng Xiyun took a deep breath and said with a determined look in her eyes, “I will etch Teacher’s words into my heart!”

As a member of the royal family, she had understood and experienced the schemes and plots of the royal family, which is why she yearned for the cultivation world.
