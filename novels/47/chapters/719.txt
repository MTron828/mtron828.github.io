720 The Lively Su Residence (Part 2)

“Quickly, invite Prince Zhanglu in.”

Thank you readers!

The servant hurriedly went over to escort him in.

After a while, Prince Zhanglu arrived at the reception hall with several guards and subordinates, who were carrying boxes of various sizes.

“Hehe, Master Su has already become a busy man. It’s quite difficult to meet you now,” Prince Zhanglu said boldly as soon as he arrived.

However, when he saw Li Kun sitting in the reception hall, his smile instantly vanished.

!!

“Hey, if it isn’t the famous General Li Kun! What was going on?”

“Logically speaking, you should be busy with work. Why did you take the time to come here?”

After hearing this, Li Kun immediately said coldly, “Prince Zhanglu, aren’t you quite busy yourself? You’re already here, so why can’t I be here? Is there any point in pretending to be surprised?”

When enemies met, sparks would fly. Prince Zhanglu did not want to pay too much attention to Li Kun, so he turned his attention back to Su Tiansheng.

“Master Su, this is truly worthy of celebration. The Su family will only grow stronger thanks to your foresight in forging a good relationship with a peerless expert like Ye Xuan.”

“I believe that you are well aware that one of his disciples emerged victorious during the Divine Seal peak’s gathering recently, which has become the talk of the town throughout the East continent.”

“Obviously, with the reputation of Cloud Sky peak spreading far and wide, your Su family has also welcomed a period of rapid development. I came here today to congratulate you on this matter.”

“I hope that in the future, if you see Chief Ye Xuan, I hope you can help me put in a few good words.”

Prince Zhanglu did not beat around the bush and openly stated his main purpose for coming here.

He was not like Li Kun, who treated the Su family badly in the past, so he did not have to jump through unnecessary hoops.

When the congratulatory gifts were delivered, Su Tiansheng also took a look and found that the boxes were filled with gold, silver, and jewelry. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

‘Damn… Prince Zhanglu didn’t cheap out at all. As expected of a member of the royal family.’

Looking at the boxes of treasures, Su Tiansheng felt gratified. It was truly good to have friends in high places. It seemed that the rise of the Su family was inevitable.

“Haha, Prince Zhanglu, you’re treating me like an outsider. Thank you for your kind words. When I get the opportunity in the future, I will definitely put in a good word for you.”

He would accept these gifts with open arms. However, he also knew his place, and knew very well what he could and could not do.

Although he had already said that he would put in a good word for Prince Zhanglu, it would depend on whether or not the right opportunity presented itself.

Prince Zhanglu was very clear about this, but he did not mind at all. After all, his main purpose was to get closer to Su Tiansheng first. There was no way to forge a relationship with Ye Xuan now. That boat had sailed a long time ago.

In any case, he was not worried about Ye Xuan finding trouble with him. As an eminent expert, how could the latter have the time to pay attention to an ordinary person like him?

“Haha, then I’ll thank Master Su in advance,” he said with a smile.

Then, he raised his head and looked at Li Kun. Seeing the latter’s ugly expression, he almost laughed out loud.

He was actually aware of the grudge between Li Kun and Su Tiansheng.

Su Tiansheng had arrived in Qingyang City ten years ago to make a living here. Before he moved his entire family here, he had met with many of the famous families in Qingyang City. However, he failed to secure an audience with Li Kun.

What was even more outrageous was that Li Kun actually ordered a servant to receive Su Tiansheng in his place.

Was this not a blatant insult? It was equivalent to saying that Su Tiansheng was not worthy of meeting him. At that time, Su Tiansheng had furiously left in a huff.

Now, the tables had been turned, and it was actually Li Kun who was forced to pay a visit to Su Tiansheng.

Su Tiansheng conversed merrily with Prince Zhanglu in front of Li Kun, seemingly lost in the conversation.

As he was clearly being ignored, Li Kun’s heart was already filled with anger. However, he had no viable outlet to vent this anger, and could only suppress it.

After seeing Li Kun forcefully suppress his anger, Su Tiansheng did not let up.

After all, this had always been his way of doing things. If others treated him with courtesy, he would treat others with courtesy, but if others treated him with disrespect, it would be returned in kind.

Li Kun knew that he was in the wrong, so he could only endure it.

He could not blame anyone but himself. At that time, he looked down on others, but now he was looked down upon by others. He deserved it.

…

On the other side, after the gathering, Cloud Sky peak had returned to its peaceful state.

After a short rest, Ye Xuan called his three disciples over.

“Teacher…”

Zhuge Yueyue brought Feng Xiyun and Xiang Yun over and bowed respectfully.

Ye Xuan casually waved his hand and then turned his gaze to Xiang Yun.

This little girl did not seem to have had enough sleep. She yawned as she stood, her eyes almost unable to open, making Ye Xuan laugh.

Seeing that everyone had gathered, Ye Xuan said bluntly, “The Divine Seal peak’s gathering has come to a successful end. Generally speaking, each of your performances were outstanding.”

Hearing this, the three of them revealed extremely bright smiles on their faces. After all, they cherished and longed for their teacher’s praise.
