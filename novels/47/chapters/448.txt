449 Yu Wuyuan Versus Zhuge Yueyue

“Very good!”

Seeing the confident look on Yu Wuyuan’s face, Gao Shun’s expression eased up. Then, he turned around and looked at Ye Xuan, who was not far away. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Gao Shun calmed his emotions, and then returned to his seat.

At this moment, Elder Tongtian was chatting with Ye Xuan with a smile.

“I didn’t expect Fellow Daoist Ye Xuan’s disciple to have cultivated the Hellfire technique. This is truly surprising!”

“Furthermore, she’s even reached the materialization realm at such a young age. Aided by her divine bone, her future achievements are limitless.”

This was something Elder Tongtian believed wholeheartedly.

Before this, Elder Tongtian had always thought that Mu Beichen was the strongest and most talented genius in the East continent.

However, even a disciple who had been cultivating for just a month had exhibited a level of talent that rivaled Mu Beichen.

I’m really curious, though. How did she reach the materialization realm within such a short period of time?”

Elder Tongtian voiced his doubts. His doubts echoed those of everyone watching the competition.

“Actually, it’s not that difficult! She just needed to refine a precious bone of a heaven realm descendant of an ancient beast,” Ye Xuan smiled and said lightly.

“What?”

“You’re saying that your disciple refined the precious bone of a heaven realm descendant of an ancient beast?”

These words even shocked Elder Tongtian and Gongsun Shouyue.

Gongsun Shouyue, in particular, had thought that Ye Xuan’s rapid ascent to the mystic lord realm was related to the precious bone of the ape beast.

However, that very same precious bone had been given to his disciple instead!

Was this not too f*cking generous of him?

Gao Shun was also dumbfounded. He was filled with doubt. Was this guy’s brain kicked by a donkey? Why had he decided to give that precious bone to a disciple?

“Oh my God, isn’t Chief Ye Xuan a little too selfless? I also want to have such a good teacher.”

“I have a very serious question. Is it too late for me to acknowledge someone else as my teacher now?”

Although their words were in jest, the sense of envy among the crowd was real.

With such a selfless teacher, would they still have to worry about their cultivation not progressing fast enough?

Beside them, Mu Beichen’s eyes turned red. He looked as if he was tempted to leave the Heavenly Mountain Divine sect.

Elder Tongtian was startled by this scene and quickly changed the topic.

He did not want his precious disciple getting any funny ideas.

“Hahaha! Fellow Daoist Ye Xuan is truly an extraordinary person. I truly admire you.”

While the crowd was in a heated discussion, the judge of the competition stood up.

“Silence!”

“The second match is about to begin. Both sides, please enter the arenas!”

Only when Gao Shun heard this did his expression take a turn for the better. He turned around and looked at Yu Wuyuan.

“Go! Don’t disappoint my expectations! We must end this farce in the shortest time possible and let everyone see the strength of Hidden Sword peak!”

“Don’t worry, Teacher. I will not fail my mission!” Yu Wuyuan smiled confidently, and then walked toward the arena.

Ye Xuan on the other hand, simply whispered to Zhuge Yueyue softly,

“Little girl, just play around. Have fun!”

“En!” Zhuge Yue Yue nodded.

Then, she too walked over to the arena.

With a flash of bright light, the Cloud Sky sword appeared in Zhuge Yueyue’s hand. She stood in the middle of the arena with a calm expression, and an invisible, cold aura swept out, causing the nearby onlookers to shiver.

“Are you both ready?” The judge asked.

“En!” The two of them nodded in unison.

“Since that’s the case, let the match begin!”

Immediately, Yu Wuyuan’s eyes met Zhuge Yueyue’s, and he bowed with a smile.

“I’m Yu Wuyuan of Hidden Sword peak. Please enlighten me, Little Junior Sister!”

“I’m Cloud Sky peak’s Zhuge Yueyue, please enlighten me, Senior Brother,” Zhuge Yueyue said indifferently without any change in her expression.

Then, a sword appeared in Yu Wuyuan’s hand.

“This sword is called the Flood Dragon Sword. It’s made from thousand-year cold iron and has the power to shatter mountains. Junior Sister, you must be careful.”

Zhuge Yueyue frowned. This guy talked too much.

“Cut the crap. Let’s start fighting!”
