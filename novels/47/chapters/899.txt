900 Teacher’s Wife

“Our Great Wilderness Divine sect has never been afraid of anyone. If you have the ability, come fight us,” Yanran said domineeringly.

Immediately after, she released bursts of seven-colored light, which increased her aura to incredible heights.

At this moment, Yanran was already activating the Great Desolate technique at full power. After she inherited the Saintess’ legacy, she mastered the essence and usage of this divine power.

The Great Desolate technique that she used was comparable to an immortal-grade divine power!

Seeing this, the sect’s cultivators were taken aback. They had seen Ao Lei use this divine power, but compared to the one unleashed by Yanran, it was like night and day.

The entire East Sea was engulfed by her aura, and even those experts who were hiding could sense traces of danger, which terrified them.

As she went up against the six sealed immortal realm experts of the lightning tiger clan, she actually had the upper hand!

This left everyone dumbfounded, especially the cultivators of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, who still did not know who she was. All they could tell was that she was on their side. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Further away, Lu Xiu, who had luckily escaped death, stood up shakily. When he saw the battle in the sky, his jaw dropped in shock.

Seeing that he had regained consciousness, Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun immediately came to his side.

“Martial Uncle Lu, are you alright?”

Feng Xiyun asked with great concern. After all, Martial Uncle Lu had blocked a life-threatening attack for her. For this, she was very grateful.

“Haha… It’s nothing serious.”

Despite laughing out loud, Lu Xiu could not help but cough a few times.

Even though he said that he was fine, he had already suffered serious injuries. Even a few of his bones had been shattered.

If it was not for his amazing willpower, he might have already met the King of Hell. Zhuge Yueyue already noticed his condition and took out a pill without hesitation.

“Martial Uncle Lu, this pill will help you to recover. Take it.”

When Lu Xiu saw Zhuge Yueyue handing him a valuable pill, he was very surprised and quickly said, “Heavens! Martial Niece Zhuge, there’s no need for that. How can I afford to use such a rare pill?”

Hearing this, Zhuge Yueyue said unhappily, “Martial Uncle Lu, the current situation is urgent, so don’t bother with such things.”

“It’s just a pill. It’s nothing compared to the fact that you saved Xiyun’s life.”

“Haha!”

Lu Xiu laughed out loud. He then said, “I have lived a long life, but you two are different. You both still have a promising future ahead of you.”

“Even if I really have to exchange my life for yours, it’s worth it.”

Hearing this, many disciples of the Great Wilderness Divine sect were very touched, and looked at Lu Xiu with even more respect.

“Martial Uncle Lu…”

Feng Xiyun’s heart trembled, but she still insisted.

“Hurry up and take this pill. The current situation is critical, and we need your leadership to deal with the situation.”

After hearing this, Lu Xiu was still a little hesitant. He turned around and looked at the disciples behind him, before finally saying, “Alright then.”

Then, he took the pill from Zhuge Yueyue and consumed it.

Moments later, a large amount of energy surged into his body, and the medicinal power of the pill began to work its magic on his injuries.

Then, his injuries recovered at a speed visible to the naked eye.

Seeing such a terrifying effect, Lu Xiu was extremely shocked and said in a daze, “I didn’t expect that such a powerful pill would exist in our world. Martial Niece Zhuge, who refined these pills?”

Feng Xiyun immediately rushed to answer, “Hehe, of course it was refined by our teacher.”

“I see. That makes sense.”

Although Lu Xiu was very surprised, he felt that this was very normal after thinking about it. His admiration for Ye Xuan increased by quite a bit.

With such miraculous pills, it was no wonder that he had not suffered any defeat since his debut.

He looked at the battle in the sky again. When he saw the beautiful sealed immortal realm suppressing the six experts, he was completely dumbfounded.

“Martial Niece Zhuge, do you know the background of this expert?” he asked, “Why did she help you?”

Hearing this, the other disciples of the Great Wilderness Divine sect immediately cast curious looks at her because they were also very confused about the whole situation.

Zhuge Yueyue did not know what to say. After thinking for a moment, she made up her mind.

“She asked me to call her Teacher’s wife.”

“This…”

Everyone’s jaws dropped in shock.

“Oh my god! Sword Elder Ye is too amazing! He actually hooked up with such a powerful peerless beauty. He’s really the best role model for our generation!”

After hearing this shocking news, the cultivators of the Great Wilderness Divine sect were gobsmacked. In that case, did this not mean that the Great Wilderness Divine sect had two sealed immortal realm experts?

After learning this information, even Lu Xiu could not maintain his calm expression. He instantly laughed out loud.

“Hahaha! This is great news…”
