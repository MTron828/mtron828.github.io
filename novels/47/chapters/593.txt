594 The Reappearance Of The Strange Power (Part 1)

Seeing the intense battle in the sky, the people below were all very surprised. They did not even blink, not willing to miss a single moment.

“Hiss…” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“So powerful! A duel between two supreme realm experts defies imagination!”

“I truly did not expect Martial Uncle Ye to be so powerful. His strength has even exceeded Martial Uncle Ao’s!”

“You know, I think he is the number one expert of our sect now.”

As the people were discussing, even Ao Lei was very surprised.

This junior brother of his had actually reached this level within such a short time.

‘As long as Ye Xuan is given some time, he might be able to reach the sealed immortal realm, which would be unprecedented in the East continent.’

‘The prosperity of our Great Wilderness Divine sect is assured!’

Ao Lei was very excited at this time. After all, he was already old, and the chances of a drastic improvement in his cultivation level were not high.

The only thing that he worried about was the Great Wilderness Divine sect, and what would happen to it when he was no longer around.

Would there be another expert who could support the Great Wilderness Divine sect and help it to flourish?

It was for this reason that he had been very concerned in recent years. No one knew what he had given up and what he had done for the sect…

And at this moment, Gao Shun’s mouth was similarly wide open as he watched the fight. Ye Xuan had truly surpassed him in every aspect. Even though he knew that he would have no problems reaching the supreme realm himself now, he was certain that he would be no match for Ye Xuan then as well.

In the sky, the battle between the two sides was getting more and more intense, and the two of them had clashed over a thousand times.

Mo Nan’s face was gloomy.

He had already discovered that Ye Xuan remained calm throughout the fight, and it appeared that he had not used his full strength at all.

At this time, he had already erupted with his full strength, yet he still could not suppress Ye Xuan, which did not bode well for the outcome of this battle.

According to the current situation, he would lose this battle without a doubt.

“Impossible! I can’t allow this to continue. I have to win!”

Looking at the Immortal Divine sect that he had painstakingly helped to develop, Mo Nan kept encouraging himself, psyching himself up to believe that he would definitely win.

Boom!

After a loud explosion, both sides took half a step back.

Even though Ye Xuan was in the middle of the lightning formation and was constantly numbed by the lightning, he did not look troubled at all, as if the whole thing was just a warm-up exercise.

He had not gotten serious yet.

“Old man, is that all you’re capable of? If that’s all there is to you, then we should just declare the outcome right here and now.”

“The Immortal Divine sect has been around for long enough. It’s time to consign it to the history books,” Ye Xuan said expressionlessly.

Moments later, he raised his right hand into the sky. Suddenly, the wind surged and clouds gathered, and an extremely powerful sword aura condensed.

Mo Nan’s face paled.

“This… This can’t be true!”

‘We’ve already been fighting for so long, but he has other tricks up his sleeve?’

A huge sword condensed in the sky.

At that moment, Mo Nan was truly at his wit’s end.

What could he do to change the outcome of this battle?

He could clearly sense how powerful the sword was. With his current strength, he would not be able to block it.

“No, absolutely not! The Immortal Divine sect will not be destroyed like this!” Mo Nan bellowed, his eyes suddenly turning vicious.

All of a sudden, an extremely strange aura emanated from him, and a black mist covered his body.

Ye Xuan frowned when he saw this. He muttered to himself when he saw Mo Nan’s current state, “It’s this strange power again?”

He discovered that the dense black mist was constantly surging out from the rear of the Immortal Divine sect.

This surprised the others as well.

Why was there such a strange thing hidden within the Immortal Divine sect?

Zhuge Yueyue’s expression turned cold, her eyes filled with hatred.

She was no stranger to this power.

“If I’m not wrong, the reason for the berserk beasts’ attack back then was due to this black mist.”

After saying this, Zhuge Yueyue looked at Mo Nan hatefully.

The enemy she had been searching for was right before her eyes.

Not only had Elder Taiyin used this strange power, but even Mo Nan had begun to use it! This clearly meant that the Immortal Divine sect had been hiding this strange black mist.

Sensing Zhuge Yueyue’s anger, Feng Xiyun tried to calm her down.

“Sister Yueyue, don’t worry. Teacher will definitely help you take revenge.”

At this point, Zhuge Yueyue was on the verge of losing control of herself. When she recalled the scene of her parents being brutally murdered, her entire body started to tremble.

Soon, tears rolled down her cheeks, and she clenched her fists as she looked at Mo Nan, who was hovering in the air.

She knew that it was impossible for her to defeat Mo Nan with her current cultivation, so she could only rely on her teacher.

Her teacher had also promised her that he would definitely help her kill her enemy.

Meanwhile, Mo Nan’s body was no longer visible. He was surrounded by the thick black mist, and the only thing visible were his eyes, which were glowing red.

...

“Hehe, Ye Xuan, you must be very surprised now, right? I too had yet to use my trump card!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Mo Nan sucked the thick black mist into his body…
