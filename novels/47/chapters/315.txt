316 Trash Of The Sea Race

In the darkness of the spatial turbulence, the two King realm experts of the Yaksha race looked at Jun Moyu and Jun Feitian with mocking gazes.

“Don’t worry, the battle will be over soon!”

At the same time, the other flood dragon also smiled.

Jun Moyu and Jun Feitian frowned when they saw this.

The two sides were evenly-matched, and had been in a deadlock for several years. Unless more King realm experts appeared, the situation would not change anytime soon.

“Haha! I’m sure you’ve already thought of it!”

“Very soon, the experts of my race will descend, and all of you here will die!”

The Yaksha’s ugly face sported a cruel smile.

At this moment, a mysterious ripple suddenly appeared in the depths of the spatial turbulence. A powerful gust of wind blew past, and then the figure of an unfamiliar Yaksha King realm expert was revealed.

“Damn it!”

Jun Moyu and Jun Feitian’s expressions changed when they saw this.

“Hurry up and run!”

On the other side, Bai Long and Huo Bodong turned around and ran without hesitation.

Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!

Four streaks of light were flying quickly in the spatial turbulence, trying to get rid of their pursuers. However, they were all of equal strength, so there was no way they could put distance between them.

“Hahaha! After fighting for so long, do you think that we will allow you all to escape?” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Why struggle in vain? Just accept your fate!”

The strange laughter of the Yaksha King realm expert echoed in the surroundings.

Buzzzzzz!

The trident in his hand glowed with a brilliant light as he charged toward Bai Long. It instantly pierced through his body, leaving a gaping hole.

“Detestable!”

Bai Long was terrified.

The one who had attacked him was the Yaksha who had just appeared, and he was even stronger than the two Yakshas from before.

Were it not for the divine elements in his body being strong enough, he would have been severely injured from that one blow.

“Worthy of being a shadow intent cultivator. You’re really tenacious!”

Boom! Boom! Boom!

At this moment, more brilliant attacks lit up the spatial turbulence. Violent energy wreaked havoc in the surroundings.

“What should we do?”

Bai Long’s expression betrayed his anxiety.

This newcomer’s strength was too terrifying, and the martial techniques he used restrained Bai Long’s. If this situation continued, he would die!

Huo Bodong was not in a much better situation. The situation was now 4v5, and it so happened that almost every sea race cultivator had comprehended water intent, which was the natural counter to his fire intent.

Among the group, only Jun Moyu and Jun Feitian were considered powerful, and had almost escaped the sea race’s King realm experts’ encirclement. Despite this, they were forced into a fighting retreat by the uneven numbers.

“Look over there!”

“Why is there a giant tower in the spatial turbulence?”

Both sides spotted a huge tower that stood in the sky hundreds of miles away, which was surrounded by layers of purple light!

“Tower of Heaven!”

When everyone saw the words engraved on the tower, their expressions changed.

It was actually the Tower of Heaven!

If it was here, did that not mean that Ye Xuan was also here?

They were saved!

The Tower of Heaven was extremely powerful, and would at least be able to resist the attacks of the King realm experts. If Ye Xuan allowed them to use it, they might even turn the tide of battle!

Given the critical situation, he would allow them to use it, right?

Buzzzzzz!

Before everyone could come back to their senses, the space above the tower rippled, and a young man’s figure appeared.

The young man’s eyes were indifferent, and he had the demeanor of one who looked down upon the world.

“Trash of the sea race, how dare you act so atrociously in the territory of the human race? You really don’t know what’s good for you!”

“Who are you?”

A Yaksha King realm expert, who was a mid-stage Human King realm cultivator, had a serious look in his eyes.

He had already probed Ye Xuan’s cultivation level, but failed to detect the slightest fluctuation in the latter’s aura.

There were only two possibilities for such a situation. Either Ye Xuan’s strength was too terrifying, or the aura-concealing technique he cultivated was too high-level.

Still, no matter what, to have appeared so brazenly amidst a battle between nine King realm experts, this person was definitely not simple.
