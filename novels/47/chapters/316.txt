“The person who will destroy you,” Ye Xuan replied indifferently.

He was not bothered by the fact that there were five King realm experts on the opposing side, within which there were three middle-stage and two early-stage Human King realm experts.

Hearing this, the dark eyes on the Yaksha’s ugly face flickered slightly, and his expression turned extremely serious.

His intuition told him that Ye Xuan was dangerous!

If he acted impulsively, it was very likely that they would consign themselves to eternal damnation!

“Let’s go!”

The Yaksha King realm expert who had just appeared signaled the others to retreat.

The other sea race King realm experts were also quite wary of Ye Xuan, so they chose the safe option and immediately agreed with the Yaksha King’s idea.

Regardless of Ye Xuan’s strength, that tower alone was enough to put them in a troublesome situation.

“Hehe! Did I say that you could leave?”

Moments later, Ye Xuan stretched out his hand and pointed his finger in their direction. His powerful spatial intent swept out, instantly imprisoning all them.

At that moment, the expressions of the sea race’s experts changed. They felt an invisible force restricting their movements. No matter how much power they poured out of their bodies, they could not shake it off. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

It was a spatial prison!

Furthermore, this guy was not using a treasure to imprison them, but merely his spatial intent.

How was this possible? How could there be such a monstrous human genius in the Huangyu Zone? Why had they not heard of this person before?

However, their questions were destined to go unanswered.

The invisible force started constricting, as even light was sucked into the depths of what seemed to be an abyss. The sea race’s experts’ bodies were being compressed at a speed visible to the naked eye!

“How is this possible? Spatial intent and strength intent?”

“Not only has he comprehended both, but he’s also fused them!”

“Damn it! This guy is going to be a threat to our whole race!”

“There’s no way to transmit the news either!”

Then…

Bang Bang Bang!

Under the fused power of the two supreme intents, the bodies and souls of all five sea race experts instantly turned into dust and completely disappeared from the world.

The surroundings instantly quieted down. One could even hear a pin drop!

Jun Moyu and the others were dumbfounded. Their eyes filled with absolute shock.

So powerful!

Who was this guy?

Wait a second. The master of the Tower of Heaven was Ye Xuan, right?

Was he not supposed to be a pattern condensation realm cultivator?

How had he killed five King realm experts without breaking a sweat?

In the corner, Bai Long was trembling. His heart was filled with fear. After all, he had been one of those scheming to snatch the Tower of Heaven.

If this person was really Ye Xuan, or the almighty expert behind Ye Xuan, then he was in trouble!

‘No! It can’t be Ye Xuan! Please don’t let it be Ye Xuan!’

Bai Long was praying inwardly to every deity he had ever heard of.

“I’ll never forget your help, Fellow Daoist. How should I address you?”

Jun Feitian was the first to recover from his shock. He bowed to Ye Xuan with gratitude in his eyes.

The strength Ye Xuan had displayed just now was too terrifying. Jun Feitian even suspected that he had reached the Heavenly King realm.

Fortunately, this person was a human expert, otherwise the Huangyu Zone would have been in trouble!

“I’m Ye Xuan.”

Ye Xuan looked at Jun Feitian.

“Y-Ye Xuan?”

When Bai Long heard this, he was completely dumbfounded, as if he had been struck by lightning.

It was really as he feared!

How could Ye Xuan’s strength be so terrifying?

From the looks of it, everyone had been deceived by Ye Xuan. Anyone who could kill five King realm experts in seconds could definitely kill all of those pattern condensation realm subordinates that everyone sent.He could easily kill five sea tribe rulers in seconds, so what other experts did he need.

However, if Ye Xuan knew what he had done before, would that not spell his doom?

Although he was very nervous, Bai Long still pretended to be calm.

No matter how terrifying Ye Xuan’s strength was, there was no way of telling who had sent those pattern condensation realm cultivators. As long as the perpetrators did not rat each other out, no one would know.

“Bai Long, we should settle the score between us,” Ye Xuan’s indifferently said.

“Ah? What do you mean?”

Bai Long’s expression changed drastically, and his heart began to beat uncontrollably. His eyes fell on Ye Xuan, and he forced a smile.

“Fellow Daoist Ye Xuan, what are you doing?”
