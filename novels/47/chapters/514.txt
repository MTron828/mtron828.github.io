515 Stepping Into The Supreme Realm

“You don’t have to worry about Ye Xuan. You’ll probably die way before he does.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Yuelun stared at Elder Taiyin and berated him without any trace of politeness.

“Little girl, you simply don’t know what’s good for you!”

Elder Taiyin was so furious that he launched an attack at Yuelun.

However, Yuelun was not afraid at all. In fact, she had already assumed a battle stance and had been waiting for Elder Taiyin to attack.

At this moment, Elder Tongtian stood between the two of them and forced Elder Taiyin back with a casual palm strike.

Then, he turned around and said to Yuelun, “Fellow Daoist Yuelun, if you really want to find Ye Xuan, then head west.”

“If I’m not wrong, Ye Xuan should be somewhere in that direction.”

Elder Tongtian’s guess was not unfounded. After all, the shark’s body was found in the western area of the blood-red sea, and the only person who could have killed it was Ye Xuan.

Yuelun was extremely grateful for the advice.

“Many thanks, Fellow Daoist Tongtian. I’ll head west to search for him. You guys can continue fighting.”

She had only entered the ancient tomb to find Ye Xuan anyway. She had had no intention of fighting for the treasures here.

As soon as she finished speaking, Yuelun hurried over in the direction Elder Tongtian had pointed out to her.

After a while, she found the body of the shark. This confirmed Elder Tongtian’s words, so she continued her search.

At this moment, Ye Xuan was still in the cave, completely immersed in cultivation.

The passage of time in this cave was different from the outside world. Three days outside was 30 days in the cave.

During these 30 days of continuous cultivation, his entire body had undergone tremendous changes. One after another, golden streams of light flowed around his body.

If he could break through, his body would be close to immortal.

Even if he suffered serious injuries, he could easily recover.

‘I’ll give it my all. The time for the last push is here!’

After 30 days of non-stop cultivation, Ye Xuan had become more and more excited because he could clearly feel that his body had undergone a transformation.

Not only that, but his strength was also slowly rising. It would probably not take long for him to break through again.

Wave after wave of his spiritual power bombarded the cultivation realm barrier.

Then, moments later, Ye Xuan felt a powerful force fill his body.

“Oh my god!”

“This is awesome!”

At this moment, Ye Xuan felt as if the shackles that bound his body had suddenly been released. His whole body felt relaxed and comfortable.

Bang bang bang!

With a series of explosions, Ye Xuan’s robe exploded into pieces and scattered, exposing his muscles that were glowing golden.

There were still waves of spiritual power flowing to his divine spring, and a spiritual energy vortex formed above Ye Xuan’s head. The next moment, it rushed into Ye Xuan’s body again.

After sensing this extremely huge force, Ye Xuan’s entire body began to tremble violently as the spiritual energy entered his body.

The cave was originally filled with dense spiritual energy, but thanks to the vortex above his head, it was all drawn toward Ye Xuan and poured into his body.

At this point, Ye Xuan could be considered to have entered the supreme realm. The only problem was that the domain he was in was for mystic lord realm experts.

If he revealed his strength carelessly, he would probably be teleported out.

At this moment, Ye Xuan was examining his body with satisfaction. When he saw that his robe had been torn to pieces, he felt rather regretful.

‘I’ve only worn this for two days, and it’s gone just like that. What a pity. It’s such a waste of money.’

‘Fortunately, I was well prepared and brought a few more sets of clothes with me when I went out. Otherwise, I’m afraid my reputation will be damaged as I fly around naked.”

After changing his clothes, Ye Xuan once again examined the power he had now, and his confidence grew stronger than ever.

If the heaven devouring divine sparrow dared to appear in front of him now, he would definitely be able to forcefully suppress it.

Just as Ye Xuan was getting excited, the cave entrance he had sealed suddenly trembled violently, as if someone was trying to break in.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan could not help but frown. However, when he realized that the person was Yuelun, he suddenly laughed evilly.

He immediately concealed his aura and hid himself.

As long as he concealed his aura, Yuelun would not be able to find him no matter how powerful her spiritual sense was.

When she walked in, she could not help but curse.

“Where is this stinky Ye Xuan hiding? I tracked him all the way here, then he suddenly disappeared.”

Yuelun was rather frustrated.

She had been following Ye Xuan’s tracks, but just as she was about to find him, she found out that she had lost track of him. It would be a lie if she said she was not angry.

However, when she looked around, she realized that there was a time-flow formation in this place, and there was even a spiritual energy spring that had been sucked dry.

“Heavens! It;s actually a time-flow formation!”

Yuelun was completely stunned. This was a rare paradise for cultivation.

As she walked along, she arrived at the place where Ye Xuan had been cultivating, deep in thought.

It was so quiet inside the cave that even a drop of water could be heard.

At this moment…

“Hey!”
