Chapter 104: It’s Time To Reap Rewards Again

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The original relationship between these three sects had been quite good, or they would not have collaborated to hold an inter-sect competition.

Although they were not allies in the truest sense, when faced with a hostile force or faction, they would generally choose to fight alongside each other.

However, they had no choice but to draw a line in the sand when faced with the full might of the Xuanyin sect. After all, it seemed that the latter would not give up until they destroyed the Qingyun sect. Furthermore, Ming He was a peak core formation realm expert.

However, even though they had distanced themselves from the Qingyun sect, the Xuanyin sect still refused to let them go!

At the thought of this, everyone had mixed feelings!

If they had known that Ye Xuan’s strength was so terrifying, they would not have abandoned the Qingyun sect.

Unfortunately, it was still an if!

“Sigh!”

The elders of the two sects sighed deeply. It was useless to regret things now.

Then, they returned to their respective sects.

No one knew how their sect leaders would react when they learned what had happened!

…

“Sect leader, the thousand-year ice silk armor…” Ye Xuan’s gaze turned to Wan Shanhai with a knowing expression.

“Ah… Okay!”

Wan Shanhai was momentarily stunned, but then quickly responded and took out the reward he had prepared for the competition from his storage space and handed it to Ye Xuan.

After learning of Ye Xuan’s terrifying strength, even Wan Shanhai could not help but feel a little cautious around Ye Xuan. However, when he saw the gentle smile on Ye Xuan’s face, he was relieved.

With Ye Xuan’s strength, he could already dominate the Great Qian dynasty!

However, the former did not change because of this!

“I will first give some instructions to Yue and Qingyan. After that, I will personally go to the Xuanyin sect and settle everything!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan brought Yue and Li Qingyan back to Lingjiu peak.

Wan Shanhai and the other elders were shocked when they heard this, but also somewhat pleased!

The Xuanyin sect, the second-ranked sect in the Great Qian Dynasty, a terrifying force that had existed for thousands of years, was actually going to be wiped out?

One person and one sword was all it took to destroy such a powerful sect!

Who knew what kind of shock it would cause in the Great Qian Dynasty?

Under normal circumstances, the Great Qian royal family would never allow this to happen. However, how could they stop Ye Xuan?

After all, even Ming He, who was a peak core formation realm expert, was no match for Ye Xuan. Even that old monster from the Great Qian Dynasty might not be able to stop Ye Xuan.

However, no matter what the outcome was, the Great Qian royal family would definitely make a move without hesitation. Perhaps that old monster was already on his way to the Qingyun sect.

Ye Xuan figured as much, but it would not affect his decision!

After witnessing Ye Xuan’s strength, the crowd naturally would not doubt Ye Xuan’s decision either. In fact, they would support him with all their might!

“Your top priority is to properly digest the sword intent that I displayed just now!”

Although Ye Xuan’s figure had disappeared, his voice still rang out very clearly in everyone’s ears.

“We will obey Elder Ye Xuan’s orders!”

Many Qingyun sect cultivators shouted excitedly, and many new fanboys and fangirls were born on this day.

Wan Shanhai smiled bitterly when he saw this. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Why did it feel that this guy had more authority than him, the sect leader?

When he had instructed these sect cultivators to cultivate, they had not been so diligent, had they? Looking at their excited expressions, it seemed like if they did not immediately digest the sword intent, they would be letting Ye Xuan down.

Seeing this, Lin Qing covered her mouth and chuckled.

The originally nervous mood also evaporated into joy.

..

Lingjiu peak, cultivation room.

The gazes of these two disciples were fixed on Ye Xuan, their eyes filled with hope.

Every time their teacher brought them to the cultivation room, there would be good things in store for them.

Sure enough, Ye Xuan took out the thousand-year ice silk armor.

“Yue has reached the fifth level of the purple spirit realm, and Qing Yan has reached the second level of the purple spirit realm. Though her strength is relatively weaker, so I’ve decided…”

“To give this thousand-year ice silk armor to Yue!”

Ye Xuan surprisingly made a decision that seemed to run contrary to common sense.

However, he had his own considerations.

He would use the ice silk armor to obtain a better system reward to give to the weaker Li Qingyan!

As soon as he finished speaking, an armor filled with the power of ice suddenly appeared. It was as thin as a cicada’s wing and was extremely suitable to be worn as an inner armor.

Yue’s gaze fell on the inner armor that was as thin as a cicada’s wing, and she could not help but blush.

Although it was a defensive item, it was obviously worn inside, similar to the inner garments that women wore.

Did Teacher just give me a piece of underwear?

“Thank you, Teacher!”

Yue lowered her head and shyly took the ice silk armor.

However, Ye Xuan did not notice the change in Yue’s expression. His mind was focused on the system’s notification.

“Ding! As the host has given his disciple the thousand-year ice silk armor (mid-grade defensive spiritual artifact), the host has received a randomized 23x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the thousand-year golden silk armor (high-grade defensive spiritual artifact)!”

After the system’s notification ended, an inner armor that was extremely similar to the thousand-year ice silk armor suddenly appeared in the system’s storage space!

The difference between the two was that the thousand-year ice silk armor was forged from ice silk that was as thin as the wings of a cicada, while the thousand-year golden silk armor was forged from gold silk.

In terms of defense, the thousand-year golden silk armor was easily stronger, but it was also as thin as the wings of a cicada.

These gold and silver threads were producedby the golden and ice silkworms. Their strength was not high, but the threads produced from their bodies were extremely tough, and well-suited to craft flexible armors and garments.

“Qingyan! This thousand-year golden silk armor is for you!”

Then, Ye Xuan gave the thousand-year golden silk armor to Li Qingyan.

“Thank you, Teacher!”

Li Qingyan also blushed. After all, both items looked like women’s lingerie.

“Ding! As the host has given his disciple the thousand-year-old golden silk armor (high-grade defensive spiritual artifact), the host has received a randomized 20x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the Golden Sparrow armor (high-grade defensive spiritual artifact)!”

As soon as the system notification ended, Ye Xuan extended his spiritual sense into the system’s storage space.

A golden red armor was floating inside. Floating behind the armor, like an illusory phantom, was the outline of a bird-type demonic beast.

According to the system’s description, this armor could be worn over the user’s regular clothes. It was very convenient!
