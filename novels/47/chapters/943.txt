944 Portable Charger

At this moment, everyone discovered that streaks of lightning energy were continuously transmitted into Ye Xuan’s body. Furthermore, the lightning energy seemed to energize him!

“Awesome! It’s really awesome!”

Ye Xuan shouted this, feeling very refreshed, both physically and mentally. It really was awesome having a portable charger like this fellow. Whenever he ran out of energy, or needed a boost, he could just grab this fellow and charge up.

After seeing Ye Xuan’s relaxed expression, the onlookers were even more confused.

At this moment, Yanran could not help but burst out laughing.

“Ye Xuan’s actions have always been unpredictable.” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Her gaze toward him was filled with admiration. It was always interesting to see what her sweetheart came up with.

As for Ye Xuan, he felt that his entire body was filled with power, and the aura he released was evidence of that. Once he was fully charged up, he released the Thunder-Devouring Beast and laughed even more brazenly.

Under the powerful effect of the Shadow of the Sky God, Ye Xuan could release a destructive power of lightning with a casual wave of his hand.

“I’m overflowing with lightning energy! Hmm… I wonder if I can electrocute this little worm to death?”

Ye Xuan was eager to give it a go as he stared coldly at the flood dragon.

“Hurry up and make your move. I don’t have the patience to continue wasting time with you. I want to see if I can kill you in one move. If I can’t do it, I’ll spare your life,” Ye Xuan said arrogantly, ridiculing the flood dragon.

When the flood dragon heard these words, it became even more furious and shouted, “Shameless lunatic, how dare you insult me like this. If you have the ability, then go ahead and try!”

“If I beg for mercy from you today, then I will change my surname to Ye!”

However, as soon as it finished speaking, dense purple divine lightning instantly appeared in the sky, as Ye Xuan flew up and instantly appeared within the endless sea of lightning. With a wave of his hands, the endless sea of lightning struck toward the flood dragon.

“I will uphold justice for the heavens and exterminate evil!”

With this roar, the endless lightning threatened to want to destroy the world, causing the world to tremble violently.

Boom!

The shout was accompanied by a huge explosion, and the flood dragon did not have time to dodge at all. It was submerged in a deluge of divine lightning!

In the blink of an eye, the floor dragon’s huge body fell straight to the ground.

After the dust settled, the dragon was still vomiting blood, and seemed to be on the verge of death. It had lost, and failed to put up the slightest bit of resistance despite using its innate divine power.

It glanced at Ye Xuan, feeling regret. It should not have been so arrogant. However, even before it could say its last words, the last traces of life left its body, and it closed its eyes forever.

“Hu…”

The shocking attack had already caused everyone present to turn pale with fright, and they were taking deep breaths to calm themselves down.

“Oh my god! He didn’t even have a chance to beg for mercy.”

Seeing the dragon’s charred body, exclamations of shock and disbelief rang out. When they raised their heads to look at the figure in the sky, they felt a cold chill run down their spines.

“Ye Xuan is really too terrifying. If anyone else provokes him in the future, they will definitely not have a good ending.”

“That’s right. He’s also very ruthless to his enemies. Every single one of them has ended up dead.”

Everyone gained newfound respect and admiration for Ye Xuan, but at the same time, feared him.

Ye Xuan’s Shadow of the Sky God had completely changed their paradigm on what power truly meant.

Then suddenly, a purple figure instantly appeared beside the flood dragon. It was the Thunder-Devouring Beast.

At this moment, he was still worried that the flood dragon was still alive, so he kicked it a few more times indignantly. When he was sure that it was dead, he revealed a confident smile on his face.

“Hahaha, if you have the ability, you can continue to be arrogant. Hurry up and hit me.”

Recalling the painful past of being beaten up by this flood dragon, the Thunder-Devouring Beast could not help but kick the corpse twice again in anger.

Seeing an old nemesis being killed by his big brother made him feel extremely comfortable and relaxed. Looking around, the Thunder-Devouring Beast felt even better after sensing the admiration of the onlookers.

This feeling was really too satisfying!

In his many years of existence, this was the first time he had been able to show off like this, and he felt even more certain that it had been the right decision to follow Ye Xuan.

After adjusting his mood, the Thunder-Devouring Beast’s aura once again became domineering. Hr looked at the people around it and said loudly, “Is there anyone else who is not convinced?”

The people he looked at lowered their heads one after another.

They were thinking at the moment that since this person’s brother is so powerful, then this Thunder-Devouring Beast must be quite powerful.

It was best not to anger him, lest they provoke the pair.

Seeing the onlookers involuntarily lower their heads, the Thunder-Devouring Beast instantly felt a rush of adrenaline.

‘Oh my god, this feeling is too satisfying. In one word, it’s awesome!’

He was so excited that he almost shouted out loud. Perhaps this was the happiest moment since he was born.
