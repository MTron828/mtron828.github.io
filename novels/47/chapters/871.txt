872 Zhuge Yueyue’s Worries

“Yueyue, as the chief of Cloud Sky peak, you should be worried. After all, Xiyun has already become a supreme realm cultivator, and after Xiang Yun wakes up, she will probably reach the ancient realm.”

“As their eldest disciple and chief, you shouldn’t fall too far behind.”

After hearing Ye Xuan’s words, Zhuge Yueyue lowered her head involuntarily, feeling extremely guilty. She also wanted to improve herself quickly, and she was always striving to get stronger. However, her talent was limited. What could she do?

“Teacher, I know this very well. I will definitely work hard too,” Zhuge Yueyue lowered her head and said.

She was also very clear about her own shortcomings. After all, her starting line was far behind the other top geniuses. Not long ago, Zhuge Yueyue had learned that the Reincarnation Fairy had gone into secluded cultivation to inherit the secret technique of the Jade Lake Divine sect. By the time the latter ended her seclusion, the gap between the two of them would probably widen again.

Mu Beichen had also started his secluded cultivation at this moment. Because he always looked unconcerned and casual, people sometimes believe that he was not particularly talented. However, Zhuge Yueyue did not think so.

It was precisely because of this that she was already under a lot of pressure at this moment. She was even thinking about whether she could really compete with the geniuses of the other continents with her level of talent. Even though she had reached the peak of the mystic realm, others would eventually surpass her if her cultivation level did not progress.

After all, the only reason she had reached this level was thanks to Ye Xuan’s help, and had nothing to do with her talent.

Seeing Zhuge Yueyue’s pitiful expression, Ye Xuan could not help but feel sorry for her. In any case, he had already made up his mind to help her improve her level of talent.

“Sigh…” After sighing, Ye Xuan immediately said, “You silly girl, have you forgotten what I said? In my heart, you will always be the best. Don’t look down on yourself.”

“You don’t have to worry. As long as your teacher is around, he will definitely not let you suffer.”

As he spoke, Ye Xuan gently rubbed her head. At this moment, Zhuge Yueyue’s eyes were filled with tears, and she felt both comforted, and a little sad. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Teacher!”

Zhuge Yueyue threw herself into Ye Xuan’s arms and sobbed.

“Alright, alright. You’re already such a big girl, so you shouldn’t cry over such matters,” Ye Xuan said with a smile. Then, he brought her to the other side of the cave. Zhuge Yueyue’s body also contained a divine bone. However, her divine bone’s attribute was the opposite of Feng Xiyun’s; ice as opposed to fire.

At that time, Ye Xuan had specially taught Zhuge Yueyue the Nine Serenities of Frost technique, which was similar to the Heaven Burning Flames technique. This cultivation was also incomplete, but Ye Xuan was not sure what grade it would reach after it was completed, but it should be good stuff.

“Yueyue.”

When they arrived at a smaller cave entrance within Cloud Sky Cave, Ye Xuan suddenly stopped, looking solemn.

“Teacher, what’s the matter?”

Ye Xuan immediately said, “The Heavenly Stairway is about to commence. I can’t help you much. After all, the future path still depends on you.”

“You have already seen the situation today. Your second sister has already improved greatly, so I don’t need to worry too much about her future.”

“However, right now, the person who worries me the most is you.”

Zhuge Yueyue’s heart trembled violently when she heard this. She knew that her teacher had always cared for her.

She sobbed and said, “Teacher, I’m sorry. My lack of ability has made you worry.”

She felt very guilty. After all, she wanted to become stronger so that her teacher wouldn’t have to worry so much. However, due to the limitations of her talent, even though she had tried her best, she still could not meet his expectations.

As her teacher’s eldest disciple, if she were to be defeated by others, it would definitely sully her teacher’s reputation, which was the last thing she wanted.

After noticing Zhuge Yueyue’s guilty look, Ye Xuan rubbed her head lovingly and started to feel happy. Well, it seemed that he had managed to set the right mood.

“I understand the pressure on your shoulders, but you don’t have to worry. Today, I will teach you an immortal-grade cultivation technique!”

“This…”

Zhuge Yueyue’s heart trembled when she heard this. She even suspected that she had heard wrongly. Teacher was actually going to teach her an immortal-grade cultivation technique?

Would that make her like her second sister? Could she really master something that powerful?
