Chapter 257: The Tower Of Heaven Has Disappeared?

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

In Shangguan Wan’er’s memories from her previous life, the Tower of Heaven was an extremely terrifying magical artifact.

If she could obtain the Tower of Heaven, it would greatly boost her strength.

As such, she had made the trip here. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Compared to Shangguan Wan’er, most of the cultivators present were not thinking of obtaining the Tower of Heaven, but rather the two ranking lists.

“It’s said that there are various restrictions in order to enter the Tower of Heaven. I wonder if I can force my way in with my current strength,” Shangguan Wan’er muttered to herself.

According to the memories of her past life that she had awakened, the Tower of Heaven contained the legendary spatial intent.

If she could comprehend a supreme intent, then her strength would increase significantly.

As her strength increased, Shangguan Wan’er would regain more memories from her previous life, and perhaps even figure out her identity.

Buzzzzzz!

Spatial fluctuations rippled out, snapping her out of her thoughts.

The entrance had appeared!

Shangguan Wan’er was the first to enter.

Of course, with Shangguan Wan’er’s current strength, she could actually tear space apart and enter the mystic realm directly.

However, the Moon Demon mystic realm was situated in the middle of spatial turbulence, so its spatial connection with the outside world was not stable.

If Shangguan Wan’er forcefully tore space apart, it was very likely that the entire entrance to the secret realm would collapse instantly. Even she might not be able to leave if that happened.

Shangguan Wan’er also began to explore the mystic realm to see if she could find some rare heavenly treasures, especially those that could provide her the chance to experience an epiphany.

However, after two days, she found nothing, so she went straight to the Heavenly Lightning Pool.

After four days of comprehension, Shangguan Wan’er comprehended the embryonic form of heavenly lightning intent.

She was also the first expert to successfully do this after Ye Xuan. However, compared to Ye Xuan, she was still inferior. After all, Ye Xuan had comprehended the true heavenly lightning intent.

Of course, this also proved that Shangguan Wan’er’s comprehension value was extremely high.

“Did I comprehend supreme intents in my previous life?”

Shangguan Wan’er wondered to herself.

At this moment, the secret realm suddenly rippled with layers of mysterious spatial fluctuations!

The War God Hall had been activated!

Soon, everyone was teleported into the War God Hall’s internal space forcefully.

Buzzzzzz!

The cultivators immediately arrived at the War God Hall, which was a vast expanse of white.

However, moments later, countless cultivators were dumbfounded.

The Tower of Heaven had disappeared?

“What?”

Seeing this, Shangguan Wan’er could not help but narrow her eyes.

However, no matter how she used her spiritual sense to sweep the area, she could not find any traces of the Tower of Heaven.

The Tower of Heaven had really disappeared!

According to the rumors, the greatest opportunity in this mystic realm was the Tower of Heaven. Could it be that the rumors were false?

Everyone’s hearts were filled with doubt.

Other cultivators might be unsure about this, but it was different for cultivators from the Divine Gate Holy Land.

Many of their talented cultivators had entered the mystic realm before, so they had seen the Tower of Heaven before.

Yet what was going on now?

How did the Tower of Heaven disappear?

Now, it seemedthat there were no more opportunities in the War God Hall!

Many cultivators had prepared for a long time in advance in order to get a good ranking. However, it was destined to be a distant dream.

Looking at the white space, Shangguan Wan’er fell silent.

Did someone claim ownership of the Tower of Heaven?

Who could do something like this?

Was there another reincarnation of an ancient almighty expert?

Shangguan Wan’er fell into a state of deep thought.

Although the Tower of Heaven was not exactly necessary in the long run, it would have increased her current strength significantly.

She was a powerful pattern condensation realm expert, and thanks to the memories from her previous life, she knew that this realm was an extremely important one on the path of cultivation, and would determine how far she could go further in the future.

In the part of her memories that she had awakened, Shangguan Wan’er was vaguely aware of the reason why she had chosen to reincarnate and re-cultivate.

She wanted to reach the great circle of the pattern condensation realm.

Only by doing so would her future cultivation be smooth, and she would be able to go further down the path of cultivation.

After all, the pattern condensation realm was rather peculiar, as cultivators used their comprehension of martial intents to engrave the natural laws onto their bodies.

In layman’s terms, it was to use the cultivator’s physical body as a container to house the power of the natural laws and express it.

According to the rumors, if one wanted to reach the great circle of the pattern condensation realm, one had to engrave ten mysterious patterns on one’s physical body.

However, throughout the ages, there had not been any records of cultivations who managed to achieve this feat.

Even the legendary ancient experts could only engrave nine patterns.
