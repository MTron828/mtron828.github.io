892 Ou Yunhai Arrives

Hearing this voice, the crowd immediately quieted down. Everyone raised their heads and looked over.

Moments later, an elegant young man in blue appeared. The man had a confident smile on his face, and everyone could not help but gasp.

“Sealed immortal realm!”

“The Saint of the Heavenly Wind Divine sect, Ou Yunhai, has already reached the sealed immortal realm?”

At this moment, everyone knew that the situation had changed. The presence of a sealed immortal realm expert here meant that things had been kicked up a notch.

However, why was he here?

Ou Yunhai’s eyes were filled with ridicule as he looked at Feng Xiyun.

“Who exactly are you?” Feng Xiyun asked nervously. After all, she could clearly sense that the person in front of her was very powerful.

The aura this man was emitting felt rather similar to the aura she felt from her teacher, so she knew he was a sealed immortal realm expert.

Unexpectedly, before the reinforcements of the lightning tiger race even showed up, a sealed immortal realm expert made a sudden appearance.

Moreover, this expert was obviously not friendly toward her.

“Are you talking about me?”

Ou Yunhai smiled coldly. The memories of the scene when Ye Xuan humiliated him flashed through his mind, inciting his fury.

“Hahaha, you don’t have to know who I am, but there’s one thing you have to understand, which is that your teacher still owes me an old debt!”

“This…”

After hearing this, the faces of the forces of the Great Wilderness Divine ect changed drastically.

“Damn it! This person actually has a grudge with our Sword Elder. If I’m not wrong, we’re in trouble.”

“Only Martial Uncle Ye can deal with such a terrifying expert. Even if we attack together, it’s useless.”

“Martial Uncle Lu, what should we do now?”

The atmosphere at the scene was particularly solemn. Everyone wanted to hear what Lu Xiu planned to do.

However, he was at a loss. He had only recently reached the supreme realm, and was not even capable of fighting Feng Xiyun, much less Ou Yunhai.

“This time, we are in trouble…”

The one who remained calm was Feng Xiyun. When she found out that this person had a grudge with her teacher, her heart became exceptionally calm.

At such a critical moment, nervousness would not help her at all. Instead, it would drag her down. It was precisely because of this that she had to maintain her composure. Otherwise, there would be no way to resolve this situation.

Seeing that they had all quieted down and were silently panicking, Ou Yunhai laughed mockingly.

“Haha, there’s no need to be so anxious. I won’t stoop so low as to deal with a junior. I will deal with Ye Xuan personally!”

No matter what, the people of the eight continents were all watching. If he really made a move, he would be seen as shameless.

People would talk behind his back, saying that he could not defeat Ye Xuan, which was why he went after his disciple instead.

Ou Yunhai still had a reputation to keep.

After hearing this, the cultivators of the Great Wilderness Divine sect relaxed somewhat, but were then promptly reminded, “Although I won’t attack you, you should start thinking about how to deal with that fellow.”

“That fellow?”

Everyone was very puzzled to hear this, but moments later, rolling black clouds appeared over the distant horizon, and a terrifying aura swept across the East Sea.

Judging from this aura, it was obvious that this person had reached the peak of the ancient realm.

“Who exactly is this?”

“Is that the leader of the lightning tiger clan, Shan Hai?”

At this moment, everyone’s expressions changed drastically. Shan Hai was the leader of the lightning tiger clan, and was also the father of the lightning tiger that Feng Xiyun had just killed.

“He came so quickly.”

After learning of this person’s identity, Feng Xiyun’s heart trembled slightly. It seemed that trouble just kept coming.

The huge lightning tiger hovered in the sky and shouted hysterically, “Who killed my son? If you have the guts, show yourself!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Shan Hai swept his cold gaze across the ground below. Wherever his gaze passed, everyone involuntarily lowered their heads, not daring to meet his gaze. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Shan Hai’s heart was already burning with rage. He had only disappeared for a moment, but when he woke up, he realized that his treasured son was gone!

This son of his was the successor chosen by the ancestor, and the hope of the clan, yet he had actually been killed!

He wanted to tear the murderer to pieces, no matter who or what force was supporting the culprit.

After hearing Shan Hai’s furious roar, Feng Xiyun ignored Lu Xiu’s advice and slowly stepped forward.
