353 Ascension, The System Is Sleeping

“I’ve finally succeeded!”

The ancient black dragon’s massive body trembled, and its eyes were filled with excitement.

Moments later, the ancient black dragon transformed into a cold-looking man. His human form was undoubtedly more convenient to travel through the realm passageway.

“As expected! Those old things have noticed it!”

Suddenly, a sneer appeared on the ancient black dragon’s face. His spiritual sense detected many auras rushing in his direction.

However, it was too late. The realm passage was just in front of him.

Following that, the ancient black dragon’s figure suddenly disappeared. He turned into a streak of light that charged toward the realm passageway.

However, right at this moment, an invisible force suddenly descended and confined the ancient black dragon’s body.

“What?”

The ancient black dragon’s eyes narrowed and his expression changed.

A man in white suddenly appeared in his field of vision, smiling.

“I’ll kindly accept your opportunity!”

It was obviously Ye Xuan.

“Human, how dare you!”

The ancient black dragon’s eyes widened in rage, and his eyes were filled with unwillingness.

However, Ye Xuan’s figure suddenly disappeared into the realm passageway. At the same time, the bright door closed.

“Damn it!”

Only the unwilling roar of the ancient black dragon could be heard in the distance.

…

As soon as Ye Xuan entered the realm passageway, he suddenly felt a mysterious force descend upon him.

Sensing this, his spiritual sense and the power of his martial intents surged forth, creating a barrier to protect him.

However, the power of the realm passageway was so terrifying that cracks appeared on Ye Xuan’s energy barrier in no time at all.

At the same time, a system notification rang out in Ye Xuan’s mind.

“Ding! The host’s ascension to the upper world has been detected. Currently analyzing the upper world’s cultivation system and spiritual energy!”

“Ding! As the host has yet to comprehend and fuse the ten supreme intents, the system will forcefully merge with all of the host’s power to preserve the host’s life!”

“Ding! Energy fusion is in progress.”

“Ding! The energy fusion was successful. The host’s current cultivation realm is now the mystic meridian realm! (The upper world is known as the mystic world and is considered a middle plane. There are countless smaller outer worlds below this middle plane, of which the Tianyuan continent is one of them)”

“Ding! As for the other cultivation realms of the mystic world, the host is encouraged to discover them on his own!”

“Ding! As the host forcefully ascended to the upper world, the system will proceed with the interplanar energy fusion!” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Ding! The interplanar energy fusion will consume a large amount of energy. During this period, the system will be dormant. The exact period of dormancy remains unknown!”

As soon as the system’s notifications finished, Ye Xuan’s expression changed. He had not expected there to be so much trouble ascending to the upper world.

At the same time, the power of the martial intents that Ye Xuan had comprehended and the power of his spiritual sense suddenly merged, transforming into a new power that successfully resisted the terrifying pressure of the realm passageway.

At this moment, a strong suction force suddenly appeared from the end of the realm passageway, pulling Ye Xuan in.

…

The mystic world!

East Continent, Great Wilderness Divine sect, Plane Ascendance Shrine.

In the shrine, there were nine pillars engraved with dragons. These nine pillars formed a mysterious formation.

At this moment, the dim formation suddenly lit up.

“Eh?”

A surprised voice suddenly rang out in the shrine, followed by a flash of light, which revealed the figure of a white-robed old man.

The old man’s hair and beard were all white as well.

“This is the long-sealed plane ascendance shrine of our sect. It has been millions of years since anyone from the lower planes ascended here. Why would it activate now?”

The old man immediately examined the formation, and the surprise in his eyes grew.

“Tianyuan continent? Which lower plane was that? Why have I never heard of it?”

As the light from the mysterious formation grew brighter and brighter, a young man’s figure slowly appeared.

This person was Ye Xuan.

As soon as Ye Xuan appeared, he sensed the rich spiritual energy of his surroundings, and his body started to greedily devour it.

“Is this the mystic world?” Ye Xuan muttered to himself.

“Congratulations, little friend, for ascending to the mystic world!”

At this moment, an old voice suddenly rang out in Ye Xuan’s ears.

As soon as he finished speaking, the figure of the white-robed old man suddenly appeared in front of Ye Xuan.

“And you are?” Seeing this, Ye Xuan’s eyes narrowed slightly, and a hint of wariness flashed across his eyes.

After ascending to the mystic world, the density of the spiritual energy had changed, and the cultivation realms here were different too.

His cultivation level, which was originally unrivaled on the Tian Yuan continent, was now the mystic meridian realm, which was the lowest cultivation realm in the mystic world!

At least for now, he could not sense the white-haired old man’s cultivation level.

“Little friend, don’t panic. This is the ascendance shrine of the Great Wilderness Divine sect!”

“When one ascends from a lower plane, one will randomly appear in one of the various ascendance shrines in the mystic world. Coincidentally, you’ve appeared in the territory of my Great Wilderness Divine sect,” the white-haired old man said with a smile.

“Let me introduce myself. I’m Tian Xuan, one of the seven chiefs of the Great Wilderness Divine sect!

“The Great Wilderness Divine sect? Tian Xuan?” Hearing this, Ye Xuan could not help but raise his eyebrows slightly, a hint of doubt and confusion flashing across his eyes.

“Confusion is normal. After all, you’ve just ascended!”

Tian Xuan sensed his confusion.

“Don’t worry, I’ll give you a brief run-down of the general situation of the mystic world.”

“The mystic world is a middle plane in the myriad worlds. It is divided into five major continents. Besides the central continent, there are four other continents, East, West, South, and North. The place where we are currently is the East continent.”

After that, Tian Xuan explained the other aspects of the mystic world to Ye Xuan in detail.
