546 Ou Yunhai (Part 4)

‘Fake! That is definitely fake!’

Ou Yunhai was completely dumbfounded. He stared blankly at the huge sword that had condensed above the heaven devouring divine sparrow.

The sword intent that the huge sword emitted far exceeded the saber intent within his own attack earlier. There was no comparison at all.

In the next moment, he seemed to have realized what was going on. His face turned pale in disbelief.

Ye Xuan had actually mastered an immortal-grade divine power!

“Brother Ou Yunhai, don’t blink. I’ll show you something truly wonderful,” Ye Xuan said with a smile. Then he raised his right hand and waved it down almost ceremoniously.

The moment he did, the huge sword instantly descended upon the heave devouring divine sparrow.

Seeing this, the heaven devouring divine sparrow was terrified and launched a frenzied attack, trying to throw Ye Xuan’s aim off.

After seeing that everything it did was in vain, it tried to devour the attack instead. However, that was clearly a pipe dream. How could an attack of this level be devoured so easily?

Boom!

The huge sword came slashing down without any resistance. The heaven devouring divine sparrow’s huge body was also cut into pieces at this moment, and its blood stained the sky.

At this moment, the surroundings fell silent once again.

After some time, the people finally came back to their senses.

“Oh my god…”

“This young man is too abnormal.”

“He didn’t even use his sword. A single wave of his hand was enough to leave the heaven devouring divine sparrow in such a state.”

“If we were on the receiving end, it would have been even more tragic.”

All of the cultivators present jumped up in shock at those words. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Even the assassin leader looked at Ye Xuan seriously, now treating him as his strongest rival.

Ou Yunhai’s face was completely drained of blood. It was as if he had suffered a heavy blow.

Ye Xuan’s combat prowess was far greater than he had ever imagined. This man who Yanran chose was definitely extraordinary. Seeing the attack that Ye Xuan had just launched, he knew that even he would not be able to handle that attack.

In such a situation, was it really possible to get Yanran back in the future?

At this moment, he felt humiliated.

After Ye Xuan finished dealing with the heaven devouring divine sparrow, he turned his gaze to Ou Yunhai and touched the back of his head in embarrassment.

“This heaven devouring divine sparrow was quite weak, and I accidentally sent it on its way so easily.”

“I’m sure that Brother Ou was slacking off just now and didn’t use your full strength. Otherwise, he should have been able to kill it with one strike easily.”

As soon as he finished speaking, all of the onlookers at the scene began to laugh.

“This young man really has a talent for kicking people while they’re down,” Mo Yunhai stroked his beard and laughed.

Ye Xuan’s words made Ou Yunhai want to find a crack and hide in it.

The two of them had only used one move, but the result was completely different. It was immediately obvious who was stronger and who was weaker.

“Pfft…”

After hearing Ye Xuan’s words, Ou Yunha spat out a mouthful of blood.

He had been waiting to mock Ye Xuan, but had been mocked ruthlessly instead.

Ye Xuan did not care at all. Although he could sense Ou Yunhai’s infuriated gaze, he continued to poke and prod.

“Little Ran, don’t tell anyone about what you just saw.”

“Ou Yunhai is the Saint of the Heavenly Wind Divine sect. He’s a peerless genius and the sect has high hopes for him.”

“If news of this were to spread, the outside world would probably think that his reputation is worthless.”

“We have to help him protect his dignity, and leave him a way out.”

When she heard Ye Xuan’s serious words, Yanran could not hold it in and laughed.

Ye Xuan was too funny.

Even though he told her not to spread it, he was clearly not keeping his voice down. It turned out that her boyfriend was quite mean.

After hearing that, Ou Yunhai spat out another mouthful of blood.

His originally handsome face was now deathly pale, and he looked extremely pitiful. That being said, Ye Xuan felt quite satisfied by this outcome.

“Okay, I’ll listen to you,” Yanran replied after calming down. Then, she looked at Ou Yunhai and said seriously, “Saint Ou, don’t you worry. I’m not the kind of person to spread rumors, okay?”

“Uh…”

At this moment, Ou Yunhai spat out a few mouthfuls of blood and fainted.

Ye Xuan’s words just now had already caused him a huge wound, so what Yanran said next was like pouring salt on his wound.

He had wanted to show off in front of Yanran, but had been ruthlessly humiliated instead.

“Damn it! This is so infuriating!”

“Ye Xuan, just you wait. This isn’t the end. I’ll make you understand the consequences of provoking me!”

Ou Yunhai glared at Ye Xuan as he muttered to himself. He really wanted to kill Ye Xuan.

Were it not for the current situation, he would have already made his move.

On the other side, after Ye Xuan finished mocking Ou Yunhai, he used his spiritual sense to examine the corpse of the heaven devouring divine sparrow, and a bone that was emitting a five-colored light soon floated over to him.
