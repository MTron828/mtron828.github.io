Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The atmosphere at the scene became even more solemn at this moment. Almost every expert was observing their potential rivals, and those who were famous and well-known attracted even more attention.

Among them, Zhuge Yueyue was also observing the situation. The Cloud Heaven Sword was already in her hand.

“First Sister, this pill is extraordinary. If we can obtain it, it will definitely help you reach the ancient realm.”

Feng Xiyun’s face was filled with warmth as she said this.Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Zhuge Yueyue obviously knew the effect of this pill, so she decided that she had to fight for it.

After all, she knew that Ye Xuan would likely ascend to the Heavenly Dao World soon. She had to catch up to him as soon as possible.

In this world, she had already lost her parents, and her teacher and fellow disciples were her family. Ever since she had become Ye Xuan’s disciple, her teacher had treated her like his own child, protecting her as she grew.

It was for this reason that she only wanted to stay by her teacher’s side to repay his kindness. However, now that she knew that he was about to leave to the Heavenly Dao World, she was very nervous about being left behind, and thus wanted to reach the sealed immortal realm as soon as possible and join him there.

As such, this pill was vital to that push to reach her goal. How could she miss this opportunity?

“Don’t worry. I’ll definitely get my hands on this pill!’

Zhuge Yueyue said this with a determined expression.

This was the first time Feng Xiyun had seen her senior sister show such an expression, so she cheered her on.

“First Sister, I believe that you can do it!”

After saying this, Feng Xiyun also began to mobilize her strength. Once she sensed that something was wrong, she would immediately rush to help Zhuge Yueyue.

Although the battle had yet to begin, the atmosphere at the scene had become even more tense as more people arrived.

“Hehe, no one has the guts to be the first to stand up? Since that’s the case, let me do it!”

After hearing this voice, a red light instantly appeared in the distance. A moment later, an extremely evil-looking man showed up.

“Chi Lian from the Fire Clan?”

Upon seeing his arrival, the crowd started whispering to each other, secretly assessing him. Chi Lian then said loudly, “Who dares to come and spar with me? Hurry up and come up!’

There was only silence, and no one made any moves.

Just as Chi Lian was about to conclude that everyone present was afraid of him, a golden figure appeared in front of him.

“Haha, ignorant fellow, you actually dared to behave so arrogantly up here. Get lost immediately!’

As soon as the newcomer said that, a terrifying light flashed, pushing Chi Lian back a hundred meters. This shocked the other cultivators.

“Oh my god, the golden tiger is here too!”

This was the ovvner of a noble bloodline that only existed in legends. They did not expect him to actually appear here, as he was also one of the most powerful geniuses. Some people even predicted that he would definitely surpass his ancestors in the future and become a powerful peerless expert.

After the arrival of this person, the scene has become more and more lively, especially after seeing him easily brush off Chi Lian. From this, they could already tell how powerful he was.

“Hiss…”

“The competition this time is destined to be difficult.”

This was not only a fight over the pill, but also a battle of dignity between different bloodlines. In the distance, Chi Lian spat out a mouthful of blood, his eyes filled with fear.

Even Zhuge Yueyue was a little worried as she thought to herself, “This little kitten’s combat strength has increased so quickly.”

At this moment, she felt that the burden on her shoulders had become much heavier. After all, she had seen the strength of this golden tiger when he first came to the East Sea.

The battle prowess that he could unleash was at most not much different from that of the Lightning Tiger. However, it seemed that he had obtained an extremely heaven-defying opportunity after that, which had resulted in the growth of his battle prowess.

Zhuge Yueyue was not fully confident in her ability to defeat this golden tiger.

At this moment, the golden tiger was looking down at the cultivators below while exuding a majestic aura.

He suddenly let out a tiger roar, causing the world to tremble and frightening many people.

Many disciples were so frightened that their faces turned pale, and they did not dare to make a sound at all. It seemed that he had successfully intimidated everyone.

When Zhuge Yueyue saw that the situation was not right, she could not stand it anymore and immediately wanted to make a move, but at this moment, another red light instantly shot over, causing the temperature of the surroundings to rise significantly.

Following that was a loud and clear cry. When they turned to look in the direction of the cry, they saw a flaming divine bird.

“Oh my god, could this be a descendant of the Fiery Phoenix?”

Everyone was shocked once more. What was going on today?

The appearance of the golden tiger was already very shocking, but now there was actually a descendant of a divine beast?

This was a descendant of an ancient fire phoenix. Furthermore, its bloodline was extremely pure.

“This is interesting. Even a descendant of the Fiery Phoenix has arrived. There will be a good show to watch in this competition.” After seeing all this, Feng Xiyun became excited..
