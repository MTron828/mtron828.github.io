392 Saved By A Lady

“What should we do now?” Feng Xiyun’s forehead was covered in cold sweat and her heart was filled with panic.

“Your Highness, don’t panic. Quickly take the carriage and leave. I’ll deal with the Red Hell Snake!”

Xin’er’s eyes were resolute as she spoke.

Although she knew that she was no match for the Red Hell Snake, the princess’s safety was more important than anything else.

Xin’er had been sent to the imperial palace by her family since she was young. Not only was she Feng Xiyun’s maidservant, but she had also grown up with her and were basically like sisters, which is why Feng Xiyun had brought her along.

!!

Now that her sister was in danger, she had to act!

“Your Highness, hurry up and leave!”

Xin’er took out the sword hidden in the carriage and walked down with a determined look in her eyes..

However, Feng Xiyun did not choose to run away. Instead, she smiled.

The panic in her eyes was gone as well.

“Xin’er, you and I are like sisters. How can I abandon you?”

“Besides, this Red Hell Snake is extremely venomous and fast. Unless we kill it, we won’t be able to escape.”

Although she was about to face death, Feng Xiyun did not feel the slightest ounce of regret.

Instead of staying in the palace and finally submitting to the fate decided for her by the imperial family, death was a release for her.

“Xin’er, you’re a ninth-level mystic meridian realm cultivator. If you go all out and escape, you might have a chance.” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Hurry up and leave! Don’t worry about me,” Feng Xiyun said to Xin’er.

She was an ordinary mortal, so it was impossible for her to escape. It was better for Xin’er to try and escape. At least she would have a chance.

“No! How could I abandon you, Your Highness?!”

“No matter what the outcome is, I will always be by your side to protect you!”

Looking at the Red Hell Snake that was flicking its tongue continuously, Xin’er’s sword trembled uncontrollably. However, her eyes were filled with determination.

Whoosh!

At this moment, a strange red light flashed across the eyes of the Red Hell Snake. Then, its body moved nimbly and rapidly toward them.

Xin’er’s expression was solemn. She poured all of the power in her body into the sword in her hand, preparing to seize the opportunity to slash the snake.

However, at this moment, a bright white light suddenly fell from the sky and landed on the snake’s body.

“Ah?”

Originally, when the Red Hell Snake launched its attack, Feng Xiyun had already closed her eyes tightly and was prepared to welcome death. However, she suddenly noticed a beautiful figure descending from the sky.

Feng Xiyun raised her head and looked up. This woman seemed to have a naturally cold temperament, and was holding a longsword as she hovered in the air. She looked like a sword immortal!

Feng Xiyun’s eyes lit up. Someone had come to their rescue. They were saved.

She heaved a sigh of relief and a smile appeared on her face.

There were many cultivators from the various holy lands around the East continent. This woman must have sensed the aura of a berserk beast and rushed over.

After being stabbed by the cold sword qi, the Red Hell Snake displayed a pained expression, and the crimson light in its eyes became even more intense.

It was obvious that it was enraged.

It flicked its tongue and stared at Zhuge Yueyue. Moments later, it spat out a mouthful of flames.

Seeing this, Zhuge Yueyue’s expression did not change at all. The Cloud Sky sword in her hand suddenly began to spin, and her sword qi easily blocked its flames.

After that, the Cloud Sky sword vibrated as her sword qi ruthlessly struck the Red Hell Snake.

Buzzzzzz!

The sharp sword qi immediately left a few deep wounds on the snake’s body, frightening it into fleeing.

However, Zhuge Yueyue would not give it the opportunity to escape.

Although the Red Hell Snake in front of her was not particularly strong, it was her first true opponent. This was also the test her teacher had set for her.

“Do you think you can escape?”

The spiritual power in her body gushed out, and her speed suddenly increased. Then, she flew toward the Red Hell Snake.

At the same time, the Cloud Sky sword in Zhuge Yueyue’s hand surged with sword qi, and she began to fight fiercely with the snake.

At this moment, a gentle breeze blew past.

A handsome young man in white had appeared beside the carriage. He was watching the battle between Zhuge Yueyue and the Red Hell Snake with interest.

Feng Xiyun’s expression changed when she saw this.

However, when she saw the handsome man’s outfit, her eyes lit up.

‘Dressed in white, has a lotus flower pendant, and is accompanied by a beautiful young lady.’

‘He matches the description. Is it really him?’

Was her luck that great? She had just been talking about him with Xin’er not too long ago.

“Might you be Chief Ye Xuan from the Great Wilderness Divine sect?”

Feng Xiyun took off her white veil with a smile and asked in an elegant tone.

Hearing this, Ye Xuan glanced at Feng Xiyun with some doubt.

“Mm! Could it be that you’ve heard of me?”

It was really Ye Xuan!

Feng Xiyun was inwardly overjoyed.

She immediately did a double take.

This guy was exactly as the rumors had described. He was dressed in white clothes, and he was really handsome.

After that, Feng Xiyun smiled elegantly and said, “Chief Ye Xuan’s fame has spread within the East continent recently. Your feats of defeating two heaven realm experts with a single sword strike, and your acquisition of the ape beast’s precious bone, has shocked the East continent.””

“When I first heard the news, I had hoped to meet you one day. However, I didn’t expect to meet you so soon. It really is my good fortune.”
