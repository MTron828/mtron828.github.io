398 Early-Stage Mystic Lord Realm Cultivator

The golden patterns on the surface of his skin glowed brighter and brighter, and soon covered his entire body. It even seemed like a true dragon was roaring.

“True Dragon Body?”

Ye Xuan was shocked.

He had not expected that refining and absorbing the power of the true dragon’s precious bone would actually result in him obtaining the True Dragon Body.

The golden light also started to refine his spiritual power, making it purer.

His face was full of excitement.

Every cell and every pore in his body seemed to contain immense power,, and his bones and muscles were faintly flowing with golden divine light.

Ye Xuan had never felt so powerful before. Now, even his physical strength would have been enough to end the lives of those two Xia family heaven realm cultivators from back then.

However, this was not the end. The mysterious power of the true Dragon’s precious bone slowly merged into Ye Xuan’s five spirit seas. The Golden Lotus of the Great Dao hidden deep within his body also shone with brilliant divine light, as if guiding this power to form a Dao fruit in the spirit seas.

Ye Xuan had now reached the peak of the heaven realm, and was on the verge of reaching the mystic lord realm.

As long as a Dao fruit was formed in one’s spirit seas, one would be able to advance to the mystic lord realm. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

At this moment, Zhuge Yueyue and Xin’er finally returned.

The two women had successfully hunted a giant wolf, and were about to start roasting it. Then, they noticed a Dao flower condensing above Ye Xuan’s head.

The spiritual energy in the surroundings suddenly started swirling toward Ye Xuan, forming a whirlwind that made it impossible for others to approach.

Zhuge YueYue and Xin’er’s expressions changed when they saw this.

“Teacher, what’s going on?”

Zhuge Yueyue looked at Ye Xuan, who was in the center of the whirlwind, with a worried expression.

Right at this moment, Feng Xiyun, who had been cultivating, was also jolted awake by the commotion. She looked in Ye Xuan’s direction with a shocked expression.

“Could it be that Teacher is about to breakthrough?:

“Junior Sister, what happened to Teacher?”

Seeing this, Zhuge Yueyue hurriedly helped Feng Xiyun up and asked nervously.

Although Feng Xiyun was very shocked, she quickly calmed down.

“If I’m not wrong, Teacher seems to be breaking through to the next realm. He described this phenomenon to me earlier.”

“Breaking through?”

When Zhuge Yueyue heard this, she was stunned.

‘Teacher is already a heaven realm expert. If he’s breaking through now, won’t that make him a mystic lord realm cultivator?’

‘This is unbelievable. Teacher is so young. How did he break through to the mystic lord realm so quickly?’

Zhuge Yueyue’s eyes were filled with disbelief. The two mystic lord realm cultivators in the Great Wilderness Divine sect were old men who were hundreds of years older than Ye Xuan!

Furthermore, the other chiefs, who were also considerably older than Ye Xuan, had yet to break through to the mystic lord realm.

On the other hand, Feng Xiyun was smiling happily.

“Senior Sister, from today onward, we will have the backing of a mystic lord realm expert!”

“When we return to the Great Wilderness Divine sect, no one will dare to look down on us!”

“En!” Hearing this, Zhuge Yueyue also smiled and nodded.

She knew in her heart that Ye Xuan was extremely protective of his disciple, and would not allow them to be bullied.

Earlier, Zhuge Yueyue had been worried that Ye Xuan would become the target of the Xia family’s revenge. After all, he had severely injured two of their heaven realm experts and embarrassed Charlot.

However, now that Ye Xuan was breaking through, such worries were gone with the wind. There was no longer a need to fear the Xia family. Even the king of a divine empire had to treat a mystic lord realm cultivator with respect.

This thought especially excited Feng Xiyun. Even if her father found out that she was in the Great Wilderness Divine sect, it was likely that he would restrain his actions.

‘That’s great! I’m one step closer to escaping my fate.’

Hopefully, she would be able to cultivate under Ye Xuan’s tutelage in peace and do what she liked.

After a long time, the center of the surging spiritual energy slowly calmed down.

The Dao flower above Ye Xuan’s head bloomed brightly and then condensed into a Dao fruit filled with mysterious power.

However, this was only on the surface.

In reality, two spirit seas in Ye Xuan’s body had each formed a Dao fruit. In addition, there was a mysterious flower on top of each Dao fruit.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan narrowed his eyes.

Because Ye Xuan had the Golden Lotus of the Great Dao in his body, and had refined the precious bone of the true dragon, the path of cultivation he walked was an invincible path that was one in a million.

After sensing the changes in his body, Ye Xuan was brimming with excitement.

Perhaps he could really end the human race’s 10,000-year drought and become a legendary sealed immortal realm cultivator.

He had the system, so it was only appropriate for him to aim for the stars. In any case, that was a story for the future.

After successfully refining the power of the precious bone of the true dragon, Ye Xuan had successfully reached the mystic lord realm.

Once a cultivator stepped into the mystic lord realm, their cultivation would be divided into three minor realms.

At present, Ye Xuan was an early-stage mystic lord realm cultivator. However, because he had broken through too quickly, his cultivation foundation had not been completely stabilized.
