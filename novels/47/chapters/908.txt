909 Blood Race

After helping Yanran out of her predicament, Ye Xuan turned his attention back to the injured Shan Ling. The fury in his heart was reignited.

This shameless thing had almost hurt his woman and two disciples, and had to be made to pay the price. At the same time, he also felt grateful that Yanran had managed to make it in time to save his disciples.

Otherwise, he would have lost them.

He stared at Shan Ling, and could clearly sense that the latter was still alive. After some time, a huge rumble came from the East Sea, causing the surroundings to tremble.

Moments later, rolling black clouds filled the sky. Terrifying lightning bolts struck down continuously.

Everyone’s hearts started to tremble, as they could sense a terrifying aura pressing down on them gradually.

“The show is about to begin again.”

In the sky, a black beam descended and fused into Shan Ling’s body, causing his life force to recover.

Waves of energy continued to surge through his body, healing the injuries that Ye Xuan had inflicted almost instantly.

A loud roar was heard from the bottom of the sea as Shan Ling rushed out again, his eyes bloodshot.

At this moment, it was as if he had become a real demon. He released his bloodthirsty aura that contained nothing but pure killing intent.

“Oh? Why is there a demonic aura now?”

After discovering this situation, Ye Xuan was momentarily stunned. He was no stranger to this type of aura, as he had fought someone with it before…

Mengyu…

Ye Xuan looked at Shan Ling with curiosity.

“This is interesting. As a descendant of a divine beast, he actually submitted to the demon race?”

Ye Xuan smiled as he imagined how furious the lightning tiger’s progenitor would be to see this scene. Their progenitor might even crawl out of his tomb and teach his descendants a lesson.

Everyone was looking at Shan Ling in disbelief. Demonic aura?

“What exactly happened? Why is there a bloodthirsty aura around his body?”

“I’m not sure either. Generally speaking, the lightning tiger clan has an extremely pure ancient bloodline. There’s no reason for them to succumb to the demonic path, right?”

After the great war in ancient times, almost all of the demonic cultivators had disappeared. Mengyu was the only one left in the eight continents, but she had already left the world with Daoist Yi Feng.

Originally, they all thought that the ferocious demon race had been eradicated and confined to the history books, but now Shan Ling had somehow become a demon?

Could it be that there were demons in the Heavenly Dao World?

That was where the black beam had come from, right?

While all this was happening, Yanran was watching Shan Ling closely.

When she focused her gaze, she discovered something unusual about the situation.

After calming herself down, she said, “Ye Xuan, he’s not a demon, but a member of the blood race.”

“Blood race?”

This was the first time he had heard this name.

Yanran quickly continued, “If I remember correctly, the last time my consciousness roamed the Nine Heavens, some seniors from the Heavenly Dao World told me of a time when the world was filled with a bloodthirsty aura.”

“In the ancient chaotic era, the blood race, which claimed to be from the Eighteen Hells, took the lead in causing conflicts, resulting in countless bloody battles.”

“They have to devour blood to cultivate, which is why they release a bloodthirsty aura.”

As battles broke out everywhere, they were able to devour much blood, and at the same time absorb the bloodlines of those they slew, gradually transforming themselves into peerless experts.”

“However, the experts of the Heavenly Dao World banded together in time to eliminate them, and the remaining experts of the blood race were sealed in the Netherworld and disappeared from then on.”

After hearing Yanran’s words, Ye Xuan still had questions.

Why would this demonic aura appear from Shan Ling’s body?

Could it be that Shan Ling was somehow connected to the blood race? If so, that would explain why he was now displaying the unique characteristics of a member of the blood race.

“Interesting. The blood race? This world has really become more interesting…” Ye Xuan muttered to himself.

However, there was no fear in his heart, only anticipation. To him, whether it was the blood race, demon race, or strange monsters, they were all just enemies to be defeated and killed.

The sky was already filled with a dense bloodthirsty aura, and the strong stench of blood in the air caused some people to involuntarily throw up. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Hehehe!”

Shan Ling laughed out loud. His blood-red eyes were extremely terrifying.

At this moment, Ye Xuan frowned slightly. It seemed that Shan Ling had surpassed the sealed immortal realm.

“Could it be that even the laws of the world are unable to restrain him?”

Ye Xuan was very surprised by this.
