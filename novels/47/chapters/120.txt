Chapter 121: Terrifying Aura

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“These two idiots!”

Seeing this scene, the leader of the Mad Saber sect swore.

At this moment, a streak of resplendent sword qi suddenly lit up the sky. Like a shooting star, it descended on Lin Baimo and Huang Hongcheng.

Whoosh!

The streak of sword qi instantly destroyed them.

“Humph! Who would have thought that my, Ye Xuan’s, words would be taken lightly in Yang City?”

Ye Xuan’s voice rang out again.

Hearing this, everyone shook in their boots and drew deep breaths.

Ye… Ye Xuan?

That person just now was Ye Xuan?

Soon enough, everyone’s shock transformed into fanaticism.

Ye Xuan was a legend in the Great Qian Dynasty. His talent and strength had made him invincible here, and he was idolized by countless young cultivators.

Everyone revealed excited expressions. They had not expected to encounter the famed Ye Xuan.

Although Ye Xuan did physically appear, it did not put a damper on their excitement.

“Oh my God! I’m actually staying in the same city as the number one expert of the Great Qian Dynasty. This is such a blessing!”

Numerous young cultivators were starstruck, and yearned to see him in action.

They knew very well that this was not impossible either.

After all, once the Moon Demon mystic realm opened Ye Xuan would appear.

Not only were the young cultivators excited, the more powerful experts were also shocked, as they could better comprehend the power of the attack that Ye Xuan unleashed.

To them, even if everyone in the city combined forces, they would not be able to resist that one attack. In other words, if Ye Xuan wanted to, he could destroy the entire city with a single sword strike.

Once Ye Xuan killed those two seventh-level purple spirit realm experts, the originally chaotic Yang City ushered in a time of peace.

All of the cultivators who visited or stayed in the city did not dare to act recklessly. Even the crime rate among ordinary citizens fell drastically as bandits silently chose to behave themselves.

Even if a cultivator encountered a mortal enemy, they bottled up their anger and instead chose to live peacefully in Yang City.

There was nothing they could do. Throughout the entire Great Qian Dynasty, who did not know Ye Xuan’s name?

This big shot was a terrifying existence who had destroyed a top-ranked sect by himself. Who would dare to provoke him?

“You are quite famous!”

Seeing this, Lin Qing looked at Ye Xuan with a smile.

Moreover, Lin Qing could see the adoring gazes of the young cultivators, especially the female cultivators.

Thinking this, Lin Qing could not help but laugh.

Even if the current king of the Great Qian Dynasty appeared here, he might still be eclipsed by Ye Xuan.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan revealed a helpless expression.

By now, he had naturally heard the many stories and versions passed around in the cultivation world about his achievements. The degree of exaggeration was so great that even he could not help but blush.

Yue and Li Qingyan chuckled. They had never seen their teacher in such an awkward situation.

“Ahem!”

Ye Xuan quickly coughed and calmed himself down, though his face was still slightly red. He then turned his gaze toward Li Qingyan.

“You should continue to cultivate. By the way, come to my room tonight. I have something good prepared for you!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Lin Qingyan’s face froze and became as red as an apple.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan suddenly realized that something was not right with what he had said.

In reality, he just wanted to simply perform spiritual power infusion on Li Qingyan. After all, it had been a month since he last did so, so the time was ripe to reap more system rewards.

“Ahem… I will help you consolidate your cultivation!” Ye Xuan said with a thick face.

“Okay!”

Li Qingyan’s small hands gripped the corner of her clothes tightly.

…

When night fell, Li Qingyan went over to Ye Xuan’s room.

“Teacher!” Li Qingyan gently knocked on the door.

Come in,” Ye Xuan replied.

Then, Li Qingyan pushed open the door and walked in. Following Ye Xuan’s instructions she sat down cross-legged on the mat.

Moments later, Ye Xuan waved his hand and set up an array formation to conceal his aura.

Ye Xuan’s spiritual power surged out and slowly flowed into Li Qingyan’s dantian, helping the latter condense her purple mansion.

The purple spirit realm was when a cultivator condensed and forged their purple mansion in their dantian. The gap between each minor realm was significant, and even genius cultivators might find it difficult to bridge the gap between minor realms.

As Ye Xuan infused his spiritual power into Li Qingyan, she began to break through.

Previously, Li Qingyan had become an alchemist with Ye Xuan’s help. At the same time, she had activated her dual-spirit physique, and her innate bone value had been greatly strengthened.

Therefore, Li Qingyan was already able to bear more of Ye Xuan’s spiritual power.

Second-level purple spirit realm!

Third-level purple spirit realm!

Fourth-level purple spirit realm!

…

It was not until Li Qingyan reached the ninth level of the purple spirit realm that Ye Xuan put a halt to the spiritual power infusion process.

Although Li Qingyan’s innate bone values and the strength of her physical body had been greatly improved, it was still limited. If he forcefully helped her break through to the core formation realm, it was very likely that her cultivation foundation would be damaged.

Ye Xuan cared about his two disciples very much. Naturally, he had to ensure that their future path of cultivation was smooth.

“Ding! As the host has infused 150 days’ worth of cultivation to his disciple, the host has received a randomized 56x critical reward. Congratulations! The house has obtained 8,400 days’ worth of cultivation!”

As the system’s notification rang out, Ye Xuan’s body suddenly shook. The aura around his body became even more majestic and profound.

His body underwent a qualitative change!

It was like a tide, endless, and also like the sky, vast and boundless!

Every cell in Ye Xuan’s body was like a heart, pumping with vigor. Every beat caused the energy each cell contained to fluctuate slightly!

In an instant, an incomparably terrifying aura instantly swept through Yang City, bypassing the array formation Ye Xuan had set up.

“What is this?”

“What on Earth is going on? Why does it feel like I’m being suppressed? It’s as if there’s an invisible force strangling my neck.”

Although this boundless aura only appeared for a moment before disappearing, the cultivators in Yang City knew very well that this was not their illusion.

Even at this moment, they could still recall the suffocating feeling!

Although it was only for a moment, it was as if they had walked through the gates of hell!
