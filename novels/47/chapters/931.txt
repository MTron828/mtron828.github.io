932 Watch And Learn

Looking at the Thunder-Devouring Beast’s anxious expression, Ye Xuan’s lips curled into a smile as he said with a smirk.

“Haha, since you have something to ask of me, as your big brother, I will definitely help you if I can.”

“You won’t understand it properly if I tell you, so I’ll perform it for you personally. You have to watch carefully later and grasp the trick.”

“Alright, Big Brother,” the Thunder-Devouring Beast replied. He was extremely excited.

He even thought to himself, ‘If I master Big Brother’s secret technique, then if I want to seduce others in the future, won’t it be easy? In that case, I have to seriously pay attention.’

The Thunder-Devouring Beast instantly adjusted his state of mind and focused himself, almost as if he was learning an extremely powerful cultivation technique.

On the other side, Ye Xuan took out the Scarlet Blood Spirit Fruit. After making some brief emotional preparations, a gentle smile appeared on his face.

Seeing him walk step by step over to Yanran, with a wide-eyed stalker in tow, the scene was quite a comical one.

Yanran did not understand what Ye Xuan was trying to do, but just as she was about to ask, Ye Xuan suddenly handed the Scarlet Blood Spirit Fruit to her.

“This…”

Yanran was stunned. What was going on?

She wanted to scold him, but she stopped herself before she could say anything. She could see that he was currently staring at her with a face full of affection. Immediately after, he held her other hand and placed it on top of the Scarlet Blood Spirit Fruit as well.

After doing all this, Ye Xuan said with a serious expression, “Yanran, I remember that I once mentioned to you that in this world, as long as you want something, I will get it for you even if I have to risk my life.”

“Fortunately, I didn’t let you down this time. I’ve already brought back the immortal heavenly treasure for you.”

After hearing this, everyone present was stunned.

“Oh my god, is Ye Xuan stupid? Why is he giving it away?”

“Such a precious heavenly treasure is valuable to us sealed immortal realm experts. Even eternal realm experts would fight over them! But he actually gave it away just like that?”

Everyone’s jaws dropped in shock. After all, this scene was really too unexpected. Could it be that courting your wife was more important than an immortal heavenly treasure?

Even Yanran was taken aback. Was her sweetheart really giving this to her?

She had originally taken what he said about giving it to her earlier as a joke, but it seemed that this was not the case.

“You… Are you serious?”

Staring blankly at the Scarlet Blood Spirit Fruit in her hand, Yanran still found it unbelievable.

“This can help you step into the eternal realm, but…”

Just as Yanran was about to continue, Ye Xuan laughed out loud, cutting her off.

Ye Xuan instantly pulled Yanran into his arms and looked at her pretty face with deep affection as he spoke.

“Yanran, I’ve already told you that nothing in this world can compare to you.” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“It’s just an immortal heavenly treasure. Even a chaos heavenly treasure can’t be compared to you.”

Hearing this, Yanran only felt her heart tremble violently and uncontrollably. Why was this fellow such a sweet-talker? But…

She liked it…

She liked being doted on by her sweetheart. It made her feel loved and treasured.

‘I really can’t take it anymore. His words are so sickly sweet, but I can’t help myself…’

Ye Xuan’s words were like a sledgehammer that was pounding on her heart.

It was as if at this moment, she and Ye Xuan had already become husband and wife, and they had experienced all of the vicissitudes of life together.

Staring at Ye Xuan’s eyes that were filled with deep affection, Yanran felt touched. This was her sweetheart, who would always do these things and gestures to make her heart happy and flutter.

At this moment, she liked and hated Ye Xuan at the same time. Her emotions were very complicated.

“Oh my god…”

While the two of them were looking at each other affectionately, a voice rang out.

Turning around, Yanran realized that the Thunder-Devouring Beast was staring at her intently. Her face could not help but turn red.

This little b*stard! Did he not understand that it was very unfriendly to stare at others so openly?

On the other side, the Thunder-Devouring Beast was not bothered by the fact that Yanran was staring at him. He seemed to have been enlightened and said with a serious expression, “I got it, I got it.”

“If you want to be liked by a girl, you have to have the mindset that you can’t bear to part with her, and that she is the number one thing in your life. Only then can you become her true sweetheart.”

The Thunder-Devouring Beast said this sentence in a logical manner. This was simply the best lesson!

If he copied his big brother, how could his future wife resist his charm?

As he thought about it, the Thunder-Devouring Beast became even more excited. Although he might be very slow when learning other things, when it came to learning how to flirt and capture hearts, he was a genius. He understood it from one glance.

“Haha, you’re really the best, Big Brother. Today, my eyes have finally been opened to the truth!”

The Thunder-Devouring Beast’s excitement was indescribable. He admired Ye Xuan from the bottom of his heart, and he could not wait to put what he had learnt into practice. Soon, it would be his turn to have a girl swooning in front of him.

Hearing the Thunder-Devouring Beast talking to itself, Yanran did not know what to say at this moment. She could only put on her cold expression once again.

Was this Thunder-Devouring Beast really the descendant of an ancient divine beast?

She originally wanted to question it, but Ye Xuan suddenly hugged her tightly and leaned in close to her neck to take a deep breath…
