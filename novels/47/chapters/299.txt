300 Time To Get Down To Business

“Ding! As the host has helped his disciple obtain 3650 days’ worth of cultivation, the host has obtained a randomized 3x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained 10,950 days’ worth of cultivation!”

“Ding! As the host has helped his disciple to strengthen her special constitution by 7x, the host has received a randomized 10x critical reward. Congratulations! The host’s special constitution has been strengthened 70x!”

“Ding! Thanks to the host’s help, his disciple’s sword intent has reached the second level. The host has received a randomized 1,880x critical reward. Congratulations! The host’s sword intent profound pattern has reached the second level!”

“Ding! Thanks to the host’s help, his disciple’s innate bone value has been increased by 40 points. The host has received a randomized 3x critical reward. Congratulations! The host’s innate bone value has been increased by 120 points!”

Ye Xuan’s strength had once again improved significantly.

After Yue’s sword jade body broke through to the great mastery stage, even her eyes seemed to contain sword qi.

Although Ye Xuan received a 120-point increase in his innate bone value, since his attributes had surpassed 700 points, the total reward was divided by five, resulting in a 24-point increase instead.

Of course, whether it was the reward for strengthening his special constitution or the improvement of his cultivation, both were based on Yue’s cultivation and special constitution, and not his own.

For example, the 10,000 days or so of cultivation boost was calculated based on Yue’s current cultivation speed.

Perhaps for Yue, this was a huge improvement, but Ye Xuan’s current cultivation level was comparable to a middle-stage Human King realm cultivator, so this cultivation boost did not have a significant effect on him.

It was the same for the strengthening of his special constitution. Still, it was faster than simply cultivating normally.

The most significant improvement was Yue comprehending second-level sword intent, which allowed Ye Xuan’s sword intent profound pattern to reach the second level.

“What a pity! I did not manage to reach the perfection stage with my Sword Overlord body.”

Ye Xuan sighed helplessly. However, it was not a big deal.

After that, he asked Yue to consolidate her cultivation foundation.

When she left, Ye Xuan took out a heavenly treasure that could strengthen one’s sword constitution. He would use the resources he had on hand to finish off what the system’s rewards had started.

Some time later, the Tower of Heaven was suddenly filled with terrifying and overbearing sword qi.

Buzzzzzz!

Ye Xuan’s tightly-shut eyes slowly opened. The aura he currently exuded made him seem like a divine sword that was capable of tearing the world asunder.

The Sword Overlord body had reached the perfection stage!Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

His domineering sword qi could easily tear the space apart and destroy large swathes of land.

When activated, golden bone armor surrounded his body, containing surging vitality.

In the eyes of other cultivators, Ye Xuan’s body was a moving treasure. His surging qi and blood essence was enough to create countless experts.

Moments later, Ye Xuan restrained his overbearing aura.

After all of this, Ye Xuan’s overall strength was no weaker than an early-stage Human King realm cultivator, despite the fact that he was only a pattern condensation realm expert.

“This is not my limit. I can still get stronger,” Ye Xuan muttered to himself.

“Cultivate well. When you’ve completely regained full control over your own power, I’ll perform spiritual power infusion for you again.”

Ye Xuan gave a few instructions, and then left the Tower of Heaven and returned to the Qingyun sect.

There, Ye Xuan gave some extra cultivation resources to the sect master, Wan Shanhai.

Thanks to Ye Xuan’s excess cultivation resources, the strength of the Qingyun sect had rapidly improved over the past few years.

“My precious disciple, hurry up. It’s time to get down to business!”

Shangguan Wan’er had been cultivating inside a concealing formation.

She was already used to how Ye Xuan addressed her, so she paid it no mind. After all, being his disciple did indeed make her feel precious.

A mere half a year had passed quickly for her.

Of course, during this half a year of cultivation, Shangguan Wan’er’s strength had improved much faster than before thanks to the cultivation methods and heavenly treasures Ye Xuan had given her.

All in all, the consensus between his disciples was that, as long as they followed Ye Xuan, their strength would increase by leaps and bounds.

As for the Luo Heaven Palace, Shangguan Wan’er did not feel like going back for now. The reason why she had established the Luo Heaven Palace was to search for cultivation resources and collect information on heavenly treasures.

With Ye Xuan around, the Luo Heaven Palace seemed to have lost its value.

It seemed that she had to go back to Luo Heaven Palace in the future and appoint a new palace master.

Unlike normal sects, the Luo Heaven Palace only accepted female cultivators. Instead of merging with the Qingyun sect, it would be better for them to be independent.

After that, Ye Xuan brought Shangguan Wan’er into the Tower of Heaven.

Just like before, he went through the motions of giving her all sorts of stuff.

Ye Xuan was not in a hurry to help Shangguan Wan’er improve her mastery of alchemy, formations, and artifact refining. Instead, he planned to use the power of the lightning bolts to temper her body.

“My precious disciple, I will use the thousands of lightning bolts formed by my heavenly lightning intent to temper your body,” Ye Xuan said.

“Ah, lightning bolts to temper my body? Teacher, please wait for me for a moment!”

When Shangguan Wan’er heard this, her face immediately turned red.
