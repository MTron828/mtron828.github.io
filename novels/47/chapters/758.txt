759 Supreme Divine Sect, Sudden Crisis!

Daoist Canghai was also looking in the direction of the Great Wilderness Divine sect from afar, his eyes full of shock.

Ye Xuan had fulfilled his teacher’s lifelong goal of reaching the ancient realm!

In the Supreme Divine sect, Daoist Gu Hao was seated on a palatial throne, and when he saw the purple clouds and light in the distance, he flew into a rage and smashed the teacup in his hand.

“Damn it! That brat actually reached the ancient realm!”

Despite the distance between the sects, the aura of an ancient realm expert was clear as day. Now, he was left at a loss.

“With this guy breaking through, the Supreme Divine sect will be forever suppressed by the Great Wilderness Divine sect…”

Daoist Gu Hao felt very emotional and rather hopeless for the sect’s future.

“Teacher, don’t worry too much. Now that the disaster is upon us, even the Great Wilderness Divine sect might not survive. It’s best to watch and wait. We can deal with them according to the situation in the future,” Li Hong said respectfully.

He had been by Daoist Gu Hao’s side for a long time, so he knew very well what his teacher was thinking.

However, he was very clear about one thing. Ye Xuan was definitely the center of attention at this moment. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

If things were peaceful and stable, it would definitely be a joyous event for the Great Wilderness Divine sect.

However, given the current situation, nothing was set in stone yet. No one knew who would survive or perish amidst this disaster.

After hearing Li Hong’s words, Daoist Gu Hao’s eyes lit up, as he suddenly thought of a vicious scheme.

Perhaps he could order some of his subordinates to lure more berserk beasts toward the Great Wilderness Divine sect and Sky Mountain…

As the strongest sect, they should shoulder more responsibility, right?

In this way, the pressure on the Supreme Divine sect would be greatly reduced. It was like killing two birds with one stone!

The only drawback was that those he dispatched would end up becoming sacrificial pawns. Even if they made it back, only dead people kept secrets.

Daoist Gu Hao was more than willing to pay this price, and immediately said, “Go and summon Daoist Black Iron here now.”

However, before Daoist Gu Hao could put his scheme into action, the air around him shimmered and trembled.

At this moment, Daoist Gu Hao’s face turned as black as charcoal. He immediately stood up.

“What exactly happened? Who dared to touch the defensive formation?”

Daoist Gu Hao spat out these words with a cold expression, but no one around him dared to answer.

Somewhere else, Han Tai had already hidden himself and was smiling sinisterly.

The disciples guarding the defensive formation were all in chaos, thinking about how to stabilize the formation. However, before they could, monsters emitting black fog appeared outside the formation.

These monsters stared at the disciples in the formation with cold eyes, obviously wanting to devour them.

At this moment, a collective thought appeared in the minds of the disciples.

‘F*ck! We’re done for!’

Boom! Boom! Boom…

The defensive formation was continuously bombarded with attacks from the berserk beasts that were fiendishly staring at their prey hiding within.

These monsters were undoubtedly from that realm filled with strange power, and had laid waste to everything in their path. They had already devoured countless living beings.

Originally, they did not notice that there was a sect hidden here. After all, this place was really too desolate.

However, what was unexpected was that they suddenly detected aura fluctuations from these plains, as well as smelled the scent of abundant life force. Lured over, they suddenly realized that there were living beings hiding here!

Once they started searching, they eventually found the Supreme Divine sect and launched an attack without hesitation.

Under the effect of the strange power, these beasts from the barren region had already gone crazy. Anything that was not infected by the strange power was a target.

It was not just the Supreme Divine sect. Some other forces were also attacked. However, the Supreme Divine sect was in a worse state because they had not expected to be discovered after concealing their whole sect.

This apocalyptic disaster almost seemed hellbent on destroying all life on the East continent. Some astute cultivators also noticed that the worldly power that isolated the East continent from the other continents was unexpectedly getting weaker!

Elsewhere, at Sky Mountain, tens of millions of people were looking up at Ye Xuan in the sky.

“Congratulations, Chief Ye Xuan! Congratulations on breaking through to the ancient realm!”

Countless shouts and cheers similar to this one were heard all over the place.

Looking at such a scene, even Ye Xuan was shocked. He had indeed broken through, but was there a need to make such a big scene?

‘Ahem, that being said, this is indeed quite satisfying,’ Ye Xuan thought to himself as he looked down at the land below.

When he looked into the distance and found that the desert region was already filled with black fog, he continued to probe deeper and found that there was an extremely powerful creature in that strange realm, looking at him from afar.

The moment he sensed this powerful creature, Ye Xuan frowned.

It seemed that the disaster had descended earlier than he had expected.

The only thing that made him heave a sigh of relief was that he had managed to break through and solidify his cultivation foundation in time. He was now as powerful as a peak-level ancient realm expert!

Without this strength, he would be powerless to overcome this catastrophic disaster.

This disaster would definitely become an event that would be etched into the annals of history of the East continent.
