372 Yuelun

Zhuge Yueyue’s expression turned cold when she heard that. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

However, she knew very well that Li Xue’er had done this for her sake. Still, no matter what, she still felt very uncomfortable hearing others demeaning her teacher like that.

“Xue’er, I know you’re doing this for me. But now that I’m the eldest disciple of Cloud Sky peak, I can’t betray Teacher.”

“Teacher is very good to me, and I like Cloud Sky peak’s environment very much. To me, this place is like home now,” Zhuge Yueyue said with a determined look.

When Yuelun heard this, her gaze instantly turned cold.

!!

Were it not for Li Xue’er’s coaxing and pestering, she would not have come here to take Zhuge Yueyue as her disciple.

One had to know that there were countless people who wanted to be her disciple, but would never have the chance.

Yet she was being rejected now…

However, even though Yuelun was a little angry, she did not want to be too calculative on account of the other party’s youth and ignorance.

She was also quite surprised.

What kind of medicine did Ye Xuan give this girl?

What did he do to make this girl pass up the chance to join Water Sky peak?

Li Xue’er noticed her teacher’s expression and became anxious.

“Yueyue, what are you doing? I’ve coaxed and pestered Teacher for a long time so that you can have this opportunity!”

“You’ve always been intelligent, so how can you not distinguish the gains and losses in this matter? If you insist on staying on Cloud Sky peak, you’ll only end up with regrets.”

Zhuge Yueyue’s expression did not change at all. Her eyes were unusually calm.

As expected, in everyone’s eyes, her teacher was a joke and a weakling who had only reached the second level of the divine mystic realm.

However, she knew her teacher’s true capabilities, and had experienced his kindness and warmth.

In the entire mystic world, which teacher would do what Ye Xuan had done for their disciple? Not only did he give her precious pills, but also infused her with his spiritual power.

Would Yuelun do the same?

The answer was obvious!

However, Zhuge Yueyue did not want to explain too much. Instead, she spoke with a firm tone.

“Xue’er, don’t try to persuade me anymore. I won’t regret it.”

“I appreciate Chief Yuelun’s good intentions, but I will never do anything to let Teacher down.”

“Yueyue, what are you doing?”

Li Xue’er stomped her foot in anger.

However, she knew very well that Zhuge Yueyue’s personality had always been like this. If she had really made a decision, there was no way to change it.

Li Xue’er could not help but look back at her teacher for help.

Yuelun immediately waved her hand.

“I have never forced others to do things they don’t want to do. Since you’ve made your own decision, I will naturally respect your decision!”

Before she left, Yuelun raised her head and looked at the courtyard in front of her.

“It’s already rather late. Why don’t you see your teacher around?”

“Er, Teacher might not be awake yet!” Zhuge Yueyue said, a little embarrassed.

At this moment, the door of the wooden house that was originally closed slowly opened. Ye Xuan walked out with a longsword in his hand and an indifferent expression on his face.

This sword was naturally the Cloud Sky sword.

“Greetings, Teacher!”

Seeing this, Zhuge Yueyue hurriedly bowed respectfully.

“En!” Ye Xuan nodded. When his eyes fell on Yuelun, who was not far away, his eyes darkened.

What wind brought this woman here?

Just as Ye Xuan was feeling puzzled, Yuelun walked over to him and smiled meaningfully.

“Junior Brother Ye, we haven’t seen each other for a few days. Senior Sister really misses you.”

Ye Xuan’s mouth twitched when he heard this.

As Cloud Sky peak’s chief, he was familiar with Yuelun and was no stranger to her antics.

Although she looked innocent and harmless, it was all part of her persona. In fact, in terms of schemes, even Gao Shun was not her opponent.

“Senior Sister Yuelun, when I just woke up today, I found a magpie at the head of the bed, and it kept chirping. At that time, I was wondering if there was a happy event. It turns out it was informing me of Senior Sister’s arrival.”

“Yueyue, go ahead and make tea for everyone,” Ye Xuan said with an indifferent expression.

Even if he could not beat this woman now, he could not lose in terms of posturing.

“Alright, Teacher!”

Zhuge Yueyue nodded and went into the kitchen to make tea.

Ye Xuan was still a little surprised by the arrival of this woman.

He had been well-behaved for the past hundred years, so he should not have offended this woman.

Furthermore, in the past hundred years, the two of them had not really talked much with each other.

Usually, they would at most greet each other out of courtesy, but nothing beyond that.

Why did this woman suddenly come to Cloud Sky peak?

After that, Ye Xuan brought Yuelun and Li Xue’er to the only decent hall on Cloud Sky peak.

Ye Xuan looked at Yuelun and asked, “Pray tell, why has Senior Sister Yue come today?”

Yuelun did not reply. Instead, she looked at the surroundings of Cloud Sky peak and shook her head.

Compared to the other peaks, Cloud Sky peak’s condition was indeed too shabby.

How could it be so dilapidated? There was not even a decent training hall.

“It’s nothing important. My newest disciple is your disciple’s good friend, so I brought her here to catch up with your disciple.”

“I see,”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan revealed a look of realization.

In a short while, Zhuge Yue yue came back with tea.

Seeing this, Li Xue’er felt uncomfortable for some reason.

Zhuge Yueyue was the eldest disciple of Cloud Sky peak, so why did she have to serve tea like a servant disciple?
