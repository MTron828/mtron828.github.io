321 Ye Xuan, Heavenly King Realm?

What happened shortly after was a repeat of Ye Xuan’s previous feat. The sea race experts were imprisoned by Ye Xuan’s spatial intent, following which it rapidly constricted and consigned them into oblivion.

Even the King realm expert who had perfected his penetration intent was unable to shatter the spatial cage that imprisoned them.

It was a useless struggle.

When the human experts saw this, they were all dumbfounded. Their eyes were filled with shock.

Such terrifying strength!

Who was this person? Why had they never heard of this person before?

However, before they could gather their thoughts, Ye Xuan raised a finger and pointed at a blue-robed human expert.

Then, the same spatial cage imprisoned the blue-robed man. No matter what he did, he could not break free.

What was going on?

Was this guy not on their side?

Why was he attacking one of his own now?

They were all confused and in a state of panic.

“Kong Ruoming of the Tiansha Temple, did you really think that it was easy to snatch my Tower of Heaven?”

Ye Xuan finally spoke up.

This blue-robed man was obviously one of the King realm experts who had sent subordinates after him.

“What? You’re Ye Xuan?”

Before his death, Kong Ruoming finally understood what was going on. His eyes were filled with disbelief.

This guy was actually Ye Xuan? Why was his strength so terrifying?

Damn it!

Kong Ruoming’s fate was already decided.

Ye Xuan slowly clenched his hand, and Kong Ruoming’s body and soul instantly turned into fine powder.

When the other human experts saw this, their bodies trembled slightly, and their eyes were filled with fear.

…

Soon, similar situations occurred in other areas of the Huangyu Zone’s spatial turbulence.

Ye Xuan’s spatial intent and heavenly lightning intent allowed him to travel almost instantaneously within the Huangyu Zone.

A day later, the entire Huangyu Zone was in an uproar.

Thanks to the power of karma, Ye Xuan had managed to trace and kill all of the King realm experts who had sent subordinates to snatch his Tower of Heaven back then.

Still, those King realm experts were not the only ones that died. The sea race experts fighting them all died as well.

Within the short span of a day, Ye Xuan had personally changed the entire situation of the war with his own power. Word of his feats had even started circulating throughout the Southern Territory.

The sea race experts were even more shocked.

It had only been one day, but all the sea race King realm experts who had attacked the Huangyu Zone had fallen. How was this possible?

Only a Heavenly King realm expert could have done this. However, the Heavenly King realm experts that they knew of were accounted for.

Who was the one who had attacked?

Could it be one of those old monsters who had been in seclusion for ages? Or was it an expert from another zone?

Then, they too heard the news.

It was Ye Xuan!

He was already famous within the Huangyu Zone due to his possession of the Tower of Heaven, but it was not due to his strength, so the sudden revelation blew them away.

“Ye Xuan?”

Jun Xuantian, who was heading to the Tianze Zone, was stunned when he heard the news.

He had already determined that Ye Xuan’s talent was extremely monstrous and that he was a peerless genius worthy of befriending, which was why he had expressed his stance to restrain others from trying to snatch Ye Xuan’s Tower of Heaven.

However, he had not expected Ye Xuan to exceed his expectations to this extent!

Ye Xuan was as powerful as a Heavenly King realm expert?

“How is this possible?”

“It’s only been a few years. How did he grow to such a terrifying extent? ”

“It seems like there are only two possibilities!”

“First, it wasn’t Ye Xuan who killed those sea race experts, but a hidden almighty expert behind him. Although I don’t know what that almighty expert’s purpose is, it’s indeed possible.”

“Second, Ye Xuan might have been hiding his strength from the beginning. He might have been a Heavenly King realm expert from the beginning!”

“Mmm! Given the incidents surrounding him thus far, the second possibility is more likely!”

Jun Xuantian did not believe that Ye Xuan’s strength could grow to this extent within just a few years.

There was an entire lightning tribulation realm in between his previous pattern condensation realm, and his current Heavenly King realm strength.

No matter how much of a genius Ye Xuan was, such a thing was simply impossible!

Throughout the entire history of the Tianyuan continent, there had been countless peerless geniuses in every era, but no one had ever reached the King realm in less than a hundred years.

Even reincarnations of ancient almighty experts could not do this.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m
