774 Three Paths

Ye Xuan had three paths to choose from. In order to reach the sealed immortal realm, he had to complete his Dao. Only after one succeeded in completing one’s Dao and having it be recognized by the laws of the world could one truly reach the sealed immortal realm.

Now, he had obtained a rare opportunity to accumulate the power of merit to reach the sealed immortal realm. However, there were pros and cons to this, which made him hesitate.

He was well on his way to cultivating his Sword Dao, and he had recently gone down the path of body refining.

He muttered to himself, “Now that the mortal world is in danger, it will indeed be much easier if I really rely on the power of merit to reach the sealed immortal realm.”

“However, this was not part of my original plan. If I end up being bound by the limitations of the power of merit, it will be more of a bane than a boon.”

Originally, Ye Xuan wanted to use his Sword Dao and body refining to reach the sealed immortal realm. In order to do this, he had already made some preparations, and was now both a spiritual cultivator, as well as a body refining cultivator.

From a certain perspective, using the power of merit was the easiest path to success, but it was also the weakest among the three. He did not want this choice to one day limit his future growth.

As such, he decided to stick to his guns.

Just as he was about to expel the power of merit from his body, a wisp of red light in his body instantly fused with a Dao Flower in his body.

Ye Xuan was dumbfounded.

“Could it be… Three Daos?”

It was only at this moment that Ye Xuan recalled that there were indeed three Dao Flowers in his body. This third flower had quietly bloomed when he stepped into the ancient realm, and had yet to fuse with anything.

When he first obtained a Dao Flower, it appeared when he was comprehending his Sword Dao. When he began to refine his body, the second Dao Flower appeared.

Now, much to Ye Xuan’s surprise, the power of merit he had just obtained fused into the third Dao Flower without his consent. It seemed that this Dao Flower was extremely compatible with the power of merit, to the point that he did not have to actively do anything to support the fusion.

Under the effect of the power of merit, the fate energy that originally existed in Ye Xuan’s body immediately fused with the power of merit, seemingly becoming much stronger.

Now, if Ye Xuan really stepped into the sealed immortal realm using the power of merit, he would definitely be much stronger.

If he had only used the original power of merit to do so, he might not have been so powerful. However, thanks to the fusion and augmentation of his fate energy, this changed drastically.

If Ye Xuan could really break through to the sealed immortal realm with his Sword Dao, body refinement and power of merit, just how powerful would he be?

Thinking this, Ye Xuan took a deep breath. Although this matter had developed in an unexpected way, it was still considered a good thing.

“Wow, I can’t believe that this might actually be possible. Interesting…”

It was not an exaggeration to say that it might be a hundred times more difficult. Although the process was full of hardships, Ye Xuan still had no fear. After all, he had the support of the system.

With the system’s help, anything was possible.

“Hehe, the word ‘impossible’ doesn’t exist in my dictionary!”

…

Out of the blue, a terrifying tremor rocked the ground in the distance, waking Ye Xuan from his reverie. He immediately turned his attention to the source of the commotion.

Although it was far away, Ye Xuan could still sense that there was an even more terrifying monster in the sky further away.

“What exactly is that place?”

Everyone else at the scene was also looking in the same direction.

Moments later, someone shouted in shock, “That place is where the Supreme Divine sect is located. Could it be that the Supreme Divine sect has fallen?”

As soon as those words rang out, everyone’s jaws dropped in shock.

At this moment, the Supreme Divine sect’s grounds were filled with smoke and fire.This could only mean one thing!

A tragic battle was taking place at the Supreme Divine sect, and the defensive formation there had most likely been broken!

Looking at the ruins in the distance, many people sighed.

“Damn it! This is a tragedy!”

“I can’t even imagine how many people will die there.”

However, after hearing this, someone retorted, “Tsk! They brought this upon themselves. When the disaster broke out, they chose to protect themselves and abandoned us to die!” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Now that their defensive formation has been broken, who will save them?”

Most people despised the Supreme Divine sect after being disappointed by their actions in the face of this disaster. They were originally a well-respected top-tier sect that many people longed to join. However, they were now the target of public ridicule.
