When he looked into the direction of the voice, he saw Daoist Black Iron and Xie Tianyu in an extremely sorry state, fleeing from a dense cloud of black fog.

“It’s actually you two?”

Seeing them make a frantic beeline for the defensive line, Gao Shun was dumbfounded. Why were these two people here?

After pondering for a moment, he realized that the Supreme Divine sect had probably been destroyed, and speculated that these two should have escaped with great difficulty.

At this moment, countless gazes were directed toward Daoist Black iron and Xie Tianyu. After seeing the state they were in, some people immediately mocked them.

“Hehe, if it isn’t the sect master and the eldest disciple of the Supreme Divine sect? Why are you both so miserable?”

“Ooh, I remember now. Earlier, there were fluctuations coming from the direction of the Supreme Divine sect. Could it be that your sect was attacked by the berserk beasts, you poor things?”

“Oh dear, it seems that this was indeed the case!”

Their words were filled with mockery. After all, they still clearly remembered that even before the disaster struck, the Supreme Divine sect had given up on them.

They only cared about protecting themselves and hiding themselves away, yet now came crawling over for protection once their sect had been destroyed.

Many people could not help but suggest, “Chief Gao Shun, we don’t have to let them in. After all, they aren’t good people!”

“Yes, yes, yes. At that time, they were the ones who gave up on everyone first. This is karma biting them in the *ss!”

The crowd immediately began to discuss animatedly, their voices filled with disdain for the Supreme Divine sect.

Daoist Black Iron, who was outside, could also hear what they were saying, and felt ashamed. The Supreme Divine sect used to be an existence that everyone looked up to.

However, who would have expected that he would one day be ridiculed by commoners…

It was hard to bear.

“Damn it!”

Xie Tianyu, who was beside him, clenched his fists tightly. His heart was already burning with anger.

“This bunch of losers, how dare they talk about us like this?”

Xie Tianyu could not take it anymore. When he arrived, he had already prepared himself for the eventuality of being mocked by the Great Wilderness Divine sect.

However, what he could not accept was that this group of insignificant ants actually dared to mock them like this. These people were only lucky enough to survive under the protection of the Great Wilderness Divine sect. They were not contributing to the defensive efforts at all!

Tianyu, don’t be rash,” Daoist Black immediately said to rein him in.

They had to suck it up. As long as they could keep their lives and preserve the inheritance of the Supreme Divine sect, it would all be worth it.

“Fellow Daoist Gao, I am aware that our sects are not on good terms, but without exception, all of this was orchestrated by my teacher. Now, the Supreme Divine sect has been destroyed, and my teacher fled the moment he sensed trouble.”

“The rest of us stood our ground and fought, but were overwhelmed. As there was no hope left, in order to preserve the last trace of the Supreme Divine sect’s inheritance, I could only come here to seek refuge.”

“The Great Wilderness Divine sect is the number one force in our East Continent, and has proven themselves to be broad-minded and willing to act to save the people. Therefore, I beg you to also take us in.”

Daoist Black Iron lowered his head as he said this. Then, shockingly, he knelt down without hesitation.

“Teacher!”

When Xie Tianyu saw his teacher kneeling down, his heart trembled and tears rolled down his face.

Seeing this scene, everyone was stunned.

Unexpectedly, the usually arrogant Daoist Black Iron had knelt in public. Even Gao Shun was at a loss for words. He originally wanted to mock him as well, but it seemed that the situation did not warrant it.

At this moment, Daoist Black Iron said, “Fellow Daoist Gao, I also understand that you may hate me, but no matter what, my disciple Xie Tianyu is innocent. I beg you to save him.”

“If you are willing to take my disciple in, even if you want my life, I can give it to you.”

Daoist Black Iron noticed that the black fog behind him was fast approaching, and he no longer felt any hope.

After rushing all the way here, he had no strength to fight these berserk beasts. In any case, so long as his disciple was safe, his sacrifice would be worth it.

After hearing these words, Gao Shun’s heart trembled, and the people who spoke up earlier were silenced.

No matter what, the Daoist Black Iron was indeed a respectable teacher.

Even the disciples of the Great Wilderness Divine sect felt touched, including Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun.

Even though Daoist Black Iron was not a good person from their perspective, at the very least, he took extraordinary care of his disciples.

After thinking for a moment, Zhuge Yueyue wanted to put in a good word for the two of them, but then…

“Senior Brother Gao, let them in,” Ye Xuan said.

“Teacher!”

Zhuge Yueyue and the others looked behind them and realized that Ye Xuan had returned. Since it was him that said these words, no one else said anything to the contrary.
