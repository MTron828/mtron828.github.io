439 Breakthrough

“True dragon’s strength, activate!”

Ye Xuan roared as he activated the true dragon’s precious bone in his body to suppress the vast spiritual power. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Then, with the help of the Golden Lotus of the Great Dao, Ye Xuan slowly refined the spiritual power.

Three days passed quickly.

Hu!

Ye Xuan’s tightly-shut eyes suddenly opened, and mysterious divine light flashed across the depths of his eyes. A surge of power suddenly swept out, revealing his advanced-stage mystic lord realm cultivation.

Furthermore, he was on the verge of reaching the supreme realm.

If he solidified his cultivation foundation, he would be able to reach the peak of the mystic lord realm. At that point, he would be on par with Gongsun Shouyue.

If he wanted to break through to the supreme, he would have to produce a second Dao fruit in his divine spring.

Of course, there were still some shortcuts to breaking through, such as immortal-grade pills that surpassed heaven-grade, or some extremely rare immortal-grade heavenly treasures, and so on.

Unfortunately, Ye Xuan had none of these, so he had to break through the normal way. Still, he was very satisfied with his current cultivation progress.

The amount of immortal spiritual power in his body had increased significantly as well.

Breakthroughs were awesome!

Ye Xuan stretched lazily, then pushed the door open and walked out.

Looking up at the peach forest, a magnificent palace had already begun to take shape. It seemed that the Su family’s laborers were very efficient.

Moreover, Su Changhe had been living on Cloud Sky peak all this time, personally supervising the construction of the palace.

In addition, in order to leave a good impression on ye Xuan, the Su family had put in a lot of effort and resources this time.

Ye Xuan was very satisfied, and was impressed by Su Tiansheng’s character and foresight.

The Su family would be under his protection from now on.

Had it been the Ye Xuan of the past, not to mention protecting the Su family, even protecting his own Cloud Sky peak would be extremely difficult.

However, things were different now. He was already an advanced-stage mystic lord realm expert, and on paper, he was the second strongest expert in the Great Wilderness Divine sect.

In fact, with the Flora Sword technique and the Hell Slash technique, Ye Xuan could even defeat Gongsun Shouyue.

At this moment, Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun had also finished their cultivation session and walked over.

Seeing that their teacher had ended his secluded cultivation, they hurriedly walked over.

“You’re done cultivating, Teacher!”

“En!” Ye Xuan nodded with a smile, then examined their auras. They were extremely calm.

It seemed that these two little girls had been very diligent over the past three days.

Incidentally, today was the day of the Seven Peaks competition. Cultivators from the various peaks had already made their way to the Great Wilderness peak.

“Chief Ye Xuan…”

Just as Ye Xuan was about to bring them there as well, a handsome young man rushed over, panting.

The young man was Su Changhe.

“Cough cough… Chief Ye Xuan, are you planning to have the two fairies participate in the Seven Peaks competition?”

Ye Xuan raised his brows, but he quickly understood what Su Changhe was getting at.

It seemed that this guy was a little bored after staying on Cloud Sky peak supervising construction work. However, it did make sense. After all, other than cultivating, there was nothing else to do here.

Furthermore, this was his first time at the Great Wilderness Divine sect, and he had never witnessed the once-in-a-century Seven Peaks competition. He naturally did not want to miss it.

Therefore, when he noticed that they were about to leave, he came over eagerly. He wanted to observe the Seven Peaks competition. Actually, more importantly, he wanted to see the beautiful women of the Great Wilderness Divine sect.

After that, Su Changhe greeted Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun with a smile, before turning to Ye Xuan with a somewhat pleading expression.

“Father said that the Seven Peaks competition is a rare event that only happens once in a hundred years. If Chief Ye Xuan doesn’t mind, could you take me to witness this glorious event?”

“Chief Ye Xuan, please rest assured. I won’t cause any trouble and I won’t bring any trouble to Cloud Sky peak.”

Su Changhe looked at ye Xuan nervously.

Although the Su family and Cloud Sky peak were on friendly terms, he was still a little afraid of Ye Xuan.

Especially in the past few days, after he vaguely sensed an extremely terrifying aura coming from Ye Xuan’s residence.

Ye Xuan laughed.

“Mm! Your performance these days has been quite good, especially in supervising the construction of the palace. I’m very satisfied. Come along then!”

Ye Xuan was quite satisfied with Su Changhe. Although he looked like a villain at the beginning, he managed to turn over a new leaf and worked hard.

Furthermore, while Ye Xuan was in secluded cultivation, Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun were busy cultivating. It was basically Su Changhe who managed the upkeep of the entire Cloud Sky peak alone.

Ye Xuan naturally kept these things in mind.

“Many thanks, Chief Ye Xuan!”

When Su Changhe heard this, he was ecstatic. He turned around subconsciously and was about to high-five Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun in celebration.

Of course, when Feng Xiyun saw this, she only smiled wryly.

On the other hand, Zhuge Yueyue looked at Su Changhe indifferently. The latter was so frightened that he retracted his palm awkwardly.

“Cough, cough… Umm… The weather today is pretty good…”

Su Changhe awkwardly changed the topic, but he was already used to their behavior.

“Alright, it’s almost time. Let’s go!”

...

With a wave of his sleeve, a surge of energy suddenly swept out and enveloped them, as they turned into a streak of light that flew toward the Great Wilderness peak.
