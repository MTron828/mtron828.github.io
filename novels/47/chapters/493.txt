494 Reliable Ally

Hearing this, the Reincarnation Fairy covered her mouth and laughed.

As intelligent as she was, she naturally knew what these two people were talking about.

However, what surprised her was that her teacher, who was usually stoic and sage-like, had such a side to him. Still, Ye Xuan had managed to fend her teacher off, which spoke volumes about his own character.

“Hahaha! Fellow Daoist Ye Xuan really knows how to joke. But speaking of Fellow Daoist Gongsun, I just recalled something!”

“Back then, Fellow Daoist Gongsun still owed me wine money. He’s been in debt for a hundred years. I wonder when he’s going to pay me back?”

Ye Xuan was stunned.

Was there really such a ridiculous thing? After all, Gongsun Shouyue was the sect master of the Great Wilderness Divine sect. There was no way the sect master was a miser, right?

“Since Fellow Daoist Ye is Fellow Daoist Gongsun’s junior brother, why don’t you…”

Chu Tianba had a “you know what” expression on his face.

Ye Xuan’s mouth twitched when he heard this.

“Good fellow! This old man is actually testing me!”

Ye Xuan said with a smile, still remaining completely calm.

“Fellow Daoist Chu, you really know how to joke. Everyone knows that my Cloud Sky peak is the poorest peak in the Great Wilderness Divine sect. We have no money at all!”

“Back then, my teacher took me in as a disciple in a hurry. After that, I spent a hundred years in closed-door cultivation on Cloud Sky peak, completely focused on cultivation. Fellow Daoist, I’m afraid that even if you sell me, I won’t be able to pay you back for the wine money!”

Of course, Ye Xuan did indeed have money.

The 10,000 taels of profound gold that the Su family had given him was still in his storage ring. However, why should he pay Gongsun Shouyue’s debt?

Moreover, the Cloud Sky peak was indeed the poorest peak in the Great Wilderness Divine sect. Sure, their situation had improved compared to back then, but that did not mean that they could afford to splurge on meaningless things.

Ye Xuan had been thinking of using the system to multiply the profound gold in his possession, so he needed every ounce of it to maximize the benefits from using the system, especially if he managed to obtain a high reward multiplier.

Su Changhe’s eyes lit up when he heard about money.

‘Isn’t this what I’m best at? My cultivation is lacking, but I do have money.’

Just as he was about to show off, he was glared at by Ye Xuan and stopped.

Su Changhe was shocked and his heart was full of doubts.

These two people were top experts, and it was just a little money for wine. Was there a need to go around in circles like this?

How could he have known that this was actually Chu Tianba’s psychological test for Ye Xuan.

Ye Xuan smiled, then slowly said, “Perhaps Senior Brother Gongsun truly forgot about this matter. I’ll definitely remind him when I get back.”

Chu Tianba looked meaningfully at Ye Xuan. He had already made a judgment about this kid in his heart.

His was unfathomable, and he was shrewd and cunning too. He could not be underestimated.

Thinking this, Chu Tianba sighed inwardly.

He did not expect that after Chief Tian Xuan, the Great Wilderness Divine sect would produce another powerful expert with such terrifying strength. How good would it be if Ye Xuan was a member of the Jade Lake Divine sect instead?

Unfortunately, from the test just now, he was already aware that Ye Xuan ‘s feelings for the Great Wilderness Divine sect were deeply rooted.

Chu Tianba was probably the only one who could think of using wine money to pry into the hearts of others.

“Hahaha! It’s just a small amount, so why would I dwell on such things?” Chu Tianba said with a smile.

When the crowd heard this, they were all stunned.

“What are those two people doing? Was there a need to beat around the bush like that over a small amount? They had me thinking that the debt was some sort of treasure instead.”

Su Changhe thought about it seriously. He felt a severe headache and was not smart enough to figure it out.

While he was nursing his headache, another group of cultivators appeared in the distance.

“Young Master Su…”

Although they were still some distance away, Su Changhe could still hear the voice of his guards. He quickly looked up.

The leader of this group of cultivators was his father.

“Father, why are you here?”

“Hahaha! I can’t believe that in just a short month, you’ve become so much stronger!”

Su Tiansheng raised his broad palm and patted Su Changhe’s shoulder. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

As his father did not bother controlling his strength, Su Changhe almost vomited blood because of this.

If the other party was not his father, he would probably be depressed.

“Greetings, Chief Ye Xuan!”

After Su Tiansheng patted Su Changhe, he quickly bowed respectfully to Ye Xuan.

At the same time, Chu Tianba had also returned to the Jade Lake Divine sect’s group, and was asking about what had happened earlier.

Seeing Su Tiansheng and the others, Ye Xuan was curious.

“Why are you guys here?”

“Chief Ye Xuan, I just returned to Qingyang City this morning, and my clansmen immediately informed me of your visit yesterday. As a result, I rushed over!”

“The people beside me are all the experts of the Su family. I hope they can be of assistance to Chief Ye Xuan,” Su Tiansheng said with a smile.

Ye Xuan nodded.

Sure enough, this guy was extremely reliable!

Despite the dangers involved in such a great battle, he had still not hesitated to bring all of the experts of his family over.

...

Although Ye Xuan did not think much of the strength of these experts, their presence here alone indicated Su Tiansheng’s stance and determination.

“The current situation in the archaic divine mountains is very dangerous. I can sense your determination. However, in this battle, anyone who has not reached the mystic lord realm will only be cannon fodder.”

“Master Su, don’t be impulsive. If you suffer heavy losses here, this kid will have no one to rely on in the future,” Ye Xuan gestured toward Su Changhe and said.

Despite Ye Xuan’s words, Su Tiansheng was not the slightest bit disappointed. Instead, he was ecstatic.

The meaning of Ye Xuan’s words just now was extremely obvious.

From the looks of it, this kid still had a chance of becoming Chief Ye Xuan’s disciple in the future.
