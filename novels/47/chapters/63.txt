Chapter 64: He… He’s Ye Xuan!

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The leader of the Mad Saber sect gritted his teeth as he tried to use his core formation realm cultivation to resist the spiritual pressure.

However, just as his spiritual power started to surge forth, he was suddenly strangled by an invisible hand, forcefully stuffing his spiritual power back into his Dantian.

“Hehe, do you think you can resist?”

Seeing this, a sneer hung on the corners of Ye Xuan’s mouth. Waves of power like a vast ocean suddenly swept out.

The power of a Golden Core realm cultivator was displayed.

After a cultivator stepped into the core formation realm, the Xudan in the Dantian would turn into a real core. When that real core turned into a golden core, the cultivator’s strength would undergo a qualitative change.

In short, the gap between a Golden Core realm cultivator and a Xudan realm cultivator was even more terrifying than the gap between a Xudan realm cultivator and a peak Purple Spirit realm cultivator.

Boom!

In an instant, the arena platform under the leader of the Mad Saber sect’s feet was turned into dust.

At the same time, the mountain-like spiritual power engulfed him. The leader of the Mad Saber sect suddenly felt his bones cracking.

Puff!

Under Ye Xuan’s terrifying golden core power, the leader of the Mad Saber sect’s Xudan power was forcibly suppressed back into his Dantian. The latter could not help but spit out a mouthful of blood.

“Senior, spare my life! Senior, please spare my life!”

......

At that moment, the leader of the Mad Saber sect’s face had turned extremely pale, and a premonition of death arose in his heart.

He was truly incomparably terrified. He had never seen or heard of such a terrifying cultivator. This suffocating feeling was too terrifying.

He suddenly realized that this young man was not a Xudan or True Core realm cultivator. He was a terrifying Golden Core realm cultivator!

He was a top-tier powerhouse who represented the upper limit of cultivators in the Great Qian Dynasty!

The other party could crush him to death easily, just like how he had crushed theZhu family head earlier.

“What? Didn’t you hear my earlier question?”

Ye Xuan looked indifferently at the leader of the Mad Saber sect, who had just spat out a mouthful of blood. The latter knelt on the ground, unable to withstand the terrifying spiritual pressure Ye Xuan was exerting on him. Blood seeped out from the corner of his mouth and stained his clothes.

“How could I dare to have such intentions? I am to be blamed for being blind and spouting nonsense. Please don’t blame me!”

“I hope that you will forgive me, Senior!”

At that moment, the leader of the Mad Saber sect, who had been kneeling on the broken arena platform, hurriedly crawled toward Ye Xuan. First, he begged Ye Xuan for mercy, and then he looked at Li Qingyan and the others.

No matter what, he could only pray in his heart that Li Qingyan did not hold a grudge against him. After all, he had wanted to kill her just a moment ago.

At this moment, he no longer cared about his dignity as a core formation realm cultivator.

Just now, he had clearly sensed a trace of killing intent from Ye Xuan’s gaze, and the spiritual pressure he exuded was still rising.

What did this mean? It meant that the other party’s strength was far above what it was currently. Just how terrifying was this guy?

The leader of the Mad Saber sect was terrified. Under the suppression of absolute strength, he had no chance to escape.

If the other party really wanted to kill him, he could only wait for death.

Compared to his own life, what did mere dignity count for?

“This Chen Ping really deserves to die. He actually caused me so much trouble!”

The leader of the Mad Saber sect was filled with resentment toward Chen Ping. He directly cursed the other party’s ancestors for tens of thousands of generations.

Had they not told him that Li Qingyan was only a seventh-level qi transformation realm cultivator? Did they not say that the strongest cultivator in the Li family was the seventh-level Purple Spirit realm expert, Li Zhengyang?

Why did they neglect to mention Li Qingyan’s teacher? This senior’s strength was so terrifying. It was absolutely impossible for him to be an unknown persona.

However, at this moment, the leader of the Mad Saber sect was also a little puzzled.

In the entire Great Qian Dynasty, only Ye Xuan of the Qingyun sect had achieved amazing results at such a young age, but even Ye Xuan did not have such strength.

“Spare you?”

“If you want me to spare you, it’s possible!”

Ye Xuan looked at him indifferently, and the mountain-like spiritual pressure instantly disappeared.

Seeing this, the leader of the Mad Saber sect could not help but sigh in relief.

When the surrounding cultivators saw this scene, they were petrified and held their breaths.

Was this still the same f*cking arrogant leader of the Mad Saber sect? Was he still the same peak expert who had casually crushed a sixth-level Purple Spirit realm cultivator?

The incomparably tough arena platform had long been reduced to dust. The clothes of the leader of the Mad Saber sect were stained with blood, and the aura around his body was erratic and weak.

However, what shocked everyone the most was that this power, that could instantly suppress a core formation realm cultivator, and even heavily injure him, did not affect any of the cultivators in the audience stands.

Undoubtedly, this could only mean one thing. The gap between the two parties’ realms was too big. That young man was able to easily crush the leader of the Mad Saber sect, and his control over his own strength had reached an astonishing level.

Gulp! Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Everyone could not help but swallow hard. Their foreheads were covered in sweat, and their eyes were filled with shock.

They had thought that the leader of the Mad Saber sect was the strongest cultivator they had ever seen. After all, the former had just casually crushed a sixth-level Purple Spirit realm cultivator.

However, Ye Xuan’s appearance had now shown them the meaning of absolute strength. This was too terrifying.

Hearing Ye Xuan’s words, the leader of the Mad Saber sect was delighted. However, his legs were still kneeling on the ground, as he waited for the follow-up sentence.

After all, Ye Xuan’s mood would determine whether he lived or died.

“Someone wants to forcefully marry my disciple. They even want to destroy the family that my disciple belongs to. As her teacher, do you think that I, Ye Xuan, should interfere?”

“I don’t want to see them in the future. Do you know what to do?”

As soon as he finished speaking, everyone’s expressions changed drastically, and they stared at him with wide eyes.

This… This young man was actually Ye Xuan…

The strongest genius cultivator of the Great Qian Dynasty, and an existence with unparalleled talent.

My God, I actually encountered this legendary genius!

Countless young cultivators revealed excited expressions.

One had to know that Ye Xuan was the nightmare of the young genius cultivators of the Great Qian Dynasty. He was like a mountain that could not be climbed.

However, in the eyes of many ordinary young cultivators, Ye Xuan was like a lighthouse. He was their idol when it came to cultivation, and an existence that they admired greatly.

At the age of 20, he had entered the core formation realm and crushed countless young genius cultivators of the Great Qian Dynasty.

The young cultivators could not help but clench their fists. The fear on their faces instantly turned into excitement.

They had not expected to see their idol, and from such a close distance too!
