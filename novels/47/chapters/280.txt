Chapter 281: Advancing To The Pattern Condensation Realm

This was the crucial step in advancing to the pattern condensation realm.

When one’s martial intent reached the sixth level, one would be able to sense the mysterious power of the natural laws and engrave it into one’s body.

However, the mysterious power of the natural laws were extremely complex. It was easy to imagine how difficult it was to engrave it.

Usually, most cultivators could only engrave a portion of it into their bodies.

Of course, the higher the cultivator’s comprehension value, the more of it they could engrave into their body.

Ye Xuan’s expression was solemn. The power of heavenly lightning within his finger danced like a pen as it engraved the mysterious power of the natural laws in the sky.

Most cultivators were only able to engrave 20%, but this was not Ye Xuan’s limit.

In the blink of an eye, Ye Xuan had already engraved 30%.

However, since it was derived from a supreme intent, the difficulty of engraving was also increased significantly.

33%…

39%…

42%…

44%…

…

When Ye Xuan’s engraving progress reached 50%, no matter how much he tried, he was unable to proceed further.

Hu!

Ye Xuan took a deep breath.

With his current strength, engraving this 50% of the mysterious power of the natural laws had consumed all of his spiritual power and the spiritual energy in his surroundings.

Boom!

Moments later, the profound pattern suddenly took shape and emitted a terrifying pressure that made the world tremble.

This was the profound pattern he engraved!

It contained 50% of the mysterious power of the natural laws.

“Engrave!”

Ye Xuan growled, and the profound pattern descended on his body.

Boom!

Ye Xuan felt like his entire body was about to explode.

His body was being filled with too much energy. However, as Ye Xuan’s spiritual sense was activated, it guided the energy and gradually fused it into every cell in his body.

Soon, the profound pattern of heavenly lightning was completely engraved into his body, and Ye Xuan’s body was strengthened again, as the power of the natural laws tempered his body again and again.

Every single cell was imbued with an enormous amount of energy. This whole process lasted an hour, after which, the power of the natural laws dispersed, and the Tower of Heaven returned to its original state.

The terrifying spiritual pressure in the spatial turbulence and outside world also dissipated, as if nothing had happened.

Ye Xuan examined the changes in his body, and his eyes glowed brightly.

Buzzzzzz!

Ye Xuan’s figure flashed and suddenly turned into a lightning bolt that was filled with destructive power. In an instant, he penetrated the spatial barrier around the Tower of Heaven and appeared in the spatial turbulence.

Shangguan Wan’er only felt a purple light flash past her eyes before Ye Xuan’s figure suddenly appeared in front of her.

This guy actually turned into heavenly lightning!

“My precious disciple, you’ve finally come to find your teacher!”

Ye Xuan’s gaze fell on Shangguan Wan’er, and a wry smile hung on his lips.

Shangguan Wan’er was too shocked to react.

She could barely bring herself to believe that Ye Xuan had engraved the profound pattern of heavenly lightning.

It was a profound pattern derived from supreme intent!

Was this something he had achieved in his previous life, or was it something he achieved in his current life?

Shangguan Wan’er was uncertain. Either way, it meant that Ye Xuan was extraordinary.

This further strengthened her belief that Ye Xuan was hiding his strength. There was no way a mere tenth-level unity realm cultivator would be able to engrave the profound pattern of heavenly lightning within a short year.

Then, she finally reacted.

“You’re spouting nonsense. When did I become your disciple?”

Ye Xuan’s mouth twitched when he heard this.

Was this woman really the reincarnation of an ancient great empress?

This tsundere was just too cute!

“Hehe, if you didn’t want to be my disciple, why did you crush that jade token?”

Ye Xuan’s lips curled into a smile as he looked at her teasingly.

“Speaking of that jade token, I’m furious! You were clearly toying with me!”

“Otherwise, why didn’t I see you after I crushed the jade token?”

Rip!

Just as the two of them were trading tit for tat, the space around them suddenly rippled, and Jun Lingtian’s figure appeared.

Seeing this, Shangguan Wan’er froze, and her expression became a little awkward.

‘Damn it! I forgot about this guy!’

‘Did he hear what we said?’

‘If he did, should I kill him?’

Shangguan Wan’er stared at Jun Lingtian.

“Eh?!”

Jun Lingtian narrowed his eyes when he saw their expressions and reactions. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Why did he have the feeling that the relationship between these two was somewhat special?

The master of Luo Heaven Palace was renowned for having no interest in men, yet she seemed to have a close relationship with Ye Xuan.

Something was not adding up here.

What did Ye Xuan do to her?

Still, Jun Lingtian chose to suppress his curiosity.

The two people in front of him were big shots. if he provoked either of them, he would not be able to bear the consequences.

He could only pretend that he had not seen anything.

“Greetings, Brother Ye!”

“This is my ancestor’s jade token. He specifically instructed me to give it to you.”

Jun Lingtian waved his sleeve, and a jade token suddenly landed in front of Ye Xuan.

Ye Xuan reached out and took it. After examining it with his spiritual sense, his eyes revealed a trace of surprise.

This jade token contained powerful energy. It had to have been created by some super expert. Moreover, it was a comprehensive jade token that combined speed, defense and offense.

“Many thanks, Brother Jun!”

Ye Xuan cupped his fists toward Jun Lingtian and nodded with a smile.
