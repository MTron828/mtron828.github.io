Chapter 46: It Would Be Great If I Could Become His Disciple

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The second choice was to marry Li Qingyan into the Chen family.

However, if they made such a choice, the Li family would become a subsidiary of the Chen family. As long as the Mad Saber sect was the backing of the Chen family, the Li family would never be able to rise again.

Although such a choice was indeed shameful, the Li family had no better way out.

As everyone knew, Chen Ping greatly admired Li Qingyan, but the latter was not interested in the former.

Most importantly, because of some of Chen Ping’s actions, Li Qingyan actually disliked him.

Li Zhengyang was also very much against it at the beginning. First of all, his own daughter hated Chen Ping very much. Secondly, he also did not like Chen Ping’s character.

This guy was a true playboy. He loafed around all day, and was constantly on the prowl for girls.

How could he let his daughter be sullied by this piece of cow dung? Was the leader of the Mad Saber sect blind? How could he accept such a b*stard as his disciple?

“Sigh!”

Li Zhengyang sat alone in the hall. Looking at the empty hall in front of him, he sighed deeply.

The first elder was right. He could not be so selfish. Besides being a father, he was also the head of the Li family. He had to think about the future of the Li family.

Then, Li Zhengyang walked out with a pale face. As soon as he stepped out of the hall, he saw Li Qingyan walking toward him.

“Qingyan!”

......

Li Zhengyang took a deep breath and a smile appeared on his pale face.

“Father!”

Seeing this, Li Qingyan also smiled.

Seeing this scene, Li Zhengyang’s heart ached. His daughter’s smile was too precious, and he was really unwilling to let things end this way.

“The family council has already…” Li Zhengyang looked at his darling daughter, but he still could not bring himself to say the words out loud.

“Father, I understand!”

“And I have already thought it through. Although I really hate his character, for the sake of our Li family, I… I… will…”

Li Qingyan looked at her pale father. She originally wanted to convince him that she was alright with this, but she could not hold herself back. Her eyes suddenly turned red, and tears filled her eyes. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

If possible, she really did not want to marry that playboy who was always looking for women.

However, she was no longer a willful child. After her mother passed away, Li Qingyan became very mature and took up many of the family’s responsibilities.

Moreover, Li Qingyan was very clear in her heart that the law of the jungle reigned supreme on the Tianyuan continent. The weak were destined to suffer in silence.

Originally, Li Qingyan would rather die than marry Chen Ping. However, if she died, then what would happen to the thousands of people in the Li family? They would definitely be buried with her.

A few days ago, the second elder had brought this brother and sister pair to Jiaohei City to bid for the soul returning pill. Unfortunately, the soul returning pill ultimately fell into the hands of the deputy leader of the Shadow Tower, Lin You.

At that time, Li Qingyan deliberately stayed a few days longer there to see if she could find some healing medication in the smaller-scale auctions held there. Unfortunately, things backfired and she did not get what she wanted.

After all, the soul returning pill was a top-tier third-grade pill. Even cultivators who had reached the core formation realm could hardly bear to use it. How would it be possible for one to appear frequently in Jiaohei City’s auctions?

However, without the soul returning pill, her father’s injuries would not be able to recover.

In fact, even if she did manage to obtain the soul returning pill, it would not be able to change the current situation of the Li family. After all, in front of a core formation realm cultivator, even if Li Zhengyang’s cultivation had reached the tenth level of purple spirit realm, he would still be instantly killed. There was simply no way for him to resist a core formation realm cultivator.

“Father, you don’t have to say it. I know what needs to be done!”

Li Qingyan turned around and tried her best not to cry. However, her delicate body could not help but tremble slightly.

“Sigh!”

When Li Zhengyang saw this, he opened his mouth but did not know what to say. He could only sigh deeply.

He clenched his fists so tightly that his nails dug into his palm.

This only happened because he was useless. If he was a little stronger, the Li family would not be in such a grim situation. Then his precious daughter would not have to sacrifice her happiness to this useless playboy.

At this moment, Li Zhengyang’s heart was filled with hatred for himself. However, when he thought about the terrifying core formation realm strength of the Mad Saber sect’s master, his face revealed a look of despair.

The difference between a core formation realm cultivator and a purple spirit realm cultivator was akin to the difference between heaven and earth. Moreover, he was still heavily injured. The Li family stood no chance against the Mad Saber sect.

Li Qingyan was also clear about the terror of a core formation realm cultivator. Back then, when she was at the Jiaohei City auction house, she had personally witnessed the terrifying strength of a core formation realm cultivator.

That incomparably arrogant vice commander of the Evil Blood sect had been turned into ashes with a wave of that person’s hand.

That scene back there greatly moved Li Qingyan’s heart and gave her a deeper understanding of the core formation realm.

Even now, when she recalled it, her heart yearned for that power. If she possessed that terrifying power, then she would be able to avert this tragedy!

At that time, even though the Mad Saber sect’s master was also a core formation realm cultivator, she would not need to be afraid.

After all, that young man at the core formation realm had used absolute power to force the master of the auction house to alter the rules.

Unfortunately, it was just wishful thinking.

At that time, Li Qingyan also had some guesses about Ye Xuan’s identity. She had also guessed that he was most likely the elder of the Qingyun sect, Ye Xuan, but she was not 100% certain.

“Sigh! Even if my strength will never be as strong as that senior’s, it would be a blessing if I could become that senior’s disciple!”

Thinking this, Li Qingyan could not help but sigh deeply.

If her teacher was as powerful as that young man, even the leader of the Mad Saber sect would have to back down, right?

“Huh?”

At this moment, Li Qingyan’s body felt like it had been struck by lightning. She was stunned senseless.

Something, no, someone, unbelievable had indeed appeared in front of her.

A handsome, sharp-eyed young man with starry eyes had suddenly appeared in the Li family’s courtyard.

More importantly, if she had not seen him with her own two eyes, there was no way she would know he was there. It would be impossible to detect the other party’s presence using spiritual sense. He was like a ghost.

The reason why Li Qingyan was so shocked was that she recognized this young man. He was the top-tier powerhouse who had killed the deputy commander of the Evil Blood sect, Feng Yitai, in the Jiaohei City auction house.

“Why is he here?”

Li Qingyan’s eyes were filled with shock. Why did this top-tier powerhouse appear in the Li family’s residence?

Did God hear my prayers? Did He fulfill my wishes?

Or was this just an illusion?

Li Qingyan immediately rubbed her eyes to check if what she was seeing was real. She then looked at him again. The handsome young man was really still there.

“It… it’s really him…”

At that moment, Li Qingyan’s heart could not help but beat rapidly. She knew that the young man’s cultivation had reached the core formation realm.

However, why did he come to our Li family’s residence?
