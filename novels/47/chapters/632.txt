633 Heaven-Splitting Sword

Seeing Elder Huang’s expression, Ye Xuan just smiled and then took out a herb from his storage space, which stunned the former once again.

F*ck!

‘Alright, alright, I get it already!’

“Junior Brother Ye, you don’t have to worry at all. Just leave this little girl to me. I’ll definitely teach her well. There won’t be any accidents with me around, okay?”

!!

Old Huang patted his chest confidently.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan was relieved.

Sure enough, no matter where one was, there were some principles that were surprisingly consistent. Bribery was the sincerest form of flattery.

These two things were just common things to Ye Xuan, but it was different for Elder Huang. They were truly rare treasures. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Xiang Yun had successfully rejoined the study hall, so everything was good. Once again, he threw the herb on the ground and said, “Oh my god, Elder Huang, why are you always so careless? You actually lost a herb again!”

Hearing this, Elder Huang immediately burst out laughing.

“Hehe, Junior Brother Ye, I’ve embarrassed myself. I’m already getting older, so it’s normal for me to forget a few things.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Elder Huang immediately picked up the herb on the ground. He was so excited that he was unable to speak.

He really did not expect Ye Xuan to be so generous. In comparison, the other chiefs seemed stingy.

Cloud Sky peak was indeed extraordinary and overbearing.

“Junior Brother Ye, just listen to me and don’t worry at all. Just leave this matter to me. You can go and do your own things with peace of mind,” Elder Huang said with confidence.

Hearing this, a smile appeared on Ye Xuan’s face. Then he turned around to look at Xiang Yun and said, “Yun’er, you have to be obedient this time, understand?”

“You can’t cause any more trouble. Once you learn how to read, I’ll naturally teach you some powerful techniques.”

Hearing this, Xiang Yun smiled happily and nodded.

“Teacher, I understand. I’ll definitely learn to read seriously this time.”

“Elder Huang, hurry up and bring me inside to learn how to read.”

After saying this, Xiang Yun dragged Elder Huang by his clothes and entered the study hall.

Seeing this, Elder Huang was dumbfounded. Could it be that this little girl had really changed completely?

Why did she want to learn how to read so badly?

It seemed that she was not a hopeless case after all.

If it was like this, then there was nothing to worry about.

Thus, Elder Huang smiled happily.

Elder Huang waved at Ye Xuan and then led Xiang Yun in.

Just before she entered, Xiang Yun did not forget to turn around and wave goodbye to Ye Xuan, which filled him with hope.

He hoped that she would be able to succeed this time.

Before he left, Ye Xuan first secretly peeked inside to see if she was seriously learning how to read. Only then did he dare to return to Cloud Sky peak with a peace of mind.

At that moment, the system’s notification arrived.

“Ding! As you have gifted your disciple a heaven-grade divine power, vanishing shadow, you have received a 10,000x critical reward!”

“Ding! As you have given Elder Huang a treasured ruler and a rare herb, you have received a 10,000x critical reward!”

Elder Huang thought that he had definitely made a fortune by accepting these two treasures. However, thanks to the system, the biggest beneficiary was Ye Xuan himself.

“Congratulations! The host has obtained the secret technique, the heaven-splitting sword!”

“Congratulations! The host has obtained a rare spiritual weapon, inferno ruler, and a middle-grade spirit herb, sky heart flower.”

The reward that shocked Ye Xuan was the secret technique.

Even the name itself spoke volumes of how powerful it was.

Once he read its description, he was even more thrilled.

This secret skill technique could even cross space and take the enemy’s head from ten thousand meters away!

It was a showy skill that was simply perfect for him.

Ye Xuan examined it carefully again and found that this secret technique’s power was also not to be underestimated.

It could even be compared to the third move of his Flora Sword technique, and could even target those enemies with extremely strong spatial capabilities.

“On the whole, this is a very good move,” Ye Xuan muttered to himself with a smile.

Exchanging a heaven-grade divine power for this secret technique was simply a great deal.

“Ding! Do you want to learn the heaven-splitting sword now?”

After hearing this prompt, Ye Xuan smiled and said, “Yes…”

As soon as he finished speaking, bursts of red light appeared in Ye Xuan’s mind, and divine text and insights were imprinted into his mind one after another.

With Ye Xuan’s amazing comprehension ability, he gained a rough grasp of it in just a few moments.

After all, Ye Xuan’s talent in terms of the Sword Dao was unfathomably high. While Ye Xuan was immersed in his state of comprehension, Ao Lei arrived at the study hall and stared at him with wide eyes…
