From the looks of it, the opportunity Ye Xuan had obtained this time was no small one.

After all, two days ago, everyone knew that Ye Xuan had been poisoned and was likely going to die very soon.

However, not only was Ye Xuan completely cured of the poison now, but he had also made great progress in terms of his strength.

Could it be that Ye Xuan had obtained a top-tier fourth-grade pill, which was why he had come across such a great ‘opportunity’?

No one knew that Ye Xuan had ingested bone-dissolving powder earlier.

Therefore, everyone thought that a fourth-grade pill would be able to dispel the five-poison powder and give Ye Xuan a certain increase in strength.

If they were to find out that Ye Xuan had taken a seventh-grade pill two days ago, everyone would probably be so shocked that their jaws would drop to the floor.

At this moment, Wan Shanhai, the sect master of the Qingyun sect, woke up from his initial shock.

He laughed heartily and said, “That’s great! Now our Qingyun sect has finally gained another true core realm expert!”

Wan Shanhai was really delighted at Ye Xuan’s breakthrough.

Previously, Qingyun sect only had two true core realm experts.

They were the sect master, Wan Shanhai, and the deputy sect master.

......

Now that there was another true core realm expert, Ye Xuan, this would definitely raise the overall strength of the Qingyun sect.

The atmosphere between the higher-ups of the Qingyun sect was relatively harmonious.

After all, with a force like theirs, if the higher-ups were not united, the entire sect would quickly fall apart and be replaced by external forces.

Therefore, after everyone confirmed that Ye Xuan had broken through to the true core realm, everyone stepped forward and congratulated him.

“Congratulations, congratulations!”

“Congratulations, fellow Daoist Ye, for successfully breaking through to the true core realm!”

Everyone present had a joyful look on their faces.

At this moment, Lu Yanran was standing far away from them. When she looked at Ye Xuan, her eyes were filled with joy.

After congratulating Ye Xuan, the higher-ups of the Qingyun sect left Lingjiu Peak one after another.

Ye Xuan’s breakthrough had injected a surge of energy into them.

After all, it was not easy for those at their level to have breakthroughs.

Now that there was a living example right in front of them, everyone’s motivation had been stoked.

After everyone left, soon only Ye Xuan and Lu Yanran were left on Lingjiu Peak.

“You foolish disciple!”

Ye Xuan could tell at a glance that Lu Yanran had been guarding the main hall without eating or drinking for the past two days.

“You’re too stupid!” He scolded her with some heartache.

After hearing Ye Xuan’s words, Lu Yanran knew that he was feeling heartache for her, so she quickly lowered her head.

Ye Xuan taking her in as his disciple had happened too suddenly, so Lu Yanran had simply been following his instructions to the word for the past two days.

She had been very afraid. She was afraid that if she made a slight mistake, Ye Xuan would not want her anymore.

She knew very well that her talent was lacking, and in theory, she was not worthy of being Elder Ye Xuan’s disciple.

It was precisely because of that that she cherished this opportunity so much.

She needed to become strong and avenge her family!

Ye Xuan walked to Lu Yanran’s side and rubbed her head with his hand, feeling sorry for her.

“If I didn’t come out of seclusion for a long time, were you going to starve to death here?”

Ye Xuan did not know whether to call Lu Yanran stupid or loyal.

In fact, there was food and drink not far from where they currently were.

If Lu Yanran went to eat something, although she would have to leave the hall for a short time, the risk would still be very low.

Ye Xuan said, “Go back and rest well. Tomorrow, I will give you a new opportunity.”

“Yes, sir!”

Lu Yanran nodded frantically and staggered away.

After Lu Yanran left, Ye Xuan turned his attention back onto himself.

He could see that the true core in his body contained extremely terrifying energy.

He felt that his true core was like a miniature planet.

At this moment, as long as he willed it, he could easily mobilize the terrifying energy.

A mere empty core realm expert, if placed on Earth, could be called a humanoid missile.

Meanwhile, a true core realm expert was more than ten times stronger than an empty core realm expert.

“Is this real life?”

Ye Xuan muttered to himself. He was very surprised at how terrifying he was.

With his current terrifying body, if he were still in his previous life, nothing could hurt him besides nuclear weapons.

However, he knew very well that there were countless people like him across the entire Tianyuan Continent.

Compared to other masters, he was nothing.

Even within the entire great Qian Dynasty, Ye Xuan was still not the strongest around.

However, under normal circumstances, he should be able to do whatever he wanted.

In his body, besides the true core energy, there was also a purple pill that was slowly rotating.

This was the seventh-grade nirvana pill he had consumed.

After removing the five-poison powder and bone-dissolving powder as well as breaking through, only one-seventh of the seventh-grade nirvana pill’s energy had been consumed.

The rest of the pill’s energy was still being stored in his body.

Ye Xuan could feel that after absorbing all the energy of the pill, his strength had definitely experienced a tremendous change.

“The guy from the Xuanyin sect.”

Ye Xuan muttered to himself. His current strength was more than enough for him to go and kill those who had surrounded and attacked him just a few days ago.

However, he was not in a hurry. He could still make a long-term plan right now.

After all, within the great Qian Dynasty, the overall strength of the Xuanyin sect was ranked second.

Their sect had golden core realm masters in charge.

Moreover, the Xuanyin sect should have more than 20 true core realm and empty core realm masters altogether.

Ye Xuan was very clear on the fact that it was not too safe for him to rashly go and kill the other party now.

Until he achieved the golden core realm or even the strength of the completion of the core formation realm, he could not be too confident.

If he was still the previous Ye Xuan, he would have a long way to go before he could obtain the strength of the completion of the core formation realm.

However, for Ye Xuan, who had the 10,000-fold feedback system, the day was not too far away.

He felt that he should first extract all the rewards he could get from Lu Yanran, then take in a few more disciples.

...

The next morning, Lu Yanran arrived at Lingjiu Peak very early.

After resting well the previous night, she finally recovered.
