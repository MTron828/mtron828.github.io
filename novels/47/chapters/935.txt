936 Flood Dragon And Nine-Tailed Sparrow

‘Hehehe! It’s actually the Reincarnation Dao Fruit. I have really struck gold this time!’

His face was still very calm, but Ye Xuan was already laughing excitedly inwardly. Furthermore, his words were the truth. Every time he obtained a system reward through Yanran, the critical multiplier had always been amazing. He had never been disappointed by it.

This Reincarnation Dao Fruit was extremely important to Ye Xuan, and would even lay the foundation for Ye Xuan’s future path.

Moreover, if Ye Xuan encountered a life-threatening crisis in the future, this Reincarnation Dao Fruit would become his life-saving trump card. Despite this, he had no intention of consuming this treasure right now, as the energy contained within it was explosive, to say the least.

If Ye Xuan consumed the Reincarnation Dao Fruit now, his body would not be able to withstand it at all, and he would implode from the overflowing energy. Therefore, it was safest to leave it in the system’s space until he was ready to use it.

While Ye Xuan was still immersed in his excitement, a huge roar was suddenly heard from above, and strong currents were stirred up at the bottom of the East Sea.

“What happened?”

Everyone was extremely shocked at this moment. The immortal heavenly treasure had been taken away by Ye Xuan, and the others did not dare to try and take it away from him or Yanran. After all, they all knew how terrifying Ye Xuan was.

When they heard the commotion, they turned around to go and check it out, but a dragon’s roar was heard from the bottom of the sea. Then, the entire ancient palace began to shake violently.

“A dragon’s roar? Could it be that there is a divine dragon in this ancient palace?”

Everyone suddenly became excited. Dragons were one of the four pinnacle ancient divine beasts, and there were countless legends about them.

They had powerful karmic power. Even though countless years had passed, the influence of the four ancient divine beasts had not disappeared. Within moments, more dragon roars were heard, and dark clouds gathered above.

Then, a dark flood dragon soared into the sky!

“It’s actually a flood dragon!”

Everyone’s expressions changed drastically, including Ye Xuan and Yanran’s.

“I really didn’t expect there to be a rare existence like a flood dragon in this ancient palace!”

Ye Xuan was extremely surprised at this moment. The flood dragon’s bloodline was infinitely close to the dragon race, and it possessed considerable strength.

After the great battles in ancient times, the dragon race seemed to have disappeared without a trace. Everyone believed that their bloodline had completely disappeared.

However, there was a living flood dragon in this ancient palace!

Just from the aura this flood dragon released, they could tell that it had reached the same level as the Thunder-Devouring Beast. However, the difference in their combat strength was immense.

After all, the flood dragon was not like the Thunder-Devouring Beast, who only spent his time polishing his aura to make himself look scarier, but had no actual combat strength or experience.

“Oh my god! Why is this little snake here?”

When he saw the flood dragon, the Thunder-Devouring Beast was terrified. He was so frightened that his legs trembled and he hid behind Ye Xuan without hesitation.

It was obvious that the Thunder-Devouring Beast knew about the existence of this flood dragon. Moreover, seeing how frightened he was, it was likely that he had been beaten up by it. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Despite this, Ye Xuan did not hide, and stood steadfastly in front of the Thunder-Devouring Beast. It seemed that from the looks of things, this flood dragon’s goal did not seem to be the Thunder-Devouring Beast.

“This…”

At this moment, people discovered that a dense seven-colored divine light was spreading out from the depths of the ancient palace, filling the surroundings.

When they took a closer look, their pupils involuntarily constricted, and the Thunder-Devouring Beast instantly started shouting.

“Oh my god! Big Brother, look! She’s so beautiful!”

The Thunder-Devouring Beast’s gaze was locked on this beautiful figure. His gaze was transfixed, and he could not tear his eyes away from it.

Seeing the current state of the Thunder-Devouring Beast, Ye Xuan felt extremely embarrassed. He even wanted to kick this fellow far away and pretend not to know him. It was really too embarrassing.

When the seven-colored divine light dissipated, Ye Xuan could finally see the situation clearly.

The seven-colored divine light was released by a Nine-tailed Sparrow; the very same one Ye Xuan had discovered when he first entered the ancient palace.

What was worth mentioning was that this Nine-tailed Sparrow was indeed very beautiful. Its entire body was emitting seven-colored light, giving off an ethereal and mystical feeling.

In the eyes of the Thunder-Devouring Beast, she was really beautiful, and he could not help but drool. Furthermore, the bloodline of this Nine-tailed Sparrow was extremely noble, and contained the bloodline of the phoenix. Their ancestors had also produced top-notch peerless experts.

It was precisely for this reason that the Nine-tailed Sparrow was considered the perfect Dao companion by many divine beasts. Therefore, the Thunder-Devouring Beast’s reaction was not unnatural.

However, imagining the huge Thunder-Devouring Beast and the slender figure of the Nine-tailed Sparrow left a strange taste in one’s mouth.

Thinking this, Ye Xuan could not help but laugh to himself. In the Mystic World, there were actually many marriages between different races. Combining the noble bloodlines of two ancient divine beasts would give rise to even more outstanding descendants.

It was precisely because of this that interracial marriage was such a phenomenon among almost all of the beast races. This was extremely normal, but Ye Xuan was curious…
