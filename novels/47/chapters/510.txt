511 No Mercy

Still, despite their confusion, Gao Shun had actually come over to help. His presence here meant that they no longer had to be afraid of Han Tai.

They reckoned that even though Martial Uncle Gao Shun had never left a good impression on them, when it involved the bigger picture involving the Great Wilderness Divine sect, he would still help without hesitation.

At this time, the one who was the most afraid was undoubtedly Han Tai.

He had only dared to make a move because he knew that there were no experts present from the Great Wilderness Divine sect, and Gao Shun’s appearance had undoubtedly thrown him a major curveball.

He could not even last five moves against Gao Shun, so how could he dare to be rash? RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

It was for this reason that Han Tai was still smiling even though he was injured.

“So it’s Fellow Daoist Gao. My apologies for not welcoming you properly.”

Gao Shun, on the other hand, glanced coldly at Han Tai and said contemptuously, “I don’t think we’re that familiar with each other.”

Han Tai’s face suddenly turned red and gloomy.

There were so many people present now, so those words were clearly meant to humiliate him.

“Oh? Why do you say so?”

“Hehe, are you still going to play dumb?”

Gao Shun instantly laughed out loud, and then he flew over, looking down at Han Tai.

“As an elder of the Supreme Divine sect, you took advantage of your seniority to deal with the younger generation of my sect. Are you disregarding the chiefs of my sect?”

As soon as he finished speaking, Gao Shun released an even fiercer aura, his eyes staring straight at Han Tai.

At this moment, Han Tai was completely dumbfounded. He immediately said, “Fellow Daoist Gao, this little girl is too ruthless. It was just a friendly fight, yet she was so ruthless. What if she grows up to become an evil person in the future?”

“I was just thinking of teaching her a lesson on behalf of the Great Wilderness Divine sect to save you some energy, okay?”

After hearing this, Gao Shun laughed again.

“That’s the funniest thing I’ve ever heard. Do we need you to meddle in our affairs?”

“Aren’t you extending your claws too far?”

“Even if our disciples have made a huge mistake, it’s our own business. Why do you need to get involved?”

“Moreover, it’s normal to suffer injuries in a fight. What did she do wrong?”

Gao Shun’s words made Han Tai’s expression darken. It seemed that Gao Shun had no intention of resolving this matter with words and had completely shed all pretenses of cordiality.

He glanced at Han Tai coldly, and then turned to Xie Tianyu, who was standing behind him.

“Such a person can be considered a genius? Simply ridiculous!”

“Our disciple only joined the sect less than four months ago, yet your Saint can’t even beat her. What a waste of cultivation resources.”

Hearing this, Xie Tianyu’s face instantly turned red, and he wanted to dig a hole and bury himself in it.

“Is that true? Zhuge Yueyue only joined the sect less than four months ago?”

After hearing Gao Shun’s words, everyone’s mouths widened in shock.

How had she reached the void realm so quickly.

“Oh my god! Is Zhuge Yueyue a monster? Or are there immortal herbs growing everywhere on Cloud Sky peak?”

At this moment, everyone was shocked by Zhuge Yueyue’s level of monstrousness, and they were also shocked by Ye Xuan.

There was no lack of geniuses in this world, but what was lacking were the eyes to unearth them and the ability to nurture them.

No matter how talented you were, you would not be able to achieve anything significant without someone to guide you.

At this moment, Han Tai’s face was gloomy.

“Looking at how your Supreme Divine sect behaves, bullying the younger generation like this, it’s simply shameless.”

Gao Shun still jabbered on and on.

Han Tai could not take it anymore. He gritted his teeth and said, “Fellow Daoist Gao, don’t oversimplify or generalize things!”

“Oh?” After hearing Han Tai, Gao Shun immediately responded, “The practice of the Great Wilderness Divine sect has always been to not attack unless attacked.”

After a pause, Gao Shun stared at Han Tai coldly again and said, “Your actions today have humiliated your entire sect!”

“Since you’re unhappy with the results of the match between them, why don’t we have another match?”

“Show me how strong an elder of the Supreme Divine sect is!”
