Chapter 222: Old Dogs

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Ye Xuan had now reached the ninth level of the unity realm, and comprehended various intents, the strongest of which was his eighth-level sword intent.

Although he was not too clear about how strong a pattern condensation realm cultivator was, he felt that he would have a chance at beating perhaps a first or second-level pattern condensation realm cultivator. It was a strange feeling.

Furthermore, he would only get stronger after he received the reward for helping Li Qingyan strengthen her dual-spirit body.

Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!

Ye Xuan’s thoughts were interrupted by the arrival of those four inner sect elders from the Nether God sect.

Earlier…

“Is the communication token within range yet?”

One of the inner sect elders asked.

“No, I haven’t been able to reach Elder Gongsun’s communication token yet. We’re still out of range.”

Another inner sect elder shook his head.

“Ye Xuan only left a few hours earlier than us. Given our speed, we should be able to catch up soon! If we can send a message to Elder Gongsun before that, we can pincer attack Ye Xuan and kill him!”

“If that’s the case, then wouldn’t our request to have Sect Master act personally be redundant?”

“It’s okay! The only reason why we requested Sect Master’s assistance was to prevent any accidents! Although Ye Xuan is powerful, if we join forces with Elder Gongsun, we can definitely kill him.”

“No matter how strong this fellow is, he’s at most a seventh-level unity realm expert. Even if he has hidden many trump cards, that would make him as strong as an eighth-level unity realm expert at most!”

“What if Ye Xuan is a ninth-level unity realm expert?”

Suddenly, an inner sect elder asked worriedly.

As soon as he finished his words, the others fell silent. They could not rule out that possibility.

Logically speaking, it was impossible, but Ye Xuan was a genius who created miracles.

A 20-year-old ninth-level unity realm expert?

Surely not, right?

Even if he had started cultivating in his mother’s womb, it should not be possible, right?

“According to the ancient records, even those earth-shattering almighty experts did not reach the fourth level of the unity realm by the age of 20. He’s miraculous for sure, but not that miraculous.”

“Besides, even if the impossible happens, we can still kill him as long as we work with Elder Gongsun.”

“With Elder Gongsun as the vanguard, we’ll use our formation to delay Ye Xuan. Even if we can’t kill him, we can at least hold him back and consume his spiritual power.”

“Then, once Sect Master arrives, his fate will be sealed!”

After that, they decisively ended their discussion. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Of these four, one was a seventh-level unity realm expert, two were peak seventh-level unity realm experts, and the last was a genuine eighth-level unity realm expert.

Such a lineup could only be fielded by the major forces of the Nanzhou Region. Working together, they were a terrifying force to be reckoned with and feared.

“There seems to be a pretty powerful empire not far away.”

At this moment, an elder looked in a certain direction, in which the ground below was filled with countless buildings.

However, before he could say anything further, his eyes suddenly narrowed.

A black dot suddenly appeared in his field of vision.

He was not the only one. The other elders had also sensed it.

“The aura of a Tier 6 demonic beast?”

The elders all sensed the black flame eagle’s aura.

However, they could not sense Ye Xuan’s presence, as he had perfectly concealed his aura.

At this moment, the elders hurriedly stopped and looked at each other. They all felt that something was not right.

There was a handsome young man on the black flame eagle’s back, and he seemed to be watching them.

“Take them away!”

Ye Xuan instructed the black flame eagle.

The inner sect elders of the Nether God sect were powerful, so the black flame eagle would not be able to shield Yue and the others from the shockwaves of the battle.

The black flame eagle was also aware of this, so it immediately flew toward the ground with Yue and the others, which happened to be the territory of a certain empire that the inner sect elder had been talking about earlier.

Buzzzzzz!

After the black flame eagle left, Ye Xuan took a step forward and his figure disappeared.

“You lot are the old dogs of the Nether God sect?”

At the same time, Ye Xuan’s voice suddenly rang out.

“Ye Xuan?”

The elders of the Nether God sect were shocked, and murderous intent flashed across their eyes.

This guy was really courting death. He actually dared to call them old dogs!

“Oh? It seems that some old dogs have caught up!”

Ye Xuan stood in mid-air, looking down at them, and said indifferently.

“If you want to kill me, then just try it.”
