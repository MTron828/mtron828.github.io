“Stop her!”

At this moment, the onlookers became united as they launched attacks together to stop Yanran.

At this moment, Yanran’s expression was unprecedentedly cold. Without saying a word, she activated the Great Desolation technique to launch a counterattack.

Who did not want to obtain the immortal heavenly treasure? She would not show mercy to anyone who dared to block her!

At this moment, her Great Desolation domain had enveloped everyone in the vicinity, and the strong pressure she exuded forced those with lower cultivation levels to retreat and give up.

After all, they were too weak. If they joined in the fight, the only possible ending for them was severe injuries or death.

Boom…

One after another, violent collision sounds rang out. The battle became more and more heated.

Yanran was holding the mammoth cauldron with one hand, while continuously using the Great Desolation technique with the other, suppressing those who got close to her.

Even Ye Xuan was shocked to see her like this.

‘Haha, as expected of my woman. She’s really strong!’

As for the assassin leader and Ou Yunhai, they were already locked in a fierce battle.

All of a sudden, a huge palm condensed from spiritual power appeared in the sky and tried to grab the red spider lily.

“Shameless fool, you actually want to fish in troubled waters,” Mo Yunhai said with a gloomy face, and immediately launched an attack.

He instantly transformed into a giant Roc. Flapping his wings, he released a dense rain of feather arrows toward the huge palm in the sky.

There was a brief collision, and then the huge palm collapsed.

At the same time, an old man with a dark face appeared within everyone’s field of vision. He was the cultivator who wanted to take advantage of the situation.

“I was wondering who it was. It’s the Elder Mo Feilin.”

Mo Yunhai sneered, looking down on Mo Feilin’s actions.

Moments later, they started fighting fiercely, kickstarting another battle.

The originally peaceful area was now in chaos. Sometimes, it was hard to tell who were friends and who were enemies.

Although some might be cordial on the surface, when it came to fighting for one’s own interests, they would not hesitate to draw their swords.

At this moment, facing so many cultivators, Yanran also felt a little strained.

If this situation continued, it would not take long for her to be defeated.

When she saw that Ye Xuan was still watching the show, she suddenly became angry and roared.

“Ye Xuan, what are you doing? Hurry up and come help me!”

‘I’ve wasted so much of my strength in the battle just now, but he is still watching the show. If this continues, I will end up crippled!’

After hearing her urgent call, Ye Xuan smiled. She finally remembered that he was around.

“Haha, I’m coming, I’m coming.”

After stretching his muscles, Ye Xuan instantly flew up to the sky to help Yanran out.

However, at this moment, Ou Yunhai decided to swing his sword at Ye Xuan, trying to catch him off guard and kill him.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan was annoyed. Did this fool consider him to be easy pickings?

“I don’t have time to deal with you right now. Get lost!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan casually waved his hand and released a violent sword strike, instantly disintegrating Ou Yunhai’s attack.

On the other hand, the assassin leader seemed to have been possessed by the devil. No matter who stood beside him, they could not escape from his wild attacks.

“The immortal heavenly treasure belongs to me! I’ll kill whoever snatches it!”

Hearing this, Ou Yunhai laughed once more.

“Hehe, damn b*stard. I was just messing around with you just now, but that made you arrogant, huh?”

“Do you think it’s that easy to obtain the immortal heavenly treasure? You’ll have to beat me first!”

“By the way, Ye Xuan, you’re quite arrogant. If you have the ability, come at me as well. I have no problem taking on both of you,” Ou Yunhai said heroically and pridefully.

“Pfft… Don’t make me laugh, okay?”

Ye Xuan laughed. It was actually very easy to get the immortal heavenly treasure. All he had to do was defeat everyone present.

“Since you’re so eager to die, I’ll reluctantly agree to your request.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan once again launched a sword beam at Ou Yunhai, but the latter managed to block it.

Seeing that Ye Xuan had joined the battle, the assassin leader sneakily began to stand by and watch. He even began to quietly eye the immortal heavenly treasure.

His thoughts were easy to figure out, so Ye Xuan and Ou Yunhai, who were still fighting intensely, suddenly attacked the assassin leader, injuring him.

At this moment, almost everyone was fighting.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan frowned.

If this situation continued to develop, he would not be able to hold on for long given his limited spiritual power as an early-stage supreme realm cultivator.

After hesitating for a while, Ye Xuan glanced at Yanran, who was in the sky.

She was facing everyone’s attacks. If he did not hurry over to help, she might really be in trouble.

As a result, he decided not to continue fighting the assassin leader and Ou Yunhai, and started to activate the fiery phoenix divine power to rush over to help her.

“Haha, you want to run? Stop right there!”

Before Ye Xuan could leave, Ou Yunhai launched another attack to stop him.

...

At this moment, Ye Xuan could no longer suppress the anger in his heart.

“You really think I’m a pushover, huh?”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan took out his Cloud Heaven Sword without hesitation.

The moment the Cloud Heaven Sword appeared, it was as if someone had pressed the pause button. Everyone stopped fighting in unison.

“Ah!”

“Why does Ye Xuan possess such a divine-rank sword?” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The powerful aura released by the Cloud Heaven Sword even suppressed the aura of the immortal heavenly treasure.

Seeing this, Ou Yunhai’s face turned pale and powerless. He stared at the Cloud Heaven Sword in Ye Xuan’s hand in disbelief.
