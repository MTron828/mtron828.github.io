681 Catching Up (Part 3)

Now, to his shock and horror, that other disciple actually dared to rub Xiang Yun’s head.

Was this guy trying to get them all killed?

Xiang Yun looked at the disciple who was rubbing her head with dissatisfaction, and briefly considered hitting him with her hammer. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Mind your own business,” she said unhappily, her face puffed up in anger.

“Oh my god, this little girl is really cute.”

Seeing her face puff up, the young man instantly laughed and could not help but rub her head again.

“Uh, he really doesn’t want to live.”

After seeing what this disciple had done, the disciples who had luckily escaped Xiang Yun earlier began to quietly retreat, clearly afraid of a repeat of what had happened earlier.

The guy, who was still rubbing Xiang Yun’s head, asked, “Little friend, tell me, who is your teacher? And how did you get here?”

“My teacher is Ye Xuan. What about you? Is your teacher strong?”

“Ye Xuan? That feels somewhat familiar”

“In any case, my teacher is also quite strong. He is the leader of the Tianxia Academy. His name is Liu Xinghe.”

“How about it? My teacher is amazing, isn’t he? Can your teacher compare to mine?”

On the outside, the leader of Tianxia Academy trembled after hearing his disciple’s words.

‘F*ck’

‘If you want to show off, then do it with your own skills and strength! Why are you dragging me into this?’

At this moment, Liu Xinghe suddenly noticed Ye Xuan’s gaze and trembled slightly.

“Cough cough, Little Brother Ye, don’t take his words seriously. My disciple is too inexperienced and lacks wisdom,” Liu Xinghe said awkwardly.

Inside the ancient realm, Xiang Yun was thinking hard because she had never heard of the Tianxia Academy or Liu Xinghe. However, she decided that it did not matter anyway.

“No way! My teacher is the strongest in history. Your teacher sucks.”

After hearing this, the man smiled. This little girl simply said whatever came to her mind.

His teacher was a peak-level mystic lord realm expert. Was that not strong enough?

“Hmm, then tell me. Where is your teacher from and how strong is he exactly?”

“My teacher is from Cloud Sky peak,” Xiang Yun replied without hesitation.

“Eh?”

When he heard the words ‘Cloud Sky peak,’ the man instantly stopped smiling.

There was only one Cloud Sky peak in the East continent, and only one person named Ye Xuan related to it, who was its chief.

“Uh, I was just teasing you!”

The man finally came back to his senses. This little girl’s teacher was actually the chief of the Great Wilderness Divine sect’s Cloud Sky peak. The one everyone called a sword immortal!

It was no wonder he felt that the name sounded so familiar!

“Hahaha, you’re actually from Cloud Sky peak. You were right, you were right. Your teacher is really too strong. I was really ignorant just now. I’m sorry.”

“How could my teacher dare to compare with your teacher? There’s no comparison at all. The difference is like heaven and earth.”

This man did not hesitate at all. In order to praise Ye Xuan, he deliberately belittled his teacher. Inwardly, he silently prayed that his teacher would not find out about what he had said.

Liu Xinghe’s face darkened when he heard this.

He decided that when his disciple exited the ancient realm, he would teach him a good lesson. He instructed one of the disciples next to him to prepare a whip for later.

When the rest of the cultivators in that space discovered that Xiang Yun was Ye Xuan’s disciple, they immediately came forward to curry favor with her.

“I knew it. You’re Ye Xuan’s disciple. It’s no wonder you managed to reach this place.”

“You’re still so young, but so strong! You must be a peerless genius!”

Hearing their praise, Xiang Yun laughed happily. It seemed that everyone recognized her teacher’s strength.

Looking around, she asked, “By the way, do you know where my First Sister is?”

Hearing this, they suddenly recalled that Zhuge Yueyue had just entered the Summit Space not long ago, and quickly replied, “She just left here not long ago and went over to the next space.”

“Uh…”

Xiang Yun had rushed over because Feng Xiyun had told her that Zhuge Yueyue was just up ahead.

She had been hoping to meet up with her here, but now felt a little disappointed that she had just missed her.

At this moment, another disciple spoke, “If you really want to find her, it’s not difficult. Don’t you see the big rock over there?

“That’s actually the testing rock. If you can successfully complete the test, you can join her in the next space.”

Hearing this, Xiang Yun happily skipped over to the boulder without hesitation.

Another disciple quickly explained, “If you want to pass the test, your state of mind must be rock solid. Otherwise, you will end up staying here like us”
