660 Show Of Force (Part 1)

“Daoist Black Iron seems to be quite confident in your disciples.”

Ao Lei spoke ambiguously, causing Daoist Black Iron to involuntarily tremble.

When Ao Lei smiled like that, nothing good would happen. The same thing had happened with the Immortal Divine sect back then.

However, now that things had come to this, there was no need to be a coward.

“Tsk, so what? Although the disciples I’ve taken in can’t be considered peerless geniuses, it’s completely within their means for them to teach those who don’t know their place a lesson.”

Upon hearing this, Ao Lei burst into laughter, then turned to Hua Rufeng.

“Rufeng, did you hear that? I’m sure you know what to do, right?”

Hua Rufeng smiled. He was dressed in a white robe and looked very elegant. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

As the eldest disciple of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, he had to lead the way during this gathering.

“Martial Uncle Ao, don’t worry. I know how to deal with this matter.”

Hua Rufeng turned to look at Xie Tianyu after he finished speaking and smirked.

Ye Xuan could not help but laugh. These Supreme Divine sect cultivators, no matter which generation they were from, were all good at blustering.

However, whether it was all empty talk or not would be discovered when they really started fighting later.

“Enough, there’s no point in indulging in so much pointless chit chat. We’ll know the outcome when they fight later.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan no longer paid attention to the matter and walked over to the side to wait quietly.

As time passed, streams of light drifted out from the top of the mountain.

The gathering had officially started!

In the sky, lines of golden text appeared, which listed the previous champions of the gathering. Tian Xuan’s name was also there. Aside from that ranking, there was also another ranking, called the potential ranking.

As the name suggested, the potential ranking was related to the potential of the participants. However, there were no names on it yet. After all, the participants had not entered the ancient realm yet.

“It’s finally about to open…”

Most of the people present stood up involuntarily when they saw the lines of golden text. Many were pacing around, awaiting the moment they could enter. Everyone was raring to go.

This was their chance to make a name for themselves.

At the moment, there were only a few people that everyone considered frontrunners for the title of champion.

This included Mu Beichen, the Reincarnation Fairy, Zhuge Yueyue, Xie Tianyu, and Xu Changqing.

As for the others, they were either unknown, or were not famous enough. For example, Hua Rufeng was quite strong, but he was not included in the list of potential winners, as he lived a rather low-key life within the Great WIlderness Divine sect.

There were definitely more like him within the participants this time, and only time would tell how strong they were.

At this moment, an old man was looking at a disciple and exhorting him, “Yunhai, I’ll leave the rest to you.”

If you can win, you can also obtain the blessing of fate. You must cherish this opportunity, or my efforts will be wasted.”

After hearing these words, the disciple calmly put away his paper fan and said with confidence, “Teacher, I have everything under control. You can rest assured. I’ll let them fight amongst themselves at the start. When they’re exhausted, I’ll make my grand entrance.”

It was obvious that many people had the same plan. Everyone wanted to take advantage of the conflict.

At this time, Ye Xuan squatted down and rubbed Xiang Yun’s head.

“Yun’er, you must listen to your senior sisters later. You must not act rashly, understand?”

“Teacher, I understand. I won’t do anything rash,” she replied obediently.

After saying this, Ye Xuan turned to Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun and reminded them again, “Safety first, and take care of your third sister while you’re inside.”

“Okay, Teacher.”

The two of them agreed in unison, and then set their eyes on the entrance to the ancient realm.

Moments later, a flash of golden light erupted, and the entrance to the ancient realm opened completely.

“Go on in.”

Ye Xuan said to his three disciples, and then they immediately flew toward the entrance.

Zhuge Yueyue was flying at the very front. She had already entered the spatial zone, and Feng Xiyun was following closely behind.

Right at this moment, someone unleashed a sword beam from behind Feng Xiyun.

This person from the Supreme Divine sect had actually launched a sneak attack, causing Feng Xiyun to turn pale with fright.

They had not even entered the ancient realm, yet this guy was already making his move?

Many people were surprised, but Daoist Gu Hao was smiling very happily.

However, his happiness was only temporary. Before the person from the Supreme Divine sect could successfully complete his attack, a huge hammer descended from above him.

Moments later, with a loud boom, the man from the Supreme Divine sect was instantly crushed and died.

“You actually tried to attack my second sister? You’re courting death!”

Xiang Yun held the hammer with one hand and placed the other hand on her waist as she said this in a domineering manner.

At this moment, no disciple dared to approach her. They were dumbfounded.

Heavens!

Where did such a fierce little girl come from?

That was a void realm cultivator she had just insta-killed, right?
