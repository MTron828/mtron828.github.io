Chapter 152: Hit Me With Everything You’ve Got

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

It now made sense as to why those cultivators who had reached the unity realm were all old monsters. It was basically impossible for young cultivators to reach the unity realm.

Unless of course a cultivator’s innate bone value could exceed 700 points or higher.

However, how could such a rare genius appear in the tiny Nanzhou Region?

Whoosh!

Ye Xuan took a deep breath.

What should have taken him 40 years to achieve was completed in a moment because of his awesome system.

If that monk appeared in front of him now, Ye Xuan would be able to kill him with a casual palm strike.

Ye Xuan examined the surging spiritual power in his body.

Although he had only advanced a minor realm, the difference in strength was massive.

Every time a unity realm cultivator advanced a minor realm, their strength would undergo a huge qualitative change.

It was said that once a cultivator reached the tenth level of the unity realm, their physical bodies would become immortal.

However, there were also some drawbacks to advancing too quickly.

For example, the current Ye Xuan, because he had previously refined the Mi Luo flower, his spiritual sense had been enhanced and tempered, which gave him full control of his spiritual sense and the spiritual power in his dantian.

Now that he had reached the second level of the unity realm, his control over his spiritual power had dropped to around 93% to 95% .

If he wanted to regain his perfect control, he would have to spend some time in secluded cultivation.

However, he was now in a mystic realm, and the most crucial thing to do here was to find heavenly treasures!

“Yan’er, use all of your strength to attack me so that I can see how much you’ve improved!”

Ye Xuan instructed her.

Previously, Zhao Yuyan’s parents would call her Yan’er, so Ye Xuan decided to address her as such.

Ye Xuan was quite curious about how terrifying the Demon Devourer Body was. In addition, he would also be able to evaluate Zhao Yuyan’s control over her own strength.

“Ah?”

Hearing this, Zhao Yuyan had a blank expression on her face. Attack her teacher?

She knew very well that, given her own strength, there was no way she could hurt her teacher. Still, how could she attack her teacher?

“Don’t worry. No matter how strong you might be, you won’t be able to hurt me. I just want to evaluate your control over your own power.”

Seeing the change in Zhao Yuyan’s expression, Ye Xuan explained his reasons with a smile.

“I see! Then, Teacher, you better get ready. Yan’er is going to attack!”

Then, Zhao Yuyan mobilized the power in her body.

Once Ye Xuan nodded, the power in Zhao Yuyan’s body suddenly burst forth, condensing into fist strikes that hit Ye Xuan’s palm.

Bang! Bang!

This feeling was like an adult having fun with a child. No matter how many times or how hard Zhao Yuyan hit his palm, it did not cause any harm.

Most importantly, Zhao Yuyan’s attacks were completely disorganized andhad no technique behind them.

This little girl had obviously not learned any cultivation methods and martial techniques.

“Yan’er, hit me with all of your strength!” Ye Xuan shouted.

This little girl had always been scolded and isolated, resulting in her withdrawn personality. Hence, even though she knew that she could not hurt him, she did not dare to use her full strength.

After Zhao Yuyan heard Ye Xuan’s words and realized that she could not hurt him at all, she mobilized the spiritual power in her body and prepared to go all out.

“Your level of control is only 30%. It’s too low!”

Ye Xuan shook his head. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Yes, that’s better. It’s already reached 35%!”

“Keep going. It’s already 40%!”

“Very good, very good. It’s already reached 50%. Continue!”

Beside the lake, other than Zhao Yuyan’s shouts, there was only Ye Xuan’s comments.

Huang Ling, who was beside them, was dumbfounded.

Elder Ye Xuan’s new disciple’s growth speed was too abnormal. Was this not just a replica of Elder Ye Xuan himself?

Not only was her breakthrough speed lightning fast, but she was also rapidly getting better at controlling her own strength.

As expected! Birds of a feather flock together! Monsters!

Huang Ling even felt that if she continued to stay by Elder Ye Xuan’s side, her understanding of the world would cease to be normal.

“Not bad, your control over your power has reached 70%, but your improvement speed is also gradually slowing down!”

“72%!”

“74%!”

“Very good, now your control over your own strength has reached 75%. Let’s call it a day! Even if your talent is pretty good, I’m afraid it will take some time before you can fully control your strength!”

“But remember, once you leave the mystic realm, you can’t slack off in your cultivation. I hope that when I come to pick you up, I will be pleasantly surprised.”

Ye Xuan’s gaze fell on Zhao Yuyan.

The more he looked at this cute disciple of his, the more satisfied he became. Not only did she give him a high system reward multiplier, but her monstrous innate bone value and comprehension value made her a fast and adept learner.

Also, through Zhao Yuyan’s attacks just now, Ye Xuan had already gained some insights into the Demon Devourer Body.

Even without relying on the augmentation of martial techniques, an ordinary tenth-level qi transformation realm cultivator was no match for Zhao Yuyan.

Moreover, in terms of the strength of the spiritual power in her dantian, even a third-level true essence realm cultivator could not compare.
