534 The White-Browed Old Man (Part 1)

If he really succeeded in capturing her, the Great Wilderness Divine sect would be furious.

“Hahaha, I’m so excited just thinking about it!”

The white-browed old man said with an evil smile as he looked in Yanran’s direction.

He loved this sort of thing the most, as it gave him a challenge, and overcoming challenges gave him pleasure and joy.

!!

He was not as strong as Daoist Sun, but that was that and this was this. Dealing with this little girl would not be troublesome at all.

Seeing this, the white-robed old man who had tried to persuade him earlier also sighed. After all, almost all the cultivators here knew that the white-browed old man was a sleazy person.

After all, he cultivated the evil path, which specialized in gathering Yin to supplement Yang, and capturing women to supplement his cultivation.

The more outstanding a woman was, the faster his cultivation would grow.

He was the sect master of the Yin Yang Divine sect, and he had defiled almost all of the sect’s female disciples.

Even those little girls who were not yet of age, as long as they were beautiful, none of them could escape. Over the years, the Yin Yang Divine sect had done all sorts of bad things, and even stretched out their hands to harm the female disciples of the other sects.

Therefore, It was normal for the white-browed old man to have his eyes on Yanran. Incidentally, this white-browed old man was an advanced-stage supreme realm expert.

On Yanran’s side, when she arrived in this space, she immediately noticed the white-browed old man’s gaze, which disgusted her.

Who would feel comfortable being stared at by an evil old man?

Yanran had heard about this white-browed old man, so she was very cautious about this. That being said, ever since she started cultivating, she had almost never been defeated, so she was not one to retreat without a fight.

At this moment, space distorted again, and Ye Xuan appeared behind Yanran.

“Oh? Who is that man?”

After Ye Xuan arrived, all of the cultivators cast curious gazes at him.

The door of the ancient tomb had opened, and almost all of the cultivators. Although they knew most of them, there were still some that they had never seen before.

In this case, Ye Xuan was an expert they had never seen before.

Ye Xuan immediately noticed the malicious gazes around him and frowned.

‘Why are there so many cultivators in this place?’

After scanning his surroundings, he got down to thinking. If his guess was right, these were all supreme realm cultivators from the other continent.

Because it was his first time here, Ye Xuan seemed to be very low-key, silently standing behind Yanran

However, he then sensed an extremely disgusting gaze. When he turned to look for its source, he spotted the white-browed old man, who was staring lustfully at Yanran.

Seeing this Ye Xuan said to Yanran, “I must say, Junior Sister, you’re really charming. Even this old man is attracted to you. He hasn’t taken his gaze off you even once.”

Hearing this, a strong sense of disgust arose in Yanran’s heart again. She snorted coldly, “It’s really nauseating!”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan’s curiosity was piqued and he asked, “Junior Sister, do you know who this person is?”

“He’s the master of the Yin Yang Divine sect. We usually call him the white-browed old man.”

“His cultivation technique is very evil. It absorbs Yin to supplement Yang, and is spurned by the public,” Yanran replied angrily.

After hearing this, Ye Xuan became even more curious and wanted to know what kind of cultivation technique this white-browed old man was cultivating.

“Junior Sister, do you know the details? How does he absorb Yin to supplement Yang.”

Looking at Ye Xuan’s curious face, Yanran hesitated for a while, not knowing how to respond.

After a long while, she finally replied, “Absorbing Yin to supplement Yang, how else do you think would happen?”

“He’s cultivating a cultivation technique that requires him to use women during cultivation. He’ll use dual cultivation to improve his strength.”

“The more talented a woman is, the more effective she will be for his cultivation technique.”

After saying this, Yanran turned around and looked at Ye Xuan. Her face was red as she continued, “Over the years, the white-browed old man has defiled almost all of the women in his sect. All of the good-looking ones have disappeared.”

After saying this, she could not help but grit her teeth and look in the direction of the white-browed old man, wishing she could kill him.

This person was simply a demon and should not be allowed to exist in this world.

After hearing this, Ye Xuan also understood and said with a smile, “I see. I didn’t expect Junior Sister to know so much about this…”

Yanran immediately glared at Ye Xuan fiercely, clenching her little fists.

“Ye Xuan! Do you find this funny?

“Ahem, I was just joking, just joking. Don’t take it seriously, okay?”

Seeing Yanran’s angry look, Ye Xuan quickly explained.

“Scoundrel, if you dare to speak such nonsense again, I’m going to ignore you.”

After saying this, Yanran pouted and turned around.

On the other hand, when the white-browed old man saw Ye Xuan and Yanran flirting with each other, he made a decision to kill Ye Xuan.

In his eyes, Yanran was already his woman.

This was already intolerable!

The white-browed old man suddenly laughed evilly and thought viciously, ‘I’m afraid another peerless genius is going to die in my hands, haha!’

In recent times, the white-browed old man had already secretly killed many peerless geniuses in order to prevent them from becoming a threat to him in the future.

After noticing the white-browed old man’s malicious gaze, the people present already knew what he wanted to do. However, they did not interfere and chose to simply watch the show.

“I’m afraid that this handsome young man will die here.”

“He probably doesn’t know that the white-browed old man is hellbent on killing him yet. He’s still smiling and hitting on that girl.”

“Let’s see if he ends up surviving.”

...

Everyone was conversing nonchalantly, as they were already used to such behavior from the white-browed old man.

As long as it was not related to them, they would not interfere. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

The white-browed old man slowly flew over to Ye Xuan and Yanran and said with an evil smile, “Hehe, seeing that the two of you have already reached the supreme realm at such a young age, you are indeed geniuses.”

“This is the first time in my life that I’ve seen geniuses as outstanding as you two. I’m sure you’ll achieve extraordinary things in the future.”

The white-browed old man tried his best to make himself look approachable.

However, anyone who had eyes could tell that the white-browed old man was up to no good.

When Yanran saw him approach, she had already started to mobilize the spiritual power in her body secretly. Just as she was about to speak, she was stopped by Ye Xuan.

Although Yanran was very unhappy, she secretly endured it when she recalled Ye Xuan’s strength and left the matter to him to handle.

Ye Xuan stood in front of Yanran, and spoke with a smile.

“Fellow Daoist must be joking. The two of us cannot be compared to you.”

After hearing this, the white-browed old man felt somewhat happy.

...

It seemed that this stinky young man was quite good at flattering others.

Perhaps he would not kill this young man after all. He was in need of a servant in any case.

“Hehe, that’s true,” the white-browed old man replied very proudly.

However, what he did not expect was that Ye Xuan’s next words almost drove him crazy.
