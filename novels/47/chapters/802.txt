803 Round Two (Part 1)

“Are you very shocked?”

Why was he still alive?

Well, before the two of them started fighting, Ye Xuan had kept an immortal-grade blood recovery pill in his mouth.

The moment before he died, Ye Xuan instantly consumed the pill, which had the effect of reviving the dead if taken within a certain span of time.

In comparison, Mengyu had used her immortal bones to resurrect herself.

Not long ago, Ye Xuan had discussed the wonders of the immortal bones with Daoist Yi Feng, and the latter had also revealed a crucial piece of information.

After Mengyu came back to life, she would be very weak for a certain duration.

He had risked his life to do all this just to weaken Mengyu.

If Mengyu became weaker, he would have more confidence to deal with her, and might not even need Daoist Yi Feng to self-destruct his immortal bones again.

This was indeed the best way, but it was fraught with risks. Furthermore, there was no guarantee that he could beat her even after she was weakened. Therefore, it was a huge gamble.

Fortunately, Ye Xuan succeeded.

When she saw Ye Xuan’s smiling face, Mengyu’s expression instantly turned cold. She turned around and looked at Daoist Yi Feng in the sky.

“Did you plan this?”

She could not believe it. She could not bear to do anything to Daoist Yi Feng, but he actually cooperated with others to plot against her.

Hearing her question, Daoist Yi Feng replied indifferently, “Yes.”

After hearing this answer, Mengyu’s mind nearly exploded. She asked in disbelief, “Could it be that you only have hatred for me in your heart? In order to completely kill me, you even told others about the flaws of the immortal bones.”

Since ancient times, the number of people who possessed immortal bones could be counted on one hand. No one knew where their flaws were.

Only those with immortal bones would understand their flaws, but who would be so stupid as to tell others about it? However, Daoist Yi Feng had done exactly this!

Seeing her like this, Daoist Yi Feng felt his heartstrings being tugged. However, when he remembered that tens of thousands of people from the Great Wilderness Divine sect had been killed by her and that he had been deceived by her, his gaze gradually became firm.

“Mengyu, there is only enmity between us.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Mengyu felt powerless and almost fell to the ground.

She simply could not believe that these words had actually come from Daoist Yi Feng’s mouth.

It was as if Daoist Yi Feng had drawn a knife and stabbed it into her heart, causing her to feel immense pain. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Every time Daoist Yi Feng thought of Tian Xuan, he would feel extremely sorrowful.

After all, to him, Tian Xuan was his father, teacher, and friend. Since he was young, Tian Xuan had raised him and taught him cultivation techniques.

However, after that battle, not only did she kill the sect master, but even severely injured Tian Xuan, which eventually led to the latter’s demise.

If he could easily let go of such a grudge would he be able to face the sect members that died in the afterlife?

Mengyu was crying as she fixed her eyes on Yi Feng. She wanted to say something, but she could not.

It had already happened, and she could not explain herself.

Although she had indeed killed many members of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, the reason why she used Yi Feng’s bloodline to ascend to the sealed immortal realm was to pay for her mistakes.

Even so, Yi Feng did not care about this at all. What he truly cared about were still his sect members.

“Haha…”

Mengyu laughed pitifully, and her expression gradually became abnormally ferocious.

At that moment, Ye Xuan frowned slightly because he could already sense that Mengyu’s aura had been rising continuously. Extremely powerful energy fluctuations swept in all directions.

While she was laughing crazily, she waved her right hand slightly and summoned her demonic sword. She pointed it at them from afar and said, “Bring it on! When have I ever been afraid?”

“At that time, tens of thousands of people from your sect couldn’t kill me, and today will be the same!”

Mengyu’s aura became even more powerful after she spoke, causing Yi Feng’s expression to change drastically.

He activated his Reincarnation Dao without hesitation. After exchanging glances with Ye Xuan, he directly attacked.

“Great Demoness, today, you must pay for what you did in the past!”

Ye Xuan was already burning with anger. He attacked with his two divine swords at the same time.

Daoist Yi Feng was using his Reincarnation Dao to support Ye Xuan from a short distance away, constantly interfering with Mengyu’s attacks.

The only good thing was that Mengyu had just been resurrected, so her condition was not at its peak.

In the first clash, the three of them were evenly matched.

More and more people rushed to watch from the other continent. Without exception, they all had shocked expressions.

“Oh my god, isn’t this battle too terrifying?”

“Two ancient realm experts challenging a sealed immortal realm expert. Such a battle is extremely rare. I’m lucky enough to witness it today!”

Ye Xuan held two swords in his hands, each of his moves were extremely sharp and decisive as he exchanged hundreds of blows with Mengyu. Everyone was spellbound by his Sword Dao.

As the battle went on, the world barrier constantly shook.

“Let’s retreat quickly. The barrier will probably shatter very soon.”

After being reminded, everyone realized that spiderweb-like cracks had already appeared on the barrier.

If things continued to progress like this, the day the continents would be unified would be hastened.

Boom!

With a loud bang, Ye Xuan slashed his swords toward Mengyu vigorously.
