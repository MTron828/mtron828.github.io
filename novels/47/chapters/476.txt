477 Bei Xuantian

As long as he performed well enough, perhaps Chief Ye Xuan would find him pleasing to the eye one day.

Charlot did not wish to obtain any great benefits either. It would be fine as long as he could resolve the previous grudges between them.

Thinking this, Charlot immediately made a decision.

“Got it. From now on, I’m going to be a filial son!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Charlot turned around and headed in the direction of the Xia family’s residence.

The people around them were dumbfounded.

Did the sun rise from the west today? Was the young master of the Xia family really going to become a filial son?

‘Hahaha! Oh my God, this is really unbelievable. Young Master is actually going to be a filial son?’

Xia Hai, who was beside him, was also surprised. However, he was also thrilled by this development. No matter what the outcome would be in the future, this was a very good start.

One had to admit that Ye Xuan had a great influence in Qingyang City.

All three of Qingyang city’s hedonistic young masters were afraid of Ye Xuan.

One was Su Changhe, the other was Charlot and the last one was Lin Dong.

Xia Hai looked in the direction of the archaic divine mountains with a gratified smile on his face.

‘I hope that young master will really change for the better in the future. Otherwise, I don’t know how the Xia family will survive in the future.’

After that, Xia Hai followed Charlot and left.

In the mystic world, bloodline was extremely important, so under normal circumstances, only direct descendants were allowed to inherit the family.

In other words, as the eldest young master of the Xia family, Charlot was the only direct heir.

If Charlot failed to live up to expectations in the future, the Xia family would likely decline or even be wiped out.

As a member of the Xia family, Xia Hai naturally could not bear to see his family suffer that fate, which was why he had tried his best to nudge Charlot toward the right direction just now. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Although the effects were promising, he was not sure how long Charlot could last.

Outside Qingyang City, the land was still engulfed in flames.

At this moment, two figures suddenly descended from the sky. They looked at the corpses that were scattered all over and the flames that burnt them.

“Uh… Why does it suddenly smell like roasted meat?”

Su Changhe looked at the charred body below and suddenly had a brainless idea.

Hearing this, Ye Xuan’s mouth twitched, and he slapped him.

This kid was asking for a beating.

After realizing that he had said the wrong thing, Su Changhe quickly covered his mouth, afraid that he would ruin his image in Ye Xuan’s mind. Then, he followed behind Ye Xuan and did not dare to speak anymore.

Ye Xuan carefully searched the area for a while, and then found a strange bone among the corpses of several beasts.

“Chief Ye Xuan, what are you holding?”

From Su Changhe’s perspective, there was nothing special about this bone. It was not even a precious bone.

“The bone of a beast,” Ye Xuan said in all seriousness.

Su Changhe’s mouth twitched when he heard that.

Who could not tell that this was the bone of a beast? From the patterns on the bone, it was obvious that it belonged to a unicorn.

Ye Xuan carefully observed the unicorn bone in his hand, and then his eyes fell on something not far away.

At this very moment, the ground began to tremble slightly. The surrounding spiritual energy suddenly became violent.

“Mm, there’s quite a commotion up ahead. Let’s go over and take a look!”

Ye Xuan put away the unicorn bone and turned into a streak of light.

Soon, the two arrived at a mountain peak.

From their vantage point, they could clearly see a group of cultivators surrounding a black-spotted lion beast.

Ye Xuan used his spiritual sense to probe in. The black-spotted lion beast was as powerful as a void realm cultivator. Even if these young cultivators worked together, it would still be difficult to deal with it.

However, Ye Xuan also discovered that there were several elders among the cultivators who had not made a move yet. These elders were at least heaven realm cultivators.

From the looks of it, these cultivators were from a major family, which is why they had strong guardians with them.

“Chief Ye Xuan, look, these cultivators aren’t dressed like members of our Yangli divine empire. They look more like cultivators from the Haihan divine empire in the north.”

Su Changhe’s knowledge and keen eye came in handy in times like these.

“The Haihan divine empire?”

Ye Xuan narrowed his eyes.

The Haihan divine empire was located to the north of the East continent. How had they ended up here?

At this moment, at the foot of the mountain, an mystic lord realm elder suddenly squinted his eyes. With his spiritual sense, he could sense an extremely obscure aura in the surroundings.

The old man said to the young man in front of him.

“Nephew, we should welcome our guest!”

“What?”

Hearing this, Bei Xuantian’s eyes flickered and he immediately noticed Ye Xuan and Su Changhe at the peak of the mountain.

As the second prince of the Haihan divine empire, he had grown up in the Imperial Palace and enjoyed a very respected status.

However, it was also because he was the second prince that he did not have the right to inherit the throne. As a result, his personality became extremely unsociable, and he hated it the most when others looked down at him.

...

Bei Xuantian’s eyes immediately turned cold.

“Who dares to spy on me from the mountain peak? Get down here quickly and apologize!”

“Hehe…”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan chuckled. Then, he signaled Su Changhe with his eyes.

The best way to deal with a hedonistic son was to use the former hedonistic son to deal with him.

Su Changhe naturally understood Ye Xuan’s intentions, so he smirked.

This was a chance given to him by Ye Xuan to show off, so he had to do his best.

‘Just watch me!’

Su Changhe looked at Bei Xuantian with an evil smile on his face.
