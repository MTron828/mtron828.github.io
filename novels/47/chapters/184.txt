“Oh? Do you still have a trump card?”

Hearing this, the red-armored man frowned.

He had also kept his strongest trump card hidden, and he was absolutely confident that as long as he revealed this trump card, he would definitely be able to defeat Ye Xuan.

Ye Xuan hovered in mid-air, and the spiritual power in his body gushed out. Then, he slowly raised the divine sword in his hand and pointed it in front of him.

A cracking sound was heard.

A bolt of lightning suddenly flashed through the sky and poured into the divine sword.

“How… How is this possible? You actually comprehended the embryonic form of the Heavenly Lightning intent?”

The red-armored man’s originally calm expression suddenly changed.

“The legendary supreme intent. You actually succeeded in comprehending it…”

The red-armored man could no longer remain calm. His eyes were filled with disbelief.

Even with his extremely monstrous talent, he only came into contact with the legendary supreme intent after he had surpassed the unity realm.

Yet this fellow in fron of him had actually comprehended the embryonic form of the Heavenly Lightning intent at the age of 20?

The red-armored man’s expression turned solemn.

The giant sword in his hand emitted a light that could destroy the heavens and the earth. His pupils also emitted a terrifying red light. A vast red moon suddenly appeared in the sky behind him.

“Yao Yue Sheng Yan!”

The red-armored man slowly spat out a few words.

Moments later, the red moon behind him suddenly turned into a torrent that poured into the giant sword, causing it to become burning hot and emit a strange red light.

The red-armored man slowly raised the giant sword in his hand. The surrounding space seemed to be unable to withstand this terrifying power, and spatial cracks started appearing.

At the same time, the power of the natural laws gushed out, instantly repairing the spatial cracks.

However, under the influence of this strange red sword qi, new spatial cracks constantly appeared.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan’s expression did not change in the slightest.

Third-level sword intent!

Heavenly Lightning intent!

Moments later, surging power suddenly poured into the divine sword. At the tip of the sword, resplendent blood-red light blossomed.

Where the blood-red light pointed, a spatial crack appeared in the sky.

Whoosh! Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Ye Xuan held the longsword and turned into a streak of light. The tip of the sword was wrapped in a blinding sheathe of light. It distorted the space around it as it slashed toward the red-armored man.

At the same time, the red-armored man’s pupils burst out with a demonic red light. He slowly raised the giant sword in his hand. As a world-destroying sword qi fell, the space around it cracked inch by inch.

Monstrous fighting spirit filled Ye Xuan’s eyes. The tyrannical blood-colored sword qi was suffused with strands of the destructive power of the heavenly lightning intent. Then, it transformed into a resplendent starry sword qi that was like a beam of light that shot toward the red-armored man.

A line of stars streaked across!

Boom!

The two forces collided, and shockwaves of destructive energy rippled out.

In the next second, the strange red giant sword seemed to have been struck by lightning, and the Red Moon sword qi broke apart inch by inch.

The red-armored man grunted. The giant sword he was holding suddenly shattered, and his entire body was flung hundreds of miles away like a cannonball.

However, the terrifying tyrannical sword qi was persistent. After tearing through space, it slashed at the red-armored man again.

Whoosh!

The tyrannical sword qi released the terrifying power of heavenly lightning intent and devoured the red-armored man.

The power of heavenly lightning wreaked havoc.

The red-armored man looked at Ye Xuan in disbelief before it dissipated.

This scene was transmitted to the screen of light of the War God Hall through the spatial crack!

Seeing this, everyone trembled, and their eyes were filled with fear.

“What terrifying power…”

They looked at each other and fell silent.

In the face of such power, they were as insignificant as ants.

When Gongsun Batian saw this, he was completely stunned.

Even if it was him, when faced with this sword attack, he would die without a doubt.

When he thought of this, he could not help but tremble.

This young man actually had the strength to kill him instantly? He was only 20 years old!

At this moment, Gongsun Batian experienced Gongsun Yao’s helplessness.

When he was young, Gongsun Batian was also a peerless genius of the Nanzhou Region. Although he could not be considered the strongest genius, his cultivation talent was outstanding.

He had for less than 200 years and had reached the fourth level of the unity realm.

The geniuses of the same generation as him either died prematurely or were stuck at the threshold of the unity realm. Only a small number of geniuses were able to reach the unity realm without any obstacles.

However, that all seemed insignificant in the face of Ye Xuan’s feats.

Compared to the other party, what kind of genius was he?

He was f*cking mediocre!

“Look! There’s a change in the rankings!”

“Oh my God!”

At this moment, everyone’s exclamations interrupted Gongsun Batian’s thoughts.

Immediately, he raised his head to look at the two ranking lists in the sky. The spatial crack at the top floor of the Tower of Heaven had already been repaired by the natural laws.

The entire Tower of Heaven was shining with bright divine light.

“First place: Ye Xuan, Actual Age: 20, 99 levels, Nanzhou Region, Qingyun sect!”

This message appeared at the same time on the Combat Power List and on the qualifications rankings. Every word was dazzling golden, like a bright sun.

First in both rankings!

Although everyone had already somewhat guessed it, seeing it made it feel more tangible.

Ye Xuan was the first in both rankings!

Absolute domination!

The strongest person in the past, Ye Tian, had only reached the 88th level.

In comparison, Ye Xuan had cleared the Tower of Heaven!
