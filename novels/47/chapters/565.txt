566 Reborn

“This precious medicinal pill seems really amazing!”

The onlookers were thoroughly shocked to see that Gao Shun’s entire body was already regaining an aura of life.

After some time, Gao Shun’s soul stabilized itself within his body. Thanks to the continuous infusion of this lifeforce, his body gradually recovered. Even his fingertips trembled slightly, which immediately caused an uproar.

Oh my god, he’s really alive!”

!!

“Did you see that? His finger moved just now!”

The gaping wounds in his body were recovering at a speed that was visible to the naked eye. However, because he had used the forbidden secret technique earlier, his skin remained dry and unsightly after his body was repaired.

“Martial Uncle Ye, what’s going on?”

Gao Tianyu asked anxiously.

Ye Xuan shook his head and said, “It’s not a big deal. Because he overused the forbidden secret technique, the blood essence in his body has almost dried up.”

“Just wait a while. The pill will be able to help him to recover from this as well.”

“Not only that, but after he recovers, your father will most likely break through as well.”

Hearing this, Gao Tianyu was dumbfounded, and so was everyone else.

Someone who had died and revived could still break through?

Moments later, Gao Shun’s body was enveloped by a ray of light.

“Uh… What’s going on this time?”

“I can’t believe a single pill can be this miraculous.”

After some time, the ray of light gradually dissipated, revealing the figure of a strong middle-aged man.

Thanks to Ye Xuan’s medicinal pill, Gao Shun actually became several decades younger.

“What?!”

This scene left everyone speechless. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Huh?”

Gao Shun, who had just come back to life, was similarly very shocked at this time. He had been expecting to wake up at the gates of hell. Instead, he discovered that his body had become younger by several decades, and his strength had even increased a little.

What was going on?

After sensing the dense lifeforce circulating through his body, Gao Shun became even more excited. He felt that his body was full of strength now.

The side effects of using the forbidden secret technique multiple times had also been cured.

The most important thing was that Gao Shun clearly sensed that he had the opportunity to break through to the supreme realm.

If he was given some time to cultivate and forge his divine body, he would be able to reach the supreme realm easily. This was the goal that he had been pursuing all this while.

After seeing Gao Shun’s excited expression, Ye Xuan also smiled and said, “Congratulations on your rebirth, Senior Brother Gao!”

Hearing this, Gao Shun was momentarily stunned. After a long while, he finally reacted and looked at Ye Xuan, his eyes filled with confusion.

He did not know what had happened after he was killed, so he quickly pulled his son to fill him in.

After he found out that Ye Xuan had given him an extremely precious pill that had saved his life, he was extremely touched and the words he wanted to say were stuck in his mouth.

“This kid was actually willing to part with such a precious pill to resurrect me?”

He recalled all the things that had happened in the past. He had always been secretly targeting Ye Xuan and had often tried to humiliate him.

Even though their relationship had improved after the Seven Peaks competition, it should not have been to the extent that Ye Xuan would be willing to go this far.

At this moment, Gao Shun’s heart was trembling violently. He was naturally very clear about how powerful and valuable this pill was.

Thinking of this, he was also very helpless. He had thought that they were even, but now he actually owed Ye Xuan another favor. This was too difficult…

“Junior Brother Ye, I have to thank you for what you did just now.”

“I’m afraid that I can’t repay you for saving my life. How can I repay you?”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan laughed and said indifferently, “We’re all from the same sect, so don’t be too calculative about such things. It doesn’t matter if you return the favor or not.”

“Besides, you saved my two disciples. I’m the one returning the favor this time.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan turned around and waved to his disciples, “Let’s head back”

Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun nodded obediently and followed Ye Xuan.

The matter here had already been resolved, so there was no need to stay here. Everyone was shocked by Ye Xuan’s magnanimity and generosity.

Hua Eufeng sighed with emotion and said, “Martial Uncle Ye Xuan is really unfathomable.”

“He’s always so generous to his disciples and fellow disciples.”

“Although he is always indifferent about such things, he never holds back when something big happens.”

After hearing Hua Rufeng’s words, the others also agreed.

From this moment on, Ye Xuan’s status was elevated once again, and there were many people who were envious of Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun’s identities as his disciples.
