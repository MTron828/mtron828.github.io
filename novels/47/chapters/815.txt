816 Little Monkey

After the little furry monkey was smashed into the distance, it immediately got up. However, when it saw the giant ape coming toward it again, it decided that escaping was the best course of action.

Almost instantly, it disappeared without a trace.

“F*ck! How did it move so quickly?”

The giant ape was shocked. This little monkey moved faster than it could!

What exactly was this monkey?

Not long after, the little monkey had returned to the cave entrance where the rest of the monkeys were hiding. It looked afraid.

After experiencing this setback, the little furry monkey’s confidence had taken a hit. Seeing this, Ye Xuan decided that this was the best time to act.

The big-faced monkey opened his mouth and said, “Monkey King, there’s no need to take this to heart. That monster has been cultivating for some time under the guidance of an immortal, which is why it is so powerful.”

“In our area, that big ape is basically an existence that no one can defeat. It’s not a shameful thing for you to be defeated by him.”

“Immortal?”

After hearing this word, the little monkey’s heart trembled slightly. He wished he could become stronger so that he could have the strength to protect itself and those around it.

“Where do we find immortals? I want to go over and learn some skills from them,” the little monkey asked anxiously.

After hearing this, Ye Xuan stood up calmly and said with a serious expression.

“King, I know of a place called the Seven Star-Cave Abode.”

“There is an immortal cultivating in this cave abode, and his name is Daoist Ling. You go to this place to become his disciple.”

The little furry monkey became extremely excited.

“Seven-Star Cave Abode, Daoist Ling?”

It muttered to itself, believing that Daoist Ling was very noble and powerful.

The little monkey immediately agreed and said, “Alright, then I’ll go to the Seven-Star Cave Abode!”

“All of you stay here and wait for me. When I come back, I will definitely not let any monsters suppress us!”

“Haha, how interesting. I hope this monkey will not disappoint me…”

He left and went straight to the East Sea.

After finding a suitable place, Ye Xuan casually released a few streams of spiritual energy to build an isolated island, and then the Seven-Star Cave Abode.

After everything was done, he waited patiently.

The arrival of the little furry monkey was imminent.

As an added note, Ye Xuan also set up many obstacles along the way to the Seven-Star Cave Abode to test whether this little monkey’s will was firm or not.

Since he knew that the little monkey would not arrive so soon, Ye Xuan took some time to return to the Great Wilderness Divine sect. The assessment for new disciples had already begun.

At this time, the various sect masters had already chosen their favorite candidates, but Ye Xuan was different in this aspect. After all, there was still a little monkey waiting for him in the East Sea, so he was not bothered about the disciple recruitment or assessments.

“I don’t know if you guys know about this, but yesterday, there was an explosion that shook the entire Sky Mountain.”

“I don’t know what happened, but a seven-colored light suddenly flew towards the East Sea.”

In the main hall, many people discussed the incident yesterday.

After hearing this matter, Gao Shun added, “That’s right. Many people witnessed the scene. It seems that the seven-colored light was released by a monkey.”

“People say that this is a sign of good luck. After all, this monkey was born from a worldly phenomenon. It seems that our East continent will begin to develop quickly after this.”

“I don’t know if this is true, though.”

Everyone was curious about this matter.

Yuelun was about to say something, but she suddenly noticed that Ye Xuan was also maintaining his silence and even had a strange expression.

Thus, she asked curiously, “Junior Brother Ye, how much do you know about this monkey?”

Ye Xuan was at a loss as blood and sweat appeared on his forehead.

“What are you guys talking about? Monkey? What monkey?” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Hearing Ye Xuan’s answer, Yuelun was stunned and confused.

Ye Xuan did not say a word after that as he watched them discuss animatedly. He did not plan to let anyone know that he wanted to take the little furry monkey as his disciple… No, wait, as Daoist Ling’s disciple…

Then, he would teach the little monkey some cultivation techniques. As for what would happen after that, Ye Xuan would not interfere too much. He did not want to be implicated by this little monkey’s antics.

After watching them discuss for such a long time, Ye Xuan pondered for a moment before making a decision. Since he was here today, it would be good to make an announcement.

Ye Xuan stood up, attracting everyone’s attention. As the only sealed immortal realm expert in the East continent, his actions were under constant scrutiny.

“Senior Brother Ao…”

Hearing Ye Xuan calling him, Ao Lei looked at Ye Xuan with a puzzled expression and asked, “Junior Brother Ye, what’s the matter?”

“Senior Brother Ao, I have something to announce today.”

After hearing this, everyone instantly sat up straight.

In the main hall, not only were the chiefs present, but also many elders, disciples, and some people who had qualified for the final assessment.

Everyone pricked up their ears and listened.

Seeing that all eyes were focused on him, Ye Xuan turned around and said, “Yueyue, come here.”
