322 The Realm Above The Saint King Realm

For example, as the reincarnation of an ancient great empress, Shangguan Wan’er’s talent went without saying.

However, even now, Shangguan Wan’er had no clue about reincarnation intent.

Even with Ye Xuan’s gifts and the aid of epiphanies, she had no way of comprehending reincarnation intent. As such, there was almost no way for a reincarnated expert to fully awaken the memories of his or her past life during the pattern condensation realm.

It was simply unheard of. Therefore, Jun Xuantian came to the conclusion that Ye Xuan had been concealing his strength all along.

“I didn’t think that the peerless genius I tried to rope in would turn out to be a Heavenly King realm expert.”

Jun Xuantian could not help but sigh.

On the other hand, the sea race Heavenly King realm expert who was confronting Jun Xuantian had an ugly expression on his face.

This expert was a flood dragon, and the horn on his head emitted resplendent golden light. His name was Chang Yi.

When they first met, Chang Yi and Jun Xuantian fought for a while. After a brief bout, neither side was able to secure an advantage, so they stopped and the situation entered a stand-off.

Jun Xuantian’s goal was also to keep an eye on this expert and prevent him from joining the battle!

“Who is this Ye Xuan that I’m hearing about?”

Obviously, Chang Yi had also received the news from the other members of the sea race and now knew about Ye Xuan’s terrifying strength.

“I don’t know him,” Jun Xuantian replied with a cold gaze. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

What he said was indeed true. His understanding of Ye Xuan was merely based on what Jun Lingtian had told him, which he now knew to be completely untrue, at least in terms of strength.

Still, Jun Xuantian was curious.

Why would a powerful Heavenly King realm cultivator deign to be an elder of a small sect?

What kind of secret was this guy hiding?

“Humans, you’ve already broken the rules by allowing a Heavenly King realm expert to interfere in the battle,” Chang Yi said icily.

Although there was no established rule between the two sides, the Heavenly King realm experts and above had a tacit understanding to avoid interfering in the battle. The other tacit understanding was that those with higher cultivation levels would not attack those who were weaker.

If one side violated this tacitly agreed rule, the other side would definitely not let it slide. If that disagreement spiraled out of control, a full-fledged war would erupt.

Then, whether it was the human race’s territory or the sea race’s territory, both would definitely suffer heavy losses.

“There’s no point in you talking to me about this,” Jun Xuantian said indifferently.

It was the sea race who initiated the war and invaded the human race’s territory, yet they were trying to claim the moral high ground. It was really ridiculous.

Were it not for the fact that they were worried about the irreparable damage to their own territory, the peak experts of the human race would have attacked long ago.

Although Ye Xuan’s actions might cause the sea race to go all out in the war, Jun Xuantian still felt very happy and gratified that so many sea race experts had been killed.

“Since you humans don’t care about the rules, then you should prepare yourselves for our revenge!”

“Hehe! We’re already at war, so why bother with rules?”

A cold smile appeared on Jun Xuantian’s face.

“The human race has a great emperor as well, so what was there to fear from you lot?”

Jun Xuantian was not bothered by Chang Yi’s threat at all.

Even if Ye Xuan killed all of the invading sea race King realm experts, it was unlikely that the two great emperor realm experts would start fighting.

“Hehe! No matter what, we will definitely kill Ye Xuan. He won’t live for long!”

Chang Yi’s eyes were filled with killing intent.

Hearing this, Jun Xuantian fell silent.

It seemed that instead of escalating the battle, they were planning to go after Ye Xuan instead. Of course, this was the crisis that Ye Xuan had sensed through the power of karma.

As such, he moved the Qingyun sect into the Imprisonment Divine Tower, and brought his disciples with him to the stormy sea area. Where there was crisis, there was also opportunity!

Very quickly, the sea race dispatched Heavenly King realm experts to kill Ye Xuan. However, what frustrated them was that they could not find traces of him at all.

With Ye Xuan’s current strength, he could not defeat a Heavenly King realm expert. However, he did have a great emperor realm jade token now, which he had obtained from yet another cycle of giving his disciples jade tokens.

Although that would allow him to kill a Heavenly King realm expert or two, he still felt it was a waste of that jade token, so he kept a low profile instead.

Another reason behind this was that Ye Xuan was afraid that if the sea race’s great emperor realm expert sensed the power of that jade token, he would personally make a move.

Across the entire Tianyuan continent, the great emperor realm was the pinnacle of cultivation.

Legend had it that if a cultivator surpassed the great emperor realm, they would be able to ascend to a higher world.
