431 Another Epiphany?

“As expected of Junior Brother Ye, a few short sentences was enough to pave the way to a breakthrough. This has truly been eye-opening!”

Liang Dahai laughed and started to flatter him.

After the incident just now, his attitude towards Ye Xuan had completely changed, from disdain to admiration.

After all, there was no deep or eternal hatred between the seven peaks, and they were all part of the same sect. The competition between them only served to make the sect stronger.

Hearing this, Ye Xuan smiled.

“Senior Brother, you’re too kind with your words. It’s just a small matter!”

“Hahaha! If this is a small matter, I wonder when Junior Brother Ye will have the time to give me some pointers,” Yuelun said with a smile.

“Oh?” Hearing this, Ye Xuan raised his brows. He whispered in her ear, “If Senior Sister is willing, let’s find a quiet place to have this discussion.”

When Yuelun heard this, she blushed slightly. Although she was secretly happy, she did not show it on her face.

She simply laughed and said, “Sure! Since Junior Brother has said so, then we’ll make an appointment another day.”

At this moment, Gao Shun, who had been silent, walked toward Hua Rufeng.

“Martial Uncle Gao, is there something wrong?” Seeing this, Hua Rufeng was puzzled.

Gao Shun did not say much, but used his spiritual sense to scan Hua Rufeng’s current physical condition.

So he had really reached the void realm…

Gao Shun turned around and walked away with difficulty. His pupils were filled with shock. He then looked deeply at Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun.

As Gongsun Shouyue’s disciple, Hua Rufeng had only listened to Ye Xuan’s guidance for a while and managed to experience an epiphany.

He had never forgotten the bet with Ye Xuan. His mood was complicated, and he wanted nothing more than to check. However, the Seven Peaks competition was approaching, so checking their cultivation level in front of everyone was simply inappropriate.

After the incident ended, everyone dispersed.

However, as if affected by Hua Rufeng’s breakthrough to the void realm, the cultivators of the Great Wilderness Divine sect would all begin to cultivate like crazy.

Gongsun Shouyue looked at everyone, and then said to Ye Xuan, “What you did today has really opened my eyes.”

“With just a few words, my disciple experienced an epiphany. This speaks volumes about Junior Brother Ye’s own comprehension ability and cultivation level.”

The people around him nodded in agreement.

“Senior Brother Gongsun is too kind. I’m still far from being a true expert,” Ye Xuan said lightly.

When Gao Shun saw this, a hint of a cold smile appeared on his face.

“Hmph! It was just a coincidence!”

“Martial Nephew Hua’s talent is outstanding, so it was only to be expected that he would encounter an epiphany at some point.”

“You just happened to be at the right place at the right time.”

Ye Xuan laughed when he heard this. He was not bothered by Gao Shun’s words, because at this moment, a system notification had suddenly rang out in Ye Xuan’s mind.

“Ding! As the host has helped a cultivator of the Great Wilderness Divine sect to obtain an epiphany, the host has obtained a randomized 100x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained an epiphany experience opportunity (The benefits gained by the host during this epiphany will be a hundred times that of what Hua Rufeng gained!)”

The system really was awesome. It even rewarded him for catalyzing an epiphany experience.

Ye Xuan looked at Gao Shun with a smile.

“Senior Brother Gao, you’re right. An epiphany opportunity is hard to come by once even in 100 years. It can be said to be a favor bestowed by the heavens. There’s no way it could have been caused by me.”

“It’s good that Junior Brother Ye understands this. I’m just giving you a kind reminder so that you don’t become arrogant. It’s better to be down-to-earth!”

“Oh? What if I can immediately enter a state of epiphany?” Ye Xuan asked indifferently.

As soon as he finished speaking, Gongsun Shouyue, who was about to leave, suddenly turned around. Everyone’s eyes fell on Ye Xuan at the same time, and the scene suddenly became quiet.

Everyone knew that Cloud Sky peak and Hidden Sword peak had never been on good terms, especially the relationship between the two chiefs.

They did not expect the two of them to fight again at this moment. It seemed that there would be some sort of show to watch now.

“Junior Brother Ye, you can say whatever you want, but it doesn’t mean a thing unless it actually happens,” Gao Shun said coldly.

“Do you really think that it’s so easy to obtain an epiphany experience opportunity? Most cultivators never experience one in their entire lives!”

Gao Shun’s eyes were full of ridicule, as he really felt that Ye Xuan’s words were ridiculous.

The chiefs had all been cultivating for hundreds or even thousands of years to break through and reach their current levels.

Not everyone could be as lucky as Hua Rufeng.

Ye Xuan’s words not only made Gao Shun laugh, but the other chiefs beside him also shook their heads, thinking that Ye Xuan was bragging.

Ye Xuan, on the other hand, smiled. He liked it best when he could prove people wrong in front of their faces.

After that, Ye Xuan stretched his back and slowly walked out of the courtyard.

The very next second, a surge of energy suddenly erupted, as the spiritual energy in the surroundings began to condense and gather around him.

“What? What’s going on?”

When everyone saw this scene, their eyes were filled with disbelief.

A terrifying spiritual energy vortex formed above Cloud Sky peak, one that was a hundred times stronger than Hua Rufeng’s.

“Isn’t this… an epiphany?”

When Gongsun Shouyue saw this, his pupils shrank. His eyes were filled with disbelief. He was completely dumbfounded.

Everyone was shocked senseless, especially Gao Shun, whose expression was constantly contorting and changing.

“No… That’s impossible. How could he enter a state of epiphany?”

...

“Why does it seem like his epiphany far exceeds Hua Rufeng’s as well?”
