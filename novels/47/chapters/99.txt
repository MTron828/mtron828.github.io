At the same time, Ming He, who had been standing casually in mid-air just now, suddenly moved.

“Ye Xuan!”

Ming He raised his eyelids slightly and slowly spat out two words. The hands behind his back loosened.

Ye Xuan actually killed Li Wuji and Gongsun Wuji in his presence. This was undoubtedly an affront to his dignity.

He had no clue that Ye Xuan was that powerful, so even he did not have time to react.

Two elders had fallen. The sect had suffered a serious loss!

“You are only twenty years old, but have already reached the golden core realm. Young man, you are indeed a top-notch genius!”

“In these 500 years I’ve lived, among the geniuses I’ve seen, you are ranked in the top three!”

Ming He looked at Ye Xuan expressionlessly, and his indifferent voice resounded across the sky. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“But your youth is also your fatal flaw. You are not strong enough!”

“Although golden core realm cultivators are powerful, from my perspective, you’re just a rather strong ant!”

As soon as he finished speaking, an incomparably terrifying pressure suddenly descended.

Amidst this vast sea of pressure, even the ground could not stop trembling.

This was the power of a peak core formation realm expert!

When the crowd saw this, they were aghast. Their bodies could not stop trembling, and some of the weaker practitioners even directly knelt on the ground.

Even the elders of the Xuanyin sect felt the pressure.

However, their hearts were filled with joy. The Qingyun sect would have no chance of making a comeback.

Wan Shanhai and other elders despaired.

Weighed down by this terrible pressure, they simply could not even lift a finger to resist.

“Young man, you should be honored!”

“Because you will die at the hands of a peak core formation realm powerhouse!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ming He took a step forward and his figure suddenly disappeared.

“Ridiculous!”

At this moment, a cold laugh suddenly rang out, followed by the appearance of an endless and seemingly boundless power.

In an instant, the terrifying pressure that was originally weighing down on everyone suddenly dissipated.

“Cultivators of the Qingyun sect, today, I, Ye Xuan, will grant you an opportunity!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the God-slaying Sword suddenly appeared in Ye Xuan’s hand.

Strong gusts of wind suddenly blew past. Holding the God-slaying Sword in his hand, Ye Xuan stood in mid-air. His long black hair fluttered in the wind.

He looked at Ming He calmly, as if he was a Sword God who stood proudly above everything else in the world.

When everyone saw this, they were shocked.

Moments later, sword qi that was as vast as the ocean, and as boundless as the stars, soared into the sky while emitting an incomparably bright light!

The sword qi was filled with a domineering power, which instantly crushed the pressure Ming He was exerting.

Ye Xuan, with one sword, suppressed the entire world. It was as if he was a Sword God who looked down on the world!

His body emitted an incredibly domineering aura.

This scene was deeply engraved in the hearts of countless cultivators.

Many years later, there was a legend passed down in the Qingyun sect that described the valor and greatness of a peerless expert who had used a single sword to shake the Heavens and the Earth, rescuing the sect from danger.

The terrifying and tyrannical sword qi raged wildly, causing the whole world to tremble.

This was Ye Xuan’s Sword Overlord physique!

Everyone felt the terrifying pressure that was originally weighing down on their bodies suddenly disappear.

Ye Xuan sword qi seemed to be unrivaled.

At this moment, a resplendent stream of light flashed past, and Ming He’s figure suddenly appeared not far from Ye Xuan.

Victory had been in his grasp, but his arrogant expression was now gone. What had replaced it was extreme fear.

Peak of the core formation realm!

Ye Xuan was actually in the same realm as him!

Ming He went completely mad.

This felt even more ridiculous than if a supreme unity realm expert had suddenly appeared in the Great Qian Dynasty.

Ye Xuan was only 20 years old, but he had already reached the peak of the core formation realm!

Was this guy really human?

He had cultivated for hundreds of years, and massacred countless people to gather enough qi and blood essence, in order to reach the peak of the core formation realm!

Although this was related to his damaged cultivation foundation, it was enough to show everyone just how difficult it was for cultivators to reach the peak of the core formation realm.

“How is this possible?”

Ming He’s pupils suddenly constricted, His eyes bulged with disbelief.

“Hehe, why shouldn’t it be possible?”

“Everything is possible when I’m involved!”

Ye Xuan stood in mid-air, his body emitting a domineering sword qi that could seemingly tear even space apart.

“You are just a piece of trash who spent hundreds of years cultivating before breaking through to the peak of the core formation realm!”

“Moreover, you are just a piece of trash who relied on slaughtering mortals to collect their qi and blood essence. Only then did you barely reach the requirements to advance to the peak of the core formation realm!”

Ye Xuan’s words were filled with a domineering aura, and every word was aimed at Ming He’s heart. Ming He’s expression immediately turned ugly.

“If I wanted to kill you, it would be as easy as squashing an ant!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he raised the God-slaying Sword. He pointed the sharp tip of the sword pointed at Ming He, and then he enunciated the following words very clearly.

“Today, the Xuanyin sect will be destroyed!”

“Arrogant brat!”

Hearing this, Ming He became furious. He reached out his hand, and a long black spear suddenly appeared!

“All Xuanyin sect cultivators, follow my lead and kill this kid!”

Ming He’s body was filled with surging energy, and his voice resounded in the sky like thunder.

Both of them were at the peak of the core formation realm, and it would be difficult to determine the victor within a short period of time.

Therefore, Ming He wanted to utilize the combined power of the Xuanyin sect to kill Ye Xuan!

Underworld blood and the elders of the mysterious dark sect had already been petrified on the spot when Ye Xuan killed Li Wuji and Gongsun Wuji with lightning-like methods.

To be able to resolve the pressure of the forefather so easily, the opponent’s true realm instantly leaped out!

Ye Xuan, he had actually stepped into the completion of the core formation realm!

For a moment, it was as if they had been struck by lightning. Their eyes were filled with disbelief, and it was hard for them to accept this reality for a moment.

It was not until the voice of the Nether River suddenly exploded in their minds that they came back to their senses.

“We will obey the orders of the forefather!”

In an instant, all the cultivation practitioners of the mysterious dark sect suddenly exploded the power in their bodies, turning into a stream of light and attacking Ye Xuan together.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan’s expression did not change at all.

Attack him from all sides? That was good too. He would not have to kill them one by one!
