587 Asking For Help

Feng Tianyi’s words had undoubtedly hit hard.

After all, it was the emperor’s orders that he had to follow, not Prince Zhanglu.

He was a general who held military power, but he was not allowed to mobilize the army without an order stamped with the royal seal.

“This subordinate understands,” Li Kun replied in a trembling voice.

!!

Even though he was terrified, he was also extremely grateful that the Crown Prince had let him off this time.

If the Crown Prince did not show any mercy this time, not only would he lose his position as general, but he might also lose his life.

Feng Tianyi stared at Li Kun, and then returned to Ye Xuan’s side, thinking about how to deal with this matter.

After a while, Feng Tianyi said sincerely, “Chief Ye Xuan, General Li Kun has realized his mistake. Could you spare him this time?”

After he finished speaking, Feng Tianyi winked at Feng Xiyun.

‘Sister!’

‘Your brother treated you well in the past, didn’t he? I need your help now.’

As Ye Xuan’s disciple, it would be much more effective if she was the one persuading him.

Feng Tianyi was so anxious that he was sweating. His status as Crown Prince was worthless in this situation. Actually, even if the emperor came here in person, it would not change a thing.

If Ye Xuan really did not want to, he could easily ignore his request without consequence.

Were it not for the fact that his sister was Ye Xuan’s disciple, Feng Tianyi would not have even considered letting Li Kun off. After all, he might get himself into trouble if he was not careful.

Feng Xiyun noticed her brother’s intentions and understood what he wanted her to do.

Although she did not want to interfere with her teacher, she also wanted to help her brother out a little.

After a while, Feng Xiyun pulled on Ye Xuan’s arm and said tentatively, “Teacher, although Li Kun did participate in this matter, he didn’t overtly take action. Could you let him off this time?”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan rubbed Feng xiyun’s head in a pampering manner and replied, “Alright, I’ll agree this time.”

Ye Xuan was not bothered about Li Kun at all. After all, the one truly at fault for today’s matters was Prince Zhanglu.

However, at this moment, Ye Xuan looked at Feng Xiyun and continued, “Xiyun, being kind and compassionate is indeed a good quality, but at times, it can also be a bad thing.”

“I can let Li Kun off today, but there’s something you must be clear about.”

After hearing this, Feng Xiyun tilted her head to look at her teacher, feeling somewhat puzzled. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“What is it Teacher??”

Ye Xuan emphasized his next words clearly.

“Remember this. Sympathizing with an enemy is hurting yourself.”

Feng Xiyun’s trembled when she heard that. She nodded affirmatively to indicate that she had taken his words to heart.

The path of cultivation was already very difficult. If you sympathized with an enemy, he might stab you in the back the very next day, or return kindness with evil when he became strong enough.

“Teacher, I understand.”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan was satisfied. These things were important learning opportunities for his disciples.

In any case, both Prince Zhanglu and Li Kun did not pose a threat to him at all, and could be erased from existence with a wave of his hand.

However, the situation offered an opportunity for his disciples to see the evils of this world. His two disciples were still too innocent. He was also afraid that they would be too kind to their enemies and end up harming themselves or being taken advantage of.

After Ye Xuan finished explaining this matter, he said expressionlessly, “You should be glad that Xiyun interceded for you today. Let’s drop this matter.”

“But…”

As he spoke, Ye Xuan stared straight at Prince Zhanglu, and the corners of his mouth curled up. This guy was both a good and a bad guy. He was annoying and trying to cause problems for him, but this guy had also made him rich.

Perhaps this was an opportunity for him to earn even more money. After all, it was this person’s own fault for coming to his doorstep for some fleecing.

Ye Xuan walked up to the trembling Li Kun and said to him, “You should leave this place first.”

Hearing this, Li Kun’s face instantly lit up with joy. The stone that had been weighing upon his heart was finally lifted, and he quickly replied, “Thank you, Chief Ye Xuan! I’ll leave immediately.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Li Kun hurriedly left with his soldiers, not daring to stay for even a moment.

‘F*ck…’

Feng Tianyi was dumbfounded by this scene. He ran away so quickly…

As a general who guarded the borders, he actually fled so quickly in an emergency. If the borders were in danger, could he really be relied on?

Feng Tianyi was in disbelief.

However, after thinking about it from another perspective, he felt that this was very normal. Li Kun might not be afraid of an enemy army, but a supreme realm expert was another matter altogether.

No matter how many troops he had under his command, fighting a supreme realm expert was no different than hurling eggs against a rock.

Even a mystic lord realm cultivator would probably be scared out of their wits if they knew that they had angered a supreme realm expert.

At this moment, Ye Xuan stared at Prince Zhanglu, smiling. After a while, he said, “Prince Zhanglu, weren’t you very arrogant just now? Were you not going to punish me for going against you?”

After hearing this, Feng Lu wanted to bury his head in his knees. He waved his hands and said, “No… No, no…”

“In front of you, how could I be so arrogant?”

Feng Lu wished he could dig a hole and bury himself in it.

If he had known that Ye Xuan was a supreme realm cultivator, he would have never done such a thing. After all, he did not want to die yet.
