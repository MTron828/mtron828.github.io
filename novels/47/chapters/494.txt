During this period of time, Su Tiansheng had kept himself updated regarding matters to Ye Xuan, and was well aware of how well the latter treated his disciples.

Right now, joining Cloud Sky peak was considered a blessing of a lifetime. However, very few would ever have that chance.

After all, to date, Ye Xuan had only accepted two disciples, which spoke volumes about how picky he was with disciples.

However, it seemed that Ye Xuan favored Su Changhe to some extent.

Su Tiansheng was wondering…

Had his son gained Ye Xuan’s approval?

This was why he had asked Su Changhe to build a palace on Cloud Sky peak. He hoped that Su Changhe would be able to prove himself and join Cloud Sky peak.

It seemed that his decision had been correct, and his son had indeed put in effort.

“Chief Ye Xuan, although the people who came with me aren’t very strong, they are all experts who often tread on the edge of life and death. Moreover, they are extremely familiar with this location, and have ample battle experience.”

“As long as we’re not faced with those powerful beasts, we should be able to hold our own.”

“That’s good!”

Ye Xuan nodded and did not say anything more.

“Still, you have to be careful. Right now, the archaic divine mountains are brewing with trouble, and a heaven-shaking battle could erupt at any moment! Even I may not be able to protect you!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan turned around and continued watching the great battle.

Su Changhe stood behind Ye Xuan in silence.

He naturally heard Ye Xuan’s words and knew that those words were also directed toward him. He felt touched by Ye Xuan’s concern for him. It seemed that his efforts had paid off.

Moreover, during his time with Ye Xuan, his ambitions had changed drastically.

No longer was he satisfied being a hedonistic son of a rich family in Qingyang City.

He wanted to become a true expert and enjoy the admiration of thousands.

At the thought of this, Su Changhe made up his mind.

‘Chief Ye Xuan has high expectations of me, so I can’t let him down. I must work hard on my cultivation in the future!’

However, after he made that oath, he put on a frivolous smile again, as if that entire sequence of events had never happened.

At this moment, Chu Tianba walked over. He looked at Ye Xuan in surprise, his eyes full of shock.

He had already learned about what had happened yesterday from Situ Mo.

He could scarcely believe that Ye Xuan had managed to severely injure the heaven devouring divine sparrow with just a single sword strike.

“I didn’t expect Fellow Daoist Ye Xuan’s strength to be so terrifying. You’ve truly earned my admiration!”

“In the thousands of years of our East continent’s history, this is the first time a mystic lord realm cultivator has managed to go toe-to-toe with a supreme realm being!”

Chu Tianba was truly shocked. Even Chief Tian Xuan had not managed to deal such a devastating blow to the heaven devouring divine sparrow back then.

Why was everyone from Cloud Sky peak so powerful? Was the air on the peak so magical?

Everyone thought that Cloud Sky peak would decline after the passing of Chief Tian Xuan, yet an even more ferocious expert had now appeared.

Just how terrifying was this fellow’s strength?

Ye Xuan smiled and said humbly, “I was just lucky to catch it off-guard. There’s nothing special about what I did.”

Hearing this, Chu Tianba’s mouth twitched, and he could not help but roll his eyes.

It feels like this guy is pretending to be humble. What was with that serious look?

However, this did not change his admiration for Ye Xuan’s strength.

If there were no accidents, this fellow’s future achievements would surpass his teacher’s.

Thinking this, Chu Tianba made a decision.

It was best to build a good relationship with a future supreme realm expert!

“Hahaha! Fellow Daoist Ye Xuan is too humble. I have cultivated for hundreds of years and have seen countless geniuses, but I’ve never seen someone as monstrously talented and powerful as Fellow Daoist Ye Xuan!”

“With your strength, you will eventually become famous and your legacy will span generations!”

Chu Tianba touched his beard and flattered him shamelessly.

Right at that moment, an enigmatic voice suddenly rang out.

“Hahaha! A legacy that will span generations? Isn’t that a little too much?”

As soon as that person finished speaking, the atmosphere instantly changed.

Ye Xuan looked up and saw space twist slightly, before the figure of a black-robed old man revealed itself.

Ye Xuan’s expression turned serious.

His spiritual sense told him that this old man was also a peak-level mystic lord realm expert.

After Elder Taiyin used his teleportation divine power to rush over, he heard Chu Tianba’s praise for Ye Xuan, and could not but refute it.

Elder Taiyin looked at Ye Xuan indifferently and said mockingly, “You’re the chief of Cloud Sky peak, Ye Xuan, right?”

As he spoke, a terrifying spiritual pressure suddenly filled the air.

Some of the weaker cultivators were forced to take a few steps back.

“What terrifying spiritual pressure. Who is this old man? Why is his strength so terrifying?”

Seeing this, Su Tiansheng frowned with worry. It was obvious that he had no clue who Elder Taiyin was, which made sense since the latter had been in secluded cultivation for a hundred years. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Father, is Chief Ye Xuan in danger? Is something going to happen?”

...

Su Changhe asked in a low voice.

From this situation, it was obvious that this old man had come with ill intentions.

Su Tiansheng shook his head helplessly.

He was just a heaven realm cultivator, and could make no difference in a situation that involved mystic lord realm experts.

Furthermore, he had no way of telling who was stronger. Still, he had an inexplicable sense of confidence in Ye Xuan.

After all, the latter’s feats were simply miraculous!
