417 Absolute Power

“Very good! It seems like you’ve made your decision!”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan smiled, and a terrifying light flashed across the depths of his eyes.

His disciples had already been bullied ruthlessly. As a teacher, if he still could not take revenge for them, he should just find a piece of tofu and smash himself to death.

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan’s fingers turned into swords. The surroundings shook, and the world became darker.

A terrifying sword aura shot up into the sky.

Everyone’s eyes were filled with shock, and their bodies started to tremble and creak.

Mu Beichen, who had always been obsessed with the Sword Dao, automatically stood up when he saw this.

“Unbelievable! Chief Ye Xuan’s sword intent has reached such a terrifying level. His sword intent is no weaker than Chief Tian Xuan’s!”

“Have you noticed? All the flowers and trees within a hundred-mile radius are releasing a terrifying sword aura!”

“It’s like a sword domain. Within the domain, his sword qi is everywhere!”

These were the words of the guardian behind Mu Beichen. His eyes betrayed the shock he felt.

It was rare for him to meet such an expert, and he almost could not restrain himself from approaching Ye Xuan to ask for a spar.

However, he quickly dispelled that thought.

When the tyrannical sword intent appeared, Sun Mobai and the others immediately paled. The other two wanted to dig out Li Siyuan’s ancestral grave and burn their bones to ashes.

‘Even if you want to screw your teammates over, could you not do it so overtly?’

However, at this moment, they had no way out and could only try their best to resist.

“Use the power of the formation to resist the sword qi!”

Sun Mobai and the other elders looked at each other and understood what needed to be done.

Immediately, their spiritual power surged out and created a mysterious formation. Moments later, a dragon flew out of the formation and rushed toward Ye Xuan’s sword qi.

A violent force swept through the world, and gusts of wind gradually picked up, forming a whirlwind.

At the center of this, Ye Xuan’s expression was calm and indifferent.

He had yet to use an artifact, nor the Flora Sword technique.

At this moment, two of his fingers formed a sword, and the sword qi that filled the sky suddenly condensed into a dazzling divine sword that cut through the sky toward the dragon.

“Today, I will slay a dragon,” Ye Xuan said.

“Don’t even think about it!”

“Break!”

Li Siyuan roared madly as he mustered all of his spiritual power to block this sword strike.

“Heavens! That’s what a true sword cultivator is like!”

Boom!

The dazzling sword qi easily split the dragon in half and crashed into the three-person formation.

Pfft!

As cracks appeared on the formation, it shattered.

Li Siyuan and the others vomited blood, and their auras weakened considerably.

“This…”

Li Siyuan looked up at Ye Xuan in the sky. His heart was now filled with fear, and his previous arrogance was gone.

They were both mystic lord realm experts, but he was actually unable to block that sword strike, even with the power of the formation!

When he saw Sun Mobai crashing to the ground, Lin Dong immediately became anxious as he furiously glared at Ye Xuan.

“Ye Xuan, you actually injured my teacher. I’m going to beat you up!”

Lin Dong immediately retrieved the longsword from his storage ring and swung it at Ye Xuan.

However, when it was several millimeters away from Ye Xuan’s chest, the sword was unable to advance any further.

Ye Xuan expressionlessly looked at Lin Dong. With a wave of his sleeve, a powerful force ruthlessly struck Lin Dong’s chest.

“What a joke! Did this kid not have a brain? Why did he attack a mystic lord realm expert?”

“Did he go blind? Or lose his mind? How ignorant!”

On the tall building, Mu Beichen’s lips curved into a mocking smile.

“You… you actually attacked my son?”

Seeing his precious son severely injured, Lin Youming flew into a rage and rushed towards Ye Xuan without hesitation.

However, the outcome was the same. He too was beaten up.

In the face of absolute power, any struggle or resistance was futile.

Pfft!

Lin Youming spit out a mouthful of blood as multiple bones in his body were broken.

At that moment, Lin Youming felt despair in his heart, but even more so, regret.

‘How foolish! To think that a single mistake would actually bring about such a monstrous disaster to the Lin family. If the Lin family was to be destroyed, then he and Lin Dong would be the Lin family’s sinners.’

Ye Xuan looked at Lin Youming indifferently, then reached out his hand to kill him.

However, at this moment, a voice suddenly rang out in the sky.

“Junior Brother Ye Xuan, please show mercy!”
