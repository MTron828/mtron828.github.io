552 Officially Together

Ye Xuan actually wanted to give her the immortal heavenly treasure?

She could not understand it at all. He had just spent so much effort to obtain it, yet he was giving it to her instead?

She looked at him questioningly.

This time, everything that happened in this ancient tomb had already exceeded her expectations.

“I…”

Yanran had already started to stammer. Looking at Ye Xuan’s tender gaze, she could not say anything.

However, when her gaze turned to the immortal heavenly treasure in his hand, she could not bear to accept it.

After all, Ye Xuan had already given her many treasures, and she really could not bring herself to continue accepting them.

She did not only care about herself. How could she allow Ye Xuan to give her things without anything in return every time?

After all, love should be mutual and equal, right?

Thinking this, Yanran tilted her head and said, “I can’t accept it!”

“Oh my god, are these two weirdos? One is fighting to give it, and the other refuses to accept it!”

The onlookers who had not left were completely dumbfounded. Could they stop teasing them? If those two did not want it, why not give it to them instead?

What were they trying to pull here?

Hearing Yanran’s response, Ye Xuan was also a little surprised, but he could tell that her decision was due to her feelings for him. It seemed that he had made excellent progress in terms of solidifying their relationship.

This was really good.

Ye Xuan looked at Yanran tenderly and said, “Little Ran, I’ve already told you that no treasure in this world can compare to you.”

“Even though this immortal heavenly treasure is indeed quite rare, compared to you, it’s nothing. Just accept it.”

Hearing this, Yanran once again blushed.

Could he stop saying sappy things like that?

It was really hard to reject him like this.

Yanran slowly turned around and stared straight into Ye Xuan’s eyes.

Did he really mean what he said?

Was he really intent on giving her such a precious treasure?

Ye Xuan struck while the iron was hot and said, “Perhaps you’re not aware of this yet, but you’ve already become a beacon of light in my life, and my future and hope.”

“I was struck with a special feeling from the moment I met you. I…”

After hearing Ye Xuan’s words, Yanran could not hold it in anymore and quickly interrupted him, “Stop, I’ll take it, I’ll take it, okay?”

How could he say such things in public? Although it was very sweet, it was too embarrassing.

Now that she thought about it, it was really a great blessing that she had been able to meet Ye Xuan here.

She looked at Ye Xuan with a tender face and said in a soft voice, “I understand your intentions. I’ll accept this immortal heavenly treasure.”

After saying this, Tanran carefully put the immortal heavenly treasure away, and then lowered her head with a red face.

She did not know what else to say at this moment. Her mind was in a mess.

Seeing that Yanran had finally agreed to accept his gift, Ye Xuan was also very happy.

‘I should be able to earn an awesome reward this time, right?’

Fortunately, his previous life’s experience of flirting with girls was not in vain. He still had some skills and swag.

‘Give me a higher critical multiplier. Come on, come on.’

At this moment, Yanran seemed to have made up her mind and raised her head to look at Ye Xuan.

In the next moment, Yanran closed her eyes and slowly kissed Ye Xuan without saying a word.

Since she did not know what to say, she might as well give him a kiss. That was what Yanran was thinking at the moment.

Since she already considered him to be her actual boyfriend, why not give him a kiss?

This time, it was Ye Xuan’s turn to be stunned. He was so shocked that he did not know how to respond.

Was Yanran so bold?

Since this was the case, he would not refuse. He decided to enjoy it fully…

After a long while, Yanran covered her face with her hands and lowered her head again. Her shy expression made her look very cute.

So this was what it felt like to kiss someone.

It really was too wonderful. It was soft, and there was even a hint of sweetness. She almost did not want the kiss to end.

‘After this trip to the ancient tomb is over, I’ll have to ask a few experienced senior sisters and have them teach me about it.’

After thinking about this, Yanran blushed and smiled shyly, which made Ye Xuan’s heart beat faster as well, and he looked at Yanran in a daze.

“I’m very satisfied with what you gave me,” Ye Xuan said to Yanran with a tender expression.

Then, Yanran suddenly said, “If you don’t mind, let me be your official girlfriend, okay?”

“Of course I don’t mind. I couldn’t be happier to hear that.”

Ye Xuan immediately agreed. His efforts had not been in vain.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎
