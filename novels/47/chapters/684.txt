685 Pushed Back!

Seeing that Ye Xuan was so confident, everyone began to itch with anticipation for the battle to begin.

‘There’s a good show to watch,’ Gao Shun thought happily. He knew Ye Xuan very well. This junior brother of his would never do something he was not confident in.

“Hehe, if everyone passes this round, our sect will have three disciples at the summit,” Li Dahai said happily.

This would be an extremely glorious achievement for the Great Wilderness Divine sect. No matter what the final outcome was, their reputation would soar.

!!

It would be even better if Zhuge Yueyue or Hua Rufeng could emerge victorious. How great would that be?

Of the three, Xiang Yun was the wildcard. If someone triggered her berserk mode, then there was even a chance that she might become the champion.

All in all, things were looking up for the Great Wilderness Divine sect.

Ao Lei was also smiling. After a while, he said, “Let’s not jump to conclusions. Everyone who has reached this stage is a genius, and there’s no telling what will happen.”

Hearing this, the Great Wilderness Divine sect’s cultivators expressed their agreement and glued their eyes on the screen in the sky.

They could see that Zhuge Yueyue had already unsheathed the Cloud Sky Sword, as was pointing it at Xie Tianyu.

The reason why she used the Cloud Sky Sword was because it was representative of Cloud Sky peak. She wanted to use it in battle like Chief Tian Xuan had back then and make Cloud Sky peak famous!

“Let’s begin,” Zhuge Yueyue said with a cold expression.

Xie Tianyu also drew his weapon. He had been waiting for today’s battle for a long time, and could not wait to wash away the shame of his past defeat.

After drawing his blood-red saber, he instantly unleashed his peak-level void realm aura.

“The show is about to begin.”

When the people outside saw this, they all held their breaths in unison.

Moments later, a saber beam shot toward Zhuge Yueyue.

Xie Tianyu had made the first move!

The saber beam crashed into the Cloud Sky Sword mightily, causing ZhugeYueyue’s body to tremble.

She was shocked. It seemed that Xie Tianyu’s combat strength had actually increased significantly.

Even so, she believed that it would not change the outcome, and said indifferently, “You’re still too weak. You’ve only improved a little after such a long time.”

As soon as she finished speaking, Zhuge Yueyue unleashed a sword beam in his direction.

“Hehe, don’t use these old tricks. Don’t tell me you haven’t learned anything new after such a long time? Hurry up and use it.”

“If you still want to use these old tricks to win, I advise you to stop dreaming and return to reality.”

After that, Xie Tianyu launched an attack. His saber strikes fell like meteors.

Within a short period of time, the two of them had already exchanged hundreds of blows, yet could not determine who was stronger.

They were both probing each other, looking for flaws.

However, the two of them were too cautious when they fought, so there was no way to detect them at all.

Zhuge Yueyue could no longer hold herself back as she unleashed another sword beam to force Xie Tianyu back.

Moments later, she ran her left hand across the length of the Cloud Sky Sword, causing it to emit an ice-cold aura.

“Is that Hell Slash?” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Seeing this menacing cold aura, everyone recognized that this was the Hell Slash that had defeated Xie Tianyu previously.

At this moment, the hell emissary bared his fangs and brandished his claws, emitting a terrifying aura.

“It’s this move again!”

Xie Tianyu’s expression darkened. He knew that Zhuge Yueyue was not holding back anymore, and planned to deal with him as quickly as possible.

However, he was no longer the same person as back then

Xie Tianyu smiled disdainfully and raised his saber without hesitation, which started to emit an extremely evil and terrifying aura.

As blood-red clouds gathered in the sky, a ferocious beast slowly condensed in the sky and appeared directly in front of the hell emissary.

“Beast Gaze!”

Everyone recognized this move as Li Hong had used it earlier. Furthermore, it seemed that Xie Tianyu’s proficiency was higher than Li Hong’s!

As the two auras collided, Zhuge Yueyue’s Hell Slash became weaker.

Moreover, the ferocious beast in the sky seemed to be devouring the hell emissary’s power to strengthen itself.

Zhuge Yueyue was shocked when she realized this. She finally understood why Xie Tianyu was so confident.

“Hehe, from the looks of it, the cultivators of Cloud Sky peak are nothing special.”

Seeing this, Daoist Gu Hao’s furrowed brows finally relaxed, and a smile finally appeared on his face. It seemed that victory was at hand.

Despite the fact that everyone had heard his sarcastic remark, no one paid any attention to him. Their eyes were still fixed on the battle on the screen.

Inside the ancient realm, the ferocious beast and the hell emissary collided again.

With a loud bang, Zhuge Yueyue was forced to retreat, and her face turned pale.

This time, she was actually at a disadvantage
