614 Fierce Attack

Hearing this, Ye Xuan was overjoyed. However, his face remained calm as he said, “That’s fine too. Another day then.”

“Also, I’ve also learned a very powerful technique during this time, and want to discuss it with you. When you have free time, come by, Senior Sister.”

Yuelun’s eyes lit up when she heard that Ye Xuan had learned a new technique.

However, she suddenly recalled how Ye Xuan had teased her before, and she immediately put up her guard. It was better to test him first.

After pondering for a moment, Yuelun asked with great interest, “Junior Brother, what kind of technique are you talking about? Can you tell me a little bit about it first?”

After smiling, Ye Xuan stared at Yuelun and calmly said, “Actually, it’s a kind of attack technique.”

“Oh?”

Yuelun was momentarily stunned.

An attack technique? Then it should be quite strong, right?

“Don’t keep me in suspense. Hurry up and tell me.”

“If it’s really as awesome as you say, we can discuss it in depth when the opportunity presents itself.”

Seeing that the fish had taken the bait, Ye Xuan smirked. This lady was really innocent.

After a moment, Ye Xuan spoke in a deliberately profound tone.

“I’ve been quite free recently, so I’ve come up with a set of attack techniques. I’ve named it ‘chain attack’!”

“As long as you use this set of attack techniques, you can continuously output damage in a short period of time. It possesses great offensive capabilities, and allows the user to beat the opponent until they cry out…”

After hearing these words, Yuelun was even more tempted.

“It’s called a chain attack? It seems to be really strong… Junior Brother Ye, is there anything unique about it?” Yuelun asked with great interest.

Her junior brother was not playing around with her this time, right?

Ye Xuan smiled even more happily and continued to elaborate.

“After activating it, it will increase the user’s attack speed for a short period of time, catching the enemy off guard and causing them to cry out for mercy.”

“Heavens!”

Yuelun was surprised. A technique that could increase attack speed was quite rare.

At that moment, Yuelun’s imagination began to run wild.

She was even simulating how she would deal with Ye Xuan’s attacks if he were to use it. It did seem very tricky to deal with.

If she could also learn it, then her combat strength would definitely reach a higher level!

“Junior Brother Ye, hurry up and tell me more.”

Yuelun said coyly as she directly grabbed Ye Xuan’s arm and started tugging on it.

Haha, this senior sister of mine is really too interesting. I’ll never get tired of playing with her.

After a moment, Ye Xuan said, “How should I put it? This technique isn’t exactly extremely powerful. After all, it’s mainly based on speed, so if one’s offensive power is insufficient, or if one encounters an enemy specializing in defense, it would be useless.”

After thinking for a moment, Yuelun agreed with what Ye Xuan had just said.

“You’re right. After a series of rapid outbursts like that, I guess you’d probably be almost out of strength. If you haven’t penetrated the enemy’s defenses by then, then it’ll probably be like prodding the enemy with a stick. They wouldn’t feel anything.” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Hearing this, Ye Xuan was stunned. Who was playing with who now?

He forcefully suppressed his smile and said, “However, I have a way to deal with this weakness.”

“Ah? Can you tell me?” Yuelun asked curiously.

“This technique of mine is called a fierce attack! As long as you launch a fierce attack, you can make your opponent scream again and again, and there is no way to resist!”

“Even if her defense is very strong, under the effect of my fierce attack technique, no matter how strong her defense is, it will be shattered and she will immediately beg for mercy.”

“What?”

Yuelun was completely stunned. It was so powerful, to the point that even a cultivator specializing in defense would not be able to resist it?

Was the fierce attack technique a heaven-grade divine power, or even higher?

After thinking for a moment, Yuelun sighed with emotion. The number of techniques Ye Xuan knew was really outrageous.

After seeing Yuelun’s shocked expression, Ye Xuan was inwardly giggling. However, he held back his laughter and continued, “This fierce attack of mine has to meet the opponent head on. This way, I can break through the opponent’s defense psychologically.”

“And I don’t only have this technique, I even have a thrust…”

“Senior Sister Yue, let’s have an in-depth discussion when you’re free. You’ll definitely like it.”

Ye Xuan said with a smile, but Yuelun’s expression turned a little strange after hearing this.

“There’s also a thrust?” Yuelun muttered to herself.

At this moment, an untimely voice was heard.

“Teacher, it’s getting late. We have to go back to Water Sky peak,” Li Hanyi reminded her in a soft voice.

Yuelun hurriedly nodded while thinking, ‘I’m done for. I forgot about my own important matter. I didn’t have time to set up any protective measures for the chiliad gold vine sapling that I just planted.’
