“What should we do?”

The corners of Ye Xuan’s mouth curled up. Given this current situation, he could only think of ways to break this seal.

Ye Xuan was still lacking in the aspect of seals. With his current attainments in the field, he might not be able to break it.

However, since the situation had already developed to this point. Ye Xuan could also take this opportunity to seriously study this seal and improve his knowledge in the area of seals.

That being said, there was something he needed to do first. He turned to the injured people behind him, and took out a large number of recovery pills..

“Adjust your conditions first. We’ll talk more once everyone has recovered. In the meantime, I’ll study this seal and try to figure out the mysteries it contains.”FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan handed these pills to Ao Lei and asked him to distribute them. Then, he put his full focus onto the seal, probing and investigating it using his spiritual sense, trying to find a flaw.

However, at this moment, a dense amount of energy was suddenly transmitted through the seal. Ye Xuan immediately followed the trail of this energy and chased after it.

In the endless abyss below, Ye Xuan vaguely sensed a huge cage filled with the aura of death.

“Oh my god…

Ye Xuan’s heart could not help but tremble. He was extremely surprised, as he had not expected there to be such a huge cage hidden in the ground underneath their feet.

Without much hesitation, Ye Xuan immediately decided to use his spiritual sense to find out who or what was trapped in the cage.

“You guys stay here and protect me. I’ll be using my soul to check something.”

He also turned around and looked at Ao Lei as he said this. He then sat down cross-legged and allowed his soul to float out, heading straight for the huge cage below.

He could see some dilapidated ancient ruins nearby, which were filled with ghosts.

Moments later, his soul reached a high platform, from which he could see a figure firmly bound by chains in the cage.

As if sensing his presence, the man in the cage with tattered clothes and messy hair also looked in Ye Xuan’s direction.

Just by looking at this man’s face, one could tell that he was definitely full of stories. At this moment, the man moved slightly, which caused the chains to make a strange sound, which sounded jarring in this dead silent environment.”

“I’ve already forgotten how many years have passed, since I last saw a living cultivator.”

Ye Xuan frowned and looked at the person in front of him. He could sense an extreme indifference from this person, as if nothing could pique his interest.

“Who exactly are you?”

Ye Xuan could not help but ask. After hearing this question, the man raised his head to look at the blood moon in the sky and replied with a bitter expression, “Haha, I’ve been trapped here for too long. Even if you ask me who I am, I’ve already forgotten. ”

“I vaguely remember that others called me the Forbidden Lord.”

As soon as he finished speaking, the man instantly released an extremely terrifying aura, causing Ye Xuan’s heart to tremble uncontrollably. It was as if he was facing the Grim Reaper.

This person was ridiculously powerful!

He could clearly sense that this person in front of him was much stronger than any opponent he had ever encountered.

However, what surprised Ye Xuan the most was why such a terrifying expert was imprisoned here.

Just how terrifying was the expert who imprisoned him here back then?

“Forbidden Lord?”

Ye Xuan’s brows furrowed slightly as he examined this person for clues. However, no matter how hard Ye Xuan tried, he realized that he could not see through this man at all. It was as if this person was wrapped in chaos and could not be touched.

“Indeed. Some people call me the Executioner, and some call me the Lord of the

Burial Ground. However, most people call me the Forbidden Lord.”

After saying this, he seemed to become immersed in his own memories. Perhaps it was because he had not spoken to anyone for too long, so he seemed unusually conversational at the moment.

In the end, Ye Xuan asked the question that was bothering him the most.

“For what reason were you imprisoned here?”

Hearing this, the Forbidden Lord seemed to sink into his memories, and scenes of the past flashed through his mind, making him feel extremely uncomfortable. He covered his head and kept shaking.

“That’s right. Why am I imprisoned here?”

“Why exactly?”

After a while, he seemed to have recalled something and said, “Young man, have you heard of the eternal tribulation?”

“Eternal tribulation?”

Ye Xuan was dumbfounded by this reply. After all, this was the first time he had heard of this term.

“Yes, the Eternal tribulation, a calamity that appeared at the beginning of the

Great Chaos of the ancient era. This is also the root cause of the Dark Calamity.”

After saying this, the Forbidden Lord once again looked around him and said, “This place is also a forbidden zone. It was also my territory back then, and I’ll be stuck here forever.’

“I might forget some things, but how could I forget those dark days?”

The Forbidden Lord smiled sadly and did not continue, leaving Ye Xuan perplexed and confused.

“What exactly is the eternal tribulation you mentioned? Can you be more specific?”

However, the Forbidden Lord did not say anything. His eyes were fixed on Ye Xuan, revealing a profound look. Seeing this, Ye Xuan’s hair stood on end.

Why was this person staring at me like that?
