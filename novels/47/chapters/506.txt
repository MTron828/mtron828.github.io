507 Zhuge Yueyue Versus Xie Tianyu (Part 1)

In that instant, Xie Tianyu erupted with terrifying force.

“The void realm!”

When everyone saw this, their eyes were full of shock.

Even Mu Beichen was slightly surprised.

!!

“This guy is really a scoundrel. He even bullies little girls!”

Mu Beichen stretched lazily and turned his head, a playful smile on his lips.

“If you like to play so much, then I will play with you!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Mu Beichen was about to walk toward Xie Tianyu. However, he had just taken a step when he stopped involuntarily.

After Xie Tianyu’s void realm cultivation was revealed, Zhuge Yueyue’s expression did not change at all. Then, a similarly terrifying power burst forth.

“What? She has also broken through to the void realm…”

Mu Beichen was stunned.

When did this girl break through?

Was she not only a ninth-level materialization realm back at the Seven Peaks competition not too long ago?

‘Oh my god, Chief Ye Xuan is really generous. Did he give her the divine fruit?’

Mu Beichen’s heart was filled with envy as he thought of this. His entire body went numb.

What kind of f*cking great teacher was this?

“That’s good, I don’t need to intervene!”

Mu Beichen stopped in his tracks when he sensed Zhuge Yueyue’s aura.

“What? The void realm?”

Seeing this, Xie Tianyu frowned, and his expression turned serious.

He had thought that Zhuge Yueyue was only at the ninth level of the materialization realm, which would make her easy to deal with. However, things had changed now.

One had to know that these peerless geniuses who had been nurtured by the top holy lands since young had only just reached the void realm.

However, Zhuge Yueyue, who had only started cultivating several months ago, had caught up and reached the void realm!

How did this b*tch reach the void realm?

“This is really interesting. I have indeed underestimated you!”

Xie Tianyu narrowed his eyes.

Even if the other party was a void realm cultivator, he was still a peerless genius of the Supreme Divine sect. He was confident that he was unrivaled even in the same realm.

“Since we’re both void realm cultivators, I won’t be bullying you!”

“I’d like to see how strong the first disciple of the sword immortal is.”

As soon as he finished speaking, a long black saber appeared in Xie Tianyu’s hand.

At the same time, an extremely cold killing intent spread out.

Everyone’s pupils shrank when they saw this.

It was obvious that countless experts had met their end at the edge of this long saber. Otherwise, the saber would not exude such a dense murderous aura.

Seeing this, Zhuge Yueyue raised her eyelids.

Her storage ring flashed, and the Cloud Sky sword appeared in her right hand, emitting a cold and terrifying sword energy.

“The Supreme Divine sect? Sure, let’s exchange pointers then!”

Zhuge Yueyue slowly raised the Cloud Sky sword. The profound ice divine bone in her body released an extreme cold power and fused with the sword energy.

Behind Xie Tianyu, a black-robed Supreme Divine sect elder had a solemn look on his face.

‘I didn’t expect this girl to have a high-grade divine bone!’

‘Her talent is indeed not bad! However, Ye Xuan is known as a sword immortal, so I wonder how capable this first disciple of his is?’

The black-robed elder thought for a moment. He agreed with Xie Tianyu’s actions.

After all, he was also curious about Ye Xuan’s strength.

As Ye Xuan’s first disciple, Zhuge Yueyue should have inherited a lot of her teacher abilities. Perhaps he would be able to gauge Ye Xuan’s strength by extrapolating Zhuge Yueyue’s strength.

The Supreme Divine sect was an ancient sect that had existed for countless years. It had an extremely respected status in the entire East continent.

However, during this period of time, because of Ye Xuan, the fame of the Great Wilderness Divine sect had resounded all over the East Continuent, and even seemed to eclipse the other top holy lands.

If Xie Tianyu could defeat Zhuge Yueyue in front of everyone, it would undoubtedly suppress the reputation of the Great Wilderness Divine sect to a great extent. It would also be beneficial to the Supreme Divine sect’s influence. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

As for whether Xie Tianyu could win against Zhuge Yueyue, the black-robed elder had never considered this.

She was just a little girl whose name he had never heard of before. How could she be a match for the Saint of the Supreme Divine sect?

He had blind confidence in Xie Tianyu. Of course, this was due to the latter’s talent.

At this moment, Xie Tianyu slowly raised the long saber, then looked at Zhuge Yueyue, a playful smile on his face.

Even after Zhuge Yueyue revealed her strength as a void realm cultivator, he still took her lightly. From the beginning to the end, he had been extremely arrogant.

As the two sides confronted each other, the surrounding atmosphere suddenly became extremely tense.

The crowd of onlookers were all waiting for the show to start, and were also curious as to how strong Chief Ye Xuan’s first disciple was.

“She’s the first disciple of a sword immortal, so she shouldn’t be weak, right?”

...

“Hahaha! One is the first disciple of the sword immortal, and the other is the Saint of the Supreme Divine sect. It seems like there’s going to be a good show!”

“However, I’m not optimistic about Zhuge Yueyue’s chances. After all, Xie Tianyu and Mu Beichen are both peerless geniuses. Their strength is unparalleled!”

Then, while everyone was discussing, the battle began.

Xie Tianyu’s long saber exuded black light, and a terrifying evil energy that seemed to devour everything around it swept out.

When Zhuge Yueyue saw this, her expression did not show any signs of panic.

With just a slight tilt of her body, she easily dodged the terrifying black saber slash.
