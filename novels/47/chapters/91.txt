Chapter 92: One Sword Strike

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

However, although he could admit that he was inferior to Ye Xuan, he would never admit that he was inferior to his disciples.

‘No matter how monstrous Ye Xuan’s disciples’ talent is, at the very least, they are currently inferior to me!’

‘Hmph! There is no absolute fairness in this world. Later, I will defeat them one by one. At that time, I will see what these disciples of the Qingyun sect have to say!’

The eldest disciple of the Divine Mountain sect could only console himself inwardly like this. Only then did his expression take a turn for the better.

However, now that his fight had already ended, he would have to wait until the second elimination round of the competition to see if he would face Yue or Li Qingyan.

During this period, Yue and Li Qingyan also welcomed their opponents.

Everyone’s gazes fell on the two beautiful women. They could not help but scream in excitement.

When the two women defeated their opponents with just one sword strike, many of the disciples of the Qingyun sect jumped up in excitement.

“Senior Sister Li! Senior Sister Li!”

“Senior Sister Yue! Senior Sister Yue!”

At this moment, the crowd’s screams resounded throughout Qingyun Mountain.

“Their strength is indeed formidable. I had not expected the stories of the Qingyun sect disciples to be true!”

The cultivators of the Huolie and Shenshan sects were shocked when they saw this.

Yue and Li Qingyan were as powerful as the rumors said! Moreover, the two girls’ opponents were too weak, so they had not even revealed their true strength.

Therefore, the true cultivation level of these two girls was still unknown.

“It’s really strange. What kind of secret technique are they using? Why can it block our spiritual sense probing?”

Seeing this, the elders in the audience frowned.

Up until now, they still could not figure out Li Qingyan and Yue’s cultivation levels.

Normally, cultivators could indeed use secret techniques to conceal their cultivation. However, during a battle, once they started channeling their spiritual power to use martial techniques, they would no longer be able to conceal their cultivation.

However, what shocked them was that their spiritual senses were still unable to sense Yue and Li Qingyan’s cultivation levels while they fought their opponents.

In other words, unless the two women took the initiative to expose their cultivation levels voluntarily, no one would be able to figure out their level of strength.

It seemed that Ye Xuan had imparted a high-level secret technique to these two women.

“These two girls are really extremely lucky to have been able to meet such a good teacher like Ye Xuan!”

For a moment, the elders of the Huolie and Shenshan sects all revealed looks of envy!

A secret technique that could conceal one’s cultivation was already extremely rare, let alone a secret technique that could conceal one’s cultivation while fighting.

With this, unless they voluntarily revealed their strength, their enemies would never be able to figure out their level of strength. This was truly a powerful advantage to have in the cultivation world!

Moreover, if these elders were to ask themselves, if they had such a secret technique, would they be willing to teach it to their disciples?

No!

At the very least, they would have to set many tests for their disciples to pass and gain their trust before considering whether to teach them the technique or not.

Did Ye Xuan not value this secret technique, or did he trust these two girls that much?

Yue and Li Qingyan did not know what the elders were thinking, but even if they knew, they would only smile. Was this secret technique all that great?

Their teacher had taught them far more than this. Moreover, every single thing he taught or gave them was extremely precious. How could these elders imagine such a thing?

Their teacher’s kindness would forever be hidden in their hearts.

Moreover, Yue and Li Qingyan knew very well that even if they spent their entire lives trying, they probably would not be able to repay their teacher’s kindness.

Time passed slowly. Very quickly, the competition between the three great sects reached a crucial stage.

Moreover, each and every match that Yue and Li Qingyan partook in made the audience feel more and more shocked. Their eyes seemed to have been permanently widened in shock.

No matter what kind of opponent they met, they were all defeated with a single blow!

Sixth level of the true essence realm, one sword strike!

Seventh level of the true essence realm, one sword strike!

Even the eldest disciple of the Huolie sect, an expert who had reached the tenth level of the true essence realm, was also instantly defeated by Yue’s single sword strike.

When everyone saw this scene unfold, their eyes nearly popped out of their sockets.

What did it mean to be able to defeat a tenth-level true essence realm expert with one sword strike? It meant that Yue’s strength had already reached the purple spirit realm.

Were you sure that she was only at the sixth level of the true essence realm before? Could a sixth-level true essence realm cultivator do this?

All of a sudden, many cultivators had strange expressions on their faces.

At this moment, the competition had reached the top semifinals.

Li Qingyan was up against the eldest disciple of the Shenshan sect.

Boom!

The eldest disciple of the Shenshan sect cast a meaningful gaze at Li Qingyan, and his purple spirit realm aura revealed itself.

Boom!

Li Qingyan also did not choose to continue hiding her cultivation. The longsword in her hand vibrated, and the terrifying power of her second-level purple spirit realm cultivation swept out.

In addition, the dual-spirit physique in Li Qingyan’s body also exploded with power. One of her eyes was fiery red, and the other one was a lively green.

“Purple spirit realm!”

“And it’s the second level of the purple spirit realm too!”

When the first elder of the Shenshan sect saw this scene, he stood up with a face full of shock, and his eyes were transfixed on Li Qingyan.

When the others saw this, they were also beside themselves in shock and disbelief.

The elders of the Shenshan sect were dumbfounded, and so were the elders of the Huolie sect. The sect leader of the Qingyun sect and the other elders’ mouths were wide open, and they were petrified!

Purple spirit realm!

The second level of the purple spirit realm! At the age of 18!

How could this be?! Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Wasn’t she supposed to be at the ninth level of the true essence realm?”

Chen Xiaofeng’s expression changed drastically. He stood on the spot as if he had been struck by lightning.

When the eldest disciple of the Shenshan sect saw this, his expression also changed drastically.

‘Didn’t the information say that this woman was only at the ninth level of the true essence realm? What was with her current second-level purple spirit realm cultivation?’

‘She had broken through to the purple spirit realm at the age of 17? When had it become so easy to reach the purple spirit realm? Back then, I had to use all of my strength to barely break through to the purple spirit realm. Why was there such a huge difference between us?’

Although his heart was filled with shock, the purple spiritual power in his body still swept out!

The reason for this was none other than that the fight had already begun.

The storage ring in his hand flashed with light, and an incomparably sharp saber suddenly appeared in his hand.

Faced with a powerful second-level purple spirit realm cultivator, he had to go all out if he hoped to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat!

Swoosh!

The eldest disciple of the Shenshan sect was as fast as lightning. His sharp saber was suffused with a terrifying purple spiritual power. The purple spirit realm aura that erupted from him made everyone’s heart tremble.

Was this the true strength of a purple spirit realm cultivator?

This person probably had not even used one-tenth of his strength when he defeated Chen Xiaofeng earlier!
