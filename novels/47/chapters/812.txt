813 Long-Term Coma

Especially those who did not pass the first round of assessments. The increase in quota would mean that they would have a second chance at joining the sect.

After all, the sect was now the undisputed number one in everyone’s minds right now, which was further strengthened by the fact that Ye Xuan was the East continent’s only sealed immortal realm expert.

His reputation alone would bring people from far and wide.

After Ao Lei announced the news, the people on Sky Mountain began to cheer and shout. Seeing this, the disciples of the Great Wilderness Divine sect felt rather proud.

“Hahaha, it’s a good thing I chose to join the Great Wilderness Divine sect at that time. It truly was a wise move.”

“Dad, mom, hurry up and take a look. Are you proud of me now? I became a disciple of the best sect in the East continent!”

The elders watch all of this happen with satisfied gazes. It seemed that they would have an excellent harvest of disciples this year.

According to the tradition of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, only the chiefs of the seven mountain peaks could recruit disciples, followed by the elders of the sect. As elders, they were always left to choose from those with mediocre talents. At times, they really could not bear to accept them, so they chose not to accept disciples.

However, with the pool of potential disciples being so large, there was a good chance that talented cultivators would slip through the cracks. This was an excellent opportunity to recruit disciples! Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

After this battle came to an end, so did the crisis on Sky Mountain. Gao Shun smiled happily at this moment, and then he turned to look at the disciples of Hidden Sword peak and shouted loudly, “What are you still doing? Hurry up and go collect the treasures!”

After hearing this hint, everyone immediately came back to their senses. The plains outside were already filled with all kinds of precious bones and treasures. If they did not pick them up now, others would benefit!

Gao Shun was still the most reliable. While everyone was still thinking about how to take in one or two genius disciples tomorrow, he was capitalizing on the situation to increase his peak’s treasury.

“F*ck!”

Hearing Gao Shun’s reminder, everyone became anxious and rushed out without hesitation, searching for traces of heavenly treasures and precious bones.

The number of berserk beasts that had fallen, so with a little luck, it would be easy to find a precious bone. This was a good time to store cultivation resources, so Hua Rufeng led the disciples of the sect out of the defensive formation to search for treasures.

The scene was bustling, almost as if it was a festival.

Back at the sect, Ye Xuan had arrived back on Cloud Sky peak with his three disciples. In Cloud Sky Hall, Ye Xuan examined Xiang Yun, who was still unconscious, and began to worry.

“Teacher, what happened to Third Sister?”

Zhuge Yueyue asked worriedly. The seal on Xiang Yun had loosened several times in a row, and it seemed to have a negative effect on her.

Initially, they did not take it to heart. After all, their teacher was still fighting, so they had no time to care about other things.

However, now that the danger was over, they realized that something was wrong.

Ye Xuan did not reply. Instead, he focused his attention on examining her. After some time, he finally said, “It’s not a big deal. The power in Xiang Yun’s body is still in the process of being awakened, but she can’t withstand it at the moment, so she fell into a coma.”

Ye Xuan waved his hand and replied, “I’m not sure yet. I’m afraid it might take five to six years, or even more than ten years, for her to awaken.”

“This…”

After hearing this answer, Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun were dumbfounded.

What kind of situation could cause someone to fall into a coma for more than ten years?

Ye Xuan immediately said, “It can’t be helped. Perhaps this is something she must experience. After all, this is related to the divine powers she cultivated before she reincarnated.”

“When she reaches a certain level, her body will automatically adapt to the power in her body. Even her potential will be greatly increased.”

In all honesty, Ye Xuan was deeply surprised. This youngest disciple of his had indeed surprised him many times.

In particular, the cultivation technique that this little girl cultivated in her previous life piqued Ye Xuan’s interest. What kind of Dao did she complete in order to break through to the sealed immortal realm?

Also, was this just the first time she reincarnated?

Thinking this, Ye Xuan was looking forward to what would happen when her strength returned to its peak.

“Don’t worry. All of this is beneficial to Xiang Yun.”

“I’ll bring her to the Cloud Sky Cave and seal her inside until she wakes up.”

Hearing Ye Xuan’s words, the two of them were no longer as nervous.

“Alright, you’ve been working hard these past few days. Go back and readjust yourselves.”

“The battle for the immortal path is about to arrive. You must also make sufficient preparations. I don’t expect you to defeat all of your opponents, but you must work hard and exhibit a performance worthy of your potential.”

After hearing this, Zhuge Yueyue said decisively, “Teacher, don’t worry. I will do my best and bring glory to Cloud Sky peak!”

Ye Xuan was very gratified after hearing this. His eldest disciple was steadfast and trustworthy. She never slacked off, and always made him proud. She was the disciple he was the least worried about.
