Chapter 102: Inviting The Ancestor To Die!

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Ye… Ye Xuan… Oh, no, I mean Senior Ye…”

“Please spare my life!”

Ming He’s face was pale as he begged for mercy in fear. He was no longer as arrogant as before.

He had finally understood why Ye Xuan was so terrifyingly strong.

Having witnessed that sword strike just now, he sensed that Ye Xuan had awakened an extremely tyrannical and terrifying physique. In addition to that, Ye Xuan also possessed terrifying sword intent that seemed like it could tear the world apart.

The most crucial thing was that Ye Xuan had not only reached the peak of the core formation realm, but had reached its limits as well.

As an old monster that had lived for hundreds of years, he naturally knew what this meant.

It meant that Ye Xuan had already condensed 108 complete blood-red strands that were now wrapped around his golden core. Only once he did this could he truly reach the limits of the core formation realm.

At the same time, it also meant that Ye Xuan could step into the unity realm at any time.

Unbelievably, Ye Xuan was currently at this step!

In comparison, the blood-red strands that were wrapped around his own golden core only numbered 39. The difference between him and Ye Xuan was akin to the difference between Heaven and Earth.

In other words, even if Ye Xuan did not use the Sword Overlord physique, and did not use his sword intent, and did not use the God-slaying Sword, he could still rely on his own cultivation level to kill Ming He.

Moreover, enhanced by these terrifying trump cards, Ye Xuan’s current strength had already reached the threshold of the unity realm.

However, the only response Ming He received was Ye Xuan’s indifferent sword strike.

“I, Ye Xuan, hereby invite the Patriarch of the Xuanyin sect to die.”

Under this sword strike, the galaxy seemed to freeze, and a nine-star constellation descended!

“No!”

Seeing this, Ming He displayed a look of despair, and then his eyes became incomparably crazy. A scarlet and bloody stream of light suddenly burst out of his body, emanating a strange energy, and instantly coiled around Ye Xuan’s palm!

At the same time, the torrent of sword qi poured into Ming He’s body.

Ming He! A peak core formation realm expert had fallen!

“Huh?”

Seeing this, Ye Xuan could not help but frown.

He suddenly sensed an extremely strange energy penetrating his palm. Moreover, after entering his meridians, it frantically rushed toward his dantian.

“Get out!”

Seeing this, Ye Xuan’s eyes could not help but turn cold. The vast spiritual power in his dantian suddenly exploded, forcing out the strange blood-colored energy in a domineering manner.

However, what puzzled Ye Xuan was that even he could not determine what this blood-colored energy was at the moment, so he could only throw it into the storage space.

Whoosh! RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

After doing all this, Ye Xuan’s body turned into a stream of light and disappeared.

Soon, Ye Xuan returned to the Qingyun sect!

After sensing the aura left behind by the Xuanyin sect elders, he disappeared again!

A few seconds later, everyone saw a few incomparably resplendent torrents of sword qi torrents flashing in the distance!

A few seconds later, similar torrents of sword qi also flashed in another direction.

About five minutes later, Ye Xuan returned. With the God-slaying Sword in hand, he slowly flew back to Qingyun Mountain.

At this moment, the entire Qingyun sect turned silent!

The martial arts training ground, where tens of thousands of people were gathered, was so quiet that one could hear a pin drop.

Countless cultivators stood on the spot with blank expressions. Their faces were full of stupefaction, and their eyes were filled with disbelief and shock!

Everyone’s gaze fell on Ye Xuan, and the same thought popped up into their minds at the same time.

Elder Ye Xuan was too terrifying!

He was like an immortal in the mortal world, an invincible existence!

One person and one sword! All it took was one move to kill a core formation cultivator!

Ye Xuan!

He was only twenty years old, but had already reached the peak of the core formation realm. He had single-handedly destroyed the top experts of the Xuanyin sect.

The Shenshan sect elder could not help but stare with his eyes wide open. He gulped and trembled involuntarily. His heart was filled with uneasiness.

Elder Ye Xuan was so terrifying, and he and the Shenshan sect had chosen to abandon the Qingyun sect in their time of need. If the former wanted to settle the score with them, what could they do?

“Do you still have the jade token to activate the mountain guardian array formation?”

Suddenly, Ye Xuan’s voice broke the silence.

Although he had killed Ming He and the others, this matter was not over yet. He wanted to personally visit the headquarters of the Xuanyin sect and settle this matter once and for all!

Moreover, such a huge commotion would definitely attract the attention of the Great Qian royal family. Perhaps that old monster from the royal palace was already on his way to the Qingyun sect.

“No… it’s gone!”

At this moment, Wan Shanhai was still in a state of shock. However, when he heard Ye Xuan’s words, he replied subconsciously.

The jade token just now was the key to activate the mountain guardian array formation.

The Qingyun sect had previously produced an extremely powerful formation expert, and this mountain guardian array formation had been set up by him. At the same time, he had also left behind the jade token key.

The jade token contained a miniature mountain guardian array formation. As long as it was crushed, the miniature array formation would resonate with the Qingyun sect’s mountain guardian array formation and activate it.

However, refining the jade token was extremely difficult. Even the formation expert had only left behind three jade tokens. The previous two had already been used hundreds of years ago when the Qingyun sect had gone through a calamity.

The one that was crushed by Wan Shanhai just now had been the last one.

“Okay!”

Ye Xuan nodded and did not say anything further.

“Ye Xuan… that ancestor Ming He… is he…?” Wan Shanhai looked at Ye Xuan and asked with some anticipation in his heart.

“That person no longer exists in this world!”

Ye Xuan said with a calm expression, as if he was talking about a small matter.

“What? He… he died?”

Although everyone was secretly hoping for it, when Ye Xuan said it himself, they were still shocked.

Ming He was a peak core formation realm expert!

Even within the Great Qian Dynasty, he was one of the strongest and most terrifying experts!

Not much time had passed either, yet Ye Xuan had somehow killed him just like that?

The two were supposedly at the same level, so why was the distance between them so great?

Wan Shanhai and the elders were stunned senseless, and many disciples of the Qingyun sect stared at Ye Xuan with awe-filled eyes. Their admiration for the latter had reached new heights.

At this moment, in their hearts, Ye Xuan was like an immortal descending to the mortal world. He was an absolutely invincible existence!

Ye Xuan ignored the expressions and reactions of the crowd. Instead, he rubbed his chin and pondered for a moment.

He had planned to head directly over to the Xuanyin sect and wipe out l the remaining people. However, it was very likely that when he left the Qingyun sect, the people from the Great Qian royal family would come over.

After all, there were 17 top-notch core formation realm cultivators who had died at his hands. The Great Qian royal family would definitely not take this matter lightly.
