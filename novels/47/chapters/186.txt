Chapter 187: The Destruction Of The Moon Demon Holy Land

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

All living things in the world had their own karma, and there was an invisible thread tied to them. As the saying goes, the cycle of karma was endless, and everything in the world was governed by karma.

The power of karma bound the past, present, and future of people.

If one could comprehend the power of karma, one could predict the future of living things in the world to a certain extent.

Although the power of karma did not possess strong offensive power, if one successfully comprehended karmic intent, one could interfere with the other party’s karmic fate. At the highest level, one could even cross the long river of time and space and sever the other party’s fate.

“So, the power of karma also belongs to that almighty expert?” Ye Xuan asked.

However, to Ye Xuan’s surprise, the red-armored man smiled and shook his head.

“Although that almighty expert’s strength is terrifying, it hasn’t reached the point of comprehending karmic intent yet!”

“However, that almighty expert’s artifact contained the law of karma, and it is precisely because of this that the Tower of Heaven is suffused with a portion of the power of karma!”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan’s eyes immediately narrowed.

The power of karma was indeed the most terrifying power in the world. The Tower of Heaven was only slightly tainted with the power of karma of that almighty expert’s artifact, yet it allowed the Tower of Heaven to discern every participants’ origins.

Then, Ye Xuan asked him some more questions. At the same time, he also learned some secrets about the mystic realm.

The Moon Demon mystic realm was actually the core of the Moon Demon Holy Land 200,000 years ago. It contained a space independent of the outside world and was extremely vast.

Unfortunately, the current Moon Demon mystic realm was incomplete. The complete Moon Demon mystic realm was at least 10 times larger.

200,000 years ago, the Moon Demon Holy Land encountered a crisis of extermination. Even the extremely tough mystic realm was shattered, and now only one-tenth of it remained.

As for the Moon Demon Holy Land itself, it was directly destroyed.

The red-armored man in front of Ye Xuan was the former master of the Moon Demon Holy Land.

Unfortunately, this person had long died. What remained in the Tower of Heaven was only a wisp of his remnant will.

Moreover, due to the 200,000-year gap, the memory of this remnant will was incomplete, so it could not explain too many details.

However, Ye Xuan basically understood that the earth-shattering battle back then was extremely terrifying. Even a force as powerful as the Moon Demon Holy Land was only a middling force!

The real protagonist of that earth-shattering battle was that almighty expert that the red-armored man had mentioned. Unfortunately, that almighty expert had also fallen.

Then, Ye Xuan asked the red-armored man another question.

After clearing the Tower of Heaven, could he now control the Moon Demon mystic realm?

However, the red-armored man shook his head regretfully. Under normal circumstances, if Ye Xuan had successfully cleared the Tower of Heaven, he should have gained control of the Moon Demon mystic realm.

Unfortunately, the most important world heart of the mystic realm had been shattered in that great battle. Now, no one could refine the mystic realm, so how could it be controlled?

It was precisely because of this that the mystic realm floated in the turbulence of space. The first place it appeared was Yuancang Region, and then it drifted to other parts of the continent. Currently, it was located in the Nanzhou Region.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan did not feel too much regret. He then asked the red-armored man if he could refine the Tower of Heaven.

Hearing this, the red-armored man looked at Ye Xuan with a strange expression.

Was this guy not too greedy? One moment he wanted to control the mystic realm, the next moment he wanted to control the Tower of Heaven!

“You… have the right!”

The red-armored man was silent for a moment before he slowly said.

Hearing this, Ye Xuan’s eyes could not help but light up.

Although he himself did not care much about the Tower of Heaven, it contained karmic and spatial intents, which was the greatest temptation in itself.

As long as he could successfully refine the Tower of Heaven, he could comprehend karmic and spatial intents at any time.

As long as he could comprehend any one of them, it would greatly increase his own strength.

Most importantly, he could also give the Tower of Heaven to his disciple, thus obtaining a reward from the system.

“But if you take away the Tower of Heaven, you will also have to bear the power of karma of the Tower of Heaven itself!”

The red-armored man looked at Ye Xuan and said slowly.

Originally, as a remnant will, he could not be bothered to explain this much, but the talent that Ye Xuan displayed really surprised him.

At the age of 20, he had already reached the second level of the unity realm, and could even unleash power that surpassed the fourth level of the unity realm. Most importantly, this guy had even comprehended the legendary supreme intent of heavenly lightning!

With Ye Xuan’s current talent, his future achievements would definitely far surpass his. Perhaps he could reach the realm that the almighty expert had hoped for.

If that was the case, what was a mere Tower of Heaven?

Of course, if Ye Xuan took away the Tower of Heaven, he would naturally have to bear the power of karma of the tower itself.

As for the real consequences, the red-armored man was not sure, but it was definitely related to the destruction of the Moon Demon Holy Land and the existence of that almighty expert.

“The power of karma of the Tower of Heaven? Could it be related to the existence that destroyed the Moon Demon Holy Land?” Ye Xuan asked.

The red-armored man looked deeply at Ye Xuan, and then nodded with a solemn expression.

“If I refine the Tower of Heaven, will the other party be able to find me through the power of karma?” Ye Xuan asked with a solemn expression.

If the other party’s strength had reached a terrifying level, they might be able to find him through the karmic threads.

“No! Although they are terrifyingly strong, they aren’t heaven-defying!”

“Karmic intent can be said to be the most mysterious and supreme intent. It’s impossible for them to comprehend it! Don’t worry!”

“However, although they are unable to find your traces through the karmic threads, once you refine the Tower of Heaven, you will definitely shoulder with the karma of the Tower of Heaven!”

“In other words, you would have chosen to stand on the side of the Moon Demon Holy Land. In the future, you may very well face an enemy that you cannot defeat!”

“If that’s the case, will you still choose to take the Tower of Heaven away?”

The red-armored man looked straight at Ye Xuan.

The meaning he was expressing was very obvious. Although he was only a remnant will at the moment, he was still the master of the Tower of Heaven. Naturally, he could help Ye Xuan refine the Tower of Heaven.

As for whether or not to refine the Tower of Heaven, it was all up to Ye Xuan to decide.

If Ye Xuan chose to refine it, he would definitely have to face the existence that destroyed the Moon Demon Holy Land in the future!
