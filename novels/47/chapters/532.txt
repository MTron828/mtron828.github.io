533 The Reappearance Of The Heaven Devouring Divine Sparrow

“Thank you, Senior Brother. You’re so kind.”

Yanran accepted the gift from Ye Xuan without hesitation.

After all, this mammoth cauldron had belonged to her from the beginning. It was only due to that unfortunate encounter with the heaven devouring divine sparrow that Ouyang Xiu had managed to snatch it from her.

She also believed that she would have beaten Ouyang Xiu eventually. Still, being given a gift like this was pleasing and comforting. It made her a little happy.

After hesitating for a while, she finally said shyly, “Um… Why don’t you just call me Junior Sister in the future?”

After saying this, Yanran immediately regretted it.

She had only heard him call her senior sister once or twice.

Why was happiness so fleeting?

Still, she had to admit that Ye Xuan’s strength did qualify him to be her senior brother.

At this moment, Ye Xuan almost burst out laughing when he saw Yanran’s embarrassed expression.

It was really too funny. How could Yanran be both cold and silly?

She no longer seemed like that cold and aloof person he had seen at the beginning, but rather like an innocent girl.

“Hehe, alright. I’ll call you Junior Sister from now on.”

Ye Xuan could not hold back the smile on his face as he watched her grit her teeth, frustrated and helpless.

Seeing this, Yanran immediately turned her back to Ye Xuan angrily, but from time to time, she would still quietly turn around to glance at him.

“Ding! As you have given Yanran the mammoth cauldron, you have obtained a randomized 10,000x critical reward!”

‘Eh? It really happened?!’

Ye Xuan was extremely excited. He did not have much hope of receiving a reward at first, but he really did get it.

The system considered Yanran as part of the sect, even though her branch of the sect was from a different continent.

The system was truly awesome!

‘System, can you explain to me why this is happening?’ Ye Xuan asked the system out of curiosity.

“Host, although your two sects are not located within the same continent, the inheritances, legacies and cultivation techniques of the two sects are of similar origin. As long as that is the case, the system will recognize the other party as a member of your sect.” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

‘Oh, so that’s the reason.’

Hehe, this reward made his efforts just now completely worthwhile.

“Host, do you want to receive the reward immediately?”

‘Alright,’ Ye Xuan replied. He was extremely curious about the reward he would receive.

“Ding! Congratulations! The host has obtained the heaven-rank magic treasure, boundless cauldron.]

“Uh… A heaven-rank magic treasure?”

Ye Xuan was a little surprised by this. However, after taking a closer look at the effects of the boundless cauldron, Ye Xuan could not smile anymore.

“These effects really make me… speechless.”

The boundless cauldron was very powerful in terms of defense. Not only could it be used in battle, but it could also be used to make pills.

However, it had another function that made Ye Xuan extremely unhappy. When he encountered a strong enemy, Ye Xuan could use the boundless cauldron to escape.

The boundless cauldron seemed to be connected to the outside world, and the space inside was extremely vast.

When he was at his wit’s end, Ye Xuan could simply hide in the boundless cauldron and escape to safety.

However, Ye Xuan was a sword cultivator. When had he ever needed to run or escape?

To him, this was a disgraceful ability that he would never use.

‘Sigh, forget it. Let’s just take it first. After all, who knows what the future holds.’

After much hesitation, Ye Xuan smiled and put the boundless cauldron into his storage space.

Besides, after this trip was over, he wanted to return and teach his disciples how to refine medicinal pills. This cauldron came at just the right time.

In fact, there were many alchemy scrolls on Cloud Sky peak. However, the pills that were refined from those scrolls were of a very low level and were not very practical.

Even so, Ye Xuan was an existence that had the system. Even the most basic pills would be made useful thanks to the system’s rewards.

Thinking this, Ye Xuan’s mood instantly became brighter.

Boom!

At this moment, a loud explosion was heard, causing Yanran’s expression to change drastically.

She gazed into the horizon and frowned.

“Heaven devouring divine sparrow!”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan’s brows furrowed, and his eyes turned to follow her line of sight.

In the distance, he could see a huge bird with flames spurting out from its entire body, flying through the sky and absorbing the spiritual energy of its surroundings.

As it did so, its strength continued to rise, and it broke through to the middle stage of the supreme realm.

Ye Xuan was not afraid. On the contrary, he was very excited. The heaven devouring divine sparrow that he had been painstakingly tracking for a long time had finally shown its face.

There were three other powerful beasts that appeared together with it.

“Hahaha! I’ve finally found you!”

Ye Xuan’s face was beaming as he said this.

Yanran also looked at Ye Xuan at this moment because she could clearly sense Ye Xuan’s determination to kill the heaven devouring divine sparrow.

...

“Eh? Senior Brother, why do you value this heaven devouring divine sparrow so much?”

“It’s actually nothing much. It’s just that my main purpose in coming here is for this heaven devouring divine sparrow,” Ye Xuan replied with a smile.

Yanran’s eyes were fixed on Ye Xuan, after which she said, “Let’s go then. We’ll join in the fun.”

As soon as she finished speaking, Yanran flew toward the heaven devouring divine sparrow. Ye Xuan also followed closely behind.

In the sky, the heaven devouring divine sparrow had already condensed a tornado using its powerful devouring power, using it to absorb even more spiritual energy to strengthen itself.

Not far away, the Pixiu and Zhuyan were no longer calm. Only the black tortoise with the bronze coffin on its back remained calm as it watched the scene unhurriedly.

After all, the black tortoise was stronger than the other three powerful beasts, so it was not afraid of the other three.

Shortly after, Yanran appeared on the scene, attracting the attention of all the cultivators present.

“How did the genius of the Heaven continent’s Great Wilderness Divine sect end up coming to this place?”

After seeing Yanran, an old man with a head full of white hair said with a cloying expression.

“Hehe, Old White-Brow, have you taken a fancy to that little girl?”

...

Not far away, another wretched old man spoke up.

At this moment, another old man in a white robe spoke.

“Old White-brow, this isn’t the territory of the Yin Yang Divine sect’s territory. You can’t be so presumptuous and snatch women as you please.”

“That girl belongs to the Great Wilderness Divine sect. If you’re not afraid of death, then go ahead and try.”

“If you anger Daoist Sun, I’m afraid you won’t be able to bear the consequences.”

After hearing these words, the white-browed old man was unconvinced.

“Tsk! I’ll do whatever I want. As long as I want to do something, I will do it. I’m not afraid of Daoist Sun!”

“So what if she’s a genius from the Great Wilderness Divine sect? I want her because she’s extraordinary!”

After saying this, the white-browed old man laughed evilly.
