785 Seven Monsters (Part 2)

The atmosphere instantly became even more solemn.

A withered tree was struck by lightning, crows scattered into the distance, seemingly heralding misfortune.

Everyone looked at the black fog in front of them in silence.

Five minutes later, the black fog finally reached the defensive formation, and a huge, strange monster emerged.

After this strange monster appeared, six other powerful auras appeared not far behind him.

At this moment, everyone’s jaws dropped in shock.

“Seven?”

Hovering in the sky, the seven strange monsters seemed to be looking down on everything below. Their powerful aura swept across the surroundings, pushing those with weaker willpower to the ground.

Everyone’s heartstrings were tightly strung, and they did not even dare to breathe loudly. Despair was creeping into their hearts.

Now that seven equally powerful strange monsters had suddenly appeared, what would happen? This was too much!

It seemed that the death of the strange monster earlier must have attracted the attention of these seven strange monsters.

After all, in the eyes of these seven strange monsters, the other cultivators here were not worth mentioning. With a gentle pinch, they could easily crush them to death.

Only Ye Xuan’s strength was worth their time.

“Are we really going to die tragically here?”

“Seven monsters… If two or three of them appeared, Ye Xuan might still have a chance, but there are seven of them…”

When they saw North Heavenly King, who was the closest to them, their bodies trembled and their faces turned pale. Just the mere presence of this strange monster incited fear in their hearts.

They seemed to have lost all hope. The joy of escaping disaster earlier ago had vanished into thin air.

At this moment, everyone could only focus all their hope on the white figure in the sky. Amidst the dense black fog, Ye Xuan’s body exuded a sharp Sword Dao aura, and was getting stronger and stronger. He was not cowed by these seven strange monsters at all.

“We have to have faith in Chief Ye Xuan. He can definitely defeat these monsters.”

“Right now, only Priest Ye can save us. The only thing we can do is cheer him on and pray for his success!”

At this moment, everyone’s emotions were roused once again.

Gao Shun flew over to Ye Xuan’s side and asked, “Junior Brother Ye, are you confident in your chances?”

Try your best?

After hearing this answer, Gao Shun’s heart sank.

How could he say such a thing?

He should have said, “Don’t worry. I’ve got this!”

This time, it was really over.

“Hahaha…”

After seeing Gao Shun’s flustered expression, Ye Xuan could not help but laugh out loud. Then, he turned his gaze to the strange monster in front of him.

Since the monster arrived, it had not said anything. It just stared at Ye Xuan coldly. Sensing its contempt, Ye Xuan was eager to beat it up and teach it a lesson.

This monster seemed to be exactly the same as the one earlier, arrogant and annoying.

After a long while, North Heavenly King finally spoke, “Were you the one that killed South Heavenly King?”

“South Heavenly King?”

Everyone was stunned, but after a while, they figured out that it was referring to the strange monster Ye Xuan had killed earlier.

In an instant, a powerful fiendish aura assaulted Ye Xuan, trying to force Ye Xuan to kneel.

The corners of Ye Xuan’s mouth curled up slightly. With a casual wave of his hand, he released an even more powerful aura, neutralizing the strange monster’s aura.

After seeing this, the seven strange monsters were shocked.

“Interesting… It seems that the one who killed South Heavenly King is a little strong, but that’s all,” North Heavenly King said to himself.

“Let’s see what happens after North Heavenly King attacks. If he is about to be killed, we will attack together and suppress him. This is the safest method,” another strange monster agreed.

“Alright…”

After hearing this, the other monsters agreed.

Turning around, Ye Xuan saw the hope-filled gazes of the people behind him, and smiled. It seemed that he had taken up the protagonist role. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Now, all he had to do was turn the situation around and make it a reality.

Perhaps this battle would be able to spur him on to break through to the sealed immortal realm, which would make it easier for him to deal with Mengyu.

“Look, Chief Ye Xuan is heading into battle!”

“There are millions of lives on the line. I hope Ye Xuan wins!”

Everyone prayed silently in their hearts, and some even shed tears.

Now, the only pillar of support was Ye Xuan. If Ye Xuan was defeated, death would be imminent.
