Chapter 221: The System’s Generous Rewards

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Yue was on the verge of reaching the core formation realm. After this breakthrough, she finally comprehended first-level sword intent.

“Teacher?”

When Yue looked at Ye Xuan, he seemed to be lost in his own thoughts. At this moment, he was distracted by the system’s notifications, of which there were three.

“Ding! As the host has helped his disciple increase her cultivation level by 460 days, the host has received a randomized 101x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained 46460 days’ worth of cultivation.”

“Ding! As the host has helped his disciple strengthen her Sword Jade body 8x, the host has received a randomized 3x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained a 24x increase in the host’s own Sword Dao constitution!”

“Ding! As the host has helped his disciple comprehend sword intent, the host has received a randomized 98x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has reached the seventh level of sword intent!”

These notifications completely stunned Ye Xuan.

The system rewards this time were so generous!

Previously, there were only two ways for Ye Xuan to obtain a cultivation boost reward from the system.

The first was by performing spiritual power infusion on his disciples.

The second was to help his disciples refine spiritual medicines or heavenly treasures. As long as it could improve their cultivation, he would also obtain the corresponding system reward.

Now, there was one additional way. As long as he helped his disciples strengthen their own special constitution, he would receive a cultivation boost reward from the system.

Of course, there were differences between these three methods.

The cultivation boost reward from the first method was based on Ye Xuan’s cultivation speed, while the cultivation boost reward from the second method was based on his disciples’ cultivation speed.

It seemed that the third method followed the same rules as the second. As such, Ye Xuan obtained 46460 days’ worth of cultivation based on Yue’s cultivation speed, which worked out to be around 120 years.

Given Yue’s talent, if she cultivated for more than 120 years, what cultivation level could reach?

Soon, Ye Xuan got the answer, as he started breaking through rapidly.

Sixth level of the unity realm!

Seventh level of the unity realm!

Eighth level of the unity realm!

Ninth level of the unity realm!

It finally stopped after Ye Xuan broke through to the ninth level of the unity realm.

“Something’s not right!”

Although Yue’s level of talent was extremely outstanding, given her current cultivation speed, even if she cultivated for 200 years, the system’s reward should not have been able to increase his cultivation by this much,

Moreover, Yue was only a purple spirit realm cultivator at the moment, so there was no way that her cultivation speed could compare to Ye Xuan’s.

However, Ye Xuan quickly figured out the reason.

A large chunk of this increase had to be attributed to the strengthening of his Sword Overlord body.

“Wait a second, eighth-level sword intent?”

Suddenly, Ye Xuan noticed something that made his eyes light up with excitement.

The system’s reward had pushed his sword intent to the seventh level. Then, the strengthening of his Sword Overlord body had given his sword intent another boost!

It was said that if a cultivator could cultivate their martial intent to the perfection stage, their strength would undergo a terrifying qualitative change.

Thinking of this, Ye Xuan’s heart was filled with anticipation.

If his sword intent reached the perfection stage, what kind of changes would it bring to his strength?

Ninth level of the unity realm!

Eighth-level sword intent!

His Sword Overlord body was also nearing the perfection stage.

His strength had unexpectedly undergone another huge change.

Ye Xuan could not hold back his excitement, and laughed out loud.

“Hahaha!”

Today could be said to be the day he received the most abundant system rewards.

“Yue, you really are Teacher’s lucky charm!”

He had the urge to hug her, but restrained himself. He had to maintain the demeanor of a proper teacher.

So three major forces of the Nanzhou Region were chasing him?

So what? Was it a big deal?

What was there to fear?

To a certain extent, he was itching for a fight.

Throughout the entire Nanzhou Region, the feat of a unity realm cultivator killing a pattern condensation realm expert had yet to be accomplished, right?

Perhaps I can become the first!

“Teacher, why are you so happy? What happened?”

Yue noticed the changes in Ye Xuan’s expression.

She had never seen her teacher so happy.

“Hahaha, I just thought of some happy things!” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Yue, you should focus on comprehending the soul condensation technique. You’ve broken through many levels, so you have to temper your spiritual sense to regain full control of your power,” Ye Xuan said with a smile.

“Got it, Teacher!”

Even Ye Xuan had to get back to cultivating. Otherwise, he would suffer from the same problems. Thus, he quickly down cross-legged and started cultivating the divine forging technique.

“Eh?”

Moments later, Ye Xuan’s tightly shut eyes suddenly opened, and a cold gleam flashed across his eyes.

“I didn’t expect these people to come so quickly!”
