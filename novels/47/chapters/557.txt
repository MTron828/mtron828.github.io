558 Crisis (Part 1)

Everyone present understood how deep the enmity between Ye Xuan and Elder Taiyin was.

When they heard Elder Taiyin’s words, it was obvious that he was going to target Zhuge Yueyue.

Zhuge Yueyue was well aware of this, but she did not back down, as Ye Xuan had instructed her never to lower her head to an enemy.

Feng Xiyun also stood up and shouted loudly, “Hey! Don’t forget me! I’m also from the Cloud Sky peak. I’m also Ye Xuan’s disciple!”

Seeing this show of solidarity, the onlookers engraved the name of Cloud Sky peak into their hearts.

At this moment, even though they were facing an enemy who could easily kill them in seconds, the two girls still chose to face it bravely.

“They are really admirable,” Mu Beichen muttered to himself not far away.

If he was in Zhuge Yueyue’s shoes, he would not have done such a thing. Instead, he would have chosen to disregard dignity to save his own life first.

Perhaps in Zhuge Yueyue’s heart, her teacher’s reputation was even more important than her own life.

“Hehe!”

Elder Taiyin laughed coldly and then said loudly, “Very good! Seeing that both of you are so anxious to see the king of hell, I’ll send you on your way!”

“Earlier, Ye Xuan humiliated me several times, but he’s not here today. Let me get some practice on you first and then deal with him.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Elder Taiyin launched an attack instantly. A majestic sword beam swept toward Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun.

Seeing this, Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun did not try to flee. They held hands and simply watched the attack approach.

After all, Elder Taiyin was a supreme realm expert. Any attempts to escape would be pointless.

At this critical moment, Gao Shun unleashed a full-powered sword strike, barely offsetting Elder Taiyin’s sword beam.

Yuelun did not watch idly. In a flash, she rushed over and pulled Ye Xuan’s two disciples away.

“Hurry up and leave!”

Gao Shun shouted as he fully activated the forbidden secret technique without hesitation.

After using this forbidden secret technique, Gao Shun would probably never be able to progress in his cultivation ever again.

Moreover, his current enemy was Elder Taiyin, who was a bona fide supreme realm expert. Even using this forbidden technique, he would probably end up dying.

Even so, he still chose to step up and buy time for the disciples.

Looking at this scene, the cultivators from the Great Wilderness Divine sect all had tears in their eyes. He was clearly willing to sacrifice himself for them.

“Martial Uncle Gao!”

Hua Rufeng shouted. He felt very helpless at this time.

As one of the earliest disciples of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, he was very familiar with Gao Shun.

However, today, he felt that his understanding of Gao Shun was really inadequate…

“Leave!”

When Gao Shun shouted again, all of the disciples did not hesitate and immediately turned to leave.

However, how could Mo Xuan Guan let these people escape?

At the beginning of the battle, the cultivators from the Great Wilderness Divine sect had already killed many of his sect’s disciples. Now was the best time to take revenge.

“Charge! Block them and don’t let them escape!”

“All of you! No matter which sect you are from, as long as you interfere in the matters between our two sects, you will become an enemy of the Immortal Divine sect!”

Mo Xuan Guan shouted aggressively and immediately launched an attack. He also targeted Hua Rufeng.

What was the point of killing ordinary disciples? Only by killing the sect’s geniuses would he derive a greater sense of achievement!

In the next moment, a sharp attack was launched at Hua Rufeng!

At the critical moment, Yuelun rushed forward and helped Hua Rufeng block the attack. Then, she looked at Li Dahai from afar and said, “Take these disciples and leave first!”

Li Dahai felt helpless when he heard that. However, he also understood that now was not the time to argue. After all, the disciples’ safety was paramount.

“Let’s go! We’ll take the ordinary disciples and leave!”

Li Dahai looked at the other chiefs and shouted. Then, he raised his spear and forced his way out, trying to cover the disciples’ escape route.

On the other side, Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun felt as if they had just brushed shoulders with the god of death. They had yet to recover from their shock.

Zhuge Yueyue’s mental state was still relatively good. It only took a moment for her to recover. She hurriedly pulled Feng Xiyun along and said, “Junior Sister, hurry up and leave with me.”

As soon as she finished speaking, Zhuge Yueyue immediately launched an attack. She took her junior sister and left with the other disciples.

However, because they were Ye Xuan’s disciples, no matter where they fled, they would be closely monitored by the people from the Immortal Divine sect. There was no way for them to hide.

“Stop them!”

Huang Daning shouted aggressively. They could only blame themselves for being Ye Xuan’s disciples. Today, they had to be the first ones to be killed! Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Damn it! No matter how many people you have, just watch me beat all of you up today,” Yuelun said in an overbearing manner. She launched an attack and instantly forced Huang Daning and the others to retreat. She looked like a heroine.

Thanks to her, almost all of the elders of the Immortal Divine sect were blocked, so they had no way to pursue Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun.

Seeing this, Mo Xuan Guan was furious.

“You damn witch! Let’s attack and kill her together!”

The battle began once again, and blood stained the ground.

“Haha, Gao Shun, you actually deluded yourself into thinking that you could stop me?”

Elder Taiyin burst into laughter, his tone full of disdain.

Thick black mist was released from his body, and the strange power was constantly invading his consciousness, making him even crazier and more bloodthirsty.
