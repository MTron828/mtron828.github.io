575 Godsword

After receiving the Godsaber from her teacher, Feng Xiyun held it in her hands and began to wave it around. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Ye Xuan looked at this scene with a smile and said, “This weapon is called the Godsaber, and it can be used to unleash an extremely powerful ability.”

“When we return to Cloud Sky peak, I’ll teach you how to use it.”

“With its help, your Hellfire technique will be able to display even more power, and your combat strength will definitely increase by several times.”

Feng Xiyun became excited and replied, “Teacher is the best.”

With the increase in her cultivation level, she had encountered more and more powerful cultivators and now understood the importance of having a good weapon.

From now on, she would no longer need to constantly be under the protection of her senior sister. She could not wait to try it out.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan was also very happy. Then, he took out two sets of flexible armor.

Of these two sets of armor, one was of the fire attribute, and the other was of the ice attribute. Ye Xuan had obtained them from the white-browed old man, and they were just right for his two disciples.

Even though these two sets of armors were not as strong as his rainbow robe, they were sufficient to use at their level.

“Take a set each. There’s no need to be polite.”

The two of them were stunned.

There was still more?

What was wrong with their teacher today?

Could it be that he had really become rich overnight and could not wait to give away all his treasures?

If outsiders were to see this scene, they would definitely be full of envy.

What kind of teacher would continuously give treasures to his disciples in the mystic world?

Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun did not hesitate anymore. They simply accepted it, as they had already thanked him too many times. What was important was that they did not let their teacher down in the future.

Feng Xiyun took the fire attribute armor and put it on, while Zhuge Yueyue chose the ice attribute armor.

At this moment, Zhuge Yueyue even felt that her trip to the ancient tomb was a waste. In the end, she obtained far more treasures from her teacher.

Her teacher’s care warmed her heart. She vowed to remember his kindness and generosity.

After giving out all the things he needed to give, he deemed his efforts a success. Ye Xuan looked at his two disciples and said, “Alright, there’s still plenty of time, so you two can go shopping together and buy whatever you want.”

“I will give you the day off today. You can go and do whatever you want.”

“Alright, Teacher, you’re the best,” the two of them quickly replied.

As soon as they said that, they walked out hand-in-hand, skipping toward the street.

Ever since they were accepted as Ye Xuan’s disciples, they had been fully focused on cultivation, and had not truly had the time to relax like this. Furthermore, with their teacher nearby, they could wander around the streets without any worries.

When he saw his two disciples walk out of the room, Ye Xuan immediately grinned from ear to ear because of the system notification that had rang out in his mind.

“Ding! As the host has given Feng Xiyun the Godsaber, the host has obtained a critical reward and received a Godsword (defective)!”

“Ah!”

The Godsaber had earned him a Godsword?

Ye Xuan was excited, and quickly examined it.

The moment he took it out, a shocking murderous aura hit him square in the face, and filled the room.

If it wasn’t for Ye Xuan’s timely control, Qingyang City would probably have descended into chaos from the outpouring of killing intent.

The Godsword’s origins were from ancient times. The killing intent it contained was far greater than the Cloud Heaven Sword.

Moreover, this sword was defective. If it could be repaired, would it not be a super powerful sword?

It seemed that he had struck gold both literally and figuratively today.

Ye Xuan’s eyes seemed to glow as he stared at the Godsword in his hand. He was so excited that he could not speak.

Even though the Godsword was badly damaged, he would not be fooled by its appearance.

If the Godsword was in peak condition, it would even surpass Ye Xuan’s Cloud Heaven Sword!

With it, he might even be able to resist a sealed immortal realm expert!

However, the downside was that it would not be easy to restore it to its peak state.

Furthermore, even if he could restore the Godsword to its peak state now, Ye Xuan did not have the strength to fully activate it, and would be drained after unleashing a single attack, if he even managed to activate it at all in the first place.

Then, another system notification rang out.

“Ding! As you have given the fire and ice-attribute flexible armors to your two disciples, you have obtained two critical rewards and have received a set of fire and ice flexible armors!”

This time, Ye Xuan did not get an amazing treasure like before. Even so, something that he considered lackluster would be something that countless others dreamed of.

If he were to put these up for auction later, he would probably be able to earn a tidy profit. However, after thinking about it, he decided to give these two to his disciples as well, and auction off the ones he had just given them.
