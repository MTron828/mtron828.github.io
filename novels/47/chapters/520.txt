Daoist Qing Feng was one of Elder Taiyin’s few remaining friends. With his help, the situation could be salvaged. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“So it’s Daoist Qing Feng! No wonder I sensed a terrifying aura from afar.”

“By the way, your strength has improved by leaps and bounds over the past few years. Even I can’t fathom it.”

Elder Taiyin immediately started to flatter him.

!!

“Hehe, you’re too kind, Fellow Daoist Taiyin. My cultivation is quite mediocre.”

“Moreover, you did not spare any effort to help me in the past. Seeing that you are in trouble today, I definitely have to lend you a hand.”

After saying that, Daoist Qing Feng immediately released his spiritual power, focusing the pressure of Elder Tongtian and Chu Tianba, making his stance clear.

After hearing these words, Elder Taiyin could not stop smiling. This friend of his really was quite reliable.

“Hahaha! Alright!”

Elder Taiyin’s laugh was unbridled, as if he had already won the battle.

On the other hand, Elder Tongtian’s brows furrowed slightly when he saw the sudden addition of a new opponent. He knew that this matter would not be easy to deal with.

“Elder Chu, I’m afraid we can’t avoid a fierce battle today.”

After saying that, Elder Tongtian took a deep breath. On the contrary, he was a little eager to try.

On the other hand, Chu Tianba’s expression remained unchanged as he coldly replied, “It’s no big deal. I have never shied away from a fight!”

“We haven’t fought side by side for years. Let’s fight to our heart’s content today!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Elder Tongtian unsheathed his sword without any hesitation and pointed it at the newcomer. He released a shocking aura.

“Qing Feng, you ambushed me in the past, so let’s settle the score today!”

At this point, Elder Tongtian no longer held back. He released his full strength and swung his sword.

In the blink of an eye, the blood-red sea began to churn, and the beasts within it fled in all directions.

Moments laterI, a giant sword beam surged toward Daoist Qing Feng.

Seeing, Daoist Qing Feng turned serious. He raised his saber and mobilized all of his spiritual power to resist the attack.

However, the power of Elder Tongtian’s attack was simply too shocking, and sent him flying. Then, a few moments later, the two collided again.

At the same time, Elder Taiyin’s gaze was fixed on Chu Tianba as he spoke fiercely, “Chu Tianba, this time, no one will come to your aid!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Elder Taiyin raised the Immortal Sword and swung it.

Chu Tianba was not flustered at all. His moves were calm and composed as he redirected Elder Taiyin’s attack.

This attack did not succeed. Chu Tianba then prepared for the next attack.

Unexpectedly, Elder Taiyin turned around in an instant and flew over to the top of the towering tree, snatching the divine fruit.

Upon seeing this, Chu Tianba was enraged.

“You stinky old man, put that thing down!”

Chu Tianba released an attack that even deformed space.

At this moment, Chu Tianba’s body started to emit green light, and above his head, an illusory green lotus blossomed.

“It’s the dark lotus secret technique!”

The people nearby shouted in surprise. This was a secret technique of the Jade Lake Divine sect.

Even if this secret technique was incomplete, the amount of power he could unleash had already reached an extremely terrifying level.

In the entire East continent, only the great desolation secret technique could compare to it.

After seeing Chu Tianba use this secret technique, even Eler Taiyin started to panic. However, Chu Tianba did not give him any time to react.

The next moment, the green lotus slammed into Elder Taiyin.

Boom!

A mountain not far away was razed to the ground.

“Heavens, this secret technique is really too strong!”

The onlookers were all dumbfounded. Seeing such a high level battle was extremely rare!

As the battle continued, the two of them once again unleashed their attacks, causing one mountain after another to collapse.

Even though Elder Taiyin was a half-step supreme realm expert, the dark lotus secret technique allowed Chu Tianba to go toe-to-toe with him.

However, with the passage of time, his lack of strength was also slowly revealed.

Elder Taiyin was gradually gaining the advantage. However, if he wanted to defeat Chu Tianba, he would have to exert a lot of time and effort.

“You stinky old man, you’ll regret your actions. Don’t blame me for being merciless!”

As soon as he said that, Elder Taiyin swung the Immortal Sword at the green lotus, and then plunged into the blood-red sea.

Moments later, a cloud of black mist spread out from the depths of the sea, exuding a mysterious and unfathomable feeling.

Chu Tianba quickly noticed that something was wrong and asked in shock.

“What…”

“Why do you have such a mysterious power?”

Chu Tianba was already scared out of his wits, because this power was the same strange power that had triggered the invasion of the berserk beasts.

Did this mean that the berserk beast invasion was the work of Elder Taiyin?

Otherwise, how could he wield this power?

...

“You damned old man Chu Tianba. I wanted to let you go, but you brought this upon yourself!”

After saying that, this strange power erupted, and Elder Taiyin’s eyes were gradually filled with black mist, which made him look very ferocious.

This strange power was his secret and his trump card. No one knew about this.

His lifespan was about to run out, and he still could not break through to the supreme realm. Back then, he was even prepared to die.

However, unexpectedly, he actually discovered this extremely strange power in a mystic realm.

At that time, without hope, he chose to use it…
