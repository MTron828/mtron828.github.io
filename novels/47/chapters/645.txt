646 Prelude (Part 2)

The stone sculptures in the square were the champions of past gatherings.

As the number of people at the foot of the mountain gradually increased, the place became noisier and noisier, and many people were discussing among each other.

After all, the mountaintop square was not open to the public before the gathering started, so they could only wait down here.

“Which genius do you think is most likely to emerge victorious?”

“I’m not sure, but I think Mu Beichen has a high chance of winning.”

“That’s where you’re wrong. It’s very likely that the reincarnation fairy has already obtained the power of her legacy. Her combat strength must have been greatly improved.”

“It’s because of this that I think she’s most likely to win.”

“Haha, so what if the reincarnation fairy is powerful? Don’t tell me that you think that the eldest disciple of a sword immortal is not powerful? Maybe she has the best chance of winning.”

Discussion was rife everywhere. Not long ago, many people present had already seen the powerful sword strike that Zhuge Yueyue had unleashed. She was truly worthy of being Ye Xuan’s disciple.

It seemed that Cloud Sky peak would always have a Sword Dao genius. It had been Chief Tian Xuan in the past, Ye Xuan in the present, and Zhuge Yueyue in the future.

In the past, Chief Tian Xuan had also emerged victorious at the gathering. As for Ye Xuan, although he did not have the opportunity to participate in the gathering, how could these people forget his title as a sword immortal?

This was something he had obtained by killing countless enemies.

Just as these people were discussing intensely, a figure appeared out of thin air. An extraordinary old cultivator in a white robe had led a group of people here.

“Is that Daoist Canghai?” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Everyone present was shocked.

After all, he was of the same generation as Chief Tian Xuan, and had even fought with him.

It was rumored that he had already passed away, but who could have expected that he was still alive and well?

After seeing Daoist Canghai, many people instantly understood why Elder Tongtian had dared to provoke Elder Taiyin openly.

With Daoist Canghai’s support, the Immortal Divine sect would never have dared to take things too far.

“Haha, this time we’re finally going to witness the rise of the next generation,” Elder Tongtian said as he cleared out an empty space and set up camp.

“Master, the gathering has not started. You should sit down and relax first.”

“Alright…”

Daoist Canghai sat down while Elder Tong Tian quickly brewed some tea, trying to please him.

Mu Beichen did not say much at this time. Instead, he stood quietly beside the Daoist Changhai.

At that moment, after Daoist Canghai took a sip of the tea, he sensed the arrival of someone’s aura.

When he focused his eyes, he saw another extraordinary old man appear in front of him. This person even brought his own table and chair and sat down.

After seeing the old man in front of him, Daoist Changhai smiled and did not say anything. Under the control of his spiritual power, the pot of hot tea flew up.

Seeing this, the other old man casually waved his hand and broke the pot.

However, what shocked everyone present was that even though the pot had been shattered, the tea inside did not spill at all. Instead, the tea still maintained the appearance of a pot.

“Is that the legendary will control of water?”

Water could carry a boat or capsize a boat. It was something that was difficult to control, but also contained all sorts of Dao insights.

If one could not calm their hearts completely, they would not be able to do this.

Seeing how Daoist Changhai was able to maintain the water’s shape so easily, and even pour a cup of tea for the old man opposite him, many people began to sigh and could not help but admire Daoist Canghai’s astonishing state of mind.

“Hehe, Daoist Canghai, we haven’t met for such a long time. I really didn’t expect your state of mind to have reached such a level.”

“You have my deepest admiration…”

The old man sitting in front of Daoist Canghai was not stingy with his praise. He then drank the tea.

Behind him, one figure after another appeared. They were the reincarnation fairy and her team from the Jade Lake Divine sect.

After finishing the tea, the old man continued, “What surprised me the most was that you’re still alive and well. I thought that I was the only one alive from that generation, but I was wrong.”

“Every time I look at this group of younglings, I can’t help but think back to our era and feel lonely.”

After hearing this, the Daoist Canghai did not speak. Instead, he looked at the Reincarnation Fairy who was standing behind the old man and then at Mu Beichen. Then, he smiled and said, “Daoist Xu Yun, back then, you and I lost to Chief Tian Xuan in this place…”

“I will remember this for the rest of my life. Looking back, hundreds of years have passed in a flash. At this time when the old and the new are replacing the old, there are even more geniuses. I don’t want to miss this opportunity.”

“What?”

After hearing what Daoist Canghai said, Daoist Xu Yun turned to look at Mu Beichen, who was standing behind the former, and his expression gradually changed…
