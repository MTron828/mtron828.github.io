714 Fate Energy Gift (Part 2)

“Ding! Congratulations! The host has received a 10,000x critical reward! The host has obtained 100 units of immortal-grade fate energy!]

Thank you readers!

‘Oh? There are actually grades for fate energy?’

Ye Xuan was stunned. After thinking for a moment, he finally figured it out. The density of the fate energy he had received from the system was simply incomparable to the one given out by the ancient realm.

This time, he had really profited greatly.

He rubbed Xiang Yun’s head and said, “I have fate energy too, so you don’t have to worry about it.”

After hearing this, those who were still watching waited with bated breath. Was Sword Immortal Ye going to show off again?

Moments later, the wind and clouds gathered above Ye Xuan, and a powerful aura swept out. Waves of golden light cascaded down upon Ye Xuan as the dense immortal-grade fate energy surrounded him.

“Heavens…”

“This… This fate energy is so dense. It’s not even on the same level as the one from earlier!”

“Is Ye Xuan really going to become the first sealed immortal realm expert in the East continent?”

Since ancient times, those that possessed large amounts of fate energy were destined to travel further than others on the path of cultivation. The density of the fate energy surrounding Ye Xuan was far more than anyone present had even seen around any other expert. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

If Ye Xuan could not become a peerless expert even with this, then it was his own fault.

Everyone did not know what to say.

How did the Great Wilderness Divine sect get so lucky as to recruit Ye Xuan? Those forces that were hesitating about establishing friendly relationships with the sect were now convinced.

Even if they did not ally themselves with the Great Wilderness Divine sect, they had to avoid becoming enemies at all costs. Ye Xuan alone was enough to deter any enemies.

“We have to think of a way to build a good relationship with the Great Wilderness Divine sect.”

“This is an opportunity that we definitely can’t miss. We have to grasp it well.”

At this moment, the forces present had already formed their own plans. They were all making plans to approach various chiefs of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, as well as those with influence.

“Hehe, it seems that our Great Wilderness Divine sect will have a peerless expert.”

Ao Lei chuckled. He could hardly suppress his excitement for the future of the Great Wilderness Divine sect.

“Whoa, Teacher’s fate energy is really amazing!”

Xiang Yun was extremely shocked. Was there anything that her teacher did not have?

Some people had started flying back to the peak to greet Ye Xuan, but he did not want to entertain them, so he said, “Senior Brother Ao, I’ll be bringing my disciples back first.”

“Alright, then let’s leave together.”

Ao Lei also felt that it was time to leave. However, Gao Shun thought differently. It was a good time for him to bluster and make connections. Without Ye Xuan around, he would be the one in the limelight.

Seeing Gao Shun like this, his disciples looked at each other, then tacitly agreed to leave together, leaving their teacher behind.

Yuelun also came over to Ye Xuan and said, “Junior Brother Ye, let’s go back together. The journey will be more lively that way.”

“Alright…” Ye Xuan agreed softly.

Therefore, the disciples of Cloud Sky peak and Water Sky peak left together.

“Junior Brother Ye, Cloud Sky peak is now really famous. It seems that the number of applicants to join Cloud Sky peak will far surpass the other peaks when the sect opens its doors for recruitment next time.”

“By the way, how many disciples are you going to take in?” Yuelun asked with great interest, her eyes filled with envy.

If her disciples could perform as well as Zhuge Yueyue, she would be able to wake up from her sleep smiling every day.

Then there was the curious case of Xiang Yun, who had somehow emerged as the champion of the gathering. This piece of news would definitely shock everyone in the East continent.

Given how extraordinary the current disciples and chief of Cloud Sky peak were, it would not be strange if many geniuses fought tooth and nail to join Cloud Sky peak to cultivate.

Ye Xuan stared at Yuelun and pondered for a moment. Should he take in a few more disciples? He had not made a decision on this matter yet.
