825 Suspicious

“If we don’t retaliate, won’t we be looked down upon?”

The little monkey’s mischievous act had already caused hatred to build between the two continents.

However, the little monkey did not know what was going on at all and was still playing happily.

After discovering this situation, Ye Xuan decided that he could no longer continue teaching this little monkey.

“Indeed, my guess was right. This little monkey really only knows how to stir up trouble.”

“Forget it, forget it. It’s better for me to leave.”

After pondering for a moment, Ye Xuan did not make a move to stop the little monkey’s actions. Instead, he quietly left the island.

After leaving the East Sea, Ye Xuan reverted to his original appearance. From now on, this identity of Daoist Ling might never appear again.

Ye Xuan was not afraid of the experts from that continent, which was the Xuan Continent. However, he did not want to be made a scapegoat for no reason.

Wu Kong would have to resolve his own problems. In any case, as a creature born from the laws of the world, Wu Kong would not die so easily.

“Hehe, stupid monkey, just watch how I deal with you!”

At this moment, a battle was about to start, which attracted the attention of everyone from the East continent and Xuan continent.

Many people were puzzled when they saw the monkey.

“Oh my god, could this monkey be the one from a month ago?”

On the square of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, the chiefs of the other peaks were standing there, looking up at the big monkey in the sky.

Gao Shun was puzzled.

Was this monkey not a herald of good luck? Why did he stir up trouble between the two continents the moment he showed his face?

Ao Lei stared at the big monkey, not knowing what to say.

“Cough cough… There might be other reasons for this.”

As he muttered to himself, he turned around and asked Zhuge Yuetue, “Martial Nephew Zhuge, has your teacher returned to Cloud Sky peak yet?”

Zhuge Yueyue waved her hand. Her teacher had left more than 30 days ago, and did not tell her where he was going, and had not returned yet.

“Speaking of which, could it be that this giant monkey was secretly taught by Junior Brother Ye?”

Gao Shun suddenly said this.

“Nah, that shouldn’t be the case. Junior Brother Ye isn’t so free that he would spend his time teaching a monkey.”

Everyone was in disbelief, thinking that such a thing could not be true at all.

“I was just making a wild guess,” Gao Shun said somewhat helplessly.

After 30-odd days, since there was no news of Ye Xuan, Gao Shun indeed found it very strange and wanted to know what he was up to.

Moreover, these two things seemed to coincide. Just a few days after this monkey appeared, Ye Xuan left the sect.

Just as people were discussing, a figure instantly appeared in front of the square. It was Ye Xuan.

“Teacher!”

Zhuge Yueyue ran forward happily.

Ye Xuan revealed a smile at this time. He looked at his obedient disciple and felt very gratified. Yueyue was much better than Wu Kong, who was a magnet for trouble.

Fortunately, Ye Xuan had escaped early. Otherwise, if he had been found out, the situation would probably not be good.

After seeing Ye Xuan appear, Gao Shun stared suspiciously at Ye Xuan and asked, “Junior Brother Ye, where have you been this past month?”

He still felt that there was something fishy about this.

Ye Xuan noticed Gao Shun’s doubtful gaze at this time and felt a little guilty.

Could it be that this fellow had already discovered it?

Seeing that Ye Xuan remained silent, Gao Shun followed up, “Junior Brother Ye, could it be that you taught this monkey his skills?”

After hearing this, everyone instantly looked over, waiting to hear Ye Xuan’s reply. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Hehe, Senior Brother Gao, how could such a thing happen?”

Ye Xuan did not forget to glance at Gao Shun as he spoke, which made the latter’s heart tremble.

At this moment, Ye Xuan immediately smiled and said, “A while ago, I suddenly had some inspiration, so I casually found a cave in the wilderness to cultivate in seclusion.”

Hearing this, everyone nodded. After all, they did not believe that what Gao Shun said was true earlier anyway.

Only 30 days had passed, and this monkey had already reached the middle stage of the heavenly realm. As long as the monkey was given more time, it would reach the mystic lord realm.

They also understood that Ye Xuan was indeed quite talented in teaching disciples, because the three disciples he had taken in were all top-notch.

However, no matter how good he was at teaching, 30 days to reach the heaven realm was absurd. It would take a miracle to cultivate that quickly.

Boom!

While people were still discussing this matter, the monkey was still fighting fiercely with the tiger. Even the sky was shaking from the shockwaves of the fight. The battle was very intense…
