920 Determination

Seeing such a young sealed immortal realm expert appear in the Mystic World, it was natural for Wan Tu to be shocked.

However, it was limited to just shock. He did not consider Ye Xuan a threat. After all, he had lived for such a long time, and had always survived despite constant pursuit.

Why would he be afraid of this young junior?

Ye Xuan’s lips curled up slightly as he said, ” You only need to know that I’m here to take your life.”

Hearing this, Wan Tu instantly laughed out loud.

“Hahaha! You’re too arrogant. Alright then. Show me just how you plan to do that!”

Ye Xuan’s face was all smiles, but killing intent was brewing within him. He had not wanted to bother with Wan Tu, but since this person had attacked Yanran, it was time for him to die.

“Don’t worry. I’ll show you in a bit.”

After saying this, Ye Xuan turned around to check on the battle behind him and continued, “Time is of the essence. Let’s see if I can finish you off in one move. If I don’t succeed, I’ll let you go.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan took out his Godsword, causing the entire sky to be dyed blood-red.

After seeing this sword, Wan Tu’s expression changed drastically. He immediately realized that the young man in front of him was not so easy to deal with.

“Damn it! Who exactly is this person? Why haven’t I heard of him before?”

Wan Tu was extremely nervous at this moment. After all, he still had the members of the Seal Divine sect behind him, and Ye Xuan was in front of him.

He was caught in a dilemma.

After seeing Ye Xuan stop King Wan Tu, the members of the Seal Divine sect were delighted. They had never expected someone to suddenly assist them.

Daoist Liu Feng immediately cupped his fists and said respectfully, “Thank you, Sword Immortal Ye! If we can kill Wan Tu today, our Seal Divine sect will forever be grateful.”

“In the future, if you encounter anything that requires our help, feel free to ask. As long as I, Liu Feng, can do it, I will definitely not refuse.”

Liu Feng said these words with a serious face. His expression was filled with determination.

In the past few hundred years, tens of thousands of people had died in pursuit of Wan Tu. This further cemented their grudge with him.

As long as Wan Tu was killed, they would do anything, even if it meant risking their lives.

Seeing this, Wan Tu began to panic. After thinking for a while, he looked at Ye Xuan and asked, “Are you going to stand on their side?”

“There’s no grudge between you and me. This is also a personal grudge between me and the Seal Divine sect, but you have nothing to do with them at all.”

There’s no need for you to help these useless things and stand against me, right?”

As he said this, Wan Tu was still looking for an opportunity to attack. He was not stupid. Even though he looked very flustered, if Ye Xuan dared to reveal even the slightest flaw, he would pounce on it.

How could Ye Xuan not understand this? This fellow just wanted to change the topic and divert his attention.

After laughing disdainfully, Ye Xuan pointed the Godsword at the sky, causing the killing intent around him to become more and more intense.

“Wan Tu, you are simply heartless. It is most appropriate to say that you are a vile beast, which is why you’ve been hunted for years. Anyone with a sense of justice knows this.”

“Today, even if we have to sacrifice all of our people in the Seal Divine sect, we must get rid of you!”

At this moment, a series of blood-boiling voices rang out from among the members of the Seal Divine sect. Many of their eyes were bloodshot. Over the years, they had lost fellow disciples, their own disciples, and even teachers to this man. As such, it did not matter if they threw their lives away, so long as this vile beast was killed. Who cared about the strength gap between them.

Hearing their words and seeing their determination, Ye Xuan felt moved.

It reminded him of the scene where the Great Wilderness Divine sect had stood against Mengyu.

“Hehehe, what a joke! With how weak you all are, what can you do to me?”

Wan Tu laughed out loud.

At this moment, Ye Xuan said coldly, “Is that so? What if I want to deal with you together with them?”

“This… Do you really want to become my enemy?”

After noticing that Ye Xuan’s killing intent had become even denser, Wan Tu’s expression changed drastically.

He could clearly sense that the sword move that Ye Xuan was about to unleash contained extremely terrifying energy, enough to threaten his life.

He did not want to fight this man, so he immediately said, “You look like a smart man, so why become my enemy for these weak ants?”

“If you do this, the two of us will end up fighting against each other, and then someone else will reap the benefits.”

“Think about it properly!”

Ye Xuan did not want to continue wasting time talking with him, so he said, “Can I take these words as your last words?”

As soon as he finished speaking, the Godsword immediately released waves of extremely terrifying killing intent, and a blood-colored crescent moon appeared in the sky.

“Oh my god… What is this move?”

At this moment, everyone turned to look at Ye Xuan.

Wan Tu’s face turned pale and powerless. He had already sensed how powerful Ye Xuan was. The arrogance he had at the beginning had long disappeared, and he was begging to feel fearful. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m
