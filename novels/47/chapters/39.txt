Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Ah...”

At this moment, a few more mournful screams rang out.

Of the entire Fengxuan Stronghold, only the commanders remained.

Yue’s snow-white clothes were already soaked in blood. Her slightly disheveled hair danced in the wind.

The next second, Yue slowly walked towards the third commander with the Qingyun sword in hand.

As a sharp sword light flashed past, the third commander’s head was separated from his body. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“I... I was wrong. I’m sorry. Please forgive me, okay?”

“I will definitely change in the future. I... I will definitely be a good person...”

The second commander saw Yue walking toward him step by step. His body trembled in fear. He was so scared that he lost control of his urinary system.

“Hehe, you can keep these words and tell them to those who died in hell!” Yue’s eyes were cold as she uttered the words that would seal his fate.

Back then, countless villagers had begged for mercy in front of the second commander, but did he give them a chance?

A sharp sword light flashed past, and the second commander’s head was also separated from his body.

......

Now, only the first commander, Baduluo, was left.

“Don’t... Don’t kill me... It... It was all his doing...”

Feeling the scythe of the grim reaper on his neck, Baduluo was completely flustered, and he ratted out Duan Wuyi without any hesitation.

“It’s all the Xuanyin sect’s doing! It’s all their doing!”

“Originally, we only wanted to seize some wealth, didn’t even think of killing you all. But this guy threatened our Fengxuan Stronghold. They told us that, if we didn’t act according to their instructions, that we would be the ones to die!”

“If it wasn’t for him, such a tragedy wouldn’t have befallen Lin Shi village. It’s all his fault. Right... right, his junior brother is still at our base. They are the main culprits behind the massacre of Lin Shi village!”

“Your true enemies should be them. I’m begging you! Please let me off!”

Baduluo’s face was filled with terror as he cried out.

Kacha!

Right at this moment, a terrifying bolt of lightning flashed in the sky and instantly lit up Baduluo’s face in the dark night.

There was a frightened expression on his face coupled with a desperate look in his eyes.

Hearing this, Duan Wuyi’s expression changed drastically.

“Don’t worry, I’ve already sent his junior brother to hell ahead of time. It’s time for you to accompany him!”

“I promise you that I’ll send him to hell as well!”

Yue looked at Baduluo icily.

“What? Junior Brother is dead?”

Hearing this, Duan Wuyi became increasingly flustered. His junior brother had already died. Did they come from the headquarters of the Fengxuan Stronghold just now?

They were cultivators from the Xuanyin sect. Were they not afraid of revenge?

At this moment, Duan Wuyi’s heart was filled with fear.

These guys even dared to kill his junior brother. In that case, there was no way they would let him go.

“Elder... Elder Ye Xuan, I’m Elder Li’s personal disciple. I still have his warrant with me!”

Duan Wuyi immediately panicked. He quickly took out his master’s warrant, hoping that the other party would spare his life for the sake of his master.

However, Ye Xuan ignored him.

Seeing this, Duan Wuyi fell into complete despair. It was obvious that Ye Xuan wanted to kill him.

“Ye Xuan, I’m a personal disciple of the Xuanyin sect. If you kill me, it will definitely cause a war between our two sects. Can you bear such a heavy responsibility?” Duan Wuyi threatened Ye Xuan out of desperation.

“Our Xuanyin sect is the second-ranked sect. Your Qingyun sect can’t afford to mess with us. If you really kill me, my master will not let you off!”

“When that happens, the Qingyun sect will be buried with you!”

Seeing that Ye Xuan was still acting indifferently, Duan Wuyi suddenly became hysterical. His face was full of madness.

“I... I don’t want to die!”

In the end, his fear of death overcame the anger in his heart. Duan Wuyi was like a dog, kneeling on the ground and begging Ye Xuan for mercy.

“Haha, do you think the death of a mere personal disciple like you will really cause a war between our sects? You think too highly of yourself!”

Ye Xuan looked at Duan Wuyi indifferently. He then reached out and gently made a grabbing motion.

A powerful invisible force immediately grabbed Duan Wuyi’s neck and lifted him up.

“Elder Ye Xuan, I’m begging you. Let me go. This was all my master’s doing... It’s all my master’s doing...”

“Oh right, don’t core formation state cultivators like you yearn for the power of qi and blood essence? I have bloodstones on me. As long as you let me go, I’ll give you the bloodstones...”

“And... and I can even take you to the sect’s senior and junior brothers and sisters. They also have bloodstones with them. As long as you let me go, I’ll tell you where they are!”

Duan Wuyi shouted with a fearful expression.

Compared to his own life, dignity was worth nothing. He would readily trade the lives of his fellow disciples, and even his master, for his own. As long as he could survive, all of this was not a problem.

In any case, when he returned to the sect, he could spin a different story.

At that time, Ye Xuan would face the wrath of the entire Xuanyin sect.

“A few days ago, I killed a cultivator of the Xuanyin sect in the mountain range. His appearance was similar to yours. You two are probably brothers, right?”

Ye Xuan looked at Duan Wuyi, who was being choked in mid-air, and could not help but reveal a wry smile.

Buzz!

Upon hearing this, Duan Wuyi’s mind felt like it had been struck by a thunderbolt.

“Wu... Wu Jie, you... you actually killed my brother?”

“Ye Xuan, I won’t let you off!”

Duan Wuyi screamed crazily, his eyes full of hatred.

Seeing this, a sneer hung on the corners of Ye Xuan’s mouth.

The reason he told Duan Wuyi about this was to completely infuriate him and to reveal his true colors. Would Ye Xuan let him live? Impossible!

“Ye Xuan, you will definitely suffer the revenge of the Xuanyin sect...”

“Ah... You and the Qingyun sect will be buried with my brother!”

Duan Wuyi revealed a crazed expression and roared hysterically.

However, in the face of absolute strength, all resistance was futile.

“Alright, enough of your nonsense. It’s time for you two brothers to be reunited. Don’t worry, I will send your beloved master and your whole sect down to join you very soon!”

Ye Xuan said indifferently, after which he activated the golden core power in his body.
