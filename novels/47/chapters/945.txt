946 Not Quite As Planned

This Nine-tailed Sparrow was indeed very beautiful, but Ye Xuan already had someone he liked; two of them actually, so he had no intention of adding to that number.

After hearing Ye Xuan’s words, the Nine-tailed Sparrow was a little disappointed. She had also noticed the interaction between Ye Xuan and Yanran just now, so it was not hard to put two and two together.

It felt like she had missed out.

When the Thunder-Devouring Beast heard Ye Xuan say those words, he immediately gave Ye Xuan a thumbs up. This was his moment!

At this moment, the Thunder-Devouring Beast’s face was filled with anticipation, as if it was eagerly waiting for the Nine-tailed Sparrow to thank him. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

After the Nine-tailed Sparrow looked at the Thunder-Devouring Beast, a strange feeling arose in her heart. Why did she feel that this Thunder-Devouring Beast was a little strange?

Could it be that she was wrong?

No matter what, this Thunder-Devouring Beast should be a top-notch expert too, right?

However, her sixth sense was telling her otherwise.

After thinking for a moment, she bowed to the Thunder-Devouring Beast and thanked it.

“Thank you, Sir, for saving my life. I am grateful for your kindness.”

The atmosphere immediately fell silent. It was not clear how much time had passed before the Thunder-Devouring Beast started to think foolishly, ‘Is she done? Was there no practical expression of thanks?’

Was she not playing by the rules?

Under normal circumstances, should she not have offered to do anything for him? Why were things different when it came to him?

Seeing the Thunder-Devouring Beast’s appearance, Ye Xuan could not hold it in anymore and laughed out loud.

There were indeed benefits to being handsome…

On the other hand, when the Nine-tailed Sparrow saw the Thunder-Devouring Beast acting suspiciously, she was also confused. What was he trying to do?

Could it be that the reason why he asked someone to save me just now was because he had bad intentions?

Her vigilance toward him instantly went up a few notches.

After realizing this, Ye Xuan kicked the Thunder-Devouring Beast’s heel.

He said, “Little Sister, I’m really sorry. This brother of mine has probably stayed in this palace for too long and can’t think straight, as you can see.”

After hearing Ye Xuan’s funny words, the Nine-tailed Sparrow covered her mouth and laughed, which made her look quite mesmerizing.

On the other hand, when he heard Ye Xuan say that, the Thunder-Devouring Beast wanted to retort, but Ye Xuan held his head down.

Seeing the two of them joking around, the Nine-tailed Sparrow was even more amused. In any case, she knew that they had saved her life, though she was indeed more grateful to Ye Xuan for having killed that disgusting flood dragon.

Compared to the Thunder-Devouring Beast’s relatively exaggerated and domineering appearance, which she felt was rather overdone, she liked Ye Xuan’s simple and unadorned appearance more.

Sadly, Ye Xuan was taken, and by a peerlessly beautiful woman too.

“Benefactor, I will always remember your grace and kindness. If you have time in the future, you can come to my clan for a visit. I will definitely welcome you warmly.”

Ye Xuan smiled in response, but then noticed that the Thunder-Devouring Beast’s eyes were filled with killing intent and sighed.

He could only say unhappily, “I’ll definitely go if I’m free in the future.”

“Alright, it’s a deal then.”

As soon as she finished speaking, a sweet smile appeared on her face. Then, she transformed into her Nine-tailed Sparrow form and spread her wings and soared away.

After seeing the Nine-tailed Sparrow leave, the Thunder-Devouring Beast could not hold it in anymore.

“Ohhh… Why is she leaving so already?”

The Thunder-Devouring Beast looked at Ye Xuan with an anguished expression.

“Big Brother, you said that you would help me find a beautiful partner, but why did you go and flirt with one yourself?”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan also felt very helpless. He waved his hand and said, “It seems like I didn’t do anything. Why are you blaming me for this?”

“I don’t care! Since you promised me, you have to help me think of a way.”

The Thunder-Devouring Beast was already starting to act petulant, and looked unhappy. It was rare to meet someone so beautiful. The Nine-tailed Sparrow had charmed his heart, but it was Ye Xuan who had charmed her heart.

It was really too tragic…

The Thunder-Devouring Beast actually understood that Ye Xuan had already tried his best to help him, but it seemed that he needed to do more than show off with words in order to present his case.

Perhaps if he had killed the flood dragon just now, perhaps the outcome would have been different. Unfortunately, he was too weak to accomplish that.

Ye Xuan thought for a moment and said, “Cough cough, Little Thunder, you don’t have to be too anxious. If you can’t get this one, then shift your focus to another one.”

“In this world, there are many beautiful women, but you must be strong enough if you want to attract a partner that you fancy.”

The Thunder-Devouring Beast was still a little suspicious.

“Are you sure you’re not lying to me?”

“When did I ever lie to you?”

The Thunder-Devouring Beast thought about it seriously. His big brother’s words were quite reliable, so he could only choose to trust him again.

“That’s fine too. The next one then!”

Ye Xuan thought that this fellow was quite amazing, as he overcame his heartbreak so easily. Quite the resilient, or perhaps fickle, mindset.

Seeing the Nine-tailed Sparrow fly away, he sighed.

However, when he turned around, he was shocked.

Unknowingly, Yanran was behind him, staring at him with a cold gaze…
