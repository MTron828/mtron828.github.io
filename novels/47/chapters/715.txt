716 Confession

Holding the pill in his hand, Ye Xuan stared at Yuelun with a serious expression. Yuelun lowered her head shyly.

Thank you readers!

“Senior Sister Yuelun, you’ve already reached the peak of the mystic lord realm, and will reach the supreme realm sooner or later.”

“There aren’t many things that I can help you with, but this pill should be able to speed up this process.”

Yuelun felt touched. Her gaze was still on the pill in Ye Xuan’s hand.

How could she not want this pill? However, how could she accept something this valuable?

Furthermore, she had just accepted the Chiliad Gold Vine seedling not long ago. Yuelun was already very grateful to him for this. If she was his disciple, there would be no problems with this, but their current relationship was ambiguous.

“Junior Brother Ye, thank you for your kind intentions, but I cannot accept this pill.”

After thinking for a long time, Yuelun still refused firmly.

She had to stay true to her beliefs. However, Ye Xuan would not let things end like this, and immediately started his performance.

His face fell, and he looked a little panicked.

“Senior Sister Yuelun, why are you so cruel? You actually rejected again. It really makes me so sad. Sigh…”

“I…”

After seeing Ye Xuan’s sorrowful expression, Yuelun’s heart trembled wildly. She felt somewhat at a loss and did not know what to say.

“Senior Sister, I’ve wanted to say something to you for a long time, but I was afraid that you wouldn’t feel the same way. That’s why I’ve been burying this feeling in my heart until now…”

“Uh… Huh? What do you mean? Some things should just be said out loud instead of being bottled up,” Yuelun quickly interjected. Was Ye Xuan really going to say the words she was hoping to hear?

At this moment, Ye Xuan’s brain was already overclocking itself as he tried to come up with a touching confession. His expression seemed slightly shy, but he spoke with sincerity.

“Senior Sister Yuelun, I won’t lie to you. I originally thought that being alone was the best, but after seeing you, my thoughts have changed.”

“I want to stay by your side until we grow old. Perhaps this is love at first sight. Ever since I saw you, my world has been filled with color…”

After hearing this, Yuelun began to tremble. She felt weak and almost fell to the ground.

Heavens! Were Ye Xuan’s words really sincere? Had she really managed to worm her way into his heart?

Yuelun could not hold herself back any more after hearing those words, and spoke her mind.

“Alright, Junior Brother, there’s no need to continue… Actually… Actually, I like you too.”

The confession had worked!

At this moment, Yuelun even wondered if she was dreaming. Although she had dreamed about this happening, she had thought that he was only interested in flirting with and teasing her.

“Ding! Congratulations! The host has successfully bound a new partner, Yuelun!”

After hearing this notification, Ye Xuan almost jumped up in surprise. He felt that his words had been too corny, and he had wanted to continue with something less tacky.

However, it seemed that his sugary sweet words had done the trick! L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

However, what made him feel somewhat regretful was he was not awarded a free lottery draw like the last time. Still, he now had a new target to obtain critical rewards from.

After all, Yanran was still in the Heaven continent, so even if he wanted to give her stuff, he could not.

In Ye Xuan’s storage pouch, there were still many treasures and pills. Soon, he would set aside a portion for her, and perhaps even refine a few more. Then, he would be able to reap bountiful rewards!

He could hardly wait…

Hehe…

He quickly calmed himself down. After all, he was still in the middle of his confession. Shock instantly appeared on Ye Xuan’s face, as well as a little panic.

“Senior Sister Yuelun, are you sure you’re not joking with me? Do you really like me?”

Yuelun’s face instantly turned red. She felt a little embarrassed. After looking around, she realized that the other disciples were still some distance away.

Phew!

“How could I joke with you about such a thing?”

At this moment, Yuelun’s heart was thumping wildly…
