888 Gathering Of Geniuses (Part 2)

Looking at the charging ferocious beasts, the cultivators of the East continent were taken aback.

“Damn it, we didn’t provoke this fellow, yet it’s already trying to kill us!”

“What the hell? Let’s fight them!”

In the blink of an eye, a defensive perimeter was formed, and a chaotic battle began. On the other hand, the golden tiger simply watched the situation unfold apathetically.

It was not as vicious as the lightning tiger, but neither did it care about the lives of these cultivators. In any case, if a real battle royale started, the East continent cultivators would become the first target anyway.

Given how weak they were, it would be easy to eliminate them first. Furthermore, they were not worth allying with either.

However, at that moment, a green light flashed, and a lotus flower bloomed.

Seeing this scene, everyone raised their heads and looked over. In the sky, they saw a beautiful figure hovering atop the lotus.

“Reincarnation Fairy!”

The cultivators were overjoyed to see her. The Saintess of the Jade Lake Divine sect had come to their rescue. Incidentally, she had already finished receiving the legacy of the Jade Lake Divine sect.

At this moment, she suddenly erupted with power and sent the lightning tiger’s followers flying. Then, her gaze collided with the lightning tiger’s.

The aura she emitted was not inferior to the latter’s. In fact, she even had the upper hand.

“Interesting. So the East continent does have geniuses after all.”

Then, the lightning tiger took a closer look at the Reincarnation Fairy, he realized that there was an extremely terrifying shadowy figure protecting her silently. It then understood what was going on and smiled disdainfully.

“Tsk, she’s just a succession candidate chosen by a powerful existence. For a moment, I thought she was really a peerless genius.”

As soon as it finished speaking, the lightning tiger erupted with lightning energy, causing the East Sea to rumble. Divine runes appeared around its body, and crackling sparks appeared in the air, stinging the skin of those that came into contact with it.

The Reincarnation Fairy did not watch idly as this happened. She stretched out her hands and kept performing different seals, releasing a powerful suppressive force.

The auras of the two clashed, stirring up huge waves on the surface of the sea.

“Heavens!”

“Is this what a clash between peerless geniuses looks like?”

“It’s really too terrifying…”

Many people watched the scene unfold with wide eyes. They could barely tell what was going on.

However, the one thing that they could tell was that the two combatants seemed equally matched. Unfortunately, the Reincarnation Fairy was simply forcing herself to hold on.

She was very clear that she was at a disadvantage, and sighed inwardly. The difference brought about by a noble bloodline was truly tyrannical.

After that first exchange, a hint of admiration appeared in the lightning tiger’s eyes.

“Human woman, you’re quite good. Over the course of my lifetime, the number of people who can resist one of my moves can be counted on the palm of one hand.”

“Since you can block my attack, it means that your strength is indeed somewhat decent. I have high hopes for a genius like you.”

“Now, it’s time for you to make your choice. The first choice is to become my pet and serve me. The second choice is to be killed by me.”

As soon as it finished speaking, its eyes turned cold. The thing it liked the most was defeating other geniuses and putting them in their place. It was a very refreshing feeling.

If the other party refused to submit, then it would kill them. It would not leave any seeds for future troubles.

“Damn it!”

“This tiger is too arrogant. He actually wants the Reincarnation Fairy to become its pet?”

The crowd was in an uproar. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

The Reincarnation Fairy was the Saintess of the Jade Lake Divine palace. What gave this tiger the qualifications to be so arrogant?

At this moment, waves of anger stirred in everyone’s hearts. They felt that this tiger was indirectly insulting them as well, and that it was treating them as pets and ants.

How degrading!

“Damn it! This reckless beast actually dares to look down on us!”

“Who do you think you are? How dare you say such presumptuous words!”

At this moment, a young man could not hold back his anger and said these words.

However, just as he finished speaking, his head instantly fell to the ground. The difference in strength was just too great!

“B*stard!”

After seeing this young man being killed in front of him, Elder Tongtian clenched his fists in anger.

If he was strong enough, he would have attacked and taught this lightning tiger a lesson.

The Reincarnation Fairy was also furious when she saw this. This fellow did not bat an eyelid when killing others.

At this moment, the lightning tiger spoke again.

“Hehe… I’ll give you some more time. You have to seriously think about it. Otherwise, many people will die because of you.”

After hearing this, the eyes of the Reincarnation Fairy were filled with killing intent. However, she forced herself to remain calm.

While she was pondering on how to deal with this matter, a streak of flames instantly descended on the ground. After the flames dissipated, a graceful figure appeared.
