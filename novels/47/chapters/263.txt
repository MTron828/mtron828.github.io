Chapter 264: Luoyun Mountain Range

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

In that instant, all of the spiritual energy in the surrounding seemed to have been assimilated, transforming into extremely sharp sword intent.

Although the sword intent that filled the sky was not targeting anyone, it made everyone feel breathless.

Within a short period of time, the vast sword intent had covered almost half of the Great Qian dynasty.

Wherever it passed, even water turned into sharp swords, the flowers and trees instantly turned into sharp weapons, and even the gentle breeze turned into wind blades.

This terrified people, who felt like the power of the heavens had descended and might destroy the empire at any moment.

In the entire Great Qian dynasty, who else could do this?

Ye Xuan’s figure immediately appeared in everyone’s mind.

Buzzzzzz!

To everyone’s relief, the sword intent dissipated very quickly.

“Ninth-level sword intent!”

“Perfect-level!”

Ye Xuan’s eyes glowed with happiness.

His strength had undergone a huge change again.

Perfect-level sword intent could turn anything into sword qi, which would then be controlled by his spiritual sense.

If he were to make another breakthrough, he would need to engrave the profound pattern derived from sword intent.

Profound patterns were known as the tenth level of martial intents.

With Ye Xuan’s current strength, it was very easy for him to break through to the pattern condensation realm, but profound patterns derived from supreme intents were his goal.

Normally, any other cultivator in his shoes would have immediately advanced to the pattern condensation realm. After all, perfect-level martial intent basically guaranteed a 100% success rate of advancement.

Once one’s intent had reached the sixth level, one would be able to sense the profound patterns based on the world’s natural laws.

The higher the level of their martial intent, the higher the success rate of engraving the profound patterns.

“I wonder how strong I am now…”

Ye Xuan opened his hand slightly. As soon as his spiritual power swept out, the space around him collapsed instantly. He then repaired the spatial cracks with his spatial intent.

“It’s time to leave!”

Ye Xuan looked into the horizon as he said this.

“I’ll be leaving the Nanzhou Region for a while, so you must cultivate well!”

Ye Xuan looked at Yue and the others.

Even with the power of karma, Ye Xuan could only vaguely sense the general direction of the karmic threads. He needed to get closer to determine the exact location.

“Teacher…”

When Yue heard this, her gaze was filled with reluctance.

“Silly girl! As long as you cultivate diligently, you’ll also achieve perfect-level intent someday.”

Ye Xuan smiled and patted Yue’s head.

The sword intent he had displayed just now had had a huge impact on Yue.

Only cultivators who had comprehend similar martial intents could truly understand the gap between each other.

To her, Ye Xuan now felt as far as the heavens were from the earth, and she was afraid that she would be left behind and would never be able to catch up.

“Yes, Teacher!”

Yue wiped the tears from the corners of her eyes and nodded seriously.

“Alright! It’s time for me to go!”

Ye Xuan took one last look at his disciples, and then his figure suddenly disappeared. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Yue, Li Qingyan, and Zhao Yuyan looked at the spot where Ye Xuan had disappeared from in a daze for a long time before finally returning to Lingjiu peak to cultivate.

They did not know when their teacher would return, nor where he was going.

However, they had received his instructions, so they had to cultivate properly and make him proud.

Ye Xuan turned into a streak of light and flew through the sky.

The reason why he did not bring Yue and the others along was because he had discovered through the power of karma that this trip was extremely dangerous.

Therefore, he could only give up on the idea.

Ye Xuan traced the vague direction of the severed karmic thread using the power of karma.

After eight days, Ye Xuan finally got close enough to discover the exact location of his destination.

About a day later, Ye Xuan arrived in the vicinity of the Starfall mountain range of the Luoyun Region.

“Is this the place?”

Ye Xuan hovered in the sky and used the power of karma to determine what he needed to do next.

Buzzzzzz!

Ye Xuan waved his sleeve, tore space apart, and entered the resulting spatial crack.

Soon, Ye Xuan found the place he was looking for within the spatial turbulence.

“Is this the entrance to a mystic realm?”

He narrowed his eyes, and then forced the entrance to open and entered.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

As soon as he entered the mystic realm, he saw the sky filled with the power of heavenly lightning.

In this vast mystic realm, he could not sense any demonic beasts or spiritual herbs. Everywhere he looked, he could only see the power of heavenly lightning.

“Hahaha! Interesting! This is where my opportunity lies!”

Ye Xuan’s eyes lit up.

“Is it related to my heavenly lightning intent, or that beautiful figure in the fog?”
