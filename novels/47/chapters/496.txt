497 The Immortal Sword

Some people were confused, while others were surprised.

Could it be that these two people have a grudge? Otherwise, why would they be so hostile?

“Wait… If I’m not mistaken, Elder Taiyin seems to have a grudge with the previous chief of Cloud Sky peak, Tian Xuan!”

When everyone heard this, they snickered and waited in anticipation for a good show.

!!

Elder Taiyin could squinted his eyes when he sensed the terrifying sword intent. He suddenly felt pressured.

The sword intent Ye Xuan was releasing seemed to be even more terrifying than that of Chief Tian Xuan.

This guy was only a peak-level mystic lord realm cultivator, right?

Furthermore, he did not recall the Cloud Sky sword technique being able to do this. He had the inexplicable feeling that Ye Xuan’s sword intent seemed to be from something else entirely.

“Please draw your sword! I would like to experience your powerful sword techniques,” Ye Xuan said lightly as he smiled.

When Elder Taiyin saw this, he immediately felt a little regretful.

Whatever technique it was that Ye Xuan was using, it was extraordinary. It was likely that if they really fought, he would not be able to defeat the other party easily.

Now that everyone was here and waiting to fight for the heavenly treasure, preserving one’s strength was imperative to increasing their chances of emerging victorious in the competition for the heavenly treasure.

Fighting Ye Xuan here would be a terrible idea.

“Hahaha! Fellow Daoist Ye Xuan is being too serious. I was only joking just now. Moreover, we came here this time to deal with the beast invasion, so we shouldn’t fight among ourselves.”

Having said that, the sword intent erupting from Ye Xuan’s body did not subside, as he continued to smile somewhat mockingly.

“Well, since you looked down on Cloud Sky peak’s swordsmanship, I have to insist!”

“I’m also very curious about the sword techniques of the Immortal Divine sect. Please enlighten me.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan put two fingers together, and a terrifying sword qi quietly condensed.

Elder Taiyin’s expression turned unsightly.

If he backed down in front of so many cultivators, it would be akin to admitting that the Immortal Divine sect was inferior to the Great Wilderness Divine sect.

At the thought of this, a cold gleam flashed across Elder Taiyin’s eyes. He was furious.

This brat was seeking death!

Of course, he still had to put on a show, so Elder Taiyin said courteously, “Since Fellow Daoist Ye Xuan insists, then so be it.”

“Let’s fight!”

As soon as he finished speaking, a heaven-grade magic weapon suddenly appeared in his hand.

When the crowd saw this, they immediately went into an uproar.

“It’s actually the Immortal Sword!”

The Immortal Sword was the legacy weapon of the Immortal Divine sect, and only the grand elders were allowed to wield it.

“A heaven-rank magic weapon?”

Ye Xuan smiled. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

If he were to take out the Cloud Heaven sword, he would probably scare everyone silly. However, he gave up on the idea. He could not fully control the power of the divine-rank weapon yet.

There was no reason to court jealousy and envy either.

Furthermore, the powerful beasts were still in heated battle. He was not prepared to waste too much spiritual power on this old man.

Therefore, instead of killing him, he had a more interesting idea.

In that instant, two surging sword qis clashed, and the sky lit up with dazzling divine light.

Elder Taiyin raised the Immortal Sword, and an invisible sword qi suddenly swept out, transforming into a sharp gust of wind that covered the sword.

He was hovering in the air, looking down on Ye Xuan. This was a grudge from the past, but Ye Xuan would inherit the revenge that he had planned for Chief Tian Xuan.

Even after hundreds of years, old man Taiyin still could not forget the humiliation of that year.

He could clearly sense that although Ye Xuan’s sword qi was powerful, it was no match for his. Then, he glanced at Ye Xuan and frowned when he saw the sword qi condensed from Ye Xuan’s fingers.

“Where’s your magic weapon?”

Ye Xuan stood there indifferently.

“To deal with you, do I really need to use a magic weapon?”

He circulated the spiritual power in his body to condense the purest sword qi. Ye Xuan’s control of his spiritual power in his body had reached an extremely terrifying level thanks to the cultivation of the Flora sword technique.

“How arrogant!”

Elder Taiyin’s face turned cold.

This brat really did not know what was good for him!

Elder Taiyin was not the only one who was angry. The people who were watching the show all felt that Ye Xuan was being too pretentious.

While fighting the grand elder of the Immortal Divine sect, this guy was not even using his magic artifacts…

Was there something wrong with his brain?

“He’s too arrogant… I know that he’s very strong, but this is ridiculous!”

“Isn’t this the same as looking down on Elder Taiyin?”

“It is! Elder Taiyin is the grand elder of the Immortal Divine sect, and is definitely an extremely powerful expert. Even Gongsun Shouyue would not dare to take him lightly!”

“I think he’ll definitely lose miserably!”

Everyone was in a heated discussion.

...

However, Ye Xuan was not bothered by this, as his body shone with dazzling light, and his body began to rise into the sky like a divine sword.

“With a sword in my heart, there will be swords everywhere!”

“Elder Taiyin, are you ready to see my sword qi?”

As soon as he finished speaking, the sword qi that Ye Xuan condensed erupted and swept out.
