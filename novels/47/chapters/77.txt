Chapter 78: The Joy Of Free Stuff

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The arena fell deathly silent. One could hear a pin drop!

When the crowd saw the sword qi hurricane, they were all stunned. Beads of sweat kept falling from their foreheads!

They sensed the dreadful power of that strike.

They could also clearly see the change in Chen Xiaofeng’s expression. His originally confident smile turned into pale fear.

Everyone knew that if Ye Xuan had not made a move, Chen Xiaofeng would have most likely fallen to this strike.

“I… I lost!”

After a long time, Chen Xiaofeng muttered dazedly, breaking the silence around the arena.

He collapsed on the ground. His arms felt powerless, and his longsword fell onto the arena platform. His eyes were vacant.

He had originally been filled with absolute confidence that he would defeat Li Qingyan.

After all, they were both ninth level true essence realm cultivators. Even if there was a difference in their innate talent, he would not be defeated so badly.

However, when he saw Li Qingyan unleash the Windstorm Slash, he suddenly understood that the difference between them was like a natural chasm that could not be crossed.

With just one strike, the opponent could kill him!

“Teacher, I…”

Seeing this, Li Qingyan’s expression also changed, and she was somewhat at a loss.

She also did not expect to comprehend the true essence of the Windstorm Slash in battle, and that it would unleash such terrifying power.

Although she wanted to win because of Ye Xuan, she did not have any intention of killing Chen Xiaofeng.

However, when she performed that strike, she had been immersed in a state of comprehension, and her memories amplified her desire to win even further.

This was why Li Qingyan had unleashed such a powerful Windstorm Slash.

“Don’t worry about it!”

Ye Xuan waved his sleeve and then came over to Li Qingyan’s side. He patted the latter’s head and comforted her gently with his eyes.

Everyone could see that Li Qingyan had not done it on purpose, so they naturally would not blame her!

Moreover, this was the territory of the sect. The sect leader and the elders were all present. There was no way they would sit back and watch a tragedy unfold.

Even if Ye Xuan had not made a move, the sect leader or other elders would have intervened.

Feeling the warmth of her teacher, the panic in Li Qingyan’s heart dissipated a little. She heaved a sigh of relief.

“Sigh!”

Wan Shanhai sighed when he saw this scene.

She was truly a monster. Although her talent was not as good as Ye Xuan himself, she had already surpassed most cultivators.

Moreover, she was actually able to comprehend the true essence of that martial technique in battle.

Although he did not know what martial technique Li Qingyan was using, from the looks of it, it seemed to be very similar to the Qingyun sect’s Windstorm Sword technique, but its power was much greater.

His disciple’s confidence was probably going to suffer a huge blow.

However, this was also good. If one’s path of cultivation was too smooth, it might not be a good thing.

A real rainbow would only shine after experiencing wind and rain. Hopefully, this little disciple of his would allow this experience to temper him.

“Is the final fight still going to go on?”

Immediately, Wan Shanhai’s gaze fell on Li Qingyan and Yue.

After Chen Xiaofeng’s defeat, only Yue and Li Qingyan were left in contention for the championship. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

The other personal disciples were all defeated by these two.

“There’s no need for that!” Ye Xuan waved his hand with a smile.

There was no need to guess the result anymore.

Although Yue had the advantage of her sword jade physique, and was probably stronger than Chen Xiaofeng if she tried her best, she was definitely no match for Li Qingyan who had comprehended the Windstorm Slash.

Therefore, the ranking was obvious.

No. 1: Li Qingyan.

No. 2: Yue.

No. 3: Chen Xiaofeng.

The sect leader and the elders had no problem with the rankings of the third round of the competition.

They were the top-tier core formation realm experts, so they had a clear judgment of the combat strength of these true essence realm cultivators. The ranking was fair and just.

Wan Shanhai and the elders knew very well that even if Li Qingyan had not comprehended the Windstorm Slash, Chen Xiaofeng was definitely not her match.

However, Chen Xiaofeng was too confident and insisted on challenging Li Qingyan.

The result of such overconfidence was obvious.

After the rankings of the Qingyun sect competition were determined, it was time to distribute the rewards.

Ye Xuan was in charge of the top three rewards, so naturally, he was the one to distribute them.

Of course, there were also rewards for the fourth to tenth ranks, but they were much more ordinary compared to the top three, and they were awarded by the sect leader!

“Ding! As the host has given his disciple the Heart-seeking Fruit, the host has received a randomized 30x critical reward. Congratulations! You have obtained the Heart Meditation Fruit!”

When Ye Xuan gave the Heart-seeking Fruit to Li Qingyan, the system’s notification immediately rang out in his mind.

At the same time, a spiritual fruit filled with mysterious power suddenly appeared in the system’s storage space!

“The joy of receiving free gifts! Hehe!”

Ye Xuan’s expression remained the same, but inwardly, he was so excited that he almost jumped up with joy.

He was just a middleman who was giving the Heart-seeking Fruit to his disciple on behalf of the sect, but he had received a reward from the system. This was practically a gift that fell from the sky.

Then, Ye Xuan gave the origin condensing pill to Yue.

However, he did not receive a reward from the system because of this. After all, he had already used the origin condensing pill on Yue once.

Finally, he gave Chen Xiaofeng, who was in low spirits, the Shuiqing sword.

Chen Xiaofeng’s gaze fell on the Shuiqing sword and he fell silent. He felt as if there was an inexplicable knot in his heart.

Elder Ye Xuan was already a monstrous existence, a young prodigy who had suppressed an era. Now, was his disciple going to repeat his legendary feats?

It was really sad to be born in the same era as such a monstrous genius.

At this moment, Chen Xiaofeng’s heart was filled with a sense of powerlessness. This sense of powerlessness came from the depths of his heart.

Then, the sect competition continued.

The inner sect disciples who ranked in the top ten would have the right to challenge the personal disciples.

However, the personal disciples were no doubt the disciples of the sect leader or elders. Their strength was no small matter. Although they were beaten up by Yue and Li Qingyan, it did not mean that the inner sect disciples were not qualified to be their opponents.

Although there were indeed many dark horses in this year’s sect competition, there was still a strength gap between the inner sect disciples and the personal disciples. No one succeeded in challenging them.

“In seventeen days, the direct disciples who ranked in the top ten of the sect competition will be the representatives of our Qingyun sect and participate in the competition between the three great sects!”

“Moreover, the competition between the three great sects will be held in our Qingyun sect’s territory!”

After Wan Shanhai announced the competition between the three great sects, the Qingyun sect competition officially ended.
