However, in exchange for such strength, cultivators with the Demon Devourer Body required far more spiritual power to break through.

Hu!

Zhao Yuyan’s small hands supported her legs as she panted heavily. Her forehead was covered in sweat!

It was her first time fighting with someone!

“Teacher…”

Hearing Ye Xuan’s words, Zhao Yuyan’s eyes could not help but turn red.

“What’s wrong, Yan’er?”

“Yan’er… Yan’er doesn’t want to leave Teacher’s side… Teacher, you have to come and pick me up quickly!”

Zhao Yuyan raised her head and looked at Ye Xuan, trying hard to suppress the sadness in her heart.

When she thought about the fact that she would be separated from her teacher, Zhao Yuyan could not help but feel sad.

Although she had not known Ye Xuan for long, this was the first time anyone other than her parents had shown care for her. It was a feeling that she craved and longed for.

“Of course! After I leave the mystic realm, I will come looking for you!”

Ye Xuan smiled and rubbed Zhao Yuyan’s head.

“Okay, silly girl, I still have a lot of good things to teach you!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan rubbed his chin and started thinking. What kind of cultivation method and martial techniques should he teach Zhao Yuyan?

Of course, no matter what kind of cultivation method and martial techniques they were, Ye Xuan would normally only take out the highest grade ones so that he could obtain better rewards from the system.

However, Zhao Yuyan’s cultivation level was too low. It might not be suitable for her to cultivate some of the higher-grade methods and techniques.

Ye Xuan thought for a moment, and then stretched out his index finger and gently tapped Zhao Yuyan’s forehead.

“I picked out a few good cultivation methods and martial techniques for you, but they are not suitable for your current cultivation level. You just need to remember them for now. When your cultivation reaches that level, you can naturally start cultivating them!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Zhao Yuyan suddenly felt some unfamiliar cultivation methods and martial techniques appear in her mind!

“Ding! As the host has given his disciple the Three Thousand Thunder Sword technique (Middle-grade Earth-rank), the host has received a randomized 102x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the Lightning Tribulation Sword technique (Top-grade Earth-rank)!”

“Ding! As the host has given his disciple the Star Slash technique (Top-grade Black-rank), the host has received a randomized 68x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the Void Slash technique (Low-grade Earth-rank)!”

“Ding! As the host has given his disciple the Endless Sword technique (Top-grade Black-rank), the host has received a randomized 169x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the Nihility Sword Defense technique (Middle-grade Earth-rank)!”

At the same time, system notifications rang out in Ye Xuan’s mind one after another.

Immediately, Ye Xuan’s eyes lit up. This silly girl really was his lucky star. The reward multipliers he received when he taught her were so much higher. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The attributes of the techniques were very similar. They were all sword techniques, and many of them were related to the power of lightning.

If Ye Xuan could comprehend the Heavenly Lightning intent, coupled with the high-level techniques given by the system, his combat strength would be enhanced significantly.

If he could master the Void Slash, he would even be able to slice through space!

When Ye Xuan fought with the fat monk earlier, the reason why a spatial crack had appeared was because the bowl had shattered. The bowl was a spatial storage tool, so when it was shattered by Ye Xuan’s sword qi, it created a spatial crack.

However, as long as Ye Xuan mastered the Void Slash technique, he would be able to slash through space and create his spatial tears and cracks.

The Nihility Sword Defense technique was a defensive martial technique. When mastered, it would be able to create a barrier to block the enemy attacks.

However, Ye Xuan had never used a defensive martial technique. There was no need to. He had basically crushed all of his opponents, and had yet to meet an opponent capable of harming him.

“While these techniques are indeed too high-level and not suitable for you, I have specially selected some suitable ones for you.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan once again extended his index finger and gently tapped Zhao Yuyan’s forehead.

The techniques he taught her included the spirit sword technique, gale sword technique, and so on.

“Oh right, there is also a technique to conceal your aura!”

Then, Ye Xuan also imparted the Nihility technique to her.

“Ding! As the host has given his disciple the Nihility technique (secret technique), the host has received a randomized 30x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the Hidden Dragon technique!”

“Hidden Dragon technique?”

Seeing this, Ye Xuan could not help but raise his eyebrows.

The Hidden Dragon technique did not differ much from the Nihility technique, but compared to the latter, it gave its user the ability to simulate or fake their aura. The user would be able to appear weaker, or even stronger!

In that sense, the user might even be able to scare off powerful opponents by faking their aura!

“Not bad! It’s definitely a great tool for pretentious people!”

A smile appeared on Ye Xuan’s lips.

Zhao Yuyan, who was next to him, was completely stunned. Her eyes were filled with shock.

What grade of cultivation methods and martial techniques had her teacher imparted to her? Was this not a little too powerful?

Although Zhao Yuyan did not know much, her 600 points of comprehension value was not just for show. She was able to grasp the basic concepts of these techniques easily.

For a moment, Zhao Yuyan’s little heart was trembling.

Ye Xuan did not realize what his disciple was thinking about, and simply transmitted the qi storage and aura concealing techniques to her as well, since those were more suited for her to cultivate at this moment in time.

After she reached the true essence realm, she would be able to cultivate the aura concealing technique.

After the martial techniques and cultivation methods were imparted, it was time for the mount, pills, and so on!

Divine light flashed between Ye Xuan’s brows, and an incomparably huge bird suddenly appeared next to him!

This was the firewing! A mid-grade tier five demon beast!

Its strength was comparable to a human golden core realm expert!

With the firewing protecting Zhao Yuyan, Ye Xuan felt at ease.
