625 Body Refining

“Teacher, hurry up and tell me how to absorb the medicinal effects! It’s hot in here!”

However, Ye Xuan did not answer immediately. Instead, he walked around the Boundless Cauldron to check the medicinal solution. It seemed that iot was working, and constantly tempering Xiang Yun’s body.

“Don’t be anxious. Keep your body in a relaxed state, calm your heart to feel the effects of the medicinal solution, and then absorb them into your body.”

After saying that, Ye Xuan kept a close eye on Xiang Yun’s condition. If he detected anything wrong, he would immediately pull her out of the cauldron.

!!

As this was only her first time refining her body, he did not make the solution very concentrated, as too much of a good thing was a bad thing.

After hearing Ye Xuan’s instructions, Xiang Yun relaxed her body and mind. She closed her eyes and tried to sense the medicinal effects.

However, the solution was still quite strong, and caused her a fair bit of pain. Despite this, she was determined to endure so that she could become invincible among her peers!

Ye Xuan admired her perseverance. This was a trait that every powerful expert had to have.

After some time passed, Xiang Yun opened her eyes, and her body unleashed violent power.

Ye Xuan was surprised.

She had already reached the foundation establishment realm? Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

The levels of body refining were similar to cultivation realms. The only difference was that the first realm was different.

The initial realm of body refiners was called the foundation establishment realm, while for cultivators, it was called the mystic meridian realm.

After Ye Xuan examined Xiang Yun’s body for changes, he took out another spiritual herb from his storage space. This herb contained a significant amount of medicinal power.

He added the spiritual herb into the solution, and released a wave of his spiritual power into Xiang Yun’s body to help her refine it. At the same time, he was about to teach her the body refining technique.

“Yun’er, watch and memorize the flow of spiritual power in your body. This is how you’ll be able to refine your body in the future.”

Xiang Yun nodded, indicating that she understood. Then, she began to carefully sense the flow of Ye Xuan’s spiritual power in her body as he circulated it according to the body refining technique.

A single full cycle was all it took to incite a change within Xiang Yun’s body, which was quite frightening, even to Ye Xuan.

‘Being the reincarnation of an expert isn’t just for show, eh?’

He glanced at Xiang Yun and asked, “Have you memorized it?”

As she was in pain, she could only nod to express her affirmation.

“Alright then. In order to make sure you’ve got it right, I will circulate it a few more times. After that, you’ll have to start doing it on your own.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan once again circulated his spiritual power through her body a few times, and eventually retracted it.

It seemed that despite her lack of aptitude when it came to learning how to read, she did not have the same problems when it came to cultivation, though it could be argued that the former was more about laziness than anything else.

Looking at the level of talent of his precious disciple, Ye Xuan was truly shocked. Perhaps this little girl did not need to know how to read in order to cultivate.

After Ye Xuan withdrew his spiritual power, Xiang Yun began to circulate the spiritual power in her body that had been refined earlier according to the same route that Ye Xuan had shown her just now.

All it took was a few cycles before Xiang Yun could clearly sense that she had become stronger, which left her a little dumbfounded.

Her lips trembled, but there were no words to describe what she was feeling.

Zhuge Yueyue was watching this unfold in amazement.

‘Third Sister is really talented. It’s only been five minutes since Teacher started teaching her, but she’s already reached the middle stage of the foundation establishment realm.’

‘My cultivation progress pales in comparison.’

She still remembered that she had broken through one level within a day, but Xiang Yun had gone even further, and broken through in five minutes.

This was not the end. The medicinal effects of the solution had still not been completely refined, and Xiang Yun was constantly absorbing them into her body.

Zhuge Yueyue felt that she had to work harder. Otherwise, this junior sister of hers would catch up to her at some point.

That would be really embarrassing.

Thinking this, she immediately bid farewell to Ye Xuan and left to enter secluded cultivation.

Since she no longer had to teach Xiang Yun how to read, she had to seize this opportunity to cultivate and become stronger.

“Wuwu…”

“It hurts…”

Xiang Yun could not take it anymore. She shouted and jumped out of the cauldron, running around the garden.

Seeing such a funny scene, Ye Xuan laughed.
