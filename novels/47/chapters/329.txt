330 Getting Stronger (Part 3)

As he lacked any reference, it took him two-and-a-half years to comprehend sixth-level life intent, after which he engraved it into a profound pattern. This increased the level of lifeforce in Ye Xuan’s body.

Even a great emperor realm expert would find it difficult to kill Ye Xuan now!

After engraving the life profound pattern, Ye Xuan’s eyes bloomed with the divine light of life. He opened his palm slightly, and a withered seed suddenly appeared in his palm.

However, moments later, the withered seed was infused with rich lifeforce. In an instant, it took root and sprouted, turning into a giant tree.

“Is this the power of life intent? I can even resurrect the dead!”

Ye Xuan’s eyes brightened.

Within a certain period of time after a person’s death, he would be able to resurrect them. Of course, there were other conditions and requirements related to this.

Ye Xuan still had one-and-a-half years left of his epiphany. Thus, he sat down cross-legged in front of the giant tree and took out a ninth-level heart of heavenly lightning and began to refine it.

Very quickly, a year passed, and he successfully refined it. His heavenly lightning intent had reached the perfect level!

“I wonder what are the chances of me beating a great emperor realm expert?”

Ye Xuan could clearly sense that he could easily crush a late-stage Saint King realm expert, so logically speaking, he should at least stand a chance against a great emperor realm expert.

Perhaps if he engraved more supreme profound patterns, he would be able to kill one!

There was still half a year left of his epiphany, so he used it to study the fusion between his supreme intents, and successfully fused destruction, spatial, strength and heavenly lightning intents.

This fusion resulted in an unimaginable level of power. Furthermore, he possessed his ninth-level sword profound pattern, which gave him confidence in his odds in a fight with a great emperor realm expert.

He could finally be considered one of the most powerful people on the Tianyuan continent.

‘As long as I can comprehend the five more supreme intents and engrave them as profound patterns, even defeating a great emperor expert won’t be an issue!’

Thinking this, Ye Xuan’s heart was filled with lofty aspirations.

The power of karma told him that the opportunity that would allow him to successfully engrave the rest of his supreme profound patterns was related to the other world.

Ye Xuan speculated that the other world was likely to be the legendary upper realm!

In addition, Ye Xuan had a vague feeling that once he succeeded in engraving all of his supreme profound patterns, his power would very likely break the boundaries of the Tianyuan continent.

It was rumored that once a cultivator surpassed the great emperor realm, they would be able to ascend to a higher world.

Therefore, before he searched for the other world, Ye Xuan had to make proper arrangements for everything, especially for his disciples.

It was time to help Shangguan Wan’er awaken her Undying Xuan Huang sword physique..

After his epiphany ended, Ye Xuan did not choose to leave secluded cultivation immediately. Instead, he cultivated for another two months to consolidate his cultivation foundation.

After doing all this, Ye Xuan ended his secluded cultivation and went over to check on his disciples.

After these five years, his disciples had indeed made great progress.

Using the system, his and their attributes were displayed as follows. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

The five profound patterns that Ye Xuan had engraved were life, spatial, strength, destruction, and heavenly lightning.

Shangguan Wan’er had engraved the profound patterns of heavenly lightning, ice, metal, water and sword.

Although the two of them had the same cultivation level, there was a large gulf between their actual combat strength.

There was no helping it. Ye Xuan had a cheat-like system!

Even though Shangguan Wan’er was the reincarnation of an ancient great empress, she still had to abide by the laws of the Tianyuan continent.

“In these five years, I believe you have comprehended the karmic intent and spatial intent. Show me how far you’ve progressed with them,” Ye Xuan said.

“Teacher, I have yet to comprehend karmic intent, and my spatial intent is only in its embryonic form.”

Shangguan Wan’er felt ashamed to have failed her teacher’s expectations.

Ye Xuan had warned her before that she should not refine the heart of heavenly lightning during her state of her epiphany.

However, she failed to resist the temptation of doing so.

Because of this, after she had comprehended seventh-level heavenly lightning intent, her epiphany ended. She then comprehended the embryonic form of spatial intent normally.
