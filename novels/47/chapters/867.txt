868 Grateful

Elder Qian Yi was very grateful to Ye Xuan for his new lease on life. However, what he did not know was that Ye Xuan was equally grateful to Elder Qian Yi.

Elder Qian Yi was the catalyst that had allowed him to complete so many cultivation techniques, and help Feng Xiyun. Thanks to that, he had obtained the Chaos Sacred Body, Stellar sword technique, and the Heaven Burning Flames. He even had four more chances to complete other cultivation techniques, which would make him even stronger once used.

That being said, although he was very excited, Ye Xuan still had a calm expression on his face as he said, “There’s no need to thank me. You and I are both from Cloud Sky peak, and were fated to meet today.” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“It was not particularly difficult for me, so just consider it an opportunity that I’m giving you.”

After hearing this, Elder Qian Yi’s heart trembled, and he looked at Ye Xuan with even more respect and awe.

This was a true expert!

The Sword Immortal did not attach importance to fame and fortune. These words made Elder Qian Yi take a deep breath.

At the same time, he also felt a little proud. After all, Sword Immortal Ye was also from Cloud Sky peak, which meant that he could brag that Cloud Sky peak had produced a sealed immortal realm expert!

In the end, he said, “No matter what, I will never forget your great kindness. As long as my help is needed.”

Although he also understood that he might not be able to help Ye Xuan much, he wanted to repay the kindness in any way possible. Then, he turned his gaze to Ao Lei and said, “Fellow Daoist Ao, I’ve really benefited a lot from my trip here.”

“Today, I finally understand what it means to be a frog in a well. I have to apologize for my arrogance from before. I hope you won’t blame me, Fellow Daoist Ao.”

“Your sect is already stronger than all of the other forces in the Heaven continent, including my sect,” Elder Qian Yi said these words from the bottom of his heart.

The arrogance he felt when he first arrived at the sect had been replaced with admiration.

The East Continent’s Great Wilderness Divine sect had a peerless expert like Ye Xuan within their ranks, so they would never lose to any force.

“Originally, I thought that there would definitely not be any geniuses in a desolate place like the East continent, but I now realize that I was completely wrong. Your sect is overflowing with talent.”

After saying this, Elder Qian Yi could not help but look at Feng Xiyun. If this woman were to appear in the competition of disciples between their two sects, the outcome would be decided even before the competition started.

As such, it was obvious which sect would end up as the orthodox one.

“Haha, Elder Qian Yi, you flatter us.”

Hearing Elder Qian Yi’s heartfelt words, Ao Lei felt extremely happy. It seemed that all it took to give Elder Qian Yi a perspective shift was a visit to Cloud Sky peak.

This junior brother of his never failed to impress, whether it was to outsiders, or even members of his own sect.

At this point, it was not even certain if the competition between disciples would take place at all. After returning to the Great Wilderness Divine sect of the Heaven continent, Elder Qian Yi would probably inform the leaders of the sect there about what had happened, and perhaps something might change.

The knowledge that the East continent’s Great Wilderness Divine sect had such a talented disciple like Feng Xiyun would likely cause waves of panic on the other side.

Then, Elder Qian Yi looked at Ao Lei and said, “Fellow Daoist Ao, what do you think about the matter I mentioned earlier?”

As soon as he finished speaking, the surroundings instantly fell silent, and everyone turned to look at Ao Lei, who understood that it was time to make a decision. In any case, there was no longer any reason to hesitate, now that he had both Feng Xiyun and Zhuge Yueyue.
