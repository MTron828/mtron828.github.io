Chapter 54: Other People’s Teacher

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

At this moment, Li Zhengyang and the elders were all stunned, and their eyes filled with shock.

If they remembered correctly, a few hours ago, Li Qingyan was still a seventh-level qi transformation realm cultivator. F*ck! Even if she soared to the heavens, she still should not have been able to break through so quickly.

Were they hallucinating? Was this an illusion array set up by some expert?

However, Li Zhengyang and the elders were all purple spirit realm cultivators. Collectively trapping them all in an illusion array would require the strength of a true core realm cultivator at the very least.

Moreover, this should not be the case. Why would such a true core realm expert attack the Li Family?

Dang! Dang! Dang!

The intense sounds of swords clashing against each other kept ringing out in the training ground.

Li Zhengyang and the other elders came back to their senses when they felt the intense battle fluctuations from the fight.

It seemed to be real…

“This… this is unbelievable!”

The first elder could not help but swallow his saliva when he saw this scene. He suspected that he was seeing things or dreaming.

Li Zhengyang narrowed his eyes as he watched the fight with a shocked expression.

Just a few minutes ago, they had been discussing when Li Qingyan would be able to break through to the true essence realm. Everyone agreed that there was a high possibility that she would break through before next year.

......

However, Li Qingyan had actually broken through from the seventh level of the qi transformation realm to the eighth level of the true essence realm in the span of a few hours. Was this even f*cking something that a human could achieve? Even Ye Xuan had not been so abnormal back then, right?

Wait, Ye Xuan…

Right, it had to be Ye Xuan’s doing.

Only a monstrous figure like him could help Li Qingyan advance to the eighth level of the true essence realm within a short period of time.

Although they did not know what method Ye Xuan used, if this matter were to be publicized, it would definitely cause countless cultivators to be shocked.

Li Zhengyang and the various elders forcefully suppressed the shock in their hearts and watched the battle in the training field with solemn expressions.

It was obvious that Li Qingyan was not familiar with her newfound strength, but that was normal. Anyone who advanced that quickly would find it difficult to completely stabilize their cultivation and strength within a short period of time.

Therefore, even if Li Qingyan’s cultivation was three minor realms higher than Yue’s, she was still unable to resist Yue’s attacks.

After all, Yue had not only completely stabilized her own cultivation realm, but she had also skillfully grasped the martial techniques that Ye Xuan had taught her.

Huang Ling and Xue Min had been her sparring partners before and, after that, she had participated in actual combat against the bandits. Yue’s actual combat experience was no longer lacking.

Although Li Qingyan’s cultivation level was higher, if she wanted to surpass Yue in terms of strength, she still needed a certain amount of time to familiarize herself with her newfound strength, as well as the martial techniques.

Whoosh!

A sharp sword gleam flashed past, and a clear crack suddenly appeared on the hard granite of the training ground.

Since Li Qingyan was unable to properly control her own power, the true essence power in her Dantian overflowed.

Yue, on the other hand, had achieved a level of control that was hard to believe.She could almost maximize every part of her power.

The Windstorm Sword technique and the Rampart Sword technique that she used were deployed skillfully.

“So powerful!”

“Although that girl is only at the fifth level of the true essence realm, her control of true essence power is extremely fine-tuned. Moreover, the spiritual power in her Dantian is much richer than cultivators of the same realm!”

When Li Zhengyang and the other elders saw this scene, their expressions turned serious.

At the same time, they were inwardly questioning themselves. If they were also in the fifth level of the true essence realm, would they be a match for Yue?

However, the outcome was obvious. Yue’s strength had long surpassed ordinary fifth-level true essence realm cultivators, and her combat experience was no longer her weakness. There was no way they could beat her at all.

Of course, Li Qingyan’s performance was not bad either. After all, Li Qingyan’s comprehension value was higher than Yue’s.

As the fight progressed, Li Qingyan gradually became more and more familiar with her current strength, and the gap between her and Yue slowly narrowed.

“These two people are both freaks!”

Although Li Zhengyang and the elders had reached the purple spirit realm, when they watched the fight between Yue and Li Qingyan, who were two true essence realm cultivators, they still felt shocked!

At the same time, they gained a new understanding of the strength of the personal disciples of top-tier sects.

They were very familiar with Li Qingyan’s previous strength, but after just a few hours of Ye Xuan’s tutelage, she seemed to have undergone a complete transformation.

This was especially true for her fighting spirit, which greatly impressed them.

“Qingyan’s talent is not bad. Fortunately, she met Elder Ye Xuan, so she will be able to fully display her full potential!”

“It’s all our fault that the Li family’s strength is limited. We almost buried this girl’s talent!”

Seeing this scene, the second elder could not help but sigh.

Fortunately, Li Qingyan was still young and had successfully become Ye Xuan’s disciple.

As night fell, the battle between Li Qingyan and Yue gradually came to an end.

After the two swords collided with each other for the last time, their figures slowly separated.

“Thank you for your guidance today, Senior Sister!” Li Qingyan put away the longsword in her hand and said to Yue with a smile.

“Junior Sister’s comprehension value is far higher than mine. With a little practice, you will be able to completely control the power in your body. By then, Senior Sister won’t be able to defeat you!”

“If you want to train in the future, you will have to look for Teacher!” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Yue spoke humbly, her starry eyes shone mysteriously.

“Senior Sister, you are too modest. I am extremely clear about my own abilities! Moreover, it is all thanks to Teacher that I was able to reach such a level. Otherwise, I would still be a seventh-level qi transformation realm cultivator!”

Thinking of Ye Xuan, Li Qingyan’s eyes shone as well.

“That’s right. It is all thanks to Teacher that I am able to reach my current level of cultivation as well!” Yue smiled.

Every time she thought of her teacher, she could not help but smile. Her otherworldly fairy-like temperament was suddenly showcased, stunning everyone.

Not far away, Huang Ling and Xue Min saw this scene and looked at each other. The corners of their mouths twitched.

Seeing their peers become so outstanding, they were undoubtedly extremely jealous.

This was the feeling of being able to see something, but not being able to obtain it. It was too depressing. However, they could not do anything about it. After all, they were Elder Lin Qing’s disciples, not Ye Xuan’s.
