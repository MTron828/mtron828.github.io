443 Generous Reward

Gongsun Shouyue sat at the center. Looking at the countless cultivators gathered, he smiled.

“It’s good to be young. I can’t help but think back to the days when we were hot-blooded like them!”

“What a pity! In the blink of an eye, several hundred years have passed, and there aren’t many of our fellow peers left.”

“I have always wondered if the older generation would be able to pass down the inheritance of the Great Wilderness Divine sect to the younger generation successfully, but seeing that the young cultivators of the various peaks are all talents, I can finally rest assured.”

Hearing Gongsun Shouyue’s words, the other chiefs were confused.

“Senior Brother Gongsun, why have you become so sentimental? This isn’t like the usual you!” Gao Shun asked doubtfully.

“Hahaha! People will eventually grow old, and there are some things that we older folks have to think about.”

Gongsun Shouyue smiled.

In fact, when Chief Tian Xuan passed away a hundred years ago, he already had similar thoughts.

“Alright! Let’s not talk about this for now…”

Just as Gao Shun was about to speak further, Gongsun Shouyue waved his hand and got up.

His voice resounded like a gong across the entire Great Wilderness Divine sect.

“I hereby announce that the once-in-a-century Seven Peaks competition of the Great Wilderness Divine sect has officially begun!”

“There are a total of eight rewards for the Seven Peaks competition. In order to obtain these rewards, one has to go through stages of selection and enter the top eight!”

“If you become the champion, you’ll receive an earth-rank spiritual herb, the divine fruit of the Great Dao! There are also several high-grade medicinal pills!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the cultivators of the Great Wilderness Divine sect erupted with excitement.

“Oh my God, it’s actually the divine fruit of the Great Dao. The sect master is being really generous!”

No one expected that Gongsun Shouyue would be willing to make a top-grade earth-rank spiritual herb the top prize of the Seven Peaks competition.

This was a heavenly treasure that could improve a cultivator’s comprehension ability. Its value far exceeded that of ordinary earth-rank spiritual herbs.

Not only that, but the divine fruit of the Great Dao would also allow the cultivator to consume it to break through to the next level.

Even Ye Xuan was excited by this reward. If he could get this reward, he would be able to reap even more rewards from the system. Of course, it was not really useful to him, but giving it to his disciples would trigger the system’s critical reward multiplier, which would likely award him something useful.

Zhuge Yueyue, who was sitting below the martial arts field, heard this and quickly looked up at Ye Xuan.

When she realized that her teacher seemed to care about the reward, her gaze gradually became determined.

‘This divine fruit must be very important to Teacher. No matter what, I have to become the champion of the Seven Peaks competition!’

At the same time, in the direction of where the Hidden Sword Peak’s cultivators were gathered, Gao Tianyu, who was originally gloomy, smiled when he heard this.

‘The reward is just as father said. It’s an extremely rare divine fruit!’

‘No matter what, I have to become the champion of the Seven Peaks competition. As long as I get this divine fruit, father might be able to break through to the next realm!’

Gongsun Shouyue’s words had stirred up the entire Great Wilderness Divine sect.

Everyone’s eyes glowed with greed and anticipation.

At this moment, Gao Shun looked disdainfully at Ye Xuan beside him and said, “Looking at Junior Brother Ye’s expression, it seems that you’re determined to win the reward for the champion’s position.”

“Senior Brother Gao, you jest. There are only two disciples from Cloud Sky peak, and they just joined the sect not long ago. They’re only here today to experience the competition,” Ye Xuan smiled as he replied.

“This is just training for my two disciples. There’s no way they can win the championship, hehe.”

Everyone’s mouth twitched when they heard this.

No one believed him. They had all heard that there was a genius cultivator on Cloud Sky peak who had reached the first level of the divine mystic realm in five days.

Three months had passed since then, and no one knew what Zhuge Yueyue’s current cultivation level was.

Given Ye Xuan’s personality, it was obvious that he liked to remain low-key before suddenly surprising everyone.

Otherwise, he would not have tolerated the abuse for a hundred years and only revealed his strength today. This fellow’s disciple was probably the same as him.

Although the chiefs were cursing inwardly, they did not say anything.

Seeing this, Yuelun tugged at Ye Xuan’s clothes and said softly, “Junior Brother Ye, today’s competition is especially important. If Cloud Sky peak really loses, Senior Brother Gao will definitely not let go of this chance to suppress you.”

Ye Xuan then looked deeply at Ye Xuan, causing her to blush and look away.

“Senior Sister Yuelun, are you worried about me?”

“How is that possible? How could I be worried about you? I’m just praying that Cloud Sky peak will be eliminated in the first round. Then my Water Sky peak will definitely not place last!”

Yuelun spouted some nonsense, and then quickly turned around and left.

Hearing this, Ye Xuan smiled. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

How could Cloud Sky peak be at the bottom? There was no way Zhuge Yueyue would let that happen..

In a short while, the drawing of lots for the cultivators from the various peaks was over.

Right at this time, as the law enforcement elder, Gao Shun went out to say a few words to guarantee that the judgment of this year’s Seven Peaks competition would be absolutely fair.

Of course, everyone was well aware that Gao Shun was probably biased toward Hidden Sword peak.

Then, Gongsun Shouyue waved his sleeve. The spacious square suddenly trembled, and eight arenas rose.

Ye Xuan immediately went over to where Feng Xiyun, Zhuge Yueyue, and Su Changhe were standing.
