525 In We Go

“Martial Uncle Li, now that the ancient tomb’s entrance is completely open, shouldn’t we follow them in?”

Behind Li Dahai, Hua Rufeng rubbed his hands in anticipation.

Such an opportunity was rare. If they did not go in and fight for their share, they would definitely feel regret.

Li Dahai also scanned the area and found that the entrance had long been blocked by people.

!!

There were even some people who had started fighting each other in order to enter the ancient tomb in advance, causing countless casualties.

After thinking about it for a while, Li Dahai finally spoke, “Alright. Since the entrance is completely open, there will inevitably be some fights.”

“Rufeng, you can go and search for your own opportunities. However, you must remember that safety is paramount, and do not embarrass the Great Wilderness Divine sect.”

“Don’t worry, Martial Uncle Li. I’ll take my leave first!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Hua Rufeng immediately flew toward the entrance.

However, as soon as he arrived near the entrance, Hua Rufeng ran into Xie Tianyu of the Supreme Divine sect, who immediately tried to stop him.

Hua Rufeng quickly forced Xie Tianyu back with a slap and flew straight into the ancient tomb.

Feng Xiyun also became anxious. She looked at Zhuge Yueyue and said, “”Sister Yueyue, there’s still no news about Teacher. Should we enter the tomb first?”

After thinking for a while, Zhuge Yueyue made up her mind.

After all, such an opportunity was rare, so who could resist these temptations?

Moreover, almost all of the geniuses from the other forces had already started to move. If they hesitated for too long, then they would lose the initiative.

“Let’s go!”

As soon as she finished speaking, Zhuge Yueyue led Feng Xiyun toward the entrance. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The only one left was Su Changhe, who had yet to recover from his serious injuries and was still weak.

If he were to rush into the ancient tomb carelessly, he would probably die.

With Zhuge Yueyue leading the way, they arrived at the entrance without too much trouble.

Along the way, there were a few slightly famous geniuses who wanted to stop the two, but they were all forced to retreat.

Thanks to Zhuge Yueyue, Feng Xiyun did not feel any pressure at all. However, once they entered the ancient tomb, they were sent to different areas as their cultivation realms differed.

Even though Zhuge Yueyue was anxious and wanted nothing more than to find Feng Xiyun, this was not something she could resolve at the moment, so she refocused her attention on her surroundings.

After roughly scanning the surroundings, she finally saw an ancient door in the blood-red sea in the distance. Rays of light appeared from the door.

“A supreme treasure!”

Zhuge Yueyue’s eyes were burning with passion. She stared at one of the treasures and chased after it.

However, just as Zhuge Yueyue was about to get her hands on the treasure, a man in a white robe suddenly appeared on her left.

The man launched an attack at Zhuge Yueyue without any hesitation and almost succeeded.

Fortunately, Zhuge Yueyue was quick and agile, so she managed to avoid the attack.

Taking a look at the white-robed man, Zhuge Yueyue frowned, her gaze gradually turning cold.

She did not know who this man was, but his cultivation level was similar to hers.

“Haha, beautiful sister, I’ve had my eye on this treasure for a long time. May I ask if you can give it up?”

Liu Feng twirled his long hair with confidence and even winked at Zhuge Yueyue. A lustful expression was on his face.

As the chief disciple of the Dry Mountain Divine sect, Liu Feng had always thought himself to be extremely charming.

After all, when he was in the sect, almost every female disciple was in love with him, which is why he believed that Zhuge Yueyue would fall for him like the others.

However, unexpectedly, a sharp sword beam came flashing over.

Seeing this, Liu Feng’s face turned pale and he hurriedly dodged. He was burning with anger.

This stinky girl actually ignored his charms!

He then said in a cold tone, “You stinky girl, you really don’t know what’s good for you. Today, I’ll let you witness how powerful I am!”

Ever since he had become the chief disciple of the Dry Mountain Divine sect, he had never been humiliated like this before.

As the Dry Mountain Divine sect was from the Haihan divine empire, he was not very familiar with the local forces here.

He did not recognize who Zhuge Yueyue was, or would he be able to recognize Ye Xuan.

In his opinion, no matter who provoked him, there was only death.

However, Zhuge Yueyue said in disdain, “Tsk, you brainless thing. I’ve heard plenty of people say that countless times!”

Zhuge Yueyue was already numb to the experience, as she had long noticed that those with real strength would never say such words, but would simply let their strength do the talking for them.

“Damn it!”

Liu Feng’s rage skyrocketed. Without hesitation, he activated his magical wheel artifact and started attacking.

Seeing this, Zhuge Yueyue’s expression was still very calm. She raised the Cloud Sky Sword and responded in kind, which forced Liu Feng to retreat continuously.

She began to press her attack to secure the victory, slashing at him again and again.

The current Zhuge Yueyue was no longer the same as before. Even against cultivators of the same level, she had the determination to win.

Her confidence came from Ye Xuan’s teachings, her hard work, and the many divine powers she had cultivated.

After several exchanges, Liu Feng had already understood that if he continued to drag this out, defeat was the only possibility. For this reason, his face had already turned pale.

“Who are you?”

Cold sweat kept dripping down his face.

...

He had traveled a long way from the Haihan divine empire to this place to show off his power and defeat the geniuses here, yet had already stumbled upon such a strong opponent.

How could he not panic?
