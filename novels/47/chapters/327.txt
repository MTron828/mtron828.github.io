328 Getting Stronger (Part 1)

In the darkness of the spatial turbulence stood an ancient tower.

This was the Imprisonment Divine Tower that Ye Xuan had obtained earlier.

After a year, Ye Xuan had already reaped sufficient cultivation resources and heavenly treasures from his disciples.

“Your special constitutions have reached a bottleneck. I will help you strengthen them now,” Ye Xuan said to his disciples.

During this year, his disciples had all obtained their own opportunities and obtained heavenly treasures that could strengthen their respective special constitutions.

Ye Xuan had also randomly found an excuse to give the heavenly treasures Li Qingyan and Zhao Yuyan had found for their special constitutions to Yue and Shangguan Wan’er, multiplying them.

As for the heavenly treasures that could strengthen Yue’s sword jade body, Ye Xuan had a lot of them. In addition, Shangguan Wan’er was about to awaken a Sword Dao special constitution as well.

Heavenly Sword Spirit Flower…

Yue took out the heavenly treasure she had obtained.

Fire Spirit Divine Core, Water of Life…

Li Qingyan did the same.

Heavenly Devouring Demonic Core…

Zhao Yuyan also took out a heavenly treasure that could strengthen her Demon Devourer Body.

Ye Xuan flicked his sleeve, and his spiritual power swept out and wrapped itself around these heavenly treasures.

Within just a few seconds, Ye Xuan had completely refined them.

“Open your mouths,” he said to Yue, Qingyan and Yan’er.

Moments later, liquid formed from the spiritual energy of these heavenly treasures entered their mouths..

At the same time, Ye Xuan’s powerful spiritual sense also entered their bodies and started breaking down the spiritual energy into smaller components.

After some time, the three completely refined the medicinal power of the heavenly treasures.

Then, a series of system notifications rang out in Ye Xuan’s mind.

“Ding! As the host has helped his disciple obtain 36,500 days’ worth of cultivation, the host has received a 20x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained 730,000 days’ worth of cultivation!”

“Ding! As the host has helped his disciple strengthen her special constitution by 10x, the host has received a 2x critical reward. Congratulations! The host’s special constitution has been strengthened by 20x!”

“Ding! Thanks to the help of the host, his disciple has comprehended fourth-level sword intent. The host has received a randomized 3,988x critical reward. Congratulations! The host’s sword profound pattern has reached the ninth level!”

This was the system’s rewards that Ye Xuan had received from Yue.

In an instant, a powerful aura suddenly gushed out of Ye Xuan’s body, and his physical strength was greatly improved again.

Ye Xuan’s eyes lit up. His physical strength had surpassed the Heavenly King realm!

‘Ninth-level sword profound pattern! I’ve struck it rich!’

Fortunately, Ye Xuan’s spiritual sense was extremely powerful, so he was able to contain the sudden increase in power.

“Ding! As the host has helped his disciple obtain 262,800 days’ worth of cultivation, the host has received a 28x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained 73,584,000 days’ worth of cultivation!”

“Ding! As the host has helped his disciple strengthen her special constitution by 6x, the host has received a 2x critical reward. Congratulations! The host’s special constitution has been strengthened by 12x!”

“Ding! Thanks to the help of the host, his disciple has comprehended first-level fire intent. The host has received a randomized 99x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has comprehended third-level fire intent!”

“Ding! Thanks to the help of the host, his disciple has comprehended first-level wood intent. The host has received a randomized 328 critical reward. Congratulations! The host has comprehended fifth-level wood intent!”

These rewards were from Li Qingyan, and Ye Xuan’s strength instantly skyrocketed again.

Even after the cultivation boost reward was converted, it was still 2,016 days’ worth of cultivation for Ye Xuan.

“Ding! As the host has helped his disciple obtain 1,204,500 days’ worth of cultivation, the host has received a 33x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained 39,748,500 days’ worth of cultivation!”

“Ding! As the host has helped his disciple strengthen her special constitution by 7x, the host has received a 3x critical reward. Congratulations! The host’s special constitution has been strengthened by 21x!”

Unfortunately, even though Zhao Yuyan had successfully strengthened her Demon Devourer Body, she had not successfully comprehended devouring intent.

However, Ye Xuan had now broken through to the Saint King realm!

Yue’s sword jade body had reached the perfection stage, while Li Qingyan’s dual spirit body had reached the minor master stage.

As Zhao Yuyan’s Demon Devourer Body was too powerful, this round of strengthening did not allow it to reach the minor mastery stage.

Still, their strength had improved, and they now needed to temper their spiritual sense once more to regain full control of their power.

“Next, I will increase your innate bone values,” Ye Xuan said.

After that, his disciples each took out the heavenly treasures they had found, and after refining it, Ye Xuan was rewarded with another series of system notifications. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Ding! As the host has helped his disciple to increase her innate bone value by 30, the host has received a randomized 8x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained 240 innate bone value points!”

After the attribute division penalty due to Ye Xuan’s innate bone value having surpassed 800, these 240 points were only worth 24 points for him, which was a 10:1 ratio. Still, an improvement was an improvement.
