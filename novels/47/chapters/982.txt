Chapter 983 - 983 Great Battle!

Almost all the experts who had rushed over looked furious. After all, these fallen geniuses could be said to be the hope of their sects. It was the existence of these talented disciples that made the era even more brilliant.

In the struggle for the path of immortality, perhaps a portion of disciples would die, but the vast majority of disciples would be able to fight their way and emerge as pillars of their sects.

If they died in a battle with their peers, they could only blame themselves for being incompetent.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

However, it was different now. The Dark King was simply slaughtering geniuses and the future of an entire era!

This newly-emerged Dark King wanted to kill all of these talented disciples to strengthen his Dark clan, so how could they let this matter go?

If he really succeeded, then the cultivation world of the entire Mystic World would probably be set back thousands of years.

If these geniuses were really killed, who would support this era when the older generation gradually grew old and passed away?

This was why Gao Shun had stood up without any hesitation to curse the Dark King hysterically. It was not only him, as the others immediately followed suit.

“Haha! Daoist Gao of the Great Wilderness Divine sect is right. Are you so proud of yourself just because you can suppress these juniors? If you really have the ability, then come and deal with us, the older generation!”

After saying this, a thin old man also flung his sleeves and started to stretch his body.

“Old Demon, I haven’t exercised my muscles for more than a hundred years. Today, you’ve successfully provoked the anger of the older generation.”

Hearing these shouts, the young geniuses present were extremely excited. Help had arrived!

The helplessness they felt earlier dissipated. Honestly, it was not something that they wanted to experience again.

Seeing this scene, the Dark King frowned. However, he soon regained his composure. No matter what, he was confident in his own combat strength.

“Haha, interesting, interesting. Do you really want to be my enemy?”

After hearing these words, Gao Shun started cursing again.

“So what if I’m your enemy? Do you think I’m scared?”

At this moment, these experts could no longer suppress the anger in their hearts, and wanted to attack immediately.

If the Nine-tailed Sparrow had not noticed the situation here in time, perhaps all of the genius disciples would have been slain by this b*stard.

It just so happened that the Nine-tailed Sparrow had passed by this place as she was searching for treasures in other places in the ancient palace.

However, when she was about to rush to the upper level, she sensed the movement of the old man from the Immortal Divine sect as he escaped the cage, and thus came over to investigate.

After examining the cage for a while, she realized that a terrifying massacre was happening inside. Then, as she was about to leave and call for reinforcements, she happened to meet Ye Xuan and the others who had just escaped from the cave, so she told Ye Xuan about this matter.

Then, she hurriedly ran over and called for the top experts of the other sects and forces to hurry over and help.

After returning to the scene, she immediately used her innate ability to break the seal keeping the cage from outside interference.

The atmosphere here became even more solemn at this moment. After many experts from the various forces discovered that their sect’s genius disciples had already suffered casualties, each and every one of them looked furious.

Looking at their angry faces, the Dark King was not afraid at all. He even laughed out loud.

Then, he stretched his muscles and bones, making crackling sounds. Then, he said teasingly, “Alright, since things have come to this, bring it on!”

“Back then, they worked together like you to seal me here in this dark place!”

“Our Dark clan has returned to the Mystic World this time to take revenge on you. You are the descendants of that generation. Since they are no longer around, you will bear my wrath in their place!”

As soon as he finished speaking, an extremely terrifying aura instantly spread out, causing everyone to feel a chill. A great battle was about to begin!

However, due to the cooperation of many experts, the scene was no longer a one-sided massacre like before.

“Hehehe, let’s fight a refreshing battle today.”

“I have already forgotten how long it has been since I last fought seriously. Today, I will let you see just how powerful I was in my prime!”

The scene instantly became chaotic. Many members of the Great Wilderness Divine sect immediately joined the battle and joined forces to kill the strange monsters.

However, while everyone was busy fighting, only two people remained where they were. They were Ye Xuan and the Dark King.
After sizing each other up for a moment, the Dark King finally spoke.

“This is interesting. I seem to sense an extremely familiar feeling from your body. It seems to be from an old acquaintance of mine.”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan couldn’t help but smile and say, “Hehe, is that so? “Why do I sense a lingering fear in your eyes? You should be quite afraid of this old acquaintance, right?”

The Dark King was instantly filled with anger and gritted his teeth and roared, “Shut up! I’m the Nether King, omnipotent throughout heaven and earth. Who is qualified to make me afraid?”

Ye Xuan waved his hand and said casually, “Oh? But your situation makes me think otherwise. I mean, if you were omnipotent, you wouldn’t be stuck behind that seal, right? Hahaha!”

After hearing this, the Dark King did not get angry. Instead, he smiled and looked at Ye Xuan silently.

He had discovered earlier that Ye Xuan had already reached the eternal realm. If his strength was at its peak, he would definitely be able to easily defeat Ye Xuan with one hand. However, he could not do so now.
