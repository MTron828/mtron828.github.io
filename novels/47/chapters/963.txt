Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

As if reading his mind, the Forbidden Lord instantly laughed out loud.

“Young man, do you know what I just discovered?”

“Oh? What?”

Ye Xuan felt even more confused at this moment, and thought that this person might have a screw loose. Otherwise, his train of thought would not be so scattered and all over the place. What was even going on in his head?RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

The Forbidden Lord did not care about what Ye Xuan was thinking at the moment. Instead, he spoke in a low voice, “I was divining your future just now. After countless years, I can only see a lonely back standing on the top of a ten -thousand -meter mountain… ”

“If I’m not wrong, you’ll become one of the great movers of fate. Young man, I’m looking forward to your future.”

This was what the Forbidden Lord thought of Ye Xuan. However, after hearing his words, Ye Xuan felt a little surprised. However, this did little to alleviate his confusion.

“What do you mean by mover of fate? What kind of future did you see? Can you be more detailed?”

The Forbidden Lord waved his hand and replied, “Absolutely impossible.”

“After all, you are too weak at the moment. If I tell you, it will only result in your death.”

Then, the Forbidden Lord seemed to have smelled a familiar smell, and his eyes were filled with shock.

After a long while, he returned to his normal demeanor and continued, “In your body, I seem to detect the scent of an old friend. From this, it seems that some things are destined.”

After saying this, the Forbidden Lord laughed presumptuously again, which sounded extremely jarring in this quiet space.

However, Ye Xuan’s hair stood on end, and his heart was filled with doubts.

The scent of an old friend?

Who was it? What was going on?

Ye Xuan was completely befuddled, and could only stare blankly, waiting for some sort of explanation. However, instead of explaining, the Forbidden Lord’s gaze suddenly turned sharp, and then unleashed a wave of terrifying energy toward Ye Xuan.

“Oh no!”

As Ye Xuan was currently in the form of a soul, he was unable to unleash his full strength. He immediately tried to dodge, but soon realized that he had been firmly restrained and caught by the Forbidden Lord.

At this moment, Ye Xuan despaired, and he felt that he was done for. This fellow was too powerful!

No matter how much he struggled, it was to no avail. Even though the Forbidden Lord was imprisoned and restrained, he could still unleash far more power in this state than Ye Xuan. Even if Ye Xuan’s true body had been here, the result would have been the same.

Ye Xuan was even more confused. Would such a powerful person really be easily imprisoned here?

However, after a while, Ye Xuan realized that the Forbidden Lord did not hurt him. Instead, the latter was transmitting power into his body.

“What is he doing?”

Ye Xuan was extremely surprised. After all, he could clearly sense that the power that the Forbidden Lord was transmitting into his body was extremely terrifying.

At this time, the Forbidden Lord said unhurriedly, “Don’t panic. Haha, I just wanted to test your talent. It won’t harm you in any way.”

After a moment of investigation, a bright smile appeared on the face of the Forbidden Lord. Then, he said, “You’ve reached the sealed immortal realm, and haven’t reached the eternal realm. That’s good.”

“What are you talking about?”

Ye Xuan’s face was filled with confusion. Why did he make it sound like that was a good thing?

The Forbidden Lord did not hide anything and said, “To step into the eternal realm from the sealed immortal realm, one must be purified by the aura of the Immortal Dao.”

“This is something that everyone knows. Almost everyone does it.”

“However, the ancestors had once walked a very long distance on this path, only to realize that this path was blocked in the end, and there was no way to continue cultivating.”

“And this is the fundamental reason why we are unable to escape the eternal tribulation. During the countless years that I was imprisoned here, I was also constantly thinking about how to deal with it in order to break through the final stages.”

“With the passage of time, I eventually gained some insight into the matter. In my opinion, the most important thing to transcend the eternal tribulation is the breakthrough to this realm.”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan’s eyes became much more serious. It was no wonder he had been feeling unusually uneasy in his heart recently and had never dared to take that last step and break through.

So it turned out that there was something unusual about this realm. What exactly was this eternal tribulation? However, he knew that he would not get specifics on this, as the Forbidden Lord had said that he was not strong enough to know yet.

The atmosphere at the scene froze once again. Ye Xuan’s eyes were still fixed on the Forbidden Lord, waiting for him to continue speaking.

As time passed, the Forbidden Lord seemed to have calculated something new and said with a smile.

“Dao of Reincarnation? This is interesting.”

“Based on the current situation, I’m not the only one who has discovered the problem.”

It was not clear what he had figured out, but the Forbidden Lord once again focused his attention on Ye Xuan and said, “Young man, I have great expectations for you.” “In my opinion, your future will be bright, but you have to make a choice now.”

“Oh? What choice?”

Ye Xuan’s curiosity was piqued, and he waited quietly for the Forbidden Lord to speak.

“I won’t hide it from you. After our generation’s continuous exploration and experiments, we have already realized that the path we used to cultivate can’t be continued.”

“After experiencing the eternal tribulation, we, the experts who were lucky enough to survive, have been thinking about how we can safely survive the eternal tribulation.”

“Due to this, I didn’t hesitate to spend several eras searching for a new cultivation path.”

At this moment, Ye Xuan held his breath. Was the Forbidden Lord going to teach him this new path?

In fact, Ye Xuan was also very eager for a top expert to guide him.. After all, the cultivation path he had to tread in the future was too mysterious…
