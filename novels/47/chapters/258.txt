Chapter 259: Possession

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Could this be the opportunity Qian Daoliu was talking about?”

The master of the Blood Moon Temple frowned after examining his surroundings.

His spiritual sense had detected nothing strange about the cave. There was also a distinct lack of any spiritual energy fluctuations here.

What resources would there be here?

However, just as he was hesitating, something strange happened.

Buzzzzzz!

A ray of red light suddenly burst out of the cave and shot toward his forehead.

His expression changed drastically upon seeing this.

The spiritual power in his body swept out and turned into an extremely sturdy energy barrier!

However, the ray of light penetrated his energy barrier effortlessly and entered his sea of consciousness.

“Damn it! I’vebeen tricked!”

“Keke! I can’t believe you couldn’t resist the temptation and came here!”

A strange voice rang out in his mind.

A soul that was surrounded by strands of blood qi appeared within his sea of consciousness.

“You are Qian Daoliu?”

“Qian Daoliu? Not really, but I guess you’re used to calling me that.”

“I didn’t expect that my clone would only find someone like you after sleeping for hundreds of years. However, it’s better than nothing!”

“You’re too weak. Even if I forcefully possess you, I will only be able to engrave two profound patterns from your martial intents at most. That won’t be enough to kill Ye Xuan!”

“It seems that I have to personally kill him!”

Ripples appeared around the blood-red soul.

Moments later, the master of the Blood Moon Temple’s sea of consciousness turned upside down, and a great battle between the two souls broke out.

His physical body stood on the spot like a statue.

After about five minutes, his dull eyes suddenly lit up.

“This body is still too weak. I can’t unleash my true strength at all!”

His eyes were filled with disdain.

He had used the same method to take over Qian Daoliu’s body in the past.

“Ye Xuan!”

Murderous intent flashed across his eyes.

When Qian Daoliu died, he had received all of his clone’s memories, and naturally knew what had happened in the Nanzhou Region.

“It’s all the Moonstar Saint’s fault! If it wasn’t for this damn thing suppressing me, I would have already wiped Ye Xuan out!”

“However, I must act as soon as possible!”

“If Ye Xuan successfully passes the lightning tribulation and reaches the lightning tribulation realm, his future achievements will definitely surpass the Moonstar Saint’s!”

“I cannot allow this to happen!”

“It seems that I can only kill Ye Xuan if I combine all of my clones!”

“If that’s the case, I’ll wait in the Luoyun Region!”

“I head over to the lightning tribulation mystic realm and see if I can devour more experts!”

Thinking this, he sat down cross-legged and slowly regulated the power in his body.

He had just taken over this body, so he had to get used to it.

At that time, he could also make use of his main body’s comprehension of the natural laws to help this clone break through to the pattern condensation realm.

He had arrived at this mountain range hundreds of years ago. However, the clone he had taken over at that time was destroyed, and the soul he had transformed into was also severely injured.

He had no choice but to slumber in this cave for hundreds of years.

Were it not for Qian Daoliu’s death, this slumbering soul would not have been woken up.

Three days passed in a flash.

Not only had he completely stabilized his body, but he had also broken through to the pattern condensation realm!

“I’ve finally engraved two profound patterns,” he mumbled to himself before turning into a streak of light and disappearing.

When he reappeared, he was holding the Blood Moon divine sword in his hand, with which he tore space apart and disappeared.

As soon as he entered the spatial crack, he noticed a mysterious light outside the spatial turbulence.

This was the entrance to the lightning tribulation mystic realm.

Although the mystic realm had yet to open, any cultivator above the ninth level of the unity realm could rely on their own strength to forcefully tear space apart and enter the mystic realm.

After all, there was a legendary supreme intent in there, and those experts would naturally not miss the opportunity to comprehend it.

His goal was very simple. He wanted to devour all of these powerful beings to increase his own strength.

Buzzzzzz!

He forcefully tore space apart and entered the mystic realm.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Inside, he saw endless bolts of lightning that seemed to threaten to tear the whole world apart.

Having been tempered by the power of lightning all year round, the huge mountains had already transformed into purple mountain peaks that were filled with the power of lightning.

“Eh?”

At this moment, his gaze focused on a huge mountain peak.

He saw a woman in white sitting on the mountain peak. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“This woman doesn’t seem to be simple!”

“She looks so young, but seems to already have reached the ninth level of the unity realm. Is she another monster like Ye Xuan?”

“It’s better to test her first!”

The lady in white did not reveal her abilities, so he could not be sure of her exact strength.

However, his goal in coming here was to devour powerful cultivators, so he would not pass up this opportunity.

If that woman’s true strength was only equivalent to a single-pattern condensation realm expert, she would not be able to escape today.

However, if she was stronger, then he would have to give up.

He turned into a streak of light and headed toward the lady in white.

“Get lost!”

Just as he made his move, the white-robed lady’s tightly shut eyes suddenly opened. Cold killing intent flashed across the depths of her eyes.

His expression changed when he saw this, and he hurriedly turned to retreat.

However, just as she closed her eyes slowly again, he suddenly turned around and attacked with destructive sword qi.
