945 Harvesting Treasures

At this moment, the Thunder-Devouring Beast became a little unscrupulous. After all, in his opinion, with his big brother protecting him, he could take on the world!

After blustering, the Thunder-Devouring Beast dug out the flood dragon’s inner core without hesitation and consumed it instantly.

In the blink of an eye, dark clouds appeared in the sky again. This inner core contained the crystallization of the flood dragon’s tens of thousands of years of cultivation. However, it was completely refined by the Thunder-Devouring Beast, causing his aura to undergo a significant change.

Even Ye Xuan was extremely surprised by this.

He could clearly sense the huge changes that were happening. The Thunder-Devouring Beast’s cultivation level was constantly increasing, and was about to reach the late stage of the eternal realm.

It was not only that. The divine runes in the flood dragon’s body were also refined by the Thunder-Devouring Beast, which strengthened his own defense and increased his combat strength.

Ye Xuan was already dumbfounded. He really did not expect this fellow to seize the initiative and reap the benefits. He had done all the work, yet this fellow was the one who made out like a bandit.

Furthermore, the Thunder-Devouring Beast had stolen the limelight too. It was simply too much!

On the other side, after consuming the flood dragon’s inner core, the Thunder-Devouring Beast’s body was releasing even more dazzling purple light. Then, his body began to shrink rapidly, shrinking from its original height of 100 meters to two meters.

However, he did not transform. Perhaps in his heart, he felt that his original appearance was too handsome, so he did not transform into a human.

While the Thunder-Devouring Beast was still intoxicated by his own appearance, Ye Xuan leaned over unhappily and said, “Little Thunder, you should know that it’s not good for one person to monopolize the benefits.”

Hearing Ye Xuan’s words, the Thunder-Devouring Beast’s heart instantly tightened and he immediately spoke.

“Big brother, this isn’t what you think it is. After all, the inner core in this fellow’s body originally belonged to me.”

“When I was sleeping, this little worm sneaked over and attacked me, taking my inner core.”

After hearing what he said, Ye Xuan felt a little better. After all, he did not like being taken advantage of.

“Alright, next time, you should tell me first.” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

After saying this, Ye Xuan looked at the huge corpse, examining it for treasures.

No matter what, this corpse belonged to an eternal realm expert, and also contained traces of divine dragon bloodline. There was no way he was going to let it go to waste.

While Ye Xuan was still frowning and looking around, Yanran came forward and said calmly, “This little worm’s scales are quite good. I’ll take these and forge a set of armor for each of your disciples.”

Before Ye Xuan could open his mouth to say anything, she got to work. In a short while, she had already taken off all the scales.

After arranging these scales into categories, Yanran opened her mouth and said, “These scales can be used with some ice-type and fire-type treasures to make a good defensive armor for Xiyun and Yueyue.”

It had to be said that it was really great to have a wife like Yanran, who was constantly thinking about his disciples.

After hearing this, Ye Xuan thought for a moment before saying weakly, “Just the two of them?”

After hearing this, Yanran was stunned. She said, “Isn’t it just right?”

After Ye Xuan pondered for a moment before saying, “In fact, I have another disciple, Xiang Yun. She is already eight years old.”

Yanran was a little surprised, as she did not know about Xiang Yun, and had only met Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun. She liked these two disciples very much.

However, she had never seen Ye Xuan’s youngest disciple before, and was thus wondering if his third disciple was as likable as the other two.

After thinking for a moment, Yanran did not speak. She once again took her knife and approached the flood dragon’s corpse, wanting to take more parts away to refine a treasure for Xiang Yun.

The flood dragon was really too pitiful. Even though it had already passed away, its corpse was being desecrated and harvested.

“Big Brother, has Sister-in-law always been like this?”

After seeing Yanran take action without saying a word, happily carving up body parts, the Thunder-Devouring Beast was frightened and approached Ye Xuan to whisper a question.

He could still clearly remember the scene of Yanran beating him up, and the experience had scarred him.

Ye Xuan looked at him and said, “Is there a problem? Do you have a problem with her?”

“Uh… No, I just find it very strange. How did you manage to win over such a powerful lady like Sister-in-law?”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan smiled and replied, “Isn’t that easy? As long as you master my flirting skills, I believe you can do it in the future.”

“You’re not lying to me, right?”

The Thunder-Devouring Beast instantly became excited. While they were discussing this in whispers, the Nine-tailed Sparrow flew over to them.

When the Thunder-Devouring Beast turned around to take a look and saw that it was her, he immediately changed his temperament and became mighty and domineering.

“Beautiful Nine-tailed Sparrow lady, is there anything I can help you with?” the Thunder-Devouring Beast asked politely.

However, the Nine-tailed Sparrow ignored him completely. Instead, she went straight to Ye Xuan and bowed.

“Thank you, Benefactor, for saving my life. I am extremely grateful for your kindness, though I also do not know how to thank you. If Benefactor, you…”

She suddenly stopped speaking at this. When Ye Xuan noticed the deep gratitude in her words, he was a little stunned.

Then, he turned to look at her and said, “There’s no need to thank me. It was my brother who wanted to save you.”
