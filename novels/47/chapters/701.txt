702 The Reincarnation Fairy’s Full Power (Part 1)

At this moment, the three disciples felt that they had hit the jackpot. However, before they could reach the treasured chair, the three of them also started fighting amongst each other.

Only Xiang Yun stood there in a daze. After all, her first sister had told her to stay put.

The location of the battle had already changed, shifting from the flat square on the summit to the path leading to the golden throne.

On the other side, after forcing the Reincarnation Fairy back with a palm strike, Zhuge Yueyue looked at the three people fighting in front of her and said angrily, “Get lost!”

As soon as she finished speaking, Zhuge Yueyue once again released an extremely terrifying aura. A hell emissary slowly condensed in the sky and pounced towards the three of them.

The three disciples immediately sensed that they could not handle this attack alone, so they worked together to block it.

However, they had not expected Zhuge Yueyue to still be in peak condition, while they themselves were still considerably injured after their fight with Xiang Yun.

As such

“Puchi!”

Zhuge Yueyue easily eliminated these three opponents with just one attack, ending their dreams of becoming champion. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Now, only the Reincarnation Fairy remained. Hua Rufeng shouted, “Junior Sister Zhuge, let me help you!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Hua Rufeng instantly activated his Great Desolation Divine technique and sent the Reincarnation Fairy flying backwards.

Zhuge Yueyue smiled at Hua Rufeng to express her gratitude. Then, she stepped on the path to the golden throne.

“Argh!”

The Reincarnation Fairy screamed. She was so close to becoming the champion, yet it seemed so far away.

She had been cultivating diligently all this while, all for the sake of winning, yet she could only helplessly as Zhuge Yueyue ascended the path to the golden throne.

How could she tolerate this?

Moments later, she released an extremely terrifying aura!

Under the influence of this aura, the path to the golden throne began to tremble. Then, jade lotuses condensed in the sky one after another.

“Uh…”

After seeing such a scene, the onlookers instantly opened their mouths in surprise and disbelief.

“I really didn’t expect that the Reincarnation Fairy had become the real Saintess. She has actually comprehended the Mystic Jade Lotus divine power!”

At this moment, the Reincarnation Fairy was standing on top of a jade lotus, looking like an actual fairy.

“So she had been holding back earlier?”

Seeing this, even Zhuge Yueyue was surprised. She had already heard her teacher mention this to her. If the Reincarnation Fairy wanted to become the real Saintess of the Jade Lake Divine sect, she had to successfully comprehend the Mystic Jade Lotus divine power.

However, over the past few hundred years, even though the sect master had spent a great deal of effort to nurture a Saintess, not a single one had been able to successfully comprehend it.

Unexpectedly, the Reincarnation Fairy had actually comprehended the supreme technique of the Jade Lake Divine sect.

Contrasted by the jade lotuses, the Reincarnation Fairy released a suffocating aura.

“I was right. She has really comprehended the secret technique of the Jade Lake Divine sect,” Mu Beichen muttered.

He felt somewhat dejected. After all, he had always been regarded as the number one genius in the East continent. However, today, he had discovered that he was inferior to both Zhuge Yueyue and the Reincarnation Fairy.

Mu Beichen smiled bitterly. Then, he turned his gaze back to the screen.

At this moment, the Reincarnation Fairy was still unleashing the endless power in her body. Even Hua Rufeng, who had just fought her, turned pale.

He had thought that he had fought her evenly earlier, but now he realized that he had overestimated himself.

On the other side, Zhuge Yueyue frowned when she saw the Reincarnation Fairy in the sky. She then closed her eyes.

“So this is her full power”

Feeling this pressure, she held the Cloud Sky Sword even tighter in her hand. Things were not looking good.

However, at this moment, she could see the golden throne not far away from her.

If she gave up now, would she not be a coward? How could she face her teacher then? This was not the time to cower!

Thinking this, her gaze became determined once again, and she instantly released waves of icy cold sword aura, causing the wind and clouds to surge in all directions.
