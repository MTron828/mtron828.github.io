585 The Crown Prince Arrives (Part 1)

Out of consideration for the safety of the people in Qingyang City, han Sikong decisively stood up to dissuade them. After all, he was well aware of how powerful supreme realm experts were.

Ye Xuan could easily annihilate Qingyang City in its entirety with a wave of his hand.

As a resident of Qingyang City for many years, he had some feelings for the place and was not willing to watch the city be destroyed.

Ye Xuan glanced at Han Sikong. Seeing that this person was sincere and had helped him a lot, he decided to restrain himself.

!!

However, he still said openly, “Han Sikong, I’m giving you three minutes to settle this.”

If you can’t handle it within this time, then I’ll take action myself.”

“Don’t worry, Sir. I won’t let you down.”

After hearing this, Han Sikong was finally relieved.

He was not afraid of Prince Zhanglu at all. The only thing he was afraid of was Ye Xuan getting angry.

If it really came down to that, how many people would die? The citizens would likely be spared, but these innocent soldiers might be caught in the crossfire simply because they were doing their duty.

He rushed over to Li Kun and Prince Zhanglu, and said firmly, “I definitely won’t let you have your way. If you really have the ability, then come at me!”

At this moment, the atmosphere was tense, and everyone could tell that a battle could break out at any moment. Neither side was willing to take a step back.

Just then, another group of soldiers rushed over, and followed by an extremely luxurious carriage. Everyone could tell that the carriage carried another member of the royal family.

“What exactly is happening? Why is there another one coming over?”

The crowd was very surprised and looked over in unison. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Everyone’s attention was drawn to the newcomer.

Who was he?

As the carriage came to a halt, a young man alighted from it. He looked poised and dignified.

After seeing this person, everyone’s expressions changed drastically.

“The Crown Prince of the Yangli divine empire!”

Feng Tianyi’s expression was dark as he quickly walked towards Ye Xuan.

When Feng Lu saw that the Crown Prince had come over, he thought that the latter was here to help him. He smiled so brightly that the corners of his lips reached his ears.

Just as he was about to go up and pay his respects to the Crown Prince, the Crown Prince walked past him without any hesitation and directly walked over to Ye Xuan.

Upon seeing this, both Feng Lu and Li Kun’s faces turned pale.

“Greetings, Chief Ye Xuan. I am the Crown Prince of the Yangli divine empire. You can call me Tianyi,” Feng Tianyi greeted Ye Xuan politely when he walked up to him.

At this moment, as the Crown Prince, he was also sweating profusely and feeling extremely nervous.

However, he also felt lucky. After all, he had made it in time. Otherwise, their Yangli divine empire might have faced complete destruction.

Unlike Feng Lu, Feng Tianyi had a much better grasp of the news from the cultivation world. Furthermore, they had met once.

It had been totally out of his expectations that Feng Lu would provoke this monster.

“Brother Tianyi!”

After seeing Feng Tianyi, Feng Xiyun immediately smiled and walked over to him.

This was her big brother, and she had been on very good terms with him since they were young. He had doted on her very much.

Feng Tianyi also rubbed Feng Xiyun’s head and asked with a smile, “Xiyun, we haven’t seen each other for a long time. How have you been recently?”

Feng Xiyun smiled sweetly and replied, “Brother, don’t worry. Teacher and Sister Yueyue treat me very well. I’ve never been better.”

“En, that’s great.”

“I was planning to visit you at Cloud Sky peak soon, but it seems that there’s no need for that now.”

After saying this, Feng Tianyi’s face darkened again. He gritted his teeth in anger when he thought about the disaster that Feng Lu had almost brought upon the Yangli divine empire.

Did these two brainless people not know how much trouble they had caused?

“Chief Ye Xuan, I’m really sorry. My uncle was indeed reckless and rude just now. I would like to apologize on his behalf.”

Ye Xuan looked at Feng Tianyi calmly, but he was inwardly shocked.

It had not been long since they last met, yet the fate energy surrounding the Crown Prince had actually become far more dense.

‘This is quite interesting. If he rises to power, the Yangli divine empire will welcome an era of rapid development and prosperity!’

Before Ye Xuan could say anything, Feng Lu interjected with an annoyed expression, “Yi ‘er, what are you doing? Don’t you think you’re on the wrong side?”

His heart was filled with anger. He did not understand why the Crown Prince would help Ye Xuan at this time.

He was Feng Tianyi’s uncle.

Could it be that this young man’s background was really so terrifying?

After hearing what Fenglu said, Feng Tianyi looked at him and said mercilessly, “Shut up! Who are you to call me Yi’er? Address me by my proper title!”

At that moment, Feng Lu broke out in a cold sweat.

Feng Tianyi’s meaning was very clear.

He was the Crown Prince of the Yangli divine empire, and the future emperor.

Under normal circumstances, even if he was a prince, he would still have to bow to the Crown Prince with respect.

However, because they were usually very easy-going, they did not pay much attention to etiquette between members of the royal family.

In this situation, their relationship was null and void, and only Feng Tianyi’s status as Crown Prince mattered.

Feng Lu was even more confused. Feng Tianyi had said such harsh words to him because of Ye Xuan?
