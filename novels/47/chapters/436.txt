437 Sacrifice

“Teacher, this technique is awesome!”

“Don’t worry, teacher. I’ll definitely use this technique to make you proud,” Zhuge Yueyue said with a serious face.

After that, Zhuge Yueyue planned to practice it a few more times, but was interrupted by Ye Xuan.

“My precious disciple, although the Heavenly Slash is powerful, it’s not the strongest technique!”

!!

“…”

What did Teacher mean by this? Could it be that there was an even more powerful technique he would teach her?

At the thought of this, Zhuge Yueyue’s eyes brightened as she looked at Ye Xuan with anticipation.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan smiled and said, “In this round of the Seven Peaks competition, you will represent Cloud Sky peak. After all, your junior sister has only just joined us, and her cultivation is still lacking. The competition is just a training experience for her.”

“As such, where Cloud Sky peak ranks is all up to you. I’ve thought about it for a long time, and in order to increase your chances of winning, I’ve decided to teach you an even more powerful technique!”

Zhuge Yueyue was elated when she heard this. Her teacher truly thought about and considered everything.

Immediately, she patted her chest and said, “Don’t worry, Teacher. I won’t let you down. As long as I’m here, Cloud Sky peak will never lose to Hidden Sword peak!”

“Very good!” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Ye Xuan was very satisfied with her answer. Then, he walked over to her and reached out to touch her forehead, transmitting a technique into her mind.

When Zhuge Yueyue sifted through the information in her mind, she was completely dumbfounded.

“Oh my God, it’s actually a heaven-grade divine power, Hell Slash …”

“Hiss!”

Zhuge Yueyue sucked in a breath of cold air. Her eyes were filled with shock.

This divine power was greater than anything she had ever cultivated before. Furthermore, the divine power would be enhanced by her Nine Serenities of Frost divine power.

She would likely be able to challenge those who were five minor cultivation realms higher with this.

“Many thanks, Teacher!”

Zhuge Yueyue knelt down in front of Ye Xuan to express her gratitude.

Where would one find a teacher as good as Ye Xuan in the mystic world? Even her parents would not be as kind and as generous.

Ye Xuan chuckled. The spiritual power in his body turned into a warm current that helped Zhuge Yueyue up.

“Silly girl, although this divine power is powerful, it’s also very difficult to cultivate a heaven-grade divine power.”

“You have to cultivate well these few days. As long as you can cultivate it to the minor mastery stage, it will be enough for you to handle this Seven Peaks competition.”

“Yes, Teacher!”

Zhuge Yueyue nodded respectfully.

Ye Xuan was about to leave, but then thought of something and turned around with a smile on his face. It just so happened that the cooldown period for spiritual power infusion had ended for Zhuge Yueyue.

It was time to reap more rewards.

He walked over to her and said gently, “My dear disciple, I’ve just thought about it carefully again. There are many experts in the Seven Peaks competition. Although you’ve already broken through to the second level of the materialization realm, you haven’t been cultivating for very long in comparison to the other disciples.”

“As such, I’ve decided to perform spiritual power infusion on you again.”

This stunned her.

“What…? Spirit… Spiritual power infusion?”

Why?

Zhuge Yueyue felt guilty and worried.

It was common knowledge that spiritual power infusion consumed the cultivation of the person who was performing it. If one was not careful, it might even affect one’s own cultivation foundation.

Zhuge Yueyue was clear that with her current strength, she could withstand much more of Ye Xuan’s spiritual power than before.

However, this would require her teacher to consume more of his cultivation.

How could she damage her Teacher’s cultivation foundation to increase her own cultivation level?

No, she could not do it!

Seeing the resistance in Zhuge Yueyue’s eyes, Ye Xuan felt warm in his heart.

This girl’s character was not bad. Even in the face of the temptation of a breakthrough, she was still being considerate of him. She was indeed a good disciple!

However, if he did not perform spiritual power infusion, he would not obtain the system reward.

As such, he quickly said, “My precious disciple, don’t worry. Spiritual power infusion might be harmful to others, but to me, it’s just a trivial matter.”

“The constitution that I have awakened is different from others. It can minimize the side effects caused by spiritual power infusion.”

“Besides, isn’t it just a small sacrifice? As long as you can become stronger and be able to protect yourself in this world, my tiny sacrifice will be worth it!.

When Zhuge Yueyue heard this, she felt even more touched. Her tears were about to fall.

“Teacher…”

Zhuge Yueyue looked at Ye Xuan, her voice choked with sobs as she cried. Her pitiful appearance could make one’s heart ache.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan smiled gently and comforted her.

“Alright, you’re already an adult, yet you still like to cry. If you want to repay my kindness, then win the Seven Peaks competition.”

“Of course, I won’t force you. Just do what you can.”

Ye Xuan felt a little guilty. How could he bear to lie to such a kind and innocent girl?

However, he had no choice. For the sake of his great plan, he could only thicken his skin and continue acting.
