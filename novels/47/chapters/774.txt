775 Fallen Sect (Part 1)

However, at this moment, someone said with a puzzled expression, “This matter is somewhat confusing. The Supreme Divine sect had hidden themselves away from the get-go. How did they end up being attacked out of nowhere?”

“That’s right, that’s right. The Supreme Divine sect even activated a concealment formation. By right, those berserk beasts should have walked right past them!”

“Could something have happened within the sect itself?”

After hearing this, Ye Xuan instantly realized what was going on.

“This is really interesting…”

This almost certainly had something to do with Han Tai.

This guy was really ruthless. In order to take revenge for his arm, he had been biding his time this entire time, playing the part of a loyal disciple. No one had suspected him. However, once the perfect opportunity presented itself, he acted swiftly and decisively.

At this moment, after the defensive and concealment formations had collapsed, the Supreme Divine sect was being attacked by the berserk beasts, and there was death and destruction everywhere.

As he hovered in the sky above the sect, Daoist Black Iron spat out a few mouthfuls of blood after seeing this scene. He watched as the Supreme Divine sect that he had spent so much effort on was destroyed. He closed his eyes and fainted.

“Teacher!”

Not far away, Xie Tianyu shouted in panic. Now that the sect’s formations had been breached, the lives of the disciples were threatened.

However, their grandmaster, Gu Hao, had not hesitated for one second to escape with his disciple the moment the formations collapsed.

Only Daoist Black Iron remained, trying to defend the fruits of his years of hard work. However, now that even he was unable to fight, who could save the Supreme Divine sect?

Bestial roars were heard one after another. Soon, Xie Tianyu was surrounded by the beasts. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Seeing this, Xie Tianyu’s face turned pale. Fortunately, an elder intervened and saved his life.

However, this elder was also in now danger, and used the last vestiges of his strength to send Xie Tianyu out.

“Elder Hong!” Xie Tianyu shouted helplessly.

However, Elder Hong did not turn around. He blocked the incoming attacks for Xie Tianyu without hesitation and shouted with the last of his strength, “The wildfire may burn everything to the ground, but life will grow anew from the ashes. Leave quickly, and take the sect master with you.”

“We must preserve the Supreme Divine sect’s legacy and inheritance! There will be a chance to rise again in the future,” Elder Hong said fearlessly. Then, he dragged his injured body to hold back the berserk beasts.

Xie Tianyu clenched his fists tightly when he saw Elder Hong being surrounded by the beasts. He felt extremely sad and helpless.

Most of the people in the Supreme Divine sect were already entangled in combat with the berserk beasts. Only some who were afraid of death had already fled the moment the formations collapsed, including Daoist Gu Hao and Li Hong.

“Damn it!”

He was carrying the inheritance of the Supreme Shrine on his shoulders now. He definitely could not fall here.

If he could escape this calamity, then he would definitely be able to establish the Supreme Divine sect again in the future. The sect’s legacy would then be able to live on.

With the help of countless disciples, Xie Tianyu finally managed to escape from the horde of berserk beasts and made his way toward Sky Mountain.

The Supreme Divine sect was filled with conflicts everywhere, both internal and external. The sect master and grandmaster were at odds with each other, the disciples on two sides were also wary of each other. Amidst this, there was one who, filled with hatred, had always been waiting for an opportunity to take revenge. However, there were also disciples and elders who risked their lives just to protect the legacy of the sect.

Less than six hours passed since the formations collapsed, but the formerly glorious Supreme Divine sect had now been buried in a sea of fire and destruction.

Many disciples had become food for the berserk beasts, and only a small portion of them had escaped.

“Hahaha! Daoist Black Iron, you never expected things to turn out like this, right?”

Amidst the sea of fire, Han Tai laughed out loud. The hatred in his heart had already been resolved.

Han Tai did not care that he was surrounded by countless berserk beasts. He knew from the very beginning that he would die today. In any case, he had already taken revenge and had no attachment to this world.

Not long after, he was torn apart by the berserk beasts.

The Supreme Divine sect was destroyed!

Although there were still a few people who managed to escape, there were still endless calamities to face, as they faced the pursuit of countless berserk beasts. It would take perseverance, strength, and most of all, luck, to survive.

On the other side, Xie Tianyu and Dapost Black Iron were hurrying away after escaping the ruins of the sect, and were heading toward Sky Mountain.

Xie Tianyu knew that Sky Mountain was their only chance at survival. After all, Ye Xuan was there. Of all the places to seek refuge, it promised the highest chances of survival.

Although his pride stung at this thought, he had no choice but to rely on the Great Wilderness Divine sect.
