“Alright! I’ve got it, you may leave now.”

Ye Xuan waved his hand.

“Alright, Martial Uncle Ye, Rufeng will take his leave first!”

Hua Rufeng bowed respectfully and then left the wooden house. As he left, he briefly glanced at the dilapidated wooden house on Cloud Sky peak, a strange light flashing across his eyes.

Ten minutes later, Ye Xuan strolled out of the room with a smile on his face.

With a wave of his sleeve, Ye Xuan took out the only weapon Tian Xuan had him, the Cloud Sky sword!

It was a supreme-grade black-rank magic artifact!

The classification of artifacts in the mystic world was, from high to low, heaven, earth, black and yellow ranks. Each rank was further divided into low, middle, high, and supreme grades.

Thanks to the realm passageway, everything Ye Xuan possessed had been transformed into energy by the system to preserve his life.

Although he still had the cultivation methods and martial techniques of the Tian Yuan continent in his mind, the difference in the spiritual energy of the two planes meant that they were not suited for use in the mystic world.

It was precisely because of this that every cultivator who ascended from a lower plane would experience the baptism of the plane’s power when they passed through the realm passageway, reconstructing their meridians.

In this way, the cultivators could quickly adapt to the spiritual energy of the plane after they ascended.

However, that was only for cultivators who had surpassed the great emperor realm. Ye Xuan had ascended with the help of the realm passageway opened up by the fragment. Were it not for the system’s assistance, he would have died there. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

As for the baptism, it was also done by the system. It was truly fortunate that he had the system. The ancient black dragon would have probably died.

After that, Ye Xuan used the sword controlling technique of the sect to travel to the meeting hall.

As soon as he stepped into the hall, Ye Xuan saw many people in tattered clothes.

These were most likely the villagers who had survived the attack.

“I say, Junior Brother Ye, you’ve got quite some courage there, making me and Senior Brother Gongsun wait for you for so long!”

Before Ye Xuan could sit down, he was admonished in a chiding tone by the chief of the Hidden Sword peak, Gao Shun, who was also the law enforcement elder of the Great Wilderness Divine sect.

Hearing this, Ye Xuan could not help but raise his eyebrows.

This old man was quite good at stirring up trouble!

However, he was also clear that many of the chiefs looked down on him.

Ye Xuan did not bother to look at them, and simply turned to the sect master of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, Gongsun Shouyue.

“Senior Brother Gongsun, I’m sorry! The Cloud Sky peak is a fair distance from the meeting hall. Please forgive me for the delay.”

“No problem!”

Gongsun Shouyue smiled and waved his hand.

Although he did not think much of Ye Xuan in his heart, as the sect master, he still had to be magnanimous.

After Gao Shun realized that he had been ignored by Ye Xuan, his expression turned extremely ugly.

‘Hmph! You’re just a mere second-level divine mystic realm cultivator, yet you dare to act so arrogantly in front of me!’

‘How did a piece of trash like you get chosen by Martial Uncle Tian Xuan. You don’t even have a divine bone! If there’s one thing you have, it’s unwarranted luck!’

‘In my opinion, you are the biggest mistake that Martial Uncle Tian Xuan has made!’

In the eyes of the other chiefs, Tian Xuan would never have passed on the position of chief to Ye Xuan had he not been nearing death.

In addition, Ye Xuan’s body did not contain any divine bones, and according to Tian Xuan, ye Xuan was a disciple he took in by chance, not a disciple from some noble family.

As such, most of the cultivators from the sect looked down on Ye Xuan.

When the seven chiefs sat down, the survivors in the hall had a mixture of hope and sadness on their faces.

As citizens of the mystic world, all of them yearned for the path of cultivation, hoping that they possessed the talent to cultivate and eventually become immortals.

“Daoist Masters, please seek justice on our behalf!”

At this moment, a young man suddenly walked out of the crowd and knelt down in front of Ye Xuan and the others, crying bitterly.

With him taking the lead, the other youths around him followed suit, hoping that Gongsun Shouyue would stand up for them.

As powerless commoners, how could they resist the attacks of those ferocious beasts? Although they had survived, they had also witnessed the deaths of their family members and loved ones.

Suddenly, while the young man was drowning in his sorrow, an obscure aura briefly flashed across his forehead. It was barely noticeable to ordinary people, but it was clear as day to the chiefs.

The eyes of the chiefs lit up when they saw this.

There was an unpolished jade among these mortals! This was really rare!

“I’m already aware of what happened to all of you, and I’m also very regretful that things turned out this way. However, what has passed has passed, and you all have to look forward!”

“Alright! Quickly get up!”

Gongsun Shouyue, who had spoken words of pity and empathy, sighed deeply.

After the beast attack in the village yesterday, he had sent many disciples to investigate. However, the strange thing was that they could not find the source of the beast attack.

Helpless, he could only call all of the chiefs together to discuss the matter of dealing with the survivors.

“As for the beast attack, since it happened within our sect’s territory, we will investigate it thoroughly!”

Gongsun Shouyue looked at Ye Xuan and the others beside him, and then continued, “After a preliminary investigation by our sect, we hope to be able to find the source and cause of the attack. Don’t be anxious in the meantime.”

“Before the truth is discovered, you can choose to stay in the sect to cultivate. Once we’ve discovered the truth, we will definitely inform you.”

Among the survivors, there was a young girl with a dirty face named Zhuge Yueyue.

When Zhuge Yueyue heard Gongsun Shouyue’s words, her tears fell like rain, and her face was filled with despair.

When she thought of the scene of her parents dying at the hands of those beasts, her heart was filled with incomparable pain.

She hated herself for being powerless.

However, if she could step onto the path of cultivation and become a powerful cultivator, she would be able to avenge her parents.

Zhuge Yueyue knew very well that Gongsun Shouyue and the others were just saying things for the sake of posterity. They would not truly help her seek justice.

She could only rely on herself to avenge her parents.

However, at least Gongsun Shouyue still gave her a way forward, which was to stay in the Great Wilderness Divine sect and study under a master.
