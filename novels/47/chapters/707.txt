708 Crystal Night Light

The other sects had never imagined that despite their arduous preparations, they would emerge with virtually nothing from the gathering.

Now, even the crystal within the ancient realm had been taken away.

After today, there would definitely be many geniuses who chose to join the Great Wilderness Divine sect over any of the other sects.

With so many geniuses for them to choose from, the chiefs of the Great Wilderness Divine sect would probably be laughing their heads off.

“Sigh”

Daoist Canghai could not help but sigh and say, “Times have changed” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Forget it, forget it. I really have to congratulate you guys this time. You guys actually won again.”

“Your Great Wilderness Divine sect is indeed extraordinary at teaching disciples.”

Ao Lei had a smile so wide that it stretched from ear-to-ear.

Twice in a row!

The Great Wilderness Divine sect had won twice in a row!

Furthermore, they had done so in domineering fashion!

Three of the final 10 participants were from the Great Wilderness Divine sect. It was really something to be proud of.

“Haha, Daoist Canghai, you are giving us too much credit. We simply teach them like we should.”

After hearing Ao Lei’s words, Gao Shun was dumbfounded. It seemed that Senior Brother Ao had also learned to humble brag!

In any case, the cultivators from the Great Wilderness Divine sect were in high spirits after the victory. Their backs were straight, and their heads were held high.

Xiang Yun, who was originally regarded as a troublemaker and avoided like the plague, had now become the object of their admiration and pride.

At this moment, a golden light flashed and a new statue appeared beside Chief Tian Xuan’s. The person depicted on this statue was Xiang Yun.

Although this statue was much smaller than the other statues, it was holding a mighty hammer in its hand, exuding an extremely powerful sense of oppression.

At this moment, Xiang Yun and Hua Rufeng were teleported out, officially marking the end of the gathering.

“Teacher, First Sister, Second Sister”

Holding the crystal tightly in her hand, Xiang Yun pranced over to Ye Xuan and lifted both of her hands up, clearly asking to be carried.

Ye Xuan obliged, and lifted her high up with a happy smile on both their faces.

After Ye Xuan lifted her up and twirled around a few times, he put her down again, after which she immediately ran toward her two senior sisters, pinching their skins just to make sure that they were real.

Xiang Yun said in disbelief, “First Sister, Second Sister, so you both aren’t sleeping forever after all. You scared me to death.”

After hearing these words, Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun, who were originally about to praise her, rubbed her head with some force instead, saying seriously, “Third Sister, didn’t we tell you this many times? In the future, you can’t casually say that others are sleeping forever, okay? It’s not good.”

“Okay, okay.”

After she agreed, she ran over to Ye Xuan and handed over the crystal that she had been clutching tightly this entire time.

“Teacher, take this crystal,” she said happily.

“Oh?”

Ye Xuan was stunned. He stared at Xiang Yun with a smile and asked, “You spent a lot of effort to get this crystal. Why are you giving it to me?”

It would be a lie to say that Ye Xuan was not tempted by the crystal. However, as her teacher, he could not possibly take away the treasure that his disciple had worked so hard to obtain.

Xiang Yun scratched the back of her head and said with a serious expression after thinking for a moment, “Teacher, I wanted you to help me embed this crystal into my bed. This way, I’ll be able to sleep soundly in the future.”

After hearing this sentence, the originally leisurely Gao Shun instantly burst out laughing.

“Senior Brother Gao, what are you doing?”

“Hahaha, I’m really sorry. I couldn’t hold it in. You’re surprised as well, right?”

Gao Shun said this as he looked at Xiang Yun with incredulity.

This golden crystal was something that countless cultivators could only dream of. If she could refine it, her cultivation level would definitely increase significantly.

However, she actually wanted it embedded into her bed so that she could sleep more soundly. Was this a sad fate that a heavenly treasure should have?

Honestly, if she gave it to him instead, Gao Shun would not have minded telling her stories every night.

“Haha, she’s still a little girl. She should understand its value much better when she’s a little older,” Ao Lei said while smiling and Xiang Yun.

At this moment, Ye Xuan rubbed Xiang Yun’s head and helped her smoothen her hair as he said, “Yun’er, this crystal is a treasure that is hard to come by in ten thousand years. It contains an immense amount of power. ”

“If you can refine all of the power inside, then your cultivation level will greatly improve. It will be a waste to embed it into your bed.”

“Oh… This thing is actually so powerful?”

After thinking for a moment, Xiang Yun’s eyes started to spin around before handing the crystal to Ye Xuan.

“Teacher, if that’s the case, I should give this crystal to you.”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan asked with a smile, “Can you tell me the reason for this?”
