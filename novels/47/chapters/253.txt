The Gongsun family’s Grand Elder did not respond. Instead, he increased the intensity of his attacks.

Ye Xuan’s bounty reward was worth the risk.

“Damn it!”

“If I survive, I’ll definitely slaughter the entire Gongsun family!”

The Great Elder of the Nether God sect roared madly.

Thanks to the Great Elder’s words, everyone realized his identity, and quickly started moving.

“Hurry up! Hurry up and inform Ye Xuan!”

“Move quickly!”

Unfortunately, most cultivators did not have communication jade tokens like the Gongsun family, so it was basically impossible to beat them to the punch.

Even so, no one gave up. From this, it was evident how attractive Ye Xuan’s bounty reward was.

“Not good! The battle is heading this way!”

Amidst the excitement, a cultivator with sharp eyes suddenly noticed that the two experts were getting closer and closer to where they were.

Immediately, everyone’s expression changed.

If they got too close to a battle of this caliber, even the spiritual energy fluctuations would be enough to kill them.

Everyone frantically ran in the opposite direction.

Fortunately, the Gongsun family’s Grand Elder’s attacks hindered his opponent’s speed.

Even so, there were still many cultivators who were swallowed by the void power spewed out by the spatial cracks.

“Hurry up and leave!”

Hearing this, Gongsun Batian’s facial expression suddenly changed. His body erupted with strength, and he fled with Gongsun Yao and Gongsun Wan in tow.

In an instant, the huge city was evacuated. Only a few cultivators who were unafraid of death remained.

As the battle got closer and closer, a large number of buildings were destroyed.

“What terrifying power!”

“Thankfully I escaped in time!”

A Xudan realm expert standing on the peak of a mountain overlooking the battlefield from afar revealed a fearful expression as he said this.

“So strong!”

Gongsun Yao and Gongsun Wan looked at the two people fighting in the sky with shocked expressions.

They had never seen their great-grandfather in action.

The Great Elder of the Nether God sect cursed the Gongsun family as he fought. He even cursed the eighteen generations of the Gongsun family’s ancestors.

As the battle progressed, and time continued to pass, the Great Elder increased the intensity of his attacks, and seemed to abandon defense, as if trying to take his opponent down with him.

Seeing this, the Gongsun family’s Grand Elder’s forehead was covered in sweat. He was barely holding on.

In any case, he was only stalling for time. He had no intention of fighting the Great Elder of the Nether God sect to the death.

“Not good! Father might not be able to hold on much longer!”

Gongsun Batian narrowed his eyes.

He was the only one among them who had the strength to clearly discern the situation on the battlefield.

One of them was madly fighting for his life in the face of a desperate situation, while the other simply wanted to stall for time.

If this continued, the stalemate would be broken soon.

Boom!

Purple energy erupted, and a giant spatial crack suddenly appeared.

The Gongsun family’s Grand Elder’s face turned extremely pale as his right arm was shattered by the purple energy.

However, moments later, his right arm was restored.

Boom!

The Great Elder of the Nether God sect had a crazed look in his eyes. He burned his cultivation foundation to fuel a mad attack on his opponent’s body, slicing it in half!

“Gongsun family, just you wait! When I return, the Gongsun family will be destroyed!”

He then turned into a streak of light and fled into the distance.

He knew very well that his opponent’s body would be restored in a few short moments, so this was his only chance to escape.

“Damn it! He got away!”

Seeing this, Gongsun Batian’s expression darkened.

Gongsun Yao and Gongsun Wan also had ugly expressions on their faces.

Now they would have to deal with the looming threat of a tenth-level unity realm expert, and the Gongsun family would have to be constantly wary of a sneak attack.

Not good!

He could not let him escape!

The Gongsun family’s Grand Elder’s body turned into a streak of light in pursuit.

However, at this moment, his body was suddenly frozen.

He was not the only one. Even the Great Elder of the Nether God sect had been frozen in place.

Moments later, everyone saw a bright light suddenly appear in the sky. When the light dissipated, there was a white-robed young man hovering in the sky..

Ye Xuan!

In an instant, the surroundings fell deathly silent.

The Great Elder of the Nether God sect’s expression stiffened, and his heart sank.

“Ye Xuan!”

This demon had finally arrived!

Ye Xuan did not waste time with words and simply took out his longsword and swung it.

Although it was just a simple strike, it was more than sufficient to reap the life of the Great Elder of the Nether God sect.
