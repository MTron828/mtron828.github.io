687 Sowing Discord

The human heart was unfathomable and incomprehensible. Daoist Gu Hao also recalled the disappointment in Daoist Black Iron’s eyes when Li Hong used the Beast Gaze technique just now.

It was obvious that Daoist Black Iron was already secretly wondering if he had been tossed aside as his disciple.

Ye Xuan continued calmly, “Zhuge Yueyue is not only a disciple of my Cloud Sky peak, but she will also be the one to take over my position in the future.”

“I will definitely teach her everything I know. If one day in the future, I disappear from the human world, won’t these abilities of mine disappear with me?”

!!

“If I really don’t pass them down, how could I face the ancestors of Cloud Sky peak?”

After hearing this, everyone understood why he had done what he did.

“Ye Xuan is right. After all, she is his eldest disciple and will take over his position in the future.”

“Besides, if everyone has reservations about passing down their knowledge and abilities, wouldn’t many great legacies and inheritances be lost?”

People started discussing the matter. It seemed that not all forces were as selfish as the Immortal Divine sect and the Supreme Divine sect. It seemed that Daoist Gu Hao was even wary of his own disciple.

Intentionally or otherwise, Daoist Black Iron’s expression had already turned extremely gloomy after hearing the discussion.

It was the same for Daoist Gu Hao.

Sensing this, Ye Xuan secretly rejoiced. It seemed that his words had touched a sore spot.

‘Haha’

Ye Xuan smiled, and then glanced at Han Tai, who was behind Daoist Black Iron, expressing his approval of his actions.

Just now, Han Tai secretly told Ye Xuan that Gu Hao had not taught Daoist Black Iron the Beast Gaze technique.

When Ye Xuan found out about this, he knew what had to be done, and jumped on the opportunity to sow discord between the two.

Han Tai was also quite ruthless. He had always held a grudge against Daoist Black Iron after being forced to sacrifice his arm. He even wanted to destroy the Supreme Divine sect, and Ye Xuan was more than happy to help Han Tai.

After hearing Ye Xuan’s words, Han Tai leaned over to Daoist Black Iron and whispered a few words into his ear, adding fuel to the fire.

At this moment, Daoist Black Iron was already on the verge of losing control of his emotions.

Seeing this, the corners of Ye Xuan’s mouth curled up slightly and he walked away without continuing to interfere. The rest would be left to Han Tai. Vengeance had to be exacted personally, after all.

Inside the ancient realm, Zhuge Yueyue circulated her spiritual power, which opened the door in the sky. A torrent of extreme power poured down like a waterfall.

Seeing this scene, Xie Tianyu’s face had already turned pale, and his expression was filled with fear. Where had she obtained such a powerful technique?

“This can’t be happening! That’s it! You’re using an illusion technique! It’s fake! It’s all fake!”

Zhuge Yueyue stared at him coldly and said, “Everything seems fake when you’re too weak to understand it.”

“Only broad-minded people can go higher and further. If you’re narcissistic, you’ll be left in the dust.”

“Take this experience as a life lesson.”

Zhuge Yueyue did not bother saying anything else and simply attacked.

Moments later, terrifying sword beams tore through the sky and shot toward Xie Tianyu.

In the blink of an eye, the ferocious beast was shattered, and Xie Tianyu was knocked to the ground. He spat out a few mouthfuls of blood. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“This can’t be happening. How could I be defeated so easily”

Xie Tianyu staggered to his feet. His whole body was bloodied and bruised. As a proud genius, how could he be defeated by the same person twice?

He could not accept this failure, and took out a pill without hesitation to recover, and prepared to fight Zhuge Yueyue again.

Zhuge Yueyue laughed disdainfully when she saw this.

“Since you still refuse to admit defeat, don’t blame me for beating you up until you do.”

As soon as she finished speaking, Zhuge Yueyue launched another round of fierce attacks, forcing Xie Tianyu back again and again.

Xie Tianyu found it harder and harder to defend himself with every attack. The pill he had just taken did not allow him to recover to his peak condition.

Although Zhuge Yueyue was no longer using Ye Xuan’s signature move, Xie Tianyu was completely at her mercy. After a few short exchanges, he was knocked down again.

Zhuge Yueyue showed no mercy. She raised her leg and kicked him into the distance. With a loud bang, he crashed into a huge rock, creating a human-shaped hole in it.
