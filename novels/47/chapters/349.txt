350 Destruction Intent

However, most cultivators did not know that there was an extremely harsh condition for one to truly reach the King realm, which was to achieve perfect-level intent. Only then would they be able to fully fuse the power of the laws of the world into their profound pattern.

The categorization of King realm experts was also in relation to this. Those who had successfully comprehended one perfect-level martial intent were considered early-stage Human King realm cultivators. Two perfect-level martial intents would be the middle stage, and three perfect-level martial intents would be the advanced stage.

If one wanted to break through to the Heavenly King realm, they would have to fuse the martial intents.

Those who were able to fuse two, were either early-stage or middle-stage Heavenly King realm cultivators, while those with three were advanced-stage Heavenly King realm experts.

As for the Saint King realm, one could only reach it by truly comprehending the profound power of the laws which was contained in the profound patterns they engraved.

However, the cultivators of the pattern condensation realm could only use the profound power of the laws to attack. Saint King realm experts were able to completely control the power of the laws.

Those who could control 36% of the laws were known as early-stage Saint King realm experts; controlling 72% made one a middle-stage Saint King realm expert, and 100% made one an advanced-stage Saint King realm expert.

This brawny Saint King realm expert was an early-stage Saint King realm cultivator.

The reason he had been able to break through to the Saint King realm was because he could control 36% of the laws of the sea.

Boom!

His eyes glowed with a dazzling blue light as the space around him rippled.

Moments later, he transformed into a demonic whale, and immediately dived into the sea below.

He wanted to use the laws of the sea to shatter the spatial cage that Ye Xuan had set up.

However, no matter how hard he tried, he could not.

“You are too weak!”

“With your strength, you actually dared to attack my disciple? You’ve clearly overestimated yourself.”

Ye Xuan’s voice rang out.

Although he had not spoken loudly, his voice was clearly transmitted throughout the Nanzhou Region, and even the Huangyu Zone.

At that moment, the King realm experts from the two races stopped fighting as they directed their attention toward the battlefield where Ye Xuan’s phantom figure and the demonic whale were.

They had never expected Ye Xuan to be so powerful that even a Saint King realm expert was no match for him.

A mountain-sized hole appeared on the huge demonic whale’s body.

“Ah!”

The demonic whale roared, and its surging aura was thrown into disarray. Its eyes were filled with fear and unwillingness. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Destroy!”

Ye Xuan looked at the demonic whale indifferently.

As soon as he finished speaking, a red beam of light containing destruction intent suddenly descended.

“No!”

Not only had this guy grasped spatial and strength intents, but also destruction intent!

What kind of monster was this?

In addition to the heavenly lightning intent that they knew he had, there were now three more!

Had he comprehended all of the supreme intents?!

Unfortunately, he would never know.

Once the red beam touched its body, the demonic whale felt its body and soul disintegrating.

At this moment, the demonic whale’s heart was filled with fear, and its soul could not help but tremble.

He wanted to kneel down and beg for mercy. He still wanted to live!

However, Ye Xuan did not give him that opportunity, and the red beam expanded quickly.

The demonic whale felt its entire body become light as a feather before it instantly turned into nothingness. Not even ashes remained.

“Wait a minute, is that destruction intent?!”

“How is that possible?”

Everyone was stunned senseless.
