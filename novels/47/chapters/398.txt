399 Is Your Goal Just That?

Now that he had just broken through, the most important thing was to consolidate his cultivation foundation.

After Ye Xuan calmed himself down, he slowly opened his eyes. Three beautiful women suddenly appeared in his field of vision. All three were staring at him.

Then after Ye Xuan retracted the golden dragon patterns on his body, the powerful spiritual pressure in the surroundings also dissipated.

When Zhuge Yueyue, Feng Xiyun, and Xin’er saw this, they heaved a sigh of relief.

The strongest among them had only reached the divine mystic realm, so even if Ye Xuan’s spiritual pressure was not deliberately directed at them, they still felt very uncomfortable.

Now that this terrifying spiritual pressure had disappeared, they plopped to the ground.

However, they quickly got up and ran over to Ye Xuan to congratulate him.

“Congratulations on breaking through to the mystic lord realm!” Feng Xiyun said.

“Congratulations on breaking through, Teacher,” Zhuge Yueyue chimed in.

When Xin’er saw this, she felt slightly envious that she was not his disciple, but she congratulated him anyway.

Hearing this, Ye Xuan smiled.

“It’s just a minor achievement, so there’s no need to make a big fuss over it. As long as you all work hard in your cultivation, you’ll reach the mystic lord realm sooner or later as well.”

When Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun heard this, they were overjoyed.

Going by his words, did it mean he believed that they too would reach the mystic lord realm?

This was the lifelong goal of countless cultivators!

Let alone the mystic lord realm, countless cultivators might not even be able to break through to the void realm despite cultivating their entire lives.

Immediately, Feng Xiyun asked with a smile, “Teacher, does that mean that we also have the hope of breaking through to the mystic lord realm?” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“It’s just the mystic lord realm. As my disciples, how can your goal be limited to just this?”

“As long as all of you work hard in your cultivation, and train diligently according to the cultivation techniques that I impart to you, it’s not impossible for you to reach the supreme realm.”

Both of them were overjoyed by this response.

“We will definitely follow Teacher’s instructions and cultivate diligently! We will strive to reach the mystic lord realm as soon as possible!”

Of course, Feng Xiyun did not think that she would be able to break through to the supreme realm. The mystic lord realm was already her biggest goal.

Then, Zhuge Yueyue chimed in, “Teacher, Xi ‘er and I hunted a giant wolf in the vicinity just now. Would you like to steam it or roast it?”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan turned to look around him.

Just now, because he had broken through, the spiritual energy within the surroundings had gathered around him, creating a whirlwind that had wreaked havoc upon the environment.

Everywhere he looked, it was a mess.

Ye Xuan’s mouth twitched when he saw this.

If this had happened on Earth in his previous life, this would have been classified as a criminal act of destroying nature, and he would have been fined.

“Let’s roast it!”

“It’s already quite late, so we should have our meal quickly. You can rest early after filling your stomachs.”

“Tomorrow, we will continue to explore the surrounding territory!”

“Yes, Teacher!”

Zhuge Yueyue nodded.

“Senior Sister, I’ll help you,” Feng Xiyun proposed.

However, Zhuge Yueyue rejected her.

“I can handle such matters myself. As a princess who has lived in the palace your entire life, cooking likely isn’t your strong suit.”

“In any case, you’ve just become Teacher’s disciple, so I’m sure that you still have many questions regarding cultivation. You can take this time to consult him.”

Feng Xiyun did not retort. What Yueyue said was indeed true. As a princess, she naturally had her meals prepared for her in the palace and did not know how to cook.

However, Feng Xiyun still felt a little embarrassed to be alone with Ye Xuan. Otherwise, she would not have offered to help Zhuge Yueyue.

When she recalled the earlier incident, she could not help but blush.

Still, she had to deal with it sooner or later. After all, he was going to be her teacher for life. As such, she walked over to Ye Xuan.

Thankfully, upon meeting his gaze, she realized that he was completely calm and expressionless.

Perhaps it was not such a big deal after all.
