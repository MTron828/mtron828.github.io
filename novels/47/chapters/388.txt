389 One Strike

“What terrifying sword qi!”

When Yuelun saw this, she was shocked.

Although she had guessed that Ye Xuan was quite powerful, she did not expect this guy to have such high attainments in terms of Sword Dao.

As their auras clashed, it immediately attracted everyone’s attention.

Many people were confused when they saw this.

“Fellow cultivators, look! Those two are the heaven realm cultivators of the Xia family, but who is the young man facing them? I don’t recognize him at all!”

“A heaven realm expert with this level of sword qi should be quite rare, so why does he seem entirely unfamiliar?”

Ye Xuan smiled, reached out, and a blade of grass suddenly appeared in his hand.

As Ye Xuan’s sword qi spread out, the ape beast became even more violent.

“Roar!”

The ape beast beat its chest hard and then went all out on the cultivators surrounding it.

Ye Xuan’s spiritual sense had been watching its movements the entire time, so he immediately noticed its attempt to break out of the encirclement.

“My time is very precious. I can’t be bothered to waste too much time on you!”

“I’ll give you a chance. If you can survive one strike from me, I will not pursue this matter!”

Ye Xuan looked at his opponents coldly. The blade of grass in his hand turned into a giant sword that fell from the heavens. The wind around it tore the sky apart as the destructive force bore down on the two old men.

When the two old men saw this, their expressions turned grave.

However, they could not retreat. After all, without their protection, Charlot would definitely die.

“Let’s go all out!”

The two old men looked at each other, their eyes filled with determination.

Ye Xuan had also said that as long as they could survive this sword strike, he would write off the matter.

Immediately, they erupted with spiritual power, and used their most powerful artifacts and divine powers to conjure up a huge stone shield that flew up to block the giant sword.

Boom!

As the two collided, the shockwaves shook the surroundings. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The giant sword glowed with divine light as it struck the stone shield.

Moments later, the two old men were sent flying like cannonballs.

Pfft!

The two old men both spat out blood, and their auras turned chaotic. After just a single sword strike, they had both been severely injured.

“What? How is this possible? How can his strength be so terrifying?”

Seeing this, Charlot plopped onto the ground in fear, his face extremely pale.

‘Sigh, I’m still lacking!’

‘It seems that I haven’t completely mastered the Flora sword technique!’

Ye Xuan was slightly disappointed that he had not been able to kill those two heaven realm cultivators with that sword strike.

Although it was only the first move of the Flora sword technique, it was not something an ordinary heaven realm expert could resist.

Of course, if Ye Xuan had used the Cloud Heaven sword, the result would have been completely different.

Although Ye Xuan was not satisfied,Yuelun, Zhuge Yueyue, and the others were all dumbfounded.

“Is this Martial Uncle Ye Xuan’s true strength? Isn’t this a bit too terrifying?”

Li Hanyi, who had just rushed over, had witnessed the scene upon her arrival.

“As expected, the rumors can’t be trusted.”

“Martial Uncle Ye Xuan was so domineering just now!”

Li Hanyi and the other disciples of the Water Sky peak looked at Ye Xuan in awe.

“But when did the Great Wilderness Divine sect have such a domineering sword technique?” Yuelun was both shocked and puzzled by this.

However, she did not dwell on it, as everyone’s attention turned to the ape beast that was on the verge of breaking out of the encirclement.

Her spiritual power transformed into a giant palm that slapped the ape beast.

“Evil creature, where do you think you are running off to?”

The crowd was once again shocked. Another heaven realm expert!

“Teacher…”

Just then, Zhuge Yueyue realized that while the experts were fighting the ape beast, the two old men who were injured by Ye Xuan earlier had taken advantage of the chaos to escape with Charlot.

“My precious disciple, stay here. I’ll be back after I’ve dealt with this ape.”

Ye Xuan could not be bothered with Charlot and the others. Instead, he gave Zhuge Yueyue some instructions.

“Alright, Teacher!”

Zhuge Yueyue nodded her head obediently, then quickly followed Li Hanyi and the others.

The surrounding scene was too chaotic, and the cultivators participating in the battle were extremely powerful. It was not something that rookies like them could interfere with.

Ye Xuan took a step forward and turned into a streak of light, chasing after the ape beast.

“Roar!”

In the face of danger, the ape’s breathing became heavier, and its lantern-sized pupils surged with monstrous killing intent.

Moments later, the ancient demon ape roared at the sky, and mysterious patterns appeared on its huge body.

This was the power of its precious bone.

“Hahaha! This ape beast really does have a precious bone. My trip was not in vain!”

At this moment, an old man in a gray robe laughed in the sky. The blood-red long saber in his hand flashed with terrifying light as he slashed toward the ape beast

The gray-robed elder was an elder from the Immoral Divine sect, and he was also a heaven realm cultivator.

Yuelun was no stranger to him!

Dazzled divine light burst forth as Yuelun’s giant palm smashed into the ape beast.

However, its physical defense was too strong, and her attack failed to cause fatal damage.
