“You b*stard, no matter what status you have today, there’s only one possible outcome for you after provoking me, which is death,” Feng Lu said angrily.

He gestured toward Ye Xuan and dozens of armored soldiers surrounded him.

“This is Qingyang City, which is my territory. Let’s see how you get yourself out of this predicament!”

At this moment, Feng Lu’s heart was filled with anger.

!!

Were it not for Ye Xuan, how could he have lost so much money?

There was no way he could accept such a big loss without getting back at Ye Xuan, which was why he had immediately used his authority to mobilize soldiers to surround Ye Xuan.

Furthermore, even more soldiers were rushing over. On the streets, the people were shocked to see this.

“Aren’t these Prince Zhanglu’s soldiers? Why are there so many of them? What is going on?”

They were panicking, thinking that some sort of crisis had befallen the city.

Outside the auction house, Ye Xuan was still watching calmly. On the other hand, Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun were ready to draw their weapons at any moment.

At this moment, a tall and burly man in full armor hurried over to Feng Lu’s side. He knelt down on one knee and said, “Your Highness, your loyal retainer Li Kun has already brought soldiers to assist you!”

As soon as he finished speaking, this person erupted with an aura of a middle-stage heaven realm expert.

Seeing this scene, the faces of the onlookers turned pale.

“A middle-stage heaven realm expert!”

“Who is this young man? He actually dared to provoke Prince Zhanglu?”

Everyone was watching with interest, craning their necks over others to try and get a good view of Ye Xuan to try and identify him.

When Feng Lu noticed Li Kun’s arrival, he burst out laughing.

“General Li, you made it here.”

With Li Kun present, Feng Lu was full of confidence. He glared at Ye Xuan and scolded him.

“You b*stard, you won’t be able to escape today. I’ll capture you, then force your parents to beg for your life!”

“Go! Capture those three and tie them up.”

After hearing Feng Lu’s order, the soldiers immediately took action and moved to act.

“Stop!”

With an angry roar, Han Sikong rushed out of the auction house, looking very upset.

However, after seeing Han Sikong, Li Kun laughed contemptuously and asked, “Han Sikong, do you really want to interfere in this matter?”

“Do you think that Qingyang Restaurant’s status in Qingyang City is untouchable? You’re overstepping your boundaries.”

Hearing this, Han Sikong’s face instantly darkened, but it soon turned bright and he laughed.

“Haha! This is really too funny.”

Han Sikong’s expression was contemptuous. The reason why Qingyang Restaurant could survive in Qingyang City for so long was indeed due to Prince Zhanglu’s blessings.

However, things were different now.

If Prince Zhanglu and his men wanted to teach the others a lesson, Han Sikong would not interfere.

However, this time, they actually wanted to cause trouble for Ye Xuan, which was a completely different story altogether. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

After all, Ye Xuan was a supreme realm expert. As long as he could please him, what was there to be afraid of?

A supreme realm expert could even easily destroy the Yangli divine empire!

“Li Kun, do you know who you provoked today?”

“It’s Ye Xuan,” Han Sikong said imposingly, then stood in front of Ye Xuan to block Li Kun.

After hearing this, Li Kun’s expression changed drastically despite not knowing who Ye Xuan was.

However, the prince had asked him to come over to help, so he could not refuse.

After hearing Han Sikong’s words, Li Kun suddenly felt a little regretful.

‘Could it be that this young man is someone I can’t afford to offend?’ Li Kun thought to himself.

He knew Han Sikong very well. As a businessman, he must have his reasons for going against the prince like this.

“Tsk! Who are you trying to scare?” Feng Lu walked up fiercely and said directly.

“I don’t care who you are. Since you provoked me, you won’t be able to leave. No matter who you ask for help, it won’t work!”

“Han Sikong, you have to make your stance clear now. If you continue to oppose me, then the Qingyang Restaurant has no reason to exist in Qingyang City!”

Han Sikong burst into laughter.

“Haha, you’re just a frog at the bottom of a well. As a puny prince, who gave you the courage to act arrogantly like this?”

As soon as he finished speaking, Han Sikong raised his hand and waved. Thousands of cultivators rushed out of the auction house in an instant.

Each of these cultivators exuded a threatening aura. Their strength was not something that Feng Lu’s soldiers could stand against.

Seeing this, Li Kun’s face instantly stiffened and he said angrily, “Han Sikong! Are you planning to go to war today?”

At this moment, another laugh was heard.

“Hahaha! Not bad, not bad, you guys are very good!”

Ye Xuan walked up calmly and glanced at Li Kun and Feng Lu with a mocking expression. He spoke again, “Originally, I wanted to hurry on with my journey. However, it seems that if I don’t make a move today, I won’t be able to leave.”

“Forget it, forget it. Since the two of you are asking for it, it would be impolite of me to refuse.”

Han Sikong’s face turned pale.

...

The others might not understand how strong Ye Xuan was, but he did!

If he were to really make a move, the entire Qingyang City might end up being destroyed.

“Sir, please calm down.” He immediately ran over to dissuade him.

“It’s not a big deal. I’ll take care of it for you. Just wait for a moment.”
