941 Show Of Strength

Even though it saw Ye Xuan release a terrifying amount of power, the flood dragon was not cowed. The Thunder-Devouring Beast had done something similar before to show off its power.

Such superficial displays of strength were done only to scare people off. It would not fall for it.

“Hehe, is that all?”

“If this is the best you can do, then there’s no need for us to continue fighting.”

Seeing that Ye Xuan did not choose to pursue the attack, the flood dragon believed that its conjecture was correct, and looked at Ye Xuan mockingly.

Since this guy was full of hot air as well, it did not want to waste time on this battle, and wanted to end it as quickly as possible. After all, the Nine-tailed Sparrow was still waiting for him.

After that, the flood dragon said that, it immediately flew ten thousand meters into the air. Immediately after, a loud and clear dragon roar rang out.

“Roar…”

A divine rune filled with mysterious power was unleashed, condensing into a huge palm imprint that flew toward Ye Xuan, trying to slap him out of existence.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan merely smiled and said, “If you want to continue playing, then I don’t mind keeping you company.”

Hearing this, the flood dragon’s heart suddenly trembled.

What did this mean? Why was this guy still blustering and acting arrogant?

The flood dragon was very confused, but soon realized what was going on when Ye Xuan suddenly stretched out his palms, releasing a destructive aura. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Divine runes emitting golden light floated in the sky one after another, and everyone could vaguely hear dragon roars ringing out repeatedly.

“This… This…”

At this moment, the flood dragon was so nervous that it could not speak. It looked at the divine dragon condensed from divine runes in the sky with a dazed expression. A sense of fear arose spontaneously, and it stood rooted to the ground.

This was a double blow to its bloodline and soul!

“This absolutely cannot be happening! It’s not real!”

“Why do you have the divine runes of my ancestors in your body?”

At this moment, the flood dragon was completely dumbfounded as it roared and asked. The majestic divine dragon in the sky made its entire body tremble.

Ye Xuan stared at the flood dragon with a cold expression and said, “Hehe, you’re just a mixed-blood creature. How could you dare to call the divine dragon your ancestor? Are you delusional?”

Ye Xuan’s words undoubtedly shocked the flood dragon’s heart. At this moment, even the flood dragon was doubting itself.

For countless years, it had believed that it was a descendant of the divine dragons. However, in reality, the bloodline of the divine dragons in its body had almost dissipated.

This was also the reason why the Thunder-Devouring Beast called it a mixed-blood creature. Therefore, seeing Ye Xuan release the divine runes of the divine dragons, his heart was in complete and utter turmoil.

“No, this is definitely cannot be true!”

After a moment, the flood dragon went crazy and shouted hysterically.

“No one can deny that I am a descendant of the divine dragons. If anyone dares to question it, they will die!”

Its eyes were bloodshot as it launched a vicious attack at Ye Xuan without hesitation.

However, moments later, a golden light flashed, and the flood dragon was trapped by a large cage that emitted golden light, as rolling thunder clouds appeared in the sky, and flashes of divine lightning descended.

“Have you experienced true fear?”

Upon hearing Ye Xuan’s words, the flood dragon snapped back to its senses. Realizing that it was trapped, fear began to grip its heart.

This human’s strength was truly too terrifying. Moreover, the attack he launched contained a mysterious force that it could not resist.

This was the first time in countless years that it had encountered such a powerful enemy. It raised its head to look at the rolling thunder clouds in the sky. Purple divine lightning kept flashing, and the whole scene was suffocating and oppressive.

“What exactly is this move?”

Everyone’s expressions changed drastically.

At this moment, the laws of the Heavenly Dao seemed to have been angered, and a terrifying killer move seemed to be brewing.

“Hiss…”

Even the Nine-tailed Sparrow could not help but suck in a breath of cold air, her heart thumping wildly. This was truly shocking. She had never seen such a terrifying divine lightning.

“This divine power is too powerful. If I was on the receiving end, I probably would not be able to withstand it for more than a few moments.”

The Nine-tailed Sparrow had always felt that she was an outstanding figure among her peers. However, when she saw Ye Xuan’s performance, she knew that she was not his match.

On the other side, the originally arrogant flood dragon was now filled with panic when it saw the endless divine lightning in the sky.

Boom!

Ye Xuan casually waved his hand, and the divine lightning that had been brewing in the sky instantly struck the flood dragon, zapping it countless times.

Moments later, a tragic roar erupted, causing the entire ancient palace to shake.

“Heavens!”

At this moment, the Thunder-Devouring Beast looked at this scene with a dumbfounded expression, and without blinking. He finally realized just how powerful his big brother was!

The most terrifying thing was that Ye Xuan’s lightning-attribute laws were actually much stronger than his own. This was simply unreasonable. Who was the realm Thunder-Devouring Beast here?
