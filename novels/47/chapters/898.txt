899 One Against Six

“You seven pieces of trash, hurry up and bring it on. Show me how you’re going to destroy my sect!”

Yanran’s words immediately caused a huge sensation.

Could it be that she was going to deal with those seven experts together?

Everyone was shocked. Even if Ye Xuan came, he probably would not be able to fight all seven people at once, right?

Where did this lady get her courage from?

Yanran’s current cultivation level had already reached the peak of the sealed immortal realm. She could even be considered to have half a foot in the eternal.

After these seven came to this world, their strength had been greatly restricted, so Yanran did not show any fear at all.

Moreover, the more people they had, the more restrictions the world would place on them. Their strength would naturally be weakened even more. This was also the reason why Yanran was so confident.

After hearing Yanran’s words, the seven experts in the sky were incensed.

“Arrogant! You’re just a single sealed immortal realm cultivator, yet you dare to speak so arrogantly in front of us. You’re simply courting death!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the battle commenced.

One of the seven immediately launched an attack, triggering endless divine lightning in the sky that tried to strike Yanran.

However, the corners of her mouth simply curled up as she said indifferently, “Losers will be losers.”

After saying this, Yanran clenched her fist and hurled a punch at the incoming lightning. The powerful force of her attack even made space start to crack, and it crushed the lightning attack that the expert unleashed.

Then, her figure flashed and reappeared in front of him, and kicked him in the chest. Sending him flying miles away and into the side of a mountain. He was dead as dead could be.

Bang!

“My goodness! She’s so powerful!”

This entire series of events had happened too quickly, and everyone was finding it difficult to believe what they were seeing. All of a sudden, the tables had turned once again.

At this moment, all of the members of the Great Wilderness Divine sect were feeling pretty happy.

“This is so satisfying!”

“Yes, that kick really vented my anger.”

At this moment, even Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun were very surprised. They looked at Yanran with envy and admiration, wishing that they could be that strong and domineering.

Feng Xiyun looked at Yanran in a daze.

“Oh my God, Teacher’s wife is really too awesome. I think they are a match made in heaven!”

Hearing this, Zhuge Yueyue snapped, “Second Sister, you can’t say that. We don’t even know if this person is Teacher’s wife, so how can we just call her that? Otherwise, when our teacher comes and says otherwise, we’ll be in trouble.”

Feng Xiyun did not think much of it and said, “It doesn’t matter. I have already acknowledged her. If Teacher does not acknowledge her, then I will secretly do something. When the time comes, hehe…”

“Who wouldn’t want such a powerful and beautiful wife? She is simply amazing!”

Seeing that her second sister had been bewitched by this peerless expert, Zhuge Yueyue was at her wits’ end. However, when she thought it through, the corners of her mouth curled up anyway.

If this woman was really her teacher’s wife, then would Cloud Sky peak not have another sealed immortal realm expert? This would be a great thing.

At that time, the two of them would also be able to roam the world freely, and no one would dare to provoke them in the future/

“Damn it!”

At this moment, when the other six saw what had happened, they were infuriated. The leader stared daggers at Yanran.

“Who exactly are you? You actually dare to make a move on my clan. Could it be that you don’t want to live?”

After hearing these words, Yanran’s expression was still very indifferent.

She said, “So much talking. Attack already!”

“Lightning tiger clan? Haha, you are just a bunch of scum, a bunch of servile dregs. How dare you come to the eight continents to stir up trouble!”

“Damn it!”

After hearing Yanran’s words, the leader was so angry that his face looked like it had been steamed. It was as if Yanran had hit the nail on the head.

However, Yanran did not stop there.

“You guys only know how to bully the weak. In the ancient war, your lightning tiger clan hid themselves, and somehow managed to survive until now.”

“While all the heroes were fighting, you were all cowering in underground caves. However, you dared to appear in the lower world to show off now?”

“You only know how to suppress those weaker than you! If that’s not scum then I don’t know what is. If you really have the ability, come and attack me!”

Yanran’s words instantly made the remaining six experts so angry that their faces turned red.

This matter had always been kept a secret by their clan, but who knew that this woman was aware of the matter and exposed it to the public.

“How arrogant!”

“Let’s attack together. We must kill her now!”

The leader roared and launched an attack with the other five immortals, and the battle commenced anew. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

However, Yanran remained calm. Through this battle, the name of the Great Wilderness Divine sect would definitely resound through the nine heavens, and the lightning tigers would become a laughingstock!
