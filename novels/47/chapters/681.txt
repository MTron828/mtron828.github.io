682 Catching Up (Part 4)

Xiang Yun did not understand what that disciple’s words meant, but in any case, taking the test meant that she would be able to meet her first sister soon, so she was prepared to give it her all.

Without hesitation, she placed her hands on the boulder and activated it.

When the other disciples saw this, they chided her gently, “Little friend, don’t get your hopes up. After all, you’re only six years old. You probably haven’t even learned about Dao.”

Most people felt that she had no chance of passing this test, but wanted to hear her answer the question anyway.

!!

He raised his head and looked quite stunned to see a little girl standing in front of him.

After Xiang Yun saw the old man, she sat in front of him happily and said, “Don’t waste time. Hurry up.”

Hearing this, the old man could not help but laugh. Then, he asked, “Little girl, in your opinion, what is Dao?”

It was the same question as Zhuge Yueyue. After hearing this, everyone looked forward to hearing this little girl’s answer.

Xiang Yun scratched the back of her head and turned around to look at everyone questioningly.

“Dao? Is it delicious?”

Everyone was taken aback. She did not even know what Dao was to begin with, so there was no way she would be able to come up with a proper answer.

After hearing this, even the disciples of the Great Wilderness Divine sect burst into laughter. As fellow sect members, they were aware that Xiang Yun could hardly even read.

As things developed to this point, the people watching the screen outside became even more curious. If she did not know what Dao was, how did she pass?

Everyone stared at the screen quietly, watching what the old man would say in response.

The old man was at a loss for words. He had asked this question countless times and heard all kinds of answers, but this was the first time he had heard an answer like this.

He patiently said, “Dao isn’t something you eat, nor is it something fun. It’s just a concept that can guide you in your cultivation. Do you understand?”

After listening carefully, Xiang Yun pondered the matter.

Dao was a concept?

From her memory, her teacher seemed to have mentioned this Dao thing to her before.

“I’ve got it!”

After thinking for a moment, Xiang Yun’s eyes flashed brightly.

“Is that so? Then tell me about it.”

The old man was very curious. What kind of answer would this little girl give him?

The others also looked at her expectantly.

Xiang Yun spoke seriously, “My Dao is Roasted potatoes!”

After hearing this, everyone was completely dumbfounded.

“Huh? How does that make sense? How can her Dao be roasted potatoes?”

“Haha, this is really funny. I told you that she wouldn’t be able to answer this question. How could she possibly know what Dao is?”

Everyone burst into laughter. Some of them even held their stomachs as they fell to the ground laughing.

This was the first, and probably the last, time they would ever hear someone call their Dao roasted potatoes.

Xiang Yun looked around with a puzzled expression. Her teacher had said before that Dao was what one pursued in their heart and what they wanted the most.

What she wanted the most were roasted potatoes, therefore her Dao was roasted potatoes. Was there anything wrong with that?

When the old man heard this, he smiled and said, “Your answer is incorrect.”

Xiang Yun’s expression instantly darkened. She could tell that she was being laughed at, and that her roasted potatoes were being ridiculed.

Infuriated, she took out her potato hammer. However, she did not rush to attack anyone. Instead, she lowered her head and pondered.

Moments later, the wind and clouds surged, and streaks of purple lightning fell, sending everyone into a fright.

“Oh f*ck, she’s angry now. We’ve gotta run!”

Sensing this terrifying aura, those who knew better turned pale with fear and immediately started running.

Xiang Yun raised the hammer in her hand high and said, “Old man, I don’t care what Dao is. In my opinion, there is no Dao. If anything, Dao is me!”

After hearing this, the old man’s expression changed drastically as he watched the hammer smash toward him.

At this moment, she released a terrifying force, smashing the boulder.

The old man hurriedly dodged and floated in mid-air. However, before he could react, he saw her swinging the hammer at him again.

“I was teasing you”

The old man looked terrified. However, it was already too late to dodge, and he was smashed into the ground.

“Who taught this little girl? She actually dares to hit me?”

The old man was furious. However, he was just the person in charge of the test. He did not have much strength and had no way of resisting Xiang Yun’s attacks.

Soon enough, he had been beaten to a pulp, and had even been stepped on.

However, Xiang Yun still felt that it was not enough to vent her anger. She kicked him a few more times before saying, “Go ahead. Laugh at me again now. I’ll give you a few more kicks. So, I’m asking you now, did I answer correctly?” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

The old man was really in trouble now. Who could he complain to when he met someone as unreasonable as this?

If she did not know the answer, then she could have just chosen not to answer. Why did she have to beat him up like this?

While everyone was dumbfounded, another wave of fate energy descended upon Xiang Yun’s body.

“Eh … What is this?” Xiang Yun asked curiously.
