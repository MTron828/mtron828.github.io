583 Fruitful Auction

“Alright…”

After saying that, Ye Xuan once again got up and walked to the balcony of Suite 001.

After noticing Ye Xuan’s figure, the other guests started whispering again.

“Is he going to cause trouble again?”

“Haha, we don’t need to worry about that. We just have to enjoy the show.”

By now it was evident that whenever Ye Xuan bid, the guest in Suite 002 would suffer.

Meanwhile, in Suite 002, Feng Lu’s face darkened again when he noticed Ye Xuan.

“Is this b*stard trying to play me again?”

His subordinate quickly looked at Feng Lu and tried to stop him.

“Prince Zhanglu, let’s not act on impulse this time. After all, this guy is obviously trying to set you up.”

Feng Lu glared at his subordinate and shouted angrily, “Shut up!”

“Do you think I don’t know that? No matter what, this time, I will definitely not bid again!”

When the auction hostess announced the starting price, Ye Xuan was also the first to bid.

But this time, he did not call out a bid of over 100 million taels. Instead, his bid was only 10 million taels. He did not forget to look in Feng Lu’s direction with a teasing expression.

When he noticed Ye Xuan’s expression, Feng Lu became even gloomier.

‘He’s actually goading me?’

‘Damn it! Does this guy really think that I have the intelligence of a three-year-old?’

He would not be fooled this time!

However, he only bid 10 million taels this time. What was this kid up to?

Feng Lu could not figure it out, but after seeing Ye Xuan’s teasing expression, he became certain that this was another trap.

He did some rough calculations and realized that he had spent almost all of the money he had brought with him.

Moreover, there were still other treasures that the auction house had yet to put up for bidding. If he were to spend a large amount now, he would have to spend the rest of the auction watching in jealousy.

“I must endure this time.”

The crowd was very surprised. Was Suite 002 not going to rise to the challenge this time? This was not his style.

“Haha, things are getting more and more interesting.”

In Suite 003, the lady in the red dress had already figured out what Ye Xuan was up to, and the corners of her mouth curled up.

She was even more interested in the man in Suite 001. After all, no ordinary person could toy with someone like this.

At present, that man had placed such a low bid, yet no one was daring enough to challenge it.

“Young Miss…”

At this moment, a maidservant next to her spoke up.

“The VIP in Suite 002 is a prince of the Yangli divine empire. He is called Prince Zhanglu.”

“However, we don’t have any leads regarding the identity of the VIP in Suite 001.”

“That being said, the person in charge of the Qingyang Restaurant seems to be very respectful toward this distinguished guest. He must have a great background.” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Hearing this, the lady in the red dress was momentarily stunned before she waved her hand at her subordinate.

“Alright, I understand. You may leave.”

After thinking for a while, she began to wonder who this man was.

“If even Han Sikong is being so nice to him, he must have a powerful background.”

However, after pondering this matter for quite some time, she still could not formulate any guesses as to who it might be, so she temporarily put this matter aside.

As Prince Zhanglu did not raise the price, the other guests did not dare to provoke the guest in Suite 001. Hence, the auction hall was unusually quiet.

Ye Xuan did not know what to say.

He had only spent 10 million taels of profound silver to buy this earth treasure flower?

This was a pleasant surprise.

The prince was probably getting wary after being tricked twice.

As the gavel fell, Ye Xuan easily got himself a cheap spiritual herb.

After obtaining the earth treasure flower, Ye Xuan was no longer interested in the next auction items.

The auction was coming to an end, and it would soon be time for the main auction highlight, which was the treasures that Ye Xuan had prepared.

Because the prince was no longer so gullible, Ye Xuan did not try to trick him again. After all, he had already fleeced this prince for plenty of money during the first two auction bids.

This sum would be enough to supply him and his disciples with enough herbs and materials for alchemy for a long time.

However, what shocked Ye Xuan was that someone else was fighting with the prince for the two final items, to the extent that the bid reached tens of billions!

Ye Xuan looked in the direction of Suite 003 with confusion. Although he could not see her face clearly, he could tell that she was a beautiful woman.

Why did she like these Yama’s needles so much?

Ye Xuan could not think of a reason, so he decided not to think about it too much. In any case, it was profitable for him.

“Let’s leave. We should be able to reach the Immortal Divine sect in time.”

After saying that, Ye Xuan prepared to leave the auction house with his two disciples.

...

He did not need to worry about dealing with the post-auction procedures, as Han Sikong would handle it. The proceeds from the auction and the herbs he wanted to purchase would be sent to Cloud Sky peak.

After walking out of the auction house and having a brief conversation with Han Sikong, Ye Xuan decided to take his two disciples directly to the Immortal Divine sect.

However, at this moment, a loud voice rang out.

“You provoked me, yet you’re delusional enough to think you can escape unscathed?”

As soon as he finished speaking, Feng Lu approached Ye Xuan with a furious expression.

Ye Xuan also turned around and glanced at him indifferently, a calm smile still on his face.

‘Hehe, could it be that this foolish prince is trying to lose more than just his money?’

Ye Xuan thought this to himself, but did not say anything. He wanted to see what kind of tricks the prince had up his sleeve.
