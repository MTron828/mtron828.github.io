“Ding! Congratulations! The host has obtained the heaven-rank divine power, the Nine Serenities of Frost technique!”

Ye Xuan’s mouth twitched when he saw this.

He was seriously suspecting that the system had already arranged this beforehand. It seemed like it knew that he was lacking an ice-type divine power, and had decided to give him one out of the blue.

Still, this was not a bad thing.

“Yueyue, come over here.”

!!

Since he had it, he would teach it to Yueyue. After seeing her disappointed expression earlier, he had been thinking of teaching her the Flora Sword technique.

However, the Flora Sword technique was a divine-rank technique, and it was not something that ordinary cultivators could cultivate.

Were it not for the power of the Golden Lotus of Great Dao, even Ye Xuan would not have been able to successfully cultivate it.

Normal divine powers were divided into heaven, earth, black, and yellow ranks. The power of a heaven-rank divine power was already extremely powerful. If she could successfully cultivate it, Zhuge Yueyue’s strength would definitely increase by a large extent.

“Teacher, why did you call me over?”

Zhuge Yueyue walked over cautiously. Although she had a smile on her face, she could not hide the disappointment in her heart.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan’s gaze suddenly softened.

“Girl, have a seat.”

“You’ve already cultivated the Cloud Sky sword technique to the minor mastery stage. After some careful consideration, I think it’s time to teach you another divine power.”

Zhuge Yueyue’s eyes brightened when she heard this. The disappointment in her gaze disappeared.

It turned out that her teacher had always kept her in mind.

“Thank you, Teacher. I’ll definitely cultivate diligently.”

The smile on Zhuge Yueyue’s face brightened, and her eyes were filled with excitement.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan could not help but smile.

This girl was quite easy to satisfy.

In fact, compared to Feng Xiyun, Ye Xuan doted on Zhuge Yueyue more.

Although Feng Xiyun had been reduced to a marriage tool of the royal family, at least she still had a home to return to.

Zhuge Yueyue’s parents had died tragic deaths at the hands of the berserk beasts. Now, he was the last person this girl could rely on. If he abandoned or ignored her, perhaps she would end up depressed and disheartened.

“What I’m going to teach you is the Nine Serenities of Frost technique, a heaven-rank divine power.”

“Heaven-rank divine powers are extremely profound. You must cultivate diligently in order to comprehend them. Of course, if you encounter any problems, you can come and ask me at any time.”

“Remember, when you cultivate, don’t rush things. Take it step by step,” Ye Xuan patiently instructed.

“Don’t worry, Teacher. I won’t let you down!”

“En!” Ye Xuan smiled and nodded. He reached out and touched Zhuge Yueyue’s forehead.

As a stream of light flashed, and all the information about the Nine Serenities of Frost suddenly appeared in Zhuge Yueyue’s mind.

When that happened, the profound ice divine bone in Zhuge Yueyue’s body trembled slightly, as if it had been stimulated by some kind of power, and it started to release waves of power.

When Zhuge Yueyue sensed this, she was overjoyed. It seemed like this divine power was compatible with her divine bone.

She immediately sat down cross-legged and began to comprehend the mysteries of the Nine Serenities of Frost in detail.

After an unknown period of time, the surrounding temperature started falling, as her body exuded an icy cold aura.

After some time, she gained a basic grasp of the divine power and began integrating it into the Cloud Sky sword technique. Her sharp sword qi now seemed to shine with an exceedingly cold edge.

Seeing that his two disciples were working hard on their cultivation, Ye Xuan did not disturb them. Instead, he quietly stood guard beside them.

Of the two disciples he had taken in, one cultivated scorching fire, while the other cultivated freezing ice. Their attributes were completely different.

However, to Ye Xuan’s disappointment, teaching the Nine Serenities of Frost technite to Zhuge Yueyue did not trigger a system’s reward.

Of course, he was not too bothered by this.

Time flew by, and the night quickly passed. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The next morning, within the bustling streets of Qingyang City, three beautiful figures appeared.

“Senior Sister and Xin’er, come over and take a look at this hairpin. Do you think it will look good on me??”

Feng Xiyun was somewhat excited as she picked out jewelry on the streets.

“Of course I think it will look good on you,” Zhuge Yueyue said with a smile.

After that, Zhuge Yueyue, Feng Xiyun, and Xin’er strolled the streets for half a day. If they came across anything interesting, they would buy it without any hesitation.

Feng Xiyun had grown up in the royal palace, and as such was very curious about these rare and unusual things.

Just as Feng Xiyun was chatting with Zhuge Yueyue, an elegant-sounding voice rang out.

“I feel that this jade pendant is the most suitable for this fairy!”

When Zhuge Yueyue, Feng Xiyun, and Xin’er heard this, they looked in the direction of the voice. A young man had suddenly appeared behind them.

His appearance was quite handsome, and his words were gentle and elegant.

However, Zhuge Yueyue frowned.

Others might not be able to tell, but Zhuge Yueyue could clearly sense that the man’s eyes were slightly intrusive.

He seemed to be sizing her up from the corner of his eyes. He was definitely up to no good!

Compared to Zhuge Yueyue’s aloof attitude, Feng Xiyun was undoubtedly much more straightforward, as she said indifferently, “Your words are reasonable, but unfortunately I don’t like jade pendants.”

Lin Dong chuckled without revealing the slightest bit of anger. However, when he inadvertently saw Zhuge Yueyue beside Feng Xiyun, his eyes involuntarily lit up.

He did not expect that he would meet two goddesses while idling around today. If he could get these two women into bed, would not that be great?

Not only was Lin Dong the eldest young master of the Lin family in Qingyang City, he was also a disciple of Sun Mobai of the Immortal Divine sect!

It could be said that Lin Dong was born superior to others.

Whether it was in Qingyang City or the Immortal Divine sect, there was nothing he could not get his hands on if he wanted it.

No matter how beautiful a woman was, she could not escape from his grasp.
