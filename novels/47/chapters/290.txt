291 Anyone Who Takes A Step Forward Will Be Killed Without Mercy

A two-pattern condensation realm cultivator had died just like that.

Shangguan Wan’er’s eyes were cold.

“Shangguan Wan’er, what do you mean by this?” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

When the other hidden cultivators saw this, their expressions changed, and they looked at Shangguan Wan’er with fear.

The power of the triple intent fusion attack just now had shocked them.

Those were three seventh-level intents fused! How terrifying!

What did this woman want? We have not provoked her, have we?

“Hmph! Shangguan Wan’er!”

“Do you really think that you can get Ye Xuan’s Tower of Heaven by killing all of us?”

A three-pattern condensation realm expert said with an ugly expression.

“Isn’t your behavior a little inappropriate?”

“Even if your strength is monstrous, if we join forces, you may not be able to emerge unscathed!”

“Little girl, you’re still young. This old man doesn’t want to kill young geniuses. Don’t seek your own death!”

There were a total of fifteen of them, and all of them were pattern condensation realm experts.

The strongest among them was a four-pattern condensation realm expert. If they joined forces, things might turn out to be troublesome.

“A bunch of rats coveting my teacher’s treasure. Don’t pretend to make yourself sound better than you are,” Shangguan Wan’er said indifferently.

The Tower of Heaven was her teacher’s treasure. Moreover, her teacher had already promised that he would give it to her in the future. How could she allow these rascals to mess with it?

“Teacher?”

Hearing this, everyone frowned, their eyes questioning.

What did Shangguan Wan’er mean by that?

How could the most powerful person in the Miaoling Region, the master of the Luo Heaven Palace, have a teacher?

Could it be Ye Xuan?

How was that possible? It had to be someone else!

At that moment, everyone was confused.

“Anyone who dares to take a step forward will be killed without mercy!”

Shangguan Wan’er hovered in the air, and a destructive aura erupted from the longsword in her hand.

Shortly after, she waved her left hand, and a powerful formation enveloped the Qingyun sect.

Buzzzzzz!

Then, Shangguan Wan ‘er turned into a streak of light, and the destructive aura from her longsword swept out.

Another two-pattern condensation realm expert died!

“Detestable!”

“Don’t hesitate, everyone! Let’s suppress this woman together!”

Seeing this, everyone’s expressions changed.

As they knew that Ye Xuan’s strength was extraordinary, only pattern condensation realm experts had come.

They believed that they had the numbers to take care of Ye Xuan, but they had not expected Shangguan Wan’er to show up!

Furthermore, this woman seemed to have said that Ye Xuan was her teacher!

What the f*ck was going on?

One was the most powerful cultivator of the Miaoling Region, while the other was a demonic genius of the Nanzhou Region. The two regions were countless miles apart, so how did they even end up meeting?

What was the most confusing was that Shangguan Wan’er was probably stronger than Ye Xuan. Why did someone of her stature acknowledge Ye Xuan as her teacher?

If Shangguan Wan’er had said that Ye Xuan was her Dao partner, they would not have found it strange.

Originally, they had been quite afraid of Shangguan Wan’er’s strength, but it did not seem like she was going to stop attacking, so if they hesitated any longer, they would be the ones to die.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Terrifying energy fluctuations swept through the surroundings, and spatial cracks opened everywhere. Even the earth seemed to groan under the impact of the battle.

A black mist, flames, corrosive power, sword qi, and various other magical powers filled the sky as they fought to try and kill Shangguan Wan’er.

Seeing this, Shangguan Wan’er’s gaze turned cold.

Moments later, a stream of water gushed out of her body and enveloped another sword she had just taken out.

Waterfall Sword! This was the high-grade mystic weapon Ye Xuan had given her.

Although she could not fully unleash its power at the moment, it could still greatly enhance her strength.

The most important thing was that, after receiving 1,800 days’ worth of spiritual power from Ye Xuan, Shangguan Wan’er’s cultivation had made great progress.

Buzzzzzz!

Sharp saber qi flashed toward her from a distance.

It was an attack from a four-pattern condensation realm expert.

This expert had comprehended the profound patterns of the saber, sound waves, wave, and gravity!

This saber qi was the fusion of saber intent and wave intent. There were nine waves within the saber qi, each containing destructive power.

It was not only that. The expert had also used gravity intent to restrain Shangguan Wan’er, greatly reducing her speed.

It was said that if one’s gravity intent reached a certain level, one could pull everything in the world, even light.

Although this person could not do that at the moment, he had indeed affected Shangguan Wan’er’s movements.

Still, she did not show any signs of panic. She looked calmly at the approaching saber qi.

Moments later, Shangguan Wan’er raised the waterfall sword in her hand, and a sky-blue stream of sword qi suddenly burst out.

This sky-blue sword qi contained sword, ice and water intents.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

This sky-blue sword qi was like the brilliant milky way that fell from the nine heavens. It turned the nine-wave saber qi into nothingness with absolute power.

Not only that, but the destructive sword qi did not reduce in power. It swept toward that four-pattern condensation realm expert and destroyed his physical body instantly.

The wave intent was merely a minor branch of water intent. How could he possibly have hoped to triumph against her?

“Why aren’t you making a move?”

The expert whose physical body had been destroyed, who only had his soul remaining, immediately used his sound waves intent to urge the other cultivators to attack.

His heart was filled with shock.

He had encountered many powerful opponents before, but all of them had fallen to his nine-wave saber qi.

Yet this woman had casually defeated his most powerful attack without even batting an eyelid.

She did not even bother to dodge his attack!
