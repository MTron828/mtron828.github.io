Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

After the little monkey snatched the pill away, he immediately swung the

Jingu Staff at the incoming palm. At the same time, he unleashed his aura. “Oh my god… He’s actually reached the sealed immortal realm!”

“When did this furry monkey break through to the sealed immortal realm?” At this moment, everyone was extremely shocked.

Not long ago, the furry monkey had been seriously injured and fled with his tail between his legs. Moreover, at that time, he was only a supreme realm expert.

How did he manage to bypass the ancient realm and reach the sealed immortal realm within such a short period of time?

“Hehehe!”

“I’ll beat you to death with my staff!”

After taking the medicinal pill, the furry monkey could no longer suppress himself, and immediately picked a fight with the old man.

One had to know that the monkey loved fighting, so given that he had endured so much pain in order to break through and reach the sealed immortal realm, there was no way he was going to let go of such a good sparring partner.

The Jingu Staff instantly became bigger as it crashed into the incoming palm!

Boom!

“Damned monkey, how dare you!’

The old man immediately cursed loudly, and the scene immediately turned chaotic.

Looking at this scene, Zhuge Yueyue thought about it for a while before she left the battlefield.

“First Sister, are you okay?” Feng Xiyun asked worriedly.

Zhuge Yueyue replied with a trace of lingering fear, “Fortunately, this furry monkey appeared at a good time. Otherwise, I’m afraid I really wouldn’t have been able to return.’

She was still feeling a little scared and clutching the jade pendant tightly in her hand. If the furry monkey had not made an appearance and messed with the old man, she would have probably called her teacher’s wife over.

She looked gratefully at the furry monkey in the sky. At this moment, the monkey even looked rather domineering.

As the shocking battle continued, a seal in the forbidden are a seemed to be on the verge of breaking.

Zhuge Yueyue happened to notice this, and upon closer examination, she sensed a shadow emitting an evil aura behind the seal. She immediately felt that something was wrong with this situation.

At this very moment, the little monkey unknowingly swung his staff at the

seal…

Boom!

Accompanied by a huge explosion, the seal that was originally on the verge of breaking, shattered completely. A demon king who had fallen into a deep sleep slowly opened his eyes at this moment.

At this moment, the sky instantly darkened, and dense black shadows continuously appeared in the sky.

“Heavens! What exactly happened?”

A strong wind blew. After realizing the sudden situation, the onlookers’ expressions changed drastically.

The old man in the sky frowned at this moment as he looked at the figure in the depths of the forbidden area with fear.

“Retreat!”

He did not want to continue fighting with the monkey, and turned to leave with Gongsun Zhi.

However, how could the little monkey let them leave so easily?

“Hehe, why are you running away? Watch as I beat you to death with my staff! ”

At this moment, the little furry monkey had no idea that his earlier attack had released a terrifying demon king. Therefore, he was enjoying the fight with reckless abandon. He swung the Jingu Staff at the old man at full power.

“Damn it! Get lost!”

The old man was clearly enraged. He just wanted to get away from here, yet this damned monkey was not letting him leave.

Sh*t! F*ck!

Seeing that the sleeping demon king was about to awaken completely, he knew that if he did not run now, he would really be finished.

After he made up his mind, he immediately gathered his strength.

Divine runes that emitted an ancient aura appeared out of thin air. They instantly released a terrifying amount of energy that suppressed the scene.

“My goodness! This seemed to be the legacy technique of the Immortal Divine sect, the Primordial Godfiend technique!’

After this spell was used, people could guess the old man’s identity.

Although he did not want to provoke this demon king in the depths of the forbidden area, he had no choice but to do so because of the monkey’s interference.

As expected, when the old man used the Primordial Godfiend Technique, a pair of blood-red eyes instantly locked onto the old man. Then, a roar resounded.

After hearing this roar, the onlookers felt a chill run down their backs and instantly broke out in cold sweat. They felt as if a prehistoric beast was standing in front of them.

“What a terrifying aura!”

At this moment, Zhuge Yueyue also realized how terrifying this demon king was.

The killing intent released by this sealed demon king was so terrifying that even Zhuge Yueyue felt petrified. She had not felt so helpless even in front of Mengyu.

From this, one could tell how terrifying this demon king was.

“Second Sister, the situation is dangerous. We must be prepared to escape at any time.”

After thinking for a moment, Zhuge Yueyue had already made a decision. She stood up and started to scan her surroundings.

Feng Xiyun agreed without hesitation. She had also sensed how terrifying the existence in the forbidden zone was.

After that roar, the entire area fell silent as if someone had pressed the pause button.

However, when the people regained consciousness, they realized in horror that they could not move their bodies. “What happened? Why can’t I move?”

“What is going on?”

The scene instantly turned chaotic. People tried their best to escape, but they could not move at all. All they could do was shout, and their expressions were already full of panic.Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

On the other side, Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun were also frozen. No matter how hard they tried, they could not move.

“Damn it!”

After trying to escape for a while, Zhuge Yueyue’s face had already turned pale and powerless. She felt very helpless.

When the demon king had just broken the seal, she had already sensed that something was wrong and wanted to escape. However, before she could escape, she had already been imprisoned by the demon king.

“What sort of technique is this?”

Feng Xiyun also asked with a face full of panic. It was obviously the first time she had seen such a powerful imprisonment technique..
