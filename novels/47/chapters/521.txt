522 Strange Power

Elder Taiyin regarded this strange power as his source of hope, and he directly absorbed it into his body.

Then, when the strange power entered his body, Elder Taiyin was surprised to find that his withered body was slowly recovering its vitality!

In addition, after obtaining this strange power, his cultivation bottleneck loosened slightly, and his strength rose. This was how he had become a half-step supreme realm expert.

However, there was a price to pay for using this strange power. If he could not break through to the supreme realm before his body completely withered, he would have to use this strange power to break through.

!!

Then he would become a monster that lacked consciousness!

Elder Taiyin’s actions could be described as crazy, but he was such a person.

Even if he did not succeed in the end and instead became a monster, so what? As long as there was a chance, it was fine!

At this moment, both of Elder Taiyin’s eyes had turned completely black, and black mist was being emitted from his body, which looked extremely terrifying.

Thanks to this strange power, Elder Taiyin’s strength had advanced to the supreme realm.

At this moment, everyone was panicking and felt a deep sense of fear.

The one who was most shocked was Chu Tianba. After all, Elder Taiyin was standing right in front of him, but he could no longer recognize his opponent.

Elder Tongtian immediately sensed that something was wrong, so he launched an attack to force Daoist Qing Feng back. He wanted to help Chu Tianba.

“Haha, Elder Tongtian, I’m the one you need to deal with right now!”

There was no way Daoist Qing Feng would let Elder Tongtian go over now.

Elder Taiyin was now glaring at Chu Tianba dangerously.

He was still able to control his body. After all, the strange power had not completely corroded his body.

Moments later, he said in an unruly tone, “Chu Tianba, this day next year will be your death anniversary!”

As soon as he said that, Elder Taiyin attacked. The spiritual energy within a 100-meter radius gathered toward him as he unleashed a majestic sword attack.

Upon seeing this, Chu Tianba broke out in cold sweat. He immediately used the dark lotus technique to resist the attack.

Unexpectedly, this secret technique could not even last for a moment. It was shattered by Elder Taiyin’s attack, and Chu Tianba was sent flying a hundred meters away. He continuously spat out mouthful after mouthful of blood, and his aura was thrown into disarray.

Now that Elder Taiyin had reached the supreme realm, how could he possibly resist?

“Hehe!”

Elder Taiyin laughed complacently. Then, he raised his sword and shouted with his head held high.

“Come on! Bring it on!”

Seeing this, everyone even began to breathe carefully, for fear of inciting Elder Taiyin’s ire. They had clearly felt the terror of the attack he had just unleashed.

At this moment, an extremely lazy voice rang out.

“Oh, really? Why don’t you let me give it a go?”

The moment those words were spoken, everyone turned to look at the source of the voice.

“Who is it?”

Was there still someone who dared to provoke Elder Taiyin under such circumstances? 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Was this not courting death?

While everyone was looking around, a spatial crack suddenly appeared in the sky. Immediately after, a white-robed figure appeared in the air.

After seeing who it was, everyone covered their mouths in shock.

“It’s actually Ye Xuan!”

Ye Xuan was hovering in the air, emitting sharp sword intent that caused space to distort around him.

As Ye Xuan’s figure gradually approached, the onlookers could clearly sense that his body actually possessed the unique aura of a supreme realm expert!

“Heavens!”

“Could it be that Ye Xuan has also reached the supreme realm?”

At this moment, everyone could not help but rub their eyes in disbelief.

Although Ye Xuan was limiting his strength to the peak of the mystic lord realm, his aura had long revealed his actual cultivation.

“Quick, give me a slap and see if it hurts. How exactly did he advance to the supreme realm so quickly?”

“Ye Xuan must have obtained a great opportunity in the ancient tomb.”

While the onlookers were in a heated discussion, another cultivator said, “Haha, this matter is getting more and more interesting. A battle between two supreme realm experts… Who will be the winner? I’m really looking forward to it.”

At this moment, the onlookers hurriedly retreated in order to avoid being caught up in the battle.

“Ye Xuan!”

Once he saw Ye Xuan, Elder Taiyin’s face contorted into an ugly mess. He was burning with anger.

He had only lost twice in his life. The first time was to Chief Tian Xuan, and the second time was to Ye Xuan!

In the heat of the moment and his fury, Elder Taiyin was gradually losing control over the strange power in his body. However, as a result, his strength was rising rapidly.

Behind Ye Xuan, a beautiful figure gradually appeared.

Yuelun had just appeared, but she had already sensed that something was wrong with Elder Taiyin. She frowned and said, “What is that strange power?”

Ye Xuan also stared at Elder Taiyin with an expression of curiosity, and said, “This is quite fun. I’ve actually seen this strange power before.”

“Even though it’s very powerful, it affects one’s consciousness. If one isn’t careful, they might lose their minds and become puppets.”

“I discovered it near the boundary some time ago, but I didn’t expect that Elder Taiyin would also find some and absorb it…”
