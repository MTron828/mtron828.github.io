919 Immortal-Grade Treasure

“Not only that, but many of the disciples of the Seal Divine sect also became Wan Tu’s targets for blood sacrifice when they pursued him.”

“Blood sacrifice?”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan instantly thought of Mengyu.

Ye Xuan stared at Wan Tu for a while, but there was still no expression on his face. It was also unclear what he was thinking.

After a moment, Yanran continued, “In the blink of an eye, hundreds of years have passed, and Wan Tu has successfully reached the sealed immortal realm based on the Dao of Slaughter.”

“There’s no one in the current Seal Divine sect that can defeat him.”

After saying this, Yanran sighed. She did not choose to help. After all, this was a grudge within the Seal Divine sect. As an outsider, it was not her place to intervene.

At that moment, the battle had become more and more intense. One by one, the members of the Seal Divine sect were killed.

Even so, they still continued to charge forward heroically. Seeing this scene, Ye Xuan was also deeply moved. He recalled that the Great Wilderness Divine sect was also like this back then.

He sighed, but just as he was about to speak, a huge rumble was suddenly heard from the bottom of the sea.

“Oh? What happened?”

Ye Xuan was momentarily stunned before his spiritual sense swept out to check things out. There, he saw a golden-furred monkey at the bottom of the sea, holding his staff and constantly stirring it up.

“Eh? Why is the little monkey here?”

Ye Xuan was surprised. This little fellow had disappeared for a long time, and now suddenly appeared here?

After running away, the little monkey felt that its abilities were not strong enough, so it returned to find his teacher and learn more powerful abilities.

However, unexpectedly, when he returned, the Seven-Star Cave Abode had already disappeared without a trace.

At that moment, Wu Kong felt as if it had lost its loved one, and felt extremely depressed.

He even felt that it was all because he had lost to that expert from the other continent, which disgraced his teacher. This was why his teacher had left quietly, right?

It was from then on that Wu Kong started to go all out and cultivated like his life depended on it. He wanted to give himself a chance, a chance to redeem himself and restore his teacher’s reputation.

Within these few months, he had reached the supreme realm, and had even mastered many powerful divine powers.

After he reached a certain level, he began to search for treasures everywhere. Coincidentally, when he was searching in the East Sea, he accidentally discovered this ancient palace, and unsealed it.

Ye Xuan’s expression was unusually serious when he saw the waves in the East Sea. Thanks to what Wu Kong was doing, the ancient palace emitted bursts of bright light.

Immediately after, an immortal aura was released, which everyone sensed.

“It’s actually an immortal-grade treasure!”

Ou Yunhai became excited, his eyes filled with greed.

He had waited for such a long time just to wait for this treasure to appear. Without delay, he plunged into the ancient palace.

The moment they saw Ou Yunhai move, the experts who had been hiding in wait made their move as well. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Hehehe, this treasure will definitely belong to me, and none of you can take it away!”

Leaving behind this sentence, a skinny old man instantly plunged into the ancient palace, followed by many other experts.

A series of battles would soon break out.

At this moment, the entire ancient palace shook violently, and the situation was extremely chaotic.

Yanran turned to look at Ye Xuan. Seeing that the latter was still calm, she asked, “What are you doing just standing around? Are you waiting for this immortal-grade treasure to deliver itself to you?”

Was this guy not too nonchalant? Even if he did not want it for himself, he could still give it to his disciples, right?

Well, if he would not make a move, she would. Thinking this, she joined the fray and clashed with the other experts for several rounds. Fortunately, she had the upper hand.

At this moment, Ye Xuan was still observing his surroundings. These hidden sealed immortal realm experts were quite strong, and it seemed that they had reached the limits of this world for quite some time.

Chaotic battles had broken out everywhere, and the entire East Sea was trembling. In the sky, when the immortal-grade treasure was unveiled, Wan Tu stopped fighting the members of the Seal Divine sect.

He instantly sent out a wave of power that forced them all back. His eyes were fixed in the direction of the ancient palace, and the corners of his mouth curled into a sinister arc.

“Hahaha! This treasure definitely belongs to me!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he unleashed an attack. Surprisingly, the target was Yanran, who was fighting two other sealed immortal realm experts!

However, someone intercepted the attack!

A blood-red sword beam stopped his attack, and then a figure appeared in front of him.

“Oh?”

Wan Tu was stunned. He had never seen Ye Xuan before.

“Who exactly are you? You actually dared to block my attack. Aren’t you a little too bold?”

Wan Tu was very angry at this moment. He had been in seclusion for the past years, and was unaware of what was happening in the outside world.

Even though he would occasionally come out and kill once or twice to conduct some blood sacrifices, he would not stay for too long before returning to seclusion.

Moreover, the eight continents were still separated at that time, so how could he know who Ye Xuan was?
