At this moment, in the Great Wilderness Divine sect of the Heaven continent, a peerless figure slowly opened her eyes.

With just a raise of her hand or a raise of her foot, she could release terrifying power, causing the sky to tremble.

She took out a bronze mirror. The image projected within it was Ye Xuan.

After seeing Ye Xuan, a smile bloomed on Yanran’s calm face. She wished she could immediately go to Ye Xuan’s side. However, because she had just broken through, she could not immediately end her secluded cultivation. Therefore, she could only transmit her voice to Ye Xuan and tell him about the golden-furred growler race.

After receiving Yanran’s voice transmission, Ye Xuan finally understood why the older golden-furred growler was so arrogant.

The other party actually had someone backing him up.

In that case, Ye Xuan really might not be unable to do anything to him.

Even though Ye Xuan was not afraid of trouble, he had to consider the sect, as well of his disciples. Furthermore, he had plenty of enemies to worry about already, whether it was the experts from the other continents, or the mysterious master of the strange realm.

It was not the time to make more enemies. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Junior Brother Ye, if it’s too troublesome, then let’s just forget about this matter. It’s not worth the trouble.”

Sensing the tense atmosphere at the scene, Gao Shun felt like backing off. Something was off. Otherwise, why would this older golden-furred growler not be afraid at all when faced with a sealed immortal realm expert.

After hearing Gao Shun’s words, Ye Xuan considered the matter. However, before he could make his decision, Yanran sent him another voice transmission.

“Ye Xuan, don’t be afraid. Their golden-furred growler race has someone backing them up, but so does our Great Wilderness Sect.”

“Don’t be afraid of trouble. I can contact the people of the Heavenly Dao World at any time. I’ll always be on your side.”

After hearing this, Ye Xuan almost laughed out loud.

It seemed that his girlfriend was really reliable.

“Hehe, a sealed immortal realm expert is just a coward, after all. If you really have the ability, then go ahead and attack!”

Seeing that Ye Xuan was hesitating, the older golden-furred growler became more arrogant. He wanted to insult a sealed immortal realm expert in public.

However, what he did not know was that when he said these words, Ye Xuan’s eyes turned cold again.

Even if it caused trouble, it was worth it. Ever since coming to this world, this was the first time he had met such an arrogant person. As a sealed immortal realm expert, and the East continent’s foremost expert, he could not back down.

In an instant, his aura erupted and locked onto the older golden-furred growler.

After sensing this, the older golden-furred growler’s back was covered in cold sweat. However, he still did not think that Ye Xuan would dare to attack him. He thought that Ye Xuan was just putting on an act.

“Hehe, don’t pretend. If you really have the ability, just do it.””

As soon as he finished speaking, a sword beam shot toward the older golden-furred growler before it could continue to act arrogantly.

At this moment, his expression turned fearful.

He really did not expect Ye Xuan to actually dare to attack him. Furthermore, Ye Xuan did not even say anything before attacking.

On the other side, everyone who was watching this scene was also dumbfounded.

In the blink of an eye, the sword beam pierced the older golden-furred growler.

“Father!”

The little golden-furred growler cried out helplessly. He could only watch the tragedy unfold in front of him.

Boom!

A body crashed into the ground, and blood stained the ground.

The two halves of the older golden-furred growler had already lost all signs of life. After that, Ye Xuan shot a glance at the little golden-furred growler.

However, he did not act. It would be up to the younger generation of the East continent to deal with this troublemaker.

Looking down at the corpse on the ground, he said disdainfully, “Ever since I was young, this is the first time I’ve seen someone beg me to kill him.”

“Ever since I became a sealed immortal realm expert, no one has dared to speak to me like this. You can be considered the first, and hopefully the last.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan dug out the older golden-furred growler’s precious bones. Then, he turned around and looked at the group of people in the sky, which frightened them.

It was obvious that no one had expected Ye Xuan to be so bold. He actually killed an expert with such a powerful background without even blinking.

In the future, people would have to think twice about provoking Ye Xuan.

“How terrifying. Why is this person so bold?”

“Those people have probably discovered what happened. If one of them descends, what will happen?”

At this moment, everyone was very afraid that they would be dragged into it.

Suddenly, a ray of red light shot out from the corpse and instantly disappeared from the void.

Ye Xuan did not interfere too much at this time. He could only sense powerful energy fluctuations in the sky. Then, a door appeared.

At this moment, a terrifying aura swept out, causing everyone to involuntarily hold their breaths.
