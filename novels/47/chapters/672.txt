673 Yun Hai Appears (Part 2)

Seeing that Yun Hai was defeated in an instant, everyone felt despair.

He was supposed to be their savior!

“Ugh…”

Yun Hai struggled to spit out the soil in his mouth. Then, he climbed out of the pit with great difficulty.

!!

He had really underestimated her.

After taking out a recovery pill and consuming it, Yun Hai felt a little better and once again floated into the air.

His face was very gloomy.

He had just made a fool of himself in front of so many people. How was he supposed to show his face in public in the future?

After taking a deep breath, Yun Hai became furious. He had to regain his pride, or he would forever remain a laughingstock.

“Little girl, you are indeed quite strong. However, I only underestimated you earlier and did not dodge…”

“You might have succeeded the first time, but I’m going all out now. Be careful!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yun Hai instantly mobilized his spiritual power and channeled it into his sword, which started releasing an extremely terrifying sword aura.

When the others saw this, they regained a sense of hope.

Yun Hai’s face had an evil smile as he suddenly attacked.

Cold sword beams flashed toward Xiang Yun in an instant, and it seemed impossible to dodge the attacks.

However, before the sword beams could touch her, Xiang Yun raised her hammer in front of her body, pointing its head toward Yun Hai. Then, as everyone watched incredulously, the hammer suddenly expanded. Not only did it block all of the sword beams, but it also expanded length-wise to crash into Yun Hai!

With a loud bang, Yun Hai crashed onto the ground again. He spat out a few mouthfuls of blood, and could tell that many of his bones had been broken.

At this moment, Yun Hai was filled with self-doubt. What was the use of living in this world?

Everyone finally gave up helplessly. It seemed that this so-called genius would not be able to save them.

“Ugh…”

Yun Hai used all his strength to crawl to his feet. The attack just now could be considered his strongest attack. However, it had been simply swatted away uselessly by Xiang Yun’s hammer. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Ice Dao Kid, are you done? Hurry up and do something if you aren’t!”

Xiang Yun shouted. She had run out of patience. She wanted to get rid of these people as soon as possible and check on her second sister.”

“Yes… Forget it, I’m not playing with you anymore,” Yun Hai said without hesitation. Although he was unwilling, he could only accept his fate.

There was no point in struggling anymore.

Thinking this, Yun Hai suddenly felt even more wronged. He had painstakingly prepared so many things, but had still lost to a six-year-old girl.

Without hesitation, he turned around and voluntarily exited the ancient realm. He was not only scarred physically, but also mentally.

After seeing Yun Hai leave, everyone else looked at each other worriedly.

“What should we do now? Should we voluntarily admit defeat, or fight this little girl to the death?”

“Even though that Yun Hai guy was useless, he was truly a peak-level void realm expert. What chance do we have against her?”

After thinking for a long time, the onlookers spoke up one after another.

“Brothers, I hope you manage to get a good ranking and give this little girl a good beating. I suddenly remembered that I have to go back and take care of my mother, so I’ll take my leave first.”

“Ah okay. No worries. My wife is going to give birth soon, so I’ll be leaving too.”

After coming up with random excuses, many people chose to withdraw. The remaining people were already so scared that their legs were trembling.

What could they do now?

Outside the entrance to the ancient realm, streaks of light flashed, and the Supreme Divine sect disciples appeared in sorry states one after another and fell to the ground.
