901 Forcefully Increasing Strength

“When I return to the Great Wilderness Divine sect, I must tell the others about this.”

“Hahaha! I can’t believe that such a beautiful sealed immortal realm expert is married to Junior Brother Ye. This is really shocking news.”

“Junior Brother Ye, you really hid this from us well.”

Lu Xiu excitedly said these words. The worry on his face had completely disappeared, and it was as if the crisis in front of him did not exist.

Seeing how excited Lu Xiu was, and the heated discussion that had broken out between the sect’s disciples, Zhuge Yueyue felt somewhat helpless, and a little regretful.

Perhaps she should not have made this matter public. Now, the sect’s cultivators were discussing Ye Xuan’s love life, instead of how to deal with the crisis at hand.

Zhuge Yueyue, on the other hand, kept glancing up at the battle in the sky with concern.

After pondering for a moment, she could not help but say, “Martial Uncle Lu, shouldn’t we discuss how to deal with this crisis? The matter regarding my teacher’s relationship can wait till later, right?”

“Cough cough…”

Lu Xiu snapped back to his senses. After a while, he suddenly said, “That seems to be the case. Then, let’s leave your teacher’s matter for later.”

After saying this, Lu Xiu immediately looked at the sect’s disciples with a serious expression and shouted, “What are you all doing? Can’t you see that we’re facing a serious situation here?”

“The battle is still going on. Focus!”

After being chastised, the disciples felt somewhat wronged. Had it not been Martial Uncle Lu who started the conversation about Ye Xuan’s love life in the first place?

However, they all still shifted their gazes back to the battle in the sky. At this moment, the fighting had become even more intense.

Yanran kept using the Great Desolate technique, and despite the six lightning tiger clan experts’ best efforts, they were the ones at a disadvantage.

Then, she managed to injure one of them, and knocked him back. She then turned around to deal with the rest, but while she was dealing with four of them, another one suddenly attacked from behind.

“Go to hell!”

The six sealed immortal realm experts were going all out in an attempt to kill Yanran.

She sensed that the situation was getting dangerous, and immediately freed one of her hands and slapped the one who had tried to attack her from behind.

“Scum, you’re the one who deserves to die!”

Her palm strike destroyed the incoming attack, and she quickly followed up by kicking him away into the distance.

“Damn it!”

In an instant, two of the remaining six had suffered heavy injuries, and it was certain as to whether they would be able to rejoin the fight. Shan Shui, was the leader of the seven, had already become flustered and exasperated.

If the situation continued to develop in this, they would definitely all be defeated!

This was because this world’s laws had a powerful suppressive force on them. Even if they possessed powerful strength, they could not unleash it.

“It seems that you now realize how powerful a sealed immortal realm expert is in their own world,” Yanran snickered.

Shan Shui was unwilling to accept this, so he stubbornly said, “You reckless little ant, how dare you insult us like this!”

Defeat was not an option here. If they really lost today, then their reputation would take a hit in the Heavenly Dao realm, and everyone would laugh at them for their inability to deal with the cultivators of this lower world.

Furious, but out of options, Shan Shui decided to risk it all. Despite the laws of the world suppressing his strength, he used a secret technique to forcefully push his strength back up to its peak.

Moments later, blood-colored light instantly enveloped the entire East Sea, causing everyone’s figures to tremble and sway. Many almost fell to the ground.

“This aura is too terrifying. Has he reached the eternal realm?”

At this moment, everyone was shocked. How could Shan Shui release his original power in this world?

Down below, Lu Xiu immediately noticed this situation and shouted, “Oh no! If I’m not wrong, this is the exclusive ability of the lightning tiger clan!”

“By paying a great price, they can forcefully stimulate their power, even to the point where it can ignore the suppression of the laws of the world.”

At this moment, Lu Xiu was extremely nervous. Originally, he thought that Yanran would definitely be able to deal with the situation.

However, Shan Shui had actually ignored the ramifications of this technique and used it to forcefully turn the tides of battle back in his favor.

One had to know that he would have to pay a huge price for what he did. Even his cultivation foundation would be severely damaged, and it would be a miracle if he did not drop a major cultivation realm.

Sure enough, after Shan Shui regained his original power, the situation changed greatly. Yanran was a little powerless to do anything at this time.

Seeing the urgency of the situation, Lu Xiu immediately said, “Martial Niece Zhuge, don’t wait any longer. Quickly send news back to your teacher and tell him to hurry over,” Lu Xiu said anxiously.

After hearing this, Zhuge Yue Yue immediately took out her purple wind chime and sent the information back to Cloud Sky peak.

Up above, Shan Shui was surrounded by layers of blood-colored fog. He was laughing hysterically.

“Hehehe! A mere sealed immortal realm cultivator dared to humiliate us like this! I will now teach you the price of your arrogance! Today, no one can save you!”

Shan Shui’s face was full of arrogance as he shouted. Immediately after, he once again emitted an extremely powerful aura, instantly suppressing Yanran. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

However, after a while, she managed to adapt to the spiritual pressure. That being said, she was now at a grave disadvantage in terms of strength. Despite this dire situation, Yanran’s eyes were still filled with contempt for her enemy.
