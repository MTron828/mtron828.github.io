Chapter 148: 1,000x Critical Reward

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

As soon as he finished speaking, the little girl’s figure stopped abruptly. She turned around and looked at Ye Xuan in shock.

How did he know that anyone who got close to her would encounter bad luck? How did he know that the cultivation of the people around her would decrease?

Hearing this, the little girl’s pupils shrunk.

“I know all that, so naturally I am confident that you won’t be able to hurt me,” Ye Xuan looked straight into the little girl’s eyes and said gently.

He knew that the moment the little girl turned around, she had already believed him.

Then, Ye Xuan said, “If you take me as your master, I can solve all of your problems. In the future, you will be like a normal person and will no longer bring bad luck to the people around you. Moreover, you will become even stronger!”

“You… are you sure you’re not lying to me?”

Hearing this, the little girl was stunned. Her eyes were filled with disbelief.

‘Can I still be a normal person?’

“I’m speaking the truth.”

Ye Xuan smiled.

Hearing this, the final line of defense in the little girl’s heart was finally broken. Tears filled her dirty little face.

“Little girl, what should I call you?”

“Zhao Yuyan!”

The little girl said while sobbing.

“Zhao Yuyan, are you willing to be my disciple?” Ye Xuan’s gaze fell on Zhao Yuyan.

“I… I am willing!”

Zhao Yuyan raised her thin little hand and wiped the tears from her face. Her already dirty face became smudged when she did that.

After doing all this, Zhao Yuyan suddenly remembered something important.

After acknowledging a master, one had to pay respects to the master.

Although she did not know much about it, she had seen cultivators from the White Moon Tower pay their respects to their masters.

Immediately, Zhao Yuyan knelt on the ground with respect in her eyes and paid her respects to Ye Xuan.

After doing all this, Zhao Yuyan did not immediately stand up. Her cheek that was pressed against the ground let out a choking sound.

“Teacher… Please help Yan’er… Yan’er doesn’t want… doesn’t want to bring bad luck to anyone anymore!”

“Yuyan, now that you are my disciple, I will help you solve this problem!”

Ye Xuan took a step forward and suddenly appeared in front of Zhao Yuyan. Then, he extended his broad hand and gently helped Zhao Yuyan up.

“From today onward, you are my third disciple. When you see your two senior sisters in the future, don’t forget to greet them!”

“Oh right, your two senior sisters are also searching for treasures in this mystic realm. If you are fated, you will meet each other,” Ye Xuan said.

“As for your problem, I will help you solve it later. The most urgent thing now is to fill your stomach!”

Then, Ye Xuan got Zhao Yuyan to sit down, and then gently pressed his palm against Zhao Yuyan’s back, continuously injecting spiritual power into it to wash away her fatigue.

Then, Ye Xuan took out a large number of spirit fruits from his storage ring.

With Ye Xuan’s current realm, he no longer needed to replenish his spiritual power through eating. The spirit fruits in his storage ring were basically alchemy ingredients. Still, these fruits were beneficial to cultivators in the raw state.

Ye Xuan slowly extended his hand, and a spiritual fruit that looked almost like an apple suddenly appeared in his palm. He then handed it to Zhao Yuyan.

Zhao Yuyan first looked at Ye Xuan tentatively, after which she began to nibble on the spiritual fruit bit by bit.

However, as time passed, Zhao Yuyan started eating faster and faster. It seemed that she was indeed quite hungry.

“Ding! As the host has given his disciple the red life spirit fruit, the host has received a randomized 1,001x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the Fire Spirit Red Jade fruit!”

When he saw the notification, Ye Xuan’s eyes trembled.

1,001 times? Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Ever since he had obtained the system, there had never been such a large multiplier,

After all, the higher the multiplier, the lower the chance of obtaining it.

Other than the seventh-grade Nirvana pill, the highest multiplier he had obtained was when Li Qingyan had become an alchemist.

At that time, the multiplier was several hundred times, resulting in him immediately becoming a third-grade alchemist, along with thecorresponding knowledge and experience.

However, the critical reward he obtained this time was somewhat lacking. He only obtained another type of spirit fruit.

After all, when he handed the spirit fruit to Zhao Yuyan, he had not been thinking about the system’s reward. He only wanted her to fill her stomach.

The red life spirit fruit was also an extremely common medicinal herb used to refine pills. Other than being used to refine pills, it also had the effect of restoring a cultivator’s stamina.

He did not expect that such an ordinary fruit would actually result in a 1,001x critical reward.

Ye Xuan hurriedly looked at the description of the Fire Spirit Red Jade fruit.

As expected, the Fire Spirit Red Jade fruit was also a medicinal ingredient used to refine pills, and it was very effective in restoring the cultivator’s stamina. However, this spirit fruit also had an extremely special effect…

Which was to temper the fire spirit body!

Although it would not allow one’s fire spirit body to reach mastery immediately, after consuming it, a cultivator who possessed the fire spirit body, which was a special constitution, would undergo a great transformation.

Special constitutions were also divided into three realms, namely the initial realm, the advanced realm, and the completion realm.

The power difference between the realms was vast!

Ye Xuan’s current innate dual-spirit body and the Sword Overlord body were only at the initial realm. If he could reach the advanced realm, his strength would be greatly enhanced.

From this, it was clear to see how precious spiritual items that could temper special constitutions were.

Li Qingyan had a dual-spirit body, and he had an innate dual-spirit body. This Fire Spirit Red Jade fruit was of great use to both of them.

If they could find another heavenly treasure that could temper the wood spirit body, and consume it at the same time, its effect on their dual-spirit bodies would undoubtedly be even stronger.

Most importantly, if he gave this treasure to Li Qingyan, he might receive a system reward that might be able to directly raise his innate dual-spirit body to the advanced realm.

“Little girl, how are you a jinx? You’re practically a lucky star!”

Ye Xuan’s gaze fell on Zhao Yuyan, and he could not help but smile as he pinched the latter’s cheeks.

“Ah… Teacher, are you really okay?”
