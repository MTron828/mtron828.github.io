Chapter 61: One Move Is Enough To Kill You

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The reason why the leader of the Mad Saber sect came to Jiangqing City was for the sake of his disciple.

This remote city did not interest him at all.

Then, he entered a meditative state on the rooftop.

“As you command, Master!”

Chen Ping bowed to the leader of the Mad Saber sect and responded respectfully.

When he noticed the envious looks from the crowd, he felt very conceited.

Then, Chen Ping’s eyes turned to Li Qingyan.

However, when he found that the eyes of the other party remained indifferent to the presence of the leader of the Mad Saber sect, he narrowed his eyes.

“Humph, pretend all you want!”

“When I defeat you later, you will be a member and slave of my Chen family. I will trample upon you.”

“And those three little girls, I will not waste them and take them all as my concubines.”

At the thought of this, the long saber in Chen Ping’s hand shone. The tip of the saber was pointed in the direction of Li Qingyan.

“Li Qingyan, our battle is next. Don’t forget our agreement!”

......

As soon as those words were spoken, some cultivators who did not know what was going on revealed puzzled expressions.

An agreement? When did these two parties have an agreement? Could it be the marriage agreement?

“Ridiculous! I have never made an agreement with you. The reason why I came here is to let you know that you are not qualified to marry me!”

Li Qingyan raised her eyelids slightly and then said those words loudly. Then, she jumped up and stepped onto the arena like a swallow.

“Hahaha, this is really ridiculous. I am the strongest genius in Jiangqing City. If I don’t have the qualifications, then who does?”

“Do you really think that with your strength, you can withstand three moves from me? If I use my full strength, you won’t be able to even withstand one move from me. Moreover, I can kill you with one move!”

Chen Ping laughed angrily. His face alternated between shades of purple and green.

A mere seventh-level qi transformation realm cultivator actually dared to look down on him. Was she not courting death?

“One move? That makes sense. Indeed, I can finish you off in one move!”

Li Qingyan slowly raised the longsword in her hand. The sword flickered with sharp sword qi.

“You are courting death!”

Hearing this, Chen Ping’s eyes turned completely cold.

Originally, he wanted to play with Li Qingyan. Now, he only wanted to stomp Li Qingyan under his feet in the shortest possible time.

He wanted to let Li Qingyan know who was the strongest genius in Jiangqing City. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The long saber in Chen Ping’s hand released a half-moon-shaped saber qi. Slicing through the air, it flew toward Li Qingyan.

Li Qingyan’s expression did not change at all.

She waved her longsword, and her eight-level true essence realm cultivation surged forth.

When Chen Ping saw this, his facial expression changed drastically.

“This… This is true essence power?”

“How is this possible?”

At that moment, his eyes were full of disbelief.

This was definitely an illusion. Li Qingyan was supposed to be in the seventh level of the qi transformation realm? How could she have stepped into the true essence realm? This woman must have used some sort of illusion to trick him.

Yes, it had to be like this.

Chen Ping’s gaze turned ruthless. The half-moon curved saber qi released a bright light as it slashed toward Li Qingyan.

“No!”

At this moment, the leader of the Mad Saber sect who was meditating frowned slightly, and his eyes suddenly opened.

Li Qingyan… was this woman the Li Qingyan that Chen Ping mentioned?

In the intelligence report, it was stated that she was only at the seventh level of the qi transformation realm? Why did she reveal the strength of an eighth-level true essence realm cultivator now?

Could he have remembered that wrongly?

That was impossible. He was a top-tier core formation realm expert. How could he have misheard this sentence?

No, this was very wrong.

For a moment, the eyes of the leader of the Mad Saber sect were filled with doubt, and his heart was extremely conflicted.

Ever since he stepped into the core formation realm, he had never felt such emotions.

He had no choice. The shock that Li Qingyan had given him was too great. How could a seventh-level qi transformation realm cultivator turn into an eighth-level true essence realm cultivator within such a short time?

Chen Junhao had clearly told him earlier that Li Qingyan and Chen Ping were about the same age, but that her strength was slightly lower than Chen Ping’s, having only reached the seventh level of the qi transformation realm.

Moreover, in the previous genius competition held in Jiangqing City, Li Qingyan had been defeated by Chen Ping.

However, at this moment, Li Qingyan was clearly displaying the strength of an eighth-level true essence realm cultivator. How could such a talented genius lose to Chen Ping?

What exactly had gone wrong here?

The leader of the Mad Sabersect frowned and fell into a state of deep thought.

Chen Junhao was also stunned!

His cultivation had reached the sixth level of the purple spirit realm, so when Li Qingyan released her true strength, he suddenly realized that her cultivation was indeed at the eighth level of the true essence realm.

At that moment, Chen Junhao was at a loss. He did not know what had happened at all.

‘Wasn’t she supposed to be in the seventh level of the qi transformation realm? How did she reach the eighth level of the true essence realm in just a few days? Could this be any more ridiculous?’

Although the two of them felt that this was incredulous, they did not think of spiritual power infusion as the cause behind this.

Crack!

Boom!

Chen Junhao only reacted when the long saber in Chen Ping’s hand was suddenly cut off, and his son spat out blood onto the arena floor.

“Son!”

Chen Junhao’s facial expression changed greatly when he saw what had happened.

The aura around Chen Ping’s body had become extremely faint. Blood flowed from the corners of his mouth. He was holding the remaining half of the long saber in his hand as he kneeled on the arena with difficulty.

“Damn it!”

Seeing this, Chen Junhao’s eyes were filled with monstrous anger. His distraction had actually caused his precious son to be heavily injured.

It was not surprising though. Li Qingyan’s eighth-level true essence realm cultivation was just too shocking!

It was unbelievable that she had reached the eight-level of the true essence realm at such a young age.

Most importantly, he clearly remembered that a few days ago, Li Qingyan was still in the seventh level of the qi transformation realm. How did she increase her cultivation to such an extent?

This overload of information and disbelief had stunned him for a few seconds.

Swoosh!

A gleam of light flashed past. Chen Junhao’s fist, which was full of terrifying power, suddenly smashed into the arena’s defensive array formation. He then hurried over to Chen Ping.

Chen Ping, on the other hand, was kneeling on the arena floor with a pained expression. His body trembled, and blood kept spurting out of his mouth.

One move!

This woman actually cut off his long saber with just one move. The violent power from her attack was wreaking havoc inside his body.

He thought that the true essence power that Li Qingyan was exuding was just an illusion, but it was real!

It was also due to his carelessness that he did not use the protective jade slip on his body. That was why he was severely injured by Li Qingyan’s one move, and was even on the verge of death.

How… How was this possible? This woman had really stepped into the true essence realm.

What exactly happened? How did her cultivation increase so much within the span of a few days.

Although Chen Ping was unable to determine Li Qingyan’s exact cultivation level, the true essence power in her body could not be faked.

“Son, father is here!”

“Quickly! Take this healing pill and stabilize your mind. I will start healing you now!” Chen Junhao said anxiously.

His hands trembled, and his eyes were filled with worry.

Chen Ping’s current situation was extremely precarious. He had one foot into the Netherworld. If things were not handled properly, it was very likely that he would never recover from this.
