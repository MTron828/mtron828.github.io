763 Resurrection?

In order to break through to the sealed immortal realm, the Great Demoness Mengyu not only wanted to make the Heaven-Devouring Divine Sparrow her scapegoat, but also wanted to sacrifice the inhabitants of the entire East continent to strengthen herself. She was completely evil.

It was only thanks to the Great Wilderness Divine sect’s sacrifice that the peace and stability of the East continent were maintained.

The fault did not lie with Daoist Yi Feng. Even if he had not met or been deceived by Mengyu, this Great Demoness would definitely have found other ways of achieving her goal.

However, what puzzled Ye Xuan was why Mengyu cared so much about the immortal bones, to the point that she spent such a long time earning Daoist Yi Feng’s affection and trust.

Daoist Yi Feng seemed to have guessed what Ye Xuan was thinking and said, “Mengyu is from the demon race, and she is a direct descendant with a pure bloodline.”

“Although demons are talented, they are not recognized by the laws of the world, and thus will never be able to break through to the sealed immortal realm.”

“Given her ambitions, how could she simply succumb to her fate?”

“Therefore, she studied countless ancient records and finally discovered a method that would allow her to possess another body and be reborn.”

Ye Xuan was dumbfounded. It took him a while to gather his thoughts.

Daoist Yi Feng continued, “The possession and rebirth that I’m talking about requires the use of someone else’s body to rid her of the restrictions of the demon bloodline.”

“Only then would she gain the recognition of the laws of the world and be able to break through to the sealed immortal realm.”

Ye Xuan was puzzled and asked, “If that’s the case, she could easily obtain anyone’s body. Why did it have to be you?”

Daoist Yi Feng smiled. This question had puzzled him for a very long time, and he only understood it recently.

“That isn’t a difficult question to answer. Mengyu has always been very proud. She definitely wouldn’t allow herself to possess a mortal body, as she felt that doing so would dirty her body and soul.”

“Coincidentally, she met me by chance…”

When he said this, Daoist Yi Feng felt even more desolate. He had thought that he had met his fated person, but it was all a sham.

“The immortal bones in my body can help her rebuild a new body and get rid of the restrictions of her bloodline.”

“Not only that, these immortal bones are a gift from the heavens, and thus can resonate with the laws of the world. As such, it will naturally be easier for her to reach the sealed immortal realm. This was why I was the target.”

Ye Xuan nodded in understanding.

However, the only remaining thing that puzzled him was why Mengyu was still alive after Daoist Yi Feng self-destructed the immortal bones in her body.

The more he thought about it, the stranger he felt. Thus, he asked, “Martial Uncle Yi, you self-destructed your immortal bones at that time, yet why is Mengyu still alive and well now? What happened?”

Hearing this, Daoist Yi Feng’s face was filled with bitterness.

“Actually, I’ve only recently figured out that the power of the immortal bones is too great. As long as a fragment of the body of the owner of the immortal bones remains, it can still regrow.”

“This might also be related to the fact that she is a member of the demon race. Demons possess powerful recovery abilities. After I self-destructed the immortal bones, they probably regrew themselves and helped her come back to life.”

“At that time, I didn’t know about this at all. Therefore, after killing her, I didn’t go back to the desert region to investigate.”

“It was not until decades after the battle when I realized that another set of immortal bones had regrown in my body. From then on, I had already guessed that Mengyu was very likely still alive.”

“My guess turned out to be correct, and now she’s here for revenge.”

After saying this, his face was clouded by guilt. Not only had his actions caused the deaths of so many fellow sect members, but he had failed to kill Mengyu in the end.

How could he face his ancestors now?

Taking a deep breath, Daoist Yi Feng’s forehead seemed to gain a few more wrinkles. He looked extremely tired.

If Mengyu was only an ancient realm expert, he might have been able to kill her personally and avenge his compatriots.

However, Mengyu might have already become a sealed immortal realm expert. Even if he broke through to the ancient realm now, it would be useless.

After hearing these words, Ye Xuan could not help but ponder, “Resurrection?”

“Yes, if she still has the immortal bones in her body, then even if you kill her, she can still come back to life. This is the most terrifying effect of the immortal bones,” Daoist Yi Feng said with a serious expression.

Ye Xuan frowned. He did not know what to do.

If he could not destroy the immortal bones in Mengyu’s body, then she would never truly die, and would return eventually to haunt him and the sect.

Furthermore, if she really was a sealed immortal realm, then the strength gap between them meant that he probably only had one chance to kill her.

If she could resurrect herself…

Given this situation, the Great Wilderness Divine sect might really be in trouble.

Thinking this, Ye Xuan fell silent. Tian Xuan had told him to protect Cloud Sky peak and the sect before his death, but it now seemed that he did not have the ability to do so.
