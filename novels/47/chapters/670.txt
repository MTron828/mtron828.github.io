671 Activating Berserk Mode (Part 2)

“Endless Lightning technique, Myriad Lightning Seals the Universe!”

With a furious roar, streaks of purple lightning struck the illusory phantom of the ferocious beast phantom that had just condensed again repeatedly, shattering it into pieces.

Li Hong’s face instantly turned pale, and he spat out a mouthful of blood. It was obvious that he had suffered a serious injury.

“This can’t be happening…”

!!

It was only one attack, yet he had already suffered such a heavy injury.

He turned around and realized that everyone around him had frightened expressions.

Xiang Yun, who had gone berserk, was attacking indiscriminately with bloodshot eyes. No matter who it was, as long as she saw them, they would experience her wrath.

Even those who hid far away and wanted to watch a good show were also blessed by a few lightning bolts.

“Why are you attacking us too…”

“We’ve never offended you.”

Within a short period of time, these people’s hair had been singed by lightning, and their clothes had been burnt black. They hurriedly fled to avoid

After seeing this scene, Feng Xiyun almost laughed out loud. Her body trembled as she forced herself to stay motionless on the ground.

‘Third Sister is really too easily deceived. Hee hee…’

She felt a little guilty, but felt that it was necessary for them to deal with this situation.

At this moment, Li Hong was on the receiving end of a hammer strike.

Boom!

Li Hong was instantly smashed into the ground, creating a huge pit.

Feeling pain all over his body, Li Hong was still in a state of disbelief.

“This can’t be true. I can’t lose so easily. ”

He stood up shakily, then took out a pill and consumed it, allowing his body to completely recover.

“Martial Uncle Li, if there’s no other way, let’s retreat first. It won’t be too late to deal with her later.”

Liu Yun was scared out of his wits. He was afraid that if he did not escape quickly, his life would be in serious danger.

If they were killed in this space, they would not really die. However, who knew if there would be other side effects?

“Get lost!”

Li Hong immediately chased Liu Yun away. He had always believed himself to be invincible. There was no way that he would be defeated by this little girl.

If he lost to Feng Xiyun, he might be able to accept it.

However, what he could not accept was losing to a six-year-old girl!

“You’re all cowards. Are you even worthy of being called disciples of the Supreme Divine sect?”

“All of the cowards should just get lost. Those with guts should follow me and beat this little girl up!”

“I don’t believe that a single little girl can defeat all of us,” Li Hong said fiercely.

Then, he took out his black long saber and erupted with an extremely terrifying aura.

The ferocious beast phantom condensed above his head again, and this one seemed to be much stronger than the previous one.

Moments later, he soared into the sky and then swung his saber at Xiang Yun. The beast phantom above his head opened its mouth wide, trying to swallow her whole.

Xiang Yun was not flustered at all, and swung her hammer upwards to meet the descending saber slash. Even faced with the ferocious beast phantom that was hundreds of times larger than her body, Xiang Yun did not exhibit any fear and attacked without hesitation.

Then, her hammer suddenly enlarged and smashed into Li Hong and the phantom, causing even space to tremble.

“F*ck!”

“That’s terrifying! If it was me, I would have been turned into meat paste by that strike!”

“Is this little girl really human?”

The onlookers were frightened by this scene, and were wondering if she was even of the same species as they were. Was she a monster disguised as a human?

Accompanied by a loud bang, the ferocious beast phantom in the sky shattered once again, and Li Hong was smashed into the ground, creating another huge pit.

It seemed like there was no hope of victory at all.

“Martial Uncle Li!” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

When he saw Li Hong in that state, Liu Yun became anxious and shouted in exasperation, “It’s now or never. Attack or we’ll be done for!”

As soon as he finished speaking, dozens of the Supreme Divine sect charged at the same time, trying to swarm and drown Xiang Yun with numbers.

However, before they could even get close, bolts of lightning struck them mercilessly. Xiang Yun had turned into a god of death. She was furious that her second sister had been severely injured.

“I’m going to smash all of you into meat patties!”

She did not want her second sister to sleep forever like her family, and swung her potato hammer repeatedly at the Supreme Divine sect’s disciples, sending them flying each time.

Within a short moment, she had dealt with all of them, and they had all been eliminated from the gathering. They had not even managed to start climbing the mountain, much less vie for the rankings.

“No way, I will never admit defeat!”

Li Hong could not believe what he was seeing, and wanted to flee so that he could retain his chance at continuing to participate in the gathering.

However, Xiang Yun would never allow it. After all, he was the one who had injured her senior sister…
