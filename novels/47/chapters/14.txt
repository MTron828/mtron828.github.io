Chapter 15: You Are Quite Arrogant!

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Duan Wujie was too powerful. He had caught up with them so quickly.

He was a genius cultivation practitioner in the seventh stage of the true essence state. Even if they chose to use their master’s trump card, it would be difficult for them to escape.

After all, how could the genius cultivation practitioners of the Xuanyin sect not have their own trump cards?

Most importantly, Huang Ling was only at the fifth stage of the true essence state, and Xue Ming was only at the fourth stage, so how could they possibly stop this other party?

It seemed like this was a dead end, no matter how one looked at it.

“Don’t you guys like to run? Go on, then, run!”

Duan Wujie moved his body and suddenly appeared on top of a big tree, looking at the two people below with a mocking gaze.

It was at this moment that the two other cultivation practitioners of the Xuanyin sect came over after finishing off the adventure team. Then, the three of them formed a pincer attack and surrounded Huang Ling and Xue Min!

“Duan Wujie, you’re a seventh stage true essence state practitioner bullying a fifth stager and fourth stager. What kind of man are you?!”

Huang Ling looked at Duan Wujie coldly.

She and Xue Min had obtained this Dark Glacial Frost by chance. Duan Wujie and the fierce adventurer team had discovered that they were in possession of it.

What made them feel helpless was that both sides had discovered the existence of the Dark Glacial Frost. It was a rare treasure that could increase a cultivator’s innate bone value. How could they miss out on such a thing?

......

After all, this was a treasure that even cultivation practitioners in the core formation state coveted.

It was precisely because of this that the previous scene had taken place.

Whether it was the cultivation practitioners of the Xuanyin sect led by Duan Wujie or the ferocious adventurer team, they all coveted the Dark Glacial Frost in their hands.

Of course, with Duan Wujie’s strength, there was no need for him to negotiate with Huang Ling and Xue Min.

He had only proposed such a condition to show off in front of them. However, Xue Min and Xue Min had repeatedly rejected Duan Wujie’s condition, so he of course would not be kind to them.

“Hehe, treasures belong to the capable. Do you think your strength is worthy of owning this Dark Glacial Frost?” Duan Wujie could not help but sneer when he saw this.

“As long as you hand over the Dark Glacial Frost, I can spare your lives on account of the fact that we’re both part of top-tier sects of the great Qian Dynasty!

“After all, I don’t really like fighting... Don’t force my hand!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Duan Wujie’s eyes landed on Huang Ling and Xue Min wantonly. A lewd look flashed across his eyes.

“Duan Wujie, if you choose to attack us, you’ll be making an enemy of our Qingyun sect. Do you think you can bear such consequences?”

Huang Ling could not help but ask the question with a cold expression in her eyes.

At the same time, her heart was filled with despair. If the other party attacked, she and her junior sister would die today.

“Making an enemy? Hehe, our Xuanyin sect is ranked second among the top sects. Your Qingyun sect is only ranked tenth. What can you do if you offend us?

“Besides, as long as I kill all the people who were here today, who will know that you died by my hand? Even if the Qingyun sect really hears about this, do you think they’d dare to become enemies with the Xuanyin sect?”

Duan Wujie could not help but put on a mocking expression when he heard this.

With the strength of the Xuanyin sect, he was indeed justified in being cocky.

“Forget a mere personal disciple of the Qingyun sect. Even if your elders came here, they wouldn’t dare to make an enemy of my sect!”

Duan Wujie spoke arrogantly, his eyes full of disdain.

“Oh? It seems like you’re quite confident about that!”

It was at this moment that a faint voice suddenly rang out.

“Who is that?”

Hearing this, Duan Wujie’s pupils constricted abruptly, and the spiritual awareness in his body swept out of him, searching for the source of the voice everywhere.

At the same time, the expressions of the two cultivation practitioners of the Xuanyin sect, as well as Huang Ling and Xue Min’s expressions, also changed.

They knew very well that a truly powerful cultivation practitioner had appeared.

Though the voice was faint, it seemed to ring out in all directions at the same time, filling the entire area.

Duan Wujie carefully searched the surrounding space but could not find any traces of a cultivator.

At this moment, Duan Wujie seemed to recall something as his gaze suddenly landed on one point within the empty space.

A fiery-red figure suddenly appeared. It was a firebird!

Accompanied by the crack of the sound barrier breaking, the firebird showed up in an instant.

At the same time, Duan Wujie noticed the two figures behind the firebird.

They were a young man with a peerless face and temperament, and a young woman with a delicate and graceful figure.

Although he did not know that woman, they were extremely familiar with the man.

This guy was the fifth elder of Qingyun sect, Ye Xuan!

Although the Qingyun sect was only ranked tenth in the great Qian Dynasty, Ye Xuan’s reputation was nothing to be scoffed at.

As the youngest elder of the Qingyun sect, he was also known as the greatest genius of the Qingyun sect in the past five hundred years. He had broken through to the middle stage of the empty core stage at the age of twenty.

Even within the Xuanyin sect, there were many elders who thought highly of Ye Xuan. They thought that it was very likely that he would break through to the true core stage before the age of twenty-six, and even reach the golden core stage before the age of forty-six. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

It should be known that in the great Qian Dynasty, cultivators in the golden core state represented absolute power.

Even Duan Wujie, who thought that his talent was not bad, had only broken through to the seventh stage of the true essence state at the age of 18.

Although he was confident that he could reach the purple spirit state before the age of 20, he could not guarantee that he could reach the core formation state before 30.

This was a huge barrier for cultivators. The higher one’s state, the more difficult it would be to break through.

Many cultivators had already broken through to the tenth stage of the purple spirit state by the age of 30, but most cultivators had to spend decades before they could then enter the core formation state.

There were many cultivators who tried their entire lives, unable to break through the purple spirit stage.

This proved Ye Xuan’s talent.

How could Duan Wujie not have heard of him? He was now looking at this legend.

After seeing Ye Xuan appear, Duan Wujie’s expression grew extremely unsightly, and his body could not help but tremble. He could not help but feel a sense of fear in his heart.

At this moment, he only had one thought in his mind, and that was to quickly run away. That Dark Glacial Frost was nothing. Right now, saving his life was the most important thing he could do.
