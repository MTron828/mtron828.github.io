Chapter 51: Master’s Spiritual Power Infusion

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

As the saying goes, when a teacher takes a disciple in, that the disciple’s cultivation would still depend on themselves.

She had just become a disciple, and yet had received such precious gifts. She was filled with disbelief.

As everyone knew, even if the relationship between teacher and disciple was good, most teachers would only give guidance to their disciples in their spare time. The disciples would only receive treasures that the teacher no longer wanted or needed.

However, Ye Xuan had given her extremely rare and precious treasures. His generosity exceeded Li Qingyan’s imagination! Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Li Qingyan hurriedly closed her eyes. In the end, she shook her head around and around, and tried to pinch herself.

“What are you doing?”

Seeing this, Ye Xuan did not know how to react. Then, he gently flicked Li Qingyan’s forehead.

“Girl, do you think you are dreaming? I told you earlier…”

“I rarely accept disciples, but if you become my disciple, you will definitely not be treated unfairly!”

“Teacher, I…”

Hearing this, Li Qingyan felt very touched.

To be able to become Ye Xuan’s disciple was really her great fortune.

Li Qingyan touched her forehead that had been flicked by Ye Xuan, and a brilliant smile appeared on her face.

......

“The Mountain Chalcedony can strengthen a cultivator’s innate bone value. Innate bone value refers to a cultivator’s…”

Then, Ye Xuan explained the meaning of innate bone value to Li Qingyan.

This was because he discovered that many cultivators often confused their innate talent and innate bone value. Strictly speaking, innate bone value was only a part of their innate talent!

A cultivator’s innate talent was divided into innate bone value and comprehension value.

After Ye Xuan’s explanation, Li Qingyan revealed a glint of understanding. She also came to understand that her comprehension value was actually the highest her teacher had ever seen, and even higher than senior sister Yue’s.

Of course, there was still a big gap between her comprehension value and her teacher’s.

However, although her comprehension value was very high, Yue’s innate bone value far surpassed her own.

However, all of this was not a problem. After all, Li Qingyan had a dual-spirit physique. As long as she awakened her special physique, her innate bone value would naturally be greatly strengthened.

Ye Xuan then gave her a 50-cubic meter storage ring. He then received a randomized 3x critical reward, and obtained a 155-cubic meter storage ring.

“Your comprehension value is indeed not low, but you can’t slack off because of this. You still need to persevere and work hard on the path of cultivation. Don’t let me down!” Ye Xuan said.

“I understand!” Li Qingyan nodded very seriously.

In fact, even without Ye Xuan’s reminder, Li Qingyan would not slack off in her cultivation. After all, her experience with the Li family’s predicament had taught her that only strength mattered in this world.

The Li family’s martial techniques were basically all yellow-rank, and Li Qingyan had mastered them. Now that she had gotten her hands on high-grade martial techniques, she naturally would not slack off.

“After practicing the martial techniques that I got from my teacher, my cultivation speed will definitely be much faster. I might be able to advance to the true essence realm by next year!”

Thinking this, Li Qingyan could not help but reveal an excited expression.

Although her comprehension value was not low, due to the restriction of the quality of the cultivation method she was practicing, she had only reached the seventh level of the qi transformation realm.

Reaching such a realm at the age of sixteen could only be considered average in the Great Qian Dynasty. However, in such a remote place like Jiangqing City, she was already a rare genius cultivator.

Currently, most of the cultivators in the city her age were only at the second or third level of the qi transformation realm. Moreover, there were many cultivators who were stuck in the body refinement realm.

However, compared to the cultivators in the entire Great Qian Dynasty, Li Qingyan’s achievements were relatively mediocre.

The population of the Great Qian Dynasty was 1.7 billion, and Li Qingyan’s talent could only be ranked in the middle or upper range. She was a long way from the top.

Only genius cultivators like Huang Ling and Xue Min could be considered as geniuses among the young cultivators. The two girls were only one year older than Li Qingyan, but their cultivation levels had reached the fourth and fifth level of the true essence realm respectively.

This was the true strength of a top sect’s personal disciple.

Of course, thanks to the existence of a monster like Ye Xuan, Huang Ling and Xue Min’s radiance was overshadowed.

As for Yue, her achievements were due to Ye Xuan’s spiritual power infusion and her awakening of the sword jade physique, which caused her cultivation to advance by leaps and bounds before finally reaching the fifth level of the true essence realm.

In addition, Yue’s comprehension value was not low. She learned quickly in combat, and could quickly adapt what she learned and apply it to increase her own strength.

It was precisely because of this that Yue was able to compete with Huang Ling and Xue Min.

If Huang Ling and Xue Min were placed among the cultivators of the younger generation of the Great Qian Dynasty, they would already be considered as geniuses with top-tier talent.

However, there was nothing they could do. The two of them had encountered Ye Xuan, who was a cheater. Aided by the system, the disciples that he had taught were naturally extremely talented.

“The most urgent thing for me to do now is comprehend the Sword Spirit technique. Given my current comprehension value, it shouldn’t take too much time. After I enter the true essence realm, I can try cultivating the Thunder Sword Control technique!”

“Yes, the path of cultivation shouldn’t be rushed. I have to take every step carefully and completely master the Sword Spirit technique first. I can’t disappoint Teacher’s expectations!”

“I’ll strive to advance to the true essence realm before next year!”

Soon, Li Qingyan secretly made up her mind.

However, what Ye Xuan said next immediately stunned Li Qingyan. Her mouth opened so wide that it was large enough to swallow an egg.

“These are the heavenly treasures I have given you for now. There will be more later. Sit down and regulate your breathing. I’m going to irrigate your spiritual power!” Ye Xuan said.

“What? Spiritual power… spiritual power infusion?”

Hearing this, Li Qingyan widened her eyes. Her expression was full of shock; it was the same as Yue’s back then.

Although Jiangqing City was located in a remote place, she also knew what spiritual power infusion was!

This was the same level of kindness as parental love. Even her father, who loved her very much, had never thought about spiritual power infusion!

After all, this was a matter of self-interest, and it was very exhausting. Normally only those on their deathbeds would make such a choice to strengthen their juniors

“Teacher, you…”

Li Qingyan’s eyes were full of shock. She was afraid that she had misheard him.

“Don’t doubt it. Spiritual power infusion is the fastest way to help you break through!” Ye Xuan said.

Ye Xuan understood the change in Li Qingyan’s expression.

Honestly, if he did not have the system, he would not do such a stupid thing.

Luckily, in his case, spiritual power infusion would not only help his disciple break through, but he would also get the corresponding system reward.

In this way, not only would he be able to break through himself, but he would also receive the gratitude of his disciple. This feeling was simply too good.

“Teacher, I…”

When Li Qingyan heard this, her nose started sniffling, and her pupils turned red.

At this moment, the emotions in her heart were the same as Yue back then. She felt immense gratitude toward Ye Xuan.
