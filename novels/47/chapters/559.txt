560 Gao Shun’s Death

Zhuge Yueyue held the imperial sword tightly and rushed into a group of Immortal Divine sect disciples to kill them.

Her originally white and flawless dress was now stained with blood, and the situation between the two sects entered a stalemate.

However, if Gao Shun could not beat Elder Taiyin, this delicate balance would soon be over, and the Great Wilderness Divine sect would fall into danger again.

At this moment, seeing that none of the disciples of the Great Wilderness Divine sect were holding back, Gao Shun also laughed out loud. His laughter was tinged with sorrow.

“Elder Taiyin, even if I can’t survive today’s battle, I won’t let you off easily either.”

The moment he finished speaking, Gao Shun brandished his weapon.

Seeing this, Elder Taiyin’s brows became tightly furrowed. He did not know what kind of trick Gao Shun was trying to pull.

All of a sudden, Gao Shun swung his saber vigorously, unleashing powerful saber beams that left open wounds on Elder Taiyin’s body.

Then, he quickly followed up with a vicious slash, cutting off Elder Taiyin’s left hand.

At this moment, Elder Taiyin could no longer suppress his anger. He had not expected Gao Shun to be able to harm him.

“Damn it! I’m going to torture you to death!”

He shouted as he grew back his left hand. After that, he teleported in front of Gao Shun, and kicked him to the ground.

Gao Shun did not stay idle, and tried his best to resist. However, the strength gap was too large, and his efforts were in vain.

Elder Taiyin did not even use his weapon, and simply stabbed his hand into Gao Shun’s abdomen brutally.

Enduring the severe pain, Gao Shun continuously swung his saber at Elder Taiyin, leaving behind several wounds so deep that even the bones could be seen.

However, this only served to anger Elder Taiyin further, who ignored his attacks and continuously stabbed his hand into Gao Shun’s body.

Despite seeing Gao Shun on the verge of death, Elder Taiyin was still not satisfied. He raised his hand again and ruthlessly stabbed it into Gao Shun’s heart.

At this moment, Gao Shun’s eyes gradually lost their light, and his vitality began to fade.

Sensing this, the cultivators of the Great Wilderness Divine sect all stared at him in anguish.

“Senior Brother Gao!”

“Martial Uncle Gao!”

Voices rang out one after another, and Yuelun’s face was already tear-streaked.

Chief Gao Shun, who had always been proud and arrogant, had actually sacrificed himself for them…

The disciples of the Great Wilderness Divine church were all crying as they sensed his life force dissipating bit by bit…

“Father!”

Gao Tianyu desperately forced the enemy in front of him to retreat. He felt a deep sense of powerlessness when he saw his father fall in front of him.

Moments later, he raised his broadsword and wanted to charge at Elder Taiyin, but he was stopped by Li Dahai.

Gao Shun’s chances of survival were slim to none. He could not allow Gao Shun’s son to lose his life in vain.

“Hehe… Which one of you wants to try and stop me next? Come on!”

After cruelly dealing Gao Shun the fatal blow, Elder Taiyin laughed out loud.

His mind had already been corroded by that strange power, turning him into an evil and vicious person.

Without Gao Shun around to stop him, none of them would be able to restrain him.

At this moment, Elder Taiyin redirected his gaze toward Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun…

Sensing this intense killing intent, Zhuge Yueyue’s face instantly turned pale.

She knew very well that she would probably die at the hands of Elder Taiyin.

Even so, she was still determined and courageous, and kept attacking the cultivators of the Immortal Divine sect. She wanted to drag as many of them with her to the grave.

She really did not expect that Martial Uncle Gao, who had always made things difficult for them in the past, would actually sacrifice himself heroically in order to save them.

Since she could not repay this life-saving grace, she decided that it was best to go out with a bang!

“Xiyun, are you scared?”

Zhuge Yueyue looked at Feng Xiyun calmly and asked. Feng Xiyun also replied calmly, “I have Sister Yue by my side, so what is there to fear?”

Hearing this, Zhuge YueYue’s smile was extremely bright. The two of them walked out of the crowd of disciples hand-in-hand.

Zhuge Yueyue was well aware of Elder Taiyin’s intentions to kill them.

In any case, now that things had already come to this, there was no need to continue running away. It was better to step up and draw attention away from the other disciples.

Since Martial Uncle Gao had sacrificed his life to save the disciples, this was the best way to honor his death.

Yuelun was extremely anxious when he saw Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun walking out openly. However, she had her hands tied with Mo Xuan Guan and the other elders of the Immortal Divine sect, so there was nothing she could do.

When Elder Taiyin saw the two of them take the initiative to step forward, he spoke cruelly, “Hahaha! That’s good, you’ve saved me the trouble of hunting you down.”

“Cloud Sky peak has always been a thorn in my side, so it’s time for some payback. I’ll start with you two!”

Zhuge Yueyue would not admit defeat. She said firmly, “Enough of your nonsense! If you’ve got something to say, then use your fists to speak!”

“Arrogant!”

Elder Taiyin was burning with anger. He launched an attack without hesitation, wanting to kill Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

How could the two girls possibly block a full-powered attack from a supreme realm expert?

At this moment, the outcome seemed to be set in stone. These two peerless geniuses were probably going to die here.

At the critical moment, a sharp sword beam struck and forced Elder Taiyin to retreat.

“Which person dared to spoil my plans?”

...

While the crowd was still in shock, an old man in a white robe emerged from the sky.

After seeing this old man, Yuelun and the others revealed expressions of surprise and joy. They shouted in shock, “Martial Uncle Yi Feng!”

The one who had rushed over to save Zhuge Yueyue and the others was the previous grand elder of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, Yi Feng, who was from the same generation as Chief Tian Xuan.
