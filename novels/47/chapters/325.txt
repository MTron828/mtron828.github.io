326 The Fire Dragon King

It was rumored that the dragons of the endless sea were the descendants of the true dragons from the upper realm that had descended upon the Tianyuan continent countless years ago.

However, in the current endless sea, no sea race dared to mention this.

As time passed, the pseudo-dragon race became known as the true dragon race of the endless sea.

Of course, this was only among the sea race. The human race continued to deride them as pseudo dragons.

!!

The reason why the sea race was attacking the human race was also at the behest of the true dragon race!

“Unfortunately, the human race’s territory is now filled with formations set up by Saint King realm experts.”

“Only our King realm experts have a chance at breaking those formations.”

“Don’t be anxious. Everything is within Lord Fire Dragon King’s expectations,” the enormous demonic whale said slowly.

“That’s right! Lord Fire Dragon King has already given instructions to ignore the remaining territories in the Tianze Zone and to focus on attacking other zones.”

“We must occupy as much of the human race’s territory at all costs and fulfill Lord Fire Dragon King’s orders!”

“There’s no need to dwell on this matter. All we have to do is follow the Lord Fire Dragon King’s instructions to the letter,” the merman said indifferently.

They were all middle-stage Saint King realm experts, and the Fire Dragon King they were talking about was an advanced-stage Saint King realm expert.

“Also, that human named Ye Xuan has attracted Lord Fire Dragon King’s attention. We have to keep a close eye on him,” the flood dragon said.

“His identity is extremely mysterious. It seems that even the humans in the Huangyu Zone are unaware of his true identity,” the Yaksha said in a deep voice.

“His identity is not important. As long as he doesn’t break the unspoken rules between our two races, it will be fine.”

“If our sea race’s invasion is obstructed by Ye Xuan again, it will definitely result in Lord Fire Dragon King’s ire. At that time, us Saint King realm experts will likely be called upon to initiate a final showdown with the human race’s experts!”

The demonic whale’s eyes flickered with terrifying red light as it spoke in a deep voice.

“In order to prevent this guy from causing trouble, we’ll send two more Heavenly King realm experts from each race to hunt him down,” the merman said after some thought.

“Sure!”

The representatives of the other three races all agreed.

After that, the four terrifying auras that filled the stormy sea area slowly disappeared.

Soon, the sea race dispatched eight Heavenly King realm experts to search for Ye Xuan.

After the human experts noticed the movements of the sea race, they immediately became vigilant.

Although the sea race said that those eight experts were only here to find Ye Xuan, no one could ignore the terrifying combat strength that they represented.

Helplessly, the master of the Divine Gate Holy Land and the others hurriedly asked for help from the human experts from other zones. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

There were a total of 198 zones in the Southern Territory, so there was no shortage of places to seek help from.

Knowing that sea race Heavenly King realm experts were on the move, these human experts would not simply stand by and watch. Soon, they too sent out eight Heavenly King realm experts to monitor those eight experts from the sea race.

Not only that, when these Heavenly King realm experts arrived, they also brought along a group of pattern condensation realm cultivators. This changed the landscape of the battle between the two races.

The sea race’s invasion was severely hindered, and they were even forced to retreat in some places, allowing the human race to recapture some of the territories that they had lost.

This infuriated the sea race, as well as the Fire Dragon King, who immediately made an appearance in the stormy sea area.

“Sea race, do you want to start a war between our great emperor experts?”

At the same time, a pair of huge golden divine eyes suddenly opened up in the sky. It stared at the Fire Dragon King expressionlessly.

The Fire Dragon King’s arrogant aura instantly disappeared, and his expression turned ugly.

Although Ye Xuan’s appearance had shifted the balance of the war, it was not to the extent where the two races’ great emperor experts had to get involved.

Heck, it did not even warrant the involvement of an advanced-stage Saint King realm expert like the Fire Dragon King.

However, the Fire Dragon King had a bad temper and naturally could not take this lying down.

“Hmph! No I don’t!”

“However, Ye Xuan has publicly broken the unspoken rules between our two races. He must die!”

“If you humans dare to protect Ye Xuan, I don’t mind starting a war between our great emperor realm experts!”

The Fire Dragon King uttered that threat before leaving in a huff together with the Heavenly King realm experts who were sent to look for Ye Xuan.

“Hmph! These sea race cultivators are truly arrogant!”

“He’s just a pseudo dragon. Does he really fancy himself to be a true dragon from the ancient era?”

The human advanced-stage Saint King realm expert sneered.

A battle between our great emperor realm experts? Did he really think the human race was afraid of such an outcome?

The ancient era of the Tianyuan continent had long since passed. Did he think that the human race was still as weak as they were back then?

After the Fire Dragon King disappeared, the pair of golden divine eyes in the sky also dissipated.
