842 A Great Battle (Part 2)

“Stop! I don’t wanna die!”

“Nooooooo!”

No one watching had expected that the golden-furred growler ancestor would be so crazy. In his rage, he wanted to bury everyone present with his descendant.

The terrifying devouring power sucked countless unwilling people and creatures toward his mouth. It seemed that he had finally found a breakthrough point in this battle.

As for Ye Xuan, a smirk appeared on his face when he saw the other party’s mouth wide open. A few needles appeared in Ye Xuan’s hand.

“It’s actually the Seven Terminal Needles!”

Far away, Yanran exclaimed in surprise. These were the needles that Ye Xuan had obtained after giving Yanran the Torrential Pear Blossom Needles.

As the Torrential Pear Blossom Needles were the first gift Ye Xuan had given her, she cherished them, and was unwilling to use them in battle, afraid that she would break them.

What did Ye Xuan want to do this time?

Moments later, Ye Xuan used the Boundless Palm technique and fused the Seven Terminal Needles together.

With a roar, the strengthened version of the Seven Terminal Needles was flung out, aimed straight at the mouth of the golden-furred growler ancestor.

Seeing Ye Xuan’s actions, the golden-furred growler ancestor was dumbfounded. What was this guy trying to pull?

Did he really think those tiny needles would hurt him?

Pfft! What a joke!

Then, when the needles entered his mouth, he did not feel anything.

“I’m gonna die of laughter. Is that all you’re capable of?”

“Some party tricks?”

Even Ye Xuan’s Godsword had only managed to cause him some superficial injuries, much less these tiny needles.

As he laughed, the golden-furred growler ancestor shouted again, “Today, all of you will die! I’ll suck everyone into my stomach!”

In his anger, the entire world trembled, and more and more people were pulled into his mouth.

“Damn it! Set up the formation!” Ao Lei roared.

Faced with such a terrifying enemy, only by uniting could they resist this attack.

At this moment, everyone was burning with anxiety. They all looked at Ye Xuan. He was the only one who could possibly do anything about this situation.

This made the golden-furred growler ancestor feel a chill run down his spine. He could not understand why Ye Xuan was smiling so happily.

Unable to figure it out, he asked, “What’s so funny? Have you turned silly at the prospect of death?”

Just as he said this, he instantly felt an extremely intense pain in his stomach, and his expression changed drastically.

The smile on Ye Xuan’s face grew wider as he said, “Explode!”

In an instant, a terrifying amount of energy erupted within the golden-furred growler ancestor’s body, causing it to distort and expand.

At the same time, many of those who were being sucked toward the golden-furred growler ancestor’s mouth were sent flying back in the opposite direction instead.

“What happened?”

When they looked back, they realized that the golden-furred growler ancestor’s stomach had exploded, and his internal organs were scattered all over the ground. The scene was quite grisly and terrifying.

“No, I can’t die! This cannot be happening!”

He lowered his head and looked at his stomach. He could not believe what had just happened. No matter what, he was an immortal from the Heavenly Dao World!

“Hehe, are you shocked?”

Ye Xuan laughed heartily. With a casual wave of his hand, he retrieved his needles, and fiddled around with them for a while.

“Everything has a weakness. Your fur might be strong, but your internal organs definitely are not.”

“Furthermore, your innate divine power is actually a devouring spell. Once you use it, it’s equivalent to exposing your weakness to me.”

Hearing this, the golden-furred growler ancestor instantly came to a realization.

“That’s not true…”

“As honorable ancient divine beasts, how can we have any weaknesses?!”

However, this matter was no longer important.

After all, his life force was also slipping away rapidly. Ye Xuan did not waste any time, and drew the Godsword and charged at him.

“What’s the use of arguing with me about this now? Your life is about to end by my hands.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he swung the Godsword and unleashed the World Slash.

Boom!

The blood-red sword beam mercilessly pierced the golden-furred growler ancestor’s abdomen.

Puchi!

In an instant, before the golden-furred growler ancestor could react, his body had been split into two!
