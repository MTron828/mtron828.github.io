382 The Consequences Of Acting Tough Are Very Serious

Su Changhe frowned when he heard the words “get lost”. His expression immediately turned gloomy.

He had toyed with so many women, and had never seen anyone who dared to be so impolite to him.

Su Changhe did not know why, but a strange feeling emerged in his heart. He seemed to enjoy being rejected.

Only by subduing this kind of prey could he feel a great sense of accomplishment.

“You little b*tch, do you know the identity of the person in front of you? My young master is a disciple of the Yangli divine empire. Are you seeking death?”

Although Su Changhe did not care about it, his lackey beside him did not want to let it go. He rolled up his sleeves fiercely and was about to slap Zhuge Yueyue.

“Stop!” When Su Changhe saw this, he stopped the lackey.

This beauty’s appearance was so extraordinary. If he accidentally disfigured her, it would not be fun to conquer her later.

“This is the beauty that I have taken a fancy to. If you guys accidentally hurt her, who will take responsibility?”

“Hehe! It’s all our fault, we almost ruined Young Master’s big plan,” the lackeys all quickly said with a smile. They were completely ignoring Ye Xuan, who was not far away.

From their perspective, no matter how Zhuge Yueyue struggled, she would still end up in their young master’s hands.

Hearing this, Zhuge Yueyue’s heart burned with anger.

However, when she recalled that Su Changhe had mentioned that he was from a powerful clan in the Yangli divine empire, she hesitated

‘No, I can’t bring trouble to my teacher’s doorstep over such a small matter.’

At the thought of this, Zhuge Yueyue could only suppress the anger in her heart.

At that moment, Ye Xuan looked at Su Changhe indifferently and asked,

“You are from the Su family of the Yangli divine empire?”

Su Changhe’s eyes darkened when he heard that.

It was only then that he noticed that there was a man beside Zhuge Yueyue. From his appearance, it seemed that even Zhuge Yueyue had to listen to this guy.

When he saw how obedient and obedient Zhuge Yueyue was to Ye Xuan, his gaze turned cold.

‘This is the little beauty that yours truly has taken a fancy to. Is she someone you can lay your hands on?’

Also, aside from his relatively young appearance, Ye Xuan looked pretty ordinary to Su Changhe.

As a descendant of the Su family of the Yangli divine empire, he had an impression of most of the geniuses of the empire and the various holy lands.

Since he did not recognize Ye Xuan, he probably was a nobody.

He would probably run away in fear after being threatened, right?

After all, the Su family was so powerful that not many could afford to offend them. Moreover, he had brought many powerful followers with him.

At the thought of this, Su Changhe’s expression became even more arrogant.

“Oh? Could it be that you also know of the Su family’s reputation?”

Ye Xuan pretended to think about it seriously, and then said equally seriously, “I’m sorry, I’ve never heard of them.”

Su Changhe’s face turned livid when he heard that.

‘Is this guy trying to anger me on purpose? Or is he truly disregarding the Su family?’

“Truly impudent!”

Su Changhe’s lackey was furious when he heard this. Powerful spiritual power fluctuations suddenly rippled out as he prepared to attack Ye Xuan.

However, Su Changhe stopped him again and looked at Ye Xuan deeply.

He was thinking.

‘Even though he knows that I’m a disciple of the Yangli divine empire and descendant of the Su family, he still dared to provoke me. Does he have some sort of backing?’

Although he was a hedonistic son of a rich family who indulged in wine and women, it did not mean that he was a fool.

In the Yangli divine empire, other than top holy lands and powerful clans, there were indeed quite a few powerful families and factions.

However, Su Changhe thought about it carefully and realized that he really had no impression of Ye Xuan.

“May I know your identity? Which top faction or clan do you come from? Let’s be friends.”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan smiled faintly.

“I’m just a commoner, how can I be compared to Young Master Su?”

Su Changhe squinted his eyes when he heard this. He had already made a decision in his heart.

“Since you’re just a commoner, do you know the consequences of acting tough in front of me?”

“You guys, go and break this guy’s legs. Just keep him alive! I’ll teach him the consequences of provoking me”

After Su Changhe finished speaking, two materialization realm experts beside him suddenly erupted with power and rushed toward Ye Xuan.

Su Changhe’s lips curled into a cold smile.

These guards were personally selected by his father. They were extremely powerful and had accompanied him whenever he did his shady business.

“Eh? Materialization realm?”

Ye Xuan’s mouth twitched when he saw this.

He had thought that such a pretentious idiot would have more powerful experts guarding him. It turned out to be mere materialization realm cultivators. What gave him the confidence to show off like this?

Ye Xuan did not move and just stood there with an indifferent expression.

Zhuge Yueyue was the same. She did not look flustered at all.

Although she could not sense the exact cultivation level of the two guards, the strength of their auras was not as strong as her teacher’s.

Thinking this, Zhuge Yueyue laughed inwardly.

This guy probably did not know that the person he had provoked was a powerful expert!

Two bright streaks of light flashed past. A long sword appeared in each of the two materialization realm guards’ hands. They released sharp sword qi that slashed toward Ye Xuan.

However, just as they were only three centimeters away from Ye Xuan, they suddenly stopped.

“What are you good-for-nothings doing? Hurry up and cripple him!”

Su Changhe realized that his guards had stopped moving and immediately shouted in anger.

At that moment, a destructive wave of energy suddenly swept out.

In an instant, the two materialization realm guards were sent flying.

Moments later, a sword qi that caused the world to lose its color suddenly flickered past, and Su Changhe’s two guards were instantly pierced thousands of times. They were as dead as could be.

The surroundings turned dead silent. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Su Changhe’s eyes widened in disbelief!

“A heaven realm expert!”

At that moment, an old man behind Su Changhe cried out in horror.

The moment Ye Xuan made his move, he had already sensed the terrifying power rippling from the other party’s body.
