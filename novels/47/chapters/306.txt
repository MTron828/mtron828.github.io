307 Silence Is Golden

“Black Flames Temple? Ah, so you’re a fish that slipped through the net.”

Shangguan Wan’er’s expression did not change at all.

“I say, little beauty, why don’t you come with me for a good time?”

Liu Chengtian’s gaze ravished Shangguan Wan’er’s body without restraint, and he opened his mouth to tease her.

However, Shangguan Wan’er could not be bothered to listen to his nonsense.

In the entire Tianyuan continent, apart from Ye Xuan, anyone who dared to be so presumptuous in front of her would be killed!

Buzzzzzz!

A beam of dazzling sword qi shot up into the sky and headed straight for Liu Chengtian.

“What?”

Liu Chengtian’s expression changed when he saw this. He could sense danger from this sword qi. He immediately clenched his right hand, and a saber appeared in his hand.

Sword and saber qi clashed like overlapping waves.

Boom!

The energy fluctuations from the impact created spatial cracks around them.

However, it was not over.

The sword qi tore through the saber qi and continued its advance toward Liu Chengtian. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Seeing this, Liu Chengtian’s expression changed. The spiritual power in his body gushed out and formed a tough earth-colored energy barrier.

This was a defensive energy barrier imbued with earth intent!

Buzzzzzz!

Moments later, countless cracks appeared on the energy barrier. Then, with a ripping sound, the sword qi cut Liu Chengtian’s body in two.

“Detestable!”

The next second, Liu Chengtian’s body reformed, but his expression had changed to one of shock.

The wounds caused by the sword qi seem to be having difficulty recovering, so he mobilized his spiritual power to extinguish the remnant sword qi in his body.

However, at this moment, Shangguan Wan’er attacked again. The sword qi seemed to contain immense destructive power as it slashed toward Liu Chengtian.

Her combat prowess had improved greatly ever since she acknowledged Ye Xuan as her teacher. Her spiritual sense, martial techniques, physical strength, and intent comprehension had all increased by leaps and bounds.

Liu Chengtian was indeed a monstrous genius, but that was only in comparison to ordinary cultivators.

In terms of talent, how could he compare to Shangguan Wan’er, who was the reincarnation of an ancient great empress?

“How is this possible?”

It was quadruple intent fusion!

Seeing this, Liu Chengtian’s expression changed from shock to fear.

This sword qi was infused with ice, metal, wind and sword intents!

He tried to flee.

However, Shangguan Wan’er had already anticipated this, and cut off all routes of escape. Unless he had engraved the profound pattern derived from wind or spatial intent, there was no way he could escape.

Buzzzzzz!

The sword qi sliced space apart and immediately materialized in front of Liu Chengtian.

This time, only his head remained intact.

He hurriedly stimulated the divine elements in his body to reform his body.

As a six-pattern condensation realm expert, his divine elements contained vast amounts of life force, so after a brief moment, his body became whole again. After that, he frantically tore space apart and fled without looking back.

However, how could Shangguan Wan’er let him escape?

She turned into a streak of light and disappeared into the spatial turbulence, chasing after Liu Chengtian.

Moments later, a sword qi filled with cold killing intent lit up the darkness of the spatial turbulence.

Liu Chengtian did not have time to dodge and could only grit his teeth and take the attack head-on with a saber strike.

His saber strike was a fusion of saber, vibration and ferocity intents. However, a triple intent fusion was no match for a quadruple intent fusion.

Boom!

The two destructive forces collided violently, tearing space apart.

Even though Liu Chengtian’s attack was devastatingly powerful in its own right, it was unable to withstand Shangguan Wan’er’s quadruple intent fusion.

“Shangguan Wan’er, stop! If you kill me, the entire Luo Heaven Palace will be buried with you!” Liu Chengtian roared.

Although he was not Shangguan Wan’er’s match, as a supreme genius of the Lightning Divine Palace, he naturally had trump cards.

However, these trump cards were too precious. Unless it was a matter of life and death, he was not willing to use them.

Unfortunately, Shangguan Wan’er completely ignored him as her longsword began to accumulate power again.

“I’m a peerless genius of the Lightning Divine Palace, and also the disciple of their King realm expert. If you kill me, you’ll be bringing his wrath upon yourself and the Luo Heaven Palace!”

Sensing the terrifying power of the sword qi, Liu Chengtian tried to use his identity and background to get her to stop.

However, he was only met with silence, followed by a vicious sword strike that seemed so bright that it eclipsed the sun.

“If you stop now, it’s still not too late!”

“As long as you stay by my side and serve me well, I will protect your Luo Heaven Palace.”

As Liu Chengtian blocked Shangguan Wan’er’s attack with great difficulty, he started to threaten her.

However, what he got in response was a flurry of attacks.

As time passed, the meridians in Liu Chengtian’s body were gradually frozen by Shangguan Wan’er’s ice intent, and his life force was rapidly being depleted.
