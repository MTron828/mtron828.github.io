Chapter 38: Don’t Come Over

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

At the same time, the second and third commanders formed a pincer attack, completely surrounding Yue.

The surrounding bandits also held weapons in their hands as they encircled Yue.

Even though she was faced with attacks from all directions, Yue did not panic in the slightest. The Qingyun sword in her hand blossomed with brilliant light, fiercely clashing against Baduluo’s long saber.

Clang!

An extremely powerful force suddenly swept out. The long saber in Baduluo’s hand instantly bent, and his body was forced back more than ten steps.

“Damn it! What grade of weapon is that?!”

Baduluo’s expression could not help but change greatly.

Whether it was the strength of their true essence energy, or the grade of their weapons, he could not compare to Yue.

Clang, Clang!

The Qingyun sword in Yue’s hand transformed into a sky full of sword shadows. With a crushing stance, she instantly sent the second and third commanders flying.

Their cultivation levels were not as high as Yue’s, and with the added difference in the grade of their weapons, they were easily and completely crushed by Yue.

Were it not for the fact that there were too many bandits surrounding Yue, she would have only needed two moves to kill those two!

......

After the two of them fell to the ground, they looked at their trembling right hands. Their hearts were filled with fear. How could they still dare to continue fighting?

The entire process happened within the blink of an eye. Before everyone could react, Yue lightly tapped her feet and stood up. Her sword qi formed a half-moon arc that swept out and slashed toward the bandits.

Ah…

In an instant, screams could be heard all over the place!

In just an instant, that half-moon arc sword qi killed more than ten bandits.

When everyone saw this scene, they were terrified.

The first commander could not defeat the other party, and the second and third commanders were sent flying with a single strike. The rest of the bandits could not even withstand a single strike from the other party without dying. How were they supposed to continue fighting like this?

What exactly happened? How could an ordinary person from two years ago become so terrifying?

At that moment, most of the bandits fearfully and frantically ran in all directions.

However, would Yue let them off? Yue’s figure moved, and the Qingyun sword in her hand emitted a resplendent light. Her sharp sword aura swept toward the bandits.

Each sword strike took the lives of several bandits.

Clang Clang Clang…

The sword and the saber clashed madly, but Baduluo was beaten back each. Cracks eventually started appearing on his long saber.

Bang!

At this moment, the Qingyun Sword in Yue’s hand burst forth with even more power, which instantly sent the long saber in Baduluo’s hand flying. At the same time, Yue’s foot kicked Baduluo’s abdomen.

The terrifying power of her kick was transmitted to Baduluo’s abdomen, sending him flying dozens of meters away.

Puff!

Baduluo struggled to get up, and spat out a mouthful of blood.

Why was there such a difference in strength between them? Were they not both fifth-level true essence state cultivators?

Despite noticing the injured Baduluo, Yue did not pursue him. Of course, it was not because she was soft-hearted, but rather because she did not want Baduluo to die so easily.

Yue immediately turned her attention to the other bandits.

She would never forget that her father had been killed by these bandits.

“You... Don’t come over. If you come over again, I will kill him...”

The bandit saw Yue’s cold gaze and was instantly terrified. In his panicked state, he placed his long saber on the neck of one of the villagers. He looked at Yue with a threatening gaze.

However, Yue acted as if she did not hear his threat and slowly walked toward him.

With Master around, there was no way these small fries could hurt those villagers.

When he saw Yue continue walking forward, the bandit’s face became even more ferocious and he roared with all his might.

“Are you deaf? Can you not hear what I’m saying? If you dare to take another step forward, I’ll kill him immediately...”

Immediately, the bandit’s spiritual power surged out crazily. His long saber was about to chop the villager to death!

However, before he could do so, he found that an invisible spiritual pressure had completely restricted his movements, rendering him immobile!

“What... What’s going on?” The bandit immediately panicked.

“Those who despise life deserve death!”

Yue looked at the bandit expressionlessly. The Qingyun sword in her hand released a sharp sword qi which left a deep wound on the bandit’s body. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

How did the bandits kill her father in the past? She would repay them tenfold today!

“Ah...”

The bandit screamed in pain. The deep wound was too painful. However, he could not move at this moment. He could only bear this pain that was worse than death.

“Run... Run!”

When the surrounding bandits saw this scene unfold, they felt fear within the depths of their hearts. They fled frantically.

However, the next second, their faces also changed drastically. They discovered that their bodies could no longer move.

“What’s going on? What’s going on?”

Many of the bandits’ faces were filled with shock. They suddenly realized that there was an invisible force that completely restrained their movements.

There... There was a top-tier powerhouse here?

Who was it?

However, at this moment, no one knew who this top-tier powerhouse was. When they saw Yue slowly approaching them with the Qingyun sword in hand, their bodies involuntarily trembled, and their eyes were filled with fear.

Yue did not show them the slightest bit of mercy. She repeated what they had done to her parents back then.

At that moment, screams could be heard all over Tashi village. The bandits’ screams made everyone’s scalp tingle.

When the villagers saw this scene, their eyes were filled with disbelief.

This girl was too powerful. She had actually dealt with these bandits so easily.

“Kill, kill these animals!”

“These animals deserve to die! They deserve to die!”

When the villagers saw the bandits’ miserable expressions, they did not show any mercy. Instead, they gritted their teeth and their faces were filled with hatred.

Many of the villagers even cried because of this. Those brutal bandits had killed countless villagers and robbed them of almost everything.

When they thought of their loved ones dying at the hands of those bandits, their hearts were filled with incomparable grief!

Now that they were witnessing the bandits receiving the punishment they deserved, they could no longer restrain the overflowing emotions in their hearts!
