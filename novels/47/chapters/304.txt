305 Black Flames Temple, Baili Moyan

After that, Shangguan Wan’er cultivated in the Tower of Heaven for another two months.

During this time, she did not continue focusing on her martial intents, but rather on the martial techniques and cultivation methods Ye Xuan taught her, specifically the spiritual sense tempering technique.

Even though her epiphany experience had ended, given her high comprehension value, she still managed to make significant progress.

“Alright, I should head back to the Luo Heaven Palace,” Shangguan Wan’er muttered to herself.

Although she wanted to bid her teacher goodbye, she also did not want to interrupt his secluded cultivation.

Helplessly, she could only bid farewell to Yue and the others before activating the jade token.

As Shangguan Wan’er’s spiritual power entered the jade token, a bright purple light suddenly burst forth and engulfed Shangguan Wan’er’s body.

The very next second, Shangguan Wan’er’s body suddenly disappeared.

At the same time, in the vast spatial turbulence, an energy barrier wrapped in purple light suddenly appeared. In an instant, it flew through space and brought Shangguan Wan’er to the Qingyun sect.

Shangguan Wan’er took one last look at Lingjiu Peak, then stretched out her hand to tear space apart to open a passageway toward the Miaoling Region.

After returning to the Luo Heaven Palace, Shangguan Wan’er personally took charge of the Luo Heaven Palace and waited for the sudden turn of events that Ye Xuan had mentioned.

In just half a month, it arrived.

The Miaoling Region was one of the hundreds of regions in the Huangyu Zone, and was adjacent to the Yunqing Region.

Although the Miaoling Region’s overall ranking in the Huangyu Zone was average, many cultivators were still wary of it, as there were many hidden lightning tribulation realm experts residing within it.

Within the Miaoling Region, the Luo Heaven Palace was undoubtedly the strongest force, and as its leader, Shangguan Wan’er was recognized as the strongest cultivator here.

Incidentally, she was also the object of desire of many young and talented geniuses, many of which had pursued Shangguan Wan’er fiercely.

Some of them who had gone overboard lost their lives at her hand.

In any case, the overall result was the same. Shangguan Wan’er rejected any and all admirers. Those who tried to use force were met with even greater force.

This was how she established her name and gained fame as a peerless legend in the Miaoling Region. It could be said that, within the Miaoling Region, Shangguan Wan’er’s status was identical to Ye Xuan’s status in the Nanzhou Region.

Still, among the super forces that Shangguan Wan’er had destroyed, there were still fishes that escaped the net. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

One of the young cultivators was not in the sect at the time and managed to escape.

Furthermore, Shangguan Wan’er did not possess the power of karma, so she was unable to detect or see karmic lines.

After more than 30 years, that young cultivator returned.

His name was Baili Moyan, and he was a peerless genius of the Black Flames Temples.

And 35 years ago, Shangguan Wan’er overwhelmingly crushed the Black Flames Temple.

Although it was not the strongest force in the Miaoling Region, it was still considered a super faction that dominated the region. Its status was equivalent to the Yunjin Temple in the Nanzhou Region, and it was also led by a pattern condensation realm expert.

At that time, Shangguan Wan’er had already made a name for herself in the Miaoling Region, and the Luo Heaven Palace had just been established.

The sect master had two sons, Baili Moyan and Baili Wentian.

Both were extremely talented and had boundless prospects.

Before Shangguan Wan’er, they were regarded as the twin strongest geniuses of the Miaoling Region.

However, after Shangguan Wan’er established the Luo Heaven Palace and showcased her unparalleled talent, her fame gradually surpassed theirs.

The martial techniques and cultivation methods she displayed far surpassed all of the geniuses in the Miaoling Region, and even eclipsed many masters of the different sects and factions in the Miaoling Region.

She could even defeat and kill cultivators who were at a higher cultivation level or realm than hers.

Back then, Baili Moyan was only at the early stage of the true core realm, and he caught sight of Shangguan Wan’er beauty. He was instantly smitten.

Back then, Shangguan Wan’er had only been a seventh-level unity realm cultivator.

In order to secure his prize, Baili Moyan asked his father, the sect master, and a tenth-level unity realm expert to act.

However, the end result was shocking. Shangguan Wan’er had killed the sect master with a single strike.

That was when everyone realized her true level of strength, which had reached the tenth level of the unity realm, and also the fact that she had comprehended many different martial intents. Her feat shocked the Miaoling Region, and also enraged the Black Flames Temple.

The Grand Elder of the Black Flames Temple, a pattern condensation realm expert, decided to act and kill Shangguan Wan’er to take revenge.

However, before the Grand Elder could even set off, she had already arrived at the territory of the Black Flames Temple.

Displaying triple intent fusion, she killed the Grand Elder. After that, she razed the Black Flames Temple to the ground.

As for Baili Moyan, he had been training elsewhere, and had thus managed to escape.

After learning of Shangguan Wan’er’s strength, Baili Moyan did not dare to take revenge. He swallowed his anger and changed his name to hide his identity.
