743 Stop Right There!

At this moment, the chiefs, elders, and some of the top disciples of the various peaks had already gathered in the main hall. They were all quietly waiting for the grand elder to speak.

After Yuelun entered the main hall, she first nodded at Ao Lei and then sat down in her assigned seat.

As a junior, Zhuge Yueyue definitely could not do the same. She pulled Feng Xiyun and Xiang Yun and greeted them respectfully.

“Junior Zhuge Yueyue greets Martial Uncle Ao.”

“Junior Feng Xiyun greets Martial Uncle Ao”

Xiang Yun was momentarily stunned, but after hearing what her first and second sisters had said, she followed suit.

“Junior Xiang Yun…”

Before Xiang Yun could finish speaking, Ao Lei, who was presiding over the event, trembled. He immediately stood up and said, “Stop, stop, stop. If you continue, I’ll suffer.”

Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun were fine, but this little girl was different. He really could not accept this little girl’s greetings.

In a flash, Ao Lei appeared in front of Xiang Yun and hurriedly stopped her from bowing.

Perhaps the others did not know, but he could not pretend to be ignorant.

This little girl was the reincarnation of a mighty expert, and possessed an incredible amount of fate energy and karma.

Perhaps only someone like Ye Xuan would dare to accept this little girl’s bow with a clear conscience.

If he allowed this little girl to bow toward him, he might be in deep trouble later.

When she saw that the grand elder actually did not allow her to pay her respects, Xiang Yun was unhappy. Why could her first and second sisters do it, but not her?

However, the more this was the case, the more she wanted to do it. She shook off Ao Lei’s hands and knelt on the ground.

‘Are you really trying to kill me?’

Fortunately, Ao Lei reacted quickly and quickly grabbed her shoulders and held her up before her knees touched the ground.

“Ha ha, little girl, you do not need to greet me. Your kind intentions are more than enough,” Ao Lei quickly said.

However, Xiang Yun could not understand the situation.

Why did he now want her to bow to him? Could it be that the method her teacher taught her to respect her elders was wrong?

She scratched her head somewhat helplessly, then immediately turned her gaze to Gao Shun, who was not far away, and the corners of her mouth curled up slightly.

Since he could not bow to the grand elder, then she should be to do so to this martial uncle, right?

“Martial Uncle Gao, Junior Xiang Yun…”

Heavens!

Gao Shun, who was originally sitting calmly in his seat, suddenly felt his heart tremble.

No no no!

He was so scared that his face turned pale.

In a flash, he had already appeared in front of Xiang Yun and kept her from kneeling.

“Ahaha, Little Xiang Yun, you don’t have to bow to me.”

Gao Shun was already sweating, and his heart was palpitating.

Seeing this comical scene, the disciples in the main hall widened their eyes in surprise.

“What’s going on?”

“Why doesn’t the grand elder and Martial Uncle Gao want this little girl to bow to them? Moreover, they look very afraid.”

“Although this little girl was the champion of the gathering, there’s no way she could make these big shots tremble with fear just by bowing, right?”

Among these disciples, many of them did not know where this little girl came from, so they were very confused.

“Let me enlighten you. This little girl from Cloud Sky peak is the reincarnation of a mighty expert. She possesses tremendous fate energy and karma.”

Hearing this, everyone was immediately jolted awake. They finally knew what the reason was.

“Oh dear, then we have to be careful around this little junior sister in the future. One wrong misstep, and it will be over for us!”

However, Xiang Yun was feeling very exasperated at this moment.

Why was it so difficult to bow?

Her Teacher had told her that whenever she met an elder, she had to greet them politely and bow at the same time?

Despite this, none of these elders allowed her to bow! Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

What was she supposed to do now?

After seeing that she had been rejected twice, she glanced at the other chiefs in the main hall. Seeing this, the other chiefs became jittery, and they prepared themselves for action.

At this moment, Xiang Yun’s lips curled up slightly and she began to smile evilly. However, after noticing the strange situation, Zhuge Yueyue quickly pulled Xiang Yun back and said, “Third Sister, you can’t act recklessly.”

“Alright then…”

After hearing Zhuge Yueyue’s words, she had no choice but to give up on the idea.

Fortunately, Zhuge Yueyue had acted in time. Otherwise, many people present would have been in trouble. In a sense, she had indirectly saved the lives of others.

“Alright…”

Seeing that everyone had arrived, Ao Lei stretched out his hands and gestured toward the crowd. Then, he glanced at Zhuge Yueyue and asked her to sit in Ye Xuan’s seat while keeping an eye on Xiang Yun. This was the only way they could keep this little girl under control.
