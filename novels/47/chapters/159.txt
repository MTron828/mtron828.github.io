“Teacher!”

Seeing this, Yue’s heart was filled with gratitude.

“Ding! As the host has given his disciple the Sword Orchid Valley Lord, the host has received a randomized 18x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the Sword Soul Tianshan herb!”

At the same time, the sound of a system notification suddenly rang out in Ye Xuan’s mind. In the system’s storage space, another heavenly treasure that could strengthen a Sword Dao constitution appeared.

“Yan’er, you are my disciple. In the future, you will naturally have to practice swordsmanship. Since that’s the case, keep this Sword Soul Tianshan herb with you. When the time comes in the future, I will definitely help you refine it,” Ye Xuan said seriously.

Since he had another disciple present, this was a good opportunity to get a better reward.

“Thank you, Teacher!”

Zhao Yuyan’s small hand took the Sword Soul Tianshan hern and carefully put it into her storage bracelet!

Although she did not know what use it had, judging from her teacher’s expression, it should be quite precious. Naturally, she had to handle it carefully.

“Okay!”

Seeing this, Ye Xuan could not help but reveal a satisfied expression. Then, he quietly waited for the system’s notification.

“Ding! As the host has given his disciple the Sword Soul Tianshan herb, the host has obtained a randomized 30x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the Origin Sword fruit!”

The Origin Sword fruit looked somewhat similar to the Dream Nebula spirit fruit. Its outer appearance was also covered by a crystal clear shell, but there were no stars inside. Instead, there was a crystalline fruit.

Most importantly, the fruit was in the shape of a longsword.

‘When the time comes, I can use this to get another reward from Li Qingyan. With the treasure I get from that reward, I should be able to reach the mastery level of the Sword Overlord body,’ Ye Xuan thought to himself.

Then, Ye Xuan refined a few more jade tokens to replace the ones that Yue had used.

“Alright! We should head to the Heavenly Lightning Pool,” Ye Xuan said.

In the next second, a surge of gentle power swept out and wrapped itself around the three girls. They then turned into a streak of light and disappeared into the horizon.

Originally, he did not have much confidence in his ability to comprehend the Heavenly Lightning intent. This had nothing to do with his comprehension value, but rather the fact that he simply did not have enough time.

There were only two days left until the closure of the mystic realm. It was impossible to comprehend the embryonic form of the Heavenly Lightning intent within such a short time.

However, things were now different. Ye Xuan’s heart was filled with confidence. There was a 90% chance that he could comprehend the embryonic form of the Heavenly Lightning intent.

The reason for this was simple. He just had to use the Dream Nebula spirit fruit!

The increased comprehension value would help, but the important point was the epiphany experience, which would almost certainly help him to comprehend the embryonic form of Heavenly Lightning intent in two days, Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Sigh! If I had known that this would happen, I wouldn’t have given the spirit burst flower to Yan’er!”

Ye Xuan sighed inwardly.

Of course, Ye Xuan could also keep the Dream Nebula spirit fruit and give it to Zhao Yuyan after a month had passed.

However, the chance to comprehend the Heavenly Lightning intent was difficult to come by. Throughout the entire Nanzhou Region, there were only a handful of places where this was possible, and the Moon Demon mystic realm was one of them.

It also happened to be the only place that Ye Xuan knew of.

Therefore, at present, refining the Dream Nebula spirit fruit to gain an epiphany at the Heavenly Lightning Pool was undoubtedly the best choice.

Ye Xuan moved quickly as he flew in the direction of the Heavenly Lightning Pool.

As time slowly passed, the scene gradually changed, and terrifying lightning snakes wreaked havoc in the sky.

“We’re almost there!”

Ye Xuan narrowed his eyes.

Moments later, the storage ring in his hand flashed, and the Dream Nebula spirit fruit entered his mouth.

A warm current suddenly gushed out from his dantian, and then wrapped itself around the spirit fruit.. He planned to wait until he reached the Heavenly Thunder Lightning pool and started comprehending the Heavenly Lightning intent before refining it.

As Ye Xuan and the others gradually approached the Heavenly Lightning Pool, the number of lightning snakes wreaking havoc in the sky increased. The dark clouds flickered with heart-palpitating lightning, and violent winds blew everywhere.

At the center, there was a terrifying thunderstorm cloud with a diameter of more than 200 kilometers, which emitted lightning bolts that were thicker than a person’s body.

The power of the lightning it emitted seemed to be able to devour everything.

Even though they were hundreds of miles away, Ye Xuan could still sense its incomparably terrifying aura.

The lightning power contained within that thunderstorm cloud was not ordinary lightning power. The thunderstorm cloud contained the power of the laws.
