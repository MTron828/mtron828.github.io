Chapter 34: Exterminating The Fengxuan Stronghold

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“I won’t need those bandits from the Fengxuan Stronghold after this. When they come back, I’ll send them off to the underworld!”

At that moment, the man’s lips curled up into a sneer.

He was a cultivation practitioner from the Xuanyin sect, though the bandits in the stronghold did not know that; they believed that he was a cultivator from some mysterious sect.

The Xuanyin sect had always been brutal in terms of their methods and techniques. Now that the mountain stronghold had lost its value, there was no need for it to exist anymore.

Once they completed their mission, it was time to tie up loose ends. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

In this way, not only could they keep the bloodstones a secret, but they could also put on an act for the Great Qian dynasty to see.

Over the past few years, the Fengxuan Stronghold had become a well-known bandit stronghold that everyone in the Yunhei city wanted to destroy. As long as they completely eradicated the Fengxuan Stronghold, they would definitely gain the support of countless people.

Not only would they be able to obtain a huge amount of qi and blood essence, but they would also be able to improve the image of their sect at the same time. It was like killing two birds with one stone.

This man and another cultivation practitioner of the Xuanyin sect were the ones responsible for supervising the Fengxuan Stronghold. That way, if they discovered that someone wanted to leak the secret, it would be easier for them to eradicate the enemy.

Although these bandits were not aware of their origins, it would be bad if other cultivation practitioners of other sects recognized their identities.

The bloodstone on the man’s chest had absorbed enough qi and blood essence when he was slaughtering another village a while back. Now, he just needed to wait for his Senior Brother’s bloodstone to absorb enough qi and blood essence before their mission was complete. There would be no reason to keep Fengxuan Stronghold around then.

“Not good! Enemy attack!”

......

Just as the man put away the bloodstone, a series of panicked shouts suddenly echoed throughout the stronghold.

“What?” The man frowned when he heard this, and then he quickly walked out.

He saw that there were four people attacking Fengxuan Stronghold, one man and three women.

“How can there be such a beautiful woman!”

When the man’s eyes landed on Yue, his eyes lit up.

However, his expression changed drastically shortly after.

“How is this possible? She’s actually a fifth-level true essence state cultivator...”

The next second, the sword in Yue’s hand emitted a sharp aura, and then she charged toward the bandits of Fengxuan Stronghold.

The true essence in her body swept out, and a powerful force quickly reaped the lives of those bandits.

Huang Ling and Xue Min, who were beside her, did not make a move. This was also Ye Xuan’s intention.

The bandits of Fengxuan Stronghold were the murderers who had massacred Lin Shi village. Logically speaking, Yue should take revenge herself. Only then would she be able to completely resolve the knot in her heart.

The strength of a fifth-level true essence state cultivator was so powerful that none of the bandits were a match for her. They could not even withstand a single blow from Yue.

Some of these bandits were in the Qi transformation state, though most were at the peak of the refinement state. How could they withstand Yue’s attacks?

Yue’s movement technique was as fast as a cheetah’s. Even when faced with dozens of bandits who were working together, none of them could land a blow on her.

“Damn it, this woman’s strength is too terrifying. Hurry up and run!”

The bandits who were still alive cried out with fear. After seeing their companions fall one by one, how could they still have any thoughts of resisting?

“Damn it! Where did these people come from?”

Seeing this scene, the man’s expression also changed greatly. He then moved his body and retreated frantically.

Although his cultivation had also reached the fifth level of the true essence state, he could not help but feel his heart palpitate when he felt the true origin power emitted from Yue’s body. He was especially wary of that longsword; its grade was definitely not ordinary.

Even if he attacked, he might not be able to defeat Yue. More importantly, she did not come alone.

Especially that man standing on top of the huge rock. Although he did not sense any spiritual power fluctuations from that man, when his gaze landed on that man, his heart trembled.

That man’s cultivation must have reached an extremely terrifying level. It was at the very least not lower than the purple spirit state!

“Damn it! It just so happens that Senior Brother isn’t here. Why did this group of people come over at this time? Why do that woman’s moves feel so familiar? I think I’ve seen it somewhere before. Could it be that this woman is from a top-tier sect?”

Once the man made his way beyond Ye Xuan’s line of sight, the power in his body gushed out crazily, and then he ran away quickly. Several thoughts flashed through his mind.

However, at this moment, he felt an extremely terrifying pressure fall from the sky, suppressing him to the point that he could not move at all.

“This... This is the pressure of a core formation state cultivator...”

Realizing this, the man widened his eyes in astonishment.

He was a cultivator from the Xuanyin sect, so how could he not know what such powerful pressure represented?

Only a core formation state cultivator could render a fifth-level true essence state cultivator like him unable to move using just his spiritual pressure.

“Damn it! How did I end up meeting such a powerful cultivator!” The man cursed in despair helplessly.

The very next second, an invisible force suddenly grabbed the man’s neck and pulled him over to Ye Xuan’s side.

“Ah... Messenger, please save us!”

“Help! I don’t want to die yet!”

The man who was held in the air by an invisible force could only watch as all the bandits in the stronghold were slaughtered.

Although the first commander of the Fengxuan Stronghold had taken away most of the forces, the fourth commander of the Whirlwind Stronghold was still alive. He was a cultivator who had reached the first level of the core formation state.

However, all of his comrades had fallen at the hands of the woman holding the longsword.

“As expected, it’s the Xuanyin sect again!”

Ye Xuan reached out his hand and gently waved it, easily catching the man in front of him.

At the same time, a bright light flashed and the bloodstone in the man’s arms suddenly landed in Ye Xuan’s palm.

Seeing this, the man’s eyes flickered furiously. He wanted to struggle, but he could not free himself from the invisible power at all.

Bang!

Ye Xuan gently squeezed his palm and the bloodstone in his palm instantly turned into nothingness. The rich qi and blood power slowly dissipated back into Heaven and Earth.

Just the impure qi and blood essence was not enough to tempt him.

Only those old monsters at the end of their lifespan would come up with such a crazy idea of wanting to use the impure qi and blood essence from mortals to break through.
