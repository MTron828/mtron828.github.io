“Who knows? However, Gao Tianyu is also Martial Uncle Gao’s son. Since Martial Uncle Gao is dead, isn’t it appropriate for Gao Tianyu to succeed him?”

“What did Martial Uncle Ue mean when he said that? Could it be that he doesn’t want Gao Tianyu to take on the responsibility of leading Hidden Sword peak?”

As the people were making wild guesses, even Yuelun looked at Ye Xuan in shock.

She was really confused. How could Ye Xuan still say such words at this moment?

!!

Was he still the Ye Xuan she loved?

Gao Tianyu was still very sad. He looked at Ye Xuan and asked in confusion, “Martial Uncle Ye, what do you mean by those words?”

He was also very clear about the bad blood between Cloud Sky peak and Hidden Sword peak.

However, now that he had lost his father, how could he dare to go against Ye Xuan? Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

If Ye Xuan really wanted to make things difficult for him, he would definitely not be able to take charge of Hidden Sword peak, and Hidden Sword peak might even end up being controlled by someone else.

At this moment, Gao Tianyu felt helpless like never before. He even felt that the whole world had turned gray.

At this moment, all kinds of memories of the past surged into his mind. He recalled all of the things he had done in the past, which had caused his cultivation to stagnate for a long time. He felt extremely remorseful.

After looking at the others’ strange expressions, Ye Xuan remained unbothered. Instead, he said calmly, “Why are all of you assuming that Gao Shun is gone for good?”

“Ah?”

After hearing this, everyone from the Great Wilderness Divine sect was once again stunned.

What did Ye Xuan mean by this?

Could it be that Martial Uncle Gao was not dead?

Yuelun even hurriedly went to check Gao Shun’s pulse, and immediately felt even more confused.

Gao Shun had long since lost all signs of life, so what did Ye Xuan mean by those words?

After hearing Ye Xuan’s words, Gao Tianyu was filled with hope and quickly hugged Ye Xuan’s thigh.

“Martial Uncle Ye, can my father still be saved? You have a way to save him, right?”

“Martial Uncle Ye, I beg you, please save my father!”

I’m very clear that we’ve provoked you several times before. But no matter what, we’re all from the same sect. Please save my father!”

“If Martial Uncle Ye can save my father, I’ll promise to do anything!”

At this moment, Gao Tianyu felt like he was holding onto his last strand of hope. He started to beg with tears streaming down his face.

As long as he could save his father, nothing else mattered.

At this moment, Ye Xuan felt very optimistic that Gao Tianyu would be able to change his ways in the future. There was still good within him.

“Teacher…”

Zhuge Yueyue tugged at Ye Xuan’s sleeve, her gaze saying everything.

After all, Martial Uncle Gao died to save everyone. If Ye Xuan really had a way to save uncle-master Gao, Zhuge Yueyue was more than willing to put in a few good words for Gao Tianyu.

Ye Xuan looked at his two disciples. There was no way that he was going to just let him die.

“Alright, all of you step back a little. Leave the rest to me.”

After saying this, Ye Xuan squatted beside Gao Shun’s body. He felt a little conflicted seeing him like this.

Gao Shun, who had never gotten along with him in the past, had risked his life to save his disciples. This was a favor that he needed to return.

After seeing that Ye Xuan was willing to save his father, Gao Tianyu was very excited.

“Martial Uncle Ye, I have no way to repay the favor of saving my father’s life, but I’ll definitely do anything you ask in the future,” Gao Tianyu said very sincerely.

Ye Xuan would definitely not lie about something like this. He definitely could save his father.

At that moment, a light flashed in Ye Xuan’s hand as he took out an immortal-grade recovery pill. This was the first time he was using one.

At first, he had thought that these pills would always remain in his storage space. After all, he had never thought that there would be a chance to use them. However, they had actually come in handy today.

In any case, he wanted to see how effective it was.

The moment he took it out, the pill’s extremely dense life aura was released in an instant.

“Heavens! What grade is that pill?”

People were already extremely surprised. They could clearly tell that the pill in Ye Xuan’s hand was extraordinary.

Surprisingly, Ye Xuan was actually willing to use such a precious medicinal pill to save Gao Shun’s life. Such pills were regarded as life-saving treasures, and would often be kept for one’s own use.

Were Gao Shun and Ye Xuan not always at odds with each other?

It seemed that Chief Ye Xuan was truly magnanimous. Then again, Gao Shun had shown incredible courage when he sacrificed himself for the disciples earlier.

Perhaps this was what a true sect was supposed to be like.

At this moment, everyone was shocked by Ye Xuan’s actions.

Ye Xuan silently stuffed the immortal recovery pill into Gao Shun’s mouth and used a special technique to guide it into his body.

At this moment, an extremely dense lifeforce was instantly injected into Gao Shun’s body, and even the sky displayed a strange phenomenon…
