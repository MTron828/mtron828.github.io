Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Boom!

Boom!

Boom!

Li Tiangang’s arms and legs were blown apart by Ye Xuan’s violent physical attacks. At one point, his head was twisted off.

However, even so, Li Tiangang was able to recover instantly.

Also, in addition to the wind intent, Li Tiangang had also comprehended third-level fist intent.

Therefore, while fighting, Ye Xuan was also secretly comprehending his opponent’s fist intent. In comparison to the supreme intents he had comprehended, this was child’s play, and his comprehension progressed rapidly.

“Ye Xuan!”

“Detestable b*stard!”

Li Tiangang’s roars never stopped, and his heart was filled with anger.

This guy was not fighting him, he was humiliating him!

Moreover, he could clearly sense that Ye Xuan was treating him as a training dummy.

As time slowly passed, Li Tiangang also noticed that Ye Xuan’s fist intent was improving.

Although he was furious, he was also shocked.

This guy was too freakish!

He was using this battle to comprehend his opponent’s intent.

“Ye Xuan! I will definitely kill you!”

Under Ye Xuan’s endless physical attacks, Li Tiangang had been beaten black and blue.

Were it not for the life force contained in his divine elements, he would have died many times over.

He could not beat Ye Xuan, and he could not escape either!

This frustrated him to no end.

Ye Xuan ignored his roars, and continued hitting him with his fists to hone his fist intent.

Fighting Li Tiangang was a great opportunity to improve his fist intent, and there was no way he was going to pass up that opportunity. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The comprehension of fist intent would lead to the chance to comprehend strength intent, which was a supreme intent. Strength intent represented the purest form of power in this world. There were no fancy tricks, just raw power.

Therefore, Ye Xuan had to make the most of this opportunity to milk Li Tiangang for all that he was worth.

While Li Tiangang was aggrieved by this, he was also secretly thankful that Ye Xuan could not kill him. He mistakenly believed that Ye Xuan was using his full strength at the moment.

Under normal circumstances, unity realm experts at the same realm would not be able to kill each other.

It was because of this that he felt that he was being humiliated and roared.

Furthermore, in the rumors, Ye Xuan seemed to be a swordsman, right? Why was he not using his sword?

This fellow was clearly messing with him, and was also stealing his fist intent for his own use.

How dare he!

This guy was really a monster!

After the news of Ye Xuan’s feat in the Tower of Heaven reached the Nether God sect, they immediately sent out people to confirm that the Ye Xuan from the Tower of Heaven and the Ye Xuanwho had killed their personal disciple and elder were one and the same.

After confirming it, they were shocked, but also wary. If Ye Xuan were allowed to grow, he would very quickly become powerful enough to threaten the Nether God sect.

He had to be eliminated immediately!

Therefore, in order to ensure that there were no accidents, the strongest elder of the Nether God sect was dispatched.

However, no one expected Ye Xuan to show up here, right in their own backyard!

As such, when he received the message from the Seventh Prince, Li Tiangang immediately rushed over without asking anyone for help.

This was supposed to be a great opportunity for him to earn merit.

However, he was wrong.

No, everyone was wrong!

Ye Xuan was now so powerful that he was just a training dummy that could be used and abused. He could not even escape, even when he used his wind intent.

Ye Xuan was somehow even faster than him!

Thus, when he recalled Ye Xuan’s identity as a sword cultivator, anxiousness filled his heart.

Would Ye Xuan be able to kill him with a sword?

Was this guy really only 20 years old?

This whole situation was completely illogical. How did this guy become so heaven-defying?
