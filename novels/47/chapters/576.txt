577 Auction (Part 2)

Feng Xiyun quickly understood what her senior sister meant when she said those words. She quickly explained, “Those women are indeed quite miserable. They might have been sold to this place when they were young, and trained to be maidservants who would receive the auction house’s guests.”

“The training is quite harsh, and is meant to ensure complete loyalty and obedience to the auction house.”

“This does seem very cruel, but this is how the mystic world is. It’s the law of the jungle. They happened to get the short end of the stick, and lack the strength to change their fate.”

After hearing Feng Xiyun’s words, Zhuge Yueyue’s face had already turned pale. She felt a little scared. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

If Ye Xuan had not taken her in as a disciple, would she have ended up like these women?

Thinking of this, Zhuge Yueyue felt disgusted, but at the same time, her heart was filled with gratitude toward Ye Xuan. He truly was her life-saving benefactor.

Looking at Ye Xuan’s back, she felt an unprecedented sense of security.

After a while, she said to Feng Xiyun, “Thankfully, Teacher took me in. Otherwise, I might have ended up like them.”

Hearing this, Feng Xiyun smiled lightly. She held Zhuge Yueyue’s hand and replied, “Our experiences are actually somewhat similar.”

Compared to Zhuge Yueyue, Feng Xiyun’s situation was only slightly better off. Being used for marriage, she was actually no different from a tool.

The two of them looked at each other. The meaning within their gazes was self-evident. Then, they followed Ye Xuan closely into a luxurious room.

“Sir, this is one of the most luxurious rooms in our auction house, Suite 001,” Han Sikong said fawningly.

He had wanted to add that this suite could only be entered by the top guests of the auction house.

However, he was afraid of making Ye Xuan unhappy, so he silently kept these words in his heart. None of the previous top guests could compare to Ye Xuan’s status anyway.

Walking into the suite, Ye Xuan scanned the room and felt that it was pretty good.

“This place is pretty decent.”

After saying that, Ye Xuan walked over to a luxurious chair and sat down, as if it were his own home.

‘Eh… This feeling isn’t bad. It makes me feel like a tycoon,’ Ye Xuan thought to himself.

After some time, he stood up and said to Han Sikong, “Alright, help me take a look at these treasures first. Then, you can auction them off.”

“I’m in a hurry, as I probably have to make a trip to the Immortal Divine sect later to help exterminate them.”

‘Heavens! Did he need to add that information tidbit?’

Although Ye Xuan’s words were calm and uncaring, Han Sikong was dumbfounded.

Such words were enough to have him shaking in his boots, and his back was already covered in cold sweat. Even standing beside Ye Xuan, he felt a little uncomfortable.

He did not doubt Ye Xuan’s words.

After all, the battle between the Great Wilderness Divine sect and the Immortal Divine sect had already become widely known.

Grand Elder Ao Lei was probably there doing his thing already.

‘I can’t afford to provoke such an existence.’

‘I’ve got to keep him happy.’

“Alright, sir. I’ll get it done right away,” Han Sikong shivered and quickly replied.

After taking a careful look at Ye Xuan’s treasures, Han Sikong took out some of the more precious ones and set them aside for the main auction in a while.

As for the other common items, they would be put up for auction at the secondary auction.

After doing all this, Han Sikong was once again at a loss for words.

Ye Xuan’s wealth was unimaginable.

The Yama’s needles were probably the most precious treasure that their auction house had ever sold.

After all, a treasure like this would normally be kept for one’s own use. Which expert would be willing to auction it?

What Han Sikong did not understand was that the treasure he thought was precious was just an ordinary thing to Ye Xuan. It was not worth mentioning at all.

“Sir, I’m done checking them. The Yama’s needles, as well as the ice and fire-attribute flexible armor sets, will be the main auction’s final items.”

“What kind of price do you want to set for them?”

Han Sikong asked in a trembling voice.

However, Ye Xuan did not know much about the prices of these things, so he replied indifferently, “You have full authority to decide.”

Han Sikong smiled and raised two fingers.

“What do you think about having the starting bid set at 20 million taels of profound silver?”

F*ck!

This time, it was Ye Xuan’s turn to be surprised. The starting price was already 20 million taels of profound silver?
