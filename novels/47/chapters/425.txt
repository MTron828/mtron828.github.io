426 Hua Rufeng’s Shock

When she had first entered the Great Wilderness Divine sect, it was Hua Rufeng who had taken care of her and taught them the sect’s rules.

“Haha, I didn’t expect Junior Sister Zhuge to have become even more beautiful after only a few months,” Hua Rufeng laughed and teased.

Zhuge Yueyue’s face turned slightly red. She was a little shy from the praise.

“Xiyun, the person in front of you is the eldest senior brother of our Great Wilderness Divine sect. His name is Hua Rufeng, but you can call him Senior Brother Hua.”

Zhuge Yueyue hurriedly introduced him to Feng Xiyun.

“Greetings, Senior Brother Hua,” Feng Xiyun said politely.

“Senior Brother Hua, she is the disciple that Master has just accepted. Her name is Feng Xiyun.”

When Hua Rufeng’s eyes fell on Feng Xiyun, he was shocked.

‘Oh my God, another genius with a divine bone!’

Hua Rufeng was dumbfounded.

Furthermore, her divine bone seemed to be no weaker than Zhuge Yueyue’s profound ice divine bone.

In the future, if they were to encounter some opportunities, they might even be able to evolve these divine bones into immortal bones.

Immortal bones were comparable to Dao bodies.

‘Martial Uncle Ye Xuan has an extraordinary eye for talent.’

Although he only had two disciples, both were extremely talented.

Furthermore, Ye Xuan himself was a monster.

When Chief Tian Xuan brought him back, he was ridiculed by the cultivators of the other peaks, who thought that he had become old and muddled. How could he bring back such a piece of trash?

However, in a mere hundred years, that piece of trash had already become a mystic lord realm expert!

If Ye Xuan was a f*cking piece of trash, then what were they?

Thinking this, Hua Rufeng’s body trembled slightly.

Seeing it for himself, he now believed that Cloud Sky peak was the most impressive of the seven peaks of the Great Wilderness Divine sect.

“Junior Sister Feng is indeed extraordinary. Your level of talent almost gave me a heart attack just now.”

When she heard Hua Rufeng’s generous praise, Feng Xiyun felt a little shy.

She knew in her heart that the reason why she had this divine bone was entirely due to her teacher’s efforts.

“Hmm, what is Junior Sister Zhuge’s cultivation level now?”

Hua Rufeng asked straightforwardly.

Gongsun Shouyue had specifically instructed him to check on their cultivation levels.

Hearing this, Zhuge Yueyue hesitated and looked at Ye Xuan.

Ye Xuan smiled and nodded, indicating that it was fine to reveal it.

“Senior Brother Hua, I’ve already reached the second level of the materialization realm,” Zhuge Yueyue said.

‘En, second level of the divine mystic realm. That’s not bad!’

Hua Rufeng smiled and nodded.

Two months ago, Zhuge Yueyue had already reached the first level of the divine mystic realm, so taking two months to reach the second level was to be expected.

However, Hua Rufeng was still a little disappointed.

Suddenly, Hua Rufeng jolted to attention.

‘Wait a minute! What did she just say?’

“What? Junior Sister, did you just say that you’ve broken through to the second level of the materialization realm?!”

“Yes, is there something wrong?”

Zhuge Yueyue was a little puzzled by his reaction.

Hearing this, Hua Rufeng was dumbfounded.

Could it be that she thought it was natural for her to reach the materialization realm in two months?

“That’s unbelievable. You’ve made such huge strides in just two months?

Hua Rufeng’s eyes were filled with disbelief.

Even a genius with a high-grade divine bone could not accomplish this feat, right?

Zhuge Yueyue then responded in a serious tone, “Actually, there’s nothing strange about it. When Teacher and I went out to train, we killed many berserk beasts and seemed to have absorbed quite a bit of power from their precious bones. That’s why my cultivation advanced a bit faster.”

Of course, Zhuge Yueyue kept one thing from him.

Due to the effect of the heavenly marrow pill, Zhuge Yueyue’s body had been completely transformed.

It was also because of this that when Zhuge Yueyue absorbed the precious bones of the berserk beasts, there were no side effects.

The medicinal power of the heavenly marrow pill would remove the impurities from the precious bone, allowing her to absorb it easily.

However, due to her rapid breakthroughs, there were still some problems.

At that moment, her cultivation foundation was still not fully stable, which was why Ye Xuan had brought her out to train and gain experience.

Now, after 60 days of continuous training and tempering, Zhuge Yueyue’s cultivation foundation had become extremely stable, and her spiritual power flowed smoothly.

“I see!”

Hearing this, Hua Rufeng could not help but come to a sudden realization, and envy welled up in his heart.

Zhuge Yueyue really had a good teacher. He was always paying attention to her cultivation.

At the other peaks, most disciples would be left to their own devices after being taught the necessary cultivation techniques. Only those stronger and more outstanding disciples would receive personal attention and guidance from the chiefs.

Otherwise, it was usually the senior disciples guiding the junior disciples.

In fact, it was not particularly rare for people to absorb the power of precious bones to increase their cultivation, just like Zhuge Yueyue.

However, normally, cultivators would not dare to absorb too much power from precious bones. After all, not only did the precious bones of the berserk beasts contain dense spiritual energy, but also the remnant thoughts and grudges of the berserk beasts while they had been alive.

If one’s sea of consciousness was invaded by these thoughts and grudges, it might cause a case of cultivation deviation, or in more serious cases, death.

Hua Rufeng’s teacher, Gongsun Shouyue, was the sect master of the Great Wilderness Divine sect. He had to deal with all the matters of the sect every day, and did not have the time to take care of his disciples’ cultivation progress.

If they were to have any problems while absorbing the precious bone’s power, their future as cultivators would be bleak.

It was precisely because of this that Hua Rufeng was very cautious in doing things, especially when it came to cultivation.

“What about Junior Sister Feng?”

Hua Rufeng’s gaze fell on Feng Xiyun. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Feng Xiyun had just joined the sect, so her current cultivation level should not be anything special, right?

“Me?” Feng Xiyun smiled lightly and said playfully, “Senior Brother Hua, I’m currently a third-level divine mystic realm cultivator.”
