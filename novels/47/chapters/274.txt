Chapter 275: Is This Guy That Selfless?

“This is Teacher’s jade token. Once you’ve thought it through, just crush it and Teacher will come and meet you!”

In the spot where he had been, a streak of light suddenly flew out and landed in front of Shangguan Wan’er, materializing into a jade token.

“B*stard!”

When Shangguan Wan’er saw this, she was stunned at first, and then she gritted her teeth and glared angrily in the direction Ye Xuan had left.

‘When did I agree to acknowledge him as my teacher? How dare he call me his precious disciple!’

Shangguan Wan’er’s hand was filled with great power, and she was about to crush the jade token.

However, she stopped herself.

Looking at the shimmering jade token, Shangguan Wan’er took a deep breath and put it away.

Hu!

Moments later, her body turned into a streak of light and disappeared in the direction of the Miaoling Region.

Shangguan Wan’er wanted to use the power of the Luo Heaven Palace to investigate Ye Xuan’s identity.

A monster like Ye Xuan was not an ordinary person.

Shangguan Wan’er was very curious. Where did Ye Xuan come from? What was his identity?

Two days later, Shangguan Wan’er returned to Luo Heaven Palace.

In an instant, the entire Miaoling Region was mobilized. Whether it was the sects or the empires, they were all busy searching for Ye Xuan’s identity.

Shangguan Wan’er also felt that she could only be her true self when she returned to Luo Heaven Palace.

The dignity of an ancient great empress could not be violated by anyone.

Two days later, all of the information about Ye Xuan was presented to Shangguan Wan’er.

After examining Ye Xuan’s background, Shangguan Wan’er recalled the cultivator she had killed in the lightning tribulation mystic realm.

That person had also said Ye Xuan’s name before he died.

At that time, she had been quite puzzled and had been thinking that she had been mistaken for someone else. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Was there another cultivator as freakish as her in this world?

Now, it seemed that there was.

He reached the tenth level of the unity realm at the age of 20 and comprehended many different kinds of supreme intents.

‘This guy is definitely the reincarnation of an ancient almighty expert!’

‘As for becoming his disciple…’

At the thought of this, Shangguan Wan’er’s eyes flickered.

‘Is this guy really that good? Is he really willing to give such precious treasures to his disciples?’

‘Does such a kind person exist in this world?’

Shangguan Wan’er’s right hand rubbed the jade token Ye Xuan had given her, as she fell into deep thought.

‘Hold on! How can I be having such thoughts? This guy is definitely lying to me. I must not be fooled!’

Shangguan Wan’er immediately dispelled the distracting thoughts and put away the jade token into her storage ring.

After that, she took out the blood-red saber, planning to comprehend the slaughter intent within it.

However, she soon faced an awkward problem.

As soon as she closed her eyes, Ye Xuan’s figure would appear in her mind.

“What is this? Why would such a thing happen?”

Shangguan Wan’er’s expression changed.

Ever since she had awakened the memories of her previous life, she had been fully focused on cultivation. No other cultivator had piqued her interest before.

This had now changed.

…

Qingyun sect, Nanzhou Region.

As soon as Ye Xuan returned to the sect, he found that the karmic line between him and Shangguan Wan’er had become more solid.

“Is that tsundere empress’s imagination running wild for some reason?”

Ye Xuan muttered to himself.

Elsewhere, Shangguan Wan’er’s cultivation had been disturbed by Ye Xuan’s matter, and she could not focus on her cultivation.

Thus, in order to get rid of the distracting thoughts in her heart, Shangguan Wan’er once again examined the information about Ye Xuan.

When she learned of Ye Xuan’s deeds and the rapid rise of his disciples’ strength within a short period of time, her heart was shaken.

It seemed that this guy was really good to his disciples. He was actually willing to perform spiritual power infusion for them!

However, there were certain risks to spiritual power infusion.

The one with the weaker cultivation level might be unable to withstand the other party’s power, and thus directly explode and die. Even if they were lucky enough to survive, their cultivation foundation would be greatly damaged, ending their cultivation journey and future.

Therefore, even though spiritual power infusion sounded wonderful, the complexity and danger involved could not be underestimated.

Shangguan Wan’er was not sure if Ye Xuan’s disciples had suffered similar fates, so she launched a detailed investigation on Ye Xuan’s disciples.

However, the result was obvious. With Ye Xuan’s help, his disciples’ cultivation levels had soared, to the point that their cultivation speed was almost on par with her own.

If this continued, Ye Xuan’s disciples would definitely not be inferior to her in the future, and might even surpass her.

Furthermore, they did not seem to suffer from any of the side-effects of breaking through rapidly.

Ye Xuan must have taught his disciples spiritual sense tempering techniques as well, which were incredibly precious.

In the entirety of the Miaoling Region, she was basically the only one who had the spiritual sense tempering technique.

Shangguan Wan’er felt that Ye Xuan’s actions were unbelievable. Were his disciples his biological daughters or something like that?
