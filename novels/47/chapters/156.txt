Chapter 157: It’s Just A Mere Yunjin Temple

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Boom!

Ye Xuan’s fist did not stop at all and struck the second layer of the energy barrier, which shattered moments later as well.

“How…”

“Pfft!”

Before the monk could finish speaking, Ye Xuan’s fist landed on his chest.

The Demon Subjugation Body that the monk practiced emitted dazzling light. However, moments later, it turned extremely dim.

Boom!

The monk’s body was sent flying like a cannonball.

Puff!

The monk’s chest collapsed, and he spat out blood as his body smashed into the side of a mountain, destroying the trees and creating a large pit at the site of the impact.

Ye Xuan looked at him indifferently as he continued rushing forward.

Despite his injuries, the monk was not dead. He activated the divine elements in his body, healing him.

Ye Xuan was not worried. The punch he had thrown earlier was just an ordinary punch.

Even so, it had brought the monk to the gates of hell. In fact, without the two-layered energy barrier, the monk would already be dead.

How was this possible?

How long had it even been since they last fought?

How had he become so strong so quickly?

Had this fellow reached the second level of the unity realm?

Many questions flashed through the monk’s mind. Fear, shock, and confusion gripped his heart.

The monk chose not to resist any further. He knew very well that Ye Xuan had almost killed him with just an ordinary punch. If the latter used his sword qi, he would be reduced to ashes instantly.

He no longer thought about the Buddha Spirit fruit!

“Almsgiver, this penniless monk…”

The monk wanted to lower his head and apologize, but his face instantly turned pale.

Ye Xuanniao ignored him. He slowly raised his right fist and was about to land another punch. If this one landed, the monk would definitely die!

“Almsgiver! Everything is this penniless monk’s fault. Please show mercy!”

“If you kill me, the Yunjin Temple will definitely not let this slide!”

The monk shouted with fear on his face.

“Oh? Then, if I let you go, will you forget about our previous enmity?”

Ye Xuan looked at the monk questioningly.

“Of course, of course. As long as you let me go, the enmity between us will be written off, and the Yunjin temple will certainly not look for trouble with almsgiver!”

However, a hint of killing intent flashed in the depths of his eyes. How could someone with such monstrous talent be allowed to live?

Once he left the mystic realm, he would use every available method and resource to kill Ye Xuan.

At that time, the humiliation he had suffered at Ye Xuan’s hands would definitely be repaid a hundred-fold.

Currently though, saving his life was more important!

“Hehe, did you really think that I’d believe you?”

Ye Xuan responded casually. His right fist began to exude terrifying power as he slowly coated it with fist intent.

Hehe! Did this monk take him for a fool? Not only had he tried to snatch the Buddha Spirit fruit earlier, but he had almost harmed Yue, forcing her to use the jade tokens.

“You… are you really not afraid of Yunjin Temple’s revenge?”

“If you kill me, not only will you die, but the sect you belong to will also…”

However, before the monk could finish his words, Ye Xuan’s fist had already struck.

“You don’t have to worry! It’s just a mere Yunjin Temple! I almost forgot to tell you! I also killed another monk using an alms bowl from Yunjin temple earlier.”

A cold smile hung on the corners of Ye Xuan’s mouth.

“How did this…”

Hearing this, the monk’s expression changed drastically.

Ye Xuan’s fist was suffused with fist intent. It instantly mashed into the monk’s body.

The world trembled. Cracks appeared on the ground. There was now a trench that was hundreds of meters deep on the ground.

Hundreds of kilometers away, countless cultivators also sensed this terrifying power. When they saw the trench appear, differing expressions appeared on their faces.

At the same time, at the Heavenly Lightning Pool, those unity realm experts who were trying to comprehend the Heavenly Lightning intent instantly opened their eyes. They stared in Ye Xuan’s direction with uncertain expressions.
