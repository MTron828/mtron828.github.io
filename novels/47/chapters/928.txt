929 Negotiations

Right now, the Thunder-Devouring Beast was like a bomb. However, it was a disarmed bomb, so it could only intimidate its opponent. It had indeed intimidated Ye Xuan, but Ye Xuan had powered through.

Thus, if someone managed to make it past its tough facade, it would have to flee.

After pondering for a moment, Ye Xuan said with a serious expression, “Cough cough. After learning about your experiences, I also feel deeply moved.”

“However, there is one thing you must understand. Even if I choose to let you go today, you will still encounter others in the future, and they might not be as merciful as I am.”

Hearing this, the Thunder-Devouring Beast’s heart skipped a beat. What Ye Xuan said was actually very reasonable. After all, it had already encountered many such people. It was just that it managed to scare them away.

“Then what can I do? I’ve been hiding in the ancient palace all this while, but I was still discovered by these people. I’m also very helpless about this.”

Ye Xuan smiled and said, “Actually, I still have a way to help you…”

Hearing this, the Thunder-Devouring Beast’s eyes instantly lit up. It was like a ray of light in the endless darkness.

Its despairing expression was replaced by a bright smile at this moment. It said in a very friendly manner, “When I saw you for the first time, I felt that you must be extraordinary. Little brother, why don’t you tell me how to deal with my current situation?”

After Ye Xuan saw that the little fish had been hooked, the corners of his mouth curled up slightly as he said, “Haha, isn’t it easy?”

“From now on, you can be my subordinate. As your big brother, I will definitely protect you well.” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

After hearing Ye Xuan’s words, the Thunder-Devouring Beast instantly flew into a rage and cursed, “You’re insulting me!”

“No matter what, I’m an ancient divine beast, a Thunder-Devouring Beast. My bloodline is extremely noble! In that chaotic era, my ancestor was an expert who could make people tremble with a casual wave of his hand.”

“But now you actually want me to be your subordinate? Where do you want me to put my face?”

The Thunder-Devouring Beast refused without hesitation. Death was better than such a shameful existence.

Ye Xuan was stunned. This coward had actually refused an opportunity to survive?

It seemed that he had actually underestimated this Thunder-Devouring Beast.

Just as Ye Xuan was about to say something else, he heard the beast say, “Tell me in detail. Since you want me to become your subordinate, you’re going to offer me something worthwhile, right?”

Huh?

What happened to its firm attitude just now? What happened to the rage it felt from its noble bloodline being insulted? Was it not afraid of its ancestors crawling out of their graves to beat it up?

Ye Xuan was really dumbfounded at this moment. He did not expect the Thunder-Devouring Beast’s attitude to change so quickly.

The Thunder-Devouring Beast smiled awkwardly and said, “Haha, I’m actually forced to do this. At the moment, I don’t even know how to survive. My ancestors won’t want me to die either…”

“If the conditions you offer are generous enough, perhaps I might agree. I believe that my ancestors will not say anything about it then.”

For the Thunder-Devouring Beast, what was more important than being alive?

“Haha…”

Ye Xuan really laughed out loud at this moment. This Thunder-Devouring Beast was really a funny creature. It did not even have a bottom line at all. It was very much to his liking.

After a moment of relief, Ye Xuan said, “Alright… As for what I can give you… Perhaps I can help you regain your former glory.”

Hearing this, the Thunder-Devouring Beast’s eyes flashed with excitement.

“What do you think about that? Do you want some time to think about it properly?”

The Thunder-Devouring Beast stared at Ye Xuan without blinking. Could this kid help it return to his peak and regain its former glory?

It was not sure.

Seeing that it was still thinking, Ye Xuan’s lips curled up slightly and said, “If you become my subordinate, I can tell you something definite.”

“From now on, no one will dare to have any designs on your body. Not only that, I can help you to complete your lightning divine runes and greatly increase your strength.”

“Even if you encounter some experts in the same cultivation realm as you in the future, you won’t be beaten to the point of having to flee like this. What do you think?”

Hearing these tempting terms, the Thunder-Devouring Beast’s heart shook violently. It did not lack power, but experience and techniques. Its current strength was simply due to its innate bloodline. It had not been taught by anyone at all, and had no basis to start comprehending new techniques.

Therefore, it had channeled its efforts into improving its aura. If it could properly use its power, its combat strength would definitely increase significantly.

The Thunder-Devouring Beast was already moved by Ye Xuan’s words. However, it still looked calm and composed, as if it did not care about these things at all.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan was at a loss. It seemed that this Thunder-Devouring Beast was not an easy target to deceive. However, what Ye Xuan was forgetting was that this Thunder-Devouring Beast was a best actor nominee.
