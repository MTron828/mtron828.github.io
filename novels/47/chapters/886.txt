887 Gathering Of Geniuses (Part 1)

It seemed that she was mistaken. Ye Xuan did make a move, but it was not the one she had expected, even if she anticipated it a little. He just wanted to give her an opportunity.

After sensing the surging power in her body, Yuelun was extremely shocked. Where had Ye Xuan obtained so much energy?

He had just given quite a bit of power to Ao Lei, and now was giving her power left?

What Yuelun did not know was that Ye Xuan had only given half of the power to Ao Lei. He still had half left.

In the end, he had to take care of his woman as well.

Seeing Yuelun lying obediently in his arms, Ye Xuan could not help but stroke her hair lovingly. He did not help Yuelun plant a Dao Flower. After all, she had a Dao of her own choice and there was still room for growth.

Ao Lei was not like that. If Ye Xuan did not help him plant the Dao Flower, he would probably end up dead. Thankfully, this Dao Flower was suitable for his cultivation path. Otherwise, things might have been much more difficult.

As Ye Xuan transferred the remaining power into Yuelun’s body, she fell into a similar mysterious state. Ye Xuan gazed at her pretty face lovingly and waited quietly.

With the help of this power, she would likely be able to reach the peak of the ancient realm. However, it would not be enough for her to break through and reach the sealed immortal realm.

Thus, Ye Xuan was faced with a dilemma. How could he help Yuelun reach the sealed immortal realm.?

This matter was very tricky. Perhaps the Chiliad Gold Vine that he had given her could help her break through this realm barrier?

After pondering the matter for some time, he decided to wait until she woke up to figure things out. Then, he began to cultivate.

He could feel that he was only a hair’s breadth away from the Eternal realm.

Perhaps it would not be long before he would leave this continent and explore the worlds beyond.

However, before he left, he had to make sufficient preparations and leave behind something for his three disciples…

Elsewhere, the sky above the vast East Sea was already densely packed with figures, both human and non-human. Every single person there was focused on the ancient palace.

At this moment, as the ground trembled, rays of golden light descended again, catching everyone’s attention.

After the light dissipated, a golden-furred tiger walked over arrogantly and domineeringly.

After seeing the figure of the golden tiger, a commotion broke out.

“Oh my god, it’s actually a golden tiger!”

At this moment, Elder Tongtian’s face was filled with gloom as he stared at the proud golden tiger, which seemed to disregard everyone around it.

“Golden tigers are the descendants of ancient divine beasts recorded in ancient books. In that chaotic era, their race was an overlord-level existence.”

The cultivators from the East continent became worried. How could they compete with such powerful opponents?

Golden tigers had an extremely noble bloodline, and this one had already reached the supreme realm. They did not stand a chance!

“Teacher, it will be very difficult for our East continent to stand out this time.”

Mu Beichen’s expression also became very gloomy.

Even though he had tried his hardest, and had the full support of the sect, he had only reached the peak of the mystic lord realm, and had not managed to break through that crucial realm barrier to the supreme realm.

Originally, he thought that this would be enough. However, his hopes were cruelly crushed by reality when this golden tiger appeared.

“Sigh…”

Elder Tongtian sighed deeply and said, “What can we do? After all, the bloodline of the golden tiger provided them with an unmatched advantage. Even a young golden tiger like this one has reached the supreme realm.” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Our East continent is a barren place, so how can we compare with others? Based on the current situation, it seems that we can only take things one step at a time.”

After the ancient palace appeared, more and more geniuses gathered. At this moment, Elder Tongtian did not know what to do at all.

“Hurry up and look over there. Another supreme realm genius has appeared.”

As soon as that person finished speaking, a blue light descended from the sky. Then, a white tiger with lightning crackling all over its body appeared.

After seeing the lightning tiger, the golden tiger lowered its head, its eyes filled with wariness.

This lightning tiger came from an ancient clan in the Xuan continent. It was extremely ferocious and liked to kill people wherever it went.

Like the golder tiger, it also possessed a noble bloodline and had reached the supreme realm. Even the golden tiger was not really confident that it could defeat the lightning tiger.

The lightning tiger also noticed the golden tiger’s existence, and its gaze turned serious. Then, it turned around and looked at the other cultivators below as it spoke without any restraint.

“You’re all trash, yet you actually dared to come here and try to obtain a piece of the pie? How shameless!”

As soon it finished speaking, the lightning tiger looked at its followers and ordered, “Kill them all!”

Moments later, hundreds of figures charged forward from behind the lightning tiger and pounced on the cultivators below, trying to kill them all.

To the lightning tiger, only those who were on par with it in terms of strength and bloodline were worthy of recognition. As for those cultivators below, they were no better than ants, and should thus be stepped on and killed.
