“Chief Ye Xuan, when will Daoist Yi Feng regain consciousness?”

After sensing the situation outside, the elders in the secret chamber were all very flustered.

They wanted to immediately take action, but had not been given any orders. Furthermore, Daoist Yi Feng had yet to wake up, so they did not dare to act rashly and could only watch as the disciples at Sky Mountain fought.

“Martial Uncle Yi Feng has just broken through, and his life force has been restored. However, he still needs time to consolidate his cultivation foundation. Only then will he be able to stabilize his cultivation.”

“As for when he will wake up, I’m not sure. It depends on him,” Ye Xuan replied. After all, when he reached the ancient realm, he had also taken a few days to consolidate his cultivation foundation.

However, Daoist Yi Feng Was different. He was already very old, and now that he had obtained so much life force, he would probably have to spend even more time.

At this moment, another elder rushed in from outside and said, “Junior Brother, we received news that a fierce battle is already taking place, but even if they have the defensive formation, if the attacks do not stop, they won’t be able to last too long.”

“Furthermore, there’s an ancient realm monster in the sky above Sky Mountain. If it attacks, the defensive line will collapse.”

Hearing this, the atmosphere turned silent. With how things were, only Ye Xuan could successfully salvage the situation. However, he was stuck here guarding Daoist Yi Feng until the latter woke up. After all, Daoist Yi Feng was the key to killing Mengyu.

Ye Xuan only had one chance to kill her if she was truly a sealed immortal realm expert. If he failed to grasp it, or she revived, it would all be for naught.

“Junior Brother Ye, if the situation becomes dire, why don’t you head over there and settle it first? If we guard this place, perhaps nothing will happen.”

“When Martial Uncle has regained consciousness, he can go over as well,” an elder said anxiously.

After all, they really needed an expert to suppress the situation at Sky Mountain, and Ye Xuan happened to be the only candidate.

AYe Xuan remained silent as he pondered what to do.

On the other side, the berserk beasts were tirelessly attacking Sky Mountain’s defensive line.

Seeing that the defensive line had already begun to tremble, everyone was becoming more and more anxious, praying that they would be able to hold on until help arrived.

Then suddenly…

The berserk beasts suddenly stopped attacking, and even started to retreat.

Was that the signal for the end of the first wave of attacks?

Rumble…

Everyone’s heartstrings tightened again.

“What’s going to happen now?”

Then, a massive demonic blood beast appeared in the distance. Its entire body reeked of blood and evil.

The moment they saw this demonic blood beast, everyone started to panic.

“Damn it… A supreme realm berserk beast?!”

“Is this for real? Even a powerful demonic blood beast like this can have its mind corroded by that strange power?”

Everyone’s hearts sank. This demonic blood beast was an ancient beast. Logically speaking, beasts that could reach the supreme realm should have developed human-like intelligence. How did the strange power manage to corrode its mind?

Even Gao Shun’s expression turned unusually ugly the moment he saw the demonic blood beast.

The demonic blood beast let out a long howl toward the sky, and the sound shockwaves traveled tens of miles, causing the defensive formation to tremble.

Fortunately, Gao Shun had strengthened it at the critical moment, so they escaped a calamity. However, if it attacked, Gao Shun would not be able to pay attention to the defensive formation.

“This is really bad. Even a supreme realm berserk beast has appeared…”
