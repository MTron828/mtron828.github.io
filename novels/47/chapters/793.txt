After releasing the green light, Ye Xuan looked at Daoist Yi Feng and said, “Martial Uncle Yi, send them into reincarnation now.”

Such a powerful move required a tremendous amount of spiritual power, so he could not support it for too long. Fortunately, he had many pills that recovered spiritual power, so he popped one into his mouth.

“Thanks, Martial Nephew Ye,” Daoist Yi Feng said with a smile. Then, he hurled the Soul Beckoning Banner into the sky and released all of the vengeful spirits inside.

When they first appeared, these vengeful spirits were all very agitated. However, after being illuminated by Ye Xuan’s green light, they gradually calmed down.

Daoist Yi Feng did not waste any time and instantly activated his technique, sending these vengeful spirits into reincarnation, simultaneously earning them both a large amount of merit power.

As they worked together, it did not take long for the two to send more than half of the vengeful spirits into reincarnation.

At this moment, Ye Xuan clearly sensed that the Dao Flower that had fused with the power of merit was emitting waves of light at this moment, which excited him.

If things continued to progress at this rate, his journey to becoming a sealed immortal realm expert would be shortened significantly. In fact, Ye Xuan had to carefully control the influx of merit power he was receiving, lest he accidentally broke through to the sealed immortal realm in advance.

He had to wait for the other two Dao Flowers to reach perfection before advancing to the next realm!

At this moment, the fighting had already stopped. Thanks to Ye Xuan’s green light, even the berserk beasts seemed to be very calm at this moment, and did not attack.

The vengeful spirits that were originally running around were also flying into the reincarnation door into the sky one after another. It seemed that these troublesome vengeful spirits had been dealt with, which made everyone heave a sigh of relief.

However, at this moment, a shocking aura emerged over the horizon!

Sh*t!

Was the situation about to change again?

“It’s actually that great demoness. She’s here again!”

Gao Shun sensed that the situation was not good at this time. Within moments, a frightening red glow filled the sky.

The first one to appear was the huge skeleton.

“Oh no…”

At this moment, this thought appeared in everyone’s minds, and people began to panic.

Seeing this, Ao Lei immediately shouted, “All of you, calm down and be quiet!”

Hearing this, everyone instantly fell silent and no longer dared to speak.

Ao Lei looked at the woman in the sky with hatred.

In that bloody battle back then, as the leader of the disciples, Ao Lei had also participated.

He knew better than anyone else what price the Great Wilderness Divine sect had paid in that battle.

At times, when he closed his eyes, he would recall the scene of his fellow members of the Great Wilderness Divine sect being slaughtered by this witch.

It was precisely because of this that he was filled with hatred towards this demoness, as she was the reason behind the sect’s downfall.

The sect had now recovered, but it had taken a hundred years to do so. At the same time, his personality changed. Ao Lei used to be a bad-tempered and impulsive person, but was now a cautious person, planning meticulously in order to avoid similar disasters.

Seeing her again today, the hatred in his heart was once again ignited.

At this moment, Mengyu landed on the head of the huge skeleton, looking down at everyone.

The corners of her mouth curled up slightly as she said disdainfully, “Haha, are you Ao Lei?”

“Weren’t you quite the impulsive person back then? Why are you holding back now?”

Ao Lei clenched his fists tightly and suppressed away his monstrous hatred. He said calmly, “Hmph! Shouldn’t I be thanking you for that?” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Back then, our Great Wilderness Divine sect mobilized everything we had to kill you, and countless comrades died.”

“Despite this, you are standing here as if nothing has happened.”

“Until now, the vengeful spirits of the fallen members of our sect are still in the desert region. However, just wait and see. You will get your comeuppance!”

After hearing this, Mengyu simply snorted coldly.

Her gaze drifted to the Daoist Yi Feng, and her heart was filled with complicated emotions.

Ao Lei was only a supreme realm cultivator, and was not worthy of her attention. Based on the current situation, her true enemies were Ye Xuan and Daoist Yi Feng.

However, they were still working together to deal with these vengeful spirits, and had no time to deal with her at all.

This was the perfect opportunity.

When he noticed that Mengyu had already set her eyes on Ye Xuan, Ao Lei frowned, feeling very uneasy.

After thinking for a long time, Ao Lei made his decision. He turned around and gave Yuelun some instructions, then winked at Gao Shun…
