480 This Marriage Is Over

“Uncle Tiangang, what do you think?”

Helplessly, Feng Wenyue could only turn to the old man beside him.

The old man’s name was Feng Tiangang. He raised his eyelids slightly and stroked his beard with his hand as he spoke slowly, “It’s not difficult to resolve this matter. You just need to ask about what happened.”

“That’s reasonable.” Feng Wenyue nodded his head in agreement. He then walked over to Bei Xuantian and asked him about what had transpired.

!!

After asking Bei Xuantian, Feng Wenyue turned to Su Changhe to hear his side of the story.

After a while, Feng Wenyue frowned.

There was a huge discrepancy between their stories.

However, Feng Wenyue felt that Su Changhe’s words were more trustworthy and realistic. After all, Bei Xuantian’s story was somewhat vague. He only said that he had unintentionally offended Su Changhe and had not gone into the details.

In contrast, Su Changhe described the entire incident in detail, saying that Bei Xuantian had arrogantly asked him to kneel for simply observing them.

Su Changhe was not a citizen of the Haihan divine empire, so why was there a need to kneel before Bei Xuantian?

His words worsened Feng Wenyue’s impression of Bei Xuantian.

This guy was indeed arrogant. If Xiyun married him, would she really be happy?

There had never been any familial love within the royal family. Only benefits mattered. This much was clear to him. Still, he did not approve of the marriage alliance regardless.

However, he was not the decision-maker in the Yangli divine empire; his father was. Even if he was dissatisfied, he did not dare to show it.

In fact, the reason why Feng Xiyun had been able to escape the royal palace was thanks to his help. He did not want his sister to be used as a tool of the royal family, and had hoped that Feng Xiyun would have the freedom to choose herself.

After understanding what had happened, Feng Wenyue became even more dissatisfied with the marriage alliance with the Haihan divine empire, and especially with Bei Xuantian. Xiyun would definitely not be happy if she married him.

Thinking this, his expression hardened, and he took a few steps back, no longer intending to interfere.

“Crown Prince Wenyue, what do you mean by this?”

Bei Xuantian’s expression changed when he saw Feng Wenyue’s expression.

“Your Highness, Prince Mo Yan, after examining the course of events, it appears that this is a personal grudge between the two of you. As such, it should be resolved by your side.” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Citizens of the Yangli divine empire have always been reasonable. However, if you can’t work it out, you can also fight him.”

“After all, this is a world where only strength matters.”

Feng Wenyue laughed, then took a few steps back to avoid being accidentally caught in the crossfire.

“Hmph! Since the Crown Prince has said so, Su family brat, if you have the guts, come and challenge me!”

Bei Xuantian glared at Su Changhe arrogantly.

However, Su Changhe was not an idiot. He was obviously no match for the other party. Only a fool would accept that invitation!

“Tsk! Do you really think I am afraid of you? Come up here and hit me if you dare!”

“If you’re not a coward, then come over and hit me!”

Bei Xuantian clenched his fists in anger. His facial expression was twisted, and he really wanted to cut this b*stard into pieces.

At the side, Bei Moyan could not help but shoot a meaningful look at Feng Wenyue, his eyes flashing with dissatisfaction.

“Your Highness, we’re here to form a marriage alliance on behalf of the Haihan divine empire!”

“Is this how you treat your guests? In my opinion… The marriage alliance between our two empires is of utmost importance…”

Feng Wenyue shrugged his shoulders indifferently, his face the picture of calmness.

The marriage alliance was only a temporary measure. If the two empires really wanted to go to war, even a marriage alliance would not stop it.

“Father instructed me to welcome you graciously, but he never said that I should clean up your mess.”

“I am the Crown Prince of the Yangli divine empire, and not someone’s minion!”

“Since this is a personal grudge, you should settle it yourself. If you can’t even settle this tiny thing, how can I be at ease in betrothing Xiyun to the Haihan divine empire?”

“You…” Bei Xuantian’s face turned red with anger, and he almost exploded right there and then.

Was Feng Wenyue not questioning the power of the Haihan divine empire with those words?

Bei Moyan’s expression turned cold as well, and he flung his sleeves furiously.

“It seems that Your Highness does not intend to interfere in this matter.”

“Very good! So this is how the Yangli divine empire treats their guests. I’ve finally seen your true colors!”

Hearing this, Feng Wenyue’s expression changed.

As expected, the older the ginger, the spicier it was. He was immediately forced into a passive position.

The atmosphere turned awkward again.

At this moment, a bright light flashed by. The white figure on the peak of the mountain flew through the sky and landed in front of Su Changhe.

When everyone saw this, they looked up in shock, especially Bei Moyan, who was most afraid of Ye Xuan.

Had it not been for Ye Xuan’s presence, he would have killed Su Changhe long ago.

“Senior!”

Su Changhe was relieved to see Ye Xuan and quickly hid behind him.

To be honest, he was really on the verge of panicking just now. He was afraid that Bei Moyan would fly into a rage out of humiliation and slap him to death. Fortunately, the big boss appeared in time. The feeling of having a powerful backer was amazing.

Ye Xuan raised his brows slightly and slowly walked to Bei Xuantian’s side. However, just a slight glance scared Bei Xuantian so much that his body trembled, and his forehead broke out in cold sweat.

“You are… the second prince of the Haihan divine empire?”

Bei Xuantian’s lips trembled as he spoke, “Senior, I am indeed the second prince of the Haihan divine empire. What can I do for you?”

...

Ye Xuan had not thought that he would be able to meet the marriage partner of his precious disciple during this trip to Qingyang City.

However, Ye Xuan was very disappointed.

“I don’t need anything. However, about your marriage alliance… drop it and forget about it,” Ye Xuan said lightly.

The spiritual power in his body spread out quietly, transforming into a net of destructive sword qi that enveloped the two of them. His invisible and terrifying spiritual pressure spread out, causing their hearts to palpitate and their bodies to tremble.

This was the terrifying spiritual pressure of a peak-level mystic lord realm expert!
