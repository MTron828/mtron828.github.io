678 Heart-Questioning (Part 2)

Seeing that Zhuge Yueyue was still unable to give an answer, Gao Shun also started to panic and immediately ran over to Ye Xuan to ask.

“Junior Brother Ye, did you only teach your disciples cultivation and not the Dao?”

The question that had been posed was actually not difficult. Anyone who took cultivation seriously would probably be able to answer it easily.

Therefore, the fact that Zhuge Yueyue was stumped at this moment was a cause for concern. Ye Xuan did not bother answering Gao Shun, and simply kept his eyes glued to the screen, awaiting Zhuge Yueyue’s answer.

What was Dao?

When she heard these words, Zhuge Yueyue was indeed a little stunned, but many answers had already appeared in her heart.

She recalled the times when she was cultivating alone on Cloud Sky peak. Every day, she would go through the same routine unceasingly.

She thought about how she would cultivate diligently every day and reflected on the experience.

At that time, she had just stepped onto the path of cultivation purely to take revenge for her parents. This was her initial goal. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

However, why did she cultivate as hard as she did?

In order to find out the answer to this question, she had even asked her teacher, and what her teacher said was deeply engraved in her mind.

Therefore, Zhuge Yueyue answered without hesitation, “To protect! I want to have the strength to protect those around me and those I care for. To protect the peace and stability of their world. This is my Dao.”

After hearing this, the onlookers revealed looks of surprise.

“I’ve heard many answers to this question, but this is the first time I’ve heard something like this.”

“Cultivating in order to protect?”

“Getting stronger in order to ensure the safety and stability of those around me? Well said!”

No one had expected this answer from her, including those watching from outside the ancient realm.

Who would have thought that Zhuge Yueyue, who always had a cold expression and seemed indifferent to everything, would actually profess this to be her Dao?

It was an ideal worth fighting for!

Even Daoist Canghai and Daoist Xu Yun were shocked. It was not an answer they had expected from someone so young.

Something like this would usually come from an experienced cultivator who had gone through the vicissitudes of life.;

“Little Brother Ye Xuan, this disciple of yours is really amazing. Although she’s still young, her state of mind is boundless. I truly admire her,” Daoist Canghai said emotionally.

Ye Xuan was also rather taken aback at this moment. After all, he had said this to Zhuge Yueyue before, but had not expected her to take it to heart like this.

“Haha, she really makes me proud.”

“She’s truly worth cultivating and nurturing,” Daoist Xu Yun said with a smile. His heart was already filled with envy.

Not only was Ye Xuan extremely powerful, but every single one of his disciples was outstanding.

Was he blessed by the heavens?

At this moment, Daoist Gu Hao’s face turned extremely ugly. In comparison to what he had heard from the other disciples, Zhuge Yueyue’s answer indeed stood out.

Most people answered that they wanted to become stronger for themselves, not to protect others.

“Damn it!”

Having been made a fool of repeatedly, he could barely contain his anger. There was nothing to nitpick about her answer at all.

It really seemed like nothing had gone right today. At the thought of this, Daoist Gu Hao began to regret it. If he had not fallen out with Ye Xuan in the beginning, the Supreme Divine sect would not be in this current predicament.

However, hindsight was 20/20, and regretting things now would not be able to change the past. His stubbornness had gotten them into hot soup.

Now, their only hope was Xie Tianyu. If he did well in the gathering, they would be able to recover some measure of dignity. If he did not…

Well, Daoist Gu Hao did not want to think about that outcome.

After hearing Zhuge Yueyue’s answer, the sage-like old man muttered to himself, “To protect… Obtaining strength in order to protect…”

“The Dao of Protection? Good! That’s great!”

After thinking for a moment, the old man burst into laughter. Then, he released a golden beam of light that shot into Zhuge Yueyue’s body.

This golden beam of light contained a large amount of fate energy; far more than had been awarded to anyone who had answered this question before this.
