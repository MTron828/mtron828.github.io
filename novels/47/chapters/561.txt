“Ye Xuan has also reached the supreme realm!”

After sensing Ye Xuan’s aura, the crowd was shocked. The chief of Cloud Sky peak had broken through so quickly!

“Teacher has actually become a supreme realm expert?”

Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun were both shocked and overjoyed. To them, their teacher would always be the strongest cultivator and their pillar of support.

Even Yi Feng was shocked and found it hard to imagine.

At this moment, Ye Xuan was already in the sky, flying toward Elder Taiyin. He stared at him with eyes full of killing intent and said, “It seems that you are in a hurry to die!”

Elder Taiyin trembled subconsciously. After all, he had lost to Ye Xuan twice. It would be a lie if he said that he was not afraid.

All of a sudden, Elder Taiyin screamed hysterically as his mind was completely corroded by that strange power.

“Hahaha! Ye Xuan, since you’re here, let’s settle our grudges!”

Thanks to the corrosion, the only thing that filled his mind was the desire to kill and cause destruction. The word ‘fear’ no longer existed in his dictionary.

Ye Xuan was still very calm, and he said in an unusually cold voice, “Alright, then. Get ready to die!”

As soon as he said this, Ye Xuan unleashed a palm strike using the Boundless Palm technique. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Elder Taiyin also responded with his own attack, which blocked Ye Xuan’s palm strike. Then, they collided again and again.

It was undeniable that Elder Taiyin’s combat strength had increased significantly after he had reached the supreme realm. Moreover, with the augmentation of that strange power, he was stronger than the average supreme realm expert at the same level.

However, so what? Ye Xuan was an existence who could easily kill an advanced-stage supreme realm expert!powerhouse!

At this moment, the fight between the two of them had leveled mountains and uprooted forests.

“I never imagined that a battle between supreme realm experts would be so intense. This is truly eye-opening!”

The onlookers were all shocked.

At this moment, Ao Lei was also watching this battle coldly. After some time, he turned his gaze to the Immortal Divine sect’s cultivators.

He stretched out his hand and pointed his finger at them while saying coldly, “From this day on, the Immortal Divine sect will cease to exist!”

After hearing this, the forces of the Great Wilderness Divine sect took action and surrounded their enemies.

No matter how hard they tried, the Immortal Divine sect cultivators failed to break through the encirclement. From the way things were looking, the situation was bleak.

Ao Lei’s personality was like this. The moment he made a move, it would be decisive and awe-inspiring. He chose to be ruthless to avoid any future problems for the sect in the future.

After receiving Ao Lei’s order, the forces of the Great Wilderness Divine sect all revealed fierce expressions.

Li Dahai even laughed out loud and said, “Aha! The tables have turned now. You idiots can just sit tight and wait for us to lop your heads off!”

After enduring for such a long time, everyone was anxious to exact revenge and immediately attacked. Within a short period of time, the Immortal Divine sect had already suffered heavy casualties.

However, just when Mo Xuan Guan was about to risk his life to try and escape, streaks of light flashed over from a distance.

Noticing this scene, everyone looked in that direction, and soon discovered that the Immortal Divine sect’s reinforcements had also arrived.

“Haha, this show is getting more and more exciting.”

The onlookers were watching in excitement. In any case, this matter had nothing to do with them, so they just had to avoid being caught in the crossfire and enjoy the show.

Mo Xuan Guan was overjoyed. There was hope!

Among the reinforcements, there was a frail-looking old man in a black robe who glared at Yi Feng and said, “Yi Feng, are you looking down on the Immortal Divine sect? How dare you kill our sect members!”

This old man was also the former grand elder of the Immortal Divine sect, and was a supreme realm expert from the same era as Yi Feng.

Yi Feng replied in disdain, “Mo Gen, it was your sect members that picked a fight today, yet you dare to chastise me? You truly are a shameless bunch!”

“But you’ve come at the right time. I haven’t stretched my body in a long time, so I’ll play with you today.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yi Feng immediately launched an attack.

Upon seeing this, Mo Gen’s face instantly darkened. He had originally only wanted to argue with Yi Feng, but who would have thought that Yi Feng would attack without hesitation?

It seemed that the battle today was inevitable.

At this moment, the battle between the two sects was reignited, causing massive spiritual fluctuations in the surroundings.

The most eye-catching battle was still on Ye Xuan’s side, as they kept exchanging blows without so much as a breather.

Ye Xuan hovered silently in the air, staring at Elder Taiyin with a cold expression. He now had a good grasp of Elder Taiyin’s strength, which had increased significantly in comparison to back then thanks to his breakthrough and the strange power.

However, it was not to the extent where he would be defeated. Ye Xuan curled his finger at Elder Taiyin with a calm face and said with a mocking smile, “Is that it? Got anything else to show me?”

Hearing this, the anger inside Elder Taiyin’s heart boiled over.

“You’ll regret your current arrogance! I’ll make sure you pay!”

Ye Xuan simply curled his lips in disdain as a response.
