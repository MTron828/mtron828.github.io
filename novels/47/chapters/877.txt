878 Ao Lei’s Passing

If it was not for his willpower, he would not have been able to last till today. However, when his life force was completely exhausted, he would welcome death. If he wanted to continue living, he would have to break through to the ancient realm, but that was easier said than done.

He had tried his best to break through using the opportunity Ye Xuan had given the sect, but had fallen short. Now that the dense power in the sky had faded, so had his chances of breaking through. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

At this moment, Ao Lei’s life force began to fade, and he could not muster any strength within his body. He could barely keep his eyes open. Although his heart was filled with regret, his wish had almost been fulfilled.

He had witnessed the rise of the sect, as well as his talented junior brother. The sect would be in safe hands. As such, the will to live that he had been holding onto for so long began to dissipate.

“Martial Uncle Ao? Did something happen? What’s going on?”

Hua Rufeng sensed something amiss about Ao Lei and quickly moved to his side. Hearing this, Ao Lei tried his best to open his eyes, as he rubbed Hua Rufeng’s head with his wrinkled hands.

He smiled and said, “Rufeng, I… I’m afraid I can’t hold on any longer. From now on, you will be in charge of the Great Wilderness Divine sect. You must help me protect it.”

It seemed that he had used up all his strength to say this. Ao Lei then closed his eyes and lowered his head. This sudden scene stunned Hua Rufeng, and stood foolishly there, filled with grief and panic.

While the crowd was still immersed in the joy of Gao Shun and Yuelun’s breakthroughs when they suddenly heard a pained roar in the distance…

“Martial Uncle Ao!”

“No! Senior Brother Ao!” Gao Shun immediately understood what had happened and shouted hysterically. All of his excitement from his breakthrough disappeared without a trace, and it felt as if he had been plunged into the icy pits of despair.

No one had expected that Ao Lei would pass away just as the Great Wilderness Divine sect was about to welcome a period of improvement and glory.

This could not be and should not be happening!

“This can’t be true! This can’t be true!”

“Wasn’t Senior Brother Ao in good health? Why is this happening to him now?”

Yuelun’s eyes were filled with tears. She could not believe or accept what had happened. The fact that Ole had suddenly passed away was truly too hard to accept.

Once Ao Lei determined that the sect would survive without him, and that his wish had been fulfilled, he relaxed his heart, and accepted his fate. As a result, his life force quickly flowed away, and he welcomed death. In truth, Ao Lei had been hiding this matter all along, which was why people had only discovered it now.

Everyone’s hearts were filled with sadness, and many of them had already shed tears. This was especially true for the elders, who had been led and protected by Ao Lei all this while. Gao Shun was practically beside himself with grief as well.

Back in his youth, when he had traveled out to gain experience, he was suppressed by the other forces and sects, and it was Ao Lei who rescued him and helped him exact revenge.

Over the years, he had grown to admire Ao Lei and almost considered the latter to be his mentor and father figure.

At this moment, Cloud Sky peak was engulfed in an atmosphere and sadness. The mood was unprecedentedly low, and they let out silent sobs. Gao Shun, on the other hand, went over to Ao Lei and tried to shake him awake, but was stopped by Lu Xiu.

“Senior Brother Gao, don’t be too impulsive. Senior Brother Ao has already passed away. Don’t you want him to leave in peace?”

“You’re spouting nonsense! He’s not dead!” Gao Shun pushed Lu Xiu away. He did not want to believe this at all.

Then, just as everyone lost hope, Gao Shun suddenly thought of someone. “How could I forget about him?”

His sudden question puzzled everyone. Seeing Gao Shun in this crazed state, no one knew what to do or expect.

Then, out of the blue, Gao Shun shouted, “Junior Brother Ye! Junior Brother Ye will definitely be able to save Senior Brother Ao!”

Everyone suddenly came to a realization.

“That’s right! How could we forget about him?”

“At that time, Martial Uncle Gao was already dead, but he was brought back to life by a medicinal pill from Martial Uncle Ye.”

After hearing Gao Sheng’s words, everyone immediately thought of Ye Xuan. If Ye Xuan was here, would he be able to save Ao Lei? Everyone felt that there was hope amidst the darkness.

At this moment, Hua Rufeng rushed to Feng Xiyun’s side like a madman and shouted, “Junior Sister Feng, tell me quickly! Where is Martial Uncle Ye now?”

At this moment, no one knew where Ye Xuan had taken Zhuge Yueyue. They only knew that after providing them with the opportunity, he had brought Zhuge Yueyue away. Seeing Hua Rufeng’s bloodshot eyes, Feng Xiyun’s heart trembled as she anxiously replied, “Teacher should have brought First Sister to Cloud Sky Cave to cultivate.”

“Cloud Sky Cave!”

After saying this, Hua Rufeng immediately picked up Ao Lei’s corpse and rushed toward Cloud Sky Cave. He did not want to waste even a second. Seeing Hua Rufeng’s reckless behavior, Gao Shun hurriedly followed.

Yuelune said after looking around, “Senior Brother Lu, take care of this place first. I’ll follow and take a look.”

“Alright.”

Lu Xiu agreed without hesitation. Although he wanted to go over, the situation was very chaotic, so someone had to stay here.
