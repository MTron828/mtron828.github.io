517 Chiliad Gold Vine Seedling

Yuelun had just reached the mystic lord realm not long ago. If she cultivated in this cave, she would undoubtedly make great progress.

However, compared to the many treasures in the ancient tomb, the value of continuing to cultivate here was insignificant.

“It’s better not to. There are many treasures here, so it’s better to spend more time outside to seize them.”

“When I came in looking for you, I saw Elder Tongtian, Chu Tianba and Elder Taiyin fighting over a divine fruit.”

After hearing these words, Ye Xuan was stunned.

“Elder Taiyin has also entered the ancient tomb? Hehe…”

At this moment, Ye Xuan chuckled and leaned close to Yuelun’s ear again and said, “Sister Yuelun, do you want that divine fruit? If you want, I can help you snatch it.”

Hearing this, Yuelun felt a little excited. Was this Ye Xuan’s way of confessing his feelings for her?

This was the first time he had offered to give her something.

However, after thinking about it seriously for a moment, Yuelun waved her hand and said, “Let’s forget about it. That divine fruit is not very useful to me, so there’s no need for you to waste your energy on it.”

“For me, this is a small matter that doesn’t require much effort.” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Ye Xuan’s expression was arrogant as he said that, and then he immediately continued, “Besides, I have a lot of energy. You don’t have to worry about me wasting a little bit of it for this matter.”

Yuelun was momentarily stunned after hearing these words, but then said in a very serious manner, “You have to use your strength in the right place, understand?”

“The right place? Oh, I understand what you’re saying.”

Ye Xuan scanned Senior Sister Yuelun from head to toe and said, “That’s fine too. I’ll heed Sister Yuelun’s orders. My strength must indeed be used at the right place, hehe.”

Hearing this, Yuelun felt suspicious. Why did she feel that Ye Xuan’s words had a different meaning?

However, she did not take it to heart. Instead, she followed Ye Xuan as he walked further into the cave.

“Sister Yuelun, this cave is filled with extremely dense spiritual energy. I originally thought that it was caused by this divine spring.”

“But when I absorbed all of the spiritual energy in the spring, I realized that the spiritual energy did not come from the spring.”

“As such, there must be other treasures in this cave.”

Hearing this, Yuelun also expressed her agreement and followed Ye Xuan.

All of a sudden, a cold gleam of light flashed past.

“Be careful! Dodge!”

In an instant, a few cold gleams of light shot out from a hole, scaring Yuelun. She immediately mobilized her spiritual power to block the attack.

Then, unexpectedly, Ye Xuan casually waved his palm a few times and blocked all of the attacks.

Yuelun could clearly sense the supreme power emanating from Ye Xuan’s body, and her pupils suddenly shrank.

“Oh my god!”

Could it be that Ye Xuan had already reached the supreme realm?

Even though the amount of strength that Ye Xan had just used was still within the boundaries of the mystic lord realm, the pressure she sensed felt like supreme power.

At this moment, Yuelun noticed that there seemed to be a special aura around Ye Xuan’s body, which was mysterious and unfathomable.

To be able to achieve such a level, there was no doubt that Ye Xuan had reached the supreme realm, and had even tempered his body!

Yuelun’s shock was indescribable.

It had only been a few days, yet in this time Ye Xuan had advanced again?

There had not been a supreme realm expert in the Great Wilderness Divine sect since Chief Tian Xuan’s passing.

After Ye Xuan reached this realm, his status was no longer comparable to the past.

In the East continent, no matter who it was, if they met a supreme realm expert, they would all kneel down to show respect. Even royalty would do so.

“Sister Yuelun, what’s wrong with you?”

After Ye Xuan finished dealing with those attacks, he noticed Yuelun’s condition. She was in a daze and did not move, so he enquired out of concern.

After hearing Ye Xuan’s question, Yuelun finally came back to his senses, but did not probe the matter.

“Uh… It’s nothing. Let’s continue.”

“Alright, this place hides a certain level of danger, so follow me closely.”

“Let’s go!”

Ye Xuan then confidently went deeper into the cave.

When Yuelun heard this, she felt comforted by his concern.

It always seemed that only his two disciples had ever felt the tenderness and concern from Ye Xuan. No one else had ever had the chance to do so.

It felt good to be included in that circle now.

As the two of them went deeper in, they arrived in front of another cave.

There was a black spider with poisonous barbs in front of the cave.

The spider seemed to be very angry at the two’s arrival. It was already secretly accumulating power and preparing to attack.

This spider had reached the peak of the mystic lord realm. It had been the one who had attacked them previously.

“It’s actually a dark spider!”

Upon seeing this huge spider, Yuelun’s face instantly turned pale as she mobilized all of the spiritual power in her body.

When she turned to look at Ye Xuan, she found that he did not look surprised at all.

Instead, he was staring at a plant underneath the dark spider.

...

“Could this plant be a chiliad gold vine’s seedling?”

Ye Xuan was stunned. He did not expect the dark spider to be guarding a chiliad gold vine’s seedling.

When Yuelun followed his gaze and saw it, she was taken aback.

The chiliad gold vine was a heavenly treasure, and its existence could even be compared to some divine fruits.

“Hehe, this is great. The god of luck is really shining upon us. We actually managed to find a chiliad gold vine’s seedling in this place,” Ye Xuan said with a smile.
