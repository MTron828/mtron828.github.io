348 A Saint King Realm Expert Takes Action

Clang!

At that moment, an ancient aura suddenly appeared, and an ancient bronze bell enveloped Shangguan Wan’er, blocking the golden spear.

The two powerful forces clashed, and the shockwaves injured the surrounding cultivators.

“You’ve crossed the line!”

A cold voice suddenly rang out, and a white-haired old man suddenly appeared.

“Ancestor!”

Jun Lingtian’s eyes lit up.

This white-haired elder was the ancestor of the Divine Gate Holy Land, Jun Xuantian.

Jun Xuantian’s gaze fell on the flood dragon.

The flood dragon emerged from the spatial crack and appeared in the sky.

“A Heavenly King realm expert!”

Everyone’s expression changed when they saw this.

With their cultivation levels, they were naturally unable to detect Jun Xuantian’s and the flood dragon’s cultivation levels.

However, they knew that Jun Xuantian was a Heavenly King realm expert, therefore, someone who could face him head-on and not be at a disadvantage was naturally equally as strong.

“Hmph! It’s you humans who broke the rules!”

The eyes of the flood dragon were filled with monstrous killing intent.

“First, Ye Xuan killed our King realm experts. Now, someone from your human race has disguised their cultivation level and attacked our cultivators below the King realm!”

“Jun Xuantian, do you really think I wouldn’t make a move? ”

Earlier, a sea race Saint King realm had given the order to kill all cultivators below the King realm in the Huangyu Zone.

By doing so, he hoped to occupy the Huangyu Zone sooner, but he also hoped to draw Ye Xuan out.

Therefore, the sea race had sent many lightning tribulation realm experts to hide in the spatial turbulence. At the right moment, they would emerge and kill all the human experts.

Hopefully, that would get Ye Xuan to make an appearance.

As long as Ye Xuan made the slightest move, the Saint King realm expert hidden in the spatial turbulence would strike as fast as lightning and kill Ye Xuan.

However, what they did not expect was that someone else would suddenly appear.

They could sense that Shangguan Wan’er’s cultivation level had reached the King realm. However, she was no weaker than a Human King realm expert.

In order to test the waters, a Heavenly King realm expert had personally taken action.

As such, in the eyes of the sea race experts, Shangguan Wan’er must have used some sort of secret technique to hide her true strength, disguising herself to participate in the war between the two races.

However, what puzzled the Heavenly King realm flood dragon was that even he could not tell what sort of secret technique that Shangguan Wan’er was using.

“I’ve always been frank and honest. Why would I need to disguise myself?”

“You might think that you’re powerful, but you’re nothing but an ant in my eyes,” Shangguan Wan’er said indifferently.

“During this war, it’s already been agreed that King realm cultivators can’t interfere in the war!”

“Now that you humans have broken the rules again, I won’t tolerate it!” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The eyes of the flood dragon were filled with monstrous killing intent.

Regardless of whether Shangguan Wan’er had hidden her strength, or whether she was really only a pattern condensation realm cultivator, she had indeed engraved the heavenly lightning profound pattern.

As such, he could not allow her to live, lest she cause a calamity for the sea race in the future.

The Heavenly King realm flood dragon took a step forward and disappeared.

Moments later, a huge hole appeared in the sky. His huge golden spear stabbed toward Shangguan Wan’er with destructive power.

Clang!

Jun Xuantian snorted coldly and waved his sleeves.

The ancient bronze bell collided with the golden spear.

Clang! Clang! Clang!

The two terrifying forces collided with each other, and the sound of their collisions resounded in the sky.

Seconds later, the two of them tore space apart and began a crazy battle in the depths of the spatial turbulence.

Boom!

At that moment, a huge palm appeared in the sky and tried to smack Shangguan Wan’er, following which, a saber strike split the sky and shattered the palm.

“If the sea race wants to break the rules, then be prepared for the consequences!”

The voice of a human expert suddenly rang out.

“Hmph! It’s you humans who broke the rules first, so why are you trying to push the responsibility on us?”

Then, a vast spiritual pressure suddenly descended.

Everyone could feel an invisible force as heavy as a mountain weighing down on them.

“A Saint King realm expert!”

Jun Lingtian’s expression changed drastically.

It was obvious that this Saint King realm expert from the sea race wanted to kill Shangguan Wan’er.

“Hmph! Shangguan Wan’er is Ye Xuan’s disciple. Do you really want to offend Ye Xuan?”

At the same time, a mighty voice suddenly rang out.

“It’s Master!”

Jun Lingtian’s expression turned grave.

The person confronting the sea race Saint King realm expert was the master of the Divine Gate Holy Land.
