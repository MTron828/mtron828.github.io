357 A Useless Teacher And A Useless Disciple

“Junior Brothers, what do you think?”

At this moment, Gongsun Shouyue’s gaze fell on the other chiefs.

Gongsun Shouyue’s meaning was self-evident. It was now time for the chiefs to choose their disciples.

Those who were talented might be able to become a disciple of a chief, while those who were not would probably end up as servant disciples, tasked with cleaning the sect.

!!

Of course, before Zhuge Yueyue and the others came in, Hua Rufeng had already made things clear to them.

Because of this, they did not harbor much hope in becoming the disciples of any of the chiefs.

“Hahaha! Since Senior Brother Gongsun, then Junior Brother will naturally have to go first!”

Gao Shun walked out very quickly, his eyes sparkling as he looked at that youth who spoke just now.

Seeing Gao Shun make his move, Liang Dahai, the Hidden Spirit peak’s chiefs, could no longer restrain himself.

Liang Dahai dragged his bloated body and hurriedly walked out as well. Before Gao Shun could open his mouth to continue, he said, “Senior Brother Gongsun, I feel that this young man has an affinity with my Hidden Spirit peak. I think it’s best that he comes under my wing.”

The rest of the chiefs did not buy it at all.

This damn fatty had always been like this when he took in disciples.

Did he really think that they were fools?

“Junior Brother Liang, it’s first come, first served. I spotted this young man first,” Gao Shun said with some dissatisfaction.

“So what if you’ve taken a fancy to him first? Is everything you lay your eyes on yours? What kind of twisted logic is this?”

“What’s wrong? You’re not convinced? Do you want to fight?”

“Fine, I’ll fight you. Do you think I’m afraid of you?” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Gao Shun had a bad temper and could not hold it in any longer.

In the entire Great Wilderness Divine sect, other than Gongsun Shouyue and the Tian Xuan, he did not fear anyone.

If Gongsun Shouyue had not intervened in time, the two might have really fought.

Among the chiefs, Gao Shun and Liang Dahai were indeed the strongest.

The other chiefs knew that they would not be able to compete with these two, so they could only choose among the remaining survivors.

Although their levels of talent were comparatively worse, it was better than nothing.

After the selection, there were still a few youths with mediocre levels of talent who were not selected. They stood alone in the hall.

This included Zhuge Yueyue.

Zhuge Yueyue felt very unwilling. Was her level of talent really that bad? Why was there not a single person willing to choose her?

If she could not embark on the path of cultivation, how was she going to avenge her parents?

Just as she was about to give in to despair, an indescribably handsome man in white suddenly appeared in front of her.

At that moment, Zhuge Yueyue seemed to see a ray of light in the darkness, illuminating her entire world.

Zhuge Yueyue immediately raised her head to look at the young man.

It was the young man who sat at the edge of the various chiefs.

“You, what’s your name?” Ye Xuan asked gently.

“Zhuge Yueyue,” Zhuge Yueyue said uneasily.

“Yueyue, huh,” Ye Xuan muttered to himself.

Looking at this girl, Ye Xuan could not help but think of Yue, who had been left behind on the Tianyuan continent.

The two girls’ traumatic experiences were quite similar, and they even had the word ‘Yue’ in their names.

‘Forget it! Since it’s fate, I’ll accept it!’

“Little girl, are you willing to become my disciple?” Ye Xuan asked softly.

“I’m willing! Zhuge Yueyue greets Teacher!”

When Zhuge Yueyue heard this, she knelt down without any hesitation. Her eyes filled with excitement.

In her moment of despair, it was Ye Xuan’s appearance that brought her hope for a new life.

As long as she could become a proper disciple, she would be able to embark on the path of cultivation, and avenge her parents in the future.

Although her teacher looked extremely young, to be able to become a chief of the sect, he had to be a powerful cultivator.

“Mm! Since you’ve entered my tutelage, you can follow me!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan left the hall with his hands behind his back and an indifferent expression.

Zhuge Yueyue saw this and quickly followed. Just as she was about to leave the hall, she heard a mocking voice.

“Hehe! What a joke, a useless teacher and a useless disciple, what a great pair!”

“What the predecessors said is indeed true. Birds of a feather really flock together!”

“The Cloud Sky peak is Martial Uncle Tian Xuan’s legacy. I’m afraid it’s going to be destroyed in the hands of Ye Xuan, this piece of trash!”

When Zhuge Yueyue heard this, she was puzzled.

Just then, Ye Xuan suddenly stopped in his tracks and looked at Zhuge Yueyue.

“Teacher? What’s wrong?” Zhuge Yueyue asked subconsciously when she noticed that Ye Xuan had suddenly stopped.

“Little girl, I’m sure you’ve heard what they said just now? What are your thoughts?”

When Zhuge Yueyue heard this, she was confused and angry at the same time.

Even though he was the chief of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, what right did Gao Shun have to insult her teacher?

No matter what Ye Xuan’s strength was, he was still her teacher, an existence that brought hope to her when she was in despair.

It was fine for others to insult her, but she would never allow anyone to insult her teacher.

“Teacher, even though I’ve only just become your disciple, I live by the saying that a teacher for a day is a father for life! It was Teacher who brought me hope amidst my despair.”

“No matter how difficult and dangerous the future is, Yueyue will stand by Teacher’s side for the rest of my life. I won’t embarrass you, Teacher!”

“Teacher, I’ll definitely work hard and prove myself with my strength. I’ll show them just who is trash!”

Zhuge Yueyue’s eyes were filled with determination.

Hearing this, Ye Xuan displayed a gratified smile.

As expected of the disciple that I took a fancy to.

Just now, in the meeting hall, Ye Xuan knew that with his current strength, he would definitely not be able to compete with the other chiefs for those talented cultivators.

However, with the awesome system, his disciple’s level of talent was not particularly important.

As such, he focused on those who were not selected, and were definitely in the pits of despair. His appearance would become their saving grace, and would guarantee their loyalty.
