Chapter 175: The Trials Commence

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The master of the Divine Gate was extremely powerful. It was said that he had already surpassed the unity realm.

However, even such a monstrous existence was unable to obtain a brilliant result in the Tower of Heaven’s two rankings.

The cultivator who had previously spoken arrogantly immediately flushed red. His expression was filled with shame.

Boom!

Just as everyone was heatedly discussing amongst themselves, the Tower of Heaven shook. Following that, mysterious spatial fluctuations surged forth and landed on every cultivator.

“It’s the age test!”

“Finally, it’s going to start!”

Many experienced and knowledgeable cultivators were excited.

At the same time, Ye Xuan also felt a strange power land on his body, seemingly examining it. The strange power then disappeared after two minutes.

Then, a special jade token appeared in front of each cultivator.

After crushing it, one could enter the Tower of Heaven to challenge the trials.

Only cultivators under the age of 50 received this jade token, and each cultivator’s jade token was different, containing the unique aura of its owner.

This prevented cultivators over the age of 50 from using a loophole to enter the Tower of Heaven.

“This jade token…”

Ye Xuan looked at the jade token in front of him and narrowed his eyes. He actually felt extremely mysterious energy fluctuations from this jade token.

“This actually contains spatial intent!”

Ye Xuan’s eyes immediately lit up.

If he had not comprehended the Heavenly Lightning intent before, he really would not have noticed the weak spatial intent contained in this jade token.

Spatial intent, like the Heavenly Lightning intent, was also one of the top ten supreme intents!

“I’m becoming more and more curious. Who was it that refined this Tower of Heaven?”

Ye Xuan took a long look at the Tower of Heaven. Anyone able to comprehend a supreme intent was definitely an expert.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

As soon as everyone received the jade tokens, many people immediately crushed them. Then, the jade tokens emitted mysterious spatial energy that wrapped around them and teleported them into the Tower of Heaven.

Soon, the originally immense crowd of cultivators was reduced by more than half.

At the same time, those who had yet to enter the Tower of Heaven immediately saw a huge screen of light suddenly appear in the sky.

The screen of light was filled with the names of countless cultivators.

This was the real-time ranking of the participating cultivators.

Of course, this ranking did not correlate to the two lists. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

When the huge screen of light appeared, countless specks of light suddenly appeared on the Tower of Heaven. Each flashing speck of light represented a cultivator.

At the beginning, all of the specks of light gathered on the first level of Tower of Heaven. Soon, many of these specks of light arrived at the second level, and then even the third level…

As time slowly passed, the distance between the cultivators gradually widened. Within just a brief period of time, the frontrunners had reached the 20th level.

Swoosh!

At the same time, there were also many cultivators who did not pass the trials of the Tower of Heaven and were directly teleported out.

Those failed cultivators’ faces were pale, and the auras around their bodies had become erratic. Clearly, the trials of the Tower of Heaven were worthy of being called trials.

Cultivators entered the Tower of Heaven by crushing their jade tokens. However, once inside, they would receive an additional jade token that had a life-saving function.

If they could not pass the trial of the Tower of Heaven, or when they were in mortal danger, they could crush the jade token, and the Tower of Heaven would teleport them back to the War God Hall instantly.

“I… I was defeated on the first floor…”

A second-level of the qi transformation realm cultivator said with a face full of shame.

He originally thought that he could pass more than ten floors or something, but he didn’t expect that he couldn’t even pass the simplest trial of the first floor. Moreover, if he hadn’t crushed the jade token in time, he would have died in the trial of the Heavenly Divine Tower.

“I was defeated on the tenth floor…”

“I did not expect the enemy on the thirteenth floor to be so terrifying. I could not hold on…”

“Sigh! I thought that with my fifth level true origin realm strength, I would be able to clear at least twenty floors or something, but I did not expect that I would not even be able to hold on to the fourteenth floor…”

“In the Tower of Babel, every five floors apart will increase the difficulty, and every ten floors apart, the difficulty will be even more terrifying!”

..

While everyone was discussing, Ye Xuan was still stabilizing his cultivation foundation.

Right now, the most crucial thing was to improve his control of his own strength so that he could increase his chances of passing the trials of the Tower of Heaven.

Most experts made the same choice as Ye Xuan and did not immediately enter the Tower of Heaven.

Only after most of the low-level cultivators failed did some experts choose to enter the Tower of Heaven.

The cultivator at the tenth level purple spirit realm also crushed his jade token at this moment.

After everything that had happened just now, he had already realizedthe difficulty of entering the rankings. However, he still wanted to give it a try and see if he could break through to the 40th level.

Due to Gongsun Yao’s previous words and behavior, many people had already taken note of that cultivator.

To have reached the tenth level of the purple spirit realm at the age of 22, although he could not be compared to top-notch geniuses like Gongsun Yao, his talent and aptitude surpassed most cultivators.

“This guy’s speed is so fast!”

“He’s already reached the tenth level!”

“Good God, this guy has already reached the seventeenth level!”

“This guy isn’t bad! A tenth-level purple spirit realm cultivator is indeed someone not to be trifled with!”

“Will this guy really reach the fortieth level?”

Everyone exclaimed in admiration when they saw the speed at which that cultivator progressed.

Not far away, Jian Tiannan saw this scene and a cold smile hung on the corners of his mouth.

This was only the beginning! Once one reached the thirtieth leve, the difficulty of the trials would undergo a qualitative change.

When Gongsun Yao saw this, her eyes were also filled with disdain.

How long could a weakling from an ordinary empire last? From her estimation, not much further than the thirtieth level.

As expected, when the cultivator arrived at the 30th floor, his speed suddenly slowed down.

From initially soaring through a level in a few seconds, to now taking over ten minutes for a single floor.

After about half an hour, the cultivator successfully passed the 30th floor.

Time slowly passed, and the cultivator eventually reached the 35th floor.
