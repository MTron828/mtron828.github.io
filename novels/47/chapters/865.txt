866 A New Peerless Genius

After a system notification ended, Ye Xuan’s body suddenly underwent such a huge change. A primitive power filled his entire body and transformed it, engulfing it in immortal qi.

Heavens!

The Chaos Sacred Body?!

This was one of the most powerful physiques in history. Throughout history, those who possessed the Sacred Body of Chaos had become overlords of their regions. It could even be said that they were invincible.

He could truly feel that after obtaining the Chaos Sacred Body, his cultivation speed had become much faster, and his comprehension ability had been greatly improved. When he studied the Heaven Burning Flames technique again, it was easier to grasp.

“Hiss…”

After sucking in a breath of cold air, Ye Xuan’s eyes became much more solemn. Even Ye Xuan himself had not expected this outcome. Furthermore, with 4 chances to complete cultivation techniques in hand, if he went to the Heavenly Dao World and obtained new incomplete techniques, he would be able to add them to his arsenal of immortal-grade cultivation techniques.

“Chaos Sacred Body… With such great potential, if others with ill intentions notice this, there might be some danger…”

After pondering for a moment, Xuan also placed a layer of seal on his body to prevent the chaos aura from leaking out. After settling this, Ye Xuan felt much more relieved.

Although he could not rely on this seal to hide it from everyone, at the very least, it would be sufficient to conceal it from most people.

Then, another system notification rang out.

“Ding! Congratulations! The host has received a 1,000x critical reward, and has obtained the corresponding amount of spiritual power!”

Eh? 1,000x? This critical multiplier was not bad.

However, he did not have much use for it. At his level, in order to break through, he needed to comprehend and perfect different Daos. However, it would be a waste not to take it…

Suddenly, an idea flashed through his mind.

What if he gave this power to the disciples of the Great Wilderness Divine sect? After all, the Heavenly Stairway was about to commence, and this would give them a leg up on the other continents. When the cultivators of the other continents discovered this, how jealous would they be? Thinking this, he smiled.

“Hahaha, this is going to be interesting. I’m really curious. What kind of expression will they have when the time comes?”

He was about to take action when…

Boom!

Accompanied by a huge explosion, a red beam of light landed on the top of Cloud Sky peak, releasing brilliant flames. At the center of these flames was a figure in a red dress, whose majestic aura caused everyone who laid eyes upon her to become dazzled.

“Oh my god, hurry up and look over there. What’s going on?”

Everyone turned their gazes over and looked at the figure in the sky at the same time.

When the red light gradually dissipated, Zhuge Yueyue immediately exclaimed in surprise, “Ah! Second Sister!”

When everyone heard this, they were stunned. That was Feng Xiyun?

Ao Lei was also taken aback.

“Is that the Immortal Sacred Body? Oh my god, our Great Wilderness Divine sect has produced another top genius. The future of the sect is limitless!”

The crowd immediately became restless after hearing this. After Xiang Yun, another genius of the same level had emerged? How had this happened?

She was the first person in history to evolve a divine bone into an immortal bone, which resulted in her body undergoing an earth-shattering transformation.

Many people did not understand what was going on at the Cloud Sky peak, but they did know that a new peerless genius had emerged. At the same time, the other continents also began to pay attention to the phenomenon in the East continent, having already sensed that another top genius had been born. The forces of the other continents could not help but feel the pressure on them grow stronger. They did not want to be left behind!
