Then, as everyone watched in amazement, he used his spiritual power to force out the fate energy he had received from the ancient realm and split it equally between Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun.

“Teacher…”

“Why are you doing this?”

After receiving the first bit of fate energy, Zhuge Yueyue instantly understood what was going on.

Fate energy was extremely precious, and was something that countless cultivators yearned for, as it would improve their luck and karma.

Even Daoist Canghai and Daoist Xuyun, as well as the other experts from the older generation, had come here just for the chance to obtain it.

However, this guy was giving it away!

Seeing this, everyone’s eyes widened in shock.

“Heavens! Is Sword Immortal Ye doing what I think he is doing? Are his disciples worth that much to him?”

After a short moment, Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun had both been infused with the fate energy. However, the two of them were very resistant to what was going on. They did not want their teacher to transfer the fate energy to them.

However, they were helpless because Ye Xuan spiritual power rendered them immobile and unable to do anything. They could only watch helplessly as the fate energy was infused into their bodies.

If they had known that Ye Xuan was actually going to do this, they would definitely have not accepted it. After all, they knew how precious fate energy was, and that it was useful to their teacher.

How could they accept it?

At this moment, Zhuge Yueyue could clearly sense that something inside her had changed, and her affinity with the world around her had increased.

Zhuge Yueyue said in a trembling voice, “Teacher…”

Noticing that she was about to cry again, Ye Xuan immediately comforted her, “Alright, alright. I know what you want to say. There’s no need to say anymore.”

“I’ve definitely considered all these things. As your teacher, I just want to help you as much as I can. In this way, you will be able to compete with the other peerless geniuses. ”

“I hope that this fate energy will be of some help to you. Your future path is dependent on your own efforts and choices. Remember that.”

Hearing this, Feng Xiyun and Zhuge Yueyue could not help but burst into tears. Their teacher had been taking care of them ever since they had joined the sect, and had sacrificed so much for them.

How were they supposed to repay him in the future?

After pondering for a moment, Zhuge Yueyue said in a trembling voice, “Teacher, I understand.”

Feng Xiyun’s expression was the same. After quietly wiping away her tears, she felt even more admiration for her teacher and said firmly, “Teacher, you don’t have to worry at all. I will definitely focus on cultivating in the future.”

She was not very interested in cultivation, but now she had a reason to become stronger. Even if she could not become a peerless expert, she would definitely cultivate seriously so as to not let her teacher down.

Ye Xuan smiled in satisfaction.

Xiang Yun was very confused at this moment, as she had no idea what was going on. Why were her two senior sisters crying?

Could it be that the fate energy that First Sister mentioned was something rare?

Then, she suddenly said with a mischievous smile, “Teacher, I seem to have obtained a lot of that fate energy that you gave to First and Second Sister just now. How about I give you my share?”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan immediately pinched her little face and said, “Little girl, what nonsense are you spouting? Remember, I won’t take these treasures that belong to you.”

“But Teacher, you’ve already given the fate energy you just obtained to First Sister and Second Sister. What about yourself?”

“It seems like I have quite a lot, so why don’t you take some?”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan felt his heart grow warm. This little disciple of his was truly selfless when it came to him.

“Ding! Due to the gift of fate energy the host gave his disciples, Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun, the host has received a critical reward!”

When he heard the system’s notification, Ye Xuan immediately came back to his senses.

‘Haha, it really worked!’

At this moment, Ye Xuan was filled with anticipation, and could not wait to see what the critical reward would be this time…
