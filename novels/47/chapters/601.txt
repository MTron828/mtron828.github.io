602 Little Potato (Part 3)

At this moment, Feng Xiyun started to tempt her.

“That’s for sure. Your current village is only a very small place. There are no strong children in it.”

“But if you go back with us, you’ll meet all kinds of people in the future, and all of them are very powerful.”

“You have to defeat these people to become the strongest person of your generation.”

The little potato fell into deep thought.

“I have to defeat these people before I can be considered the strongest person of my generation?”

She mumbled to herself. Moments later, her eyes seemed to shine.

She stared straight at Ye Xuan. She had already made her decision.

“Alright, I’ll go back with you guys later.”

Then, she suddenly thought of a very important question and quickly asked, “”Can I eat delicious potatoes if I go back with you?”

After she finished speaking, the little girl impatiently wiped the drool from the corners of her mouth, which made her look rather adorable.

Zhuge Yueyue rubbed her little head and said, “Little potato, don’t worry.”

“As long as you come back with us, there will be plenty of delicious food. I can make you a variety of dishes.”

The little potato’s eyes lit up.

“You’re not lying to me, right? Waa! Big sister, you’re the best…”

After she hugged Zhuge Yueyue, she went over to Ye Xuan and said, “I’ve already made up my mind. I want to be your disciple, and I want to learn powerful abilities and beat all of the children my age to the ground!”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan did not know what to say. It seemed that he had accepted a little tyrant as a disciple.

However, when he thought about how funny this little girl was, and how lively Cloud Sky peak would be with her around, he felt pretty happy.

He was also very interested in the possibility that she was the reincarnation of some expert. Which expert had reincarnated as this little girl?

Ye Xuan did not think too much about it, and simply said, “Alright, but you have to grow up quickly. Only then can I teach you more powerful techniques.”

“From now on, you’re the third disciple of Cloud Sky peak. The name little potato doesn’t suit you. I’ll call you Xiang Yun.”

After thinking about it carefully, the little potato did not think it was a big deal, so she nodded.

Ye Xuan then introduced Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun to her, and Xiang Yun greeted them obediently, “Cold first sister, warm second sister, third junior sister greets you both.”

Hearing this, Zhuge Yueyue was stunned. However, Feng Xiyun was quite happy. She rubbed Xiang Yun’s little head in a very pampering manner and wiped her little face clean.

“Little Sister Xiang Yun, you’re so cute.”

Feng Xiyun was truly happy to have obtained such a cute and interesting junior sister.

Even though the latter was still young, she had suffered many trials and tribulations. Despite this, she still managed to remain pure and happy every day. This was not something that ordinary people could do.

“Alright, let’s leave.”

As soon as he said this, Ye Xuan suddenly felt a gust of wind blowing in his face, and then a figure quickly slipped away.

“Damn it, if you have the ability, then don’t leave. You actually dared to snatch my potato. If I catch you, I’ll definitely beat you to death!” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

As soon as the voice rang out, Xiang Yun chased after it and instantly disappeared.

Ye Xuan was stunned.

Eh? What was going on?

At the front, the other children’s faces turned pale when they saw the little potato rushing over. They started running again.

Those who ran slower were caught by the little potato, who grabbed their collars and threw them over her shoulders.

“Oh my god…”

Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun exclaimed in shock at the same time.

Was this little girl not a little too awesome?

“Teacher…”

Zhuge Yueyue did not know what to say.

“Hehe, this disciple of mine will definitely have extraordinary achievements in the future!”

Even though he was shocked, he still said it happily.

Although she was still young, her strength had actually reached such a level. With his teaching, in addition to her powerful strength, how could anyone of the same generation be able to beat her?

It would be easy for her to reach the sealed immortal realm.

He turned around and looked at his two disciples,

“You two can follow her.”

When they heard this, Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun quickly caught up to Xiang Yun.

Seeing that the latter still wanted to beat a child up, Feng Xiyun quickly stopped her.

“Little Sister Yun, you can’t just beat him up for no reason.”

After hearing Feng Xiyun’s words, Xiang Yun quickly replied, “I’m not doing it for no reason. This brat tried to steal my potatoes. I must teach him a good lesson today.”

“I’m not a stinky brat. You’re the stinky brat,” The child cursed.

Even though he was not as strong as Xiang Yun, he still refused to admit defeat. His mouth was very stubborn.

In terms of age, this child was a few years older than her, so what right did she have to call him a brat?

However, after hearing the child’s words, Xiang Yun became even angrier. She replied with a mocking expression, “Tsk, the old man told me that all these children who can’t win against me are all stinky brats.”

...

“If I’m not wrong, you’ll be crying in pain after I slap you, right? Wouldn’t that make you a stinky brat?”

Upon hearing this, the child started wailing and shouting.

“Don’t think that just because you’re strong you can suppress me like this. If you have the ability, then stay here and wait for me. I’ll call for people to beat you up!”

Xiang Yun was not afraid at all. She put her hands on her waist and said, ” Alright, hurry up and call those people over. I’ll beat up as many as you bring. Hmph!”

Looking at the two children who were quarreling, Zhuge Yueyue did not know what to say. She felt somewhat embarrassed by this.

Feng Xiyun, on the other hand, looked at the two of them with a face full of smiles. She rubbed Xiang Yun’s head and said, “Okay, Little Sister Yun, that’s enough. I’ll give you 200 potatoes when we get back, okay?”
