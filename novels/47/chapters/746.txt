“We have decided that the Great Wilderness Divine sect shall do its best to protect the common people in the face of this disaster!”

“Soon, we will send out our forces to help the various empires establish a defensive line and fight against the enemy together!”

!!

“This… Is this true?”

After hearing Gao Shun’s thunderous words, everyone’s jaws instantly dropped in shock.

No one had expected that the Great Wilderness Divine sect would announce such a statement today.

The group of people who failed to pass the first round of the assessment had originally wanted to take advantage of the remaining time to try their luck with other forces and see if they could join.

However, after hearing this announcement, they immediately dropped the idea. If the Great Wilderness Divine sect was really willing to help them, then this would be the second safest place in the East continent.

“Heavens! At this critical moment when everyone is in danger, almost all of the forces have closed their doors, yet the Great Wilderness Divine sect actually…”

Everyone was overcome with joy, and trembling as they spoke. This was undoubtedly a ray of light shining amidst the darkness.

“The Great Wilderness Divine sect is truly worthy of being the number one force in the East continent!”

“Truly admirable. It was not in vain for me to travel thousands of miles to get here.”

Now, they finally had a chance to survive.

At this moment, the entire sky seemed to tremble as an extremely loud voice spread in all directions.

“All members of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, please listen carefully.”

“Under the orders of the chiefs, in order to protect the lives of the people of the East continent, we will set off immediately! We’ll use Sky Mountain as a base to establish a strong line of defense to resist the invasion of the enemy!”

As soon as he finished speaking, flashes of light lit up throughout the sect, as one figure after another soared into the sky, like a scene from a movie. Excitement filled the air as the crowd looked at these tens of thousands of disciples with expressions of admiration and worship.

This spectacular scene stirred up a huge commotion, and hope once again filled the hearts of these ordinary people.

“We’re grateful to the Great Wilderness Divine sect for not abandoning us. We’re willing to risk everything for the Great Wilderness Divine sect! ”

Everyone shouted out these words in unison. This was the only response they could muster from the bottom of their hearts, and even the hearts of those who passed the first round of the assessment were filled with pride.

At this moment, Gao Shun felt both exhilarated and worried as he watched these disciples flying into the horizon.

He had also been young and full of confidence back then. Not fearing death, he and his comrades had charged headfirst in dangerous situations courageously.

As time passed, he and his comrades had gradually aged, and now witnessed the rise of a new generation of fearless and passionate cultivators.

Looking at the people who were participating in the assessment below the high platform, Gao Shun believed that they already regarded themselves as members of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, regardless of whether they passed or not.

He turned to Elder Luo and said, “Alright, I’ve said what I needed to, so you can continue the assessment.”

He had already finished what he wanted to say, so there was no need for him to stay here any longer.

“First Sister, you’re here.”

Upon seeing Zhuge Yueyue’s arrive, Feng Xiyun and Xiang Yun who were watching the assessment quickly stood up.

The two of them had heard what Gao Shun had said just now, and it had left Feng Xiyun shocked. The sect had made such a bold decision at such a critical moment.

Her admiration and sense of belonging to the sect grew even greater.

After Zhuge Yue Yue saw her two junior sisters, she looked around and asked, “I’m sure you’ve heard what was said just now, right?”

She was already thinking about what Cloud Sky peak should do after this.

Then, Xiang Yun chimed in happily, “First Sister, in that case, can we go outside and play?”
