Chapter 272: Demon Zone

Ye Xuan was clear that he could not be too hasty when dealing with a tsundere. He just had to throw in a few more tidbits to slowly pull her in.

My future precious disciple, just wait for your teacher to conquer you!

Ye Xuan did not say anything else. He turned into a streak of light and headed into the depths of spatial turbulence.

Buzzzzzz!

However, at that moment, Shangguan Wan’er also moved.

“Why are you following me?” Shangguan Wan’er said.

Ye Xuan looked at Shangguan Wan’er, and then used spatial intent to teleport in front of her.

“You’re so silly!”

Seeing this, Shangguan Wan’er gritted her teeth.

Ever since she had met this guy, she could no longer maintain her usual calm demeanor.

This guy’s speed was slower than hers, so she said that Ye Xuan had been following her.

However, he had teleported in front of her now!

Their roles had been reversed!

Moreover, it seemed that they were actually headed in the same direction.

When he encountered the titan apes earlier, Ye Xuan had already felt that something was not right.

He had been attacked for no reason, and without warning.

Were it not for his monstrous strength, he would have died!

At first, Ye Xuan had guessed that it might be a powerful spiritual controller behind those demonic beasts.

However, after careful consideration, Ye Xuan was relieved that it did not seem to be the case.

Those demonic beasts had gone berserk, and exuded monstrous killing intent. They were simply mindless killing machines.

In other words, even if it was not Ye Xuan who showed up, but other cultivators, they would still be attacked by these demonic beasts.

At this moment, the black giant that was trapped in the Tower of Heaven was still frantically attacking the Tower of Heaven like a tireless machine.

When he saw the killing intent in its eyes, a certain top-notch martial intent appeared in his mind, slaughter intent!

This was an extremely powerful martial intent which was only inferior to the supreme intents. It was on the same level as devouring intent and creation intent.

It was rumored that an ancient almighty expert had once comprehended slaughter intent and used it to become a peerless god of war, crushing his enemies.

Furthermore, comprehending slaughter intent would greatly enhance the cultivator’s strength.

However, there was a huge risk involved.

If one failed in the process of comprehension, they would lose their mind to the slaughter intent and become mindless killing machines.

The demonic beasts that attacked Ye Xuan and Shangguan Wan’er just now exhibited symptoms indicating that they had failed in their comprehension of slaughter intent.

Therefore, even if they did not encounter Ye Xuan and Shangguan Wan’er, they would have killed anyone else they came across.

Ye Xuan speculated that there might be something related to the slaughter intent in the depths of spatial turbulence.

Ye Xuan immediately activated the power of karma in his body to investigate the surroundings.

Soon, he came to a conclusion. Although this trip was somewhat dangerous, it was also accompanied by great opportunities.

In that case, what was there to hesitate about?

Not far away, Shangguan Wan’er also had similar thoughts.

Thus, both of them headed toward the same destination.

As they gradually approached the depths of spatial turbulence, the void power that was wreaking havoc in the surroundings became even more terrifying. The sky was filled with fragmented spaces as far as the eye could see.

Weaker unity realm experts would have long died in such a situation.

After the two of them passed through countless spatial storms, they finally saw a strange light in the depths of the spatial turbulence.

This strange light was also known as a spatial membrane, and there were usually small worlds or mystic realms inside.

However, spatial membranes were extremely tough, and ordinary cultivators would not be able to penetrate it at all.

‘It seems that this mystic realm is at least as large as the Moon Demon mystic realm!’

The two of them had the same thought.

With Ye Xuan’s strength, even if he entered the Moon Demon mystic realm, he could easily tear space apart to leave. However, doing so would very likely send him to a random location.

‘I wonder where this mystic realm is connected to. It doesn’t seem to be part of the Huangyu Zone.’

Ye Xuan frowned slightly.

As he possessed spatial intent, he was naturally very sensitive to such things.

This spatial membrane was rippling with spatial power, and it was clearly the entrance to the mystic realm.

However, what puzzled Ye Xuan was that this entrance seemed to be connected to an extremely distant place.

‘In any case, since I’m already here, I have to go in and take a look!’

With this thought in mind, Ye Xuan took out his sword and swung it at the spatial membrane, tearing it apart.

Buzzzzzz!

Ye Xuan’s figure suddenly disappeared and, when he reappeared, he was already inside the mystic realm.

There was a blood-red aura wherever he looked, and the spiritual energy in this mystic realm seemed extremely violent.

Buzzzzzz!

At that moment, Shangguan Wan’er also arrived.

“The killing intent here is so dense!”

“I’m afraid that those demonic beasts came from this mystic realm!”

Seeing this, Shangguan Wan’er had a look of realization.

This mystic realm was filled with killing intent. Even the flowers and trees were covered in blood!

If a cultivator’s willpower was not strong enough, they would be instantly bewitched by this killing intent.

Roar! ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Suddenly, a deafening roar was heard from the distance.

A demonic beast! And not just one!

Boom! Boom! Boom!

A wave of violent energy fluctuations wreaked havoc in the surroundings, creating spatial cracks everywhere.

Two Tier Seven demonic beasts were fighting each other, both of which were as strong as pattern condensation realm experts.

Boom!

The two demonic beasts were fighting like lunatics, disregarding their own safety, and the many spatial cracks around them.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan narrowed his eyes.

It was almost certain that those demonic beasts that attacked them earlier were from this mystic realm.

Buzzzzzz!

Ye Xuan turned into a streak of light and flew into the distance.

There were opportunities in this mystic realm!

Although the mystic realm was vast, Ye Xuan could teleport within a certain range, which allowed him to cover a lot of ground within a very short span of time.

After some time, Ye Xuan discovered that…

The living beings in this mystic realm were basically all demonic beasts. There was not a single human!

“Is this secret realm connected to the Demon Zone?”

The Demon Zone was an area that was larger than even the Huangyu Zone. It was the territory of demonic beasts!

Furthermore, demonic beasts were mortal enemies with humans. Any human that dared to set foot in the Demon Zone would be hunted down and killed.
