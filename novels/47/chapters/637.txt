638 Big Trouble Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

The effects of this immortal-grade pill were pretty good.

As long as one consumed it, they could immediately recover their physical strength in battle. Even their spiritual power would be restored to its peak state.

Despite the turbulent waves in his heart, Ye Xuan’s expression was still very calm, and he instantly put the pill into his storage space.

Li Dahai also hurriedly put away the pill Ye Xuan gave him, afraid that the latter would regret his decision and take them back. He looked extremely excited.

Looking at him, it even seemed like he was not going to give it to Li Yi.

Ye Xuan laughed.

“Senior Brother Li, why don’t you give it to Li Yi so he can recover?”

Li Dahai looked embarrassed.

Although Li Yi looked like he had been beaten up very badly, it was only a superficial injury. He could just take a normal healing pill. There was no need to take a pill this valuable.

If he really ate it, it would be like using a cannon to hit a bird. In other words, it would be total overkill.

Li Dahai had already decided to keep the pill for now.

Even if he had to suffer the wrath of the tigress when he got home, it was worth it.

He was on the verge of making a breakthrough at any moment. With this pill, he was even more confident of his success.

He was the most suitable person for this pill.

At the thought of this, Li Dahai immediately said righteously with a serious expression, “Young man, suffering a little now to learn from your mistakes is a good thing.”

“I need him to experience the price of provoking others so that he can avoid future troubles.”

“Thank you, Junior Brother Ye, for your kind intentions. Cough, cough. Since there’s nothing else, I’ll take my son home first.”

Ye Xuan was speechless, but he did not say anything. Li Dahai could do whatever he wanted.

The only regretful thing was that he did not get to see the effects of this low-quality high-grade soul returning pill personally.

However, this was not a big deal. After all, he still had more, and could try it another day.

Before he left, Li Dahai turned around and looked at Ye Xuan. “There’s something I almost forgot to tell you. You should hurry over to the main peak to take a look when you have the time.”

“A little longer, and the meeting hall on the main peak would have been torn down.”

“Ah?”

This little girl was really good at causing trouble.

He actually wanted to tear down the meeting hall?

“Oh no, I have to hurry over first. Otherwise, the others will also come over with grievances.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan rushed directly to the main peak, not daring to delay a moment longer.

This little girl really made him worry too much.

Originally, he thought that Xiang Yun would definitely be obedient this time and learn to read. However, it seemed that the trouble she had caused this time was much bigger than before.

Was she trying to tear down the meeting hall?

He activated the Fiery Phoenix technique at full strength, and in the blink of an eye, reached the main peak.

Once there, he spotted what was left of the study hall. It truly was an unbearable sight. Sigh, this would cause even more problems for him.

After quickly checking the surrounding situation, he noticed the commotion in the distance, so he quickly flew over.

A petite girl could be seen holding a big hammer with one hand as she spoke to a group of disciples in front of her.

“Don’t waste my time. Come at me together. I’ll beat all of you up!”

The commotion in this place had already spread, so all of the nearby disciples had rushed over to see what was going on.

However, when the disciples saw what was going on, they were gobsmacked.

A little girl who was at most six years old had actually destroyed the entire study hall with just a big hammer.

Just who took this little girl in as a disciple? She was too f*cking strong, no?

“I can’t believe what I’m seeing. She’s so young, but her strength has already reached a terrifying level.”

“A group of people from the main peak took turns to fight, but they actually can’t deal with her.”

“Every strike of that hammer carries the force of a million jin, you know. How do you expect us to deal with that? Can you?”

The group of disciples were panicking as they watched everything with wide eyes.

However, the little girl in front of them was still closing in on the meeting hall, and the disciples were forced to retreat.

Outside, Gao Tianyu’s eyes were wide open as he watched this scene. He felt particularly emotional.

“Sigh…”

“Even little girls are so terrifying now. Comparing myself to her at her age… I’m really mediocre.”

Gao Tianyu heaved a long sigh. He now knew who this little girl was.

If he was not wrong, this little girl must be the new disciple that Cloud Sky peak accepted.

If he had not witnessed everything that had happened today, he would have taken the whole thing for a joke. After all, who could believe that a little girl could actually be so powerful?

After moving forward for a while, Xiang Yun suddenly recalled something. She turned around and asked the crowd.

“Who is Gao Tianyu? Is he here?”

After saying that, Xiang Yun threw the hammer in her hand down, shattering the ground.

“Uh…”

...

After hearing this, Gao Tianyu, who was originally here to watch the show, suddenly had a bad feeling. He broke out in cold sweat.

‘Why is she suddenly calling me by my full name?’

‘She’s looking for me?’

Gao Tianyu was also confused. He did not know what was going on. He could not recall provoking this little girl.

After hearing Gao Tianyu’s name, the crowd subconsciously looked at him.
