“I killed your son.”

After hearing this, Shan Hai’s murderous gaze instantly locked onto Feng Xiyun.

“Good. You’ve got guts!”

“Where are you from? Which faction is so audacious that they actually dare to become enemies with the lightning tiger clan?”

As soon as he finished speaking, Shan Hai’s aura immediately erupted, causing Feng Xiyun to stagger back.

She forced herself to stay on her feet. Although her back was sweating profusely, she still insisted on speaking.

“I did it, so I dare to admit it!”

“I’m the disciple of Ye Xuan of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, Feng Xiyun. I killed your son.”

Feng Xiyun did not exhibit the slightest bit of fear.

At this moment, flames of fury erupted in Shan Hai’s heart as he roared hysterically, “Arrogant indeed! No matter whose disciple you are, I will tear you into pieces and avenge my son.”

“Our noble bloodline is not to be sullied by nameless fools like you. Even if your teacher Ye Xuan comes here today, I will make him kneel down and admit his mistake!”

After hearing these words that were filled with killing intent, Lu Xiu looked at Feng Xiyun, who was standing tall amidst it all. Her will was still indomitable in the face of impending doom.

“Sigh… My hundreds of years of cultivation have really been in vain…”

“At such a critical moment, how can I let a junior like her shoulder all of the blame?”

After saying this, Lu Xiu’s gaze became determined. Before he stood up, he crushed a jade pendant with his right hand, which instantly sent news back to Cloud Sky peak.

Then, Lu Xiu walked over to Feng Xiyun’s side and said with a cold expression, “Hmph! Do you really think you’re all that? Your son wanted to kill us, so we killed him.”

“Now, an expert from the senior generation like you has come to seek revenge. How laughable!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the atmosphere became even more tense. Everyone could sense the brewing storm.

Although the aura of a peak ancient realm expert was pressing down on them, none of the cultivators from the Great Wilderness Divine sect took a step back.

All of them had experienced the battle with Mengyu, who was far more terrifying, so handling this much pressure was still bearable.

After hearing these words, Feng Xiyun trembled slightly as she turned to look at Lu Xiu.

She really did not expect that in such a dangerous moment, he would bravely stand up for her.

Her original plan was to shoulder the entire responsibility alone to avoid the sect being implicated.

However, Lu Xiu’s words had already implicated the sect in this matter.

At this moment, another voice rang out.

“What a joke. Their so-called noble bloodline is just something self-proclaimed. So what if we kill them?”

“There’s no need for our Great Wilderness Divine sect to bother with such useless things!”

At this moment, the sect’s cultivators all started chiming in, disregarding the danger they were in. They did not exhibit any fear at all.

After seeing this, anger rushed to Shan Hai’s heart. He was being ridiculed by these ants? How humiliating!

“Alright, you guys are really beyond arrogant!”

“Great Wilderness Divine sect? A mere small faction like yours actually dared to provoke my clan?”

“Even if Ye Xuan shows up, all of you will die!”

As soon as he finished speaking, bolts of divine lightning condensed into a huge cage, trapping all of the Great Wilderness Divine sect’s cultivators.

Shan Hai’s spiritual pressure descended upon them, forcing them to lower their heads, but they did not give in. It seemed that a massacre was about to take place.

“I’m afraid that they will die here.”

Elder Tongtian and Chu Batian exchanged glances with each other, feeling sincere admiration.

At this critical moment, none of these people of the Great Wilderness Divine sect had buckled under pressure. This unity in itself was worthy of admiration. In fact, they were also envious of this, and wished that their sects were as united.

“Hehe, why are you acting arrogantly in our East continent?”

Elder Tongtian had already made up his mind. He took out his treasured sword and pointed it at Shan Hai from afar. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

After seeing Elder Tongtian brandish his sword, the other forces of the East continent were roused into action, and prepared for battle.

Ever since they arrived at the East Sea, they had been looked down upon by the geniuses of the other continents. They had had enough.

Feng Xiyun had done a good deed by cutting down that arrogant lightning tiger, so now that she was in trouble for it, if they backed down, they would not dare to call themselves cultivators anymore.

“Hehe, the lightning tiger clan? It’s just a bunch of bigger cats isn’t it? How dare they call themselves noble. It’s simply ridiculous.”

“The human race is truly supreme, so don’t compare us to beasts like yourself! What’s there to be so arrogant about, huh?”
