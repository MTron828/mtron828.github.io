818 Sword Elder

Up until now, Ye Xuan had only taken in three disciples. Of the three, only Zhuge Yueyue had inherited Ye Xuan’s Sword Dao. Feng Xiyun was talented in terms of alchemy, while Xiang Yun was a body refining cultivator.

If Ye Xuan no longer took in disciples, then would his legacy be wasted?

“Senior Brother Ao, I didn’t mention that I wouldn’t continue teaching.”

“Oh?”

After hearing this, everyone was stunned.

What did that mean?

“That’s true. Although Ye Xuan won’t continue to recruit disciples, he can continue to teach.”

Even though Ye Xuan would not continue to take in disciples, Zhuge Yueyue would. As Zhuge Yueyue’s disciple, one could enjoy the privilege of being taught by Ye Xuan in his capacity as grandmaster.

After all, Ye Xuan was not one to leave his disciples in the lurch. Furthermore, now that he had handed over the reins of leadership to Zhuge Yueyue, he would have more time to deal with other matters.

“Alright, this matter has been decided.”

Before anyone else could raise any objections, Ye Xuan concluded the matter. Then, he turned around and looked at Zhuge Yueyue.

“Yueyue, from now on, you will be in charge of Cloud Sky peak. I have full confidence in your abilities. I also hope to see Cloud Sky peak continue to grow and become stronger under your leadership.”

Hearing Ye Xuan’s words, Zhuge Yueyue’s eyes turned red.

These words contained her teacher’s expectations for her. She vowed not to let him down!

“Teacher, I will definitely do well,” Zhuge Yueyue said with a determined expression.

“Alright, you’ve already become a big girl. There’s no need to cry anymore,” Ye Xuan teased her, causing her face to turn red.

How could her teacher tease her in public like this?

Moments later, the corners of Ao Lei’s mouth curled up slightly. Although Ye Xuan stepped down from his position as chief, Ao Lei would not let him slack off.

“Everyone, I have something to announce today.”

“Oh?”

“What’s going on now?”

Everyone’s gaze involuntarily turned towards Ao Lei, and Ye Xuan had a bad feeling, especially after seeing Ao Lei’s smile.

“From today onward, the position of the Sword Elder of our Great Wilderness Divine sect will be occupied by the former chief of Cloud Sky peak, Ye Xuan!”

“This…”

After hearing this news, everyone’s jaws dropped, especially the disciples of the Great Wilderness Divine sect.

They all understood what the position of Sword Elder represented.

Even the sect master’s status was inferior to the Sword Elder’s status!

Only the top expert of the Great Wilderness Divine sect would be qualified to take up this position.

In the past hundred years, other than Chief Tian Xuan, this position had always been empty. No one else had been able to take up the responsibility. Now, a suitable successor had finally been identified.

“That makes sense. Sword Immortal Ye is definitely qualified to occupy this position.”

“He’s a sealed immortal realm expert, after all. If he’s not qualified, then no one else would be.”

They all felt that this appointment was only natural.

“I’m in favor of this appointment,” Gao Shun said loudly. He had been signaled to say something in order to avoid Ye Xuan backing out. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Yuelun covered her mouth and chuckled. She secretly gave Ye Xuan a look and said with a smile, “Senior Brother Ao, I also agree.”

“Hahaha, since you guys have already agreed, how can I, Old Li, not agree?”

Li Dahai laughed heartily. He was also very impressed with Ye Xuan. He had no qualms letting Ye Xuan take up the position of Sword Elder.

The other chiefs then all echoed their agreement in quick succession.

After seeing this, Ye Xuan smiled helplessly.

“You guys really won’t let me go, huh?”

Since things had come to this, Ye Xuan had no choice but to agree.

Ao Lei laughed happily.

He was getting on in years, so he might not be able to lead the sect for much longer. If the sect master followed suit and had Hua Rufeng take up the position of sect master, then it would be reassuring if Ye Xuan was still around to guide him and guard the sect.

Ao Lei also firmly believed that Ye Xuan would definitely not reject the appointment. After all, the latter was also a person who cared about the Great Wilderness Divine sect.

Ye Xuan took a deep breath. He then briefly glanced at Hua Rufeng beside Ao Lei and waved his hand. In the end, he agreed. After all, the Sword Elder did not need to manage the sect’s day-to-day affairs.
