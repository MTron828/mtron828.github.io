“Well said! Cultivators are supposed to struggle against the heavens, so why should we care about what others say?”

“Come with me.”

Ye Xuan smiled. With a wave of his sleeve, he took out the Cloud Sky sword, and brought Zhuge Yueyue along to Cloud Sky peak.

Along the way, Zhuge Yueyue looked at the fleeting mountain peaks and clouds around her. Her heart was filled with nervousness and anticipation.

!!

After all, everyone from the mystic world yearned to tread the path of cultivation.

She also felt a trace of happiness from this. After the tragedy that had befallen her, she finally had a glimpse of hope.

Although her teacher seemed to be looked down upon by the other chiefs, he had remained calm and composed, which was befitting of a true cultivator.

Soon, Ye Xuan returned to Cloud Sky peak with Zhuge Yueyue, landing on the only courtyard residence on the mountain peak.

The courtyard was simple and crude, with a few dilapidated wooden houses around it.

“We’re here.”

Ye Xuan walked over to the wooden house calmly.

“Although my residence is relatively simple, it can temper a cultivator’s mind. It will be of great help to you on your cultivation path in the future.”

Ye Xuan was obviously spouting nonsense. However, he could utter such words in a believable manner thanks to his experience with Yue and the others.

That being said, compared to the other peaks of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, Cloud Sky peak was indeed very poor and lacking.

This was because Tian Xuan had devoted himself to cultivation, so he had only accepted Ye Xuan as a disciple before his death.

In other words, before Ye Xuan, Tian Xuan lived alone on Cloud Sky peak.

“Yueyue will remember Teacher’s teachings,” Zhuge Yueyue nodded in agreement, her eyes brimming with determination.

“In this courtyard, besides the small wooden house in the middle, you can choose any one as your residence.”

“From today onward, you’ll be my fifth disciple and the only successor of Cloud Sky peak.”

“I’m sure you’re very confused as to why there is no one around me, yet you’re my fifth disciple,” Ye Xuan said with a smile.

“I am.”

Zhuge Yueyue did not hide her suspicions.

“You are indeed my first disciple in the mystic world, but you have four senior sisters on another plane. They are just temporarily unable to come to the mystic world,” Ye Xuan explained.

Although he did not know when his other four disciples would be able to ascend to the mystic world, he still had to make things clear.

“As for the difference between planes, you will understand it in the future,” Ye Xuan explained when he saw Zhuge Yueyue’s confused expression.

“Alright, Teacher.”

Hearing Ye Xuan’s words, not only did Zhuge Yueyue not mind, but she was also very happy.

She had originally thought that she would be all alone after her parents passed away. Now, not only did she have a teacher, but she also had four senior sisters whom she had never met before. Perhaps this would become her new family.

“Since you’ve entered my tutelage, you’ll have to cultivate properly in the future.”

“Teacher, please rest assured. I will definitely not embarrass you!”

“En!” Ye Xuan nodded.

“Alright! As my disciple, you’ll naturally receive a welcome gift.”

“This is a marrow cleansing pill. Consume it and it will wash away the impurities in your body.”

“It will increase your sensitivity to the spiritual energy of the world and increase your cultivation speed.”

Then, Ye Xuan took out the marrow cleansing pill he had received from the system and gave it to Zhuge Yueyue.

Zhuge Yueyue looked at the pill in her hand in shock.

“Teacher, is this really for me?”

She had just become a disciple, yet he had already given her such a precious treasure as a gift!

Before they entered the Great Wilderness Divine sect, Hua Rufeng had explained to them that in order to go further on the path of immortal cultivation, there was one thing that was extremely important besides the cultivator’s aptitude and talent, which was cultivation resources and heavenly treasures.

However, these precious items were basically controlled by the various chiefs. Even the sect master did not give these out freely. After all, these things were not easy to obtain and were extremely precious.

Zhuge Yueyue had never expected that her teacher would be so generous.

“Many thanks, Teacher! I won’t let you down!”

After that, Zhuge Yueyue swallowed the marrow cleansing pill without hesitation.

She felt a warm current flowing through her body, washing away the impurities in her body.

Very quickly, a layer of sticky substance appeared on her skin, which were the impurities in her body.

“There’s a hot spring behind Cloud Sky peak. You can go there and wash up,” Ye Xuan kindly reminded her. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Many thanks, Teacher! I’ll go and wash up first!”

When Zhuge Yueyue heard this, she covered her face shyly and fled.

At this moment, a system notification suddenly rang out in Ye Xuan’s mind.

“Ding! As the host has given his disciple a marrow cleansing pill (supreme-grade, yellow-rank), the host has received a randomized 1,000x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the heavenly marrow pill (supreme-grade earth-rank)!”

Ye Xuan’s eyes brightened.

The system was indeed different after the upgrade.

A 1,000x multiplier right off the bat!
