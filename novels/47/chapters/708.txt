709 Gift

Thank you readers!

Ye Xuan did not want to take something she had worked so hard to obtain, but was curious why she wanted to give it to him.

Xiang Yun replied with a serious expression, “Teacher, didn’t you say that refining it would increase a person’s cultivation level significantly?”

“Teacher, if you refine this golden crystal, you can become even stronger. In that case, we can travel the world without any worries in the future.”

“Teacher, you usually teach and give us good stuff, but we don’t have much to offer you in return, so this crystal is definitely a good chance to repay you.”

!!

“Besides, my senior sisters told me that if I meet someone I like in the future, I have to give him a special gift.”

“Since I like Teacher very much, this special gift is for you,” she said happily.

However, after hearing these words, Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun’s faces instantly turned red. This was not the kind of “like” that they had been referring to!

“Hahaha”

At this moment, Ye Xuan laughed out loud. Of course, he understood the innocent meaning behind Xiang Yun’s words, but also felt very touched by them.

That being said, he still would not accept this crystal.

After pondering for a moment, Ye Xuan spoke, “Okay then, this crystal stone will be your gift to me. I will accept it.”

After receiving the crystal, Ye Xuan smiled and placed it back into Xiang Yun’s hand.

“Now, I will give this crystal to you, because I also like you as well.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan rubbed her head dotingly.

However, at this moment, Xiang Yun was dumbfounded and did not know what to feel.

What was going on?

Could it be that her teacher was not satisfied with the gift she gave him? L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Otherwise, why would he give it back to her?

She wanted to say something, but did not know how to express her current thoughts and emotions.

As such, she became flustered and anxious.

When the onlookers saw this, they became very nervous. Would she suddenly berserk again?

However, they did not dare to say anything. They could only pray that Ye Xuan did not provoke her too much and that he would just accept the gift.

At this moment, Xiang Yun said rather despondently, “Teacher, are you not satisfied with the gift I gave you? Is that why you returned it to me?”

As she said this, tears started to well in her eyes. She really wanted to give her teacher a special gift, but the most precious thing she currently owned was this crystal.

Although Ye Xuan had already accepted it, he returned in less than a second.

“To me, each of my disciples occupies an extremely important position in my heart. How could I not be satisfied with the gift you gave me?”

“There’s actually very little that I can do for you. I can only guarantee that within my capabilities, I can help you improve and protect you. These are all things that I’m very willing to do.”

After hearing Ye Xuan’s words, Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun lowered their heads and secretly wiped away their tears. After all, Ye Xuan’s actions throughout this entire time was the best proof of how much he cared for them.

After thinking for a moment, Ye Xuan continued, “”Although I can protect you now, I can’t protect you forever.”

“Before you guys go out and explore the world on your own, the only thing I can do is to do my best to help you guys become stronger and more independent. This way, I’ll be more at ease.”

Hearing Ye Xuan’s words, everyone quieted down, and the disciples of the other sects subconsciously looked at their own teachers. Was their teacher willing to go so far for their development and well-being?

After sensing these gazes, many of the teachers felt somewhat guilty.

What the hell?

How did everyone end up comparing teachers?

There was no way they were going to measure up to Ye Xuan!

The comparison was simply unfair!

The elders of the various major factions had originally wanted to stay here and have a good chat with their peers, but it seemed that they could not stay for too long, lest more comparisons be made between them and Ye Xuan.

“Teacher, you don’t have to say more. You’ve always been so considerate of us. How could we not know and understand how much you care for us?”

Zhuge Yueyue wiped her tears and said these words in a trembling voice. Then, she squatted down and rubbed Xiang Yun’s head to comfort her.

“Third Sister, you have to be obedient and listen to Teacher’s instructions, okay?”

Xiang Yun nodded her head quietly.
