Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

White Moon Tower, Tower Master’s Palace.

“The existence behind this girl won’t take it out on me, right?”

Thinking of this, Dai Weibo felt uneasy.

“No! I have to ask that guy in detail. He should have more information regarding this matter!”

…

“Yan’er, was… was that big bird given to you by your teacher?”

Lin Qingping landed on the ground and looked at Zhao Yuyan in shock.

Tier 5 demonic beast!

It was comparable to a mid-stage golden core realm cultivator, yet this powerful creature was her precious daughter’s mount?

Was this not too ridiculous?

Zhao Yuyan had told Lin Qingping everything that happened in the mystic realm, including the gift of the contractual mount.

However, Lin Qingping did not pay too much attention to it at that time. She thought that it was at most a demonic beast that had reached the true essence realm at most.

Never in her wildest dreams had she imagined that the Firewing would be so terrifying that it could overpower Elder Niejin.

If Elder Niejin had not used his protective jade token just now, he would probably have already died to those green flames.

“Yes, yes! Teacher treated Yan’er very well. He even gave me a special jade token as a trump card!”

Zhao Yuyan blinked, and then raised the jade token in her hand.

“What?”

Seeing this, Lin Qingping’s pupils suddenly constricted.

Although she could not sense the power contained in the jade token, going by how powerful the Firewing was, the trump card that Ye Xuan left for Zhao Yuyan was definitely extraordinary.

She did not expect that this teacher of her’s would treat her so well.

She had never seen a teacher treat their disciple so well! Not only did he leave her with all kinds of trump cards, but he also performed spiritual power infusion on her.

Of course, because Ye Xuan had concealed Zhao Yuyan’s aura, Lin Qingping had not initially noticed that her precious daughter had already reached the tenth level of the qi transformation realm.

However, after observing her for the past few days, Lin Qingping also noticed that something was not right.

Her daughter’s skills were far better than before, and there were even quite a few moves that only qi transformation realm cultivators could achieve.

Hu!

Lin Qingping took a deep breath and became even more curious about her daughter’s teacher.

On a mountain peak not far away, Yin Susu was still in shock.

This girl actually contracted such a huge demonic beast? How did she get it?

Had it been given to her by an expert?

High-level flying demonic beasts were unruly and untamable. Under normal circumstances, only unity realm experts could subdue them.

There was actually a unity realm expert behind this girl?

Yin Susu’s mind was filled with doubt. However, because she was also afraid of Zhao Yuyan’s bad luck, she did not go over to inquire about it. After looking around for a while, she left.

South Pavilion, Elder Niejin’s palace.

“Vile creature! You almost killed me!”

Thinking of Li Baijun, Elder Niejin was furious.

He originally thought that he could reap some benefits from the matter while resolving some old grudges.

He did not expect Zhao Yuyan to have such a terrifying mount..

Even now, Elder Niejin was still afraid.

He did not know how Zhao Yuyan obtained such a terrifying demonic beast. At the very least, before this girl entered the mystic realm, she definitely did not have such a trump card.

Could it be that this girl met a terrifying existence in the mystic realm, and the other party had given her this demonic beast?

Shua!

While Elder Niejin was deep in thought, a bright streak of light flashed by, and Dai Weibo’s figure appeared.

“Tower Master?”

“Elder Niejin, do you know the origin of Zhao Yuyan’s mount?”

Dai Weibo did not beat around the bush and got straight to the point.

“I’m not sure either, but it’s very likely that she obtained it in the Moon Demon mystic realm!”

Elder Niejin did not dare to hide anything from Dai Weibo and repeated everything that Li Baijun had told him.

“Moon Demon mystic realm?”

Dai Weibo squinted his eyes when he heard this.

He did not expect Elder Niejin to lack the specific details. How could he avoid that expert’s anger now? Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Forget it!”

After a long while, Dai Weibo sighed deeply.

At least from now on, he had to avoid offending Zhao Yuyan, and he had to keep Elder Niejin away from the mother and daughter pair.

Of course, Elder Niejin would not dare to go over. The Firewing could easily burn him to ashes.

However, the enmity between the two sides had already been formed.Whether Elder Niejin could survive depended on the attitude of the expert behind Zhao Yuyan.

“Right, have you heard about Ye Xuan?”

Dai Weibo seemed to have thought of something, and then his gaze fell on Elder Niejin.

Ever since the mystic realm closed, Ye Xuan’s name had spread everywhere and was now resounding throughout the Nanzhou Region.

“Of course I’ve heard of him!” Elder Niejin nodded.

It was said that the talent Ye Xuan displayed was even more monstrous than the master of the Divine Gate, the strongest cultivator in the Nanzhou Region currently, an apex existence.

This cultivator named Ye Xuan actually crushed the master of the Divine Gate in terms of talent!

Furthermore, he was only 20 years old, and had enough power to tear space apart. This information shocked whoever heard it.

They had all entered the Moon Demon mystic realm in their younger days, so they naturally knew how terrifying the difficulty level of the Tower of Heaven was.

It was also because of this that they naturally knew how significant this matter was.

Ye Xuan already had the strength to destroy the entire Radiany Sky Empire.!

“Ye Xuan’s talent is truly rare, but I heard that he killed an outer sect elder of the Blood Moon Temple in the mystic realm! What a pity!”

“That’s right! Although the Blood Moon Temple is not the strongest force in the Nanzhou Region, it will definitely seek revenge for the smallest grievance! Although Ye Xuan’s talent is extremely monstrous, he might not be able to escape their grasp!”
