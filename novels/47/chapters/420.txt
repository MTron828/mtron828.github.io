421 The Crack In The Boundary

“Teacher, where should we go?”

Feng Xiyun looked at Ye Xuan and asked in a soft voice.

At this moment, Su Tiansheng, who was beside him, stood up.

“Chief Ye Xuan, if you don’t mind, you can stay at my Su family’s residence for a few days! I will definitely host you well.”

!!

“I appreciate Master Su’s good intentions, but I brought my disciples out to gain experience in preparation for the sect’s Seven Peaks competition, and it’s almost time to go back.”

After he finished speaking, he turned to look at Su Changhe.

“Young Master Su, I’m quite satisfied with your performance today. It seems that what you said that day is somewhat credible.”

“Cough, cough! How would I dare to lie to Chief Ye Xuan? In all of Qingyang City, I am one of the most filial sons, and the role model of filial piety.”

Su Changhe spoke these words in a serious tone, but he could not help but secretly wipe the sweat off his forehead.

Hearing this, Ye Xuan laughed inwardly.

“Well done then. Remember to keep it up in the future!”

“Alright! Let’s go!”

After Ye Xuan spoke to Su Changhe, he led Feng Xiyun and Zhuge Yueyue in the direction of the Great Wilderness Divine sect.

Originally, Xin’er had also planned to follow them. However, Feng Xiyun told her that she was free to live her own life now that Feng Xiyun had Ye Xuan as her teacher.

Xin’er was very grateful. However, she had accompanied Feng Xiyun since she was young, and could be said to be as close as sisters. How could she bear to part with her?

After some thought, Feng Xiyun promised her that whenever she missed her, she could come to Cloud Sky peak to visit at any time.

Only after hearing this did Xin’er agree to leave.

“Father, what are you thinking about?”

After Ye Xuan and the others left, Su Tiansheng stood in place with a dazed look on his face. He touched his chin and began to think.

Su Changhe was curious when he saw this.

Su Tiansheng looked in the direction that Ye Xuan had left and sighed deeply, his eyes full of admiration.

“Chief Ye Xuan is so young, yet his strength is already so terrifying. He can be said to be a peerless expert of this generation!”

“With his own power, he easily crushed three elders from the Immortal Divine sect. Furthermore, he did not use any artifacts.”

“His attainments in the Sword Dao have already reached an extremely terrifying level. Even now, I still have a lingering fear of that overbearing sword qi!”

“Even his disciples are extremely talented. Their future achievements are limitless. It seems that we have made the right choice in choosing to protect them.”

After saying all this, Su Tiansheng turned around and his eyes fell on Su Changhe. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“My dear son, you’ve done well this time. If it weren’t for you protecting Chief Ye Xuan’s two disciples, the Su family wouldn’t have been able to gain the recognition of Cloud Sky peak so easily.”

“In the future, even if the Su family is handed over to you to manage, I can rest at ease.”

Hearing Su Tiansheng’s sincere and earnest words, Su Changhe was choked up with emotion.

Ever since he was young, he had always been a wastrel and hedonistic son in his father’s eyes. He had never received such positive recognition.

Thankfully, he had learnt his lesson.

Furthermore, compared to that brainless son of the Lin family, he was far too outstanding.

At this moment, Lin Dahai, who was next to him, said, “Master, I’m sure all of the major families in Qingyang City now know that we’re on Cloud Sky peak’s side after this. Do you think we should do something?”

“Elder Lin’s words are reasonable. Then, we’ll add ten thousand taels of profound gold on top of the gifts we prepared earlier, and build a palace on Cloud Sky peak for Chief Ye Xuan.”

“Our Su family is a big family and can easily afford this,” Su Tiansheng said generously.

Then, he looked at the disheveled Lin Youming with a smug expression and left while humming a happy tune.

After a few hours…

The Great Wilderness Divine sect, Cloud Sky peak.

A streak of light flickered, and the figures of Ye Xuan, Feng Xiyun, and Zhuge Yueyue appeared.

“Is this Cloud Sky peak?”

Feng Xiyun was stunned as she looked at the clouds in front of her and the red-crowned cranes that were constantly flying past the surrounding mountain peaks.

Clouds and mist swirled around. This was truly a paradise on earth.

In addition, the spiritual energy on the mountain peak was extremely abundant. There was also a natural waterfall on the mountain peak, which was simply too beautiful.

“Yueyue, take Xiyun around on a tour of Cloud Sky peak. Oh right, tell her about the Great Wilderness Divine sect as well.”

“That’s all for today. You can rest after that!”

“Yes, Teacher.”

Zhuge Yueyue nodded her head respectfully and left with Feng Xiyun.

Ye Xuan immediately returned to his room, took out a beast bone covered in mysterious runes from his storage ring and began to study it.

This bone contained a strange dark power, which was extremely corrosive to all living things.

“Is this the strange power that’s been causing the problem with the berserk beasts?”

Ye Xuan looked at the beast bone in his hand and fell into a state of deep thought.

This was something he had picked up in an extremely obscure place after entering the depths of the archaic divine mountains.

The strange power contained in this beast bone was very similar to the power in the previous berserk beasts, except much stronger.

Ye Xuan guessed that the bodies of those which were infected earlier contained more of this strange power.

After entering the depths of the archaic divine mountain, Ye Xuan also discovered that a tiny crack had actually appeared in the boundary of the East continent.

The strange power seemed to flow in from beyond the crack.

Fortunately, so far, only beasts had been infected by this strange power, and no cultivators had exhibited similar symptoms.

However, Ye Xuan had an ominous feeling in his heart. There seemed to be some secret and conspiracy behind this.

After learning that there was a crack in the boundary of the East continent, Ye Xuan studied it carefully for a while and left after he found nothing.

Along the way, Ye Xuan also accidentally discovered an ancient tomb that had been sealed for a long time. Unfortunately, he was not the only one who discovered this ancient tomb.

The reason why Mu Beichen and the others had come to Qingyang City was most likely because of this ancient tomb in the archaic divine mountains.

Incidentally, the seal of the ancient tomb was extremely strong and would not open on its own for a short period of time.

Therefore, Ye Xuan returned. He planned to explore the ancient tomb after the Seven Peaks competition.
