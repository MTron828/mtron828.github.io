344 The Last Trump Card

The war between the two races destroyed everything in its path and turned everything into dust.

This was especially so for the weaker cultivators. Before they could even react, they were already torn to pieces by the attacks that were flying left and right.

Even the ordinary people could not escape annihilation.

“Damn it! The sea race’s attack is too fierce. We can’t resist them!”

“I’m afraid it won’t be long before the Nanzhou Region falls!”

The sigh of an expert could be heard.

He was a fifth-level unity realm cultivator from the Gongsun family.

Currently, the various major forces had lost countless experts. In the long run, they might be completely annihilated. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

As for small and medium-sized empires like the Great Qian Dynasty, they had long been drowned in the endless numbers of the sea race army.

“Keke! Why are you humans even trying to struggle? How can puny humans like you resist the power of the sea race?”

“Oh right! For you pattern condensation realm cultivators, if you lay down your arms and surrender, we’ll spare your lives and make you our guard dogs!”

An expert from the sea sneered.

They had been very nervous about the attack on the Nanzhou Region, which was Ye Xuan’s homeland.

However, what puzzled them was that after so many years, there was no sign of Ye Xuan at all.

The most important thing was that the sea race had once used Saint King realm experts to search for traces of Ye Xuan, but they had found nothing, which made them even more afraid of Ye Xuan’s strength.

However, they did not dare to disobey the orders of the dragon race’s great emperor realm expert.

Therefore, in order to avoid any sudden changes, they planned to conquer the Nanzhour Region as quickly as possible.

However, the human race had shown unusual unity in times of crisis. The various major forces resisted the sea race’s attacks repeatedly.

Although the sea race had taken over most of the Nanzhou Region, there was still a pocket of territory that was holding on and defending stoutly.

“Damn it! Is the Nanzhou Region really going to be occupied by the sea race?”

A Zhuge family eighth-level unity realm expert clenched his fists tightly. His eyes were filled with unwillingness.

Although cultivators from other regions had come here to reinforce them, it was still insufficient to resist the sea race’s endless numbers. Currently, it would take a miracle to save the Nanzhou Region.

“Do I really have to use that favor?”

A huge flood dragon gravely wounded the body of an old man.

However, as the thick lifeforce within his divine elements surged out, the old man’s body quickly recovered.

And that old man was an elder from the Gongsun family, and a fifth-level unity realm cultivator.

Everyone fell silent after hearing the old man’s words.

They naturally knew about the incident about the Nether God sect, and the fact that the Gongsun family had received the promise of a favor from Ye Xuan in exchange for their help.

However, Ye Xuan’s strength was so terrifying that this favor was too precious.

“We haven’t reached that stage yet!”

The elder of the Gongsun family erupted with strength as he fought the flood dragon.

The jade token Ye Xuan had given them was the last trump card of the Gongsun family, and they would never use it unless it was a life and death situation.

“Human! You’re pretty strong!”

A Yaksha expert with a terrifying aura suddenly joined the battle, swinging his trident at him.

“Fine! I’ll take you both on!”

The elder of the Gongsun family performed a number of hand seals to activate a martial technique to fight them.

With the passage of time, the war between the two races became more and more intense, and the situation of the human race became more and more tenuous.

Suddenly, space rippled, and a spatial crack appeared.

Jun Lingtian strode forward, his body covered in both his blood, as well as that of the sea race experts he had fought.

“Don’t use the jade token yet!”

Jun Lingtian wiped the blood from the corners of his mouth and looked at the grand elder of the Gongsun family not far away.

The grand elder was fighting with a flood dragon, and the fluctuations from their battle made their surroundings tremble.

It was the grand elder of the Gongsun family who had helped Ye Xuan back then. He was also the person in possession of the jade token.

The grand elder nodded.

Although Ye Xuan’s strength was terrifying and could even crush a large group of sea race King realm experts, he was still a single person. Even if he appeared, he might not be able to change the fate of the Nanzhou Region.

Of course, his appearance would make a large difference, but the jade token was the final hope and trump card of the Nanzhou Region, so there was no way he could waste it at this point.

However, the situation was becoming more and more dire. As time passed, more and more territories in the Nanzhour Region fell.

Meanwhile, the grand elder’s injuries were getting more and more serious.

Even though he was a half-step pattern condensation realm expert, he was fighting against two tenth-level unity realm experts and five-level grade unity realm experts.

Even when he asked for help, everyone was facing the same odds. They were all held back by the huge number of sea race experts.

Waves of powerful energy struck the grand elder’s body. Cracks appeared on his golden armored body, and his bone-deep wounds were ravaged by violent energy.
