“Although it’s unlikely, it seems to be the truth. The spiritual pressure Chief Ye Xuan is exuding is stronger than that of the law enforcement elder!”

Looking at the white-robed figure standing in the air, the crowd began to discuss this matter enthusiastically.

Ye Xuan’s appearance immediately attracted everyone’s attention.

Gao Shun naturally also noticed the discussion and was very dissatisfied.

In the past, this glory and respect belonged to him, but now it had been completely snatched away by Ye Xuan.

‘Hmph! I’ll let you be arrogant for a little while longer. You’ll suffer soon enough,” Gao Shun cursed inwardly.

At this moment, Gao Tianyu, who was standing behind Gao Shun, noticed Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun.

‘Interesting. I didn’t expect there to be such beautiful women in the Great Wilderness Divine sect.’

He licked his lips in anticipation. Then, he struck a pose that he thought made him look very handsome.

At the same time, Gao Tianyu made up his mind.

If he were to encounter these two girls during the Seven Peaks competition, he would not end the battle so early. He would tease them thoroughly.

At this moment, Ye Xuan took a step forward and brought Feng Xiyun, Zhuge Yueyue, and Su Changhe to the square. He stood beside Yuelun and the others.

“It seems that Junior Brother Ye is quite something, making us senior brothers and sisters wait for you,” Gao Shun looked at Ye Xuan indifferently and said in a strange tone.

Hearing this, Ye Xuan smiled.

“That’s only natural. After all, I’m more handsome!”

“You…”

Hearing Ye Xuan’s serious answer, Gao Shun almost blew his top.

“Senior brother, why are you so irritable today? Could it be that you’re dissatisfied with me? In that case… Why don’t you and I go at it? We can also have a little wager before the Seven Peaks competition,” Ye Xuan said as he looked at Gao Shun.

Gao Shun’s expression turned livid when he heard this. However, he had already played out a similar scenario in his mind countless times, and the result was the same.

He was no match for Ye Xuan at all.

As such, he had to endure.

What made Gao Shun most curious was that in just these few short months, what had Ye Xuan experienced?

How had his cultivation progressed so rapidly?

Furthermore, his Sword Dao seemed to have reached the point of perfection, and he had somehow managed to cultivate an immortal-grade palm technique.

“Hmph! You and I are fellow chiefs. There’s no point in fighting among ourselves.”

Gao Shun fiercely flicked his sleeves and hurriedly changed the topic.

Gao Tianyu could not help but speak up when he saw this.

“Martial Uncle Ye Xuan, aren’t you going too far? My father was just stating facts. You…”

However, before he could finish, Ye Xuan turned and looked at him indifferently.

“Who do you think you are, to speak to me like this?”

“If Senior Brother Gao lacked the time to discipline you, I don’t mind teaching you a lesson myself.”

“You…” Gao Tianyu’s eyes were filled with anger, but he was more afraid than angry.

How could he, a mere materialization realm expert, defeat a mystic lord realm expert?

Ye Xuan just glanced at the latter indifferently and then ignored him.

Ye Xuan’s gaze then fell on Feng Xiyun, Zhuge Yueyue, and Su Changhe.

“You guys stay here, and don’t run around.”

“En!” Feng Xiyun, Zhuge Yueyue, and Su Changhe all nodded respectfully.

After that, Ye Xuan walked towards the meeting hall, followed by the other chiefs of the Great Wilderness Divine sect.

Su Changhe exclaimed in excitement after Ye Xuan and the other chiefs left.

“As expected of Chief Ye Xuan. He was so domineering just now!”

“From today onward, who would dare to bully us?”

Su Changhe had become Ye Xuan’s die-hard fan. He even turned a blind eye to Gao Tianyu’s murderous gaze.

So what if he was angry? He was Chief Ye Xuan’s subordinate!

“Tsk! What’s the matter? Are you unhappy? If so, then come and hit me,” Su Changhe said arrogantly.

Gao Tianyu clenched his fists when he saw this. His eyes were filled with anger.

If he was allowed to, he would have torn Su Changhe apart.

Seeing this, Feng Xiyun smiled.

“Young Master Su, don’t get too agitated. If you’re not careful, someone might really be unable to hold it in and hit you. Teacher isn’t by our side, and I can’t protect you.”

“Hehe! What’s there to be afraid of? With Sister Yueyue by my side, I’m not afraid at all!”

One had to admit that Su Changhe’s ability to attract aggro was so strong that Gao Tianyu almost vomited blood.

“I’m so angry. Who exactly is this guy? How dare he insult Hidden Sword peak!”

“Look at him. He’s so despicable. I really want to kill him!”

Ignoring Gao Tianyu, the other disciples of Hidden Sword peak beside him almost flew into a rage.

Unfortunately, they could not do anything to Su Changhe despite their anger.

...

After all, Su Changhe had come with Ye Xuan, so he had to be a cultivator from Cloud Sky peak.

If even Chief Gao Shun did not dare to provoke Ye Xuan, then they definitely would not either.

When Zhuge Yueyue saw this scene, she covered her forehead helplessly. She was indeed rendered speechless by this guy’s shamelessness.

However, no matter what, this fellow had at least stood up for her teacher.

At that moment, Gao Tianyu’s eyes were filled with murderous intent as he stared at Su Changhe coldly.

He had a feeling that if this fellow continued to act up like this, he might really not be able to resist tearing Su Changhe apart.

As the eldest senior brother of Hidden Sword peak, he was second only to Hua Rufeng among the younger generation of cultivators of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, and was also the focus of everyone’s attention. He had never felt so aggrieved.

“Brat, you’ve done well. You’ve successfully ignited my anger!”

“I really can’t do anything to you today, but I hope you start thinking about what will happen to you in the future!”

“Hehe!” Su Changhe laughed when he heard that.

These lines were way too familiar!

...

They were the lines he often spouted to others back in his hedonistic days.

Hmph! When had he ever lost in terms of arrogance and posturing?

With Zhuge Yueyue as his backing, Su Changhe became even more arrogant and had no scruples. He let himself go.

“Hehe, I thought you were very powerful, but I didn’t expect you to only know how to threaten others.”

“Who doesn’t know how to spout such harsh words? I’ve been threatening people before the day you were born!”

“Listen to my words, young people shouldn’t be too restless. It’s easy for anger to consume your soul.”
