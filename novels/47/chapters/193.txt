Chapter 194: Equal Gifts

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Zhao Yuyan revealed a puzzled expression when she heard this. She had never seen her mother’s expression so serious.

“While I just discovered that you possess the Demon Devourer Body, and can silently devour the fate of others, I once saw a detailed record of fate in an ancient book. A cultivator will only die after all of the fate in their body has disappeared!”

“If your father really died because of your Demon Devourer Body, then he should have died in front of you. However, your father had already left the White Moon Tower, so how could he be affected by your constitution?”

“Even so, your father still died after being surrounded by demonic beasts!”

Lin Qingping stopped speaking.

Due to the Demon Devourer Body, her father’s fate would indeed be affected, but it would at most bring bad luck, and not to the point of death.

The reason why her father died was definitely related to the elders of the White Moon Tower.

Lin Qingping already had her suspicions.

Previously, the cultivators of the White Moon Tower kept cursing and harassing Zhao Yuyan. After Lin Qingping found out, she caused a huge ruckus in the White Moon Tower.

It appeared that Lin Qingping’s actions had thoroughly angered one of the elders of the White Moon Tower. That elder had even used their spiritual sense to send a voice transmission to Lin Qingping, saying, “Did you really think that your husband’s death was due to the encirclement of demonic beasts?”

Moreover, just before the voice transmission ended, that elder had even coldly laughed.

Immediately, Lin Qingping immediately guessed that her husband’s death had something to do with this elder.

However, Lin Qingping had no evidence to prove what the other party had done, so she could only endure it.

“Yan’er, remember, your father did not die because of you. Don’t blame yourself in the future!”

Lin Qingping gently patted Zhao Yuyan’s head.

Because of her father, this little girl had been blaming herself.

“Mother, is what you said true?”

Zhao Yuyan looked at Lin Qingping with confusion.

“You don’t need to know too much now. Wait for your teacher to come and pick you up first. When the time comes, Mother will tell you the whole truth!”

Lin Qingping did not want to reveal the matter of that elder too early. After all, their strength was too insignificant right now, and there was no way for them to take revenge. Furthermore, revealing the truth too early might stir up the evil intentions of that Elder.

More importantly, the reason why the mother and daughter were able to survive until now was because another elder was secretly taking care of them in the sect. This was also the real reason why Lin Qingping did not choose to leave the White Moon Tower.

Lin Qingping was indifferent to her own life and death, but she had to ensure the safety of her precious daughter.

Previously, when Zhao Yuyan went missing, Lin Qingping had also gone to look for this elder. However, his attention was not always on them, and similarly, he had not noticed Zhao Yuyan’s disappearance.

Moreover, who would have thought that this little girl would sneak into the mystic realm?

Fortunately, this little girl had encountered a very strong teacher. Not only did he infuse her with spiritual power, but he also taught her all kinds of high-level martial techniques and cultivation methods.

Someone who did not truly care about Zhao Yuyan would not have done all of that.

Lin Qingping did not expect Ye Xuan to avenge them. She only wanted Ye Xuan to bring Zhao Yuyan away safely.

In the future, when Zhao Yuyan grew up, she would naturally take revenge herself.

“Girl, did your teacher say when he would come to pick you up?” Lin Qingping asked.

“Uh… teacher didn’t say. He only said that he would come to pick me up as soon as possible after leaving the mystic realm!”

Zhao Yuyan also wanted to see Ye Xuan as soon as possible. She wanted her teacher to take her and her mother out of this troubled place.

…

Great Qian Dynasty, Qingyun sect, Lingjiu Peak.

As soon as Ye Xuan returned to the Azure Cloud sect, he called Yue and Li Qingyan to the cultivation room. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

He also calculated his harvest from exploring the mystic realm.

Mi Luo flower, Buddha Spirit Fruit, Dream Nebula Spirit Fruit, third-level sword intent, first-level fist intent, first-level heavenly lightning intent, and the Tower of Heaven.

Among them, the most precious ones were the heavenly lightning intent, soul condensation technique, and the Tower of Heaven.

After all, the Tower of Heaven itself contained many rare heavenly treasures. Originally, these natural treasures were used to reward those cultivators who challenged the Tower of Heaven.

However, now that Ye Xuan had obtained the ownership of the Tower of Heaven, these rewards naturally belonged to him.

The previous owner of the Tower of Heaven was the master of the Moon Demon Holy Land, and there were many precious resources inside, far more than he had obtained from the treasury of the Xuanyin sect back then.

As such, he had plenty to give his disciples. However, less than a month had passed since Ye Xuan had given the treasures to the two, so he chose to wait.

The reason why he called the two over was to teach them the cultivation method to temper their spiritual sense.

Of course, there were also heavenly treasures to improve their constitutions.

Previously in the mystic realm, Ye Xuan had received a reward from the system after giving Zhao Yuyan various heavenly treasures.

He planned to give some of these to Yue and Li Qingyan. Although they did not exactly need it at the moment, it was still a good opportunity to gain rewards from the system.

As for the spirit fruit that could strengthen her constitution, he would just give it to Li Qingyan when he was free in the future.

The most urgent thing now was to upgrade his Sword Overlord Body.

“Qingyan, your master gave the Sword Orchid Valley Lord to Yue earlier. It improved her special constitution. Now, I naturally can’t treat you unfairly, so I’ll give you this origin sword fruit!”

Ye Xuan waved his sleeve, and a fruit shaped like a long sword suddenly appeared and slowly fell into Li Qingyan’s hand.

“Thank you, Teacher!”

Stunned, she subconsciously took the origin sword fruit.

Although she also knew that this origin sword fruit was not very useful to her, how could she refuse her teacher’s gift?

Her teacher was too good. Even gifts were given equally!

“Ding! As the host has given his disciple the origin sword fruit, the host has received a randomized 156x critical reward. Congratulations, the host has obtained the void herb!”

At the same time, the system’s notification suddenly rang out in Ye Xuan’s mind.

Ye Xuan hurriedly checked the effects of the void herb. After seeing it, he almost laughed out loud.

The effect of the void herb was extremely powerful, especially for Sword Dao constitutions. Using it, Ye Xuan had a 100% chance of upgrading his Sword Overlord Body.

“Very good! This cheat-like system is too awesome!”

Ye Xuan smiled. However, there were still big things to do!

The method to temper one’s spiritual sense!
