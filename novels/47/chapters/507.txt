508 Zhuge Yueyue Versus Xie Tianyu (Part 2)

After Zhuge Yueyue dodged Xie Tianyu’s attack, she took a few steps back.

She was not in a hurry to attack, but was instead interested in testing Xie Tianyu’s strength.

“This is getting more and more interesting!”

Seeing Zhuge Yueyue easily dodge his attack, Xie Tianyu actually became excited.

!!

He had also sensed the woman’s strength from that short exchange.

Although this woman’s strength was very good among ordinary cultivators, she was still ordinary…

“That’s all? I’d like to see how you’re going to deal with this!”

Xie Tianyu snorted coldly and immediately swung his saber to send a mysterious saber beam toward Zhuge Yueyue.

The saber beam was like a thousand sabers that had merged into one.

After seeing this, Zhuge Yueyue narrowed her eyes. The saber beam had locked onto her position. There was no point dodging.

Originally, she wanted to continue testing Xie Tianyu’s strength. However, it seemed that this guy was impatient and was going in for the kill immediately.

She unsheathed the Cloud Sky sword and pointed it at Xie Tianyu.

“Since you’re so ruthless, don’t blame me for being impolite.”

This sentence was bone-chillingly cold, causing Xie Tianyu’s heart to tremble.

Zhuge Yueyue no longer concealed her strength. The cold aura surrounded her body, and everyone within a 10-meter radius felt a chill run down their spines, quite literally.

“What sort of divine power is that?”

The elder standing behind Xie Tianyu stared at Zhuge Yueyue in disbelief.

In an instant, she swung her sword and released a shockingly cold strike. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Everyone widened their mouths in shock.

“The power of a single sword strike can actually reach such a terrifying level?”

“The disciple of a sword immortal is truly extraordinary. She’s no different from a peerless genius.”

Xie Tianyu’s face paled.

His expression only lasted for a moment before he regained his determination. The stronger the opponent, the more it would stimulate his fighting spirit.

“Bring it on!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Xie Tianyu once again summoned the spiritual power in his body. One after another, powerful waves of energy surged towards Zhuge Yueyue like a tsunami.

This shocking attack was the result of using the Supreme Divine sect’s secret divine power!

Xie Tianyu raised the huge saber high up in the air, and then swung it fiercely down at the sword beams that Zhuge Yueyue had released.

Boom!

With a deafening sound, the ground began to shake violently.

However, the battle between the two of them had only just begun. The sword and saber beams collided with each other. The two sides were not inferior to each other in any way.

“He actually blocked it?”

Su Changhe muttered to himself with a dull look in his eyes. He had not expected Zhuge Yueyue’s heavenly slash to be so easily nullified.

It seemed that Xie Tianyu’s reputation as a genius was not just for show. He was indeed on par with Zhuge Yueyue.

“Sister Yueyue, you can definitely do it!”

Feng Xiyun clenched her fists tightly and started to cheer for Zhuge Yueyue.

She understood that the battle between Zhuge Yueyue and Xie Tianyu would affect the reputation of Cloud Sky peak.

If Zhuge Yueyue could not win this battle, then their teacher’s reputation would take a hit.

It was because of this that Feng Xiyun was extremely nervous.

She was inwardly angry at herself for not being strong enough to do anything in this situation.

Seeing her heavenly slash had been blocked, Zhuge Yueyue remained unfazed.

“Girl, if you have any other moves, then quickly use them. Otherwise, you won’t have the chance to!”

Xie Tianyu did not wait for an answer. He raised his saber and attacked again.

At this moment, the two geniuses seemed to have turned into afterimages, constantly colliding with each other.

However, as the battle progressed, the shock in Zhuge Yueyue’s heart increased.

Xie Tianyu’s strength was actually so overbearing. He could be considered the strongest opponent she had encountered so far.

Not only that, this person seemed to be well-versed and experienced when it came to fighting. There were very few openings she could exploit.

Left with no choice, Zhuge Yueyue could only defend for the time being while constantly searching for his flaws.

After fighting for a while, Xie Tianyu seemed to have lost all interest. He immediately launched a fierce attack, forcing Zhuge Yueyue to take a few steps back.

“Tsk! The first disciple of a sword immortal is actually nothing more than this!”

“Everyone says that Ye Xuan’s Sword Dao is superb, but why don’t I sense any trace of it from your attacks?”

As soon as he finished speaking, Zhuge Yueyue’s expression turned extremely cold.

“Fine, I won’t play with you anymore. If you can block this attack of mine, I’ll acknowledge you,” Xie Tianyu said mockingly, and then raised the saber in his hand and released a terrifying aura.

“Heavens!”

“Why does the saber in Young Master Xie’s hand have such a dense killing intent?”

...

“You’re so ignorant. That saber is the treasured saber of the Supreme Divine sect.”

“A few years ago, an expert from the Supreme Divine sect used this saber to kill countless enemies and accumulated a strong murderous aura.”

As the crowd was discussing this matter, Xie Tianyu was gathering his power.

A dragon seemed to have been condensed from thin air, exuding terrifying pressure

“Could it be… Is this the Azure Dragon Slash?” One of the cultivators said in shock. It was obvious that he had seen this technique before.

“It’s an earth-rank divine power from the Supreme Divine sect. Its power is terrifying!”

“I really didn’t expect Xie Tianyu to have completely mastered it!”

At this moment, many people began to sigh…
