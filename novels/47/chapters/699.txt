700 Kun Peng… Little Flying Bird?

At this moment, the five disciples were already on the verge of death, and were lying down on the ground like corpses.

“My goodness”

“Isn’t this too freaking scary?”

“She really did defeat all of them.”

!!

Everyone watching felt a chill run down their spines, especially Mu Beichen, who had been eliminated in advance. He suddenly felt very lucky to have been defeated by Zhuge Yueyue, otherwise, he would have been one of those lying down on the ground with the other five, forced to bear the ignominy of being beaten up by a six-year-old girl.

Furthermore, they had the numerical advantage too. How shameful!

“Damn it”

At this moment, Xu Changqing was livid. He stood up with difficulty, still trembling. The more he thought about it, the angrier he became.

As the eldest disciple of the Tianxia Academy, he could not tolerate this humiliation.

Without further hesitation, Xu Changqing took out another pill and consumed it to recover. After that, he once again stimulated his fighting spirit.

‘I’m a peak-level void realm expert! There’s no way I can’t compare to a mere void realm body refinement cultivator!’

Xu Changqing launched another attack.

When the other four people saw this scene, they also hurriedly consumed pills, striving to recover in the shortest time possible.

When she saw that this person was still daring enough to attack her, Xiang Yun’s gaze became even colder. Lin Qiaosheng had been the same as well, so she looked at Xu Changqing with disdain in her eyes.

“Die!”

After he roared, Xu Changqing’s sword instantly transformed into a Kun Peng and soared into the sky. This was the heaven-grade divine power of the Tianxia Academy, “Heaven-Defying Kun Peng!”

It even felt slightly more powerful than Mu Beichen’s Ten Thousand Swords’ Empire!

At this moment, Xiang Yun’s eyes that were filled with anger seemed to regain a trace of clarity.

Looking at the Kun Peng soaring in the sky, memories seemed to surge into her mind, causing her head to ache as if she had recalled something.

“Little Bird? Are you Little Flying Bird?”

Xiang Yun shouted happily. However, after hearing this, everyone was dumbfounded.

“F*ck! She even dares to call a ferocious beast like this Kun Peng a little flying bird?”

“No, you don’t look like Little Flying Bird. Little Flying Bird looks much better than you.”

Everyone was shocked.

Was this little girl saying that this Kun Peng was ugly?

This little girl was probably the first person who dared to say that since ancient times.

What was the background of this little girl? Why did she call this Kun Peng a little bird the moment she spoke?

Did she have a Kun Peng of her own before she reincarnated? If so, then there was nothing to say.

After she figured out that the Kun Peng that Xu Changqing had condensed this time was not the one from her memory, Xiang Yun became unhappy.

She raised her hammer and smashed it toward Xu Changqing without hesitation.

“Go to hell!”

The hammer expanded many times larger, and blotted out the sky and sun.

Then, the entire world seemed to tremble.

In that instant, the Kun Peng turned into fragments and scattered. The hammer smashed into his body, sending him flying thousands of miles away.

Outside the ancient realm, the space around the entrance twisted, and Liu Xinghe could not help but sigh with regret.

Xu Changqing dejectedly covered his face and walked over to Liu Xinghe.

“Teacher, I’m sorry. I didn’t win”

When Liu Xinghe saw his dejected eldest disciple, he felt helpless. Then, he turned around and looked at his second disciple.

Not long ago, this second disciple had been punished by him for that debacle with Xiang Yun at the heart-questioning stage. At this moment, his second disciple was still reflecting on his mistakes. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Changqing, it’s okay. I’ve seen your efforts. You didn’t embarrass me. ”

Liu Xinghe comforted him. At the very least, this disciple had not reenacted his second disciple’s shameful act.

They were both his disciples. Why was there such a huge difference between them?

His eldest disciple was willing to fight to the death in order to preserve the reputation of the Tianxia Academy, yet his second disciple tossed away the sect’s reputation the moment the situation turned unfavorable.
