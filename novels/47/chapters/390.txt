Ye Xuan then bade farewell to Yuelun.

“Senior Sister, now that the ape beast has been dealt with, I’m going to take Yueyue elsewhere to gain experience. We’ll meet again if fate allows it.”

“En!”

Yuelun nodded and did not ask him to stay.

However, when she saw Ye Xuan and Zhuge Yueyue leaving, she suddenly felt a sense of loss.

!!

This was especially so when she recalled how the trashy junior brother that she had looked down upon previously had displayed strength that far surpassed her own.

Her emotions were in a complicated state. She had an inexplicable premonition that the distance between her and Ye Xuan would only grow larger and larger in the future.

At this moment, the disciples behind Yuelun were in a heated discussion.

“Oh my God! Martial Uncle Ye is too powerful!”

“That sword qi just now was too overbearing!”

“Also, I’m not sure if you all noticed it, but he didn’t use any magic artifacts! He used that grass sword to suppress those cultivators!”

“Just thinking about it makes my blood boil!”

After a short while, Yuelun also left with Li Hanyi and the others.

However, after this incident, Ye Xuan’s fame began to spread throughout the Yangli divine empire, and even to the neighboring empires.

Now, people knew that in addition to Gongsun Shouyue and Gao Shun, there was another powerful chief in the Great Wilderness Divine sect.

In a certain place.

Many cultivators were gathered in a luxurious restaurant.

“Have you heard of Ye Xuan? It’s said that he’s one of the chiefs of the Great Wilderness Divine sect and is extremely powerful!”

“I’ve heard that in the battle with the ape beast, Ye Xuan severely injured two of the Xia family’s heaven realm experts with just one sword strike!”

“The most outrageous thing is that Ye Xuan used grass as a sword and didn’t even use a magic artifact. His strength is really terrifying!”

In this restaurant, many cultivators were in a heated discussion.

“He’s the master of Cloud Sky peak, and seems to be quite young. Furthermore, I heard people say that he’s quite handsome.”

“If we meet him in the future, we must be careful and not provoke such an existence. Otherwise, we might lose our lives!”

At this moment, in a private room on the top floor of the restaurant, a beautiful woman in a sky-blue robe and a veil elegantly raised the wine glass in her hand and slowly drank it.

Her mouth opened slightly, “Great Wilderness Divine sect, Ye Xuan, huh.” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Your Highness, what are you talking about?”

Seeing Feng Xiyun fall into a state of deep thought, her maidservant asked curiously.

Feng Xiyun smiled and said, “It’s nothing. I’m just curious if Ye Xuan whom those cultivators are talking about is as powerful as they make him out to be.”

When her maidservant Xin’er heard this, she tilted her head and pondered for a moment before speaking, “Your Highness, we’ve seen the strength of the Xia family’s heaven realm experts. Ye Xuan was able to defeat these two with one sword strike, so his strength must be terrifying!”

“Your Highness, weren’t you hesitating about which holy land to enter? It seems that the Great Wilderness Divine sect is a good choice!”

Hearing this, Feng Xiyun’s eyes instantly lit up.

“Xin’er, you’re right. The Great Wilderness Divine sect is indeed a good choice!”

The reason why Feng Xiyun was here was because she had secretly escaped.

It was common practice for empires to arrange political marriages. Now, in order to consolidate the power of the empire, her father wanted her to marry the prince of the Hanhai divine empire.

Feng Xiyun was very stubborn regarding certain matters, so how could she obey the arrangement of her father?

She knew that only by becoming strong enough could she reverse this fate.

Therefore, entering a top-tier holy land to cultivate was her best choice.

During this period of time, Feng Xiyun had visited many holy lands, but unfortunately, none of them met her expectations.

Hearing the rumors about Ye Xuan and the strength of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, Feng Xiyun became interested.

“There’s no hurry! I need to observe them carefully!”

Feng Xiyun blinked and stood up.

“Alright! We should leave now!”

Then, the two of them walked out of the restaurant.

As she had escaped, other than Xin’er, Feng Xiyun did not even have a single guard by her side.

Moreover, in order to avoid trouble and to prevent her identity as a princess from being exposed, Feng Xiyun chose to wear a white veil to cover her face.

Two hours later, Feng Xiyun and Xin’er’s carriage slowly arrived at the border of the territory.

However, at this moment, the carriage suddenly came to a stop. Xin’er’s face turned pale.

“Your Highness, I’m sorry. We’re in trouble!”

When Feng Xiyun heard this, she could not help but raise her brows. After that, she opened the curtains of the carriage. Her gaze scanned the surroundings, and her brows immediately furrowed.

A pair of blood-red eyes suddenly appeared in her field of vision.

‘This is the edge of the East continent. The holy lands should have killed most of the berserk beasts.’

‘Logically speaking, there shouldn’t be any berserk beasts here!’

Feng Xiyun’s heart was filled with suspicion. Ever since she had escaped the palace, she had never encountered a berserk beast.

Furthermore, Xin’er was only a ninth-level mystic meridian realm cultivator, while she herself was an ordinary mortal.

At this moment, Feng Xiyun was flustered.

“Red Hell Snake!”

The beast with blood-red eyes was a Red Hell Snake that was flicking its tongue. It was currently looking at Feng Xiyun with a cold gaze.
