506 Supreme Divine Sect, Xie Tianyu

Hearing this, Feng Xiyun hurriedly looked around, and found that she indeed saw many familiar faces.

Mu Beichen, the Saint of the Heavenly Mountain Divine sect.

The Reincarnation Fairy, the Saintess of the Jade Lake Divine sect.

Even the top talents of the Tianxia Academy had come…

!!

When Zhuge Yueyue saw this scene, she fell into a state of deep thought.

Had it been a month ago, she would not have been able to compete against these peerless geniuses.

However, thanks to her teacher, heer strength had advanced by leaps and bounds, and there was not much difference between her and these peerless geniuses.

However, this also meant that when the ancient tomb was fully opened, these geniuses would be her competitors.

In other words, when the ancient tomb opened, it would be the time for all of the peerless geniuses to fight for supremacy!

Zhuge Yueyue was confident in herself. During this period of time, she had been working hard on her cultivation and had already reached the void realm.

Furthermore, she had increased her level of mastery of the hell slash.

At the thought of this, a rare smile appeared on Zhuge Yueyue’s cold face.

‘No matter how strong my opponent is, I will not disappoint my teacher and I will not embarrass Cloud Sky peak!’

Compared to Zhuge Yueyue’s desire to win, Feng Xiyun was more relaxed. She looked around indifferently.

“They’ve sent out quite a number of experts this time. It seems like it’s a rare occasion in the East Continent.”

Su Changhe crossed his arms with an indifferent expression on his face.

“I don’t care which top holy land or ancient family they’re from. If they dare to mess with us, they’ll be beaten up by Sister Yueyue! To me, Sister Yueyue is the most powerful genius in the East continent!”

Hearing this, Zhuge Yueyue’s face darkened helplessly.

Why did this fellow always like to use others to act cool?

When Feng Xiyun heard this, she immediately became dissatisfied.

“Is Sister Yueyue the only peerless genius? Am I really that bad? Hmm?”

“Hehe! How is that possible? Big Sister Xiyun is also very outstanding! With your talent, perhaps you’ll be able to become an immortal in the future,” Su Changhe said flatteringly.

At this moment, an enigmatic voice suddenly spoke up from behind them.

“The world today is really shocking. Some random people from a barbaric land actually claim to have the talent required to become immortals!”

As soon as the voice finished speaking, Zhuge Yueyue and the others frowned.

Su Changhe, in particular, was displeased. He turned around to look.

A handsome man in a black and white robe suddenly appeared in his field of vision.

Su Changhe was stunned when he saw the man.

“Xie Tianyu from the Supreme Divine sect?”

Su Changhe was no stranger to this man. He was a peerless genius who was as famous as Mu Beichen and the Reincarnation Fairy. He was also the Saint of the Supreme Divine sect.

Why was this guy here?

Su Changhe’s expression suddenly became flustered. Although he was arrogant, he was not arrogant enough to go against Xie Tianyu.

His own status as the young master of the Su family was worthless in comparison.

Although he had always been by Ye Xuan’s side, Ye Xuan had never indicated that he would take Su Changhe in as a disciple.

Therefore, Su Changhe’s identity had not changed much.

Helplessly, he could only suppress the dissatisfaction in his heart.

When Zhuge Yueyue saw this, she was puzzled. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Give Su Changhe’s personality, he should have immediately retorted. Why did he become so cowardly?

Su Changhe noticed the change in Zhuge Yueyue’s expression and quickly explained in a whisper, “Sister Yueyue, this guy is the Saint from the Supreme Divine sect. His name is Xie Tianyu. He’s as strong as Mu Beichen and the Reincarnation Fairy.”

“Also, he’s a vengeful person. To be safe, it’s better not to provoke him.”

When Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun heard this, they understood his hesitation.

“Xie Tianyu?” Zhuge Yueyue’s brows immediately furrowed. This guy clearly came here with ill intentions. However, after thinking about it carefully, now that her teacher was not by her side, it was better not to cause trouble.

However, although Zhuge Yueyue and the others decided not to pursue the matter, Xie Tianyu did not think the same. His lips curled into a cold smile.

“I’ve heard of your name. You’re the first disciple of Cloud Sky peak, Zhuge Yueyue, right?”

Hearing this, Zhuge Yueyue nodded her head indifferently, but did not say anything.

However, Xie Tianyu’s lips curved into a mocking smile.

“It’s said that Chief Ye Xuan of the Cloud Sky peak is a sword immortal who has reached the apex of the Sword Dao. However, I wonder how much of his teachings have been passed on to his disciple.”

“Or is his reputation as a teacher nothing but hot air?”

As soon as he finished speaking, Zhuge Yueyue’s eyes turned cold.

She would never tolerate anyone who insulted her teacher. Such words would only be answered by her sword.

“Won’t you find out for yourself once you try me?”

Zhuge Yueyue took a step forward, and the profound ice divine bone in her body released a terrifying cold power. The surrounding temperature dropped instantly.

When the other cultivators saw this, they started making space for the inevitable fight.

“Oh?” The corner of Xie Tianyu’s mouth curled up.

...

“It seems that you are quite confident in yourself, but your courage means nothing in the face of absolute strength!”

“Very well! Prepare yourself!”
