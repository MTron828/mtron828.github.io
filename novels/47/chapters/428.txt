429 Epiphany?

For a moment, everyone’s eyes fell on Gongsun Shouyue, and Gao Shun’s expression became even more unsightly.

“Senior Brother Gongsun, when did you take in such a talented disciple? You even had him secretly cultivate on Cloud Sky peak. Were you afraid of us finding out?”

Liang Dahai and Gao Xiangyu, who were beside him, were also a little unhappy.

Liang Dahai said, “Senior Brother, didn’t you promise not to take in any more disciples?”

!!

“You secretly recruited another talented disciple. What about the other peaks?”

“We’ve been in the same sect for hundreds of years. Shouldn’t you take our feelings into account?”

Gongsun Shouyue was confused.

What the f*ck was going on? nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Ever since he had taken Hua Rufeng as his disciple, he had not taken in any other disciples for many years.

“Junior Brother Ye, don’t scare me. Hurry up and explain”

Cold sweat broke out on Gongsun Shouyue’s forehead as he looked to Ye Xuan for help.

Wait… It seemed that he really did have a disciple on Cloud Sky peak.

Just as Gongsun Shouyue was finally about to connect the dots, Ye Xuan said with a smile, “Why don’t you go and see for yourself?”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan turned his body slightly, and then a handsome young man in green suddenly appeared in everyone’s field of vision.

“Isn’t that Martial Nephew Hua Rufeng?”

Everyone’s expression changed when they saw this.

It turned out that the sect master’s disciple Ye Xuan was talking about was Hua Rufeng.

“Oh my God, Brother did it!”

When Li Hanyi, who was next to Yuelun, saw this, she was astonished and shocked.

She had originally thought that the phenomenon was caused by one of Cloud Sky peak’s disciples. She had not expected that the source of the phenomenon to be her own brother.

When Gongsun Shouyue saw this, he was equally shocked.

As Hua rufeng’s teacher, he was very familiar with Hua Rufeng’s level of talent.

Hua Rufeng had only reached the fifth level of the materialization realm. How could he cause such a phenomenon?

“Junior Brother Ye, what happened?”

Gongsun Shouyue’s expression suddenly became serious.

At the same time, everyone’s attention turned to Ye Xuan, as they stared at him curiously.

What had happened to Hua Rufeng to cause such a phenomenon?

Seeing this, Ye Xuan said lightly, “It’s not a big deal. I just gave him a few words of advice, and then he had an epiphany.”

“Uh…”

Could he be more serious? What did he mean by that? He gave a few pointers and the other person had an epiphany?

F*ck!

If epiphanies were so easy to come by, then he should give some to them!

“It really is an epiphany!”

Yuelun was shocked when she examined Hua Rufeng.

“It’s really unbelievable. An epiphany is a rare phenomenon that only happens once in a hundred years. I didn’t expect Martial Nephew Rufeng to experience one.”

“What did this guy say to Hua Rufeng to elicit an epiphany?”

Everyone’s hearts were filled with doubt.

Of course, Gongsun Shouyue was the most curious one.

After all, it was his disciple who was experiencing an epiphany, and he as the teacher had nothing to do with it.

Everyone’s eyes fell on Ye Xuan again.

The useless chief of Cloud Sky peak, who was once ridiculed by everyone, had actually hidden himself so well.

Gao Shun, Liang Dahai, and the others’ expressions immediately turned serious.

Was this really the young man that Chief Tian Xuan brought back a hundred years ago?

His transformation was simply unbelievable!

Their hearts were filled with shock.

Just then, Gongsun Shouyue also came back to his senses. He looked deeply at Ye Xuan, and then at Hua Rufeng, who was sitting cross-legged in the courtyard. A touch of satisfaction flashed across the depths of his eyes.

It seemed that his previous guess was correct.

He had to pay close attention to Cloud Sky peak.

Ye Xuan’s strength was extremely terrifying, and had now reached the same level as him. In addition, his disciples were all peerless geniuses with outstanding levels of talent.

Everything else aside, the sect had to provide sufficient cultivation resources.

Gongsun Shouyue quickly made a decision.
