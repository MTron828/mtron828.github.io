415 Words That Make One Tremble

However, now that the cultivators of the Immortal Divine sect had arrived, there was naturally no point in him taking action.

When Sun Mobai heard these words, he was stunned. He had just arrived at Qingyang City and immediately discovered that Mu Beichen was about to attack Lin Dong. Hence, he hurriedly came over to stop him.

However, he was not very clear about the reason behind the altercation.

“Lin Dong, what exactly happened?”

Lin Dong’s body involuntarily trembled, and his face was filled with fear. However, in the end, he did not dare to hide anything.

!!

After finding out the truth, Sun Mobai’s expression turned cold. When his gaze fell on Zhuge Yueyue in the crowd, he shivered involuntarily.

“He’s really a traitorous disciple!”

Sun Mobai immediately flew into a rage and slapped Lin Dong without the slightest hesitation.

His tyrannical palm ruthlessly slammed onto Lin Dong’s face, causing the latter’s face to immediately deform. A few of his teeth even fell out as he was ruthlessly slapped onto the ground.

When Lin Youming, who was at the side, saw this, he was dumbfounded.

What was going on?

Sun Mobai was an elder of the Immortal Divine sect, so why would he be afraid of Ye Xuan?

Could Ye Xuan’s strength be that terrifying?

However, he did not dare to voice any complaints, despite seeing Lin Dong being slapped. After all, Sun Mobai was his son’s master.

After doing all this, Sun Mobai hurriedly walked toward Zhuge Yueyue and said with a face full of sincerity, “Young ladies, it’s all because I failed to discipline him strictly that he dared to attempt such a heinous crime. I hope that you both can spare him this time for my sake.”

“In the future, I will definitely discipline him strictly. Such a thing will definitely not happen again!”

Actually, Zhuge Yueyue did not have any objections. After all, she did not want to cause too much trouble for her teacher.

However, Feng Xiyun’s mouth curved into a beautiful arc as she said with a playful smile, “Elder Sun, even though you are of great standing, trying to resolve this matter with just a few words is still rather inappropriate, is it not?”

As soon as she finished speaking, Sun Mobai’s face immediately darkened. However, when he recalled Ye Xuan’s terrifying strength, he could only suppress the anger in his heart.

Although Sun Mobai could endure it, the other two elders of the Immortal Divine sect could not.

“Hmph! A little kid who hasn’t seen much of the world actually dares to haggle with us?”

“Do you really think that the Immortal Divine sect is afraid of the Great Wilderness Divine sect? Do you really think that Ye Xuan can protect you?”

“Hmph! Even if Ye Xuan was here today, he wouldn’t dare to shout at me. Who do you think you are?”

As soon as he said this, the surrounding atmosphere suddenly turned oppressive.

“Interesting! Could it be that the Immortal Divine sect is going to act against the Great Wilderness Divine sect?” Seeing this, everyone revealed a look of anticipation.

“I will say whatever I want to say. What’s it to you?”

Seeing the other party’s overbearing stance, Feng Xiyun could not hold it in, especially given the fact that the elder had disregarded her teacher.

Feng Xiyun would never allow anyone to insult her teacher, who she considered her savior.

“You really don’t know how vast the world is, little girl. Even the sect master of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, Gongsun Shouyue, has to be polite to me, let alone a little girl like you.”

Feng Xiyun’s gaze instantly turned cold when she heard this.

Her spiritual sense suddenly entered the storage ring, preparing to shatter a communication talisman.

As long as she did so, the general assigned to Qingyang City would immediately receive the news and come to her aid.

This was actually Feng Xiyun’s trump card.

Any soldiers and generals that received the special signal from the communication talisman had to rush over without hesitation.

Just as she was about to shatter the communication talisman, the situation changed again.

“You guys from the Immortal Divine sect are quite arrogant!”

“Who is it?”

Everyone’s expression changed when they heard this. This voice seemed to come from dozens of miles away, and contained a trace of spiritual pressure in itself.

The elder who had spoken earlier, Li Siyuan, was shocked.

He could tell that the spiritual pressure originated from a mystic lord realm expert.

“How is that possible? A mystic lord realm expert has appeared!”

On the tall building, Mu Beichen and the Reincarnation Fairy, as well as their entourage, were all shocked.

“Uncle Situ, is this person very strong?”

The Reincarnation Fairy whispered the question.

Her guardian, Situ Mo, was shocked. He could clearly sense the spiritual pressure from the voice.

“That person is a mystic lord realm expert,” Situ Mo said with a serious expression.

“His strength is extremely terrifying. The spiritual pressure I’m sensing is as sharp as a sword.” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

As soon as he finished speaking, dazzling sword qi descended from the sky like a torrent toward Li Siyuan.

“Senior Brother!”

Sun Mobai’s expression changed when he saw this. He quickly joined hands with Li Siyuan and the other elder to resist the terrifying sword qi.

Boom!

The two powerful energies collided with each other, and the violent shockwaves rippled out in every direction.

The hard ground cracked open, and many buildings were turned into dust.

Sun Mobai and the others had used all of their strength to barely block the sword qi.
