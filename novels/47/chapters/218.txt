Chapter 219: Choice

The Elder Gongsun they were talking about was the law enforcement elder of the Nether God sect.

He was a terrifying existence whose cultivation had reached the ninth-level of the unity realm, and extremely close to being immortal!

“Sect Master is in secluded cultivation, so you should stay back to inform him, Elder Chen. We’ll go and support Elder Gongsun!”

“By the way, Elder Chen, inform the Blood Moon Temple and Yunjin Temple of Ye Xuan’s strength!”

“We’ve already suffered so many losses. We can’t afford to make another mistake!”

“Even if this fellow’s strength is only at the seventh level of the unity realm, we cannot underestimate him!”

“This matter is related to the survival of our sect, after all.”

The group of five then split up. Four of them pursued Ye Xuan, while one returned to the Nether God sect.

Ye Xuan was no longer someone they could treat lightly and, given his potential, they had to mobilize in full force to get rid of him before he became a serious threat to the sect’s existence.

Even though they were confident that Elder Gongsun could handle Ye Xuan, they still sent someone back to request the sect master to take action personally, and also informed the other forces that wanted revenge on Ye Xuan regarding their findings.

Those two forces would then be able to make the appropriate adjustments to their plan. If these three forces took action, Ye Xuan’s demise would be sealed in stone.

After they left, Dai Weibo collapsed to the ground, panting heavily. His eyes were filled with lingering fear. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

There were three forces after Ye Xuan!

The Nether God sect, the Blood Moon Temple, and Yunjin Temple, none of which were to be trifled with.

…

On the way back to the Great Qian Dynasty, Ye Xuan began his cultivation anew on the back of the black flame eagle.

Before that, he had checked out the loot he had obtained from killing Li Tiangang.

However, the treasures inside could not be compared to his biggest gains, which were the third-level fist intent, as well as the wind intent.

In any case, the loot simply added to his stockpile of heavenly treasures that he had inside the Tower of Heaven.

Of the treasures he examined, he found something quite useful.

It was an extremely precious and rare spiritual item…

The spirit of life!

“This is an unexpected surprise!”

Ye Xuan smiled.

According to the ancient records, in a place where there was dense spiritual energy, thousands of spirit herbs would transform into an extremely precious spiritual item after countless years.

The spirit of life looked like a young sprouting plant that had just emerged from the ground, but it was actually filled with rich spiritual energy.

If he allowed it to for another few thousand years, it was possible that the spirit of life would take on a physical form and transform into a divine tree of life.

Even though the spirit of life had yet to mature, it still contained vast amounts of wood-type spiritual energy, which made it perfect for improving a wood-type special constitution.

Ye Xuan had previously obtained the red jade spirit fruit, which could strengthen fire-type special constitutions.

Combined with the spirit of life, he would be able to improve his innate dual-spirit body.

He had already tasted the sweet benefits of upgrading a special constitution after his Sword Overlord body underwent a transformation, so he was very much looking forward to having another special constitution upgraded.

What kind of changes would it bring to his strength?

In any case, a few days ago, Ye Xuan had given Yue treasures that could improve their special constitutions, which was how he had obtained the Void Herb.

As such, he was unable to reap the system’s rewards from her for the time being.

Ye Xuan had three choices.

First, he could wait 30 days to give them to Yue, and then Li Qingyan, double-dipping on the system’s rewards.

Second, he could give them to Li Qingyan and help her refine them. When Li Qingyan’s dual-spirit body was strengthened, he would receive the system’s reward.

Third, he could refine these two heavenly treasures right now to improve his innate dual-spirit body.

While maximizing the rewards was good and all, this was a critical period, and he was being targeted by three terrifying forces, and he did not have much time to spare.

Still, he should have time to help Li Qingyan refine them, so he chose the second option.

Although the red jade spirit fruit and the spirit of life were extremely precious, he did not really care about them.

Strength was paramount, so as long as they contributed to the advancement of his cultivation, using them was fine.

He would find more heavenly treasures sooner or later anyway.

The most important thing now was to deal with the three major forces targeting him.

While he had the pattern condensation realm offensive jade token, it was ultimately not his own strength, and was a consumable.
