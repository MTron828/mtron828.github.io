595 The Reappearance Of The Strange Power (Part 2)

The moment the black mist was absorbed into his body, Mo Nan’s cultivation level rose, and reached the peak of the supreme realm.

It had to be admitted that this strange power was truly terrifying. It was just that Ye Xuan was not sure of its origins.

That being said, that increase in power came at a cost. After absorbing this power, in the long run, even one’s own consciousness would be devoured. It was somewhat similar to the forbidden technique that Gao Shun had used previously, except this one damaged the mind and consciousness instead of one’s body and cultivation foundation.

Ye Xuan stared fixedly at Mo Nan and suddenly thought of the berserk beasts’ attack back then.

“Where did you get that strange power?”

“Was the berserk beasts’ attack some time ago your doing?”

“Hehe, you guessed it right. That incident was indeed my handiwork.”

“At that time, I was absorbing this strange power and needed to obtain a lot of blood in order to disperse the side effects.”

“Without that incident, I’m afraid I would have already been controlled by this strange power.”

Now that he had reached the peak of the Supreme realm, Mo Nan was certain of his victory, and spoke openly. After all, he would just have to kill Ye Xuan and everyone present to keep the news from spreading.

At that moment, Mo Nan’s face was dark as he gritted his teeth and said, “A long time ago, I was also a one-in-a-million top-genius!”

“However, your damn teacher appeared and defeated me time and time again!”

“He’s always been above me for hundreds of years, making me the eternal runner-up.”

“Ever since he defeated me, no matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t defeat him. Thus, I’ve lived in his shadow my whole life.”

“When people talk about unparalleled experts, they will only mention Tian Xuan’s name, not mine!”

After saying that, Mo Nan’s expression crumbled.

Due to Tian Xuan’s existence and feats, no one would remember him.

Ye Xuan could actually understand his helplessness. After all, in this world, only the winner mattered. No one would care about the runner-up.

It was for this reason that the other cultivators in the same generation as Tian Xuan had all become nobodies in the minds of cultivators.

Mo Nan had been nursing this grudge for a long time.

“And because of that, when you found this strange power, in order to absorb this power into your body, you caused that incident?”

Ye Xuan asked with a cold expression.

He clearly remembered that Zhuge Yueyue’s parents had died in the incident, along with countless other innocent people.

It was thanks to the contamination of that strange power that the beasts invaded the territory of the humans and caused a massacre.

“Hehe!”

Mo Nan laughed triumphantly, before continuing, “So what? My life was supposed to be over, but I discovered this strange power by chance!”

“In a desert, there is a secret realm that is connected to a strange realm. In this secret realm, this strange power emerged.”

“I’m sure you’ve experienced how terrifying this strange power is. It took me a long time to create a small opening to the secret realm.”

Ye Xuan was stunned, but before he could say anything, Mo Nan continued, “After obtaining this strange power, I went into seclusion to research how to use it.”

“To ensure that nothing went wrong, I didn’t absorb it rashly. Instead, I allowed my disciple to find the location of the secret realm.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“As I expected, he was overjoyed to obtain this power and absorbed it into his body without thinking.”

At that moment, Ye Xuan had goosebumps all over his body.

The disciple he was talking about was probably Elder Taiyin.

Was Mo Nan’s heart black? He had actually harmed his own disciple like this in order to research the effects of the strange power.

How could he be so heartless?

Ye Xuan thought of his two disciples. He would never be able to do such an evil thing to them,

Ye Xuan’s blood ran cold. Meeting such a teacher was truly unlucky.

Mo Nan was not bothered by Elder Taiyin’s death at all.

After all, only his cultivation and the Immortal Divine sect’s legacy mattered to him. He believed that this strange power would allow him to preserve both.

“After my disciple absorbed this strange power, I also discovered the side effects of absorbing this power.”

“Therefore, after painstaking research and looking through information, I finally found a way to deal with it.”

“This method is to use fresh blood to refine and transform one’s body, baptizing it with the strange power.”
