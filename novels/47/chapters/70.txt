Chapter 71: Advanced Stage Of The Golden Core Realm

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

To give a simple example, Yue’s previous innate bone value was 329. After refining the mysterious power of the Dark Glacial Frost, her innate bone value had increased by eight points.

However, if it had been Ye Xuan absorbing the Dark Glacial Frost instead, it would already be a great fortune if he managed to increase his innate bone value by one point. Moreover, there was a high possibility that his innate bone value would not change at all.

There was no helping it. Ye Xuan’s innate bone value was too ridiculous, which would result in the effect of the Dark Glacial Frost on him to be greatly reduced.

However, if it was a cultivator whose innate bone value was only 20 who was absorbing the Dark Glacial Frost, the increase in their innate bone value should be somewhere between 10 to 20 points.

Along with the increase in a cultivator’s innate bone value and comprehension value, the effect of these rare spiritual treasures would also decrease.

Especially when the cultivator’s comprehension and innate bone value reached the critical 500-point mark, the decrease would be even more obvious.

Ye Xuan could now clearly sense the scattered spiritual energy of Heaven and Earth, and he could clearly distinguish which areas had the densest spiritual energy. He could even judge based on the degree of the density of spiritual energy, what level of cultivation a place was suitable for. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

This knowledge and judgment came to him naturally. Other than that, he did not need to take the initiative to cultivate at all. The pores around his body would automatically absorb and refine the spiritual energy of Heaven and Earth and slowly fuse it into his golden core.

In other words, he had reached the point where he could autopilot his cultivation, if he so desired.

However, if he chose to cultivate manually, the speed of his cultivation would be even more shocking. Even if he did not rely on the system’s reward, and even if he did not continue to refine the medicinal effects of the seventh-grade Nirvana pill, he was confident that he could reach the advanced stage of the golden level realm within ten days.

Then, Ye Xuan’s spiritual sense slowly withdrew from the system space.

“Before the Qingyun sect competition, you have to increase your strength!”

“Yue, quickly take out the origin condensing pill from before. I will help you refine it!”

Ye Xuan’s gaze fell on Yue.

“Alright, Teacher!”

Yue nodded obediently, and then she took out the origin condensing pill from her spatial storage equipment.

This was what Ye Xuan had given her previously and, from the reward from the system, Ye Xuan had obtained an even more advanced pill, but he had exchanged it for the Dark Glacial Frost with Huang Ling.

Moreover, Ye Xuan had already understood how to somewhat exploit the system. As long as he helped Yue refine the medicinal power of the origin condensing pill, he would also be able to obtain a system reward from when Yue’s cultivation increased.

This could be said to be killing two birds with one stone.

Immediately, Ye Xuan’s surging golden core power gushed out, transforming into a gentle power that wrapped around the origin condensing pill. After refining it, it was slowly injected into Yue’s body.

“Ding! As the host has helped his disciple obtain 20 days’ worth of cultivation, the host has received a randomized 18x critical reward. Congratulations to the host for obtaining 360 days’ worth of cultivation!”

When Yue had completely absorbed the medicinal effects of the origin condensing pill, the system’s notification suddenly rang out in Ye Xuan’s mind.

“As expected!” Seeing this, Ye Xuan could not help but smile.

His guess was indeed correct.

With Ye Xuan’s help, Yue managed to perfectly absorb the medicinal effects of the origin condensing pill, and had advanced to the sixth level of the truth essence realm.

“I’m still half a step away from breaking through myself!”

Ye Xuan examined his own cultivation level and then murmured.

Although he had gained 360 days’ worth of cultivation, the increase was not that significant. After all, the cultivation boost reward he obtained was calculated according to Yue’s cultivation speed and not his own.

This was completely opposite to the effect of spiritual power infusion. The cultivation obtained through spiritual power infusion was calculated according to Ye Xuan’s own cultivation speed.

Although Yue’s innate bone value was not low, she was still only a truth essence realm cultivator. Even if she trained hard for a year, it was only equivalent to three or four days’ worth of Ye Xuan’s secluded cultivation.

After all, Ye Xuan’s innate bone value had exceeded 500.

“Qingyan, it’s your turn!”

Ye Xuan’s gaze fell on Li Qingyan next, motioning for the latter to take out the pill he had given her.

Seeing this, Li Qingyan was startled. Could it be that her teacher was going to help her raise her cultivation level again?

Was this not a little too fast? How did I manage to meet such a good teacher? Am I allowed to fall in love with him?

Li Qingyan immediately revealed a sweet smile, and then she took out the pill that Ye Xuan had given her earlier.

“Ding! As the host has helped his disciple obtain 35 days’ worth of cultivation, the host has randomized 15x critical reward. Congratulations to the host for obtaining 525 days’ worth of cultivation!”

Boom!

As soon as the system notification ended, Ye Xuan’s body suddenly shook, and the aura in his dantian swept out like waves.

Originally, he had only been half a step away from the advanced stage of the golden core realm. Now that he had obtained 525 days’ worth of cultivation, he naturally reached into the advanced stage of the golden core realm!

“Teacher!”

Seeing this, Yue and Li Qingyan were shocked.

This terrifying aura… could it be that Teacher had broken through again?

“Hahaha, I didn’t expect that, while helping you to increase your cultivation levels, I also gained some insights and advanced a minor realm!”

“Today is really a good day. Triple happiness!”

Looking at his two shocked disciples, Ye Xuan made up nonsense to cover his tracks.

What did he mean by having gained some insights and advancing a minor realm? Was this something that a normal person could do?

However, Yue and Li Qingyan did not question Ye Xuan’s words. After all, in their eyes, their teacher’s words represented absolute truth.

Then, Ye Xuan waved his sleeve, and the surging aura was immediately drawn back into his body.

“I almost forgot about the aura concealing technique!”

Suddenly, Ye Xuan rubbed his forehead after remembering something important.

When he had taught Yue the qi storage technique earlier, he had obtained the aura concealing technique through the system’s reward, but he had yet to teach it to Li Qingyan.

“Qingyan, I will now teach you a secret technique that can help you conceal your aura!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan stretched out his hand and gently pointed his finger between Li Qingyan’s eyebrows. The aura concealing technique was transmitted into her mind.

“Ding! As the host has imparted the aura concealing technique to his disciple, the host has received a randomized 20x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the Nihility technique!”

Compared to the aura concealing technique, the Nihility technique was undoubtedly of a higher grade.

As long as one cultivated it, not only would one be able to perfectly conceal their own aura, but they would also be able to assimilate themselves with their surroundings. In addition, one could also use this secret technique to place one’s body in a state of suspended animation.

Once one’s body fell into a state of suspended animation, the effect of time on one’s body would be reduced.

To give a simple example, a golden core realm cultivator originally only had a lifespan of about 700 years. If that cultivator cultivated the Nihility technique, and placed their body into a state of suspended animation, they would be able to live for thousands of years!

In other words, after that cultivator woke up, it was very likely that thousands of years would have passed.

Of course, it was far more difficult to cultivate the Nihility technique compared to the aura concealing technique.

However, for Ye Xuan, this was not difficult at all.

Ye Xuan looked at Yue and noticed that the latter was still stabilizing her cultivation. He reached out and gently tapped his finger on the latter’s forehead, transmitting the aura concealing technique to her.
