586 The Crown Prince Arrives (Part 2)

Feng Lu was forced to admit defeat. He lowered his head and said to Feng Tianyi.

“Greetings, Crown Prince.” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

He bowed respectfully, but his expression was extremely dark.

Li Kun was also very shocked at this time. He suddenly realized that the young man that his men had just surrounded was really an existence that he could not provoke!

!!

At this moment, he felt immense regret. He looked at Feng Lu unhappily.

Although he personally had not made a move, his and his legion’s presence here already spoke volumes. There was no way to explain their way out of this situation.

“Greetings, Crown Prince. I just happened to come here to support Prince Zhanglu. This matter has nothing to do with me!”

Li Kun was so scared that he broke out in a cold sweat. He immediately tried to clear his name. At the very least, he did not want to lose his life or even his position as general.

“Hahaha!”

Feng Tianyi laughed and stared at the two of them coldly.

“Do the two of you even know who you provoked today?”

Hearing this, the two of them immediately shivered and said, “We’re not sure… Who is he?”

Hearing this, Feng Tianyi walked toward them and said coldly, “He’s the chief of the Great Wilderness Divine sect’s Cloud Sky peak.”

“You two really have guts, don’t you? Of all people to provoke, why did you have to provoke a supreme realm expert? Are you two in a hurry to visit the netherworld?”

When they heard Feng Tianyi reveal who Ye Xuan was, everyone present was speechless and shocked.

“F*ck!”

“That young man is actually Sword Immortal Ye?”

“He’s so young!”

They had long heard of Ye Xuan’s fame, but there were very few people who could recognize him, which was why they were so shocked when they heard Feng Tianyi reveal Ye Xuan’s identity.

Feng Lu’s expression was ashen, and he fell to the ground weakly.

‘This can’t be happening. The guy I provoked is actually a supreme realm expert?”

At that moment, Feng Lu wanted to bang his head against a wall.

Li Kun’s face was also very pale. He wanted nothing more than to beat Feng Lu up for dragging him into this matter.

What was a heaven realm expert like him going to do against a supreme realm expert anyway? Throw eggs at him?

He was like an ant in front of Ye Xuan.

Li Kun knelt down in front of Feng Tianyi and begged, “Crown Prince, you have to save me…”

I have parents and children to take care of, and it was Prince Zhanglu who summoned me here. I didn’t know that this was the legendary Chief Ye Xuan.”

“I’m begging you, Crown Prince. I have worked hard for many years for the Yangli divine empire. You have to save my life.”

“I still have much more to give to the empire.”

At this point, he was kneeling down and begging for mercy. In fact, it would be funny if anyone in his position did not do the same. It was a matter of life and death, and he had not been the main perpetrator anyway.

“Li Kun!”

After seeing Li Jun expose him without any hesitation, Feng Lu gritted his teeth in anger, but before he could say anything, Li Kun quickly scolded him.

“You dare to criticize me? I’ve treated you as my good friend, but you?”

“You called me here to commit suicide! Do you think I’d forgive you? You’re dreaming!”

No matter what, he was still a general who held military power. Were it not for the summons from a member of the royal family, and the fact that his legion was garrisoned here, he would not have come out to help.

At the same time, the beautiful woman in the red dress from Suite 003 was also watching this scene from inside the auction house.

“So he is Sword Immortal Ye?”

Hong Xiu mumbled to herself. She suddenly recalled something and was even more shocked.

She did not expect that a peerless genius would appear in the East continent in such a short time. He had already broken through to the supreme realm at such a young age.

With a little more time, would it not be possible for him to reach the sealed immortal realm?

Hu…

Hong Xiu took a deep breath to calm herself down.

“Young Miss, should we intervene to forge a good relationship with Ye Xuan? He might be able to help us investigate this strange power.”

The subordinate beside her looked at Hong Xiu and made a suggestion, but Hong Xiu shook her head and replied, “There’s no need for that now. I can tell that we’ll definitely meet him again in the future. Let’s leave first.”

As soon as she finished speaking, they left and disappeared from the auction house.

Looking at Li Kun who kept begging for mercy, Feng Tianyi was extremely angry at this time. He also felt a little bad.

Although Li Kun was indeed in the wrong today, considering his long period of service and his position as general, it would be inappropriate to fire him for something that Feng Lu had caused.

Feng Tianyi said coldly after a long sigh, “Li Kun, I believe you are also aware that your status and authority comes from the Yangli divine empire.”

“The only person you have to obey is the emperor, not Prince Zhanglu!”

“I can let you off for today’s matter. If there’s a next time, you should be clear about what will happen, right?”

Li Kun was drenched in cold sweat after hearing Feng Tianyi’s words. He understood what Feng Tianyi meant.
