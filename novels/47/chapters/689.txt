690 Sneak Attack!

After being tortured by this little girl, how was he going to show his face in public in the future?

“You’re trying to escape?”

Xiang Yun cheekily hammered him to the ground and stepped on him.

Upon seeing this, everyone fell silent, and shortly after broke out laughing.

!!

As time passed, some people could not help but laugh.

“Haha! This guy probably thought that she was the easiest opponent to deal with, but ended up drawing the short end of the stick.”

“It seems that Lin Qiaosheng has become the sacrificial lamb to teach us all an important lesson. Truly admirable! Thanks for taking one for the team!”

At this moment, Lin Qiaosheng himself did not know that, one day, stories of his experience here would spread far and wide.

After being beaten up again by Xiang Yun, Lin Qiaosheng started crying so miserably that she immediately despised him.

This guy could not even take a beating well.

“How boring. You should leave quickly. I don’t want to see you anymore.”

After seeing a grown man like him crying like this, Xiang Yun felt disgusted and immediately wanted to be rid of him. At this moment, finding her first sister was her priority.

However, just as he was about to turn around and leave, Lin Qiaosheng suddenly stopped crying. The corners of his mouth even curled up evilly.

This was a heaven-sent opportunity!

Lin Qiaosheng secretly rejoiced. He had actually been acting just now in order to obtain this opportunity.

He unhesitatingly drew his sword, and erupted with his full strength as he immediately used a divine power to try and stab Xiang Yun in the back.

All he needed was one solid hit!

“Oh no, Xiang Yun is in danger!” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

The human heart was unpredictable, and Xiang Yun was still too young and naive. She was unable to tell that Lin Qiaosheng was just acting, and that even his crying was fake.

The cultivators of the Great Wilderness Divine sect started to panic when they saw that Lin Qiaosheng’s sharp sword was about to penetrate Xiang Yun’s body.

The sect master of the Lingyun sect laughed out loud.

“Haha, my disciple is really not bad. A real man knows when to yield and when to stand firm. As long as he can get the job done, no matter what methods he uses, it is acceptable.”

At this moment, he believed that his disciple had already clinched victory, as the divine power Lin Qiaosheng was using was the Lingyun sect’s heaven-grade divine power, Flowing Cloud Slash.

The defining aspect of this divine power was its speed, so Xiang Yun would have no chance to dodge.

Just as the sharp sword was about to pierce her body, a crisp sound suddenly rang out…

Seeing this scene, everyone was dumbfounded.

“Uh… What happened?”

Lin Qiaosheng’s sharp sword failed to reach Xiang Yun. His attack had been blocked by her clothes!

At this moment, Xiang Yun’s dress suddenly glowed brightly, making it difficult for people to open their eyes.

“Could it be”

“Is that an immortal-grade treasure?”

Everyone looked at Ye Xuan in unison, their eyes filled with shock. Ye Xuan remained unperturbed by all of this.

After all, long before the gathering had even started, Ye Xuan had already considered the problem of Xiang Yun’s age. He was afraid that she would be taken advantage of, so he had her wear this dress.

After all, every parent would treat their child like a treasure, right?

Because this dress had already recognized Yanran as its owner, it could not be given to her for a system reward, but it mattered not. Only its function was important.

Ye Xuan changed the appearance of the dress temporarily before putting it on her. As she was protected by the rainbow dress, Ye Xuan could rest easy as she ran around and caused trouble.

“Why does he have so many precious treasures?”

“Not long ago, he already showed off his two divine swords, and now he’s got this immortal-grade dress too. Does Ye Xuan have a treasure vault hidden somewhere?”

Seeing the dress Xiang Yun was wearing, the crowd sighed with jealousy. Having a teacher like Ye Xuan was truly a blessing.

This wiped the smile off the face of thesect master of the Lingyun sect. There would be no second chances this time.

“Sh*t! I’m done for,” Lin Qiaosheng muttered miserably.

The fact that she was wearing such a powerful defensive-type treasure had truly thrown a spanner in the works.
