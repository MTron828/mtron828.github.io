418 Gao Shun Appears

“Hmm?”

Ye Xuan raised his eyebrows and looked up.

A bright light flashed across the sky, and a middle-aged man in a gray robe appeared.

“Who is this person? He actually called Ye Xuan his junior brother?”

Hearing this, everyone was curious.

With his sharp eyes, Situ Mo immediately recognized the middle-aged man.

“Gao Shun! The law enforcement elder… Why is he here?”

“What? That middle-aged man is actually the law enforcement elder of the Great Wilderness Divine sect?”

The Reincarnation Fairy was also curious.

Today was truly a special day. Two mystic lord realm experts from the Great Wilderness Divine sect had appeared.

“It’s indeed Gao Shun. Sure, he’s strong, but he’s got a chip on his shoulder. He’ll seek revenge for the smallest grievance!”

“Gao Shun?”

Seeing this, Ye Xuan frowned. After some slight hesitation, he lowered his hand.

Why was this guy here?

“Senior Brother Gao, do you have some business with me?” Ye Xuan was a little dissatisfied.

Even though he had never been on good terms with Gao Shun, they were both still cultivators of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, so in the outside world, he still had to put on a facade for the sake of the sect’s reputation.

Gao Shun crossed hundreds of meters in an instant and appeared beside Ye Xuan and Lin Youming.

When he saw Gao Shun appear, Lin Youming’s eyes immediately revealed a look of wild joy, “Chief Gao, please save me!”

When Gao Shun saw this, he looked at Lin Youming with a face full of disgust.

He wanted to curse this food. Was there a hole in this guy’s brain? He had actually provoked Ye Xuan.

Ye Xuan had never been on good terms with him. If this guy used this incident to make a fuss, he would be the one to suffer.

Although Gao Shun was very unhappy, he could not ignore it.

After all, the Lin family’s business had brought him a lot of benefits over the years. Otherwise, the strength of Hidden Sword peak would not have grown to the extent that it had.

In addition, the seven chiefs more or less had a close relationship with the major families in the East continent, which was where they derived most of their basic cultivation resources and wealth.

Of course, Cloud Sky peak was an exception because there were not many people there.

“Junior Brother Ye, Lin Youming has been a good friend of mine for many years. Although I don’t know how he angered you, I hope that you can spare his life for my sake,” Gao Shun said with a sincere expression.

He sighed deeply in his heart.

Originally, Ye Xuan was just a piece of trash in his eyes.

However, it was only now that he realized that Ye Xuan had unknowingly grown to the point where he could stand shoulder to shoulder with him.

In particular, the battle between Ye Xuan and Sun Mobai and the other elders of the Immortal Divine sect earlier had shocked Gao Shun greatly.

Ye Xuan had actually broken through to the mystic lord realm! 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Ye Xuan’s talent was so monstrous. If this continued, would things not end up badly for him?

How detestable!

Could Hidden Sword peak not escape the fate of being crushed by Cloud Sky peak?

He had thought that after Tian Xuan passed away, Hidden Sword peak would be able to suppress Cloud Sky peak under his leadership.

However, the strength that Ye Xuan had displayed today was undoubtedly a harsh wake-up call.

Hearing this, Ye Xuan’s eyes turned cold.

“I can take Senior Brother Gao’s friendship with him into account, but isn’t it a little inappropriate to solve this with just a few words?”

“Do you think the disciples of my Cloud Sky peak can be bullied by some nobody?”

When Gao Shun saw this situation, his expression became gloomy.

He already knew that this would not be resolved so easily.

‘Damn it, it seems like I won’t be able to protect the Lin family if I don’t pay a price.’

Was there a hole in Lin Youming’s brain? Why did he provoke this guy?

“Junior Brother Ye’s words are reasonable. After I figure out what transpired in this situation, I will definitely give you a proper explanation,” Gao Shun gritted his teeth as he said this.

Immediately, Gao Tong turned around and asked Lin Youming to explain the situation.

Ye Xuan was not in a hurry either. He went over to Feng Xiyun and Zhuge Yueyue’s side.

He was also rather curious as to what price Gao Shun would be willing to pay for the Lin family.

“Young Master Su, long time no see. Why are you trembling every time we meet?”

“Cough, cough”

Su Changhe had almost been scared to death when he realized that Ye Xuan was looking at him.

“Senior, I’m just too excited to see you! You’re my idol!”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan smiled.

Just now, Feng Xiyun had already told Ye Xuan everything that had happened.

Ye Xuan was also surprised by Su Changhe and the Su family’s actions.

However, it was not difficult to understand that this guy was obviously trying to atone for his sins.

Hmm…

Since this guy’s performance was not bad, he would not fuss about what had happened before.

“I’m Su Tiansheng, the head of the Su family. Greetings, Chief Ye Xuan!”

At this moment, Su Tiansheng walked over and respectfully bowed to Ye Xuan. After witnessing Ye Xuan’s strength, his heart was filled with respect.

Furthermore, this was an excellent opportunity to forge a good relationship with a powerful expert.

“Mm! Your Su family has done a good job. It’s all thanks to Master Su’s help that my two precious disciples were not injured.”

“I will remember the Su family’s kindness!”

Hearing this, Su Tiansheng was overjoyed.

Ye Xuan’s words undoubtedly indicated that Cloud Sky peak had accepted the Su family.

“No, no, Chief Ye Xuan, this was something we did voluntarily.”

“My family’s little brat offended you previously. I hope that you’ll be magnanimous and forgive his ignorant behavior.”

Ye Xuan looked at Su Tiansheng with a smile.
