693 Three-Way Stand-Off

Noticing that Ye Xuan was not participating in the conversation, Yuelun walked over and asked, “Junior Brother Ye, what’s wrong? Did something happen?”

“No,” Ye Xuan replied with a wave of his hand, “Don’t worry.”

He simply was focused on something else. After the gathering, he had decided to enter secluded cultivation in order to reach the ancient realm. Following that, he would investigate the mysteries behind the strange power, while strengthening himself.

Although he had already become the strongest expert in the East continent, who knew if there were any experts stronger than him in the other continents?

!!

There were many unknowns, and Ye Xuan would not delude himself into a false sense of self-confidence.

Hearing his answer, Yuelun gave up on probing further. She just quietly stayed beside Ye Xuan and lowered her head in deep thought.

On the other side, Mu Beichen and the Reincarnation Fairy became nervous when they found out that the fifth person to arrive was also from the Great Wilderness Divine sect.

After all, the current situation was really favorable for the Great Wilderness Divine sect. If a chaotic battle started, they would definitely join hands to help each other.

He would have to cooperate with the others later. Otherwise, he would end up being ganged up on by those three.

Moments later, the sixth person to reach the summit appeared. He was Xu Changqing from the Tianxia Academy.

As soon as he arrived, Xu Changqing walked toward the Reincarnation Fairy and said with a smile, “Haha, I already guessed that you would definitely arrive first.”

The Reincarnation Fairy just looked at him and did not reply. She felt that this person was really thick-skinned and was taking every opportunity to pester her.

Xu Changqing said a few words to Fairy Reincarnation before running over to Mu Beichen’s side.

After all, the three of them were quite familiar with each other, so it was natural for them to stick together and cooperate.

Some time later, the other four disciples also arrived at the summit. When they saw that two groups had already formed, they understood that they had no choice but to do the same. The four of them immediately united. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Seeing this, Hua Rufeng raised his eyebrows and said, “The situation doesn’t seem to be optimistic”

“Mu Beichen, the Reincarnation Fairy, and Xu Changqing are all top geniuses. As for the other group, they have a numerical advantage, so they won’t be easy to deal with. This is quite disadvantageous to us.”

Zhuge Yueyue agreed.

After all, Mu Beichen and the Reincarnation Fairy could fight evenly with her. The other four people were also outstanding geniuses. After all, how could those who could reach the summit be weak?

“Hehe, what’s there to be afraid of? Leave it to me, First Sister. I can defeat all of them.”

“Oh, wait, no, I’ll leave one for each of you so you can have fun too,” Xiang Yun said with a cheeky smile. Seeing her rubbing her fists excitedly , Hua Rufeng felt a little ashamed.

During this period, he was also forced to fight Xiang Yun a few times, but every time, he was forced into a passive state.

“Third Sister, don’t be careless,” Zhuge Yue Yue immediately reminded her.

After hearing this, Xiang Yun could only obediently sit back down.

“The two groups of opponents we’re facing this time are quite strong,” Hua Rufeng added, “It would be unwise to fight them head-on.”

“In that case, we can choose to let them fight each other first before cleaning up.”

“While that’s a good idea, they might choose to deal with us first as well. After all, we’re all from the same sect.”

Hua Rufeng and Zhuge Yueyue analyzed and discussed the situation once again. After all, they would be considered the biggest threat to the others, so it made sense that they would be targeted first.

Zhuge Yueyue realized that if they were ganged up on by the others, the key to victory would be Xiang Yun.

Thinking this, Zhuge Yueyue glanced at her.

‘Third Sister, I’m really sorry. This time, I might have no choice but to deceive you.’

At this moment, the atmosphere at the summit had already turned solemn and tense. It was a three-way stand-off, as each group discussed their strategies.

After a while, flickers of golden light sprinkled down from the sky, as if it was raining starlight. Then, the golden slowly condensed into a path of light.

At the end of the path was a golden throne. Only the champion was qualified to sit on it.

When the golden throne was revealed, everyone’s eyes were filled with desire. Then, someone could no longer hold himself back.

A tall young man stood up without hesitation and said in a loud voice, “Brothers and sisters, let’s start!”

“Well said. Since things have come to this, I think everyone is prepared for what’s about to happen. If you want to become champion, then you’ll have to earn it!”

After saying that, the four-man team entered the Yin-Yang diagram, which was a formation, without hesitation.

Seeing this, Mu Beichen and the others looked at each other. There was no need to drag this out any longer.

After stretching, he said, “In that case, let’s begin.”
