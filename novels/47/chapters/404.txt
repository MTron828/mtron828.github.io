405 Visiting Bearing Gifts

However, Su Tiansheng and Zhang Lihong had no idea that Su Changhe’s filial piety was entirely due to one person.

“Dad, come over quickly. I’ll wash your feet for you as well.”

“You’ve been working hard for the Su family all of your life. It’s time for you to take some time and relax.”

“Alright!”

Hearing this, Su Tiansheng nodded in satisfaction. This really was a welcome change.

“You’ve finally grown up, kid. I didn’t dote on you for nothing all these years.”

Immediately after Su Tiansheng took off his shoes, a smell that could even make a pig faint immediately assaulted Su Changhe’s nose, which almost made him vomit.

He was full of grievance.

Damn it!

‘Ye Xuan, this is all your fault!’

However, Su Changhe could only curse in his heart. On the surface, he washed his father’s feet expressionlessly.

He had no choice, this was all he could do.

Su Changhe said to Su Tiansheng and Zhang Lihong after he cleaned up the washbasin, “Father, Mother, rest well. Your son will go and cultivate now.”

“That’s great! Go on ahead!”

It was rare to see his son take the initiative to cultivate, so Su Tiansheng’s heart could be said to be brimming with joy.

He did not know what this kid had experienced over the past month to change his personality and behavior like this.

He had grown from a lazy and good-for-nothing rich kid to a mature man.

After Su Changhe left, Su Tiansheng immediately called over the two guardians he had tasked with protecting his son, Elder Lin and Elder Chen. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Su Tiansheng and Zhang Lihong were not angry at all when they heard about Su Changhe and Ye Xuan. Instead, they smiled.

“I didn’t expect that this kind of thing would happen to this kid. Darling, it seems that we have to thank Ye Xuan.”

The cunning Su Tiansheng naturally knew that the Ye Xuan coming over to check if Su Changhe was filial was just a joke.

Ye Xuan was the chief of the Great Wilderness Divine sect’s Cloud Sky peak, and a powerful heaven realm expert. How could he have the time to check on a hedonistic son of the Su family?

The reason Ye Xuan did this was to give Su Changhe a chance to turn over a new leaf.

The effect was obvious. Su Changhe was indeed frightened and was trying to maintain his filial image.

One must know that before he met Ye Xuan, this kid was a hedonistic young master who was not afraid of anything and only knew how to cause trouble for his family.

Unexpectedly, after coming back this time, not only did his arrogant demeanor completely vanish, but he also became filial and obedient.

At the thought of this, Su Tiansheng’s heart was filled with gratitude toward Ye Xuan.

A simple sentence had changed his son’s life and saved the Su family.

After all, Su Changhe had been too arrogant in the past. However, since Su Tiancheng was still in charge of the Su family, there was no big problem.

However, what would happen after he passed away? Who would be in charge of the Su family?

Previously, Su Tiansheng had been vexed about how to train his son to become the rightful heir of the family.

Now, Ye Xuan had easily solved his biggest problem with just one sentence.

Zhang Lihong even suggested with a smile, “Old Su, isn’t the Seven Peaks competition of the Great Wilderness Divine sect next month?”

“I think it’s necessary for our Su family to prepare some gifts for a visit. We must thank Chief Ye Xuan.”

“En!” Su Tiansheng nodded with a smile.

“Your words are reasonable. Chief Ye Xuan has given our Su family a new lease on life. We must thank him properly.”

“Moreover, the Great Wilderness Divine sect is an extremely powerful holy land in our Yangli divine empire. Ye Xuan is the chief of Cloud Sky peak. Perhaps we can take this opportunity to make friends with him.”

“In Qingyang City, the top families more or less have the support of the powerful sects. The Lin family has the Immortal Divine sect, and the Xia family has the Tianxia Academy.”

“Only our Su family hasn’t found a reliable ally yet.”

“The Great Wilderness Divine sect is an excellent choice!”

As the head of the Su family, Su Tiancheng was able to sniff out an opportunity when one presented itself.

Immediately, Su Tiansheng’s gaze fell on Elder Lin, “Elder Lin, quickly prepare some precious gifts and send them to Cloud Sky peak!”

“Perhaps to Chief Ye Xuan, our gifts may not be eye-catching, but they should be of some use to the disciples of Cloud Sky peak.”

“As you wish, Master. I’ll deal with it now,” Elder Lin nodded, then turned and left.

Elder Lin agreed with Su Tiansheng’s decision.

After all, he had personally seen and experienced Ye Xuan’s strength.

It was undoubtedly the best to be on good terms with someone as powerful and full of potential as Ye Xuan.

After that, Su Tiansheng and Zhang Lihong looked at each other and saw the smile on each other’s face. Then, they went to Su Changhe’s room together.

Through the window of the room, Su Tiansheng and Su Changhe could clearly see that Su Changhe was cultivating seriously inside. He was no longer as lazy as before.

Perhaps due to this incident, this kid was not only frightened by Ye Xuan, but he was also shocked by the other powerful experts, which was driving him to become stronger.

“Darling, it seems that our little brat has really changed!” Su Tiansheng’s face was full of smiles.

Zhang Lihong nodded in agreement, but she was also a little worried.

Su Changhe’s abrupt desire to cultivate and become stronger would not cause any psychological problems, would it?

Zhang Lihong quickly said, “Old Su, our precious son has been cooped up in his room cultivating ever since he returned to the family. It’s not a good thing for him to continue doing this in the long run. How can his body take it?”

Su Tiansheng thought about it carefully and agreed with Zhang Lihong’s words.

“Cultivation can’t be rushed. It must be done step by step.”

“A balance of work and rest is the most beneficial to the state of mind of a cultivator.”
