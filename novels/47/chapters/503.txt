504 The Time Formation

No one could react to this sudden change.

Ye Xuan was the first to react. He used his teleportation divine power and flashed toward the ancient tomb as fast as he could.

The moment he reached into the ancient tomb, he suddenly saw an extremely familiar figure.

Elder Taiyin!

!!

However, Ye Xuan could not be bothered with him. Instead, he turned into a streak of light and pursued the heaven devouring divine sparrow.

In that instant, the surrounding area turned tumultuous, as a bloody battle began.

According to the speculations of some experts, this ancient tomb was very likely to be the tomb of a legendary sealed immortal realm expert, which had been sealed for countless years.

When it opened, the mushroom cloud of energy erupted. Some of the weaker cultivators were completely unable to withstand this terrifying pressure, and were forced to stay outside the ancient tomb and wait for the pressure to weaken.

After entering the ancient tomb, Ye Xuan suddenly saw a boundless coastline.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan was surprised. This was definitely not what he had expected to find inside. It was not a labyrinth, but a miniature world.

Moreover, the sea that lined the coast was not full of life and vitality. Rather, it exuded a blood-red murderous aura that seemed to originate from the netherworld.

He could even smell the scent of blood. Ye Xuan’s spiritual sense swept out around him. In the distance, the huge black tortoise was swimming through the sea at a rapid pace. Ahead of it was a colorful divine gate that was shimmering with light.

Following behind the black tortoise were the heaven devouring divine sparrow, Pixiu and Zhuyan.

Without any hesitation, Ye Xuan immediately turned into a streak of light and charged forward.

However, after he flew into the sky, he suddenly realized that he seemed to have fallen into an extremely strange domain.

He had actually been forcefully teleported to another place.

Ye Xuan immediately waved his sleeve, and the power of his spiritual sense spread out, carefully observing the situation around him.

He frowned.

This sea of blood contained an extremely mysterious power. The moment he stepped into the sea region, this power engulfed his body, as if it was testing his cultivation realm.

The reason he had been teleported here seemed to be because of that. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

After thinking for a moment, Ye Xuan had a look of realization.

It turned out that this ancient tomb contained many domains, and each domain corresponded to a different cultivation realm.

When a cultivator entered the sea region, the blood-red aura would probe their cultivation level, and then teleport them to the corresponding domain.

The domain that Ye Xuan was currently in corresponded to the mystic lord realm..

“Mmm… I don’t like this.”

Ye Xuan frowned.

Compared to the treasures in the ancient tomb, he was more interested in the heavenly treasure on the back of the black tortoise.

Unfortunately, with his current cultivation level, he was unable to enter the domain that corresponded with the supreme realm.

“It seems that I’ll have to break through to the supreme realm while I’m in here. Otherwise, I won’t be able to obtain that heavenly treasure.”

Ye Xuan thought for a moment and made his decision.

However, even with the help of the chaos innate divine fruit, it would still take him a long time to break through. He was not sure if he would make it in time.

“Let’s not dwell on this. I have to give it a go at least!”

At this moment, Ye Xuan could think of no other way. He used his spiritual sense to examine his surroundings, and then flew in a certain direction. He was aware that Elder Taiyin was definitely in here as well, but it seemed that the latter was quite far away, as Ye Xuan could not sense him with his spiritual sense.

As he crossed the sea, Ye Xuan suddenly sensed a bone-chilling aura underneath his feet.

At this moment, the blood-red seawater churned, and a huge shark opened its jaws to try to bite Ye Xuan.

“You’re seeking death!”

Seeing this, Ye Xuan’s gaze turned cold. He raised his right palm and unleashed the Boundless Palm technique, which reduced the shark to dust.

However, the moment the shark died, a precious bone that shone with dazzling light suddenly appeared on the surface of the sea.

“Oh? A precious bone? This is an unexpected harvest.”

Ye Xuan was surprised, but scooped it up and put it away anyway. Then, he turned into a streak of light that charged toward a huge mountain.

This was because his spiritual sense had detected that this mountain contained a dense amount of spiritual energy.

When Ye Xuan arrived in front of it, he suddenly realized that there was a strange cave inside the mountain.

It was actually a heavenly paradise…

Ye Xuan looked at the interior layout of the cave. It was almost the same as the Water Curtain Cave in Journey to the West story of his previous life. There was also a spiritual spring in the cave, which was rich in spiritual energy.

What surprised Ye Xuan the most was that this paradise actually contained an extremely rare time formation.

Under the effect of the time formation, the flow of time in the cave was completely different from the outside world.

Only one day in the outside world would pass after spending ten days inside this cave.

At the thought of this, Ye Xuan could not help but smile. This was truly a heaven-sent blessing. With this, his chances of reaching the supreme realm in time had increased significantly.

Without much hesitation, Ye Xuan entered the spiritual spring, and then took out the chaos innate divine fruit from his storage ring.
