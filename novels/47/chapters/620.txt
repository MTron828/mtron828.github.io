621 Reconciliation

In the end, Ye Xuan decided to bring Xiang Yun back to Cloud Sky peak to teach her.

He felt rather helpless, not knowing who to ask to teach her.

While Ye Xuan was pondering this dilemma, Xiang Yun tugged on his sleeve and asked curiously, “Teacher, I’ve just beaten up this group of children. Have I become invincible among my peers?”

Her words left everyone dumbfounded. They stared at each other, not knowing what to say.

!!

“Pfft…”

Yuelun laughed. Then, she squatted in front of Xiang Yun and asked softly, “Xiang Yun, who taught you this?”

Upon hearing this, the little girl’s eyes darted around randomly before answering, “This is what my senior sisters told me. If I can beat all of the brats from the same generation as me into submission, then I will be invincible among my peers.”

“Since I just beat up this group of children, shouldn’t I be invincible?”

Everyone looked at her with amused expressions. This line of logic was really quite unique.

Gao Shun also could not resist laughing. This little girl was really too funny.

The real reason she attacked the kids was definitely because she wanted to claim the title of invincible.

“Junior Brother Ye, the disciple you’ve accepted is really talented. You have to teach her well. I have high hopes for her.”

After saying that, Gao Shun left in a carefree manner.

At this moment, Ye Xuan felt helpless and could only fly back to Cloud Sky peak with Xiang Yun.

This little girl was bound to become a talking point in the sect. Then again, he had expected this when he accepted her.

At this moment, Gao Shun, who had just returned to Hidden Sword peak, was smiling brightly.

Seeing their teacher so happy, his disciples were very puzzled. What had happened to make their teacher so happy?

Gao Tianyu leaned in and asked, “Father, what made you so happy? Good things should be shared.”

Hearing that, Gao Shun smiled and said, “Your Martial Uncle Ye just accepted a new disciple. She was sent to the study hall today, and the first thing she did was beat up all of the children there. Even Elder Huang was not spared!”

“She’s only six years old, yet has quite the temper. Chief Li Dahai’s son was beaten up to the point he had panda eyes. It really was too spectacular!”

Gao Shun laughed even more happily when he recalled what Li Yi had said about his father.

It really was too funny! Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

When the group of disciples heard this, they all laughed in unison.

It seemed that Martial Uncle Ye’s newest disciple was quite the character, and even managed to beat up a whole group of children.

Then again, knowing Martial Uncle Ye’s eye for talent, it was only to be expected.

Both Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun were monstrous geniuses, and this little girl would undoubtedly be no different.

At this moment, news about Xiang Yun was spreading rapidly.

After laughing for some time, the smile on Gao Shun’s face finally disappeared after he recalled the matter the chiefs had discussed with Ao Lei.

“Alright, go and cultivate immediately. The Divine Seal peak’s gathering is coming soon. Each of you should do your best to obtain a good ranking and raise the prestige of the Great Wilderness Divine sect.”

After saying these words, Gao Shun suddenly noticed a disciple with a lowered head among his other disciples.

It was Xiao Feng.

He deeply regretted this matter. He had been entangled in his personal grudge with Ye Xuan for far too long, and had neglected this disciple of his.

It was precisely because of this reason that this disciple of his had become withdrawn, and rarely interacted with others.

Zhuge Yueyue, who had joined the sect at the same time as his disciple, was already quite famous now, and was widely acknowledged as a peerless genius.

In comparison, Xiao Feng was still a divine mystic realm cultivator.

All of his previous arrogance had disappeared, and he was now lacking self-confidence. Seeing this disciple of his, Gao Shun hated himself for being so stupid back then. His grudge had implicated his disciples.

Thinking this, Gao Shun decided to try to make things up to him.

“Xiao Feng, come with me.”

Xiao Feng was shocked and even a little panicked after being suddenly called out.

Gao Tianyu smiled and cheered him on. “It’s fine, Junior Brother. Go and meet Master.”

Hearing this, Xiao Feng nodded and agreed. He followed Gao Shun into his residence.

He was mired in a sea of despair and hopelessness, but at this moment, a flame of hope had been ignited in his heart.

His teacher had not forgotten him…

When he entered the residence nervously, he saw that Gao Shun had already sat down and was waiting for him quietly.

Seeing Xiao Feng walk in, Gao Shun sighed and said, “My disciple, I can understand if you hold resentment toward me.”

“I do regret the things I did in the past, and I know I’ve let you down.”

“Teacher, I don’t. I’ve never hated you.”

With red eyes, Xiao Feng continued, “I can only blame myself for being too lacking in terms of aptitude. When Teacher needed me, I couldn’t do anything to help. I’ve never made you proud, Teacher.”

Sigh…

Seeing Xiao Feng sobbing, Gao Shun felt even more guilty.

“This is all my fault. I didn’t teach you properly before.”

“I’ve decided that from today onward, you’ll stay by my side and cultivate with my guidance. Although my abilities are not as great as your Martial Uncle Ye’s, I will definitely not let your talent go to waste.”

“I hope that you can become a strong cultivator one day. Don’t waste your talent.”

Xiao Feng was touched by his teacher’s words. He had been prepared to give up after failing to meet his teacher’s expectations time and time again.

...

However, he had now discovered that his teacher had not abandoned him, and even wanted him to cultivate by his side.

Xiao Feng was very grateful for this and kowtowed to Gao Shun.
