“Great witch, this sword move is on behalf of the people you killed from the Great Wilderness Divine sect!”

As soon as he finished speaking, powerful energy fluctuations swept out as the Godsword clashed with Mengyu’s demonic sword, which caused shockwaves and explosions.

Both of them took a few steps back, but Ye Xuan did not stop at all. He raised his sword and slashed his sword at Mengyu again.

“This sword move is for my teacher, Tian Xuan!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan used his Flora Sword technique and attacked with all his might.

Puchi!

After blocking this sword move, Mengyu spat out blood. Her body trembled and she took a few steps back.

Ye Xuan pursued her and used the Endless Lightning technique, causing dark clouds to gather, and thunder rumbled across the sky.

“This sword move is for the people you killed in this world!”

“Die!”

After saying this coldly, Ye Xuan instantly flew 10,000 meters into the sky. He held the Godsword with both hands and unleashed an unstoppable slash.

At this moment, Mengyu’s face was pale and powerless. She could only stare blankly at Ye Xuan as she blocked the attack.

After another explosion, Mengyu spat out a few mouthfuls of blood and became even more dazed.

No one had expected that Ye Xuan, who was a major cultivation realm lower than her, could push her to this extent.

“Oh my god, this is really too shocking.”

“This battle is definitely the most exciting battle I have ever seen in my life. My hands are getting itchy. I wanna spar with someone!””

“This person’s potential is simply unimaginable. Even in our continent, there are very few geniuses who can compare.”

“This person will soon reach the sealed immortal realm after this.”

Everyone was sighing with admiration. Ye Xuan had now become famous in the other continent as well.

Mengyu was already angry from embarrassment as she watched Ye Xuan unleash attack after attack at her.

She had never experienced such humiliation until today. She vowed that between Ye Xuan and herself, only one of them could survive today.

In this world, she would never allow anyone stronger than her to exist.

“Have you had enough fun? Now it’s time for me to make a move!”

After saying this, Mengyu instantly mobilized her spiritual power and prepared to attack.

However, at this moment, Daoist Yi Feng landed a palm strike on her back, causing her to stumble backwards. Honestly, if it was not their previous scheme to weaken her, they would not have stood a chance.

Mengyu could no longer restrain her anger after suffering such severe injuries. As a sealed immortal realm expert, how could she stand being beaten by two ancient realm cultivators?

Moments later, she activated her Devouring Heaven technique without hesitation. The entire world instantly darkened.

“Oh no! She actually used the Devouring Heaven technique. Run!”

Clearly, Daoist Yi Feng understood how powerful this cultivation technique was, so he immediately warned Ye Xuan.

After this strange technique was activated, the two of them seemed to be frozen. They were motionless and could even feel the blood in their bodies evaporating.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan’s expression changed drastically and he said, “The Heaven Devouring technique is so powerful. Even though she is in a weakened state, we still can’t resist it.”

“Sigh… The outcome is still difficult to change.”

“After all, a sealed immortal realm expert is different. How can two ancient realm experts defeat her? Although the gap seems small, there is an unbridgeable gap between the two realms.”

“I can’t help but admire them for being able to force her to this extent, but so what? The outcome will not change”

People discussed animatedly, feeling very regretful.

On the other side of the barrier, a young man was also paying attention to Ye Xuan’s battle. Seeing him being pushed back like this, he wanted to cheer and jump for joy.

“Haha, Ye Xuan, I bet you didn’t expect this day to come.”

“You should just die quickly. You do not need to worry about Yanran. I will definitely take good care of her…”

This person was naturally Yanran’s loyal pursuer, Ou Yunhai.

Even now, he was still pursuing Yanran and was still unwilling to give up.

At this moment, the two of them were in danger, and their vitality was rapidly decreasing. This powerful cultivation technique could devour the enemy’s blood energy and seize the enemy’s strength.

It had only been a few dozen seconds, but Ye Xuan could already sense that more than half of his strength had been absorbed by Mengyu.

If this situation continued, he and Daoist Yi Feng would definitely die.

“Damn it! The Devouring Heaven technique is too powerful. I’m afraid Junior Brother Ye and Martial Uncle Yi Feng won’t be able to resist it for much longer,” Ao Lei said this worriedly. After all, he had a deep understanding of this technique after experiencing it a hundred years ago.

After all, Mengyu had relied on this technique to forcefully absorb the life force of tens of thousands of people…
