651 Inevitable Battle (Part 1)

“If I’m not wrong, this person must be cultivating both body refining and spiritual cultivation. That’s the only explanation for the aura he’s unleashing!”

After hearing Daoist Xu Yun’s words, Daoist Canghai became even more shocked. It was monstrous enough for Ye Xuan to reach the peak of the supreme realm in terms of spiritual cultivation at such a young age, but he had also done so in terms of body refining cultivation?

Absurd!

After Ye Xuan arrived, the atmosphere suddenly became even more intense. Most of the cultivators here were aware of his feats, and wanted to see what would happen if the foremost expert of the current generation went up against the experts of the older generation.

!!

The more people thought about it, the more excited they became.

Sensing Ye Xuan’s powerful aura, Daoist Gu Hao’s face turned pale, and he immediately began to think of ways to back off. He did think highly of his chances of victory.

How had the Great Wilderness Divine sect produced an expert of this caliber?

If this situation continued, it would not take long for the Great Wilderness Divine sect to become the undisputed number one sect in the East continent.

Daoist Gu Hao suddenly felt a little regretful. He should not have stirred up trouble just now.

If he had endured Ao Lei’s provocation, this would not have happened.

“So you’re Ye Xuan…”

Daoist Gu Hao said with a gloomy face.

Before responding Ye Xuan first looked at his three disciples and asked them to join the rest of the Great Wilderness Divine sect’s cultivators.

“Yes, that’s me!”

“Hehe, not bad, you’re young and promising! Chief Tian Xuan’s soul in heaven must be very pleased that you have reached such a realm at such a young age.”

Seeing the sudden change in Daoist Gu Hao’s attitude, many people opened their mouths wide in shock.

“Holy crap! Is Daoist Gu Hao scared?”

“No matter what, he’s the Supreme Divine sect’s most powerful expert. If he cowers at this moment, wouldn’t it reflect poorly on the Supreme Divine sect?”

Everyone started to whisper among themselves. Of course, Daoist Gu Hao heard every single word, and wanted nothing more than to beat them up.

F*ck!

These people were ignorant!

It was important for people to know their own limitations!

Daoist Gu Hao eventually continued, “I had a pretty good relationship with your teacher, so you can be considered half a martial nephew to me.”

“As such, there’s no reason for me to attack you. Otherwise, I would become a laughingstock within the cultivation world.”

Daoist Gu Hao shamelessly gave himself a way out.

However, Gao Shun became unhappy after hearing this and said, “Oh, why are you only bringing up your relationship with Chief Tian Xuan now? Weren’t you perfectly happy to attack us just now?”

Gao Shun’s words were sharp and incisive. In any case, Ye Xuan was around to cover for him, so he could say whatever he wanted.

Hence, he immediately continued, “Eh? I’ve finally figured it out. If I’m not wrong, you’re scared, aren’t you? Tsk, tsk…”

Following that, Gao Shun turned around to look at his disciples and ordered, “After returning to the sect later, remember to keep this a secret. We can’t let anyone find out that he’s afraid, okay?”

After the disciples heard these words, each and every one of them lowered their heads, forcefully holding back their laughter.

After a long while, they calmed down and said, “Yes, Teacher! We promise to keep this a secret.”

Hearing this, Daoist Gu Hao could not hold it in any longer and vomited a few mouthfuls of blood.

This matter had already affected the reputation of the Supreme Divine sect, so there was no backing out of it anymore. He might lose, but at the very least, he would put up a fight.

Thinking this, Gu Hao stood up and said, “Since things have come to this, it seems like I have no choice but to take action.”

“It just so happens that I’d like to take a good look at how strong Tian Xuan’s disciple is.”

At this point, only a battle could resolve this matter.

Ye Xuan also stood up calmly and extended his right hand toward Daoist Gu Hao, saying, “Then let’s do this…”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan took a casual step and flew up a hundred meters into the sky.

“Alright! Let’s see what you’re capable of!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he also flew up to meet Ye Xuan.

Seeing this scene, the crowd became even more excited.

“The first battle of the gathering is between peak-level supreme realm experts! This trip has been worth it!” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Let’s see if the Great Wilderness Divine sect or the Supreme Divine sect will emerge victorious.”

At this moment, Mu Beichen, the Reincarnation Fairy, and the other geniuses were also very excited…
