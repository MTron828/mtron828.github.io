706 Crystal (Part 2)

After all, just because other geniuses could not did not mean Xiang Yun could not.

Thinking this, Ye Xuan felt that this matter was about to get more interesting.

Despite how red her face was from exertion, the crystal had not moved at all.

Upon seeing this, she was infuriated, and erupted with power.

“Freaking move already!”

At this moment, Xiang Yun’s emotions allowed her to access some of the reserves of power in her body, and the crystal actually loosened a little, and even the entire peak began to tremble.

“Whoa!”

“Did she really loosen the crystal?”

“Can she really create a miracle?”

Even Daoist Canghai and Daoist Xu Yun were shocked.

If this little girl really managed to pull out the crystal, then what miraculous accomplishments would she achieve in the future?

The possibilities were simply mind-boggling!

“Hooo It’s been a long time since I’ve experienced such excitement.”

Daoist Canghai wiped the sweat off his forehead as he said these words.

Everyone’s eyes were glued to the screen. Every time Xiang Yun pulled at the crystal, their hearts would skip a beat.

Then suddenly

At this moment, with a huge bang, Xiang Yun was sent flying a hundred meters away.

She fell to the ground and even ate a mouthful of mud. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Ugh”

She spat out the mud in her mouth with great difficulty. Her face was filled with unwillingness and anger.

“Fine! I’ll fight you!”

She could not hold it in anymore. She picked up her hammer and leapt into the sky, launching a series of attacks on the golden throne again.

At this point, the disciple from the Godwind Academy was staring at this scene with a blank expression.

They were all here for the throne, but the one who obtained the throne was trying to smash it to pieces instead.

However, as exciting as this was, he decided to leave. Who knew if this little girl’s anger would suddenly turn to him instead. It was better to be safe than sorry.

In any case, the champion position was no longer up for grabs. After that, he quietly slipped away.

Seeing this, Hua Rufeng also felt a little conflicted.

“Should I leave too?”

However, he thought about it for a moment and chose to stay. After all, he might be able to help Xiang Yun if he stayed.

Otherwise, if anything happened to this little girl, he would probably be held responsible for negligence.

At this moment, Xiang Yun was attacking frantically, and her eyes were bloodshot. When she suddenly released her aura, the entire path began to tremble like crazy.

With a loud bang, waves of light flashed repeatedly, but the golden throne still remained undamaged.

After observing this situation, Ye Xuan sighed. He muttered, “Sigh, Xiang Yun’s current body refinement cultivation has only just reached the void realm.”

“Even though she possesses boundless potential, if she is to pull out this crystal successfully, I’m afraid she still needs the help of an extraordinary strength.”

After hearing this, Zhuge Yueyue asked in confusion, “Teacher, what is this extraordinary strength you’re talking about?”

Ye Xuan thought for a moment before replying, “Every person’s talent has a certain limit.”

“If their talent has already reached its limit, then I’m afraid they won’t have the chance to improve again.”

“However, this limit can also be broken. The strength that breaks through this limit is an extraordinary strength”

After hearing this, Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun understood.

“In this case, if Xiang Yun wants to obtain this crystal, she must break through her own limits. Only then will she have a chance?”

“Yes.”

When they heard Ye Xuan’s answer, their expressions instantly changed. Such a feat would definitely be incredibly difficult, and even their third sister might not be able to pull it off on her first try.

So what if she had great talent? A large part of her power had been sealed, and she could not use it at all. While Ye Xuan and the others were chatting, Xiang Yun had already ran over to the golden throne again, unconvinced.

“You stinky chair.”

After fiercely kicking the chair, Xiang Yun felt that she had nowhere to vent her anger. She turned around and realized that only Hua Rufeng was still around.
