598 Extermination

However, in a last-ditch effort, or perhaps out of some sense of final bravado, many of them began to fight back.

Seeing this, Ao Lei felt rather emotional. After a long sigh, he said, “Kill them! Get rid of them as quickly as possible!”

The enmity between the two sides could no longer be resolved. Showing mercy to the enemy was only being cruel to oneself.

If he let them off today out of kindness, it would only cause future problems when they returned for revenge.

Lin Dong, who was among the Immortal Divine sect cultivators, watched everything with a panicked expression. When he saw that Ye Xuan had already turned around and left, he squeezed his way forward and shouted, “Lord Gao, you have to save me!”

After hearing his voice, Gao Shun turned to look at Lin Dong. However, upon seeing that it was Lin Dong, he immediately shifted his gaze away. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

A long time ago, he had saved Lin Dong in Qingyang City, and had suffered a great loss as a result. As such, he had already repaid the Lin family for the financial contributions they had given him.

There was no longer any obligation for him to act. After all, this matter was of great importance, and his personal matters should not be prioritized over the sect’s grudges.

Seeing this, Lin Dong was filled with regret. Why had he not chosen the Great Wilderness Divine sect and picked the Immortal Divine sect instead?

At that time, he had believed the rumors that the Great Wilderness Divine sect had declined and was only a shadow of its former glory.

For this reason, he became a disciple of the Immortal Divine sect, and was even accepted as a disciple by an elder.

However, his master had already been killed, and he would perish together with the sect today.

At this moment, he saw a beautiful figure arrive in front of him.

This person was Zhuge Yueyue, the one he had provoked in Qingyang City. Zhuge Yueyue’s eyes were filled with hatred, and without even blinking, she took his life with a single strike.

After killing Lin Dong, Zhuge Yueyue turned around to look for other Immortal Divine sect cultivators to kill. Today was the day of her revenge!

However, after seeing this, Feng Xiyun worriedly pulled on her master sleeves and said, “Teacher, is Yueyue going to be okay? Will this affect her in the future?”

Ye Xuan shook his head and replied, “It’s fine. Let her do what she wants. She has to vent all of her deep-seated emotions in order to break the shackles in her heart.”

“After all, her whole family died during that incident. If she doesn’t get her revenge, it will plague her in the future.”

Ye Xuan looked around and began to sigh.

When he had first taken Zhuge Yueyue as his disciple, he had promised to help her take revenge. He had finally fulfilled his promise.

Seeing the massacre happening in front of her, Feng Xiyun felt her heart tremble.

This was the first time she had seen such a bloody scene since she was young. She felt nauseated, and was on the verge of throwing up.

She finally realized how cruel the world was.

“Teacher, are we going to exterminate them?”

Feng Xiyun asked in a trembling voice.

Hearing this, Ye Xuan turned around and looked at Feng Xiyun. Seeing that her face was a little pale, he said, “Xiyun, there’s something you need to understand.”

“If you want to establish yourself in the mystic world, you must not show mercy.”

“The grudges between our two sects can’t be settled through negotiation. If I had lost the battle just now, then the people who would have been slaughtered would have been us.”

“We must never be soft-hearted when dealing with our enemies. This has always been the practice of our sect, as well as all other sect’s in the mystic world.”

“Do you understand?”

After hearing Ye Xuan’s words, Feng Xiyun’s expression finally relaxed. She nodded, indicating that she understood.

Then, from the corner of his eye, Ye Xuan spotten a crow’s nest on a big tree in the Immortal Divine sect’s grounds. He flew up and took all the crow eggs inside, instantly shattering them with his spiritual power.

“Do you understand? This is what is meant by exterminating them.”

Seeing this, Feng Xiyun was dumbfounded. She did not know what to say.

This was simply crazy. Even the crow eggs in the Immortal Divine sect were to be destroyed?

In that case, all of the animals inside would have to be killed.

Looking at his disciple’s dumbfounded expression, Ye Xuan smiled and said, “Alright, I won’t say anymore.”

“Some things have to be experienced personally. After you see it a few times, you’ll get used to it.”

After saying that, Ye Xuan patted her head and turned his gaze back to the massacre in front of him.

Ao Lei and the others also came over to Ye Xuan at this time. Even now, they were still very surprised by his strength.

No one could have expected that the chief who was once the weakest in the Great Wilderness Divine sect would become the strongest.

It seemed that the legacy of Cloud Sky peak would continue.

“Hehe, Junior Brother Ye, congratulations! You have become the most powerful person in the Great Wilderness Divine sect,” Ao Lei said with a very happy smile.

He was actually happy that Ye Xuan had already surpassed him.

Ye Xuan was still young, and had unlimited potential, unlike someone like him who had almost reached the upper limit of his cultivation path.

As long as Ye Xuan was here, it was impossible for the Great Wilderness Divine sect to fall!

When he heard his senior brother’s words, Ye Xuan politely returned the greeting, “Senior Brother Ao, don’t joke with me. I only reached the supreme realm by chance. How could I be worthy of the title of the strongest in the sect?”

“Senior Brother Ao, you will always be number one!”
