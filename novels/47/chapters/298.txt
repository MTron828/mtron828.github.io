299 Sword Jade Body, Major Mastery Stage

Next, he moved on to artifact refining.

Time flew by, and nine days passed.

“Ding! Under the host’s guidance, the host’s disciple has successfully become a first-grade artifact refiner (elementary). The host has obtained a randomized 2,300x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has become a fifth-grade artifact refiner (elementary)!”

Yue was the first to successfully become an artifact refiner, and the high reward multiplier surprised Ye Xuan.

“Ding! Under the host’s guidance, the host’s disciple has successfully become a first-grade artifact refiner (elementary). The host has obtained a randomized 300x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has become a fifth-grade artifact refiner (elementary)!”

“Ding! Under the host’s guidance, the host’s disciple has successfully become a first-grade artifact refiner (elementary). The host has obtained a randomized 400x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has become a fifth-grade artifact refiner (intermediate)!”

After almost a month, Ye Xuan was now a master in all three fields.

Fourth-grade alchemist (expert)...

Fourth-grade formation master (expert)...

Fifth-grade artifact refiner (intermediate)...

Of course, this was not Ye Xuan’s limit. There was still a long way to go.

Over the next five months, Ye Xuan cultivated his spiritual sense tempering technique, and also taught various martial techniques and cultivation methods to his disciples.

Other than that, he also repeated his gifts to his disciples, obtaining many more heavenly treasures that could increase innate bone value and comprehension value.

At the same time, he finally obtained a ninth-level heart of heavenly lightning.

As long as Ye Xuan refined it, his heavenly lightning intent would reach the perfect-level.

A perfect-level supreme intent!

Still, he had to find an opportunity to refine it. Given his current strength, it would take at least two to three years to completely refine it.

Therefore, he was not in a hurry to do this.

In addition to all that, he obtained more profound martial techniques and cultivation methods. At least, with his current comprehension value, he could not comprehend these techniques.

All in all, Ye Xuan and his disciples had become mobile human-shaped treasure troves. Each one possessed countless rare heavenly treasures and high-level martial techniques, with Ye Xuan having those most.

Together, they had more than even some super forces in the Huangyu Zone.

Ye Xuan had also been improving his alchemy, formation, and artifact refining mastery in the past few months, as did his disciples, albeit at a much slower pace.

After these five months, the current levels of Yue and the others in these three fields were…

Yue

Second-grade artifact refiner (elementary), first-grade alchemist (expert), first-grade formation master (expert)

Li Qingyan

First-grade artifact refiner (expert), second-grade alchemist (intermediate), first-grade formation master (expert)

Zhao Yuyan

First-grade artifact refiner (expert), first-grade alchemist (expert), second-grade formation master (elementary)

Although the improvement of these girls in these three fields was not particularly obvious, the fields that they were good at were not exactly the same.

Therefore, the system rewards that Ye Xuan received were relatively balanced.

At present, Ye Xuan’s level in these three fields was…

Fifth-grade artifact refiner (expert), fifth-grade alchemist (expert), fifth-grade formation master (expert).

After half a year, Ye Xuan had finally surpassed Shangguan Wan’er in these fields. It would soon be time for him to get another round of rewards.

Of course, even with his guidance, it would still be difficult for Shangguan Wan’er to improve too greatly within a short period of time because she was more accomplished in these three fields.

Now, it was time to improve his sword constitution!

In the past six months, while he had been improving his mastery in these three fields, he had been constantly cultivating both his martial intents, as well as tempering his spiritual sense.

Therefore, Ye Xuan had finally regained perfect control of his own power.

Ye Xuan also did not skimp on spiritual power infusion, though he controlled the amount of spiritual power he channeled into his disciples carefully. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Ye Xuan’s physical strength, and the spiritual power in his dantian were no weaker than a middle-stage Human King realm cultivator. That being said, he was still lacking in terms of his martial intents and profound patterns.

As for martial techniques and cultivation methods, Ye Xuan had higher-level ones than they did!

“Yue, today, I will help you strengthen your sword jade body.”

After Ye Xuan instructed Li Qingyan and Zhao Yuyan to cultivate on their own, he called Yue to a separate room in the Tower of Heaven.

Then, Ye Xuan took out a high-level heavenly treasure and helped Yue refine it.

If he could get a decent reward multiplier, perhaps his Sword Overlord body would reach the perfection stage. That way, he would be able to save on the number of heavenly treasures needed to complete the strengthening of his sword constitution, which he could then give to Shangguan Wan’er to awaken and strengthen her sword constitution.

With Ye Xuan’s help, Yue refined quickly.

Right after, Yue’s body trembled, and a powerful aura suddenly erupted from her body.

Her sword jade body had reached the major mastery stage!
