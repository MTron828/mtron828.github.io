822 Chaos-Grade, Eternal Light

Fortunately, this little furry monkey still had great potential when it came to learning, unlike Xiang Yun.

“Ding! The host has taught his disciple the Invincible Golden Body technique and received a 10,000x critical reward from the system.”

Hearing the long-awaited system notification, Ye Xuan was extremely excited.

When his cultivation reached the sealed immortal realm, Ye Xuan could clearly sense that the cultivation technique he had been using this whole while had begun to lag behind, and was not enough to push him much further.

Thus, he hoped for a powerful cultivation technique, which would resolve this issue. The Invincible Golden Body technique could be considered a half-immortal-grade cultivation technique, which meant that it surpassed heaven-grade cultivation techniques by a significant margin.

As such, Ye Xuan was hoping to receive an immortal-grade cultivation technique from the system, and waited anxiously for the next system notification.

“Ding! Congratulations on obtaining a chaos-grade cultivation technique, Eternal Light.”

Chaos-grade?

Was this something that exceeded the immortal-grade? It certainly seemed that way! Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Ye Xuan could not wait to check it out and see what secrets it contained. However, after looking at it for a moment, his heart suddenly trembled.

His soul seemed to have been pulled into the river of the Great Dao. Unknowingly, his soul was strengthened significantly.

‘Hahaha, I’ve really hit the jackpot this time!’

‘With the help of this cultivation technique, I can surpass my previous limits!’

Ye Xuan thought to himself happily. The thing that bothered him the most had been perfectly resolved.

After seriously examining the Eternal Light cultivation technique, Ye Xuan grew more and more surprised. If he cultivated it to its peak, he could reach the eternal realm!

The sealed immortal realm did not really make one immortal. It was just that after reaching the sealed immortal realm, one’s life force would receive a tremendous boost, which gave people the illusion that they were immortal.

In fact, no one knew whether one could obtain true immortality.

Only by continuously increasing one’s cultivation could one increase one’s life force and live longer. The path of cultivation seemed to have no end.

Ye Xuan was not sure if there was an even higher level after the eternal realm. Only time would tell. However, this Eternal Light cultivation technique would make it possible for him to reach the heights where he could find out.

‘Awesome! this cultivation is really quite good,” Ye Xuan thought to himself, feeling very happy.

Over the next 30 days, Ye Xuan stayed in the Seven-Star Cave Abode. He spent his time comprehending and cultivating the Eternal Light cultivation technique, while also teaching Wu Kong.

After some time passed, he gained a rough understanding of this cultivation technique, which caused his spiritual power in his body to become more abundant, and his body was also strengthened.

Under the baptism of the Eternal Light technique, more immortal qi appeared within his body.

A few days later, as the sun rose, Ye Xuan opened his eyes.

In an instant, powerful energy fluctuations swept out, stirring up giant tidal waves in the sea surrounding the island.

Witnessing this scene, the little monkey was scared silly. It hugged a big rock and refused to let go no matter what.

Originally, he had thought that he could slack off while his teacher was cultivating. He had even wanted to tease his teacher.

However, after seeing what had just transpired, the idea was killed in the cradle.

Hiss…

“Teacher is indeed an immortal. Just by sitting there he can release such powerful waves of energy. I have to be obedient. Otherwise, if Teacher catches me and beats me up, I might not be able to withstand it.”

Wu Kong became even more afraid of Ye Xuan. With his fearless personality, this was already very surprising.

“Wu Kong…”

Just as the little furry monkey was about to leave the big rock, Ye Xuan suddenly called him, scaring Wu Kong.

“Teacher, I’m here…”

Without any hesitation, the little monkey immediately replied respectfully.

Ye Xuan stared at the little furry monkey indifferently and asked, “Why are you here? How’s your cultivation today?”

Hearing this, the little monkey did not dare to lie at all.

“Teacher, I’ve already completed today’s cultivation session, but…”

At this point, the little monkey began to stutter, not knowing if it was appropriate to say it.

He had been cultivating here for more than 30 days and was already very familiar with the Invincible Golden Body technique.

Although he had become much stronger, he had also clearly recognized something, which was that his teacher had not taught him any powerful divine powers.

Even though the power in his body was endless, he did not know how to properly use it.

Therefore, if he encountered a powerful opponent, unless he had some way of effectively using the power in his body, he would have to rely on his powerful physical capabilities to exhaust the opponent.

This was actually the reason why he had come to seek out Ye Xuan. If his teacher could teach him divine powers, he would be able to return earlier and teach the monster a good lesson!

After noticing the little monkey’s expression, Ye Xuan already had a rough idea what this was all about, and said with a smile, “When will you change your impatient personality? It’s only been a few days. Can you not withstand just a little waiting?”
