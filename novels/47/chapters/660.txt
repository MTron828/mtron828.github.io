661 Show Of Force (Part 2)

This little girl was at most six years old, so how could her strength have already reached such a terrifying level?

Upon closer inspection, the hammer in her hand did not seem to be ordinary either.

While the crowd was in shock, Daoist Gu Hao’s expression had already turned unsightly. He hurried over to the side of the dead person and carefully examined him.

‘Damn it! All of the bones in his body have been shattered. Her strength has surpassed the million-jin mark!’

!!

This kind of power was not something an ordinary person could possess. Daoist Gu Hao looked at Ye Xuan with a cold gaze.

When Ye Xuan noticed this, he simply returned the cold gaze and said nothing.

“Very good, very good. Ye Xuan, your disciples are really good.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Daoist Gu Hao ordered his subordinates to carry the disciple’s body away.

“You’re too kind,” Ye Xuan said humbly, but he could no longer hide the smile on his face.

They had played themselves, and could only suffer the consequences in silence.

Daoist Gu Hao snorted coldly and turned around to look at a few disciples not far away, who immediately understood Daoist Gu Hao’s meaning and moved toward Feng Xiyun together.

Now the atmosphere was not quite right. The entrance to the ancient realm had just opened, yet there was already someone dead, which dampened everyone’s excitement.

Zhuge Yueyue had also rushed back at this time. After witnessing the attack, her heart was already burning with anger.

As she was busy looking at the path ahead, she did not pay much attention to the situation behind him, which gave the people of the Supreme Divine sect an opportunity.

Fortunately, Xiang Yun was here. Otherwise, Feng Xiyun would have been in real danger.

“Third Sister, what you did just now was really great. Quick, come back over here.”

Making preparations to face the enemy at any moment, Feng Xiyun’s hands released two balls of scorching flames.

After seeing the two balls of terrifying flames, the people from the Supreme Divine sect who had rushed over from behind did not dare to attack rashly, and just stood there stupidly.

However, at that moment, Xiang Yun suddenly spoke.

“Second Sister, you go over to First Sister’s side first. Let me deal with these little minions and beat them up properly.”

Feng Xiyun was taken aback. However, when she saw that Xiang Yun was already waving the hammer around excitedly, she laughed out loud.

“Alright, I’ll leave these small fries to you. I’ll stand guard here for you though. Go ahead and play with them.”

After obtaining her second sister’s permission, Xiang Yun twirled the hammer in her hand happily.

“Here I come!”

As soon as she finished speaking, her figure shot out like a cannonball.

“F*ck …” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

The people from the Supreme Divine sect were caught off guard. Because she was so small, they could only see the approaching hammer.

However, they did not dare to hold back and used all their strength to resist.

However, the moment their weapons touched the potato hammer, their arms immediately went numb.

It was as if there was a huge mountain pressing down on their heads. There was no way to resist it at all. They were smashed into the ground like carrots.

The Daoist Gu Hao suddenly stood up in anger. He had originally wanted these few people to deal with this little girl, but he did not expect that they would be dealt with instead, and in one move too.

“Pfft… I’m dying of laughter…”

Gao Shun picked the right time to laugh, and stared directly at the Supreme Divine sect’s forces.

“Ooh, which sect’s disciples got beaten up by a little girl? Is it yours, Daoist Black Iron? How embarrassing!”

“Gao Shun! Don’t go too far.”

Daoist Black Iron was about to explode from anger. This was simply an undisguised insult.

This little girl was obviously not a spiritual cultivator, yet had beaten several of their disciples to a pulp. This was truly a slap on the face.

Pretending to think hard for a moment, Gao Shun suddenly slapped his thigh and shouted, “Oh? They really are from your Supreme Divine sect? I see, I see… Hahaha…”

After hearing these words, Daoist Black Iron spurted out a few mouthfuls of blood.

“Master! Are you okay?”

The group of disciples standing beside Daoist Black Iron nervously rushed up to support him, but were immediately pushed away by him.

“Useless, completely useless! What are you all doing? Attack together. I don’t believe that this little girl can turn the world upside down!”

After hearing Daoist Black Iron’s order, a group of people instantly surrounded Xiang Yun.

Xiang Yun did not panic at all when she saw the menacing group of people. In fact, she was eager to give it a go.

“Ooh, more scrubs. Hurry up and come over. Send as many people as you can. Otherwise, I won’t have enough fun.”

“Little girl, you’re simply too arrogant. Are you tired of living?”

One of the Supreme Divine sect’s disciples, who was at the middle-stage of the void realm, roared and launched a fierce attack.

In an instant, he had already arrived in front of her. However, his charge and attack were met with a huge hammer.

A deafening roar erupted, and there were even flashes of lightning. The whole scene was very shocking.

By the time the lightning had completely dissipated, the disciple who had just launched the attack was lying in a deep pit.

“Damn it! Let’s join forces and show her our power!”

After seeing this scene, the rest of the group could no longer bear it. If they took turns to attack her, she would probably bury them all.

All of them surrounded Xiang Yun, and colorful lights appeared alternately as their attacks were fired at her.

Boom ..

...

With a loud explosion, a huge ball of smoke and fire exploded, immediately pushing back the disciples of the Supreme Divine sect.

Moments later, Zhuge Yueyue also rushed over and unleashed several sword beams to knock down a few people. At the same time, she also brought Xiang Yun out…
