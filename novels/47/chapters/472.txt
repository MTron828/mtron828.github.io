473 Departing

Hearing this, Gongsun Shouyue nodded in relief.

The Great Wilderness Divine sect was united. Sure, there were some conflicts between peaks, but at critical moments, everyone would come together to fight their enemies.

Suddenly, Gongsun Shouyue’s gaze fell on Ye Xuan, who was not far away. He was surprised to find that the latter was silent.

“What do you think,Junior Brother Ye?” Gongsun Shouyue asked.

Ye Xuan was taken aback.

He had attended many meetings, but this was the first time Gongsun Shouyue had taken the initiative to ask for his opinion.

It seemed that his status had really changed in the past three months.

Ye Xuan smiled.

“Since Senior Brother Gongsun has made a decision, then I will abide by it.”

“Speaking of which, the heaven devouring divine sparrow and my Cloud Sky peak are tied together by fate. I’ll personally finish what my teacher started back then.”

As soon as he finished speaking, everyone’s eyes were filled with shock, and they looked at Ye Xuan with admiration.

They naturally knew how terrifying the heaven devouring divine sparrow was, but even so, they did not sense the slightest bit of fear from Ye Xuan.

Then again, even to this day, they were unsure of Ye Xuan’s true strength.

After receiving Ye Xuan’s reply, Gongsun Shouyue felt much more at ease.

“Very good! That’s the answer I wanted to hear,” Gongsun Shouyue laughed and said in a clear voice.

“According to the usual arrangements, each of you will act to pursue the heaven devouring divine sparrow!”

“You must remember that the heaven devouring divine sparrow is extremely terrifying. Unless you have no other choice, don’t take any risks. You must contact the others immediately and join forces to annihilate it.”

“The Great Wilderness Divine sect is not the only sect participating in this operation. The top holy lands of the Yangli divine empire are also included. As soon as they see the designated signal, they will immediately rush over!”

“With so many experts working together, we’ll definitely be able to kill the heaven devouring divine sparrow!”

“Got it, Sect Master,” all of the chiefs said in unison.

“Mm! You guys can go back and prepare!”

Then, everyone left the meeting hall.

Ye Xuan’s expression had subtly changed.

When Yuelun noticed, her curiosity got the better of her..

“Junior Brother Ye, what’s wrong? Did something happen?”

“Nothing,” Ye Xuan shook his head and said, “I was thinking about something just now, but I don’t have any clues yet.”

“When will Senior Sister depart?”

“It should be tomorrow. However, I still have some things to deal with before I leave. When do you plan to depart?” Yuelun asked with a smile.

“Umm… Now,” Ye Xuan thought for a moment before saying.

“Isn’t that a little rushed?”

“I have a strange feeling that there will be a major change in the near future, so it’s better to settle the matter of the heaven devouring divine sparrow as soon as possible.”

“Senior Sister Yuelun, if there’s nothing important, I’ll return to Cloud Sky peak first.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan flicked his sleeve and turned into a streak of light that flew toward Cloud Sky peak.

“A major change?”

Yuelun was confused by Ye Xuan’s words.

However, there was one thing that Ye Xuan was right about, which was that this matter was best settled as soon as possible, before things got out of hand.

The moment Ye Xuan returned to Cloud Sky peak, he immediately called Feng Xiyun and Su Changhe over.

Zhuge Yueyue was at the critical moment of breaking through, so Ye Xuan did not disturb her.

“Teacher, what happened?” Feng Xiyun asked doubtfully.

Feng Xiyun had noticed Ye Xuan’s departure to the meeting hall. Seeing his serious expression when he returned, she knew that something big must have happened.

Ye Xuan was silent for a moment, and then said, “Xiyun, I might have to leave the sect for a while, and your senior sister is still at a critical moment of breaking through. For now, you’ll be in charge of all the affairs on Cloud Sky peak.”

“Can you do it?”

“Ah…” When Feng Xiyun heard this, she was dumbfounded. After she regained her senses, she hurriedly asked, “Teacher, what will be doing out there? When will you be back?”

“It’s just a small matter. I’ll come back once I’m done, so don’t worry.”

Ye Xuan chuckled, and then his gaze fell on Su Changhe.

“Kid, didn’t you want to follow me around? This time, I’ll take you out to see the world.”

When Su Changhe heard this, he was at first stunned, and then his eyes were filled with ecstasy.

‘Oh my God, am I hearing this right? Chief Ye Xuan wants to bring me with him to the outside world?’

‘Oh my God, the moment has finally come. I’ve been content with my place for the past month, but I’m starting to miss the feeling of acting cool!’

Of course, although Su Changhe was inwardly ecstatic, he still kept a straight face and ran to Ye Xuan like an obedient follower.

After that, he looked at Feng Xiyun with a proud expression.

“Big Sister Xiyun, I’m going to go out to see the world. You can stay on Cloud Sky peak!”

“Get lost!” Hearing this, Feng Xiyun rolled her eyes in annoyance.

‘Wasn’t Teacher being a little too biased? He didn’t bring his own disciple along, but this flunky instead…’

...

What was the use of having this guy around? He was not strong, and he liked to cause trouble everywhere. Was he not just annoying?

Thinking this, she pouted.

Of course, she knew that her teacher had his reasons for doing this, so she did not voice her dissatisfaction.

“Hahaha! You can stay here and be envious. I’ll be leaving first, bye!”

Su Changhe decisively ignored Feng Xiyun’s eye roll and followed Ye Xuan down the mountain.

With Chief Ye Xuan as his backing, who would dare to mess with him?

He was going to stand tall! Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The two of them left Cloud Sky peak and headed straight for Qingyang City.

Su Changhe was particularly excited throughout the journey. He could not help but whistle whenever he saw a beautiful woman. His face was akin to that of a villain who had achieved success.

It was as if he was telling those beautiful women, “Look at me! I have an awesome backer!”
