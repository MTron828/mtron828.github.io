Chapter 156: We Meet Again

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

By chance, Yue had found an extremely special spirit fruit.

Although she did not know what it was, judging from the strong spiritual energy fluctuations it exuded, it was obviously an extremely rare heavenly treasure.

However, just as she was about to leave with the spirit fruit, an uninvited guest appeared.

A monk descended from the sky and muttered, “Almsgiver, this item is fated with Buddhism. I hope that you can part with it!”

Yue naturally did not agree. The monk immediately flew into a rage and tried to snatch Yue’s storage ring.

How could Yue just stand by and watch him do that? Her storage ring not only contained the spiritual fruit that she had just obtained, but also the gifts that Ye Xuan had given her.

However, what frightened her was that this monk’s aura was extremely terrifying. Based on the spiritual pressure he exuded, this monk seemed to be almost as strong as her teacher.

Yue immediately used the offensive jade token that Ye Xuan had given her.

In an instant, resplendent and tyrannical sword qi soared into the sky and slashed toward the monk.

When the monk saw this, he was immediately shocked. However, a single sword qi attack would not be able to injure him.

Yue was also very decisive. When the attack failed, she immediately used her speed-boosting jade token and frantically fled for her life.

However, as time passed, Yue became puzzled.

The terrifying monk that was chasing her seemed to be getting further and further away.

What Yue did not know was that, although the monk had torn apart the sword qi and chased her for a while, his expression quickly changed.

He felt an extremely familiar aura from this sword qi attack.

It was that young unity realm expert’s sword qi!

Although in terms of power, it could not compare to the terrifying sword qi that Ye Xuan had used when he fought with him earlier, it was indeed the power of the same person.

The offensive jade token had been refined by Ye Xuan when he was at the peak of the core formation realm. Naturally, it would not be able to harm the monk.

However, it still scared the monk.

This little girl was either that person’s sister, or his disciple.

The monk had not expected to encounter someone related to that person after running for so long.

He immediately decided to stop chasing. After all, he could not guarantee that the girl still had another trump card from that person.

Then, the monk turned into a streak of light and ran away frantically. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Teacher!”

Yue, who was running away in a sorry state, lit up when she saw Ye Xuan appear.

“Yue, fly in the direction I came from. Huang Ling is there!”

“I’ll be right back!”

Ye Xuan only said a few words before flying off and disappearing into the distance.

“Okay, Teacher!”

Seeing this, Yue was happy.

Her teacher was undoubtedly going to chase that damn monk.

She had not expected her teacher to be so close by. This made her feel much safer.

Swoosh!

The monk who was frantically fleeing into the distance suddenly felt a terrifying aura sweeping toward him.

When he turned around to look, he was so scared that he almost fell from the sky.

“F*ck! It’s him…”

The monk started to tremble..

How did this fellow appear here?

This mystic realm was so vast, and he had spent all that time running and hiding his tracks. How did he still manage to run into this fiend?

Could it be that this guy also wanted to go to the Heavenly Lightning Pool?

Damn it! How could I have not thought of that?

The monk wanted to slap himself.

However, he was not too flustered. Ye Xuan could indeed overpower him, but he had to catch up first. He could just crush a few more Buddhist beads to escape.

He glanced at the Buddhist beads in his hand with a pained expression. He then gritted his teeth and crushed two more.

These things were very precious, and they were consumables. One bead crushed was one bead less he had.

However, now that he was facing a life-and-death situation, he had to make a decisive choice. Otherwise, it was very likely that he would die in Ye Xuan’s hands.

After the monk crushed the Buddhist beads, and then his speed increased like crazy.

However, when he turned around to look, his expression changed drastically again.

“How is this possible?”

Ye Xuan’s speed had also increased. Not only had Ye Xuan matched his speed, it even felt like he was catching up.

The monk was completely shocked.

Did this guy also use his trump card? Moreover, this fellow had a murderous look on his face. It was obvious that he would not rest until one of them was dead!

“Master, I feel that we are fated to meet. Why don’t you stay and have a cup of tea?”

At this moment, a mocking voice suddenly rang out in the monk’s ears.

The monk was so frightened that he immediately jumped up. His entire body was covered in goosebumps.

This guy had already caught up to him!

He had already crushed two Buddhist beads, and crushing any more would not increase his speed any further.

Whoosh!

The streak of light caught up to the monk in an instant.

At the same time, the monk also sensed Ye Xuan’s aura, and his expression immediately changed.

There were no traces of augmented power around him. Did this not mean that his current speed was achieved by his own strength?

That did not make sense!

When they had met previously, he had not been as strong or as fast!

Ye Xuan smiled coldly. Then, he slowly raised his right fist and struck.

It was a very simple and violent punch. It did not contain the slightest bit of the fist intent that he had comprehended earlier.

Even so, the monk was terrified. He could actually sense…

Death!

Although the punch looked ordinary, he knew that if it struck him, he would die without a doubt!

Bang! Bang!

Immediately, the monk decisively crushed two Buddhist beads in his hand, which created a two-layered energy barrier around his body.

However…

Boom!

When Ye Xuan’s fist touched the first layer of the energy barriers, cracks quickly appeared. Moments later, the first layer shattered. The monk was dumbfounded!
