359 Birth Of A Divine Bone

The heavenly marrow pill was a supreme-grade earth rank pill, and its medicinal effect was thousands of times better than the marrow cleansing pill.

As long as he consumed it, it could greatly improve his aptitude and level of talent.

“Tsk, tsk, tsk, it feels so good to have the cheat-like system back again!”

“This girl is really my lucky star. A 1,000 times multiplier!”

!!

Looking at the heavenly marrow pill that had appeared in the system storage space, Ye Xuan was full of smiles.

Suddenly, an idea came to Ye Xuan’s mind.

After a while, Zhuge Yueyue returned.

“Teacher! I’m fine now,” she said.

Ye Xuan nodded, and then continued, “I thought about it just now. Although the marrow cleansing pill can remove the impurities in your body and allow you to better sense the world’s spiritual energy, if you want to become an outstanding person among your peers, it’s still lacking.”

“It just so happens that I have a heavenly marrow pill. As long as you take it, your body will undergo a major transformation.”

Under normal circumstances, there was a cooldown period of one month for the system’s rewards when giving the same category of items to the same disciple.

However, after the system upgrade, there was a free and unconditional reward.

In other words, if he gave the heavenly marrow pill to Zhuge Yueyue, he would still receive a reward from the system.

“Ah?”

When Zhuge Yueyue heard this, she was stunned.

Was her teacher joking? Why was he being so nice to her?

More importantly, if her teacher had such a precious high-grade pill, why did he not consume it himself?

Her heart was filled with gratitude.

Perhaps her teacher did not want him to be looked down upon by her peers, or perhaps he wanted her to become stronger as soon as possible so that she could avenge her parents.

Then, she recalled those words back at the meeting hall. She clenched her fist and her eyes turned cold.

‘Hmph! I’ll engrave the insults you’ve hurled at Teacher in my heart!’

‘Once I’m strong enough, I will definitely seek justice for Teacher!’

Zhuge Yueyue swore inwardly and accepted Ye Xuan’s pill.

“I will remember Teacher’s great kindness and do my best to make you proud.”

As soon as she finished speaking, Zhuge Yueyue tried to kneel down in front of Ye Xuan.

“Silly girl! Since you’re my disciple, these things are only what you deserve. Don’t think too much about it and just take the pill.”

Ye Xuan did not know what Zhuge Yueyue was thinking. What he cared about was what kind of reward he would receive from the system this time.

“En!” Zhuge Yueyue nodded and took the pill.

Moments later, an extremely dense and warm current suddenly surged into her body. As Zhuge Yueyue’s impurities had been cleared by the earlier, the medicinal power of the heavenly marrow pill was used to transform her meridians.

Originally, Zhuge Yueyue’s level of talent was average, and she did not have any divine bones in her body.

However, thanks to the heaven-defying effect of the heavenly marrow pill, a new divine bone was born in the deepest part of Zhuge Yueyue’s meridians.

Furthermore, it was the extremely rare profound ice divine bone!

When Ye Xuan saw this, he was shocked.

The profound ice divine bone was of the highest quality among the divine bones and far surpassed the divine bone of the young man in the hall!

As expected of the heavenly marrow pill, its medicinal power was really heaven-defying!

“Ding! As the host has given his disciple a heavenly marrow pill, the host has received a randomized 99x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the profound marrow pill!”

“Ding! As the host has already used one free reward chance, the reward cooldown period has been reinstated.”

“Profound marrow pill! This is good stuff!”

Although he only had one chance to use the free reward chance, Ye Xuan was already very satisfied.

In the past hundred years, Ye Xuan had suffered countless grievances in the Cloud Sky peak. If Zhuge Yueyue was not beside him, he would have laughed openly without caring about his image.

Still, the profound marrow pill was only the beginning.

Beside him, Zhuge Yueyue’s cultivation aptitude was being transformed by the heavenly marrow pill.

After a long time passed, Zhuge Yueyue finally finished digesting the medicinal power of the pill.

Her eyes were filled with shock when she examined the huge changes her body had undergone.

She now had a divine bone!

Zhuge Yueyue had never expected that her teacher would use such a precious pill that allowed her body to give birth to a high-level divine bone despite only just having become his disciple. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

How could she repay such a great favor?

“Thank you, Teacher. I will never forget kindness!”

Zhuge Yueyue did not know how to express the gratitude in her heart.

With this divine bone, her cultivation speed would definitely improve by leaps and bounds, and there would be hope for her to avenge her parents.

“It’s just a small matter. There’s no need to say anything more. Quickly, get up,” Ye Xuan said with a smile as he looked at Zhuge Yueyue, who was kneeling on the ground.

“Every 60 years, the Great Wilderness Divine sect will hold a Seven Peaks competition. As the first disciple of Cloud Sky peak, you are naturally the only candidate from our side who can participate.”

“I hope that you can represent Cloud Sky peak and get a good ranking in the competition three months from now,” Ye Xuan continued.

Before the system’s awakening, he had not bothered much with the sect’s affairs.

However, things were different now. His awesome cheat-like system had awakened, so he had to show off!

Moreover, participating in this competition would improve Yueyue’s combat experience and awareness.
