753 Who Is Provoking Who?

Gao Shun turned to Hua Rufeng and instructed, “Rufeng, lead 3,000 disciples to the entrance of the formation first to prevent any unexpected incidents from happening and help ensure the safety of the people entering.”

“Then, pass a message to the disciples of Hidden Sword peak and Returning Cloud peak to settle these people down safely. There must be no mistakes.”

“Yes, Martial Uncle.”

Hua Rufeng then quickly set off to handle these matters.

As time passed, things remained calm at Sky Mountain despite the oncoming disaster. Although the berserk beasts were ravaging the land, they had yet to reach Sky Mountain.

The next morning, Gao Shun was making arrangements to deal with the disaster when he suddenly sensed a bloody aura. He immediately turned to look outside, and realized that the plains below Sky Mountain were filled with berserk beasts!

These beasts all had bloodshot eyes as they charged toward the mountain.

“Start defending immediately!”

Gao Shun shouted without hesitation. Fortunately, over the past few days, they had already made ample preparations for this eventuality. Moreover, they had managed to settle most of the latecomers in.

At this moment, the defenders were unprecedentedly nervous, ready for a vicious and drawn out battle against these bloodthirsty beasts.

However, to their surprise, these beasts did not attack head-on at all, and instead spent an entire day circling around Sky Mountain.

“This… What’s going on?”

When he saw that the mountain was surrounded by the berserk beasts, Gao Shun was taken aback.

“Shouldn’t these berserk beasts have lost all sense of intelligence and rationality? Why are they acting like this? It’s almost as if someone is controlling them.”

Before he could figure things out, the sky instantly darkened and glowed and eerie red.

Almost everyone looked up at the same time, and saw that a huge skeleton was slowly condensing in the sky above Sky Mountain.

“F*ck… It’s this thing again!”

At this moment, everyone’s hearts hit rock bottom. They could all recall the sheer power displayed by this huge skeleton when it first appeared. It was like the Grim Reaper, robbing everything around it of life.

No one expected it to appear here, and the situation was looking grim indeed. Furthermore, their scouts had earlier reported that this thing had become even stronger after being empowered by the black fog. How could they resist an ancient realm existence like this?

Even Gao Shun felt frightened. Their plan was centered around dealing with the berserk beasts, not this skeleton!

“Martial Uncle Gao, what should we do now?”

Hua Rufeng came over to Gao Shun’s side with a nervous expression, his heart beating rapidly. The other disciples also quietly and vigilantly waited for Gao Shun’s orders. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Gao Shun glanced at these disciples. They were all the future pillars of the Great Wilderness Divine sect!

At this moment, his heart once again beat fiercely as he gathered his courage to face the skeleton.

“Heavens! Second Sister, this skeleton is so big.”

Before Gao Shun could say anything to the disciples, a clear voice rang out, drawing everyone’s attention.

Xiang Yun had climbed up a giant tree to get a better look at the skeleton. She was also pointing and waving at it.

“Oh my god…”

“Junior Sister, you can’t just randomly point at this monster. If you’re not careful, you’ll lose your life.”

The disciples of the Great Wilderness Divine sect became extremely flustered.

After all, this monster had reached the ancient realm. How could it tolerate being offended by a young girl?

How could she point at it so openly? Was that not an affront to its dignity?

“Third Sister!”

Feng Xiyun also tried to get Xiang Yun to restrain herself, but it was too late now.

The huge skeleton in the sky had already spotted Xiang Yun and heard her.

Seconds later, its terrifying aura swept out in her direction.

How could the dignity of an ancient realm expert be offended?

It had to teach this little girl an unforgettable lesson.

Seeing this, everyone felt despair. There was no way to save her at all.

On the other hand, the target of this terrifying aura, Xiang Yun, was feeling rather unhappy at how uncomfortable it made her feel.

Suddenly, a shadowy figure materialized behind her, and glazed at the huge skeleton casually.

Boom!

Sky Mountain shook violently, and by the time everyone realized what was going on, they could tell that the huge skeleton in the sky seemed to have suffered a great deal of damage. The black fog surrounding its body had weakened significantly, and it almost fell from the sky.

“Heavens!”

Everyone was completely dumbfounded.
