727 Impending Disaster

Thank you readers!

After hearing this disciple’s tale, the main hall fell silent. No one spoke.

After a long while, Gao Shun said with a serious expression, “It is likely the day we fear will arrive very soon”

They had already known about the crack in that desert region a long time ago. After all, on the other side of the crack was the realm that contained the strange power.

The berserk beast invasion that happened not long ago was also due to this strange power. Thanks to Mo Nan’s selfishness, the entire East continent was now in danger.

If the strange power could not be suppressed at all, then the inhabitants of the entire East continent might become puppets of the strange power.

According to the current situation, the East continent was a huge cage. The worldly power at the boundaries meant that no one could enter or leave.

The chiefs remained silent, their eyes fixed on Ao lei.

“I went to check it myself yesterday. The crack has become much bigger,” he said slowly.

“The beasts in the desert region have been infected by the strange power, and have become mindless killing machines.”

“Everyone, we might really have to fight a fierce battle soon.”

Everyone’s expression was heavy.

“Fortunately, up until now, the area affected by the strange power is still confined to that desert region.”

“However, I’m afraid that it won’t be long before that changes.”

“As more and more beasts fall under its control, I’m afraid that the East continent will descend into chaos and destruction.”

Zhuge Yueyue’s heart began to tremble wildly. She deeply understood the terror of the strange power. After all, her parents had fallen victim to it.

If the strange power occupied the entire desert region, the beasts inside it would soon pour out into the outside world. When that happened, there would probably be no place in the East continent to hide.

Even some of the most powerful sects in the East continent would not escape the fate of being attacked, and perhaps overrun by beasts.

Even the Great Wilderness Divine sect would face the same situation.

Zhuge Yueyue became even more flustered at the thought of this. She did not know about the situation of the other peaks, but she knew that on Cloud Sky peak, the only fighting force was herself, Feng Xiyun and Xiang Yun.

If the beasts really attacked while her teacher was in seclusion, Cloud Sky peak would probably be the first peak to fall to the beasts.

Thinking this, Zhuge Yueyue’s mind began to spin rapidly, thinking of a way to resolve this problem and defend her home. What made her feel better was that according to what Martial Uncle Ao had said, there was still time until the worst-case scenario happened.

During that time, she had to reach the heaven realm so that she would have a fighting chance of defending Cloud Sky peak.

Moreover, she also had to find and prepare trump cards.

Li Hanyi’s expression was equally as dark.

Compared to the Cloud Sky peak, it seemed that the possibility of Water Sky peak being defeated was higher. The terrain around Cloud Sky peak was difficult to assail, and some time ago, Chief Tian Xuan had even set up a defensive formation around Cloud Sky peak, which had been further improved by Ye Xuan.

However, Water Sky Peak peak had neither of those advantages. Aside from Yuelun, most of the other elders and disciples on the peak were rather weak. Their only advantage was numbers. However, the beasts would come in even greater numbers.

After hearing Ao Lei’s words, the hall remained silent.

Seeing their solemn expressions, Ao Lei continued, “As a precaution, I plan to completely activate the mountain’s guardian formation today.”

“Remind all of the sect members, including the elders, that if there’s nothing important, not to leave the sect’s grounds.”

“As for those disciples who are still traveling in the outside world, call them back immediately.”

“Also, activate your respective peaks’ defensive formations as well.”

As soon as he finished speaking, the chiefs present nodded and agreed. They would activate it the moment they returned.

However, after a moment, Gao Shun suddenly thought of something and said, “Senior Brother Ao, if we activate the guardian formation, how should we handle the matter of recruiting disciples?”

Now, they were already preparing for the disciple recruitment ceremony so that they could recruit the many geniuses waiting to join the sect. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

However, who would have expected that the realm containing the strange power would interfere and disrupt their plans?

Fortunately, they had noticed the situation in advance. If they had only noticed it when disaster struck, the sect might have perished.

What they were currently concerned about was whether the disciple recruitment ceremony could be held as scheduled. It would be a waste not to ride on the sect’s success at the gathering.

Ao Lei pondered this matter.After a moment, he said, “Alright, the situation now is still acceptable. Let’s hold it according to the agreed upon date.”

“I’ve just sent someone to keep an eye on the desert region. If the situation changes, they’ll immediately report back.”

“During this period, you guys should also seize the time to arrange everything properly. Whether or not you can accept genius disciples depends on your own abilities.”

“Got it.”

Everyone hurriedly replied and then went back with heavy expressions.
