715 More Disciples?

Ye Xuan felt that taking in three disciples was enough. Even though he had the system, having too many disciples would distract from his own cultivation, and would also make it difficult for him to effectively nurture his disciples.

Thank you readers!

Quality of quantity seemed to be the best approach at this moment.

Furthermore, the system now had the couple system function, and he had the perfect candidate for this in front of him right now.

“Cough cough, I haven’t thought about how many disciples I should take in either, but there’s a high chance that I won’t be taking in any more. After all, the most wonderful thing about Cloud Sky peak is that everyone feels like family. Having too many disciples will only break this balance of harmony.”

“Instead, I hope that Senior Sister Yuelun will accept a few more genius disciples.”

Seeing that Ye Xuan was not joking, Yuelun was shocked.

This was an opportunity for Cloud Sky peak to develop and become the strongest faction within the Great Wilderness Divine sect, yet Ye Xuan was throwing it away?

However, after thinking about it seriously, Yuelun realized that this was normal for Cloud Sky peak. Even the past chiefs of Cloud Sky peak did not take in many disciples, and many even only took in one disciple, like Tian Xuan.

In comparison, Ye Xuan was the anomaly with three disciples.

It seemed that this had already become a common practice when it came to Cloud Sky peak. That being said, the disciples they recruited were almost always powerful.

Unlike the other peaks, it seemed that Cloud Sky peak’s strategy was to put all their eggs in one basket, or just a few baskets.

Each of Ye Xuan’s disciples had already exhibited terrifying levels of potential and strength. At some point, they would become recognized as peerless experts in their own right, and not just geniuses.

“Haha, then I’ll accept Junior Brother Ye’s kind words. My disciples don’t have the level of talent that yours do, so we can only make up for it by trying to recruit more.”

Yuelun said this with a smile, but she could not help but feel a little depressed. Among her disciples, the only one that could remotely compare with Ye Xuan’s was Li Hanyi.

“Senior Sister, why do you look a little dejected?”

Ye Xuan smiled and asked in confusion.

When Yuelun heard this, she rolled his eyes at him helplessly. This brat was the reason! Anyone would be depressed to compare themselves with him. This guy only knew how to destroy other people’s self-confidence all day long!

It was really infuriating! Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“There’s one more thing. Senior Sister Yuelun, you haven’t forgotten what I told you not long ago, have you?”

At this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly thought of something and whispered into her ear.

Yuelun’s entire body tensed up when this happened, feeling very flustered.

Then, she remembered that Ye Xuan had invited her to Cloud Sky peak to have a good chat when she was free. Moreover, Ye Xuan even said that he would give her a gift.

What kind of gift would it be?

“Why are you being so secretive about this? Junior Brother Ye, what are you going to give me? Hurry up and say it. Don’t leave me hanging!”

Ye Xuan smiled mischievously. Then, he leaned closer to her ear and blew gently, instantly causing her face to turn red.

She immediately turned around and looked behind her. When she saw the disciples had not noticed what was going on, she heaved a sigh of relief.

At this moment, Ye Xuan took out another medicinal pill from his storage space, which released a profound medicinal fragrance.

“Is this an immortal-grade pill?”

Yuelun exclaimed in shock. His eyes were fixed on the pill in Ye Xuan’s hand, not knowing how to react.

Why did he take this precious pill out? Was he going to give it to her?

It could not be, right?

After all, this pill was too valuable!

However, she knew that if she consumed this pill, it would not take long for her to break through and reach the supreme realm.

The pill in Ye Xuan’s hand was an immortal-grade blood replenishment pill.

Although it was a recovery pill, the immense amount of energy contained within it would also increase the cultivation level of the person who consumed it.

Since Ye Xuan already had many recovery pills, he temporarily put aside this immortal-grade blood replenishment pill for Yuelun. If he wanted to successfully pursue Yuelun, he would have to put in effort.
