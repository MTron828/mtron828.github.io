312 Leaving Seclusion, More Rewards

“Teacher, you’re finally out! I missed you so much!”

His youngest disciple was still as adorable as ever.

“Mm! It seems that you’ve all been cultivating quite diligently, and haven’t disappointed me.”

Ye Xuan briefly examined the cultivation levels of his disciples and displayed a satisfied smile.

After Yue’s sword jade body reached the great mastery stage, her strength had continued to grow steadily. After six years of cultivation, she had now reached the middle stage of the golden core realm.

Although Li Qingyan’s dual-spirit body had yet to break through to the great mastery stage, she had been infused with spiritual power a few times before Ye Xuan went into seclusion. After a few years of cultivating, she was now a late-stage golden core realm cultivator.

Zhao Yuyan’s talent was second only to Shangguan Wan’er’s. This little girl could now freely control her Demon Devourer body and selectively devour heavenly treasures, and even other peoples’ spiritual power. She had reached the middle stage of the true core realm.

As for Shangguan Wan’er, although she was still a four-pattern condensation realm cultivator, her strength had increased greatly in other aspects. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

She had comprehended fifth-level heavenly lightning intent, and fourth-level slaughter intent.

Furthermore, her water, ice, and metal intents had reached the eighth level!

Keeping Ye Xuan’s instructions in mind, she had avoided comprehending sword intent, which was still at the seventh-level.

There was one thing all of his disciples shared in common though, which was that they had achieved perfect control of their own power.

“Since I’ve left secluded cultivation, it’s time for me to help you all improve your strength!”

Ye Xuan looked at his disciples happily. He was in a good mood.

His disciples were overjoyed when they heard this.

In the past six years, although they still made rapid progress in comparison to other cultivators, it was much slower than when Ye Xuan was assisting them.

After that, it was time for Ye Xuan to reap bountiful rewards.

Cultivation methods, martial techniques, pills, and heavenly treasures were first, followed by spiritual power infusion.

As for artifacts, Ye Xuan held back for the time being, because he had a better idea in mind, which was to give away the Tower of Heaven.

After that, he became their sparring partner to help increase their combat experience and awareness

The gap between Ye Xuan’s strength and that of his disciples’ had grown after six years, and even Shangguan Wan’er could only look on with respect and admiration.

In order to increase his disciples’ combat experience, Ye Xuan deliberately suppressed his own strength to the point where he was evenly matched with each disciple when they became his opponent.

After ten days and ten nights, Ye Xuan ended the sparring sessions.

While his disciples gained many insights, Ye Xuan also gained a lot of actual combat experience from the system.
