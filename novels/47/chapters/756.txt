757 Mengyu (Part 4)

Daoist Yi Feng’s inner demons were triggered after witnessing his seniors fall in battle in front of him.

Among the remaining 30,000 members of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, almost every one of them had suffered extremely serious injuries.

Daoist Yi Feng even self-destructed his divine bones, severely injuring Mengyu. Then, he split the weapon in his hand into two and stabbed it into Mengyu’s chest, killing her.

However, who would have thought that Mengyu, who they believed had been killed long ago, was still alive and well?

“It’s one thing for her to be alive, but she might even have reached the ancient realm. She’ll definitely come back to take revenge on us.”

After learning about this matter, everyone fell silent.

No one had expected Mengyu to be so crazy that she even wanted to sacrifice the entire East continent for her personal gain.

In that great battle, the sect master had died. Among the seven chiefs, only the chief of Cloud Sky peak, Tian Xuan, survived.

However, because Daoist Yi Feng had self-destructed his divine bones, Chief Tian Xuan had no choice but to use his origin secret technique to save Daoist Yi Feng, at the cost of suffering serious injuries himself.

After returning to the Cloud Sky peak, he never showed his face again. Ten years later, Chief Tian Xuan, who had been in seclusion for a long time, suddenly came out and recruited a young man from the outside world. He accepted this young man as his disciple and announced that this young man would replace him as the next chief of Cloud Sky peak.

After making all the necessary arrangements, Chief Tian Xuan handed the matters of the peak over to the young man before leaving.

This young man was obviously Ye Xuan.

From the very beginning, everyone thought that Ye Xuan would be as talented as Chief Tian Xuan. However, the opposite turned out to be true, as Ye Xuan was just a disciple with ordinary levels of talent. He was not as talented as they had imagined.

This was also the reason why Gao Shun hated Ye Xuan so much back then.

After all, Gao Shun knew how talented Tian Xuan was, and could not understand why he had recruited someone so ordinary as his successor.

Cloud Sky peak, which had always overshadowed Hidden Sword peak, faded away into obscurity, which made Gao Shun believe that Ye Xuan was useless.

As such, he repeatedly tried to anger Ye Xuan so that the latter would work hard and cultivate diligently to fill Tian Xuan’s shoes.

However, what made him feel helpless was that Ye Xuan completely ignored him…

“I never imagined that our Great Wilderness Divine sect was hiding such a big secret.”

After hearing Gao Shun recount the matter in detail, everyone felt moved, but also somewhat sympathetic toward Daoist Yi Feng’s experience.

However, they also understood that it was due to the swift actions of the Great Wilderness Divine sect that a catastrophe was averted, though they could not understand why it had been kept secret.

Perhaps every time this matter was brought up, the people of the Great Wilderness Divine sect felt that old scars were being reopened, and thus chose to hide it completely. That did not dampen their admiration for the Great Wilderness Divine sect in the slightest though, as the sacrifice the sect had paid to ensure the safety of the East continent was plain to see.

“I have to say that the Great Wilderness Divine sect is truly worthy of being the number one force in our East continent.”

“I’m getting goosebumps even thinking about what happened back then. It must have been a tragedy.”

“After countless disciples died, they finally won… However, who would have thought that this demoness is still alive and well? Still, who can deny what they did back then? If they had not acted back then, today probably would not exist.”

At this moment, people recalled what Zhuge Yueyue had said during the gathering. The Dao of Protection, for which one grew stronger in order to protect those around them. It seemed that the Great Wilderness Divine sect were indeed true to their credo.

Their reverence for the sect rose to a new level.

However, they still had to face and overcome this current disaster.

“Martial Uncle Gao, what should we do now?” Hua Rufeng asked.

“There are millions of berserk beasts outside there. If we can’t maintain the line of defense, tens of millions of people will die.” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Also, that demoness said she was going to come back…”

“When she does, how should we deal with them?”

Everyone turned their gazes to Gao Shun in unison, seeking guidance.

However, Gao Shun did not have a solution to this problem. He simply said, “Rufeng, help me oversee the situation first. I have to rush back to the Great Wilderness Divine sect to report this matter.”

“The defensive formation we’ve built is quite strong, and should be able to last at least a few months if it’s just those berserk beasts.”

“The pressing matter is Mengyu, and I need the input of the other chiefs before deciding our next course of action.”

“For now, defend!”
