Chapter 30: Yunhei City

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Seeing this, Huang Ling and Xue Min were moved.

Was this the legendary VIP treatment? Although they could only experience it once, they were satisfied.

With Ye Xuan’s help, they could be said to have refined the Dark Glacial Frost perfectly. Moreover, after completely refining the Dark Glacial Frost, they could clearly sense that their innate bone value had increased a little.

Huang Ling and Xue Min then said goodbye to Ye Xuan and joyfully returned to their respective rooms.

Although the battle with Yue today had given them quite a blow, it was still worth their while since they were able to perfectly absorb the Dark Glacial Frost with the help of Elder Ye Xuan.

‘I really hope that I can dream of Elder Ye tonight.’

The two girls lay on the bed. When they thought of Ye Xuan’s handsome appearance, they felt butterflies in their stomach.

If Lin Qing knew that her two treasured disciples were having such thoughts, she would definitely hold her head in her hands helplessly and say, “It’s really hard to discipline girls when they’re older.”

On the morning of the third day, when the first wisp of purple air slowly rose in the east.

Ye Xuan took Yue and the others on the Firebird and flew toward Yunnan Province.

As they gradually approached the village in her memory, Yue’s mood also turned gloomy. The joy that she had from her cultivation breakthrough had long disappeared.

Time flew by and, soon, a day had passed.

......

When night fell, Ye Xuan brought them to find a place to rest.

At the same time, Ye Xuan once again honed Yue’s actual combat experience, but this time, he became her sparring partner.

Of course, he suppressed his cultivation to the fifth level of the true essence state.

Even so, Yue could not last more than a few rounds in his hands.

“Ding! As the host has accompanied your disciple through three actual battles, you have helped your disciple obtain substantial actual combat experience. You have received a random 9 times feedback points critical hit. Congratulations, the host has obtained the experience of 27 life-and-death battles!”

When the sparring ended, the system notification rang out in Ye Xuan’s mind.

The next second, he gained the experience of 27 life-and-death battles out of thin air in his mind. He had gained quite a bit of understanding regarding the path of cultivation once again.

“As expected, everything can be improved!” Seeing this, Ye Xuan could not help but smile.

Soon, the second day arrived.

Ye Xuan and the others once again passed through the mountains and forests. At noon, they finally arrived in Yunnan Province!

As long as they passed through the Netherworld Forest, which was not far away, they would be able to reach Yue’s hometown, which was the village filled with her sad memories, Lin Shi village in the east of Yunhei city.

However, the Netherworld Forest was extremely dangerous, and there were fifth-rank demon beasts inside, which were comparable to core formation state cultivators.

Most cultivators did not dare to venture deep into the Netherworld Forest, much less fly above it like Ye Xuan.

However, Ye Xuan only released a bit of his aura. The fifth-rank demon beasts in the Netherworld Forest immediately trembled uncontrollably and crawled on the ground in fear.

The Firebird did not go straight to Lin Shi village. Instead, it landed in the nearby Yunhei city.

In Yue’s memory, she could only vaguely remember the appearances of the bandits. However, she did not know the exact origin of that group, nor did she know where their headquarters were.

Therefore, Ye Xuan planned to ask around for some information in Yunhei city first.

The city lord of Yunhei City had reached the seventh level of the purple spirit state. As soon as he sensed the aura of the Firebird, he was shocked.

The Firebird’s grade was high-level rank four, and its strength was not inferior to his at all. If its owner was able to control such a terrifying demon beast, then the strength of its owner could only be greater.

The city lord of Yunhei city hurriedly went out to welcome them with a smile.

No matter what the other party’s purpose was, he could not afford to offend this big shot, especially if he was some sort of eccentric powerhouse. The slightest dissatisfaction meant that the other party might even destroy this city.

“May I know where you come from? I am Lin Yuan, the city lord of Yunhei city. Greetings, Sir!”

Lin Yuan bowed respectfully in the direction of the Firebird.

“Qingyun sect, Ye Xuan.”

Ye Xuan looked at Lin Yuan and then said calmly. At the same time, the Firebird turned into a stream of light and entered the space between Yue’s eyebrows.

“I didn’t expect it to be Elder Ye Xuan. I have long heard of your illustrious name. Please come to the city lord’s mansion for a visit. I will treat you well!”

Hearing his introduction, Lin Yuan was shocked.

He had been wondering why this expert was so young. It turned out that he was Ye Xuan from the Qingyun sect!

In the entire Great Qian dynasty, there was no one who did not know Ye Xuan’s name.

He did not expect this legendary big shot to turn up at Yunhei City. Why would such a noble existence come to such a remote place?

“I won’t trouble the city lord. I came to Yunhei City just to gather some information!” Ye Xuan said.

“Elder Ye Xuan, please tell me what information you are looking for. I will tell you everything I know,” Lin Yuan said respectfully.

“I want to know the specific information of all the robbers at the border of Yunhei City!” Ye Xuan said.

“Ah?” Seeing this, Lin Yuan’s expression changed. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Why? Is that not possible?” Seeing this, Ye Xuan squinted his eyes.

As the city lord of Yunhei City, it was impossible for Lin Yuan to know nothing about the bandits around Yunhei city.

If the bandits in the city were too rampant and affected the lives of the common people to a great extent, he, as the city lord of Yunhei City, would certainly be punished by the Great Qian dynasty.

Although Ye Xuan’s expression did not change much, Lin Yuan felt an extremely terrifying pressure, and cold sweat ran down his back.

“I do know some information, but it’s basically information from three years ago

“Three years ago, the cultivation practitioners of the Xuanyin sect came to Yunhei city and took over the mission of exterminating the bandits in the city. Therefore, the city lord’s mansion ceased their involvement in the capture and extermination of the bandits after that!” Lin Yuan explained hurriedly.

The Xuanyin sect was the second most powerful sect in the Great Qian dynasty. They had the authority to take over the mission of exterminating the bandits in the city by using the warrant given by the sect.
