914 Endless Killing Aura

“Damn it! I’ll kill everyone here!”

Shan Ling could no longer suppress his anger at this moment. Ever since those three experts arrived from the Heavenly Dao World, everyone had been ignoring his existence.

This was the first time in countless years that he had been treated like this, and it was humiliating. His rage fuelled his power, and his aura strengthened continuously.

After discovering this situation, Li Xuanzhen was shocked as he muttered to himself, “This is bad. That old monster has completely lost control. All of the blood essence in his body has been unleashed in order to increase his combat strength. This kid’s life is probably in danger.”

Hearing these words, Ao Lei and the others became worried for Ye Xuan, but Ou Tian was thrilled.

He could not help but say mockingly, “Haha! This is what happens when you overestimate yourself. You’ll regret it later, or perhaps you won’t. After all, dead people don’t have regrets.”

An angry roar sounded, and huge waves instantly rose on the East Sea. Shan Ling opened his mouth wide in a bloodthirsty manner, and unleashed a terrifying wave of destructive energy, which was channeled into his right hand.

Then, he raised his right hand high, and then swung his palm down, trying to flatten Ye Xuan like an insect. However, Ye Xuan leapt into the air, his entire body emitting bursts of red light. He dodged the blow easily.

“Fiery Phoenix technique!”

Li Xuanzhen exclaimed in disbelief. At this moment, he finally understood why Ye Xuan was so confident.

However, this was just the beginning.

As the battle continued, Shan Ling launched dozens of killing moves in quick succession, yet Ye Xuan easily dodged all of them.

Furious, Shan Ling did not hesitate to summon divine lightning that filled the sky and surrounded Ye Xuan.

“You’re a slippery one, aren’t you? But let’s see how long you can keep dodging!”

The bolts of divine lightning grew more and more intense, and closed in on Ye Xuan, trapping him. Then Shan Ling’s hands continuously performed seals as he condensed a giant ball of energy with a bloodthirsty aura.

The moment it was finished, Shan Ling grabbed the giant red ball and hurled it at Ye Xuan. In an instant, a deafening sound erupted.

Bang!

Seeing the huge formation that trapped Ye Xuan, Yanran was really nervous. However, she did not believe that Ye Xuan would be defeated so easily. After all, he had not used his strongest sword attack.

Just as she was about to go forward to help, she saw a wisp of green light being released from within the red light that filled the sky.

When the light gradually dissipated, a young man in fluttering white clothes was hovering in mid-air without any signs of injury.

Everyone was dumbfounded. How did he do that? Did he somehow dodge that attack as well?

Even Ou Tian was in disbelief and looked at Ye Xuan suspiciously.

Ye Xuan snorted coldly and said, “Hmph! Old monster, is that all you have? If so, then it’s my turn to attack.”

“This…”

Shan Ling’s heart trembled, and a nervous expression appeared on his face. He could not believe what he was seeing. His strongest attack had failed to even injure Ye Xuan!

Looking closely, he saw that Ye Xuan’s body seemed to be surrounded by golden divine runes, and there was also a green light filled with the aura of life around his body. Under the combined effect of the two, his attack had been resisted.

At this moment, Shan Ling. This was the first time he had encountered such a difficult enemy.

Ye Xuan casually swung the Godsword, which instantly released a wisp of blood-red divine light. Then, a killing intent stronger than Shan Ling’s erupted, pushing aside the bloodthirsty aura almost immediately.

This scene shocked everyone.

“This… This can’t be true!”

Shan Ling was the most surprised. He had used the most powerful secret technique of the blood race. How could Ye Xuan defeat his killing move so easily?

The corners of Ye Xuan’s mouth curled up slightly as he said, “Old monster, I’m not going to play with you anymore. Let me show you the true meaning of power!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the Godsword buzzed and instantly released a terrifying killing aura that instantly enveloped the entire East Sea.

This killing aura made everyone feel as if someone was holding the scythe of the Grim Reaper against their necks.

“This… Is this for real?”

At this moment, even the arrogant Ou Tian could not help but reveal a fearful expression.

Then, a blood-red sword beam shot into the sky, condensing into a giant sword, which instantly shook the eight continents, and even the sky was dyed blood-red.

At this moment, the entire world fell silent, and everyone could only watch and stare at Ye Xuan, who now seemed to look like the god of death!

“This sword move…”

Ou Tian was terrified. He could not believe what he was seeing, and all traces of arrogance had disappeared from his eyes.

At this moment, he finally realized that he was the one who had embarrassed himself.L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎
