869 I’ll Give You All An Opportunity!

“As for the competition between disciples, I have already discussed it with the other chiefs, and we agree.”

Hearing Ao Lei’s words, the disciples present were stunned. After all, this was closely related to the honor of the sect. However, this also invigorated them, as they would be representing the sect in battle. They did not want to let the sect and their teachers down.

Elder Qian Yi looked at Ao Lei and the high-spirited disciples behind him. He nodded expressionlessly. Now that things were set in motion, he had to inform the sect as well.

“Alright, I’ll go back and tell the sect master. We also have to make some preparations in advance. Everyone, I’ll take my leave first.”

After saying this, Elder Qian Yi left.

Many disciples felt nervous. When Elder Qian Yi returned to the Heaven continent’s Great Wilderness Divine sect, preparations for the competition would likely start in full swing. Therefore, they had to seize this time to improve themselves, and avoid embarrassing themselves.

Seeing their serious expressions, Ye Xuan could not help but laugh out loud. He was also looking forward to this competition. Although he did not know what kind of preparations the other side would make, Yanran had told him that among the newly recruited disciples of the Great Wilderness God Sect in the Heaven Continent, there were even disciples with greater potential than her.

Since she had said this, it meant that the strength levels of these disciples would be quite high. Perhaps some of them might have already broken through to the supreme realm. Such a situation might be very surprising in the East continent, and could even be called a miracle. However, the Heaven continent was a whole different ball game.

Ye Xuan still remembered Ou Yunhai, who he had met in the ancient tomb. At that time, Ye Xuan had only just broken through to the supreme realm, yet Ou Yunhai was a late-stage supreme realm cultivator. In essence, the cultivation speed of cultivators in the Heaven continent seemed to be markedly faster than cultivators in the East continent, Ye Xuan included.

This was despite Ye Xuan having the help of the system. They relied on their own potential to cultivate to reach their current cultivation level. The world was vast and boundless. As the saying went, there would always be someone better. There were many top geniuses. It was precisely because of this that he had to remember not to be overly confident and arrogant.

Perhaps in a region you don’t know of, there are many geniuses who are far superior to you. Could the Great Wilderness Divine Sect of the East Continent really win this competition? It was probably too early to be happy now. Of course, Ye Xuan would not just watch the sect lose. After all, he was also a member of it.

After the atmosphere gradually became more solemn, Ao Lei looked around and said, “Did you all hear it clearly just now? The Heaven continent’s Great Wilderness Divine sect has already issued a challenge to us. This martial arts competition is about which of us can become the orthodox one. What do you all think about this matter?”

Hearing this, the disciples present stared at each other, not knowing what to say. After a long while, Hua Rufeng finally opened his mouth and said loudly, “We will definitely fight for the honor of the sect! Martial Uncle Ao, you don’t have to worry. We will definitely work hard. Even if we have to risk our lives, we will win this competition!”

After hearing Hua Rufeng’s words, the atmosphere suddenly became much more heated. Everyone spoke up at the same time.

“Senior Brother Hua is right. No matter how powerful the Great Wilderness Divine sect of the Heaven continent is, we will definitely win.”

“Not long ago, Martial Uncle Ye killed Mengyu. Although we can’t reach Martial Uncle Ye’s level, we must have the same determination. No matter how strong the other party is, we must fight with confidence!”

At this moment, the confidence of the disciples soared once again. Looking at this scene, Ye Xuan also felt very happy and nodded his head. It was vital that they had fighting spirit going into the competition.

“Very well! Keep up this fighting spirit. If you are already afraid before the competition even starts, then you will definitely lose.”

“I’m very happy to see you all so confident, so today, I’ll give you all an opportunity!”

After saying that, Ye Xuan casually waved his hand and instantly released a terrifying amount of power. Within moments, the sky above Cloud Sky peak began to churn, and the power condensed into a huge tornado.

“Good heavens!”

Seeing this situation, everyone’s expressions immediately changed drastically. Gao Shun was also looking at this scene in a daze. However, after seeing the power that the tornado was exuding, he was shocked beyond belief and stood rooted to the ground.

What was Ye Xuan trying to do? Were the laws of the world bending to his will? How did he create such immense power from a wave of his hand?

“Junior Brother Ye… You…” Ao Lei muttered in a trembling voice.

If this power was absorbed by the sect’s disciples, would their cultivation levels not improve rapidly? Those disciples with great potential could even advance several realms. Who could resist such temptation? The disciples of the Great Wilderness Divine sect all stared at the huge tornado in the sky as they sighed with emotion.

“Heavens, has Martial Uncle Ye already reached such a terrifying level?”

“This is truly unimaginable…”𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m
