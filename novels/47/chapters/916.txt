917 The Ancient Palace Opens

“Senior Brother Li, you’re really praising me too much. I didn’t do anything special. Besides, how would the weak little me dare to show off in front of Senior Brother Ou?”

Ou Tian’s face darkened when he heard this. His eyes seemed to be burning with a raging fire. This fellow was taking every opportunity to mock him.

Unacceptable!

Ou Tian angrily flung his sleeves and said coldly, “Ye Xuan, you’re really a piece of work. Although you have some strength, it’s just that!”

“Once you arrive in the Heavenly Dao World, you will just be another ant. I advise you not to be so arrogant. After all, there are so many geniuses who are stronger than you!”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan instantly laughed and said, “That’s true. You’re right, but in my opinion, these words should be describing yourself.”

“Damn it!”

At this moment, the atmosphere turned tense once again. Sensing that a battle might begin, Li Xuanzhen immediately stepped forward to mediate.

Yanran could not help but cover her mouth and smile.

‘Ye Xuan is really too black-bellied, but it doesn’t matter.’

Ye Xuan was clearly trying to piss off Ou Tian, but that was due to how arrogant the latter had been earlier. From her perspective, Ou Tian had been asking for it.

In the end, unwilling to continue this conversation any longer, Ou Tian said angrily, “Don’t be too arrogant. Now that you’ve provoked Shan Ling, do you think you can still reach the Heavenly Dao World safely?”

“This old monster is famous for being vengeful. I don’t think you’ll even live to see the day where I meet you again.”

After saying this, Ou Tian turned around and left. After all, he knew that he would only continue to be humiliated if he stayed.

Seeing him leave, Li Xuanzhen looked at Ye Xuan worriedly. After some thought, he said, “Junior Brother Ye, don’t worry too much about this. I’ll inform the elder about this when I return to the sect.”

“When he finds out about you, he will definitely make preparations for your arrival. With him present, Shan Ling will definitely not be able to hurt you.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Li Xuanzhen briefly glanced at Ao Lei, seemingly trying to confirm something.

Ye Xuan simply nodded in acknowledgement.

After doing all this, Li Xuanzhen brought Nanfeng with him back to the Heavenly Dao World, and things calmed down for a while.

…

Suddenly, a huge roar was heard from the depths of the East Sea, instantly stirring up monstrously large waves.

“What’s going on?”

Everyone was shocked, and when they turned to look around, they saw the ancient palace releasing bursts of golden light that shot up into the sky.

“The ancient palace has opened!”

“This…”

“Whoa!”

Within the golden light they were seemingly able to see scenes of immortals fighting each other, and the entire region was in chaos.

The Heavenly Stairway would soon open. Many people had waited for countless years for this moment, so this was an opportunity to get stronger and prepare themselves for it.

“A once-in-a-lifetime opportunity has come. Let’s hurry up and enter!”

Someone shouted, and the crowd rushed toward the ancient palace without hesitation. However, unexpectedly, the ancient palace released another wave of golden light, expelling everyone.

Boom!

Gao Shun, who was the fastest, was sent flying and slammed into the side of a tall mountain, creating a crater from the impact.

Seeing this scene, Ye Xuan laughed out loud.

“Hehehe, Senior Brother Gao, your style is quite unique.”

Looking closely, he saw that Gao Shun’s head had a large bump on it from the collision, which made him look rather comical. This was why Ye Xuan had been unable to hold it in.

After hearing him laugh, everyone else chimed in. Among them, Hua Rufeng laughed the loudest. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Gao Shun was from the older generation while Hua Rufeng was from the younger generation, so by right he should not have laughed out loud. However, after hearing Ye Xuan laugh, he could not hold it in at all.

He burst into laughter and almost rolled on the ground.

Even Zhuge Yueyue, who had always been cold and expressionless, tried her best to hold back her laughter.

She could not be blamed for this. After all, Gao Shun’s current appearance was really too comical. Heck, even Ao Lei laughed. This eased the heavy atmosphere.

He said, “Junior Brother Gao, it’s counterproductive to be so anxious for success.”

“You’re already a century old. Why are you still so careless when doing things? Can’t you learn from me and be more mature?”

This made Gao Shun gnash his teeth in anger. He was already in this state, yet everyone was mocking him. It was really too much.

Right at this moment, another explosion suddenly sounded, and the ancient palace shook violently.

Moments later, the door of the ancient palace slowly opened, and two golden words appeared on it.

“Immortals enter?”

Looking at these words, Ye Xuan frowned. What kind of trick was this?

While he was feeling extremely confused, some people could no longer wait. When they saw that the door had already opened, they rushed in recklessly.

This time, they did not encounter any obstacles and successfully entered the ancient palace.

Ye Xuan observed for a moment, and only heaved a sigh of relief after realizing that there was no danger.

“Teacher, Teacher’s wife!”

At this moment, Zhuge Yueyue shouted. She had been observing the opponents that she needed to pay attention to, so when she saw that they had all moved out, she felt a little nervous, not wanting to fall behind.
