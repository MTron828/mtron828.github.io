717 The Kiss

When had she fallen for him?

Thank you readers!

Yuelun thought about it for a long time, but could not really figure out when it had started.

Ye Xuan, this brat, had been pretending to be weak, but then suddenly displayed dazzling abilities that left everyone stunned.

Every time he faced a crisis, he could easily resolve it, and the way he resolved it was always so shocking. After he revealed his strength, the rest of the chiefs of the other peaks started to finally get to know him better.

Perhaps it was during this period that she started to slowly fall in love with Ye Xuan. It was difficult to say how these feelings came about, but she had gradually become aware of them during her interactions with Ye Xuan.

Thus, when she heard his confession, she immediately accepted it and reciprocated in kind. After all, she knew that a second chance to do so might not come by if she let it pass.

Seeing her finally accept his overtures, he smiled and rubbed her head, then placed the pill in her hand.

“Senior Sister, since we’re now in a relationship, you should be able to accept this medicinal pill openly, right?”

Yuelun’s heart trembled.

Should she accept it or not?

After pondering for a moment, Yuelun accepted the pill.

From this moment on, the two of them had truly become a couple, which filled her with joy.

However, now what?

She did not know what to do next.

Furthermore, she was the chief of Water Sky peak, and had more than a hundred disciples under her.

She could not just abandon her responsibilities and move in with Ye Xuan at Cloud Sky peak, right?

That would be rather unreasonable. However, when she recalled the various things that the two of them had experienced before, her face instantly turned red. Therefore, she could not stop herself from quietly approaching Ye Xuan.

Then…

After kissing him lightly, she turned around and instantly slipped away.

“Ah! She actually did this? Is this considered a sneak attack?” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Ye Xuan was still in a happy mood after receiving the system’s confirmation, so he had not been prepared for it. His mind was in a daze.

After seeing Ye Xuan’s silly expression, Yuelun could not help but burst out laughing.

“Junior Brother Ye, we’ve arrived at Water Sky peak. I’ll bring my disciples back first. Let’s meet again when we have time.”

Time passed quietly in the process of laughing and joking, and they had already reached the sect’s territory.

At this moment, Ye Xuan hurriedly shouted, “”Senior Sister, please wait a moment.”

Yuelun was thinking of entering seclusion in order to break through and reach the supreme realm. However, after hearing Ye Xuan’s cry, she immediately turned around to ask what was going on.

When she turned around, she realized that Ye Xuan was pouncing on her like a wolf. Her face turned pale from fright and she felt like a deer in headlights.

She felt a pair of warm arms pulling her into a warm embrace.

Before she could struggle, she realized that her lips were locked with Ye Xuan’s.

Yuelun could not believe it. In front of so many people, Ye Xuan actually dared to kiss her so openly.

“Heavens! First Sister, hurry up and look at Teacher. What are Teacher and Martial Aunt Yuelun doing?” Xiang Yun exclaimed loudly when she noticed what was going on.

Was her teacher and Chief Yuelun playing some sort of new game? Why were their mouths touching? Could it be that they were feeding each other?

When Zhuge Yueyue saw this scene, she was also dumbfounded. She immediately covered Xiang Yun’s eyes.

“Cough cough, Third Sister, be good. Children shouldn’t ask too much about adult matters. You can’t watch this scene…”

Zhuge Yueyue could only say this patiently as she covered Xiang Yun’s eyes with her palm. However, Xiang Yun could still see what was going on through the gaps between her fingers and said with a straight face, “Teacher must have hidden some delicious food, but he didn’t share it with us. He only wanted to share it with Chief Yuelun, so he had to secretly feed her mouth to mouth. No, I have to see what it is.”

After hearing Xiang Yun’s words, Feng Xiyun could no longer hold it in and burst out laughing.

“Alright, alright. It’s just like you said, Teacher must have tasted some delicious food himself.”

Feng Xiyun originally wanted to tease this little girl, but when she noticed Zhuge Yueyue’s embarrassed expression, she did not continue. Perhaps her joke was really a little much at this juncture.

At this moment, the disciples from Water Sky peak also caught up. When they saw what was going on, they were all stunned.

“Oh my god, Teacher and Martial Uncle Ye’s relationship has already progressed to this level? He has already kissed her?”

“I have to share the news!”

“Hehe, I didn’t expect Martial Uncle Ye to be so daring. He kissed Teacher in public and didn’t even blush.”

Seeing the crowd of disciples, Zhuge Yueyue’s ears turned red.

“Oh, this is so embarrassing…”

After struggling free, Yuelun could clearly hear her heart thumping wildly. Her cold and aloof image had been destroyed in one fell swoop. He actually kissed her in public…
