407 Young Master Su, Someone Is Scolding You

Zhuge Yueyue looked at Su Changhe, who had a guilty look on his face. She felt like laughing and teasing him.

“Since Young Master Su is not hiding from us, why not come up and have a seat?”

“I’m just a mortal, so how can I sit with you fairies?”

“Besides, this isn’t very appropriate.”

Su Changhe looked around guiltily, trying to see if Ye Xuan was nearby.

However, no matter what the result was, he would never dare to have any ideas about Zhuge Yueyue.

At this moment, Elder Chen suggested, “Young Master, I think we can agree to her suggestion.”

“After all, she is Chief Ye Xuan’s disciple. If we can become friends with her, we might be able to ease our relationship with Chief Ye Xuan.”

“That makes sense!”

Su Changhe thought about it carefully and agreed with Elder Chen.

“Cough, cough! However, since you’re willing to share a seat with me, I won’t be unreasonable!”

Su Changhe calmed down, and his face regained its gentle and elegant smile.

However, he did not know that on the other side of the top floor, there were a few sneaky cultivators watching them.

One of them, a burly man, said in a deep voice, “Hurry up and report this to the young master. These beauties are related to Su Changhe!”

After entering the private room, Su Changhe bowed very politely like a scholar.

“I’m Su Changhe. Greetings.”

Seeing this, Feng Xiyun could not help but cover her mouth and laugh.

This guy knew his etiquette, but his movements were a little stiff. It was obvious that he did not practice very often.

“I didn’t expect Young Master Su to be so well-mannered.”

Su Changhe felt happy when he heard this, but did not show it on his face.

“You flatter me. I’m just a mortal, how can I be compared to you fairy maidens!”

“I wonder how I should address the two fairies beside me?”

Su Changhe’s gaze fell on Feng Xiyun and Xin’er as he asked curiously.

He knew Zhuge Yueyue, as she was Ye Xuan’s disciple. However, he had no impression of Feng Xiyun and Xin’er.

“She’s my Junior Sister, Feng Xiyun,” Zhuge Yueyue said.

I didn’t expect fairy to be Chief Ye Xuan’s disciple as well. It’s truly a pleasure.”

Once Su Changhe discovered Feng Xiyun’s identity, he immediately squeezed out a smile.

However, he was more envious in his heart. He had not expected Ye Xuan to take in yet another beautiful disciple. When did he have no such luck with the ladies?

“By the way, why do I only see you three fairies here? Is Chief Ye Xuan around?” Su Changhe asked nervously.

Zhuge Yueyue stifled a laugh as she spoke. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Don’t worry, Teacher isn’t here!”

“That’s such a pity.”

Su Changhe heaved a sigh of relief when he heard that.

‘Oh my God, I was almost scared to death. Fortunately, that fiend was not here!’

The confidence on Su Changhe’s face returned immediately. He spoke with fervor and elegance.

At this moment, in another private room on the top floor of the restaurant.

Lin Dong’s expression was depressed as he drank alone. The figures of Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun kept appearing in his mind.

At this moment, a subordinate ran in and reported in a hurry.

“Young Master, we’ve obtained some information! They seem to know the Su family’s eldest young master!”

“Su Changhe is currently in the private room with those women!”

“What?” When Lin Dong heard this, he immediately flew into a rage.

“Su Changhe, that trash, is not worthy!”

Lin Dong’s eyes were filled with rage. He had always looked down on Su Changhe, that good-for-nothing who only knew how to eat, drink, whine, and gamble.

If Su Changhe’s father had not been a heaven realm expert, he would have beaten Su Changhe up a long time ago.

He did not expect that Feng Xiyun and the others would reject his outstanding self and turn around to get together with that trash, Su Changhe.

Lin Dong could no longer endure it.

“Bah! They’re just a bunch of b*tches. I thought they were people of noble status, but they dared to refuse me to mingle with that trash!”

“Hmph! Follow me!”

“No matter what, I have to vent my anger today! I will let them know who the boss of Qingyang City is!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Lin Dong angrily dashed out of the door and headed towards the private room where Zhuge Yueyue and the rest were seated.

In the private room, Su Changhe was thinking about how to build a good relationship with Zhuge Yueyue and the others, and at the same time, ease his strained relationship with Ye Xuan.

He did not expect that before he could even take action, Lin Dong had already led a group of his underlings and furiously barged in.

“What?” Su Changhe frowned when he saw this.

When he saw that the people who had arrived were Lin Dong and his group of followers, he was puzzled.

‘Was there something wrong with this guy’s brain? I didn’t provoke him during this period of time, so why did he come looking for me?’

Lin Dong furiously glared at Su Changhe, Zhuge Yueyue and the rest as he sneered.

“I thought you were noble people since you rejected me, but I didn’t expect that you’d take a fancy to this kind of trash!”

Hearing this, Feng Xiyun smiled, but did not say anything.

At the side, Zhuge Yueyue’s eyes instantly turned cold. She was about to beat this guy up, but she was stopped by Feng Xiyun.

Feng Xiyun knew that Lin Dong must have thought that they had taken a fancy to Su Changhe. This was why he had angrily rushed over.

These descendants of the major families were all like this. They wanted to compete for superiority in everything they did.

After failing to win their favor, Lin Dong discovered that Su Changhe was actually sharing a private room with them, so he naturally could not take this lying down.

When she thought of this, Feng Xiyun chuckled inwardly.

Interesting!

She immediately looked at Su Changhe, who was beside her, and said as if she was just watching a show.

“Young Master Su, this guy actually called you trash!”

Su Changhe’s mouth twitched when he heard that. He could not help it.

“Lin Dong, a dog like you dares to scold me?”

‘I spent so much effort to improve my impression in front of these beautiful women, but this guy’s one sentence has undone all of my work.’

Who the f*ck could endure this?

At this moment, Elder Chen whispered, “Young Master, it is very likely that Lin Dong’s group is here for the fairies.”

“If we can solve this problem, perhaps it will help our relationship with Chief Ye Xuan!”
