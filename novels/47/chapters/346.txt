It was followed by a cracking sound.

“No!”

At the same time, an incredulous roar was suddenly heard.

When everyone’s vision recovered, the flood dragon that had attacked just now was nowhere to be seen. Only ashes remained, slowly scattering into the surroundings.

“How is this possible? How can her strength be so terrifying?”

The rest of the lightning tribulation realm experts narrowed their eyes in shock.

The flood dragon had not been able to withstand even one strike!

If they had only been slightly surprised by Shangguan Wan’er’s strength earlier, now all that was left in their hearts was fear.

“Human, what cultivation level have you reached?”

The lightning tribulation realm Yaksha expert asked with a serious expression.

Shangguan Wan’er did not have the aura of a lightning tribulation realm expert, or the terrifying pressure of a King realm expert, so how could she have such terrifying strength?

Shangguan Wan’er’s response was another sword strike!

The sound of the sword strike seemed to resonate with the world. The dazzling power of heavenly lightning was fused with the sword qi.

The merman lightning tribulation realm expert died.

“No!”

Before he was swallowed by the sword qi, the merman expert let out an unwilling cry of despair.

Ever since he had broken through to the lightning tribulation realm, he had been cultivating in seclusion in the endless sea. He wanted to survive the tribulations and enter the King realm as soon as possible.

However, not long ago, a Saint King realm expert from the sea race had personally sought him out and promised him that if he fought for the sea race, they would give him a fragment of a holy artifact.

Holy artifact fragments had the ability to shield one against the power of karma, so it was extremely tempting to lightning tribulation realm cultivators.

After all, the reason why lightning tribulation experts did not participate in any conflicts was that they were afraid of accumulating negative karma that would affect the power of the tribulations.

However, he had never expected to die even before he could use the holy artifact fragment.

The fusion of sword intent and heavenly lightning intent utterly annihilated that merman expert.

Buzzzzzz!

At that moment, the space around Shangguan Wan’er was suddenly torn apart, and a bright beam of light burst out, piercing toward Shangguan Wan’er.

It was the Yaksha’s trident!

However, the moment he launched his attack, he immediately turned around and fled frantically into the spatial turbulence.

Unfortunately, he was no match for her in terms of speed, given that she could transform into a lightning bolt.

A bright purple light flashed, and Shangguan Wan’er’s figure reappeared next to the Yaksha, accompanied by another terrifying sword strike.

Another lightning tribulation realm expert died.

Then, she made short work of the rest.

There was deathly silence in the surroundings. Both the humans and the sea race were stunned.

Her majestic figure was deeply engraved into everyone’s minds.

How could this woman’s strength be so terrifying?

Jun Lingtian’s heart was filled with shock when he saw this.

The Divine Gate Holy Land had wanted to recruit her back then, so they naturally knew her strength.

At that time, many elders had guessed that she had most likely hidden her strength, but even so, it should not have reached such an outrageous level, right?

Impossible!

Her current strength was definitely related to Ye Xuan!

A strange light flashed across the depths of Jun Lingtian’s eyes.

‘Ye Xuan is indeed a monster, but isn’t his ability to teach disciples a little too outrageous? How does he do it?’

At the thought of this, Jun Lingtian’s heart was filled with doubt.

The other human experts had similar thoughts.

Many years had passed, and although Ye Xuan had not shown himself, news of him had been spreading throughout the Tianyuan continent!

It had also become known that anyone who became his disciple would definitely have their strength advance by leaps and bounds, to a shocking extent.

The strength that Shangguan Wan’er displayed just now had merely confirmed the information.

Ye Xuan!

The figure of a certain person appeared in everyone’s mind.

Young, monstrous talent, and extremely powerful!

Even the sea race’s King realm experts were helpless against him.

Buzzzzzz!

At this moment, a power that made the world tremble suddenly spread out.

In an instant, a giant spatial crack appeared, and a long golden spear appeared, stabbing toward Shangguan Wan ‘er.

At the same time, someone’s killing intent locked onto Shangguan Wan’er. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Seeing this, Shangguan Wan’er’s expression did not change at all. She did not raise her longsword in her hand, and did not seem to have any intention of blocking.
