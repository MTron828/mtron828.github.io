679 Catching Up (Part 1)

“I’ve asked thousands of young cultivators this question, and I can tell that your answer is genuine and heartfelt. This is truly something I did not expect to hear from someone your age.”

“Zhuge Yueyue, congratulations on passing the heart-questioning stage.”

The old man said this with a smile on his face. Then, his figure gradually disappeared and was replaced by a huge door.

Zhuge Yueyue was currently stunned due to the large amount of fate energy that had entered her body. Also, she did not expect the words she had heard from her teacher back then to be evaluated so favorably.

This had truly benefited her. At the same time, her admiration for Ye Xuan grew. While she was deep in thought, her senses started tingling, and she refocused her attention on her surroundings.

“Attack!” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

At this moment, more than a dozen people from the Supreme Divine sect charged at her. Zhuge Yueyue instantly released a terrifying baleful aura.

She calmly turned around and looked at them, saying coldly, “Are you all in such a hurry to die?”

As soon as she finished speaking, Zhuge Yueyue sent a nearby Supreme Divine sect flying with her sword, instantly eliminating him.

“Instant-kill?”

The group was unable to react at all as they watched this scene in shock.

The person who had been eliminated was a peak-level materialization realm cultivator, but had been eliminated so easily. Seeing this, the charging Supreme Divine sect’s cultivators stopped in their tracks. Some even turned away to run.

However, Zhuge Yueyue had already locked onto them with her aura, and moments later, she unleashed a flurry of sword beams that instantly eliminated them.

“Hehe, Supreme Divine sect? It’s better for you guys to change your name to Trashy sect in the future…”

After dealing with them, she put away the Cloud Sky Sword and stepped into the door that led to the next space.

Daoist Gu Hao, who had witnessed this, felt his face burn from the shame. Every single attempt the Supreme DIvine sect had made against Ye Xuan or his disciples had been in vain. They were soundly defeated and humiliated each time.

At this moment, Zhuge Yueyue’s ranking on the potential list was rising at a rapid speed.

Her score was now 79,000 points, and her ranking had risen to 10th place, pushing Xie Tianyu, who was originally ranked 11th, into 12th place.

“Hehe, Daoist Black Iron, it looks like your disciple has been surpassed. He’s doing well, but not well enough.”

“Tsk, don’t celebrate prematurely, Gao Shun. Anything can happen!””

Daoist Black Iron was already fuming with anger.

Hearing this, Gao Shun immediately retorted, “Alright, let’s wait and see then. However, I advise you to prepare some medicine for yourself first. Otherwise, it’ll be troublesome if you faint from anger.”

“Before you care about others, you should take care of yourself first!”

After saying that, Daoist Black Iron stomped off.

Inside, Zhuge Yueyue had already arrived at the next stage, and to her surprise, saw many familiar faces there.

Mu Beichen, the Reincarnation Fairy, Hua Rufeng…

They were all here.

There were also a few unfamiliar faces that Zhuge Yue Yue could not recognize.

“Oh my, look who’s here,” Xie Tianyu said coldly when he saw another figure appear.

When he saw that it was Zhuge Yue Yue, the smile on his face became even colder.

Noticing Zhuge Yueyue’s arrival, Mu Beichen laughed.

“Haha, things are getting more and more interesting.”

At this moment, Hua Rufeng hurriedly came over and said, “Junior Sister Zhuge, you’ve finally arrived.”

Zhuge Yueyue nodded and said, “Senior Brother Hua, what exactly is going on? Why are so many people still here?”

Hua Rufeng replied. “In this space, 10 people will be selected. Only these 10 people will be qualified to ascend to the summit. That’s why this place is called the Summit Space.”

“There are only 18 people here at the moment, and the space will activate once 2 more join us here.”

“Therefore, we’re all waiting now.”

After hearing this, Zhuge Yue Yue understood what was going on. It seemed that they required 20 people to proceed.

Mu Beichen was still ranked first, the Reincarnation Fairy was ranked second, Xu Changqing was ranked sixth, Xie Tianyu was ranked 12th, and Hua Rufeng was ranked 17th.

They still needed two people…

Who would these two be?
