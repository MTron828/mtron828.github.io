576 Auction (Part 1)

These quality goods should not be sold and wasted like this. It would be much better to give them to his disciples. After all, he could not be by their side all the time, so the stronger and more well-protected they were, the better.

After some serious consideration, Ye Xuan took out a portion of the treasures he had prepared to put up for auction.

Among these treasures, the Yama’s needle was a decent treasure.

There were also some other treasures that Ye Xuan was not bothered to appraise fully. He took them all out and decided to auction them.

By the time Ye Xuan had sorted through all of these things, half a day had passed.

“Teacher, we’re back!”

Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun walked into the room with smiles on their faces.

Ye Xuan did not turn around, but asked, “How was it? Are you happy with what you bought? Did anyone cause you any trouble?”

“We’re very happy. How could anyone possibly come and provoke us? By the way, teacher, what are you doing now?”

Feng Xiyun walked over with great interest and looked at the treasures that Ye Xuan was going to auction off.

Only then did Ye Xuan raise his head to look at Feng Xiyun. He immediately replied, “Actually, I’m not doing anything. I’m just sorting through some treasures.”

“I’ve just found these two sets of flexible armor. These are better than the ones I gave you earlier, so take these instead and try them on.”

After hearing this, the two of them were extremely shocked.

Zhuge Yueyue also hurried over and picked up the ice-attribute flexible armor and examined it carefully.

“Wow… This flexible armor is wonderful!”

Zhuge Yueyue exclaimed in shock.

In the mystic world, armor sets were also extremely valuable, even more so than weapons!

After all, a good set of armor might be the difference between life and death in battle, and might save them in the event of a surprise attack.

Therefore, good sets of armor were prized and the object of desire of countless cultivators.

“Teacher, could it be that you’re planning to sell all of these treasures?”

As she spoke, Zhuge Yueyue took out the ice-attribute flexible armor she had just been given earlier.

Ye Xuan just said indifferently, “Yes, in any case, these treasures aren’t of much use to me. I’ll exchange them for money so that we can buy more herbs for alchemy.”

Hearing this, Zhuge Yueyue understood his intentions. She immediately swapped the old set of armor for the new one.

After packing up all of the treasures, Ye Xuan led his two disciples out of the room.

“Sir!”

Seeing Ye Xuan appear, Han Sikong hurried over and said respectfully, “Sir, I’ve already started ordering the herbs on your list.”

It probably would not take long for him to purchase all of the herbs on the list.

“I’ll send them to Cloud Sky peak personally later.”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan nodded.

Han Sikong was indeed very thorough in his work. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Alright, just send it to me after you’ve bought everything.”

Also, I’ll have to trouble you to help me auction off these treasures that I’ve picked out.”

Ye Xuan then took out a storage bag and handed it to Han Sikong.

Hearing this, Han Sikong was stunned, but also secretly delighted.

He also knew very well how strong Ye Xuan was.

As a supreme realm expert, these treasures should be quite valuable.

If it was possible, he would have bought all of these treasures himself.

“I wish I could buy them all myself, but my financial resources are lacking.”

Han Sikong then continued quickly, “Sir, coincidentally, the Qingyang Restaurant is holding an auction today.”

“Many cultivators have come here to pick out some treasures. The treasures you want to auction off should be able to get a good price today.”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan said, “Then, help me take a look at these treasures first.”

Ye Xuan directly handed the storage bag to Han Sikong, trusting that he would do this task well. In any case, he was not worried that someone would run off with his treasures.

Stealing from a supreme realm expert was an incredibly stupid thing to do.

“Sir, let’s go somewhere else and talk.”

After looking around, Han Sikong felt that it was not convenient to talk here, so he led Ye Xuan and the others to the auction house.

“Sir, this place is where the auction will be held.” Han Sikong explained to Ye Xuan as he pointed at the building in front of them. Then, he took out a few masks and handed them to Ye Xuan and the other two.

“Young master, the auction house safeguards the privacy of every distinguished guest. Therefore, when entering the auction house, guests are required to wear this mask.”

“This is to prevent those with evil intentions from identifying and stealing from the winners of the auction items.”

Ye Xuan nodded in understanding.

However, was it really useful to just wear a mask?

Ye Xuan laughed to himself, but he still put on the mask anyway.

Although he had not personally entered an auction house, he was no stranger to the auction process. After all, he had read countless stories and novels in his previous life.

Under normal circumstances, when the protagonist arrived at the auction house, they would either pick up a great deal by chance, or provoked some other big shot.

However, it was different for him. After all, he was the big shot here. Who would dare to provoke him?

...

Wearing this mask was probably only to protect the safety of others, and it was not of much use to Ye Xuan.

“Xiyun, why is this auction house so strange?”

Following behind Ye Xuan, Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun started to talk in whispers.

Hearing this, Feng Xiyun also started looking around. However, she did not notice anything, so she asked, “Senior Sister Yue, what do you mean?”

Zhuge Yueyue’s gaze was locked on various women that were darting left and right around the auction. She felt that there was no light in their eyes, as if they were robots.

This was why she felt that the situation was very strange. Why did these women look like this?
