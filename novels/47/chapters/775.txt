776 Fallen Sect (Part 2)

The Great Wilderness Divine sect had even announced that they would protect those who came to them, including the commoners. In that case, he believed that they would shelter him and his teacher as well.

However, he was not certain about this. After all, there was a grudge between the two sects. No one would fault them for not protecting their enemies.

Looking at the berserk beasts all over the mountain, Xie Tianyu felt helpless. His teacher, who had been his pillar of support, had already fainted, and now, it was up to him to lead them both to survival.

If he failed, the legacy of the Supreme Divine sect would end with them.

After painstakingly avoiding countless berserk beasts, the pair finally arrived in the vicinity of Qingyang City.

After finding a hidden cave to hide in, Xie Tianyu cried out, “Teacher, please wake up.”

As he spoke, Xie Tianyu shook his teacher’s body a few times. Daoist Black Iron slowly opened his eyes.

After Daoist Black Iron woke up, the first thing that crossed his mind was the Supreme Divine sect that he had painstakingly built up. It was probably already destroyed.

Thinking this, he shed silent tears. He wanted to make the Supreme Divine sect bigger and stronger, but he was restricted by Daoist Gu Hao in every way. No matter what orders he gave, Daoist Gu Hao would interfere and, many times, overrule him. This was also one of the causes of the destruction of the Supreme Divine sect.

The more he thought about it, the angrier he became. Daoist Black Iron spat out blood again and almost fell unconscious again.

Fortunately, Xie Tianyu was there to support him. He said anxiously, “Teacher, you must persist!”

“The sect is already destroyed. If even you perish, then there will truly be no hope or future for the Supreme Divine sect.”

“At the critical moment, Elder Hong sacrificed his life in order to give the two of us a chance to live. We can’t let him die in vain.”

“As long as we are still alive, we can build the sect anew and restore it to its former glory.”

Daoist Black Iron looked at his disciple. Disheartened as he was, he could now see a trace of light for the future.

At the same time, he began to mock himself.

He really did not expect that he would be deceived by his own sect members in the end.

“Hehe… Han Tai, oh Han Tai, you’re too cruel!”

After saying these words, his heart calmed down a little. He looked around and sized up the surrounding environment.

After discovering that there were still many berserk beasts outside, he could not help but frown and say, “Tianyu, just where are we?”

“Outside Qingyang City.”

After hearing this answer, Daoist Black Iron was stunned. How long had he been unconscious? Why was he already outside Qingyang City?

Originally, there were tens of thousands of soldiers guarding Qingyang City, but within two hours of the berserk beast’s invasion, all of them were killed.

Fortunately, the Su family of Qingyang City left Qingyang City in time at the critical moment. They even brought all of the civilians in the city to protect them along the way and went to Sky Mountain’s defensive line. Thankfully, they managed to persist until they reached their destination, ensuring their survival.

Su Tiansheng had been particularly praiseworthy throughout this process, and had not abandoned the citizens of Qingyang City.

It was precisely because of this that the Su family was now held in extremely high regard in the hearts of the people of Qingyang City.

“Why are we here?”

This place was very close to Sky Mountain, and it would not take long to reach it.

“Teacher, while you were unconscious, I kept avoiding the pursuit of the berserk beasts and rushed here.”

“Based on the current situation, I determined that the Great Wilderness Divine sect is our best shot at survival…”

“That’s why I made the decision to come here to hopefully seek refuge with the Great Wilderness Divine sect,” Xie Tianyu said honestly without hiding anything.

Xie Tianyu had been in a state of heightened alert and tension this entire time as he fled with his teacher. Luckily, he was quite lucky. Otherwise, he would have become one of the many corpses that littered the plains, forests and mountains on the way here.

Daoist Black Iron felt extremely uncomfortable. He had never imagined that one day, he would actually seek refuge with his enemy.

However, what Xie Tianyu said was indeed reasonable. Judging from the current situation, the only sect that could save them was the Great Wilderness Divine sect.

“Sigh…”

His heart was filled with endless grief and indignation, and he could almost envision Gao Shun’s mocking gaze once he arrived at Sky Mountain.

He could not accept this at all. Even death would be easier for him to accept. However, for the sake of his disciple and the legacy of the Supreme Divine sect, he had to.

This disciple of his had risked his life to protect them. He had no idea how many dangers he had encountered, but his disciple had not given up hope until now.

As a teacher, how could he give up before his disciple did?

“Forget it, forget it. Let’s go to Sky Mountain now.” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

In the end, this was the only course of action available to them.

Even though he was clearly aware that he would definitely face Gao Shun’s mockery and ridicule, he could only lower his head and accept the inevitable.

At this moment, the flames of war were still raging all over the East continent.

Following the fall of the Supreme Divine sect, several other major powers were destroyed.

Similar to the Supreme Divine sect, the Tianxia Academy had also been among the first to choose to protect themselves and hide, but they were still found and destroyed.

Everyone could not help but wonder if this was intentional. Were the berserk beasts seeking out those who had hidden themselves away first?

After the Tianxia Academy was destroyed, the surviving sect members fled toward the Jade Lake Divine sect.
