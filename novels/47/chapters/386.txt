387 Taking Ye Xuan In As Your Little Brother?

Seeing this, Charlot was immediately a little displeased and spoke in a mocking tone, “Young Master Su is a famous person in the Yangli divine empire. Who was so blind as to bully Young Master Su like this?”

“As long as Young Master Su says the word, I’ll immediately give that guy a good beating!”

When Su Changhe heard this, he looked at Charlot with disdain.

However, before he could speak, two figures suddenly appeared in his field of vision. They were the same figures that had been engraved into the depths of his soul.

Su Changhe could not help but tremble.

“Damn it! Why did I bump into this guy again?”

Elder Lin’s expression changed when he saw this. He quickly told Li Tianhai what had happened.

Seeing this, Li Tianhai took a deep look at Ye Xuan. His spiritual sense swept out, wanting to probe Ye Xuan’s cultivation.

Suddenly, an invisible sword qi rippled out and instantly drowned out Li Tianhai’s spiritual sense, almost severely injuring him.

‘This man is so powerful!’

‘His attainments in Sword Dao are especially terrifying!’

Li Tianhai was dumbfounded.

This man was clearly able to transform his spiritual sense into sword qi.

It looked ordinary on the surface, but if an external force tried to attack, the sword qi would inevitably counterattack automatically.

‘This ape is a descendant of an ancient beast!’

Ye Xuan’s gaze fell on the huge ape.

The chaos heart technique method also recorded information about ancient beasts, including their inheritance, which parts of their bodies were valuable, their strengths and weaknesses, and so on.

The ape below him seemed to have been contaminated by a strange force. Its eyes were full of ruthlessness. It had obviously lost its sense of rationality, which was why it was blindly attacking everything around it.

“I say, Young Master Su, don’t tell me that you’ve been scared witless by this ape beast?”

Suddenly, an enigmatic voice rang out from not far away.

Hearing this, Ye Xuan could not help but look over curiously.

“Ha! It’s actually this guy!”

A handsome young man and two old men suddenly appeared in Ye Xuan’s field of vision. At this moment, the three of them had their backs to him and looked extremely nervous. They clenched their hands and feet and looked like they were about to escape.

Ye Xuan’s lips curved into a smile.

Was this not Young Master Su who loved to be filial to the elders?

“Damn it!”

When Su Changhe saw Ye Xuan looking over, his expression was unsightly.

He wanted nothing more than to burn Charlot alive for attracting Ye Xuan’s attention to him.

‘Great, just great. He couldn’t run now. He had already been discovered by that fiend.’

“Ahem, ahem, I didn’t expect to meet Senior again!”

Since he could not escape, it was best that he just confronted the problem head-on.

Su Changhe took a deep breath and forced a smile onto his face. He looked at Ye Xuan with a fawning expression.

“Isn’t this Young Master Su, who loves to show respect to his elders? It seems that we are fated to meet again.”

Ye Xuan looked at su Changhe with a playful gaze.

“Is there something wrong? Why did it feel like Young Master Su wanted to run away the moment he saw me?”

“How is that possible? Senior’s bearing is extraordinary. Compared to you, I feel insignificant, like grass on the side of the road.”

At this moment, Su Changhe was trying his best to curry favor with Ye Xuan.

As long as he could survive, his dignity mattered not.

Hearing this, Ye Xuan almost laughed, but he still maintained a calm expression.

Su Changhe’s heart skipped a beat when he saw this.

This guy’s strength was so terrifying. Was Li Tianhai capable of defeating him?

He should not have left home today without consulting the zodiac calendar. Why did it feel like everything was just bad luck today?

“Tsk tsk!”

At that moment, Su Changhe suddenly heard a mocking voice.

He did not even need to look to know that it was definitely Charlot.

“I’m really surprised. The eldest young master of the Su family is actually flattering someone like a dog!”

Charlot walked over with an arrogant expression and glanced at Ye Xuan indifferently, his eyes full of arrogance.

After all, the two old men behind him were heaven realm experts, so why should he be afraid of Ye Xuan?

Most importantly, he had never been on good terms with Su Changhe. Now that he finally saw a chance, he wanted to seize this opportunity to suppress Su Changhe.

“Oh? It seems like you’re braver than this filial son!”

Ye Xuan could not help but raise his eyebrows. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Such nonsense! Of course I am!” Charlot said arrogantly.

Su Changhe almost burst out laughing when he saw this.

‘Right, keep it up and anger this guy!’

‘I wanna see you beaten to a pulp!’

At this moment, a bright light flashed by, and a beautiful figure suddenly appeared beside Ye Xuan.

Charlot and Su Changhe could not help but lick their lips at her graceful figure and beautiful face.

‘Damn it! Why does this guy have so many beauties around him? It’s so unfair!”

Su Changhe knew very well that he could not afford to offend this beauty at the moment.

However, if he could goad Charlot into offending Ye Xuan, that would naturally be for the best. If he could bring down the Xia family with him, it would be a tremendous credit to his name.

At this moment, Charlot’s eyes were bloodshot. He stared unwaveringly at Yuelun’s figure. Then, he glanced at Ye Xuan arrogantly.

“Hehe! I thought you had some skills, but I didn’t expect you to be a pretty boy. However, the beauty beside you does look good!”

“I am the eldest young master of the Xia family of the Yangli divine empire, Charlot!”

“If you know what’s good for you, you should quickly offer this beauty to me. If this young master enjoys her service, maybe I will even take you in as a little brother!”

Charlot’s face was filled with confidence.

Although Su Changhe could not afford to offend this guy, it did not mean that he could not.

Moreover, Ye Xuan’s face was extremely unfamiliar, so he must not have come from a major faction. At most, he would just be an ordinary cultivator from a holy land, so what was there to fear?

Besides, there was a great beauty beside him, how could he let this chance slip by?
