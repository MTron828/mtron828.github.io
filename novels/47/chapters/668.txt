669 Ahem, Free Labor

“Besides, you’re already considered the number one expert in the East continent. Who would dare to scheme against your disciple?”

“There’s really no need to kill everyone here.” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Of course, Ye Xuan was aware of this, but he simply wanted to use this opportunity to intimidate people.

Honestly, even if Ye Xuan himself tried to kill Xiang Yun, he would probably die. After all, that power had been prepared by a sealed immortal realm expert.

After hearing Daoist Canghai’s words, Ye Xuan pretended to agree and nodded. He then said with a smile, “That’s right. How would an ordinary person dare to do such a thing…”

“However, there’s one thing I have to say. Xiang Yun is my disciple. I don’t care which expert she was in her previous life. Now, she’s just another one of my disciples.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan swept his cold gaze at the crowd and sneered.

“I’ve already memorized all of your appearances.”

“If my disciple is injured when she goes out exploring, then don’t blame me for being ruthless.”

“I will blame this on all of you. It’s your fault for discovering her secret. Whether you live or die depends on yourself.”

After hearing this, the expressions of everyone present changed drastically.

“F*ck…”

“Don’t tell me he’s going to blame us if she trips over herself?”

“How can you blame us for this?”

Although they were filled with resentment, they did not dare to speak up. That was akin to suicide, really.

The one that really deserved to be blamed was Daoist Gu Hao!

If it was not for this old man, none of this would have happened!

Many people had already begun to take action.

“Hurry up and draw a portrait of that little girl. In the future, hang it in the sect and make sure all of the disciples memorize what she looks like.”

“They are not allowed to provoke her. Also, if she appears in our territory, secretly send experts to protect her. Don’t let her get hurt, or we’ll end up being blamed for it.”

Ye Xuan was usually a man of his word, so everyone took what he said seriously.

Daoist Gu Hao’s expression was also extremely gloomy. He really did not expect Ye Xuan to actually go this far.

Gao Shun muttered to himself, “Damn, this method of doing things is pretty awesome. With just a few words, he’s forced these people to look out for his disciple. No one will want to mess with her, and everyone will try to protect her. Ye Xuan probably won’t even have to lift a finger to keep her safe.”

Once Ye Xaun saw that he had gotten his message across, he smiled and put the Cloud Heaven Sword away.

“Remember what I said today. After all, I, Ye Xuan, have always been a man of my word. Don’t forget, especially you, Daoist Gu Hao.”

Ye Xuan looked at Daoist Gu Hao with a smile, as if he was strongly encouraging him to try something.

After hearing these words, Daoist Gu Hao trembled.

“Hehe, you really know how to joke around.”

“I definitely will never do such a thing. That little girl is really too cute. Who would be so cruel as to hurt her?”

‘Who the f*ck wanted to die?’

‘Even though my mouth is very stubborn, my brain is not lacking in any way.’

“That’s good. From the looks of it, you’re quite smart.”

After saying this with a smile, Ye Xuan put the Godsword away, and the roiling sword intent dissipated.

Everyone at the scene finally felt at ease and heaved a sigh of relief.

After seeing these people relax, Ye Xuan’s heart was basically exploding with pride.

‘Hahaha! It seems that I’m now the big boss of the East continent!’

‘This was brilliantly played, if I do say so myself.’

‘I should give myself a round of applause.’
