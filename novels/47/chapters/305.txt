306 Lightning Divine Palace, Liu Chengtian

Ten years later, Baili Moyan was lucky enough to become a disciple of a super expert, who was from the Lightning Divine Palace, which was a super faction from the Leishen Region, which was not too far from the Miaoling Region.

This super expert was a king realm expert. When this happened, Baili Moyan finally saw the opportunity to take revenge.

However, he knew very well that even with cultivating as a disciple of the Lightning Divine Palace, it was basically impossible for him to defeat Shangguan Wan’er alone.

Thus, in the years he had spent in the Lightning Divine Palace, Baili Moyan had constantly been flattering and brown-nosing his master and his fellow disciples, hoping to one day rely on them to help him take revenge. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Just a few days ago, Baili Moyan finally saw his opportunity and successfully convinced a senior disciple from the Lightning Divine Palace, who was a sixth-level pattern condensation realm expert.

In Baili Moyan’s eyes, this senior disciple was no weaker than Shangguan Wan’er, and would be able to defeat and kill her.

Of course, the reason why his persuasion had worked in the first place was because this senior disciple happened to love “collecting” beauties.

He would take them for himself, and enslave them. Furthermore, if the force or faction backing them up was not particularly strong, he would destroy it as well to break their spirit.

Taking advantage of his “hobby”, Baili Moyan had repeatedly described Shangguan Wan’er’s beauty to him.

After some time, he finally convinced the senior disciple to act, and they journeyed to the Miaoling Region.

“Bali Moyan, I didn’t expect the region you were born in to have such a good place!”

A hundred miles away from the Luo Heaven Palace, two people stood with their hands behind their backs.

These two people were naturally Baili Moyan and that senior disciple, whose name was Liu Chengtian.

“Tsk, tsk, tsk. The Luo Heaven Palace is full of female cultivators. It’s really amazing!”

“Junior Brother Baili, I’m becoming more and more curious about this Shangguan Wan’er you mentioned.”

Liu Chengtian’s gaze was focused in the direction of the Luo Heaven Palace. A greedy and lascivious expression flashed across his face, and could not help but lick his lips in anticipation.

“I’ll pick a few beauties with good figures first, and then I’ll take Shangguan Wan’er down.”

“Of course, Junior Brother Baili, I will also help you exact revenge!”

“If Junior Brother wants to try the taste of these beauties, it will naturally be your turn after I choose the ones I like.”

Liu Chengtian laughed out loud. When he thought about how he was about to enjoy himself with those beauties, the corners of his mouth curled up slightly.

“In that case, I have to thank Senior Brother Liu!”

Baili Moyan was overjoyed to hear this.

Liu Chengtian would use a secret technique to forcefully control the souls of those beauties after he obtained them. He would then turn them into slaves and enjoy them to his heart’s content.

To Baili Moyan, this was undoubtedly the greatest revenge against Shangguan Wan’er.

Of course, the Luo Heaven Palace had to be destroyed, but Baili Moyan naturally would not miss out on the chance to ravage those female cultivators.

Buzzzzzz!

Liu Chengtian waved his sleeves and suddenly appeared above the Luo Heaven Palace with Baili Moyan.

“Eh? The formation here is quite profound. I didn’t expect Shangguan Wan’er to be a formation master!”

Liu Chengtian examined the surroundings for a while and suddenly discovered a powerful formation hidden in the Luo Heaven Palace.

It was a fifth-grade formation. If one was not a pattern condensation realm expert, they definitely would not be able to set up such a powerful formation.

“This beauty is getting more and more interesting!”

Immediately, Liu Chengtian’s lips curled up, and he became even more curious about Shangguan Wan’er.

Moments later, Liu Chengtian slowly extended his right hand.

Boom!

A giant black hand that was imbued with martial intent suddenly covered the entire Luo Heaven Palace.

“Not good! It’s an enemy attack!”

Soon, the elders of the Luo Heaven Palace noticed what was happening to the formation and instructed everyone to stay vigilant and prepare themselves.

Although the Luo Heaven Palace’s formation was powerful, the giant black hand contained immense power, and repeatedly bombarded the formation.

As the two forces collided with each other, the impact created energy fluctuations that made the Luo Heaven Palace cultivators tremble.

Buzzzzzz!

Just as everyone was feeling nervous, dazzling sword qi shot up into the sky and destroyed the giant black hand.

At the same time, Shangguan Wan’er’s figure suddenly appeared in the sky above.

“It’s the palace master!”

“The palace master is finally back!”

When the elders saw Shangguan Wan’er, they were overjoyed.

Although Shangguan Wan’er had already returned to the Luo Heaven Palace some time ago, she had not revealed her presence to anyone.

“Tsk tsk tsk! She is indeed a devastatingly beautiful woman!”

“Junior Brother Baili, it seems like you were not lying. I’m very satisfied!”

“After I properly enjoy this beauty, I will take good care of you in the future.”

“Hahaha!”

When he saw Shangguan Wan’er’s beautiful face, an obscene grin appeared on his face.

This was the most extraordinary woman he had ever laid eyes upon.

“Thank you, Senior Brother!”

Baili Moyan was overjoyed to hear this.

Liu Chengtian was doted on by his teacher, and he was extremely strong. There was no doubt in Baili Moyan’s mind that this senior brother of his would become a world-shaking expert in the future.

The benefits of having a good relationship with such a person were self-evident.

However, from the beginning to the end, Shangguan Wan’er did not look at either Baili Moyan or Liu Chengtian in the eye.

She slowly raised her hand, and pulled out the waterfall sword.

This was the treasure that her teacher had given her, and it was also the most powerful weapon she had.

“Shangguan Wan’er, you may not recognize me, but I, Baili Moyan, have never forgotten you!”

“Were it not for you, the Black Flames Temple would never have been destroyed, and my father and brother would still be alive!”

“After thirty years, I’ve returned to collect my debt!”

“My Senior Brother is invincible under the lightning tribulation realm!”

“Today, no one from your Luo Heaven Palace will be able to escape death!”

Seeing that Shangguan Wan’er was ignoring him, Baili Moyan was enraged, and he roared hysterically.
