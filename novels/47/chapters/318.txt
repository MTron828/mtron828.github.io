319 Myriad Spirit Formation

Although Bai Long’s death was unfortunate, it had been his own fault. Moreover, comparing the two, Ye Xuan’s value and potential was undoubtedly higher.

Ye Xuan nodded and did not say anything. Then, his figure disappeared.

Even from such a close distance, Jun Moyu and the others did not notice Ye Xuan’s departure at all. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“You’re really muddleheaded. You almost made a big mistake!”

!!

After Ye Xuan left, Jun Moyu looked at Jun Feitian unhappily.

“I know. It’s my fault for not seeing the bigger picture,” Jun Feitian sighed.

He had felt that losing Bai Long would have been a great loss to the human race.

“Thankfully the ancestor was wise enough to recognize Ye Xuan’s potential and strength.”

“Still, I wonder how strong he really is. His spatial intent has at least reached the fourth level.”

“This will cause a sensation if the news gets out.”

Even among the strongest King realm experts that Jun Moyu knew, the number of them that possessed supreme intent could be counted on one’s fingers. Moreover, most of them only comprehended their supreme intents after the pattern condensation realm, which meant that they could no longer engrave profound patterns based on those supreme intents into their bodies.

Therefore, Ye Xuan’s spatial intent was shocking!

The question was whether he had comprehended it during or after the pattern condensation realm, and what level it truly was.

Was it possible that it had reached the sixth level? They had no idea, but the mere possibility of Ye Xuan having engraved a profound pattern derived from a supreme intent was enough to send chills down their spines.

“Let’s go! The war is still ongoing, and we can’t afford to relax.”

Jun Moyu briefly glanced at the Tower of Heaven that was still floating in the spatial turbulence, and then he and Jun Feitian turned into streaks of light and disappeared.

As for whether Ye Xuan had returned to the Tower of Heaven, or traveled elsewhere, they were uncertain.

Currently, in the spatial turbulence within the Huangyu Zone, the fight between King realm experts was ongoing. Other than those King realm cultivation maniacs who were ignoring the situation, every other King realm expert had been mobilized and was fighting.

The two sides had been in a stalemate for several years, and it would require additional reinforcements, or a sudden change in the situation, if either side wanted to emerge victorious.

At this moment, in the spatial turbulence a hundred thousand miles away from the Tower of Heaven.

Five human King realm experts and five sea race King realm experts were engaged in a fierce battle. This time, all five sea race experts were Yakshas.

The spatial turbulence was filled with violent destructive energy as the two sides clashed. Various attacks imbued with all kinds of martial intents flew between the two sides.

The energy fluctuations from this battle were enough to tear apart a lightning tribulation realm cultivator.

The sea race King realm experts had all comprehended water intent, as well as other martial intents related to water intent. Their attacks were endless like the sea, and they were mighty!

As for the five human King realm experts, two of them were from the Sky Feather Holy Land, two were from the Jade Cloud Temple, and the last was from the Tiansha Temple!

All five of them were middle-stage Human King realm experts. On the other hand, of the sea race experts, four were at the middle stage of the Human King realm, and one was at the early stage of the Human King realm.

Although the human side should have been able to suppress them, they had developed a formation technique that augmented their strength, which instead put the human side at a disadvantage, though not to the point of losing their lives.

The sea race King realm experts continued to press the humans using the power of their formation technique, looking for an incisive opportunity to tip the scales in their favor. If any of these humans revealed a flaw, they would press in for the kill.

“You humans are quite tenacious. You’ve actually managed to last this long against the myriad spirit formation that our sea race developed!”

The trident in the hands of a Yaksha King realm expert blossomed with a dazzling light, and his vast water intent swept out from behind him. The water intent infused itself into the waves around him and condensed into a huge water dragon. It whizzed toward a mid-stage Human King realm expert from the Sky Feather Holy Land.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Wherever the water dragon passed, huge crashing waves followed in its wake, threatening to drown out even the tallest tower, much less this mid-stage Human King realm expert.
