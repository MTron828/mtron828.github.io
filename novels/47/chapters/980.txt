Chapter 981 - 981 Joining Hands To Fight The Enemy

Unexpectedly, this little monkey was actually so pure and innocent. He would definitely repay anyone who helped him.

Even though the pill was valuable, he did not even blink and simply gave it away.

“First Sister, you should take it. After all, this is a critical moment and there’s no time to delay.”

“Besides, your body has already been invaded by its killing intent. If you don’t bring it under control quickly, your life will be in danger.”

Feng Xingyun was also extremely talented in alchemy, and had some knowledge in medicine, so she immediately figured out Zhuge Yueyue’s current condition.

Fortunately, the reason why the little furry monkey had chosen to give her this pill was that it had a great effect on eliminating the killing intent in her body. It could save her.

“Fairy, quickly consume this pill. I’ll protect you so you can refine it safely.”

After hearing this, Zhuge Yueyue did not think too much about it and immediately consumed the pill.

Seconds later, she felt a terrifying amount of energy surge into her body, instantly eliminating the invading killing intent. Furthermore, the pill’s medicinal effects helped her stabilize and improve her physique.

The atmosphere at the scene became even more tense while this was happening. The demon king was still constantly observing the descendants with powerful bloodlines.

These fellows felt extremely uncomfortable at this moment, and they were all on tenterhooks.

However, the situation had already developed to this point. No matter how they tried, they could not escape.

Thus, the golden tiger was the first to stand up and say, “All of us have a common enemy now. Why don’t we put aside our differences for now and fight this enemy together?”

After hearing this suggestion, many of them expressed their agreement. It was obvious that they were all in this together, and no one wanted to be eaten by that terrifying demon king.

If they did not stick together now, they would all die, and no one would be able to escape.

The only chance at survival was to work together and beat this demon king. Although the chances of their success were not high, it was better than being devoured here.

“Alright!”

“Let’s join forces and kill the demon.”Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

After hearing these words, everyone’s blood began to boil. They were all young people, so how could they be afraid of a battle?

Just as everyone was thinking about fighting against the enemy together, the old man from the Immortal Divine sect suddenly attacked and made a hole in the demon’s domain. Then, he carried Gongsun Zhi with him and fled.

When people noticed this, they immediately wanted to escape through the hole, but the hole instantly recovered.

“Damn it!”

“That old man is also a coward. He only knows how to pick on the weak and bully us juniors.”

The old man’s actions were ridiculed by all the disciples present. The reputation of the Immortal Palace also suffered serious damage.

At this critical moment, everyone was concerned about themselves. After all, no one knew what this terrifying demon king would do later.

The atmosphere at the scene became even more tense, and it was so quiet that one could even hear a pin drop. They all stared at the demon king in the sky, afraid that it would attack the very next moment.

Then, the demon king in the forbidden area suddenly clapped its hands.

“Good, very good!”

“With so many noble bloodlines present, there will definitely be some with immortal bones and precious heavenly treasures.”

“Hehehe, it’s a buffet beyond my wildest expectations. You are going to become seeds to nourish a brand new era. One where I will reign supreme!”

The smile on the demon king’s face became even more bloodthirsty. It looked up at the sky and instantly released its monstrous killing intent.

This sudden change in the situation caused all of the cultivators present to turn pale. Were they all going to die here?

“I’ve been sleeping in this endless abyss for tens of thousands of years. I don’t even remember what blood tastes like.”

“My children, come out, show these people the power of our Dark Clan!”

After he finished speaking, a dense cloud of strange monsters suddenly emerged from his body. Each of these monsters had a mouth full of fangs, and desperately rushed towards the crowd.
A great battle was about to break out.

Seeing this, the expressions of many disciples changed drastically. They did not dare to let their guard down and began to activate their trump cards.

As the densely-packed creatures were charging over, the little monkey bravely stood in front of Zhuge Yueyue and wiped out all of the enemies with his Jingu Staff.

“All of you, get lost!”

At this moment, the little furry monkey’s fighting spirit had been ignited. He had to protect Zhuge Yueyue who was behind him, and Feng Xiyun, who was helping Zhuge Yueyue recover.

His originally small body instantly swelled up, transforming into a huge and imposing monkey king. He stretched out his hands and continuously beat his chest.

Augmented by the Jingu Staff, the little monkey had become an invincible god of war. None of these strange monsters could withstand a single strike from him.

“Hehehe.”

An extremely cold voice suddenly rang out. Then, an extremely ugly monster covered in red hair emerged.

Judging from its appearance, one could immediately tell that this monster was a terrifying enemy, and was far more powerful than the monsters they had faced so far.

“Move aside. Let me taste how delicious a monkey nurtured by the heavens is. Hehehe…”

As soon as he finished speaking, the Dark Clan’s commander approached the little monkey. With a wave of his hand, a long saber appeared.

Without saying another word, he immediately activated his killer move and attacked the little monkey, the long saber condensing into a divine dragon.

Violent power surged out, and a great battle instantly erupted…
