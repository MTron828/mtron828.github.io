688 Defeat!

Despite this, he still managed to stand up.

His eyes were about to pop out as he roared hysterically, “I will never fall. You must die!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he launched another attack. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

However, the outcome remained the same.

!!

This time, Zhuge Yueyue mercilessly stabbed the Cloud Sky Sword through his heart.

“Puchi!”

Xie Tianyu collapsed to the ground, and moments later, his body disappeared from the ancient realm and reappeared outside.

“Tianyu!”

Daoist Black Iron immediately rushed over to support the injured Xie Tianyu, his expression filled with worry.

“Teacher, I’m sorry. I still failed”

At this moment, Xie Tianyu’s arrogance had completely disappeared. He had no choice but to accept his defeat.

Daoist Black Iron did not know what to say at this time. After being defeated by the same person twice in a row, his confidence had suffered a huge blow, and the light in his eyes had disappeared.

“Tianyu, it doesn’t matter. Victory and defeat are common in a battle. We will definitely be able to get back at them in the future.”

“You have to regain your confidence. Don’t let this keep you down.”

Daoist Black Iron comforted him. He was not as selfish as Daoist Gu Hao. After all, Xie Tianyu was his most talented disciple, and he treated him like his own child.

“I really didn’t stand a chance,” Xie Tianyu said bitterly. After today’s battle, he knew that the gap between him and Zhuge Yueyue would only get wider.

At this moment, the final battle between the Great Wilderness Divine sect and the Supreme Divine sect ended with Xie Tianyu’s defeat.

“Sigh, I thought that you people from the Supreme Divine sect were very powerful, but that’s all you’ve got?”

“Stop wasting your time here. Next time, bring more people to the fight. Perhaps you’ll be able to make up for your weakness with numbers.”

Gao Shun added fuel to the fire by saying these words. However, his words inadvertently ignited Xie Tianyu’s fighting spirit at this moment.

When he saw his teacher’s sullen expression, he felt very vexed. At the very least, he had to get stronger and make his teacher proud.

Even though he had lost this time, there was still a lot of time in the future. If he did not give up, he would one day obtain the results he wanted.

“B*stard”

Daoist Gu Hao’s expression was extremely unsightly. The Supreme Divine sect had been utterly humiliated in this year’s Divine Seal peak’s gathering.

He no longer wanted to stay here and be made a laughingstock of, so he snorted angrily and turned to leave.

“Hehe, Daoist Gu Hao, take care. At your age, it wouldn’t be good if you fell.”

Gao Shun did not forget to give Daoist Gu Hao a parting shot.

“Hehe, Martial Uncle Gao really is going for it today.”

“That’s for sure. Previously, he suffered at the hands of Martial Uncle Ye like this, so he’s probably enjoying the fact that he gets to mess with someone else now.”

Despite hearing these words, Gao Shun was not bothered. After all, he no longer harbored any animosity toward Ye Xuan.

‘Haha, this girl really has made the sect proud. I don’t regret stepping to save her and Xiyun back then,’ he thought to himself.

After seeing Daoist Gu Hao left, the disciples of the Supreme Divine sect were at a loss, and looked toward Daoist Black Iron for guidance.

However, everyone noticed that Daoist Black Iron was looking at Daoist Gu Hao’s retreating figure coldly.

“Teacher, what exactly is going on with Grandmaster?” Xie Tianyu asked in confusion.

Daoist Black Iron turned around and looked at Xie Tianyu. He wanted to explain the truth, but in the end merely sighed.
