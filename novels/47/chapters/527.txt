528 Ouyang Xiu

If he could get closer to Ye Xuan and get his assistance, then his victory would be assured.

Over the past few days, Ouyang Xiu had been locked in combat with Yanran, but until now, no victor had been determined.

“I’m from the Immortal Divine sect in the South continent. My name is Ouyang Xiu. Which faction does Junior Brother hail from?”

After hearing this, Ye Xuan was very surprised. He even wondered if he had heard wrong.

!!

‘The Immortal Divine sect?’

They also existed in the South continent?

Ye Xuan quickly asked, “Is there any connection between your South continent’s Immortal Divine sect and my East continent’s Immortal Divine sect?”

Upon hearing this, Ouyang Xiu immediately became excited.

Hearing that Ye Xuan actually knew the Immortal Divine sect, he thought that things would be easier. If they were from the same sect, then he could just ask him for help straight up later.

Thinking this, Ouyang Xiu was even happier and immediately said.

“There is definitely a connection. Before the mystic world was divided into eight parts, we all came from the same faction.”

“Even the secret techniques and divine powers that we cultivate are surprisingly similar.”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan immediately laughed.

After hearing Ye Xuan’s hearty laughter, Ouyang Xiu secretly rejoiced.

“It seems that this young man is related to the Immortal Divine sect over there. In this case, I’ll be able to win.”

Although he belonged to the South continent’s Immortal Divine sect, both sects had the same origins. Things were looking up! 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“So what if there are two of you? Bring it on!”

Yanran was also making her own conclusions. Seeing Ye Xuan and the old man laughing so happily, she was already regarding Ye Xuan as an enemy.

Moments later, she flew up into the air and pressed down with both hands, circulating her supreme power to create a huge tornado.

Yanran was at the center of the tornado, prepared for a bitter battle.

“This aura… It’s actually the Great Desolation technique!”

Ye Xuan was surprised and looked at her in disbelief.

As one of the Great Wilderness Divine sect’s chiefs, he was naturally very familiar with the Great Desolation technique that the sect master used. The technique Yanran had used was undoubtedly the same thing.

Could it be that the Great Wilderness Divine sect also existed in the Heaven continent?

Ye Xuan was dumbfounded. Why had his teacher never mentioned this to him?

Or perhaps, even his teacher did not know about this?

The Great Wilderness Divine sect was also an extremely ancient sect. Perhaps they too had been split up when the mystic world was separated into eight parts.

“Forget it. I will discuss this with Senior Brother Gongsun after I return to thesect.”

After all, even if the Great Wilderness Divine sect existed in the Heaven continent, she was still a complete stranger. However, at the very least, he now knew which side to stand on.

‘Hehe, this time I have to act like a senior brother,’ Ye Xuan thought happily.

At this moment, as terrifyingly strong gusts of wind blew past, the surroundings began to shake violently, as if it was about to crumble bit by bit.

After seeing this, Ouyang Xiu subconsciously broke out in a cold sweat and quickly looked at Ye Xuan.

“Little Brother, this person is Yanran from the heaven continent’s Great Wilderness Divine sect. She is a mid-stage supreme realm expert, and a formidable fighter.”

“However, worry not. If we both work together, we’ll be able to defeat her,” Ouyang Xiu said. He was already thinking about how to defeat Yanran with Ye Xuan’s help.

However, moments later, Ye Xuan suddenly looked at Ouyang Xiu and said in an unpleasant tone, “Which ear of yours heard that I wanted to cooperate with you? Do you think we’re close?”

“Ah?”

“Huh?”

Two questioning voices instantly rang out.

At this time, Ouyang Xiu was completely dumbfounded, and Yanran was even more puzzled.

Could it be that this man and Ouyang Xiu were not on the same side?

Ouyang Xiu’s face turned pale and he immediately asked, “Little brother, what do you mean by this?”

Ye Xuan sneered and replied, “It would actually have been better if you hadn’t told me that you were from the Immortal Divine sect. I would’ve been a neutral bystander then.”

“But it’s different now. Since you’ve brought it up, I have to tell you something.”

“I’ve just split Elder Taiyin from the Immortal Divine sect in the East continent into two.”

“What?!”

After hearing this sentence, Ouyang Xiu’s expression turned ugly.

This person actually had such a bad relationship with the East continent’s Immortal Divine sect, and killed one of their elders?

Why did he not say this earlier?

If he had said it from the beginning, he would not have tried to link the sects together!

At that moment, Yanran burst out laughing. This old man was really too funny. He probably did not know what to do anymore.

Ouyang Xiu’s next move was a classic.

“Little brother, although our South continent’s Immortal Divine sect and the East continent’s Immortal Divine sect are from the same sect, after being separated for so long, they have nothing to do with each other.”

“Since you have a grudge with the East continent’s Immortal Divine sect, you can deal with it without worrying. I will definitely not interfere.”

Ouyang Xiu’s face was probably even more thick-skinned than a city wall.
