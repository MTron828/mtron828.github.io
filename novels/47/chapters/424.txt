425 Palace

Cough cough!

Hua Rufeng did not expect Ye Xuan to be such a person. Still, he was surprised that Ye Xuan had managed to win the favor of the Su family, who were well-known in Qingyang City for their wealth and power.

It seemed that the youngest chief of the Great Wilderness Divine sect was as capable as the others.

Hua Rufeng took a meaningful look at Ye Xuan. It was now necessary to build a good relationship with Ye Xuan.

However, although Hua Rufeng understood Cloud Sky peak’s situation, Su Changhe did not.

When he heard Ye Xuan say this, he felt admiration in his heart.

This was a true expert. Ye Xuan was unmoved despite the gift of ten thousand taels of profound gold.

“Chief Ye Xuan is indeed like my father said, a true expert. Such worldly possessions are clearly meaningless to you.”

“In addition to the 10,000 taels of profound gold, my father also specifically asked me to bring other gifts. These are all specialties of our Su family in the extremely cold lands!”

“This is a treasure called bitter spirit tea. Other than that, there are also many other rare treasures!”

“By the way, Father also specifically instructed us to build a palace for Chief Ye Xuan! One befitting of your status and prestige.”

“Oh?” Ye Xuan’s eyes lit up.

Su Tiansheng was really something. He had actually thought about everything in detail. He was truly a friend worth having.

Over the past hundred years, not only did Ye Xuan lack cultivation resources, but even his residence was rather shabby.

Although he was also a chief of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, his residence on Cloud Sky peak was not much better than the residences of mortals in the outside world.

“Master Su is indeed very considerate. In that case, this matter will be left in your care. As an immortal cultivator, I don’t pay too much attention to these things. You can do as you see fit,” Ye Xuan said indifferently.

When Hua Rufeng saw this scene, he was in awe.

Martial Uncle Ye’s ability to maintain his composure was truly top-notch. It was no wonder he managed to hide his strength for so many years.

Su Changhe, on the other hand, was elated. After getting Ye Xuan’s permission and approval, he was prepared to go all out and do something big.

After all, this was a rare opportunity for him. If he performed well, he might be able to draw Ye Xuan closer to his family.

Moreover, Ye Xuan was one of the chiefs of the Great Wilderness Divine sect. If he was happy and taught him some high-grade divine power or something, would that not be amazing?

“What are you guys doing? Hurry up and get to work!”

“I’ll give you 30 days. You must complete the palace within a month.”

Su Changhe immediately gave orders to the servants he had brought along.

It had to be admitted that the Su family was indeed extremely rich. Soon, even more workers poured into Cloud Sky peak to construct the palace.

As per Ye Xuan’s instructions, the brand-new palace would be built in the peach forest on the mountain peak, which was surrounded by a sea of blooming flowers. If a luxurious palace was added, would it not be the perfect place for cultivation?

Ye Xuan smiled as he watched Su Changhe diligently lead the workers to construct the palace. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Ye Xuan returned to the courtyard and sat on the chair in the hall. The corners of his mouth curved into a beautiful arc, and he was already looking forward to the new palace in his mind.

“Greetings, Martial Uncle Ye!”

Just then, Hua Rufeng walked in.

“Rufeng? Is there something you need from me?”

Ye Xuan looked up, a little puzzled.

He was not sure why this kid was still here.

In any case, Ye Xuan was quite satisfied with Hua Rufeng.

After all, in the past hundred years, Hua Rufeng was the person he was most familiar with aside from his two disciples.

Hearing this, Hua Rufeng could not help but smile and then slowly said.

“I was told that Martial Uncle Ye accepted another disciple. Is she around? As her senior brother, I’d really like to meet her.”

In fact, before he came to Cloud Sky peak, Gongsun Shouyue had specifically instructed Hua Rufeng to take the opportunity to investigate Ye Xuan’s two disciples.

After all, once he found out that Ye Xuan was a mystic lord realm expert, Gongsun Shouyue was shocked. He now had to pay special attention to all matters regarding Cloud Sky peak.

Gongsun Shouyue was especially curious about Ye Xuan. Why had a mystic lord realm expert like him hidden his strength for a hundred years?

However, no matter what, this meant that the Great Wilderness Divine sect now had an additional mystic lord realm expert. This gave him hope that the Great Wilderness Divine sect would rise again.

“The two girls are cultivating on the mountain peak, and it’s almost time for them to finish!”

As expected, as soon as Ye Xuan finished speaking, two beautiful figures suddenly appeared outside the courtyard.

“Teacher, we’re back from our cultivation session.”

Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun were holding hands as they walked in with smiles on their faces. When they entered the main hall of the courtyard, they saw Hua Rufeng inside.

“Senior Brother Hua? It’s been a long time. Why have you come to Cloud Sky peak?”
