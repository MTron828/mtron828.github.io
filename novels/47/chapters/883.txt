884 Dispatching A Team

Gao Shun was under great pressure at the moment. He also knew that he could not stop the disciples from fighting for opportunities, so he felt very troubled.

“Junior Brother Ye, what are you doing? I really can’t hold on any longer,” he muttered.

Looking at the crowd, he finally said, “Gao Shun could not help but mutter in his heart, and then he said, “Sigh… Since this is an opportunity, we cultivators must not miss out on it.”

“Given the current situation, it will probably take a lot of time for Senior Brother Ao to wake up. By then, it will probably be too late.”

“Junior Brother Lu, I can’t leave the Great Wilderness Divine sec at the moment, so you will have to lead the team. Take Junior Brother Li and the other elders with you.”

After hearing this, the disciples at the scene immediately became excited, and could barely contain themselves.

Now that Gao Shun had given the green light, they could rush to the East Sea to fight for their own opportunities!

However, at this moment, there were also many disciples who were very worried. They were afraid that they would not be able to return this time. After all, they did not have an expert leading them.

After pondering for a moment, Gao Shun turned to look at Zhuge Yueyue.

“Martial Niece Zhuge, you’re the strongest among the sect’s disciples, so I’m afraid that our team’s chances will be non-existent without you. Why don’t you follow them to the East Sea?”

Zhuge Yueyue, on the other hand, looked worriedly in the direction of Cloud Sky Cave. She wanted to stay by her teacher’s side and did not want to leave.

However, judging from the current situation, if the sect did not have a good showing at the ancient palace, the sect’s reputation would likely suffer. Still… Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

After thinking for a while, Zhuge Yueyue snuck a glance at Feng Xiyun, and the corners of her mouth curled up slightly…

Feng Xiyun also noticed Zhuge Yueyue’s evil smile and her heart trembled.

“First… Sister?”

Feng Xiyun asked tentatively in a trembling voice. However, before she could continue, Zhuge Yueyue grabbed her arm and said, “Second Sister, you don’t have to say anything. You’re not young anymore, so it’s time for you to take up more responsibilities.”

“Currently, there are many pressing matters on Cloud Sky peak, and I can’t head to the East Sea. As such, it’s best if you replace me. What do you think?”

Looking at Zhuge Yueyue’s hopeful gaze, Feng Xiyun could not bring herself to refuse. Therefore, she could only grit her teeth and say, “Alright, I’ll go in your stead!”

In the past, many of the situations she encountered were either handled by her teacher, or her senior sister. At this moment, it was time for her to share the burden.

Coincidentally, she could also test out the immortal-grade technique Ye Xuan taught her. Seeing Feng Xiyun agree, Zhuge Yueyue felt quite gratified.

“Second Sister,” Zhuge Yueyue said after thinking for a moment, feeling worried, “On this trip to the Eastern Sea, you might encounter many geniuses, and there will be many strong opponents among them.”

“The responsibility of safeguarding the reputation of Cloud Sky peak and the Great Wilderness Divine sect will be handed over to you.”

“First Sister, don’t worry. I’ll definitely make the sect proud.”

Feng Xiyun did not hesitate to say this. At this moment, she was full of confidence. After all, she had the Heaven Burning Flames that could burn everything. Why should she be afraid of others?

“Alright, that’s good. However, remember that being careful is never a bad thing.”

Zhuge Yueyue then watched as Feng Xiyun left.

Now that Feng Xiyun, a peerless supreme realm genius had taken action, the sect’s chances of success were much higher.

Furthermore, she was not an ordinary supreme realm expert, but one who possessed the immortal sacred body and the Heaven Burning Flames.

Therefore, Zhuge Yueyue was not worried about Feng Xiyun at all.

On the other side, in Cloud Sky Cave, golden light could be seen, as dense divine runes continuously flickered, making the cave exceptionally bright.

At this moment, Ye Xuan was using all of his strength to repair the crack in Ao Lei’s sea of consciousness to prevent any future troubles in the latter’s cultivation.

Over the past 40 days, the crack had almost been completely repaired.

“It can be considered a done deal now. He just needs to…”

After channeling the last bit of his strength, Ye Xuan opened his eyes, and the burden on his body lightened considerably.

He had spent almost every waking moment on this task, and it had exhausted him.

Junior Brother Ye, how is Senior Brother Ao’s situation?”

Yuelun was standing nervously behind Ye Xuan. Seeing that he was done with his work, she could not wait to ask.

Ye Xuan waved his hand and said, “Senior Brother Ao is fine. That being said, although his life force has recovered, the hidden danger in his sea of consciousness has not been completely eradicated.”
