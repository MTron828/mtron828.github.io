698 Acting Up

Even though Hua Rufeng had already activated the Great Desolation Divine technique at full strength, he had not gained an advantage over the Reincarnation Fairy.

“Get lost!”

In the sky, Zhuge Yueyue noticed what was going on, and saw Xu Changqing leading the charge. She raised her sword to block his attack, but at this moment, the other four circled around her to launch sneak attacks.

They clearly had no intention of letting her fully recover. If this situation continued, she would not be able to hold on for long.

As she struggled to defend herself against the attacks of the five people, Zhuge Yueyue was burning with anger.

“You asked for it!”

Zhuge Yueyue wanted to teach them a good lesson, so she had decided that this was the best opportunity to start acting.

After hearing this, the five of them backed away briefly, afraid that they would be hit with a powerful move.

Unexpectedly, Zhuge Yueyue reversed the flow of spiritual power in her body and spat out a few mouthfuls of dark red blood.

Seeing this scene, the five of them were dumbfounded?

Eh?

Where was the powerful move?

What the hell?

Then, a scream rang out in their ears.

“How dare you treat my first sister like that? You all have to die!”

Then, as they watched with widened eyes, dark clouds gathered in the sky, and a tempestuous wind started blowing.

Looking down below, they saw a furious little girl and her spinning hammer slowly approaching them.

Her killing intent engulfed the five participants, causing their hearts to tremble.

The audience outside the ancient realm turned to look at Ye Xuan. They were not unfamiliar with this scene.

After all, Feng Xiyun had done the same earlier, which resulted in Xiang Yun wiping out the disciples of the Supreme Divine sect. It seemed that Zhuge Yueyue had also taken acting lessons, and was deceiving this little girl.

How shameless!

“What is going on?”

Those inside the ancient realm were still unaware of what was going on. However, they could sense that Xiang Yun’s aura had multiplied by 40 times!

Then, when they thought back to what Zhuge Yueyue had just said, they realized what was going on.

“F*ck! This kind of joke is not funny at all!”

The five disciples all wore similarly gloomy expressions. Even before her strength spiked, they had not been able to harm her without using their trump cards, but now she was strong enough to wipe the floor with her.

The aura she emitted was even suffocating. If they did not do anything, the only outcome waiting for them was tragedy.

Xu Changqing took a deep breath and said in shock, “This little girl’s body has an immense amount of power sealed within it.When she can’t control her emotions, this power will automatically be activated.”

“If we don’t do anything, we’ll be killed!”

He looked around and said to the other four, “Everyone, we have to cooperate and give it our all to eliminate this little girl right now. Otherwise, we will have no hope of becoming the champion. If you continue to hold back, then prepare to be eliminated!”

After hearing this, they agreed without hesitation.

Seeing this, Zhuge Yueyue secretly rejoiced.

“Teacher is right. Third Sister, I can only apologize to you later”

“When we return to the sect, I’ll give you a few hundred roasted potatoes. I hope you won’t be angry.”

The smile on Zhuge Yueyue’s face grew wider at the thought of this, but she quickly suppressed it. Then, she quietly circulated her spiritual power in reverse again.

Moments later, she spat out blood again and fell from the sky. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“What?! Does she have to go that far?”

When they saw Zhuge Yueyue start acting again, everyone’s hearts trembled. No one had hurt her so badly, so why did she have to be so mean to herself?

“First Sister!”

Xiang Yun’s eyes turned bloodshot when she saw Zhuge Yueyue fall down. She stared at Xu Changqing and the others angrily.

“Today None of you can escape!”
