393 Another Disciple

Hearing this, Ye Xuan frowned.

Why had the news spread so quickly? Did these cultivators have nothing better to do than gossip and spread rumors?

“So now that you’ve met me, what do you think?”

Ye Xuan responded lightly. His expression was calm and indifferent.

Seeing this, Feng Xiyun felt more admiration for him. Very few people would be unmoved by her true appearance, and after receiving praise.

It was sufficient to show how steady Ye Xuan’s temperament was.

Feng Xiyun’s eyes lit up.

Such a young, powerful, and determined expert…

Was he not the perfect teacher she was looking for?

As a princess, Feng Xiyun had naturally seen many experts, which is why she was so particular about acknowledging someone as her teacher.

Then, Feng Xiyun blinked her eyes playfully, “Chief Ye Xuan is indeed as the rumors say. With just a single glance, I have been rendered stunned and speechless.”

“That being said, I wonder if Chief Ye Xuan has any thoughts of taking in a disciple?”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan turned around and looked at Feng Xiyun seriously.

“You want to become my disciple?”

“En!” Feng Xiyun nodded with a smile.

Feng Xiyun had visited almost all of the top-tier holy lands within the territory of the empire, but she had not found any satisfactory ones.

The Great Wilderness Divine sect was the last holy land that Feng Xiyun wanted to visit. If she failed there, she would just randomly pick one of the powerful holy lands.

It seemed that fate was smiling on her though, as she had encountered Ye Xuan. If she could become his disciple, it would naturally be for the best.

Ye Xuan felt that she was a decent disciple candidate.

“Although your level of talent is rather mediocre, it’s still not beyond hope,” Ye Xuan said lightly.

Hearing this, Feng Xiyun’s eyes could not help but flash with joy. She suddenly thought of something and asked with a face full of curiosity.

“Chief Ye Xuan, aren’t you curious about my identity and background?”

Did this guy not care about the background and origin of his potential disciple

Was he not afraid of inviting trouble upon himself?

Hearing this, Ye Xuan looked indifferently at Feng Xiyun.

“When I take in disciples, fate is the only thing that matters!”

“Even if the disciple I take in comes from a humble background, as long as he or she has a firm heart for cultivation, is diligent and eager to learn, and has a righteous heart, he or she is qualified to become my disciple.”

His reply earned Feng Xiyun’s admiration.

Many other experts attached great importance to the background and cultivation talent of their disciples.

However, Ye Xuan was different. What he valued the most was fate and his disciple’s heart for cultivation.

Once she thought of this, Feng Xiyun was even more determined to acknowledge him as her teacher.

“Disciple Feng Xiyun pays her respects to Teacher!”

Feng Xiyun immediately knelt down in front of Ye Xuan without any hesitation, afraid that the latter would go back on his words.

When Xin’er saw this, her eyes were filled with astonishment.

She was extremely clear about Feng Xiyun’s character. Every action she took was done after careful consideration, so seeing her decide to become Ye Xuan’s disciple so quickly shocked her.

Was this not a little too rushed?

“Mm! Xiyun, from today onwards, you will be this my disciple.”

Ye Xuan looked calm and composed on the surface, but he was secretly laughing inwardly.

Ever since the system had reawakened, he had been wanting to take in a few more disciples. After all, the more disciples he had, the faster his strength would improve.

However, Ye Xuan’s criteria for accepting a disciple was the other party’s heart.

In his search through the East continent, only Feng Xiyun’s performance met his requirements.

Ye Xuan had been here the entire time the moment the Red Hell Snake appeared, silently observing Feng Xiyun and Xin’er’s performance.

Fortunately, Feng Xiyun did not let him down.

“Xiyun, you’re my second disciple in the mystic world. The one currently fighting the purgatory red snake is your senior sister!”

“My precious disciple, stand up. We can handle the ceremonial part when we return to the Great Wilderness Divine sect.”

“Many thanks, Teacher!”

When Feng Xiyun heard this, she stood up elegantly. Her words revealed the temperament of nobility.

“Congratulations, Your Highness. You’ve finally gotten your wish and successfully acknowledged a teacher.”

At this moment, Xin’er came forward with a smile to congratulate her.

Hearing this, Ye Xuan’s eyes twitched.

Princess?

It seemed that the identity of this disciple of his was not simple!

However, Ye Xuan did not probe further.

After all, he had just said that he did not value status when taking in disciples.

At the same time, the battle between Zhuge Yueyue and the Red Hell Snake was coming to an end.

Although the Red Hell Snake was extremely agile, the Cloud Sky sword in Zhuge Yueyue’s hand allowed her to gradually corner it with her sword qi. The Red Hell Snake had no way of escaping.

After a while, Zhuge Yueyue cut off the head of the Red Hell Snake and retrieved its precious bone. She walked toward Ye Xuan with a smile on her face.

“Teacher, how was my performance just now?” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Zhuge Yueyue put away the precious bone and looked at Ye Xuan with anticipation.

“Mm! You’ve cultivated the Cloud Sky sword technique well, but you’re still lacking in terms of combat experience. You just need to practice more in the future!”

Ye Xuan thought about it for a moment and then made a comment.

Zhuge Yueyue’s eyes darkened when she heard that. She felt a little disappointed.

However, at the same time, Zhuge Yueyue also knew where her weakness lay.

“Alright, don’t think too much about it. Hurry up and come over.”

“This is my new disciple, and your junior sister. Her name is…”

Ye Xuan laughed awkwardly.

“My precious disciple, what’s your name again?”

He had clearly forgotten Feng Xiyun’s name.
