Seeing this, the Qingyun sect disciples finally realized that their sect leader had comprehended sword intent.

“Congratulations to the sect leader for comprehending sword intent!”

Immediately, the congratulatory voices were like thunder, resounding across the entire mountain.

To them, comprehending sword intent was an unattainable achievement. They knew very well that this was something that countless Sword Dao cultivators dreamed of.

Since the founding of the Great Qian Dynasty, there had been many talented sword geniuses, but most of them were stuck at the threshold of comprehending sword intent.

Legend had it that only by successfully comprehending sword intent could a Sword Dao cultivator step onto the true path of Sword Dao cultivation.

“Ye Xuan, Ye Xuan, you really know how to hide things!”

Wan Shanhai’s gaze fell on Ye Xuan, and he looked at him with a strange expression.

If Ye Xuan had not taken the initiative to display his sword intent, he would not have known the realm of sword intent that Ye Xuan had already comprehended.

At the beginning, he only felt that Ye Xuan’s moves were filled with some sort of special mysterious power, which faintly resonated with the power of Heaven and Earth. It was not until he successfully comprehended sword intent that he realized Ye Xuan’s attainments in the comprehension of sword intent.

The most crucial thing was that the sword intent that Ye Xuan displayed was natural and free-flowing, without the slightest bit of awkwardness. It was obvious that the other party had not just comprehended sword intent.

Could it be that this guy’s attainments in sword intent had reached the second level, or perhaps even higher?

Although Wan Shanhai was extremely curious about this, he knew that such matters were best kept secret.

“I was just lucky!” Ye Xuan smiled.

“Lucky? You are the strongest genius of the Great Qian Dynasty. You are also an unprecedented genius of the Qingyun sect!”

“Geniuses should be like this!”

Wan Shanhai said loudly.

He was very happy now. What was a mere Heart-seeking Fruit compared to the successful comprehension of sword intent?

“Still, I have to thank you!”

“If you hadn’t deliberately showed off your sword intent just now, I don’t know when I would have been able to cross that threshold and comprehend sword intent!”

Wan Shanhai cupped his fists at Ye Xuan and thanked him, his heart filled with gratitude.

Although his comprehension of sword intent was closely related to his own foundation of Sword Dao cultivation, Ye Xuan was the catalyst.

In other words, in terms of sword intent, Ye Xuan was equivalent to his teacher.

Therefore, Wan Shanhai’s gratitude toward Ye Xuan was sincere.

Seeing this, many of the Qingyun sect cultivators were dumbfounded.

They had not expected that the reason why the sect leader had been able to comprehend sword intent was actually due to Elder Ye.

Did that mean that Elder Ye’s attainments in sword intent had reached an extremely terrifying level? They were all humans, so why was there such a huge gap between them and him?

Could it be that Elder Ye’s cultivation had already reached the same level as the sect leader’s?

All sorts of thoughts flashed through everyone’s minds. Their gazes fell on Ye Xuan, and their eyes were filled with fervor.

Moreover, the effect of Ye Xuan’s display of sword intent was quite obvious. Not only had Wan Shanhai comprehended sword intent, but the other cultivators had also gained a lot.

Many cultivators who were stuck in their cultivation of Sword Dao were suddenly enlightened and gained a new understanding of sword qi and their own cultivation.

It could be said that any cultivator who witnessed Ye Xuan’s sword intent display with their own eyes had gained something.

“Elder Ye is too amazing!”

Everyone’s hearts were filled with admiration and gratitude for Ye Xuan.

Ye Xuan’s actions just now were undoubtedly meant for them. He had displayed his own sword intent to enlighten everyone from the Qingyun sect. This was not something that any of the past elders could do.

Seeing this, Lin Qing, who was beside him, looked at Ye Xuan with a complicated expression.

Half a month ago, her cultivation level had been the same as Ye Xuan. They were both cultivators at the middle stage of the Xudan stage.

However, over this half a month, her cultivation had not made any progress at all. On the other hand, Ye Xuan had already reached a level that she could not see through at all.

When she learned about Ye Xuan’s deeds from Huang Ling and Xue Min, her heart was even more shocked.

They told her that Ye Xuan had refined the Dark Glacial Frost extremely quickly, and that they had also sensed Ye Xuan’s terrifying spiritual pressure.

If what Huang Ling and Xue Min said was true, then Ye Xuan had very likely reached the golden core realm!

Throughout the entire Great Qian Dynasty, there were very few golden core realm cultivators, and golden core realm cultivators that had comprehended sword intent were even more unprecedented.

Lin Qing wondered if the sect leader was aware of this.

Lin Qing took a deep breath, her heart was filled with shock.

She did not expect that the youth who had followed behind her and humbly asked for guidance on the Sword Dao back then had already grown to such a level.

In the blink of an eye, he had already left her far behind.

For a moment, Lin Qing’s heart was filled with all kinds of thoughts, and she felt slightly uncomfortable.

Of course, this was not because she was jealous of Ye Xuan’s strength, but rather because Ye Xuan’s talent was too monstrous. She felt suppressed by his talent.

Ye Xuan’s eyes narrowed. He also noticed the change in Lin Qing’s expression. He glanced at the latter and did not say much.

Lin Qing was more than ten years older than him. Even so, in the eyes of core formation realm cultivators, she was still extremely young.

Ye Xuan also knew how Lin Qing felt about him but, at the moment, he did not have such thoughts of discussing the matter.

“Let’s go back!”

Ye Xuan then took Yue and Li Qingyan and left.

“In five days, the Qingyun sect competition. All Qingyun sect disciples can participate!”

The voice of Wan Shanhai resounded across the mountain. Then, in a flash, he suddenly disappeared from the training ground.

The vice sect leader and the other elders also left one after another. When they witnessed Ye Xuan’s sword intent, they had also gained some insights and hurriedly went back to digest them.

Lingjiu Peak.

After Yue and Li Qingyan returned, they also chose to enter secluded cultivation to properly comprehend and consolidate today’s gains.

Now that the sect competition was about to commence, they had to seize every possible moment to improve their strength so that they could live up to their teacher’s expectations.

After returning, Wan Shanhai also called his disciple over.

He planned to follow Ye Xuan’s example and act as a sparring partner for his disciple, striving to improve his disciple’s strength before the sect competition commenced.

However, in order to prevent the other elders from making fun of him for imitating Ye Xuan, Wan Shanhai cleverly brought his disciple to a place in the wilderness and then began his sparring session.

He also suppressed his own cultivation and held a bronze sword in his hand.
