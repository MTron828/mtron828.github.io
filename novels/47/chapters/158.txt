Chapter 159: This Disciple Was Not Raised In Vain

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Junior Sister, I am the first disciple that Teacher mentioned. You can call me Senior Sister Yue!”

Yue looked at Zhao Yuyan with a gentle gaze, just like a big sister looking at a little sister.

“Greetings, Senior Sister Yue!”

Zhao Yuyan’s voice made her feel fuzzy inside.

“Junior Sister, in the future, you, me, and Teacher will be family!”

Yue held Zhao Yuyan’s hand affectionately.

Her junior sister was adorable.

“Family… I…”

Hearing Yue’s words, Zhao Yuyan’s eyes trembled. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Whoosh!

Suddenly, a streak of light flashed past.

“Teacher!”

“Teacher!”

His disciples’ greetings warmed his heaert.

Ye Xuan nodded with a smile, and then waved his sleeve. A few pills suddenly fell in front of Huang Ling, who caught them in a daze.

“The spirit moon tree was swallowed by the spatial crack. These few pills are compensation,” Ye Xuan said.

Of course, he did not need to do this at all, but he was in a very good mood now. In any case, it was not like he could not afford them.

“Thank you, Elder Ye!”

Huang Ling was overjoyed.

Although she could not become his disciple, it was still a fortunate thing to be in the same sect as Elder Ye Xuan.

Moreover, if she stuck around him, she still obtained benefits.

“Yue, did that monk want to snatch your treasure?”

Ye Xuan’s gaze fell on Yue.

“That’s right! I obtained an extremely rare spirit fruit earlier and, just as I put it into my storage ring, that monk appeared. He said that the spirit fruit was fated with Buddhism and wanted me to part with it!”

“Of course, I didn’t agree, and then that monk tried to snatch it, which forced me to use the trump cards that you gave me,” Yue said.

“Ridiculous! Those bald donkeys all use the same excuse. They clearly covet other people’s treasures!”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan sneered.

They used Buddhism as an excuse to snatch away the fruits of others’ labor.

How ridiculous!

“Yue, what kind of spirit fruit did you obtain?”

When Yue heard this question, she took out the spirit fruit from her storage ring.

Although it was a spirit fruit, from the outside, it looked like a sparkling and translucent crystal. The outermost layer of the crystal was covered by a sparkling and translucent shell, while the inside of the crystal looked like stars.

“It’s a Dream Nebula spirit fruit!”

Seeing this, Ye Xuan’s eyes lit up. He did not expect his precious disciple to be so lucky,

“Teacher, what is a Dream Nebula spirit fruit?”

Judging from Ye Xuan’s expression, this thing was definitely not ordinary.

In her eyes, Ye Xuan could be considered a moving treasure trove. He had no lack of precious heavenly treasures, yet this spirit fruit had surprised him, which meant that it was something good.

“This spirit fruit can increase a cultivator’s comprehension value. Its effect is not much different from the Buddha Spirit fruit. When a cultivator consumes it, they will also experience an epiphany.”

He had obtained the Buddha Spirit fruit, while Yue had obtained the Dream Nebula spirit fruit. Coincidentally, they were also both targeted by the same stinky monk.

Hearing this, Yue’s eyes lit up. It was indeed a rare treasure!

Ye Xuan looked at the Dream Nebula spirit fruit in Yue’s hand and could not help but sigh.

This thing was discovered by Yue. He would not be able to obtain a system reward from it.

“Teacher, since this spirit fruit is so useful, I’ll give it to you!”

Yue revealed a sweet smile and handed the spirit fruit over.

She had never seen her teacher’s expression of surprise and joy. Furthermore, it was always her teacher who was giving them treasures and gifts. It was time to repay her teacher.

This was undoubtedly a great opportunity. Although the Dream Nebula spirit fruit was extremely precious, Yue did not feel the slightest bit of reluctance parting with it.

In Yue’s heart, her teacher’s position was supreme. It was something that no one could replace.

“Cough, cough!”

Seeing this, Ye Xuan quickly coughed to cover up the awkwardness he was feeling.

He did not expect Yue to hand over the spirit fruit so decisively. He also knew that if he asked Yue for it, she would naturally hand it over without hesitation.

However, Yue took the initiative to give it to him. This girl was quite observant.

“Since my disciple is so filial, I have to accept it.”

Ye Xuan was secretly happy.

“That being said, I can’t take your treasure for free!”

Ye Xuan waved his sleeve, and the Sword Orchid Valley Lord suddenly appeared in front of Yue.

“This is the Sword Orchid Valley Lord. It is very beneficial to those who have Sword Dao special constitutions. It can strengthen your Sword Jade body to a certain extent. Take it. When I am free, I will help you refine it!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the Sword Orchid Valley Lord transformed into a streak of light and landed in Yue’s hand.
