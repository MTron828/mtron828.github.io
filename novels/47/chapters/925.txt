926 Lightning Rod

The Thunder-Devouring Beast kept releasing purple divine lightning, causing space to crack.

On Ye Xuan’s side, after he withstood the Thunder-Devouring Beast’s next round of attacks, he took a deep breath. The expression on his face was also very happy.

He had been constantly comprehending the Dao of Space, and had already grasped some mysteries. Therefore, he soon realized that even though this Thunder-Devouring Beast had an extremely powerful innate divine ability, it did not know how to use it.

Every attack it launched during the battle was extremely reckless and full of flaws.

Thinking this, Ye Xuan’s face turned red with embarrassment when he thought of how cowardly he had been just now.

‘Damn it! This Thunder-Devouring Beast had me scared to death for a moment!’

At this moment, he had clearly realized that the Thunder-Devouring Beast in front of him only looked very scary. Its true combat strength was nothing worth shouting about at all. Instead, it had just put on a facade to try and scare him away.

He was no longer worried about this battle, and even started smiling. This was an excellent opportunity.

‘Hehe, very good, very good. In this case, I’ll make this fellow into my subordinate so that from now on I can use his lightning runes to charge myself up whenever and wherever I want.”

The smile on Ye Xuan’s face grew brighter. Now, all he had to do was end the battle quickly. As such, he did not continue to dodge the attacks of the Thunder-Devouring Beast. Instead, he stretched out his hands and kept performing hand seals.

In the blink of an eye, a ball of lightning appeared in front of Ye Xuan, containing a terrifying amount of lightning energy.

Then, he smiled and looked at the Thunder-Devouring Beast in a friendly manner, but did not speak.

‘Huh? What exactly is going on?’ Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

The Thunder-Devouring Beast was a little confused at this moment.

‘Did this kid give up on beating me, and now wants to get along with me?’

Thinking this, the Thunder-Devouring Beast was filled with joy. If it managed to subdue this powerful human and make him its follower, no one would ever be able to snatch its immortal heavenly treasure, and it could even brag about it to whoever it met.

That would be so awesome!

With this thought in mind, the Thunder-Devouring Beast decided that since the other party had already taken the initiative to show weakness, it had to show him just how powerful it was so that he would submit to it.

The Thunder-Devouring Beast roared at the sky again, and even more powerful and dense divine lightning appeared in the sky. This caused the entire ancient palace to shake continuously, and everyone’s faces turned pale with fright.

“Oh my god… So powerful!”

They could clearly sense that the Thunder-Devouring Beast had mobilized its full strength at this moment. If they were struck by that lightning, they would be severely injured, or even die!

At the same time, everyone turned to look at Ye Xuan, wanting to see how he would block this devastating attack.

However, Ye Xuan had not taken up any sort of defensive stance!

It was as if he had already given up on resisting.

“No!”

Seeing this scene, Yanran panicked. She did not want to become a widow at such a young age, so she rushed towards Ye Xuan without any regard for her own safety.

However, due to the obstruction of the spatial domain, even though she was very close to Ye Xuan, no matter how fast she flew, she was unable to reach Ye Xuan’s side.

‘Oh no, I’m really going to become a widow.’

That was what Yanran was thinking at the moment. She watched as the powerful divine lightning blasted towards Ye Xuan with unstoppable momentum.

Boom!

Accompanied by a roar, smoke rose from the scene, and everyone believed that Ye Xuan had been turned into a pile of ashes.

“Ugh…”

They did not want to see it. Just thinking about it made them feel nauseous.

After a long while, they finally took a peep, and subsequently let out gasps of surprise.

“What exactly happened here?”

The divine lightning released by the Thunder-Devouring Beast seemed to be charging Ye Xuan, causing Ye Xuan’s aura to increase in strength.

Everyone found it difficult to believe.

“Is this true? Does Ye Xuan possess the power of lightning as well?”

“Is this for real?”

Their minds were already filled with questions. Although the divine lightning released by the Thunder-Devouring Beast was not the strongest they had ever seen, it was still one of the best.

How could Ye Xuan refine and absorb the Thunder-Devouring Beast’s lightning?

Was this not too shocking?

At this moment, after being struck by the divine lightning released by the Thunder-Devouring Beast, Ye Xuan’s smile became even more radiant. He could sense that the lightning attribute power in his body had become even stronger, which filled him with indescribable excitement.

His speculation was correct!

“Endless Lightning…”

“Hehehe! Wonderful, really wonderful! So this was what the mystery of the immortal-grade technique hid? I finally figured it out,” Ye Xuan said happily.
