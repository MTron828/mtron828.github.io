Chapter 982 - 982 Help Is Here

Furthermore, this monster’s moves were very strange, so the little monkey found himself not being able to react in time. Fortunately, the little monkey’s body was very sturdy and tough, so he was able to fight evenly with the strange monster.

At this moment, the battlefield had already become extremely chaotic. Every cultivator was currently fighting with the monsters, and techniques and divine powers were flying everywhere.

As for the demon king, it had already set its eyes on Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun and was slowly approaching them.

“I really did not expect that the Heaven Burning Flames would actually appear in this world. This is really quite strange…”

As the demon king continued to approach them, Feng Xiyun held her breath nervously.

If it was a normal monster, she would still have ways to deal with it. However, this demon king was so powerful that it felt hopeless.

Could it be that she was really going to be swallowed by this demon king?

Feng Xiyun also felt extremely indignant at this moment, and also felt extremely sad when she saw geniuses being defeated by the monsters one after another and losing their lives.

No one had expected that such a terrifying demon king would be sealed in this space. Thanks to the little monkey’s carelessness, this evil had been unleashed upon the world.

At this moment, the little monkey felt extremely guilty. He also wanted to make up for his mistakes and kill this demon king, but he did not possess the strength to change this situation.

“Little girl, are you ready to die?”

After hearing the demon king’s words, Feng Xiyun trembled violently. She asked, “Who exactly are you?”

“You’re asking who I am?”

The demon king looked at the endless skies at this moment. He smiled and said, “I am the king of the Dark clan, so you can call me the Dark King!”

At this moment, the demon king seemed to be immersed in the past. Feng Xiyun felt disgusted at this moment. When she saw that Zhuge Yueyue had still not woken up, she felt even more nervous.

She wanted to drag things out. However, based on the current situation, no matter how long she dragged it out, it probably would not change anything.

“Haha, don’t struggle anymore. Although the Heaven Burning Flames in your body are extremely powerful, it’s also a great tonic for me!”

“Be obedient and become my snack!”

The Dark King smiled wickedly and walked toward Feng Xiyun. His sinful hands reached out to grab her.

Looking at this scene, Feng Xiyun no longer felt any hope. She felt extremely unwilling as scenes from the past flash across her mind.

She looked sadly at Zhuge Yueyue, who was still unconscious.

“First Sister, no matter what happened before, you would shelter me from the wind and rain without hesitation. Now, let me shelter you from the wind and rain once,” Feng Xiyun murmured softly.

Feng Xiyun stood in front of Zhuge Yueyue after she said that. A ball of burning flames instantly appeared in her palm as she spoke coldly, “Bring it on!”Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

After saying this, Feng Xiyun stared at the Demon King in front of her. Seeing him reaching out his hand to attack her, she instantly threw out the Heaven Burning Flames in her hand.

The burning flames were instantly extinguished by the Dark King. It was completely useless. Then, just as she gave up all hope, a series of cries were suddenly heard from afar.

“What exactly is going on?”

Everyone on the battlefield looked over at the same time. After all, this was very likely to be their only hope of survival.

Moments later, beams of golden divine light flashed, causing the originally dark world to be filled with colors again. The murderous aura also dissipated significantly.

“Isn’t that the Nine-tailed Sparrow?”

At this moment, everyone was extremely surprised. No one had expected that the Nine-tailed Sparrow would suddenly appear here at such a critical moment.

The moment the Nine-tailed Sparrow appeared, a few figures flickering with divine light appeared in the distance again. All of them released terrifying auras.

Looking at this scene, everyone felt very excited. They had not expected that someone would actually rush over to save them.

The Nine-tailed Sparrow’s seven-colored divine light shattered the Dark King’s cage, and several experts rushed in, turning the tides of the battle.

After noticing this scene, the Dark King frowned. However, he did not panic. Instead, he soon smiled again.

“Haha, interesting, interesting. More snacks have arrived.”
Looking at the experts in the distance, the Dark King asked disdainfully.

“Do you think that you can defeat me with your weak strength?”

Hearing this, the elder standing at the front smiled and replied, “We definitely have no way to defeat you, but there will still be someone who can.”

“Oh? What do you mean?”

The Dark King was confused. The next moment, a sword that released blood-red light gave him the answer when it flew toward him.

In an instant, the world fell silent. A blood-red divine light instantly filled the entire world, driving away the darkness.

Even though the Dark King was surprised, he reacted instantly, and blocked the sword with his palm.

After the blood-red sword turned around, it landed steadily in the hands of a white figure.

“Teacher!”

Upon seeing his arrival, Feng Xiyun immediately shouted excitedly, her eyes glowing once again.

In the sky, the Nine-tailed Sparrow cried out once again, releasing bursts of seven-colored divine light that drove away the strange monsters.

At the same time, more and more experts rushed over, including many experts of the Great Wilderness Divine sect.

“Aren’t you being a little rude? Someone as ancient as you actually dared to target a junior. Let us old men play with you first!”
