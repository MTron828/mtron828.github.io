501 Sword Immortal Ye Xuan

“Hmph! Ye Xuan! I will never forget the humiliation I suffered today!”

“When I reach the supreme realm, I will settle this score!”

Elder Taiyin’s eyes were filled with ferocity.

Then, he circulated the spiritual power in his body to heal his injuries. He also took a few healing pills.

“Senior Brother, are you alright?”

Li Siyuan walked over with a worried look.

Seeing this, Elder Taiyin looked at the latter with cold eyes.

He naturally knew in his heart that the reason he had ended up in this horrible situation was due to this guy’s words.

Thinking this, Elder Taiyin gave him a slap.

With that terrifying explosion of energy, Li Siyuan was sent flying and smashed into the wall.

When Su Changkong and the others saw this, their expressions changed. They lowered their heads and did not dare to speak.

Elder Taiyin’s eyes flashed with a cold gleam.

The reputation of the Immortal Divine sect had been dealt a serious blow today, and Ye Xuan’s words had poured salt on an open wound.

Which potential seedling would choose to join the Immortal Divine sect now?

This incident had established the difference between their two sects.

“You all, wait outside. Once my injuries are healed, we will set off immediately!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Elder Taiyin glared at Li Siyuan coldly.

Were it not for the fact that they were from the same sect, he probably would have slapped Li Siyuan to death.

“I won’t pursue what happened today, but we’ll revisit this once we return to the sect.”

“The archaic divine mountains are in turmoil, and a heaven-shaking battle is about to occur! I hope you can atone for your sins and fight for more opportunities for the Immortal Divine sect.”

“If you perform well, I’ll let bygones be bygones and forget what happened just now.”

Hearing this, Li Siyuan revealed a look of wild joy and hurriedly nodded his head like a dog.

“Senior Brother, please don’t worry. I’ll do my best to regain the dignity of the Immortal Divine sect.”

“Mm! Hurry up and get out!”

Elder Taiyin looked at him indifferently. Once they left, he once again focused on recovering from his injuries. He needed to recover quickly to have any chance at vying for the heavenly treasure.

At the same time, Ye Xuan’s reputation spread throughout the entire archaic divine mountains once again.

After severely injuring the heaven devouring divine sparrow with a single sword strike, he had now defeated Elder Taiyin as well.

Ye Xuan’s reputation reached unprecedented heights, and people started calling him a sword immortal.

However, the person himself was unaware of this, and was continuing to travel with the Su family’s forces.

“Hahaha! Chief Ye Xuan, you were too awesome just now. You’re my idol.”

“My father said that Elder Taiyin was an extremely powerful and terrifying existence, and a leading figure of the previous era. I didn’t expect him to be defeated by you so easily.”

Su Changhe was indeed a talented bootlicker.

Ye Xuan smiled and did not say anything.

At this moment, Su Tiansheng also walked over.

“Chief Ye Xuan’s strength has truly surprised me. I believe that it won’t be long before you reach the legendary supreme realm!”

Su Tiansheng’s heart was filled with excitement.

Choosing Ye Xuan and Cloud Sky peak to become the Su family’s ally and backer was the best choice he had ever made in his life.

With such a powerful big shot supporting them, the Su family’s position in Qingyang City would be unshakeable. No one would dare to target them.

“It’s just a small matter. There’s no need to be so surprised.”

“This a f*cking small matter?”

Su Changhe’s mouth twitched when he heard that.

If this was a small matter, then there was no big matter in this world.

“What do you know, brat? For an expert like Chief Ye Xuan, defeating Elder Taiyin is indeed no big deal!”

“After all, the ultimate goal of a cultivator is to break through and become a true immortal!”

“Elder Taiyin and the Immortal Divine sect are mere stepping stones toward achieving that goal.”

Su Tiansheng quickly reprimanded Su Changhe.

Ye Xuan saw the change in their expressions and attitudes and laughed inwardly.

In fact, he had never valued fame, and did not want to be tied down by it.

At this moment, Chu Tianba also walked over and looked at Ye Xuan with amazement.

“Hahaha! I didn’t expect Fellow Daoist Ye Xuan’s strength to have reached such an astonishing level. I am truly surprised!”

“Elder Taiyin is really strong, and I can only barely go toe-to-toe with him. I didn’t expect him to be beaten up so badly by Fellow Daoist Ye Xuan.” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

At the thought of this, Chu Tianba could not help but sigh.

“I probably would not be able to withstand your final sword strike either.”

These were not words of flattery, but Chu Tianba’s true feelings.
