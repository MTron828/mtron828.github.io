475 Meeting Charlot Again

The corners of Su Changhe’s mouth curled up slightly as his gaze fell on a person in the distance.

This person was Charlot, who was Su Changhe’s arch-enemy.

However, Charlot currently looked extremely disheveled. His originally luxurious clothes were now in tatters. It was quite obvious that he had just returned from the archaic divine mountains. The aura within his body was in chaos.

How could Su Changhe miss out on such a rare opportunity?

He had never forgotten Charlot’s mocking look when he was beaten up by Ye Xuan.

Charlot naturally noticed Su Changhe as well, and his face turned even paler. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Su Changhe, what’s the meaning of this? Do you want to fight me?”

“Don’t joke with me? In your current state, I can beat a hundred of you, okay. Stop trying to act all arrogant and such.”

“Su Changhe, you…”

When Charlot saw Su Changhe’s disdainful expression, he was infuriated. Then, just as he was about to make a move, he suddenly realized that there was an additional figure behind Su Changhe.

Charlot immediately became flustered.

Why… How could it be him?

That white-robed figure had been deeply imprinted in Charlot’s mind. This person was a terrifying existence who had almost destroyed the entire Xia family.

Moreover, Ye Xuan had said before that he would definitely come to Qingyang City in the future. He had thought that Ye Xuan was just joking back then, but he had shown up in front of him right here and now.

“Young master…”

When the Xia family cultivators behind Charlot saw this, their eyes were filled with fear. They quickly reminded Charlot not to be rash and not to fight with Su Changhe.

They had long received news that the Su family had latched onto the Great Wilderness Divine sect and now had Cloud Sky peak as their backing.

All in all, in Qingyang City, the Su family’s strength had already surpassed the Xia family’s.

If Charlot still chose to go against Su Changhe now, would he not be asking for trouble?

Su Changhe naturally noticed the change in their expressions and quickly turned around to look. When he saw Ye Xuan coming over, he suddenly had a look of realization.

“Hehe… If you have the guts, come on over. Weren’t you always very arrogant? I’ll handicap myself by using one hand to beat you up!”

Now that Chief Ye Xuan was behind him, was this not the best time to show off?

There’s no other way. It’s impossible to keep a low profile with such a Big Shot by my side. Since that’s the case, why hide this young master’s overbearing aura?

“Hehe … If you have the guts, come over. Aren’t you very arrogant? So what if I give you a handicap of one hand? I’m going to hang you up and beat you up with one hand today,” Su Changhe said arrogantly.

“Su Changhe, don’t go too far…”

Charlot was enraged, and clenched his fists so tightly that his knuckles turned white. The Xia family cultivators were also angry, but restrained themselves.

“Hahaha! Young Master Su really knows how to joke. We’re no match for Young Master Su.”

“It’s only been a few days, but Young Master Su has changed greatly. You’ve become more handsome and suave, and your strength is extraordinary!”

“Xia Hai, one of Charlot’s guards, laughed as he flattered Su Changhe.

Su Changhe happily basked in the praise.

‘Oh my God, it’s been a long time since I’ve experienced the feeling of acting cool. It’s simply the best.”

“Seeing that you guys are aware of your place, today’s matter will end here. I won’t take this up with you,” Su Changhe said in all seriousness.

Seeing Su Changhe’s arrogant expression, Charlot was so angry that he almost vomited blood. However, when he remembered that Ye Xuan was around, he was forced to suppress his anger.

“I… I’ll admit defeat for now…”

“Xia Hai, let’s go back!”

Charlot glared at Su Changhe and was about to turn and leave.

“Wait a moment!”

Right at this moment, a voice suddenly called out.

Hearing this, Charlot’s expression changed.

He was all too familiar with this voice. This was the one person he did not want to offend.

Sure enough, it was Ye Xuan who had turned around with an indifferent expression and slowly walked toward them.

Charlot and the Xia family cultivators trembled, and their faces turned pale.

“Ye… Chief Ye Xuan!”

Charlot’s voice trembled as he called out. In his mind, he was already imagining how he was going to suffer.

However, what shocked him was that there was no hostility in Ye Xuan’s eyes.

“Did you all just return from the archaic divine mountains?”

Charlot was so scared that he could not respond. However, Xia Hai, who was beside him, was still calm. He quickly smiled and said, “Greetings, Chief Ye Xuan. We have indeed just returned from the outer regions of the archaic divine mountains. Does Chief Ye Xuan have any questions for us?”

“Mm! Very good!” Ye Xuan nodded, then asked, “What is the current situation in the archaic divine mountains and outside the city? Have you found any traces of the heaven devouring divine sparrow?”

Heaven devouring divine sparrow?

As soon as he finished speaking, he immediately attracted everyone’s attention.

It was at this moment that the cultivators on the city wall remembered that this handsome man in white was the terrifying existence who had killed the ancient ape with one sword.

“Great Wilderness Divine sect… Cloud Sky peak… Ye Xuan…”

“Why would he appear in Qingyang City?”

The expressions of the onlookers suddenly changed. They had been chatting so enthusiastically just now, so they had failed to notice Ye Xuan’s presence.

...

A few of them broke out in cold sweat and almost fell to the ground in fear.

Fortunately, none of them had been blabbering nonsense about the Great Wilderness Divine sect. If they had accidentally provoked this expert, they would probably have suffered greatly.

Ye Xuan was famous throughout the Yangli divine empire for having slain the ancient ape and defeating the three elders of the Immortal Divine sect..
