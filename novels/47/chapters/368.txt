369 Divine Spring, Heaven Realm

He had reached the peak of the void realm!

Ye Xuan’s pupils shone with dazzling divine light, and his dantian was gradually disintegrating.

Even with the chaos heart technique, he could not completely control the sudden influx of power in his body.

Ye Xuan steadied his mind and endured the pain. He frantically circulated the chaos heart technique to suppress the violent power raging in his body.

At this moment, the Golden Lotus of the Great Dao blossomed with a divine light. As he suppressed the vast power in his body, he gradually condensed a divine spring in his dantian!

The spiritual power in his body seemed to have found a pillar of support, and quickly flowed into the divine spring.

Condensing a divine spring in one’s dantian…

This was a sign that one had reached heaven realm!

“Hu!”

Ye Xuan took a deep breath, and the aura around his body roiled.

From this moment on, he was no longer the useless first chief of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, but a true heaven realm expert.

Next up, the mystic lord realm!

Calming himself down, he continued circulating the chaos heart technique to consolidate his cultivation foundation.

After a long time, Ye Xuan’s tightly shut eyes slowly opened. He now exuded a completely different aura from before, one that seemed to resonate and blend in with the surroundings at the same time.

Ye Xuan’s body seemed to contain more traces of extremely mysterious immortal spiritual power. Of course, this was due to the medicinal effects of the profound marrow pill more than anything else.

He examined the changes within his body, smiling the entire time.

After a while, Zhuge Yueyue also woke up from her state of cultivation. She almost jumped up in excitement when she sensed the changes in her strength.

“So this the power of a first-level divine mystic realm cultivator? I feel so powerful!”

Then, she remembered another crucial matter.

‘Didn’t Teacher say that he would teach me the sword controlling technique once my cultivation reached the divine mystic realm?’

‘Does this mean I can start learning divine powers as well?’

Thinking this, Zhuge Yueyue stood up excitedly and turned to look at Ye Xuan.

Once she did, she was stunned.

“Eh? Why does Teacher seem so different now?”

Zhuge Yueyue mumbled to herself in confusion.

However, she quickly regained her senses..

“Thank you, Teacher! Thanks to you, I’ve managed to reach the divine mystic realm!”

Zhuge Yueyue walked toward Ye Xuan and bowed respectfully, her eyes full of gratitude.

Looking back on the past, Zhuge Yueyue felt very fortunate.

Fortunately, the one who had chosen her was Ye Xuan. Otherwise, this heaven-shaking opportunity would never have been hers.

In the entire mystic world, she felt that there was no teacher as kind and as generous as Ye Xuan.

At this moment, she also made up her mind.

After avenging her parents, she would definitely stay by her teacher’s side in the future to repay his kindness.

“Silly girl, I’m your teacher. There’s no need to get so worked up.”

Ye Xuan smiled.

However, Zhuge Yueyue was very serious.

“Teacher, Yueyue will definitely repay your kindness in the future!”

“Before I met you, I was just a mortal. I didn’t have any lofty dreams. After my parents were killed by the berserk beasts, I just wanted to become stronger and avenge my parents!”

“Teacher, when I’ve completed my revenge, I’ll definitely stay with you on Cloud Sky peak forever.”

Ye Xuan’s gaze softened as he looked at Zhuge Yueyue’s tear-stained face as she recalled her sad past.

This girl had indeed experienced a miserable past. Moreover, no further clues had been found as to the source of the beast attack that day.

Now that he had become her teacher, he felt obligated to do something about this matter. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Ye Xuan thought for a moment, and then said, “How about this? After the Seven Peaks competition is over, I will take you to the outside world for training. At the same time, I will see if I can find out the truth behind the beast attack.”

Hearing this, Zhuge Yueyue raised her head and looked at Ye Xuan. Her heart was filled with complicated feelings.

Other than her parents, no one had shown her such kindness.

How could she ever repay him?

“Teacher!”

Zhuge Yueyue could not control her emotions. She threw herself into Ye Xuan’s arms and cried buckets.

Zhuge Yueyue had not cried since the day she lost her parents, as she had tried to remain strong. She knew very well that in this world of cultivation, where the strong preyed on the weak, no one would care about the tears of the weak.

However, she now had a pillar of support, and someone who truly cared for her.

Ye Xuan smiled and patted Zhuge Yueyue’s head, consoling her gently.

Zhuge Yueyue and sobbed for a long time before she slowly came back to her senses.

However, after that, Zhuge Yueyue realized that her actions were a little inappropriate. She had actually had the guts to throw herself into her teacher’s arms and cry. She immediately left Ye Xuan’s arms with a red face!

Zhuge Yue Yue wiped the tears from her face, but also felt comforted by the whole experience.
