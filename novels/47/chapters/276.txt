Chapter 277: Demon Blood Clan?

In the beginning, the sea race’s targets were only the coastal regions.

However, as time passed, the sea race gradually advanced toward the inner regions.

During the war between the sea race and the human race, many top experts of the sea race appeared and massacred humans mercilessly.

Three regions had been turned into ruins.

Were it not for the experts from both sides shifting the battle to the skies and the spatial turbulence, much more would have been destroyed. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Even so, more than 30 billion humans had died.

The terrifying number of casualties shocked the entire human race.

The top experts from the surrounding regions of the Tianze Zone tore space apart and traveled toward the stormy sea.

The boundless stormy sea echoed with the sounds of collisions and battle cries as the experts from both sides fought a frenzied battle.

In the end, the two races stopped fighting after paying a heavy price.

However, the human experts knew that the sea race’s ambition would not end here. They would definitely look for another opportunity to attack the humans.

Since the ancient era, the sea race and the human race were mortal enemies to begin with, and they had already fought many times over the years.

However, after the ancient era passed, the two races entered a period of rare peace. Although there were minor conflicts, it never involved the king realm experts from both sides.

The current invasion of the sea race signified that the situation on the Tianyuan continent was about to change.

Huangyu Zone, Yunqing Region, Divine Gate Holy Land.

Jun Lingtian had already returned to the Divine Gate Holy Land several months ago.

He had been investigating Qian Daoliu’s identity, and had finally found some clues with the help of the Divine Gate Holy Land.

Qian Daoliu’s main body might not be human!

It seemed that he was a member of the demon blood clan.

Members of the demon blood clan did not have a fixed form. Their true form was the blood from which their bodies were condensed. They could take on any form.

It was said that in the ancient era, when the Tianyuan continent had not been divided into territories, the demon blood clan was extremely powerful and occupied a large portion of the continent.

Their strength far exceeded that of the human race.

However, under the leadership of a human ruler, the human race dominated the Tianyuan continent within an extremely short amount of time, and became the absolute overlord of the races on the continent.

Since then, the demon blood clan had gradually disappeared without a trace.

However, they could transform into human form and hide among humans. Unless one had a powerful spiritual sense, it was almost impossible to tell the difference.

In this case, although Qian Daoliu was a human, he had been possessed by a demon blood clan expert. To be more precise, by a wisp of a demon blood clan expert’s soul.

That demonic blood clan expert’s true strength had most likely reached the king realm!

The realm above the lightning tribulation realm was the king realm.

Cultivators who survived the three tribulations passed the tests that the Heavenly Dao gave them, and would become king realm experts.

At that level, even if they did not possess spatial intent, they would be able to tear space apart and establish their own miniature world.

The size of the miniature world was relative to the strength of its creator.

The Moon Demon mystic realm was a miniature world established by the master of the Moon Demon Holy Land, though he also invited that ancient almighty expert to assist him.

After discovering Qian Daoliu’s main body’s identity, Jun Lingtian’s expression became extremely grave.

Although several months had passed, and there was no trace of Qian Daoliu’s main body, he was still uneasy.

He had not thought that they would be dealing with an existence that was likely to be a king realm expert.

Even though he had great faith in Ye Xuan, a king realm expert was something beyond their reach at the moment.

From the looks of it, they would have to rely on the power of the Divine Gate Holy Land.

Otherwise, not only would he and Zhao Yuzhen die, but the entire Nanzhou Region would also be destroyed.

At the thought of this, Jun Lingtian no longer hesitated and hurriedly contacted a certain almighty expert from the Divine Gate Holy Land.

When he had just arrived at the Divine Gate Holy Land, he had wanted to contact this person. Unfortunately, he was in secluded cultivation at the time, so he had to wait patiently.

Normally, an almighty expert like him would be in secluded cultivation for hundreds of years. Fortunately, the invasion of the sea race forced the human race’s experts to respond, and the almighty expert ended his secluded cultivation ahead of time.

After waiting some time, Jun Lingtian was summoned by that almighty expert.

“Lingtian, have you encountered some trouble?”

In a resplendent ancient hall, a black-haired old man sat cross-legged on a throne as he looked at Jun Lingtian.

Although the old man had a kind smile on his face, Jun Lingtian still felt nervous.

This old man was the ancestor of the Divine Gate Holy Land, and an extremely powerful existence. He could not afford to be the slightest bit negligent.

Jun Lingtian hurriedly recounted the entire incident.

“Mm! I understand.”

“To be so monstrous at such a young age, Ye Xuan’s background must be extraordinary. You’ve made the right choice!”

“As for the Tower of Heaven, since he has obtained it, that’s his opportunity!”

“This person is very likely blessed by fate. You must maintain a good relationship with him.”

The black-haired old man muttered to himself for a moment before he spoke.

Buzzzzzz!

At this moment, two jade tokens suddenly appeared in front of Jun Lingtian.

Jun Lingtian’s heart was filled with shock. He had not sensed any aura fluctuations just now! The ancestor was truly powerful!

These two jade tokens were the life-saving trump cards the ancestor had given him.

“Lingtian thanks Ancestor!”

Jun Lingtian accepted them with an excited expression.

Of course, he knew in his heart that one of the jade tokens was to be given to Ye Xuan.

“The appearance of the Tower of Heaven will definitely attract the covetous eyes of many experts. I will personally settle this matter!”

“You can go back now!”

Jun Lingtian bowed respectfully to the old man, and then left the ancient hall and headed for the Nanzhou Region.

Half a month later, Jun Lingtian arrived at the Qingyun sect. He originally wanted to give the jade token to Ye Xuan, but soon learned that the latter was in secluded cultivation.

Jun Lingtian thought for a moment and chose to stay in the Great Qian Dynasty to wait for Ye Xuan to end his secluded cultivation session.
