364 Do You Really Think You Can Bully My Disciple?

“Yueyue greets Teacher!”

When Zhuge Yueyue saw Ye Xuan, her face was filled with joy. Then, she quickly knelt down with a respectful expression.

“Mm! It’s been hard on you, little girl!” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Ye Xuan smiled and nodded. With a wave of his hand, a gentle force helped Zhuge Yueyue up.

He already knew about what happened just now.

Immediately, Ye Xuan looked at Gao Shun with a smile that was not a smile.

“If my ears weren’t mistaken, Senior Brother Gao wanted to teach my disciple a lesson on my behalf?”

When Gao Shun heard that, he instantly felt a little guilty.

However, he was someone who had experienced many things in life, so he reacted quickly.

“Junior Brother Ye, this girl is too arrogant and doesn’t even respect me. If I don’t teach her a lesson, she might cause problems for the sect in the future.”

“Since you were in seclusion, I decided to discipline her on your behalf.”

“Oh?” Hearing this, Ye Xuan raised his eyebrows.

“No matter what mistakes this girl has made, she’s still a member of Cloud Sky peak. It’s our peak’s business to punish or reward her. It’s not up to you.”

“Do you really think that Cloud Sky peak is so easy to mess with?”

As soon as he finished speaking, a powerful force suddenly rippled out, causing the surrounding space to distort slightly.

When Gongsun Shouyue and Gao Shun saw this, their expressions changed.

‘Oh my God! I didn’t expect Teacher’s strength to be so terrifying!’

Zhuge Yueyue’s outward expression did not change, but her heart was filled with joy.

Initially, she had the same thoughts as the other cultivators of the Great Wilderness Divine sect and believed that Ye Xuan was only a second-level divine mystic realm cultivator, despite having cultivated for a hundred years.

As such, the terrifying power that he was displaying now shocked her.

Furthermore, Ye Xuan had actually argued with Gao Shun because of her, which made her feel even more touched.

She did not expect that after losing both her parents, there was still someone who was willing to protect her sincerely.

Zhuge Yueyue’s mouth opened slightly. She wanted to persuade her teacher not to offend Gao Shun over such a small matter.

However, the words were stuck on the tip of her tongue.

When Ye Xuan revealed his power, Gongsun Shouyue looked over in surprise.

‘There seems to be a trace of immortal spiritual power in his aura. What realm has this guy reached?’

‘This is surprising. This kid is not the piece of trash that was described in the rumors. He is clearly an expert whose strength is infinitely close to the heaven realm!’

‘This kid has actually endured humiliation for a hundred years. Were it not for Zhuge Yueyue, he might not even have revealed his strength today.’

Gongsun Shouyue looked at Ye Xuan, but he did not intervene to stop the conflict between the two.

The enmity between Cloud Sky peak and Hidden Sword peak had been going on for thousands of years. Even as the sect master, he was helpless.

He could not be biased toward any side.

When Gao Shun saw the situation, his expression was incomparably livid, but he did not back down in the slightest either.

In any case, Ye Xuan’s strength was indeed beyond his expectations. At the very least, from the strength that this guy had just revealed, he was at least a void realm cultivator.

Still, that was not enough to intimidate him!

“Hmph! Junior Brother Ye, don’t forget that Zhuge Yueyue is not only a disciple of your Cloud Sky peak. She is also a cultivator of the Great Wilderness Divine sect!”

“As the law enforcing elder of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, am I not qualified to discipline her?”

Gao Shun snorted coldly, and his body also exploded with power, instantly offsetting Ye Xuan’s aura.

“Indeed, you’re the law enforcement elder!”

“However, even if you’re the law enforcement elder, you still have to follow the rules!”

Ye Xuan’s mouth curved into a cold smile. He slowly walked to the peak of the mountain, his eyes turning in the direction of Hidden Sword peak.

“Since Senior Brother Gao is the sect’s law enforcement elder, let’s talk about the rules of the Great Wilderness Divine sect.”

“What are you trying to pull?” Gao Shun’s eyes narrowed slightly, as he tried to figure out what Ye Xuan was up to.

“As the law enforcement elder of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, Senior Brother Gao is naturally very familiar with the rules of our sect. I wonder what would happen if a disciple burns, kills, plunders, and oppresses others?”

“According to the rules of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, that disciple should have their cultivation destroyed and be expelled from the sect,” Gao Shun subconsciously said.

Hearing this, the corners of Ye Xuan’s mouth curved up, and he looked at Gao Shun with a wicked smile.

When Gao Shun saw this, an ominous premonition suddenly emerged in his heart.

“Senior Brother, you’re indeed very familiar with the rules of the Great Wilderness Divine cult! However, if I remember correctly, there is a cultivator from Hidden Sword peak who not only bullies people, but also toys with women just because he has the status of a cultivator.”

“He’s such a cruel and merciless person. Shouldn’t he be punished? Shouldn’t his cultivation be abolished? Shouldn’t he be expelled from the sect?”

“Oh, hold a second! I seem to have now recalled that this disciple is Senior Brother Gao’s son, right? No wonder he managed to get off scot-free despite having committed such heinous acts.”

“It seems that Senior Brother Gao’s position as law enforcement elder is quite useful. At least for protecting your own son.”

When Zhuge Yueyue heard this, she could barely stifle a snicker.

She never expected her teacher to take this approach and use Gao Shun’s status and position against himself.

When Gao Shun heard that, his expression turned livid.

He finally realized what Ye Xuan was aiming for, but he could not refute it at all. After all, what Ye Xuan said was true.

He only had a son in his old age, so he doted on his son very much. How could he bear to punish him?

His son, Gao Tianyu, relied on his father’s position as law enforcement elder, and his own status as the successor of Hidden Sword peak to do whatever he wanted in the Great Wilderness Divine sect.

Although he did not dare to lay his hands on the female cultivators of the sect, ordinary women in the outside world were not so lucky.

Within the span of just a few months, Gao Tianyu had kidnapped many young ladies from families in the secular world. After ravaging them, he had cruelly toyed with them until they died.

In the mystic world, where the strong preyed on the weak, such things were not rare.

In the past, everyone closed one eye and pretended not to see it. After all, this guy’s father was Gao Shun, the law enforcement elder of the Great Wilderness Divine sect. Who would dare to expose him?
