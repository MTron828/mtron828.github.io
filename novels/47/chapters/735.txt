736 The Final Push

As a cultivator, it was important to always repay favors due to karma. Therefore, it was quite rare for cultivators to renege on deals or disregard favors, unless there were extenuating circumstances, or if they no longer had any chance of breaking through.

Yueyue already knew Su Changhe’s purpose for coming here, so she asked, “Where is your father? Why didn’t he come with you?”

Based on the current situation, Qingyang City was already in danger. If there was a beast invasion, Qingyang City would definitely be the first to fall.

Hearing this, Su Changhe said bitterly, “My father told me to come over and check the situation here first. He stayed back to observe and oversee things in Qingyang City. After I send word, he’ll come over.”

The disaster this time had come without warning for most, and many people simply fled with the clothes on their backs instead in panic.

After all, no one knew what other terrifying things were in that desert region, and when the whole situation would erupt. Unless they could seek refuge or join the powerful factions, the best course of action was to flee as far as possible from the border.

“Alright, you and your family can settle down on Cloud Sky peak first.”

Thankfully, after the Su family reconstructed Cloud Sky peak, there were quite a few empty buildings, which could house some of them temporarily.

Zhuge Yueyue wanted to help them settle down, but Su Changhe said, “”Sister Yueyue, there’s no need to go through so much trouble.”

“We’ve already brought our equipment. We can just set up camp outside. After all, my father specially instructed us not to disturb your cultivation.”

“We can still help you to keep an eye on the situation in the outside world, and we can even send some people to guard the gate.”

Zhuge Yueyue was stunned. It seemed that Su Changhe and Su Tianzheng had thought this through.

Indeed, it would be troublesome to settle hundreds of people on Cloud Sky peak suddenly.

After pondering for a while, Zhuge Yueyue agreed and said, “That’s fine…”

“The current situation is full of uncertainty. No one knows when the disaster will strike, so hurry up and dispatch some people to notify your father to make the journey here.”

In the past, Su Tianzheng had risked his life to save them, so how could she allow the Su family to remain in danger? They would have a much better chance at survival on Cloud Sky peak.

In any case, she was certain that her teacher would have agreed to this as well if he was here.

Thinking this, Zhuge Yueyue could not help but look at the rear of the mountain, hoping that her teacher would break through soon.

At this moment, Ye Xuan, who was in the Cloud Sky Cave, suddenly opened his eyes.

Then, the entire Cloud Sky Cave began to shake.

Ye Xuan clenched his fist lightly, and energy began to condense on his palm, which exuded a terrifying aura.

After a long period of cultivation, Ye Xuan’s body refining cultivation had reached the peak of the supreme realm.

“Haha, it is no wonder no one else is willing to focus on body refining cultivation. Even with the help of this immortal heavenly treasure, it actually took me several months to reach the peak of the supreme realm.”

“Well, not that I’ve reached the peak of the supreme realm in both spiritual and body refining cultivation, it’s time to break through to the ancient realm.

Then, Ye Xuan suddenly noticed a stone emitting a rainbow-colored light at the edge of the pool. He could even sense the aura of life from it.

“Eh… What is this?” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Ye Xuan was dumbfounded. He had been busy cultivating for a while and had not noticed this rainbow-colored stone at all.

After carefully examining it, Ye Xuan discovered that this rainbow-colored Stone contained an immense amount of spiritual energy.

It seemed that when he was cultivating, the spiritual energy that overflowed from his body was absorbed by this stone.

At this moment, his curiosity was piqued. Could it be that some sort of life form was germinating in this rainbow stone.

However, after carefully examining it, Ye Xuan did not make any new discoveries. In any case, now was not the time to be distracted, therefore, he put it back in its original place.

Then, Ye Xuan closed his eyes tightly and began to mobilize the spiritual power, preparing to break through to the ancient realm.

A huge spiritual sea had already condensed in Ye Xuan’s dantian, and Great Dao Flowers appeared one after another.

As long as he had enough Great Dao Flowers, he would be able to break through.

A faint mark seemed to have appeared on Ye Xuan’s forehead.

This was a mark that only ancient realm experts possessed. As Ye Xuan had yet to successfully enter the Eternal Realm, it was still a little blurry. However, the general shape could already be seen.

“Break!”

After shouting angrily, Ye Xuan suddenly mobilized his strength and launched a fierce charge to break through.

As his spiritual power smashed against the realm barrier, Ye Xuan’s body seemed to be torn apart. It was exceptionally painful.

However, Ye Xuan remained completely focused.

Powerful energy fluctuations shook the Cloud Sky Cave. At a critical moment, a purple crystal appeared above his head, and the steady stream of power it exuded was absorbed by Ye Xuan.

At this moment, Ye Xuan could already sense that the energy stored in his body was about to reach its limit. All he needed was one last step to break through to the ancient realm.

Ye Xuan was starting to get excited. The moment he had been waiting for was finally within his grasp.

He focused his attention on maintaining a steady flow of spiritual power to assault the realm barrier. More than 10 days passed in the blink of an eye, and he had now reached the final juncture. There was no room for any carelessness.

“It’s time!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan activated the fate energy within his body. Then, his body released dazzling divine light, and the realm barrier also loosened…
