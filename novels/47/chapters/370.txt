371 Li Xue’Er

She then mumbled to herself again, “Mother told me that controlling the kitchen is the same as controlling a man’s stomach, which is also the same as grasping his heart.”

“That’s why she was very strict while teaching me how to cook. She said that it would be convenient for me to cook for my sweetheart in the future.”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan was stunned, and the corners of his mouth curved up.

“It seems that you have learned quite a lot of things. In any case, since you are so skilled, how about you take care of our three meals on Cloud Sky peak in the future?”

“That way, you can practice your cooking skills and improve them alongside your cultivation.”

He did not expect the disciple he had randomly picked out to not only awaken the profound ice divine bone, but also have such good cooking skills.

‘Hehe! Blissful days await me in the future.’

When Zhuge Yueyue heard that, she was happy that Ye Xuan had recognized her cooking skills. It seemed that all that cooking training had been worth it.

“As long as Teacher likes it, I’ll make food for you every day in the future. Besides, I still have many dishes that I haven’t shown you yet!”

“En!” Ye Xuan nodded.

He didn’t know how many dishes this girl knew how to cook, but he was looking forward to it., but he wasn’t in a hurry. There was plenty of time later.

“Alright! Let’s hurry up and eat, we still have to wake up early to cultivate tomorrow!”

“Yes, yes!”

After that, Zhuge Yueyue also started to eat.

After all, she had been cultivating on the peak all day and had long needed to eat to replenish her energy.

After dinner, Zhuge Yueyue tidied up the utensils and returned to her room to sleep.

The next morning, she woke up, stretched lazily, and then walked out.

After yesterday’s rest and consolidation, Zhuge Yueyue had stabilized her control of her newfound strength.

Now, she was already a first-level divine mystic realm cultivator in name and reality!

Zhuge Yueyue looked at Ye Xuan’s room and realized that the door was not open.

“Could it be that Teacher is not up yet?”

Zhuge Yueyue did not make any further guesses. She went straight to the kitchen to prepare breakfast.

It was not until the sun was high in the sky that Zhuge Yueyue finished preparing breakfast. She was about to go to Ye Xuan’s room to wake him up when…

Suddenly, she saw a bright light flash across the sky. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

When Zhuge Yueyue saw this, her eyes darkened.

Someone had come to Cloud Sky peak again. Was it Gao Shun?

At this moment, the bright light got closer to Cloud Sky peak. Then, a beautiful woman in a red robe revealed herself.

Then, she suddenly realized that there was a young lady behind the lady in red.

“Xue’er…”

Zhuge Yueyue immediately recognized the young lady. She was Li Xue’er, who had been in the same village as her and had joined the Great Wilderness Divine sect at the same time after the beast attack.

They were also best friends who grew up together.

However, Zhuge Yueyue had not seen Li Xue’er after leaving the meeting hall that day.

“Yueyue, I’ve missed you so much!”

Li Xue’er’s face was filled with joy when she saw Zhuge Yueyue. She immediately pounced on her.

Zhuge Yueyue did not resist at all. The two of them hugged each other happily.

After the beast attack, the two of them could be said to have experienced life and death together. Now that they met again, they were naturally extremely happy.

“Xue’er, why are you here at Cloud Sky peak?”

After a short hug, Zhuge Yueyue asked.

“I begged Teacher to bring me here!”

Li Xue’er pointed at the woman in red behind them.

When Zhuge Yueyue heard this, she quickly turned around to look at the woman in red. She felt that she was somewhat familiar.

It seemed that this woman in red had chosen Li Xue’er as her disciple back in the meeting hall that day.

She suddenly remembered that Hua Rufeng had told them that this lady in red was one of the seven chiefs of the Great Wilderness Divine sect. The peak she was in charge of only accepted female cultivators, and its name was Water Sky peak.

The red-robed lady’s name was Yuelun.

She was a peerless beauty with a graceful figure and an amiable personality.

“Greetings, Martial Aunt Yuelun!”

Zhuge Yueyue hurriedly bowed with respect.

As a junior, she had to pay her respects to her elders. Moreover, she was the eldest disciple of Cloud Sky peak, so she had to maintain decorum.

When Yuelun saw this, she smiled and nodded her head. A hint of guilt flashed across the depths of her eyes.

In fact, back in the meeting hall that day, Yuelun had wanted to choose both of them.

However, Zhuge Yueyue’s talent was too mediocre. Besides, she did not want to take in so many disciples. After thinking about it, she only decided to take Li Xue’er with her.

Yuelun had then felt a little guilty when she noticed Li Xue’er’s lonely and helpless appearance. However, just as Yuelun was about to accept Zhuge Yueyue as a servant disciple, Ye Xuan appeared.

Even though Cloud Sky peak was rather dilapidated, it was still better than being a servant disciple.

Yuelun flicked her sleeve and a gentle wave of energy pulled Zhuge Yueyue up.

“Martial Niece, you don’t have to be so polite. I came to Cloud Sky peak because Xue’er kept talking about you. She said that if she didn’t see you, she wouldn’t be able to concentrate on her cultivation.”

“It just so happens that I had nothing to do today, so I brought this little girl over. You two can have a good chat with each other.”

When Zhuge Yueyue heard that, she was surprised.

She missed Li Xue’er as well, which was normal. After all, they had gone through life and death together and both their families were gone. She was the closest thing to family she still had.

At this moment, Li Xue’er looked at Yuelun.

“Teacher, didn’t you promise me that you’d take Yueyue back to Water Sky peak?”

Although she had just joined the Great Wilderness Divine sect, Li Xue’er had heard a lot about Ye Xuan.

Li Xue’er could not bear to see her best friend remain on the most desolate peak of the Great Wilderness Divine sect. Therefore, she had been coaxing and pestering Yuelun for the past few days.

Yuelun had a soft heart and eventually agreed.

Immediately, Yuelun looked at Zhuge Yueyue with a smile.

“You’re being overly anxious, Xue’er. We have to see how well she is doing here first.”

Zhuge Yueyue’s expression changed when she heard this.

“What? Xue’er, did you come here to take me to the Water Sky peak?”

Li Xue’er came to Zhuge Yueyue’s side and whispered, “Yueyue, this is the result of me coaxing and pestering Teacher for a few days.”

“Teacher is a fifth-level heaven realm cultivator. If you join the Water Sky peak with me, you will definitely be able to become a cultivator in the future.”

“Yueyue, I’ve heard a lot of news these days. It’s said that your teacher is only a second-level divine mystic realm cultivator. His own cultivation is limited, so how can he teach you?”

“If you continue to stay on Cloud Sky peak, you won’t be able to get stronger.”
