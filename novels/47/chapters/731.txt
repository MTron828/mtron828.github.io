732 Heaven Realm

“Master Su, we have to hurry. Otherwise, when the danger arrives, there won’t be a chance to escape,” the butler said nervously.

Thank you readers! Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Hearing this, Su Tiansheng nodded and said, “Alright, I understand. Let’s wait for Changhe to send word first.”

“Tell the clansmen to pack their luggage first. When we’re ready, we’ll set off immediately.”

At this moment, in the main hall of the main peak.

“A terrifying skeleton?”

!!

Ao Lei was muttering to himself. The document in his hand described in detail the skeleton incident in the desert region that had taken place a few days ago.

After learning that this terrifying skeleton might have reached the ancient realm, he nervously looked toward Cloud Sky peak. If Ye Xuan could break through and reach the ancient realm in time, then their chances of surviving this disaster would be much higher.

“Senior Brother Ao, although we haven’t really started recruiting disciples, the entrance is already filled with people. It’s so crowded that we can barely make our way though when counting them.”

“Some are here to participate in the assessment, while others want to become vassals of our sect to escape the disaster.”

“Should we start the recruitment in advance?”

The one who spoke was Gao Shun. Over the past few days, he had been so busy that he could not even squeeze in a moment of cultivation time.

This was because Ao Lei needed his assistance, and he was the law enforcement elder, so he definitely had to do his part.

After thinking for a moment, Ao Lei waved his hand and said, “There’s no need for that. The recruitment of disciples should still be held according to the original schedule. There’s no need to push it forward.”

“Rufeng…”

After calling Hua Rufeng over, Ao Lei instructed him, “Go and inform the chiefs of each peak that the disciple recruitment will be held in 30 days.”

“Got it.”

After bowing respectfully, Hua Rufeng left the main hall and went to inform the other chiefs.

Ao Lei then turned his gaze to Gao Shun and said, “Junior Brother Gao, I’ll leave the assessment to you. ”

“Alright, don’t worry. Leave it to me.”

After sending Gao Shun off, he also left the main hall. His figure flashed and he already appeared in the sky above Cloud Sky peak.

When he saw that the Cloud Sky peak had already activated its defensive formation, and saw the faint purple light at the rear of the mountain, he sighed.

“Junior Brother Ye, we’ll have to rely on you to ensure the survival of the sect.”

Seconds later, a loud sound was heard from the rear of the mountain, and Zhuge Yueyue walked out of a cultivation room while stretching

After sensing Zhuge Yueyue’s aura, Feng Xiyun and Xiang Yun rushed over.

“First Sister, have you reached the heavenly realm?”

She could clearly sense that the aura her senior sister exuded was much stronger than before.

Zhuge Yueyue also fiddled around with the power in her body and felt very happy.

“Yes, I’ve reached the early stage of the heaven realm.”

Zhuge Yueyue was very satisfied with this result, as the increase in strength would help her deal with the upcoming crisis. Moreover, she could now use the powerful killing move that her teacher had taught her.

“Alright, did anything else happen while I was in seclusion?” she asked after familiarizing herself with her newfound strength.

As she was afraid that Cloud Sky peak would be attacked while she was in secluded cultivation, so she left the moment she completed her breakthrough.

If she chose to continue cultivating, she would probably be able to reach the middle stage of the heaven realm. After all, he had also obtained a lot of fate energy from the gathering and Ye Xuan, which had benefited her a lot.

Even though she had been eliminated, the residual fate energy was still substantial.

Feng Xiyun’s expression was not too good at this moment. She said, “Something has indeed happened. First Sister, let’s return to the Cloud Sky Palace and talk about it in detail.”

Hearing this, Zhuge Yueyue frowned. She had a bad feeling about this.

After a while, they returned to the Cloud Sky Palace. Before Zhuge Yuey ue could ask, Feng Xiyun told her about everything that had happened in the East continent, especially about the huge skeleton.

This left Zhuge Yueyue flustered. How was she supposed to deal with a possibly ancient realm skeleton? Her joy from breaking through dissipated.

“If I’m not wrong, the disaster that Teacher mentioned is coming soon,” Zhuge Yueyue said with a pale face. She remembered what Ye Xuan had specially told her before she went into seclusion.

Once this terrifying skeleton appeared again, what sort of destruction and chaos would it wreak?

It was hard to predict.

Just as the two of them were still worrying about the situation, Hua Rufeng arrived.

“Junior Sister Zhuge, I’m Senior Brother Hua. Can you open a small hole in the formation to let me in?”

Hearing this, Zhuge Yueyue immediately exited the Cloud Sky Palace and saw Hua Rufeng, who was frozen in place, surrounded by a large number of illusory swords.

“Senior Brother Hua, why are you here today?”

After seeing his predicament, she could not help but chuckle.Then, she waved her hand and opened an entrance for Hua Rufeng to enter.

Hua Rufeng turned around in fear when he stepped inside. He looked at the formation behind him in fear.
