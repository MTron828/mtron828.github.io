Was it impossible to change the fate of Hidden Sword Peak and Cloud Sky peak?

Gao Shun’s heart was filled with complicated feelings.

No one would have thought that Ye Xuan had hidden himself so deeply. No one would have thought that a piece of trash without a divine bone would have the Dao body and even hide in the Great Wilderness Divine sect for a hundred years.

After all, no matter how much humiliation Ye Xuan had suffered in the past hundred years, he had never reciprocated.

That in itself was a terrifying feat.

Had he revealed his Dao body, the Great Wilderness Divine sect would not have hesitated to pour all of their cultivation resources into him.

Yet, this fellow had chosen to hide it.

Suddenly, Gongsun Shouyue understood.

It was easy for geniuses to fall. Before one had absolute strength, showing off one’s talent too early would only bring about disaster, and make one a target.

The best way was to keep a low profile and accumulate strength.

At this moment, within the spiritual energy vortex, Ye Xuan’s eyes were tightly shut. The chaos heart technique was constantly being circulated.

Then, his eyes suddenly opened, and a bright divine light flashed within the depths of his pupils, following which, a terrifying aura swept out toward everyone present.

“Not good! Hurry up and leave this place!”

Yuelun saw this and hurriedly retreated with Li Hanyi.

Ye Xuan was a mystic lord realm expert. Those weaker than him would be injured by this aura, or even killed.

Fortunately, Gongsun Shouyue was at the peak of the mystic lord realm. With a wave of his sleeve, an ancient stone pagoda suddenly appeared and enveloped Ye Xuan.

It suppressed the aura that Ye Xuan was exuding.

After absorbing this vast power, Ye Xuan’s cultivation broke through again and reached the middle-stage of the mystic lord realm.

As one’s cultivation realm increased, the difficulty of breaking through would also increase.

Therefore, even if Ye Xuan gained a hundred times more benefits than Hua Rufeng from the epiphany, he could only improve his cultivation by one minor realm.

However, this was already a significant strength increase.

After the breakthrough, Ye Xuan’s eyes shone with light, and his entire body rose into the air. A mysterious aura rippled around him, and Ye Xuan activated the Boundless Palm technique.

Although he had the help of the system, Ye Xuan had basically comprehended the core of the technique, he was still one step away from completely mastering it.

The current state of epiphany was undoubtedly the best opportunity.

Then, as everyone watched, Ye Xuan condensed a giant hand in the sky, which created spatial ripples.

When everyone saw this, they were shocked.

This palm technique contained terrifying and overbearing power. When it rippled slightly, it had the power to shatter mountains and seas. It was as if everything in the world was held within that palm.

When Gongsun Shouyue saw this, his pupils shrank. His eyes were filled with shock as he spoke with a trembling voice.

“This… This is an immortal-grade divine power…”

“What?” Everyone’s eyes widened in shock.

Even an ancient sect like the Great Wilderness Divine sect did not have an immortal-grade divine power.

The strongest divine power the sect had was a heaven-grade one, and only the sect master was qualified to cultivate it.

Yet Ye Xuan’s palm technique had actually exceeded this.

“Senior Brother, are you sure? Is that really an immortal-grade divine power?”

Yuelun’s eyes were filled with disbelief.

“I’m certain!” Gongsun Shouyue nodded solemnly.

“I cultivate the Great Wilderness technique, so I am naturally familiar with the power of heaven-grade divine powers. However, compared to what Junior Brother Ye has practiced, it’s clearly lacking!”

“Only a legendary immortal-grade divine power can display such profound strength.”

“I didn’t expect Junior Brother Ye’s talent to be so monstrous. Not only does he have the Dao body, but also an immortal-grade divine power.” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

There were strict requirements for such divine powers, not only in terms of comprehension, but also talent.

Even Gongsun Shouyue could not guarantee that he would succeed in cultivating it.

After 60 minutes passed, Ye Xuan stopped, and the swirling power in the sky slowly dissipated.

At this moment, he had completely mastered the essence of the Boundless Palm technique.

Ye Xuan’s lips curved into a beautiful arc.

Finally, after the Flora Sword technique, he comprehended another immortal-grade divine power.

Although this palm technique did not have the terrifying power of the Flora Sword technique, it had greater controlling and restraining abilities.

Ye Xuan slowly descended from the sky. His white clothes fluttered in the wind, and his every movement was elegant.

“Hahaha! Congratulations, Junior Brother Ye! You comprehended an immortal-grade divine power and achieved a breakthrough in your cultivation. It is truly a blessing for the Great Wilderness Divine sect!”

“It seems that there is hope for the rise of the Great Wilderness Divine sect!”

Gongsun Shouyue quickly went up to congratulate Ye Xuan with a smile.

He had to admit that Ye Xuan had indeed brought him countless surprises today.

“Senior Brother Gongsun is too kind. I was just lucky just now,” Ye Xuan said lightly.

He also noticed Gao Shun’s ugly expression, which made him feel great.

This feeling of showing off in front of so many people was really the best.

...

“Senior Brother Gao, what’s up with your expression? Are you feeling unwell?” Ye Xuan asked, despite knowing the answer.

When Gao Shun heard this, his face turned even more livid.

“Pfft!”

When Yuelun saw this, she stifled her laughter.

She naturally knew that Ye Xuan had said that on purpose. After all, Gao Shun had confidently stated that Ye Xuan could not enter the state of epiphany earlier.

However, he had now been blinded by reality. Furthermore, he had also comprehended an immortal-grade divine power while doing so.
