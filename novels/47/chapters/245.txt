Chapter 246: Worry

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Even if we didn’t make a move, Qian Daoliu would not have been able to escape Brother Ye’s grasp either.”

Jun Lingtian smiled.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan did not comment.

His spatial intent was indeed powerful. However, even Ye Xuan could not guarantee that he could confine all of the blood-red droplets.

Therefore, Jun Lingtian and Zhao Yu’s actions had undoubtedly helped him.

“I’m sure Brother Ye also heard it. Before Qian Daoliu died, he said that this was only his clone,” Jun Lingtian said with a grave expression.

“En!” Ye Xuan nodded.

“If Brother Ye needs anything, you can contact me at any time. Qian Daoliu’s main body is likely to be very powerful. Brother Ye might not be able to deal with him alone!”

He really valued Ye Xuan and wanted to build a good relationship with him.

His grandfather had once told him that cultivators with monstrous talent were blessed by the heavens, and to become good friends with such people.

The Divine Gate Holy Land had operated on that principle for tens of thousands of years.

“In that case, thanks in advance!”

Ye Xuan cupped his fists at Jun Lingtian.

At least for now, the two of them gave him a pretty good feeling.

“In that case, we’ll take our leave first.”

Jun Lingtian and Zhao Yuzhen smiled, and then said goodbye to Ye Xuan.

Although their assistance had been largely unnecessary, they had at least achieved their goal of initiating a friendly relationship with Ye Xuan.

“Take care, you two.” Ye Xuan nodded.

Immediately, Jun Lingtian and Zhao Yuzhen tore space apart and stepped into the spatial crack.

“I’ll be going to the Yunqing Region soon.”

Jun Lingtian glanced at Zhao Yuzhen, who was standing beside him.

“Are you going back to the Divine Gate Holy Land?”

Zhao Yuzhen looked at Jun Lingtian meaningfully.

“En!”

To Zhao Yuzhen’s surprise, Jun Lingtian did not deny it.

The Yunqing Region was one of the most powerful regions in the Huangyu Zone, and was under the control of one super force, which was the Divine Gate Holy Land.

“I was quite suspicious of Qian Daoliu’s origins before, but the Blood Moon Temple was a force native to the Nanzhou Region, so I did not dig too deeply into it.”

“Actually, were it not for Qian Daoliu, the Blood Moon Temple would not even be considered a super force here.”

“I have to return to the Divine Gate Holy Land to investigate Qian Daoliu’s main body’s identity,” Jun Lingtian said with a grave expression.

If he could not figure out the extent of the threat they were facing, then the Nanzhou Region would be in grave danger in the future.

“Because of Ye Xuan, we’ve made an unknown terrifying enemy. Do you think it’s worth it?”

Zhao Yuzhen asked after hesitating for a while.

What if the other party was a mighty figure who dominated the Huangyu Zone? Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Hearing this, Jun Lingtian remained silent for a moment before speaking.

“No matter what the outcome is, we have already made our choice. There is no way out!”

“A monster like Ye Xuan is blessed by great fortune. Even if Qian Daoliu’s main body were to appear right now, he might not be able to kill him!

“However, you and I need to worry about our safety.”

Zhao Yuzhen’s expression changed when he heard this.

With his current strength, he could not even beat the clone, much less the main body.

“Brother Zhao, if you’re willing, we can travel together. Otherwise, you’d better hide for the time being!”

Jun Lingtian said while looking at Zhao Yuzhen.

Zhao Yuzhen was silent, his expression uncertain.

Jun Lingtian did not rush him.

After all, it was related to his own life and death, so it was better for Zhao Yuzhen to make his own choice.

Jun Lingtian could not help but sigh deeply at the thought of this.

He did not know if his offer to help Ye Xuan was a blessing or a curse.

The Divine Gate Holy Land was indeed very strong, but if Qian Daoliu’s main body was strong enough to crush the entire Huangyu Zone, then what would they do?

As soon as this thought surfaced in his mind, a sense of unease suddenly welled up in Jun Lingtian’s heart.

If this tiny possibility really turned out to be true, then his actions would have invited disaster upon the Divine Gate Holy Land.

Just like that, the two of them moved forward through the spatial passage, each occupied by their own thoughts.

…

Just after Jun Lingtian and Zhao Yuzhen left, Ye Xuan left the chaotic space and examined the spot where the Qingyun sect had once stood. In its place was the Tower of Heaven.

During this time, the reappearance of the Tower of Heaven had spread throughout the entire Great Qian Dynasty, and even to parts of the Nanzhou Region.

There were countless cultivators who had entered the Moon Demon mystic realm before, so they could naturally recognize the Tower of Heaven.

Its appearance outside the mystic realm could only mean one thing..

Ye Xuan had obtained ownership of the Tower of Heaven!

This matter caused a great stir in the Nanzhou Region.
