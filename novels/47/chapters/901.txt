902 Killing Seven

Although she was facing a powerful enemy, Yanran did not have any intention of retreating at this moment. She spoke with a cold expression.

“You are really annoying. Even if your strength has completely recovered, so what? Since you dared to come to my world and cause trouble, I will kill you.”

As soon as she finished speaking, Yanran’s eyes closed tightly and her body released an even more dazzling seven-colored light. At this moment, a huge door gradually appeared in the sky.

The Great Desolate technique was pushed to its limits, and a terrifying aura began to surge from her body.

The moment Yanran opened her eyes, she underwent a transformation. It seemed that she was no longer a sealed immortal realm expert, but an eternal realm expert!

Hiss!

“She reached the eternal realm?”

At this moment, Ou Yunhai was completely dumbfounded. He could clearly feel that the aura released by Yanran was still transforming as waves of immortal energy filled the air.

At this moment, Yanran had become a true immortal!

Her eyes seemed to contain the crystallization of ten thousand years of ice, and were almost devoid of any emotion.

With a casual swing, she unleashed a huge vortex, which instantly engulfed the surroundings.

Sensing the power of this attack, Shan Shui was in disbelief.

“This… This cannot be happening! How did you break through”

Yanran completely ignored him. Instead, she mobilized her full strength and pulled the remaining five experts into the vortex.

What was she trying to do? Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Was she trying to kill all five of them at once? That was preposterous, right?

At this moment, everyone from the Great Wilderness Divine sect was very nervous. Zhuge Yueyue briefly glanced at the Cloud Heaven Sword she was holding, and then threw it toward Yanran.

“Teacher’s wife, take this sword and use it first.”

Hearing this, Yanran instantly turned around and caught the Cloud Heaven Sword. She smiled a little happily after being addressed as such.

At this moment, she was thinking to herself, ‘If I can kill all seven of them, my achievement will eclipse his, right?’

After all, Ye Xuan had only killed a clone of a true immortal back then, but now she had killed seven of their true bodies!

Even though these seven might not be as strong as the golden furred growler ancestor, the numbers more than made up for it!

She would eclipse him for once!

After that, he would have to call her senior sister!

Although these thoughts ran through her mind, it did not hinder her combat awareness, as she unleashed a fierce attack!

“Break!”

After saying this, the Cloud Heaven Sword released a sharp sword beam, which was imbued with the power of the Great Desolate technique, which swept toward the five experts.

Boom!

The entire sky shook as the terrifying sword beam seemed to split the world in half. Giant waves crashed over the East Sea, and spatial cracks appeared in the sky.

On the receiving end of things, Shan Shui was hysterically trying to block the sword beam.

“This isn’t real!”

“How could I be defeated? We have to block it!”

Even though he was already struggling desperately, he and the others were trapped in the vortex, and they could not escape at all. As such, they could only mobilize their strength in a desperate attempt to withstand the sword beam.

Alas, it was to no avail.

Moments later, a giant blood mist spread out in the air and covered the East Sea, dyeing half of it red.

Below the ancient palace, a little furry monkey could only hide himself tightly, his body constantly trembling.

“Oh my god, who are these people and why are they so terrifying? I have to hide properly.”

Wukong was both fearful and confused. He had only unsealed this ancient palace, yet why had it attracted so many experts?

Furthermore, so many of these experts were terrifyingly powerful!

If he showed himself now, he would probably be finished in an instant.

After pondering the matter, Wu Kong decided that the dangers inside were more manageable than the dangers outside. He instantly used a secret technique to tear open a hole in the seal of the ancient palace and hide inside.

As for those outside the ancient palace, they did not know that this little furry monkey hiding in the ancient palace would soon cause a terrifying disaster.

They were all watching dumbfounded as the five lightning tiger experts were turned into mists of blood.

However, Yanran was not in a good state either. After a moment of silence, she instantly spat out a mouthful of blood and staggered backward.

Zhuge Yueyue hurried over and supported her. She asked with concern, “Teacher’s wife, are you alright?”

She had already acknowledged Yanran due to her actions. This beautiful lady had stepped in to save both her and Xiyun, and risked her life to kill those seven experts.

Perhaps if her teacher did not approve, she and Xiyun would have to think of ways to matchmake them. After all, she judged Yanran worthy of being with Ye Xuan.

Of course, Ye Xuan was not aware of their thoughts. Yanran, on the other hand, was basking in the joy of being called Ye Xuan’s wife, smiling happily.
