791 Explosion!!!

Heavenly King Li laughed evilly. Then, a black lotus bloomed under his feet, releasing a terrifying aura.

“You’re so funny. Do you really think I have so few trump cards?”

“Not only do I have the Soul Beckoning Banner, but with the help of this black lotus, even if the great demon in the desert region comes here, she won’t be able to do anything to me, let alone you!”

“Haha, is that so?”

Ye Xuan laughed out loud. He could tell that the black lotus beneath Heavenly King Li’s feet was indeed extraordinary, but it was not originally black.

It seemed that under the influence of the strange power, and after being refined by their so-called master, this lotus became a black lotus.

“How interesting. Your artifact is pretty decent, so I won’t hold back.”

The corners of Ye Xuan’s mouth curled up slightly. He was just worrying about not having good treasures to give away to obtain the system’s rewards, but Heavenly King Li had now delivered one to his doorstep.

As long as he cleansed this lotus properly, it could still be restored to its original form. Since it was likely that he would be able to meet Yanran again soon, perhaps he could give it to her as a reunion gift.

Then. Ye Xuan swung the Godsword at Heavenly King Li, and bolts of divine lightning descended in tandem with his swing.

Heavenly King Li’s body trembled. He did not dare to be careless and used the Soul Beckoning Banner to defend himself. Furthermore, the lotus below his feet released black energy that condensed into a barrier around him.

Bang!

The black barrier was instantly shattered into pieces.

“Wha?!”

The seven strange monsters all felt a sense of deep lingering fear, and could not help but take a few steps back.

Heavenly King Li’s face was completely drained of blood. He had never expected that even with the help of two powerful artifacts, he would not be able to withstand Ye Xuan’s sword strike.

Seeing that Ye Xuan was still closing in, his eyes were filled with fear.

“Damn it! I’ll hold him back. If you have the chance, escape!.”

Since things had already developed to this point, Heavenly King Li had no choice but to make a decision. The other six strange monsters did not know what to say.

They did not really have any deep feelings toward each other, but it seemed that Heavenly King Li had decided that a sacrifice was necessary if even one of them was to escape.

“Did I say you could leave?”

By this time, Ye Xuan had already charged over, and Heavenly King Li had no choice but to meet him head-on, trying to use the lotus under his feet and the Soul Beckoning Banner to restrain Ye Xuan.

Ye Xuan disregarded him and casually blocked his attack with the Godsword. Still, he managed to hold Ye Xuan back somewhat.

“Hurry up and leave!”

Seeing that Heavenly King Li and Ye Xuan were temporarily tied down, North Heavenly King found an opportunity and quickly left.

The remaining five strange monsters instantly scattered and fled.

After seeing this situation, Ye Xuan forced Heavenly King Li back, summoned the Cloud Heaven Sword, and immediately used the Heaven-Splitting Sword technique to kill one of the fleeing strange monsters.

“Hahaha! One down, six to go!”

With a casual wave of his hand, the Cloud Heaven Sword reappeared in his hand. He stared at the fleeing strange monsters with a cold expression.

In the blink of an eye, he struck again, killing the strange monster that was the furthest away. Had it not been for Heavenly King Li’s interference, he would have been able to kill the others in quick succession.

Witnessing all of this, Heavenly King Li became even more furious. He said fiercely, “Damned human! How dare you!”

“I was born daring,” Ye Xuan replied casually. Heavenly King Li rushed over again, unleashing a terrifying attack that caused space to begin to shatter.

Ye Xuan swung the Godsword in response, chopping off his attacker’s left hand. Heavenly King Li spat out a few mouthfuls of black blood in quick succession. It was obvious that he had suffered serious injuries.

However, when he noticed that the remaining three strange monsters were still not far enough away, he felt very hopeless.

“This person’s combat strength is monstrous. If I don’t kill him, our strange world won’t be able to conquer this world.”

Thinking this, Heavenly King Li became crazier and crazier. He laughed out loud.

“Hehehe…”

Hearing his cold laughter, Ye Xuan was puzzled.

Had this guy gone crazy?

Ancient realm experts were supposed to have excellent mental fortitude, right?

Oh no!

Just as Ye Xuan was deep in thought, he suddenly sensed that there was an extremely terrifying and strange power in Heavenly King Li’s body that was about to explode.

F*ck!

Ye Xuan’s expression changed drastically.

Heavenly King Li, on the other hand, charged toward Ye Xuan with everything he had. He hugged Ye Xuan tightly and shouted hysterically, “I’m taking you down with me!”

In an instant, an extremely terrifying power erupted, and even space fluctuated violently. This power even contained a trace of Heavenly King Li’s master’s aura, and was more powerful than the full-strength attack of a sealed immortal realm expert. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Not only that, the spatial crack formed by the explosion would even pull Ye Xuan into the void!
