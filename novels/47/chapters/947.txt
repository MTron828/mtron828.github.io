948 Secrets Within The Palace

After all, there were so many onlookers here. If he really wanted to show it to her, it had to be in a private place. This girl was really too innocent and pure.

After laughing awkwardly a few times, Ye Xuan moved closer to Yanran’s ear and whispered, “Yanran, my staff is really too amazing. I can’t let others see it.” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“If you really want to see it that much, come to my room and I’ll definitely give it some thought.”

Ye Xuan had already said it very bluntly, but Yanran still did not comprehend the meaning of his words and looked dazed.

She looked around and said with a puzzled expression, “Is the treasure you mentioned really that special? You’re actually afraid of it being seen by others?”

After thinking for a moment, Yanran decided not to push the matter. Since Ye Xuan said it was too valuable to take out in public, then it was best to keep the matter under wraps.

However, she was still curious about it, as Ye Xuan had not hesitated to take out things like immortal heavenly treasures and powerful spiritual artifacts before. This thing had to be quite special indeed.

Because of this, Yanran said, “Alright, but when there’s a chance, you must take it out and let me take a good look at it.”

Ye Xuan had unwittingly piqued Yanran’s interest. She had seen a lot of things since she was born, but she had never heard of such a strange thing that could change its size at will.

“Haha…”

Seeing Yanran’s serious expression, Ye Xuan laughed awkwardly.

He wondered what she would do if he really showed it to her.

“Fine, fine. If you really want to see it that badly, I’ll take it out for you to see even if I have to risk my life. You can even play around with it if you want.”

Ye Xuan said seriously.

Hearing this, Yanran’s heart skipped a beat. Was this treasure really that amazing that he had to risk his life in order to take it out?

She felt even more curious now. This had to be an extremely rare peerless treasure.

Just as the pair were conversing enthusiastically, the Thunder-Devouring Beast slowly approached them.

“Big Brother, Sister-in-law…”

Hearing him suddenly say something, Ye Xuan was shocked and rolled his eyes at him unhappily.

“What’s the matter now?”

Hearing the displeasure in Ye Xuan’s words, the Thunder-Devouring Beast became nervous. What had it done wrong?

He could only stammer, “I just got overheard a piece of information from the others”

“Oh? What information?”

Ye Xuan frowned as he looked around, He realized that everyone had already left.

After all, the ancient palace had just opened, and there were many treasures inside. How could people bear to stay here and gossip instead of searching for treasures?

At this moment, the Thunder-Devouring Beast replied, “I just heard an old man say that there seems to be a strange domain above the ancient palace, and the domain contained countless treasures. It seems to be the treasury of the ancient palace’s owner!”

“Most of them have already rushed over there. Should we go as well?”

After hearing this, Ye Xuan’s expression became much more serious as he asked, “You have been living in this ancient palace all this while. Shouldn’t you know where the treasures are hidden?”

The Thunder-Devouring Beast became sheepish when he heard this question, and stammered as he replied, “Uh… Actually… Big Brother, I won’t hide it from you. I really don’t know.”

Hearing his answer, Ye Xuan was speechless. However, after thinking about it seriously, he felt that this was quite normal.

Perhaps this fellow had been hiding in one place since he was born. After all, he had been guarding the immortal heavenly treasure for a long time, so it was unlikely that the Thunder-Devouring Beast explored the ancient palace.

However, before Ye Xuan could speak, Yanran said with a puzzled expression, “Treasury? Could it really be left behind by the owner of the ancient palace?”

“It should be. According to my understanding, this ancient palace has existed since ancient times. From what remains of my memories, I recall that the owner of this ancient palace is an extremely terrifying figure.”

“The mention of his name would make people panic and turn pale with fright.”

“Back then, when my father was about to die, he sealed me and paid a huge price to send me into this ancient palace.”

“There were other divine beasts sent inside here as well. I am not the only one. However, because they were all sent to different areas, we’ve never met each other.”

Hearing the Thunder-Devouring Beast’s words, Ye Xuan and Yanran exchanged glances. Their eyes were filled with questions.

In that chaotic era, what was it that made these big shots send their descendants into this ancient palace? Ye Xuan guessed that it was done in order to preserve their bloodline and prevent their races from going extinct.

Sorry for the inconvenience. Thank you very much!

In that case, what disaster had befallen them to force these peerless experts to make such a decision?

Unable to think of a reason, Ye Xuan could only bury the matter in his heart and did not ask the Thunder-Devouring Beast. It was likely that this fellow did not know anything about the matter.
