After a long internal struggle, Yuelun could only look at Ye Xuan and say, “This chiliad gold vine is really too valuable to give to me.”

“Junior Brother, you don’t have to give me such a precious treasure. If you really want to give me something, you can choose something more ordinary.”

“Nonsense, how can I give you something ordinary? This chiliad gold vine is a perfect match for you,” Ye Xuan retorted with a smile. The gentleness in his words had already made Yuelun unconsciously shudder.

Oh… Was she already moved?

‘This little rascal, did he know that she couldn’t handle this, which is why he was saying these things?’

However, after seeing Ye Xuan’s sincere expression, many words were suddenly stuck in her heart, and she was at a loss. She was feeling extremely touched, and had not felt such generosity and care from others since her master passed away.

“Junior Brother… Then I’ll accept it. ”

After thinking for a while, Yuelun decided to accept the chiliad gold vine seedling. She was so happy that she felt like flowers were blooming in her heart.

No matter what, this was the first time Ye Xuan had given him something, and the meaning behind it was much more precious than the treasure itself.

When she returned to the sect after this trip, she would plant it by her bed.

That way, she could see it every time she opened her eyes.

“Hehe, that’s the spirit!”

Seeing that Yuelun had finally accepted his gift, Ye Xuan was very happy, and he immediately gave the chiliad gold vine seedling to Yuelun, who carefully put it away.

She treasured this gift and was determined to take good care of it after she returned.

After doing all this, Yuelun looked at Ye Xuan, the joy in her heart indescribable.

It turned out that she had always been as important as Ye Xuan’s two little disciples, otherwise, why would he have given her such a precious treasure.

Thinking this, Yuelun’s face instantly turned as red as an apple. Then, she had a bold idea.

Before Ye Xuan could react, Yuelun quietly moved to his side and left a lip mark on his face.

“Ah!”

“I… I… Is there anyone who takes advantage of others like you?”

Ye Xuan was stunned for a few seconds before he came back to his senses. However, by this time Yuelun had already darted away.

After seeing his reaction, Yuelun blushed and smiled sweetly.

“Hehe, you’ve already given me such a precious treasure, so I can’t just leave you with nothing, right?”

Ye Xuan’s right hand was on his cheek, as if he was feeling the remaining warmth.

After a long while, he replied, “Alright, I understand. Senior Sister Yuelun. I’ll find a few more treasures for you later, hehe…”

Hearing this, Yuelun was dumbfounded and glared at Ye Xuan.

When she thought about it, she could not help but feel a little embarrassed. She really had acted out of character just now.

Her face could not help but turn even redder, and she wanted to cover her face and find a place to bury her head.

After a long while, Yuelun finally calmed down and waved her hand in front of Ye Xuan’s eyes.

“Junior Brother Ye, what are you thinking about?”

“I’m fine…”

Ye Xuan replied with a smirk, not at all admitting that he was thinking about how he could take back the initiative.

“Senior Sister, no matter how you look at it, I feel like I’ve suffered a huge loss.”

“I’ve already given you the chiliad gold vine, but you’re still trying to take advantage of me. How could you do this?”

“Since you’ve already kissed me, you must let me kiss you back. Otherwise, it’s really unfair.”

As soon as he said this, Ye Xuan immediately started moving toward Yuelun step by step.

“Ah, Junior Brother, d-don’t come near me.”

After hearing Ye Xuan’s words, Yuelun panicked, and her feet seemed to be glued in place. Within moments, Ye Xuan was already in front of her, his eyes staring straight into hers.

At this moment, Yuelun did not know what she should do. She could only hear her heart thumping wildly as she shyly lowered her head.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan gradually moved closer to Yuelun’s mouth, preparing to execute his evil plan.

At this crucial moment, the system’s notification rang out.

“Ding! You have given Yuelun a chiliad gold vine seedling. Congratulations! You have obtained a randomized 10,000x critical reward!”

Ye Xuan was stunned for a moment, and then he was happy.

Originally, he had only wanted to try to see what reward he would receive, and had not expected to receive a 10,000x multiplier.

Surprisingly, even though Yuelun was not a disciple of the sect, he could still receive a reward. Furthermore, Yuelun was his senior sister.

The system was clearly too magical!

Not only would he not lose anything by giving something to others, but he could even receive a 10,000x reward multiplier while flirting.

Immersed in the system’s notification, Ye Xuan had even forgotten that he was about to kiss Yuelun. He even turned around stupidly.

After waiting for a while, Yuelun felt that something was wrong. Why had he not kissed her after waiting for so long?

She could not help but secretly glance upward, and immediately saw that Ye Xuan had already turned his back on her.

She instantly burst into anger.

“You b*stard!”

At this moment, Yuelun was more than a little angry. Things had already come to this, yet he was still toying with her?

“You make me so angry!”

...

She kicked the ground a few times and really wanted to rush over and kick Ye Xuan’s butt a few times.

However, Ye Xuan’s mind was still immersed in the system notification.
