862 Immortal Bone?

Feng Xiyun did not know how to repay her teacher’s kindness. Therefore, she could only steel herself and not let her teacher down.

She strengthened her will and began to focus on cultivating with Ye Xuan. Soon, she realized that the complete version of the Heaven Burning Flames that her teacher was imparting to her was much stronger than the original one.

If she could really master the completed version, she would be able to compete with those peerless geniuses from the other continents.

“Pay attention, we’re starting!”

Hearing her teacher’s instructions, Feng Xiyun immediately focused herself and circulated her spiritual power, following closely behind the spiritual power that Ye Xuan was transmitting through her body, while memorizing the circulation route.

Moments later, Ye Xuan pushed his hands forward and said, “The Heaven Burning Flames contain an extremely profound Dao. You must remember it well. I will tell you how to cultivate it later.”

“Yes, Teacher,” Feng Xiyun replied without hesitation.

Fortunately, Feng Xiyun had already cultivated the incomplete version of this technique previously, so she was able to completely memorize it.

After finally grasping it, she was shocked.

‘Heavens! This cultivation technique is so terrifying!’

The power of this cultivation technique far surpassed anything she could ever imagine or dream of. Even Zhuge Yueyue did not possess such a powerful cultivation technique, which made her a little happy.

“Concentrate and watch carefully!”

“Alright.” After hearing her teacher’s reminder, Feng Xiyun immediately focused and chastised herself. At such an important moment, she could not allow herself to be distracted by other things.

She carefully observed the various meridians in her body. The blood in her body seemed to be boiling, as the Heaven Burning Flames purified her body, while also increasing her strength.

At this moment, she felt as if her body had turned into a flame itself. It was not only that. After closely following Ye Xuan’s instructions and guidance, she sensed that a divine bone had condensed in her body!

Was her entire body being transformed right now?

Feng Xiyun was extremely shocked at this moment. Furthermore, this divine bone seemed to be approaching the level of an immortal bone

If it really became an immortal bone, then her potential would definitely far exceed those other peerless geniuses, and she might even be able to compete with Xiang Yun!

“It’s actually an immortal bone…” Feng Xiyun’s voice trembled.

After sensing this change, even Ye Xuan was shocked. It seemed that the Heaven Burning Flames technique was very compatible with Feng Xiyun, and allowed her to reconstruct her body and condense a divine, no immortal bone.

However, at this moment, because the divine bone was still in the process of transformation, a wave of intense pain surged through Feng Xiyun’s body, causing her to let out a cry of pain.

Ye Xuan immediately reacted.

“Hold on for a while longer. It won’t take long for it to be completed.”

Then, he mobilized his spiritual power again and continuously injected the power of the Heaven Burning Flames into Feng Xiyun’s body. After all her meridians were opened up, it would naturally be much easier for her to cultivate the technique.

While Ye Xuan was helping Feng Xiyun, the Dao Flowers in his body began to emit a weak aura that seemed to contain the power of the Heaven Burning Flames, which caught Ye Xuan off guard.

It seemed that today was just full of surprises.

At this moment, Ye Xuan could clearly feel that his strength had increased threefold! Furthermore, his insights gleaned from comprehending the Heaven Burning Flames technique began to overflow into his other techniques.

“A single move, carrying both the power of life and death, endless, yet finite.”

“I’ve comprehended the fourth move of the Stellar sword technique, Life and Death!”

“Oh my god!”

Ye Xuan’s eyes were already filled with excitement. However, he forced himself to calm down. He had to ensure that Feng Xiyun completed her transformation safely.

With a loud shout, Ye Xuan once again injected a burst of the power of the Heaven Burning Flames into Feng Xiyun’s body, causing her to tremble violently. Her face was pale and twisted. It was obvious that she was in great pain at this time.Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels
