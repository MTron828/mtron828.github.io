766 The Berserk Beasts Attack Again

A short while later, with the support of the infusion of spiritual power from his immortal bones, Daoist Yi Feng suddenly shouted, “Break!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the realm barrier was broken once again, and he reached the middle stage of the ancient realm.

Whoa!

What was going on?

Was it really so easy to break through?

It almost felt like Daoist Yi Feng had a system like his own!

After taking a serious look at things, Ye Xuan realized that Daoist Yi Feng’s rapid improvement was probably related to Mengyu. It seemed that the power of karma was really quite powerful.

Because Mengyu had used Daoist Yi Feng’s bloodline to become a sealed immortal realm expert, the power of the laws of the world had gathered in their immortal bones.

Regrettably, it was insufficient for him to reach the late stage of the ancient realm, though he would not face any hindrances in reaching the sealed immortal realm.

Perhaps even Mengyu did not expect that she would unintentionally help Daoist Yi Feng.

However, this did not seem normal. After all, this demoness was a powerful sealed immortal realm expert. How could she not take this into account? Could this possibly be intentional?

Still, no matter what, this was a good thing for both Daoist Yi Feng and the sect. Then…

Right at this moment, before anyone could rush over to congratulate Daoist Yi Feng, a loud boom once again rang out from the direction of Sky Mountain, and billowing black fog could be seen approaching sky mountain.

The berserk beasts were back!

They roared and charged at Sky Mountain’s line of defense, causing the formation to tremble and shake.

Furthermore, strange-looking monsters appeared in the sky one after another. They looked down at the land from above.

Standing atop Sky Mountain, Gao Shun turned around and looked at the group of people who had already turned pale with fright. He shouted loudly, “Stay calm and stop panicking!”

Thanks to his reminder, everyone froze in place and regained their composure. At this moment, Gao Shun’s expression was solemn.

In the distance, there was a particular strange-looking monster looking at them from afar. Gao Shun could tell that this monster had reached the ancient realm. If this monster started attacking, the defensive line would probably be broken quickly.

He glanced in the direction of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, hoping that Ye Xuan would arrive soon. For now, the only thing he could do now was to try his best to gain more time.

After hearing Gao Shun’s order, the disciples instantly took action, stabilizing the defensive formation. As long as that ancient realm monster did not attack, they would be able to defend this place.

“F*ck! Rather than staying here and waiting for death, it’s better to go out and kill them,” Li Dahai held a long spear in his hand and said angrily.

The other chiefs and elders of the Great Wilderness Divine sect also mobilized their forces. If Gao Shun approved it, they would immediately launch an attack.

“That’s right! Martial Uncle Gao, say the word and we will slay these beasts!”

Some disciples could not help but shout loudly, but in the next moment, they were sobered up by Gao Shun’s scolding.

“Are you guys stupid?”

“In this situation, if you really make your way into that sea of berserks beasts, you will definitely die. How many lives do you think you have?”

“The best course of action now is to use the terrain to defend this place and buy time!” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Thankfully, Gao Shun’s ability to analyze the situation and issue the appropriate commands was still intact, which kept the situation under control.

However, it was unknown how many people would die during this disaster, and the East continent would probably not recover within the next few decades.

Seeing how tragic the battle was, everyone present felt very indignant. Sky Mountain had been completely surrounded. There was no safe path to retreat at all. The only way was to firmly defend.

If the defensive line really collapsed, then their only ending would be death.

Seeing the battles happening all over the place along the defensive line, everyone felt uneasy.

Back at the sect, Ye Xuan had already noticed the situation at Sky Mountain, but he could not leave yet. He had to wait until Daoist Yi Feng woke up. After all, the greatest danger was still Mengyu…
