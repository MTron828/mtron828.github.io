903 Meeting Gifts

“I’m fine,” she said.

After adjusting her condition, Yanran did not look so weak anymore. She had used up too much energy just now.

After recovering, Yanran sized up the girl in front of her, and was amused to discover that they had similar cold temperaments.

“Did your teacher give you this sword?”

Yanran raised the Cloud Heaven Sword in her hand and looked at it. She was no stranger to this sword. Back then, this was the sword that Ye Xuan had used to wreak havoc in the ancient tomb.

The fact that he had given this sword to this disciple meant that he valued her very much.

After hearing Yanran’s question, Zhuge Yueyue was momentarily stunned, before finally answering, “Yes, Teacher’s wife. I’m not very skilled. Teacher might be afraid that I’d encounter dangers outside, so he passed this sword to me.” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Hearing this, Yanran nodded and returned the Cloud Heaven Sword to Zhuge Yueyue.

“Very good. Your name is Yueyue, right? Keep this sword well. I believe that you will definitely be able to shine with this sword as your partner in the future.”

After saying this, Yanran felt that something was amiss. As an elder, this was the first time she was meeting Zhuge Yueyue. Should she give her a small gift?

After all, since they were Ye Xuan’s disciples, they were her half-disciples as well, right?

However, she did not understand the customs here. If she gave something rashly and did something wrong, the impact might be the opposite of what she wanted to achieve.

In the end, she took out a jade pendant and immediately tied it on Yanran’s waist.

“This Ice Jade is a meeting gift. I obtained it in an extremely cold place. I’ve been wearing it for a long time, and it should be greatly beneficial to your cultivation.”

Zhuge Yueyue was extremely shocked when she touched the Ice Jade. The jade pendant resonated with the immortal bones in her body. If she cultivated with it, her cultivation speed would definitely increase a hundredfold.

It could be seen that this Ice Jade was a true treasure.

“Oh my god! Teacher’s wife, this is really too precious. I can’t accept it.”

Zhuge Yueyue refused without hesitation. Although there was indeed a tradition of juniors receiving gifts from seniors, she really could not bear to accept such a precious gift.

Yanran was a little unhappy. Could it be that there was no such practice here? Or perhaps she had used the wrong approach?

She usually cultivated in the secret realm, so she did not understand the customs of the ordinary world at all. Seeing that Zhuge Yueyue had not accepted it, she felt that she had done something wrong.

Just as she was about to speak, another figure appeared beside Zhuge Yueyue and looked at Yanran with a smile, “Don’t forget me, Teacher’s wife. You’re giving First Sister a gift, but what about me?”

Hearing this, Yanran was stunned.

It seemed that she had not been completely wrong. It was just that she left out a step, or rather a person.

After thinking for a moment, Yanran said, “There’s one for you too.”

As soon as she finished speaking, Yanran searched her storage space and finally found a jade pendant that was emitting a warm aura.

“This piece of Blazing Flame Jade is compatible with your sister’s Ice Jade. It also has extremely beneficial effects to someone who cultivates fire-type techniques like you.”

“I can already tell that you possess the Blazing Flame Immortal Bones in your body. Coincidentally, I have this Blazing Flame Jade, so I’ll give it to you.”

Feng Xiyun took the jade pendant without hesitation. A bright smile appeared on her face as she said sweetly, “Yay, I knew Teacher’s wife was the best.”

Hearing them call her that again and again, Yanran’s heart almost melted. It was as if these two had also become her precious disciples. It was a very strange feeling.

Yanran liked them very much. Even though they had only met for the first time today, she had already grown fond of these two girls, partially because they kept calling her Teacher’s wife.

‘The next time I meet Ye Xuan, I must ask him whether I can bring these two back with me. We can cultivate together, and they can tell me more about him.’

‘Hehe… That’s a good idea.’

At this moment, Yanran had already begun to think of a plan in her heart. However, a violent roar suddenly resounded across the sky. The originally quiet scene once again became turbulent.

“What’s happening this time?”

Everyone was extremely surprised and looked at the sky above in panic.

The sky instantly turned dark. One after another, powerful bolts of divine lightning flashed continuously, making everyone feel a great sense of oppression.

Looking at this scene, Yanran frowned. She felt that this matter was not easy to deal with. Subconsciously, she pulled Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun behind her.

Zhuge Yueyue asked nervously, “Teacher’s wife, is something going to happen again?”

Yanran’s expression did not look too good at this moment. She replied, “More are coming. This round will be harder to deal with than the last.”

After all, there was not much spiritual power left in Yanran’s body, yet there was actually another powerful enemy attacking…
