“They are really about to appear…”

Everyone’s faces turned pale, and their hearts were filled with fear.

Gao Shun, who was beside Ye Xuan, was also scared out of his wits. His legs had already begun to tremble uncontrollably.

The disciples of the Great Wilderness Divine sect were also very shocked, not entirely certain as to what was going on. However, they could all sense the power emanating from the door.

Ao Lei’s expression became very gloomy. He shouted, “Everyone, stay vigilant. Prepare for battle!”

After hearing this order, almost all of the elders flew up and returned to their positions. The Great Wilderness Formation was successfully activated shortly after.

This time, they had no idea how strong the enemy was, so everyone was extremely flustered. However, although they were very afraid, they did not back down.

Since Ye Xuan was the Sword Elder of the sect, then they would stand behind him until the very end.

Ye Xuan did not say a word. He unhesitatingly took out his Godsword, which floated menacingly in front of him.

In the blink of an eye, his sword aura swept out and clashed against the other party’s aura. After doing this, Ye Xuan said loudly, “Since you’re already here, why hide?”

“Who in the Heavenly Dao World dares to come to my realm?”

Hearing Ye Xuan’s bold words, everyone was taken aback.

What exactly is Ye Xuan doing?”

“Could it be that he wants to provoke the immortals in the Heavenly Dao World?”

“He’s going to anger them all!”

Rumbling sounds rang out one after another as dark clouds rolled over, as if the end of the world was coming.

Everyone was extremely afraid at this moment, and there was not a single part of their bodies that was not trembling.

In the face of the aura released by these otherworldly experts, even ancient realm experts were suppressed, not to mention the other weaker cultivators.

“Damn you, Ye Xuan! You definitely won’t be able to escape this time. When the higher-beings of our race arrive, you will die a miserable death!”

After sensing the incoming aura, the little golden-furred growler bared its teeth and roared. Its appearance was as ferocious as it could be.

Hearing this, Ye Xuan smiled, but did not even bother to look at him. The little golden-furred growler was nothing more than an insignificant ant to him.

However, since this fellow was wagging his tongue, the best way was to destroy his confidence and everything he believed in.

Seeing Ye Xuan remain silent, the little golden-furred growler immediately continued his insults.

“You ant-like sealed immortal realm expert, how dare you provoke our golden-furred growler race? No matter who comes today, you won’t be able to escape death!”

Ye Xuan simply ignored the insults, but Zhuge Yueyue could not help but retort.

Despite the terrifying aura released from the sky, she was still not afraid. She would not allow anyone to insult her teacher.

“Shut up, you b*stard,” she said coldly, “Who gave you the guts to insult my teacher?”

Hearing this, the little golden-furred growler stared at Zhuge Yueyue fiercely. It had no intention of backing down at all. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Although he knew that he was no match for Zhuge Yueyue, this did not stop him from being stubborn.

Ye Xuan had already killed his father in public today. So unless Ye Xuan killed him today as well, he vowed to return for revenge in the future. He would definitely make Ye Xuan, Zhuge Yueyue, and their entire sect, pay the price in blood one day.

Looking at Zhuge Yueyue, the little golden-furred growler shouted hysterically, “So what if I don’t respect your teacher? If you have the ability, just kill me! I’m not afraid of you!”

Zhuge Yue Yue’s eyes were filled with killing intent. Did this stinking little golden-furred growler really think that she did not have the guts to kill him?

Moments later, a sword beam shot toward the little golden-furred growler’s head.

Zhuge Yueyue’s attack was so sudden that the little golden-furred growler had no time to react. He had not expected her to be so bold as to attack him even though there was already someone coming to back him up.

He frantically tried to dodge, but realized that the injuries he had suffered earlier were too serious, and held him back. The attack slammed into his body, and he immediately spat out a mouthful of red blood.

Just as he was about to be killed by Zhuge Yueyue, an attack suddenly descended from the sky.

“Oh no, First Sister, dodge quickly!”

After discovering this situation, Feng Xiyun shouted loudly.
