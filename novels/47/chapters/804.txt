805 One World

It was because of that great battle a hundred years ago that her Heaven Devouring technique was dubbed as the most vicious technique in the world.

“Senior Brother, should we go and help them? At the very least, it would help them break free from the restraints of the Devouring Heaven technique,” Yuelun said worriedly.

After Ye Xuan started fighting, she was constantly on tenterhooks and looked very tired.

Hearing this, Ao Lei waved his hand and said, “Absolutely not. Perhaps none of you know just how powerful the Devouring Heaven technique is. If you stepped into the absorption range of the technique, you would be sucked dry in moments.”

“The more people go over, the more energy she can absorb. Therefore, if anyone goes over now, it will only make things worse.”

After hearing this, everyone present became worried.

‘This… this…this won’t do. Can we only watch this continue?” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Is there any way we can help them?”

Yuelun asked anxiously. However, she knew very well that with her current cultivation level, she would not be of much help in this battle.

“Hahaha…”

After using the Devouring Heaven Technique, Mengyu seemed to have been possessed. Her eyes were bloodshot and her entire being was filled with killing intent.

After being immobilized, Ye Xuan looked at Daoist Yi Feng as more and more of their blood evaporated into thin air. Daoist Yi Feng was already old and probably would not be able to hold on much longer.

Ye Xuan was also very anxious. If this situation continued, both of them would probably end up dead.

However, he remained calm and activated the three Dao Flowers in his sea of consciousness, causing them to release dazzling divine light.

Since the situation had developed to this point, he could only use his final trump card.

“Oh?”

After fully activating the Devouring Heaven Technique, Mengyu looked at the two of them with a cold gaze.

However, at this moment, she suddenly sensed strange energy fluctuations emanating from Ye Xuan’s body.

However, before she could investigate what was going on, the entire world began to tremble. All of the flowers, plants, and trees within a few hundred kilometers had dried up.

“What exactly is happening?”

“Why did the plants and trees here instantly dry up?”

At this moment, people could not help but discuss with worried faces.

However, at this moment, someone else noticed that this strange scene was caused by Ye Xuan, and that strange fluctuations were being released from his body.

“Could it be that Ye Xuan still has a trump card that he hasn’t used?”

Everyone revealed shocked expressions. From beyond the barrier, as the battle continued, more people started to gather to watch again.

After seeing that Ye Xuan was about to unleash another terrifying sword move, they waited with bated breaths.

“What the hell is this move? This scene is too terrifying,” an expert said with a surprised expression.

He had already lived for more than a thousand years, but this was the first time he had seen such a strange scene.

Even Mengyu was starting to panic.

Seeing that Ye Xuan, who had been completely restrained by her, was actually releasing a powerful sword aura again, her expression changed drastically, and she immediately took a few steps back. The space where she had just stood was ripped to shreds by the sword aura.

At this moment, even the space began to fluctuate violently, and cracks gradually spread out.

As the light flickered, a figure holding a longsword slowly appeared in everyone’s field of vision. Ye Xuan held the Godsword aloft, and then swung it, causing the entire world to darken.

At this moment, Mengyu felt fear creep in from the depths of her heart.

She had never seen such a sword move before. It was simply incomparably terrifying.

“Great witch, this can be considered my trump card. It is called One World!”

“Let’s end today’s matter here. No matter what the outcome is, the grudges between us will be severed by this sword!”

Ye Xuan said this with a cold expression. He originally did not want to use this trump card, but Mengyu was probably prepared for all of his previous moves, so he had no choice.

“One World?”

“What kind of move is this?”

People had never heard of this move before, so they were very puzzled.

It was obvious that they did not understand the insights contained in this sword move at all.

The moment Ye Xuan swung the Godsword, the flow of time seemed to have changed. The flowers and trees in the distance withered at an extremely fast speed.

“This sword is related to the laws of time!”

Everyone paled in shock, finally understanding what Ye Xuan’s move was about. This sword move could actually control the flow of time and use it to make everything wither, including his enemies?

Even a sealed immortal realm expert like Mengyu couldn’t escape such a powerful move.

The difference between this move and the Heaven-Splitting Sword technique was that it could ignore not only space, but also time. Any divine would pale in comparison to this move.

It had only been a short while, but Mengyu’s hair was already beginning to turn pale. She was flustered.

“You want to use this method to kill me?”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan smiled coldly and replied, “What’s wrong? Can’t I?”

“Great Demoness, you are indeed very powerful, and also an existence that I cannot defeat. However, this does not mean that I cannot kill you.”

Hearing this, Mengyu’s heart began to turn cold. She felt that she was really going to suffer this time…
