Chapter 282: Look, I Found You A Junior Sister

Ye Xuan was clear about Jun Lingtian’s intentions.

Ever since he had involved himself in Qian Daoliu’s matter, up till now, he had been trying to win Ye Xuan over.

Unlike other superpowers, the Divine Gate Holy Land had always maintained an attitude of roping in the peerless geniuses from the various regions and empires.

They believed that such geniuses were blessed by fate, and that hunting such geniuses down would result in punishment from the Heavenly Dao.

Throughout countless eras on the Tianyuan continent, there had been many terrifyingly strong forces that hunted down and tried to kill peerless geniuses that they deemed threatening to their future.

However, no matter how hard they tried, or what methods they used, more often than not, they were unable to kill them. Furthermore, once the genius grew stronger, they would return to exact their revenge.

Such incidents were very common in every era.

Even though many people did not believe in fate, it did exist, and it was closely related to the legendary creation intent.

Among the ten supreme intents, other than the most mysterious karmic intent, the creation intent was the strongest.

Still, Ye Xuan was surprised to find someone who put their money where their mouth was, and immediately gained a good impression of both Jun Lingtian and the ancestor.

“Since that’s done, I won’t disturb you any further.”

Jun Lingtian nodded with a smile, and then suddenly disappeared.

Now that Ye Xuan’s matter had been resolved, he had to return to find Zhao Yuzhen.

If Qian Daoliu’s main body came to the Nanzhou Region, the two of them would have to rely on the ancestor’s jade token to save their lives.

Most importantly, he had a feeling that he would not be safe if he stayed around here for too long.

The way Shangguan Wan’er looked at him just now seemed a little strange!

What was going on? When did I offend her?

Jun Lingtian’s heart was filled with helplessness, and he could only run away as soon as possible.

“My precious disciple, quickly come with me! I’ll show you all of the treasures you can have.”

Ye Xuan looked at Shangguan Wan’er with a smile as he put away the Tower of Heaven. He then turned into a streak of light and left the spatial turbulence.

“Stop spouting nonsense! I’m not your disciple!”

Shangguan Wan’er glared at Ye Xuan.

Ever since she had met him, this guy had been teasing her verbally. It was too much!

However, even though she hesitated for a while, she finally chose to follow him.

“Hmph! Do you think some random treasures will make me acknowledge you as my teacher? I’ll take a look, and then laugh in your face!”

After that, the two of them returned to the Qingyun sect.

“Teacher!”

As soon as Ye Xuan appeared, he was greeted by Yue, Li Qingyan, and Zhao Yuyan.

His three disciples ran toward him with happy smiles on their faces.

After not seeing him for a year, Yue, Li Qingyan, and Zhao Yuyan naturally missed Ye Xuan.

“Hahaha! you’ve all done well. I see that you’ve been cultivating diligently!”

Ye Xuan did a quick check and saw the changes in their cultivation levels and strength.

Their spiritual senses had grown stronger, and their own cultivation levels had advanced.

The most obvious one was Zhao Yuyan, who had already reached the third level of the purple spirit realm.

The Demon Devourer body was indeed a top-notch special constitution. Her cultivation speed was lightning quick!

Although Yue and Li Qingyan’s cultivation levels had not increased, their cultivation foundation had solidified, and their spiritual senses were far stronger than before.

‘Are these Ye Xuan’s disciples?’

Shangguan Wan’er, who was following behind Ye Xuan, witnessed this scene with a curious gaze.

She had investigated everything about Ye Xuan, so she naturally knew the identities of Yue and the others.

However, when she examined Zhao Yuyan’s special constitution, she was shocked.

A tiny sect like this not only had a monster like Ye Xuan, but also had someone with a top-notch special constitution like the Demon Devourer Body. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

It was truly surprising.

“I haven’t been idle this year! I’ve found you a very powerful junior sister!”

Ye Xuan said to Yue and the others with a smile. Then, he gestured toward Shangguan Wan’er beside him.

“Junior Sister?”

Hearing this, Yue, Li Qingyan, and Zhao Yuyan turned their attention to Shangguan Wan’er.

They had not sensed any aura from Shangguan Wan’er just now, so it was obvious that her strength was not to be underestimated.

Furthermore, even the teacher said that she was very powerful!

“Hello, junior sister!”

Yue, Li Qingyan, and Zhao Yuyan greeted her with a smile.

Although Shangguan Wan’er’s seniority was low, her strength far exceeded that of her senior sisters.

Among the three of them, Li Qingyan was the strongest. Her cultivation had reached the advanced-stage of the true core realm. Despite that, she could not get a reading on Shangguan Wan’er’s cultivation level.

‘When did I acknowledge this fellow as my teacher?’

Hearing this, Shangguan Wan’er’s face turned cold.

Just as she was about to reject him arrogantly, her eyes were drawn to the object in Ye Xuan’s hand.

A heart of heavenly lightning had appeared in Ye Xuan’s hand.

Furthermore, it was a third-level one!

‘How is this possible? He still has the heart of heavenly lightning?’

‘Did he not use it earlier?’

Shangguan Wan’er was stunned.

“Yan’er, I’ve already completely sealed off the violent energy of the heart of heavenly lightning. From today onward, this heart of heavenly lightning is yours!”

“When you become stronger in the future, you will naturally be able to absorb the heavenly lightning intent contained within it,” Ye Xuan said to Zhao Yuyan.
