Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“The 70th level… This guy has broken through to the 70th level…”

“Oh my God! He’s already very close to the master of the Divine Gate.”

“Look! This guy has already broken the record of the master of the Divine Gate!”

Gongsun Yao could barely maintain her composure. She was completely stunned.

“How is this possible?”

“This fellow has already broken the record of the master of the Divine Gate… he has actually surpassed my idol?”

The arrogance in her heart was instantly shattered. The sense of superiority she had dissipated bit by bit.

“F*ck! He’s now at the 80th level…”

“What’s even crazier is that he hasn’t slowed down at all!”

“Look! He has already reached the top 100 ranks of the Combat Power List…”

“He… he is going to rewrite history…”

The cultivators in the War God Hall were extremely excited and kept shouting and screaming.

The Tower of Heaven had existed in the Nanzhou Region for tens of thousands of years, but no cultivator had ever been able to shake the position of the top 100 ranks on the combat power list.

Even the previous master of the Divine Gate, a peerless genius whose cultivation had broken through to the peak of the core formation realm, was only ranked among the top 20,000th on the combat power list.

What did this mean? It meant that Ye Xuan’s strength had far surpassed the peak of the core formation realm.

Unity realm!

This guy must have reached the unity realm!

He was only 20 years old and had stepped into the unity realm.

“He’s already in the top ten…” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“No, he’s in the top five…”

“He’s already broken the record of the third place, Nangong Beicheng…”

“Second place…”

“Oh my God! Even Ye Tian, who has always maintained the record for the first place, was defeated…”

“This guy has already reached the 89th floor…”

“Oh my God, he has passed the 90th floor and has made history!”

“He is still continuing the trial, and his speed has not decreased by much!”

“What kind of monster is this guy?”

“Look! This guy has already reached the 99th level. That’s the last level of the Tower of Heaven!”

The War God Hall had never been so lively. Countless cultivators shouted excitedly.

They were actually witnessing history being made here!

How long had the Tower of Heaven existed? It could be tens of thousands of years, or it could be hundreds of thousands of years. No one knew.

However, people now knew that Ye Xuan was the first person to surpass the 90th level of the Tower of Heaven.

“He seems to be stuck at the 99th level!”

“It’s the final level of the Tower of Heaven. Can he pass the trial there?”

Seeing that Ye Xuan had paused there, everyone waited with bated breath and anticipation.

They were hoping that Ye Xuan could succeed and do what no one else had ever done before.

It was now so quiet that one could hear a pin drop. Everyone’s gazes were locked onto the speck of light that was on the 99th floor.

“Ye Xuan…” Gongsun Yao softly muttered.

He… he had actually reached the final level!

A 20-year-old cultivator from an unknown sect and unknown empire had actually reached the peak of the Tower of Heaven.

When Ye Xuan appeared, the pride and confidence in Gongsun Yao’s heart had been completely crushed.

She knew that she was no match for this person. Heck, even her idol had been surpassed, as well as the legendary first-ranked Ye Tian!

He… he had already reached the top!

At this moment, no one doubted Ye Xuan’s strength. All talk and bluster of their own levels of talent had ceased, and they were glued to the screen of light.Such a scene was certainly magnificent!

Everyone hoped to witness history being made once again, and to see Ye Xuan become a legend of the Tower of Heaven.

From now on, Ye Xuan’s name would spread far and wide throughout the Nanzhou Region, and even further beyond!
