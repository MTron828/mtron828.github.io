877 Two Breakthroughs In One Day Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

At this moment, a wild laughter suddenly rang out from atop Cloud Sky peak.

“Hahaha!”

Gao Shun leapt up, and with a wave of his hand, he released a terrifying aura that even caused the sky to tremble.

The cultivators on the peak were taken aback, but once they sensed his aura, they immediately understood what had happened.

Ao Lei sucked in a breath of cold air and muttered to himself, “Ancient realm…”

No one had expected Gao Shun to actually break through to the ancient realm just as the power was about to run out.

“Oh my god, Senior Brother Gao has actually reached the ancient realm…”

“He’s the third person in the sect who managed to reach the ancient realm!”

The group of elders not far away exclaimed in surprise.

After sensing the envious gazes of others, Gao Shun’s heart swelled with pride, and he could barely stop himself from prancing around in joy.

“Hehehe, this is so awesome! So, an ancient Realm expert is actually this strong?” Gao Shun exclaimed in ecstasy after examining the power contained within his body.

The disciples soon recovered from their surprise and said, “Congratulations on your breakthrough to the ancient realm, Martial Uncle Gao!”

All of this praise inflated Gao Shun’s ego, and he was basking in the limelight. However, before he got too happy, another powerful aura erupted, frightening everyone.

When they turned around, they saw a beam of azure light that stretched up to the sky engulfing a beautiful figure.

“It’s actually Chief Yuelun!”

Amidst the azure light, she looked like a fairy that had descended from the heavens, dazzling everyone who saw her.

Moments later, a mark also appeared on Yuelun’s forehead.

“Oh my god…”

Seeing this scene, even Feng Xiyun was extremely shocked. At this moment, Yuelun suddenly opened her eyes, which seemed to contain countless stars, clear and bright.

“Ancient realm!”

“Today, we have two new ancient realm experts!”

It was truly shocking, and something that had never happened in the Great Wilderness Divine sect, much less the East continent. However, this was a great thing for the Great Wilderness Divine sect.

“Hahaha, wonderful!” Ao Lei jumped up, his eyes filled with excitement. He then said, “Two ancient realm experts have appeared in one day. Our Great Wilderness Divine sect’s future is assured. Perhaps, we’ll even be able to produce another sealed immortal realm expert!”

“Hmph! Let’s see who still dares to look down on our sect now!”

He was filled with confidence, and felt that he did not have to worry about the future development of the sect in the future.

“Congratulations on breaking through the ancient realm, Chief Yuelun!”

At this moment, all of the disciples immediately expressed their congratulations. Each and every one of them was filled with excitement.

Martial Uncle Ye’s opportunity had improved the overall combat strength of the sect significantly, and their respect for him grew. Amidst the excitement, Ao Lei started to ponder on his own situation.

Seeing that the junior brothers and sisters he had once protected had all surpassed him, he felt a trace of disappointment. However, he was also thankful that his teacher’s wish before he passed away had been realized. The Great Wilderness Divine sect had finally recovered its former glory.

“Sigh…” After sighing emotionally, Ao Lei’s face once again bloomed with a brilliant smile, burying these worries deep in his heart.

In fact, there was something that he had never mentioned to anyone. His life force was about to be exhausted, and he might not live for very long. Perhaps it was because there had been too many major events in recent times, but many people had already forgotten about Ao Lei’s age, who could be somewhat considered to be from the same generation as Daoist Yi Feng.

Thinking of this, Ao Lei suddenly felt very emotional. He had witnessed the rise of the sect after resolving its battle with Mengyu. However, it seemed that he would not be able to witness the sect’s glory once it reached its peak and hopefully became the number one force within the unified continents.

Time waited for no one, including him…
