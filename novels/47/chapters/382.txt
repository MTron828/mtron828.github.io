383 Teacher, You’re So Mean!

“Elder Lin, are you sure?”

“Is this guy really a heaven realm expert?”

Su Changhe’s eyes widened in shock when he heard that.

Even though the Su family was a powerful family in the Yangli divine empire, there were only two heaven realm experts in the entire family.

This guy was so young, and had said that he was just a commoner. How could he turn out to be a heaven realm expert?

“Young Master, we’re done for! We’re in trouble,” Elder Lin said with a pale face.

Although he was a void realm expert and had a high status in the Su family, he was nothing in front of a heaven realm expert. Even the Su family would have to be respectful to a heaven realm expert.

However, what puzzled him was why such an expert was present here. Furthermore, based on the power of the destructive sword qi that the other party had just displayed, even the family head might not be able to go toe-to-toe with this expert.

This guy’s strength was too terrifying!

Su Changhe’s face turned as pale as snow.

Even though he had asked about the other party’s background just now, he did not expect that he had still misjudged the situation and caused a great disaster.

“Young Master Su, what did you just say just now? Why don’t you say it again?”

Ye Xuan had an expression of mock confusion as he teased Su Changhe.

Su Changhe’s body trembled uncontrollably when he heard this. He cursed Ye Xuan’s 18 generations of ancestors in his heart.

He was obviously a heaven realm expert, yet he still pretended to be a weak commoner.

Was this sort of twisted roleplay common nowadays?

Su Changhe felt immense regret.

Before he left the Su family’s residence, his father had told him that the beast attacks had spread throughout the entire East continent, and that the Yangli divine empire had invited all of the holy lands to resolve this issue.

He had specifically asked Su Changhe to restrain himself and not offend those experts.

The Su family might be a powerful family within the Yangli divine empire, but to those powerful holy lands, they were just a rather strong ant.

At first, Su Changhe did not think much of it and thought that his father was making a big fuss over nothing.

It was not until he met Ye Xuan that he truly realized that his father’s words were true. The people from the holy lands were truly terrifying!

When he saw Ye Xuan’s mocking smile, his heart was filled with despair.

It seemed that he had played himself.

Su Changhe almost felt like slapping himself at this moment.

Why was he so blind?

How could such an extraordinary beauty be ordinary?

Then, Su Changhe took a deep breath and knelt in front of Ye Xuan.

“Senior, I was blind and offended you just now. I hope that you can forgive me on account of the Su family, as well as my 80-year-old mother and my unborn child.”

“Pfft!”

Zhuge Yueyue could not help but laugh at this sudden turn of events.

Her teacher was an excellent actor, and the result was so satisfying!

She felt completely safe and carefree by his side.

Ye Xuan’s mouth twitched as he looked at Su Changhe kneeling on the ground. His eyes were filled with disappointment.

Ye Xuan thought that as a disciple of a powerful family in the Yangli divine empire, Su Changhe would be more stubborn and start threatening him with the power of the family’s ancestor or something equivalent.

Yet this guy actually ended up kneeling down and begging for mercy?

“It seems that Young Master Su is a very filial person!”

“Very good. I’ve always admired filial people like you!”

“Since that’s the case, I won’t hold this matter against you.”

Su Changhe looked ecstatic when he heard that. The stone that had been weighing down on his heart was finally lifted.

‘I didn’t expect him to be so easy to talk to. He let me off after just a simple apology.’

However, at this moment, Ye Xuan spoke again.

“It just so happens that I’m free during this period of time. When the time comes, I’ll pay a visit to the Su family of the Yangli divine empire and see how filial Young Master Su is to his elders.”

“What?” Su Changhe’s expression changed drastically as he plopped onto the ground.

What was this guy trying to do?

“I hope that what Young Master Su said is true. If I go to the Su family and find out that you were lying, there will be consequences!”

As he spoke, Ye Xuan deliberately released a trace of his spiritual power.

Su Changhe felt his bones creaking and his meridians on the verge of being torn apart. His heart was filled with despair.

‘This is bad! I’m really doomed now!’

“Pfft!”

Zhuge Yueyue could barely restrain her laughter again when she saw Ye Xuan’s mischievous expression.

She did not expect her serious teacher to have such a side.

With just a few words, he had scared that guy silly. Perhaps this would end up becoming a traumatic and life-changing moment for Su Changhe.

After all, Ye Xuan had never said when he would actually pay a visit to the Su family, and because of this, it was impossible for Su Changhe to prepare in advance.

If he really wanted to live, he could only be truly filial and play that character to the end.

“Alright, Young Master Su. If you don’t have anything else important to say, you’d better hurry back to your Su family and be filial to your elders,” Ye Xuan said with a mocking look.

Su Changhe’s face was as pale as snow. He quickly fled with his followers.

After running for dozens of kilometers as fast as he could, he finally stopped and cried out, “We’re finished! What should we do now?”

Elder Lin hesitated for a moment before he spoke. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Young Master, although the power he displayed is equivalent to a heaven realm cultivator, I can sense that he is actually far more powerful. If he were to unleash his full power, even a mystic lord realm expert would be no match for him.”

“This old man still suggests that you follow his instructions and not think of taking advantage of the situation.”

“Otherwise, you’ll definitely bring a catastrophe upon our Su family!”

Su Changhe’s face was filled with despair when he heard that.

Elder Lin was the most powerful man sent by his father, and he was also his most loyal and trusted guard.

If even Elder Lin had spoken, it could only mean that Ye Xuan’s strength had reached an extremely terrifying level.

…

Looking at Su Changhe’s sorry figure as he fled, Zhuge Yueyue finally laughed out loud.

“Teacher, you were so mean just now. You scared him so much that he almost peed his pants!”
