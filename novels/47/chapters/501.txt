502 Poaching A Disciple?

At the same time, Chu Tianba felt rather emotional.

This was a case of the younger generation surpassing the previous generation. Perhaps it would soon be time for the previous generation to step back.

Hearing this, Ye Xuan smiled.

“Fellow Daoist Chu is too modest. How can I be compared to you? Only my Sword Dao is worth mentioning.”

“It’s a pity that Elder Taiyin was blinded by his pride, and chose to compete with me in terms of the Sword Dao. Otherwise, I would have suffered.”

Ye Xuan laughed inwardly. Elder Taiyin had indeed brought a knife to a gunfight. It would be a complete waste if he did not teach the latter a proper lesson.

Chu Tianba smiled and did not say anything.

If he had not witnessed the battle just now, he might have been fooled. Those bright golden patterns that writhed around Ye Xuan’s fingers earlier were definitely not part of his sword technique, but some sort of terrifying divine power.

Of course, Chu Tianba did not expose Ye Xuan’s lies.

The Reincarnation Fairy looked at Ye Xuan in awe and disbelief. This young man was probably not much older than she was, but had easily defeated a half-step supreme realm expert.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan smiled.

“Everyone thinks that I’ve reached the pinnacle of the Sword Dao, but they don’t know that my comprehension of this sword technique has only reached ten to twenty percent.”

“What? You’ve only comprehended ten to twenty percent of that sword technique?”

When the crowd heard this, they were shocked and dumbfounded.

Was this f*cking for real?

If ten to twenty percent was enough to defeat Elder Taiyin, then how strong would Ye Xuan be when he fully mastered this sword technique?

Was he looking to slay the heavens?

‘Oh my god, Chief Ye Xuan is the master of looking cool! I’ve been following him for so long, but had not realized that he had such talent in this area.’

Su Changhe’s eyes were full of respect.

‘Hehe! I have to jot down this sentence. On the surface, it’s self-depreciating, but in reality, the fact that he’s showing off can’t be more obvious.’

Su Changhe’s eyes immediately lit up!

When Chu Tianba heard Ye Xuan’s words, his expression became even more serious.

The sword technique that Ye Xuan used just now was very likely a divine-rank one.

In order to cultivate such a superb divine power, there were extremely strict requirements for the cultivator’s constitution and talent.

Just now, Chu Tianba had used his spiritual sense to probe Ye Xuan, but he was unable to determine what Ye Xuan’s constitution was. However, if that sword technique was a divine-rank one, then his constitution was definitely extraordinary.

Seeing the change in everyone’s expressions, Ye Xuan smiled. In fact, he was just teasing them on a whim.

Seeing this, the Reincarnation Fairy thought for a while and then said, “Chief Ye Xuan is too humble. I have seen many experts, but I’ve never seen an existence as powerful as Senior Ye Xuan.”

“The sword technique that Senior Ye Xuan displayed just now contains myriad possibilities. It’s free and domineering, and seems to contain the essence of life itself.”

“It was such a profound sword technique. However, if Senior Ye Xuan had not comprehended its intricacies, there would be no way to display such power.”

Ye Xuan looked at her in surprise. This girl was really smart and observant! Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Ye Xuan nodded.

“You’re very astute, girl. You’re even better than my disciples in some aspects!”

“I have high hopes for you!”

Hearing this, her eyes flashed with joy.

‘Did Chief Ye Xuan just acknowledge me?’

“Senior Ye Xuan, you’re too kind. I don’t deserve your praise.”

She smiled faintly, feeling happy.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan’s lips could not help but curve up.

“It’s too bad you’re not a disciple of Cloud Sky peak. Otherwise, I’d definitely teach you my most powerful techniques.”

“What a pity!”

When Chu Tianba heard this, he immediately quivered as a sense of danger emerged within his heart.

What the f*ck?

Was he trying to poach his disciple in front of his eyes?

‘I treated you as a good friend, but you want to take my disciple away. What’s going on?’

Chu Tianba turned around to look at his disciple, and saw a hint of joy in her eyes.

What the f*ck was going on? Was she tempted by Ye Xuan’s words?

“Cough cough…” Chu Tianba coughed hurriedly. At this critical moment, he had to speak up. Otherwise, he might really lose his precious disciple.

In order to train and nurture the reincarnation fairy, he had spent a lot of energy and cultivation resources to make her the Saintess of the Jade Lake Divine sect. If she was taken away by Ye Xuan, his years of hard work would go down the drain.

“Fellow Daoist Ye Xuan, you really know how to joke! Given Fellow Daoist’s achievements, I believe that Fellow Daoist’s disciple must also be a peerless genius that is rarely seen throughout the ages!”

“My disciple’s aptitude is too low. How could she be qualified to join Cloud Sky peak?”

“Fellow Daoist Ye Xuan, you really know how to joke. Hahaha…”
