Zhuge Yueyue rubbed Xiang Yun’s little head and asked, “Why is it always about playing with you, haha?”

“What the announcement means is that our peak’s disciples should also go to the frontline to help build a line of defense with the disciples of the other peaks to protect the safety of the civilians. ”

Hearing this, Feng Xiyun pondered for a moment and said, “First Sister, there are quite a lot of things to manage on Cloud Sky Peak. In that case, you will be in charge of guarding the Cloud Sky peak, while Third Sister and I will go to the frontlines together.”

Hearing this, Zhuge Yueyue became worried. Would anything happen to her two junior sisters out there?

During this period of time, Feng Xiyun had reached the peak of the void realm. However, it would take some time before she was ready to break through to the heaven realm.

The imminent disaster was so dangerous that even a mystic lord realm expert would not have a 100% chance of survival, let alone two peak-level void realm cultivators.

Sigh, it seemed that everything would have to be left to Xiang Yun again, who had also reached the peak of the void realm in terms of body refining cultivation. The mysterious power within her was the best trump card to guarantee their safety.

Zhuge Yueyue rubbed her head and said, “Alright, Third Sister, can you accompany Second Sister out, and on behalf of Cloud Sky peak, deal with the threat of the beasts?”

“Hehe, First Sister, don’t worry and just leave it to me. I’ll definitely do a good job.”

Xiang Yun was already itching for action having been stuck cultivating peacefully for so long. Furthermore, no one in the sect dared to spar with her, so she had almost died of boredom.

“Very well, but you must promise me that you will take good care of Second Sister, okay?”

Upon hearing this, Xiang Yun turned to look at Feng Xiyun and replied with a serious expression, “Alright, First Sister. I will definitely protect Second Sister with my life. I will definitely not allow anything bad to happen to her.”

Feng Xiyun could not help but break out in cold sweat. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Why did it feel like she had become the burden?

She was a peak-level void realm cultivator too!

Sigh…

Although she felt somewhat exasperated, she understood that her first sister was worried about her safety. Moreover, her third sister was indeed more powerful than her.

After receiving Xiang Yun’s assurance, Zhuge Yueyue felt a huge weight lifted off her shoulders.

She turned around and looked into the distance as more and more disciples soared into the sky toward the frontlines. It was quite an awe-inspiring scene.

After thinking for a while, Zhuge Yueyue looked at Feng Xiyun and said, “Xiyun, when you are outside, you must take good care of Xiang Yun. Don’t let her cause any trouble. Help any of our disciples who need help.”

Feng Xiyun nodded, then held Xiang Yun’s hand as they too rushed to the frontlines. Zhuge Yueyue also returned to the Cloud Sky Peak to deal with other matters.

After the Great Wilderness Divine sect released this announcement, news spread rapidly and soon reached the various forces and empires of the East continent.

When they learned of this news, they all reacted with shock and admiration.

Elsewhere, the Daoist Canghai was with Elder Tongtian, as well as another elder who had just informed them of this news.

“Teacher, the Great Wilderness Divine sect has announced that they will dispatch disciples to reinforce the frontlines, and even set up defensive formations to protect the common people.”

“It’s only been a few hours, but tens of millions of people have already gathered at the frontlines, and the number is still increasing. This scene there is even more bustling than the gathering.”

“Outsiders are saying that the Great Wilderness Divine sect has become the number one sect in the East continent, and that it has won the support of countless people.”

Elder Tongtian turned around and looked at Daoist Canghai, asking, “Teacher, what do you think about this matter?”

Daoist Canghai smiled. He was actually very impressed. Not only did he admire the decisiveness and courage of the Great Wilderness Divine sect.

Doing it this way actually had both disadvantages and advantages. It was no less than a huge gamble.

“Haha, Ao Lei’s personality hasn’t changed much. He’s a man of his word and is always willing to take the plunge.”

“Despite the fact that we’re all in danger, the Great Wilderness Divine sect did not shut their doors, but set out to help others.”

“Tongtian, do you understand the logic behind this?”

Elder Tongtian pondered for a moment in his heart when he heard this question. Suddenly, a gleam flashed across his eyes…
