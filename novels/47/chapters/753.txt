754 Mengyu (Part 1)

Everyone looked at the shadowy figure behind Xiang Yun in shock.

“Haha… This is really interesting.”

Just as the crowd was about to cheer, a woman in a red dress appeared on top of the huge skeleton.

The woman sat on top of the skull’s head, looking down at Xiang Yun. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

After seeing the shadowy figure behind her, the woman in red was moved.

At that moment, she even felt a little dizzy, but it only lasted a moment.

Even though the shadowy figure behind Xiang Yun was extremely powerful, it could not display much power in its current form.

After seeing this woman, Gao Shun was shocked.

“Is this for real? Why is she still alive and well?”

The elders of the Great Wilderness Divine sect also seemed to know who this woman was.

Hua Rufeng’s curiosity got the better of him, so he asked, “Martial Uncle Gao, who is this woman? Why do you all seem to know her?”

Could it be that there was some sort of secret story behind this?

Gao Shun took a deep breath, then turned around and swept his gaze over these disciples.

These disciples were unaware of the battle that happened in the desert region back then. It was also because of that battle that the Great Wilderness Divine sect suffered heavy casualties and almost lost its legacy.

The primary culprit behind that battle was this woman, Mengyu!

In the aftermath of this battle, Chief Tian Xuan’s cultivation foundation was damaged, which eventually resulted in his death, while Daoist Yi Feng was also plagued by his inner demons and no longer cared about the affairs of the world.

This was a secret among the chiefs of the peaks and the elders, who did not even want to recall that tragedy.

At this moment, Gao Shun also figured out why these mindless berserk beasts were acting so strangely. They were all under the command of this woman in front of him. She wanted to take revenge.

Realizing this, Gao Shun felt hopeless, as did the elders around him. The disciples waited patiently, but no answer was forthcoming from Gao Shun.

The moment Mengyu appeared, Daoist Yi Feng opened his eyes back at the sect.

He really could not believe it. The expression on his face was complicated, both shocked and at a loss.

“She’s actually not dead yet?”

In that case, she probably wanted to take revenge, right?

When he remembered that broken sword, he was instantly transported back to that period in his memories.

He could clearly sense Mengyu’s aura. It seemed like she had deliberately allowed him to sense it.

However, he still did not do anything and remained in his secret chamber.

At this moment, Xiang Yun looked in a certain direction silently, feeling a little disappointed.

After thinking about it, the woman in red smiled and said, “Little friend, how about coming over to Big Sister’s side? No matter what it is you want, I can get it for you.”

“Oh my god, she’s actually targeting Xiang Yun?”

As soon as she finished speaking, light appeared in Gao Shun’s eyes again, as if he had seen a ray of hope.

Given his own strength, it was impossible to resolve this crisis. After all, Mengyu’s combat strength was too terrifying.

Moreover, it had been more than a hundred years since that battle. With the help of the Devouring Heaven technique, this demoness had probably become much stronger.

Therefore, once she made her move, the line of defense they had so painstakingly established would crumble.

The only variable and source of hope in this situation was Xiang Yun and the mysterious power inside her.

Gao Shun hurriedly said, “Martial Niece Xiang Yun, don’t listen to this woman. She’s a bad person and has already hurt countless living beings.”

Hearing this, Xiang Yun stared at the woman in red incredulously. This woman did not seem to be the kind of evil demon.

This woman was as beautiful as her two senior sisters, so how could she be a bad person?

When Gao Shun saw that his words did not have any effect, he looked at Feng Xiyun with a pleading gaze.

Feng Xiyun immediately understood and said without hesitation, “Third Sister, Martial Uncle Gao is right. Don’t listen to this woman.”

Upon hearing this, Xiang Yun, who was initially hesitant, immediately steeled her resolve. No matter what, she would trust her senior sisters.

Therefore, she said with a straight face, “You bad person, don’t even think about deceiving me. If you try, I’ll beat you up.”

After hearing this, Mengyu’s heart trembled slightly. After seeing the shadowy figure behind Xiang Yun, she felt somewhat apprehensive. Also, this little girl seemed to be the straightforward sort, so if she really tried to wheedle her, it was very likely that this little girl would not hesitate to attack.

Even though Xiang Yun was not strong enough to do anything to her, she was afraid of the power of the shadowy figure behind her.

Who knew what measures that mighty expert had set up around Xiang Yun. If she triggered these measures, Xiang Yun might actually gain the power to defeat her, and perhaps even kill her.

Therefore, it was unwise to attack her at this moment. In any case, it was not time yet.

Mengyu then turned her gaze to Gao Shun and said, “Gao Shun, when you saw me, were you very shocked?”

Hearing this, everyone was shocked. This woman actually knew Chief Gao Shun?
