Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

However, Ye Xuan had skipped this entire process and comprehended spatial intent directly.

“Sigh, he’s quite slow!”

Ye Xuan shook his head. He then teleported into the sky and examined that unity realm expert.

The newcomer was a black-robed middle-aged man who looked to be around 50 years old.

It seemed like this person was also a genius back then, which was why he had successfully comprehended wind intent.

“You’re Ye Xuan?”

The middle-aged man’s gaze fell on ye Xuan, and murderous intent flashed across his eyes.

At the same time, the violent gusts of wind started to coalesce into a tornado.

Ye Xuan did not reply, but simply looked at the middle-aged man indifferently.

The middle-aged man’s name was Li Tiangang, and he was an inner sect elder of the Nether God sect. He was a sixth-level unity realm expert.

He had been surprised by the Seventh Prince’s message.

The experts that the Nether God sect dispatched to kill Ye Xuan were all on their way to the Qingyun sect, yet their target had appeared in the Radiant Sky Empire and killed the Radiant Sky Sovereign King and the Seventh Prince, right in their own backyard.

“You dared to kill my disciple?”

Li Tiangang took a step forward, and his vast and tyrannical aura swept out.

The cultivators of the White Moon Tower all trembled uncontrollably. The spiritual pressure he exuded forced them to kneel on the ground.

Even Dai Weibo, who was hiding in his palace, was trembling.

What a terrifying power!

If these two big shots really fought, the White Moon Tower would be destroyed!

At the thought of this, Dai Weibo felt despair.

It seemed that the White Moon Tower would not be able to escape this calamity.

However, the spiritual pressure suddenly dissipated just as it was about to reach Ye Xuan.

“Hehe! What can you do even if I did?” Ye Xuan chuckled.

“Impudent! You’re arrogant beyond belief!”

“Do you really think that your talent makes you better than everyone else?”

“A mere fourth-level unity realm cultivator is putting on airs. You’re truly courting death!”

Li Tiangang’s figure disappeared into the dark clouds after he spoke.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan did not panic. He waited for a while, and then threw a punch to his right.

Boom!

With a cracking sound, a spatial crack suddenly appeared, erupting with terrifying void power.

At the same time, their fists collided, and a destructive shockwave wreaked havoc on their surroundings.

“Oh my God!”

“Those two people are terrifying! They actually tore space apart?”

The cultivators of the White Moon Tower were watching from a distance.

When they saw the spatial crack, their eyes were filled with shock.

“What?”

After the impact, Li Tiangang took a dozen steps backward. When he felt the force of Ye Xuan’s punch, his expression changed.

Even though it was just an ordinary attack, his own punch contained the power of his sixth-level unity realm cultivation.

By right, Ye Xuan should have been instantly turned to dust. Even if something miraculous happened, Ye Xuan should still have been severely injured.

However, Ye Xuan had actually received his attack so easily.

“You’ve actually comprehended fist intent?”

Also, his power had definitely surpassed the boundaries of the fourth level of the unity realm..

Ye Xuan was even more terrifying than the rumors. Even he could not tell what the former’s exact cultivation level was.

Could it be that this fellow had also broken through to the sixth level of the unity realm?

Impossible!

How did this guy do it?

Li Tiangang’s eyes were filled with shock.

Buzzzzzz!

Li Tiangang tried to use his wind intent to put some distance between them.

However, every time he opened up a distance, Ye Xuan would easily catch up.

“Is this all a sixth-level unity realm expert is capable of?”

At this moment, Ye Xuan’s mocking voice rang out in Li Tiangang’s ears.

Li Tiangang’s expression turned extremely ugly, but he did not know how to respond.

Boom!

Explosive sounds could be heard everywhere as the two fought. The shockwaves from the impact of their fight wreaked havoc everywhere, creating countless spatial cracks.

Everyone’s eyes were filled with fear when they saw this.

What kind of f*cking level of battle was this? Even the sky was full of holes!

Even though the spatial cracks were quickly repaired by the natural spatial laws, many of the White Moon Tower’s buildings collapsed.

Cracks appeared on the ground, and chunks of those buildings were ripped off by the void power and sucked into the spatial cracks.

Boom!

Just then, a muffled groan was heard.

Ye Xuan’s punch made Li Tiangang spit out blood. The destructive power of the punch destroyed his arm, which was quickly restored. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The life force contained within the divine elements of a sixth-level unity realm was indeed abundant.

Still, it would not stop Ye Xuan from killing Li Tiangang.

Ye Xuan wanted to test the limits of the life force contained in Li Tiangang’s divine elements.

As such, Li Tiangang would have to suffer for a while.

Although the two of them were in the same realm, Ye Xuan’s physical strength far exceeded his opponent’s because he had tempered his body using the heavenly lightning bolts at the Heavenly Lightning Pool. Furthermore, he had the Sword Overlord body.

He could crush Li Tiangang with just his physical strength!
