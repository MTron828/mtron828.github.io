871 Yuelun’s Determination

Seeing the elders who had just appeared sit down cross-legged, the others were stunned. An ordinary person might not encounter such an opportunity in their lifetime, so if they did not seize the moment, they might miss this opportunity.

“What the hell are you still doing standing? Hurry up and sit down to absorb it,” Gao Shun said angrily as he glared fiercely at the disciples of Hidden Sword peak, who were still standing around foolishly.

At such an important moment, they were still in a daze. What was going on? After all, every second of absorption would yield more benefits.

After hearing Gao Shun’s words, the numerous disciples present immediately came back to their senses.

“Yes, Teacher!” A disciple pinched his thigh and said excitedly as he sat cross-legged and began to refine the power. It had only been a short while, but Cloud Sky peak was already packed with disciples. Fortunately, Ye Xuan’s power was sufficient. Otherwise, it would have been gone in a few minutes. This power was enough to support them to absorb for several days and nights.

Furthermore, it seemed that Gao Shun had a high chance of breaking through. The immortal-grade recovery pill he had consumed back then had reforged his body and increased its potential. Furthermore, the medicinal power had yet to be fully refined, so his cultivation level was constantly increasing.

It was not just Gao Shun. There was probably another person present who might be able to reach the ancient realm, which was Yuelun. From the beginning to the end, she had been silently refining the power. She realized that the gap between her and Ye Xuan was getting bigger and bigger, so she stubbornly tried her best to improve herself.

These days, she had been cultivating with all her might, and had reached the peak of the supreme realm. Perhaps with the help of this opportunity, she would be able to break through.

Beads of sweat had already appeared on her forehead, but she was still gritting her teeth and persevering, Ye Xuan felt, but he did not disturb her. He was very clear about Yuelun’s personality. She was a strong woman. If it was not for her limited talent, she would have improved greatly by cultivating so hard.

“Sigh…”

He felt unusually helpless in his heart. After all, this world was so cruel. He did not care about Yuelun’s cultivation realm at all, but Yuelun attached great importance to this matter, and it had already become a knot in her heart. Perhaps she felt that she was not worthy of him. Therefore, she had not come looking for Ye Xuan these days and had only cultivated silently by herself. Ye Xuan had also tried many times to help her, but he failed every time without exception. This also made Ye Xuan very distressed.

“Teacher…”

While Ye Xuan was lost in his thoughts, Zhuge Yueyue suddenly spoke up. Ye Xuan turned around and helplessly said, “Why are you still standing here? Why are you still not refining the power?” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

It seemed that his disciple was a little silly too. She actually did not do anything and just stood there foolishly, waiting for his instructions.

Zhuge Yueyue was momentarily stunned, before sitting down cross-legged, ready to absorb the energy. However, unexpectedly, Ye Xuan suddenly said, “Forget it, forget it. Don’t absorb the power for now and come with me.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan turned around to look at his second disciple. At present, there was no need to worry about the second disciple’s talent. However, he had to worry about the eldest disciple. After all, she was still only a mystic lord realm cultivator.

He could not be around for his disciples forever, so they would eventually have to take care of themselves. With this thought in mind, Ye Xuan decided to do something explosive. After all, he treasured this eldest disciple of his, and would not let her suffer.

“Follow me.”

After saying this, Ye Xuan instructed Feng Xiyun to handle things here. Then, he brought Zhuge Yueyue to Cloud Sky Cave. He wanted to help her cultivate. After all, he had plenty of good stuff now, which would be able to augment her strength.

As Zhuge Yueyue followed Ye Xuan into Cloud Sky Cave, she started to panic.

‘Why did Teacher bring me here?’

‘Could it be that he has something important to give me?’

Thinking this, Zhuge Yueyue got a little excited, and a bright smile appeared on her face. No matter what her teacher wanted to give her, she would be very happy.

The moment she stepped into Cloud Sky Cave, she spotted Xiang Yun, who was still unconscious.

“Third Sister…”

She moved closer to take a good look at her junior sister, but was stopped midway by Ye Xuan.

“Don’t get too close. Xiang Yun is in a critical phase. We must not disturb her.”

Hearing this, Zhuge Yueyue immediately froze. She did not dare to get closer, but her eyes were still fixed on her junior sister. These days, Cloud Sky peak was quieter without Xiang Yun around, and she and Feng Xiyun often worried about their junior sister.

“Alright, I understand that you all want Xiang Yun to wake up, but she really can’t be disturbed at this moment,” Ye Xuan said softly to calm her down.
