323 The Power Of Karma

That being said, those things were currently out of Ye Xuan’s reach. He had more important things to focus on now, chief among which was the opportunity that belonged to him in the stormy sea area. If he could obtain it, Ye Xuan would definitely be able to tread his own invincible path in this world.

It was not only that. The power of karma also indicated that the stormy sea area also held opportunities for his disciples, especially Shangguan Wan’er.

“My precious disciple, how is your comprehension of slaughter intent coming along?”

“It’s already reached the fourth level,” Shangguan Wan’er replied.

“Not bad! From now on, you should focus on tempering your spiritual sense,” Ye Xuan said.

From what he could sense, Shangguan Wan’er would comprehend perfect-level slaughter intent, and maybe even engrave another profound pattern, when she obtained her opportunity in the stormy sea area.

Thus, she needed to prepare for the sudden increase in strength. After all, slaughter intent was unlike normal martial intents. If it grew too strong for its user to handle, it would likely turn its user into a mindless killing machine.

In addition, Ye Xuan could sense that a great calamity was about to occur, and that it was related to her. The entire stormy sea area would be thrown into chaos because of her. He could also sense that it had something to do with him.

“Also, remember that the stormy sea area is dangerous, so you must not be impulsive!”

“Even if I am in danger, you must remain calm.”

Still, to Ye Xuan, the power of karma was a tool, and he was not its tool. Nothing was set in stone, and he would be the master of his own fate.

“Alright Teacher, I’ll keep that in mind.”

Shangguan Wan’er nodded doubtfully, not quite understanding why Ye Xuan was telling her this. Despite this, given the seriousness of his tone, she dutifully acknowledged his advice.

Could it be that her teacher had already predicted the future through the power of karma?

Would she do something unthinkable because she saw him in danger?

Ye Xuan did not elaborate. That being said, he wondered what sort of danger he would encounter to provoke such a reaction from Shangguan Wan’er.

According to the deduction of the power of karma, it seemed that a calamity would befall him several years after he left for the stormy sea area. Moreover, he would leave the Tianyuan continent because of this and head to another world.

The world was the opportunity he had perceived through the power of karma, and also the reason why the sea race had invaded the human race.

‘Forget it. Let’s not overthink things.’

‘At the very least, it does not seem that Yue, Qingyan and Yan’er will be in any serious danger.’

Ye Xuan took a deep breath and stopped thinking about it. If one worried too much about the future, one would miss out on the present.

Now, his role was to take his disciples to the stormy sea area to seek out opportunities. During this time, he would reap as many rewards from the system as possible to strengthen himself. In the end, strength was the safest way to guarantee his own survival.

‘The sea race is invading our territory, so it’s only natural that I repay them in kind, right?’

Ye Xuan’s eyes narrowed.

He could also sense that if he wanted to leave the Tianyuan continent, he needed to comprehend fate intent.

“Alright! Let’s go to the stormy sea area together!”

Ye Xuan flicked his sleeve, and the power of his heavenly lightning intent swept out and enveloped Shangguan Wan’er and the others. Then, they transformed into a dazzling bolt of lightning and disappeared.

Within a short period of time, they traversed through the Huangyu Zone and Tianze Zone. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Buzzzzzz!

Space rippled slightly, and then the bright purple lightning bolt flashed and disappeared, revealing the figures of Ye Xuan and his disciples.

In front of them was the boundless stormy sea area.

The sky was covered with rolling dark clouds and spitting out powerful lightning bolts, and the sea was rife with huge crashing waves.

From afar, the stormy sea was as black as ink.

Kachaa!

The surroundings were only lit up when the lightning bolts flashed and landed on the surface of the sea.

“Alright! It’s time for us to part.”

“There are also opportunities that belong to you in this stormy sea area. You have to search for them carefully.”

“Don’t worry, I’ll look for each of you every month to perform spiritual power infusion.”

“Ah? Teacher, are you not going with us? I’m kinda scared!”

Zhao Yuyan’s eyes were watery.

“Silly girl! With the trump card that I have given you, you won’t be in any danger. Moreover, these opportunities should be sought out personally.”

“In any case, if you really encounter danger, I will sense it.”

Ye Xuan smiled and patted Zhao Yuyan’s head gently.
