923 Golden Opportunity

In the ancient palace, everyone was a competitor, so there was no need to be polite.

If Ye Xuan and the beast were to suffer heavy losses, they would be the ones who benefited from it. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

After adjusting his condition, Ye Xuan recovered. The corners of his mouth once again curled into a devilish smile.

“Damn it! I haven’t felt this kind of pain in a long time.”

Ye Xuan seemed to be very satisfied at the moment. Sparks of electricity were still dancing on his skin, but Ye Xuan paid them no heed.

‘Is this the power of the Thunder-Devouring Beast? A divine beast with both spatial and lightning attributes. Its bloodline is also quite pure, and its divine runes just so happen to have resonate with the laws of lightning I comprehended.’

‘Haha. Too bad then. Its powerful lightning divine runes can’t harm me at all, and even invigorate my energy.’

Ye Xuan laughed out loud, and his smile filled with unbridled arrogance.

Others would have been injured by the divine lightning released by the Thunder-Devouring Beast, but this did not apply to Ye Xuan, and it even made him stronger.

Honestly, even Ye Xuan himself did not expect such an outcome.

It was precisely because of this that he was very excited at this moment. This was a golden opportunity for him to become stronger. When he reached the sealed immortal realm, his Endless Lightning technique had been enhanced by the lightning tribulation, but Ye Xuan did not have the chance to complete it.

Furthermore, he had used his chances to complete his other techniques and divine powers elsewhere. Thus, this was clearly a heaven-sent opportunity!

In his excitement, Ye Xuan laughed out loud.

Seeing this, Yanran was dumbfounded. She wondered if Ye Xuan had been hit in the head, and could only say worriedly, ‘Ye Xuan, if there’s really no other way, let’s just forget about this treasure. After all, there are still many other treasures in this ancient palace.”

“Don’t force yourself. Even if we miss out on this heavenly treasure, there will still be other chances in the future. If something happens to you, I’ll become a widow.”

Hearing this, the smile on Ye Xuan’s face instantly vanished. He looked at Yanran, who did not look like she was joking. Was she doubting his strength? Tsk tsk…

He straightened his back and said, “Hmph! It’s just a Thunder-Devouring Beast? I can easily deal with it. Just sit back and watch the show.”

Yanran did not know what to say. Forget it…

Ye Xuan was a good person, but sometimes, he would not listen to advice and would suffer because of his pride.

“Then you must be careful.”

Yanran also understood that Ye Xuan would definitely not stop, so she did not continue to dissuade him. However, she secretly mobilized her strength. If Ye Xuan was in danger, she would immediately rush over to help.

No matter what, he was her man. Although he was very stubborn, and had a lot of flaws, how could she let him get hurt?

After Ye Xuan made some adjustments, he took large strides forward again. At this moment, his aura seemed to have undergone a huge change, and crackled with sparks of purple lightning. It was quite literally a shocking sight!

In the sky, the Thunder-Devouring Beast roared when it saw Ye Xuan approaching. Its eyes were filled with solemnity.

It did not know what kind of trump card its opponent had, so it chose to be vigilant and careful. Once Ye Xuan stepped past a certain point, he felt that he had entered a strange space.

In this space, even though he could see the enemy right in front of him, he would not be able to reach it. This was its spatial domain.

Ye Xuan frowned and remained on guard. After all, this was a dual-attribute divine beast that was as strong as a true immortal. Although he could deal with its lightning attribute, he still had to consider its spatial attribute, as well as its physical prowess.

It was definitely the strongest opponent he had ever encountered.

On the other hand, when everyone saw Ye Xuan heading toward the Thunder-Devouring Beast again, they were shocked.

“What is he trying to do? Could it be that he really wants to fight this Thunder-Devouring Beast?”

“Does this guy not want to live anymore? Is he going to abandon his pretty wife?”

“This Thunder-Devouring Beast isn’t even suppressed by the laws of the world! He doesn’t stand a chance! Why is he being so arrogant?”

Everyone was in disbelief at what they saw. From a hiding spot, Ou Yunhai quietly watched all of this and sighed. He knew that Ye Xuan would definitely not do something like this unless he was confident that he could win.

“Sigh… He’s going to show off again…”

After saying this, Ou Yunhai did not stick around and left without hesitation.

Others might not believe that Ye Xuan could win, but he did. He had learned this much from his encounters with Ye Xuan. Thus, he set his sights on the other treasures. This one would be left to Ye Xuan.

At this moment, the atmosphere in this place became more and more solemn. If there was any sudden movement, a big battle would break out.

Both the Thunder-Devouring Beast and Ye Xuan were having a staring contest. Even though neither one had actually attacked yet, they had been simulating the fight in their minds for hundreds of rounds.

It was as if they were the only two beings in existence in this world, and they were fully focused on each other.
