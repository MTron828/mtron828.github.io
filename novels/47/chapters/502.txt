503 The Opening Of The Ancient Tomb

The corners of Ye Xuan’s mouth curled up into a beautiful arc.

Hehe! This old man was getting anxious.

Just as Ye Xuan was about to speak, Su Changhe, who was next to him, suddenly had a stroke of genius and interjected.

“Reincarnation Fairy, I have to tell you that Chief Ye Xuan is the best teacher in the entire Great Wilderness Divine sect.”

“He’s not stingy with his disciples, and has taught them heaven-rank cultivation techniques and heaven-rank divine powers.”

“He even gave the precious bone of a heaven realm ancient beast descendant to his disciple without hesitation.”

As soon as he finished speaking, everyone around him was stunned.

“Are you f*cking joking? The precious bone of a heaven realm ancient beast descendant?”

“Is Chief Ye Xuan’s disciple his son or daughter? It would only make sense if that was the case.”

Everyone’s eyes narrowed in shock.

Su Changhe’s words almost made Ye Xuan laugh out loud.

‘This kid is quite capable. He’s quite reliable at critical moments.’

Hearing this, the Reincarnation Fairy was shocked.

Was this for real? Was there a teacher in the world who treated his disciples so well?

“Cough cough…”

Hearing this, Chu Tianba, could not help but cough again. He was a little flustered.

He quickly glared at Su Changhe and almost slapped him.

In order to prevent his own disciple from being poached, Chu Tianba quickly changed the topic.

“Fellow Daoist Ye Xuan, now that the battle between the great beasts is at a stalemate. When do you think it will end?”

Ye Xuan looked at Chu Tianba indifferently, then shrugged his shoulders.

“Who knows? Let them fight. We should talk about our own business.”

Chu Tianba’s face darkened.

This guy was definitely doing this on purpose. He was really too much.

Were it not for the fact that he could not beat him, Chu Tianba would probably have started a fight with Ye Xuan.

“My precious disciple, you must be tired from running around the archaic divine mountains. You should get some rest.”

“I’ll ask your uncle Situ to give you a few pills to adjust your body’s condition.”

Helplessly, Chu Tianba could only change his strategy and try to get his disciple to leave.

She wanted to refuse, but Chu Tianba was her teacher after all, so she nodded obediently.

“Yes, Teacher. I’ll head off first then.”

“Mm! Hurry up and get some rest.”

A smile finally appeared on Chu Tianba’s face, and he looked at Ye Xuan proudly.

‘Hehe! Although I can’t beat you, do you really think I have no other way?’

With her departure, the plan to poach a disciple was ruined.

Su Changhe looked regretful.

‘This old man is so evil. He actually thought of such a despicable method to change the outcome. How detestable…’

‘I didn’t even get a chance to show off!’

How could Chu Tianba not notice the change in Su Changhe’s expression?

‘This brat is too detestable. If it wasn’t for my quick reaction, even if the reincarnation fairy didn’t agree immediately, she would have wavered.’

She was the Saintess of the Jade Lake Divine sect that he had worked so hard to cultivate. How could he allow such a thing to happen?

However, Chu Tianba could not help but take a deep breath when he recalled what Su Changhe had said.

‘Is this guy really so generous toward his disciples? Was he the kind of person who could casually impart cultivation resources and high-rank divine powers to others? Doesn’t he need them for himself?’

Chu Tianba was very confused. He had cultivated for hundreds of years and had seen many things, but he had never seen a teacher like Ye Xuan.

Cultivation resources were limited, and divine powers were rare in the mystic world. These things were prized and treasured by all cultivators. Who would deign to give such things to their disciples?

After all, one’s own personal cultivation was paramount. This was why he was dumbfounded to hear of these things about Ye Xuan.

However, just as he was deep in thought, another change occurred.

Boom!

A mushroom cloud of energy erupted, causing the world to change colors and cracks to appear on the ground.

“What happened?”

Everyone’s eyes widened in shock.

The Zhuyan roared toward the sky, and it swung its staff ferociously toward the black tortoise’s shell. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

At the same time, the heaven devouring divine sparrow’s wings began to flap wildly. Every feather was filled with the power of true fire. It dived down from the sky, looking for an opportunity to take the coffin away.

At this moment, the black tortoise suddenly became angry. Its body erupted with unparalleled strength as it lifted its feet and smashed them into the ground. Spatial cracks appeared all around it as two huge holes appeared in the ground.

The entire area trembled violently as a strange force surged out of the holes.

At this moment, a golden divine light suddenly blossomed from the depths of the archaic divine mountains. A huge ancient tomb rose up, and the extremely tough barrier around it slowly dissipated.

...

“Oh my god! The ancient tomb has opened!”

“Everyone, hurry up! There are definitely heavenly treasures inside…”

In that instant, the entire archaic divine mountains were thrown into an uproar because of this. Countless cultivators turned into streaks of light and fought to be the first to enter the ancient tomb.

Roar!

At this moment, the clouds in the sky erupted with scarlet lightning bolts that flashed toward those cultivators, striking those in the forefront and turning them into dust.

“The ancient tomb actually opened at this time?”

When Ye Xuan saw this, he did not choose to enter the ancient tomb immediately. Instead, his eyes fell on the four great beasts.

After the ancient tomb appeared, the black tortoise suddenly let out an ear-piercing scream. Its huge body turned into a brilliant golden streak of light and flew toward the ancient tomb.

Seeing this, the rest of the great beasts hurriedly followed, trying their best to catch up to it.
