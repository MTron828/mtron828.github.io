464 The Decisive Battle (Part 1)

Boom!

Powerful sword attacks collided with each other, and bright sparks burst out, causing the entire arena to tremble.

One had to admit that Bai Xuanyuan’s strength was extremely terrifying. He could even withstand Zhuge Yueyue’s heavenly slash.

“Junior Zhuge, how was my sword strike?”

Seeing that he was on par with Zhuge Yueyue, Bai Xuanyuan smiled and gradually became more confident.

“Not bad!” Zhuge Yueyue nodded.

Moments later, Zhuge Yueyue’s aura underwent a tremendous change. A terrifying power of ice suddenly rippled out.

The smile on Bai Xuanyuan’s face froze!

“What is this…”

As the power of ice swept over, Bai Xuanyuan could feel his soul trembling.

At this moment, the Cloud Sky Sword emitted dazzling light as the heavenly slash was used again. Zhuge Yueyue did not want to reveal too much of her strength. After all, Gao Tianyu was her final opponent!

However, it would be even worse if she continued to waste her energy on Bai Xuanyuan, so it would be better to reveal some of her strength and end the battle quickly.

As the cold aura surrounded Zhuge Yueyue, a half-moon shaped sword attack soared into the sky before descending upon Bai Xuanyuan.

Everyone’s expression changed drastically when they saw this.

Even Gongsun Shouyue was shocked by this, and he clutched the sides of the chair he was sitting on with both hands.

“Heaven-grade secret technique!”

As an expert at the peak of the mystic lord realm, Gongsun Shouyue could naturally sense the terrifying power of ice contained in Zhuge Yueyue’s body.

When Gao Shun saw this, his eyes narrowed slightly.

‘As expected, this little girl really did keep a trump card… Hmph! Fortunately, I prepared more than one!’

Thinking this, he smiled coldly.

Bai Xuanyuan’s face turned pale and his body trembled slightly as he looked at the dazzling half-moon shaped sword attack in the sky.

He had no way to retreat. He could only muster all of his strength to try and resist the attack. However, this heavenly slash was much stronger than the one before, and far more than he could handle.

Bang! Bang!

Moments later, Bai Xuanyuan was sent flying like a cannonball, and his body crashed outside the arena.

“I… I’ve lost …”

Bai Xuanyuan’s face was pale as he struggled. His expression was one of depression.

He could not understand how he had lost to a newcomer.

Was the standard of teaching at Cloud Sky peak really so monstrous?

In fact, Bai Xuanyuan was not the only one who was thinking this. The crowd was also thinking likewise.

Zhuge Yueyue slowly descended from the sky.

After putting away the Cloud Sky Sword, she waited quietly for the final match to begin.

Over the past three months, she had put in countless efforts in order to become stronger. She had been waiting for this day. She would repay Gao Shun for insulting her teacher.

…

In the other arena, after a few rounds of fighting, Li Hanyi had gradually become exhausted.

Gao Tianyu’s strength was too terrifying. Even if Li Hanyi used all of her strength, she failed to make Gao Tianyu use his trump card.

Yuelun knew that the outcome was already decided.

At the thought of this, she helplessly sighed.

It seemed that her disciple could only make it this far. That being said, she was still quite satisfied with this result. After all, Water Sky peak had always ranked second to last in the previous competitions.

“Teacher, I’m sorry… I couldn’t win…”

Li Hanyi’s body trembled slightly as tears welled up in her beautiful eyes. She was unwilling to accept this, as she felt guilty about disappointing her teacher.

Yuelun r smiled and gently wiped away the latter’s tears.

“Silly Girl, what’s there to be sad about? I’m already very satisfied that you managed to reach the top four.”

After this battle, the finalists were decided, and the final match was about to get underway.

Ye Xuan’s relaxed expression turned serious.

Zhuge Yueyue stood on the stage with a calm expression.

In front of her was Gao Tianyu.

Gao Tianyu’s eyes turned cold as he recalled the humiliation he and his father had suffered at the hands of Cloud Sky peak.

At this moment, it felt as if there were sparks flying between the two and the atmosphere was very tense.

“Hahaha! Finally, the most exciting battle for the competition has arrived. I wonder who will be the final victor?”

“Cloud Sky peak and Hidden Sword peak have always been at odds with each other in the Great Wilderness divine sect. I didn’t expect them to encounter each other in the finals.”

Everyone’s eyes were burning with passion as they stared at the two people in the arena.

“Are you two ready?”

The judge looked at the two of them.

Zhuge Yueyue nodded her head indifferently and did not say anything.

“Judge, please announce the start of the match,” Gao Tianyu said in a cold tone.

In the semifinal matches, Zhuge Yueyue had finished off Bai Xuanyuan in the shortest time possible, and did not consume much of her spiritual power.

In comparison, in order to defeat Li Hanyi, who had gone all out, Gao Tianyu had consumed more spiritual power.

However, what surprised everyone was that Gao Tianyu seemed to be unfazed by this, and even seemed to be full of confidence.
