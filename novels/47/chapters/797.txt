798 Ticking Time Bomb

Mengyu took a closer look and realized that Xiang Yun’s terrifying aura was related to her mood.

If the person she cared about the most was injured, then this little girl’s emotions would fluctuate greatly. The seal in her body would be weakened, and she would naturally be able to release even stronger power.

Thinking of this, Mengyu glanced at Zhuge Yueyue who was severely injured.

“Third Sister, I am fine. Don’t worry.”

Zhuge Yueyue did not even bother with her injuries. She rushed over to Xiang Yun’s side without hesitation and comforted her. She was afraid that this might happen, so she had asked Su Changhe to bring her back to Cloud Sky peak earlier.

However, she did not expect that Xiang Yun would rush back here the moment she woke up.

Gao Shun and Ao Lei were also aware of the matter, and they exchanged glances with each other. That being said, this little girl had indeed saved them by scaring this skeleton away.

At this moment, Xiang Yun’s eyes were bloodshot. Waves of shocking power were being released from her body, and it seemed that her power would erupt completely soon.

Under the pressure of this terrifying aura, everyone lowered their heads, not daring to look at her at all.

Left with no choice, Zhuge Yueyue could only hold Xiang Yun tightly in her arms and use her spiritual power to stabilize the seal in Xiang Yun’s body.

However, Xiang Yun had completely lost control, which meant that the seal would probably be completely removed soon.

At this moment, everyone began to panic, including Mengyu.

She only wanted to settle the old scores with the Great Wilderness Divine sect. She did not want to provoke such a terrifying expert at all.

If Xiang Yun’s seal was unleashed, then all of her previous efforts would be ruined.

“Leave!”

Mengyu gave the order without hesitation and turned around to leave. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

However, at this moment, Ye Xuan appeared out of thin air and appeared beside Xiang Yun. He grabbed her small hand tightly and sent a calming stream of spiritual power into her body.

“Junior Brother!”

Gao Shun was very surprised and immediately looked toward Daoist Yi Feng, only to discover that the vengeful spirits had all been dealt with.

After Daoist Yi Feng closed the door to reincarnation, he quietly floated in the air and turned his gaze to Mengyu.

The two of them looked at each other, but no one spoke.

On the other side, Ye Xuan was still beside Xiang Yun. The three Dao Flowers in his body were in full bloom, emitting their power to help Xiang Yun consolidate the seal in her body.

Originally, Ye Xuan wanted to teach her a cultivation technique so that she could maintain her calm.

However, what left him helpless was that this little girl could not even read. How could she learn this kind of mental-type cultivation technique?

The difference between this cultivation technique and the Endless Lightning technique was that it could not be comprehended by demonstration and observation. One had to comprehend the meaning of the cultivation technique before they could truly master it.

It was precisely because of this that Ye Xuan had not dealt with this matter up till now, and remained at a loss as to how to resolve it.

After completely strengthening the hidden seal in her body, Ye Xuan finally relaxed. Before this, Xiang Yun was not so affected by her emotions. She was usually happy-go-lucky and would not care about other things at all.

Perhaps what the other kids had said to her at the study hall back then had affected her more than he imagined.

After that, every time Xiang Yun saw the people around her being injured, her heart would fluctuate greatly. She could not control her emotions at all.

“Teacher…”

Once Xiang Yun finally recovered, the pale Zhuge Yueyue heaved a sigh of relief.

Seeing the blood still dripping from the corner of his disciple’s mouth, Ye Xuan’s anger was aroused. After helping her wipe it clean, he instructed, “Stay here and take good care of your third sister. I will go and settle this matter first.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan passed the unconscious Xiang Yun to Zhuge Yueyue and soared into the sky.

His heart was already filled with killing intent, and his gaze was fixed on the skeleton below Mengyu’s feet.

With a casual wave of his hand, the Godsword appeared in Ye Xuan’s hand.

“Mengyu, let’s end our grudges today,” Daoist Yi Feng coldly said. He stood with his hands behind his back and released the aura of a peak-level ancient realm expert.

Everyone was stunned.

When did Daoist Yi Feng reach the peak of the ancient realm?

Was it due to the merit power he obtained by sending the vengeful spirits into the reincarnation door? Evidently, that seemed to be the case.

Based on the current situation, he only needed a little more to reach the sealed immortal realm that people could only dream about.
