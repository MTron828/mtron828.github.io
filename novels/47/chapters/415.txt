416 A Useless Teammate

Everyone looked up.

In the sky, a man in white was approaching with a sword in his hand.

“It’s Teacher!”

“Teacher is finally back!”

Feng Xiyun and Zhuge Yueyue’s faces were filled with excitement as they looked at the figure in the sky.

Compared to their excitement, the crowd was feeling shock instead.

One of the elders of the Immortal Divine sect was a mystic lord realm expert. Even so, it had taken all three of them to block Ye Xuan’s sword qi.

“Is that Ye Xuan?”

“He’s really young!”

The Reincarnation Fairy’s eyes flickered with a strange light.

She had never heard of Ye Xuan before. Then, when the rumors started appearing, she had chalked it up to exaggeration.

However, she had now witnessed his strength with her own eyes.

“Wasn’t he supposed to be a heaven realm expert? When did he reach the mystic lord realm?”

“I’m not sure,” Situ Mo shook his head and sighed deeply.

“I didn’t expect the Great Wilderness Divine sect to have another mystic lord realm expert. It seems that their influence is going to become even stronger.”

“Ye Xuan’s sword qi was extremely terrifying. Even I can’t match his attainments in the Sword Dao.”

The Reincarnation Fairy was surprised by this.

“Uncle Situ, that can’t be right. He’s only an early-stage mystic lord realm expert, while you’re a middle-stage mystic lord realm expert.”

“Sometimes, a person’s cultivation level doesn’t necessarily determine their true combat prowess. Ye Xuan is a good example of this.”

“I can sense extremely obscure traces of sword intent on him. In addition, Chief Tian Xuan never spoke of his origin in detail back then. This guy most likely ascended from a lower realm.”

“The obscure traces of sword intent are very likely to be from sword intent he comprehended in the lower realm that were erased by the realm passageway when he reconstructed his body.”

Hearing Situ Mo’s words, the Reincarnation Fairy became even more curious.

Everyone knew that anyone who could ascend from a lower plane was a peerless genius with outstanding talent.

Of course, this was a double-edged sword. If these peerless geniuses did not awaken a divine bone, their cultivation talent would naturally be far inferior to the inhabitants of the mystic world.

Mu Beichen and his two guardians were equally shocked by Ye Xuan’s sword qi.

That unparalleled sense of oppression swept over everyone, making them unable to raise their heads. Those from Tian Xuan’s generation could not help but recall his invincible feats back then.

It seemed that his successor was equally as domineering!

Su Changhe was the first to react. He immediately ran over to flatter the man. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

After seeing Ye Xuan appear, he finally heaved a sigh of relief.

The situation just now was too scary. If Ye Xuan had not appeared, he would not have known what to do.

“Hehe! I’d like to see who dares to make a move on us now.”

Ye Xuan suddenly felt that this was quite ridiculous. After he appeared, the one who was most excited was not Feng Xiyun or Zhuge Yueyue, but this guy.

If someone who did not know any better saw this, they might think that this guy was Ye Xuan’s disciple.

Seeing this, Feng Xiyun could not help but cover her mouth and laugh.

Zhuge Yueyue, on the other hand, looked at Su Changhe with a face full of disdain. Then, she quickly knelt down and kowtowed to Ye Xuan with a respectful look.

“Yueyue greets Teacher!”

“Mm! My precious disciple, hurry up and get up,” Ye Xuan smiled and nodded. A gentle force helped Zhuge Yueyue up.

Ye Xuan’s eyes glinted coldly as he looked at Sun Mobai and the others.

He had only left for a short while, and someone had actually bullied his disciples. Furthermore, they had also made light of the Great Wilderness Divine sect.

“If I remember correctly, you were the one who said that even if the sect master of the Great Wilderness Divine sect was here, he would have to be polite to you, right?”

“Based on this sentence, should I assume that the Immortal Divine sect is declaring war on the Great Wilderness Divine sect?”

Hearing this, Sun Mobai’s expression changed. He knew that things had taken a bad turn.

When Li Siyuan heard this, his face darkened. He was just acting cool in front of everyone just now. How was he supposed to know that Ye Xuan would show up suddenly?

How the f*ck was he going to extricate himself from this situation?

Gongsun Shouyue was the sect master of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, and a peak-level mystic lord realm expert. Why would he need to be polite to him?

“Ahem, Fellow Daoist Ye Xuan, it was all a misunderstanding.”

“Senior Brother Li didn’t mean it that way. It was just a slip of the tongue. I hope Chief Ye Xuan won’t take it to heart,” Sun Mobai hurriedly said with an apologetic smile. In his heart, he was almost cursing all eighteen generations of Li Siyuan’s ancestors.

Originally, it was just a small matter that he could solve by himself. At most, he would compensate Feng Xiyun and Zhuge Yueyue with some artifacts.

Yet this brainless senior brother of his had suddenly intervened and involved the sect master of the Great Wilderness Divine sect instead.

What would happen if Gongsun Shouyue got wind of this?

The sect master was a domineering person as well, the kind of person who would beat up whoever he did not like. If things were not dealt with properly, the Great Wilderness Divine sect might really declare war on the Immortal Divine sect.

“Hehe! A slip of the tongue?”

Ye Xuan’s lips curled into a cold smile.

“I don’t think so. If I hadn’t appeared in time, my two precious disciples would have been killed by you lot!”

“You three old fogeys are really shameless. You’re bullying the weak with your cultivation. You’ve completely thrown away the dignity of the Immortal Divine sect.”

Sun Mobai felt ashamed and embarrassed.

It really was not his fault!

It was that brain-dead Li Siyuan who had insisted on showing off!

As Sun Mubai was thinking about how to calm Ye Xuan’s anger, Li Siyuan’s violent temper flared up again.

“So what if I wanted to bully your disciple? What can you do about it?”

As a mystic lord realm expert, he was extremely proud, so he could not tolerate Ye Xuan’s words.
