390 Precious Bone In Hand

“Damn it! No matter what, I can’t let that old man obtain the precious bone!”

Yuelun was about to send a voice transmission to Ye Xuan, but then noticed that he was already in front of the ape.

He glanced at the elder of the Immortal Divine sect, and a cold smile appeared on his face.

“With me around, who would dare to covet the precious bone of this ape beast?” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Ye Xuan clenched his fist, and another blade of grass appeared. Sword qi filled the sky before a thunderous strike slashed toward the ape beast.

!!

“Damn it! This guy is too strong, we have to stop him!”

The gray-robed elder who shouted was Sun Mobai, an elder of the Immortal Divine sect.

Now that the ape beast was being restrained by multiple heaven realm cultivators, it could barely move. It was the best time to take the precious bone.

At this moment, a heaven realm expert suddenly attacked Ye Xuan to stop him.

However, Ye Xuan was as fast as lightning, and he dodged the attack as his sword strike simultaneously landed on the ape beast.

“Roar!”

The powerful sword qi left a deep wound on the ape beast and it let out a furious roar. However, it was losing its strength rapidly due to its severe injuries. The precious bone that was originally shining brightly was starting to dim.

Seeing it severely injured, many of the heaven realm cultivators could no longer restrain themselves, and used their strongest divine powers in an attempt to wrest the precious bone away.

However, they were no match for Ye Xuan in terms of speed. His grass sword carved out the precious bone with methodical precision.

“Detestable! I’ll get you for this!”

Sun Mobai cursed. Murderous intent flashed across the depths of his eyes. He was prepared to attack Ye Xuan while he was carving out the precious bone.

At this moment, he sensed Yuelun’s gaze, which was locked onto Sun Mobai.

“Damn it! They are in cahoots!” When Sun Mobai saw this, his expression turned extremely ugly.

Helplessly, Sun Mobai could only choose to give up.

“Who is that person?”

For a moment, everyone’s eyes were filled with shock.

This guy had already reached the heaven realm at such a young age. In time, he would definitely become a top-notch expert in the mystic world.

Once a cultivator reached the mystic lord realm, they could be considered overlords of a region.

Even the Yangli divine empire would not dare to rashly provoke a mystic lord realm expert.

“Thiatperson is the youngest chief of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, and the master of Cloud Sky peak, Ye Xuan!”

At this moment, someone answered everyone’s doubts.

The person who spoke up was also a cultivator from the Great Wilderness Divine sect, so he was naturally no stranger to Ye Xuan.

“What?”

“That young man is the Cloud Sky peak’s chief?”

Everyone’s eyes widened in shock.

However, it all made sense now.

The Great Wilderness Divine sect had existed for tens of millions of years and was an extremely powerful holy land. It was not unusual for a few geniuses to appear every generation.

However, Ye Xuan seemed particularly capable, severely injuring two heaven realm experts with a single sword strike, and then taking the precious bone of the ape beast despite countless competitors.

He was too eye-catching!

“The Great Wilderness Divine sect?”

Hearing this, Sun Mobai squinted his eyes, and then a smile appeared on his face.

“Hahaha! I was just wondering who it was. I didn’t expect it to be a cultivator from the Great Wilderness Divine sect. It’s a pleasure to meet you.”

After Ye Xuan put the ape beast’s precious bone into his storage ring, he looked at Sun Mobai indifferently.

“And you are?”

“I am Sun Mobai, an elder of the Immortal Divine sect. I am a good friend of Chief Gao Shun.”

“Fellow Daoist has shown off your remarkable abilities and surprised me. If you don’t mind, we can be friends,” Sun Mobai said with a smile.

Although it was a pity that he could not get the precious bone, making a powerful friend was not bad either.

However, mentioning Gao Shun was the wrong thing to do in this case.

“Gao Shun?”

“Since that’s the case, there’s no need to get to know each other!”

Ye Xuan looked at him indifferently, and then turned around and left.

Now that he had obtained the precious bone, it was time for him to leave.

When Sun Mobai saw Ye Xuan’s reaction, his eyes were filled with confusion.

What the f*ck was going on?

Was he not just smiling a little just now?

What changed?

“Wait, can it be that this guy isn’t on good terms with Gao Shun?”

Sun Mobai was a wily old fox, and he immediately thought of the reason.

Seeing Ye Xuan had returned, Yuelun said with a smile, “Congratulations, Junior Brother Ye. As a descendant of an ancient beast, the precious bone of that ape beast is extremely precious.”

“With its help, I’m sure that Junior Brother will be able to reach the mystic lord realm in no time at all!”

At the thought of this, Yuelun felt a little envious.

Ye Xuan naturally noticed the change in Yuelun’s expression, but he could only shrug. The ape beast’s precious bone was indeed very useful to him.

“It was all just luck!”

“Just now, if Senior Sister had not lent me a hand, I would definitely not have been able to obtain the precious bone so easily,” Ye Xuan said with a smile.
