381 Su Changhe

Ye Xuan suddenly thought of something. With a wave of his sleeve, a bright streak of light suddenly flashed, and a storage ring appeared in his hand shortly after.

“This is a storage ring. It contains a dimensional space and can be used to store items.”

“As cultivators, we naturally have many spiritual pills and treasures with us when we travel in the mystic world. It would be inconvenient to carry them around with us.”

“As such, most cultivators carry a storage ring with them.”

“This is the first time my precious disciple is going out for training, so I’ll give you this storage ring.”

After that, Ye Xuan taught her how to use the storage ring.

“Many thanks, Teacher,” Zhuge Yueyue said happily.

She was always happy to receive a gift from him.

At this moment, a system notification suddenly rang out in Ye Xuan’s mind.

“Ding! As the host has given his disciple a yellow-rank storage ring, the host has received a randomized 100x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained a black-rank storage ring!”

Ye Xuan’s eyes lit up.

A brand new storage ring suddenly appeared in the system’s storage space. Ye Xuan checked it slightly and found that not only was the dimensional space of this storage ring wider, but it also had a function that surprised Ye Xuan.

This storage ring could store living things!

‘It’s really a product of the system. A high-quality product!’

The corners of Ye Xuan’s mouth curled up.

“Teacher, when are we leaving?”

“What’s the matter?” Zhuge Yueyue asked Ye Xuan after she refined the storage ring with her blood and put it on happily.

Ye Xuan did not answer. Instead, he looked in the direction of the other peaks.

At this moment, countless streaks of light suddenly emerged from the various peaks, each representing the figure of a cultivator.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan smiled.

“Alright! We should also set off too!”

With the invitation of the Yangli divine dynasty, the chiefs sent almost all of their disciples, and even led the group themselves.

Cloud Sky peak turned out in full force.

Well, there were only two of them anyway.

Moreover, all of the holy lands in the East Continent were dispatching cultivators. It seemed almost like a giant clash between cultivators and beasts was about to take place.

Ye Xuan waved his sleeve, and a longsword appeared in the sky. Then, he said to Zhuge Yueyue softly, “Yueyue, let’s go!”

He did not use the Cloud Heaven sword as it would be too eye-catching. After all, the current goal was to train Zhuge Yueyue, not to show off.

“En!” Zhuge Yueyue nodded and summoned the Cloud Sky sword. She used the sword controlling technique like Ye Xuan and soon caught up with the rest.

With the support of the profound ice divine bone, Zhuge Yueyue’s comprehension ability was pretty good, so it only took her a few days to grasp the basics.

Unlike Ye Xuan, who had spent decades mastering the sword controlling technique before the system reawakened.

Some time later, on the vast territory of the East continent.

Two bright streaks of light flashed past, and then the figures of Ye Xuan and Zhuge Yueyue appeared.

There were ruins and debris everywhere on the ground. The once prosperous town had long been razed to the ground. Smoke filled the area, and there were still drops of blood on the buildings that had been burned to the ground.

As far as his eyes could see, there were piles of corpses everywhere, which attracted a murder of crows. Not far away, there were a few vultures, eating the corpses of humans and beasts. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

When Zhuge Yueyue saw this, she felt nauseated and almost vomited.

‘It seems that this berserk beast riot has indeed caused a great impact on the East Continent. This originally prosperous town has been left in ruins.’

‘Are the berserk beasts instigating this on their own, or is someone behind all of this?’

Ye Xuan frowned as he thought to himself.

This was the East continent of the mystic world, and a territory of the human race.

Under the rule of the holy lands and divine empires, it had always been peaceful and prosperous. Such attacks had never happened before, so something was indeed not right.

Ta ta ta!

At this moment, a series of footsteps could be heard from not far away.

Zhuge Yueyue looked toward the source of the sound and saw a powerful shockwave suddenly spread out, shattering a building. Then, the figures of a group of cultivators appeared.

The one in the lead was a red-robed man in luxurious attire. His eyes were filled with arrogance.

“Tsk tsk tsk! Truly miserable! In such a prosperous town, all of the people died, hehe.”

“Na na na! Presumably, this little beauty’s affection was also like a flower or a jade. What a pity! Before you even had the chance to enjoy this young master’s pampering, you’ve already died under the brutal paws of a vicious beast.”

The red-robed man walked up to a lady’s corpse. He picked up a stick and touched the lady’s clothes with a playful expression. His eyes were filled with schadenfreude.

The man in red was Su Changhe. He was a disciple of the Yangli divine empire, and a direct descendant of the Su family.

“Young master, although it’s a pity that this little beauty is dead, isn’t there another living little beauty over there?”

Just as Su Changhe was feeling a little regretful, his lackey rolled his eyes and pointed at Zhuge Yueyue who was not far away.

Su Changhe looked up.

Zhuge Yueyue’s graceful figure in white appeared in his line of sight, and his gaze froze.

As a disciple of the Su family, he had seen countless beauties, but he had never seen anyone as cold and extraordinary as Zhuge Yueyue!

“Tsk tsk tsk! This is really interesting. I didn’t expect to meet a peerless beauty in this broken town. It seems like the heavens are watching over me!”

Su Changhe licked his lips. His eyes were filled with excitement.

He put his hands behind his back and walked toward Zhuge Yueyue with a perverted expression on his face.

“Little fairy, I’m Su Changhe, a direct descendant of the Su family of the Yangli divine empire. How should I address you? This young master has a few jugs of good wine, why don’t you and I drink and have some fun?”

Hearing this, Zhuge Yueyue frowned. Her eyes were filled with disgust as she spoke expressionlessly.

“Get lost!”

Zhuge Yueyue had witnessed the latter’s actions just now.

At first, Zhuge Yueyue had admired Su Changhe’s handsome face. After all, he was a feast for the eyes. However, that handsome exterior concealed a demented pervert!

Who knew that this guy would actually do such a thing? He dared to disrespect and sully a corpse. It was really disgusting beyond words!
