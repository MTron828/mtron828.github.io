295 Massacre

“You’re Ye Xuan?”

“How can you be so strong?”

A soul emerged from the destroyed body.

Was this f*cking for real?

How could this guy’s strength be so different from the rumors?

Even if this guy was freakishly talented, this level of strength was utterly ridiculous!

Only a King realm cultivator could destroy his body using just physical strength.

Could this guy be a King realm expert?

His heart was filled with doubt. All of this was too strange.

Furthermore, Ye Xuan had found him as soon as he had arrived in the Nanzhou Region. That was definitely not a coincidence.

Could it be that this guy had the ability to predict the future?

At the thought of this, the expert’s soul trembled.

Ye Xuan did not waste any more time and pointed his finger, annihilating the soul.

A peerless genius of the Hidden God Hall had fallen!

“Isn’t this guy too weak?” Ye Xuan muttered to himself.

His current control over his own power had only reached 80%, yet he could easily kill a seven-pattern condensation realm expert.

If he could perfectly control his power, he should be able to resist some ordinary king realm experts.

Buzzzzzz!

Moments later, Ye Xuan once again transformed into a lightning bolt and disappeared.

When he reappeared, Ye Xuan traveled through the spatial turbulence and appeared in front of another seven-path condensation realm expert.

The same scene repeated itself.

The power of karma allowed him to trace the karmic lines to locate his enemies.

Soon after, similar scenes happened in other places in rapid succession. Ye Xuan could travel vast distances in mere moments as a lightning bolt.

Most of these seven-pattern condensation realm experts were acting under the orders of a king realm expert. Although the king realm experts could not act personally thanks to the deterrence of the ancestor of the Divine Gate Holy Land, they could still send their subordinates.

However, all of this was predicated on their subordinates actually being strong enough to kill Ye Xuan, which was clearly not the case.

That being said, some of these subordinates had king realm jade tokens with them, which posed a danger to Ye Xuan. However, because Ye Xuan could roughly gauge the danger level through the power of karma, he chose to use his transformed lightning bolt form against these subordinates.

Even though it was weaker than his physical body, its speed allowed him to dodge the jade tokens when they were activated.

Soon, all of these subordinates were killed by Ye Xuan.

When news of this spread throughout the Huangyu Zone, it shocked the cultivation world.

All of those who had targeted the Qingyun sect had fallen!

This stunned the King realm experts who had dispatched them.

Who was the one behind this?

Was it Ye Xuan? Or was there some other hidden expert?

The Huangyu Zone was vast, and had a population of hundreds of billions, yet there were very few King realm experts, and outside of those old monsters who were all in seclusion, they all knew each other, and had pretty good relationships with each other.

It was due to this that they dared to act against Ye Xuan. Even though the ancestor of the Divine Gate Holy Land had restrained them from personally acting, nothing much could be said or done if their subordinates were the ones taking actions.

If they could snatch the Tower of Heaven without killing Ye Xuan, that would naturally be for the best.

However, even if their subordinates accidentally killed Ye Xuan, the ancestor of the Divine Gate Holy Land would not fall out with them over the death of a single genius.

In the end, they were left stunned. All of their subordinates had died, and within a short span of time too. Despite providing them with king realm jade tokens, these peerless Heaven’s Blessed had failed their mission!
