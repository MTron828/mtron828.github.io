627 It’s My Turn Now

At Hidden Sword peak, Gao Tianyu, who had been immersed in cultivation, suddenly felt a chill run down his spine. He had a bad feeling.

“What’s going on? Why do I feel like this? Has something gone wrong with my cultivation?” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Gao Tianyu racked his head to try and figure it out, but to no avail. After some time, he gave up. In any case, his father should be able to protect him from such unknown dangers, right?

What could possibly happen?

“That’s enough, Yun’er.”

Seeing her dance around in joy, Ye Xuan had a feeling that he had done something bad. It was fine though, right?

“You’ve reached the peak of the foundation establishment realm now, and will be able to break through and reach the divine mystic realm soon.”

“For now, go and rest. At the same time, familiarize yourself with the flow of spiritual power I taught you earlier. Once you have done that, circulate your spiritual power according to that flow a few times. It will be helpful for your cultivation.”

“You need a solid foundation to ensure that your cultivation path will be smooth. Do you understand? ”

Xiang Yun was stunned. She did not really understand much of what he was talking about, but understood that her master would not lie to her, so following his instructions would be in her best interests.

After nodding her head, Xiang Yun ran away again.

Shortly after, Zhuge Yueyue felt very aggrieved. She had completely immersed herself in cultivation, but had been jolted out of her state of immersion by Xiang Yun to accompany the latter to catch some beasts at the rear of the mountain.

Left with no other choice, Zhuge Yueyue could only tag along, and decided to wait until night fell to cultivate again.

After Xiang Yun left, Ye Xuan put away the Boundless Cauldron and returned to the Cloud Sky Palace.

Next, it was his turn to refine his body.

“What kind of changes will happen when I practice both internal and external cultivation?”

Ye Xuan muttered to himself.

Ordinary people were already satisfied cultivating spiritual power, as refining one’s body required a huge amount of resources, and even had requirements for the cultivator’s talent.

However, if they could achieve this, his strength would be able to improve greatly, and he would be able to bridge the gaps in cultivation levels to fight stronger opponents.

Ye Xuan believed that he could succeed in both internal and external cultivation. After all, his talent was basically unparalleled thanks to the system, which also gave him an immense amount of materials and heavenly treasures to practice body refining cultivation.

Since he had already made his choice, Ye Xuan did not hesitate and began to concoct his body refining solution. Unlike Xiang Yun’s, he only used high-grade ones, including the earth root grass, as he could tolerate a higher concentration medicinal solution.

After mixing many herbs together, the solution turned dark green. Once it was completely mixed, Ye Xuan used his spiritual sense to release the full medicinal power of each herb.

Then, he got into the cauldron.

Moments later, a vast amount of spiritual energy surged into his body. Ye Xuan felt his skin burning, making him feel indescribable pain.

He quickly adapted to it, and then began to activate the body refining technique to absorb the energy into his body.

Only a few seconds had passed, yet Ye Xuan had already reached the foundation establishment realm, and was advancing rapidly. SOon, he reached the peak of the foundation establishment realm.

Following that, he took another step forward, and broke through to the divine mystic realm.

“Woah!”

Ye Xuan was shocked by his own speed of progress, which had exceeded Xiang Yun’s.

Well, perhaps him already being an advanced-stage supreme realm cultivator had something to do with it. Either way, the end result was the same.

After absorbing one heavenly treasure after another, he broke through to the materialization realm in just over an hour.

However, that was not enough. Ye Xuan’s goal was for his body refining cultivation to reach the same level as his spiritual cultivation.

Although this would have been nothing more than a pipe dream to others, it was completely achievable for Ye Xuan. By morning, all of the medicinal power within the solution had been absorbed and refined by him, and he had reached the void realm.

Then, he got out of the cauldron and circulated his spiritual power, drying his clothes instantly.

After carefully examining the condition of his body, he decided to increase the strength of the solution the next time.

Thinking this, the corners of Ye Xuan’s mouth curled up slightly as he arrived outside the Cloud Sky Palace.

At this moment, the sun had just risen, and he could see Zhuge Yueyue sitting close to the water cloud fruit tree, cultivating.

Ye Xuan slowly approached and smiled.

“Yueyue …”

Hearing Ye Xuan, Zhuge Yueyue gradually opened her eyes, and then got up and bowed.

“Good morning, Teacher.”

Ye Xuan waved his hand at her, and then examined her cultivation level, after which his smile grew wider.

“Middle-stage of the void realm, and your cultivation foundation has been solidified. Very good…”

This disciple of his had been very serious in her cultivation and had never slacked off.

After thinking for a moment, Ye Xuan said, “There are less than 30 days till the gathering. Yueyue, you will represent Cloud Sky peak. Keep up the good work.”

Hearing this, Zhuge Yue Yue nodded. She naturally wanted to do her best. Ye Xuan was her benefactor and savior. If possible, she never wanted to disappoint his expectations.
