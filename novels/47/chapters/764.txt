765 Revival And Breakthrough

Daoist Yi Feng understood all of this very well, but every time he recalled how many of his fellow sect members had sacrificed their lives for him, he felt as if his heart was pierced by thousands of thorns.

It was not that he wanted to continue living like this, but there was no fire in his heart anymore.

He looked at Ye Xuan seriously. For a moment, he seemed to see his senior brother, Tian Xuan, persuading him.

At that time, Tian Xuan had also said something similar to him.

“The path of cultivation is full of ups and downs. Who can go all the way to the end? Every hardship is a test from the heavens.”

“If you have already lost all hope, it is impossible for others to pull you out.”

…

“In my heart, Martial Uncle Yi Feng, you will always be a young and energetic genius with lofty aspirations.”

“For the sake of the East Continent, won’t you pick up your sword and wield it once more. Have you forgotten what your original goal was?”

After hearing Ye Xuan’s words, Daoist Yi Feng’s entire body began to tremble.

“Original goal?”

He seemed to be frozen in place, and the spiritual power in his body began to fluctuate involuntarily.

In the memories that he had buried deeply, there was a young man with lofty aspirations bragging about his dream to his senior brother.

One day, he would use the sword in his hand to sweep the world and become a romantic and chivalrous hero. Ye Xuan’s words seemed to strike a chord with him, and reignited the fire in his soul.

The spiritual power in his body began to fluctuate uncontrollably, as it assailed his realm barrier.

Boom!

The entire secret chamber shuddered, startling everyone else inside, who immediately rushed over as fast as they could.

“Junior Brother Ye… How is Martial Uncle Yi Feng?”

“Why were there such huge spiritual power fluctuations?”

At this moment, everyone’s eyes were fixed on Daoist Yi Feng, whose eyes were tightly shut.

“Could it be that… Martial Uncle finally broke through?”

Everyone felt hopeful and nervous.

Moments later, Daoist Yi Feng’s immortal bones released dazzling light and instantly transmitted an immense amount of spiritual power into his body.

As a booming sound rang out once again, the entire main peak shook violently. At this moment, Daoist Yi Feng had broken through to the ancient realm.

Seeing this, everyone present jumped up in joy.

They had been cultivating in seclusion with him for a very long time, and thus knew better than anyone else just how talented he was.

Were it not for his inner demons, he would have broken through to the ancient realm a long time ago. Now, he had finally defeated his inner demons, which was a cause for celebration.

Ye Xuan also laughed heartily.

“Reaching the ancient realm has nourished my life force significantly. If that’s the case, I might really be able to kill Mengyu.”

After breaking through to the ancient realm, one’s life force would receive a huge boost, which would increase a cultivator’s lifespan, giving them more time to cultivate and reach the sealed immortal realm.

If one could reach the sealed immortal realm, one could basically live forever and maintain their current physical state.

Now that Daoist Yi Feng had stepped into the ancient realm, it would not be difficult for him to live for two to three hundred years. He had also benefited from the spiritual power Ye Xuan had released when he broke through, and the results were finally evident after he defeated his inner demons.

If he could successfully deal with Mengyu, it was likely that he would be able to completely break the chains of the past that held him back. Then, he would have a clear path to reach the sealed immortal realm.

Unfortunately, Mengyu was not so easy to deal with.

Fortunately, Daoist Yi Feng had not completely given up on himself and was willing to once again take to the battle, and even sacrifice his life in exchange for the Great Demoness’ life. Otherwise, Ye Xuan would really be facing an impossible task.

The current situation was much better. After all, Daoist Yi Feng’s life force had received a huge boost after he stepped into the ancient realm. Even if he had to self-destruct his immortal bones again, he would likely survive.

At this moment, thunderclouds rolled over the Great Wilderness Divine sect once again. Everyone at Sky Mountain looked over at the same time.

“This aura… Could it be that another member of the Great Wilderness Divine sect has reached the ancient realm?” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Oh my god! It’s only been a few hours, yet two ancient realm experts have appeared. What is going on? This is truly unimaginable.”

Everyone was dumbfounded. In their hearts, supreme realm experts were already considered extremely rare existences, and there had not been an ancient realm expert in the East continent since ancient times.

However, two of them had now appeared in the Great Wilderness Divine Sect in the span of one day!

Even though this person’s aura was not as powerful as Ye Xuan’s, there was no mistaking it. It was truly another ancient realm expert.

Under the pressure of this powerful aura, some of the weaker cultivators could not help but kneel on the ground.

In Daoist Yi Feng’s secret chamber, his immortal bones once again released an immense amount of spiritual power.

After sensing this situation, Ye Xuan frowned, because this power did not come from Daoist Yi Feng himself, but from his immortal bones.
