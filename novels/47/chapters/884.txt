885 Opportunity

Thanks to the immortal-grade recovery pill, Ao Lei’s life had indeed been saved. However, if the crack in his sea of consciousness was not repaired, his injuries would relapse.

Therefore, Ye Xuan’s current goal was to completely repair this crack. He had infused the aura of the Chaos Immortal Peach into Ao Lei’s body, which fixed about 80% of the crack.

However, for the remaining 20%, Ye Xuan could no longer do it by himself. He needed Ao Lei to break through and reach the ancient realm. Once Ao Lei broke through, the surging life force from the breakthrough would help to repair the crack completely.

First though, he needed to handle the remnant power of Mengyu’s Devouring Heaven technique inside Ao Lei’s body. Otherwise, no matter how much energy Ye Xuan channeled into Ao Lei’s body, it was basically useless.

Ao Lei’s situation was exactly the same as Tian Xuan’s, who had been unable to reach the ancient realm due to his injuries, and passed away.

Mengyu’s Devouring Heaven technique was really quite troublesome, and even Ye Xuan could not think of any other way to get rid of the remnant power.

If Ye Xuan had noticed Ao Lei’s condition from the beginning, he might have had a way to deal with it. However, after Ao Lei died, the demonic power in his body spiraled out of control. It would not be so easy to completely destroy it now.

Yuelun also noticed Ye Xuan’s frown and understood that he must have encountered a thorny problem.

“Junior Brother Ye, could it be that there’s really no way to solve this problem?”

Ye Xuan did not reply. Instead, he fell into a state of deep thought.

Puchi!

All of a sudden, Ao Lei spat out a mouthful of blood. His face, which had already returned to normal earlier, turned pale again.

“Senior Brother Ao!”

Yuelun was extremely nervous at this moment. She wanted to rush over and support him, but Ao Lei suddenly opened his eyes and shook his head, indicating that she should not come closer.

He could sense that the demonic aura was constantly wreaking havoc in his body, and sighed emotionally as he said, “Forget it. How can I not understand my own condition?”

‘The demonic power of the Devouring Heaven technique has been wreaking havoc in my body for a hundred years. I’ve tried countless methods to get rid of it, but none of them worked.”

“Junior Brother Ye, even though I know you have remarkable abilities, there’s no need to waste so many treasures on my body.”

At this moment, Ao Lei had no hope for himself, and did not want to continue struggling.

However, Ye Xuan did not think the same way. Instead, he smiled and said, “Senior Brother Ao, there’s no need for such depressing words. Even though the Devouring Heavenly technique is difficult to deal with, I still have my ways.”

After hearing this, Ao Lei turned to look at Ye Xuan. Seeing his confident expression, Ao Lei was stunned.

Could it be that Ye Xuan could really deal with the remnant power left behind by the Devouring Heaven technique? Even Tian Xuan had not been able to do anything about this, which was why he felt hopeless about the situation.

“Junior Brother Ye, how can we resolve Senior Brother Ao’s problem?” Yuelun asked.

At this moment, the corners of Ye Xuan’s mouth curled up slightly. He was not in a hurry to answer. Instead, he began to perform several hand seals.

In a flash, a bright light covered the entirety of Cloud Sky Cave. One could vaguely see a lotus floating in the air.

“Could this be an immortal-grade divine power?”

Yuelun muttered in surprise when she saw this.

As Ye Xuan continued to activate the Eternal Light technique, a huge lotus flower slowly unfolded inside Cloud Sky Cave.

Then, Ye Xuan said calmly, “Senior Brother Ao, let me bestow upon you an opportunity today to help you reach the ancient realm.”

“This…”

Ao Lei’s eyes widened in disbelief as Ye Xuan slowly pushed the giant lotus toward him. Then, the giant lotus disappeared into his body.

In the blink of an eye, the demonic power in Ao Lei’s body seemed to have met its natural enemy, and began to flee in all directions. The giant lotus planted itself in Ao Lei’s sea of consciousness, and then transformed into a Dao Flower!

Sensing what was going on, Ao Lei exclaimed in surprise, “This… Is this a Dao Flower?”

He was taken aback. He had not reached the sealed immortal realm, so how could a Dao Flower reside in his sea of consciousness?

Under normal circumstances, there were only three possibilities for a Dao Flower to appear in one’s body.

The first was to successfully become an immortal, and the second was to inherit a Saint or Saintess legacy of an ancient sect, just like the Reincarnation Fairy.

The final possibility was if one was the reincarnation of a mighty expert. For example, Xiang Yun was born with a Dao Flower.

However, Ao Lei’s situation matched none of them, so how had this happened? How had Ye Xuan managed to bestow upon him a Dao Flower?

“This doesn’t seem right. Could it be that he’s planting his Dao with his body?”

After his surprise faded, Ao Lei discovered something strange. Despite the Dao Flower being in his sea of consciousness, it did not belong to him.

It seemed that Ye Xuan had planted his own Dao Flower in Ao Lei’s body and used it to help him eliminate the remnant power.

Once he became aware of this situation, Ao Lei’s heart was filled with shock and gratitude.

“Heavens! This method is too terrifying…”

If Ye Xuan’s method was really successful, then his cultivation level would also benefit from this as well, and there would be less roadblocks in his future cultivation path.

This fortuitous opportunity that Ye Xuan had given him was definitely not as simple as he made it out to be.

How should he repay such a huge favor?

The moment the Dao Flower successfully took root, Ye Xuan’s Eternal Light technique was fully unleashed, and continuously transmitted energy into Ao Lei’s body.

This Dao Flower was condensed by Ye Xuan after he comprehended the mysteries of the Chaos Immortal Peach and the Eternal Light technique.

If it could really take root completely, the mysteries contained within the Dao Flower would definitely benefit Ao Lei’s future cultivation.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m
