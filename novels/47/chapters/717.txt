718 Where’s The Delicious Food?

That being said, she was secretly delighted at this moment, and felt that the whole experience was unforgettable.

Thank you readers!

So this was the feeling of kissing?

After doing the deed, Ye Xuan was finally satisfied.

“Senior Sister, you’ve already ambushed me twice, yet I’ve only attacked you once, so isn’t this fair?”

After hearing Ye Xuan’s words, Yuelun could not help but roll his eyes at him and said, “You’re not afraid of losing face, but I am. Just look how many people have seen us.”

Ye Xuan looked around and saw that the surroundings were packed with wide-eyed disciples. He immediately burst out laughing.

After thinking about it seriously, Ye Xuan had another bad idea. He whispered into Yuelun’s ear.

“Senior Sister, if you think it’s inconvenient to have too many people watching, why don’t you come to my place later? We can discuss many things in private.”

After hearing this, Yuelun’s face instantly turned even redder.

How could she not understand the hidden meaning behind Ye Xuan’s words?

“Uh…”

“Aren’t things progressing a little too fast?”

Ye Xuan pretended to be confused and said, “Hmm? Senior Sister, what is progressing too fast?”

“I just want to have a nice chit-chat with you tonight. Are you thinking about something else?”

“Stinky brat…”

Yuelun pinched Ye Xuan’s waist in anger. She knew that Ye Xuan was teasing her again, so she ignored him and turned to leave without hesitation.

‘This damned brat, what he said just now was clearly what I thought it was, but he still pretended not to know and deliberately acted confused.’

If others really found out, they might even think that she was the perverted one.

Ye Xuan was still Ye Xuan. Even though the two of them had officially confirmed their relationship, he still liked to tease her.

After watching Yuelun escape, Ye Xuan could not hold back the emotions bubbling within him at this moment and burst into laughter.

“Hehehe, this is really fun.”

For some unknown reason, teasing Yuelun felt super satisfying, and he even felt that he would never get tired of it.

This beautiful senior sister of his had such a good temper, which was probably why it felt that way.

“Teacher…”

She curiously reached out her small hand and touched Ye Xuan’s mouth. After realizing that there was nothing, she asked curiously, “Teacher, did you keep some delicious food for yourself behind our backs? Hurry up and give me some too. My stomach is growling with hunger.”

After hearing these words, Ye Xuan was somewhat embarrassed and taken aback. He rubbed her little head helplessly and said, “Why would I have any delicious food?”

“Teacher, you can’t lie to me. I just witnessed you feeding Sister Yuelun mouth to mouth.”

Uh…

He had just forgotten that this little girl was here too…

It was not too appropriate for her to learn about such things yet.

After a while, Ye Xuan said, “Yun’er, you’re still too young, so there are still many things you don’t understand. When you grow up, you will understand what I was doing just now.”

“Are you lying to me?” Xiang Yun asked in disbelief.

“Have I ever lied to you before?”

“Oh… Alright then.”

After finding out that Ye Xuan did not have any delicious snacks, she felt very disappointed.

Even though she had already reached the void realm, she still could not go without eating for a long time, and had to have three meals a day. Otherwise, she would be so hungry that she would faint.

As such, she went back to look for her first sister.

“First Sister, First Sister, can we go back to Cloud Sky Peak and roast potatoes?”

“Sure thing.”

Zhuge Yueyue agreed without hesitation. She owed it to her third sister after what happened in the ancient realm.

After calming himself down, Ye Xuan, he turned to his three disciples and said, “Alright, let’s go back now.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan brought the three of them back to Cloud Sky peak.

At this moment, the other teams from the Great Wilderness Divine sect had also begun to return. Their journey and participation in the gathering had come to a successful end.

After the gathering, both the Great Wilderness Divine sect and Cloud Sky peak became famous. There was hardly a day that passed where people were not talking about them. Furthermore, many people were racking their brains as to how to curry favor and build a relationship with the sect, or even better, Ye Xuan.

However, it seemed impossible.

At this moment, the people from the Su family were overjoyed. After all, they had already established a connection with Cloud Sky peak. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Hehehe, this is really too exhilarating. The best thing I have done in my life is probably to successfully befriend a big shot like Ye Xuan.”

“Now, practically all of Qingyang City is ruled by our Su family. No one dares to disrespect us.”

Over the past few days, many factions and forces had visited the Su family’s residence to express their goodwill. After all, they realized that there was a chance that they could connect with Cloud Sky peak through the Su family.

“Elder Su, it has been a long time since we last met. I’ve really missed you…”

After one batch of guests were sent away, another arrived…
