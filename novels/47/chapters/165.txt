Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Hehe, can you afford to accept the compensation I’m about to give you?”

Ye Xuan could not help but smile coldly.

When everyone saw this scene, their pupils suddenly constricted, and their eyes were filled with shock.

Ye Xuan was not afraid of Li Tianyu at all? He was not afraid of the Blood Moon Temple?

Or had this guy not heard of the Blood Moon Temple before? Was he tired of living?

Could this guy really be from the Great Qian Dynasty? The cultivators from that backward place were really something else.

This was the Blood Moon Temple! The same one that casually kills people and steals their treasures!

It was a pity, but it seemed a peerless genius who had comprehended the embryonic form of the Heavenly Lightning intent was about to die.

“Hehe!”

Hearing this, Li Tianyu narrowed his eyes. Then, his figure suddenly disappeared.

“Not good!”

Everyone’s expressions changed drastically as they retreated frantically.

It was obvious that Li Tianyu was about to make a move!

If a unity realm expert made a move, it would definitely affect everyone present.

More importantly, Li Tianyu was a cultivator from the Blood Moon Temple, which meant that he would not care about the life and death of anyone here.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan’s expression did not change. Instead, he slowly raised his right fist and suddenly punched the space in front of him.

Boom!

Moments later, that space suddenly rippled, and then a figure shot out like a cannonball.

Whoosh!

Before anyone could react, Ye Xuan’s figure suddenly disappeared, and then reappeared next to Li Tianyu’s retreating figure.

Boom!

Another simple punch was thrown!

However, this time it was infused with powerful fist intent!

Li Tianyu’s body suddenly exploded. The divine elements in his body blossomed with vitality, trying to repair his broken body.

Then, Ye Xuan gently extended his index finger and pointed in Li Tianyu’s direction, and the destructive power of lightning surged out.

Boom!

A unity realm expert was suddenly turned into ashes and smoke!

Everyone fell deathly silent.

It was not until the lightning bolts descended and the sound of thunder roared that everyone came back to their senses.

Ye Xuan calmly reached out his hand and grabbed something. It was a storage ring.

Then, Ye Xuan’s figure suddenly disappeared, and he returned to his original spot.

Everyone was dumbfounded when they saw this.

What had happened?

Was it over so quickly?

Li Tianyu was instantly killed by Ye Xuan?

A second-level unity realm expert had failed to even put up the slightest bit of resistance. Ye Xuan had easily crushed Li Tianyu.

In that case…

How strong was Ye Xuan?

Why was a 20-year-old cultivator this strong?

All it had taken was two punches and a flick of his finger… Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

How could such a peerless genius emerge from the Great Qian Dynasty?

Could he be a hidden descendant of an ancient force?

They looked at Ye Xuan in disbelief.

“As I expected, Ye Xuan killed another opponent instantly!”

“As expected of the strongest genius of our Great Qian Dynasty. Miracles always happen around him.”

The cultivators of the Great Qian Dynasty were excited. Every one of Ye Xuan’s battles that they had seen or heard about had ended up like this, with Ye Xuan crushing his opponent in an instant.

Also, Ye Xuan’s greatest strength was his sword qi. However, a sword cultivator had insta-killed a unity realm expert with his fist. This meant that Li Tianyu was not even worthy of Ye Xuan drawing his sword.

When they revealed Ye Xuan’s identity just now, no one had believed them, and many people even ridiculed them.

“How can such a peerless genius come from the Great Qian Dynasty? He must be from a super empire or holy land, or is a descendant of a hidden major force from ancient times…”

“That’s right. How can such a backward place like the Great Qian Dynasty produce such a peerless genius? That’s utter nonsense!”

The scene of Ye Xuan killing Li Tianyu in an instant just now had deeply shocked everyone.

However, they refused to believe that Ye Xuan came from the Great Qian Dynasty.

When the cultivators of the Great Qian Dynasty heard this, they were so angry that they almost spat out a mouthful of blood.

These guys recognized Ye Xuan’s terrifying strength and monstrous talent, but they did believe that Ye Xuan came from the Great Qian dynasty.

This made them somewhat depressed.

“Hehe, even if you don’t believe it now, when the War God Hall opens, you will know Ye Xuan’s identity! When that time comes, let’s see if you can still call us liars!”

Those guys obviously looked down on the Great Qian Dynasty, which was why they would not admit that Ye Xuan was a cultivator from the Great Qian Dynasty.

“Just now, when he killed Li Tianyu, that was fist intent, right?”

“What’s so strange about that? Since he was able to comprehend the embryonic form of the Heavenly Lightning intent, what’s so strange about him being able to comprehend a fist intent?”

“I’m curious about his true strength. I wonder what cultivation level he has reached.”
