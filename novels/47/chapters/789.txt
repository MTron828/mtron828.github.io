“Yi Feng!”

In a large hall, Mengyu, who had been watching, stood up instantly when she sensed the old man’s arrival.

Her eyes were filled with hatred, but there was also a hint of an indescribable emotion within them.

“Are you not going to hide anymore?”

She had been waiting for Daoist Yi Feng to appear.

She knew that Daoist Yi Feng was just hiding from her. She was not in a hurry to make a move against the Great Wilderness Divine sect, as she wanted him to stand up for himself.

Now that he had appeared, Mengyu’s lips curled up slightly.

At this moment, Daoist Yi Feng forcefully suppressed the tens of thousands of vengeful spirits, nodding at Ye Xuan, indicating that he did not have to worry.

After doing all this, Daoist Yi Feng turned around and looked at the elders behind him.

“Let’s go.”

As soon as he finished speaking, hundreds of elders infused their spiritual power into the defensive formation, completely stabilizing it.

With this, Sky Mountain’s crisis was averted. When the vengeful spirits outside saw Daoist Yi Feng appear, they did not dare to attack. Instead, they began to spread across the East continent.

Seeing this, Ao Lei shouted without hesitation, “Cultivators of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, heed my order! Charge out of the formation and kill those vengeful spirits!”

They could not allow these vengeful spirits to spread across the East continent. The other smaller factions would not be able to resist at all, and would be destroyed in no time at all.

“This…”

“Did I hear wrongly? He actually wants them to go out and fight these vengeful spirits?”

Everyone was dumbfounded at this time; even Gao Shun was very surprised.

“Senior Brother Ao, are we really going to do this?”

Ao Lei turned around to look at Gao Shun and said with a serious tone, “These vengeful spirits are filled with resentment. Once they are allowed to spread, it will have a serious impact on the East continent.”

“Therefore, we must immediately go out and destroy them!”

It seemed that they had to risk it all and fight to the death. The other chiefs did not have any objections either. Soon after the order was issued, the members of the sect started to move out.

At this moment, the people on Sky Mountain felt their blood boiling.

“The Great Wilderness Divine sect is worthy of being the number one sect in the East continent! They are willing to take on the responsibility of holding these vengeful spirits back!”

“It’s my honor to fight alongside the Great Wilderness Divine sect today. Even if I die today, it will be worth it!”

Ao Lei then roared, “Everyone, get ready! Kill all these vengeful spirits!”

Everyone roared in response, and the atmosphere was heated.

Gao Shun stretched out his hands and pushed forward, opening an exit in the defensive formation. In the blink of an eye, millions of cultivators rushed out, roaring as they charged.

“Kill!”

“Don’t let any vengeful spirits escape! Show them what the people of the East continent are made of!”

A fierce battle instantly broke out outside the formation, and the members of the Great Wilderness Divine sect were at the vanguard.

All of the chiefs and elders used their strength to attack in unison, forcing the vengeful spirits to retreat continuously.

With Daoist Yi Feng guarding Sky Mountain, there was no need to worry about the defense formation being breached.

A great battle began.

Over the past few days, these hot-blooded cultivators had been on the defensive, and had no chance to strike back. Now that they were given the chance to attack, they gave it their all.

Seeing that the battle below had already started, Ye Xuan’s emotions were roused as well.

“Interesting…”

When he saw the fearless looks of the youths below, Ye Xuan was deeply moved. Although they were weaker than him, their resolve was not. It seemed that he too had much to learn.

In fact, even the seven strange monsters were dumbfounded to see that these human cultivators had taken the initiative to charge out and fight the vengeful spirits.

They were safe behind the power of the formation, so why did they risk their lives for others? Why were they all so fired up about possibly throwing their lives away?

The strange monsters could not understand it.

Despite pushing the vengeful spirits back during the first clash, the human cultivators also paid a heavy price. The scene was bloody.

This vigorous battle would definitely be recorded in the annals of history.

On the other side, Mengyu began to ponder deeply as she looked at the fearless members of the Great Wilderness Divine sect who were fighting at the forefront. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

That scene from a hundred years ago was replaying itself in her mind.

Although the Great Wilderness Divine Sect was almost destroyed in that war, they still won in the end.

“Could it be that the human spirit is really indestructible?”

Mengyu muttered to herself. She did not understand what made these people so fearless.

On Ye Xuan’s side, he held the Godsword aloft and closed his eyes. Then, he let out a long sigh.

“Sigh…”

“I’ve been playing around with you guys until now. That’s your last trump card, right?”

Ye Xuan calmly said these words, causing Heavenly King Li to panic. The divine lightning in the sky was still emitting a powerful aura in the sky.

However, now that he had the Soul Beckoning Banner, there was no need to be afraid of him. He could still fight!
