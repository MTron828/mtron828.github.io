Chapter 249: 999x Critical Reward!

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The Three Thousand Thunder sword technique also played a large role in Ye Xuan’s success in integrating sword intent with heavenly lightning intent in the Tower of Heaven trials.

He was able to fight enemies stronger than himself thanks to these high-level cultivation methods and martial techniques.

“Divine Lightning Purple Cloud sword technique, top-grade heaven-rank!” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Ye Xuan’s gaze fell on the description of this cultivation method.

This skill was somewhat similar to his previous cultivation method. Not only could it attract the power of thousands of bolts of heavenly lightning, but also the extremely powerful purple cloud divine lightning.

After that, Ye Xuan checked out other martial arts techniques and cultivation methods.

After a brief look, Ye Xuan began to give his disciples pills and artifacts.

“Ding! As the host has given his disciple the indestructible body tempering pill (fourth-grade), the host has received a randomized 12x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the heavenly lightning body tempering pill (fourth-grade).”

“Ding! As the host has given his disciple the heavenly lightning body tempering pill (fourth-grade), the host has received a randomized 78x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the rebirth pill (fifth-grade).”

“Ding! As the host has given his disciple the rebirth pill (fifth-grade), the host has received a randomized 16x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the golden bone pill (fifth-grade).”

…

After he had dealt with the pills, it was time for the artifacts.

“Ding! As the host has given his disciple the azure divine sword (Supreme-grade magic artifact), the host has received a randomized 8x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the sky sword (Supreme-grade magic artifact)!”

“Ding! As the host has given his disciple the sky sword (Supreme-grade magic artifact), the host has received a randomized 79x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the green lotus divine sword (low-grade mysterious artifact).”

“Ding! As the host has given his disciple the green lotus divine sword (low-grade mysterious artifact), the host has received a randomized 39x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the martial king divine sword (middle-grade mysterious artifact)!”

After giving away weapons, it was time for the defensive artifacts.

“Ding! As the host has given his disciple the Golden Sparrow armor (high-grade defensive spiritual artifact), the host has received a randomized 300x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the Dream Butterfly dress (middle-grade defensive magic artifact)!”

“Ding! As the host has given his disciple the Dream Butterfly dress (middle-grade defensive magic artifact), the host has received a randomized 39x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the Rainbow Orchid Flame dress (high-grade defensive magic artifact)!”

“Ding! As the host has given his disciple the Rainbow Orchid Flame dress (high-grade defensive magic artifact), the host has received a randomized 50x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the nine nether battle armor (top-grade defensive magic artifact)!”

System notifications kept ringing out in Ye Xuan’s mind.

He had no choice! It had been a month since he had last seen his disciples, and there were simply too many rewards that he could reap.

After doing all this, Ye Xuan gave his disciple mounts. He started with the black flame eagle, and ended up with the nine netherworld bird, which was a terrifying demonic beast that had reached the ninth level of the unity realm!

However, this was not the end!

After some careful selection, he picked out two heavenly treasures that could improve his disciples’ innate bone value and comprehension value.

After all, these two things were what Ye Xuan valued the most.

“Ding! As the host has given his disciple the blue lotus earth fire, the host has received a randomized 33x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the mystic ginseng sage herb.”

“Ding! As the host has given his disciple the mystic ginseng sage herb, the host has received a randomized 27x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the green sky fruit.”

“Ding! As the host has given his disciple the green sky fruit, the host has received a randomized 67x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the myriad divine essence!”

These were only heavenly treasures that could increase their innate bone value.

After that, Ye Xuan gave Yue and the others heavenly treasures that could enhance their comprehension value.

From the withered leaf bodhi, he obtained the Paramita flower in the end.

Ye Xuan quickly checked out the description of the Paramita flower. It was a spiritual item that greatly increased a cultivator’s comprehension value and could give the cultivator three opportunities to experience an epiphany.

Not only that, but each epiphany would last a full three days.

“This is great!”

Ye Xuan was pleasantly surprised.

“During this period of time, you must diligently cultivate your spiritual sense tempering technique. When you have perfect control over your own strength, I will then perform spiritual power infusion on you.”

Ye Xuan decided to temporarily put the spiritual power infusion on hold until he had dealt with the remainder of the Nether God sect, Blood Moon Temple, and the Yunjin Temple.

“We will heed Teacher’s orders!”

Yue and the others nodded obediently.

This time, Ye Xuan had taught and given them too much, so they did not know where to start.

Heck, even Ye Xuan was muddling his way through the countless system rewards he had received at once.

At this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly remembered something.

He had yet to impart his spiritual sense tempering technique to them.

Immediately, the system’s warning tone rang out again.

“Ding! As the host has taught his disciple the Heavenly Soul Nine Revolutions technique, the host has received a randomized 100x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has received the Undying Heavenly Soul technique!”

“Ding! As the host has taught his disciple the Undying Heavenly Soul technique, the host has received a randomized 56x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the Heavenly Soul Derivation technique!”

“Ding! As the host has taught his disciple the Heavenly Soul Derivation technique, the host has received a randomized 999x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the Great Heavenly Soul Illusion technique!”
