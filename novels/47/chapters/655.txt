“I’ll see for myself just how amazing you are then,” Yuelun looked at Ye Xuan and said provocatively.

Ye Xuan smirked before turning to leave. He flew over to where Daoist Canghai and Daoist Xu Yun were and cupped his fists.

“Ye Xuan pays his respects to Daoist Canghai and Daoist Xu Yun.”

The two of them hurriedly stood up.

“Little Brother Ye Xuan, there’s no need for such formalities. It seems that the younger generation will surpass us soon,” Daoist Canghai hurriedly said.

In the mystic world, those with strength would be respected. Therefore, since Ye Xuan had already reached the same level as them, the rules of seniority no longer applied to him. They were of equal standing now.

“Little Brother Ye Xuan is truly a peerless genius to have reached the peak of the supreme realm at such a young age. You’ve even surpassed your teacher.”

Daoist Xu Yun also praised Ye Xuan sincerely. He had been thoroughly shocked by Ye Xuan’s master of the Sword Dao.

Seeing that Daoist Gu Hao had failed to stop that last sword strike, he knew that he would not have fared any better.

“You’re too kind, fellow Daoists. I was just using some little tricks just now.”

“My teacher has told me many times that among the many powerful cultivators in the East Continent, fellow Daoists are the true experts.”

“And he also told me to maintain courtesy and respect if I was lucky enough to meet you both.”

Hearing Ye Xuan’s words, the two of them felt somewhat happy.

They had not expected Tian Xuan to hold them in such high regard.

At this time, Ye Xuan turned around and waved at his three disciples, motioning them to come forward.

“Fellow Daoists, these three are my disciples. If you encounter them in the future while they are wandering the mystic world, I hope you can take care of them.”

“Of course, of course. It’s a small matter. If we encounter them, we will definitely do our best to help.”

There was no reason to refuse. After all, making friends with Ye Xuan was a far better alternative to making him an enemy. Furthermore, he was being so respectful too.

The two of them then examined Zhuge Yueyue and the others. However, when Daoist Canghai examined Xiang Yun, his body trembled.

“Little Brother Ye Xuan, this disciple you’ve accepted is really amazing.”

“She’s reached the void realm in terms of body refining cultivation?”

“That’s a real genius right there.”

Hearing this, Daoist Xu Yun was also given a fright, as he too examined Xiang Yun. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

This little girl was at most six years old, so she could not embark on the path of spiritual cultivation yet. Thus, she could only focus on body refining cultivation.

In this way, she would be able to lay a good foundation for her future growth. However, other geniuses would only raise the body refining cultivation level to the divine mystic realm, or the materialization realm at most, yet this six-year-old girl had surpassed them all.

Ye Xuan smiled and glanced at Xiang Yun before saying, “You’re making too big a deal of it. It’s not worth mentioning.”

“Yun’er, come here and greet these two elders.”

Xiang Yun came forward obediently. Her eyes were fixed on the two people sitting in front of her. Then, she saluted them in a proper manner.

“Xiang Yun pays her respects to Daoist Canghai and Daoist Xu Yun.”

Daoist Canghai stroked his long, white beard happily after hearing that.

‘This little girl is so obedient and reasonable. If she was my granddaughter, I would wake up happy every day.’

Of course, he was not aware of her true temperament, which was for the better in this case.

“Haha, your name is Xiang Yun, right? Very good.”

Daoist Canghai chuckled and took out some wind chimes from his storage space. “Little Xiang Yun, this is the first time we’ve met, so consider these wind chimes a gift from me.”

Xiang Yun did not take them immediately. Instead, she asked for Ye Xuan’s opinion.

After getting ye Xuan’s approval, she took them happily. After examining them for a while, she became even happier.

“Thank you, Grandpa Canghai,” Xiang Yun said with a smile.

She discovered that when she shook it, spiritual energy would actually overflow out of it. It was also a very precious treasure.

This old man was so generous!

“Oh my, Daoist Canghai, you’re trying to jump the gun here. You should have told me that you were going to give her a treasure first. Don’t make me look like a miser.”

Daoist Xu Yun glared at Daoist Canghai with an unhappy expression. He then took out a bracelet from his storage space and said, “Little girl, this is my gift to you for our first meeting.”

“Not only can this bracelet be used to store things, but it can also help you cultivate when you wear it.”

Upon hearing this, Xiang Yun happily looked toward Ye Xuan for permission again. When she saw him agree, she cheerfully accepted the bracelet.
