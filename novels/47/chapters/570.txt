571 Qingyang Restaurant Again

When they envisioned that bloody scene, Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun shivered. They even felt a little nauseated.

However, they were cultivators, after all. If they did not possess mental fortitude, what would they do if they encountered such situations in the future?

As they were in the East continent, their teacher could shelter and protect them. However, what about the future? They would eventually visit the other empires, and even continents.

Even though she felt disgusted, Zhuge Yueyue still made up her mind and said, “Teacher, I want to go and take a look.”

!!

Hearing this, Ye Xuan also felt very pleased and said, “Alright, since you want to go, then I’ll take you there to see it.”

After saying that, Ye Xuan looked around and thought for a while before speaking, “However, there’s no hurry now. I still have something to deal with. After I’m done with this matter, we’ll go and take a look.”

“However, if it’s already settled over there, then we won’t go. There would be nothing to see then.”

Hearing this, the two of them were a little interested. What exactly was their teacher going to do?

Following Ye Xuan, the three of them arrived at the number one restaurant in Qingyang City, Qingyang Restaurant.

The Qingyang Restaurant was involved in many businesses, but even now, no one knew who its master was.

The person in charge of this branch of the Qingyang Restaurant was a mystic lord realm cultivator, Han Sikong.

Not long ago, Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun had also encountered trouble here thanks to Lin Dong. Coincidentally, Han Sikong had been around and took the initiative to help them.

When they arrived at the Qingyang Restaurant, the two girls were very confused. What exactly was Ye Xuan doing here?

“Hello there, customers, please come in and take a seat.”

After seeing the three of them, a servant immediately came over and arranged for Ye Xuan and the others to sit.

However, Ye Xuan just stood there and then said in a calm tone, “Go and pass on a message for me. Ask the person in charge to come out and see me.”

After hearing this, the servant was momentarily stunned and immediately pinched himself to wake up.

Looking at Ye Xuan’s appearance, he knew that this person had to have a great background and was probably here to stir up trouble.

At the thought of this, the servant was a little excited.

The Qingyang Restaurant had been in this place for so long, yet no one had ever dared to stir up trouble here.

However, what was the background of this young man?

That being said, was the boss someone that could be randomly called out like this?

“Respected guest, you have my apologies.”

“The boss of our Qingyang Restaurant has many responsibilities, so he is really busy. If there’s really something you need, you can tell me and I’ll pass it on.”

The servant was still polite, but the contempt in his expression was obvious.

This was no surprise. After all, to be able to become a servant of the Qingyang Restaurant, one had to have a certain status.

Ye Xuan looked at him and did not take this matter to heart. After all, he was not here to cause trouble. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Moments later, Ye Xuan released his supreme realm aura, causing the entire Qingyang Restaurant building to shake.

The servant’s face turned pale in an instant. He stood there in a daze, not knowing what to do.

“I…”

Feeling this powerful sense of oppression, the servant was already clear that the young man in front of him was no ordinary person. On the contrary, he was an extremely powerful expert.

“It seems that we have a distinguished guest today.”

While the servant was at a loss, Han Sikong walked down from the second floor.

Even though he looked very calm, he was inwardly panicking.

‘What happened? Why did this peerless expert suddenly come to my place?’

Han Sikong had many questions, but no answers.

In recent days, news of Ye Xuan’s remarkable feats had spread far and wide, and everyone knew that he had broken through to the supreme realm, which was a realm that countless cultivators could only dream of.

As a supreme realm expert, he was basically untouchable within the entire East continent, much less this insignificant branch of the Qingyang Restaurant.

There was no way Han Sikong would dream of ever offending Ye Xuan.

However, what he did not understand was why Ye Xuan had come knocking on his doorstep.

Could it be that someone from the Qingyang Restaurant had provoked Ye Xuan without his knowledge?

Han Sikong became even more nervous when he thought of this possibility. However, he was an experienced man, so he still looked calm.

“Honored guest Ye, is there something you need from our small Qingyang Restaurant today?” Han Sikong asked carefully.

Ye Xuan just glanced at him indifferently and asked, “Are you the person in charge of the Qingyang Restaurant?”

“Yes, I am.”

Han Sikong was already sweating profusely from the panic. Was this demon here for him?

‘I don’t think I’ve offended him, so why did he come to find me?’

‘Had he been made someone else’s scapegoat?’

Ye Xuan just smiled and said, “I finally got to see you. As the person in charge, you really are too busy. It’s so hard to meet someone as important as you.”

Han Sikong’s face turned pale. He glared at the servant and quickly said, “No, no, I just happened to have something to deal with just now.”

“I didn’t know it was you, honored guest Ye. If I had known, I would have welcomed you personally.”

Looking at Han Sikong’s fawning appearance, Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun were both stunned.

Previously, they had thought that Han Sikong was a top expert. From the perspective of outsiders, the Qingyang Restaurant also had a strong background and no one dared to provoke it.

However, unexpectedly, Han Sikong was so submissive in front of their teacher.

...

Could it be that their teacher had already become so powerful?

The two of them were extremely puzzled, not knowing what was going on.

It was probably because Ye Xuan doted on his two disciples too much, so he always subconsciously excluded them when exerting his spiritual pressure.

If Han Sikong knew what the two girls were thinking at this time, he would probably have cursed immediately, ‘I’m afraid that no one in the entire East Province would dare to offend you or your teacher after what’s been going on.’
