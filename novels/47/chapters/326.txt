327 Premonition

“If Ye Xuan shows up, you can tell him to come to the Holy Land. I will guarantee his safety,” the advanced-stage Saint King realm expert said to the human cultivators in the area before leaving.

He knew very well that what the Fire Dragon King had said was just a threat. There was no way that the latter would actually kick-start a war between their great emperor realm experts.

After that, the battle between the two races returned to its previous state.

…

At this time, Ye Xuan, whom everyone was searching for, had already dived into the depths of the stormy sea area. He was concealing his aura, so only a great emperor realm expert would be able to sense his presence. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Ye Xuan was also trying to use the power of karma to deduce information about the other world. However, there seemed to be a mysterious power hindering him.

“It seems that I’ll have to do this the hard way.”

Ye Xuan gradually traversed spatial passages. His mastery of spatial intent allowed him to stay virtually hidden in the spatial turbulence. Thanks to the power of karma, he was warned about the various experts searching for him, so he had his guard up.

After some time, in a place deep within the stormy sea area, mysterious ripples appeared, and an early-stage Human King realm demonic whale suddenly died.

Imprisoned within a spatial cage, it did not even have the opportunity to transmit a message before its death.

Ye Xuan then used the soul-searching technique to read the other party’s memories in order to gain a better understanding of the sea race and the stormy sea area. Incidentally, he also received some information regarding the other world.

He continued silently assassinating sea race King realm experts, and after soul-searching enough of them, he realized that it was impossible to find the location of the other world via this method.

In the end, Ye Xuan could only choose to give up and search for rare heavenly treasures in this vast stormy sea area instead.

Almost a month later, Shangguan Wan’er, who was cultivating on an island, suddenly opened her eyes. She saw the space ripple slightly, and then Ye Xuan’s figure appeared.

Ye Xuan went through the motions of obtaining system rewards from his disciple again. Then, he repeated this process with Yue, Qingyan and Yan’er..

A year later, Ye Xuan’s strength had reached an extremely terrifying level.

He was now no weaker than a middle-stage Heavenly King realm cultivator!

Coupled with his own comprehension of martial intents and high-level martial techniques, Ye Xuan was basically invincible below the Saint King realm.

This was a remarkable achievement for a pattern condensation realm cultivator. However, he could sense that the natural laws of the Tianyuan continent were restricting him when he cultivated normally.

It was only due to the system’s rewards, which seemed to bypass the natural laws, that allowed him to continue increasing his strength at such a rapid rate. Perhaps the natural laws had somehow detected that he was an anomaly.

“It’s time to enter secluded cultivation!”

“Soon, it will be time to help Wan’er awaken her Undying Xuan Huang sword physique.”

It had been a year since they arrived at the stormy sea.

His disciples had also obtained a lot of opportunities. Yue had enough heavenly treasures to advance her sword jade body to the perfection stage. Li Qingyan had also obtained enough to advance her dual-spirit body, as did Zhao Yuyan.

The most important thing was that, during this year, none of them had been discovered by the sea race. The aura concealment technique Ye Xuan had taught them had come in handy for this.

Of course, there had been a few King realm experts who were capable of detecting their presence, but they had all been taken care of by Ye Xuan.

Ye Xuan himself remained unnoticed as well.

The heavenly phenomenon that the awakening of both of their special constitutions would be immense, and would likely attract the attention of the experts from both sides. The formation he set up had to be powerful enough to conceal this, especially since he could vaguely sense through the power of karma that the special constitution he would awaken would be heaven-shaking.

The reward multiplier for awakening Shangguan Wan’er’s sword constitution was likely going to be crazy.

Hu!

Ye Xuan took a deep breath, his heart full of anticipation.

What kind of special constitution would he obtain?

After that, Ye Xuan’s figure suddenly disappeared. When he reappeared, he was already beside Shangguan Wan’er.

“Wan ‘er! Enter secluded cultivation with me!”

Ye Xuan flicked his sleeves and disappeared with Shangguan Wan’er.

After that, Ye Xuan and Shangguan Wan’er appeared beside Yue, Li Qingyan, and Zhao Yuyan.

“My precious disciples, come and cultivate in seclusion with me!”

As soon as he finished speaking, they suddenly felt their vision darken and then they reappeared in a vast space.
