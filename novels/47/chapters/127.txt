Chapter 128: You… You Have Reached The Unity Realm?!

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The crowd did not keep their voices down when they spoke. Mo Tianyi could hear their discussion clearly. Moreover, they were specifically trying to anger Mo Tianyi to death.

If Li Qingyan had not chosen to make a move, the crowd would not have had the courage to do so, but since Li Qingyan stood forth, it meant that Ye Xuan intended to deal with this situation.

In the entire Great Qian Dynasty, was there an opponent worthy of Ye Xuan?

The blood-robed old man? Could a mere advanced-stage golden core realm expert block a single one of his sword strikes?

It was precisely because of this that no one held back the disdain they had previously hidden in their hearts.

After all, Mo Tianyi had not only targeted the third prince, but had also said that they were trash. Who could stomach this?

Although they could not defeat Mo Tianyi, Ye Xuan could!

Countless cultivators ridiculed him in unison.

Reality would prove that everyone’s verbal attacks were very effective.

Mo Tianyi’s body could not stop trembling. His face contorted into a mix of anger and ferocity. If he had not maintained the last shred of calmness in his heart, the power in his body would have already gone berserk.

“Damn it! You trash are simply courting death!”

“After I defeat this woman, I will definitely ask Elder Li to kill all of you. All of you will die!”

Mo Tianyi clenched his fists tightly. His eyes were filled with monstrous killing intent.

Ever since he joined the Nether God sect, his horizons had been broadened. After coming into contact with the top geniuses of the Nanzhou Region, he was amazed.

So the so-called geniuses of the Great Chuan Empire were just ordinary people in comparison to them!

Originally, his level of talent was almost the same as the third prince’s. However, thanks to the abundant resources of the Nether God sect, he had left the latter in the dust.

As his strength increased, Mo Tianyi also gradually became arrogant and overbearing.

Now, in his eyes, whether it was the Great Qian Dynasty or the Baijin Empire, or even the Great Chuan Empire where he was from, none of them were worthy of his attention.

Especially the cultivators of the younger generation, who were like ants in his eyes.

However, the very cultivators he disdained were attacking his pride.

His eyes were filled with monstrous anger.

Invincible Ye Xuan? Strongest genius?

He did not think that these pieces of trash would dare to fabricate such a ridiculous thing in order to anger him.

However, you have succeeded! You have succeeded in angering me! The reward that awaits you is death!

Whoosh!

Just as Mo Tianyi was about to ask the blood-robed old man to act, Li Qingyan’s longsword moved.

Accompanied by a streak of bright light, a torrent of sword qi that soared to the sky surged forth!

Although it was not one-thousandth of Ye Xuan’s sword qi, it still contained terrifying power.

In terms of power, she had already reached the peak of the purple spirit realm.

“What?”

Mo Tianyi’s facial expression changed greatly when he saw this. He could actually sense the destructive power of this sword qi, and his soul trembled. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

He… he would not be able to withstand this attack!

Mo Tianyi turned pale with fright as the torrent of sword qi barreled toward him.

Wherever the torrent of sword qi passed, a trench that was dozens of meters followed in its wake.

“Elder Li!”

Immediately, Mo Tianyi looked at the blood-robed man in panic, asking for help. At the same time, the strange black energy surged out to form an energy barrier.

“You are so young, but your methods are so vicious. Fine! I will teach you a lesson on behalf of your elders!”

Just as the torrent of sword qi was about to land on Mo Tianyi, an indifferent voice suddenly rang out.

Then, a terrifying force as vast as the ocean suddenly appeared and smashed into Li Qingyan’s sword qi.

The blood-robed old man had acted!

Elder Li looked at Li Qingyan with an ice-cold gaze, and a trace of shock flashed across his eyes.

That torrent of sword qi was not simple. Even a tenth-level purple spirit realm cultivator might not have been able to block it.

In other words, if he had not acted, and Mo Tianyi did not use his trump card, Mo Tianyi would definitely have died.

She was so young, yet her strength was so terrifying. In addition to that, the martial technique she used was extremely powerful.

Boom!

Just as Elder Li was thinking this, a terrifying power as vast as the world suddenly descended on his body and firmly imprisoned him.

Ye Xuan, who was not far away, had slowly stretched out his hand and then casually made a grabbing gesture.

Moments later, Elder Li felt an invisible force around his neck that lifted him up.

“How… How is this possible?”

“This power… This guy has actually reached the unity realm?”

“How can a cultivator reach the unity realm in such a backward empire?”

Elder Li’s face was flushed red. His eyes were filled with fear, and he struggled ferociously.

“Elder Ye Xuan has finally made his move!”

Seeing this, everyone was excited.

They could finally see the strongest cultivator of the Great Qian Dynasty make his move!

Not far away, Mo Tianyi witnessed this scene and was extremely frightened. He knew how strong Elder Li was.

A top-tier advanced-stage golden core realm expert!

Even within the Nether God sect, Elder Li was not weak. However, he was easily restrained by this person…

Who exactly was this person?

“You’ve actually reached the unity realm? How is that possible?”

“The power of the natural laws in this area is so thin, so how could you possibly have done this?”

Elder Li was panicking.

He was an elder of the Nether God sect, so he had naturally interacted with unity realm experts before, but he had never seen such a young unity realm expert.

Moreover, he had already learned of Ye Xuan’s identity from the comments of the crowd.

He was the strongest genius of the Great Qian Dynasty. At the age of 20, this person had already stepped into the unity realm!

Even in the entire Nanzhou Region, this was unheard of!

“Wait… Did I hear him wrongly just now? He… he said that Elder Ye Xuan has reached the unity realm?”

“Is… is this true? It has been hundreds of years since anyone in our Great Qian Dynasty reached the unity realm. Did Elder Ye Xuan really break this record?”

“My God…”

As soon as the blood-robed elder finished speaking, everyone was stunned and in total disbelief.
