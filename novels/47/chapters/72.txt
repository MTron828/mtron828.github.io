Chapter 73: His Eye For Talent Is Quite Sharp

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Previously, Elder Ye was always completely engrossed in cultivation and had no intention of taking in any disciples.

Now that he was willing to become his disciples’ sparring partner, it was inevitable that they would feel jealous.

However, although they were envious, they were even more shocked.

Elder Ye’s disciples had actually reached the true essence realm, and the true essence power they emitted was extremely powerful. They seemed to be no weaker than the other elders’ personal disciples, perhaps even more powerful.

Although no one could recognize Li Qingyan, there were still quite a number of people who knew Yue.

A dozen days ago, Yue had only been a refinement realm cultivator. How long had it even been? How had she already broken through to the true essence realm?

“It’s fine if her master is monstrous, but how are the disciples also so monstrous? Is the world so unfair?”

“Look at the martial techniques these two girls are displaying! They are so terrifying, and their true essence power is extremely strong. If we were to fight them, I’m afraid we wouldn’t be able to withstand even one move!”

“They… They are too strong!”

“Wait… Their strength seems to still be increasing. Could it be that these are using actual combat experience to increase their own combat strength and awareness in battle? My God, just how terrifying are the comprehension values of these two girls?”

When everyone saw this, they could not help but reveal shocked expressions.

It was no wonder they were able to become Elder Ye’s disciples. These f*cking girls were simply monstrous!

In actual combat, they could even adapt to the fight on the fly to improve themselves. Was this something a normal person could do?

Normally speaking, if one managed to become an outer sect disciple or an inner sect disciple of the Qingyun sect, that alone was proof that their level of talent was not low.

However, when they saw the terrifying speed at which Yue and Li Qingyan improved, they felt powerless. These two girls distorted the definition of geniuses.

The Qingyun sect disciples in the training ground were transfixed. As they discussed the battle and the girls among themselves, it immediately attracted the attention of countless other sect members.

Wan Shanhai, who was cultivating in a cultivation room, also noticed what was going on in the training ground. Heimmediately mobilized his vast spiritual sense to examine the situation.

When he took a look at the scene that was unfolding in the training ground, he was dumbfounded.

‘F*ck! Why does it feel like I’ve been cheated?’

As time passed, the Yue and Li Qingyan’s attacks became more and more practiced and accurate, and the true essence power that they were exuding became more and more turbulent. However, their attacks were still easily deflected by Ye Xuan.

“Are this guy’s disciples so monstrous?” Wan Shanhai was dumbfounded when he saw this scene.

He had also heard that Ye Xuan had taken in two disciples when the latter returned, but he did not think much of it at first.

After all, when Ye Xuan was seriously injured, from Wan Shanhai’s perspective, the reason why Ye Xuan had taken Yue in as his disciple back then was very likely because he wanted someone to inherit his mantle.

It had only been a few days, but this girl’s strength was already so terrifying. Could it be that Ye Xuan had used spiritual power infusion?

Good heavens! This guy was actually so willing to sacrifice that much? Was he intent on giving his disciple everything?

A ninth-level true essence realm cultivator!

Moreover, their ability to adapt and improve in battle was incredible, and their attacks were as swift as lightning. Even he could not help but exclaim in admiration.

Whoosh!

Wan Shanhai waved his sleeve, and his figure suddenly appeared in the training ground.

“Sect Leader!”

“We pay our respects to the Sect Leader!”

Seeing this, everyone was shocked. These two had actually caught the sect leader’s attention?

Wan Shanhai nodded slightly in acknowledgement at the crowd, and then his gaze turned to Ye Xuan and the girls.

It was obvious that the sect leader had been attracted by the battle between master and disciples.

However, as time went by, Wan Shanhai’s face became more and more livid.

‘F*ck! I was really cheated!’

‘This guy actually trained such monstrously talented disciples behind his back. Although my eldest disciple is not weak, he is definitely not a match for these two!’

Wan Shanhai sighed when he saw this scene.

The eldest disciple he mentioned was called Chen Xiaofeng. He had reached the eighth level of the true essence realm, and he was only half a step away from reaching the ninth level of the true essence realm. He could be said to be the strongest personal disciple in the Qingyun sect at the moment, and also the eldest senior disciple in everyone’s hearts.

Wan Shanhai was also very clear about Chen Xiaofeng’s strength. He had thought that the young cultivators of the Qingyun sect would not be able to beat him, which was why was willing to take out the Heart-seeking Fruit as a reward for the Qingyun sect competition.

However, “man proposes, God disposes.”

He had actually overlooked Ye Xuan’s disciples.

The most important thing was that Ye Xuan had only taken in these disciples not long ago. How did they suddenly become so monstrous?

The true essence power unleashed by Li Qingyan was extremely powerful. Even Chen Xiaofeng might not be able to withstand ten moves from her. He had been wondering why Ye Xuan suddenly had the time to hand out the rewards for the Qingyun sect competition, but now he knew.

This was what he had been planning.

This guy was obviously worried that I would find out about his disciples’ strength, and then take back the Heart-seeking Fruit, so he wanted to get his hands on those rewards in advance!

This guy was too presumptuous! I am the sect leader! How could I do such a thing?

I already said that the Heart-seeking Fruit would be the champion’s reward for the Qingyun sect competition, so how could I go back on my words? Still, I am feeling a strange sense of heartache…

Although Wan Shanhai was standing still, his heart felt as if it was being trampled on by 10,000 horses.

Whoosh!

Ye Xuan had long noticed Wan Shanhai’s arrival.

However, he did not care. He continued to spar with Yue and Li Qingyan with the same expression.

An incomparably sharp sword qi tore through the void and slashed toward Ye Xuan. Seeing this, he calmly raised his bronze sword and easily shattered the attack.

“Wait…”

Wan Shanhai saw this scene and was dumbfounded.

“Could this girl have a Sword physique?”

At the thought of this, Wan Shanhai’s eyes widened in shock.

Although, unlike Ye Xuan, he could not view Yue’s details, he was able to confirm that Yue indeed had an extremely rare Sword physique.

After all, he himself practiced sword qi, and his strength had reached the middle stage of the true core realm. Naturally, he could see from a glance that Yue had a special physique.

Such sharp and destructive sword qi was not something that an ordinary sixth-level true essence realm cultivator could unleash. Only those with a special physique related to the Sword Dao could unleash such sword qi.

“No wonder this guy wanted to take her as his disciple!”

Seeing this, Wan Shanhai could not help but reveal a flash of understanding. Ge finally understood why Ye Xuan wanted to take Yue in as his disciple. He must have discovered that the latter had a special Sword Dao-related physique.

Good Lord, his eye for talent was quite sharp!

How was he able to unearth a genius who was born with a special physique!

Why did I not notice it back then?

When he thought of this, Wan Shanhai was filled with jealousy.

If he had discovered Yue’s special physique in advance, then this precious disciple would have been his!
