Chapter 172: Gongsun Yao

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

In the world of cultivators, anyone under the age of 50 was considered young.

After all, the stronger a cultivator was, the longer their lifespan would be.

Although many core formation realm experts looked to only be around 30-40 years old on the surface, their actual age might have already reached around 70 years of age.

In particular, unity realm experts possessed extremely long lifespans, and the speed at which they aged was extremely slow.

Not only that, the appearance of a unity realm expert would be maintained at the moment they broke through, and it would often last for several hundred years.

Therefore, cultivators below the age of 50 could be considered young in the cultivation world.

The so-called Nanzhou Region Genius Rankings were the benchmark for the younger generation geniuses in the Nanzhou Region. Any cultivator who managed to enter the rankings was considered a true genius.

It was the same for the Tower of Heaven. Clearly, whoever had set up this tower had also wanted to select true geniuses through their own trials.

Boom!

Boom!

At this moment, two huge spatial fluctuations rippled out.

Moments later, everyone suddenly saw the two sides of the Tower of Heaven erupt with brilliant light. Then, two enormous scrolls that hung in the sky slowly unfurled.

Immediately, everyone looked up.

It turned out that these two scrolls represented two lists.

One was the combat power list and the other was the qualification list!

The rankings on these lists went up to 100,000.

These 100,000 ranks seemed to be a lot, but one must remember that they included the countless cultivators present here in the War God Hall.

The Tower of Heaven and the Moon Demon mystic realm had appeared together. No one knew exactly when though.

After all, countless years ago, this mystic realm had appeared in other parts of the world. Hence, no one could determine the exact time when the Moon Demon mystic realm and Tower of Heaven came to be. It could be tens of thousands of years, or it could be hundreds of thousands of years.

Still, countless cultivators had entered the Tower of Heaven during that period, and it was widely known just how difficult it was to get into the rankings.

Moreover, any cultivator who could enter the rankings would obtain bountiful rewards from the Tower of Heaven.

At the same time, in another white space.

Ye Xuan raised his eyelids slightly and looked at the two scrolls indifferently.

The names on the list were densely packed, but he did not recognize them at all.

“So many people have entered the list! The two lists add up to 200,000 places!”

“Hehe! This ranking list is so long. It seems that I still have a chance to get on the list!”

“I also want to get on the list. It is said that any cultivator who can get on the list will receive bountiful rewards!”

“And the higher the rank we obtain, the more generous the rewards!”

When the crowd saw the lists that appeared in the sky, they immediately started a heated discussion.

“Hehe, do you think you have the qualifications to be ranked on the lists?”

Just as everyone was discussing, a disdainful voice suddenly spoke up.

When everyone heard this, they hurriedly looked for the source of the voice and saw a young man carrying a longsword slowly walking over. This young man’s eyes were filled with disdain when he looked at everyone.

They were originally somewhat angry, but when they recognized who it was, their expressions immediately turned fearful.

“Jian Tiannan!”

“The personal disciple of the sect master of the Myriad Swords Temple!”

“A top-notch expert ranked fifth on the Nanzhou Region Genius Rankings!”

“I didn’t expect this guy to be here!”

Many cultivators immediately recognized the young man’s identity.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan also glanced at Jian Tiannan.

This guy actually had a special Sword Dao constitution!

However, Ye Xuan did not care too much. Although this Sword Dao constitution was somewhat special, it could not compare to Yue’s Sword Jade Body, let alone his own Sword Overlord Body.

“What right do you have to make fun of us? Each list has 100,000 places. Although we may not be able to enter the top ranks, we might be able to rank around 80,000 to 90,000?”

Some people knew Jian Tiannan’s identity, but there were also people who did not know. As such, there were some people who voiced their unhappiness.

This person was from a mid-sized empire in the Nanzhou Region. Within his own empire, he was considered a genius, and naturally had his own sense of pride.

Moreover, he was only 22 years old, and had already reached the tenth level of the purple spirit realm. He was only half a step away from reaching the core formation realm.

“Hehe! A bunch of ignorant fools! With your trashy strength, forget about entering the rankings, you won’t even be able to pass the 40th level of the Tower of Heaven!”

Before Jian Tiannan could reply, the pleasant voice of a young girl suddenly could be heard from not far away.

When everyone heard this, they hurriedly looked over.

They saw a young girl around the age of 15 with a ponytail walking over. However, when she looked at that cultivator, her eyes were filled with disdain.

Beside the ponytailed girl stood an extremely beautiful 20-year-old woman.

“They are from the Gongsun Family!”

“Gongsun Wan and Gongsun Yao!”

“Gongsun Wan is only 25 years old, but she has already stepped into the early stage of the true core realm, and is ranked 10th on the Nanzhou Region Genius Rankings!”

“Oh my God! Another top-notch expert!”

“Compared to Gongsun Wan, that Gongsun Yao is the true peerless genius. She has already reached the ninth-level of the purple spirit realm at the age of 16!”

Many knowledgeable people immediately recognized the identities of the two women.

Gongsun Wan and Gongsun Yao were undoubtedly the strongest geniuses of the Gongsun family, and the two were blood-related sisters.

The one who spoke just now was her younger sister, Gongsun Yao. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Impudent! With my strength, how could I not pass the 40th level? You’re underestimating me!”

When that cultivator heard this, he became extremely furious.

He was the strongest genius of his empire, yet he was now being looked down upon by a 15-year-old young girl.

What the f*ck!

“Your strength? You’re just an insignificant piece of trash! I’m only 16 years old, but have already reached the ninth-level of the purple spirit realm. How could you compare yourself to the likes of me?”

Gongsun Yao snorted coldly, and her aura suddenly erupted. When she looked at the cultivator, her eyes were filled with disdain.

When the cultivator saw this, his expression changed drastically.

How was this possible? How could a 16-year-old reach the ninth level of the purple spirit realm? Was that not too monstrous?

As the strongest genius of his empire, at the same age, he had not even reached the purple spirit realm.

This was too terrifying!
