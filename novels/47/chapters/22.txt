The effects of the soul-returning pill were great, so there was no way that the Evil Blood sect did not want it.

What exactly was this guy plotting?

Feng Yitai might be arrogant, but he was just a boorish man. How could he have made such meticulous plans?

Although he successfully bid for the soul-returning pill, Lin You felt an ominous premonition.

“65 million going once…”

“65 million going twice...”

“65 million going thrice…”

“Congratulations to the vice commander of the Shadow Tower for successfully winning the bid for the soul-returning pill.”

Once the female auction host dropped the hammer to close the bidding, the soul-returning pill finally went to the Shadow Tower.

Reality would prove that Lin You’s premonition was accurate.

Feng Yitai would never give up on the soul-returning pill. He planned to mess with the Shadow Tower by raising the price of the item. As for how he would get the soul-returning pill, it was very simple. He could just kill them and steal the goods!

Once the men from the Shadow Tower left the auction house’s territory, the assassins he prepared would immediately take action!

......

“Everyone, the auction is coming to an end. What we are auctioning next is the final treasure of today’s auction!”

At this moment, the female auction host spoke slowly with a smile.

“This treasure is extremely special. To some cultivators, it is a priceless treasure, but to others it might also be a worthless weed!”

“The treasure we are auctioning last is the Xingjian Grass!”

As the female auction host concluded her words, Ye Xuan’s eyes lit up.

He had not expected to encounter Xingjian grass in this auction. What a pleasant surprise…

“Our Evil Blood sect bids 60 million!” Before Ye Xuan spoke, Feng Yitai’s voice rang out.

“I bid 65 million.”

Seeing this, Ye Xuan first looked at Feng Yitai and then spoke faintly.

Seeing this, Feng Yitai became furious. What was going on today? Why were there people competing with him for treasures everywhere? Was the Evil Blood sect’s reputation worthless? Had they been too peaceful recently?

Reckless fellow, I will slaughter your entire family!

In Feng Yitai’s opinion, anyone who bid against him and hindered him from getting what he wanted was his enemy.

Feng Yitai immediately searched for the source of the voice and discovered that the person who was bidding against him was actually a handsome young man.

However, because the young man did not have any sense of presence, he had automatically ignored the latter when he exerted his pressure earlier.

Although Ye Xuan was very famous in the Great Qian Dynasty, and most cultivators had heard of his fame, most people would not recognize his face.

“I bid 70 million.” Feng Yitai looked at Ye Xuan fiercely while slowly uttering those words.

“I bid 75 million.” Ye Xuan did not even look at Feng Yitai, as if these tens of millions of gold coins were nothing but pocket change.

“Damn it! Are you trying to pick a fight?” Feng Yitai flew into a rage.

The moment he saw the Xingjian grass, he had decided to bid for it at all costs.

Moreover, in his eyes, the value of the Xingjian grass far surpassed that of the Violet Orchid that he had bid for before!

His cultivation had reached the tenth level of the purple spirit state ten years ago. However, despite spending ten years cultivating, he was still unable to surpass the bottleneck of the purple spirit state.

Of course, this was not because his aptitude was ordinary, but rather because he had experienced an extremely special opportunity previously.

Nine years ago, he had accidentally entered a mysterious ruin called the sword tomb.

Not only that, he had also absorbed a mysterious sword qi into his dantian. Although that mysterious sword qi did not cause the slightest damage to his dantian, it emitted an invisible power that was fiercely suppressing the purple mansion in his dantian. It was precisely because of this reason that he had been stuck at the peak of the purple spirit state for nine years!

The purple spirit state was the next major state after a cultivator broke through to the true essence state!

When a cultivator’s state reached the peak of the true essence state, if they wanted to break through to the next state, they had to open up the purple mansion in their dantian!

The purple mansion also had another title, which was a cultivator’s second dantian!

If a cultivator successfully opened up their purple mansion, the true essence power in their dantian would pour into their purple mansion, and then slowly transform into a higher level power, becoming the power of the purple spirit!

The more purple spirit power there was in the purple mansion, the stronger the cultivator would be.

In addition, the space within the purple mansion would expand as the cultivator broke through. When the space within the purple mansion reached its limit, the purple spirit power within the purple mansion would rapidly condense and fuse.

When that happened, the cultivator’s dantian would evolve into an empty core!

This state was also known as the core formation state!

If Feng Yitai wanted to step into the core formation state, he had to condense all the purple spirit power in his purple mansion, and then completely fuse it with his purple mansion.

However, due to the mysterious sword qi’s suppression, the purple spirit power in his purple mansion was unable to completely fuse with his purple mansion.

Feng Yitai had tried countless methods to resolve this issue, but to no avail.

Fortunately, the heavens did not disappoint those with good intentions. He had come across a method in a book. If a cultivator could consume the Xingjian grass, they would be able to refine the mysterious sword qi in the purple mansion!

After all, the Xingjian grass contained an extremely special power which would be able to suppress and refine that mysterious sword qi.

It was precisely because of this that Feng Yitai could be said to be constantly inquiring about the whereabouts of Xingjian grass. However, even after spending five years, he still had not found any traces of it.

Originally, he had been about to give up, but he did not expect to actually come across the Xingjian grass in the auction!

The information he obtained previously regarding this auction did not specify that it was auctioning Xingjian grass today. It was obvious that this had been added by the auction house at the last minute.

If he could refine the Xingjian grass and eliminate the suppression of the mysterious sword qi on his purple mansion, he was certain that he could step into the core formation state by relying on his ten years of cultivation accumulation at the peak of the purple spirit state!

Once he truly stepped into the core formation state, he would become one of the most powerful cultivators in the Great Qian dynasty. To him, this was an irresistible temptation!

Therefore, no matter what price he had to pay, he would never miss out on such an opportunity.

Moreover, in his opinion, the Xingjian grass was far more important than the soul-returning pill. After all, even if he successfully won the bid for the soul-returning pill and healed the commander’s injuries, he would still be the Evil Blood sect’s deputy commander in the end!

Facing a powerful core formation state cultivator, he would be nothing but a dog!
