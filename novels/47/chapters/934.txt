935 Reincarnation Dao Fruit

The Thunder-Devouring Beast was not stupid, so it immediately understood what Ye Xuan meant.

So it turned out that the beautiful woman who had just beat him up was his big brother’s wife. He finally understood why Ye Xuan did not dare to help just now.

He secretly looked at Yanran with lingering fear. A natural fear of her had already taken root in his heart.

Quietly, he whispered into Ye Xuan’s ear, “Big Brother, did you get bullied too?”

Just as he finished asking, two huge fists instantly punched his eyes, instantly turning his face into a panda’s.

“Oh my god! Why did you hit my face again?”

“Can you stop? My majestic face has already suffered earlier. If you keep this up, don’t blame me for fighting it out with you!”

After hearing this, Ye Xuan said unhappily, “How can there be such a thing as a henpecked husband in this world? No man would ever be afraid of his wife. There are only men who love their wives.”

“One day, when you meet the person you love deeply, you will understand what I mean.”

Seeing Ye Xuan say these words with a serious expression, the Thunder-Devouring Beast could not help but ponder this matter carefully.

He had never experienced such a thing before, so he was filled with anticipation. After all, he was still very innocent and pure in this regard.

“Big brother, can you tell me what this feeling is like?” the Thunder-Devouring Beast asked curiously, completely ignoring the pain he felt from his face.

The corners of Ye Xuan’s mouth curled up slightly. After tidying up his clothes, he said, “Anyway, you will definitely experience it in the future. I daresay that you will become addicted to this feeling.”

Hearing Ye Xuan’s words, the Thunder-Devouring Beast looked forward to it even more. He could not wait to experience it.

However, when he looked around, he saw that other than Yanran, there was no other lady present, which made him frown.

“Oh… Beautiful lady, where’s my beautiful lady?”

The Thunder-Devouring Beast looked up at the sky and shouted melancholically.

Ye Xuan ignored this shameless Thunder-Devouring Beast, as he had suddenly recalled an important matter, which was the system’s reward for the Scarlet Blood Spirit Fruit.

He had just given the Scarlet Blood Spirit Fruit to Yanran, so logically speaking, there should be a critical reward from the system.

As expected, the moment he thought about this, the system notification immediately rang out.

“Ding! Congratulations! The host has given Yanran the Scarlet Blood Spirit Fruit, and has obtained a critical reward from the system!”

Hearing this notification, Ye Xuan’s heart became even more expectant. What kind of shocking treasure would he receive?

“Ding! Congratulations! The host has obtained a 10,000x critical reward, and received a Reincarnation Dao Fruit!]

After hearing this, Ye Xuan’s body froze, and the excitement in his heart was like a stormy sea that kept rolling back and forth.

‘Reincarnation Dao Fruit!’

He bit his lips as he forcefully suppressed his excitement and maintained a calm demeanor. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

The Reincarnation Dao Fruit was a treasure that could make the people of this world go crazy, and everyone would even fight tooth and nail over it!

It was one of the top-ranked immortal heavenly treasures, and even better than the Chaos Immortal Peach!

As long as one had it, even if one’s original talent was non-existent, one could effortlessly cultivate and reach the eternal realm. It was a fate-changing treasure!

Even eternal realm experts would fight over it.

Ye Xuan looked around carefully and did not make any sound. He also chose not to take out the Reincarnation Dao Fruit and temporarily left it in the system’s space.

After all, as long as he was still in the system’s space, no matter how powerful the others were, they would not be able to detect it.

With Ye Xuan’s current strength, he could not protect this Reincarnation Dao Fruit at all. Hence, he could only conceal it using the system for the time being.

“Put it in the system’s space for now.”

After hearing Ye Xuan’s order, the system sent out another notification.

“Ding! The Reincarnation Dao Fruit will be temporarily placed within the system’s space.”

After doing all this, Ye Xuan gulped down large mouthfuls of fresh air. His back was drenched in cold sweat, and he even looked a little frightened.

Seeing this, Yanran became nervous, as she did not understand what was going on. She asked in a panic, “Is something going to happen again?”

Yanran could clearly see that drops of sweat had appeared on Ye Xuan’s forehead, as if he had encountered a terrifying monster.

Seeing Yanran’s concerned expression, Ye Xuan felt warm, and moments later, pulled her into his embrace. She was shocked, but did not resist.

At this moment, Yanran felt very confused. What was this fellow up to?

Just as Yanran was about to open her mouth to ask, Ye Xuan kissed Yanran’s cheek as he spoke with an excited expression.

“Yanran, you’re my lucky star now. I really love you.”

Hearing this, Yanran was even more confused.

What did I just do?

Why did he say that?

What was going on here?

Despite her confusion, she still smiled. In any case, if she made her sweetheart happy, it was all fine and dandy.

Honestly, if she had known what Ye Xuan had just received from the system, she would have been completely flabbergasted and mind-blown.
