639 Mine? No, Your Peak Is Better!

Gao Tianyu could not help but tremble when he saw everyone’s eyes on him. He turned around and looked behind him.

Unfortunately, there was no one behind him, which made him all the more nervous.

Uh oh…

Gao Tianyu turned back, and saw that the crowd’s eyes were still fixed on him. Then, he shamelessly said, “Which one of you is Gao Tianyu?”

No one answered for a long time, so he waved his hand and said, “So Gao Tianyu isn’t here.”

“By the way, junior sister, why are you looking for Gao Tianyu?”

Gao Tianyu pretended to be calm. At this point, he did not dare to take any risks.

After all, he had come here to join in the fun and did not want to be the subject of the fun. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Besides, even if this little girl could not defeat him, he did not dare to lay a hand on her. After all, she was Ye Xuan’s disciple.

Even his father would not have the guts to do so.

For this reason, he put up an act.

Seeing that Gao Tianyu was not here, Xiang Yun looked very disappointed.

After all, she clearly remembered that her teacher had told her that her senior sister had beaten up Gao Tianyu.

She said in an unpleasant tone as she waved her hammer around a few times.

“Why didn’t he come? I can’t even beat him up if he’s not here.”

Gao Tianyu’s heart turned cold when he heard this.

‘If I remember correctly, I didn’t provoke you, so why do you want to beat me up?’

Xiang Yun suddenly thought of a good idea. She looked at Gao Tianyu and said with a smile, “Senior Brother, you should know the way, right? Can you take me to Hidden Sword peak?”

Hearing this, Gao Tianyu immediately refused.

“Cough cough… Actually, I’m not very familiar with that place but Junior Sister, I suggest that you don’t go to that place. After all, there are many terrifying monsters there. It’s very scary, so it’s better not to go.”

“You’re not lying to me, are you?”

Xiang Yun became even more excited when she heard that there were terrifying monsters there.

When everyone saw Gao Tianyu’s expression, they all laughed inwardly.

Why was the eldest disciple of Hidden Sword peak acting so cowardly now? It was really quite refreshing to see him become so timid in front of a little girl.

However, some people just wanted to watch the world burn.

“Junior Sister, there’s nothing fun to do here at the main peak. How about we take you to Hidden Sword peak?”

“I heard that there’s a good place on top of the peak with many rare swords. If you can break that place apart with one strike, we’ll be convinced of your strength.”

Upon hearing this, Gao Tianyu’s face darkened, but Xiang Yun became even more excited.

“That’s great. Hurry up and take me to Hidden Sword peak.”

Gao Tianyu’s face turned pale with fear. He looked at the disciple who had just made the suggestion and made his decision.

“You’re the one who started it anyway, so you can’t blame me. I’ll do the opposite.”

Thinking of this, Gao Tianyu suggested, “Junior Sister, Hidden Sword peak is not fun. How about I bring you to Sword Spirit peak?”

“Sword Spirit peak is the most interesting place, and there are many exotic beasts there, many of which you may not have seen before.”

Hearing this, the people from Sword Spirit peak were shocked.

F*ck! Gao Tianyu was so evil!

“Don’t, don’t, don’t. Sword Spirit peak is not interesting at all. How about we go to Returning Clouds peak instead? That place is very interesting.”

“I’m just saying, isn’t it better to go to the Skyreach peak? The mountain peak is so tall that it reaches the clouds. It’s tall, sturdy, and majestic.”

“No, no, no. Junior Sister, please listen to my advice and head to Water Sky peak instead. After all, that place is full of beautiful sisters. It’ll definitely be interesting to play with them.”

At this moment, the main peak was in chaos. These people were all trying to prevent Xiang Yun from going over to their respective peaks.

At this moment, Elder Huang rushed over. When he saw the ruined study hall, his face turned as black as charcoal.

“Who did this? Show yourself!” Elder Huang shouted angrily.

He had only left for such a short time, yet the place had gone up in smoke.

After hearing Elder Huang’s shout, the crowd quieted down at once and made way for him, allowing him to see the high-spirited Xiang Yun.

Elder Huang could not hold it in and spat out blood.

Puchi …

After coughing for a while, Elder Huang finally calmed down a little. He was so angry that he almost lost his life.

Where did the hammer come from? He did not see it when she came over this morning.

He had reminded her several times before he left, but who could have expected that his study hall would be gone in just five minutes?

“Elder Huang, don’t die. Pull yourself together!”

Seeing that Elder Huang had fainted from the blow, the surrounding disciples quickly came forward and shook his body.

After a long time, Elder Huang finally regained consciousness. He looked at the study that had been reduced to ruins and felt a chill run down his spine.

It was all his fault. He should not have accepted the two treasures Ye Xuan gave him.

After taking a deep breath, Elder Huang finally adjusted himself. He did not scold Xiang Yun. Instead, he came to her side with a kind expression, “Little Xiang Yun, why did you do this?”

Xiang Yun pondered for a moment before she replied, “They didn’t believe that I could destroy the study hall with my hammer. Li Yi even called me a liar.”
