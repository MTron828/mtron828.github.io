849 Life-Saving Pills

“Congratulations! You have obtained 100 immortal-grade Recovery pills!” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Ye Xuan was ecstatic!

He had 7, but now had 107!

Hahaha! Killing him would be a nigh impossible feat now.

“This is great.”

After taking a deep breath, Ye Xuan felt unprecedentedly relaxed. In all honesty, he probably would not be able to finish using them all, and would be able to give some to those around him as well.

No matter what the future had, he would not need to be afraid at all, as these pills would guarantee his safety, as well as the safety of those around him.

He then placed the pills into his storage space, and turned his attention back to his disciples.

As time passed, Zhuge Yueyue woke up after her body had recovered to its peak condition.

“Teacher, I’ve reached the late stage of the mystic lord realm. It really feels like a dream. Furthermore, the spiritual power you imparted was so pure, that it did not cause any negative effects to my body or cultivation.”

Zhuge Yueyue was extremely happy at this moment. She had thought that it would take a lot of time to completely absorb the spiritual power, but thanks to the Hunyuan Xuan cultivation technique, everything proceeded smoothly.

“Perhaps this is the effect of the immortal heavenly treasure,” Ye Xuan said after waving his hand.

“That’s good. I hope that the two of you can properly cultivate the Hunyuan Xuan technique that I imparted to you. As long as you can cultivate it to the great success stage, it will definitely be of great use to you.”

“With the help of this powerful cultivation technique, you will be no weaker than those geniuses.”

“Alright, Teacher, don’t worry. I’ll definitely do my best!”

Moments later, Feng Xiyun regained consciousness. After Ye Xuan examined her condition, he smiled in relief.

Even though Feng Xiyun was only at the early stage of the mystic lord realm, she had reached the benchmark for those regarded as geniuses, and would be able to hold her own against them.

Originally, Ye Xuan was most worried about Feng Xiyun. After all, he also felt that he doted on his eldest disciple much more than his second disciple, so he felt very guilty.

Fortunately, Feng Xiyun did not take this to heart and had never complained.

“Thank you, Teacher”

After waking up, Feng Xiyun also thanked him. She was also very happy. She had always been a gentle and refined person, and for the most part disliked conflict, unlike Xiang Yun.

These three disciples had different personalities, but they had something in common, which was that they all cared about their teacher very much.

It was also because of this that Ye Xuan felt very gratified.

After hearing these words, Ye Xuan burst out laughing and rubbed her head.

“Since you are my disciples, it is my responsibility to help you become stronger.”

“I don’t wish for much except that my disciples will be safe and happy throughout their lifetimes.”

After hearing these words, the two of them felt their hearts tremble. They knew how good their teacher had been to them, and that he had done everything in his power to make them stronger.

However, they did not know how they could reciprocate.

After thinking for a moment, Zhuge Yueyue pulled Ye Xuan’s arm and said happily, “Teacher, can I make you some delicious food?”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan nodded and agreed.

After receiving Ye Xuan’s agreement, Zhuge Yueyue smiled brightly.

“Alright, I’ll get to work now. Just wait for a bit. I’ll serve up some delicious food soon.”

As soon as she finished speaking, Zhuge Yueyue headed toward the kitchen, which had not been used for a long time.

After Xiang Yun reached the void realm, and no longer needed to eat, she did not use it much. After that, she would only make food when Xiang Yun insisted on eating, and most of the time it was roasted potatoes.

However, Xiang Yun had already fallen unconscious, and the entire Cloud Sky peak had become much less lively after that.

“First Sister, wait for me. I’ll go with you…”

As she spoke, Feng Xiyun also hurriedly followed.

Seeing the two of them happy, Ye Xuan stood alone and smiled. Suddenly, he discovered a figure rushing toward Cloud Sky peak quickly.

Looking closely, he realized that the person was Hua Rufeng.

“Greetings, Martial Uncle Ye,” Hua Rufeng said respectfully. Ye Xuan went straight to the point and asked, “Rufeng, why are you looking for me today?”

Hearing this, Hua Rufeng was at a loss. He had originally planned to beat around the bust for a while, but who knew that Ye Xuan would be so direct?

Oh well…

He could only tell Ye Xuan everything in detail.
