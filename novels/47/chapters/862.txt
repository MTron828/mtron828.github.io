863 Waiting Anxiously

Although she was suffering from extreme pain, Feng Xiyun’s will was still very firm. She gritted her teeth and persevered.

After shouting, Feng Xiyun once again mobilized her own strength and continuously suppressed the power of the Heaven Burning Flames in her body, while comprehending the profundity within it. As she did, the divine bone in Feng Xiyun’s body was continuously transforming, and was on the verge of becoming an immortal bone. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Seeing this, Ye Xuan judged that this was the juncture for him to go all out. Therefore, he did not continue to restrain himself and said, “Maximum concentration now! I’ll help you with the final push!”

Alright,” Feng Xiyun replied with a serious expression. This was the critical moment for the transformation, so after sensing more power was being transmitted into her body, she focused wholeheartedly on refining it.

Outside, the surging winds grew hot, and the clouds began to glow red. Then, flames erupted over Cloud Sky peak, causing the whole peak to tremble.

This caught the attention of everyone in the sect, and they all raised their heads to look in the direction of Cloud Sky peak.

“My god! The Heaven Burning Flames really live up to their name. Hearing about it and seeing it in person is completely different,” Gao Shun exclaimed in surprise.

At this moment, Zhuge Yueyue was the most anxious. Since the Heaven Burning Flames had appeared, it was definitely related to her second sister. Thus, she was very concerned for the latter’s safety. However, she could do nothing but watch and wait.

“Rufeng, what exactly is going on? Why did Junior Brother Ye attack Elder Qianyi just now?” Ao Lei asked. This was the most pressing matter.

“Martial Uncle Ao, I don’t know what happened, but when Elder Qian Yi said that he also came from Cloud Sky peak, Martial Uncle’s Ye gaze seemed to change.”

“Then, he personally checked on Elder Qian Yi’s condition and said that there was a problem with his cultivation.”

“Everything was fine at that point, but Martial Uncle Ye suddenly attacked Elder Qian Yi after that, and severely injured him. His cultivation has probably been crippled.”

“Because it all happened so quickly, I didn’t have the courage to ask, and instead fled to seek help from you.”

After hearing Hua Rufeng’s words, everyone felt even more confused. Things were fine earlier, and Ye Xuan had even helped to point out the problems in Elder Qian Yi’s cultivation. Why did he attack Elder Qian Yi out of the blue? It was completely mind-boggling.

However, Ao Lei also trusted Ye Xuan. Perhaps there was some kind of secret behind this, and it might also be related to Cloud Sky peak. There was also the issue of the Heaven Burning Flames…

Everyone was anxious, but could only wait outside the peak. Gao Shun restlessly pacing about as well, which made the atmosphere even more tense.

Ye Xuan was usually a calm and taciturn person. However, when he made a move, the whole world would tremble. Therefore, they were all worried that something big had happened.

In the meantime, Ye Xuan had just finished transmitting the final bits of power into Feng Xiyun’s body, and was now using his spiritual power to protect her. As the power of the Heaven Burning Flames continued to purify her body, her transformation continued.

However, she was also in intense pain, and was struggling to endure it bitterly. Even her blood was being purified by the Heaven Burning Flames, and the terrifying power coursed unrelentingly through her veins, raising the temperature of her surroundings significantly. Sweating, she doggedly refused to give up. She would not let her teacher down!

At this moment…

Boom!
