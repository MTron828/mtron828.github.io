703 The Reincarnation Fairy’s Full Power (Part 2)

Then, a familiar door appeared in the sky, seemingly more unfathomable than ever.

This excited the onlookers.

“Zhuge Yueyue has guts, but she’s no match for the Reincarnation Fairy who has unleashed the Profound Jade Lotus technique.”

“Even so, after seeing this, I can feel my blood boiling. This is what a real cultivator’s state of mind should be, right? Never giving up!”

“As a cultivator, we have to forcefully fight for our own destiny. No matter how great the difficulties we encounter are, we have to face them and overcome them.”

“Even if we know that we are outmatched, we have to give it our all!”

Zhuge Yueyue’s actions had completely stirred up the crowd’s emotions, causing the atmosphere to intensify. People were really looking forward to seeing whether she could beat the odds and defeat the Reincarnation Fairy.

“Let’s begin!”

After activating the door in the sky,, Zhuge Yueyue flew into the clouds and floated in front of Fairy Reincarnation.

The Reincarnation Fairy, on the other hand, seemed to be a completely different person from before. Her eyes seemed to be devoid of emotion as she stared at Zhuge Yueyue coldly.

“Seal!”

As soon as she finished speaking, a large green cage instantly condensed around Zhuge Yueyue.

However, at this moment, Zhuge Yueyue’s sword beams came flashing down, shattering the green cage.

Seeing this, the Reincarnation Fairy was very surprised. However, she immediately condensed a jade lotus under her feet and flew higher into the clouds. Then, she erupted with even more terrifying power as she formed a new hand seal and attacked Zhuge Yueyue.

Zhuge Yueyue had also flown higher into the clouds, and swung the Cloud Sky Sword to counter the attack.

“Clang!”

Seeing this scene, everyone was stunned.

After the light dissipated, the two of them were nowhere to be seen. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Then

Spatial fluctuations swept out from the entrance of the ancient realm, and the two of them appeared in the sky outside.

“Uh… The two of them were really eliminated together?”

Seeing this, Ye Xuan’s figure flashed and caught Zhuge Yueyue.

Daoist Xu Yun sent out a wave of spiritual power and pulled the Reincarnation Fairy over to him.

Zhuge Yueyue had suffered a severe injury, and spat out a mouthful of dark red blood.

Thus, Ye Xuan took out a medicinal pill and fed it to her, stabilizing her condition.

The Reincarnation Fairy’s situation was not any better. Her face turned pale and she fainted before she could say a word.

“Teacher, I’m sorry. I didn’t win” Zhuge Yueyue said dejectedly, looking very uncomfortable.

She had been cultivating diligently in preparation for the gathering, but had failed at the last hurdle, so she felt very guilty.

Ye Xuan rubbed her head and comforted her, “Girl, there’s no reason to feel guilty. Your performance just now was something to feel proud about.”

“Your courage to stand up and fight even when outmatched is admirable. I am very proud of you. ”

Hearing this, Zhuge Yuetue’s eyes were instantly filled with tears.

“Alright, you should quickly adjust your condition first. Leave the rest to your third sister.”

Ye Xuan smiled in a relaxed manner. That being said, even Ye Xuan did not expect that his last disciple standing would be Xiang Yun.

Now, there was only Hua Rufeng, Xiang Yun and the final remaining disciple from the earlier four disciples who had been playing dead, who was from the Godwind Academy.

At this moment, Xiang Yun’s emotions were in turmoil again
