342 I’m About To Leave

“Oh?” When Ye Xuan heard this, he raised his brows slightly and looked at Shangguan Wan’er with a mysterious gaze.

“Perhaps you still trust me now, but once you awaken all of your memories, you may not think the same way anymore.”

“A teacher for a day is a teacher for life!” Shangguan Wan’er said with a determined look.

“Oh? Why do I remember that the saying was supposed to be a teacher for a day is a father for life?” Ye Xuan said teasingly.

Hearing this, Shangguan Wan’er’s face stiffened.

He wanted to be her father now?

Looking at Shangguan Wan’er’s expression, Ye Xuan was amused.

“Alright, I won’t tease you anymore. You should stabilize your cultivation foundation since the epiphany hasn’t ended yet.”

“Ten days later, head over to the Nanzhou Region and do something on my behalf.”

Ye Xuan smiled and stopped teasing Shangguan Wan’er. Then, he brought up some serious business.

Thanks to the power of karma, Ye Xuan knew that the Nanzhou Region would be attacked by the sea race and faced the threat of destruction.

He owed the Gongsun family a favor. If they wanted to survive, they most likely had to use the spiritual sense jade token he had given them.

However, Ye Xuan was tied up now. The opportunity in the endless sea involved the passage to the upper world, and he absolutely could not miss this opportunity.

With Shangguan Wan’er’s current strength, she would be able to defeat anyone below the King realm.

In addition, with the trump cards Ye Xuan had left her, even if a great emperor realm expert made a move, she would be able to survive.

Having her handle this matter was the best solution he had.

Five days later, Ye Xuan’s spiritual sense became stronger, and he once again regained perfect control over his own power.

After that, Ye Xuan called his disciples over and performed spiritual power infusion, as well as gave them heavenly treasures and cultivation resources.

Based on what the power of karma told him, he would be leaving the Tianyuan continent soon. At that time, he would not be able to accompany his disciples any longer.

Before that, Ye Xuan had to do his best to give them powerful trump cards and improve the strength of his disciples as much as possible.

However, the spiritual power in Ye Xuan’s dantian was as vast as the ocean, no less than that of a second-level great emperor.

Among his disciples, only Shangguan Wan’er, who had awakened the Undying Xuan Huang sword physique, could withstand a little more spiritual power than the other three.

“Ding! As the host has infused spiritual power into his disciple, amounting to 1,188 days’ worth of cultivation, the host has received a randomized 16x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained 19,008 days’ worth of cultivation!”

“Ding! As the host has infused spiritual power into his disciple, amounting to 1,887 days’ worth of cultivation, the host has received a randomized 36x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained 67,932 days’ worth of cultivation!”

“Ding! As the host has infused spiritual power into his disciple, amounting to 2,000 days’ worth of cultivation, the host has received a randomized 35x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained 70,000 days’ worth of cultivation!”

“Ding! As the host has infused spiritual power into his disciple, amounting to 7,884 days’ worth of cultivation, the host has received a randomized 19x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained 149,796 days’ worth of cultivation!”

After the spiritual power infusions, Ye Xuan’s strength increased greatly again. Even among second-level great emperors, he was definitely one of the strongest.

After that, it was time for the other stuff.

“Ding! As the host has given his disciple the supreme emperor divine pill (eighth-grade pill) to his disciple, the host has received a randomized 3x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the dragon transformation divine pill (eighth-grade pill)!”

“Ding! As the host has given his disciple the dragon transformation divine pill (eighth-grade pill)…”

“Ding! As the host has taught his disciple the freedom spiritual sense tempering technique, the host has received a randomized 18x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the great freedom spiritual sense tempering technique!”

…

Ye Xuan continued to give and teach them stuff. There was an extremely high chance that he would leave the Tianyuan continent, and would not meet again for a long time.

His disciples were quite confused by his actions.

Although they knew that their teacher was a human-shaped mobile treasure vault, he had never given them so many rare treasures at once before.

It was a shocking amount!

“My precious disciples, I might have to leave the Tianyuan continent soon,” Ye Xuan explained.

When they heard this, they froze.

What? Teacher was leaving the Tianyuan continent?

Could it be that his cultivation level was about to break through the shackles of the great emperor realm and ascend?

“You should all know that if one wants to leave the Tianyuan continent, one must surpass the shackles of the great emperor realm. However, I have another way to leave!”

“My time with the Tianyuan continent ends here. The upper world is where I must go next,” Ye Xuan said with a smile.

“But you don’t have to worry. With the heavenly treasures and cultivation resources I’ve left behind, you’ll definitely be able to reach the great emperor realm in the future.”

“Perhaps one day, we will be reunited.”

Among his current disciples, other than Shangguan Wan’er, who was rather powerful, the others were comparatively weaker, though not in terms of potential. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Each and every one of them had the potential to reach the great emperor realm!

Furthermore, with the life-saving trump cards he left behind, even a third-level great emperor would not be able to harm them.

“My precious disciples, I’ll be waiting for you in the upper world. In the future, you must cultivate well and never relax.”

Ye Xuan saw the reluctance in his disciples’ eyes and his heart was filled with emotion.

Through the power of karma, Ye Xuan could vaguely see the future of the Tianyuan continent. There were four great empresses with terrifying auras suppressing the era and leading the human race to become the absolute ruler of the Tianyuan continent.

Not only that, Shangguan Wan’er would comprehend the highest level of slaughter intent and become the terrifying Empress of Slaughter.

After that, because of him, she almost annihilated the sea race alone.
