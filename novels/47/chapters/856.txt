857 Stellar Sword Technique

Sigh… Forget it.

There was nothing he could do about it, after all. The best course of action now would be to make good use of these three chances.

‘Eh? Wait a minute…’

He suddenly glanced at Feng Xiyun, who was standing beside him, and an idea popped up,

If he helped complete Feng Xiyun’s Heaven Burning Flames technique, would he not be able to receive another reward from the system?

It was worth a shot!

However, if it failed, he would have wasted a precious chance to improve a cultivation technique…

He decided that the other two chances would be used on his Flora sword technique and the immortal-grade body-refining technique, as these techniques were directly related to his cultivation and strength.

The others would have to wait. Hopefully, this gamble to improve the Heaven Burning Flames technique would pay off.

‘It’s settled! Gotta give it a go!’ 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

After confirming his decision, Ye Xuan muttered inwardly, “System, help me complete the Flora sword technique and the immortal-grade body refining technique!”

“Ding! Congratulations! The host has obtained the full version of the immortal-grade Flora sword technique and the immortal-grade body refining technique!”

Whoa!

Upon completion, both had become bona fide immortal-grade techniques.

Ye Xuan’s heart trembled violently with joy.

‘Haha, Elder Qian Yi, you’re really my lucky charm!’

‘From now on, if anyone dares to provoke you in the future, just call me and I’ll help you beat them up!’

However, at this moment, another system notification rang out.

“The system has detected that there is a cultivation technique that can be upgraded. Do you want to upgrade it immediately?”

Oh? Upgrade?

Unsure, but full of anticipation, he muttered, “Upgrade!”

“Ding! Congratulations! The Flora sword technique has been upgraded. The host has obtained a peak immortal-grade technique, Stellar sword Technique!”

“Heavens!”

Ye Xuan sucked in a breath of cold air. It took him a long time to calm down. He then examined the Stellar sword technique, following which his jaw dropped.

The Stellar sword technique had a total of nine moves. The power it could unleash was on a totally different level. It was downright shocking!

When he examined the technique in his sea of consciousness, he saw a strange-looking plant with nine leaves growing on it. Each leaf represented one of Ye Xuan’s sword moves.

The leaves at the bottom were the same as the Flora sword technique, while the leaves above were still a little blurry, as Ye Xuan had yet to comprehend these sword moves. Thus, he could only truly unleash the full power of the Stellar sword technique after he grasped the profoundness of these sword moves.

“Oh my god, if I really master the Stellar sword technique, won’t I be able to destroy the galaxy with a casual wave of my hand?”

Even he himself did not expect that such a terrifying sword technique would actually exist in this world. After pondering the technique for a moment, Ye Xuan had already gained some understanding of it. He had even gained some insights into the Great Dao.

A person was born in darkness. Heaven and earth were above all things. One’s life and death could be determined by one’s words.

In this world where strength determined everything, what was honor?

If one wanted to obtain glory, they could only rely on the sword in their hands to destroy their enemies.

With the help of this Stellar Sword Technique, Ye Xuan would be able to carve out his own legacy in this universe.

Ye Xuan suddenly thought of something.

“Cough cough, I am not the kind of person who likes to fight. However, outsiders believe that I am extremely ruthless.”

“All along, I have been using virtue to convince others…”

As he mulled on this, Ye Xuan became even more excited and understood something in his heart…
