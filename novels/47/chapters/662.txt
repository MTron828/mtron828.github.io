663 Besieged (Part 1)

Zhuge Yueyue was very clear about Xiang Yun’s strength.

If those people from the Supreme Divine sect wanted to deal with her, they would probably end up in a miserable state.

Thinking this, Zhuge Yueyue immediately moved closer to Xiang Yun and whispered.

“Third Sister, did you notice that group of people?”

Looking in the direction Zhuge Yueyue was pointing, Xiang Yun nodded.

Zhuge Yueyue continued, “Those people are our enemies. When they attack us, you can smash them with your hammer and attack with all of your might, okay?”

“Hehe, alright! Let me do it. I’m the best at smashing things!”

She happily twirled the hammer in her hand. It turned out that she was already so bored that she had become sleepy. Now, she had something to look forward to.

After saying this, Zhuge Yueyue looked at Feng Xiyun and said, “Second Sister, I’ll head up first later. You’ll be in charge of staying back and taking care of Xiang Yun.”

“Alright…”

After Feng Xiyun agreed, she held Xiang Yun’s small hand tightly. Otherwise, she was afraid that this little girl would charge at the Supreme Divine sect’s disciples immediately if she let go.

After a while, Mu Beichen suddenly stood up and stretched his muscles. He said lazily, “It’s about time…” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

With that, he held the sword in one hand and instantly rushed up the mountain.

Seeing that Mu Beichen had already taken action, the Reincarnation Fairy followed closely behind and began her climb to the top.

“The show has begun…”

Seeing that two geniuses had already started to move, everyone else who had been waiting all made their move.

However, Zhuge Yueyue remained where she was, keeping a close eye on Xie Tianyu’s movements.

After a while, Xie Tianyu finally could not restrain himself and started climbing. Seeing this, Zhuge Yueyue waved at her junior sisters and quickly followed him.

According to the rules, only one person could reach the top of this towering mountain.

Every time a participant advanced a certain distance, they would encounter an opponent, and those who were close by would likely become their opponents.

It was precisely for this reason that Zhuge Yueyue was waiting for the Supreme Divine sect disciples. She wanted to end their journey at this gathering prematurely.

However, the moment she set off, dozens of people from the Supreme Divine sect immediately surrounded Feng Xiyun and Xiang Yun.

Seeing this situation, the atmosphere suddenly became tense.

“What are these people trying to do?”

“Could it be that the Supreme Divine sect wants to eliminate those two right now?”

People started whispering to each other. Those who were about to leave stopped in unison, staying to watch the show instead.

After all, they had all seen the conflict between the two sects before the entrance to the ancient realm opened, so they knew that something big was about to happen.

“The show is about to begin…”

“Can Feng Xiyun and her junior sister survive this crisis?”

The onlookers had no intention of helping at all, and retreated to watch from a safe distance.

“Hehe, no one will help you this time, right?”

Liu Yun from the Supreme Divine sect sneered.

Hearing this, Feng Xiyun still looked calm and composed.

“Help? Do you think that with your mediocre skills, you’re worthy of me asking for help?”

Feng Xiyun retorted disdainfully.

“Tsk, you can be arrogant all you want. You’ll cry for help later,” Liu Yun said fiercely.

“Third Sister, you can start now. Go and play to your heart’s content.”

“Yes, Second Sister! Just watch me!”

As soon as she finished speaking, Xiang Yun rubbed her fists and picked her hammer off the ground.

“Come at me, scrubs!”

Being provoked by a six-year-old little girl was completely unbearable, and the disciples of the Supreme Divine sect immediately flew into a rage.

“Damned little girl, I will teach you a good lesson today!”

As soon as he finished speaking, four people from the Supreme Divine sect attacked her together.

Fierce attacks came one after another. Had it been anyone else, their first thought would be to dodge the attacks.

However, Xiang Yun had never been afraid and chose to fight head-on.

She raised the hammer in her hand high and swung it at the attacks…

Boom!

When the explosion from the impact dissipated, everyone who witnessed this scene was completely dumbfounded.

“My goodness…”

Streaks of purple lightning crackled, stirring up a cloud of dust.

By the time the dust settled, the four people who had just attacked had already fallen to the ground, their bodies still twitching.

“Whoa… She’s too powerful…”

Everyone present was extremely shocked. Liu Yun even involuntarily took a few steps back.

Who would have known that this seemingly harmless little girl could actually erupt with such astonishing power?

...

This was definitely fake! An illusion!

“Haha, it seems like your Supreme Divine sect isn’t worth the effort,” Feng Xiyun mocked, her eyes filled with disdain.

During this process, she just stood there calmly and left the fighting completely to Xiang Yun.

“How arrogant!”

Liu Yun was infuriated, and erupted with his full strength.

Behind him, the remaining disciples of the Supreme Divine sect released their auras and prepared to rush forward.

“No one can save you both today! Attack!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Liu Yun charged forward…
