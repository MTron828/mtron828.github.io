Chapter 1310: In the main hall of 1311

“PA, PA, PA!”

“Ah, ah, ah!”

“You...”

Crisp sounds and sounds of pain rang out in front of the Heavenly Sword Sect’s Island. Everyone looked at this scene in a daze.

The five princes of the Radiant Dragon Dynasty, the princes with noble statuses, ended up letting out miserable cries here.

This...

“I’m afraid only Wang Xian would dare to slap the faces of the five princes of the Radiant Dragon dynasty in front of everyone!”

“The winner has been announced. The crown prince position of the Radiant Dragon Empire will be inherited by the second prince. Even if the Radiant Dragon Empire knew that the five princes were beaten, they wouldn’t say anything!”

“This Wang Xian’s strength is really terrifying. Long Xiaochen is ranked seventh on the prodigy roll. Wang Xian has the strength of at least the first level of the Seethrough Realm!”

“There are so many monstrous prodigies on our side this year. Nameless Sword Demon, Ling Jian ‘er, and Ren Xingchen all have the combat strength of the Seethrough realm. Now, there’s also that Zhang Fengying Wang Xian. There are a total of five monstrous prodigies who are comparable to the Seethrough Realm!”

“There are so many heaven’s favorites. There is always another mountain higher. This year’s Heaven’s favorites ranking is considered to be a more dazzling one!”

When the crowd saw Wang Xian easily slapping the five princes of the Radiant Dragon Empire, they sighed and thought of the heaven’s favorites today. They all felt as if they were born at the wrong time.

There were a total of five monstrous heaven’s favorites this year.

If Qian ye was included, there were a total of six.

In the past, it was rare for anyone under the age of 50 to have the strength of the insightful void tier.

However, there were six this year.

What everyone did not know was that the six heaven’s favorites who had the strength of the first level of the insightful void tier were related to Wang Xian.

The nameless sword demon was Wang Xian!

Qian ye was killed by Wang Xian!

Ren Xingchen was saved twice by Wang Xian. Furthermore, Wang Xian was the one who gave him the golden water sword principle!

Ling Jian ‘er was also saved twice by Wang Xian!

As for Zhang Fengying, there was no need to mention that her bloodline and beast taming techniques came from Wang Xian.

Come to think of it, these freaks were all caused by Wang Xian.

If the people in the tomb of the human and demon knew about this, they would definitely be in an uproar.

“We Surrender!”

“I surrender, I surrender!”

At this moment, the terrified voices of the five princes’subordinates could be heard.

Wang Xian, who was slapping his face, looked towards the battlefield. A smile appeared on his face.

With a wave of his arm, the thorns in his hand disappeared.

“Haha, a wise choice. All of you are from the Guanglong dynasty in the future. There is no need to fight to the death. If all of you are willing to join my long Xiaotian’s subordinates, I will welcome all of You Here!”

“As long as all of you are loyal, in the future, I will definitely not mistreat each and every one of you!”

Long Xiaotian saw that his brothers’subordinates had surrendered and laughed loudly. He floated in the sky and roared in high spirits.

Following Long Xiaotian’s words, everyone stopped.

The subordinates of the five princes floated in the sky with extremely ugly expressions.

They were completely no match for the other party. Even if they had a huge advantage in numbers, the gap was too big in front of a top-tier power.

Especially those ten or so half-step void interpretation flying birds. They were completely killing machines.

“This... how... how could this be!”

Long Xiaochen and the others clenched their fists tightly when they saw this scene.

Their scarred faces were filled with malevolence and powerlessness!

They had lost, completely and utterly lost!

They still wanted to think of a way to completely defeat Long Xiaotian in the next seven months.

But now, they had lost!

They had lost so completely that the power of five people was not as strong as one person!

“Hu!”

The five of them looked at each other, their faces ashen as they flew towards the direction of the Light Dragon Dynasty’s Island.

Today’s battle had completely disqualified them from continuing the game.

There was no need for them to continue. They could already return to the imperial city.

Unless, they were like the eighth prince, risking their lives to fight.

But now, it seemed that even if they were to risk their lives to fight, there was only a one percent chance of defeating the second prince.

After today, Long Xiaotian’s forces would become stronger and stronger.

When everyone around saw this scene, they looked at the second prince who was in high spirits. Their eyes sparkled.

There was an 80% to 90% chance that the king of the Dragon Dynasty would be the second prince in the future!

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian looked at long Xiaotian and revealed a smile on his face. After greeting him, he looked at Zhang Fengying and the two of them flew towards their residence.

“What have you been doing in the demi-human graveyard? Picking Up Girls?”

When they arrived at Wang Xian’s residence, Zhang Fengying looked at the courtyard and asked Wang Xian.

“Erm... I’m here to gain experience and improve my strength. How would I have the time to pick up girls?”

Wang Xian shook his head speechlessly. “Next, I’m going to upgrade my level to the insightful void stage before leaving. Why Don’t you go to the Divine Wind Academy and follow me to the blood refinement ground in a few days?”

“Alright!”

Zhang Fengying nodded.

In the next few days, Wang Xian, he yuan, Long Xiaotian, and the rest played around for a few days.

A few days later, he yuan left. Long Xiaotian, who had basically secured his position as the crown prince, led his subordinates to the Huiguang Dragon dynasty to settle some matters. He would return in a month.

Wang Xian brought Zhang Fengying directly into the blood refinement ground and began to hunt and devour crazily.

For the next three months or so, they stayed in the blood refinement ground.

They killed more than ten thousand ferocious beasts.

“I’m still short of nearly 300 million dragon crystals!”

Three months had passed, and Wang Xian was still short of nearly 300 million dragon crystals to level up. 300 million was not a lot, but it was definitely not a small amount.

“In the past three months, I’ve basically gone to all the places that I can go to in the blood refinement ground. I’ve even killed hundreds of demonic beasts. It’s going to be difficult to continue to obtain spiritual essence and blood!”

Riding on the demonic qilin, Wang Xian frowned slightly.

Beside him, Zhang Fengying was also riding on a demonic qilin. This was another demonic beast that they had tamed in the past two months.

“Let’s go to the main hall and take a look!”

Wang Xian thought to himself.

Wang Xian had already wreaked havoc in the four major areas of the human-demon graveyard, the Heaven’s pride stage, the training ground, and the blood refinement ground.

Only the most dangerous area of the tomb of the human-demon race had not been visited by the main hall.

The main hall was the stage for the insightful emptiness realm experts. It was very difficult to survive there without reaching the insightful emptiness realm!
