Chapter 665: Get On Your Knees And Prepare To Be Killed

Translator: Larbrestudio

“Wood Fire Burial!”

The group of five middle-aged and old men shouted. The next instant, the densely packed tree demons in the surroundings trapped and cornered a hundred disciples from the Gautama denominations and over two hundred cultivators from other forces in India.

Just as the tree demons trapped the cultivators, huge fireballs were hurled onto the tree demons.

Boom!

In an instant, the densely packed tree demons that had covered over three to four kilometers were set ablaze at a rapid speed.

Terrifying waves of fire swept across, killing over a hundred weaker martial artists directly.

“This... How terrifying! How terrifying!”

The remaining martial artists from the Underworld stared at the terrifying sea of flames.

The fire burned the wood and wood spurred the growth of the fire!

Wood Fire Burial!

Argh!

At this moment, blood-curdling screams sounded from the middle of the Wood Fire Burial. Suddenly, two figures shot towards the sky.

They were surrounded by blinding golden rays and were escaping into the sky at an incredible speed.

“Will you be able to escape?”

Elder Hua stared at the two Budding Realm experts who had escaped as he placed the truncheon in his hands on the ground.

Weng!

What the surrounding crowd could see was bright green light being injected into the ground.

Swish swish swish!

At this moment, two gruesome vines shot out from the ground and wrapped themselves around the two experts from Gautama denomination.

The vines emitted blinding green light and pulled them towards the Wood Fire Burial!

“Argh! NO... Our denomination will take revenge for us!”

Two spine-chilling screams reverberated across the sky. Soon, there was no longer any signs of life.

“This... This...”

The crowd of martial artists from the Underworld was completely dumbfounded.

The shock they got today was in no way any lower than that of half a month ago!

Half a month ago, the experts from the Dragon Sect had dominated the crowd of elite forces from Asia. The Dragon King easily killed five Budding Realm experts with five flying swords.

And today, the group of five middle-aged and old men destroyed several hundreds of powerful opponents with two moves. One of the old men was even able to trap two Budding Realm experts with a single move. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Since when was the Underworld so horrifying?

They felt as though they were no longer living in the Underworld. Instead, they were living in a world that only existed in legends.

“We have two matters to handle now!”

Elder Hua shifted his vision from the Wood Fire Burial. His expression was unmoved as he turned to face the group behind him.

“First, we have to get our hands on the information of the real world. Second, we have to take revenge for our clansmates in the real world!”

“Yes, Elder!”

The group behind him nodded their heads.

“Elder Hua, we should be able to get some information from those around here!”

At this moment, the middle-aged man with short hair lowered his stance before Elder Hua before looking across to the martial artists from the Underworld.

Mmm!

Elder Hua closed his eyes.

Seeing that the Elder had signalled to him, the middle-aged man with short hair turned around instantly to face the crowd of martial artists from the Underworld.

Huff!

When the martial artists from the Underworld saw the ex-Attendant of the Medical Saint Sect, they took a deep breath.

“We are from the Medical Saint Immortal Sect of the Yao Cauldron world. Disciples of our Medical Saint Immortal Sect stood at the pinnacle of all Immortal Sects at one point in time. Soon, our Yao Cauldron world will descend into this world. All martial artists have to surrender!”

The middle-aged man with short hair lifted his hair slightly, looked down at the group of people, and spoke with a low and serious tone.

“Surr... Surrender... We Surrender!”

The moment the middle-aged man with short hair finished his sentence, the group of martial artists from the Underworld answered instantly.

“On your knees!” an old man shouted suddenly.

“Yes, yes! We will kneel right away!”

Upon hearing the shouts from the old man, the group of martial artists from the Underworld felt extremely bitter. However, they took a deep breath to contain their indignance and went on their knees.

Mmm!

Elder Hua looked satisfactorily at the kneeling martial artists from the Underworld. A strong sense of superiority was written all over his cold face.

“Sect Leader Wan, get your guys to collect all the information on the real world for us!”

The middle-aged man with short hair looked at the group who was kneeling before him and spoke slowly with the same sense of superiority.

“Yes, Hua Atten... Yes, Your Excellency. We will definitely complete what you have instructed. Leave the information gathering to us!” Sect Leader Wan answered respectfully in a hurry.

“There’s another matter!”

The middle-aged man with short hair lowered his head, stared at the Sect Leader of Qingfeng Sect and said with a hideous expression, “Find the location of the Dragon King. The Dragon King has annihilated our Medical Saint Sect. We will rip him into a million pieces!”

“Yes, yes!”

Sect Leader Wan nodded his head instantly. He was a little overwhelmed by the expression shown by the middle-aged man with short hair.

“Since he dared to kill our clansmate, we will kill every single person who is related to the Dragon King of the Dragon Sect!” Elder Hua, who was standing at one side, added coldly.

Sss!

Upon hearing him, the surrounding martial artists from the Underworld gasped.

Killing every single person related to the offender was the most brutal and gruesome punishment in ancient times.

What it meant would be Wang Xian’s kin would all be killed.

Could this be what they referred to when saying that the authority of an Immortal Sect couldn’t be tainted?

However, the group of martial artists soon recalled the strength displayed by the Dragon King. Their eyebrows knitted together.

“Your Excellency, we know where the Dragon King of the Dragon Sect is!”

A cold light flashed across the eyes of Sect Leader Wan of Qingfeng Sect as he shouted loudly with deference.

“Huh? You guys know about his whereabouts?”

The middle-aged man with short hair was taken aback and followed up with a question.

“Yes, various Excellencies! We know the whereabouts of this despot!”

Sect Leader Wan answered loudly once again.

“Despot?”

The experts from the Yao Cauldron looked on, feeling a little baffled.

The group of martial artists from the Underworld was also surprised by what Sect Leader Wan had said. They lowered their heads and a glow flashed across their eyes.

Half a month ago, the Dragon King had chased them out of Mt. Taibai. Hatred for the Dragon King had long been taking root in their hearts.

Now that someone wanted to kill the Dragon King, this was something they were happy to see.

“That’s right! He’s a despot! After the Dragon King of the Dragon Sect annihilated the Medical Saint Sect, they annihilated several other Sacred Sects and Clans thereafter!

“What’s crueler was that half a month ago, he annihilated half the clans and sects in the entire Underworld. There wasn’t a day of peace for the Underworld!

“He’s a devil that has committed all sorts of sins and is extremely brutal!”

Sect Leader Wan spoke as his eyes turned red.

“Damn it!”

Dense killing intent emanated from the eyes of the middle-aged man with short hair.

“However, this despot is exceptionally powerful with terrifying subordinates. The strength he has displayed was like those of an immortal that’s incomparably powerful.”

Sect Leader Wan continued his elaboration.

“Immortal?”

Contempt flashed across the face of Elder Hua as he snided, “How strong could he be!?”

“Half a month ago, the Dragon King led nine Budding Realm experts and easily killed fifteen other Budding Realm experts. Moreover, the Dragon King displayed immense strength. He was able to kill five Budding Realm experts with five flying swords. He’s unparalleled in this world!”

Sect Leader Wan exaggerated a little in his illustration.

“That’s right. Just as Sect Leader Wan has said, the Dragon King is a powerful despot. We hope Your Excellency will remove this scourge for the better of all.”

The clan leader of the Song Family seconded the idea.

“Nine Budding Realm experts? Easily killed Budding Realm experts? Unparalleled in this world?”

Elder Hua was a little surprised. However, the edge of his lips curved up soon after.

“Nine Budding Realm experts? That Dragon King would at most be at the Half-step to Immortal Realm. We do need to be a little more serious when going against this force!”

“It seems like I have to be involved in the killing!”
