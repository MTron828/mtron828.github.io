Translator: 549690339

“Wow, is this Tianyuan City? Isn’t it too vast?”

“This is my first time coming to Tianyuan city. It’s like a hundred thousand mountains. It’s Too Spectacular!”

Tianyuan city was the city with the longest history in the sword and Magic Universe.

During the last calamity, this place was called the Tianyuan Point General Stage!

The so-called point general stage was where the disciples of the sword and Magic Universe gathered during the last calamity.

After the end of the calamity, this place became Tianyuan City.

It could be said that this Tianyuan city was protected by the lives of the disciples of the sword and Magic Universe during the last calamity!

Therefore, Tianyuan City did not belong to any power. It was the largest trading ground in the entire sword and magic universe.

It was also a place where all the Forbidden Holy Grounds conducted public affairs.

For example, negotiations!

In Tianyuan City, there was a rule that forbade any strong disciples from fighting here.

No matter which forbidden ground you were in, anyone who fought here would die!

This was an order given by the strong cultivators in the sword and Magic Universe. No one could disobey it!

Not even the strong disciples from the unfettered forbidden land and flowing water forbidden land!

After Wang Xian and the rest had made some preparations, they came straight to Tianyuan City!

It was the first time for long yin and long Yin Hao to be here.

It was also the first time for the 20 disciples from the Dragon’s roar forbidden land to be here.

They looked at their surroundings with a look of amazement. Their eyes were sparkling.

Wang Xian was also scanning his surroundings.

This Tianyuan city was more like a hundred thousand mountains.

The mountain peaks were transformed into flat roofs.

On top of each mountain peak, there were various stalls and restaurants!

The scene here was indeed very spectacular.

Wang Xian looked at his surroundings. His eyes were sparkling.

“Let’s go. Let’s go to the center seat.”

Leading the group was the great elder and the rest. There were more than ten elders who came this time.

This time, it was a great opportunity for a forbidden land of their level!

If they were lucky, they could nurture many elite powerhouses for the Dragon Roar Forbidden Land.

Of course, the main reason was also because of Wang Xian, ordinary Forbidden Lands and saint academies only had two spots.

As Wang Xian was currently ranked eighth on the Heaven’s pride roll, they had twenty spots!

They continued flying forward. The entire Tianyuan city was extremely huge.

After flying for half an hour, they arrived at the center of Tianyuan City.

There was an incomparably huge mountain peak. The mountain peak was cut off by the lazy waist, forming a huge arena!

In the surrounding area, there were many mountain peaks guarding it. These mountain peaks were also humongous.

However, compared to the arena at the center of the mountain peak, they were much smaller.

“Wow, what a humongous mountain peak. There’s simply no end to it! ”

Long Yinhao looked at the mountain peak that was cut off at the waist and said with a face full of shock.

“Hehe, according to the rumors, this mountain peak was directly cut off by one of our sword and Magic Universe’s Lord Tianyuan creation. Do you see the front? That’s the top half of the mountain peak!”

The first elder smiled and pointed to the front.

There was a mountain peak in front, and that mountain peak was also extremely huge.

If one looked carefully, they would find that it completely overlapped with the mountain peak that had been cut off by the lazy waist!

On that mountain peak, there were many huge words.

The words flickered with golden light, and the three words that were eye-catching were the prodigy roll!

Below these three words, there were names.

The first name was the undeserved holy son from the undeserved forbidden ground!

The second name was the flowing water holy maiden from the Flowing Water Forbidden Ground!

The third name was the undeserved holy son from the Void Dragon Holy Ground!

Each name was exceptionally eye-catching and could be seen from afar.

Among them, Wang Xian’s name was ranked eighth! “Brother Wang Xian, Look, your name is also on it! ”

Long Yin pointed at the eighth name and said loudly.

Wang Xian smiled. There were a total of twenty names, and his name was also on it.

The group of elders from the dragon roar forbidden ground looked over and revealed excited expressions.

This ranking also made them famous in the Dragon Roar Forbidden Ground!

“Come on, let’s go to the edge of the Tianyuan Peak in the center. In the next thousand years, we will completely determine the ranking of the Heaven’s pride roll. At that time, the experts from the undeserved forbidden ground will send a group of Saint Sons, saintesses, and Heaven’s pride roll to the ruins of the universe for cultivation!”

The first elder continued speaking and continued flying forward.

Only when they arrived in front of the Tianyuan Peak Arena did they feel extremely small!

Compared to this enormous mountain arena, they were even smaller than ants.

This was like throwing an ant into the ocean!

At the edge of the arena, there were numbers.

These numbers corresponded to the rankings of the forbidden sacred grounds and sacred academies.

The sacred grounds and sacred academies that were ranked were all gathered here.

When the Dragon Roar Forbidden Ground and the others arrived, there were already many forbidden sacred grounds and sacred academies around them.

However, when their gazes swept over them, not many of the top forbidden sacred grounds and sacred academies had arrived! Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“We will have to wait here for a thousand years first. This thousand years will be the most intense one thousand years of competition. ”

The first elder spoke to Wang Xian and the rest. His gaze finally landed on Wang Xian. “Xiao Xian, you don’t have to be nervous. You are currently ranked eighth. It Won’t be easy to pull you out of the top ten.”

“Yes, it’s Alright, First Elder. My strength has improved a little over the past ten million years! ”

Wang Xian smiled and said nonchalantly.

He now possessed the strength of a level three universe overlord. His combat strength was sufficient to fight against a saint son or Saintess who was a level four universe overlord.

Furthermore, due to his own attributes, Wang Xian’s current strength should not be weaker than ao Jian’s.

The current AO Jian was a level four universe overlord with metal attributes.

“That’s good. This time, our dragon roar forbidden ground is proud because of you, Little Xian! ”

The Great Elder said with a smile.

Wang Xian also smiled as he sat at the side and scanned his surroundings. The people who came now were basically the sacred grounds and academies that were ranked below the 50th.

In the front, there were disciples sparring.

Wang Xian didn’t have much interest. He sat there and chatted with long yinyin and long yinhao.

Time passed little by little. More and more strong disciples from the sacred grounds and academies came.

Two hundred years later, almost all the strong disciples from the sacred grounds and academies had arrived!

“Look at Big Brother, those are the undeserved and flowing water forbidden grounds. They are the two strongest existences on our continent. They have the lord of the Heaven’s origin destiny! ”

When all the forbidden lands arrived, Long Yinhao looked towards one direction and spoke to Wang Xian!
