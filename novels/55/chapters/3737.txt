“Peng!”

The ice metal landed heavily on the Fire Phoenix’s body.

The Fire Phoenix was burning with a terrifying flame of life. It did not care too much about the attack of this metal. Of course, even if it wanted to dodge, it could not!

However, when the metal landed on his body, a pure ice force and a terrifying collision force directly penetrated his body!

The metal was thousands of meters in size, and a thousand-meter-sized hole appeared on his body!

The terrifying ice force caused the fire Phoenix’s body to tremble violently.

He felt that his body and blood were completely frozen!

His eyes were filled with fear and despair.

“No!”

He shouted crazily as his body trembled violently.

“Die!”

Wang Xian saw that he was severely injured. His body moved and rushed over together with his four netherspirit avatars.

Boom! Boom! Boom

The terrifying attack landed on the Fire Phoenix. His life force quickly disappeared.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

At this moment, two space beasts emerged from two life planets not far away.

Their huge bodies looked over and felt a hint of threat!

“Woo Woo!”

The two space beasts did not hesitate and fled into the distance!

“Whoosh! Whoosh!”

Wang Xian moved his body and quickly kept the corpses of the three fire phoenixes. Then, he flew towards the two space beasts.

The two space beasts were slightly weaker than Wang Xian. They should not have reached the level of the ruler of the universe yet.

“Five elements Millstone, suppress!”

Wang Xian waved his arm and the five elements Millstone flew over. The Godly Dragon Shadows flew out and twined around the two space beasts!

“Roar!”

The two space beasts were entangled by the Godly Dragon Shadows and wanted to break free.

However, under the suppression of the five elements millstone, they could not move at all.

“Perfect!”

Wang Xian looked over and smiled.

Among the three corpses of the Fire Phoenix, there was also the corpse of a level two universe dominator, the Fire Phoenix.

Just this one corpse was enough to increase the number of disciples at the peak of the Universe Knight Realm in the Dragon Palace by 100.

The other two level one universe Dominators were also enough to increase the number of disciples in the Dragon Palace by 20!

This was a huge harvest.

“Should I kill these two space beasts, or… ?”

Wang Xian looked at the two space beasts that he had suppressed and fell into deep thought!

These two space beasts were not very strong.

“Just now, the three Phoenixes said that they wanted to suppress them as Space Beasts’mounts?”

He thought of the words of the three fire phoenixes and fell into deep thought.

After a moment of hesitation, he examined the corpses of the three fire phoenixes.

As he could not sense the divine kingdom, their items could not be placed in the divine kingdom. They could only be placed in spatial treasures.

When he opened the spatial treasures of the three fire phoenixes, a look of pleasant surprise immediately appeared on his face.

“This… there are so many treasures in here. They have plundered at least a few hundred life planets!”

Wang Xian checked their storage space and his face was filled with surprise.

Other than these, there were also a few communication stone disks! VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Unlike the AI, communication stone disks could be kept a hundred percent secret.

However, it was still difficult to crack the communication stone disks of the strong!

With a wave of his arm, the demonic ship in the void flew over with some corpses!

Wang Xian searched the corpses and found some treasures as well as some communication stone plates.

He took over a communication stone plate and cracked it. Immediately, he raised his eyebrows.

This communication stone plate was forged by imitating some models of the universe’s AI, but it was more concise!

On the communication stone plate, there were the contact details of the twelve peak races. Usually, the disciples of the nine-origin universe would find treasures, but if it was too dangerous, they could look for the peak races.

The peak races would also give them sufficient rewards!

This was one of the reasons. Secondly, the entire communication stone plate’s chat space contained a large amount of news and information. There were even some strategies!

Among them, there was also a map. There were many places where the map was missing. It was obvious that the experts and disciples of the nine-origin world had drawn it themselves. The reliability of the map was not very high!

Wang Xian checked it and found that there was a lot of information. There were even messages from the strong ones saying that he had obtained a huge opportunity.

“It seems that there are already a lot of strong disciples from the nine-origin universe who have entered this place!”

Wang Xian mumbled. Looking at the communication stone plate, his eyes suddenly flashed with a glimmer!

Killing three fire phoenixes at random not only brought him three overlord-level corpses, but also a large number of resources and treasures!

If he could kill dozens of them, he would be able to gather all the resources needed for his breakthrough!

“Why don’t I give it a try? I have a grudge with the angel race and the Phoenix race anyway. It’s not bad to be able to kill some of them!”

Wang Xian mumbled as his eyes sparkled!

With his current strength, as long as he wasn’t an existence above the overlord-level two realm, he could kill them all.

He was confident that he could kill even two or three level two universe masters.

After killing a few, he would continue to search for treasures.

At the thought of this, a smile appeared on his face. He scanned his surroundings and started to collect some resources from the life planets.

After collecting the resources, he stood there and took out a communication stone plate. His eyes were shining.

He hesitated for a moment and found the contact information of the Angel clan. Then, he sent a message directly.

“My Lords of the Angel clan, I have discovered more than a dozen life planets. However, there is danger here. It seems like there are two space beasts!”

After he sent the message, he waited quietly!

“Open the location on your side. Also, can you sense the strength of the Space Beasts?”

Very soon, a message was sent. Wang Xian took a look and no longer isolated the location of the communication stone plate.

“The two space beasts should have the combat strength of a level three universe dominator.”

At the same time, in the communication of the angel race, Wang Xian’s GPS and message were sent to all the powerful disciples of the Angel race.

“Who is near this location? The disciples of the high-level races have reported that there are more than ten life planets here. However, there are two space beasts. The Space Beasts need us to deal with them as a level one universe dominator.”

The message was sent out.

“I’m closer!”

Soon, an angel replied, “I’ll lead my Angel Army. We can easily take care of them!”

“Okay, be careful. If there’s a problem, notify us!”

The Angel Race’s expert who was in charge of receiving the message immediately reminded.

This was a way for the angel race to send messages. Every ruler-level and above angel would head to their respective domains to search for treasures.

Once a disciple from a high-level race asked for their help, the nearest angel would go and accept the mission.

“Wait for me there. I’ll be there in two days!”

Soon, Wang Xian received a message from an angel.
