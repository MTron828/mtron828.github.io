Wang Xian looked at the young man who was standing outside, unable to move an inch. An inexplicable expression appeared on his face.

The young man had both the metal and water attributes. He had reached extraordinary level nine at such a young age. At his current age, although he was not as stunning as Leng haocang, he was definitely a heaven’s favored son who was even more monstrous than the heavenly sword star.

He could not even be compared to the two heavenly sword stars.

Unfortunately, his current sword techniques and control over the two attributes of metal and water were not very strong.

The current him could fight above his level, but it was absolutely impossible for him to defeat an expert who was one level higher than him.

The young man’s gaze was determined. The clothes on his body looked very ordinary. Only the Greatsword in his hand looked decent. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

However, he could only say that it was decent. The huge sword was now in tatters and cracks were appearing on it!

“This young man is more suitable to obtain the inheritance of the sword mansion than I am!”

A faint smile appeared on Wang Xian’s face. “It just so happens that I have promised sword King Leng Haocang to find you a true inheritance. Then, I shall pass this sword King’s inheritance to you!”

As he spoke, he waved his arm and the sword gate slowly opened.

The young man who was dealing with the densely packed golden water swords did not notice the opening of the sword gate.

At this moment, his entire body was drenched in sweat. His short hair was completely drenched. He gritted his teeth and his face was filled with unwillingness.

“Bang!”

The huge sword in his hand was stabbed heavily into the ground. He was panting heavily and his eyes revealed an embarrassed expression.

“It’s over. I shouldn’t have fought so hard. With my current state, I can’t break through at all!”

He looked at the golden water swords around him, and his expression changed. A trace of despair appeared in his eyes.

The hatred in his heart caused him to lose his rationality. Only now did he realize the seriousness of the problem.

Originally, if he had retreated in time, he would definitely have been able to escape unscathed. However, at this moment, his body was completely exhausted. Facing the countless golden water swords around him, he was completely unable to resist.

“Why am I so stupid! ?”

Endless Regret and regret appeared on the young man’s face. He looked at the Golden Water Swords that were attacking him, and his body trembled.

A defense was formed around him, but the endless attacks landed on his body, causing his defense to quickly collapse.

When the young man saw this situation, a bitter expression appeared on his face.

His defense crumbled, and the Greatsword in front of him slowly split apart. Despair had already enveloped him.

Weng

At this moment, a greatsword flew toward him. Half of the Greatsword was golden, and the other half was blue. The two attributes intersected, and they contained a unique energy.

At this moment, the Greatsword was like an umbrella, forming a space of around three meters.

Golden-blue light circulated on it, and the two types of energy fused together, making it look extremely heavy.

“Weng!”

The greatsword directly landed in front of the young man, and the space that it created directly enveloped the young man within.

The young man, who had completely lost all hope, was slightly stunned, and his face was filled with shock as he looked at the greatsword in front of him.

The greatsword was about two meters long, and it was even larger than the broken greatsword in his hand.

The surface of the sword shimmered with light and color. The sharpness of the first level of the Seethrough weapon was striking the surroundings.

This was not what shocked him. What shocked him was the energy that surrounded him.

The defense that was formed by the fusion of metal and water. The countless metal and water swords in the surroundings landed on the sword without a single ripple.

This was the sword technique that Wang Xian had mastered from the sword principle of metal and water. It was a combination of defensive sword techniques.

He looked at the completely fused golden water energy and widened his eyes slightly. He quickly looked ahead.

In his vision, the tightly shut sword gate had already opened. A blurry figure was standing there.

Buzz

At this moment, the figure waved his arm. A stream of light flew towards him and landed in front of him.

It was a book with the words “Golden water sword principle”written on it.

He opened his mouth slightly, and his face was filled with shock.

“This is the inheritance of the sword mansion, the golden water sword principle. It was written by the sword king of the blood stream sect, Leng haocang, a few thousand years ago. The attributes that you cultivate match the golden water sword principle. Today, I will pass it on to you, the Fated One!”

“The great sword beside you is the golden water heaven-raising great sword that the sword King Leng Haocang used when he was at the first level of the insightful void realm. It is the first level of the insightful void realm. I will give it to you, the Fated One!”

“I hope that you can bring the Golden Water Great Dao to greater heights. There is nothing else in the sword mansion. You can train your swordsmanship in the sword tomb or you can leave!”

At this moment, a voice entered his ears, causing him to widen his eyes and look at the blurry figure.

“Peng!”

The moment he finished speaking, the sword gate closed.

“Senior... Senior, senior...”

When the young man saw that the sword gate was closed, he stood up immediately and shouted loudly.

“Senior, may I ask who are you? This is how I repay you!”

“Senior!”

He shouted loudly, but Wang Xian, who was behind the Sword Gate, didn’t show any signs of change.

He did this out of respect for the sword King Leng haocang. It wasn’t to the extent that his golden water sword principle would be lost.

“Senior, thank you, thank you, Senior!”

“Peng!”

The young man looked at the sword principle inheritance in his hand and the great sword protecting him, and a grateful expression appeared on his face. He directly knelt on the ground and kowtowed three times.

“Hu!”

The young man’s hands trembled, and he reached out to touch the great sword of the profound void tier in front of him. Compared to this great sword, his great sword, which was only at transcendent level 8, was simply trash.

His entire body trembled as he opened the Golden Water Sword Dao inheritance. When he saw the contents, he was so happy that he wept.

Once again, he couldn’t help but kneel down!

That senior not only saved his life, but also gave him a priceless sword dao inheritance.

The grace of rebirth was like that of a parent.

Unfortunately, he still didn’t know that senior’s name, or even his face.

...

“Alright, you have found the person who passed on the inheritance. I feel at ease!”

Wang Xian looked at the corpse at the side and then glanced at the young man who was kneeling over here. After hesitating for a moment, he dug a grave beside him and buried him.

The name of the sword King Leng Haocang was carved on it.

After doing all this, Wang Xian felt comfortable. When he saw the young man who was still kneeling over here, he smiled. This kid knew how to be grateful.

Then, he walked into the sword training room again.

“Star Explosion!”

After an unknown period of time, Wang Xian waved the long sword in his hand. A small mountain peak that was emitting flames appeared in front of him.

This small mountain peak that was emitting flames was based on the fire territory.

When the fire territory was formed, Wang Xian did not stop his actions.

He waved the long sword in his hand again. A strong golden sword aura rushed into the fire territory.

Boom

A terrifying explosion was heard. Wang Xian’s expression changed and he retreated into the distance.

Boom! Boom! Boom

An attack that was like the destruction of a planet was heard. The entire sword training room could not withstand the terrifying force and trembled violently.

Boom

The sword training room, which was protected by a powerful formation, collapsed immediately!

“Haha, it’s a success! It’s a success! The combination of the three attributes of the star explosion has finally succeeded!”

Wang Xian revealed an excited expression and couldn’t help but laugh out loud.

Once the starburst was released, he, who was in his human form, could break through the first level of the void interpretation stage.
