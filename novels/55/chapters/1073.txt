Chapter 1074: 1075 obeyed the order

Translator: 5496903

“To be able to get all the instructors of the three academies to agree to him being the commander this time, this leader of the Immortal Phoenix mercenary group is not simple!”

Looking at their disappearing figures, the smile on Jin Qianyuan’s face slowly disappeared, and a worried look appeared in his eyes. “I hope that holy sea town can survive this crisis, or else...”

“Hurry up, there’s another mission. Gather in front of the mayor’s Mansion!”

“There’s no time to rest. It seems that holy sea town is in a bit of a crisis!”

“It’s the first time we’ve encountered a Demon Beast siege. It’s so troublesome!”

The members of East Ocean Academy and Ocean Academy didn’t rest for long before walking out and discussing in low voices.

A large number of them had never really survived in the wild, and the number of ferocious beasts they had killed could also be counted. Now that they had so many tasks to complete, they felt a little tired.

When they arrived at the gate of the Mayor’s mansion, the students of Demon Hunters Academy had already arrived, and the experts of holy sea town had already stood up.

In terms of overall experience, Demon Hunters Academy was a little stronger than East Ocean Academy and Ocean Academy.

There were five hundred people in Shenghai Town and less than two thousand people in the three major colleges.

“Everyone, don’t speak!”

Wang Xian saw that everyone had arrived. He let out a soft shout and instantly released a wave of pressure from his body. Then, he charged forward.

“Huh?”

Everyone was slightly shocked. As they felt the strong aura, their expressions changed slightly.

“What a strong aura!”

The teachers from the three academies and the experts from Shenghai town were also slightly stunned. They looked at Wang Xian, who was standing at the front, with a face full of astonishment.

“It’s him? Why is he standing at the front?”

“How familiar. Oh right, it’s immortal Phoenix, the leader of the Immortal Phoenix Mercenary Group!”

Everyone was familiar with Wang Xian’s face. Let’s not talk about the three academies, the people from Shenghai town were also familiar with him.

Everyone knew about the monster siege last time, the famous immortal Phoenix and the young team leader.

“I will be in charge of the next mission. All you need to do is to obey the orders!”

Wang Xian glanced at all of them and said in a deep voice.

“What?”

The students from the three academies were slightly stunned. Even the experts from Shenghai town were stunned.

Wang Xian looked very young. Although he could sense that he was very strong, he wasn’t qualified to be a Commander!

Even the students from the three major academies who witnessed Wang Xian’s insight and commanding ability were stunned.

Everyone looked at the four extraordinary level-eight experts beside Wang Xian.

“Everyone has seen Wang Xian’s insight and commanding ability. It’s our decision to be the commander of this mission!”

The long-bearded elder from the East Ocean Academy said directly.

“Just do whatever I ask you to do next. I can guarantee your safety. If you don’t obey my orders and you are in danger, I will not help you!”

Wang Xian said to everyone, “Now, all the level seven and level six powerhouses, step forward.”

“In addition, those below level six of the extraordinaire who are good at defense, long-range attacks, close combat, and speed, stand in a row!”

Wang Xian made plans one by one.

The people of the transcendence continent were aware of the arrangement of troops. However, due to their training, it was very difficult to form a complete formation of a thousand or ten thousand people.

This time, they were hunting ferocious beasts and demonic beasts. It was much more convenient to form small squads to engage in small-scale battles in the wild.

Below, everyone immediately walked out according to their own abilities.

Hai Wen looked at Wang Xian’s high-spirited order to all of them and curled his lips slightly. There was some jealousy and disdain in his eyes.

“An extraordinaire at level six will be the team leader. form a team leader. The rest of the members can enter any team with supplements!”

As Wang Xian spoke, the teams were formed immediately.

Each extraordinaire at level six would be the team leader.

Hai Wen looked at Zhang Yushu who was beside him and revealed a cold smile.

“The mission this time is to head to the seamount region 70 kilometers away. The enemies are the eight-eyed eel and eight-clawed ferocious beasts of level 8 supernatural realm. We will be fighting in the sea. Everyone, get ready!”

“Guild leader, please explain to them some things to take note of in the seamount region!”

Wang Xian spoke to everyone as he took the lead and headed towards the seamount area.

The President of the Mercenary Association explained to everyone the terrain of the seamount area and the weaknesses of the eight-eyed eel and the eight-clawed ferocious beast.

Under the attention of the people of Shenghai town, everyone flew straight into the sky.

The seamount area was a hunting area 70 kilometers away from Shenghai town.

Here, the seamount mountains were hundreds of meters high from the sea. Looking from the sky, there were at least thousands of mountains.

The seamount region had eight-clawed ferocious beasts and a small number of eight-eyed eel demon beasts.

The level of the eight-clawed ferocious beasts was not very high. They were generally at level two or three, with the highest being at level six or seven.

The eight-eyed eel had always been a worry to holy sea town. The last monster siege was organized by the eight-eyed eel.

This time, Shenghai town was in danger. For some reason, there were some unusual movements in the seamount area.

In order to prevent the eight-eyed eel from appearing again in the future danger, they could only eliminate it in advance.

“The seamount area is ahead. Regardless of whether it’s the eight-eyed eel or the eight-clawed ferocious beast, they all like to lie on the mountain peak. Now, each team will head to a mountain peak!”

They came to the sky above the seamount region, wang Xian said to everyone behind him, “Every supernatural seventh level powerhouse is located in the middle of the ten teams. If the teams are in danger, rescue them quickly. If they encounter the eight-eyed eel, regardless of their level, report immediately!”

“Yes!”

Everyone replied immediately.

“You guys go down First!”

Wang Xian was floating in the sky. His Dragon Eyes of light and dark fire started to observe the situation around him. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Student Wang, are we going to move forward bit by bit from here?”

Director Qian frowned slightly and asked Wang Xian.

The other three extraordinary level eight powerhouses also looked at Wang Xian.

“There’s only one way!”

Wang Xian looked at them and said.

The four of them were slightly silent.

“Indeed, there is only one way. However, if we encounter the eight-eyed eel and the rest of the demonic beasts, we will be in danger!”

The President of the hiring association said.

“Don’t worry. The four of you and my men are enough to deal with this demonic beast race!”

Wang Xian said with a smile.

“Huh? What? Student Wang, your men!”

The four of them were slightly shocked and looked at Wang Xian in astonishment.

Wang Xian smiled and didn’t answer them directly. “Don’t worry, a species of the eight-eyed eel demon beast is nothing to worry about. Moreover, we only have this method at the moment!”

The eyes of the four of them flickered as they looked at the eleven middle-aged men who were standing on the surface of the water with golden longswords in their hands. A look of astonishment appeared on their faces.

“With student Wang’s words, we can be at ease!”

A smile appeared on the face of the president of the hiring association.

“As long as everyone obeys the orders, no one will be in danger!”

Wang Xian said confidently.
