Wang Xian frowned when he heard the white-bearded old man’s words.

He was not surprised by the natural born celestial sect’s choice. He had nothing to do with them in the first place. Naturally, they would choose the side that was beneficial to him.

Wang Xian stared coldly at the green-robed old man and the rest. His eyes were filled with killing intent.

“Haha, What’s Wrong, Dragon King? Are you blaming us?”

The green-robed elder laughed out loud when he saw Wang Xian’s expression. He took a sip of tea with an indifferent expression and said, “I want to take away what you want. You Dare to kill the disciples of the Holy Medicine sect and the Holy Doctor sect. Today is just the beginning!”

As he spoke, he grinned and revealed a sinister expression.

The white-bearded elder drank his tea and pretended not to see it.

They couldn’t say anything about this situation.

The Queen of flowers frowned and shook her head apologetically at Wang Xian.

Wang Xian glanced at the green-robed old man coldly. He stood up and looked at Changshu.

“Changshu is able to activate the spiritual intelligence of plants. All plants within a few kilometers of Changshu will be affected by it.”

“The reason why the trees of the natural born celestial sect have become towering trees must have a lot to do with the evergreen tree!”

“Furthermore, the reason why the spiritual herbs can grow quickly and safely is also due to the radiation from the evergreen tree!”

Wang Xian came to the side of the evergreen tree and said as he looked at the half-withered divine tree.

“That’s right. The reason why the natural born celestial sect is able to accumulate such a terrifying amount of spiritual herbs is mostly due to the evergreen tree. However, it has gradually withered and will die in ten years at most!”

The white-bearded old man did not want to offend Wang Xian. He walked to his side and replied.

“I didn’t expect this Dragon King to know so much!”

The green-robed old man smiled gently and raised his eyebrows as he chuckled.

They stood up and looked at the divine tree as well.

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered. He extended his hand and placed it on the vichang tree slowly.

Buzz

A feeling of wanting to absorb it came over. The corners of Wang Xian’s mouth curled up slightly. With a thought, he slowly contacted the ancestral tree.

A wave of vital and holy energy flowed from Wang Xian’s chest along his arm and landed on the tree.

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz

At this moment, the tree suddenly started to move. It seemed to be very happy.

“This is?”

The white-bearded elder was slightly shocked. He stared at the tree with his eyes wide open.

The four green-robed elders were shocked. They had a bad premonition!

“Hualala!”

Hsuan Changshu’s branches trembled gently as though he was expressing something.

At this moment, the entire tree body suddenly emitted a faint green and green glow.

The two glows flickered as the withered area slowly regained its vitality.

In just a few minutes, the withered part of Hsuan Changshu’s body had recovered by one-third.

“Lord Wang Xian, you... you actually managed to bring Qichang Shu back to life!”

The Queen of Flowers was stunned as a hint of excitement flashed across her eyes.

The eyes of the white-bearded old man and the other three were also filled with a fiery glow.

Qichang Shu was the sect-opening divine tree of the innate celestial sect. It was self-evident how important it was to them.

Now that it had withered, they had no way to do anything about it. Such a divine tree could not be restored with the wood attribute.

However, this Dragon King was actually able to restore Changshu’s vitality. To them, this was simply a miracle.

“Dragon King, can you restore Changshu’s vitality?”

The white-bearded old man repeated the question after the flower in excitement.

“Yes!”

A hint of a smile appeared in Wang Xian’s eyes. His gaze swept across the four Immortals from the Holy Medicine Immortal Sect and the Holy Doctor Immortal sect. “However, I want all of your wood spirit fruits!”

The white-bearded old man’s eyes sparkled as he turned to look at the green-robed old man. “Elder Hua, I’m really sorry. Everyone knows the importance of serving Changshu!”

The green-robed old man and the three middle-aged old men beside him immediately turned solemn. Their faces were slightly embarrassed.

This was not just serving Changshu, but also the tree demon.

The reason why the tree demon was called a demon was because it did not have intelligence. It could attack enemies and friends without distinguishing between them.

They could only control them if Chang Shu opened up his intelligence. Otherwise, he could only be a tree demon guarding a place and could not be controlled!

The importance of tree demons was not lower than their cooperation with the Natural Born Immortal sect!

However, they also knew that the natural born immortal sect would not give up on Chang Shu. Right now, they would not agree even if they had to exchange four or five tree demons with him.

The sect-opening divine tree was not only useful to spiritual herbs and plants, but also to the disciples cultivating in this area.

If the serving Changshu was restored, the Natural Born Immortal sect would definitely not dare to consume too much of its energy and would not use it to activate the tree demon’s spiritual wisdom!

When Wang Xian heard the white-bearded old man’s words, a smile appeared on his face.

He returned to his seat and took a sip of tea. His gaze swept across the four green-robed old men.

“Today, I also want to cooperate with the natural born celestial sect?”

Wang Xian looked at the white-bearded old man confidently and said with a smile.

“Oh? May I know what Dragon King wants to cooperate with?”

The white-bearded old man sat beside Wang Xian in a good mood and said with a smile. He became much closer to Wang Xian.

“Elixirs!”

The corners of Wang Xian’s mouth curled up slightly as he looked at the four people from the Holy Medicine Celestial sect and the Holy Doctor Celestial sect.

“Your Holy Medicine Immortal sect and the Holy Doctor Immortal sect are cooperating with the Natural Born Immortal sect. I would like to ask, what is the fixed pill success rate and how should we distribute it?”

“HMM? Hehe!”

When the green-robed old man saw that Wang Xian dared to interfere in the pill cooperation, his eyes revealed a cold and disdainful look.

“The success rate of a grade-5 pill is 50% , a grade-6 pill is 40% , and a grade-7 pill is 30% !”

“Also, the natural born celestial sect produces spiritual herbs. We produce alchemists, so we will split the success rate 50-50!”

“Our sect is the best in the entire martial arts world in terms of alchemy skills. Why, are you the only one who wants to interfere?”

The green-robed elder stared at Wang Xian coldly with a face full of confidence.

“I don’t think so when it comes to alchemy skills!”

Wang Xian shook his head slowly. “The success rate of a grade-5 elixir is 60% , the success rate of a grade-6 elixir is 50% , the success rate of a grade-7 elixir is 40% , and the success rate is 50-50% !”

As he spoke, he turned to look at the white-bearded old man. “These are the conditions for my cooperation!”

“Bam!”

“Kid, are you trying to stir up trouble on Purpose?”

After Wang Xian stated the conditions, the green-robed old man stared at Wang Xian coldly and growled in a low voice.

“What? These are the conditions for my cooperation with the natural born celestial sect. If you are not satisfied, you can give me better conditions!”

Wang Xian stared at the old man and said coldly.

“Our Holy Medicine Celestial sect is the best in the world in terms of alchemy skills. The conditions we offer are also the most reasonable. How can you cooperate with them? You are spouting nonsense!”

A middle-aged man beside the green-robed old man stared at him with a dark expression. Wisps of flames were dancing in his eyes.

“Haha, the best in the world. That’s just your arrogance. A bunch of arrogant fellows!”

Wang Xian stood up abruptly and showed a strong confidence on his face. “It’s just alchemy. Do you want to compete?”

As he spoke, he extended his right hand and a wisp of water-blue flame was emitted.

“Dual attributes! Water Alchemy!”

The green-robed old man and the other three were stunned and looked shocked.
