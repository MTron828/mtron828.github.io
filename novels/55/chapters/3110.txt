Chapter 3111: 3110 universe Knight Annihilation

Time passed day by day.

The disciples of the willow deity Daoist sect were chatting and joking on the ship.

Wang Xian, who was in the room, was also refining the crescent moon illumination.

On the third day, he smiled as he looked at the acquired Numinous Treasure that had entered his body. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Success.”

He moved his palm and the crescent moon illumination appeared. He walked out in a good mood.

“Dragon King, do you want to eat something? It’s delicious food cooked by senior sister lingxin.”

When Mi Xinlu saw Wang Xian holding a plate, he immediately walked over and said with a smile.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded and took some with a smile.

“Junior brother Wang Xian, are you going to stay there for a period of time after returning to the Willow deity Daoist sect?”

Senior Sister Lingxin walked over and asked with a smile on her face.

“No, I’ll leave after settling some matters.”

Wang Xian shook his head. His current strength was already at the venerable stage.

Furthermore, the Dragon Palace would be entering the Milky Way soon.

He was heading to the Willow deity Daoist sect this time to meet venerable willow.

Venerable Willow Deity had indirectly helped him out. He was prepared to express his gratitude and leave the willow deity Daoist sect completely.

With his strength and status, he could no longer stay in the willow deity Daoist sect.

Furthermore, there was no need for him to stay in the willow deity Daoist sect anymore.

“Junior brother Wang Xian, you are really a busy person.”

Senior Sister Lingxin said with a smile. Then, she swept her gaze around and shouted softly, “Come, come, come. Senior sister, I personally cooked delicious food. If you want to eat, come here quickly!”

“Alright, senior sister. Haha, Senior Sister’s culinary skills are first-class in the Milky Way!”

“It’s not just first-class in the Milky Way, it’s simply first-class in the Universe!”

Before they arrived, flattering voices were heard.

Soon, forty to fifty young, middle-aged, and even old men walked over with a smile.

Senior Brother Junzi also walked behind them with a smile.

“It’s all on the table. One serving for each of you. Don’t eat too much.”

Senior Sister Lingxin shouted happily when she heard their compliments.

“Good, good!”

The group of disciples of the Willow deity Daoist sect said with a chuckle.

“Buzz!”

“HM?”

At this moment, the surrounding space suddenly underwent a terrifying transformation.

A situation that looked like the end of the world appeared. The space around the ship suddenly darkened.

“Crackle, Crackle!”

Bolts of lightning suddenly appeared out of thin air. The entire space was covered by lightning.

A great terror descended.

“What is this?”

Everyone’s pupils constricted slightly, and a shocked expression appeared on their faces.

Senior Brother Junzi and the others’hearts tightened, and they instantly appeared on the deck of the ship.

This terrifying power made his heart palpitate.

“Hehe, it’s coming!”

At the back, senior brother Lu saw the surrounding space change, and a trace of a smile appeared on his face.

After completing the transaction with the dragon race, they would be able to obtain a lot of resources.

“What’s going on?”

Wang Xian sensed the changes in the surroundings and focused his gaze. His figure appeared in front of the deck.

“Who is that?”

At this moment, the disciples of the Willow deity Daoist sect flew over. When they raised their heads and saw a figure floating in the sky, their faces revealed a shocked expression.

“Crackle crackle!”

At this moment, a bolt of lightning flashed and reflected the face of the figure in the sky.

The entire face had the picture of a divine dragon, and it looked ferocious and terrifying.

A pair of cold eyes stared at the position below, filled with coldness.

“This senior, may I ask what is the matter?”

Senior Junzi, Senior Kong, senior Xu, and the others looked at the figure in the sky, and their expressions changed slightly as they asked with a solemn expression.

“Is that a universe knight?”

“It’s a universe Knight!”

The expressions of all the disciples of the Willow deity Daoist sect changed drastically. Their faces were filled with reverence.

“I am a member of the Dragon Race. Wang Xian of the willow deity Daoist sect, are you going to commit suicide, or am I going to kill you?”

“Crackle crackle!”

As the figure spoke, terrifying Thunderbolts shot out from his body.

The thunderbolts lit up the entire space.

“The venerable dragon-faced dragon of the dragon-descendant race?”

“Not good!”

When the disciples of the Willow deity Daoist sect heard the words of the figure in the sky, their hearts tightened. They immediately looked at Wang Xian.

Everyone knew that the dragon-descendant race wanted Wang Xian.

However, even though he was wanted, it was simply too difficult to capture a powerhouse in the Milky Way.

Now, he actually found this place.

This time, he was in trouble!

Wang Xian stared at the venerable of the Dragon Race in the sky and swept his gaze across this space.

“There’s no need to look. You Won’t be able to escape. Even with venerable willow deity’s fallen leaves, it’s useless.”

The Venerable of the Dragon Race looked at Wang Xian and said coldly.

“I’m a little curious. I can conceal my aura. Even a universe knight-level wizard wouldn’t be able to lock onto me.”

“This space is obviously pre-arranged. How did you know I Was Here?”

Wang Xian looked at the dragon-faced venerable in the sky and asked faintly.

At the same time, he had some doubts in his heart. Did someone inform the dragon-born race or did the dragon-born race really have a very powerful investigative ability.

“Hehe, a dead person doesn’t need to know so much.”

The venerable dragon-faced man said indifferently. He waved his arm and a lightning whip appeared in his hand.

The lightning whip attacked Wang Xian directly.

“Oh no!”

“Junior brother Wang Xian, Dodge!”

Seeing a venerable attacking Wang Xian, the expressions of the disciples of the Willow deity Daoist sect changed drastically.

“This guy is dead for sure. The venerable dragon-faced man attacked personally and even set up an inescapable net around him. He still wants to escape?”

Behind him, senior brother Lu and the rest were looking at him coldly. Their eyes were filled with mockery.

“You Dragons don’t have the ability to kill me!”

Wang Xian looked at the lightning that was attacking him. He narrowed his eyes slightly and his palm turned into a dragon claw. He grabbed at the Lightning whip directly.

Crackle! Crackle

The Lightning Whip was grabbed in his hand and produced a thunderous sound.

“Oh?”

The venerable dragon-faced was slightly stunned when he saw that his attack was blocked.

His casual attack was something that even a peak divine emperor could not block.

“To be able to instantly kill a peak divine emperor expert and wipe out the ice mountain race, it seems that you have some ability. However, you will still die today!”

“Because you have offended our dragon race!”

A serious look appeared in the eyes of the venerable dragon-faced man as he moved his palm slightly.

“Thunderbolt!”

Bolts of lightning followed the lightning whip and charged directly at Wang Xian.

The lightning was like a terrifying desolate beast as it devoured Wang Xian.

“Haha, If You Want Me to die, I want to see who will die today!”

Wang Xian laughed out loud as he flung the lightning whip in his hand.

“Crash!”

The inoriginator holy wings appeared behind him and his figure disappeared instantly.

In the next moment, he appeared at the side of the venerable dragon-masked figure and clawed at him with his dragon claws.

“What!”

“What a fast speed!”

The moment Wang Xian suddenly appeared at his side, the venerable dragon-masked figure felt a jolt in his heart and a hint of shock appeared on his face.
