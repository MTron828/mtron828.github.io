Chapter 532: Annihilating The Arrogant

“Move aside! Move aside!”

At the entrance to Huashan, the Inborn experts of the Sacred Clan, Dongmen Clan, shouted as they saw Wang Xian leading his disciples over.

The surrounding crowd was alarmed by the shouts of the Dongmen Clan, and they turned around to take a look.

“Dragon King of the Dragon Sect!”

“Move aside! Move aside!”

“Even the Sacred Clan, Dongmen, moved aside immediately. What are first-class forces like you guys still standing there for?”

As the shouts reverberated, a path towards the entrance of Huashan opened up as the crowd watched the Dragon Sect enter Huashan.

All the martial artists had their eyes on the people from the Dragon Sect. They were baffled.

Seeing what was happening around, Wang Xian revealed a faint smile.

This path was built from the bloodshed he had caused. His name and its authority were established through countless massacres.

Even Sacred Clan had to move aside when they encountered Dragon Sect.

Wang Xian walked ahead emotionlessly. Behind him, different clans and sects discussed softly as they could only look at their backs.

The battle on Huashan would be at the highest peak of Huashan, which was located in the middle region of Huashan.

In that place, the highest peak was over two thousand meters tall.

The battle would be held there.

There were a dozen-odd entrances to the highest peak of Huashan.

Wang Xian walked at the front of the pack. The martial artists in front of and behind him were at least a hundred meters away.

“Diabolism! Those are people from Diabolism!”

Just as Wang Xian led the disciples of Dragon Sect to a forked road, he heard shouting from his side.

“Hehe! Their blood is so fresh. I really hope the major battle will be over soon. After that, we can drink and suck their fresh blood to our hearts’ content!”

“It will be soon! After Emperor Qi defeats Nie Wushuang, the major battle will begin. We have been lying low for fifty years. Now is the time to show our fangs!”

Hehe!

A few arrogant voices resounded.

“Ah! Bugs! Bug! Mum, these blood-red bugs!

“Crimson Bug, what do you guys want?”

At this moment, a sharp shriek pierced the atmosphere.

“Don’t be so anxious, girl. The major battle hasn’t started. Diabolism follows the rules closely. Hehe! Don’t be such a coward!”

Wang Xian walked forward and saw martial artists from Diabolism, who were wearing red outfits, teasing the group at the other end.

Under their loose red outfits, one could still see something wiggling and moving.

A short distance away, a girl stood behind another lady. Her face was as white as snow.

Before the girl, there were a dozen-odd savage-looking bugs. These bugs had razor-sharp mouthparts. Some of them had countless legs while others were wiggling around.

All the bugs shared a common trait, and that was that they were entirely red with a stench of blood around them.

“Crimson Bug! An elite sect below the four strongest devil sects. They have a strength that can equal a Sacred Sect in the Underworld!”

“All the cultivators in Crimson Bug are exceptionally gruesome. They breed bugs with their bodies. The stronger these bugs are, the stronger they are. Since the Remains have been annihilated, they are widely regarded as having the capabilities to take their place!”

A few middle-aged men standing by the side commented. When their eyes fell on the bloody bugs on the floor, their faces paled.

The cultivation arts of those in Diabolism were all weird.

Seeing that the group ahead had stopped moving, Wang Xian raised an eyebrow and shouted, “If you guys aren’t moving, move aside!” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“There are bugs ahead!” Upon hearing the voice behind her, the girl that was frightened answered with a weak voice.

Huh?

When the rest of the crowd ahead heard Wang Xian, they were alarmed and turned their heads around curiously.

They looked baffled while staring at Wang Xian and the group.

Don’t recognize me?

Wang Xian raised an eyebrow and his attention fell on their outfit. A group of martial artists from second-class forces. They seemed to be from the same family or clan.

In the Underworld, all first-class and Saint-class forces would have recognized him. Only second-class forces and weaker forces might not recognize him.

Also, Roving Sword of the golden swordfish race and five other golden swordfish members stood in a row with Mo Qinglong and Wang Xian.

Their two-meter tall statures completely blocked their sight of the disciples of Dragon Sect, who were wearing masks and Devil Wings.

Therefore, these people didn’t recognize Wang Xian.

“Bugs?” Wang Xian chuckled and walked straight ahead.

When the members of those second-class forces saw Wang Xian walking towards them, they hesitated for a moment before moving aside rapidly.

“If there’re bugs, just kill them!”

Seeing a dozen-odd blood-red bugs the size of one’s middle finger on the path ahead, Wang Xian waved his arm casually.

A ball of flames shrouded forward.

Huh?

A sharp noise sounded and the dozen-odd bloody bugs jumped towards a middle-aged man with incredible speed.

Wang Xian smirked with contempt.

Screech! Screech! Screech!

In the next instant, the flames fell on the bloody bugs and horrifying cries could be heard.

After a brief moment, they were reduced to ashes.

“How dare you kill my bloody bugs! You must be tired of living!”

Seeing his bloody bugs being annihilated instantly, the middle-aged man growled savagely. He turned around and stared at Wang Xian.

At this moment, the bloody bugs within his body seemed to be able to sense his fury. Two bloody bugs the size of a fist wiggled out of his sleeves.

These two bugs only had one blood-red eye and were staring coldly at Wang Xian.

“So what?”

Wang Xian looked at the middle-aged man as his lips curved into a smile. Contempt was written all over his face.

“Alright, Baozhi. We have a promise with the orthodox sects that we will not start a conflict here. Just remember him. When the major battle begins, let your bloody bugs make a sumptuous meal of him!”

The old man by the side looked at Wang Xian plainly before reminding the middle-aged man.

“Hehe! Brat! I’ll remember your face. Don’t be anxious! I’ll be going after you in a few days. I’ll breed more bugs in your body to replace the thirteen you have killed! Hehe! I’m not in a rush and you shouldn’t be either!”

The middle-aged man stared coldly at Wang Xian. His clothes were tumbling and he looked horrifying.

Several disciples of the second-class families around paled at the sight of that.

“How unruly and arrogant!”

Wang Xian looked at the middle-aged man and showed a faint smile.

“Hehe! Now that you have become my prey, eat more over the next few days. When the major battle between the orthodox sects and devil sects begins, I will use your corpse to feed my babies!”

The middle-aged man smiled creepily, revealing his blood-red teeth. A pungent stench of blood was surrounding him.

Several members of those second-class forces took several steps back in fear.

“A bunch of cowards! Your easy and comfortable lives will be coming to an end soon. Enjoy the last few days of your lives!”

Seeing them retreating, a young man remarked with ridicule.

“You guys are really noisy. It would seem that I have annihilated too few people from Diabolism. There are actually people who can’t recognize me!”

Wang Xian looked across the crowd of more than a hundred members from the Crimson Bug. He continued with an emotionless tone, “Kill all of them!”
