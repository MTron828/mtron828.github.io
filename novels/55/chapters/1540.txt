Chapter 1541: 1541 suppressing all heaven’s favorites 4

“What’s going on? What happened? Why are they fighting?”

“I don’t know. who dares to cause trouble at the place where the Crown Prince of Wuqing City is holding a banquet? Isn’t this courting death?”

“It seems to be someone from the Divine Light Empire? Who is that young man holding a Scepter?”

In the residence of the Crown Prince of Wuji Empire, Tian Qingguang and the young man were directly thrown into the black lotus lake, splashing water all over their bodies. Their ferocious faces emitted angry voices that attracted the attention of everyone around them.

Those who were able to come here today were at least core disciples of second-rate forces. They were heaven’s pride disciples. When they saw that someone dared to cause trouble here, their faces were filled with astonishment as they discussed among themselves.

Wang Xian swept a disdainful glance at the two of them and walked coldly to the side.

“Stop right there! How dare you sneak attack our Prince!”

When the rest of the young ladies from the Divine Light Empire saw the two princes being thrown into the lake, their faces were extremely embarrassed.

They immediately surrounded Wang Xian in the middle and said coldly.

“B * Stard, you’ve completely infuriated me!”

The young man beside Tian Qingguang leaped and flew out of the lake. The lake water on his body evaporated immediately as he stared at Wang Xian with an extremely cold expression.

“Is... is this a fight? Aren’t you going to give face to the crown prince of Wuqing City?”

“I still don’t understand what’s going on. Who Is that young man? Why did he suddenly start fighting?”

When the crowd saw the people of Divine Light dynasty surrounding a young man, they revealed curious expressions.

“From their conversation just now, that young man seems to be that priest Wang or something. I think he once insulted the daughter of light, the child of light!”

“Priest Wang? That priest Wang who treated people for a month for free? That priest Wang who threw the son of light down the stairs and called the daughter of light a piece of trash?”

“No wonder the people of Divine Light dynasty are so angry and dare to make a move here. It turns out that that guy once insulted Princess Wu Qingyan!”

“The Crown Prince of Wuqing City and Princess Qingyan have a very good relationship. It seems that priest Wang even confessed to a princess of Bingxin dynasty just now!”

When the people nearby told them the reason, the young men and women around them were surprised.

They had heard of the name priest Wang. They also knew that he said that the daughter of light was trash.

However, what surprised them was that this priest Wang actually dared to attend today’s banquet. wasn’t he asking for humiliation?

“HMM, a confession?”

Bing jinghuan from the Bingxin Empire, who was standing at the side, heard the discussions of the people around him. He frowned slightly and looked at Ling Jian ‘er.

“Jian ‘er, is that guy bothering you again?”

He looked at Ling Jian ‘er and asked with a gloomy face.

“I told him to leave immediately!”

Ling Jian ‘ER said faintly.

Bing Jinghuan narrowed his eyes slightly and looked at Wang Xian with murderous intent.

Ling Jian ‘er was already someone he had already decided on internally. A radiant priest dared to snatch her away from him. He was simply courting death!

“Priest Wang, you have insulted my brother, the son of light, and the daughter of light, Princess Wu Qingyan. If you don’t give me an explanation today, I will make sure that you will not be able to walk out of this place!”

A radiant longsword appeared in the hands of the young man from the Divine Light Empire. A faint murderous intent appeared on his face as he glared at Wang Xian and shouted coldly.

“You can insult me, but you have insulted Princess Wu Qingyan. Don’t even think about walking out of here safely today!”

Tian Qingguang walked over with a staff in his hand.

Around them, more than a dozen young men from the Divine Light Empire exuded a faint aura and locked onto them completely.

When the people around them saw their formation, they looked like they were watching a show.

“You bunch of trash?”

Wang Xian glanced at the people from the divine light empire with disdain. The highest level was level two of the Seethrough void tier. In his eyes, they were all trash.

“You are really arrogant. A mere priest. I wonder where your courage and background come from. You insulted Princess Qingyan and dared to pester my junior sister Bing Jinghuan!”

At this moment, Bing Jinghuan, who was standing at the side, walked out slowly. He stared at Wang Xian with flickering eyes as he spoke in a sinister tone.

“Eh? The ninth Prince of the Bingxin Empire has also come out!”

“This fellow has not only provoked the people of the Divine Light Empire, but also the Bingxin Empire!”

“What background does this priest Wang have that he dares to provoke two core disciples with first-rate strength?”

“Pestering the ninth Prince’s junior sister? This guy is going to be done for!”

In the surroundings, the disciples of the various factions were astonished when they saw the ninth Prince of the Bingxin Empire suddenly walk out.

There were only eight first-rate factions in the vast continent. Now, he had directly provoked the most outstanding disciples of two factions. This was simply courting death.

Ling Jian ‘er frowned slightly when she saw Bing Jinghuan walking over. However, she didn’t say anything.

As she was currently cultivating the heartless sword principle, she was very weak in terms of love.

Wang Xian’s gaze swept across the ninth prince who stood out and stared at him. A hint of coldness flashed in his eyes.

He stood there indifferently and swept his gaze across everyone. He said indifferently, “What can you do to me?”

What can you do to me?

Facing the disciples of the Divine Light Empire and the Bingxin Empire indifferently, what can you do to me with just one sentence?

This... This was simply too arrogant!

The words ‘what can he do to me’made the faces of the people of the Divine Light Empire, Tian Qingguang, and Bing Jing Huan instantly turn black.

They didn’t expect that this guy would still dare to be so arrogant under such circumstances.

“Cripple him!” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Bing Jing Huan glanced at the youth in the middle of the Divine Light Empire and said coldly.

“Prince, leave it to us. You Don’t have to do anything!”

The group of young men and women around the Divine Light Empire said coldly.

“Bind him and let the prince and Bing Jing Huan Punish Him!”

A young man shouted coldly and a staff appeared in his hand.

Around them, more than ten young men and women nodded. Against a radiant priest, there was naturally no need for the prince to do anything.

The young prince from the Divine Light Empire stood there arrogantly and coldly, looking down on them.

Bing Jinghuan placed his hands behind his back and looked at them coldly.

“Light entanglement!”

A young man raised the scepter in his hand and waved it. There were more than ten young men. The lowest among them was at level one and one was at level two of the void interpretation stage.

Most importantly, there were no radiant priests among them. Their combat strength was very strong.

“A bunch of trash!”

Wang Xian looked at the rays of light that were winding towards him. He waved the staff of light in his hand.

The rays of light that were winding towards him collapsed immediately. Following that, under their astonished gazes, the rays of light gathered again.

The rays of light were winding towards their bodies. Instead, they were all restrained.

Wang Xian waved his arm and the dozen of young men and women who were restrained by the Rays of light flew towards the back instantly.

“Bang! Bang! Bang!”

“PFFT!”

The powerful collision caused the dozen of them to spit out blood instantly.

“What? Such strong strength!”

Everyone around was slightly shocked as they looked at Wang Xian in astonishment.
