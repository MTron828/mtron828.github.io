Chapter 629: Blood Flowing A Thousand Miles (2)

Donghua Sacred Sect was annihilated with no one left in the ancestral sect.

When the news got out, the entire Underworld was blown away.

Soon, some of them guessed that Donghua Sacred Sect had been annihilated by Dragon King and Dragon Sect.

That was because everyone lost touch with Rivertown after the Dragon King’s return.

They made a bold speculation that those who tried to annihilate Dragon Sect had all been killed by Dragon King.

Boom!

“Gosh, gosh. Devil Corpse Palace is being annihilated!”

Just as everyone was still overwhelmed by the fact that Donghua Sacred Sect had been annihilated, another shocking piece of news came by.

Devil Corpse Palace, the strongest ancestral sect of Diabolism, was annihilated.

Sss...

When the news was out, everyone drew in a cold breath.

Devil Corpse Palace was not any weaker than Donghua Sacred Sect. Yet, it was exterminated too.

On the same post were various photos with the corpses of the Devil Corpse Palace disciples.

None of them were alive. The entire Devil Corpse Palace was quiet as hell.

“It must be the Dragon King. It must be him. He’s the only one who could annihilate Donghua Sacred Sect and Devil Corpse Palace. The Dragon King is not dead. He’s annihilating all those who besieged the Dragon Sect!”

“I had a bad feeling ever since that live update stopped updating. The Dragon King is not dead, and it looks like Dragon Sect has begun taking their revenge!”

“Within an hour, the strongest Sacred Sect of the orthodox sects and Diabolism were annihilated. This is too fast and furious! Scary!”

The downfall of Devil Corpse Palace had made everyone believe that the Dragon King was not dead, and that Dragon Sect had not been exterminated.

On the contrary, those who besieged Dragon Sect were all gone by now!

This shocked everyone.

“With the downfall of Donghua Sacred Sect and Devil Corpse Palace, the revenge of the Dragon King has begun. I’m afraid those forces that participated in the siege are finished!”

“The forces who participated account for sixty percent of the families and Sacred Sects from the orthodox sects and Diabolism in the Underworld. Can the Dragon King take revenge on them one by one?”

In less than twenty minutes, their speculation was answered.

Devil Spirits Temple of Diabolism was annihilated!

Half an hour later, Dark Sect was annihilated!

An hour later, Heavenly Sound Sect was annihilated!

An hour and a half later, Dongmen Clan was annihilated!

In just two hours, news of the various Sacred Sects and Clans being annihilated kept coming.

This time, no one in the sects lived.

The entire Underworld was plunged into silence when they saw the messages uploaded onto the forum.

Soon after, some of the people became frightened as their families and ancestral sects had participated in the siege.

This struck an immense terror into them.

“Quick, disperse, everyone. All of you, find a place to hide. Those who can leave the country, leave now!”

Back in Han Family in Modu, all the family members revealed a frightful look when they read the news of the downfall of various Sacred Sects and clans.

It was to their ultimate surprise that the siege of Dragon Sect had actually failed.

They knew very well of the four elders’ strength. If such domineering existences failed, Han Family was nothing to them.

Fear crept into them. Without any hesitation, the Family Head of Han Family ordered them to run as far as they could!

“Do you think you can escape?”

At this time, Roving Sword and members of Dragon Sect appeared in the air within the huge villa of the Han Family. They were glowering at the Han Family, who was freaking out!

“What? How did they make it here so fast?”

When the members of the Han Family heard Mo Qinglong, they craned up and yelled in quivering voices. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“No, please. Don’t kill us. We surrender. Don’t kill us!”

When the Family Head of Han Family saw the disciples of Dragon Sect in the air, he was utterly devastated as he fell to his knees, begging for mercy.

“Kill!”

The cold voice took away all the hopes of the Han Family as all of them fell into despair.

“Let’s go!”

No one in the Han Family was alive three minutes later. Roving Sword led Mo Qinglong and the rest to their next destination.

Given Roving Sword’s speed, it would at most take him one hour to fly from the farthest point east to the farthest point west in the country.

Due to their daunting speed, the families and ancestral sects were annihilated before they could even react.

No one left alive!

When the group of forces besieged the Dragon Sect, trying to kill the Xue Family, they did not intend to leave anyone alive.

Hence, Mo Qinglong and the gang would not go soft on them.

None of them could stay alive in this massacre!

Han Family was annihilated!

Liu Family was annihilated!

....

News of the ancestral sects and families quickly filled up the entire Underworld forum.

The entire Underworld went into complete silence while all the ancestral sects and families gasped.

At this moment, the world seemed to have quieted down.

All the Martial Artists grew numb with the messages that they read. They were just staring blankly with all the forces having been wiped out.

Once the Dragon King rages, blood flows for a thousand miles!

Almost sixty percent of the families and ancestral sects in the Underworld had participated in the siege of Dragon Sect.

Yet, these forces were reduced at a daunting speed.

Finally, someone on the forum confirmed that the one behind this was Dragon Sect at 8 PM.

Although the news did not create much of a ruckus in the form, everyone was still stunned by it.

How strong is the Dragon King?

And how strong is the Dragon Sect?

The four elders were already domineering, just like immortals. Yet, they were still killed by the Dragon King.

Tonight was a sleepless night for the Underworld.

Hours passed and dawn broke. The sun rose into the sky.

As time passed, the sun set and the moon was hanging in the sky.

Over thirty hours had passed!

[All the Martial Artists in the Underworld were reduced by sixty percent. None of those forces that participated in the siege survived!]

[No one escaped. Not even those families and ancestral sects who received news early.]

[Dragon Sect spent fifteen hours wiping out all the ancestral sects and families, and another ten-odd hours to round up those who tried to escape.]

[Gosh, the Underworld is down by sixty percent of its Martial Artists!]

[Once the Dragon King rages, blood flows for a thousand miles!]

[Everyone will pay respect to Dragon Sect. Anyone who offends them will die!]

New posts began to surface in the forum. But the Martial Artists could clearly sense the significant loss in the active members of the Underworld.

All in all, there were over hundreds of thousands of Martial Artists in the Underworld. But now, not even half were left.

The thought of the numbers terrified everyone.

“Dragon King signifies a taboo in the future!”

Some of the forces and families exclaimed to themselves.

Trepidation and fear.

From now on, no one in the Underworld would ever speak ill of the Dragon King.

The future of the Underworld would definitely settle down.

All the families and forces would pass down instructions to their children and disciples that they must address the Dragon King as the King!
