Chapter 1209: 1,210 sword demon’s name

Translator: 5496903

“The three attributes of metal, wood, and earth form the star explosion. With the experience of combining the three attributes, it won’t be as difficult to combine another combat technique as it was at the beginning!”

Wang Xian revealed an excited expression. He looked hesitant. “Should I strike while the iron is hot?”

He was tempted. The moment the star explosion was completed, another combination method appeared in his mind.

The gold-piercing sword, coupled with the fire attribute, water countered fire, and fire countered metal. After casting the gold-piercing sword, he would immediately add fire.

Under the three counter-effects, it would definitely explode!

Wang Xian thought of it and did it. He immediately began to practice.

With the experience of the starburst, his speed was undoubtedly dozens of times faster this time.

“Fire penetrates gold!”

A few hours later, Wang Xian shook the longsword in his hand. The gold-piercing sword was instantly released and a flame followed closely behind.

The gold-piercing sword contained the flexibility of water dripping through stone and water. Coupled with the toughness of the metal attribute, the combination of the two resulted in an explosive increase in attack power.

After adding the flame, the gold-piercing sword exploded due to the incompatibility of the attributes and was divided into more than ten small swords.

This involved not only the incompatibility of the attributes, but also the control of the attributes.

However, it was as if Wang Xian had perfectly mastered the golden water sword principle. Adding an attribute into it was much easier to control than before.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

After the flame penetrated through gold was cast, numerous violent small swords attacked the ground directly.

In an instant, hundreds of holes appeared on the ground. The holes were dozens of meters deep.

This was extremely terrifying on the solid ground of the graveyard of demi-humans.

Under this attack, even the armor of the first level of the Seethrough would be penetrated instantly.

“Haha, I have mastered the combination of two or three attributes!”

Wang Xian laughed and did not continue to practice because he had no inspiration in his mind.

He had stayed here for at least a month. He could definitely go back and practice again.

Wang Xian thought to himself and walked straight out.

I should keep a low profile

Before coming here, he had killed Heavenly Sword Star, the son of the sect leader of Swords Gate. Wang Xian was afraid that there would be an ambush outside, so he took out the mask that he got from Feng Luan.

With the mask on, even an insightful void martial artist would find it hard to see his true appearance.

Wang Xian walked out with a faint smile on his face. He walked in the sword tomb as if he was walking on ordinary ground.

“Eh? Why aren’t there many people in the sword tomb today?”

Wang Xian looked around and realized that there were only two to three people in the sword tomb. A hint of doubt appeared on his face.

However, he didn’t think too much about it. As he walked out of the sword tomb, the familiar smell of blood greeted him.

“I should go back and think of a way to use all the resources in my hands and raise my level!”

As Wang Xian thought to himself, the corners of his mouth curled up slightly. It was so worth it to have such a harvest in less than two months!

“That young man is really unlucky. I heard that a week ago, he saved the second miss of the Zhou clan in the sword tomb. Miss Zhou has a good impression of him. She has been looking for him for the past few days, but in the end, she angered Meng Shaoqin!”

“Miss Zhou is a famous beauty with many suitors. I heard that the Zhou clan might have a marriage alliance with the Meng clan. Meng Shaoqin has been pursuing Miss Zhou for so long. When he saw that it was about to be a good thing, a wild boy suddenly appeared. Naturally, he would be angry!”

Wang Xian walked out. He did not mind the gossip when he heard the discussions around him.

“Kid, how Dare You Snatch My Woman? Have you been idle for too long?”

At this moment, an angry shout was heard.

Wang Xian raised his head and took a curious glance.

However, when he looked over, his expression paused for a moment. He stopped immediately and walked over slowly with a frown.

“Meng Shaoqin, watch what you say!”

In an empty space in front of them, a young man in red was standing there with more than ten people. His gaze was cold as he stared at the young man in front of him, whose clothes were a little tattered and had no expression on his face.

The young man in red had a dark gaze and a tall nose. He looked very uncomfortable.

Beside the young man in tattered clothes stood a woman. The woman had a good figure and a hint of charm.

The woman glared at Meng Shaoqin and said angrily.

“Yanmei, no matter what, I’m going to kill this kid today. Our matter has been decided. I don’t want anyone to disturb us!”

Meng Shaoqin stared at Zhou Yanmei and said with a dark face.

“When has our matter been decided? Don’t talk nonsense!”

Zhou Yanmei stared at Meng Shaoqin and said with an embarrassed expression.

“Not long ago, you will soon receive a message from uncle. Yanmei, come over and stand here with me!”

Meng Shaoqin looked at her with a cold face.

“How did this...”

“Miss, the master has sent a message!” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

At that moment, the old woman standing next to Zhou Yanmei interrupted her and handed over the communication stone plate.

“What?”

Zhou Yanmei was slightly stunned. She looked at the message on the communication stone plate and her expression changed slightly.

“Miss, the marriage between the Zhou clan and the Meng Clan has just been decided. The matter between you and young master Meng has already been decided!”

The old woman stood off to the side and transmitted her voice.

“But... but I don’t like this Meng...”

As she spoke, her expression changed. She didn’t like Meng Shaoqin, but if the clan really decided on this matter, then it was definitely not something she could change.

She would definitely marry Meng Shaoqin in the future.

“Young miss, young master Meng likes you. Moreover, young master Meng’s talent is very outstanding. Things can not be changed. Do not let young master Meng be dissatisfied with you. Otherwise, in the future...”

The old woman continued to send her voice transmission. She did not finish her words, but she knew that young miss would understand.

She had watched young miss grow up and knew her character.

“I understand!”

Zhou Yanmei took a deep breath and nodded slowly. The ending was already set. She wanted to be married to Meng Shaoqin.

It was not worth it to delay the rest of her life for a man whom she only had a good impression of.

The smart her knew that she should make such a decision.

“He saved my life in the sword tomb at least. Let Him Go!”

Zhou Yanmei raised her head to look at Meng Shaoqin as she spoke and walked straight over.

Meng Shaoqin saw her walking over and a smile appeared on his face. “Yanmei, this won’t do. If he dares to compete with me for you, he’ll have to pay the price!”

“This can not be changed!”

“Alright then, I’ll leave First!”

Zhou Yanmei frowned slightly and wanted to leave this place.

“There’s no need to be in such a hurry. Later, we’ll leave together. My clan’s people are not far away!”

Meng Shaoqin looked at Zhou Yanmei and said somewhat domineeringly.

“Alright!”

Zhou Yanmei pondered for a moment and nodded.

At this point, in this area, Meng Shaoqin was standing on the left with more than ten people, while on the right, a young man in tattered clothes stood there alone.

“Damn, this young man is too miserable. He actually... He saved Miss Zhou Er’s life, and now he’s going to be killed because of it, and Miss Zhou Er actually didn’t stop him!”

“This is a typical woman who is like a disaster. This Miss Zhou Er is really ruthless. Other people saved her, but she was attacked because of her, and she actually didn’t say a word!”

“F * ck, doesn’t Miss Zhou Er have a good impression of him? Is This Love?”

“Fuck, you believe in love, You Idiot!”
