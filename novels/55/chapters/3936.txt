Translator: 549690339

“Hiss, this…”

Xu Xinrun sensed the spatial confinement force around him. He swept his gaze across his surroundings and took a deep breath. His expression was extremely awkward.

It was not because of teacher he’s words that he felt extremely awkward.

It was because of the surrounding spatial swords that he felt extremely awkward.

Wang Xian’s attack was not just the previous attacks.

There were also attacks with the same destructive power around him.

He actually did not notice it.

If teacher he did not stop him, these space swords would have caused him serious injuries even if they did not kill him.

“That Wang Xian actually hid his attacks around Xu Xinrun. If it wasn ‘t for teacher he, he would have suffered a terrifying attack. ”

“Oh my God, Wang Xian’s strength is not as simple as I thought. He actually left an attack around brother run. ”

“Not simple, not simple at all. That Wang Xian has the strength to fight against an existence at level nine of Eternal Swordsman. ”

When the surrounding students saw this scene, they sucked in a breath of cold air. Their faces were filled with shock. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

No one expected that Wang Xian actually left an attack around Xu Xinrun.

His strength was really terrifying!

Student Wang Xian is really powerful. Let me experience your strength. ”

NIE youwei had a solemn expression on her face as well. In an instant, she arrived in front of Wang Xian and spoke to him.

If it was just a moment ago, Xu Xinrun might have been careless. However, after witnessing the second attack, nie youwei completely restrained her contempt!

She cupped her hands at Wang Xian.

“Please Enlighten Me! ”

Wang Xian nodded his head.

At the side, Xu Xinrun’s expression kept changing as he walked to the side.

This time, he had lost a lot of face.

Buzz Buzz

Two spatial barriers landed on Wang Xian and the rest.

Without any hesitation, Wang Xian moved his body and disappeared instantly!

NIE youwei’s gaze was locked onto Wang Xian as she sensed the changes in the surrounding space.

“Whoosh! ”

In an instant, she attacked a place!

Wang Xian had just appeared in another place when he felt a sharp sword attacking him. The sharp sword in his hand was held horizontally in front of his body.

“Bang, Bang!”

The sharp sword blocked the attack and Wang Xian could not help but fly back a few thousand meters.

The gap between their realms was still there.

However, Wang Xian wasn’t injured. This time, he didn’t teleport but flew in the air.

The sharp sword in his hand kept swinging, leaving sword mounds in the air.

Sword mounds were the core of the Heaven origin sword technique.

By setting up sword mounds, he activated the surrounding energy and unleashed an even more powerful attack.

Nie you could feel Wang Xian’s strength and saw him brandishing his sword around her.

She didn’t hesitate at all. Her body trembled and a wave of spatial power enveloped Wang Xian.

Spatial suppression!

He was a level higher than Wang Xian. His greatest advantage was the spatial suppression.

The suppression of the entire space made Wang Xian unable to teleport and greatly reduced his speed!

He could even use the power of space to suppress the weak to death.

“Clang, Clang, Clang! ”

Wang Xian waved his arm and the sword tomb around him immediately erupted, allowing him to break through nie youwei’s spatial suppression.

In the next instant, Wang Xian teleported behind nie youwei and smiled. “Line sword draw! ”

Line sword draw.

This was one of the ways to use the heaven origin sword technique.

The Heaven origin sword technique was based on the sword tomb, not on the attack.

With the sword tomb as the core, the move was based on the user.

When Wang Xian arrived behind nie youwei, the sharp swords were like a line, attacking her directly.

The sharp swords formed from the space attribute possessed the characteristics of the space attribute.

Fast!

There was nothing faster than the spatial attribute!

NIE youwei’s gaze focused when she saw the attack of the line sword draw.

“Spatial vibration, Break!”

She shouted in a low voice, and a sword ray attack that seemed to be more powerful than the line sword draw broke through it!

The sword ray directly cut through the line sword draw.

However, what made nie youwei frown was that the line sword draw seemed to be endless.

After being broken by her, it reappeared again!

Whoosh

At this moment, another line of sword was attacking her from the other side of him.

This caused her expression to change completely.

“What a powerful sword technique! ”

Her expression was extremely grave. Her body trembled and she wasn’t prepared to continue defending. Instead, she teleported directly!

Buzz

Her figure started to turn illusory.

At the side, Wang Xian sensed the spatial fluctuations around him. With a wave of his arm, two one-line swords flew in one direction.

Bang! Bang

When nie youwei appeared at another location, two one-line swords had already arrived in front of her.

“What a strong sense. You can actually sense the location of my teleportation. ”

NIE youwei’s expression changed again. She immediately waved the longsword in her hand. “Endless Sword Slash! ”

With a wave of her arm, terrifying space-tearing swords shot towards the two one-line swords.

Buzz

While she was blocking the attack, Wang Xian teleported again.

Once again, he condensed the same attack.

“This… Nie youwei is actually in a completely passive state. This is simply under the control of that Wang Xian! ”

(‘D * mn, it can’t be. Nie youwei is completely suppressed. What kind of sword technique is this? Why does it look so strange?”

“His sword technique is powerful, and his senses are also extremely terrifying.

He can really fight above his level. ”

Below, all the students watched this sparring in shock.

Xu Xinrun was defeated partly due to carelessness.

However, nie youwei had put in 120% of her energy in her fight with NIE youwei.

Under such circumstances, she was actually completely suppressed.

“This is bad. This strange sword is constantly increasing. I can only attack continuously. If I defend with all my strength, although I can withstand it, it can only last for a few seconds at most. The attack of a sword isn’t strong, but under the continuous situation, I can’t Hold On. ”

Nie youwei’s expression was extremely grave.

She had fallen into a dead end.

Faced with this strange attack, she had no way to deal with it.

Her gaze swept past Wang Xian and saw his relaxed expression. NIE youwei’s expression changed again.

He shouldn’t have used his full strength yet.

“I’ve lost.”

NIE youwei gritted her teeth and admitted defeat.

When Wang Xian heard that, a smile appeared on his face. With a tap of the longsword in his hand, one line after another disappeared.

“Thank you for letting me win! ”

He smiled and cupped his hands.

“Student Wang Xian, what… What kind of sword technique is this?”

Nie you couldn ‘t help but ask Wang Xian.

She could feel that Wang Xian ‘s sword technique was extremely terrifying.

The level of his sword technique was also very high.

“Nine-origin sword technique! ”

Wang Xian said casually. He didn’t mention that this sword technique was called the heaven-origin sword technique.

The two words ‘heaven-origin’represented that the level was too high..
