Chapter 1376: The rise of 1376 Dragons and phoenixes

“Xiaoyao City? The mayor of Xiaoyao City?”

Wang Xian muttered to himself when he heard Feng Luan’s introduction.

He didn’t expect there to be such an expert in the Liuhai region.

With the strength of a fifth level void interpretation realm expert, he could be considered one of the strongest experts in the human-demon graveyard.

“The letter of the King of Xiaoyao City? I can go and take a look at it when the time comes. If there are more than 20 dynasties participating in it, I can make use of the items in my hands!”

Wang Xian thought to himself.

After destroying some dynasties, he had too many treasures in his hands.

Converting these treasures into resources would increase his strength by a lot.

After Wang Xian obtained some information about Xiaoyao city from Feng Luan, he started to check it out.

Two hours passed very quickly. At this moment, it was bustling outside the dragon-phoenix royal city.

City lords from the 64 cities under the dragon-phoenix dynasty, as well as powerful families and mercenary groups from each city, all rushed over.

As the Imperial City of the dragon-phoenix dynasty, it was the central city of the entire dynasty.

The people from the 64 cities under the dragon-phoenix Dynasty naturally came to pay a visit.

Furthermore, the Phoenix-phoenix dynasty was wantonly holding the selection, the dragon-phoenix Dynasty’s prodigy selection, the dragon-phoenix Dynasty’s powerful mercenary group selection, the dragon-phoenix Dynasty’s expert selection, and so on.

Holding all kinds of selection was to retain talents and experts.

The Dragon and Phoenix Empire had over 10 million people. With the size of the imperial city, it was enough to house over 20 million people.

Next, the imperial city began to attract powerful families and powerful mercenary groups.

As the center of more than 60 cities, it was naturally easy to attract some experts.

Many people wanted to settle in the imperial city, but the imperial city was not as easy to enter as it used to be.

“Is this our imperial city? It’s so spectacular. It’s even bigger than the imperial city of our Dongyuan Dynasty!”

“Can you imagine that the entire imperial city has only been established for a year? This glittering city protection array is truly astonishing!”

“I heard that the victory of this war was entirely dependent on a lord king. Those creatures that are more than thirty meters long are all his!”

“Our current queen is also very powerful. The king of star-moon Empire was killed by the Queen!”

“It is said that there are only a dozen or so profound void martial experts in the imperial city. Their foundations are still rather low. If this queen is not capable, she might not be able to manage more than sixty cities well!”

Groups of people were riding on Vicious Beasts, and some were being pulled by cars.

There were also some who were carrying carts full of items. Within a short period of time, four to five thousand people had gathered at the east gate.

They looked at the Dragon and Phoenix Empire, and walked in with a trace of curiosity and suspicion.

“HMM?”

When they had just entered the city gate, they noticed that there were over thirty middle-aged men holding golden longswords in their hands.

They held their longswords with both hands and watched them enter indifferently!

Behind them, there were more than a hundred middle-aged men with longswords in their hands.

“This is... an insightful void realm expert. The thirty middle-aged swordsmen in front are all insightful void realm experts. Behind them, there are more than a hundred half-step insightful void realm experts!”

“Heavens, is this the power of the dragon-phoenix Empire? How terrifying!”

“The dragon-phoenix Empire doesn’t have so many experts. They should be the subordinates of that Lord Wang. They are simply abnormal. They actually have more than thirty insightful emptiness realm experts under them, and they are not ordinary insightful emptiness realm experts!”

Just as they passed through the city gate, when they saw more than thirty insightful emptiness realm experts scattered around, everyone’s faces froze.

The traces of contempt in their hearts completely disappeared.

“Why do I feel that someone has locked onto us?”

Right at this moment, a insightful emptiness realm expert suddenly frowned slightly and looked towards the surrounding buildings.

“Hiss, look at the surrounding and distant buildings. There are experts monitoring the entire city!”

“Insightful emptiness realm expert, I faintly feel more than twenty gazes that are threatening me!”

“Oh my God, the swordsman guards at the door, the experts watching from above, the patrolling guards around... why do I feel that there are at least seventy to eighty insightful emptiness realm experts!”

“The dragon-phoenix Queen is trying to intimidate us. It is said that that Lord King has a close relationship with the dragon-phoenix Queen. Every time the dragon-phoenix Empire encounters difficulties, that person will make a move!”

“Too powerful. The dragon-phoenix Queen is not simple either. For her to be able to develop to such a level in a year’s time, she is much more powerful than the kings of ordinary dynasties!”

“Keep a low profile in the Dragon Phoenix Imperial City. Fighting is prohibited within the city. void interpretation experts are just like ordinary people. Bullying the weak is prohibited. The emperor is guilty of the same crime as the commoners!”

“Although the rules of the Dragon Phoenix Imperial City are extremely strict, one can still see the strength and methods of the Dragon Phoenix Queen!”

More and more people entered the imperial city. They sized up the city, their eyes filled with reverence.

The Imperial City was indeed the imperial city.

This caused many factions and families to consider whether they should settle down in the imperial city.

Feng Luan had laid down many benefits and policies in the imperial city. Even some of the Dongxu family’s hearts wavered.

Over two days, over a million people poured into the dragon-phoenix imperial city.

These two days could be said to be the proudest period of time for the citizens of the entire dragon-phoenix Imperial City.

Those powerhouses whom they had seen before greeted them respectfully.

Some powerful families were asking them about some information about the royal city with enthusiasm.

This made every citizen feel proud and proud of being a member of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire.

“Wang Xian, the ceremony is about to begin. Come and take a look!”

On the third day, Feng Luan came to a lake courtyard where Wang Xian and the group of girls were staying. She said with a smile on her face.

“Has it started? Alright, I’ll go over and take a look. Shu Qing, are you guys coming?”

Wang Xian nodded with a smile and asked.

“Yes, of course!”

The group of girls nodded with a smile. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

With the addition of Zhang Fengying and Xiao Yu, the strength of the seven girls had all reached the insightful void stage. Sun Lingxiu had even reached the second level of the insightful void stage.

The improvement of the cultivation of the group of girls made even Feng Luan a little jealous.

She was the empress, but she was only slightly stronger than the group of girls. This made her very speechless.

The group of people walked toward the banquet.

The first ceremony of the dragon-phoenix dynasty, the city lords of the sixty-four cities, the leaders of the corps in the cities, and the families of the profound void martial stage in the cities had all arrived.

“Her Majesty the Queen is Here!”

“Her Majesty the Queen is Here!”

In the noisy grand ceremony, more than 10,000 distinguished experts were conversing in low voices.

When a woman’s cold voice rang out, everyone instantly fell silent.

Feng Luan, who was dressed in a fiery red phoenix robe, walked over slowly.

Wang Xian and a group of girls walked to the side and walked straight to a separate seat beside the main seat.

They didn’t steal Feng Luan’s elegance.

At this moment, everyone’s gaze was focused on Feng Luan and Wang Xian.

“Welcome, your Majesty!”

When Feng Luan came to the main seat, more than 60 city lords, top-notch experts, and important members of their families immediately bowed and stood up.

A total of more than 60 insightful void martial artists and more than 10,000 others shouted respectfully.

Dragon and Phoenix dynasty, the true rise!
