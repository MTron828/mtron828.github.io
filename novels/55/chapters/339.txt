Chapter 340: Frog In The Well

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

A harsh, disdainful voice sounded and shocked everyone.

The crowd looked towards the source of the voice, trying to determine who the one mocking was, and if he was qualified to do so!

Huh?

When Bian Yaoquan heard this voice, he immediately turned around. When he saw Wang Xian, he squinted his eyes.

The surrounding crowd also looked at Wang Xian in shock.

“Oh, Miracle Doctor Wang, what rights do you have to ridicule me? Who gave you the courage?”

Before Bian Yaoquan even spoke, an Inborn expert stared at Wang Xian and questioned him harshly.

“That’s right! The Arts of Refining Elixir Pills are profound. Young Master Bian’s Arts of Refining Elixir Pills could already be considered to be grandmaster class. You are a far cry from Young Master Bian,” another Inborn expert said with contempt, glowering at Wang Xian.

“Tsk! You better watch your mouth! Otherwise, I’ll do it for you!”

Bian Yaoquan’s lips curved up slightly as he stared coldly at Wang Xian.

“Hehe! It’s nothing much. I just saw an explosion and found it hilarious!” Sensing that everyone’s attention had gathered on him, Wang Xian replied with a smile.

“Huh? Brat, do you even know what refining elixir pills is? Do you know the steps of refining elixir pills? Do you know what is meant by elixir formation rate?”

Bian Yaoquan pulled a long face upon hearing Wang Xian. He questioned harshly, “You are just a brat who doesn’t know anything and yet you dare to question me? If you don’t know anything, just shut your mouth.”

“For an alchemist, achieving an elixir formation rate of ten percent could be considered outstanding. Pill explosion is a really common occurrence!” a Miracle Doctor took a glance at Wang Xian and commented plainly.

“Oh? Is it?”

Wang Xian looked mockingly at Bian Yaoquan, turned to the few Inborn experts who spoke up for him and remarked, “I know a little about refining elixir pills too. Moreover, it happens that I know the elixir pill recipe for a Blood Cleansing Pill.”

As he spoke, he walked towards the place where the spiritual medicine was placed. He looked at the two elixir pills in his hands, shook his head and commented, “What a waste! In my eyes, your refining skills are too trash!”

Huh?

Wang Xian’s arrogant words shocked the surrounding crowd as they all turned towards him.

“Shut up! Do you even know anything about the Arts of Refining Elixir Pills?” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Bian Yaoquan pulled a long face and glowered at Wang Xian. “As a factionless doctor, there’s no way you would know about it. Yet, you dared to criticize my Arts of Refining Elixir Pills?”

“I do know a little and am definitely better than you in it!” Wang Xian smiled plainly. After which, he looked to the spiritual medicine beside him and said emotionlessly, “Step aside!”

After completing his words, he moved his arm.

Rumble!

Dull red flames appeared on Wang Xian’s hand instantly.

Waving his hand once again, tufts of spiritual medicine flew towards him.

Huh? Seeing that Wang Xian was starting to refine elixir pills, Bian Yaoquan instantly turned gloomy. He looked at the flames on Wang Xian’s hand and revealed a mocking smile. “That’s just an ordinary flame. Even if you know about refining elixir pills, your elixir formation rate will be less than ten percent. That will be a total waste of spiritual medicine!”

“Look closely! Frog in the well!” Wang Xian remarked plainly. His remarks infuriated Bian Yaoquan as he clenched his fist tightly.

“In that case, I would like to see what you are capable of to be so brazen here!”

The surrounding experts and Miracle Doctors looked at Wang Xian, baffled.

“How would a factionless doctor be capable of getting in touch with the Arts of Refining Elixir Pills? He’s just trying to garner attention!” the Elder from the Sacred Followers Guild said, pulling a long face.

Just as the Elder from the Sacred Followers Guild finished his words, Wang Xian waved his arm and nine small cups made of flames appeared before him.

The appearance of nine vivid flame cups shocked the crowd.

“His control of fire is so incredible! He can actually form replica objects with flames. This Miracle Doctor Wang is definitely not weak.”

The eyes of an Inborn expert constricted as he looked at the nine small cups.

“He’s actually capable of forming replica objects with flames!” Bian Yaoquan shivered in anger but was shocked by what Wang Xian was capable of.

Puff!

In this instant, tufts of spiritual medicine were thrown into each cup as Wang Xian moved his arm again slightly.

The spiritual medicine melted at an unbelievable speed.

“How can this be possible? How could he melt them so quickly?”

Bian Yaoquan couldn’t help but exclaim after witnessing the speed at which the spiritual medicine was turned into liquid.

When Wang Xian heard his voice, he remarked emotionlessly.

“Shut up, frog in the well!”

“YOU...”

Bian Yaoquan opened his eyes widely and gave Wang Xian a deathly stare.

Wang Xian didn’t pay attention to him. He was focused on the spiritual liquid and gradually fusing them together.

One, two, three.

In a short span of ten seconds, three balls of liquid had coalesced together.

“Elixir pills, form!” Wang Xian shouted. As the flame dissipated, he grabbed the three green pills with his hand.

The green was the same shade as a jadestone and the pills had an alluring glow to them.

“Three elixir pills. Given a hundred sets of spiritual medicine for the Blood Cleansing Pill, I can probably get three hundred Blood Cleansing Pills. Yeah, that’s it!”

Wang Xian smiled faintly and handed the Blood Cleansing Pill to the middle-aged man in military uniform.

The middle-aged man in military uniform was shocked to see the elixir pills Wang Xian had handed to him. He took up the elixir pills made by Bian Yaoquan and made a comparison.

To his astonishment, the glow and luster of Bian Yaoquan’s elixir pills were a little inferior.

The surrounding crowd was shocked too. The whole process appeared to be too easy and casual. Bian Yaoquan had taken approximately ten minutes to make two elixir pills previously. Moreover, he seemed cautious throughout the whole process.

On the other hand, this Miracle Doctor Wang had made three elixir pills within a minute. Furthermore, he looked casual and relaxed throughout the same process. From this, one could tell the difference in their strengths.

They were on a completely different scale.

“Three hundred elixir pills... This... How could this be possible...?”

A Miracle Doctor felt disbelief and gave a deadly stare at the Blood Cleansing Pills in the middle-aged man in military uniform’s hands.

“A hundred percent success rate? Nine hundred tufts of Level 3 spiritual medicine for three hundred elixir pills? This can’t be possible!”

“Three tufts of Level 3 spiritual medicine for an elixir pill with effects of a Level 4 spiritual medicine? This is crazy! This is crazy!”

“This can’t be. It definitely isn’t possible. How can he do this so quickly?”

Bian Yaoquan’s eyes had popped wide open. Disbelief was written all over his face. “Even a Level 5 and 6 Alchemist couldn’t attain a hundred percent success rate. This couldn’t be possible,” shouted Bian Yaoquan.

“Nothing is impossible!”

Wang Xian revealed a mocking smirk upon seeing how Bian Yaoquan had reacted. “With your level of expertise, how could you even claim to be unrivalled? What a joke!”

Wang Xian laughed and looked at the middle-aged man in military uniform. “Leave this spiritual medicine to me. Three hundred elixir pills shouldn’t be a problem.”

“Really? Even if you give us two hundred or a hundred, it would be fine. As long as Miracle Doctor Wang can do it, you can enter the National Treasury to pick a treasure!” the middle-aged man in military uniform said with beaming eyes.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded his head and continued, “I’ll need a quiet room!”

“Sure, we will arrange for it immediately!”

The middle-aged man in military uniform agreed without any hesitation. As for Bian Yaoquan, who was standing next to him, he had completely forgotten about him.

For the same amount of materials, one could only give forty to fifty pills while the other could give three hundred.

The two men weren’t on the same scale. Therefore, he naturally knew how to choose.

As for that Bian Yaoquan, he could just stay away.

It wasn’t that the middle-aged man in military uniform was ruthless. It was just that the difference in their expertise in refining elixir pills was too great!
