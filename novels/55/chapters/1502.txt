Chapter 1503: 1503

“How... How is this possible?”

“A seventh-level profound void tier vicious beast cub, it actually...”

At this moment, in a room thousands of meters away from the holy tree, he Feng, who was in a sorry state, saw the scene on the screen, and a shocked expression appeared on his face.

Even the clan leader of the He clan, who was standing by the side, was slightly moved.

The He clan only had eight level 7 profound void martial experts, and this didn’t include the forest fairy clan.

The forest fairy clan was prepared to say that they didn’t belong to the He clan, but to the holy tree.

In other words, the He clan couldn’t order the forest fairy clan, but if someone attacked the He clan’s forest, the Forest Fairy would have to act and resist the enemy.

Every level seven Seethrough expert was extremely precious to the He clan.

Now, Wang Xian had actually gifted a level seven Seethrough level ferocious beast cub. With the strength of the He clan, they could definitely nurture it to level seven Seethrough level.

In other words, the He clan’s forest had increased the strength of a level seven Seethrough level expert.

One had to know that a level seven Seethrough level expert could create a second-rate force. Such a treasure was not something that could be bought with spirit stones.

“Husband, this... what is the identity of this young man?”

The woman at the side looked at the scene on the screen with a face full of shock. She turned her head and asked the He clan leader in a daze.

She was naturally very clear about a seventh level profound void martial artist bloodline vicious Beast Cub.

Even she could not bring out such a gift for her son’s birthday. This could no longer be described as precious.

He Feng was also waiting for his father’s answer with a shocked expression. Now, he vaguely understood why his father was so polite to that young man

“Not long ago, a rank seven profound void martial artist killed two rank seven profound void martial artists. The towering Sky Sword sect established the Heartless Sword Dao sect. With his strength, it is still possible for him to bring out such a precious thing!”

“Although the flowing sea region is small, it has already been unified under his push!”

“Now, his age is not even as old as Yuan ‘er!”

The He clan leader looked at his wife and son and said with a twinkle in his eyes.

“What?”

He Feng widened his eyes and stared at his father in disbelief.

“This...”

The woman at the side was also filled with shock.

“The last time you sent someone to assassinate him, he had already killed you easily. In a few days, you should go and apologize to him!”

“His talent is too terrifying. A Heaven’s pride, before he grew up, he was only a heaven’s pride, but he had already grown up. Even I might not be his match!”

The He clan leader said indifferently to He Feng.

“Gulp!”

He Feng could not help but swallow a mouthful of saliva.

He had actually sent people to assassinate a profound void tier 7 expert.

He had actually provoked a profound void tier 7 expert.

No wonder he could easily insta-kill him.

When he thought of this, he was somewhat absent-minded. If he was not the He clan’s young master, and he did not know he yuan, he might have already been killed by him.

The dignity of a powerhouse was not to be violated.

Especially for a powerhouse at such a level, so what if he killed him? It would be extremely difficult for the He clan to hunt him down.

“I... I know, Father!”

He Feng raised his head in horror and looked at the young man in the picture. He nodded his head in fear.

...

“Brother Wang Xian, you are really... really a brother!”

At the birthday banquet venue, he yuan was so excited that he didn’t know what to say as he looked at the ferocious beast cubs that Wang Xian had given him.

“Alright, Enjoy Your Birthday!”

Wang Xian smiled nonchalantly.

“I’m sorry, Young Master Wang Xian. It’s my fault for what happened last time and what happened today!”

Lin Yaoyao walked over and apologized to Wang Xian.

“No Need!”

Wang Xian shook his head lightly and smiled at her. “If you want to carve an item, I can carve one for you!”

“No need, no need. I have already prepared a gift for brother he yuan. I Won’t trouble you!”

Lin Yaoyao waved her hand hurriedly. She was at a loss for what to do with Wang Xian’s attitude.

A young man who could make the He clan leader be so courteous.

A young man who could bring out the cub of a seventh-level Seethrough ferocious beast.

In her opinion, it was normal for him to not give her face.

However, she was at a loss for what to do now that he was so courteous.

Wang Xian smiled and nodded at her faintly.

This made Lin Yaoyao’s face turn slightly red as she lowered her head and sneaked a glance at Wang Xian.

He was really a handsome human with a personality.

“Young master Wang Xian, let’s take a seat at the side!”

He Suiqing invited Wang Xian.

At this moment, she no longer had any thoughts about little goody.

A young ferocious beast at the seventh level of the Seethrough realm. Regardless of whether he yuan was willing to give it to her or not, even if he agreed, the He clan would not agree.

This thing was too precious.

“Okay!”

Wang Xian nodded his head and sat at the side.

Dui Dazhuang looked at He suiqing, Lin Yaoyao, he yuan, and the rest with some restraint. He stood there stiffly without moving.

“Sit down!”

Wang Xian glanced at him and said with a smile.

“This... Hehe, brother Wang Xian, this...”

Dui Dazhuang smiled awkwardly.

He had never expected that Wang Xian would be so awesome.

“Oh right, he yuan, this is Lone Wood Dazhuang. He is a friend that I know in the vast region. He is a subordinate force of your he clan. Can you arrange for him to join your army, or...”

Wang Xian said to he yuan who was beside him.

“Oh? Lone Wood Dazhuang, Haha, that’s Easy. I remember when we first met, I wanted brother Wang Xian to keep a pet for me. Coincidentally, I haven’t found him yet. He can come!”

He Yuan waved his hand nonchalantly.

Dui Dazhuang, who was at the side, was excited. His eyes were filled with incomparable excitement.

Raising a pet for young master he yuan, Young Master He Yuan was a Beast Tamer. He was equivalent to young master he Yuan’s trusted aide.

One step to the sky, one step to the sky!

“Thank you, young master he. Thank you, Young Master He. I’ve long heard that young master he is extraordinary. It’s as if he is the reincarnation of a god. Now, it seems like that’s really the case. He’s as handsome as brother Wang Xian!”

Dui Dazhuang flattered him excitedly.

“Haha, brother Wang Xian, this friend of yours is quite interesting!”

He Yuan laughed out loud.

Around them, Dui Jiang, Yuan Xun er, and Dui Dazhuang’s fiancée, Lu Lianjin, widened their eyes when they saw this scene.

They had never expected that Dui Dazhuang, who they had always looked down on and even allowed others to bully him, would actually soar to the sky.

In the future, he would be a person from a completely different world from them. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

In the future, the one-tree Dazhuang, this fatty whom they looked down on, would actually become an existence that they needed to look up to.

All of this was because of that incomparably mysterious youth.

A single sentence could change a person’s fate, and a single sentence could make one fly over the Dragon Gate.

The gazes of everyone around were filled with reverence.
