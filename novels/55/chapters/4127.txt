The resources in this corpse of the dark-attributed Tianyuan creation had exceeded Wang Xian’s expectations.

Now, the Tai Chi Dragon Plate had already reached the pinnacle of the universe.

There was still a long way to go before he could make a breakthrough!

It was even very difficult to make a breakthrough.

The reason why the five elements grinding could make a breakthrough was because he had absorbed the god of elements.

The god of elements fragment was an existence comparable to the Heaven’s origin creation in the chaos.

Under such circumstances, the Five Elements Millstone was able to complete the breakthrough.

As for the Tai Chi Dragon Disc, it was also able to break through through by absorbing treasures of this level.

The Tai Chi Dragon Disc and the five elements millstone were able to break through without shackles.

It was because of these two treasures. One of the treasures was forged with the five elements origin as the foundation, with the Five Elements Dragon Soul as the core.

The breakthrough was achieved through continuous devouring and strengthening!

The Tai Chi Dragon Disc was achieved through the heart of Light and darkness and the yin-yang Dragon Soul as the core!

This was especially so for the five elements millstone. When it was being nurtured in Wang Xian’s body, it had also absorbed the energy of the ancestral tree.

This was the reason why the five elements Millstone was able to achieve a breakthrough easily.

It was extremely difficult for any object to reach the level of Heaven’s fate.

However, the Five Elements Millstone and the Tai Chi Dragon Disc were somewhat special.

They were originally the core of the two top-tier Dragon Kings, the Five Elements Dragon King and the light and Dark Dragon King.

There was an extremely pure dark energy source in this corpse. The tai chi dragon disc could absorb it quickly.

“These resources might have improved the Tai Chi Dragon Disc. ”

Wang Xian looked at all the resources and his eyes glowed. He immediately placed the Tai Chi Dragon disc in the mother nest and allowed it to absorb these resources.

In addition, this corpse could be said to be an extremely pure energy.

This energy could even be absorbed by Wang Xian and allow him to quickly recover from the injuries in his body.

However, it was too extravagant to use the corpse of a heaven’s origin creator to recover from his injuries.

Wang Xian was not extravagant to such an extent.

“After absorbing all these treasures, if the Taiji dragon plate can not make a breakthrough, I should be able to absorb the energy from this corpse! ” Wang Xian calculated in his heart and looked forward to it.

If he could really achieve a breakthrough, it would be a huge improvement to his strength.

However, he was not 100% confident!

The resources in the corpse were a huge surprise to Wang Xian.

He sat cross-legged on the bed and continued to recover from his injuries.

With some of the resources from the Unicorn Ox, Wang Xian’s recovery time could be shortened significantly.

Time passed day by day.

Tianci came to his place to sleep every night.

The ancestral tree was constantly diverting some energy to nourish the ultimate treasure of Tianyuan in his body and establish a connection with it.Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Occasionally, Wang Xian would play with Tianci for a while!

In the blink of an eye, another half a year had passed!

“SOB, SOB, SOB, sob!”

“SOB, SOB, SOB, sob!”

On this day, Wang Xian was still recovering from his injuries.

Suddenly, the sound of crying came from the side, causing him to open his eyes slightly!

Wang Xian opened his eyes and looked at tianci who was at the side. When he saw him sobbing continuously, a smile appeared on his face.

“Tianci, what’s Wrong?”

Wang Xian asked him curiously.

“Uncle, I’m too stupid!”

When Tianci saw Wang Xian, he couldn’t help but hug him and continue crying.

“Stupid? How can that be? Tianci, you are very smart and very powerful. How Can You Be Stupid?”

Wang Xian patted his head and comforted him with a smile.

(‘I am very stupid. Grandpa also said that I’m stupid. He said that other people’s children only need a few days to enter the beginner’s level of cultivation while I need a few months to enter the beginner’s level. ”

“He said that Pm destined to be a weakling in the future and that I’m destined to be a grain of sand in the upcoming crisis. ”

Tianci raised his head and said to Wang Xian with an aggrieved expression!

“Beginner level of cultivation?”

Wang Xian was slightly stunned when he heard his words.

He sensed Tianci’s body.

He could feel that there was a water-elemental energy in TIANCPs body.

This water-elemental energy was extremely weak. It had not even reached the level of a god.

For children born to top-notch experts, the beginner level was the level of a God who had ignited the divine fire.

In the Mu Li tribe, some children with good talent could enter the entry level in a few days.

On the other hand, tianci needed a few months to enter the entry level from the beginning of his cultivation.

In the eyes of some powerhouses, this talent was too trashy!

“It’s a little funny! ”

Wang Xian looked at tianci and listened to the aggrieved words that he kept saying. He felt that it was a little funny!

Mu Li’s body had the wood-attributed Heaven’s origin creation treasure.

Naturally, it was much slower to absorb the energy of the water attribute.

This was especially so for this wood-type heavenly Yuan creation treasure, which had just begun to be born.

If a person who shared the same fate as a heavenly yuan creation treasure cultivated slowly, then no one in the world would be faster than him!

It could be said that the beginning of Heaven’s gift was the end point that billions of living beings could not reach.

Even the heavenly yuan creation experts were envious of Heaven’s Gift’s beginning.

Even if he didn’t cultivate, the wood element Heaven’s origin treasure in his body could absorb energy and grow to a terrifying level.

At this level, even a beginner-level Heaven’s origin powerhouse wouldn’t be a match for him!

“It’s a pity that Heaven’s gift is on the wrong path now.” Wang Xian thought to himself.

However, he couldn’t blame Heaven’s Gift’s grandfather.

The six paths universe was different from the nine-origin universe.

In the six paths universe, after a baby was born, he could cultivate any attribute.

Of course, under normal circumstances, it was best to cultivate the attribute that his parents cultivated. This way, his talent would be better.

As for other things, for example, some people couldn’t cultivate the fire attribute or the water attribute. This wasn’t the case.

Tianci’s grandfather was a ruler of the universe. However, the ultimate treasure of Tianyuan was not something that he could understand.

Furthermore, this ultimate treasure of Tianyuan had just been born, so it instinctively hid itself.

If it was not the Tianyuan attribute, it would be difficult to discover the situation inside his body.

That was why it was said that Tianci’s talent was very, very poor and it was hard for him to achieve anything in his life!

(‘I can’t let him take the wrong path. ”

Wang Xian looked at tianci and patted his head. “Tianci, you are not stupid at all. You were born to stand at the top of all living things! ”

“Your future will be something that no one dares to imagine. It is also something that your grandfather will never be able to achieve. ”

As he spoke, he looked at Tianci who was beside him. “Do you understand?”

“Uncle, I understand a little. Am I really not stupid?”

Tianci looked at Wang Xian and asked expectantly.

“Of course. The water attribute that your grandfather taught you is not suitable for you. I will teach you the method to cultivate the wood attribute.”

Wang Xian said to tianci.

“The method to cultivate the wood attribute?”

Tianci looked at Wang Xian with doubt.

“Yes, it is similar to the cultivation of the water attribute. I will teach you the basics. Try Again!”

Wang Xian said to Tianci as a stream of information entered his mind..
