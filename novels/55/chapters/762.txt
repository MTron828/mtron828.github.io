“Elder Mu, Hua Hou, we’ll take our leave First!”

After asking for a section of the uniform Chang Shu from the natural born celestial sect, Wang Xian said goodbye to Elder Mu and the rest.

“Dragon King, are you ready to go back? If the shop opens, we’ll go and support it!”

Elder MU said with a smile.

“I’m preparing to go to the mysterious sea. When the shop officially opens, I’ll definitely invite all of you!”

Wang Xian smiled and nodded at them.

There were some problems with the shop.

This morning, Mo Qinglong called to report to him. After his investigation, it was best for the shop not to be built in a city below the gate of immortality but in a real city.

This was because the city below the gate of immortality belonged to the territory of the gate of immortality. There were two advantages to it. One was that there was a 100% guarantee of safety and there was more traffic.

However, there was also a drawback. If there was a conflict with the gate of immortality, the shop would be eliminated without any ability to resist.

Therefore, the question now was whether to place the shop in the city under the gate of immortality or in the real world.

Wang Xian hesitated for a moment and agreed with Mo Qinglong’s decision.

The city under the gate of immortality would be destroyed if anything happened. Even the elixirs might be taken away by the gate of immortality.

However, if it was in the real world, whoever dared to cause trouble would be screwed!

“The mysterious sea? Some of our senior and junior brothers and sisters from the celestial sect are planning to go there today!”

When flower fairy heard that Wang Xian was going to the mysterious sea, her eyes lit up slightly.

“Oh, is that so? If It’s on the way, let’s go together!”

Wang Xian said with a smile on his face.

“Alright!”

Flower fairy nodded happily.

“You’re not being honest. I heard that there’s a Tang Yinxuan now. Why? Is there another flower fairy now?”

“Now that the eight cauldrons have appeared in the world and there’s an ultimate beauty chart, are you going to cover all the ultimate beauty charts?”

At this moment, Shu Qing’s voice rang beside his ear. Following that, Wang Xian felt the muscles on his waist trembling.

“Ahem, how can that be? I definitely don’t have any intentions!”

Wang Xian shook his head bitterly. He was indeed not interested in the other beauties at the moment. He was already satisfied with Shu Qing, Lan Qingyue, and the other girls.

“If I believe in you, even a sow can climb a tree!”

Guan Shu Qing rolled her eyes at him.

“Heaven and earth can witness it!”

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian said helplessly as he turned around and spoke to flower fairy.

“Yes, yes!”

Flower fairy nodded immediately and immediately informed her fellow disciples.

“Dragon King!”

“Dragon King!”

A group of natural born celestial sect disciples greeted Wang Xian respectfully when they saw him.

Among them was the eldest senior brother of natural born celestial sect, who was also the strongest disciple.

He was in his forties and possessed the strength of the infant stage. The rest of the disciples were at least in the Dan stage. There were more than 30 of them in total!

They were filled with respect for the dragon king in front of them.

In the past, they did not know about the Dragon King of the Dragon sect and had never heard of him. In the past few days, the natural born celestial sect had also carried out a mission for Wang Xian.

This investigation naturally cleared up all of Wang Xian’s past and experiences.

A middle-level immortal in his twenties. This made many people feel incredulous and incredulous.

In addition to his means and strength in the martial arts world, they were filled with awe towards this king who had emerged from the martial arts world.

“Why are there so many people?”

Wang Xian swept his gaze across them and asked with slight curiosity.

“Reporting to Dragon King, it’s mainly for the earth star fish. A small earth star fish can increase one’s lifespan by three to five years. It can be comparable to a grade-6 elixir. Now, many people have gathered in the mysterious sea!”

The eldest senior brother of the natural born celestial sect said respectfully.

“Okay.”

Wang Xian nodded. Items that could increase one’s lifespan were very precious to martial artists. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

In fact, to many people, lifespan was priceless.

The appearance of such fish in the mysterious sea would naturally attract all martial artists in the martial arts world.

“Dragon King, take the airship of our natural born celestial sect!”

Flower Fairy said to Wang Xian.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded his head.

An airship was a type of flying device created by the puppet celestial sect. Its speed was even faster than an airplane and was comparable to the flying speed of an infant stage powerhouse.

An airship could carry a few hundred people. Almost all the celestial sects would purchase airships from the puppet celestial sect.

Following that, they came to an open space. An airship that was more than ten meters in size and seven to eight meters in width was located in the middle.

“Martial arts is really magical. The appearance of the eight cauldron world has changed the world a lot!”

Wang Xian looked at the airship that only existed in novels with a slight sigh.

“Ignorant!”

A slightly disdainful voice came from the side. Wang Xian turned his head and looked at Guan Shuqing, who was emitting flames between her brows. He shook his head slowly.

Not only did this Phoenix take over his wife’s body, she also had a rather bad temper.

It was just that she and Shu Qing would exercise for one or two hours every night. Sometimes, her soul would come out.

Who asked you to take over Shu Qing’s body.

And the Empress? Didn’t she enjoy it back then!

Wang Xian looked at her with a strange expression. He didn’t know what the so-called empress really looked like.

The airship took off. There was a disciple driving in front of them. They flew quickly toward the mysterious sea.

The Mysterious Sea was located in Ji Ding’s territory, and Ji Ding had three immortal sects.

Ji Clan, Thunder clan, and Wind Smoke Immortal sect.

The Wind Smoke Immortal sect was the one that attracted the most attention. It was an immortal sect that was made up entirely of women. Cheng Qingcheng, who was ranked first on the list of Top Beauties, was the most outstanding disciple of the Wind Smoke Immortal sect.

“We’re here. The mysterious sea is in front of us. At present, the mysterious sea has been occupied by the disciples of the immortal sects!”

The airship arrived at the bottom of the mysterious sea, and a dark blue and somewhat black seabed appeared in their line of sight.

Black was not the color of water, but the color of an abyss.

It was said that the mysterious sea was connected to the underground sea, and its depth could reach tens of thousands of meters or even hundreds of thousands of meters. It was a real abyss.

Because of the bottomless abyss, the water looked black.

In the mysterious sea, there were some unique aquatic plants that made the entire sea look very strange.

Wang Xian contacted Tang Yinxuan in advance.

“Dragon King!”

The airship had just stopped in an empty space when a drakonid who was protecting Tang Yinxuan rushed over and shouted at Wang Xian.

“HMM, where is Tang Yinxuan?”

Wang Xian asked him.

“Miss Tang is conducting an experiment. Miss Tang said that you should head over as soon as possible!”

The drakonid said to Wang Xian.

“Experiment?”

“Let’s go and take a look!”

Wang Xian revealed a curious expression. He took a glance at Feng Luan who was still occupying her physical body. After informing the people from the innate immortal sect, he flew towards the mysterious sea.

The disciples from the innate immortal sect did not follow him. Instead, they flew towards the other direction of the mysterious sea!
