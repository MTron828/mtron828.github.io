Chapter 1300: 1301 collided

“This... This is crazy. What is the relationship between Ren Xingchen and that young man? He actually bowed directly to that young man, and even pointed his greatsword at Tang Ling ‘er and the others!”

“Who knows? Looking at the situation, it’s completely a head-on clash. Ren Xingchen is a Peerless Heaven’s pride, and there aren’t many heaven’s pride experts who can compare to him. The few heaven’s pride experts behind Princess Tang Ling ‘er are completely unqualified to compare to him!”

“The most important thing is his identity. Heaven’s sword sect. A core disciple of Heaven’s sword sect had a conflict with the princess of the blood flow empire? What is he trying to do?”

“For a young man, first it was the second Prince of the Light Dragon Empire, Long Xiaotian, then the mentor of the Divine Wind Academy, Zhang Fengying, and now it’s the Peerless Heaven’s favorite of Heaven’s sword sect, Ren Xingchen. This...”

Everyone looked at Ren Xingchen who was standing beside Wang Xian in a daze.

Such a peerless prodigy actually offended Tang Ling ‘er of the bloodshed empire for a young man.

Regardless of the reason, Ren Xingchen was indeed qualified to confront Tang Ling ‘er head-on.

With the current strength of the Heaven Sword sect, even the bloodshed empire was fearful of them.

Ren Xingchen, the core disciple of the Heaven Sword sect, was not inferior to the princess of the bloodshed empire in terms of status.

In fact, he was even slightly stronger, because Ren Xingchen’s future was not something Tang Ling ‘er could compare to.

And the blood flow empire had hundreds of princes and princesses.

“Ren Xingchen, you... you have to stand up for this guy!”

Tang Ling ‘er looked at Ren Xingchen’s clothes and her expression changed slightly. She stared at him and said with embarrassment.

“Tang Ling ‘er, watch your words. Just based on the group of trash behind you, if you want to deal with him, ask the sword in my hand whether it will agree or not!”

“If you don’t have the strength, then get lost!”

Ren Xingchen’s gaze was as cold as an ice-cold sword as he coldly said to them.

He didn’t give them any face at all.

He also had the strength to look down on Tang Ling ‘er and the group of Heaven’s pride experts.

The elites standing behind Tang Ling ‘er looked at the domineering Ren Xingchen with an extremely ugly expression.

They opened their mouths, wanting to retort.

But in front of his powerful strength, they really didn’t dare.

Most importantly, the other party was a disciple of the heavenly sword sect. Today’s Heavenly Sword Lingyun gathering, all the forces in the Liuhai region came to congratulate him, including the blood flow empire. It was because of the breakthrough in the strength of the sect master of the Heavenly Sword sect.

The breakthrough in the strength of the sect master of the Heaven Sword sect had raised the status of the entire heaven sword sect’s disciples by a level.

In the past, they were on the same level as the Divine Wind Academy of the Light Dragon Empire. Now, they were no longer a match for the Heaven Sword sect.

“Hiss, the people who are defending that Wang Xian are all more overbearing and arrogant than the last one!”

“Yeah, that beauty just now didn’t give Tang Ling ‘er any face at all. If it weren’t for a few heaven’s favorites coming over, Tang Ling ‘er would have lost face. Now that Ren Xingchen is here, he’s not giving them any face at all!”

“A conflict between a disciple of the sky sword sect and the Princess of the blood flow empire. This... this won’t cause an even bigger dispute, right?”

When the surrounding people saw this scene, they sucked in a breath of cold air.

What happened today was really out of everyone’s expectations.

First, it was the competition between the princes of the Light Dragon Dynasty, then Jiang Chuan’s participation, and finally, it involved the two top forces in the Liuhai region.

Everyone present could only watch silently.

The reason for all of this came from a girl.

“Come, Let’s Go!”

“Manager Qian, we’ll Go First!”

At the side, Tang Feng and Tang Yuan had solemn expressions on their faces when they saw Ren Xingchen suddenly appear.

They spoke to manager Qian and walked straight towards Tang Ling ‘er.

“As guests of Your Heavenly Sword Sect, is this how you treat your guests?”

Tang Feng and Tang Yuan walked over and looked coldly at Ren Xingchen, who was holding a large sword in his hand.

“Two princes!”

“This time, the matter has blown up!”

When some people saw them walking over, their eyes sparkled as they quietly stood at the side and watched.

“You also know that this is the heavenly sword sect’s territory. You’re the ones who directly threatened our friends here. You’re the ones who were unreasonable in the first place. How can there be guests like you?”

When Ren Xingchen saw Tang Feng and Tang Yuan walking over, his face didn’t have the slightest fluctuation.

“If he didn’t dare to humiliate my subordinates, would I have caused trouble for him?”

Tang Ling ‘er stared at Ren Xingchen with a somewhat embarrassed expression as she coldly said.

“You don’t even know the truth of the matter, yet you’re listening to her one-sided story. You’re really stupid!”

Zhang Fengying looked at Tang Ling ‘er and said disdainfully.

“You...”

Tang Ling ‘er stared at Zhang Fengying, her eyes filled with killing intent.

“Ren Xingchen, I don’t know what relationship that Kid has with you, but you’re not giving face to our bloodshed empire. Aren’t you being too arrogant? !”

Tang Feng narrowed his eyes slightly and stared coldly at Ren Xingchen.

“Ling Jian ‘ER is here!”

“Some disciples of the Heavenly Sword sect and Ling Jian ‘Er are here!”

“Look at Ling Jian ‘ER. Oh My God, she’s so beautiful, so beautiful!”

“Yeah, she’s simply too beautiful. In the past, Ling Jian ‘er basically wore that white shirt. Now, Wow, it’s pink. Oh My God, she’s simply too beautiful!”

“This... Goddess, in the past, when Ling Jian ‘er wasn’t dressed up, there weren’t many people who could compare to her. Now that she’s slightly dressed up, she’s even more beautiful!”

“Look at the disposition of Goddess Ling Jian ‘er. She seems to have undergone a huge change. In the past, she was incomparably cold. Now, she looks a little sweet!”

Right at this moment, sounds of exclamations could be heard from outside.

Tang Feng, Tang Yuan, and the others who were standing in the middle were slightly taken aback.

As for the dispute, everyone stopped.

Everyone looked outside, and when they saw the beauty in the pink dress, they were all stunned.

A pink dress!

A little makeup!

She looked incomparably exquisite, and her perfect figure caused the eyes of all the men present to light up slightly.

Even the girls present felt a little ashamed of their inferiority when they looked at Ling Jian ‘er. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

However, what surprised everyone was that Ling Jian ‘er actually wore a pink dress.

This was a huge difference from their impression of the ice-cold woman.

“Ling Jian ‘ER has changed so much, to actually wear a pink dress and look much more cheerful. It should be because of his father!”

“It should be. A true goddess. With Ling Jian ‘ER’s current status, even a prince of the blood flow empire can’t compare to her, right?”

“Unless it’s a prince who has inherited the throne, he can’t compare to her. The rest are all inferior!”

Everyone’s gaze was attracted over.

As they looked at Ling Jian ‘er, each of their faces revealed an astonished expression.

This goddess was the true second generation of the flowing sea region.

Not long ago, her father directly killed several profound void martial experts of the vast empire and killed the prince who was attacking her.
