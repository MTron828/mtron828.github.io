Chapter 893: Congratulations to death

Translator: 549690339

“I, Wang Xian, don’t run away from Shenghai town with my tail between my legs!”

“If I want to leave, I have to do it openly!”

When Wang Xian’s voice rang out at the city gate, the people gathered around were slightly stunned. Then, they took a deep breath.

He had guts!

He was not as strong as Wang Xian, yet he dared to come back after escaping. Furthermore, he was so arrogant. It had to be said that this kid had guts.

“Wang Xian!”

When the deputy leader of the Squawk Shark and the rest saw Wang Xian’s calm expression, they revealed a gloomy expression.

However, they soon revealed a ferocious smile on their faces.

“Very good. Since you dare to come back, Haha. Kid, you really have guts. Let me see how you will walk out of Shenghai town openly in the future!”

“However!”

The deputy leader of the Dogfish tribe said as he stared at Wang Xian ferociously. “However, if you want to walk out of Shenghai Town, you have to step over my corpse. I don’t know if you have the ability to do so.”

“If you don’t, Hehe, I will dismember your corpse into pieces and the corpses of everyone around you!”

As he spoke, a bloodthirsty look appeared in his eyes.

Bei Qianjun and Qing Guya, who were at the side, also stared at Wang Xian with a cold expression as they scanned the people behind him.

“Hehe, you actually brought people here. How interesting!”

Everyone glanced at Ao Jian and the rest as they said coldly.

“Then I shall wait and See!”

Wang Xian walked forward with a cold expression.

“You are really arrogant. However, I like to kill arrogant people!”

The vice leader of the squalid sharks stared coldly at their departing figures.

Everyone looked at Wang Xian and the rest with astonishment on their faces.

“He brought ten people with him, but the strongest one is only at level three of the extraordinary realm?”

“Although their strength is not bad, they are no match for the squalid sharks mercenary group, Bei Qianjun, and Qing Guya!”

“This young man has so many subordinates. which village does he belong to? It’s a pity that he has some problems with his brain.”

Everyone was discussing in a low voice.

Wang Xian ignored the discussions of the people around him. He looked at the DRAKONID and ordered, “All of you, go buy a place to stay. Also, buy a communication stone plate!”

Now that there were many people, they needed a place to stay.

In addition, the communication stone plate was the most important thing.

The communication stone plate was similar to the computers on Earth. It was similar to the mission stone plate and was made with an array formation.

Through the communication stone plate, words could be transmitted on the stone plate.

It could establish a separate communication channel.

The undercurrent assassin organization received missions through the communication stone plate.

Since Wang Xian wanted to establish an assassin organization, he could use the same method.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

The two DRAKONIDS nodded immediately. Wang Xian gave them 500,000 low-grade spiritual stones.

500,000 low-grade spiritual stones was enough to buy a small house and a communication stone plate.

Two hours later, Wang Xian and the rest arrived at a small courtyard.

The location was indeed remote and there were only three rooms. It was very cold.

However, Wang Xian did not mind it. He walked into the courtyard and looked at the group of drakonids and members of the Dragon Palace.

One by one, strange demons appeared and stood there quietly.

They were not powerful, but they were not weak either.

“Long Yi, the ten of you should investigate the whereabouts and whereabouts of all the members of the squalid shark mercenary group!”

Wang Xian looked at them and ordered.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

The ten of them nodded immediately.

“Ao Yao, there must be someone around us monitoring us. Send someone to kill them. Be careful. Don’t be discovered!”

“That’s right!”

As Wang Xian spoke, he took out pieces of red paper from his interspatial ring with a smile on his face.

The paper was made on Earth. It didn’t exist on the transcendence continent.

The red paper was cut into words with the words ‘Congratulations’written on it.

“After killing them, take away their bodies and place this paper at the spot where they died!”

The corner of his mouth curled up slightly as he spoke angrily to Ao Yao.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Ao Yao nodded as his eyes sparkled.

“Today, I will establish the strongest assassin organization in the transcendence continent, the dragon spike. I hope that your strange demon clan will not disappoint me!”

Wang Xian looked at Ao Yao and said slowly.

“Don’t worry, Dragon King. No one can escape our assassination!”

Ao Yao’s eyes sparkled with a cold killing intent as he said with fighting spirit.

“Alright, let’s get rid of the people around us first. I want the dragon spike to shake the entire Holy Sea Town!”

Wang Xian’s eyes shone with a fiery glow.

“Yes!”

Ao Yao nodded.

“Be careful!”

Wang Xian reminded her.

“Dragon King, don’t worry. I have broken through to level-three extraordinary and obtained two more supernatural powers!”

Ao Yao’s face revealed a confident expression.

Ao Yao, who was at the first level of extraordinariness, had comprehended the divine ability of nothingness and turned into nothingness for a short period of time. He was extremely terrifying during an assassination attempt.

He, who had obtained two more divine abilities, was even more terrifying.

“Okay!”

Wang Xian nodded his head slowly.

Ao Yao bowed to him and beckoned to the three strange demons.

In an instant, the three strange demons disappeared.

As the strongest dragon seed dragon spike in the Dragon Palace, it could assassinate assassins who were at the peak of the universe.

Even though it was only a half-finished product, it still had a terrifying ability that was difficult to understand in the supernatural continent.

The three strange demons disappeared and walked out of the door, scanning their surroundings.

Ever since the Dragon Palace dominated Earth, all the resources on Earth were used by the Dragon Palace.

The ones who benefited the most were the civil officials in the Dragon Palace. They had all the information on Earth. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Among them, there were assassination techniques.

After they had learned them, they had analyzed them and taught them to the strange demons.

All the strange demons had mastered things that were far beyond the imagination of ordinary people.

Three Strange Demons stood openly at the door of the room.

They scanned their surroundings.

Here, in a remote part of the holy sea town, it could be considered a slum area. There were not many people around, and all of them were old people resting at the door of their homes.

Among them, two middle-aged men were sitting on the left and right respectively. One of them was talking to an old man.

One of them was sitting at the entrance of a house. They were looking at the room where Wang Xian and the rest were.

“Pa!”

“This young man is not as simple as I thought. Yesterday, the three brothers disappeared without a sound. You have to be careful!”

A middle-aged man who was sitting alone at the door lit up a special cigarette from the extraordinary continent. He narrowed his eyes and muttered softly, his heart filled with vigilance!

“Pu!”

However, just as the middle-aged man finished speaking, he felt a slight pain in his neck.

“Cough Cough!”

His eyes widened in disbelief!

At this moment, he suddenly saw his other companion, the brother who was conversing with the old man, suddenly flash with a white light behind him. Then, his body fell to the ground.

“How... Is it possible?”
