2706 2706 parasite race, under the poison

“Leader, this young man in front of us seems to be the young master of the night race.”

The poison leader looked at young emperor Ye and said respectfully.

The night race occupied more than half of the Night Cold Island. The ancestor of the night race, Ye Leng, was once a void God emperor expert that shook the entire Emperor Star area.

Even after he died, the night race was still extremely powerful.

This was the junction between the central region of the imperial court and Night Cold Island. This hero gathering naturally had experts from night cold island.

The young master of the night race could be said to be the second generation with the most power in the entire Emperor Star area.

Even the status of the imperial court’s Emperor’s daughter might not be as high as young Emperor Ye’s.

After all, his father and grandfather, as well as an ancestor, were all peak undying Emperor Warriors.

In addition, the relationship between the Emperor’s family and the Ye clan was pretty good.

Some of the Emperor’s God kings were also very polite to young emperor Ye.

“Follow me, follow me in battle, I will use the emperor star field recruitment ceremony to treat you. In the future, if you feel that it’s not enough, you can leave.”

Ye Shaohuang said to the leader of the venom.

“It is our honor to follow Young Master Ye.”

When the leader of the venom heard ye Shaohuang’s words, he felt relieved. He immediately said respectfully.

“Hehe, good, good!”

Ye Shaohuang narrowed his eyes slightly. The corners of his mouth curled up slightly as he looked at Wang Xian who was beside him.

Wang Xian smiled contemptuously and ignored him. He walked straight to the special venom at the back.

“HMM?”

The venom was looking at the surrounding venom warily. When it saw Wang Xian coming over, it shrank back slightly and stared at him.

“Are you interested in following me?”

Wang Xian raised his hand slowly and landed it on his shoulder.

When the special venom saw Wang Xian’s palm, it instinctively dodged to the back. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

However, the palm still landed on his body. A vast and majestic voice entered his mind, causing his heart to tremble slightly.

A look of fear appeared on his face.

“I can help you solve your physical problems.”

Wang Xian looked at him and his voice entered his mind once again.

“You Can...”

He opened his mouth. His face was slightly ferocious, but his eyes were filled with excitement and excitement.

“As long as you can solve my physical problems, I’m willing to follow you. I’m willing.”

The Strange Venom quickly bowed to Wang Xian.

Obviously, his strange body had brought him great trouble.

“Alright, Follow Me!”

Wang Xian smiled.

“Yes, yes, yes, sir!”

He nodded immediately.

“Huh? Stop!”

At the front, Young Emperor Ye was stunned and cold when he saw Wang Xian taking away one of the venom. He immediately shouted.

“Young Master Ye, if he wants to take that trash away, let him take him away. It would be better if this trash left. It would save us a lot of trouble.”

The leader of the poisonous liquid saw this scene and said to young Emperor Ye.

“Young master, Poison Nine is a pure trash. The toxins in his body are messy. Sometimes, he can’t even control himself and his brain isn’t working properly. It would be better if he left.”

A poison at the side echoed with a smile.

“Even if he’s a trash, he’s still one of your poison’s people. Since I’ve recruited him, then we have to do it together. We Can’t lose a single one.”

When young emperor ye heard their words, there wasn’t the slightest fluctuation.

He wanted to recruit this group of poison because he wanted to give a warning to a person. He didn’t really want to recruit this group of poison.

That poison was trash, he didn’t care, what he cared about was to let that guy know his power.

He wanted to make him back down.

“Yes Yes, since young master ye has said it, let him follow.”

The poison leader immediately nodded, the strongest amongst them was only undying emperor level 4, naturally they wanted to get on the night clan’s young master’s list.

“Poison Nine, hurry back and follow young master ye with us. It’s Your Honor for Young Master Ye to take you in.”

The leader looked at poison nine and shouted coldly.

“I...”

Poison Nine’s expression changed slightly when he heard the leader’s words.

“If you want to follow me, ignore them.”

...

Wang Xian looked at poison nine and said.

“Sir, I want to follow you. I want you to help me solve my physical problems.”

Poison nine clenched his fist and said in a low voice.

“Alright, follow me. You will be fine.”

Wang Xian nodded his head faintly.

“Poison Nine, why are you still standing there? Get over here.”

Seeing that poison nine didn’t pay attention to him, the leader of the poison tribe shouted sternly with a gloomy expression.

“Shut up. If he follows me in the future, it has nothing to do with your poison clan.”

Wang Xian looked at the leader and said faintly.

“Poison Nine is a member of our poison clan. I don’t think it’s appropriate for you to behave like this.”

When the leader heard Wang Xian’s words, his expression changed as he said in a deep voice.

...

“There’s nothing wrong with it. Poison nine volunteered.”

Wang Xian said expressionlessly.

“You dare to snatch the person whom I, Young Emperor Ye, recruited?”

When young emperor ye saw that Wang Xian was determined to take away the strange poisonous liquid, he narrowed his eyes slightly and took a step forward.

“Hehe, let’s go.”

Wang Xian looked at him with disdain and said to poison nine who was beside him.

Poison nine nodded and followed behind.

“Snatch someone? Stop Him for me.”

When young emperor ye saw that Wang Xian didn’t care about him at all, his face turned cold and he shouted in a deep voice.

“Poison nine, stop right there.”

The leader of the poison and the group of poison immediately took a few steps forward. They stared at poison nine and shouted coldly.

Boom

Wang Xian swept a glance at them and a wave of power directly covered their bodies.

The expressions of the leader and the rest changed as they found it difficult to breathe.

“Young master, he is an expert.”

Behind Young Emperor Ye, the two middle-aged men’s expressions changed as they spoke in a deep voice.

“Expert? Hehe, he dares to snatch people from the imperial court. He is courting death. Stop Him.”

He looked at Wang Xian and his expression changed slightly as he spoke coldly.

Boom Boom

The two middle-aged men moved and appeared in front of Wang Xian in an instant. They stared at him coldly.

“Return the men of our young master immediately. Otherwise, don’t blame us for being rude.”

One of the middle-aged men locked onto Wang Xian and spoke in a sinister tone.

Du Jiu, who was standing at the side, saw this scene and his expression changed drastically. He stood back in fear.

“Eh? What Happened?”

“What is this for? Someone dares to cause trouble here. How many lives does he have?”

“What’s going on? Eh, that seems to be an expert from the night race. That is? The young master of the night race.”

At this moment, the commotion on Wang Xian’s side attracted the attention of many experts around them.

Their side belonged to the central region. Ninety percent of the people around them were godly monarchs. There were experts here who erupted with a dense aura. Everyone around them could sense it.

Some people looked over, their faces filled with astonishment.
