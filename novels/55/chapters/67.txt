Chapter 68: A Dragon or A Worm?

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

Early in the morning, a figure flew out of the seas. That’s right, it flew out like a deity.

Naturally, the word “flew” might be exaggerating. Nonetheless, Wang Xian was able to jump over ten meters in a single leap.

Since his level had increased to Level Six, his body had integrated the Five Elements Source Stone and had 5 elemental attributes of metal, wood, water, fire and earth in his body, Wang Xian’s strength was a hundred times stronger.

With a flick of his finger, a spark appeared within his hand. Moving it again, it was a metal dagger this time. Subsequently, there was a fireball, a block of earth and a piece of wood.

However, what Wang Xian found the most interesting was that he could grow beautiful flowers on his palm with just a thought.

This was the strength of the five elements and showed why the Five Elements Divine Dragon was the most horrifying.

Wang Xian retracted his aura with a face of smiles and walked to his heavy-duty motorcycle. He rode it and headed towards First-grade Restaurant.

When he reached First-grade Restaurant, it was already 9.30 a.m. and Guan Shuqing had arrived.

“Xiao Xian, have you eaten?” Guan Shuqing looked at Wang Xian with loving eyes and asked sweetly.

Despite being upset by her father’s actions during the banquet, she felt fortunate to have Wang Xian with her all along.

Currently, her family would likely rise again with the Qin Family providing assistance. Moreover, her family would grow to be even stronger than before.

Her parents were exhilarated and wanted her to grab hold of the opportunity to become Wang Xian’s girlfriend.

Although this made her speechless, she was secretly happy about it as her parents were no longer against her being together with Wang Xian.

“I haven’t. Have you eaten? Wanna head out to grab some food?” Wang Xian smiled and asked.

“I have already eaten. You could go by yourself.” Guan Shuqing looked at him and smiled.

Wang Xian nodded his head and headed out.

The traffic on the old street was huge. Even though it was a morning in the summer, there were still quite a number of pedestrians in the surrounding area.

Wang Xian looked around before heading towards a breakfast shop.

“Longxuan Restaurant will be opening in five days! Sir, please come and take a look.”

At this moment, a girl walked to him with a flyer and handed it to him.

Longxuan Restaurant?

He took the flyer from the girl’s hand inquisitively and took a look.

Longxuan Restaurant will be opening in five days. On the day of the opening, everything will be sold at 50% of the original price. Subsequently, it will be 60% on the second day, 70% on the third day, 80% on the fourth day and 90% of on the fifth day.

Longxuan Restaurant mainly sells all kinds of seafood and definitely has more variety than First-grade Restaurant. We have all kinds of valuable and precious seafood.

At that time, we will be selling Two-headed abalone, Atlantic Bluefin Marlin sashimi, delicious caviar and Australian lobsters.

We welcome all guests to visit and taste our exquisite and delicious seafood. We would also be giving out attractive prizes!

Wang Xian looked at the advertisement flyer in his hand before lifting his head to look at Longxuan Restaurant which was just a short distance away.

At this moment, the renovation of Longxuan Restaurant was complete. Looking at its exterior, it wasn’t inferior to First-grade Restaurant at all. In fact, it looked a little more luxurious, as it was a newly renovated restaurant after all.

Everything at half price on opening day five days later? Claiming to have a wider variety of seafood than First-grade Restaurant?

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered and a faint cold smirk appeared on his face.

“Eh, isn’t this our Director Wang? What’s the matter? Coming to learn more about your competitor?” At this moment, a teasing voice sounded from beside him.

He turned his head over and saw a young man followed by three other guys. The lips of the young man curved into a smile when he saw Wang Xian holding onto the advertisement flyer.

Wang Xian looked at the young man and gave a cold smirk. “I don’t have to resort to finding more about your restaurant. My First-grade Restaurant has never been afraid of anyone!” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Haha, great. Director Wang is really confident!” The young man looked at Wang Xian and smiled. His expression turned heavy as he continued, “However, I wonder if Director Wang could stay as composed when his restaurant goes bankrupt.”

“Bankrupt? That’s interesting. Let us wait and see who will be the first to declare bankruptcy.” Wang Xian smiled and looked at them.

“Let’s wait and see then! At that time, I’ll let you know the strength of our Longxuan Restaurant.” The young man gave a cold smile. “If you go bankrupt, I’ll buy it from you for cheap!”

“Arrogant!” Wang Xian looked at the young man and said in an emotionless tone.

“Lad, you are still lacking a lot in comparison with my brother. As to what you are capable of, we have already investigated thoroughly. This time, we would hand you a complete defeat.”

At this moment, the teenager beside the young man lifted his head and spoke to Wang Xian in a condescending manner.

“My capabilities? It seems like you guys have been investigating me?” Wang Xian’s face sank.

“Hehe. Know your enemy and you will not be defeated in a hundred battles! You are just a lucky brat. After this experience, you will be left with nothing,” the young man said coldly.

“Sure,” Wang Xian sneered. “In that case, I’d like to see who will be the one who is left with nothing!”

Tsk!

The young man sneered and headed out.

“Brother, this time we will teach this brat a good lesson and let him know the consequences of going against our Longxuan Restaurant!” the teenager said to the young man.

“In five days’ time, he will be crying over this. Our Longxuan Restaurant’s branch in this city is coming to this town like a hurricane and will triumph over the local First-grade Restaurant regardless of how strong it might be. Furthermore, he is just a worm after all.”

The young man revealed a confident look.

If he wasn’t capable, he wouldn’t have come to the area to set up his restaurant. In his eyes, the First-grade Restaurant was just a worm.

“Haha, that’s right big brother. In five days’ time, we will know who’s the dragon and who’s the worm!” The teenager laughed excitedly.

Longxuan Restaurant!

Wang Xian looked at them as they left before looking at Longxuan Restaurant once again. He smirked coldly and mumbled, “You guys dare to claim to be Longxuan Restaurant? Claiming to be a ‘Dragon?’” [1]

In five days’ time? Wang Xian smiled and threw the advertisement into the rubbish bin.

“Director Wang!”

When he returned to First-grade Restaurant after finishing his breakfast, Manager Huang walked to him, looking flustered. In his hand was an advertisement flyer.

“What’s the matter?” Wang Xian saw his flustered look and asked.

“Director Wang, Longxuan Restaurant has just started a strong and massive advertisement campaign by giving out flyers and employing the media at the same time. Their reach is really wide!” Manager Huang replied in a hurry and passed the flyer to Wang Xian. “This was a flyer that I received from them.”

“I knew about this.” Wang Xian smiled and shook his head upon seeing the flyer.

“Director Wang, you knew about this?” Manager Huang was a little shocked but quickly added, “Director Wang, we need to get prepared. Longxuan Restaurant is a famous restaurant in the nearby city and they have strong capabilities. Moreover, their boss is a distant sea fishing group and has supplies with a range of top-quality ingredients. Please take a look at the menu that they are advertising.”

“Relax! I have thought of how to handle this. As for now, the operations of First-grade Restaurant shall remain the same as before. It’s just a Longxuan Restaurant. I’ll make them close their shop quickly!” Wang Xian said plainly.

“Director Wang, you are confident?” Manager Huang asked again, feeling a little doubtful.

“Just go and do what you have to do.”

Wang Xian looked at him and smiled mysteriously.

He had not brought over the large lobsters from the chaotic reef areas and the abalones from under the island. This was because the time wasn’t right yet.

There were five more days and this was ample time for him to make some preparations
