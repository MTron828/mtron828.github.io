Chapter 3175: 3174 Heavenly Sea Dragon Palace

“Let’s go to the Longming Continent.”

Wang Xian and the willow deity walked out of the teleporter on a planet.

He looked at the route on the universal AI and spoke immediately.

“Dragon King, there’s still a month before the opening of the Dragon Palace.”

The willow deity spoke.

“Yes, there’s still a month. However, this is our first time here. We need to check out the situation here.”

“Let’s go and see what the Dragon Palace is like!”

Wang Xian said.

Wang Xian was filled with curiosity about a powerful dragon palace.

How was this dragon palace different from the one created by the system?

Did It have the same powerful functions as the system that created the Dragon Palace?

With this thought in mind, they flew quickly toward the Longming continent.

The Longming continent was located in the east of this starry sky.

This wasn’t Wang Xian’s first time in this starry sky, but he didn’t stay here for long.

There were many more powerhouses here than in the Milky Way.

There were even powerful primary races in the universe that could wipe out all the forces in the Milky Way.

After traveling through the starry sky for two hours, a huge continent appeared in his line of sight.

Wang Xian looked over and narrowed his eyes slightly.

This was a continent that was more than ten times bigger than the silver gazing continent.

At this moment, in the surrounding void, one could see many figures flying over.

Some of the figures were incomparably huge bird-type demonic beasts.

Some of them were demonic beasts that were like rhinoceroses that were soaring in the clouds.

There were also demonic beasts that were galloping in the void like cheetahs.

There were all kinds of demonic beasts that were emitting a powerful murderous aura.

There were also demonic beasts that were flying in human form.

One after another, demonic beasts were rushing towards the Longming continent from all directions.

Wang Xian swept his gaze across and discovered that many of the demonic beasts were very strong.

He could vaguely sense the strength of the demonic beasts at the supremacy level.

His gaze landed on the Longming continent in front of him.

The entire continent was verdant and lush. Basically, it was filled with towering trees.

“This Longming continent is not simple.”

The willow deity stared at this continent, her eyes shining.

Wang Xian nodded.

According to the information from the Dragon Palace, there were more than a dozen universe knight level demon beasts in the entire Longming continent.

There were even level 3 universe knight level demon beasts among them.

They lived here and coveted the Sky Sea Dragon Palace in the Sky Sea.

These demon beasts did not form a force together. Basically, they were acting on their own and waiting for opportunities.

“Let’s go. Let’s head straight to the Sky Sea.”

Wang Xian and the rest did not land on the ground. Instead, they continued to fly forward.

Half an hour later, an ocean appeared in their sight.

The Ocean was extremely huge. The water was not very deep. It was only a few tens of thousands of kilometers.

It was much shallower than the Milky Way.

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian and the rest moved and entered the ocean directly. They flew toward the center according to the address.

In the ocean, the number of demonic beasts was even more numerous. Their unified goal was to head forward and not interfere with each other.

Boom

At this moment, Wang Xian sensed a terrifying aura coming from the side. A demon beast that was like an octopus was emitting a powerful aura as it charged straight ahead.

The other demon beasts in the surroundings sensed the aura and revealed a respectful expression. They quickly hid to the side.

That was a universe knight-level demon.

“Every time the Sky Sea Dragon Palace opens, many demons from the surrounding starry skies will rush over. It’s said that during the last opening, more than 200 demons came.”

Wang Xian spoke, his eyes shining.

It wasn’t just the demons from this starry skies who would rush over. Other Demons from other starry skies would also rush over.

In this place, it was best to keep a low profile if one didn’t have the strength of a demon.

Even if it was a great demon at the first level of a universe knight, they should not be too arrogant.

That was because there were crouching tigers and hidden dragons here.

Wang Xian and the rest did not keep a high profile. They looked at the great demon flying over and sped up as well.

After flying for another half an hour, they sensed a powerful force coming from the front.

An incomparably huge palace stood in the deepest part of the Sky Sea.

The entire palace was tens of millions of kilometers in size. Apart from containing a terrifying force, the palace looked a little quaint.

It was somewhat sacred.

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly and looked at the Dragon Palace in front of him. There was a familiar feeling coming from his bloodline.

This was the Sky Sea Dragon Palace. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Right now, this Dragon Palace seemed to be in a deep sleep and didn’t seem to be lofty.

Facing them was the West Dragon Gate.

The West Dragon Gate looked similar to the Dragon Gate created by the system.

The entire Dragon Gate contained a mysterious energy.

Around the Dragon Gate, many humans and demonic beasts had already arrived. However, they didn’t dare to rashly barge into the Dragon Gate.

Before the Dragon Palace was opened, any rash action would cost one’s life.

As they approached the Tianhai Dragon Palace, Wang Xian and the willow deity sized it up carefully.

“It’s similar to the Dragon Palace built by the system, but there are some differences.”

Wang Xian sized it up and mumbled. He looked around and said, “Let’s go. Let’s take a look around the Dragon Palace.”

There was a gray energy floating in the sky above the Tianhai Dragon Palace, blocking everyone’s vision.

In the sky, that grey energy was filled with destructive power. No one dared to step into it rashly.

Wang Xian circled around the skysea Dragon Palace. Unfortunately, he could only see the periphery and could not see the specific situation inside.

“Eh?”

At this moment, he saw a demonic beast race in front of him. There were hundreds of them. They had huge wings but their bodies were like pythons. There was a single horn on their head.

From this demon beast race, he could feel a trace of the Divine Dragon Bloodline. It should belong to the Yalong.

However, it was possible that they had other bloodlines.

The leader of the Demon Beasts had the power of a level two universe knight. Some of the surrounding demon beasts didn’t dare to approach them.

“A Yalong with a trace of the Divine Dragon Bloodline. Of course, calling it a yalong might not be right. This is a powerful demon beast race.”

Wang Xian mumbled.

Among the hundreds of demon beasts, there were three other universe knights besides the leader.

“Looks like there are many powerful existences in the Sky Sea Dragon Palace this time.”

He thought to himself as he continued to circle around the Dragon Palace to investigate.

Boom Boom Boom

When he arrived at another location, the sound of battle suddenly came from the front.

He was slightly stunned. He saw a figure rushing towards him. The figure had the body of a human and the tail of a snake. The upper half of the figure was that of a woman while the lower half of the figure was that of a snake.

At this moment, her face was filled with horror as she fled forward.

“Hahaha, little female snake, you still want to escape?”

From the back, a powerful force came charging over.

This force was very familiar to Wang Xian. He looked over and saw a demonic beast that was similar to an octopus chasing after him.

“COO! Coo!”

A special sound came from her body and a poisonous fog enveloped the area ahead.
