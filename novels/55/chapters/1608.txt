Chapter 1609: 1609 world-shocking 2

“How is this possible? How is this possible? How can the mistress of the savage sea be the wife of a skyfiend?”

“Impossible, absolutely impossible. It must be an illusion!”

The Supreme Hierarch, Patriarch Fengchi, and everyone from the entire lone sect stared at this scene in disbelief.

They couldn’t believe it! They couldn’t believe it!

They had originally thought that the arrival of the wilderness goddess would help lone sect.

But now, the wilderness goddess was the wife of a skyfiend. Looking at the way they were in love, what would the consequences be?

Everyone could imagine it.

“Cough, cough. Oh My God, I thought the end of the Skyfiend was coming. Now...”

Everyone around was also watching in shock.

They had thought that the arrival of the wilderness goddess was the end of the Sky Demon.

However, they had never expected that the wilderness goddess was the woman of the Sky Demon.

Just now, they had been discussing which of the wilderness goddess’beasts was more powerful compared to the Sky Demon. It was widely believed that the beasts were more powerful.

However, looking at the ten-thousand-meter-long beast, it kept rubbing against the sky demon’s body as if it was trying to please it.

This F * ck, it felt as if the Sky Demon was the giant Beast’s father.

Thinking about it, it made sense. The Wilderness Goddess was the giant Beast’s master, a mother-like existence, and the Sky Demon was its father-like existence.

What was there to compare between a son and a father?

Thinking of this, the corners of everyone’s mouths couldn’t help but Twitch.

“I originally thought that Xiao Lan would return home after increasing her strength. I didn’t expect to meet Xiao Xian here!”

“Your injuries are very serious. Leave the rest to me. I left these two years because I didn’t want to drag you down. I wanted to fight alongside you!”

Lan qingyue leaned on Wang Xian’s body gently and said excitedly.

“The peerless battle in the vast region has turned into a scene where couples meet and show off their love. hehehe!”

At the side, Mo Sha was also looking at this scene with a stunned expression. On the contrary, he was in a very good mood as he exclaimed.

He didn’t expect boss Mo to be so awesome. Even the goddess of the wilderness was his wife.

He couldn’t help but admire her.

When the surrounding sects and Nanhuang Jianghe heard the words of the goddess of the wilderness, they revealed an embarrassed expression.

“I know the situation inside my body. Today, I will definitely be injured. Bring Ling Jian ‘er back to the Dragon Palace!”

Wang Xian said to Lan Qingyue.

“Lose my body?”

Lan Qingyue’s expression changed drastically. A terrifying killing intent was slowly emitted from her body. “Xiao Xian, I will help you kill them!”

“Hehe, killing one is enough!”

Wang Xian shook his head. With a wave of his arm, he pulled Ling Jian ‘er over from afar.

“Wang Xian!” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Looking at Wang Xian, Ling Jian ‘ER’s face was filled with worry. She wanted to reach out her hand, but after looking at Lan Qingyue, she still didn’t have the courage.

“Qingyue, protect her well!”

Wang Xian spoke to Lan Qingyue as he slowly looked at the supreme headmaster and Patriarch Fengchi in the sky.

“Qingyue, help me stop the supreme headmaster. I will kill another person!”

Wang Xian spoke in a deep voice with a face full of killing intent.

“It’s Xiao Xian. Don’t Worry!”

Lan qingyue nodded with a gloomy face. She could already sense Wang Xian’s determination.

She could also sense that the blood essence in his body was disappearing rapidly.

Even though she knew that Wang Xian could still be resurrected in the Dragon Palace, her heart was still filled with anger.

The aura of a powerhouse was completely released.

“Woo!”

Sensing the murderous aura of Wang Xian and Lan Qingyue, a savage aura spread out from Xiao Lan’s body.

“Haha, today, I, Wang Xian, will definitely lose my life in your sect. However, before I lose my life, I will also take one of you with me. I will also cause your sect to suffer heavy losses!”

“I will make you pay a heavy price for what you have done!”

Wang Xian stared at the supreme sect leader and elder Feng Chi. A maniacal smile appeared on his face as the killing intent from his body surged rapidly!

“Today, we will collect some interest. Soon, I, Lan Qingyue, will exterminate your sect!”

Lan Qingyue stood beside Wang Xian and shouted with a similarly cold gaze.

“Lunatic! This lunatic! He is a complete lunatic!”

When the supreme headmaster, elder Fengchi, and everyone from the sect heard what Wang Xian and Lan Qingyue said, their faces turned extremely ugly.

This was especially so for Wang Xian’s determination to die. Even if he was injured, he had to take one of them with him.

If he wasn’t a madman, he definitely wouldn’t do such a thing.

“The heavenly demon fruit has really used a taboo. Once it is used, one might die!”

“That should be the case. The heavenly demons are really crazy. They are completely risking their lives!”

“If the heavenly demons don’t die today, they will be the strongest force in the vast region in the future!”

Voices of discussion could be heard from the surroundings.

“Haha, Kill!”

At this moment, a wild voice filled with killing intent could be heard.

“Roar!”

Wang Xian immediately transformed into a 150-meter-long five elements divine dragon and attacked Patriarch Fengchi directly.

“Kill!”

Lan Qingyue grabbed Ling Jian ‘ER’s hand and roared furiously as well.

“Woo Woo Woo!”

A terrifying roar came out of Xiao Lan’s mouth.

Sensing its master’s fury, its huge body charged towards the supreme headmaster.

“Fengchi, be careful!”

The supreme headmaster looked at the Sky Demon and the barbarian goddess with an extremely embarrassed expression and roared loudly.

The battle erupted once again.

However, this time, it was a one-on-one battle.

“Great grinding of the five elements, annihilate!”

Wang Xian roared and locked onto Patriarch Fengchi completely.

Now that Patriarch Fengchi was injured, his strength was less than half.

Wang Xian was also injured. However, he was confident that he could kill Patriarch Fengchi before he was injured.

“Bastard, Bastard!”

Patriarch Fengchi looked at Wang Xian who was charging at him with a hint of fear in his eyes.

This skyfiend wanted to perish together with him.

However, he didn’t want to die!

Buzz

Streams of destructive energy swept past. Wang Xian’s body charged towards Patriarch Fengchi.

“Save me!”

When Patriarch Fengchi saw how desperate the Skyfiend was, he immediately fled into the distance and shouted at the supreme headmaster.

“Get lost!”

The supreme headmaster had no time to bother with Patriarch Fengchi. Looking at Xiao Lan who was charging towards him, he waved his arm.

Terrifying Wind Spears attacked Little Blue’s body.

The wind spears entered Little Blue’s body, but they only broke through a dozen meters deep.

Compared to its ten thousand meters long and two thousand meters wide body, this injury was negligible.

“What a terrifying defense. Even when I was at my peak, it was difficult to kill it!”

The supreme headmaster’s face darkened when he saw the wounds on Xiao Lan’s body.

“If you want to escape, stay here. bind him!”

Wang Xian’s cold voice came from the side. The Five Elements Millstone came to the sky above Patriarch Fengchi.

The strongest binding force of the five elements trapped him.

His body rushed over and grabbed at him with his sharp dragon claws.
