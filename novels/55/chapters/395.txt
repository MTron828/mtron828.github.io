Chapter 396: Skeletal Dragon

Grrrr, grrr!

A soft roar erupted from the Dragon Transformation Pool of the Dragon Palace.

The roar was sonorous and soft but easily propagated throughout the entire Dragon Palace.

“Argh! How did I become like this?”

At this moment, a shrieking scream sounded.

Within the Dragon Transformation Pool, Xiao Yu and Elder Fang stared at each before screaming.

Their bright eyes were filled with disbelief. After looking at each other, they looked at their own bodies.

Xiao Yu’s tears streamed down immediately.

Bones! She was covered in bones that appeared dullish black and glowed in a faint and dull light. Her body looked segmental and each segment was connected to razor-sharp thorny bones.

Her body was approximately five meters long and looked just like a terrifying mystical dragon forged with dullish gold metal.

They were a little different from ordinary divine dragons and had two wings that spanned approximately one meter to both sides of their body.

Although one could say these one-meter-long frames were wings, they were more ornamental than functional. Their dragon claws were entirely black and shimmered in a chilling black glow.

The black Skeletal Dragon didn’t appear to be evil at all. Instead, it carried with it a tinge of holiness.

Moreover, it looked incomparably domineering and majestic.

However, this was the conclusion one would get if one used the perspective of a guy. In the eyes of Xiao Yu and Elder Fang, they were just exceptionally grotesque monsters.

“Xiao Yu, Elder Fang!”

At this instant, Wang Xian, who had been in his room previously, came rushing towards the Dragon Transformation Pool after hearing the screams of Xiao Yu and Elder Fang.

“This...”

When he stood by the edge of the Dragon Transformation Pool, Wang Xian was dumbfounded to see Xiao Yu and Elder Fang’s current form in the Dragon Transformation Pool.

“Wuuuu! Big brother, I have turned into a monster! I have turned into a monster!” Xiao Yu cried out in fear. She moved and flew towards Wang Xian at astonishing speed.

Crack crack crack!

While flying, the sound of metal clashing was made. She looked domineering and majestic and was just like the Void Skeletal Dragon that existed in the records of mythology.

Wang Xian raised his arms and wrapped them around Xiao Yu’s huge head. On his face, he wore a bitter smile.

“Mutated divine dragon! Oh gosh! It’s a mutated divine dragon!”

“Xiao Xian, what’s a mutated divine dragon?”

At this moment, Guan Shuqing, Lan Qingyue and Sun Lingxiu, who had followed closely behind Wang Xian, looked at Xiao Yu in shock as they asked.

“Brother, I’m so ugly now. Sob, sob. Brother!”

Xiao Yu’s feminine voice came from the Skeletal Dragon. No matter how one looked at it, he would find this to be really weird.

“Hmm. Xiao Yu, don’t worry about it. Don’t worry about it. You can still regain your human form.”

Wang Xian comforted Xiao Yu as Elder Fang also flew towards him. Wang Xian looked at them, forced a smile and said, “This... For you all, this should be a blessing!”

“Wang... Miracle Doctor Wang! How could this be a blessing?” Elder Fang’s voice was trembling as she shook her head and stared at Wang Xian.

“From the perspective of a divine dragon, this is indeed a blessing!” Wang Xian smiled and nodded his head before continuing, “I don’t understand why you two have become Skeletal Dragons, but this is undoubtedly a blessing!”

“A Skeletal Dragon is a mutated divine dragon with devil attributes. It could also be called a mutated form of a devil dragon!”

“Divine dragons can be separated into nine different attributes of Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth, Light, Darkness, Wind and Thunder. However, there are still mutated attributes besides these nine attributes. Among which, there are Skeletal Dragons and Frosty Divine Dragons!”

“Based on the records of the Divine Dragon Transformation, mutated divine dragons are much stronger than ordinary divine dragons. In every ten thousand divine dragons, there might just be one. To become a mutated divine dragon is extremely difficult.”

“The reason why both of you have become Skeletal Dragons is likely to be due to those black dots of venom. My guess is that the Black Bone Venom isn’t a kind of poison. Instead, it’s an incredible treasure. It is just that when injected into ordinary humans, ordinary humans can’t withstand this form of energy and thus show symptoms of being poisoned!”

Wang Xian made his conjecture. Mutated Divine Dragons were rare occurrences within the divine dragon race. It was also extremely difficult to become one.

Now that Xiao Yu and Elder Fang had become Skeletal Dragons, it could be a huge blessing for them.

“Sob sob. Brother, I don’t want to become an ugly Skeletal Dragon like this. I don’t want to. I want to become other dragons!”

Xiao Yu shook her head unwillingly.

Seeing that huge skeletal head acting like a spoilt child was truly...

Wang Xian could only smile bitterly.

Xiao Yu had been full of anticipation and hope when she entered the Dragon Transformation Pool. She was still imagining herself becoming a beautiful Water Divine Dragon or the majestic Metal Divine Dragon or an Azure Dragon that could control Wood!

As for a Devil Dragon, she had never thought about it.

And yet, she had now turned into the mutated Skeletal Dragon, something she considered to be worse than the Devil Dragon.

“Change back into your human form! Change back to your human form!” Wang Xian smiled and comforted her.

Xiao Yu’s eyes were red from crying. Based on the transformation technique, she turned back into her human form with just a thought.

Wang Xian waved his arm and shielded her body. Elder Fang, who was by the side, also returned into her human form. Wang Xian couldn’t help but steal a few glances.

Her figure completely triumphed over Guan Shuqing and Lan Qingyue.

Huh?

“What are you looking at!”

The voices of Guan Shuqing and Lan Qingyue erupted from his side. Wang Xian immediately turned his head around. Waving his arm, he shielded Elder Fang’s body.

Elder Fang’s face was flushed. In her mind, the cultivation arts of the Skeletal Dragon surfaced.

Ka ka ka!

Sounds of metal clashing and rubbing came from her. Soon, Elder Fang was covered in black armor.

The battle armor had a black glow and completely covered her alluring figure. Her long hair rested behind her, making her look incomparably cold.

However, perhaps it was because Elder Fang’s figure was too exceptional. There was a different kind of charm emanating from her.

Xiao Yu saw the bone armor appearing on Elder Fang. With a thought, similar bone armor covered her body too. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

This bone armor was indeed part of the skeletal structure within their bodies. Moreover, it possessed incredible defensive strength.

“Isn’t this pretty good? Look at how stunning you are now!” Wang Xian smiled and commented as he looked at Xiao Yu.

Covered in bone armor, they looked just like powerful female warriors.

Xiao Yu looked at her own body and pouted. She was still feeling unsatisfied about it.

Although the bone armor in the human form was cool, turning into the dragon form was too grotesque!

“This... It’s better to just maintain the human form!”

Elder Fang showed a bitter smile. Feeling the incredible strength within her, she felt slightly relieved.

Elder Fang felt that these boundless powers were even greater than the Inborn Realm.

It should have been equivalent to the legendary Half-Step to Dan Realm.

“Acclimatize yourself with your own powers and show them to us!”

Wang Xian looked at Xiao Yu and continued, “Both of you have made huge leaps forward in the Dragon Transformation Pool. It isn’t about strength, but rather your bloodline.”

“The current Dragon Palace is just at the first level. Rationally speaking, it is only capable of breeding dragon species but not giving rise to divine dragons. Now that you all have become divine dragons, you could really call that a meteoric rise!” Wang Xian remarked joyously. He wondered what kind of venom was required to enable Xiao Yu and Elder Fang to transform into dragons directly.

He was thinking of visiting the Sacred Followers Guild when he had the time to see if they still had more of such venom!
