Chapter 730: We can’t afford to offend 0731. Let’s Retreat (8/20)

Translator: 549690339

Fengsha looked at the four people beside him with a slightly awkward expression. However, both of them looked at Wang Xian and Ao Jian with a twinkle in their eyes. Their eyes were filled with vigilance and fear.

Damn it, that’s right. It’s them. It’s definitely them.

When they recalled what happened more than a year ago, cold sweat appeared on their foreheads.

Seeing the young man staring at them with a mocking expression, the corners of their mouths could not help but Twitch!

“Brother Ming, brother Lu, we can’t afford to offend them. Let’s Retreat!”

Their expressions changed, and they gritted their teeth as they spoke to the four people beside them.

This caused the four immortal gods from the Ming Wang Immortal sect and the Puppet Immortal sect to be stunned, and their faces revealed astonishment.

“Can’t afford to offend them?”

A look of astonishment flashed in the eyes of the four people, followed by a slightly unpleasant expression.

“Brothers Wind Devil and Wind Fiend, just tell us the specific reason!”

An immortal God from the Ming Wang Immortal sect asked them with a twinkle in his eyes.

“Cough Cough, as you know, we come from the Yu Ding world. It’s the only world in the nine Ding world that doesn’t have a world!”

Wind Devil said to them with a dark expression.

“Oh?”

The four of them slowly nodded.

The world of Nine Cauldrons already had eight cauldrons. However, the world of Yu Ding was the only one that was missing. This made the immortal sects curious for a very long time.

However, because the world of Yu Ding was in the middle of the ocean and was too far away from the other cauldrons, the immortal sects didn’t know the exact reason.

Later, some disciples of the world of the cauldron of Yu ran out and said that their world of the cauldron of Yu was destroyed. At that time, it shocked all the immortal sects.

According to the descriptions of those disciples, some immortal god experts guessed that it might be a terrifying existence in the ocean, or it might be the work of a powerful god from the OU continent.

At this point, only eight cauldrons were left in the world of the Nine Cauldrons.

As for the four immortal gods from the Ming Wang Immortal sect and the puppet immortal sect, they knew more than others.

A year ago, when the Shun Ding world had just appeared, they had met Feng Mofeng sha and Feng Mofeng Sha by accident. The two of them had been living in their immortal sect ever since.

Later on, they became the honorary elders of their immortal sect.

“You’re saying that the one who destroyed the immortal gods of the Yu Ding world and prevented you from appearing was...”

A white shadow’s eyes flashed with a hint of shock as he couldn’t help but exclaim.

“That’s right, it’s him. We remember him clearly. He’s the Dragon King, and his strength is comparable to our sect master. The other one can turn into a terrifying biological sword!”

“Besides the two of them, there’s a creature that can hide in the void. He’s very terrifying, and if we’re not careful, he’ll directly ambush and Kill Us!”

“In addition, he also has an elder holding a turtle shell, a devil monkey that is emitting powerful devil qi, and a terrifying creature that is emitting lightning!”

Feng Mo and Feng Sha’s eyes were filled with fear as they said bitterly.

In the Ding Yu world, the two of them were the weakest. The two sect leaders had reached the middle-stage immortal realm, while young demon and Hong Ying were also at the peak of the lower-stage immortal realm. However, the two of them were assassinated without a sound.

In the eyes of the two elders, the Ming Wang Immortal sect and the puppet immortal sect were far weaker than their Ding Yu world.

At the very least, they didn’t have a mid-level immortal.

An expert who had destroyed their Ding Yu world could easily destroy the Shun Ding world, which was even weaker than their Ding Yu world.

What they were doing now was courting death.

“This...”

The four of them were completely stunned. Looking at the young man who stood there looking at them mockingly, they instantly felt their scalps go numb.

“No wonder they dared to wait here so arrogantly!”

In an instant, cold sweat appeared on the foreheads of the four of them.

Their strength was much weaker than Yu Ding world’s. If Wind Devil and Wind Fiend hadn’t joined, a middle-level immortal would have been able to contend against them.

Not to mention, apart from a middle-level immortal, he also had powerful subordinates.

Gulp

Everyone couldn’t help but gulp.

“What’s the matter? Are we going to fight or not?”

The corner of Wang Xian’s mouth curled up slightly as he asked them mockingly.

He didn’t expect to meet the two elders of Yu Ding here.

“Ahem, Dragon King, we don’t have any grudges that can’t be resolved. I think we should sit down and talk.”

Wind devil coughed and said to Wang Xian with a smile on his face.

The four immortals from the Mingwang Immortal sect and the puppet immortal sect stiffened and didn’t speak.

At this moment, they didn’t dare to speak.

The other party was able to destroy the world of Yu Ding, which was two to three times stronger than them. It would be a piece of cake for them to destroy the Mingwang Immortal sect and the puppet immortal sect.

As for the disciples of the immortal sect who were killed, they could just kill them. They could only blame themselves for seeking death.

After all, they were going to provoke an immortal god. The pressure of an immortal God should not be violated!

As for revenge, it was even more ridiculous.

It would be good if they could think of a way to not cause trouble for the other party.

Moreover, the lifespan of an immortal god was 500 years. They had seen many life-and-death departures. The overall situation was the most important and the immortal sect was the most important.

“Shall we sit down and talk?”

Wang Xian smiled and swept his gaze across the six of them.

This caused their expressions to tighten instantly.

“Sure, I’m not interested in fighting with you!”

Wang Xian nodded his head slowly. “Everyone, come over!”

He moved his body and entered the room directly.

The six of them looked at each other and withdrew their weapons before following him into the villa below.

“Please come in, everyone!”

Sun Lingxiu and Lan Qingyue poured a cup of tea with smiles on their faces when they saw the six immortals come in.

The six smiled and nodded with a strange look on their faces.

They were here to take revenge for the disciples of the immortal sect, and now they were sitting down to drink tea?

What the F * ck!

It could only be said that a man could bend and stretch!

“Hello, Dragon King!”

“Hehe, we’ll get to know each other if we don’t Fight!”

The few of them smiled and sat at the side.

“Let me introduce myself first. Dragon King of the Dragon Gate is studying in Jiang City. Please take good care of him in the future!”

Wang Xian smiled and gestured at them.

“No, no, no. Although Jiang city is located in our Shun Ding area, we will ask our disciples to leave immediately since you are here, Dragon King!”

An elder from the Mingwang Immortal sect said with a slightly ugly expression.

“There are only a few dozen disciples from our Dragon sect. It doesn’t matter if you are here or not, as long as you don’t Provoke Me!”

Wang Xian said plainly to them.

“Don’t worry. In the future, the disciples from the Mingwang Immortal sect and the puppet immortal sect will definitely not disturb you, Dragon King!”

“With your strength, Dragon King, we wouldn’t dare to Offend You!”

The two elders of the puppet immortal sect saw that Wang Xian was not a difficult person to talk to, but they still spoke bitterly. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“That’s good. I don’t want to be your enemy either. There are some things that I would like to trouble you with.”

Wang Xian smiled and nodded.

This time around, he did not come back to be a king like before. Instead, he had some other matters to deal with.
