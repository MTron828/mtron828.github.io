Translator: 549690339

The first day of the Prodigy tournament ended, and this tournament caused a huge commotion in the pugilistic world.

The pugilistic world website specially opened up a section for this tournament to be discussed by everyone.

And after the first day ended, the entire discussion section was in an uproar.

Especially now that the number of pugilistic world martial artists had reached over a hundred million, hundreds of posts were being sent out every second.

The disputes between the several great immortal sects were also going on here.

The immortal sects that didn’t have a good relationship with each other were attacking each other.

The disciples who entered the top 21 today naturally received the attention of countless martial artists.

But what made everyone pay the most attention and shocked today was the agreement between the Dragon King of the Dragon Gate and the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect, which caused countless people to talk about it.

However, because the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect’s disciples and family members numbered in the tens of millions, and the Dragon Gate didn’t have anyone to support them, the forum of the world of martial arts was full of abuse and contempt for the Dragon Gate.

“A small dragon gate dares to oppose our Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal Sect? It’s simply courting death. Tomorrow, under the leadership of senior brother Hua Gujiang, I’ll let you know the consequences of provoking us!”

“A small Dragon Gate Dragon King has only been established for a few years. He doesn’t have the slightest foundation. So what if he has a few immortals? Whether it’s the number of disciples or the number of immortals, we’re completely destroyed. If the immortals could make a move, they would have destroyed this trash dragon gate long ago!”

“Haha, the brothers who support the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect. This Dragon King is very arrogant. He thinks that he has become an immortal God at such a young age, but he doesn’t put his seniors in his eyes. He is arrogant and has a death wish!”

“A small force in the jianghu dares to go against our Orthodox immortal sect. He is simply courting death. It is said that this dragon gate doesn’t even have ordinary disciples. Hehe!”

Many, many people mocked the Dragon Gate. Even the immortal God level Dragon King dared to speak arrogantly on the Jianghu Internet.

After all, they had no scruples even though they were separated by the Internet.

Besides the people of the Holy Medicine and Holy Medicine Immortal sect, the disciples of the other immortal sects didn’t think highly of the Dragon Gate.

After all, the strength of the Holy Medicine and holy medicine immortal sects could be considered as the top among the twenty immortal sects. How could the Dragon Gate contend with them.

The disciples of the immortal sects didn’t think highly of the Dragon Gate when it came to the life-and-death battle between the disciples of the Dragon Gate and the Holy Medicine and Holy Medicine Immortal sect tomorrow.

Some people even shouted that they would post pictures of the disciples of the Dragon sect being killed tomorrow, attracting the support of many people.

...

“Xiao Yu, beautiful lady!”

Wang Xian, Xiao Yu, Shu Qing, and the rest had just returned to the mountain peak when they heard Feng Lingtian’s voice from outside.

“What are you doing?”

Xiao Yu heard the voice and walked out of the room with a smile on her face. She looked at Feng Lingtian and shouted loudly.

“Let’s go out and have some fun. Let’s go to Xuanyuan City. Since we’re already here, we should at least have some fun!”

Feng Lingtian looked up at Xiao Yu and said with a smile.

“Wait!”

Xiao Yu shouted and returned to her room. “Brothers, sisters-in-law, do you want to go to Xuanyuan city to have some fun?”

“How can we be third wheel when there’s a handsome guy who wants to date a beauty like Xiao Yu alone!”

Lan Qingyue looked at her with a big smile on her face and said with a smile.

“How is that possible? He’s so weak. I can fight ten of him alone.”

Xiao Yu pouted. “Let’s go, sisters-in-law. Let’s go out and have some fun!”

“HMM, Xiao Xian, are you going?”

A few girls were tempted and asked Wang Xian.

“No, you guys go ahead. There are some things that I need to take care of!”

Wang Xian shook his head at them.

“Brother, we’ll go out then. I’ll bring you some delicious food!”

Xiao Yu waved her hands at him and walked out happily.

Wang Xian smiled and nodded. “Go!”

After the group of girls left, Wang Xian sat on a chair in the middle while AO Jian stood at the side expressionlessly.

“Use the galactic stone to contact Prime Minister Gui. Ask him to bring five members of the Golden Swordfish clan over tomorrow. The five of them must be at the half-step immortal realm. Use some resources to nurture them!”

“Also, send another fifteen people at the infant realm!”

Wang Xian knocked on the table slowly. “Also, send thirty people from the strange demon clan over!”

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Ao jian nodded respectfully.

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly. “Holy Medicine Holy Doctor sect, it’s best not to provoke me. Otherwise...”

His eyes sparkled. Otherwise, so what if there was an agreement between the Immortals and gods!

When one’s strength reached a certain level, one could completely ignore the rules. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Following that, Wang Xian called Mo Qinglong over and asked about the shop.

While Wang Xian was dealing with the matter, Xiao Yu and the girls were strolling around the city of Xuanyuan city with Feng Lingtian.

Xuanyuan city was the city of the two immortal sects, the Xuanyuan clan and the Yuwen clan. It could be considered as the largest ancient city at the moment.

There were over ten million people living in the city. The streets were abnormally bustling with people.

“That’s Feng Lingtian from the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect, the son of the sect leader of the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect. He’s a seeded contestant. I heard that he’s extremely powerful and is known as the freakish crown prince by the people from the Yellow Cauldron!”

“That’s true. According to the comments on the Jianghu website, Feng Lingtian is at least at the peak of the infant realm, and can be ranked at the top in this competition!”

“Who are the beauties beside him? They’re so beautiful!”

Walking on the streets of Xuanyuan city, some of the martial artists in the city saw Feng Lingtian and whispered to him.

The Heaven’s chosen disciples of the twenty immortal sects could be said to be celebrities in the jianghu. The Jianghu website had detailed information about them and their appearances.

Hearing the discussions of the people around him, Feng Lingtian instinctively raised his chest with a hint of arrogance on his face.

It was the first time Guan Shuqing, Lan Qingyue and the other three appeared in public, so no one knew who they were!

“What are you pretending to be arrogant for, little slave!”

Seeing his expression, Xiao Yu stared at him mockingly.

“Hehe!”

Feng Lingtian’s face immediately fell. “I am now at least a heaven’s chosen among all the disciples of the immortal sects. Of course, I can not be with Xiao Yu, the great beauty. If you participate, what does it have to do with us!”

“Oh right, are you going on stage tomorrow?”

Feng Lingtian looked at her curiously.

“No need. My brother will take care of it. Didn’t you say that you’ve read the strategy of Xuanyuan City? Hurry up and bring us to eat good food!”

Xiao Yu urged.

“Okay, okay. Come with me. I know the most popular restaurant in Xuanyuan City. I don’t know if there are still seats available. Let’s hurry over!”

As Feng Lingtian spoke, he looked at the five beauties beside Xiao Yu and could not help but say, “Xiao Yu, your brother really enjoys the blessings of all!”

“Of course, my sister-in-law is very beautiful. But don’t think about it. You are the life of a servant!”

Xiao Yu smiled as if it was a matter of course and raised his head slightly.

Behind him, a few girls looked around with smiles on their faces. It was Tang Yinxuan and elder fan who felt a little unnatural when they heard their conversation.

“Over there, the God of cooking restaurant, the hottest restaurant in Xuanyuan City. The food there is one of the best in the world!”
