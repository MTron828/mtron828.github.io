Chapter 1335: 1336 was a legend

“If your Guanglong dynasty wants to make a move, I will make your Guanglong dynasty...”

“Rivers of blood!”

Cold and murderous words resounded in the sky above the island of the Guanglong dynasty.

Wang Xian stood there and stared at long Tengyang with a cold gaze.

His powerful aura and untouchable dignity made everyone’s heart tremble slightly.

“This...”

Everyone around widened their eyes when they saw Wang Xian facing the entire Guanglong Empire in such a domineering manner.

“This is too f * cking domineering!”

Some of the forces that came to observe the ceremony were all dumbfounded. Their eyes sparkled with a mystical luster.

“Maybe, this is a powerhouse!”

Some of the young men looked at Wang Xian with admiration. Their eyes were filled with yearning.

This was the dignity of a strong person.

It must not be offended!

So what if it was the Light Dragon Empire?

Everyone present could see clearly that the eighth prince wanted to kill Wang Xian.

Initially, everyone thought that Wang Xian might not be bothered because of the relationship between the second prince and the Giant Light Dragon Empire. But now, everyone was wrong.

Firstly, the position of the crown prince was not the second prince. If he killed the second prince, he would have the position of the heir.

Secondly, the dignity of the strong should not be violated.

What was there to be afraid of in the Guang Long Empire?

Looking at Wang Xian who was standing there, everyone took a deep breath.

Wang Xian’s action was unexpected, but it was within reason.

“You!”

Long Tengyang looked at the powerful Wang Xian with an extremely ugly expression.

He stared at Wang Xian coldly and looked at the generals and important officials around him, as well as the few elders of the judging panel.

At this moment, everyone from the Light Dragon Empire had an unsightly and solemn expression.

Wang Xian’s strength was obvious to everyone. He had the terrifying ability to kill Bing Hanzi, especially the gigantic millstone with a radius of 2,000 meters.

This made everyone’s heart palpitate.

The attack that was like the river of time was instantly wiped out by the sect master of the Frost sect who was at level four of the Seethrough realm. If Wang Xian was their enemy, who else would be able to withstand it.

Then, apart from the king, who else in the Light Dragon Empire could withstand it?

Even if they activated the formation around them, how effective would it be?

“Frost sect, destroy!”

Wang Xian didn’t give them any time to hesitate. He looked at everyone from the Frost sect. His figure flashed and the Crown on his head released a series of destructive attacks.

The attack covered an area of 1,000 meters.

“Oh no, run, Run Now!”

“Eighth prince, save us, save us!”

When the people from the cold sect saw Wang Xian’s attack, they widened their eyes and shouted in horror.

Some of the experts wanted to escape, while others begged for mercy from the eighth prince.

At this moment, the eighth Prince’s body was trembling violently.

“Father, save me!”

Long Xiaoyun pleaded for help to long Tengyang in fear.

Long Tengyang’s face revealed a furious expression when he saw Wang Xian making a move.

Buzz

“Ahhhhh!”

Miserable screams rang out. Frost sect, which had more than 30 insightful void stage experts, and nearly 1,000 top-notch frost sect disciples were instantly annihilated by the violent force in the Five Elements River.

How terrifying!

Four words flashed across everyone’s mind.

The extremely powerful Frost sect, from the founder to the sect master, and finally to all the insightful void martial artists and elite disciples, had all died.

All of this was because they had offended Wang Xian.

They would be annihilated as they wished, and they would do it as they said!

“Next, it’s Your Turn!”

Wang Xian’s figure flashed and appeared directly in front of the eighth Prince, Long Xiaoyun. One of his arms went straight for his neck.

“Father, save me! Save Me!”

Long Xiaoyun’s face was no longer as arrogant and arrogant as before. His face was filled with despair as he shouted for help.

With his strength, he would definitely be able to crush the heaven’s favorites of his generation. However, it was a pity that he was facing Wang Xian!

He had no ability to resist at all!

“Wang Xian, Stop!”

Long Tengyang saw his son being grabbed by Wang Xian. His eyes were bloodshot as he moved and appeared two thousand meters in front of Wang Xian.

A dragon head staff appeared in his hand. It was the dragon head of the Dragon Race of the supernatural continent.

A dazzling power of light gathered on his body.

“I’ll give you ten seconds to consider. Let Go of me!”

He stared at Wang Xian and shouted.

“Cough, cough, cough!”

Wang Xian grabbed long Xiaoyun’s neck with one hand, causing his face to turn extremely red. He coughed with great difficulty.

He slowly extended his other hand.

Boom

In an instant, Wang Xian’s other hand suddenly turned into seven to eight meters in size. His ferocious dragon claw pointed straight at long Shengyang.

“I have no enmity with your Radiant Dragon Empire, but I have enmity with Long Xiaoyun. He must die. If you want to fight, I’ll fight!”

He said with a domineering expression.

“Explode!”

“Boom!”

“No!”

Finally, he spat out a word. The palm that was holding long Xiaoyun instantly emitted a terrifying explosion!

The terrifying explosion was accompanied by a voice that was filled with regret and despair.

Wang Xian stared at long Tengyang calmly.

After the surrounding explosions and screams, the entire venue fell silent.

Wang Xian had killed a prince, and he was the one who was appointed as the crown prince.

If Long Tengyang were to make a move, it would definitely be a great battle.

However, all the Karma came from Long Xiaoyun.

He was showing off in front of a powerhouse at the peak. Now, even his ashes were fluttering in the wind.

Everyone in the entire Guanglong Dynasty fell silent.

The few elders of the judging panel at the back looked at each other with helpless eyes.

Who would have thought that such a thing would happen in the position of crown prince? Even an expert at level five of the Seethrough Void Tier had made a move.

“Get lost! Get out of Here!”

After a period of silence for about ten seconds, Long Tengyang’s expression kept changing. He shouted at Wang Xian with a face full of killing intent.

“Haha, See You Again!”

When Wang Xian heard long Tengyang’s words, he laughed out loud and retracted his long arm.

A carefree expression appeared on his face as he looked at Zhang Fengying.

Zhang Fengying looked at him with a smile on her face. Her figure moved and flew towards him.

“I’ve said it before. I will help you take the position of Crown Prince!”

Wang Xian looked at Long Xiaotian. With a wave of his arm, the token of the crown prince flew towards him.

PA

Holding the crown prince’s token, Long Xiaotian’s face was filled with bitterness. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

He was really afraid that Wang Xian would fight with his father.

He was really afraid that Wang Xian would become enemies with the Guanglong dynasty.

If that really happened, the consequences would be unimaginable!

“I’m leaving. Maybe in one or two years, I will visit the human-demon graveyard again. See You in the future!”

Wang Xian took a glance at long Xiaotian and his faint voice resounded in the sky.

He turned around and walked away with Zhang Fengying.

Behind him, everyone from the Light Dragon Dynasty and all the forces that came to watch the ceremony were filled with various expressions as they watched the disappearing figure.

Fear!

Admiration!

Respect!

Admiration!

In just a short year, he had left too many legends in the tomb of the demi-humans!
