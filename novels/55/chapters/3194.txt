“Die!”

A cold voice came out of the willow deity’s mouth.

She looked ahead at the huge leg that was attacking them, and her eyes were filled with killing intent.

Her entire arm immediately turned into a branch, and the densely packed willow leaves on it attacked the single leg.

“Pu Pu Pu!”

Countless willow leaves pierced through the huge single leg and drilled into it.

“Ah!”

The one-legged palace lord sensed the terrifying willow leaves and felt the destructive energy coming from the one-legged leg. His expression changed drastically as he roared in pain.

“What! ?”

“Not good!”

The expressions of the surrounding Fey God palace demons changed drastically when they saw this scene.

The bird vulture palace Lord’s pupils constricted as a look of shock appeared on his face.

“Willow Leaf Blossom, die!”

The Willow God growled, and the dragon-scale-like willow leaves flew out from one-legged palace leader’s huge legs. The willow leaves condensed into a godly dragon and rushed toward one-legged palace leader.

“No, no, no!”

The voice of fear and despair came out of one-legged palace leader’s mouth, and he screamed in fear.

He widened his eyes and stared at the Willow God in disbelief and shock.

The underling of the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace actually had the combat strength of a universe Knight Level 4.

If he had known that the other party had such terrifying strength, he definitely wouldn’t have dared to attack.

At such a close distance, and he was still provoking the attack, there was no way for him to dodge.

Peng

Countless willow leaves swept past his body, and he fell heavily to the side, his life force instantly disappearing.

With Willow God’s current combat strength, she was able to kill a universe Knight Level 4.

A Universe Knight Level 3’s provocation was simply courting death.

“Dragon Leaf Rulin, die!”

Willow God growled, and willow leaves swept out in all directions.

“Run, run, she’s a universe Knight Level 4 great being, run!”

Bird Vulture Palace master, who had just rushed into the air, felt that one-legged palace master’s life force was completely gone, and his face revealed a shocked expression as he roared in fear.

They knew a little about the Dragon Palace. Didn’t they say that the Dragon Palace was only a low-level race?

Wasn’t the strongest one a Level 3 universe knight?

How could it be so terrifying?

A Level 4 universe knight wasn’t something they could fight against.

“Run!”

Without Bird Vulture Palace master saying anything, the other great demons saw that one-legged palace master was instantly killed. Their hearts pounded violently, and they fled in fear.

“PFFT! PFFT! PFFT!”

However, at this moment, there were still five great demons who did not manage to dodge the willow deity’s attack.

The terrifying dragon-scaled willow leaves penetrated their bodies.

“Ah! No, don’t Kill Us!”

The Great Demons who were attacked roared in despair.

“Run, run quickly!”

When the great demons and demonic beasts from the surrounding demon god Palace saw this, they fled in all directions in fear.

“You deserve to die!”

Wang Xian said coldly. With a wave of his arm, he collected all the corpses. His body moved and he continued to fly forward.

He didn’t care about the monster God palace at all. What he was worried about now was the current situation of the Dragon Palace.

He flew straight out while the willow deity followed closely behind.

When the surrounding beasts saw this, they were shocked.

“The strength of the Dragon Palace is so terrifying. That woman was actually able to kill one of the palace masters of the Demon God Palace in an instant.”

“Hiss, she’s too strong. However, did the Heavenly Dragon Clan and the ancient painting sect really attack the Dragon Palace?”

Only when Wang Xian and the rest disappeared did the surrounding demonic beasts recover from their shock.

They wiped off the cold sweat on their foreheads and gulped.

The great demons and demonic beasts of the demon god palace heaved a sigh of relief when they saw the Dragon King and the rest of them leaving.

There was still lingering fear in their hearts.

Who would have thought that the dragon palace would have such a terrifying expert. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“I’ll put you in a space first.”

After flying out of the skysea Dragon Palace, Wang Xian looked at the female snake beside him and said.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

The female snake nodded timidly.

Wang Xian waved his arm and looked at the willow deity. “Return to the Dragon Palace directly.”

“Yes!”

The willow deity nodded and her figure gradually turned illusory.

Wang Xian also moved and returned to the Dragon Palace instantly.

“Hahaha, I’ve finally completed my fusion with the Dragon King. Dragon King of the Dragon Palace, I want you to die!”

Just as Wang Xian and the rest disappeared, a violent roar came from the Sky Sea Dragon Palace.

A terrifying pressure came from inside.

“What’s Going On?”

When all the demonic beasts in the Sky Sea Dragon Palace heard this voice and sensed the terrifying pressure contained in the Sky Sea Dragon Palace, their faces revealed a look of fear.

Even the bird vulture palace master’s pupils constricted slightly as fear appeared in his eyes.

He had just escaped the attack of that terrifying expert from the Dragon Palace. What was going on?

How could they be so unlucky?

“All disciples of the Demon God Palace, get out immediately!”

Palatial Lord Bird Vulture had a bad premonition as he roared sternly and immediately flew towards the exit.

The other great demons and disciples of the Demon God Palace also panicked as they flew out.

However, when they arrived in front of the Dragon Gate, they suddenly discovered a terrifying energy that completely sealed the entire Dragon Gate.

“Damn it, the Dragon King actually left. I’m going to kill them.”

“Since you’ve entered my Dragon Palace, don’t go out and submit to me!”

At this moment, another violent voice resounded throughout the entire Sky Sea Dragon Palace. This caused all the demonic beasts in the Sky Sea Dragon Palace to be filled with shock.

This makes all the demon beasts in the Sky Sea Dragon Palace body a tremble, the facial expression is incomparably embarrassed.

Tianhai Dragon Palace, Tianhai Dragon King is not dead!

…

Buzz

“Prime Minister Oogway, what happened?”

The sudden change in the Tianhai Dragon Palace was not known to Wang Xian.

At this moment he has returned to the Dragon Palace, came to the Dragon King Palace, to the prime minister turtle voice said.

“Dragon King.”

Prime Minister Gui was overjoyed when he heard Wang Xian’s voice transmission. He immediately rushed over to the Dragon King Palace.

“What happened?”

Wang Xian scanned his surroundings. He frowned slightly when he saw the situation outside the Dragon Palace. His eyes were flashing with a cold expression.

“Dragon King, after you and Willow deity left, 50 venerables and 400 to 500 disciples from the ancient art sect, as well as 100 venerables and 2 to 3 million disciples from the Heavenly Dragon Clan, came to attack us yesterday.”

“We went out to meet them, but the results were beyond our expectations. A Universe Knight Level 2 devouring Dragon died, and more than 2,000 imperial dragon species were killed. We had no choice but to retreat and defend the Dragon Palace.”

Prime Minister Gui immediately reported.

“Ancient Painting Sect, Sky Dragon Clan?”

Wang Xian’s killing intent was cold. “How many universe knights level 3 have they got?”

“Dragon King, they have seven universe knights at level 3. Although there are only seven of them, they have powerful acquired spiritual treasures.”

“The two powerful ancient paintings from the ancient painting sect and the Golden Dragon Pearl from the Heavenly Dragon Clan have caused Lei Ming and the rest to suffer greatly!”

“Now that you and Willow deity have returned, we can counterattack.”

Prime Minister GUI reported immediately, his eyes full of killing intent.
