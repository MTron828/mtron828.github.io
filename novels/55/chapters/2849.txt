2850 The 2,850 people were shocked

“Invincible in battle, we are the disciples of the eight barrens, you dare to snatch our things so brazenly, are you looking down on us?”

The disciples of the eight barrens stared uneasily at invincible in battle.

Speaking of which, they were the disciples of the eight barrens, they weren’t afraid of invincible in battle.

Even if the other party was a final disciple of an emperor God, the eight barrens had over a dozen Emperor God warriors.

Most importantly, even though they had more people, Invincible was an undying god King Level 7. However, they were 100% sure that if they clashed with invincible, they would definitely lose.

!!

The other party was the final disciple of an Emperor God, would the emperor not give him a life saving treasure?

This fellow might take out a treasure that could kill an undying god King level 8,9 and Pinnacle God King Warrior.

After all, God Emperor Shangshui was famous for doting on his last disciple.

“What do you mean by stealing your things? This Wind Jade is an ownerless item, it’s fated with me. Now that I want to take it away, why do you want to use the eight Barrens to suppress me?”

“TSK TSK TSK, do you think your eight barrens god Emperor is as shameless as you?”

Invincible looked at them and mocked them.

“You…”

Upon hearing invincible battle technique’s words, the faces of the eight barrens disciples turned gloomy.

For the sake of more than 20 wind jade, it was impossible for them to offend invincible battle technique.

“Such a treasure is fated to be with us. All of you can leave!”

Invincible battle technique waved his hand in a coquettish manner.

“Brother long, let’s go. That invincible battle technique is beside the younger daughter of God Emperor bewitching wind.”

At this moment, a middle-aged man among the disciples of the eight barrens said softly.

“Oh?”

The middle-aged man in the lead looked over. When he saw the sweet-looking woman beside invincible battle technique, his expression changed again.

“Since these wind jades are fated with young master invincible and Miss Tianxin, then we won’t compete with the two young masters and Young Ladies.”

The middle-aged man took a deep breath, cupped his hands and said.

Since it was impossible to obtain these wind jades, there was no need to offend the last disciple of the celestial emperor, the daughter of the Celestial Emperor. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“You know your place!”

“Farewell!”

The disciples of bhang turned around and left with a gloomy expression.

“Oh? Why aren’t you leaving? Didn’t you hear what our brother Wudi said?”

After bhang and the rest left, a young man behind invincible in combat arts shouted with a frown when he saw that Wang Xian, Ye, Lu Ying, and the rest were still standing there.

Invincible in combat arts also raised his eyebrows and swept his gaze across them.

However, his expression suddenly froze.

“Get lost!”

The young man behind him who was obviously an underling said coldly.

“We’re going to…”

“Hehe, you’re doing well, you idiot!”

When fourth senior sister saw that everyone from the eight barren had left, she knew that Feng Yu was not someone they could get their hands on. She spoke with an embarrassed expression. However, before she could finish her sentence, Wang Xian’s voice came from the side.

At this moment, Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and looked at the stunned invincible battle technique.

“Boss Wang!”

Upon hearing Wang Xian’s words, invincible battle technique’s body trembled. He regained his senses and his eyes shone with excitement.

“Boss Wang, you really missed me to death!”

“Sob sob, boss Wang, do you know that I miss you like a Torrential River?”

At the next moment, under the stunned and dumbfounded looks of the surrounding people, Invincible battle technique pounced on the young man who spoke.

“Eh?”

Seeing the last disciple of the celestial emperor, invincible of battle techniques, who was so talented that even the disciples of the eight Barrens didn’t dare to provoke him, pounced towards Wang Xian and spoke such exaggerated words, Ye lui Ying and the rest were also stunned.

They looked at the scene in front of them with some shock.

What was going on?

This invincible of battle techniques who had a deep background knew Wang Xian?

“Bang!”

At this moment, they saw invincible fighter pouncing over and hugging Wang Xian’s thigh.

“Wow, boss Wang, it’s been ten years. It’s almost ten years. We finally meet again!”

His exaggerated voice and exaggerated actions.

This caused ye Lui Ying and the rest to open their mouths slightly.

This final disciple of the celestial thearch, this genius invincible fighter, was so indecent?

Was Wang Xian his boss?

“Idiot, you haven’t changed at all!”

Wang Xian looked at the shameless look of unrivaled battle techniques and said with a smile.

“Aren’t you excited to see Boss?”

Unrivaled battle techniques said excitedly as he stood up and hugged Wang Xian.

“Alright, Alright!”

Wang Xian stretched out his hand to stop him from hugging.

“Who… who is that young man?”

“What’s going on? Brother Invincible, he… how did he do that?”

At the back, the group of young middle-aged men were all dumbfounded.

They knew invincible the best. Some of them were wild and unruly, some were unruly, and some were narcissistic.

They were talking about how they were the most pampered children of their generation.

They even wrote on their personal homepage that they were invincible in their battle techniques.

They had never seen an invincible battle technique submit to anyone before!

They had even seen an invincible battle technique saying in front of their master that it would not be long before my invincible battle technique would surpass yours.

To be able to say such words, one could imagine how arrogant he was. He did not put anyone in his eyes.

However, invincible battle technique did have the ability to do so.

He was a genius!

However, now, he was hugging the thigh of a young man and even addressed him as boss Wang?

This… what was the identity of this young man?

A person who could make battle techniques invincible? What kind of existence was he?

“Why did you come to the eight desolation six harmonies?”

Wang Xian patted the shoulder of an extremely enthusiastic person who was invincible in battle techniques and asked with a smile.

“Sigh, boss Wang, it’s a long story. You also know that my talent, which is as dazzling as the stars, attracted the attention of the imperial court.”

“Later, I was accepted as a disciple by a peak-stage godly king expert of the imperial court. Well, he was my second master. This master of mine directly brought me to the eight desolates and six harmonies. In the end, he died just a few days after arriving here!”

“But who is my invincible battle technique? The brightest star in the darkness. My master now appeared and directly accepted me as his last disciple.”

“Hehehe, my current master is a god-emperor-level powerhouse.”

Invincible in battle techniques said proudly.

“I really didn’t expect this!”

Wang Xian smiled in astonishment. It was fortunate that his master from the imperial court had brought him here. Otherwise, it would have been difficult to deal with him.

“Boss Wang, why are you here? Is this fate?”

Invincible asked happily.

“Fate!”

Wang Xian nodded with a smile. He looked at the shocked fourth senior sister and said, “Go and keep the Wind Jade!”

“Oh right, invincible, we found this wind jade. I let them keep it!”

He said to invincible.

“Of course there’s no problem. The treasure is fated to be with you, boss Wang!”

Invincible said without any objection.

Ye Lui Ying and the others widened their eyes. Even fourth senior sister was surprised!
