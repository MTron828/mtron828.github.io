3790 3789 insta-killed a ruler of the 7th rank

“Eh?”

When the royal experts heard the words of the angel and Phoenix experts, they felt a little helpless.

They looked at each other, and an old man in the center shook his head.

“Weng!”

The expert in the center moved his hand, and a model of the trading corridor appeared in his hand.

With a move of his hand, waves of energy shot towards the model in his hand.

“Weng!”

In the next moment, the entire trading gallery was enveloped by a wave of energy.

A thick, earthy yellow energy covered the entire trading gallery.

However, only the angel race and the Phoenix race were not covered by the energy.

This was a defensive technique of the royal family.

“What is this?”

“The energy actually covered the entire trading gallery. This powerful defensive power can at least block the attacks of a ruler at the seventh rank.”

“It should be able to withstand the attack of a master at the eighth level. After all, a peak race is a peak race. No wonder the royal family said that this place was very safe. It is indeed very safe.”

When the surrounding experts and disciples saw the sudden appearance of the defense, they revealed a trace of surprise and a smile.

At the same time, they also let out a sigh of relief.

After all, the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace and the Phoenix clan of the Angel clan were at a high level.

Once they were affected, they could die instantly. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

…

“What?”

At this moment, in the void, the third prince and the experts of the Angel clan were flying in the void.

Suddenly, a message came.

When the third prince saw this message, he slightly raised his eyebrows and looked surprised.

“How dare the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace appear in the Trading Gallery?”

The third prince murmured. He hesitated for a moment and immediately sent a message.

But soon, he received a message.

“Third prince, if you don’t come, the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace and the experts of the Phoenix clan will kill him!”

It was a message from the archangel of drought.

He frowned slightly when he saw this confident message.

He had a bad premonition that the Dragon King would appear in the long trading corridor so brazenly!

However, when he sent another message, the archangel of drought did not reply immediately!

In the long trading corridor, after the archangel of drought received the reply from the third prince, he immediately gestured to the experts of the Phoenix clan across from him.

Buzz! Buzz

Without any hesitation, he shot out a sword of light.

A water sword slashed directly into the restaurant below!

“Dragon King of the Dragon Palace, come out and face your death. Since you dare to come here, leave your corpse behind!”

The Archangel of droughts roared with a grim expression!

Boom

Two sharp swords landed in the restaurant and the entire restaurant exploded instantly.

Wang Xian sat there. The tai chi dragon plate wrapped around him and Lan Qingyue. He sat there quietly without moving!

The two attacks landed on his body and were easily blocked by the Tai Chi Dragon Plate.

Furthermore, a strong backlash force attacked the archangel of droughts and the Water Phoenix.

“Huh?”

“What?”

The expressions of the archangel of droughts and the Water Phoenix who was in the seventh level of the realm changed slightly.

Their bodies trembled as a surge of energy blocked the backlash!

A solemn look appeared in their eyes instantly.

“It’s that Dragon King!”

“It’s him!”

“Eh? He was actually able to block the casual attack of our archangel of drought. As expected of the Dragon King, he was able to kill a powerhouse at the sixth level of the Overlord realm easily.”

The group of angels and Phoenixes around didn’t notice the backlash of the Archangel of drought and the others. Their gazes were locked onto the position below.

Wang Xian was sitting in front of a table. Opposite him was a woman.

The tai chi dragon coiled around and blocked the surrounding energy!

At this moment, Wang Xian raised his head and swept his gaze across all the Angels and Phoenixes. A faint smile appeared on his face!

“Very good. All of them are here. There are over 2,000 angels and over 3,000 phoenixes. Hehe, this should be the most I can kill.”

Wang Xian spoke and said faintly.

The trading corridor was a very lively place. Disciples below the level of the Masters of the two peak races were all here.

There were quite a number of them!

“Arrogant Dragon King, today is the Day You Die!”

A phoenix that was in the level six realm heard Wang Xian’s words and said with a ghastly expression.

“Is that so? Then let’s see who dies first today!”

Wang Xian smiled and looked at Lan Qingyue beside him. “Let me do some exercise and kill them all!”

Lan qingyue nodded with a smile.

Buzz

Wang Xian’s voice disappeared and his figure instantly appeared in the middle of the group of experts from the Angel and Phoenix clans.

This terrifying speed caused many of the experts from the angel and Phoenix clans to be unable to see clearly.

When the archangel of drought and the Water Phoenix, who was the overlord of level seven, saw this scene, their pupils constricted slightly.

The bad premonition in their hearts just now became even more intense!

Wang Xian stood there quietly and turned around gently. Around him, Netherworld avatars appeared one after another!

“Netherworld avatars. These are the Netherworld avatars of our Netherworld race. This Dragon King actually possesses them. How Strange. Did he obtain some treasures of our Netherworld Race?”

“According to the records, it’s not that there are no experts of other races who have Hades’ghost clones of our Hades race. This Dragon King is very lucky, but I don’t know that he only has Hades’ghost clones of our Hades race and the accompanying elves of the ELF race. Isn’t this luck too heaven-defying?”

“That’s not right. Did you see the Dragon King’s speed just now?”

Not far away, hundreds of underworld race experts looked over and began to discuss.

But at this moment, an underworld race expert suddenly asked in shock.

Because of the underworld ghost avatar, they had somewhat neglected the Dragon King’s speed just now!

“Also, why does the energy of this underworld ghost avatar feel much stronger than my Underworld Ghost Avatar?”

An expert of the Netherworld race, who was at level six, growled in a low voice. His eyes were filled with disbelief!

Could it be that this Dragon King was powerful?

“Die!”

Wang Xian stared at them with a cold expression on his face. The four Netherworld ghost avatars around him instantly transformed into divine dragons and attacked all the experts of the angel race and Phoenix race!

“Roar Roar Roar!”

“Roar Roar Roar Roar!”

A dragon’s roar sounded and the four netherspirit avatars let out a terrifying roar.

The power of a level seven overlord erupted at this moment!

“Hiss!”

The hearts of the archangel of drought and the Water Phoenix who was a level seven overlord trembled violently.

“Run, run, all the powerhouses of the Angel clan and Phoenix clan, run!”

They hurriedly shouted.

At this moment, they realized that the Dragon King’s strength had already reached the seventh level ruler realm.

Moreover, with his terrifying speed and the four ghost clones, they were no match for him!
