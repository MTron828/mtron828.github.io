“You are even more powerful than my master. Can you teach me alchemy?”

“I am the art of water refinement while you are the art of fire refinement. I Can’t Teach You!”

“But my master said that water refinement and fire refinement are inseparable. There is no difference in the aspect of condensing pills!”

“The speed and success rate of condensing pills depend on one’s mastery. I Can’t teach you anything either. Everything depends on one’s talent. Naturally, one will be able to grasp it quickly if one is talented!”

“You... you just don’t want to teach me, HMPH!”

In the room, after Wang Xian revealed his alchemy skills, long Luo pestered him with admiration, wanting him to teach her alchemy skills.

However, Wang Xian didn’t have the leisure time to do so. Furthermore, no one taught him his alchemy skills. It all depended on the fire of origin and his strong control.

Alchemy indeed depended on one’s talent. Therefore, he dealt with it directly.

Long Luo looked at Wang Xian as he read through the information. She pouted her lips and stared at him unhappily.

She was the princess of the Radiant Empire. Who Wouldn’t pamper her and fawn on her? Furthermore, she was so pretty.

This fellow didn’t even look at her. He was staring at the information without blinking, causing her to gnash her teeth.

In the end, she snorted softly and returned to her room unhappily. She began to pack up her belongings.

“Brother Wang Xian, we have already packed up. If there’s nothing else, let’s set off now!”

Just after noon, Long Xiaotian came over personally and greeted Wang Xian.

“Alright, let’s go then!”

Wang Xian nodded his head and walked to the side of Ling Zilin. He rode on it directly.

Long Xiaotian looked at him with some envy. “Brother Wang Xian, there are a total of fifty to sixty people who came with me this time. Therefore, our speed might be a little slower. However, we are not too far from the tomb of the demi-human. We can arrive there in a day and a half!”

“Alright, there’s no Rush!”

Wang Xian nodded and followed long Xiaotian to the entrance of the mayor’s residence.

At this moment, there were more than 50 people gathered at the entrance of the Mayor’s residence. Apart from the two handmaidens, the rest of them were all at least at level seven of the extraordinary realm.

This level of strength was not considered weak.

A group of people was pulling five carriages. All of them were filled with spiritual herbs.

Wang Xian took a glance and was surprised to find that there were more than 1,000 spiritual herbs of transcendent level nine. There were also 200 to 300 spiritual herbs of half-step void interpretation level.

It seems that the background of the second Prince’s mother is not simple. To be able to give him so many elixirs to nurture his subordinates

Wang Xian thought to himself. This long Xiaotian was the most talented young man he had seen so far.

Furthermore, he had a strong background. He might really have a chance to become the king of the Radiant Dragon Empire.

The more than 50 people in front of the mayor’s residence had seen Wang Xian before. When they saw him riding on the insightful void Beast, their faces were filled with respect and awe.

“Let’s go, Let’s Go!”

Long Xiaotian said loudly in a good mood. The group of people immediately headed outside.

“Sir, come back to windsalt city often if you have time!”

“Lord Mayor, have a safe journey!”

On both sides of the street, the people of wind salt town waved at long Xiaotian respectfully to send him off. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The matter of the fierce beasts attacking the city had completely won the hearts of all the people of wind salt town.

Long Xiaotian waved his hand, his face full of smiles.

Looking at the people around him, he couldn’t help but feel lucky for what he did yesterday.

Not only did he gain the people’s support, but after the fierce beasts attacked the city, some people also learned of his identity as the second prince.

This made the largest aristocratic family in wind salt town and a few mercenary groups come to follow him.

Following him was not only his identity as a prince, but more importantly, his performance yesterday had made everyone admire him.

This time, he had gained more than a dozen powerful experts to follow him, which made his power a lot stronger.

“Let’s Go!”

The old man at the front shouted. Everyone sped up and rushed out.

They drove out of the city gate and headed towards the north.

The one pulling the carriage was an iron-green horse of extraordinary seventh level. Its speed was very fast and it could control the goods to fly in the air.

However, compared to the speed of the spirit purple qilin, it was many times slower.

However, Wang Xian was not in a hurry. He estimated that he had at least one million dragon crystals in his account for the medicinal pills that long Xiaotian needed to refine.

One million dragon crystals was equivalent to more than ten billion middle-grade spirit stones.

This made Wang Xian glad that he had made the right choice by coming to the tomb of the demi-human.

“Hey, brother Wang, can you let me sit on this spirit purple unicorn as well?”

After driving for more than an hour, long Luo, who was riding an extraordinary level eight iron-green horse, came to Wang Xian’s side with some envy and said to her.

“Sit at the back. Be careful!”

Wang Xian looked at her and nodded his head lightly.

“Yay, that’s great!”

Long Luo’s face revealed a hint of excitement. She leaped onto the back of the Ling Zilin and touched its shiny face. Her eyes were filled with excitement.

“Brother Wang’s pet is still the best. Even my father’s pet won’t let me ride it. I hate it so much!”

Long Luo was lying on top of it happily. Her legs were shaking non-stop.

Wang Xian took a look and smiled faintly. He didn’t say anything.

“If only I had such a powerful pet. No, there’s no need for it to be so powerful. It’s fine even if it’s a half-step void interpretation or transcendent level nine!”

Long Luo was lying on Ling Zilin’s body as she kept talking.

Wang Xian didn’t pay attention to her. Ling Zilin was big enough. It wouldn’t be a problem for him to carry another person.

The young girl felt bored when she saw Wang Xian ignoring her. She fell asleep while lying on her stomach.

Long Xiaotian and the others who were beside her took a look and smiled.

They continued to drive forward. Their speed was not considered slow. They flew straight past the mountains. By nightfall, they had traveled 3,000 to 4,000 kilometers.

Wang Xian sat on Ling Zilin and read the information. He closed his eyes and thought about the combination of dual-attribute attacks.

“Stop. Everyone, let’s take a break!”

At night, the old man in front shouted. Everyone stopped. Wang Xian also asked Ling Zilin to stop.

Long Luo jumped down from the back and ran happily towards Long Xiaotian.

“Brother Wang Xian, come and eat something!”

Long Xiaotian smiled at Wang Xian and said.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian looked around. They were in a forest surrounded by dense black trees. The entire area seemed to be filled with danger at night.

However, with their strength, they were not afraid even in such an environment.

Ling Zilin laid on the ground and closed his eyes to rest. Wang Xian walked towards Long Xiaotian and the rest.

“This shadow forest is very dangerous at night. If it were us, we wouldn’t dare to stay here at night!”

“Hehe, now that we have the prince, Lord Bai and that mysterious Lord, we are not afraid even if the void interpretation beasts come!”

A few members of the mercenary group who followed Long Xiaotian from wind salt town laughed and chatted.

Wang Xian walked over and sat down to have a meal with them.

“Oh? There are a bunch of animals that are looking for death!”

Suddenly, when they had just rested for more than ten minutes, Bai Qingshan stopped the chopsticks in his hand and looked around.
