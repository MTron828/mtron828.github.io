“Quick, Captain Wang, run!”

“There are more than ten to twenty wind-winged savage fish of supernatural level seven. Run, run!”

A few young men from the Void Beast mercenary group saw that Wang Xian was still standing there. Their faces were pale as they shouted loudly.

Wang Xian returned to the cave and watched as they ran over.

There were about a hundred people in total. It was obviously dozens fewer than when Wang Xian saw them. Judging from the injuries on their bodies, they must have met with some mishap.

“Captain Wang!”

A group of people approached. When Zhang Yitian and Xia houming saw the figures of Wang Xian and the rest, their expressions changed slightly. They quickly walked towards him.

When the Amethyst and void beast mercenary group saw their captain walking over, they followed him into the cave.

“What’s wrong? Let’s go quickly. We might be discovered by the windwing savage fish again in about ten minutes!”

An impatient voice came from behind and said coldly to them.

“Leader Wang, run away quickly!”

Zhang Yitian whispered to Wang Xian as he looked back warily.

Wang Xian was slightly taken aback. He looked at the anxious Zhang Yitian and Xia houming with a surprised expression.

“What’s Wrong?”

He looked at them in astonishment.

“It’s Wang Xian?”

“It’s him. He’s actually still alive. I really didn’t expect that!”

“I didn’t expect to bump into him!”

Some of the members of the mercenary group behind looked at Wang Xian and said in astonishment.

“Captain Wang, you should run quickly. Otherwise, you won’t be able to escape!”

Xia houming heard the discussion behind him and quickly pulled Wang Xian’s arm.

“Eh... Why Should I run?”

Wang Xian asked in surprise.

“Captain Zhang, Captain Xia houming, where can he run to?”

Just as Wang Xian finished his sentence, a cold voice came from behind.

He was holding a fiery red longsword in his hand. A group of people squeezed through the crowd and walked towards him.

Their eyes swept across the cave and finally landed on Wang Xian.

“Snake Mark!”

Wang Xian looked at him with a surprised expression on his face. Then, he swept his gaze across the group of people beside him.

Seven extraordinary level seven powerhouses.

“Snake mark, everyone from the Yun family, let’s escape quickly. The winged savage fish is about to catch up to us!”

Zhang Fengying and elder Zeng also walked in hurriedly. They looked at Wang Xian and said with a bad expression.

“There’s no rush!”

A faint smile appeared on Snake Scar’s face. The four extraordinary level seven experts beside him stared at Wang Xian with murderous intent.

“You’re really anxious. If you don’t leave now, those demonic beasts will chase after us. If you don’t leave, we will leave!”

Zhang Fengying said to Snake Scar with a solemn expression.

“Miss Zhang, if you want to leave, feel free to leave!”

A middle-aged man beside snake mark glanced at her coldly and said.

“Alright, Wang Xian, let’s Go!”

Zhang Fengying gestured to Wang Xian and said.

“But he can’t leave!”

A middle-aged man from the Yun family stared at Zhang Fengying with eyes filled with killing intent.

This caused her face to sink instantly.

“Senior Zhang, Wang Xian has killed Yun Hanhai and the rest. It’s normal for Captain Snake Mark to kill him now!”

“That’s right, Captain Snake Scar. Kill him quickly. Let’s escape quickly. If we are discovered by the wind-winged savage fish, we will be finished!”

“Captain Snake Scar, do you need our help?”

“That’s right. He’s just a freshman. Captain Snake Scar, kill him quickly. Let’s escape quickly!”

At the side, a group of students from the Demon Hunter College’s mercenary group looked behind them and shouted worriedly.

They were very worried about the group of windwing savage fish behind them.

Ten hours ago, they had suddenly encountered a group of windwing savage fish and the Brocade scale boa, instantly killing more than 30 people.

If not for the help of a few transcendent-level rank 7 experts, they would have almost been finished. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

It was also fortunate that there were a few transcendent-level rank 7 experts. Fortunately, only five people could stand in a row in the narrow passage. Otherwise, they would have been finished.

Even so, they suffered heavy losses. After running for the next four hours, they met snake mark and the rest.

Snake Mark and the rest had eight transcendent-level rank 7 experts. With their help, it was much easier.

However, during their escape, there was still a transcendent-level rank 7 expert who was accidentally killed.

Right now, they were filled with fear. This territory of the winged fish was too dangerous.

They hoped that snake mark and the Yun family members could kill this fellow as soon as possible and escape.

“Do it. After we do it, let’s leave quickly!”

Snake Mark looked behind and said to the Yun family’s powerhouse beside him.

“Okay!”

A few middle-aged men from the Yun family knew the severity of the situation. They nodded and a middle-aged man with a long saber instantly slashed at Wang Xian.

Zhang Yitian, Xia houming, Zhang Fengying, and the members of the Amethyst Void Beast saw the middle-aged man’s attack instantly and their expressions changed.

“That kid is going to die!”

“Hurry up and die. You’re wasting our time!”

The people behind them exclaimed excitedly when they saw the transcendent level 7 powerhouse from the Yun family making his move.

“Bang!”

The long saber landed. However, what shocked everyone was that a middle-aged man holding a golden long sword directly blocked the long saber beside him.

“Hehe!”

Wang Xian looked at snake mark with a smile on his face. A hint of coldness flashed in his eyes.

“Eh? A powerhouse at level seven of the supernatural realm!”

Snake mark was slightly stunned. His face revealed a look of astonishment.

The people behind him were also stunned and filled with astonishment.

Even the members of the Amethyst Void Beast and Zhang Fengying and elder Zeng looked at Ao Jian with astonishment.

Weren’t they all at level six of transcendence? Could it be that this middle-aged man was hiding his strength?

“I didn’t expect there to be a level seven of transcendence next to him. No wonder he could kill our young master!”

A hint of surprise flashed across the eyes of the middle-aged man from the Yun family. The killing intent in his eyes did not diminish in the slightest.

“A level seven of transcendence?”

Snake Scar took two steps back and stared at Wang Xian. He growled in a low voice, “So what if he is at level seven of transcendence? Kill him! Kill that level seven of transcendence as well!”

“Kid, let me tell you. No matter who you are, you will die if you kill our young master!”

Another burly middle-aged man held an axe in his hand and hacked at Wang Xian.

“HMPH, even a transcendent level seven powerhouse will die!”

“That’s right. There are seven transcendent level seven powerhouses beside Captain Snake. But that Wang Xian is really troublesome!”

“That’s right. He’s wasting our time. It’s best if he dies as soon as possible!”

When the students at the back saw this scene, their expressions did not look good.

The four experts of transcendent level seven who were standing in front of them also did not look good.

The longer they stayed here, the more danger they would be in.

“Everyone, kill them as soon as possible!”

An elder of transcendent level seven said to them.

Wang Xian swept his gaze across the group of people who spoke. A mocking expression appeared on his face.

“Die!”

The old man who was holding a huge axe in his hand raised it up and slashed at Wang Xian heavily!
