Chapter 3109: 3,108 people were not satisfied

“What!”

“To break through to the Universe Knight realm within 10,000 years?”

“Hiss, Senior Junzi, are you serious?”

Hearing Senior Junzi’s words, everyone was shocked.

To break through to the Universe Knight realm within 10,000 years, what kind of concept was that? Universe Knights?

There were only a few universe knights in the entire Milky Way.

Once Senior Junzi made a breakthrough, he would be a pinnacle existence in the entire Milky Way, a great being who could shake an entire region.

“How is this possible? Could it be that fruit?”

Senior Brother Lu, senior brother Kong, and the others widened their eyes.

They were senior brother Junzi’s senior brothers, and they had reached the pinnacle god Emperor realm earlier than senior brother Junzi. However, it was extremely difficult, and even impossible, for them to break through to the Paragon realm.

Now, when they saw that their junior brother was confident that he could step into the supremacy realm within ten thousand years, they were both shocked and envious.

“It’s all thanks to junior brother Wang Xian this time. Otherwise, I wouldn’t dare to be sure if I would have the chance to step into the supremacy realm in my lifetime.”

Senior Brother Junzi looked at Wang Xian and thanked him once again.

Wang Xian smiled faintly and looked at everyone. “Let’s go. Let’s go out.”

“Junior brother Wang Xian, do you still have that kind of fruit? Can you sell one to us?”

At this moment, senior brother Kong could not help but ask.

They were universe knights. It was their lifelong pursuit. Now that they had this opportunity, they naturally would not give it up.

“No more. The last two were given to senior brother Junzi and the rest.”

Wang Xian shook his head and said perfunctorily.

“How is this…”

Senior Brother Kong and the rest obviously didn’t believe it.

However, when they saw Wang Xian in such a state, they knew that Wang Xian obviously didn’t want to sell it to them.

“Junior brother Wang Xian, we are willing to take out enough treasures. We can even use the entire clan’s strength to sell one to us.”

Senior brother Lu stood at the side and said to Wang Xian while clenching his fists.

“It’s really gone.”

Wang Xian shook his head again. He was not prepared to sell such treasures before the Dragon Palace became truly powerful.

Otherwise, it would attract the covetous eyes of powerful factions.

At that time, the gains would not make up for the losses.

Moreover, Wang Xian was not familiar with senior brother Lu and the rest. He did not have a good impression of them.

Seeing that Wang Xian rejected them, senior brother Lu and the rest did not look too good.

They looked at their surroundings. Their gains this time were not as good as the disciple who had obtained the medicine bottle.

“Junior brother Wang Xian, we have a presumptuous request. This time around, a peak-stage celestial thearch has fallen. A few eighth-level celestial thearch disciples have fallen. This is a huge blow to our race.”

“Junior brother Wang Xian, can you give us a battle angel at the peak of celestial thearch? We are willing to pay for it.”

Senior brother Lu asked Wang Xian a little unwillingly.

“I can sell it at the price of a battle pet of the same level.”

Wang Xian replied to him indifferently.

“A battle pet of the same level!”

Upon hearing Wang Xian’s reply, senior brother Lu’s face darkened, he squeezed out a smile and said, “Junior brother Wang Xian, you have obtained over 10,000 battle angels and over 1,000 divine weapons this time. The acquired Numinous Treasure was also obtained by you. I hope that junior brother can help us. Our losses this time are greater than our gains. Furthermore, we have to bear a huge risk.”

“If you want to blame someone, blame yourself for being too greedy.”

Wang Xian replied expressionlessly.

If that old man didn’t enter the fourth level on impulse, how would he be attacked by the battle angels of the venerable level?

If that old man didn’t die, their gains were considered pretty good.

After all, they had also obtained a few hundred battle angels.

These battle angels were even more precious than battle pets of the same level.

Wang Xian had also given them a divine artifact at the peak of the celestial thearch level.

They only needed to bear the possibility of being found out by the nine-sword race.

Furthermore, the possibility wasn’t very high.

It was totally worth it to take such a risk to obtain such a treasure. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

However, it was their own problem to lose a peak expert due to their own greed.

This time, without him, no one would be able to obtain the treasures on the fourth floor. In fact, they had already suffered a fatal blow when they were on the third floor.

“Ha Ha, senior brothers and sisters, let’s go out first.”

Senior Brother Junzi said with slight embarrassment when he saw senior brother Lu and the others’abnormally embarrassed expressions.

“Alright, Alright. Let’s go out and celebrate.”

The disciples of the Willow deity Daoist sect also noticed that the atmosphere was not right and said with a smile.

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian nodded and walked straight out.

After flying out of the Crescent Mystic Realm, Wang Xian took out the crescent moon key and immediately changed the entry settings.

Without the crescent moon key, it was impossible to enter again.

In a few days, he was prepared to get ao crab and the rest to come over and see if they could devour this Cosmos God country.

“I will sprinkle the Willow Deity’s pure water in the void. It can block out all our auras. Senior Martial Brother Kong and senior martial brother Lu, you don’t have to worry. The death of the nine-sword race shouldn’t be traced back to you.”

“They will only know that it was done by us.”

Senior Martial Brother Junzi flew out and took out a willow branch and a treasure bottle from his interspatial ring.

The willow branch dipped in the liquid from the treasure bottle and sprinkled it in the void.

This was the treasure he had obtained from the willow deity Daoist sect.

In the Milky Way, basically no one could break venerable willow deity’s concealment technique.

“Good!”

Senior Martial Brother Kong and the others nodded with a smile.

“Hehe, even if the nine sword race knows that we did it, it doesn’t matter. We have reaped a huge harvest this time. We will cultivate in the willow deity Daoist sect for ten thousand years. When senior martial brother Junzi breaks through, with senior martial brother Junzi and the willow deity Daoist sect protecting us, who would dare to bully us?”

Senior Martial Sister Lingxin said with a happy face.

“That’s right. When senior martial brother Junzi breaks through, the nine sword clan won’t dare to deal with us.”

All the disciples of the Willow deity Daoist sect said with excitement.

“Ha Ha!”

Senior Martial Brother Junzi laughed from the side.

“Ha Ha, then next, we will have to curry favor with junior martial brother Junzi. Come, come. I have a powerful warship here. Junior Martial brothers and sisters, we will send you back to the willow deity Daoist sect. At the same time, we can stand on the ship to celebrate.”

Senior Brother Kong waved his arm with a smile. An azure blue ship appeared on the surface of the sea below.

“Senior Brother Kong, you really flatter me. Let’s go. We’ll take senior brother Kong’s warship.”

“Junior brother Wang Xian, what about you?”

Senior Brother Junzi nodded and looked at Wang Xian.

“I’ll go to the Willow deity Daoist sect too.”

Wang Xian hesitated for a moment before nodding.

“Junior brother Wang Xian, Please!”

Senior Brother Kong invited him with a hint of flattery.

“Thank you!”

Wang Xian nodded his head and flew towards the battleship below.

“Senior brother Lu, what about you guys?”

Senior Brother Junzi and the rest looked at senior brother Lu and the rest.

“We will go as well!”

Senior brother Lu’s expression changed. He exchanged glances with the elder beside him before leading the group of disciples to fly downwards.

They looked at that figure in front of them and revealed a sinister expression.

“Old Lu, you junior brother from the Willow deity Daoist sect are not giving us any face. You have embarrassed US one after another.”

A voice entered senior brother Lu’s mind.

“He is too arrogant. The incomparably powerful fruit in his hand should have been obtained in the fourth floor. He has obtained so many treasures, yet he is not willing to give us a single bit of face. He is not giving us any face!”

Senior brother Lu’s eyes were cold as he replied with a voice transmission.

“His strength is too strong. He’s almost invincible among peak divine emperors!”

The elder by the side was silent for a few seconds before he shook his head slightly.

“Later, I’ll go and test senior brother Kong and senior brother Xu. If they don’t have any thoughts, then we can only tell them the news…”

“Don’t blame us. We’re greedy, but not only are you greedy, you’re also arrogant and arrogant!”

Senior brother Lu’s eyes revealed coldness and anger, he did not finish his words, mumbling voice transmission.
