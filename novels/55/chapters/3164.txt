Chapter 3165: 3164 was annihilated

“You want to escape?”

Venerable Willow God’s expression turned cold when she saw the blood violent tribe leader trying to escape.

She could restrain him in a one-on-two situation, so she wasn’t afraid in a one-on-one situation.

Looking at the blood violent tribe leader who wanted to escape, she waved her arm, and countless weeping willows attacked him.

The weeping willows completely enveloped him.

“Damn it, I’m not his match.”

Looking at the weeping willows that enveloped him completely, his expression was abnormally ugly.

He had relied on the dragon scales to increase his strength, and he was close to an ordinary universe knight level 3. However, against a universe Knight Level 3 great being, he was no match at all.

Especially someone like Willow God Knight.

He couldn’t escape the attack by himself.

“I can’t stay here any longer.”

He looked anxious.

“Sou Sou Sou!”

At this moment, the willow branches lashed at him.

His expression changed.

“Peng Peng Peng!”

The willow branches landed on his body, causing his blood to splatter.

Suppression, complete suppression.

“No, no!”

In the huge space of the willow branches, he had no power to resist.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

He raised his head and let out an angry roar. The dragon scales on his body flew out and chopped at the willow branches.

The incomparably sharp dragon scales immediately chopped off the willow branches.

But soon, the chopped willow branches grew back and continued to lash at the blood violent tribe leader.

“Break through!”

He roared and flew over while staring at one spot.

The dragon scales covering his body slowly floated up and slashed at the willow branches.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

But this time, when the dragon scales flew out and cut off the willow branches, more willow branches wrapped around the dragon scales and wrapped them up.

After all, the dragon scales were not a part of the blood ruthlessness clan leader’s body. When the dragon scales cut off the willow branches, they were also suppressed by the venerable willow deity.

“Damn it, break, break, Break!”

Seeing the dragon scales on his body being suppressed, blood flowed out of the blood ruthlessness clan leader’s eyes. He did not care about the loss, and a large number of dragon scales slashed toward the willow branches.

The venerable willow deity waved his arm. When the dragon scales cut off the willow branches, the attack power was greatly reduced. The willow trees condensed into a cage and suppressed the dragon scales.

“This won’t do. If this continues, I’ll be finished. I have to escape, I have to!”

The bloodthirsty race sensed the suppression of the dragon scales and the weakening of their own strength. Panic appeared in their eyes.

If this continued, they might completely die here.

“Dragon Scales, Break!”

He gritted his teeth. All the dragon scales on his body slowly floated up from his body and condensed into a terrifying dragon scale storm.

The storm of dragon scales directly attacked the willow branches that were blocking him.

“Sou Sou Sou!”

Wherever the storm of dragon scales passed, all the willow branches were cut off.

Venerable Willow God slightly frowned. He hesitated for a moment and waved his arm.

His palm directly became longer, turning into a huge willow branch.

The huge branch rotated and condensed, like the roots of an old tree.

The willow branch wrapped around all the dragon scales.

“Run!”

The blood ruthless clan leader used the safety space created by the countless dragon scales to tremble and slowly became illusory.

Venerable Willow God looked at the illusory blood ruthless clan leader and didn’t have time to stop him. He shook his head.

“The blood ruthless clan leader escaped, but his dragon scales were suppressed by me.”

After the leader of the bloodthirsty race had escaped, the resistance on the dragon scales had disappeared.

Venerable willow deity waved her arm and grabbed all the dragon scales in her hand.

“Thank you, Venerable Willow Deity.”

Upon hearing her voice, Wang Xian was immediately grateful. He continued, “Since venerable willow deity has already made a move, help us suppress that dragon skeleton again. After this, our Dragon Palace will reward you greatly.”

“Alright!”

Venerable willow deity did not reject him. With a move of his body, he brought a sky full of willow branches behind him and attacked the dragon skeleton directly.

“Oh No.”

“Roar Roar!” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

When the dragon skeleton saw venerable willow deity attacking him, his expression changed drastically.

With his strength, he could escape in an instant.

However, all the divine kingdoms of the skeleton race were on the Skeleton Island.

Even if he returned to his own divine kingdom in an instant, he would only return to the skeleton island.

And the Skeleton Island was right next to it. In other words, unless he could break out of it, he would die.

This made the dragon skeleton’s eyes reveal an anxious expression.

Whether it was the Lightning Dragon or the venerable willow deity, he wasn’t a match for them in a one-on-one situation.

Let alone a one-on-two situation.

“Ah! Ah! Ah!”

At this time, the screams of the surrounding people kept ringing out.

The three races, which had a much smaller number of knights than Dragon Palace, were now completely one-sided.

One by one, the universe knights were killed quickly.

“The clan leader has escaped. We are finished.”

A Universe Knight of the brutal blood race saw that his clan leader had escaped. He looked at the four universe knights who were surrounding him and showed a look of despair.

He was going to die.

“Not good, the three races are completely defeated.”

The two universe knights from the ancient art school, who were sealed by the sky array, had a drastic change in expression.

“Go all out and escape.”

They roared and started to break through regardless of the consequences.

They knew that if they did not break through, they would most likely be left here.

“Peng, Peng, Peng!”

“No!”

At this time, loud noises and screams could be heard.

They looked over and their hearts sank.

The golden skeleton clan leader’s body, which had a face full of cracks, had completely collapsed, and his life force was quickly extinguished.

Except for them, all the universe knights at Level 2 were killed.

At this time, they felt that everyone was looking at them.

When they saw the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace and the other four level 2 universe knights locked onto them, their faces were filled with shock.

Cold sweat appeared on their foreheads as fear started to spread.

“Get rid of the two guys from the ancient art sect.”

Wang Xian’s voice rang out. At the same time, it represented a judgment.

This made the two venerables from the ancient art sect turn extremely pale.

“It’s over. The three races are completely finished. The two venerables of the ancient painting sect are also finished.”

“In the end, even though venerable willow deity made a move, the strength of the Dragon Palace is also very terrifying. Forty universe venerables!”

“This battle is simply too terrifying. I reckon that more than twenty universe venerables will perish. The skeleton race will be completely exterminated!”

“It’s about to end, the three clans will be exterminated, this is simply unimaginable.”

When the surrounding spectators saw this scene, their faces were filled with shock.

The battle continued for 10 days, and almost all the elites of the three clans died.

The terrifying strength of the Dragon Palace.

The powerful pure-blooded dragon of the Dragon Palace was completely displayed before all the powers in the Milky Way.

Its terrifying strength made all the forces tremble.
