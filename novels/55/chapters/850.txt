Chapter 851: 0852 funeral 3

Translator: 549690339

“No, no!”

The sound of Yuwen Hua wailing could be heard from the wedding venue.

Everyone from the Yuwen clan trembled slightly. Their faces were filled with humiliation and anger.

The gods of the Northern European god domain had extremely ugly expressions on their faces. The princess of their God domain had been directly killed. She had been burned to death in front of them. However, they had not been able to do anything about it.

They didn’t even have the chance to take revenge.

Around them, the immortal sects from the east and the gods from the west watched this scene with complicated expressions on their faces.

It was the most eye-catching wedding on Earth. However, today, it had turned into this scene.

Just as the Dragon King had said, the wedding had turned into a funeral!

“Everyone from the Yuwen clan, we are sorry for your loss. We will leave First!”

The members of the Xuanyuan clan cupped their hands and left immediately.

The members of the other immortal sects also left immediately.

On the mountain peaks around the wedding, in Xuanyuan City, the lights were still bright. It was an ordinary wedding.

However, the people outside and in the city didn’t know that this wedding had turned into a funeral.

“Who would have thought that this wedding of the century would actually turn out like this!”

“The Dragon King actually dared to directly kill the daughter of the Scandinavian deity king, killing two highgods. In the future, the two powers will probably fight to the death!”

“Who would have thought that the Dragon King would actually be so terrifying? A Highgod was easily killed in front of him. This is too terrifying. While the others are improving, the Dragon King is also improving at a terrifying rate!”

Some of the immortal gods who had left were sighing as they conversed. The strength that the Dragon King had displayed today had truly shocked everyone.

The forty to fifty immortal gods of the Yuwen clan’s Nordic region did not dare to make a move. They watched as the Dragon King left and watched as the princess of the Nordic region was burned to death!

However, one could imagine that the Nordic region and the Dragon Palace had already become arch-enemies.

What would happen if the two most powerful forces of the East and west clashed?

“It’s also that Philomena is courting death. After all, the Dragon King is also the most powerful force of the east. He came to your wedding personally and gave you a congratulatory gift. In the end, you didn’t give the Dragon King any face and humiliated the Dragon King in front of so many people. Aren’t you courting death?”

“Maybe he thinks that he has a father who is a godly king, so he dares to look down on everyone. He is indeed rude. He didn’t give any face to the guests at his own wedding. No wonder the Dragon King directly showed killing intent and killed him on the spot!”

“If he doesn’t seek death, he won’t die. Do you really think that a top-tier powerhouse, the Master of a powerful force, would let a rich second generation woman like you humiliate him? You are courting death!”

Some people were shocked by the Dragon King’s faction, but there were still people who were disdainful of Philomena’s actions.

They thought that they had a powerful background, but they actually dared to disrespect others. Now that they had met the Dragon King, the result was that they were killed. Moreover, they died very miserably.

The Yuwen clan’s people also thought that they had a marriage alliance with the Scandinavian divine realm, so they could disregard the Dragon King. In the end... Hehe.

This was the fate of a group of people seeking death.

Not long after the lively and festive xuanyuan city began to boil, the news of Philomena’s death spread, and the entire city was shocked.

Very quickly, this matter spread to the Jianghu website.

Today’s Jianghu website, the posts were all about the immortal sects’congratulations on the marriage between Yuwen clan’s Yuwen Hua and the Scandinavian god’s domain’s Philomena.

As well as the discussions of the immortal sects’experts on this wedding, when the news of Philomena’s death spread to jianghu website, it shocked the entire internet.

When Philomena toasted, she did not give face to the dragon king in front of everyone. The Yuwen clan did not make any apologies, and the Dragon King killed her on the spot! FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

When this news came out, the entire jianghu was shocked.

“The Dragon King is awesome. Damn it, this philomena is really courting death. The Dragon King personally went to attend her wedding and gave her a congratulatory gift, but she actually did not give face to the Dragon King. Well Done!”

“The best death-courting expert of the year, the daughter of the Scandinavian god Realm’s god King, Philomena. Well Done!”

“Treating a guest like this, there is nothing wrong with the Dragon King killing her. This Yuwen clan is too arrogant. They think that they can not give face to the Dragon King just because they are in the Scandinavian god realm. Now That’s great, this is really interesting!”

“Haha, this is really interesting. The Yuwen clan invited the Dragon King to attend the wedding, but the bride insulted him directly. The Yuwen clan did not react at all. Well Done!”

The disciples of the immortal sects on the Jianghu website all replied in unison. They all said that Philomena was courting death and the Yuwen clan was too arrogant.

That was why, if not for all of this, the Dragon King would not have made a move!

In an instant, the originally lively jianghu website became even more lively and even continued until the wee hours of the morning.

“Boom! Boom!”

However, at the wee hours of the morning, an earth-shattering sound came from the direction of the Yuwen clan.

The earth seemed to be trembling.

“Dragon King, I, the King of Northern Europe, the king of all gods, Okudin, will definitely exterminate you in three days. All members of the Dragon Palace will not be spared. Even if the heavens and the earth enter, you will not be able to escape this calamity!”

An angry roar resounded throughout the east. The voice shook the sky. All the people who had fallen asleep were awakened and listened to the voice with shock on their faces.

King of Northern Europe!

King of all gods!

King of God Okudin!

The strongest person in the west and the most powerful god in the west.

How strong could an existence that could be recognized as the strongest by everyone be? !

Everyone had shocked expressions on their faces.

No one expected that this godly monarch would rush over so quickly.

“Yuwen clan, you bunch of Damned Fellows!”

At this moment, in the Yuwen clan’s position, a sun-like disc was suspended in the dark night sky 10,000 meters in the sky, causing the entire area to be lit up.

An elder sat on a huge divine seat, and two black crows that were three meters in size stood on the edge of the divine seat.

There was a golden disc that was one meter long above the old man’s head. The disc was emitting a white light!

Four huge Pegasus with wings pulled the throne. Each Pegasus was emitting a dazzling light. They were at the level of Immortals and gods.

The old man was also emitting a white light. He had endless majesty.

The king of all gods was worthy of his name.

“God King okuding, please calm down. We, Yuwen...”

“Shut up!”

In the sky, the Yuwen clan’s supreme elder and a group of Yuwen clan immortals greeted the arrival of the divine king in fear and trepidation.

Behind the Divine King stood a group of gods exuding a terrifying aura. All of them were clad in battle armor and were filled with dignity.

The group of about five thousand people looked like a powerful battle team that had come from ancient times.

The Yuwen clan’s supreme elder bent down and was about to finish his sentence when divine king Okudin extended a finger. A white beam of light instantly shot towards him.

The Yuwen clan’s Grand Supreme Elder’s expression was horrified as he hurriedly blocked it.

“Peng!”

However, a terrifying force landed on his body, causing him to spit out blood. Instantly, he was heavily injured as he fell towards the ground.

The might of a divine king shook the world!
