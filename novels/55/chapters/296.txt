Chapter 297: Like God, Like Devil

Boom!

The plane whistled in the air as the entire forty-meter long aircraft started crushing down uncontrollably.

A booming, air-rending sound and the screams from passengers on the plane were heard all over the entire aircraft.

Ha!

Yet two soft bellows were coming from the bottom of the plane.

Boom!

Wang Xian and Sui Huang jerked their bodies, and two large pairs of wings sprang into action on their backs.

Fiery red just like the color of the blood. Sui Huang’s pair of wings that resembled lava stones emerged from both sides.

As the two gigantic wings spread out, they spanned across around ten meters which looked terrifying.

A gentle flap would bring about freaky high temperatures. If it was not for his intended protection, the aircraft could have burst into flames.

The wings behind Sui Huang were totally out of their league, compared with those experts of Fire God Denomination back then.

Behind Wang Xian was a pair of fiery-red wings too.

The energy of the Dragon Ball could transform into a pair of dragon or phoenix wings. The huge wings may not be as big as Sui Huang’s, but they had also reached seven meters.

Besides, the wings behind Wang Xian were more agile and flexible. Flapping them gently would exude the domineering power of Divine Dragon.

Boom, boom!

Both men raised their hands and exchanged a glance with smiles on their faces.

Another booming sound from the aircraft was heard. But this time, the plane stopped itself from crashing down.

With the help of the two powerful forces, the plane came to an abrupt halt and eerily suspended itself in the air without moving.

“Ah, what’s going on? Why did the plane stop moving?”

“Did the plane recover? Is it fixed?”

“Is the danger over? Is it over?”

At this moment, the flight passengers had no clue about what was going on under the plane when they witnessed such an incredible scene.

Their eyes were agape. Some of them had tears on their faces as they asked in a panic.

Even the staff on the plane was puzzled.

“Could it be that Chief Leader and that young man?”

Some of the staff were in a daze back in the cockpit. When the two of them had jumped out of the plane, they were feeling hopeless and had lost all concerns.

Yet, the plane had come to a halt strangely in the air. All of them could not help but gulp.

“We still have hope. The Chief Leader and that young man were powerful ancient Martial Artists!”

A glimmer of excitement flashed in the eyes of a staff member as he spoke, quivering.

“Yes, we’re safe! We’re safe! That’s wonderful! Bravo!”

The staff in the cockpit began to look animated.

“Dear passengers, the plane is now stable. Do not panic, keep calm. We’ll be landing safely!”

A flight attendant quickly consoled all the passengers in the cabin through the sound system.

“What?”

“The plane is stable? Great! I thought I was going to die!”

“Haha, wonderful. Wonderful! We’re still alive!”

When the passengers heard the voice of the staff on the plane, they were zestful.

The excitement of the aftermath was reflected in everyone’s faces.

“Wow, strong and domineering prowess. Is this the strength of Sui Huang?”

The middle-aged Inborn Expert was using his power to block the hole in the first-class cabin. When he witnessed the gigantic fiery wings, he was astounded. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Using their physical bodies, they lifted and secured the entire plane!

“Another ten kilometers away. Let’s go!”

With a shout from Wang Xian, Sui Huang made a swift move as he gazed ahead, flapping his wings slightly.

“Haha, go!”

The two of them carried the plane and slowly flew off.

With the two people carrying an aircraft that weighed nearly a hundred tons in the air, their speed was not fast, but maintained forty to fifty kilometers per hour.

“Oh my god!”

“Incredible!”

“Crazy! This is crazy!”

All the staff stopped their work at the headquarters of Shang Jing airport as they were shocked to see what the satellite had captured on screen.

Everyone, with their eyes wide open, stared at the monitor in disbelief.

Two people with gigantic wings were carrying the entire aircraft in the air.

Such a breath-taking scene that seemed god-like struck everyone dumbfounded.

They were flying at an incredible speed even with the plane on their backs. Were they even humans?

They were simply like a God or Devil.

The executives of high management of the airline back at the headquarters were staring blankly at the screen.

“Quick! Organize all the planes at the airport now to allow ample time for that plane to land. Hurry, get the staff to settle this. Also, get the security personnel and seal off the landing area of that plane!”

One of the executives quickly ordered the surrounding staff.

“Yes!”

“Great! How wonderful to have powerful experts to carry the entire plane with their physical bodies. We managed to tide through this crisis. That’s great!”

Some of the executives exclaimed elatedly and continued to give orders, “Keep the radio on. Since the plane is now landing, get hold of A934J and ask what was going on, and contact the two mighty experts!”

“Yes!”

The plane was propelled by the powerful force of Wang Xian and Sui Huang. Ten minutes later, Shang Jing airport appeared in front of them.

“People are guiding us below. Let’s go down.”

Sui Huang peered somewhere below and saw a few staff members waving red flags, signaling to them!

“Go!”

Wang Xian made a swift move, and the wings behind his back disappeared. If his wings were still around at this time, he would be in the limelight.

Sui Huang also withdrew his pair of wings as they lifted the plane while walking in the air.

Gulp!

The surrounding security personnel and the airline executive below swallowed their saliva.

Two experts supported an aircraft, walking in the air. That seemed just like what deities would do.

Boom!

An aircraft that weighed a hundred tons was put down gently on the runway by two experts as everyone watched astoundedly.

“Gosh, they’re god-like humans!”

The airline executives ran towards them with fear and respect. They bowed their bodies as though they had met deities.

“Hello, two... two experts! Thank you very much!”

They did not know how to address them as they spoke frightfully.

“Okay, I’ll leave you guys to handle the remaining matters!”

Sui Huang was impatient as he saw the people from the airline. He took out his red identification card and waved to them!

“What!”

When they saw that card, their eyes could not help but narrow. All the more respect they had for him.

“Yes, Chief Leader!”

The group of airline executives responded loudly in fear and trepidation.
