Translator: 549690339

The two old men swept their surroundings with grim expressions. Then, their bodies moved and flew toward the location of the voice.

In a luxurious courtyard, a middle-aged man was hugging his father’s corpse with a face full of grief and indignation.

“Brother Qin!”

The two old men were slightly shocked. They knew the person who died. He was a famous expert of the Jade Hand Immortal sect. In the entire Yu Ding, he was also a super expert that could be ranked in the top five below immortal God.

His strength had already reached the half-step immortal God realm.

However, at this moment, the spot between his brows was directly penetrated. His eyes were wide open and filled with disbelief.

There were still no signs of a fight in the surroundings.

“A single fatal move. In the entire Yu Ding, who has the strength to kill Brother Qin with a single move? Other than the immortal God realm, who else?”

An old man said with an embarrassed expression.

“Brother Qin has just become one of the vice-leaders of netherkill, and then someone...”

As another old man spoke, he suddenly felt a little terrified.

“Not good, something big might have happened!”

The old man’s expression changed drastically. His body moved and he directly flew toward a courtyard not far away.

That was also the residence of an expert from the Jade Hand Immortal sect. At the same time, it was also the future management of netherkill group.

When he landed in the courtyard, he smelled the stench of blood.

This caused his expression to change, and he directly entered the room.

In the room, a corpse whose head had been crushed was lying there quietly.

“Not good, the sky might collapse!”

The old man’s pupils couldn’t help but shrink, and his figure flew into the distance once more.

“Gu Duan, he’s dead too?”

From behind, another old man flew over and asked with a sullen face.

“Yes, the sky might collapse. Let’s go to the residences of the other netherkill members!”

The old man’s face was filled with fear as he flew towards the residences of the netherkill members one by one.

In the end, the sky really collapsed.

“He’s dead. All the Netherkill members were killed. How is this possible? How is this possible?”

The old man’s face was filled with disbelief, and his body trembled slightly.

“There are so many experts, even half-step spirit realm experts. How can they be assassinated? This is netherkill, the strongest thousand people in the world of Yu Ding. Unless an immortal God makes a move, otherwise!”

Another old man growled in a low voice.

“Go Report to the Immortal God. I’ll go to the other five islands and take a look!”

The old man hurriedly said.

“Alright!”

The two figures moved and flew away at the fastest speed.

When the old man arrived at the other island, he discovered that the entire island had already fallen into chaos.

The deaths of the experts were discovered one by one. Everyone’s faces were filled with fear as they discussed in the surroundings.

“Boom Boom Boom!”

At this moment, six figures flew over from the sky. Two demonic young men, a strange youth, two old men, and a bewitching woman.

The six of them stood in the sky above the island, their expressions extremely unsightly.

“Netherkill members, there are still alive!”

The devilish middle-aged man with snow-white arms shouted in a low voice with a gloomy face.

His voice instantly spread across the six islands in the surrounding area.

The disciples of the Jade Hand Immortal sect and corpse Chief Dao on the island raised their heads to look at the six immortals in the sky with terrified expressions.

“But there are still alive!”

After more than ten seconds, there was no reply, the demonic youth with snow-white arms growled with an ugly expression.

Still, there was no reply.

“Dead, all dead, how is this possible, how is this possible!”

On the side, an immortal God old man was trembling, his eyes were blood red as he growled.

This was the strongest person in Yu Ding, the elites of the two immortal sects, they had the right to dominate the world in the future.

In order to nurture these top people, they even used tens of millions of people as gu to create their strongest subordinates.

Now, they were all dead.

Their ten year plan was completely destroyed!

“Lord Immortal God, there are words left in the medicinal garden here!”

At this moment, an old man in blood-red clothes said in fear.

In the sky, the figures of the six immortal gods instantly disappeared and appeared on the medicinal garden in the middle of the island.

At this moment, there were no more spiritual herbs in the medicinal garden. A line of words was written on the ground.

“Snow Demon Blood Arrow, we have returned for revenge. We want to destroy your immortal sect!”

The line of words was clearly engraved on the ground.

Seeing the words on the ground, the two demonic middle-aged men instantly revealed furious expressions.

“Snow Demon Blood Arrow, who have you provoked?”

The woman next to them stared at the words on it with an unsightly expression as she asked in a low voice.

The other three immortal gods also stared at the two with flickering eyes.

“Sect leader, all the members of netherkill were killed in one blow. Regardless of whether they were at the Dan Stage or the half-step immortal God stage, they were all killed in one blow. Some had their heads crushed, some had their vitals pierced through by sharp swords, and some were stabbed to death by dagger-like weapons!”

An elder beside him reported in a deep voice, “At least two immortal God experts and a group of infant stage experts attacked!”

“Damn it!”

The Snow Demon’s body emitted a dense black murderous aura, and its blood-red eyes shot out a terrifying light.

“We haven’t left the Ding Yu world for hundreds of years. The only immortal gods we’ve offended are the three immortal gods from half a month ago. However, one of them is already dead. The other two must have come to avenge them!”

The demonic qi on Xue Jian’s body surged, and a terrifying aura spread out in all directions.

Everyone in the surroundings lay on the ground in terror, not daring to move!

“He actually dared to barge into the Ding Yu world and kill our subordinates. I want to kill him. I want to skin him and strip him of his bones. I want to make him a slave, so that he will never be able to rise again!”

The Snow Demon raised its head, and its snow-white arms slowly turned black.

“Snow Demon Blood Arrow, just who did you provoke? You actually let the other party kill their way into our world!”

The devilish youth stared at them coldly, letting out a somewhat aged voice.

“There are three immortal-god level sea creatures in the real world, and only two of them are alive!” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Blood Arrow replied coldly.

“Sea Creatures? It was the time you were injured half a month ago!”

The bewitching woman coldly snorted and asked them.

“They dare to enter our world, kill my subordinates, and destroy our plans for more than ten years. Don’t even think about getting out!”

The Snow Demon roared furiously and didn’t answer the woman’s question.

“They left their words here and want to destroy our immortal sect. They definitely haven’t left our world yet!”

The devilish youth’s eyes flickered. “Our losses are so great now. If we can’t capture those two immortal gods, our ten-year plan will be destroyed in an instant!”

“Wind Devil, Wind Fiend, immediately head to the weakest part of the array formation. If they want to leave, they can only do so from there. Get everyone from the immortal sect to dig three feet into the ground and find them for me. I want them to enjoy all the torture in the human world!”

The eyes of the Snow Demon were filled with madness and killing intent.

“Alright!”

The two elders nodded. “The other party is an immortal god. A disciple at the core realm won’t be able to find them!”

“We’ll go look for them personally. Once we find them, we’ll immediately notify them!”
