Chapter 1352: 1352 clouds and rain fell

“Boom!”

“No, how is this possible!”

A loud sound came from the city wall of Sky Blue Island, accompanied by an old man’s shocked voice.

Hearing this familiar terrified voice, all the experts of Sky Blue Island looked towards the center of the city wall. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“This... this... My God, how could it be, how could it be like this?”

“One stick, just one stick, Lord Island owner couldn’t even block one of the opponent’s sticks!”

Everyone’s faces were filled with shock. In the center of the city wall, their island owner held a staff tightly in both hands and knelt on the ground.

The staff had been broken into two pieces. The golden ocean-pacifying needle landed on the top of his head, causing him to lose all life.

One move, just one move, and the island master of Sky Blue Island was dead!

One move, and he was reduced to ashes!

“Roar!”

At this moment, a violent roar woke everyone up, and they hurriedly looked around.

One by one, the violent demon monkeys held metal sticks in their hands and flew up the city wall, killing everyone on the city wall.

“Block, block immediately!”

Some of the sergeants were terrified as they rushed towards the demon monkeys that were charging towards them. They slashed out with their blades.

“Peng!”

However, the moment this rank 9 extraordinary sergeants clashed with a demon monkey, the terrifying power caused his body to fly backwards.

“Kill, Kill!”

The expressions of some of the experts from the families changed as they charged towards the 300 demon monkeys.

The 10,000 people on the city wall had a huge advantage against the 300 demon monkeys.

“Ah Ah, not good, their strength is so strong!”

“They are at least rank 9 transcendent demon monkeys. Oh My God, we’re finished, we’re finished!”

“The island Lord has been killed, let’s run!”

However, when everyone resisted the demon monkeys, they instantly felt the terrifying gap.

There were at least 50 to 60 half-step void interpretation realm warriors with the lowest rank 9 battle strength. Furthermore, the island Lord was already dead, what else could they use to fight?

“Kill!”

The rank 1 void interpretation realm demon monkey stood in front of the Sky Blue Island Lord’s corpse. It was a terrifying 10-meter-tall figure.

Its entire body was covered in pitch-black dragon scales. With a roar, its killing intent covered the entire island.

“I surrender, don’t kill me, don’t Kill Me!”

“My Lords, my lords, I surrender! Don’t kill me!”

The demon monkey at the first level of the profound void tier was like a violent monster from the abyss, overlooking the entire land.

Feeling its terrifying killing intent and powerful might, everyone on the Sky Blue Island was terrified.

They were completely no match for it!

The sounds of surrender and begging for mercy could be heard.

However, the killing didn’t stop, and so did the war.

They had already been given a chance to choose. They chose to die.

They wouldn’t kill the ordinary citizens who weren’t guarding the city. However, those who participated in the defense of the city wouldn’t be spared.

Soon, demon monkeys charged into the entire island one by one, plundering and plundering crazily.

At the same time, the main battle team of the Dragon Palace.

Wang Xian sat proudly on the throne and stared ahead with an indifferent gaze.

As the Dragon Palace battle team advanced, the demon monkeys, lightning prawns, and the others at the back started to scatter.

Some of them landed in the cities below while others flew towards the surrounding cities.

Each team had a maximum of 300 people.

The mission of each team was to destroy three cities quickly.

Three cities. This was a plan that Prime Minister Gui and the rest had prepared in advance. They wouldn’t wait for them to react.

The entire one leaf continent dynasty had fifteen islands and cities, and it was a huge imperial city.

Fifteen Islands and cities sent out a total of 1,500 Dragon Palace warriors and seven insightful emptiness realm experts to attack.

“Dragon King, the main city of the one leaf continent dynasty is right in front of us. There are 40 million people in the city, and their palace is in the center!”

When they arrived at the main island of the one leaf empire, there were still 1,500 soldiers in the entire expedition team.

However, these 1,500 soldiers were all elites of the Dragon Palace.

The leader of the Dragon Palace and the demon hidden in the void were all around them.

“The royal city? Its aura is even more majestic than the current Royal City of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire!”

Wang Xian looked at the huge city in front of him from afar. The city walls were four to five hundred meters tall and there were soldiers lined up neatly on top of the walls.

Prosperous and powerful!

“Get ready for battle!”

Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled as he spat out four words.

“Roar! Roar!”

The nine flood dragons in front of him sensed the Dragon King’s battle intent and roared at the sky in unison.

As a flood dragon that could fight against a third-level void interpretation realm expert, a dragon roar could be heard within a radius of a hundred kilometers.

“What is the roar of a demonic beast?”

“What Roar?”

“Which demonic beast or ferocious beast dares to step into our one leaf continent’s imperial city? !”

The sudden terrifying voice did not cause the people of the one leaf continent to panic.

On the city wall of the north gate, the soldiers and generals scanned their surroundings, their eyes filled with a cold light.

“There, there are huge creatures flying towards us!”

“Reporting to the general, there are powerful creatures invading, get ready for battle!”

“A bunch of suicidal things, get ready for battle!”

The soldiers on the city wall of the north gate were ready for battle.

They looked at the sky and could vaguely see a few huge creatures flying towards them.

From the sounds of the Dragons, they could guess that they were at the profound void tier.

However, this was not enough to make them panic.

“Whoosh! Whoosh!”

Two middle-aged men and old men in general armor appeared on the city wall within a few seconds. They looked towards the sky above the sea in the north.

“Eh?”

“Not good. The intruders are not a few fierce beasts or demon beasts, but a powerful force. Immediately report to the king that there is an enemy invasion!”

When they were 5,000 meters away, the expressions of the two generals suddenly changed. They looked at the nine huge creatures, the battle team behind them, and the black clouds that had gathered in the sky and covered an area of 5 kilometers. Their pupils constricted slightly, they hurriedly ordered the military officers behind them.

“Report to the King? Yes, yes...”

The military officers behind them were slightly stunned. A trace of shock appeared in their eyes, and they immediately reported to the direction of the palace.

At this moment, the Sun had just risen, but the approaching black clouds completely blocked out the sunlight.

The true black clouds were pressing down on the city and wanted to destroy it!

At this moment, in the palace of the one leaf dynasty, it was time for the morning dynasty.

A yellow-robed old man stood in front of the Dragon Throne, his face full of anger as he glanced at all the important officials and generals in the hall.

“The Sky Island dynasty has been attacked by other forces. Elder Wang and my daughter are missing. Immediately send someone to the Sky Island dynasty to find out their background. Immediately!”

The king of the one leaf continent said with a gloomy face, “If anything happens to my daughter, I will kill their nine families no matter what force they are!”

“Please Calm Down, your majesty. The third princess is with elder Wang. She will not be safe in the flowing sea area!”

A minister immediately bowed and said respectfully.

“Well, I don’t think they dare to do anything to my daughter. Send someone immediately...”

“Your Majesty, an unknown force has appeared outside the imperial city. They are not friendly!”
