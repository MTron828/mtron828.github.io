Chapter 1611: 1611 world-shaking 4

The fall of the Sky Demon!

The fall of Patriarch Fengchi!

With the fall of two top-notch experts and the intervention of the barbarian goddess, more than half of the land where the sect was established was destroyed.

Everything that happened today would definitely shake the entire vast region.

“Brother Wang Xian said that he will return. Is He still alive?”

At the He clan’s position, he yuan looked at the sky where the black hole had disappeared and mumbled.

“This is impossible. Wang Xian has indeed lost all his life force. Even a powerhouse in the realm of longevity would not be able to resurrect under such circumstances!”

The He clan’s elder shook his head and sighed slightly.

“The lone sect thought that they were very powerful and killed nearly 100,000 people who were cured by priest Wang. In the end, they didn’t expect that priest Wang would be so crazy!”

“Fighting with their lives. This time, the cult of solipsism suffered a terrible loss. A young master of Ao ‘Tian wanted to fight for a woman, causing the entire cult of solipsism to fall into a crisis. How Ironic!”

“The southern royal family is really miserable. They also got involved in this mess. Unfortunately, they failed to get what they wanted. Hundreds of experts and core disciples of the southern royal family were killed!”

The people of the Wuji Empire were chatting with smiles on their faces.

They were very happy to see the strength of the southern royal family and the solipsistic sect weakened.

As they spoke, they swept their eyes across the entire solipsistic sect and left.

“Let’s go. If the Sky Demon Really Falls, just as the wilderness goddess said, she will come back to take revenge. If she provokes an expert like the wilderness goddess who has a mysterious energy, the life of the solipsistic sect will not be easy in the future!”

Some factions hesitated for a moment. They looked at the ruined sect and left immediately.

After today, our sect’s strength would be greatly reduced.

Two powerful warriors from the array sect had fallen, and they had also provoked the powerful goddess of desolation. There was a high chance that our sect would fall in the future.

All the factions left, leaving behind a few hundred thousand disciples from our sect.

The supreme sect leader’s face was gloomy as he floated in the sky, breathing heavily as he looked at the collapsed peaks.

The main peak had also collapsed, leaving only twenty peaks standing in the distance.

Bing FA Wu and Bing Jing Huan stood there in a daze, their eyes a little dazed.

Their icy heart empire wanted to obtain more benefits by marrying Ling Jian ‘er to the lone sect.

In the end, the Iceheart Empire was destroyed. Originally, they still had hope of reviving their empire by relying on the soleheart sect.

Now, even their backer, the soleheart sect that they had always wanted to curry favor with, had been completely wiped out by the Sky Demon.

If it was back then...

It was a pity that it wasn’t back then.

“It’s over, it’s completely over!”

They knew that the soleheart sect no longer cared about them. The Iceheart Empire was finished, and they were also completely finished! UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“It’s all young master ao Tian’s fault. If it wasn’t for him...”

This voice sounded again around the only sect.

If it wasn’t for young master ao Tian’s lust for beauty and forcefully taking priest Wang’s lover away, things wouldn’t have fallen to such a state.

At the side, ao Tian’s body trembled when he heard this, and his expression was extremely unsightly.

Because of a woman, it almost destroyed the only sect.

“Madam Devil, why do I feel my heart beating rapidly, as if it is trying to break free from my body? I, Mo Sha, don’t want to Die!”

“Hurry and go to the god country ruins. Boss Devil has arranged for his men to wait for me there. My heart is still there!”

At this moment, Mo Sha, who had followed Lan Qingyue, screamed in fear when he passed through the black hole and appeared 10,000 meters away.

During the battle earlier, he had told Lan Qingyue to leave as soon as possible because of this reason.

The heart of Light and darkness seemed to be about to break free from his body and fly away.

F * ck, if he flew away, wouldn’t he die!

This made Mo Sha almost cry.

“What arrangements does Little Xian have?”

Lan Qingyue asked Mo Sha expressionlessly.

“Boss Mo originally ordered me to bring Miss Jian ‘er to the god country ruins after his death and then escort them to the flowing sea region!”

“Once the mission is completed, boss Mo will return the heart and give me my freedom. Now, Madam Boss MO, what do you think?”

Mo Sha said to Lan Qingyue with a bitter face.

“Let’s Go!”

Lan qingyue nodded and targeted the god country ruins.

“Look, what’s that in the Sky?”

“Did something happen inside the ruins of the Divine Kingdom?”

When the black hole appeared in the sky above the ruins of the divine kingdom, some people felt the impact of a barbaric aura and looked shocked.

“Disciples of the Dragon Palace, come here quickly!”

Little Blue’s huge figure slowly appeared. Lan qingyue floated in Little Blue’s mouth and shouted at the people below.

“It’s the Dragon Queen!”

In a manor in the divine kingdom, all the members of the Dragon Palace raised their heads and looked at Little Blue in the sky. Their eyes flashed with a bright light.

“Dragon Queen?”

“It seems to be, it seems to be the wilderness goddess!”

Sect leader Ling also raised his head. When he saw the black hole in the sky and the terrifying giant beast, his face was filled with shock.

“Sect leader Ling, it’s Our Dragon Queen. We’ll go over immediately!”

The civil officials of the Dragon Palace shouted at sect leader Ling and immediately flew into the sky.

“I know. That’s the wilderness goddess. That giant beast is the Wilderness Goddess’giant beast!”

“What a powerful giant beast. This is too powerful. What is that Black Hole?”

Shocked voices rang out in the surroundings. Everyone in the ruins of the divine kingdom looked towards the sky.

“Jian ‘er!”

Sect Master Ling flew into the sky and saw Ling Jian ‘ER’s figure. His face revealed an excited expression.

“Greetings, Dragon Empress!”

All the members of the Dragon Palace flew into the sky and immediately bowed towards Lan Qingyue.

“Return to the Dragon Palace!”

Lan Qingyue said and a black hole appeared in front of her.

“Madam Devil, Give Me Back My Heart First!”

Mo Sha held his chest and said with a bitter face.

“Buzz!”

At this moment, little blue entered the black hole and disappeared, leaving everyone in the god country ruins with shocked faces.

She reappeared more than 10,000 kilometers away.

“I can’t take it anymore. I Can’t take it anymore. My heart belongs to Madam Mo. it wants to run now. Quick, give me my heart. Madam Mo, Please!”

Mo Sha shouted loudly.

Lan Qingyue looked at the members of the Dragon Palace.

“Dig Out Our Dragon King’s heart. This heart is for you!”

Ao Yao took out Mo Sha’s heart and handed it to him.

“Okay, okay!”

Mo sha gritted his teeth and looked at his heart with a dark face. He closed his eyes and dug it out.

Buzz

After the heart of Light and darkness was dug out, it flew toward the Dragon Palace in the Liuhai region.

Lan qingyue stared at the heart that flew away with a smile on her face.

“My task has been completed. Can I leave now?”

Seeing that his heart was back, Mo sha heaved a sigh of relief and said.

“Yes!”

Ao Yao nodded and returned the heart to him according to the Order of the Dragon King!
