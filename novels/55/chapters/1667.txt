Chapter 1668: In the Panic of Fengtian City in 1668

“All Disciples of the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop come to the East Gate and fly straight here!”

The voice of a clan elder once again resounded throughout the entire Fengtian city.

“Yes!”

In the distance, the disciples of the two major forces responded.

At this point in time, the disciples of the life and Death Pill Workshop and the holy item forging workshop had already realized the seriousness of the problem.

They flew over quickly one by one. Soon, all the disciples of the two major forces in Fengtian city had gathered.

Meanwhile, the people from the other forces were approaching in surprise and bewilderment.

Slowly, millions of people gathered in the surrounding areas.

“All insightful emptiness realm experts, come to the front!”

Seeing the disciples flying over one by one, the five clan elders’faces became more and more unsightly, even with a trace of fear.

“Yes!”

One by one, the insightful emptiness realm experts flew towards a single spot.

“Oh? Why are there so few?”

“Our two great factions should have around four thousand insightful emptiness realm experts, why are there only around two thousand now!”

“What on Earth is going on? Could it be that...”

At this time, everyone’s faces revealed an embarrassed and frightened expression.

The Life and Death Pill Workshop and the holy item forging workshop had at least 4,000 insightful emptiness realm experts in Fengtian city.

However, there were only 2,000 of them now. What about 2,000?

“Could it be that they assassinated 2,000 insightful emptiness realm experts in such a short period of time? What kind of killer is this? How did they do it?”

Everyone in the surroundings looked at this scene in disbelief.

“Half of the insightful emptiness realm experts were actually assassinated, and actually, half of them were assassinated!”

The bodies of the five clan elders trembled slightly. The insightful emptiness realm experts of their two great factions each only numbered around 5,000.

Adding them together, it was only around 10,000, but now, it was actually less than one-fifth.

This was simply a huge blow to them.

“Our elders also seem to have decreased by a lot. Could it be... could it be that our elders were also assassinated? They are all insightful emptiness realm level 9 experts!”

“To be able to assassinate an elder at the ninth rank of the profound void tier, what kind of assassin is this? Could it be that the underworld assassin organization took action?”

The profound void tier experts from the two major factions looked at each other and said in a low voice.

“Clan elder, the elders of our Zhao clan have also disappeared. Clan Elder, please stand up for us!”

“Our Liantian sect’s sect master and elders have also disappeared. Our sect master is an expert at the ninth rank of the profound void tier!”

“Five elders, the experts of our mercenary group and a group of more than twenty people have also disappeared!”

At this time, a young man below spoke to the five half-step wanshou experts with a fearful expression.

Immediately after, several middle-aged young men spoke loudly.

Among these people, a portion of them were sects and clans that relied on the two great powers, and a portion of them were mercenary groups that were attracted by the rewards.

Now, many experts had disappeared.

The expressions of the five half-step wanshou experts changed drastically.

“Open the array formation and report this matter to the medicine master and Weapon Master!”

An elder of the life and Death Pill Workshop took a deep breath and said in a deep voice.

“Let’s do our best to search first!”

The five people nodded and flew toward the four directions and the center respectively.

There were five towers in the four directions and the center respectively. These towers were used to build arrays.

The five of them came to the top of the tower and took out an array compass that was emitting divine light with a solemn expression.

“Ka Ka Ka!”

The array compass was placed inside and emitted a Ka Ka Sound. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Weng!”

In an instant, a fiery red light covered the entire city.

“Boom!”

Following that, monstrous flames rose up. The entire city was like a terrifying volcano, erupting with flames.

“A ten-thousand-year-old defensive formation. Even a ten-thousand-year-old first rank expert wouldn’t be able to break in!”

“Hiss, this kind of formation has actually been activated. This formation could have been specially set up to prevent the Fire Cloud Sparrow Patriarch from attacking!”

Sounds of shock rang out from within Fengtian city.

“Everyone take a position and search with all your might. Don’t miss a single place!”

A clan elder roared!

“One-eyed demonic beast, search!”

“Caw Caw Caw!”

In the center, dozens of one-eyed demonic beasts soared into the air. An incomparably huge pupil was monitoring the entire city.

The eyes of the clan elders shot out rays of light as they scanned the entire city.

“The Assassins haven’t left our Fengtian city yet. We must capture them. Otherwise, this will be too terrifying!”

“How long has it been? They’ve killed over two thousand insightful void martial artists!”

“Not just two thousand. These two thousand are only disciples of the two major forces. There are also forces and mercenary groups. There might be three to four thousand!”

The entire Fengtian city was in a panic. Everyone looked around vigilantly.

“Hehe, as long as the Wanshou Masters don’t come, it’s impossible for them to discover me!”

Wang Xian stood in a room at the highest point of the restaurant. He held a teacup in his hand and looked at the panicking city and the five half-step Wanshou masters who were furiously searching for the killer.

They would never imagine how terrifying their enemies would be.

Currently, the strange demons were only second to the most powerful races in the universe, and there were less than ten of them.

In this extraordinary continent, no one of the same level was their match.

Time slowly passed. The five half-step Wanshou experts searched the entire Fengtian city, but they still couldn’t find any clues.

This made the five half-step wanshou experts’expressions become more and more unsightly.

“They can’t be found? Could it be the Masked Assassin Group?”

“How could it be the masked assassin group? The Life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging Workshop hired the masked Assassin Group. Although they are very strong, they aren’t as terrifying as this group of mysterious assassins!”

“It’s not just terrifying. They clearly haven’t escaped the city yet, but the five peerless experts couldn’t find their figures!”

“This, this... They won’t assassinate again, right?”

The Sky had completely darkened, but the entire Fengtian city was illuminated by the array formation.

Everyone was discussing in fear.

If the assassins couldn’t be found, would they continue to assassinate?

Even a profound void tier 9 powerhouse could disappear without a sound, let alone them?

Everyone was extremely afraid.

“If we knew, we wouldn’t have gotten involved in this mess. F * ck, what kind of terrifying killer organization did the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan hire? !”

Some of the mercenary group members revealed regretful expressions.

“All disciples gather at the center. Don’t spread out. Wait for News!”

The five half-step longevity experts ordered with an ugly expression.

All the disciples of the life and Death Pill Workshop and the holy item forging workshop immediately gathered at the center.

More than a hundred thousand people gathered together. Two half-step longevity experts stood guard at the side.

“Report this matter to the medicine master and the Weapon Master!”

The other three clan elders showed a trace of fatigue on their faces and directly entered the room.

A terrifying assassin organization suddenly appeared and actually made the two forces helpless!
