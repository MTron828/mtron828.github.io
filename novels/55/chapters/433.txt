Chapter 434: Gathering Of The Supreme Talents (3)

“I don’t care if you are from a Sacred Clan or a Sacred Sect. Just get lost and stop getting in my way!”

A disdainful voice came from Bei Wuying. He lifted his right leg straight away and swept towards Wang Xian’s head.

“That young man is finished. Young disciples these days are getting more and more arrogant!”

Seeing Bei Wuying attacking, a middle-aged man shook his head slowly.

Bam!

However, as he finished his words, a clashing sound reverberated. Everyone was taken aback and quickly looked in the direction where the sound came from.

“What? He blocked it? He blocked it with just a fan?”

“He could stop an attack from Bei Wuying? What’s the strength of that young man?”

“It can’t be! It can’t be that the young man is also an Inborn expert!”

Exclaims came from the surrounding crowd as they stared blankly at the young man who stopped Bei Wuying’s right kick with a golden fan.

Since when would any young man on the streets have such terrifying strength?

Huh?

Seeing his attack being stopped by Wang Xian and feeling the intense pain cruising from his legs, Bei Wuying was astonished and jumped back immediately!

“It seems like I have underestimated you. Now you can die!”

Bei Wuying jumped into the air and kicked towards Wang Xian’s head once again. His legs were moving so rapidly that they left afterimages.

Hehe!

Wang Xian lifted his Golden Ivory Fan and tapped towards these afterimages.

Every time he tapped, Bei Wuying’s expression turned a little more solemn as fear crept upon him.

“Shit!”

Feeling his legs going numb, he immediately retreated.

Swish!

At this moment, Wang Xian opened his Golden Ivory Fan.

As he waved his arm, a golden glow shot out from all eighteen parts of the metal structure.

“What?”

Bei Wuying was flabbergasted. Seeing the metal glows that were approaching him rapidly, he gritted his teeth and swung out his right leg with forceful wind.

Ka ka ka!

Argh!

However, the sounds of bones cracking reverberated. Bei Wuying grimaced in pain and fell to the ground.

Both of his legs were drenched in blood. In some areas, the wounds were so deep that one could even see the bone. There were even cracks that appeared on the bone.

Bam!

Bei Wuying fell heavily onto the floor. He looked fearfully towards his legs and his body was shivering.

“You... How can you be so strong?” His eyes widened and were filled with disbelief.

A young brat that popped out of nowhere was able to easily defeat him. How... How can this be possible?

“Lots of young and promising talents have emerged this year. For a preliminary Inborn expert to be so arrogant, you must be tired of living!”

Wang Xian looked at Bei Wuying, who was on the ground, with contempt and returned the same words to him.

“Time to go. Let’s go climb the mountain!”

Wang Xian turned around and flapped open the fan in his hand as he spoke to Guan Shuqing, Lan Qingyue, and the group. After which, the group strutted away as though they owned the streets.

“This... This...”

“Bei Wuying was defeated so easily! That young man is incredibly strong!”

“Who’s that young man? Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown uses a sword while that young man uses a fan. I don’t think they are the same person. Could it be that he’s the demon-like genius from the Xiao Clan?” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“He isn’t the demon-like genius from the Xiao Clan. The demon-like genius from Xiao Clan also uses a sword. Moreover, all the people from the Xiao Clan practice the fire attribute!”

“Another young Inborn expert? There are simply too many young Inborn experts that have emerged in the Underworld recently!”

The eighth-ranked talent in the Outstanding Young Heroes Competition had been easily defeated. And now, the one who defeated him was easily crushed by another young man. The Outstanding Young Heroes Competition this year was truly frightening!

Seeing the group disappearing from their sight, the crowd was still dumbfounded.

Other than some people in Southern Province, not many people in the Underworld knew what Wang Xian looked like.

Therefore, they had not managed to make the connection between the young man using a fan and Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown.

Furthermore, many demon-like talents had emerged in the Underworld recently. In their perspective, Wang Xian was just another one.

“The Outstanding Young Heroes Competition this year is indeed going to be more exciting and incredible than before!”

Wang Xian heard the comments of the crowd and couldn’t help but smirk. This was because the dragonians would give all final participants a surprise.

“Xiao Xian, let’s go to the mountain peak. The sun is setting and we can catch a glimpse of the sunset!”

Lan Qingyue and the girls rushed Wang Xian as they headed towards the peak of Huashan.

There weren’t many tourists at the various scenic spots of Huashan. The girls headed towards the highest peak enthusiastically.

When they arrived at the peak of the mountain, the sun happened to be setting.

The evening sun illuminated the entire Huashan, creating a breath-taking scene before their eyes.

“Eh, take a look there! That’s the Zhong Fang Immortal Bridge!” [1]

Suddenly, Guan Shuqing pointed in a direction as she exclaimed loudly.

At the southern cliff of Sanqing Hall on Huashan, one could vaguely spot a rainbow-like bridge. Shadows of people overlapped on the bridge as though there was a gathering of immortals.

“Zhong Fang Immortal Bridge!” Wang Xian mumbled to himself as he recalled a poem.

The incredible art of the Heavens, as though walking on the back of the rainbow. High into the sky of the birds and down to the soil of the Capital. People flocking to the extravagant palace while Deity Zijing plays the flute under the moon. When silence filled the night with loneliness, only the faint breeze could be heard.

This was the description of Zhong Fang Immortal Bridge on Huashan.

Zhong Fang Immortal Bridge was a rather mystical scenic spot of Huashan. At different times, one would see different illusions of Zhong Fang Immortal Bridge.

Why does it feel like there’s a space at that spot?

Wang Xian frowned and squinted his eyes at the Zhong Fang Immortal Bridge. His senses were telling him that there seemed to be a material spatial world in that place.

As the sun fully set, the illusions of the Zhong Fang Immortal Bridge gradually dissipated. The enthusiasm of the girls also declined accordingly.

“Let’s head back. I’m hungry!” Guan Shuqing rubbed her tummy and said with a grin.

“Alright, let’s go back!”

Wang Xian put aside his queries as he headed down the mountain with the group.

However, what happened in the competition ground of Huashan today had caused a huge ruckus in the Underworld.

[Bei Wuying, who practiced the “Northern Kick” killed Prince Jade Sword easily. The next moment, a young man with a golden fan easily crippled Bei Wuying’s legs.]

[Heavenly sounds linger! The fifth-ranked talent admits defeat to the fairy from Heavenly Sound Sect!]

[Flower Monk annihilated a first-class force instantly with his buddha beads!]

[A mysterious young man was lifted by four Half-step to Inborn experts on a carriage up Huashan!]

[The arrival of the Sacred Clan, Xiao Clan. The youngest Inborn expert in history shows himself!]

Various bit of information spread from Huashan as the people in the Underworld discussed fervently.

The experts that became known to the public because they’d fought today were enough to shock everyone, and added colors to the Outstanding Young Heroes competition this year.

The mysterious young man with golden fan, the Saintess that resembled a fairy from the Heavenly Sound Sect, the terrifying Flower Monk, the mysterious young man in the carriage and the youngest Inborn expert in history.

And the Young Lord of Sea Serpent Island who had announced he would be coming but had not shown himself.

The number of terrifying young experts had now reached six.

This was after the exclusion of the defeated Inborn expert, Bei Wuying.

As for the exact number of supreme talents that had not been discovered, no one really knew.

Nonetheless, the entire Underworld could already expect that the contest of this year’s Outstanding Young Heroes Competition would be exceptionally intense and brutal.

It would be a once in a decade festival.

No one knew who would become the champion of the younger generation!
