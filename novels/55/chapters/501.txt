Chapter 502: Lord of Sea Serpent Island

“Everyone, this way please!”

A few young men gestured to Wang Xian and the group and pointed to a mountain peak as they spoke.

“This is one of our mountains used for welcoming guests. Everyone in the Dragon Sect can stay in it for the night!”

Wang Xian nodded his head slightly as he headed in.

The group of young men didn’t follow. They smiled and watched Wang Xian and the rest walk away.

“How incredible! That twenty-year-old teenager is a Dan Realm existence and created a Sacred Sect alone!” a young man commented with envy.

“Tsk! He just got darned lucky!” the other young man by the side remarked with jealousy.

“Let’s go. Tomorrow, an alliance between the orthodox sects will be formed. In the near future, we will have to engage Diabolism in battle. At that time, please be careful, everyone!”

“Under the leadership of Dong Hua Sacred Sect, Diabolism will definitely be easily annihilated.”

A group of young men discussed enthusiastically as they walked away.

Wang Xian arrived at the tallest structure on the Guest Peak. He looked at the yard from the door before heading into his room.

“Dong Hua Sacred Sect is really something. They have a dozen-plus Guest Peaks just for welcoming their guests. A giant mountain sect was established over hundreds of mountains in this area. How majestic!”

When Wang Xian entered the yard, he looked ahead of him.

Raucous discussions reverberated from below. Wang Xian saw various sects entering with many of their disciples in awe of the mountain sect of Dong Hua Sacred Sect.

Even disciples from Sacred Sects were shocked when they entered the grounds of Dong Hua Sacred Sect.

Sui Clan was incredible and had hundreds of Siheyuan. However, they were nothing compared to the hundreds of mountains that Dong Hua Sacred Sect occupied.

“Dong Hua Mountain Range is indeed worthy of the name of the strongest force in the Underworld!”

Below the mountain where Wang Xian and the group were, some disciples of other sects exclaimed in shock.

Dong! Dong! Dong!

At this moment, the sounds of a bell ringing reverberated across the Dong Hua Sacred Sect.

The bell could be heard from all corners of Dong Hua Sacred Sect. At this moment, disciples of Dong Hua Sacred Sect came out from their mountain peaks.

Each mountain peak had a huge training field before it. Their disciples were practicing diligently in the training fields.

A soft roar reverberated across the sky of Dong Hua Sacred Sect.

Wang Xian stood on the mountain peak and looked ahead. He squinted his eyes and was a little shocked.

“The number of disciples in Dong Hua Sacred Sect is a little beyond my expectations. Seven to eight thousand disciples are distributed over forty to fifty mountains. Moreover, their strength is on average stronger than most of the Underworld!”

Even the area beneath a waterfall a long distance away was filled with disciples training.

Each and every disciple was proud of their sect.

Wang Xian looked on for a little while longer before returning to his room. He retrieved the paper that had the Art of Weapon Refining written on it and continued reading.

[Ding! Comprehended the Art of Weapon Refining.]

When he finished reading the entire illustration, the voice of the system resounded in his mind. Wang Xian’s eyes beamed with excitement.

It was just as he had expected! DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Refine All Equipment With The Origin Source Flame! It is just like the Arts of Refining Elixir Pills!

Wang Xian was exhilarated. He knew clearly how insane his Arts of Refining Elixir Pills were.

If the Arts of Equipment Refining were as incredible, it would be a piece of cake for him to craft Inborn Spiritual Weapons in the future.

“I’ve got to give it a try after getting back, and equip the entire Dragon Sect to the teeth!”

Excitement gleamed in Wang Xian’s eyes.

The night passed quickly. On the next morning, Wang Xian went down the Guest Peak at around ten in the morning.

As compared to the day before, Dong Hua Sacred Sect was livelier today. Several powerful sects and families from the Underworld were touring the place or conversing.

Wang Xian looked around and led the group of dragonians to walk around the place.

“That is...? Dragon King from the Dragon Sect!”

“He’s the Dragon King. All the disciples behind him are the disciples of Dragon Sect. I have heard that they are young. Now that I have seen it with my own eyes, they are really unreasonably young!”

“How great would it be to have such incredible strength at such a young age!”

“Annihilating the two Saint-class forces, Medical Saint Sect and Qiao Clan! The rise of the Dragon Sect was built upon the corpses of those two Saint-class forces!”

“The Dragon King is really handsome. To stand at the pinnacle of the Underworld at such a young age, he’s definitely Prince Charming in the eyes of the thousands of ladies in the Underworld!”

When the disciples of various sects saw Wang Xian, they discussed softly.

Wang Xian heard the comments from his surroundings and chuckled. He walked to the large cauldron in the middle and started curiously observing the materials used to make this cauldron.

Level 10 material! What a shame that this is just an ordinary cauldron. The creator didn’t know anything about equipment refining.

“Please make way! Please make way!”

At this moment, shouts could be heard.

“Sss. That is...”

“Who would have thought he would be here? Oh gosh! Dong Hua Sacred Sect really has its weight in the Underworld!”

“Now that every Sacred Clan and Sacred Sect is here, he’s here too!”

“The Lord of Sea Serpent Island has a feud with the Dragon King from the Dragon Sect. The Dragon Sect almost killed the son of the Lord of Sea Serpent Island previously!”

“The young lord of Sea Serpent Island is also following behind.”

Raucous discussions broke out. Wang Xian raised an eyebrow and ruthlessness gleamed in his eyes.

The previous time, that young lord of Sea Serpent Island wanted to kill him.

After he had managed to escape, Wang Xian asked Mo Qinglong to find the location of Sea Serpent Island. In the end, they couldn’t find any information.

“Father, there they are! It is that guy! It is them!”

At this moment, from the back, the young lord of Sea Serpent Island looked around proudly as he immersed himself in the fearful and respectful gazes of the crowd.

When he heard the surrounding crowd discussing softly, he looked over and his eyes were filled with anger.

He turned to his father and spoke with killing intent beaming in his eyes.

Hai Jiao had the looks of a middle-aged man and stood at approximately two meters tall. Two huge horns grew from his back and every step of his would bring strong water flowing around his body. He was just like a giant beast walking on the land.

When Hai Jiao heard his son, he turned and looked towards where Wang Xian was.

Wang Xian also turned his head over and stared coldly at Hai Jiao.

Hai Jiao didn’t say a word and walked directly towards Wang Xian.

The dozen-odd Dong Hua Sacred Sect disciples that were following frowned and immediately rushed over.

Other than that, there were ten old men behind Hai Jiao. Each and every one of them had savage killing intent circling them as though they were beasts.

They were all staring at Wang Xian and didn’t bother to hide their killing intent.

“You are the so-called Dragon King?”

Hai Jiao walked to Wang Xian. His face was covered with hair and emotionless, and he questioned Wang Xian in a deep voice.

Wang Xian stared at Hai Jiao and smirked. “Are you here with your son to apologize?”
