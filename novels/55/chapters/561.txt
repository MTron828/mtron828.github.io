Chapter 562: Doubting One’s Existence

“The Dragon King is pretty strong. Using his water clone to control the Sword Edge, he easily broke through Senior Brother Kong’s water clone.”

“He’s pretty strong but it is going to end soon. Senior brother Kong has gotten serious. He has even started using his Ten Tiers Blade!”

Over five hundred disciples hovered in the air on their swords around the battle. When the battle started, they had stopped discussing as they watched attentively.

Seeing Wang Xian’s attack, the surrounding disciples were shocked.

However, that remained as such.

Senior brother Kong had gotten serious. If the Dragon King was simply what the rumors had mentioned, there would be no uncertainty in this battle.

Every single disciple that was in the top twenty was insanely powerful.

“Break!”

Kong Guanglin shouted as he swung his longsword onto the Sword Edge.

“Instant Shift!”

Seeing Kong Guanglin’s attack, Wang Xian shimmered in blue light.

Weng!

Instant Shift! Where there was water, one could erupt with twice the speed that he typically could achieve.

When Kong Guanglin slashed at the Sword Edge, Wang Xian’s body merged with his water clone.

Bam!

The Sword Edge was crushed by Kong Guanglin. However, before he could even get excited, a sword scabbard landed on his chest.

Bam! Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“What?”

Kong Guanglin’s eyes widened in disbelief as he started spewing blood uncontrollably.

Wang Xian walked silently to Kong Guanglin and looked down on him. Creating a rope out of water, he took the longsword in Kong Guanglin’s hands away.

He also took the bag of approximately two hundred spiritual stones away.

“YOU... You...”

When Kong Guanglin saw Wang Xian taking away his spiritual stones and spiritual longsword, he felt greatly humiliated.

“Thank you!”

Wang Xian looked at him and spoke plainly. Subsequently, the longsword he retrieved went below his legs as he took off into the sky.

Swish!

Wang Xian left the place with the crowd completely dumbfounded.

Sss!

The surrounding disciples gasped in astonishment as they stared blankly at Kong Guanglin, who was still on the floor.

“He just lost?”

“Kong Guanglin has just lost? Isn’t that a little too darned simple?”

“Is this considered a move or two? Freak... The Dragon King...”

“It isn’t just us who are feeling overwhelmed. Even Kong Guanglin must be feeling a little overwhelmed currently. Look. His eyes are dead!”

“As the twentieth-ranked disciple, he didn’t even manage to last two moves. The Dragon King is indeed strong. The question is how strong he really is.”

“Damn! He’s too strong. When he challenged the other disciples during the day, not a single mountain sect lasted more than ten seconds. Even Kong Guanglin met the same outcome. I believe his strength would easily place him within the top ten supreme talents!”

“Where did this monster come from? What he just used was probably Sword Edge and perhaps Instant Shift. His speed exploded by several times. It was so fast that I didn’t even catch a glimpse of him moving!”

When Wang Xian’s figure disappeared completely from sight, exclamations broke out from the surroundings.

In the arena, Kong Guanglin stood up gradually. He still looked a little out of sorts.

Did I just lose?

“I wasn’t careless just now and yet I lost. His strength...”

Kong Guanglin lifted his head and looked in the direction where the figure had disappeared. Suddenly, a helpless feeling welled up within him.

When he first heard of the name of the Dragon King today, he had snorted with contempt.

When he saw the so-called Dragon King entering the Scripture Depository, he wanted to teach him a lesson right away.

However, he would have never expected this outcome.

Ten seconds?

Perhaps not even that.

Around him, when the disciples saw the desolation in Kong Guanglin’s eyes, they were even more astonished.

The twentieth-ranked supreme talent in Da Hong Immortal Sect was beaten so completely that he started doubting his life.

He didn’t speak of having a second match ambitiously and he didn’t lower his head with shame.

Instead, he started doubting his life?

“The Dragon King will truly be on the rise after this. If he could defeat Kong Guanglin so easily, he would definitely be considered among the ranks of the supreme talents of Da Hong Immortal Sect. Similarly, he will definitely make it to the top ten!” a middle-aged man remarked emotionally while envy beamed in his eyes.

After this incident, there would probably not be a single person who would say the Dragon King was a pushover.

Once again, a shining disciple had appeared within the Immortal Sect.

“Great, great. With this level of talents, he isn’t any inferior to the top three disciples!”

“Hehe! Our Da Hong Immortal Sect is really lucky to have a disciple like him appearing at this juncture. Although the Underworld outside is really trashy, we will still have to compete with the other nine cauldron worlds.”

“Having a supreme talent disciple will definitely be a positive thing. With his strength, it is almost certain that he will rank in the top ten!”

“Yeah, that’s about right. Sword Edge, Water Clone and Instant Shift... Is he a disciple that Mt. Fengyu has been secretly grooming?”

At the peak of Martial Peak, two old men were playing chess. They looked down and commented with a smile.

...

Two hundred spiritual stones. I wonder what I could buy with spiritual stones in this world. Also, this Level 10 Inborn spiritual sword can be sold too. I wonder how much it is worth in spiritual stones! Wang Xian thought to himself.

He looked in the direction of Mt. Fengyu and flew directly towards it.

“The reward today was really pathetic. I only got a single spiritual stone!”

“I didn’t even get one!”

“The spiritual stones in the spiritual ore mine are getting fewer and fewer. We’ve got to think of other ways to earn spiritual stones soon!”

“Where are you thinking of going? Could it be you are thinking of heading to Yong Chang City to work? Would you even be able to get ten spiritual stones in a month? To buy Level 5 spiritual medicine, you would need two to three hundred spiritual stones!”

“Have you guys forgotten that Senior brother Wang Xian has raised the ranking of our Mt. Fengyu to eleven? Each of us will at least be getting twenty spiritual stones for the coming month!”

“Oh ya! I had almost forgotten about this. Haha! It’s great to have Senior brother Wang Xian around!”

Just as Wang Xian arrived at Mt. Fengyu, he heard the conversation between the six disciples from Mt. Fengyu.

Spiritual ore mine? Earning spiritual stones?

Wang Xian sank into deep thought. Spiritual stones could be used to enhance cultivation. The speed of cultivation using spiritual stones would be four to five times that of ordinary cultivation.

However, cultivation using spiritual stones was highly exhaustive. A spiritual stone would not even last for an entire day of cultivation. Therefore, few disciples were willing to use them for training.

“Hey guys!” Wang Xian looked at the six disciples and shouted.

“Huh? Hey, Senior brother Wang Xian! What can we do for you?”

When the six disciples saw Wang Xian, they replied with respect and anxiety.

“Where can I find the spiritual ore mine? Where else could I earn spiritual stones?” Wang Xian asked.

“Oh? Spiritual ore mine? The spiritual stone mine can be found behind our Da Hong Immortal Sect. However, it has been excavated for more than a thousand years. There is almost nothing left in it.”

A male disciple answered in a hurry. Soon, he continued, “To earn spiritual stones and resources, you can also head to Yong Chang City to look for a job other than excavating the spiritual ore mine. With Senior brother Wang Xian’s strength, you will be able to get twenty to thirty spiritual stones per month as a mentor!”

“Yong Chang City? Are there any equipment refining or elixir pill refining shops in the city?”

“Yeah! If Senior brother knows how to refine equipment or elixir pills, it will be even easier to earn spiritual stones. Senior brother, why don’t we bring you to Yong Chang City for a tour?”

“No thanks! It’s alright!”
