Chapter 348: National Treasury

“Come out!”

As Wang Xian waved his arm, streams of dense dragon energy flowed towards the heart of Ancient God Kun Breeder and surrounded the drop of blood.

A drop of fiery red was pulled out of the corpse.

The drop of blood was moving vigorously as if it was in fear and horror.

Wang Xian looked at the small drop of blood from the Ancient God Kun Breeder. This could very well be the last of its kind.

“There is still the presence of intelligence in the blood! Are these the memories of this corpse?”

Wang Xian looked at the shimmering drop of blood. He moved his hand and ejected dragon energy to erase the lingering spirit in it.

“Argh! This is the only bloodline of the Ancient God that remains! I’m not convinced! Our clan shall live on for eternity!”

A wretched voice rang in Wang Xian’s mind suddenly. He was stunned.

“How terrifying!” Wang Xian sighed as he looked at this droplet of blood.

Rumble!

At this instant, the corpse beside him started cracking and was eventually reduced to ashes

[Essence Soul of The Ancient God Breeder: Level ???

Extraction of dragon energy not possible.]

“Essence Soul? “When Wang Xian received information about this drop of blood, he was taken aback. Essence soul? Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“An Essence Soul is a combination of the essence blood and the soul. In other words...!”

A thought struck Wang Xian suddenly and he was thrilled.

Inheritance, this is an inheritance!

Wang Xian’s body couldn’t help but tremble with excitement. This was the inheritance of the Ancient God Kun Breeder. If one was to absorb this drop of blood, one would have a high chance of becoming a member of the Ancient Gods and the last Ancient God Kun Breeder in the entire universe.

“It’s no surprise that the last words of the voice were ‘Our clan shall live on forever!’ So this explains it!”

Wang Xian mumbled to himself as he was filled with anticipation and excitement.

Consuming this Essence Soul will allow one to inherit the bloodline of the Ancient God Kun Breeder and become a member of the Ancient Gods. It’s a shame that I already have the bloodline of the divine dragon and hence cannot consume it. I can give this...

Wang Xian started considering who he should give this to.

This was a priceless item. Therefore, he would only give it to his closest kin or friends or his subordinates like the dragonians.

“Let’s leave this place first!”

Wang Xian put the Essence Soul away and moved like a phantom towards the temporary base.

“Huh? Why is everyone gathered here?”

From afar, Wang Xian noticed that the temporary base was brightly illuminated. All the experts were either standing on top of the tents or levitating in the air.

Wang Xian made a detour and appeared beside Sun Lingxiu.

“Why is everyone gathered here? What are they looking out for?” Wang Xian asked Sun Lingxiu with a bright smile.

“No one dares to head in that direction. The tremors from the battles ahead were too shocking. Xiao Xian, you are really incredible! Have you settled everything?” she asked.

Sun Lingxiu also possessed the divine dragon’s bloodline currently and practiced the Light Divine Dragon Transformation. She knew that Wang Xian had been involved in the battle previously.

“It’s settled. I believe we should be able to head back tomorrow!” Wang Xian smiled and looked around him.

The crowd of experts gathered to discuss the battle ahead of them. Even though the commotion had died down, no one dared to head over.

Although this happened at midnight, no one was feeling sleepy. They had gathered and were discussing the situation fervently.

On the other hand, Wang Xian was very relaxed and wasn’t tense like the others. He returned to his room to take his rest.

On the next morning, Wang Xian learned that the middle-aged man in military uniform had led some soldiers to recce around the Yellow River in the wee hours of the day.

In the end, he brought back the good news that all the mutated creatures had vanished, including those that might be hiding within the Yellow River.

They found the corpses of some mutated creatures in the river.

This shocked everyone in the base but they were relieved at the same time.

The crowd recalled the horrifying battle that had occurred at midnight. Perhaps other creatures had killed those mutated creatures or chased them away.

“Miracle Doctor Sun, this is your reward!”

“Miracle Doctor Blood Man and Miracle Doctor Wang, thank you for your assistance in this mission! Both of you will get entry into the National Treasury!”

At noon, a soldier entered the tent and spoke to them.

“Thank you!” Sun Lingxiu received a jade box and smiled. As for Miracle Doctor Blood Man, he stood by the side and laughed out of ecstasy.

The soldier handed Wang Xian a gold medal and his personal information was recorded on it. With this medal, he would be able to enter the National Treasury to pick an item of his liking.

“Master, this item is my tribute to you!”

Miracle Doctor Blood Man received the gold medal and handed it over to Sun Lingxiu respectfully.

“Xiao Xian, you can have it!” Sun Lingxiu received the gold medal and gave it to Wang Xian.

“You can hold it now. When the time arrives, we can enter the National Treasury together. There might be something you need in there!” Wang Xian looked at her and said with a bright smile.

“Oh, alright! Let’s enter the place together!” Sun Lingxiu smiled radiantly as she played with her hair.

Wang Xian was taken aback slightly, smiling as he left the tent.

Sun Lingxiu looked at Wang Xian with adoration and respect. Subsequently, she followed behind Wang Xian.

“Miracle Doctor Blood Man and Miracle Doctor Wang, let me get my guys to bring you to the National Treasury.”

When the trio walked out of the tents, the middle-aged man in military uniform walked over with a relieved smile.

Although the incident of the Yellow River had ended abruptly, he was relieved.

“Alright!” replied Wang Xian with a nod.

“National Treasury! You could at least get an Inborn Spiritual Weapon in it.”

“Only Miracle Doctor Wang and Miracle Doctor Blood Man are allowed to enter the National Treasury. This mission must have been a great deal for them!”

“Miracle Doctor already has an Inborn Spiritual Weapon. If he gets another, he would have two! This is already comparable to a Sacred Sect!”

“Miracle Doctor Blood Man is clearly the servant of the Miracle Doctor Holy Goddess and she has an ambiguous relationship with Miracle Doctor Wang. After their trip to the National Treasury, they will have three Inborn Spiritual Weapons. Oh gosh!”

The crowd heard the conversation between the middle-aged man in military uniform and Wang Xian’s group. They couldn’t help but be envious of Wang Xian and Miracle Doctor Blood Man.

“Damn rascal!”

A short distance away, Bian Yaoquan clenched his fist tightly. The rights to enter the treasury would have been his. However, it was snatched away by that rascal!

He stared at the trio, including Sun Lingxiu, with a vengeance. He had noted down his hatred in his mind!

That woman was the first who dared to chide him and chase him away.

“They are going to have three Inborn Spiritual Weapons among them!”

Dense murderous intent gleamed in Bian Yaoquan’s eyes. He pulled a long face and turned to the Poison Duo beside him.

The Poison Duo shifted their attention from Wang Xian and saw the expression of their young master. They immediately understood his intentions.

“Their group is rather strong. We will need at least six Inborn experts to be safe!” the Poison Duo commented coldly after pondering.

“Young master, should we ask our men from the sect?” asked Old Du with a sinister expression.

“Our guys from the sect? No, this won’t do. I must definitely achieve something to show my parents for this training trip!”

Bian Yaoquan sank into deep thought. As he turned and looked across his surroundings, he noticed many other experts staring greedily at Wang Xian and his group. A thought struck him immediately.
