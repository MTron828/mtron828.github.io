“An lie!”

After learning that there was a powerful grotto-heaven blessed land in the river of eternity, Wang Xian was prepared to go over and take a look.

“Dragon King!”

An lie teleported over and cupped his hands at him.

“Go to the river of eternity immediately and bring me there.”

Wang Xian instructed him.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

An lie nodded immediately and disappeared immediately.

“It will only take one to two days for an lie to get there. If the experts from the Alliance of 100 cities want to exterminate the Dragon Palace, it might take a few months.”

Wang Xian mumbled and continued to help the great mill of five elements and the Yin-yang dragon plate absorb the treasures to improve themselves.

Two days later, an Lie’s figure returned to the Dragon Palace.

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian opened his eyes and disappeared under an Lie’s coverage.

When they reappeared, they had already arrived at the river of eternity.

Wang Xian scanned his surroundings and immediately flew toward the center of the river of eternity.

His speed was very fast. After dozens of hours, they arrived at the center.

This place was the center of the battle between the Water Touch King and the Baili Archangel not long ago.

That battle had also shocked Wang Xian.

It was a strange innate treasure with a terrifying destructive power!

“It’s at the bottom of the center. There’s an entrance there. The entrance is blocked and there’s no way to enter.”

The king of water touch pointed to a location and said to Wang Xian.

Wang Xian nodded and flew away immediately.

The previous battle did not cause much change in the river of eternity.

The water in the sky continued to fall.

The only difference was that there seemed to be fewer dire beasts in the surroundings. They should have fled into the distance.

Or they might have been killed by the angel race.

Wang Xian came to the lowest position. Under the command of the King of water touch, he saw an entrance with a diameter of 10,000 meters.

The entrance was filled with blue light. It was as if one could enter another world.

“An lie, you go in. Be careful.”

Wang Xian instructed an lie.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

An lie nodded. He looked at the entrance and his figure disappeared.

When the king of water tentacles saw an lie disappear, he was deep in thought.

Buzz

Two seconds later, an Lie’s figure returned.

“Dragon King, it’s dead silent inside. There are only some skeletons on the ground.”

An lie reported to Wang Xian.

“Bring me in.”

Wang Xian nodded. The next moment, he entered the interior of the grotto-heaven blessed land under the guidance of an lie.

A stream of water energy that was more majestic than the outside world was transmitted over. Wang Xian took a look inside.

At this moment, there were many ancient buildings in the interior. The buildings were somewhat dilapidated.

It was obvious that there were signs of battle.

There were many corpses on the ground. Only bones were left behind. It was as though they had been dead for a very long time.

The interior of this paradise was not very big. It was about the size of three to four dragon palaces.

However, such a place was still too small for a race.

“It could be that living in this narrow space for a long time has triggered an internal conflict among the race.”

Wang Xian mumbled and made a guess.

If it was any other powerhouse who lived in such a narrow space for a long period of time, they would also be driven crazy.

The same was true for the Tianshui race. They were squeezed here and could not see the sun, which triggered an internal conflict.

Wang Xian shook his head and flew around the surroundings. A satisfied expression appeared on his face.

“System, establish a Dragon Palace!”

With a thought in his mind, one resource after another flew forward. A small dragon palace that was weaker than the main dragon palace was built very quickly.

Wang Xian smiled and entered the Dragon Palace directly.

The Dragon Palace had a teleportation formation. However, in this sealed paradise, the teleportation formation would be blocked.

In other words, teleportation could not be carried out.

However, there was still an lie.

The demon spirit altar could ignore such rules.

After setting up a demon spirit altar, an lie brought Wang Xian back to the main dragon palace immediately.

“Very good. Even if the real main dragon palace is in danger, it can teleport instantly.”

A smile appeared on his face. The current Dragon Palace could be said to be 100% safe.

“With that powerful grotto-heaven blessed land, the Dragon Palace has the qualifications to fight against the Hundred Cities Alliance.”

His eyes flickered slightly and revealed a sinister look.

“First, I will completely upgrade the Tai Chi Dragon Plate of the great mill of the five elements.”

Wang Xian muttered to himself.

Time passed day by day. The appearance of the Dragon Palace was still in an uproar within the mainland.

Countless disciples of the Hundred Cities Alliance said that the Dragon Palace was simply courting death and would definitely be destroyed by them.

Regarding this, the disciples of the other races also silently agreed.

During this period of time, everything about the dragon palace had been dug out.

The Dragon Palace might have improved very quickly, with the Dragon King and the other experts, but the hundred cities alliance was even stronger.

It was so strong that even the ancestral dragon lineage had to care about the Hundred Cities Alliance.

The Hundred Cities Alliance had already given the order to kill, so the Dragon Palace was most likely doomed.

In the ocean in the mountains and seas, 23 terrifying figures stood quietly on the body of a desolate beast.

This was a desolate beast that was like a sharp sword.

Its body was flat, its wings were extremely sharp, and its head and mouth were flat and sharp.

The entire desolate beast gave off a terrifying blade aura. Golden and green light surrounded its surroundings, and its speed was abnormally terrifying.

This was the universe ruler level two desolate beast, Jin Fengxi. This was the name of the desolate beast.

Its name was very special, but it was a terrifying existence.

Twenty-three powerful figures stood on it and shuttled across the sky above the ocean.

Before some seabirds could sense them, they flew over directly.

“Phew, the Five Elements Millstone and the Tai Chi Dragon Plate have finally improved!”

A month and a half later, in the Dragon Palace, Wang Xian smiled when he saw that the two treasures had been upgraded.

The Five Elements Millstone was about the same level of strength as Wang Xian himself, but the Tai Chi Dragon Disc was still one realm lower. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

He took out the universal AI and searched for some information.

He couldn’t help but smile when he saw the discussions within the mainland and the comments from some of the strong disciples of the Hundred Cities Alliance.

Everything had just begun.

“Eight-limbed demonic fiend!”

He shouted softly and his voice entered the ears of the eight-limbed millstone.

At this moment, after more than a month, the eight-limbed demonic fiend and the rest had already received an upgrade.

This time, they had obtained five level one battle-power corpses of universe overlords, and three members of the poisonous horned dragon species had been upgraded to level one battle-power of universe overlords.

Two of the thorned dragon species had been upgraded to level one battle-power of universe overlords.

“I’m Here!”

Soon, they flew over and bowed to Wang Xian.

“Get an lie to bring you to the Dragon Palace in the river of eternity. Then, lock onto the target and invade the Hundred Cities Alliance.”

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered as he gave the order.

“It’s the Dragon King. I promise to complete the mission.”

The eight-limbed demonic fiend licked his lips and revealed an excited expression.

The last time, their venom horned dragon species was able to cause the fall of the four cities without any improvement. Now, it was even easier for them.

They could even rely on their venom horned dragons to occupy the cities bit by bit.
