Chapter 911: 0912, who is trash?

Translator: 549690339

When the young man saw the guard staring at him coldly not far away, he looked a little embarrassed.

Obviously, he knew that the guard had noticed his small actions just now.

A few young men at the side winked at him, telling him not to stir up trouble.

“HMPH, a two-star bronze rank trash mercenary group. You better not let me find a chance!”

The young man stared at Wang Xian coldly. His tone was filled with threat.

“How dare a one-star Silver Mercenary Group Act so impudently?”

Ao Jian, who was at the side, heard the young man’s insult and stared at him coldly.

“That’s right. It’s just a one-star silver mercenary group. You Don’t have the right to talk about others like that!”

Suddenly, a girl came from behind.

Several young men turned their heads with gloomy faces and looked at the girl who spoke.

The girl was in her twenties and thirties. Her looks were average, but she had short hair. She looked valiant and valiant. She wore a leather armor with blood stains on it.

The mercenary group badge on the girl’s chest was a 4-star silver mercenary group.

The girl spoke with hatred.

“Cough! We are students of the Demon Hunters Academy. The mercenary group is only 1-star silver mercenary group now, but it won’t be long before we can reach gold-rank!”

The young man looked at the girl and said with a sullen face.

“So you are students of the Demon Hunters Academy. My Daughter is not sensible. Please don’t mind her! I apologize on behalf of my daughter!”

A middle-aged man next to the girl heard the words of the young men and his expression changed slightly. He quickly said to the young men.

“Humph!”

The young men snorted coldly. They were too embarrassed to argue with a girl.

The female student was a little indignant and wanted to say something, but she was stopped by the middle-aged man.

When the female student suddenly opened her mouth, the group of young men became embarrassed and stopped talking. They waited quietly.

The speed of handing in the mission wasn’t very fast. Wang Xian waited in line for half an hour before it was his turn.

After handing over the badge of the mercenary group, Wang Xian said directly, “Hand in the mission!” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

The waiter took the mercenary group badge and checked the mission that Wang Xian had accepted.

“Eh? Bring Me the mission item!”

The waiter looked at Wang Xian in astonishment.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian handed over an interspatial ring.

The waiter took the interspatial ring and opened his eyes wide. “Sir, please wait for a moment. I will count it for you!”

The waiter was shocked and his tone was filled with respect.

“Please hurry up. Why is the speed here so slow?”

The waiter took the interspatial ring for about two minutes. A few young men at the back urged him in annoyance, “How many missions can a two-star bronze mercenary group take? Why is it so slow?”

The waiter raised his head and looked at the young men at the back coldly. Then, he looked at Wang Xian with a smile and said, “Sir, your mercenary group has been upgraded. I will change your badge for you!”

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded and passed all the badges to him. He reminded him, “Overlapping missions. Priority is given to Phoenix immortal pills and weapons workshop.”

“Alright!”

The waiter nodded and said, “Sir, please wait for a moment!”

“Sure!”

Wang Xian nodded his head faintly and walked to the side to wait.

“It’s finally our turn!”

The few young men at the back glanced at Wang Xian coldly and muttered. They walked forward and threw their badges over. “Hand in the mission!”

The waiter nodded his head lightly. He checked the badge and muttered softly, “You’re still so arrogant after completing a 3-star silver-grade mission!”

“Huh?”

Obviously, all the extraordinary experts present could hear it clearly.

This caused the expressions of the few young men to turn ugly. They asked in a low voice, “After completing this mission, you should be able to advance to 2-star silver-rank, right?”

“Yes, Bring the badge over. I’ll exchange it for you!”

The attendant said indifferently.

“Hurry Up!”

The few young men urged impatiently.

“We can’t!”

This female attendant might have had her period, or she might have seen that they were a little annoyed, so she directly rebuked them.

“That gentleman has completed ten missions. Now, he can even wait to advance to three-star silver tier. Why are you all in such a hurry?”

The attendant said sarcastically.

“What?”

The young man was slightly taken aback and his face was full of astonishment.

“You guys, you should keep a low profile, understand?”

At this moment, a staff member inside handed the newly made badge to the attendant.

The staff member took it and patted the badge in his hand. He glanced at them and looked at Wang Xian. “Sir, your badge is ready!”

“Thank you!”

Wang Xian nodded with a smile on his face.

“No need, no need!”

The staff member quickly smiled and said. Then, he looked at the few young men with a straight face. “Look, they are a three-star silver mercenary group!”

“What? How is this possible? He was clearly a two-star bronze-star just now!”

The few young men were stunned. They widened their eyes in disbelief.

“How is this not possible? He handed in five four-star bronze-star missions directly. Five five five-star bronze-star missions, three five-star silver-star missions, and two four-star silver-star missions. Humph, quickly move aside and wait at the side!”

The waiter said impatiently to the few young men.

Wang Xian passed the badges to the Golden Swordfish and the rest. He played with them for a while and the corners of his mouth curled up slightly. He looked at the few young men mockingly.

“It’s only a two-star silver mission, Trash!”

He said faintly and wore the badges on his chest.

His contemptuous tone and mocking behavior made the few young men’s faces extremely awkward.

Just a moment ago, they had mocked the other party for being only a 2-star bronze mercenary group, but damn it, they actually advanced to 3-star silver in an instant.

This... This was simply flying. How could a mercenary group advance so quickly?

Their mercenary group was a mercenary group created by the Academy’s 50th strongest person. It took them three years to reach 2-star silver.

However, the other party actually surpassed them in an instant.

Furthermore, they actually completed the mission of 5-star silver-grade. 5-star silver-grade! They had to hunt at least level five supernatural beasts and demonic beasts!

“Haha, How Interesting!”

At this moment, the laughter of the girls could be heard from the side.

The faces of the few young men changed drastically. They lowered their heads in shame.

Wang Xian didn’t bother with the few young men. He could just slap them in the face. There was no need to bother with this bunch of clowns!

The mission reward was placed in his interspatial ring. There was no problem with that.

“Wang Xian, right?”

Just as Wang Xian walked to the door, shadows blocked his way.

Twenty to thirty people blocked the entrance and stared at them coldly.

Wang Xian raised his head and stared at the group of people in front of him with a twinkle in his eyes.

“The Mirage Sea mercenary group!”

“They are blocking our way. I wonder what’s Going On!”

Wang Xian raised his head slightly and looked at the old man who was standing in the middle. He was the leader of the Mirage Sea mercenary group.

“We are a small team. Five days ago, they contacted us for the last time. At that time, they bumped into you guys. I want to ask about their current situation!”

The leader of the Mirage Sea mercenary group stared at Wang Xian expressionlessly.
