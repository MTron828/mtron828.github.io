Chapter 1073: 1074 commander-in-chief

Translator: 5496903

“The forces of East Sea city can no longer be moved!”

Vice Commander Meng’s face darkened, and he said slowly, “The ocean corps can only send out one riding wind battle team at most, and the rest must defend East Sea city.”

“Then... then Sir General...”

“Unless there is an order from the king, Sir General can not move!”

Vice Commander Meng looked at the high-level officials of holy sea town. “To deal with this crisis, we can only rely on our strength. As long as the other side doesn’t have a profound void level existence, it’s not like we can’t defend the town!”

“Vice regiment commander Meng, you can make the arrangements. Holy Sea town can not be destroyed!”

Jin Qianyuan said firmly with a pale face.

Once holy sea town was destroyed, at least hundreds of thousands of people would die.

Moreover, if the town was destroyed, they could only flee to East Sea city. Who knew how many people would die on this journey.

Most importantly, holy sea town had already accepted five to seven hundred thousand people from West arrival town.

If more than a million people poured into East Sea city, East Sea city wouldn’t be able to accept it.

If they were displaced, who knew how many people would lose their lives in the wild.

West sea town had already been destroyed, so holy sea town couldn’t be destroyed.

Otherwise, the number of people who died would be twice that of West Sea town.

“Yeah, East Sea city can’t allow more than a million people to enter. Otherwise, it would be a disaster for East Sea City!”

Vice regiment commander Meng’s face darkened. “There’s only one way now. We have to destroy another beast race!”

“Vice regiment commander Meng, are you going to destroy another one?”

Jin Qianyuan frowned slightly.

“That’s right. If we destroy another one, we can completely rely on the city walls and the array formation to defend against it!”

Vice regiment commander Meng nodded and swept his gaze over the group of people. “This time, I’ll lead the riding wind battle team over. The three great academies will coordinate with the strength of your holy sea town to deal with the potential threats around Holy Sea Town!”

“This is the only way. The safety of holy sea town will depend on deputy leader Meng from now on!”

Jin Qianyuan nodded his head.

“What threats are there around Holy Sea Town?”

Wang Xian, who was listening from the side, frowned slightly and asked directly.

Jin Qianyuan looked at Wang Xian with a hint of surprise in his eyes.

“This student Wang’s command and insight is very strong. You can leave some matters of holy sea town to student Wang to command!”

Deputy leader Meng looked at Wang Xian and said with a smile.

“Wang Xian!”

Jin Liuyan, who had been taking care of her father, looked at Wang Xian with a hint of surprise in her eyes.

“Leader Wang, I didn’t expect this!”

Jin Qianyuan also looked at Wang Xian in surprise. He had a very deep impression of this young man.

He was the leader of the Celestial Phoenix mercenary group. The last time when the monsters attacked the city, he became famous in one battle.

“Wang Xian is a student of our demon Hunter College. He has the strength of a transcendent-level rank-7. His command and insight are very strong. vice-leader Meng will lead the soldiers to destroy them. The problem of Shenghai town will be solved by the three major colleges and the experts of Shenghai Town!”

A teacher of the Demon Hunter College said.

The other two teachers nodded as well.

“Alright!”

Jin Qianyuan and the President of the mercenary association nodded.

“I’ll lead my men to deal with a race of ferocious beasts first. I’ll leave the matters here to you guys!”

Deputy leader Meng stood up and spoke to them before walking out.

In the hall, there were only the three major colleges and the group of high-ranking officials from Shenghai Town left.

“According to the information we received, a group of demonic beasts are preparing to fish in troubled waters. They are controlling some ferocious beasts and are preparing to attack Shenghai Town!”

Jin Qianyuan looked at them, his gaze landed on Wang Xian. “Not long ago, Shenghai town experienced a siege by monsters. The eight-eyed eel was behind it. However, we didn’t manage to destroy them the last time!”

“The strongest strength of the eight-eyed eel is at level eight transcendence. However, there are about ten level eight transcendents in this demonic beast race. To us, it is also very troublesome. In order to prevent this demonic beast race from fishing in troubled waters, it is best to get rid of them. Even if we can’t get rid of them, we can’t let them form an army of ferocious beasts!”

“Do you have any detailed information on the eight-eyed eel? We can send someone to clean up the eel!”

Wang Xian looked at Jin Qianyuan and asked directly.

“We don’t have any specific information. However, if they want to control a race of ferocious beasts, we can easily find them.”

“There are strange movements of ferocious beasts in the seamounts 70 kilometers east of Shenghai Town!”

Jin Qianyuan shook his head and said.

“Then we will send people over. All the students of the three academies will be mobilized. How many experts can be mobilized in Your Holy Sea Town?”

The long-bearded elder of East Sea Academy asked.

“One transcendent rank 8, four rank 7, ten rank 6, and thirty rank 5!”

Jin Qianyuan said.

“So weak?”

Several instructors frowned slightly.

“That’s enough. Call all of them. With our strength, we can totally deal with them!”

Wang Xian nodded his head. In fact, he could destroy the eight-eyed eel just by relying on the strength of his subordinates.

“Yeah, with our strength, we can do it too.”

The teachers nodded their heads. Their goal was not to destroy the eight-eyed eel, but to prevent them from forming a ferocious beast race.

“Alright, thank you, everyone. Who will be in charge of this operation?”

The President of the mercenary association nodded and looked at the few teachers.

There were four level eight powerhouses present, but the operation this time required a commander.

“Let me do it. Gather everyone and act immediately!”

Wang Xian stood up and said.

“Alright!”

The three instructors of the demon hunter college nodded immediately. Director Qian hesitated for a moment before nodding.

“Alright!”

The two elders from the East Ocean College and the Ocean College hesitated for a moment before nodding. They had witnessed Wang Xian’s scouting and commanding skills and had a better understanding of him not too long ago.

A level seven extraordinary student had eleven level seven extraordinary subordinates. He had the ability to be the commander this time.

Moreover, Wang Xian was the commander that even the vice-captain of the ocean cultivators corps had to obey.

“Huh?”

The President of the hiring association was a little surprised, but he still nodded. He looked at Wang Xian with a smile and said, “To be able to get vice-captain Meng’s admiration and the approval of the teachers, everyone in our holy sea town will also listen to our little brother’s command!”

“Alright, let’s set off then. Gather Everyone!”

Wang Xian nodded.

“Wang Xian, you can do it!”

At this moment, Jin Liuyan looked at Wang Xian and clenched her fists at her.

“Okay!” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Wang Xian smiled and gestured to the teachers of the Demon Hunters Academy. Then, he walked toward the place where the students were resting.

“Liuyan, do you know him?”

As he watched the group of people leave, Jin Qianyuan looked at his daughter and asked with a smile.

“Yes, I know him. The last time we went to East Sea City, Yuan Yuan hired the immortal Phoenix mercenary group. He is so powerful that even the instructors of the Demon Hunter Academy are no match for him!”

Jin Liuyan nodded.
