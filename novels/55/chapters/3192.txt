“The ancient painting sect and the Heavenly Dragon Clan couldn’t break through the defense of the Dragon Palace. The defense of the Dragon Palace is so terrifying!”

“It’s too powerful. The defense of the Dragon Palace is almost invincible. The two forces can’t do anything about it.”

The spectators were shocked when they saw the two forces were helpless.

Who would have thought that the defense of the Dragon Palace was so terrifying.

“They are going to seal the Dragon Palace.”

Someone said in surprise.

Soon, they saw several wizards from the ancient painting sect start to set up arrays around them.

Some experts from the Heavenly Dragon Clan and the ancient painting sect also disappeared in an instant. Apparently, they were going to make some preparations.

They were going to seal the entire Dragon Palace.

“They want to seal the Dragon Palace? They don’t know how powerful our Dragon Palace is.”

In the Dragon Palace, Prime Minister Turtle and the others glanced at the two forces with cold expressions.

Even a pinnacle universe knight couldn’t break through the current Dragon Palace.

As for the seals, they were useless to the Dragon Palace.

The Dragon Palace had a teleportation array that could reach the other palaces.

And if there was no spiritual energy around, the main dragon palace could absorb the energy of the other palaces through the teleportation array.

Even if they sealed the dragon palace for thousands of years, it would be useless.

“We have reported the situation of our Dragon Palace to the Dragon King. As long as the Dragon King arrives, we will be able to kill them all.”

Prime Minister Gui said coldly.

Now, the day of their revenge would come when the Dragon King returned.

“All the members of the Dragon Palace should rest and wait. We don’t need to worry about the things outside.”

He gave an order to all the members of the Dragon Palace.

“Yes!”

The members of the Dragon Palace nodded.

…

“The Dragon King Palace can really escape? They can move around freely in the Sky Sea Dragon Palace. It’s impossible for us to defeat them with our strength.”

At the same time, in the distant Sky Sea, Wang Xian and the willow deity were chasing after the Dragon King Palace. After a few consecutive attacks, they were teleported away by the Dragon King Palace.

In the Sky Sea Dragon Palace, the chances of them destroying the Dragon King of the Sky Sea were zero.

“Let’s go. We won’t bother about the Dragon King Palace anymore. We’ll destroy the Dragon King of the Sky Sea in the future when we have the chance. Let’s see if there are any other treasures in the Dragon Palace.”

Wang Xian shook his head and continued to speak to the willow deity.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

The willow deity nodded.

The two of them moved and flew toward the center of the Sky Sea Dragon Palace.

They had basically obtained the divine herbs in the herb garden and the dragon bones in the dragon tomb.

They wanted to see if there were other treasures.

“These two damn guys. Soon, I will be able to completely merge with this body. As long as I do, I will make you pay the price.”

At the center of the Dragon King’s Palace, the Tianhai Dragon King sensed that the dragon king and the willow deity had stopped attacking the Dragon King’s palace. He growled in a low voice with a gloomy face.

It had been a long time since he had been in such a sorry state.

Being chased like this in his own dragon palace made him feel like a stray dog. It was a great humiliation.

However, as long as he fused with this body, with the treasures in his treasury, he could immediately make a breakthrough.

After the breakthrough, he would have the combat strength of a Level 4 knight.

By then, with the help of the power of the Dragon Palace, it would be enough to bury those two guys in his own Dragon Palace.

His eyes flickered with killing intent. He slowly closed his eyes. In a few hours at most, he would be able to complete his breakthrough.

However, what he didn’t know was that due to his serious injuries, a figure was groping around for some treasures in his treasure vault. Then, he carefully ran outside.

“There are no more treasures. I guess the most precious items are all in the Dragon King’s Palace.”

Outside, Wang Xian and the rest searched around the Sky Sea Dragon Palace and took out the treasure-seeking ants. After finding nothing, they shook their heads slightly.

“Get ready to go back. After I break through, we will come back to the Sky Sea Dragon Palace to take a look.”

As he spoke, a faint smile appeared on his face.

Although this trip was extremely dangerous, it was totally worth it for the rewards.

The resources in his hands could easily allow him to level up.

After he leveled up, he and the willow deity would be able to break through the Dragon King’s palace once they entered here again.

The willow deity nodded her head.

The two of them moved and immediately flew out.

“Catch him. I saw her coming out of the Dragon King’s palace. Catch her!”

At this moment, a shout came from the side.

“Huh?”

Wang Xian was slightly stunned. He raised his eyebrows and looked to the side.

He saw a woman with a human body and a snake tail running away with a pale face, trying to escape from the Tianhai Dragon Palace.

As it was located in the Tianhai Dragon Palace and the Divine Kingdom of the Tianhai Dragon King, all those who entered could only return to their divine kingdom in an instant after leaving this place. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Eh? It’s that female snake again!”

Wang Xian looked at this figure and raised his eyebrows. A look of astonishment appeared on his face.

Last time, he was chased by a venerable. This time, he was chased by more than ten demonic beasts of the ninth level of the celestial thearch level.

“She entered the Dragon King’s Palace?”

Wang Xian’s eyes were filled with doubt as he looked at the female snake who was fleeing frantically.

At this moment, the female snake’s face was filled with anxiety and bitterness. This time, it was not easy for her to enter the Dragon King’s palace and obtain some treasures through her innate talent.

However, she was discovered when she just came out.

When these demonic beasts saw her coming out of the Dragon King Palace, they naturally thought that she had a lot of treasures in her hands.

They immediately chased after her.

Her strength was not strong. She was only at the eighth level of the divine emperor realm. However, due to the reason of her bloodline, she was able to fight above her level.

This caused the more than ten demonic beasts to not catch up for a moment.

However, this shout immediately attracted the attention of many demonic beasts.

Each of them was filled with greed and a blazing luster as they stared at her.

“Oh? You entered the Dragon King Palace?”

On the right side, a palace master of the monster God Palace looked over, his eyes flashing with a luster.

This time, the Sky Sea Dragon Palace had undergone a huge change and they were able to enter.

However, after entering for so long, they did not discover any treasures.

Following that, all the great demons of the Demon God Palace split up to explore.

With the lion’s head, the great demon known as the Mad Lion moved and directly attacked the female snake.

“Not good!”

The female snake sensed the terrifying might and her expression changed drastically. She hurriedly fled to the side.

“Come here!”

However, at this time, a terrifying suction force came from behind.

A Level 2 knight could easily capture her.

This made the female snake look desperate.

However, at this time, she saw a familiar voice, her eyes filled with hope.

“Dragon King, save me. I’ve obtained some treasures, I’ll give them all to you.”

The female snake immediately cried out for help.

“Treasures?”

When the surrounding demonic beasts that were attracted over heard this, their eyes lit up.

The eyes of the Mad Lion were glowing.

None of the treasures in the Tianhai Dragon Palace were ordinary.

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows slightly. With a wave of his arm, a dragon claw instantly appeared beneath the female snake and protected her.
