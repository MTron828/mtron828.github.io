3523 3522 counter-attack

The Spirit Spirit belonged to the companion spirit!

The companion spirit that was closest to nature.

The combat strength of the companion spirit was weak, but its support ability was terrifying!

The place they were in now was considered to be in the soil. The sensing ability of the spirit spirit here was slightly higher than that of Wang Xian!

“Huh?”

When Wang Xian heard the words of the spirit spirit, his mind moved and he tried his best to sense his surroundings.

As expected, he sensed a drop of fresh blood approaching him. It was emitting a wave of energy. It was obvious that it was heading in his direction.

“Another blood essence dire beast?”

Wang Xian looked at the drop of blood essence and his eyes glowed.

If this was another blood essence dire beast with the combat strength of a level three universe dominator, the Dragon Palace would be able to increase the combat strength of another level three universe dominator.

By then, the Dragon Palace would be able to send an army to attack the base of the Hundred Cities Alliance!

As for the formation, Wang Xian was confident that he could break the formation with brute force!

He would completely destroy the hundred cities!

Whoosh

With a thought, a bolt of lightning struck the drop of blood instantly.

The drop of blood did not expect to be discovered by Wang Xian. It immediately flew backward in panic.

However, Wang Xian had already landed on the drop of blood.

Buzz

Wang Xian stood up immediately. He waved his arm and kept the blood refinement fruit. His body moved and chased after the drop of blood essence.

At the same time, the Ghost Avatar was hiding behind him, ready to attack at any time!

“Oh no, I’ve been discovered!”

At the same time, the golden ghostly flame above Li’s head was jumping, revealing a shocked and angry expression.

The blood essence he had released to investigate had actually been discovered!

He had a strong confidence in his own investigation!

Not to mention that it was a terrain that was advantageous to him in this blood plasma land!

When he released the blood essence to investigate, he was 100% certain that the other party would not be able to discover him.

However, this 100% was ineffective!

He had been discovered by the other party!

“What? Damn it!”

Wu Gui frowned when he heard that and couldn’t help but curse!

“I can’t sense that seductive energy anymore. It should have been kept!”

He sensed for a moment and his expression changed drastically!

“The other party is here. It’s fine. Kill him. Kill him. That treasure still belongs to us!”

Ghost fire jumped in Li’s eyes. He clenched his fists and growled.

His arm immediately transformed into a terrifying demon claw and attacked the area below.

“Attack!”

Wu Gui also sensed the energy below and immediately ordered loudly.

The other party was able to detect Li’s detection, which meant that the other party’s power was at the level of a level three universe master!

“Eh? It’s not a blood essence desolate beast. It’s another powerhouse. There are so many powerhouses!”

Wang Xian flew over from below. Sensing the energy and figure above him, he focused his gaze when he saw the other party attacking him!

He waved his arm and a defense instantly appeared above him!

His dragon eyes flickered and all the powerhouses in front of him appeared in his line of sight!

“Two level 3 battle-power wizards who are Masters of the universe, ten level 2 battle-power wizards who are Masters of the universe, and three level 1 ones!”

The opponent’s strength immediately appeared in his mind, and Wang Xian’s eyes revealed a look of surprise.

“Those three level 1 ones are three of the more than ten powerhouses who came last time. I really didn’t expect that!”

A hint of killing intent flashed in his eyes. He flapped his primaless sacred wings and instantly flew to one side.

Boom

The next moment, the attacks of the powerful wizards from the Demon Wizard clan landed on Wang Xian’s defense and directly broke it!

“Huh? He disappeared? Be careful!”

Seeing that Wang Xian was no longer there after his defense, he hurriedly warned loudly!

Whoosh! Whoosh

At this moment, Wang Xian had already arrived beside the two level 2 battle-strength wizards who were masters of the universe. His arms turned into dragon claws and pierced through their bodies, instantly killing them!

“What!”

“Not good, the opponent’s speed is very fast. Be careful and gather together to prevent an attack!”

Wu Gui’s expression changed drastically when he saw the two elders of his clan being killed instantly. He immediately warned loudly.

“Crash!”

“Boom!”

At this moment, Wang Xian’s body trembled. A terrifying pressure enveloped all the experts of the demon witch clan. His figure attacked once again in an instant.

“Attack!”

The faces of the strong practitioners of the demon witch clan changed drastically as they roared immediately!

Streams of energy shot towards Wang Xian directly.

“Kill one first. Lingling, give it your full support. Lock on to that spell formation wizard with the combat strength of a level three universe Dominator!”

When Wang Xian saw this scene, his eyes focused!

Since they dared to target him, he would make them pay a terrible price!

Now that Ling Ling had awakened, he was prepared to unleash his strongest attack!

Whoosh Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

He flapped his incipient saint wings and dodged the attacks of the demon wizards.

Whoosh

He flapped his wings again and Ling Ling raised the water lotus staff in her hand. Waves of energy surged into Wang Xian’s body!

Whoosh

In the next moment, his figure disappeared.

“Li, block him. His speed is very fast. You keep him busy while I kill him with the formation!”

Wu Gui quickly scanned his surroundings and roared loudly!

“Alright!”

“Roar!”

Li roared crazily. His arms and legs started to transform.

His legs and hands transformed into the appearance of a terrifying desolate beast.

The golden head was glowing as it scanned the surroundings.

“Wu Gui, be careful!”

At this moment, he sensed Wang Xian’s figure and immediately roared loudly!

“Scram!”

Wu Gui was already prepared. The bamboo hat emitted darkness and formed a defense!

“Boom!”

At this moment, the figure of Ming Gui flew out from Wang Xian’s body and headed straight for the defense attack.

The terrifying attack caused the defense to collapse instantly!

Wang Xian did not slow down as he clawed at Wu Gui with his dragon claws.

“What!”

Wu Gui’s expression changed slightly. With a move of his palm, a skeleton appeared beside him.

Crack! Crack

However, the moment the skeleton appeared, Wang Xian’s dragon claws had also penetrated his body.

However, a strange scene happened. A hole appeared on the chest of the skeleton beside him. The entire skeleton collapsed instantly and disappeared!

Following that, Wang Xian sensed that the body that was penetrated by his dragon claw had disappeared. He appeared unscathed at the spot where the skeleton man had disappeared!

The perfect substitute had dodged the fatal blow!

The blood-red light in Wu Gui’s eyes throbbed. Clearly, he was glad that he had managed to escape. He took advantage of the fact that Wang Xian had yet to withdraw his strength and hurriedly fled to the side.

“Bind!”

However, at this moment, an incomparably tender voice entered his ears. Thorns appeared around him.

The thorns directly bound him!

Feeling the power of this binding, Wu Gui’s expression changed drastically. Fear appeared in his eyes!

“Die, you’re courting death!”

He moved his palm once again and penetrated Wu Gui’s body.

This time, he did not take the place of the Skeleton Man!
