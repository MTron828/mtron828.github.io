Chapter 1383: 1383, the good-for-nothing disciple

“Ao Yao, send a crafty demon back to the Dragon Palace. Ask Prime Minister GUI to send more people over. In a week or two, we will bring our new members back to the Dragon Palace!”

Wang Xian looked at the temporarily rented manor. A group of Fire Hammer clansmen were packing up their things as they spoke to the void at the side.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Ao Yao’s voice was heard. The void at the side trembled slightly.

The Dragon Palace was still some distance away from here. Fierce beasts were rampant along the way, and the members of the fire hammer clan were too weak. It was necessary to have a strong escort.

It would be much safer to have around 300 insightful emptiness realm experts to escort them.

“Dragon King, the shop you want to rent has also been negotiated. I wonder what you are going to do, Dragon King? Our Fire Hammer clan has lived in Xiaoyao city for dozens of years. We are very familiar with this place, especially the weapons area!”

After the Fire Hammer clan leader settled his clansmen, he came to Wang Xian’s side and asked respectfully.

“There are indeed some things that I need you to handle. I have a batch of weapons here that I need you to handle. There are also some low-level metal materials!”

As Wang Xian spoke, he took out his interspatial rings one by one.

Most of the items that he came to Xiao Yao City to sell were weapons.

Wang Xian planned to auction some insightful void-level weapons at the king’s auction. However, those that were not at the insightful void-level were not eligible to be auctioned.

Hence, they had to be sold separately.

As Xiaoyao City was a large-scale market, many dynasties came here to purchase things.

Even if it was more than 100,000 weapons, they could be sold.

This time, there were about 70,000 to 80,000 weapons, staffs, and protective equipment in his interspatial ring.

Apart from these weapons, there were also tens of tons of metallic materials.

From transcendent level four to half-step void interpretation, there were many different kinds of materials.

As the level of metallic materials was not very high, it would be too troublesome to forge weapons and sell them.

Therefore, Wang Xian was prepared to sell these metal materials directly.

“Good... there are so many items and these materials. Dragon King, it’s not worth it to sell the materials directly. We can totally forge them into weapons and sell them later!”

“In that case, we can sell them for at least five to six times the price!”

The chief of the Fire Hammer tribe suggested.

“Is there enough time?”

Wang Xian looked at him. Naturally, he knew that the value of forging weapons was higher.

In the past, if he were to forge weapons by himself, it would take at least ten days. Wang Xian felt that it was too troublesome, so he did not forge weapons.

“It’s enough, Dragon King. There are more than two thousand members of our fire hammer clan. Now that you have taught them the first two transformations of the Fire God Dragon Transformation, many of our clansmen can break through directly and forge weapons faster!”

The chief of the Fire Hammer clan said with a smile on his face.

The members of the Fire Hammer clan had at least four arms and could forge two weapons at the same time.

Their speed was twice that of an ordinary weaponsmith. Someone like Duan Jinming could forge twelve weapons in less than a minute.

Their speed and efficiency were even faster than Wang Xian.

More than 2,000 people was indeed enough!

“Alright, I’ll leave the problem of selling these resources to you. In addition, I have some items here that you can sell!”

“I’ll sell some spirit stones. You can buy some things that you need. Don’t be stingy and buy whatever you need!”

Wang Xian passed the rest of the miscellaneous items to the chief of the Fire Hammer tribe.

With his current strength of the first level of the Seethrough Void Tier, it wouldn’t be dangerous for him to handle these matters.

“Thank you, Dragon King. In the future, our fire hammer tribe will definitely go through fire and water for you!”

The chief of the Fire Hammer Clan said respectfully with tears in his eyes as he looked outside.

Wang Xian revealed a smile. With the help of the Fire Hammer clan, it was much easier for him than it was for him.

He returned to his room.

Wang Xian rested for the night. The next morning, he walked out directly.

“Dragon King, if you want to enter the king’s auction, you need an invitation letter. Not everyone can enter the king’s auction!”

The elder from the Fire Hammer clan acted as Wang Xian’s guide and led him to the king’s area in the middle.

Compared to the weapons area, the king’s area was more glorious.

The most prominent thing in the entire area was the gigantic auction.

King’s auction.

There was only one way to enter this auction -- an invitation letter.

An invitation letter for the king’s auction.

Those who could receive an invitation letter would be considered top-notch even if they were placed in a dynasty.

There were more than twenty dynasties participating in this auction, and there were seven to eight sects that were not weaker than dynasties.

“Okay!”

Wang Xian nodded. He had the invitation letter in his hand and it was given to him by Feng Luan. There were a total of three of them.

“Sir, do you wish to auction the items? If you wish to have the invitation letter, our commission will be reduced by 0.05 points!”

When he arrived at the auction counter, an old staff member asked Wang Xian.

“Auction all the items here!”

Wang Xian nodded his head. As he spoke, he took out the invitation letter and the auction items.

“So you are from the dragon and Phoenix Dynasty!”

When the old man received Wang Xian’s invitation letter, a hint of surprise flashed across his eyes. Then, he took a look at the auction items and was slightly shocked.

“As expected of a powerful empire that has risen recently. I’ll give you the auction certificate and Your Identity Certificate. This is a private room for the auction. After the auction is over, you can use the auction certificate to collect the spirit stones for your auction items!”

The old man smiled at Wang Xian.

“Alright, Thank You!”

Wang Xian nodded his head.

“Young master, you can take a look at the king’s zone. The items sold here are all very valuable!”

The old man suggested to him.

“Okay!”

After walking out of the huge and glorious King’s zone, Wang Xian started to stroll around.

In the king’s zone, there were many high-grade items besides this auction house.

Items above transcendence were sold here.

“Let’s see if I can buy some good stuff!”

Wang Xian walked on the streets. The king’s territory was not small. There were many shops around the auction house.

There were all kinds of weapons and elixirs. All kinds of items were sold and they were all top-grade.

“Eh? A Spirit Pearl Shop? I didn’t expect there to be a spirit pearl shop here?”

Wang Xian revealed a look of surprise and immediately walked into the shop.

The moment he stepped into the shop, Wang Xian could feel the impact of the spiritual energy from the spirit pearls of various attributes.

In the entire shop, there were hundreds of spirit pearls of various attributes. However, most of them were not of high levels.

There was a group of young men and women in the shop.

“HMM? The price is not very expensive. It’s very suitable for purchase!”

The spiritual pearls were of great use to Wang Xian. It could also be used to nurture weapons for his subordinates.

It could also be used to allow the five elements grinding mill to devour and upgrade.

“Come, brothers and sisters, this is the unique spiritual pearls shop in our Xiaoyao City. This shop wouldn’t be available in other dynasties!”

At this moment, dozens of young men and women entered the shop from the outside.

There were many people in this group, and each of them seemed to have an extraordinary status. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m
