“Phew, let’s go. There’s no way to break the formation inside. On the contrary, we almost died inside!”

“A formation at the insightful void level coupled with the residual energy of the mineral vein underground, it’s impossible to break it by force. Even a formation master wouldn’t be able to break such a chaotic formation!”

“A formation that can remain here for thousands of years is indeed not something that we can break!”

Wang Xian approached the mansion of the former blood stream sect’s ancient proverb expert. Five to six middle-aged elders walked out from the mansion and shook their heads helplessly.

When they saw Wang Xian, they glanced at him and ignored him. They left immediately.

“Looks like there are quite a number of people here!”

Wang Xian looked over. When he walked over, he noticed that there were four to five hundred people around him. Among this group of people, the weakest one was at level seven of the supernatural realm.

The mountain peak covered an area of about one kilometer. The entire mountain peak was flashing with a blue light. Wang Xian looked over and realized that the power of the formation had completely blocked his light and dark fire dragon eyes.

When Wang Xian got closer, the surroundings of the mountain peak were in a mess.

A few large holes had been dug into the ground. It was so deep that one could not see the bottom. Clearly, someone wanted to burrow in from the ground.

The surrounding trees had long been destroyed.

A group of people surrounded the mountain peak and tried to enter from all sorts of places.

In the center, there was an entrance with the words ‘ancient proverb mansion’written on it.

At the entrance, there was a strong wave of water energy. Several middle-aged men tried to enter, but they were instantly ejected.

There was also a group of people standing there to break the array.

“Buzz!”

“Haha, three layers have been broken, and there are five more!”

At this moment, an excited voice came from the entrance.

“Hiss, Master Hua Zhenzi from the Spirit Array sect has broken through three layers. What great strength!”

“The Spirit Array sect has broken through seven or eight of the void interpretation experts’mansions here. Their gains are simply heaven-defying. This ancient proverb’s mansions might really have been broken by them!”

“It’s possible. If I remember correctly, master Hua Zhenzi used only half a month to crack three layers of the formation!”

Discussions could be heard from the surroundings. Some People’s eyes were flickering. However, when they saw more than a dozen people from the Spirit Formation sect standing around and there were even experts at the first level of the voidwalkers, the greed in their eyes was hidden.

Wang Xian looked over. An old man was holding a formation compass in his hand as he continued to crack the chaotic formation.

It was obvious that he had already entered the formation.

Boom

Wang Xian walked straight towards him. However, before he could reach him, a loud sound was heard.

The formation that was standing at the entrance suddenly shook. The water currents condensed into a poisonous snake and landed directly on the body of Master Hua Zhenzi.

A terrifying force landed on his body. Under the gaze of everyone around, the body of Master Hua Zhenzi exploded and turned into a stream of blood mist that landed on the ground.

Everyone was slightly shocked and shook their heads slowly.

“Master!”

“Elder Hua!”

Outside, the expressions of more than ten people from the Spirit Array sect changed drastically. They hurriedly shouted out loud and their expressions were extremely ugly.

One second ago, they were still happy. However, the next second, they were crushed into a bloody mist by the Terrifying Array Formation.

Wang Xian was slightly shocked as well. His eyes flickered as he looked at the array formation at the entrance.

He looked around and walked straight ahead. He took out a formation compass in a pretentious manner.

“HMM? There’s another person who wants to break the formation at the entrance!”

“Who is this young man? Is He from the Spirit Formation sect?”

When Wang Xian walked to the front of the entrance, some people around him looked over and revealed astonished expressions.

“Go. Follow the route your master took to break the formation and bring his interspatial ring over!”

At the entrance, an elder glanced at Wang Xian and ignored him. He spoke to a young man directly.

“It’s an elder!”

The young man’s eyes were slightly red as he nodded. He took the array compass and walked inside carefully.

“Stand here and don’t move. Don’t activate the array!”

The young man walked to the front of the array. When he saw Wang Xian walking over, he turned around with a cold face and shouted.

Wang Xian took a glance at him and raised his eyebrows slightly.

“Stop right there. Wait for our people to retrieve the interspatial ring before you go over!”

Behind him, a few people from the Spirit Array sect also warned Wang Xian.

The most taboo thing to do when breaking a formation was to have someone beside you.

If the person beside him were to trigger the formation, the other person would be implicated as well.

When the Spirit Array sect was breaking the formation earlier, it prevented the surrounding people from breaking it through the entrance.

Wang Xian shrugged his shoulders slightly and looked at the young man beside him. “Do you need me to help you take it out?”

The young man was slightly stunned when he heard Wang Xian’s words. Following that, his expression turned even colder. “You think you can enter the ancient proverb mansion with just your abilities? Get lost!”

The young man was in a very bad mood and shouted directly.

“Kid, get out. Otherwise, there will be another corpse here!”

The other middle-aged man from the Spirit Formation sect took a step towards Wang Xian. His eyes were filled with killing intent as he spoke.

“Hehe!”

When Wang Xian heard their words, his eyes revealed a hint of coldness.

“A bunch of trash!”

He spoke indifferently and walked straight in.

“You’re courting death!”

When the middle-aged man heard Wang Xian’s words, his eyes revealed killing intent. The long sword in his hand did not hesitate and he stabbed directly.

He would kill without any hesitation.

This was the graveyard of the demi-humans. The strong would be the king.

The burial ground of the weak.

Wang Xian’s eyes were filled with contempt. He ignored him and walked straight ahead.

Buzz

After entering the formation, Wang Xian didn’t feel any hindrance. The attacks from behind landed directly on the formation, creating faint ripples.

The middle-aged man who was attacking was slightly stunned. Everyone around him was stunned as they watched this scene.

“How... How is this possible? How could he enter the formation so easily?”

The young man who was standing at the side was stunned. His master, the master of formations, had used half a month to break through three formations. The first layer of formations had also taken two days.

How could he enter the formation so easily. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

However, what shocked everyone even more was that Wang Xian walked straight to the front. He walked straight to the side of the interspatial ring and picked it up.

Then, he continued to walk forward.

“What? How is this possible?”

“How did he pass through one formation after another? This...”

Everyone around was in shock. Even the people from the Spirit Formation sect widened their eyes.

“This, this, this, this...”

The people from the Spirit Formation sect were so angry that they almost vomited blood. They watched as Wang Xian picked up the interspatial ring and entered it directly.

They recalled Wang Xian’s words just now. Should they help you pick it up?

However, their reaction was disdain. They told him to get lost.

However, now, the other party had just walked in just like that!

A slap to the face. It was a blatant slap to the face!

“How is this possible? The Spirit Formation sect has used half a month to crack it, and Master Hua Zhenzi died inside. How did he enter so easily!”

The people around were shocked.

“Someone is about to enter the old saying mansion. Another mansion has been occupied by someone!”

Everyone around looked at Wang Xian’s disappearing figure with an awkward expression.

“Guard here. I don’t know what method this kid used to enter. Even if he has the life to enter, he must have the life to take the treasure away!”

The people from the Spirit Array sect all had gloomy expressions. The void interpretation expert standing in the middle said coldly.
