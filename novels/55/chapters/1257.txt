Chapter 1258: 1259 Heaven’s Pride Wang Shou

Translator: 5496903

More than 40 young men who were surrounding to prevent the hell deer from escaping widened their eyes when they saw this scene. They stared at Wang Xian in shock.

Among these more than 40 people, many of them were newly recruited subordinates of Long Xiaotian. They had never witnessed Wang Xian’s strength before.

When they saw how he defeated about 60 hell deer so easily, even five of the hell deer that were at transcendent level nine could not withstand a single blow from him, their faces were filled with shock.

His strength was too strong. Even the heaven’s favorites on the Heaven’s favorites list were only so-so, right?

Wang Xian walked to the center of the nether deers. With a wave of his arm, he gathered all the nether deers in the center. A surge of divine dragon’s might was transmitted directly into their minds.

All the nether deers who were lying on the ground trembled. Their eyes revealed a look of horror.

Following that, Wang Xian transmitted a wave of goodwill into their minds.

“Yoo-yoo-yoo-yoo!”

The deer let out a trembling cry.

Wang Xian waved his arm, and his supernatural ability landed on their bodies. The injuries in their bodies were recovering rapidly.

“Yoo-yoo-yoo-yoo-yoo!”

The five deer that were at transcendent level nine stood up slowly. They knelt down slowly with their front hooves and bowed toward Wang Xian.

A faint smile appeared on his face. With a wave of his arm, drops of blood with his aura entered their minds.

“F * ck!”

“This... is so powerful!”

“Oh my God, No Wonder His Highness the second prince is so respectful towards this young master. What a terrifying beast taming ability!”

“Hehe, what do you think? Young master Wang Xian has two ferocious beasts of the first level of the Seethrough Void. How can his strength be compared to ours?”

Around them, more than 40 young men widened their eyes when they saw Wang Xian’s heaven-defying ability. Their eyes were filled with disbelief.

“Haha, Thank You, Brother Wang Xian. Thank you so much, brother Wang Xian!”

Long Xiaotian trembled slightly when he saw this scene. His face was filled with excitement.

These were beasts at the lowest level of the supernatural realm, level eight. There were also five beasts at level nine of the supernatural realm.

This was equivalent to him having more than 60 powerful subordinates.

“Are we going to tame more beasts?”

Wang Xian asked Long Xiaotian with a smile.

“Yes, but brother Wang Xian, this is the only location that my subordinates have found. If we are going to tame more beasts, we need to continue searching!”

Long Xiaotian said to Wang Xian in embarrassment.

More than 60 such powerful mounts were worth at least tens of billions of middle-grade spirit stones.

Furthermore, such mounts were not something that one could buy with spirit stones.

“It’s alright. We have only been here for a few hours!”

Wang Xian shook his head and said with a smile.

“Alright, but we have to bring these nether deer back first!”

Long Xiaotian nodded and looked at Wang Xian. “Brother Wang Xian, with your strength, you should be able to enter the top three of the Prodigy Roll!”

Wang Xian smiled and shook his head. “Ren Xingchen and Ling Jian ‘er are both very strong. That nameless sword demon is even stronger!”

“Indeed. That nameless sword demon’s strength is too terrifying. Qian Ye, who was at the insightful void level, was killed by him casually. Furthermore, he was very young. If only I had such strong strength!”

Long Xiaotian sighed slightly. He did not associate the nameless sword demon with Wang Xian. Furthermore, he knew that Wang Xian had yet to reach the insightful void level.

In his opinion, Wang Xian’s strength was almost comparable to an insightful emptiness realm expert. However, he was still far from matching up to the nameless sword demon!

Wang Xian smiled at the side and searched around the lair of the nether deer. He found more than 50 drops of spiritual liquid and two spiritual herbs of extraordinary eighth level.

Following that, the group flew towards the exit with a group of Nether deer following behind.

After handing the nether deer to his subordinates outside, Long Xiaotian looked at Wang Xian and the group walked towards the trial grounds again.

“This is too brutal. The demonic beast in the training ground is too terrifying. Our team of more than 100 people has lost more than 70 people!”

“Damn it, damn it. How could that demonic beast be so terrifying? A half-step void interpretation expert was killed with a single claw. Oh My God, the training ground is too dangerous now!”

“I heard that thousands of people have died in the mouths of the demonic beasts in the past two days. Damn it, there are void interpretation experts among them. They are not people we can deal with!”

“Not only that, I also heard those Demonic Beasts call a demonic beast the heaven’s Pride King. That Heaven’s Pride King’s Aura is at the profound void level. It’s much stronger than the aura of an ordinary profound void level expert. If it wasn’t for my quick escape, I would have died long ago!”

Just as they entered the entrance, a group of more than forty people with tattered clothes walked out. They were all discussing in fear.

“I thought that this year’s supreme prodigy might be the nameless sword demon. Now, it seems that the demonic beast is still as terrifying as before!”

“That Demonic Beast, the Heaven’s Pride King, shouldn’t be a match for the nameless sword demon. The Sword Demon’s destructive power is too terrifying.”

“It’s hard to say. I feel that the Demonic Beast’s aura is very powerful. It’s not something that a first level void interpretation demonic beast can release. I could sense it from a few kilometers away!”

The frightened voice continued to come from the front, causing long Xiaotian to frown slightly.

“Hey, you guys are still going in? Are you looking for death? Our team heard the roar of the demonic beast from a distance of 50 kilometers away. It’s too dangerous!”

Wang Xian, Long Xiaotian and the rest didn’t stop. A small team of people who just came out saw them enter and reminded them.

“Is it really that dangerous?” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Long Xiaotian’s expression changed.

“What do you think? The king of the demonic beasts. When the bridge of Heaven’s Pride was opened, didn’t the demonic beasts obtain the title of the Supreme King of the Demonic Beasts? weren’t they all at the insightful void Tier?”

A young man glanced at long Xiaotian. He didn’t recognize him as the Prince of the Radiant Dragon Empire and said coldly.

Long Xiaotian revealed a hint of contemplation on his face. He looked at Wang Xian and said, “Brother Wang Xian, let’s wait before we enter!”

“Sure!”

Wang Xian nodded. He did not force himself. The situation inside was unclear, so there was no need to enter.

“Then let’s Tame the hell deer for your men first!”

He said to Long Xiaotian.

“Alright!”

Long Xiaotian nodded and turned around to return.

Although the appearance of the demonic beasts had interrupted his plan, his life was more important. It was not worth the risk for some mounts.

As long as Wang Xian was around, there was no rush.

The group of people did not leave. Instead, they went to the side. Wang Xian helped long Xiaotian’s underlings tame the hell deer.

However, what surprised Wang Xian, Long Xiaotian, and the rest was that more and more people came out of the training ground.

Many of them were heavily injured. Some of them were even carrying their companions’corpses with a horrified expression on their faces.

Time passed slowly. In just five hours, more than 10,000 people had gathered in the training ground.

“It seems that the situation inside is a little critical. Fortunately, we came out earlier!”

Long Xiaotian looked inside and slightly frowned.
