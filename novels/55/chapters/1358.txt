Chapter 1359: 1359 charged forward

“A friend of Her Majesty the Queen?”

When the old man heard the voices of the soldiers around him, a look of astonishment appeared on his face.

“Since this Lord Wang is a friend of Her Majesty the Queen, please come in. I will bring you to the royal palace in front of you!”

He looked at Wang Xian in the sky and said in a deep voice.

“Alright. It has been a year since I last came. The changes in the royal city have been huge!”

Wang Xian nodded his head lightly. His body moved and he flew directly to the city wall.

“Sir Wang, Please!”

The elder gestured and led Wang Xian into the imperial palace.

“Sir Wang is here. We will definitely be able to get through this difficult period!”

“Of course. I don’t know why Sir Wang didn’t bring his subordinates here this time!”

“Lord Wang contributed a lot to our dragon-phoenix dynasty in the beginning!”

On the city wall, some residents of Saint Sea Town looked at him with admiration and respect.

“Is he really as powerful as you say? Isn’t he just a young man? and he looks like an ordinary young master. It will be difficult for him to help us this time!”

“That’s right. I’ve heard of this Lord Wang before, but his strength shouldn’t be at the Profound Void realm, right? What can he use to help us!”

“That’s right. This time, the despicable star-moon dynasty allied with two dynasties to besiege us. What can that Lord Wang use to help us!”

Some of the soldiers who came later heard their conversation and frowned as they spoke from the side.

“We believe in Lord Wang. He will definitely be able to help us, Help Her Majesty the Queen!”

“You are all blind. What kind of enemy did you face a year ago? Our Dragon-phoenix dynasty has developed so quickly. A year later, we are facing three other dynasties. It is not some fierce beasts and a few insightful emptiness realm experts. It is very likely that there are twenty to thirty of them!”

The soldiers in the past firmly believed it. However, the soldiers who came later shook their heads in disapproval.

This caused the expressions of the soldiers from Shenghai town to turn slightly ugly.

At the same time, they also understood that this was only their best fantasy. The current dragon-phoenix Empire was no longer the former dragon-phoenix Empire.

And the enemies now were no longer the same as before.

“Follow me!”

The old man gestured to Wang Xian at the entrance of the palace that occupied a radius of ten kilometers. After going through strict checks, they arrived in front of a palace.

“Her Majesty the Queen is discussing something with a group of generals. Please wait outside!”

When they arrived in front of the palace, a woman stopped them outside.

“Report this. Just say that Wang Xian is outside. Your Queen will let me in!”

Wang Xian said directly to the woman.

The Dragon and Phoenix Empire was already on the right track. They could not enter just because they wanted to. Everything had to be reported.

Of course, this was when they did not know about the relationship between Wang Xian and Feng Luan.

“Wang Xian? Sir Wang?”

The woman seemed to have gained some understanding. She was slightly surprised. She nodded quickly and walked into the main hall.

“Wang Xian, I didn’t expect you to come back after disappearing for a year!”

A voice came directly from inside. Feng Luan, who was dressed in a luxurious fiery red robe with golden threads, walked out from inside.

She wore a veil on her face and the fiery red robe on her body was embroidered with the image of a Phoenix.

She looked like a queen who was the mother of the world.

The temperament of the former empress was fully displayed.

When Wang Xian saw Feng Luan’s attire, he was slightly stunned.

Her fair neck, long eyelashes, clear eyes, and her beautiful body that was covered under the Phoenix Robe.

Her slightly furrowed brows made one’s heart ache.

“Your Majesty, I didn’t expect you to become more and more beautiful after a year!”

Wang Xian went up to her with a smile on his face.

“Your mouth is still the same. Come in. How’s the situation in Your Dragon Palace? Have you settled the matters at the deep sea spiritual spring?”

Feng Luan asked Wang Xian with a smile.

“I’m here. Naturally, I can settle it!”

Wang Xian smiled.

Meanwhile, the old lady and the old man at the back were completely stunned.

They actually Saw Her Majesty the Queen, who was cold and arrogant as if she had transcended the mortal world, smiling so happily.

They even joked with that young man!

Oh My God, this was still their Majesty the Queen?

Was it fake?

While they were shocked, they also realized the relationship between this Lord Wang and their queen.

“In a year’s time, I didn’t expect the dragon-phoenix dynasty to develop so quickly!”

Wang Xian followed Feng Luan into the Grand Hall.

The entire main hall was in the color of a fire dragon. It was different from the other palaces. The stone pillars around the main hall were engraved with flying fire phoenixes.

The entire main hall was majestic and had a hint of a woman’s beauty.

“I’m quite satisfied with the current development!”

Feng Luan smiled and looked around indifferently.

At this moment, there were more than 30 people standing on both sides of the main hall. Some of them were generals and some were civil officials.

Under Wang Xian’s perception, those generals were all at the insightful emptiness realm. There were a total of 15 insightful emptiness realm experts.

Other than these people, there were more than 10 people sitting at the front. Their attire was completely different from that of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire.

Each of them had a hint of arrogance on their faces. Clearly, they were not from the Dragon and Phoenix Empire.

When everyone in the hall saw Wang Xian, most of them had a look of astonishment in their eyes. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

They looked at Wang Xian in astonishment.

A young man actually allowed their cold and arrogant queen to welcome him personally.

Moreover, the queen, who was frowning coldly just now, was clearly in a much better mood at this moment.

This could not help but cause some people in the main hall to be puzzled. This was the Queen’s... Man?

“Wang Xian, sit at the side first and wait for me to settle some urgent matters!”

Feng Luan gestured to a seat beside the throne and said to him.

Wang Xian nodded his head lightly and sat down.

Ao Jian and another golden swordfish stood on the left and right.

“Queen of Dragons and phoenixes, don’t delay any further. With your conditions, it’s impossible for our Dongyuan dynasty to send troops to assist you!”

Wang Xian had just sat down when he heard a dozen or so people in the middle of the room, who were sitting on chairs, speaking faintly.

There were a dozen people and five old men. The rest of them were middle-aged men. The middle-aged man in the middle had a beard on his mouth and was dressed in luxurious plush clothes.

His body was filled with a noble aura. He looked at Feng Luan and spoke faintly.

“HMM?”

Feng Luan frowned again when she heard their words, her eyes flickered. “These conditions of mine can bring about a strong increase in your Dongyuan dynasty in the next few years. If you don’t agree, what do you want?”

“Dragon and Phoenix Queen, you also know that it will be in the next few years. Who knows if there will be any accidents in the next few years?”

The noble middle-aged man who was sitting in the middle slowly stood up, and a gentle smile appeared on his face.

“It’s very easy to get our Dongyuan dynasty to send out troops. The two countries will have a marriage alliance, and our Dongyuan King will fall in love with Queen Dragon and Phoenix at first sight. If the two countries have a marriage alliance, then the dragon and Phoenix Dynasty’s matter will be our Dongyuan dynasty’s matter!”
