Chapter 878: Demon hunting 0879

Translator: 549690339

On the transcendent continent, the so-called transcendent referred not only to humans, but also to other living beings.

Demons and ghosts coexisted.

Humans were only one part of it.

It was very unsafe outside the city, and even dangerous.

Therefore, the transcendent continent gave birth to a class, the mercenary group.

The mercenary group could obtain huge rewards by killing demon beasts, escorting items, searching for pills, and so on.

In the entire continent, mercenary groups had the largest number of people among all classes.

Mercenary groups had detailed levels.

A powerful mercenary group would be respected by everyone.

Of course, if it was a weak mercenary group, it would be cannon fodder.

Holy Sea town was a town, but it was not small at all. Its population reached several million people.

The huge city wall was at least a hundred meters high, and it was filled with all kinds of marks.

On the city wall stood soldiers armed with bows and weapons, each of them exuding extraordinary strength.

“In the entire transcendent continent, humans are not the only ones. Powerful demon beasts devour humans when they are hungry. Therefore, even a small town has a population of several million people. Only by uniting together can humans survive here!”

“These city walls are meant to resist the sea beasts. Shenghai town is near the sea. Sometimes, there will be sea beasts attacking the city. There will be tens of thousands or even millions of sea beasts. There will even be sea beasts of the eighth or ninth level of the supernatural realm attacking the city. The marks on the city walls are left behind by the Sea Beasts!”

Gu Qingwen explained to him.

Wang Xian nodded slowly. This was a world that ate humans. Humans ate demonic beasts, and demonic beasts ate humans.

“Ao Yao, shrink down and stand on my shoulder!”

Wang Xian landed below the east gate of Shenghai Town and said to Ao Yao.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Ao Yao was also at level one of transcendence. Although his concealment was powerful, he was still able to be discovered by people at level eight or nine of transcendence or those who possessed ocular skills.

With the hostility between the transcendence continent and demonic beasts, he might be killed directly.

Ao Yao’s body moved and turned into a size of 30 to 40 centimeters. He landed on Wang Xian’s shoulder.

Demonic Beasts were very common pets in the supernatural continent.

Although ao Yao’s form was not cute, it had a special power.

Shrinking Bones was a very common skill for a king of assassins.

“Ten low-grade spirit stones per person!”

Upon entering the town, the guard at the entrance spoke directly to Wang Xian and the rest.

Naturally, their language was not Chinese. However, Wang Xian had long mastered the language of the transcendence continent. There were no traffic barriers.

Spirit stones were divided into low-grade, middle-grade, high-grade and top-grade.

All the spirit stones on Earth were considered low-grade. One hundred low-grade spirit stones were equivalent to one middle-grade spirit stone.

Wang Xian had brought five million low-grade spiritual stones with him when he came to the transcendence continent. It was sufficient!

After paying 110 low-grade spiritual stones, Wang Xian and the rest walked in.

Due to the fact that the holy light mercenary group was too weak, they did not have a base. They only had a temporary residence.

“The temporary residence is the place that the leader rented in the past. The geographical location is pretty good. Dragon King, let’s go there first and plan our future development!”

Gu Qingwen led the way respectfully in front.

“Make way, make way!”

At this moment, at the entrance, four to five people were carrying a huge demonic beast on their shoulders. The demonic beast was more than ten meters in size.

It was a snake-type demonic beast with a horn on top of its head.

Even though it was dead, this demonic beast still emitted a strong murderous aura.

“It’s the horned shark mercenary group. I didn’t expect them to kill an extraordinary level five horned snake. It’s really powerful!”

A drakonid pulled Wang Xian and retreated to the side. He looked over and revealed a shocked expression.

“The horned shark mercenary group is a one-star gold mercenary group. It has a great reputation in Shenghai town. The leader is an extraordinary level six powerhouse!”

Gu Qingwen introduced the mercenary group to Wang Xian in a low voice.

The mercenary group had detailed levels. From low to high, they were bronze, silver, gold, diamond, epic, legendary, and mythical. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Each level was divided into one to five stars, and the five stars were the highest.

Wang Xian looked over and saw a badge with a golden sword and shield crossed on their chests.

The word “Shark”was written on it. On the badge, there was a star which represented one gold star.

This was a symbol of strength.

“What is the strongest level in Shenghai Town?”

Wang Xian asked Gu Qingwen.

“The strongest transcendent level nine, the mayor of Shenghai Town. There are no big families in Shenghai town. The mayor is the strongest!”

Gu Qingwen said, “Only big cities have such terrifying powerhouses like the Dongxu. In the entire Blue Moon Kingdom, there are only about twenty Dongxu powerhouses!”

Wang Xian nodded his head slowly. The first change of the Divine Dragon corresponded to the transcendents, and the second change of the Divine Dragon corresponded to the Dongxu.

The dogfish mercenary group obviously had a great reputation in Shenghai town. Upon seeing their arrival, everyone opened a path and looked at them respectfully.

“The corpse of a transcendent level five demonic beast is worth 50,000 mid-grade spiritual stones. It’s very precious!”

Gu Qingwen said enviously.

Wang Xian looked around quietly and didn’t say anything. He silently memorized everything in his heart.

There were many different shops compared to the nine cauldrons world on Earth.

Formations, elixirs, weapons, demon beast bones, cultivation techniques, and so on!

“Dragon King, the temporary base of our holy glory mercenary group is just around the corner at the end of the road ahead!”

A drakonid pointed ahead and said.

Wang Xian nodded his head. The ground was made of a green stone which was extremely hard. The surrounding buildings were also made of stone which was exceptionally sturdy.

There were a few wooden houses which looked extraordinary.

“Sigh, I’ve been rejected. I don’t even have the chance to see miss ao Xue’s beautiful face!”

“Miss AO Xue is full of pride. Let’s not think too much about it!”

“The demon hunters academy will be coming to our holy sea town to recruit students tomorrow. I wonder if we can pass the assessment!”

“If we can join Miss Ao Xue’s team, we will definitely pass the assessment!”

At the intersection, three young men walked over and shook their heads as they walked.

“Demon Hunter College?”

Wang Xian’s eyes lit up when he heard their conversation. He was deep in thought!

“This is it!”

At the intersection, a DRAKONID pointed at a door and said.

This was a house with an independent courtyard. It was the base of the Holy Light mercenary group.

“Eh? The door is locked from the inside? has the landlord been here before?”

The DRAKONID looked puzzled.

“I’ll break it open directly!”

Gu Qingwen pulled out his long saber and slashed at the chains inside.

“Dragon King, Please!”

After the chains were broken, the ten DRAKONIDS pushed the door open respectfully and said to Wang Xian.

“Who? I told you to SCRAM. Now you dare to barge in directly. You’re really courting death!”

A cold shout came from inside. Following that, a sharp longsword came straight at them.

Wang Xian, who was in the middle, was the first to bear the brunt of the attack!
