Boom

At the bottom of the sea, a terrifying aura was emitted. It was directly blocked by Ao Jian, AO qitian, and Wang Xian.

Ao yaoyao, who was sitting cross-legged on the ground and at the bottom of the sea, was emitting a bright energy. His entire body was milky white.

After cultivating the Divine Dragon Transformation of light, the Strange Yaoyao was even more terrifying than before.

Unlike Sun Lingxiu, Sun Lingxiu was more powerful in the treatment of light because she was a doctor.

On the other hand, the strange demon tribe was extremely good at using the concealment of light.

The 1.8-meter-tall ao demon’s nearly 1.5-meter-tall arm was flickering with light. Gradually, white scales covered it completely.

On the claws, specks of white light were flickering, making the entire claw look extremely penetrating!

Buzz

All of a sudden, ao Yao’s body disappeared from their sight. Even if Wang Xian and the rest tried their best to sense it, they could not sense any living beings there.

Wang Xian moved his arm and a water sword landed there. As a result, the water sword landed on the bottom of the sea.

“Huh?”

“Dragon King!”

At this moment, Ao Yao’s body appeared and appeared at the side.

He was wearing a white leather coat that completely covered his body. The hazy light energy made it impossible to see his true appearance.

He was very pretentious.

Wang Xian was stunned for a moment before he laughed. “Ao Yao, it seems that your concealment has become much stronger. How confident are you in assassinating Immortals of the same level?”

“30% , 30% confidence!”

Ao Yao hesitated for a moment before she replied.

“30% ?”

Wang Xian frowned slightly.

“I will reveal myself when I attack. Moreover, when I want to assassinate someone, I will definitely have killing intent or killing intent. Immortals can sense it. Once my first attack does not cause a serious injury to the other party, it is basically impossible to kill the other party!”

Ao Yao replied.

“That’s true. Thirty percent is already very terrifying!”

Wang Xian nodded his head. It was not easy to kill an immortal powerhouse. A thirty percent chance was already very terrifying.

No matter how powerful the concealment was, if the immortal powerhouse was prepared, he would be able to react.

Furthermore, he could still force ao Yao to reveal herself in a special way.

“30% is enough!”

A glint flashed across Wang Xian’s eyes. He didn’t want Ao Yao to assassinate the immortals alone.

Instead, he wanted Ao Yao to assassinate them when they were besieging them.

This could increase the success rate to 70% or even 90% .

“It’s daybreak. The world is about to boil!”

Wang Xian looked up at the sky. The rainstorm was still pouring down, but the sky was already bright.

However, at this very moment, there were two islands in the middle of the world of Yu Ding.

These two islands were not very big. There were two mountains that were about 100 meters tall on them.

Black trees grew on the entire island, and strange black birds were flying in the sky above them.

“More than a thousand netherkill members have been selected. Next, the deity will train them individually and teach them an assassination combat technique!”

“I really envy them. Netherkill is a powerful organization jointly established by our two great immortal sects. In the future, it will definitely become famous and awe-inspiring in the world of martial arts!”

“Hehe, it’s also good for us to follow the Lord Immortal God!”

“Killing is the most exciting thing. It’s too boring to stay by the Lord Immortal God’s side. I like the weak begging for mercy under me and the frightened faces. Hehe!”

Two figures appeared in the sky. They stood on two five-meter-long black strange birds and came to the top of a small island.

This was a small island with no people. To be precise, all the people who used to live on this island had been killed. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

The small island was located in the center of the six islands.

“Oh? Where are they? Where are the members of netherkill? Why haven’t they arrived yet?”

“It’s already nine o’clock. We told them to wait here at eight o’clock!”

The two old men standing on the strange black bird revealed sullen expressions.

They were the famous people who followed the immortal God. How dare these people of Netherworld killer disobey them?

“That’s not right. It’s impossible that all the members of Netherworld Killer didn’t come. Could it be that we informed them of the wrong time yesterday?”

An old man frowned slightly.

“The time isn’t wrong. Come, let’s go to Lian Shang Island and take a look!”

Another old man’s face darkened as he pointed in a direction. The strange black bird that he was sitting on immediately flew over.

An old man beside him also followed closely behind.

When they arrived above Lian Shang Island, their gazes swept downwards. Everything was as usual.

There were some pedestrians on the street...

“Eh, something’s Not Right...”

The old man swept his gaze over and discovered that the weapon shops and medicinal pill shops were all closed.

“Ah, this is bad. Lord Mo Qian and the others have been killed!”

Right at this moment, a cry of alarm sounded from the middle of the island.

“What?”

The expressions of the two old men changed drastically. Their bodies moved and they flew directly towards the medicinal garden.

When they saw the five old men lying in the room, their faces revealed an embarrassed expression.

“A fatal blow. With their strength, how could they be killed in one blow? Unless it’s someone they are familiar with, they would have a chance!”

An old man saw the wounds on the corpses on the ground and the puppet lying on the side.

There was no sign of struggle or battle at all. He analyzed with an embarrassed expression.

He turned his head and stared at the middle-aged man with a fierce gaze.

“Lord Oracle, it’s not me. I want to enter the herb garden to tidy up the spiritual herbs, but without lord mo Qian’s permission, I have no right to enter. After shouting for a long time without an answer, I knocked on the door. In the end, the door was directly opened and I saw...”

The middle-aged man said with a face full of fear, his face full of sweat.

When the two elders saw the middle-aged man’s expression, they had already made a judgment in their hearts.

Under the circumstances where the immortal God had decreed that killing was prohibited, no one dared to offend the dignity of the Immortal God.

“Let’s go to the herb garden and take a look!”

An Elder’s heart moved, and he flew directly to the sky above the herb garden. When he saw the empty herb garden inside, his expression immediately became unsightly.

“Someone actually came to snatch the medicinal garden. How audacious, truly courting death!”

The old man’s face was filled with anger as he shouted.

“Not good, manager Wang of the Thousand Tool Workshop has been killed!”

Right at this moment, a terrified voice suddenly came from the street not far away.

The old man’s expression changed. Only now did he remember that all the members of Netherkill had not arrived. A bad premonition suddenly welled up in his heart.

“Let’s Go!”

The two old men moved and flew directly towards the street.

“Who is it? Who Killed My Father!”

Suddenly, another furious voice sounded, causing the two old men’s expressions to instantly become ugly.

“Let’s go to the shop to take a look first!”

The two old men exchanged a glance and immediately went to the sky above the shop.

The people passing by below looked inside with astonished expressions.

The two old men directly entered the shop and saw an old man lying on the ground with a child puppet beside him.

All the spiritual artifacts in the shop had disappeared!

“Don’t touch the corpse. Don’t go in!”
