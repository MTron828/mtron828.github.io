2661 With the outbreak of the 2661 war..

“Huh?”

Wang Xian was slightly taken aback when he heard the chief’s words last month.

The rest of the forces around him also frowned slightly as they looked over with a twinkle in their eyes.

Should the Dragon Palace send Dragon Peak to guard the Northern Line of defense as well?

“The Dragon Palace has also obtained quite a number of abyss seeds during the previous few wars. They must have also obtained quite a number of resources.”

“Even the Dragon Python group has given 10% of the resources to the Dragon Palace. The Dragon Palace should join in as well.”

As soon as the leader of last month finished his sentence, an elder of last month who was seated at the side spoke faintly.

“You Want Our Dragon Palace to send people to guard together with you? I’m sorry, our Dragon Palace is not a force on the demon island. The northern front is also not our territory.”

Wang Xian looked at the few people from last month’s sect and shook his head.

What a joke. Wang Xian would never allow the Dragon Palace to be completely embroiled in this war.

There was no planet from the Dragon Palace in the northern front. How could he pledge his life to guard this place.

“Dragon King, you guys have obtained so many abyss seeds here. Now that danger is approaching, do you want to escape immediately?”

“How can there be such a good thing in the world!”

However, just as Wang Xian finished his sentence, Yue Xingguang, who was on the right, berated him with a cold expression.

Ever since the last exchange meeting, the Moon Bay in the ancient lake was snatched away by the Dragon King. Furthermore, he was berated directly by the goddess of Frost, causing him to lose a lot of face.

He had always kept this grudge in his heart.

“After all, the Dragon King is not a force on the northern front. He has no responsibility or obligation to help us guard this place.”

One of the leaders of the Dragon Python group looked at Moonlight and said after a moment of hesitation.

“That’s true. We are very grateful that the Dragon King can help us. Even if we are facing a great crisis, we can’t force others to join us, not to mention that the Dragon Palace has helped us before.”

“The Dragon King and the others can decide the situation of the Dragon Palace. We are very grateful that the Dragon Palace can help us.”

As soon as the Dragon Python group finished speaking, the experts from the Beichuan sect and the ancient God dynasty immediately spoke up.

It could be said that the three forces owed the Dragon Palace a great favor.

At this time, they naturally had to speak up for the Dragon Palace.

If they didn’t speak up now, they would simply be ungrateful.

“HMM?”

Yue Xingguang’s expression changed slightly when he saw the experts speak up. He didn’t dare to interrupt.

In front of him, the Hierarch of last month frowned slightly. He looked at the Dragon Python Group, the Beichuan sect, and the ancient God dynasty.

“Since everyone has said so, then the Dragon Palace will decide for itself.”

The Hierarch of last month said expressionlessly.

“Let me say this first. If the Northern line really can’t be defended, or if we have to fight to the death, don’t take our Dragon Palace into consideration.”

“We will still take action next. However, we will leave immediately if we can’t resist.”

Wang Xian looked at them and said directly.

Once they really encountered a crisis, Wang Xian would not hesitate at all. He would leave this place immediately and stay away from danger.

“Alright!”

The sect leader of last month frowned slightly and nodded.

Beside him, some of the powerhouses from last month were slightly dissatisfied.

“Next, let’s discuss the military combination.”

Last Month’s Hierarch opened his mouth and said.

Next, let’s discuss the joint battle.

A group of disciples from the forces’legions joined together and were responsible for guarding each battle line.

Moreover, the forces formed a support corps. Whichever side of the Abyss was stronger and exceeded the range of resistance, they would directly send people to support.

The group of factions chatted for about an hour.

“Dragon King, we will thank all of you after the Battle of the Abyss.”

After the group finished their discussion, Wang Xian and the rest flew out of the invite Moon Planet.

The experts from the Dragon Python group, the Beichuan sect, and the ancient God dynasty greeted Wang Xian politely.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded at them and flew towards the Dragon Peak.

“Sect leader, the Dragon Palace is obviously taking the opportunity to earn the abyssal seed crystals. They don’t want to take any risks. They are too despicable and cunning!”

In the Palace of the great sect last month, an elder couldn’t help but speak up when he saw the group of forces leaving.

“That’s right, sect leader. Furthermore, the goddess of Frost didn’t give us any face at all. Now...”

“That’s enough!”

Yue Xingguang opened his mouth to speak, but he was interrupted by the Hierarch before he could finish.

The others immediately shut their mouths and didn’t dare to continue discussing.

...

“If the Dragon King isn’t willing, we can’t force the Beichuan sect, the Dragon Python group, and the Ancient God dynasty to owe the Dragon Palace a favor. Even if we know that they’re after the abyssal seed, with the Dragon Palace, we can still reduce our losses.”

“There’s no need to embarrass the Dragon Palace. We can’t do anything even if the other party leaves.”

The sect master of last month waved his hand lightly. “Prepare for the Alliance.”

“Yes!”

The experts of last month’s great sect nodded.

Apart from Yue Xingguang, an elder, and a few godly monarchs, most of the experts didn’t have much of an opinion about the dragon palace.

Just as the sect master had said, they could not force it.

“Dragon King!”

“How is it? How long will it take for the modification of the Dragon Peak to be completed?”

At the same time, Wang Xian rushed to the Dragon Peak and asked the Heaven Array with a smile on his face.

“Although the Dragon Peak has a foundation, it will still take seven to eight days.”

...

The Heaven Array replied.

“Seven to eight days. There should be enough time.”

Wang Xian nodded his head and looked at the location of the Abyss ahead.

From time to time, roars could be heard from the abyss. Countless abyssal seeds were gathering.

According to the rate at which the abyssal seeds were gathering, a war might break out in ten days at most. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

In the next few days, the entire northern front underwent a reorganization.

Compared to the past, it was more reasonable to assign legions to guard the front of the planets.

Moreover, in order to provide reinforcements as soon as possible, a teleportation formation was set up in the northern front to provide timely support.

It could be said that the alliance of the Northern Front would reduce their losses by at least double.

Naturally, the Dragon Palace did not participate in this. Wang Xian had been staying on the Dragon Peak for the past few days and had also learned some formations of the Heaven Formation.

“Master, the northern front is preparing to launch a joint attack tomorrow morning.”

On the afternoon of the eighth day, Wang Xian received a message from bei Shuang.

“Is it going to explode?”

Wang Xian mumbled as he looked ahead with a smile.

The Dragon Peak had been completely transformed a few hours ago.

After the transformation, the power of the Dragon Peak had increased by more than ten times!

“Get Ready. The battle will start tomorrow. Let’s see if we can gain some benefits.”

Wang Xian joked with a smile on his face.

“Alright, Dragon King. Let’s show the entire northern front forces our strength.”

Sky array nodded confidently.

Wang Xian smiled and looked at the interior of the Dragon Peak.

This upgrade mainly increased the strength of the heaven’s Eye Arrow Division and the Strange Demon, followed by the Starwood Dragon species.

On the arrow platform below, there were over 10,000 undying god King level archers!

Next, it was time to display their true strength!
