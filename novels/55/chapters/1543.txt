Chapter 1544: 1544 suppressing all heaven’s favorites 7

A voice filled with a domineering aura and a faint questioning tone.

When everyone around heard this voice, they were slightly shocked and quickly looked behind them.

Even he yuan and he suiwen looked behind them with grave expressions.

There were seven to eight young men behind the two young men. The two young men in the lead walked in front and no one dared to take even half a step behind them.

The two young men wore black and white clothes, and the most eye-catching thing was that they each wore a crown on their heads.

On the black and white clothes, one of them wrote “I am the only one in the sky,”and the other wrote “I am the only one in the Earth!”!

There was a hint of disdain in their eyes, as if they did not put the entire world in their eyes.

“I am the only one in the sect, I am the only two heaven’s favorites in the sky and the Earth.”.

Outsiders called them the heaven’s pride experts and the Earth’s pride experts!

“Heaven’s pride experts, Earth’s pride experts!”

“Heaven’s pride experts, Earth’s pride experts!”

Compared to He Yuan’s arrival, the arrival of the two heaven’s pride experts from the Solitaire sect made everyone quickly bow and call out respectfully.

This kind of honorable status did not only come from their strength, but also the faction behind them.

The Super Faction, the Solitaire sect.

From the name, one could see that this was a very overbearing sect.

The solitaire sect’s motto was that as long as it involved cultivation, they were the only ones who were supreme.

Therefore, every disciple of the solitaire sect had an aura that surpassed everyone else.

They were high and mighty, not afraid of anyone. Their strong confidence was the source of their strength.

As the two supreme geniuses of the solipsistic sect, their strength and aura were even more overbearing.

The arrogance that came from their bones was something that even the core disciples of first-rate forces would feel inferior to.

“When we arrived, someone said that everyone here is trash. Hehe!”

Young Master Tian, who was standing on the left, had a smile on his face. He swept his gaze across everyone and finally landed on he suiwen.

“I give you permission to reorganize your words!”

As he spoke, he stared at he suiwen with a smile on his face. The aura that dominated everything around him slowly spread out.

He Suiwen’s expression instantly changed when he saw the two supreme prodigies of the Solitaire sect staring at him.

Even he yuan, who was standing beside him, had a grave expression on his face.

He Yuan was able to compare to the prodigies of a super force because he was very young and he had powerful beast taming abilities.

In fact, in terms of strength, he yuan was still slightly weaker than them. It could only be said that his potential in the future was not weaker than them, or even higher than them.

However, at the moment, he was still very afraid of young master Tian and young master di.

“Hehe!”

He suiwen saw that the people of Solitaire sect were staring at him, and he smiled awkwardly. He clenched his fists and squeezed out a smile.

“Other than the people from the solipsistic sect, the rest are all trash!”

There was a hint of unwillingness in his voice, but he suiwen couldn’t do anything about it. The strength and dominance of the solipsistic sect was not something the he suiwen family could withstand.

Wang Xian looked at he suiwen and then at young master Tian and young master di from the solipsistic sect. His eyes flickered.

“I’m very satisfied!”

Upon hearing he suiwen’s words, young master Tian nodded with a smile on his face.

He was high and mighty.

It was as if a king was praising a subject.

A Heaven’s pride expert like he suiwen of the He suiwen family could only lower his head helplessly.

“Young Master Tian, young master Di!”

At this moment, Bing Jinghuan walked over with slight respect and called out to the two heaven’s pride experts of the Solitaire sect respectfully once again.

“Is Wu Qing city still not here?”

Young Master Tian glanced at Bing Jinghuan and asked.

“Young Master Tian, the Crown Prince of Wu Qing city is still not here?”

Bing Jinghuan replied respectfully.

The relationship between the Ice Heart Empire and the Solitaire sect was relatively close. Of course, this was because one of them was the leader and the other was the little brother.

The ninth prince, Bing Jinghuan, could only be respectful in front of the two current leaders of the Solitaire sect.

“I heard that your patriarch has taken in an outstanding last disciple. He is very powerful. Who Is He?”

Young Master Earth looked at the people of the Bingxin Empire and asked indifferently.

“Young Master Earth, this junior sister Jian ‘er is our patriarch’s last disciple. She is at the second level of the profound void martial stage and has very strong combat strength!”

Bing Jing Huan immediately gestured to Ling Jian ‘ER and said with a smile.

“Young Master Tian, young master Di!”

Ling Jian ‘er hugged her sword and cupped her hands at them.

“Not bad, not bad!”

Young master di sized up Ling Jian ‘er and nodded his head faintly.

“Brother Wang Xian, isn’t that... isn’t that the person you’re looking for?”

When the people from the solipsistic sect arrived, everyone around them stopped talking. Their eyes were focused on the two young masters of Heaven and earth.

When he Yuanlin Yaoyao and the rest saw Ling Jian ‘er, they were shocked and couldn’t help but exclaim.

They knew that because of this woman in front of them, Wang Xian had transformed into a heavenly demon and destroyed the entire ancient demon city. He had massacred millions of people.

Wang Xian had come to the vast region to look for this woman!

The exclamations of he yuan and the rest caused everyone to look over. When they saw that they were staring at Ling Jian ‘er, they were slightly surprised and curious.

“Okay!”

Wang Xian ignored the surrounding gazes and nodded at he yuan. He sighed in his heart and looked at Ling Jian ‘er. “She is not dead. However, there are some problems!”

“Brat, what are you looking at!”

“I’m warning you. If you dare to Pester Junior Sister Bing ‘er again in the future, I will make sure you die without a burial ground no matter who you are!”

When she saw Wang Xian’s gaze, Bing Jinghuan stared at him with a gloomy expression. A hint of killing intent flashed in his eyes as he shouted coldly.

“You don’t have the right to say that!”

Wang Xian swept a cold glance at Bing Jinghuan.

“Oh? Interesting?”

Young Master Tian looked at Wang Xian and Bing Jinghuan and smiled with interest.

“Young Master Tian, young master Di, this fellow is very arrogant. He pestered junior sister Jian ‘er repeatedly and even said that the daughter of light is trash!”

Bing jinghuan stared at Wang Xian and took a deep breath before speaking to them.

“Daughter of Light? Hehe, you dare to say that Wu Qingyan is trash? How interesting. The Wang Xian that he suiwen mentioned just now was you, right? Looking at him, he admitted that he is inferior to you. I am a little curious!”

Young Master Tian looked at Wang Xian curiously as he spoke.

“What is your current realm? What is your background?” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

He asked Wang Xian lightly.

His tone was high and mighty, as though he was questioning the background and identity of a servant.

He Yuan and the rest frowned slightly when they heard young master Tian’s question.

Wang Xian looked over expressionlessly when he heard young master Tian’s words.

“Are you talking to me?”

He looked at young master Tian indifferently and asked.

“Haha, interesting. However, I don’t want to repeat myself a second time!”

Young Master Tian laughed out loud when he heard Wang Xian’s words. He stared at Wang Xian and continued to speak indifferently.

The atmosphere froze instantly!
