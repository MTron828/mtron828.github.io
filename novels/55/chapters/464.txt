Chapter 465: Pilgrimage (3)

“Wow, there are many people!”

“Yes, it’s way too much. Look over there. It’s Shengling Sect.”

“That is the Dark Sect. Over there is Imperial Beast Sect. Gosh, many Sacred Sects are here today!”

At least five thousand people were heading to that island on the following morning.

Those people came from various ancestral sects and clans, in which some were formidable Sacred Sects and Sacred Clans. All these dominating forces embarked on a trip to the island on their vessels.

All the clans and sects were in awe when they stood on their vessels. As they scanned the surroundings, they had only astonishment on their faces.

Too many clans and ancestral sects came from the Underworld. On top of that, all of them were formidable ones.

Those second-tier and below were not qualified to attend.

At least more than a score of first-class forces and six Saint-class forces were present. Over a hundred vessels steered towards the island.

“That’s spectacular. Let’s go over there too!”

At the seaside, a group of more than thirty people came on a vessel, following another vessel to the island.

“Hur? Congratulations to Thistles and Thorns Sect!”

“Sect Leader Tang, congratulations to Thistles and Thorns Sect that has upgraded to a first-class sect. I’m so happy for you!”

“Sect Leader Tang, I really envy you guys!”

While they were heading towards the island, the Martial Artists beside their vessels spotted them. Immediately, they congratulated Sect Leader Tang with envy.

The group of more than thirty people was from Thistles and Thorns Sect. It was an honor for them to be here today.

Seeing those powerful forces, who he used to look up to, congratulating them fervently with envy, everyone from Thistles and Thorns Sect was proud and thrilled.

“Hehe, it’s just a stroke of luck. I will not be the Sect Leader of Thistles and Thorns Sect anymore in the future. I’m getting old, and it’s time to give up my seat. Haha!” said Sect Leader Tang to the surrounding people with a beaming face as he cupped his fists.

“It’s more than just luck!”

The surrounding forces looked at Thistles and Thorns Sect with envy since the sister of the Dragon King was a disciple of Thistles and Thorns Sect. She would be taking over the Sect Leader role in the future.

From now on, who would dare to provoke Thistles and Thorns Sect with the Dragon King and Dragon Sect around?

So long as the Dragon Sect was around, Thistles and Thorns Sect would have nothing to worry about.

This was what many of the first-class forces envied.

“It’s right in front of another island.”

“I heard it’s a floating island. The legendary floating island, aka an ancient wonderland!”

The group of forces on the vessel were envious when they saw the beautiful island in spring colors.

The floating island was able to travel freely in the ocean. Given such a base camp, it was a treasure that every force yearned.

All of them looked over and spotted four Dragon Sect experts standing at the entrance of the island. Mo Yuan was there to receive them.

“Compared to the Pilgrimage of Flame Palace not long ago, this Pilgrimage far exceeds the Flame Palace!” said one of the Sect Leaders of ancestral sects who went for the Flame Palace’s Pilgrimage with a slight exclaim. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Back then, only four to five first-class forces had attended the Pilgrimage of Flame Palace. None of the Sacred Sects had turned up.

Yet, almost seventy percent of the first-class forces from the Underworld would be attending the Pilgrimage of Dragon Sect this time.

Many of the Sacred Sects and Sacred Clans were here too.

“Dragon King, these are the things we got from Medical Saint Sect and Qiao Clan!”

Back in the hall of the floating island, the entire island was undergoing construction. Only a few temporary buildings were done.

“So little?”

Seeing the items before him, Wang Xian frowned as he shook his head in disappointment.

“When we arrived at the Medical Saint Sect and Qiao Clan, they had all the things moved. Even the Spiritual Grasses in their herb garden were pulled out. They even smashed the things that they were unable to take away,” Mo Qinglong replied with bitterness. He cast his sights on the big alchemy furnace in the center and said, “This alchemy furnace is considered to be the most precious thing in the Medical Saint Sect.”

“Mm!”

Wang Xian nodded as he observed the two-meter alchemy furnace.

The entire furnace was purple in color, which looked extremely prestigious.

[Lilac Mist Alchemy Furnace: Level 10]

[Contains purplish Heavenly Flame]

“A Level 10 alchemy furnace can refine Level 10 elixir pills. This alchemy furnace should be one of the most precious treasures in Medical Saint Sect!”

Wang Xian looked at the alchemy furnace with a glimmer of surprise.

This trip proved to be worthwhile, given this alchemy furnace.

“This alchemy furnace was extremely heavy for anyone, even for Inborn Experts, to carry. Besides, it was durable. Hence, it was left behind by them,” said Mo Qinglong.

Wang Xian nodded. “Set the furnace in a room and make it an elixir refining room!”

“Yes, Dragon King!”

Mo Qinglong nodded and continued, “Most of the forces who are here for the Pilgrimage have arrived!”

“Let’s go over!”

Wang Xian nodded, revealing a smile at the corner of his lips.

As he moved to the site for Pilgrimage, Wang Xian already spotted some of the formidable forces waiting on the island.

Seeing the arrival of Wang Xian, everyone cast their gaze over with surprise, shock, and admiration.

“Greetings to the Dragon King!”

“Greetings to the Dragon King!”

As soon as he arrived, one of them went over to Wang Xian and greeted him respectfully.

The remaining people from the rest of the forces greeted Wang Xian with their fists cupped.

This greeting was a form of respect to an expert and, at the same time, a form of respect to a Sect Master who had established a Sacred Sect.

“Thank you all for coming.”

Seeing all the forces standing before him with awe, Wang Xian revealed a smile and said, “At Dragon Sect, we’ll not seek anyone’s trouble unless someone provokes us. We only have fifty disciples in Dragon Sect, but they follow the same rules when they roam the Underworld. As such, I hope we can live in harmony.” Wang Xian laughed as he spoke. He swept his gaze across everyone. “However, we will not give up any resources in the Underworld. Till then, strength will determine!”

His words sounded mild and, at the same time, expressed the attitude Dragon Sect would adopt in the future.

All the surrounding forces heaved a sigh of relief when they heard this.

Before the establishment of the Dragon Sect, the Dragon King was notorious in the Underworld for countless killings. They were terrified that the Dragon Sect would act overbearing and barbarous.

As for the resources in the Underworld, it was a common thing. Competing for the treasures in the Underworld based on strength would not invite any complaints.

“Dragon King is magnanimous. Shengling Sect is willing to get along with Dragon Sect. Several of our seniors here are representing Shengling Sect to deliver some congratulatory gifts to Dragon Sect!”

An old man from Shengling Sect smiled and cupped his fist to Wang Xian. Subsequently, he beckoned to the back.

Making a tribute was, of course, the way to express the friendliness from Shengling Sect.

After Shengling Sect, the various Sacred Sects also sent their gifts.

As for those first-class forces, they paid tribute with all kinds of Spiritual Grasses and treasures.

Wang Xian received them with a face full of smiles.

This is the true-blue pilgrimage!

Xiao Clan and Sui Clan were sitting by the side, watching it with beaming faces.

“Hur?”

Suddenly, the eldest son of Sui Huang, sitting in the middle, had an abrupt change in his expression when he received a message from a disciple.

“What? Did you say something happened to your father?”

His eyes were wide with panic.

“Uncle, Grandpa is seriously injured now. Old Huang of Sacred Followers Guild is now with our clan with severe injuries too!”
