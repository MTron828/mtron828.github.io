(‘I’m telling you, don’t tell anyone else! ”

“Forget it, everyone else knows anyway. ”

The maid saw Wang Xian looking at her curiously and transmitted her voice to him.

“Our young master doesn’t have a father! ”

The maid added.

“Doesn’t have a father?”

Her words still caused Wang Xian to have some doubts.

Was Mu Liyin c er abandoned?

Mu Liyin c er looked very beautiful?

To be able to be described as very beautiful by Wang Xian, she was usually the most top-notch and almost impeccable!

And that was indeed the case. Mu Liyin ‘ER’s looks were very exquisite.

Perhaps it was because she had given birth before, but she had a unique charm that other girls did not have.

“It’s fine as long as you know this. Don’t ask too much.”

The maid continued to speak to Wang Xian!

Wang Xian nodded. There was no such gossip.

Tianci did not have a father. Without a doubt, he had abandoned his wife, abandoned his children, and got pregnant before marriage.

“Uncle, come and play. Come and Play! ”

Tianci’s voice could be heard from the front again.

Wang Xian shook his head at him.

Mu Liyin ‘er whispered something to Tianci as well. She didn’t call for him anymore.

An hour later, Tianci was tired from playing. He prepared Mu Liyin ‘er to bring him back to his room.

Wang Xian returned to his room again and continued to sit cross-legged to recover.

However, a few hours later, Tianci ran into his room again!

“I want to sleep with uncle, not mom!”

Tianci hugged the blanket and climbed onto Wang Xian ‘s bed happily.

“Alright, go to sleep! ”

Wang Xian saw it and nodded with a smile.

Tianci was right in front of him. As long as his mother had no objections, Wang Xian naturally had no objections!

The ancestral tree entered his body. In less than ten seconds, Tianci had already fallen asleep.

“Wang Xian, sorry to trouble you. This child insisted on sleeping with you.

Sorry to disturb you! ”

Very soon, Mu Liyin’er’s voice was transmitted.

“Hehe, it’s alright. Pll be recuperating at the side. It Won’t affect me in any way. Let Tianci Sleep Here! ”

Wang Xian immediately transmitted his voice!

Mu Liyin ‘er replied. Standing at the door, her face revealed helplessness and bitterness!

The son that she gave birth to did not follow her biological mother. Instead, he followed an outsider!

This made him very sad!

If he did not give birth to this son, he would even doubt if this was his own son!

Next, Wang Xian sat cross-legged and continued to cultivate!Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

There was no sun or moon to recover from his injuries!

However, after Tianci woke up, he took a glance at Wang Xian and left!

After more than ten hours, he returned to sleep!

Wang Xian did not know how long he had been cultivating.

On this day, Lin Niu sent him a message telling him that he had arrived!

Wang Xian opened his eyes and immediately took out a communication device to reply!

Not long after, Lin Niii’s figure appeared in front of Wang Xian.

With Lin Niu’s current strength, Mu Liyin ‘er and the rest wouldn’t be able to sense him even if he came in!

“Boss, your injuries are so serious. Take these herbs and divine fruits to heal your injuries first!”

Lin Niu said to Wang Xian!

Give him some resources to recover his injuries.

Wang Xian nodded his head and swallowed it directly.

“Although I’m injured this time, Pll be lucky if I don’t Die! ”

Wang Xian smiled and told Lin Niu about his encounter with the ultimate treasure of the Heaven’s origin!

“What? Boss, you actually encountered the ultimate treasure of the Heaven’s origin? That ultimate treasure is actually a little boy who has fused with the life of a little boy. This… ?”

Lin Niu widened his eyes and revealed a shocked expression on his face!

“Yes, but Tianci’s mother saved my life. Therefore, Pm not planning to take away the ultimate treasure of Tianyuan. Let’s see if I can get some other good fortune by following him around! ”

“In addition, it will also help him grow up. In the future, it can be considered a good karma! ”

Wang Xian nodded and said to Lin Niu!

Heaven’s Gift’s mother saving him was also a good deed for Heaven’s Gift!

Naturally, Wang Xian also wanted to form a good relationship with him!

“Boss is indeed a boss. There are very few people in the entire universe who can achieve your level. You are indeed the boss of me, Lin Niu! ”

When Lin Niu heard that, he flattered him!

However, his face was filled with admiration!

To be able to stand in front of an ultimate treasure of the Heaven’s origin without any emotion or greed, there were too few people who could do it!

A treasure of this level could cause brothers to turn against each other and father and son to become enemies!

Wang Xian shook his head. “Alright, wait for my information in the Mother

“Yes, Boss!”

Lin Niu nodded and entered the mother nest!

At the same time, Lin Niu took out all the resources.

This included the corpse of a Tianyuan powerhouse with the darkness attribute that Wang Xian asked him to take away!

“Let’s see if there are any treasures in the corpse of this heaven origin creator. ”

Wang Xian sensed this corpse and looked over!

Wang Xian didn’t have the time to look at this corpse when he was killing it!

His mind stirred and he began to search!

He obtained an interspatial ring from the corpse!

The interspatial ring was very easy to open. When Wang Xian opened it and saw what was inside, he was astonished.

“There are so many treasures. Why does this guy have so many treasures on him

Wang Xian was delighted!

In his interspatial ring, there were many resources. Some of them contained a huge amount of energy.

There was even one treasure that contained energy that had reached the level of Heaven’s origin creation!

What Wang Xian didn’t know was that the figure had so many resources on him.

It was because the figure didn’t think that it would be dangerous for him to enter the six paths universe!

Furthermore, most of the resources were the rewards given to him by the Void Universe’s powerhouses!

The Void Universe’s powerhouses had invited a heaven’s origin creation to help attack the unknown mastermind!

Ordinary Heavenly Yuan creator realm experts weren’t willing to accept such a mission!

Only the two control-level existences, Tian Men Gong and Xi Ning Gong, managed to find one light shadow!

This was because they didn’t know how many Heavenly Yuan creator realm experts were behind this mission!

Once they joined in, it could be said that they wanted to become enemies with the mastermind.

Become his mortal enemy!

In fact, the mastermind might even be a heaven origin creation from the 9-origin universe.

In other words, he was going to become the enemy of the 9 -origin universe!

Which Heaven origin creation dared to offend the 9 -origin universe?

Since the light figure agreed to accept this mission, the reward was naturally not cheap!

In fact, this revenge was taken out by five to six heaven origin creation realm powerhouses from the Void Universe.

These resources were extremely valuable to a heaven origin powerhouse with the darkness attribute.

Otherwise, the light shadow wouldn’t have taken such a risk.

However, all these resources belonged to Wang Xian now!

There was even a corpse left behind!

“Are these resources enough to upgrade the Taiji Dragon Plate?”

Wang Xian’s heart was suddenly burning with passion!
