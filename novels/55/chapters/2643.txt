“PFFT, I want your autograph. TSK TSK TSK, an actor’s autograph. You’re embarrassing us all!”

At the other entrance of the auction house, three women in skirts stood there, looking at Imperial Star Lady with a face full of mockery. Their eyes were filled with disdain!

“Hehe, since you’re embarrassed, why are you still calling me? Aren’t you being cheap?”

Emperor star lady heard their sarcasm and said with a cold expression!

“Hahaha, calling us cheap? I don’t know who it is, but I heard that our star Goddess is being kept by the leader of a force. TSK TSK TSK, an old man who is hundreds of thousands of years old, even the star Goddess is willing to do that!”

“It seems that our star goddess has sacrificed a lot for this disciple competition!”

“Not only has she sacrificed a lot, she has given her all, hahaha!”

The mocking voice came from the three women’s mouths, and it was exceptionally ear-piercing!

Upon hearing their words, imperial star Lady revealed an angry expression!

“Are you asking for a beating?”

Imperial star lady narrowed her eyes slightly and stared coldly at the three of them!

“What? You want to teach us a lesson? Tomorrow, we will let everyone know that actors are ultimately actors, and in this world, the strong are respected!”

The woman in the center stared coldly at Imperial Star Lady and said!

“You don’t need to wait until tomorrow, just the three of You Trash?”

Imperial Star Lady’s Palm moved, and the Dragon Blood Sword appeared in her hand!

At the same time, she threw something out, and it instantly enveloped the four of them!

“Imperial Star Lady, you are courting death. You want to spar with us at this time?”

The three girls’faces were filled with coldness when they saw Imperial Star Lady Unleashing The Sparring Formation!

“I’ll teach you three loathsome fellows a lesson today!”

Imperial star lady snorted coldly, and the dragon blood sword in her hand casually waved at the three of them!

“You’re looking for a beating!”

The three girls let out a cold growl, and a long whip and two sharp swords attacked Imperial Star Lady!

“Bang! Bang! Bang!” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

However, what shocked the three girls was that the sharp swords and long whips in their hands instantly collapsed after being hit by the energy of the Dragon Blood Sword!

“How is this possible!”

The three girls’faces changed drastically. As disciples of the imperial court, the weapons in their hands were not ordinary weapons. Although they were not very powerful divine weapons, they were still very powerful!

Now, they were actually defeated in an instant!

“With your strength, you are not even worthy to be my maids!”

The Imperial Star Lady casually slashed the dragon blood sword in her hand again, and a powerful energy directly slashed toward the three of them!

“Not good!”

The three girls instantly panicked and hurriedly dodged to the side!

“Pu Pu Pu!”

However, in the next moment, the sword light landed on their bodies, and instantly, deep wounds appeared on their bodies!

“How can you be so strong?”

The three girls’faces changed drastically, and they shouted in disbelief!

“Humph, if you meet me in the future, you’d better take a detour. Otherwise, don’t blame me for being impolite!”

Emperor star lady coldly swept her gaze over the three of them, and with a wave of her arm, she withdrew the sparring formation!

“You, you...”

The three girls’faces changed drastically, and their hearts trembled!

A few years ago, the imperial star Lady’s strength was about the same as theirs, only at the level of an eternal God Lord rank 5. How could she be so strong now?

In the past few years, in order to increase their strength, they had casually eaten medicinal pills, but they had only increased by one rank!

But the imperial star Lady was able to easily defeat them!

Under their senses, she had at least the strength of an eternal God lord rank 8 or 9!

This strength was enough to compete for the position of Empress!

“Get lost!”

The empress stared at the three of them and shouted softly!

“Go!”

The three girls were somewhat unwilling. They looked at each other in fear and left immediately!

“How could her strength increase so quickly?”

“It must be that the old man who kept her must have given her a powerful pill or treasure. Otherwise... otherwise...”

The three of them covered their wounds as they growled in a low voice with pale faces!

They did not lack pills for cultivation either. The only thing that could rapidly increase their strength was their aptitude and talent!

A few years ago, their strength was about the same, so they must have encountered a great opportunity...

...

Moreover, they had also heard from other disciples that the Imperial Star Lady was now very close to the leader of a decent faction!

Hence, there were female disciples who claimed that she was kept by a leader of a faction!

There was indeed such a possibility. After all, in the eyes of the disciples like them, the entertainment industry was just a filthy disciple!

Those so-called celebrities were just actresses in their eyes!

And with their status and status, celebrities were indeed actresses!

“Hehe, you’re pretty impressive!”

“But why didn’t I know that you were kept by an old man?”

Wang Xian was watching from the side with a smile. When he saw the Empress defeating the three women in a domineering manner, he asked teasingly!

“HMPH, I think you deserve a beating too!”

The Empress Glared at Wang Xian and raised the Dragon Blood Sword in her hand!

“TSK TSK, you want to beat me up with the Dragon Blood Sword that I gave you? Sigh, you’re so heartless!”

...

Wang Xian smiled!

“Shut up. HMPH, that bunch of them actually said that I was taken care of by an old man. Damn it!”

The Imperial Star Lady said hatefully!

At the side, the staff of the auction house were not affected by this scene at all!

On the island of the imperial court, after setting up a sparring formation without destroying the buildings, they could spar at any time!

Of course, it was forbidden for the disciples of the imperial court to fight for their lives. Once someone died, regardless of whether it was right or wrong, they would be executed immediately!

“Young master and Miss, please take out the items that you sent for auction. Our auction house will appraise them before we confirm whether they are qualified to be auctioned!”

The staff asked Wang Xian and the rest!

“I happened to find this drop of soul-returning liquid in a treasure ground. As long as a drop of blood is added into the soul-returning liquid, the main body will be able to revive from the soul-returning liquid once it is dead. It is definitely a priceless treasure!”

As Wang Xian spoke, he took out a jade bottle. There was a drop of grey liquid in the jade bottle!

The grey liquid was emitting a mysterious energy!

When the staff heard Wang Xian’s words, his heart skipped a beat!

“Young master, we will ask the experts from the auction house to appraise it immediately. Please wait a moment!”

The staff immediately spoke to Wang Xian and walked towards the back with the jade bottle!

“Eh? Star Lady, did they run away with my treasure?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and asked when he saw the staff member leaving with the soul-returning liquid!

“You’re thinking too much. Even if your soul-returning liquid has such a miraculous effect, it won’t run away. This is something that the imperial court opened ourselves!”

Bei Shuang rolled her eyes at him and said!

“That’s hard to say. My soul-returning liquid can be said to be a supreme treasure, a treasure that can save one’s life!”

Wang Xian smiled. However, he also believed bei Shuang’s words!

The imperial court wouldn’t do such a thing!

“It’s indeed a treasure that can save one’s life. The fruits above your dragon throne are also not bad. Give me a few of them in the future!”

The imperial star lady nodded her head slightly and said casually!

“Dream On!”

Wang Xian glanced at her!
