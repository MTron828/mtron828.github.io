Chapter 460: Annihilating Sacred Sects (1)

Everyone was stunned and looked in shock and fear at Wang Xian.

Xiao Quanshan, members of the Xiao Clan and Sui Clan were taken by surprise as they looked towards the disciples of the Dragon Sect.

Clearly, it was impossible for Dragon Sect to go against the Medical Saint Sect, Qiao Clan and the other forces.

Although Dragon Sect had fifty Inborn experts that were stronger than the Medical Saint Sect, the coalition of the other parties had ninety Inborn experts.

Moreover, they had three unparalleled experts who had all reached the Dan Realm.

Without exaggerating, a Dan Realm expert could deal with thirty to forty Inborn experts alone if he wasn’t occupied by another Dan Realm expert.

That’s the strength and terrifying thing about a Dan Realm expert.

With three Dan Realm experts as opponents, how was he going to withstand them? What kind of strength would the Dragon Sect need to have to withstand their attacks?

“Alright, alright!”

The Supreme Elders of the Medical Saint Sect and the Laozu of Qiao Clan stared harshly at Wang Xian.

“You want to keep us here? In that case, we just have to kill all of you!”

“Arrogant brat! Kill him!”

Frenzied killing intent beamed from the eyes of the three unparalleled experts.

To keep them forever here and bury them on the island, the only way was to kill them!

“Kill! Today, our Medical Saint Sect will shred you into a million pieces!” the two Sect Leaders of the Medical Saint Sect growled hideously and instructed their disciples.

“Kill him and annihilate them!”

Fires of fury were smouldering in the eyes of the experts from the remaining seven forces. As long as the Sui Clan and Xiao Clan didn’t get involved, they had nothing to fear. They were a hundred percent certain that they would roll over the Dragon Sect.

“Kill!”

Qiao Clan and the other seven forces also struck.

The immense battle will and killing intent from ninety Inborn experts instantly ripped apart the clouds.

The ominous clouds in the skies were split in the middle by the terrifying aura and the entire island was shrouded in stifling pressure.

“The fight is really breaking out!”

“Oh my god! Although we are seven to eight thousand meters away, we can still feel the stifling aura from that island!”

“That’s close to two hundred Inborn experts! Now that they are clashing, it will be catastrophic!”

“This is too frightening. I really did not expect the fight to break out with both parties having relatively equal strength. I wonder how many will be dead at the end of this battle!”

At the beach, several thousand martial artists awaited the outcome. The terrifying and stifling pressure from the island made everyone shiver.

That’s the pressure from over a hundred Inborn experts and several unparalleled experts!

Everyone was fearful. If any Level 8 or 9 martial artists were to approach the area, they would probably be suffocated by the stifling pressure.

The terrifying aura and the killing intent over the island shocked everyone.

“Kill!”

On the island, Wang Xian looked towards the thousand-odd people from Medical Saint Sect, Qiao Clan and the seven other forces. Ruthlessness gleamed in his eyes as he shouted loudly.

“Kill!”

Devilish aura shot into the sky from the crowd of dragonians. The aura from fifty dragonians gathered together and a devilish dragon could be vaguely seen circling in the sky.

“Sis-in-law Qing Yue, enchant us! Let my master and I go teach those two old fools a lesson!”

Xiao Yu looked to Lan Qingyue and was eager to give it a go.

“Alright!” Lan Qingyue smiled and nodded her head. As she waved her arm, a stream of greyish mist gathered around Xiao Yu and Elder Fang.

When the stream of greyish mist entered into the body of Xiao Yu and Elder Fang, their aura exploded exponentially in an instant.

A black and greyish aura circled around them and horrifying energy was leaking out of their bodies.

Deathly, violent, dark.

“So strong!”

Elder Fang was shocked to feel the strength flowing in her body.

Her current self could totally match herself in the Skeletal Dragon form.

“Let the three of us finish those three old fools!” Lan Qingyue said with a smile as her body slowly levitated towards the sky.

“Alright!” Xiao Yu nodded her head in excitement.

Ka ka!

Behind each of their bodies, two skeletal wings extended out. As Xiao Yu and Elder Fang wiggled their wings, they flew towards the Supreme Elders from the Medical Saint Sect and Laozu of Qiao Clan together with Lan Qingyue.

“What?”

When the crowd from Sui Clan and Xiao Clan saw Xiao Yu and the other two girls charging towards the three unparalleled experts, they were both shocked and surprised.

“The energies they are emitting from their bodies are terrifying!”

Xiao Quanshan stared fervently at Xiao Yu, Lan Qingyue and Elder Fang. It was especially so for Lan Qingyue. From her, he felt an aura that sent a chill down his spine.

The greyish energy was terrifying.

“That girl has reached the Dan Realm!”

Xiao Quanshan’s eyes were filled with disbelief. His eyes widened and stared blankly at Lan Qingyue.

The legacy of the Ancient God Kun Breeder is really insane!

Looking at Lan Qingyue, Wang Xian was shocked.

This was the first time Lan Qingyue fought.

The greatest strength of the Ancient God Kun Breeder wasn’t in her battling capacity. Instead, it was in her ability to breed Kun and supporting others.

The Ancient God Kun Breeder could substantially increase the strength of her Kun. She could also release strong enchantments to strengthen the rest.

Just like how it was currently, Xiao Yu, Elder Fang and Lan Qingyue were connected by a greyish stream of energy in the sky.

Xiao Yu and Elder Fang’s strength was increased to the level of their Skeletal Dragon form directly and they could go against Dan Realm experts.

As for Lan Qingyue, who could increase the strength of others, her true battling strength wasn’t something that ordinary Dan Realm experts could withstand.

“Three little brats are challenging us!”

The Supreme Elders of Medical Saint Sect and Laozu of Qiao Clan felt insulted as they saw the three girls charging towards them.

However, they were shocked and in disbelief when they felt the heart-wrenching aura from them.

“You must be courting death!”

Killing intent flashed in the minds of the Supreme Elders of the Medical Saint Sect and Laozu of Qiao Clan.

A Supreme Elder of Medical Saint Sect waved both of his jade-green arms and dropped seeds onto the ground.

Ka ka ka!

As his arms glowed in a jade-green light, the seeds that had fallen onto the ground grew at a frantic speed to the astonishment of everyone. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

In an instant, several brambles grew to the size of over a few tens of meters tall.

These trees resembled tree demons as they waved their branches, which were rough and full of thorns.

As for the other Supreme Elder from the Medical Saint Sect, purplish flames emitted from his body and raged to over ten meters tall.

Dang dang dang!

A space filled with metal attribute energy appeared around the Laozu from Qiao Clan. Razor-sharp and invisible blades made of metal energy circled a radius of ten meters around him at all times.

Any creature that entered this space would be instantly killed.

That was the terrifying thing about Dan Realm experts. They could coalesce energy around their bodies, shape them and release attacks that covered the entire region.

Every action was just like a superpower!

“Compliments of the Light!”

“Rage and roar!”

At this moment, Sun Lingxiu and Guan Shuqing shouted from the ground.

Rays of light covered all fifty dragonians.

The Light did not disperse the darkness. On the contrary, the Light was protecting the darkness.
