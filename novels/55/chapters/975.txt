Chapter 976: Senior 0977? Useless!

Translator: 549690339

In the Demon Hunter Academy, having the strength of a transcendent-level 4 was already considered pretty good. In the future, when he graduated, he would be fought over by the various mercenary groups.

After all, a transcendent-level 4 expert around the age of 40 was still very young.

In East Sea city, there were many people who were still at transcendent-level 4 at the age of 100-200.

A transcendent level four at the age of 40 already had the possibility of becoming a top-notch powerhouse!

Wang Xian had reached transcendent level four at his current age. He was definitely a monster. He was already stronger than 70% of the people in Transcendence Academy.

“Trash from the useless mercenary group, don’t let some trash come and cripple my limbs. If you have the strength, come up yourself!”

Wang Xian stood on the arena and ignored Qin Shan and Qin Qing. He pointed at the young man in embroidered clothes from the young master’s mercenary group and mocked.

“You...”

The young man in embroidered robes’face that was changing violently gradually turned gloomy. He stared at Wang Xian with an extremely embarrassed expression.

The strength that Wang Xian displayed just now had given him a huge shock. He saw that Wang Xian was actually pointing at him and asking him to come up.

He was both angry and furious!

He was a sixth-grade student of the Demon Hunters Academy and a member of the famous young master’s mercenary group in the Academy.

And now, he was actually being mocked by a new student.

Even if this new student’s strength was somewhat monstrous.

But, this still made him incomparably furious.

Unforgivable!

“Haha, Good, Good, let me come up. Challenge me? Very good, very good!”

The youth in embroidered clothes was so angry that he laughed instead, and a savage expression appeared on his face.

His figure moved, directly jumping onto the arena. With a flick of his finger, a golden longsword appeared in his hand.

Following that, a set of armor appeared in front of him.

The armor shone with a golden glow. One look and one could tell that it was extraordinary.

Wearing it, the young man in embroidered clothes stared at Wang Xian coldly, the longsword in his hand pointed straight at Wang Xian. “Kid, don’t think that you can be arrogant just because you have some strength. Today, I will let you know the price of offending our young master’s mercenary group!”

“Hehe!”

Wang Xian smiled coldly. “Are you going to cripple your limbs?”

“It’s good that you know!”

The young man in embroidered clothes narrowed his eyes and said coldly.

“D * mn, Wang Xian actually challenged a senior of a higher grade. Furthermore, he is a member of the young master’s mercenary group!”

“The equipment on this senior is at transcendence level five. He is simply too rich. He is wearing a set of armor and weapons at transcendence level five!”

“This Wang Xian is courting death. With the weapons and armor on this senior, an ordinary transcendent level four powerhouse is no match for him!”

“He is too arrogant. Does he think that he can defeat a transcendent level four senior just by killing Qin Shan in an instant?”

All the surrounding students were stunned when they saw Wang Xian challenging a transcendent level four senior.

Especially when they saw the weapon and armor that the young senior in embroidered clothes took out, they were even more shocked.

This set of equipment was worth millions of middle-grade spirit stones!

“Cripple him, cripple him!”

Not far away from the arena, in the middle of class three’s students, Duan Qingwen muttered softly with a pale face.

When Wang Xian made his move just now, he did give him a fright.

When he recalled how he was displeased with him for the past two days and how he mocked him, he was even more alarmed.

If Wang Xian wanted to take revenge on him, he could easily toy with him to death!

“Your Young Master’s mercenary group is really annoying!”

Wang Xian looked at the young man in embroidered clothes. With a move of his palm, a red wooden sword appeared in his hand.

“Oh? Hehe, annoying? In the future, we will also be your nightmares!”

The young man in embroidered clothes gritted his teeth and raised his head slightly. He glanced at Qin Shan, who was lying on the ground, and Qin Qing, whose eyes were slightly red.

“How dare you attack Student Qin Shan with such force. Later on, I will make you pay back tenfold!”

He raised his voice and said loudly.

“Tenfold!”

Wang Xian sneered. He raised the longsword in his hand and attacked the young man in Brocade instantly.

“Today, I will teach you a good lesson!”

Seeing Wang Xian attacking him directly, the young man in Brocade shouted loudly. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

The golden longsword emitted a golden glow. The sword was like the sharp beak of a bird as it went straight for Wang Xian.

“Boom!”

Wang Xian waved the red longsword in his hand. Flames instantly engulfed the arena within a radius of a thousand meters.

Qin Qing’s expression changed slightly. She hugged her younger brother’s body and flew down immediately.

“They’re fighting!”

“They’re fighting! This Wang Xian is so confident. He actually dares to fight against a senior who is at level four of the supernatural realm!”

“No matter what, this Wang Xian is the strongest in our first grade!”

“Even if he is the strongest, he will still be defeated by a senior who is at level five of the supernatural realm in front of him!”

“That’s right!”

When the flames engulfed the entire arena, everyone was shocked as they started discussing.

Qin Qing and Qin Shan, who had come down, stared intently at the arena.

The Golden Light and flames blocked many people’s vision.

Those present had basically not reached transcendent-level 4, so they could not see the world that was enveloped by the flames and golden light clearly.

“Ahhhhh!”

However, very quickly, it could even be said that it happened in an instant.

Screams of pain could be heard from the arena.

The screams were filled with fear, as if they were facing the threat of death.

“What?”

“What’s going on?”

“It’s that senior’s voice.”.

The expressions of everyone who heard this voice changed drastically.

“Boom!”

At this moment, the flames and golden light on the arena instantly disappeared, and a body flew heavily towards the bottom of the arena.

And along with him were his arms.

Both of his arms had been chopped off!

Directly chopped off!

In the transcendent continent, two severed arms could be recovered, but the amount of spirit stones needed to recover the medicinal pills was at least tens of millions of middle-grade spirit stones.

Otherwise, it would be very difficult to recover.

Seeing the severed arms, everyone was stupefied.

“Ahhhh!”

“My arm, my arm!”

The hair of the young man heavily fell to the ground, and his face was filled with fear.

He shouted loudly, sounding extremely miserable.

Everyone was stunned, and when they saw the miserable state of the young man, they couldn’t help but retreat.

“This... this, Gulp!”

“Hiss ~”

Some people couldn’t help but swallow their saliva, while some people sucked in a breath of cold air, and their bodies couldn’t help but retreat.

To cut off both of his arms directly, such a brutal action would result in a huge execution in the demon Hunter College.

Such an action had a high possibility of being expelled from the Demon Hunter College.

He was actually so brutal!

So brutal!

“In the future, if anyone from your young master’s mercenary group Dares to bother me, I will cripple them and tell everyone in your young master’s mercenary group!”

“Also...”

Wang Xian raised his head and swept his gaze across the surroundings. Everyone met his gaze and avoided his gaze.

“In the future, if you provoke me, you have to think about whether you can bear the consequences!”

As he spoke, he smiled coldly and jumped off the stage.

“Trash!”

Seeing Qin Shan staring at him, Wang Xian said disdainfully and walked out.

Qin Shan’s face turned pale and Qin Qing clenched her fist tightly!
