3309 Under the 3308 Scorpion Destruction Imperial City

“HM?”

Right at this moment, a lich with a long scorpion tail and two huge clamps on his body suddenly froze.

He immediately took out the universe AI, and when he saw the information on it, his expression changed greatly.

He waved his arm, and a 100 meter sized city model appeared in front of him.

In the model of the city, there were a large number of divine tablets.

When he saw that 90% of the divine tablets had been broken, his pupils constricted slightly.

“What’s going on? What happened in Scorpion Imperial City?”

On the side, a lich expert saw the situation in the model of the city and his expression changed greatly. He immediately asked.

“Huff! Huff!”

The Great Lich with the scorpion tail was breathing rapidly, and his expression changed drastically.

“I don’t know. Scorpion Emperor City has been attacked by great beings. All universe knights and level seven great beings have been killed, and 80% of the other disciples have been killed. Roar! Damn it!”

Scorpion Emperor City leader roared furiously.

There were 12 main cities in their country, and each main city represented a blessed land.

It was equivalent to 1/12th of the power of their country.

And now it was destroyed.

A huge amount of power was lost.

“How can this be? There’s a thousand-faced scorpion in Scorpion Emperor City, how can it be destroyed so easily? Could there be a level 9 knight?”

In front, a level 8 knight roared with a serious expression.

“The scorpion imperial city has been destroyed?”

In the center, the Lich King looked over with a cold expression.

“Yes, Lord Lich King. Our scorpion imperial city has been destroyed. Only a few disciples have escaped and are now rushing towards us.”

The city lord of Scorpion Imperial City replied with a gloomy expression.

“Damn it, who did it? Who Dares to destroy our Scorpion Imperial City?”

“Reporting to Lord Lich King, a disciple of Scorpion Imperial City urgently greets you.”

At this moment, a lich came in from outside and bowed.

“Let him in immediately!”

The Lich King immediately replied.

“Lord Lich King, City Lord, our… Our Scorpion imperial city has been destroyed and countless of our experts and disciples have been killed. You must avenge us!”

A Lich walked over with a face full of grief and knelt in front of them.

“Who did this? !”

The Scorpion Imperial City Lord flew over with a trembling body and stared at him as he questioned.

“I don’t know either. It’s a Divine Dragon!”

The Lich’s body trembled and he shook his head. He waved his arm and an image appeared in front of them.

In the image, a divine dragon swept its tail and the terrifying energy caused the death of millions of scorpion imperial city disciples.

“Divine Dragon!”

All the experts of the Lich Kingdom looked gloomy when they saw the scene in the picture.

“At present, only the ancestral dragon, the Divine Light Dragon, and the Dragon Palace are powerful.”

A lich expert looked over and said in a low voice.

“A pure-blooded divine dragon with a pair of wings. This is the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace, the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace. I’ve seen this information on the artificial intelligence system.”

At this moment, a lich powerhouse growled in a low voice.

“Dragon King of the Dragon Palace? He must have eaten a bear’s heart and a leopard’s guts to attack our Lich Kingdom!”

A lich powerhouse’s expression changed when he heard this and he growled sternly.

Just a moment ago, they had said that the dragon palace was just so-so and they did not take it seriously at all.

But now, they found out that the other party had destroyed their scorpion imperial city. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Face slapping, this was a blatant face slapping.

“It’s indeed that Dragon King. Damn it, let’s go over immediately and destroy that Dragon King!”

The Lich expert confirmed. His gaze swept over the surrounding crowd as he roared with a face full of killing intent.

“Dragon Palace, they are courting death. If it really is that Dragon King, this king will destroy that Dragon Palace.”

The Lich King roared with a face full of rage.

The loss of a main city was a huge loss to the lich kingdom.

Within Scorpion Emperor City, there was a universe knight level 8 fighter.

There were over 10 universe Knights Level 7 and 10 universe knights level 6.

If all of them were killed by Dragon Emperor, then their gains this time might not be as great as their losses.

After all, to nurture a universe Knight Level 8 great being, they needed not only resources, but also opportunities.

“The teleportation formation leading to Scorpion Emperor City has been destroyed, and the teleportation formation within Scorpion Emperor Grotto-heaven has also been destroyed. We can only rush over from Chou Ling City.”

Very soon, a great being from the Lich Kingdom reported to them with a gloomy expression.

Hearing this news, they were all burning with anger.

“Let’s go, let’s go.”

A strong murderous aura emanated from the body of the Lich King, and he immediately flew into the teleportation formation.

The destruction of a main city had also caused great losses to the Lich Kingdom.

At the same time, Wang Xian was still in the Scorpion Emperor’s cave when the group of experts from the Lich Kingdom rushed over.

After he had killed a group of experts, the rest of the liches in the entire city began to kill very quickly.

In just a few minutes, he had destroyed more than half of the city.

After sensing that there were no more liches in the city, he did not continue to destroy the city. Instead, he came to this blessed land.

Hovering above the poisonous pool, Wang Xian sized it up curiously.

This was the first time he had seen such a unique blessed land.

“The poison in this poisonous pool is enough to poison a level eight universe knight to death. Put it away and let Ba Qi and the others make it into an offensive weapon.”

Wang Xian mumbled. With a wave of his arm, a large amount of poison entered the mother nest and was put away by him.

“Eh?”

The amount of poison in the pool was neither too much nor too little. It was about tens of thousands of tons.

After he had taken away all the poison, there were black rocks inside.

These black rocks had many small holes. The poison was seeping out from these small holes.

“It’s a pity that most of the grotto-heavens and blessed lands in the heaven-opening and primal continent can not be taken away. They are connected to the continent. I can take away the venom, but I can’t take away this blessed land.”

Wang Xian shook his head.

“I can’t stay here any longer. I have to leave.”

Looking at the time, he didn’t dare to stay any longer.

If all the experts from the Lich Kingdom rushed over, Wang Xian wouldn’t be their match.

“If I destroy a city, I can prepare to destroy the next one. HMPH, unless there are three to four universe knight level eight experts guarding a city, I can destroy it.”

Wang Xian’s eyes were cold as he flew out of the Scorpion Emperor Grotto-heaven.

He looked at the map around him and flew in one direction.

He did not go to the nearest city because the teleportation formation of this city had been destroyed by him. If the experts from the Lich Kingdom wanted to rush over quickly, they would be teleported to the nearest city.

Furthermore, Wang Xian was not in a hurry. After destroying a city, he could take a stroll around this continent.

Take a tour of this heaven-splitting primordial land!
