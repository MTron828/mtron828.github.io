“I’ll cultivate here for a period of time First! ”

Wang Xian stood in the Void Pagoda and felt the energy in the body of the Void

Dragon. He made a slight decision in his heart!

This body of the Void Dragon was different from his original body.

Due to its uniqueness, the body was formed from the power of space. Therefore, the energy was somewhat incompatible with the nine attributes in his body.

Unlike the other nine attributes in his body, metal, wood, water, fire, Earth, wind, lightning, and darkness could be converted.

The inability to convert resulted in the improvement of the space attribute. He could only cultivate it through himself.

Even if Wang Xian’s level increased again, the space attribute would remain unchanged!

Wang Xian would need to spend a lot of time to improve the power of space.

Now, Wang Xian had reached a bottleneck in obtaining the resources to improve. Therefore, he did not need to waste his time on other aspects.

On the contrary, he could properly cultivate the space power.

Having made up his mind, Wang Xian began to cultivate in the void pagoda.

There was sufficient space power in the Void Pagoda to allow him to improve tremendously.

Time passed by quickly. Tens of millions of years passed by quickly.

Buzz

Wang Xian stood up and felt the power in his body. He frowned slightly.

Over ten million years of time had only allowed him to reach the level of the Eternal Divine Lord. This speed was too slow for Wang Xian!

He had never cultivated so slowly before.

One must know that in the past, Wang Xian had cultivated to the peak of the supremacy level in over ten million years.

“He couldn’t make a breakthrough directly by devouring treasures.

Furthermore, every breakthrough in the space attribute was a little difficult. That was why he took more than 10 million years to break through to the current stage. ”

Wang Xian spoke.

There was another reason, and that was that Wang Xian didn’t have a cultivation method for the space attribute.

He had to rely on himself to explore and comprehend.

This was similar to a mortal who possessed the ability to absorb the power of space. However, he didn ‘t know anything else and only knew to bite the bullet and absorb it.

When one encountered a bottleneck, one had to comprehend and figure out the direction on their own.

It was fortunate that Wang Xian’s current realm was relatively high. He was able to find the direction and achieve a rapid breakthrough.

If it was a mortal, he might still be trapped in the realm of a god for more than 10 million years.

This was the reason why there was no cultivation method.

In the universe, the experts on many planets had lived for more than 10 million years. They weren’t even able to cultivate to the level of an eternal God Lord.

This was the effect of the cultivation method.

As for an lie, due to his special characteristics, he didn’t have many uses for space.

What he was best at now was sneak attacks and instant kills!

He really didn’t have any powerful means.

Therefore, he couldn’t teach Wang Xian this.

“Looks like I have to think of another way! ”

Wang Xian thought to himself. If he could raise the power of space to the level of a ruler at level five or six, then Wang Xian’s strength would be even more terrifying!

Should I go to the Sword and Magic Universe

Wang Xian had a thought and an idea appeared in his mind.

The Sword and Magic Universe had a passageway in the treasure vault of the Divine Dragon Clan. One could enter it directly.

Entering an unfamiliar universe was both a crisis and an opportunity.

However, an opportunity was greater than a crisis!

Especially when Wang Xian had the heaven’s origin jade horn.

Without the existence of the Heaven’s origin destiny to personally spy on Wang Xian, there was no way to discover his secret.

One would think that he was an expert from the sword and Magic Universe.

With Wang Xian’s current combat strength, it was easy for him to enter and search for opportunities.

The only thing that could suppress him was the Heaven ‘s origin destiny.

As for the rest, it was nothing!

The Sword and Magic Universe possessed the spatial attribute. Therefore, one could enter and search for the cultivation method of the spatial attribute!

Even if one cultivated in seclusion here for 100 million years, they would not be able to reach the realm of a universe knight!

After making up his mind, Wang Xian immediately made preparations.

He stepped into a new universe!

At present, the starry universe had settled down. On the side of the nine-origin universe, the Phoenix clan and the Angel clan could only be helpless and furious!

The Dragon Palace was developing steadily at a terrifying speed!

In addition, Lan Qingyue and the rest had already broken through. The strength of a ruler in the eighth level was enough to solve most of the problems.

Wang Xian asked an lie to bring him to the Dragon Palace.

In the following period of time, he played and rested with the group of Dragon Queens for a hundred years. After that, they came to the treasure vault of the Divine Dragon Clan!

“The universe of Swords and Magic! ”

Wang Xian stood under the vortex and sized it up with a twinkle in his eyes.

This was an unfamiliar universe. Wang Xian had no idea what would happen if he entered it!

He looked at an lie who was at the side and nodded at him.

Following that, Wang Xian and an lie entered the vortex directly!

Buzz

When Wang Xian stepped into the Vortex, the jade horn on his head emitted a luster and enveloped his entire body!

Following that, an unfamiliar aura surged over.

It was unfamiliar because he was unfamiliar with this world.

Wang Xian was not unfamiliar with the energy here.

The energy was almost similar to the nine-origin universe. Metal, wood, water, fire, Earth, wind, lightning, light, darkness, and space attributes!

Other than this, there were some other energies.

Under the sensing of Wang Xian ‘s powerful energy, this energy was somewhat sharp and sharp. It was very peculiar.

Every universe had its own characteristics.

It was the same in the starry universe, as well as the sword and Magic Universe!

Buzz

The scene around him changed drastically. The scene in front of him changed drastically. A desolate desert that stretched as far as the eye could see appeared in his line of sight.

At the same time, his mind stirred. A special memory appeared in his mind. This memory was like a coordinate.

This coordinate was the position he occupied when he came out. He looked behind him, which was the position he came out from.

“This is the chaotic space of nothingness!”

Wang Xian looked behind him. The position behind him was the same as the edge of the nine-origin universe in the starry universe!

There was no energy, no life, and nothing in the chaotic space!

Once one entered, even a powerhouse at the peak of the ruler realm would not live for long!

This was the end of a universe!

According to the information left behind by the Divine Dragon Clan, there was no starry sky in this sword and magical universe.

The sky was round and the Earth was square.

It was a vast and incomparably vast continent, an immeasurable and endless land!

The end was the end of this chaotic universe!

“The universe is really magical. It’s hard to imagine how deep the land under my feet is. ”

Wang Xian mumbled as he looked forward again.

“Dragon King, the spatial energy in this universe is a thousand times more than that of our nine-origin universe. It’s too dense!”

From the side, an Lie’s eyes lit up as he surveyed his surroundings. “The density of the spatial energy here is only slightly less than that of the Void Universe! ”

An lie could teleport to the location of the demonic spirit altar. In an Lie’s mind, there were many coordinates of the demonic spirit altar.

He had once been to an unfamiliar place.. Now, he could confirm that it was the void universe!
