Chapter 2970: , under the starry sky

“Dragon King, we’ve stopped them!”

The battle continued. The leaders of the demonic beasts panicked when they saw the second leader being killed.

They started to go berserk and fight with their lives on the line.

The ten experts of the Dragon Palace could only fight against a rank five demonic beast leader, but it was too difficult to stop them from escaping.

“If they want to escape, let them escape. I want to see where they can escape to!”

Wang Xian said coldly.

The Five Elements Millstone and the ten powerhouses from the Dragon Palace restrained one demon. He restrained one celestial thearch demon alone while the other thirty powerhouses from the Dragon Palace restrained one.

Only one of them escaped.

If it wanted to escape, let it escape. The Heaven Formation would be able to lock onto it very soon.

“Kill, kill these three as soon as possible!”

Wang Xian growled and unleashed a series of violent attacks at the leader of the demonic beasts in front of him.

The 30 powerhouses from the Dragon Palace attacked the leader of the demonic beasts with streams of energy.

The continuous stream of energy left the leader of the demonic beasts with no choice but to defend itself.

“Dragon King, that demonic beast is flying towards the demon lair.”

At this moment, the sky array reminded Wang Xian.

“An lie, go to the demon lair and absorb the energy from the altar inside!”

In order to prevent the demonic beast from escaping through the altar, Wang Xian immediately instructed an lie.

“It’s the Dragon King. Leave it to me!”

An Lie’s voice rang out and his figure disappeared.

“Increase Your Speed and kill this guy!”

From the side, the roars of AO Qitian and the rest could be heard. Thirty members of the Dragon Palace with the combat strength of a celestial thearch at level four were bombarding the leader of the demonic beast with terrifying energy.

Wang Xian pushed his speed to the limit and suppressed the leader’s continuous attacks.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

A minute later, the leader of the demonic beasts who had charged into the demon lair suddenly let out an unwilling roar. It spread its huge black wings and waved its claws as it continuously attacked an lie who was in front of it.

“Hahaha, I have already broken through to level three celestial thearch. Little Demonic Beast, if you can even touch me, I will lose!”

An lie looked at the leader’s attack and easily dodged it.

The leader of the demon went completely berserk, but it could not even touch an lie.

Teleporting was too heaven-defying.

“Good, good!”

Wang Xian laughed out loud when he saw an lie restraining the leader of the demon.

Boom, Boom, Boom

The divine dragon swung its tail and swept its tail. Continuous attacks landed on the body of the leader of the demon.

“Slash!”

Wang Xian shouted angrily as his huge dragon claws tore at the leader of the Demonic Beasts.

“Roar! Roar!”

The third leader of the Demonic Beasts was dead!

There were only three left!

The remaining three were even simpler.

“Die!”

Wang Xian moved his body and attacked the leader of the demonic beasts who was secretly enraged.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

When the leader of the demonic beasts saw that Wang Xian was charging at it, a look of fear appeared on its face. It ignored the furious Dark Blaze and fled into the distance.

However, his speed was far inferior to Wang Xian’s.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

Soon, the violent battle continued.

The other two demonic beasts, one of them was being attacked by the 20 level 4 divine emperor members of the Dragon Palace and the five elements grinding mill. The other one was being attacked by 30 divine emperor demonic beasts. The situation was completely on the side of the Dragon Palace.

Below, an lie had joined the battle once again. He had just leveled up and was already able to threaten a Level 4 divine emperor demonic beast.

Along with the fact that the Dragon Palace didn’t have anyone weaker than an undying god King Level 8, Yao Xie was being hunted down at a terrifying speed. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Every second, millions of Yao Xie were killed.

However, the members of the Dragon Palace rarely died.

The Dolphins at the back watched the entire battlefield. The moment a member of the Dragon Palace was injured, they would immediately use their life force liquid to help.

The entire void was filled with the roars and screams of the evil demons.

Time passed by minute by minute. The evil demons were being eliminated at a terrifying speed.

Five minutes later, another leader of the evil demons was eliminated by Wang Xian.

In the next five minutes, the other two leaders of the evil demons were also killed.

At this point, the six level five celestial thearch evil demons were all killed.

When Wang Xian and the rest killed the group of demonic leaders, the war below would be over soon.

“Kill them all!”

Wang Xian said to the level four celestial thearch combat strength members of the Dragon Palace.

“Yes!”

When they flew over, the killing speed was increased by ten times.

“Killing these demonic leaders can be considered as sweeping across the entire resplendent starry sky!”

Wang Xian was floating in the void. Seeing that all the demonic beasts were about to be eliminated, a smile appeared on his face.

Although no one knew about this battle in the chimei territory.

“After this, I can have a good rest!”

A smile appeared on his face.

“Dragon King, I want a demon cave to forge a war machine with the Fire Hammer clan.”

The Heaven Array flew over and said to Wang Xian with a smile.

“Yes. This time, there are six level five demon corpses of celestial thearch. After you upgrade, you can forge this war machine. If you need anything, just ask Prime Minister Gui for it!”

Wang Xian said to him.

“It’s the Dragon King. I promise to forge a powerful and Invincible War Machine!”

Sky Array’s eyes were filled with excitement.

Sky array was a fanatical wizard. He loved setting up arrays and forging special weapons.

Now that he could gather the resources of the entire starry sky to forge a war machine, he was filled with fighting spirit.

“Dragon King, settle them all!”

Ten minutes later, Prime Minister Gui flew over and reported with a smile, “This time, our Dragon Palace has obtained a lot of resources!”

“Let’s settle down properly. I’ll leave this place to you. Also, send an lie to search the chimei domain to see if there are any treasures!”

Wang Xian said with a smile.

“It’s the Dragon King. Leave this place to us!”

Prime Minister Gui nodded his head.

Wang Xian moved his body and disappeared in an instant.

He didn’t need to deal with this place anymore.

The improvement of the members of the Dragon Palace, the creation of war machines, and the handling of the war should be left to the other members of the Dragon Palace.

He could finally have a good holiday!

Upon returning to the Dragon Palace, Wang Xian immediately contacted the girls and gathered with them to enjoy the scenery.

As for the Dragon Palace, they collected all the evil demon corpses. Apart from leaving a demon cave, the rest of the demon caves were devoured by the devouring dragon.

This time, the devouring dragon’s strength would receive another huge upgrade.

Following that, all the members of the Dragon Palace began to digest the resources of the evil demon.

After the heaven array and Duan Jinming had improved, they immediately began to build war machines.

The Demon Cave of a rank five divine emperor was the size of two ordinary planets, so it would take a lot of effort to modify it.

There weren’t many years where it wouldn’t succeed.

The battle in the Chimei territory ended without anyone knowing. The current strength of the Dragon Palace was also unknown.

Perhaps the resplendent starry sky now believed that the Dragon Palace had 50 to 100 divine emperors.

The Strongest Dragon King had the combat strength of a rank four divine emperor.

He was at least at the peak of a rank three divine emperor.
