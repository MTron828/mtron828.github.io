Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

First-grade Restaurant is on fire!

Longxuan Restaurant has caught fire!

First-grade Restaurant’s reputation had spread throughout the whole country.

As for Longxuan Restaurant, it was burned to ashes!

On the night of the fire, someone reported it. After the fire was put out, the insides of Longxuan Restaurant were blackened and charred. Everything had been destroyed in the fire.

“Boss, we are famous! We are famous!”

The next morning, just as Wang Xian and Guan Shuqing arrived at First-grade Restaurant, Manager Huang exclaimed in excitement. He passed the newspaper over and continued, “Boss, take a look! This is the morning paper of Rivertown. Our First-grade Restaurant is now known throughout the town! Moreover, Longxuan Restaurant is completely finished after they caught fire last night. They are unlikely to reopen in the future.”

Wang Xian smiled. “We might be getting a little busier for the next few days and will have to trouble Manager Huang to supervise the situation.”

“Not a problem, not a problem.” Manager Huang smiled as he shook his head.

Wang Xian nodded his head and went into the office. With nothing to do, he switched on his computer and started playing.

As a boss, he could do as he wished. Now that First-grade Restaurant had started off well, he could just come over to play games.

Eh? First-grade Restaurant is in the headlines!

Wang Xian clicked on a news article and had a radiant smile as he read about the introduction of First-grade Restaurant.

The article was titled, “Although I Was Surprised, I’m Not Exaggerating”

When Wang Xian looked through the contents of that article, he smiled. After which, he continued browsing the Internet and saw several news articles reporting about them. Among them, there were also articles from large media houses.

One of the news articles was about Lin Qingying and First-grade Restaurant.

In that article, it was mentioned that Lin Qingying came to First-grade Restaurant for a meal. She tried to use her fame and reputation of a food blogger to ask the boss to arrange a table for her. However, she was asked to wait by the boss directly. Even stars wouldn’t receive special treatment.

There were lots of comments under the news article. Among which, the most popular one was:

“First-grade Restaurant is incredible!”

In a food magazine, First-grade Restaurant was promoted as the most incredible, most extravagant and most luxurious restaurant.

The three “most’s” clearly showed the strength of First-grade Restaurant.

Within a single day, First-grade Restaurant was known throughout the country. There were even many customers from other cities who wished to head to First-grade Restaurant to try out their food and take a look at the most incredible restaurant in the country.

Amongst the media reports from Rivertown, there was also an assessment of the showdown between Longxuan Restaurant and First-grade Restaurant.

The gist of the content was that First-grade Restaurant completely ran over Longxuan Restaurant.

There were even videos of Lin Qingying being rejected directly by the boss circulating on the Internet.

Longxuan Restaurant was utterly defeated.

Together with that fire at night, one could only pity Longxuan Restaurant.

For the following days, the business of First-grade Restaurant exploded. People who came here for meals weren’t just from Rivertown. Tourists in Rivertown would all come to First-grade Restaurant to try the food as long as they had the economic capacity to do so.

Besides that, through some connections of Old Qin, First-grade Restaurant was placed in the introduction of Rivertown’s tourist spots. Currently, First-grade Restaurant was classified as a “must-go” restaurant for anyone who came to Rivertown.

With the local authority’s publicity, coupled with the reputation of First-grade Restaurant, First-grade Restaurant had a full house each day. Its sales had also doubled from before.

Two-headed abalone, Atlantic Bluefin Marlin, Wild Giant Yellow Croaker fish and Chinese Bahaba fish were all sold out.

“Xiao Xian, these are the sales figures over the last few days. I have also calculated the profits. Do take a look.”

On the fourth day, Guan Shuqing brought over the sales report to Wang Xian.

Wang Xian took a look at it after receiving them from Guan Shuqing.

First day sales: $770,000

Second day sales: $830,000

Third day sales: $970,000

Fourth day sales: $102,000

When Wang Xian saw these figures, excitement flashed in his eyes. These figures were really high and were several times as compared to before.

However, from a different perspective, they weren’t that high either. This was because they were achieved in a discounted period.

Sales were $770,000 with 50% discount on the first day. Without discounts, it would be $1.54million.

There were also 40% discounts on the second day, 30% discounts on the third day and 20% discounts on the fourth day.

On the fourth day, sales had broken through the million-dollar mark. Moreover, with the current popularity of First-grade Restaurant, the sales figures of $1 million a day would likely last for some time.

It was especially so during the festive days when sales might be even higher.

If he was lucky to have a customer order 3 two-headed abalone in a day, that would be over $1 million. Moreover, these abalones, lobsters, Atlantic Bluefin Marlin and other variety of fish were all caught from the sea. There were no costs associated with them.

Excluding the costs, I have earned approximately $2.5 million in four days!

Wang Xian’s lips curved into a smile. Although he was giving generous discounts over the last few days, he wasn’t too concerned as there was no cost associated with the world-class ingredients.

Based on this pace, he could earn more than $10 million in a month. Naturally, this had to be based on having a steady supply of world-class ingredients.

Wang Xian’s mind was thinking quickly and a smile appeared gradually. The issue with the supply of ingredients could be left to Roving Girl. With Roving Girl’s current strength, catching some world-class seafood shouldn’t be a problem at all.

Bzz, bzz, bzz!

At this moment, Wang Xian’s phone rang suddenly. He took it up, took a look and a radiant smile appeared on his face.

“Xiao Yu.”

“Brother. I’ll be going to the University of Rivertown with Xiao Mi and some other friends who got in too. At that time, come and fetch me.”

From the phone, the voice of his sister, Xiao Yu, sounded.

“What time are you arriving tomorrow?” Wang Xian asked.

Unknowingly, the semester of the university was about to start and his sister, Xiao Yu, would also be going to the same school as him.

“We will be reaching Rivertown High-speed Rail Station tomorrow at 10am. At that time, you have to bring us around!”

“Relax! I, your brother, guarantee to be there on time!”

As he hung up the phone with a face of smiles, Wang Xian looked at today’s date.

The first-year students of the University of Rivertown had three days to report to the school. This was to ensure that students who were from a more distant place would have ample time.

Xiao Yu and her friends were a little early and would be arriving a day in advance.

There would also be a few other high school students who made it into the University of Rivertown. To be precise, there were eight of them.

“Xiao Xian, your sister will be arriving tomorrow?” Guan Shuqing overheard his phone conversation and asked inquisitively.

“Yeah.” Wang Xian nodded his head. “For the following two days, I’ll be bringing my sister around to have some fun. Therefore, I won’t have time to come to the restaurant.”

“In that case, have a good time with Xiao Yu over the next two days. There’re still three days to the official start of school after all,” replied Guan Shuqing.

“Yeah.”

Wang Xian nodded his head and sank into his thoughts. He was thinking of giving her a huge surprise this time.

The next morning, after finishing his breakfast, Wang Xian arrived at the High-speed Rail Station to wait for the arrival of his sisters.

At 10 am, a group of young guys and girls walked out from the High-speed rail station.

There were eight of them, three girls and five boys.

One of the girls was around 1.6 meters in height. She wasn’t very tall and was slightly slim. However, she had an exquisite face.

She did not have any makeup on, looked very quiet and gave others the feeling of a “girl next door.”
