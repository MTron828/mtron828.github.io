Chapter 765: 0766 Tang Yinxuan’s pursuer (1/5)

Translator: 549690339

Ring, Ring, Ring, ring

One after another, sounds were heard. This special sound could be heard within a radius of ten kilometers.

Wang Xian didn’t know what talent Tang Yinxuan had obtained from the Dolphins, but this special sound wave was extraordinary.

His eyes were flashing with red and blue light as he looked at the surrounding seabed.

With his current eyesight, he could penetrate a distance of dozens of kilometers without the obstruction of powerful energy.

As his gaze swept across the area, he could see clearly for dozens of kilometers.

“Eh? It’s here. It’s really here?”

At this moment, a hint of surprise flashed across Wang Xian’s eyes. In his vision, a palm-sized earth star fish was swimming over.

“One, two, three!” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Wang Xian scanned his surroundings and looked at the Earthstar fish one by one. This was simply robbing money!

“Eh? Someone is following us!”

Suddenly, Wang Xian frowned slightly and looked at the dozen or so people following behind an earthstar fish.

“There are three of them. I can sense them!”

Tang Yinxuan revealed a happy expression on her face.

“Yes, they are here!”

The speed of the Earthstar fish was very fast. In less than ten seconds, they had already appeared a hundred meters in front of them.

Wang Xian waved his arm and the seawater immediately wrapped around the earthstar fish and held it in his hand.

“That’s Great!”

Tang Yinxuan revealed a smile on her face and the sound of the zither stopped.

“Whoosh, Whoosh, Whoosh!”

At this moment, more than ten human figures emerged from the bottom of the sea.

A group of middle-aged young men looked at Wang Xian. When they saw the three earth star fish in his hands, they were slightly stunned.

“Miss Tang!”

However, very soon, a young man standing in the middle greeted Tang Yinxuan who was standing at the side with some pleasant surprise.

“Yes!”

Tang Yinxuan’s gaze swept across the crowd. She frowned slightly and nodded her head slowly.

“Our young clan leader has been searching for Miss Tang Yinxuan with great difficulty. I didn’t expect Miss Tang to be here!”

The other young men exchanged glances and said to Tang Yinxuan with a smile.

“I have something to do here. I hope I won’t be disturbed!”

Tang Yinxuan said with an indifferent expression.

“Oh?”

The group of young men looked at Tang Yinxuan. Their eyes swept past Wang Xian and narrowed slightly.

“Since that’s the case, we shall not disturb you anymore!”

As the group of young men spoke, their eyes flickered as they flew to the side.

Tang Yinxuan frowned and looked at Wang Xian. “Wang Xian, I will attract the attention of others by using sound waves to attract the earth star fish!”

“It’s fine!”

Wang Xian shook his head and looked at the group of young men who had left. “Do you know them?”

“They are from the Thunder clan. My family is relatively close to Ji Ding’s world. After Ji Ding appeared, the Thunder clan sought out my father for the development of the real world. Now that my father has joined the Thunder clan, he is helping to manage some businesses in the real world!”

Tang Yinxuan explained to Wang Xian, “The young leader of the Thunder clan has been pestering me for the past two days. He is a very annoying person!”

“Is that so? That’s because you’re too beautiful, Yinxuan!”

Wang Xian smiled. With Tang Yinxuan’s looks, she was not inferior to flower fairy at all. She was not inferior to the beauties of the immortal sect. It was very normal for her to be pursued.

“Then does our Dragon King also think that I’m Pretty?”

Tang Yinxuan suddenly asked Wang Xian. However, she seemed to be a little straightforward as she quickly continued, “Let’s continue!”

“Okay!”

Wang Xian smiled at Tang Yinxuan.

...

“Miss Tang is here. Let’s report to the young Clan Leader!”

“There’s actually a man beside him. I wonder what his relationship is with her!”

“No matter who that young man is, he is far from our young clan leader. Oh right, they caught three earthstar fish just now. It’s a little strange!”

“It’s very strange. We chased after that Earthstar Fish and actually took the initiative to run towards them. Oh right, there’s also a very strange sound!”

The dozen or so young men who had left stopped on the surface of the sea and looked behind them as they said in a slightly contemplative tone.

“First, tell the young clan leader about Tang Yinxuan’s situation here.”

“This Tang Yinxuan is really beautiful. She actually caught our young clan leader’s Eye!”

“This Tang Yinxuan isn’t simple either. She’s very strong and the people around her are also terrifying experts. If it weren’t for them, our young clan leader would have long made his move!”

“Eh, this voice is coming again. Let’s go and report to our young clan leader!”

The group of over a dozen people flew into the distance.

...

“It’s coming again. This time, there are more. It’s four!”

On the other side, Tang Yinxuan was playing the zither with a face full of joy as she spoke to Wang Xian.

“HMM, looks like we will be able to reap a lot!”

A smile appeared on Wang Xian’s face. “Yinxuan, your sound waves are really powerful!”

“Hehe!”

Tang Yinxuan smiled happily. However, she raised her eyebrows and said, “There are people following us from the bottom of the sea. They are flying towards us!”

“It’s alright. I will get the DRAKONIDS to block the people below who are trying to intercept the earthstar fish!”

Wang Xian shook his head nonchalantly.

Splash

Four Earthstar fish appeared. Wang Xian waved his arm and four water energy palms grabbed them.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

At this moment, two figures flew out from the water and saw Wang Xian holding four earthstar fish.

Their eyes lit up as they looked at Tang Yinxuan and Wang Xian.

“One of the terrestrial star fish is one that we have been chasing for a long time. Hehe, this handsome guy, can you return it to us?”

The two of them were girls. They were wearing sky-blue clothes that looked like fish scales. They looked very beautiful.

The two of them were about 30 years old. Their eyes were sparkling as they stared at the terrestrial star fish in Wang Xian’s hands.

“Sorry, we caught it!”

Wang Xian swept his gaze across the two of them and shook his head coldly.

“Don’t be so stingy. You’ve already caught four of them. If you don’t stop them, they belong to us!”

A girl walked forward slowly and said to Wang Xian.

“Get out of Here!”

Tang Yinxuan, who was at the side, placed her arm on the zither and waved it slightly. Instantly, a water wall was erected in front of the girl!

“Huh?”

The girl raised her eyebrows, and with a wave of her arm, she slapped towards the wall of water.

“Boom!”

However, Tang Yinxuan’s hand on the zither rippled slightly, and the girl’s body stiffened, and the wall of water crashed towards her.

The powerful force caused her body to retreat more than ten meters, and she was supported by another girl.

“You...”

The two’s expressions changed drastically.

“Leave this place!”

Tang Yinxuan looked at them and said calmly.

“This is our Fengyan Immortal sect’s territory!”

A hint of anger appeared on their faces, and they stared at Tang Yinxuan.

Tang Yinxuan looked at them coldly, and slowly placed her hand on the zither.

“You Little Girl, just you wait!”

The two’s expressions were somewhat awkward, and their chests heaved up and down as they glared at Tang Yinxuan. They looked at each other, and then left.
