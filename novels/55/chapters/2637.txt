“Kill!”

“Kill!”

In the Abyss, Wang Xian stared at the abyss seeds that were trying to break through. A cold expression appeared in his eyes!

Bei Shuang also shouted softly and followed closely behind Wang Xian. The Frost froze the void and greatly restricted the speed of the three immortal king level eight abyss seeds!

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

On the arrow platform, Mu Zesen stood in the distance. Arrows were shot at the three level eight abyss seeds! RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

On the surface, Wang Xian and the rest were fighting against the three abyssal seeds together with the brambles that were formed by the formation. The three abyssal seeds that were already suppressed by the three brambles instantly had wounds on their bodies!

The following battle was rather easy. Under the continuous attacks of Ao Yao who was hiding in the void, the three immortal king level eight abyssal seeds did not have much strength to resist!

One by one, the abyssal seeds fell. In less than five minutes, the last three level eight abyssal seeds died at the hands of Wang Xian and the rest!

“They’re really all destroyed!”

“Everyone from the Dragon Palace is really strong. Let’s tie down these three abyssal seeds. Dragon King, Come and kill these beasts!”

At the side, the four level eight powerhouses from the Dragon Python group went from shock at the beginning to shock at the end, and then to numbness. Seeing the five immortal king level eight abyssal seeds all killed, they could not help but look excited!

The five level 8 abyss seeds were all killed by the Dragon Palace. Didn’t the three of them have it easy?

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded. Without any hesitation, he flew directly to the position of the chairman of the Dragon Python Group!

Next, they would surround and kill the last three level 8 immortal King Level Abyss seeds!

As for the upcoming battle, there was no suspense at all!

Two minutes, in just two minutes, the last three undying level 8 abyss seeds were killed!

“Hahahaha!”

Seeing the corpses of the Undying Level 8 abyss seeds, the Dragon Python Group chairman and the rest couldn’t help but laugh maniacally!

Their laughter was a little crazy!

They originally thought that they would suffer heavy losses this time, and some of them might even be heavily injured or even fall. They had only tried to call for help, never expecting the warriors of the Dragon Palace to rush over!

What was even more unexpected was that the strength of the Dragon Palace was actually so terrifying!

The Eight Immortal King Abyss seeds were all killed under the attacks of the powerhouses from the Dragon Palace!

A great victory!

“Thank you, Dragon Palace, for your help. Thank you, Dragon King, for your help!”

The four chairmen of the Dragon Python group flew to the front of Wang Xian and the rest. They cupped their hands and bowed to express their gratitude!

“You’re welcome!”

Wang Xian nodded his head faintly!

“Dragon King, I can’t thank you enough. The Dragon Palace’s action this time has reduced our losses by a lot. The Dragon Python group is willing to give 10% of our shares to the Dragon Palace!”

“Also, if the Dragon Palace needs anything in the future, the Dragon Python group will definitely not decline!”

The four divine king level eight powerhouses of the Dragon Python group looked at each other and spoke to Wang Xian once again!

The Dragon Python group had promised to give away shares with the help of powerful individuals!

10% of the shares was definitely a terrifying asset to the entire dragon Python group!

The four of them only had 10% of the shares!

The reason why they were willing to give 10% of the shares to the Dragon King and the Dragon Palace was mainly due to the strength of the Dragon Palace!

Five level 8 abyss seeds could be easily killed, this level of power was definitely enough to fight against 10 undying level 8 abyss seeds!

Most importantly, this might not be the full power of the Dragon Palace!

At this time, the Demon Island had encountered the most serious disaster in trillions of years, at this time, if they could rope in such a powerful force like the Dragon Palace, it would be a huge benefit to the survival of the Dragon Python group!

Pulling the Dragon Palace on the same Front was the best choice!

“Sure!”

Wang Xian nodded his head lightly when he heard their words!

There was nothing to reject an unexpected fortune!

A tenth of the shares of a group like the Dragon Python group, if converted into resources, would at least allow the dragon palace to increase the combat strength of a few immortal King Level 8 powerhouses!

As for the other thoughts of the Dragon Python group, he didn’t have to consider them at all!

They were also mutually beneficial, after all the Dragon Palace came here to hunt the abyss seed!

“Alright, Alright, all the members of the Dragon Python Group Remember, the Dragon Palace’s help today will reduce our losses by too much. In the future, the Dragon Palace Dragon King will hold 10% of the shares of the Dragon Python group, and the Dragon King will be one of the major shareholders of the Dragon Python Group!”

“In the future, the Dragon King will be able to mobilize all the members of the Dragon Python group to meet the Dragon King as if they were meeting us!”

The chairman of the Dragon Python group immediately announced loudly!

“It’s the Chairman!”

“Yes!”

“Your Disciple’s orders!”

The group of disciples and experts immediately responded loudly when they heard the chairman’s words!

If the Dragon Palace had not come to help in this battle, at least half of the tens of millions of people here would have died here!

...

It was no exaggeration to say that the Dragon Palace was their benefactor!

Furthermore, they had witnessed the strength of the Dragon Palace just now. They were filled with gratitude and respect towards the Dragon King!

“Hehe, most of the abyssal seeds here have been killed. We shall not stay here any longer!”

Wang Xian smiled faintly and ordered the members of the Dragon Palace to put away the corpses of the abyssal seeds. Then, he cupped his hands toward the chairman of the Dragon Python group and the rest!

“Alright, the other planets are still fighting over there. We need to settle this as well. After this war, the Dragon Python group will definitely go over personally to thank the Dragon King and the Dragon Palace for their kindness!”

The chairman of the Dragon Python group cupped his hands and said with a smile!

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded and flew toward the commanding platform of Dragon Peak!

Bei Shuang and the rest immediately followed behind!

The surrounding areas were almost done when Wang Xian and the rest killed the eight level eight immortal king level abyssal seeds!

After all, there were 5,000 immortal king level powerhouses and more than 1,000 immortal king level divine weapons in Dragon Peak!

...

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian said to the sky array indifferently!

“Dragon King, we have reaped too much this time. Our strength might be able to improve further!”

Sky Array said to him excitedly!

Wang Xian nodded his head lightly. This time, there were 16 level 8 abyss seed corpses. Adding the rest of the corpses, they might be able to give two members of the Dragon Palace the strength of an immortal King Level 9!

As for the rest of the immortal king level abyss seed corpses, there were about 4,000 of them!

For those below the immortal king level, the dragon palace had probably harvested more than 10 million of them!

These were all at the level of the eternal godly monarch. The resources of these corpses could allow the combat strength of the Dragon Palace’s undying godly monarch to break through the sky!

At least 20,000 more undying godly monarchs could be added!

“HM, let’s go back. This battle is almost over!”

Wang Xian looked at the red dot on the array formation in front of the Heaven Array and said!

The heaven array nodded and immediately rode the dragon peak towards the planet of the Dragon Palace!
