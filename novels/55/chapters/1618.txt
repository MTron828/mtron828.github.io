Chapter 1619: 1619’s Super Forces

“As expected, the dragon and Phoenix Empire has made their move. Do they really think that we, the supreme sect, are easy to bully?”

“War, all the disciples of the supreme sect are ready for War? Gather all the information about the dragon and Phoenix Empire and Fight!”

“Contact the southern royal family. We have already formed an alliance with the southern royal family. Kill!”

When the supreme sect leader of the supreme sect learned that his disciples had been attacked, he roared furiously.

“It’s the supreme sect leader!”

“Kill! If they want to fight, then we’ll fight them!”

The soli sect was in an uproar, and everyone’s faces were filled with killing intent.

“From today onwards, the Soli sect and the dragon-phoenix Empire will fight to the death!”

“From today onwards, the southern royal family and the dragon-phoenix Empire will fight to the death!”

On the same day, the Soli sect announced the start of the battle.

In less than a few hours, the southern royal family also announced the start of the battle.

The two super powers declared war at the same time, causing the entire vast region to be in an uproar.

“My God, as expected, the lone cult and the southern royal family have joined forces. The battle is about to begin!”

“With the super powers joining forces, the entire vast region is about to become a battlefield!”

“According to rumors, the Dragon and Phoenix Empire has at least two rank 9 void interpretation experts, or even three. The lone cult and the southern royal family have no choice but to join forces!”

All the forces in the vast area revealed expressions of shock.

“They really have joined forces. Do they really think that we’re afraid of You?”

Feng Luan and Prime Minister Gui revealed cold expressions when they heard the declaration of the lone sect and the dragon-phoenix Empire.

“Announce that from today onwards, the dragon-phoenix Empire, the lone sect, and the southern royal family will fight to the death!”

The next day, Feng Luan’s words spread throughout the entire area.

They had come here to fight.

Who was afraid of a battle!

In the entire area, there were four super forces, and three of them had declared war.

The scope of the battle would definitely affect the entire area.

The declaration of war began, and so did the battle.

On the third day after the declaration of war, the Dragon Guards and the Heavenly Eye Arrow Division attacked again, killing over a hundred disciples of the southern royal family.

On the fifth day, the solipsistic sect laid an ambush and used bait to kill five dragon guards.

On the tenth day, the five hundred void interpretation experts of the dragon-phoenix Empire fought with the three hundred void interpretation experts of the southern royal family. They lost thirty void interpretation experts and killed more than two hundred and fifty of their opponents.

On the fifteenth day, the southern royal family sent people to secretly attack a city of the dragon-phoenix Empire. They killed a million people and left.

On the 20th day, a million people from a foreign race under the southern royal family were killed overnight!

In the first month, the area occupied by the southern royal family and the solipsistic sect in the god country ruins suffered a sneak attack and suffered heavy losses.

“Damn it, damn it! How did the dragon-phoenix Empire know our information so accurately? They have just arrived in the vast area. There must be a faction providing them with information!”

A month later, the war between the three super forces shook the entire vast region.

After a month of confrontation, the dragon-phoenix Empire was in a completely advantageous position.

In the southern royal family’s southern desolate plains, the southern royal family’s patriarch roared angrily.

“In our vast region, the most powerful forces with information are the Wuji Empire and the He clan. Both of them could have provided information to the dragon-phoenix Empire!”

The supreme headmaster also stood there with a gloomy expression.

In a month, each of them had lost five to six hundred experts at the profound void tier.

This was close to one-tenth of their strength!

“We can’t go on like this. Next, we’ll have to command some small factions to serve us. In addition, today, we’ll head to the Wu Ji Empire and ask them if they’ve provided information to the Dragon and Phoenix Empire!”

“As for the He clan, we’ll directly destroy them!”

The Patriarch of the southern royal family roared furiously.

“Let’s Go! We’ll set off immediately!”

The supreme headmaster nodded and immediately flew into the Wuji dynasty.

On the same day, the news of the supreme headmaster and the two patriarchs of the southern royal family going to the Wuji dynasty’s imperial palace spread throughout the vast region.

The He clan, who had received the news at the first moment, immediately recalled all their disciples and defended the holy tree.

The Supreme Hierarch and the two ancestors of the southern royal family left the Wuji Dynasty and flew directly to the He clan.

With the protection of the sacred tree, the He clan could withstand the attacks of three peerless experts.

Ten days later, a first-rate force, the dust gate, suddenly attacked the dragon and Phoenix dynasty. The two hundred dragon guards were caught unprepared and were killed.

“Ao Yao, mobilize all the members of the dragon Spike and kill all the forces that are close to the southern Royal Family of the Supreme Hierarch!”

Two hundred dragon guards were killed. Prime Minister Gui’s eyes turned red as he gave an order to Ao Yao.

The dust sect’s attack had completely implicated all the other forces.

In one night, the nine Lotus sect, which was close to the solitaire sect, was directly destroyed. The dust sect and the others escaped to the Solitaire sect and escaped a calamity.

However, the first-rate force, the Southern Garden Empire, was forced by the southern royal family to join the battle and fight against the Dragon and Phoenix Empire.

The appearance of the three first-rate forces caused the battle to spread to the entire region.

It was a huge battle, a fierce battle.

The first-rate forces were forced by the lone sect and the southern royal family to take action, and the second-rate forces wouldn’t be able to stay out of it.

Two months later, the He clan and the He Sui clan joined the Battle of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire!

The battle became even more fierce!

In the third month, the Wuji Empire declared that they would remain neutral in this war in the vast region.

After that, the Divine Light Empire declared that they would remain neutral.

Those second-rate and weak forces all joined the Wuji Empire, remaining neutral and seeking protection.

30% of the forces were close to the Wuji Empire and remained neutral.

30% of the forces were forced to join the solipsistic sect and the Wuji Empire.

Only twenty percent of the forces joined the Dragon and Phoenix Empire’s camp.

As for the other twenty percent of the forces, they had already been destroyed by Ao Yao and the dragon Spike members!

The bitter war lasted for eight months straight.

During these eight months, tens of millions of people were killed or injured.

Assassinations and attacks were being carried out every day.

However, the top-level battles did not erupt because, according to the estimates of the other forces in the vast region, the dragon and Phoenix Empire might have three insightful void tier 9 experts.

In a three-on-three situation, no one had a chance of winning.

Even the supreme sect master and the southern imperial family’s patriarch did not dare to act rashly.

“Reporting to the Phoenix Emperor, our medicinal pill shop and forging workshop have already been established in two hundred cities. We can officially open for business on the same day!”

Eight months later, the terrifying battle had already come to a stalemate. In the past half a month, no large-scale battle had broken out.

An expert from the dragon and Phoenix Empire came to the imperial palace and reported to Feng Luan.

“Okay!”

Feng Luan nodded and took the interspatial ring he handed over.

Inside were all the profits from the medicine shop and the forging workshop.

After eight months of intense battle, the Dragon and Phoenix Empire was able to reach a complete stalemate with the two super forces. Apart from the Dragon Palace, these resources accounted for a large portion!
