Chapter 419: Another Attack

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Ah!

As deafening screams came through, the painful cries caused hair to stand on end.

Back in the yard in the villa, Xiao Ran was sitting on the ground with his legs crossed. Above his head, the Body Refining Flame was burning over his body.

Even though the blazing flame was specifically used to refine the body, the pain was simply unbearable.

However, Wang Xian remained unwavering at the side. Each time when Xiao Ran’s physical body could not take it, Wang Xian would inject Energy of the Azure Dragon to heal his body.

When his skin tore, it would be treated with the Energy of the Azure Dragon again.

At the same time, Level 4 elixir pills were thrown into Xiao Ran’s mouth as though they cost nothing. The immense energy in the pills was quickly absorbed and refined.

Boom!

After he had taken all four Soul Enhancement Pills, an intense energy began to rise in Xiao Ran’s body. He lifted his head as he could not help but bellow with a shaken body.

“Open your mouth!” Wang Xian shouted at him as he curled his finger and sent three White Valley Lotus Seeds into his mouth.

White Valley Lotus could help to cleanse the physical body, shaping the most perfect Inborn Physique. Compared to Devil’s Skeletal Pill, the Spiritual Energy provided would be lesser, but it could strengthen the foundation.

As the Body Refining Flame from the Inferno Dragon Ball kept pouring down on him like a waterfall, Xiao Ran was completely covered by the sticky and thick magma.

With the help of Level 6 Spiritual Medicine White Valley Lotus and Level 11 Body Refining Flame, nothing would go wrong despite the fact that they took a shortcut.

“Absorb the energy and adapt to it. Lay a good foundation!” said Wang Xian to Xiao Ran indifferently as he observed by the side.

After half an hour, Wang Xian opened his mouth and took the Inferno Dragon Ball back.

Xiao Ran, who was glowing in a blue flame, slowly opened his eyes.

A tinge of sapphire radiance blinked in his eyes as Tranquil Blue Heavenly Flame rose from his body. Daunting destructive energy came from his body.

Xiao Ran slowly stood up.

Ka Ka Ka!

A bone-cracking sound came from within his body.

The Tranquil Blue Heavenly Flame slowly converged into his body with flashing bouts of queer aura.

It was the domineering and majestic stance of an Inborn Expert that was emanating from Xiao Ran’s body.

There was a tinge of thrill in his eyes as he turned to Wang Xian with passion and admiration. “Master, I...I actually advanced to Inborn Realm. Thank you, master!”

As he spoke, Xiao Ran went down on his knees with his eyes reddened. His body was shaking with excitement.

“Enough, don’t be so excited. Put on your clothes. We’re going to Shang Jing this afternoon!”

Wang Xian smiled at him.

“Yes, Master!”

Xiao Ran blushed as he hurriedly ran outside.

Wang Xian shook his head and went back to the villa. He was lying on the sofa, drinking his tea while reading the news on the Underworld.

The most popular event in the Underworld recently was none other than the Outstanding Young Heroes’ rankings.

The Underworld would rank the Outstanding Young Heroes bi-annually. As such, many of the supreme talents would rush over to the venue.

If they got ranked, they would receive many resources. If they could rank above the top three, they would have a chance to receive Level 4 to 5 elixir pills, Level 5 to 6 Spiritual Grass, and even powerful weapons.

Xiao Yu and Elder Fang had already returned to Thistles and Thorns Sect during the past few days. Xiao Yu was getting ready to surprise every young hero in the event. At the same time, she was preparing for Thistles and Thorns Sect to upgrade themselves to a first-class force.

Wang Xian did not interrupt her enthusiasm. Given Elder Fang and her strength, almost no one in the entire Underworld could hurt them.

Even if they met a Dan Realm Expert, they were able to go up against them once they transformed into a Skeletal Dragon.

After a rest, Xiao Ran put on his training attire and walked over with a sharp sword in his hand.

“Master!”

“You’re ready? Let’s go. We’ll pick up your sister first!”

As Wang Xian spoke, he stretched his back and spotted the Ancient Spiritual Sword at the side. With a casual movement, the sword was tossed to Xiao Ran.

“Your last gift!”

Wang Xian tossed the Inborn Spiritual Weapon, the Ancient Spiritual Sword, to Xiao Ran as he spoke.

They picked up this Ancient Spiritual Sword when they annihilated Nine Lotus Sect back at the Ancient Tomb. It was initially gifted to Xiao Yu.

But ever since Xiao Yu had turned into a Skeletal Dragon, she has no use for this Ancient Spiritual Sword. The Inborn Spiritual Weapon was no better than the bone sword extended out from her hand. As a result, the sword was left lying around in the villa.

“Thank you, master!”

Xiao Ran took the Ancient Spiritual Sword with thrills. He was looking ebullient.

“Let’s go!” Wang Xian said to him. Both of them took a cab to the old street.

After meeting up with Liu Mengxin and Sun Lingxiu, four of them took a cab to the airport.

Liu Mengxin was an unofficial disciple of Sun Lingxiu. Since she practiced the Art of Light, her strength had reached Level 8 Martial Artist.

Given her age, it was rather daunting.

“Where are you flying to?” the driver asked them with a smile on his face.

“To Shang Jing!” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Shang Jing? Now it’s very crowded to go there since everyone is traveling there for a winter vacation!”

The driver chuckled as he spoke.

When the cab was making a turn, a large vehicle stopped in the middle of the road, causing the driver to slam on the brakes immediately.

“God dammit. What a son of a bitch! Do you know how to drive?”

“Hur?”

At this time, Wang Xian spotted the Martial Artists walking out from that car.

They were all armed with swords, looking over in their direction with icy gazes.

“Master, it’s them. They were the ones who assaulted me!”

Xiao Ran was getting aggressive as he pointed to the few middle-aged men and exclaimed loudly.

“Again?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrow and revealed a cold smile. Upon seeing the flustered driver, Wang Xian struck him unconscious with a palm.

“Let’s get down!”

Wang Xian sniggered as he spoke when he stepped out of the cab.

“Brat, where do you think you can hide?”

Xiao Shisan glared at Xiao Ran coldly as he smirked, revealing a bloodthirsty look.

“Half-step to Inborn?”

There were two old men, fat and skinny ones, standing beside Xiao Shisan. The fat old man squinted his eyes as he observed Xiao Ran in a half-asleep state. “Just a Half-step to Inborn Brat, and you want us to strike?”

“It’s safer to get rid of such a demon-like existence. Aunt Mei did the correct thing. We’re here to ensure this brat is utterly dead, just in case!” said the skinny old man beside the fat old man who had bulging eyes that were big and creepy-looking.

“People from the Xiao Clan? Hehe, we were about to look for you. Little did I expect you to be here beforehand!”

Wang Xian swept his gaze across fifteen of them. Among which, there were two Inborn Experts and five Half-step to Inborn Experts. He could not help but display a cold look.

“Who is he?” asked the fat old man who squinted his eyes.

“Who cares? Kill them all!”

The skinny old man stared with his round eyes as he spoke casually.

“That’s true. You guys go on. I want to see what that fifteen-year-old Half-step to Inborn can do!”

The fat old man nodded as he commanded the rest of the surrounding people.

“Yes!”

Thirteen Martial Artists held their weapons in their hands. Xiao Shisan took a look at his comrades and reminded them, “Be careful, this brat can release a powerful blue flame.”

“Haha, we’ve got so many of us here. It will be a piece of cake to kill a Half-step to Inborn brat!”
