“Brothers... brothers, should we, should we kill the rest of the abyss species?”

Within the Abyss, a race of over 800,000 abyss species, Poison 9 who was parasitic on an undying level 8 abyss species was lying around a few of them, his eyes wide as he scanned his surroundings, some were stunned as he said.

Around him, there were 5 undying level 8 abyss species and 1 undying level 9 abyss species.

These 6 were naturally his own people, the eight limousine fiend and the others.

Close to them, there were about 2,000 abyss species, these were also his own people, members of the Poison Department.

However, the 800,000 or so around him weren’t his own people.

These were real abyssal seeds.

At this moment, poison nine was a little flustered. He felt like he was a husky among wolves.

“Calm down, calm down. These are all our subordinates, obedient babies. When they help us find our next target, we’ll send them on their way.”

Octaqi lay there calmly. His huge head scanned the surroundings with a satisfied expression.

“Oh!”

Poison nine nodded.

“Little Nine, you have to grow up too. In a while, lead some abyss seeds to search the surroundings, find a target, we’ll continue.”

“Whether or not we can reach the pinnacle undying emperor realm will depend on our efforts this time.”

Mo Sha said to him.

“It’s the two big brothers, I know.”

Poison nine heavily nodded.

He could already predict that half a month later, the Dragon King would help him rise to undying god King Level 9, and as long as they gained more, he could even rise to peak undying god King combat strength.

This was a peak god King, a pinnacle existence below the resplendent world god Emperor.

After a few minutes, poison nine and the other poison department members led the abyssal seeds to scout the surroundings.

A few hours later, they found a target, so the more than 800,000 abyssal seeds were in trouble.

After killing them, they continued to hunt, using that wretched style to the extreme.

Time passed day by day, and the agreed time of half a month soon arrived.

“Kekekeke, the harvest this time is a qualitative improvement. Little Nine, contact the Dragon King.”

Half a month later, Ba Qi’s voice rang out.

“Alright, Big Brother Ba Qi.”

Poison nine nodded immediately and took out his communication stone plate to make contact.

At the same time, in an empty place in the abyss, Wang Xian took out his communication stone plate and looked at the information on it with a smile on his face.

He saw the location of poison nine and the rest and exited the abyss. He immediately flew toward the center of the Abyss.

When he was near the entrance of the Abyss, which was closer to the eight-limbed group, Wang Xian sent Ao Yao and the rest to check their surroundings.

After confirming their location, Wang Xian sent them a message.

Soon, Poison Nine and Mo Sha flew over.

“Greetings, Dragon King.”

When the two of them saw Wang Xian, they immediately greeted him respectfully.

“How’s The Harvest?”

Wang Xian asked.

“Dragon King, our harvest this time is huge. There are three immortal king level nine abyss seeds and 25 level eight abyss seeds.”

“The remaining 3,000 immortal king level and above, about 2 million ordinary ones.”

Mo Sha opened his mouth and said excitedly.

“Oh? So much harvest?”

Wang Xian revealed a surprised expression when he heard his words.

“It’s mainly because Big Brother Ba qi and Mo Sha are too powerful.”

Du Jiu couldn’t help but comment.

“Alright, exchange the immortal King Level Abyss seeds with the imperial court for pills.”

“Give me the rest of the ordinary abyss seeds’corpses. The Dragon Palace will be able to produce 8,000 poisonous horned dragons.”

Wang Xian smiled and said to them.

“It’s the Dragon King.”

Mo Sha and Du Jiu nodded and immediately flew towards the imperial court.

“It won’t be long before the strength of the poison manufacturing department will undergo an earth-shattering change.”

Wang Xian mumbled as his eyes sparkled.

This was the first time he had added five level eight immortal king abyssal seeds. This time, he could add 25 and three level nine immortal king abyssal seeds.

Such an increase speed was extremely terrifying.

Before long, the poison department would be the strongest among the departments of the Dragon Palace.

...

...

“Patriarch, according to the information we received, there is an abyss race here. If we kill them, we will be able to obtain many merits and exchange for treasures.”

At a location not far from Wang Xian, a group of 5,000 people flew over.

The two old men in the lead emitted a powerful aura. Their eyes were like torches. They were definitely not ordinary powerhouses.

“The battle this time is very intense. Two immortal King Level 9 powerhouses died last night.”

“All of you, be careful later.”

The old man in the lead reminded.

“It’s Patriarch.”

The rest of them nodded.

“Eh, Patriarch, look at that person in front, he seems to be...”

At this moment, an old man beside him suddenly pointed forward and growled in a low voice with an uncertain expression.

...

“Eh?”

The rest of them looked over and their faces immediately darkened.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

The eyes of the two old men in the lead shot out a terrifying killing intent.

It was the Dragon King!

The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace who forced them to flee from the Demon Island and their base.

Nearly 20,000 immortal godly monarchs of the world margin sect had fallen at the hands of the Dragon Palace.

The World Margin Sect’s cornerstone treasure, the world margin ruler, had also been snatched away by him.

The hatred between the world margin sect and the Dragon Palace was irreconcilable.

In an instant, waves of violent killing intent surged from the bodies of everyone from the world margin sect. Their gazes were fixed on the Wang Xian in front of them. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Patriarch, it’s just the five of them. Should we...”

An expert from the world margin sect suppressed the killing intent in his heart and growled in a low voice.

“Let’s go.”

“Even if we can’t kill him, we still want the Dragon King to flee.”

The two world margin patriarchs did not hesitate and flew straight ahead.

The reason why the world margin sect lost to the Dragon Palace last time was all because of the powerful dragon peak and the three thorny monsters.

This time, the Dragon Peak was not here. The Dragon King and the other five were in the Dragon Palace. Would they be afraid?

Even if they could not take revenge this time, they had to let the Dragon King know the consequences of offending them.

“Huh?”

When they flew over, Wang Xian, who was standing in front of the Abyss, had already sensed it.

When he saw the people from the world margin sect, he narrowed his eyes slightly.

“Dragon King!”

Ao Jian looked over and a cold expression appeared in his eyes.

He waved his arm and the horizon ruler instantly appeared under his feet.

Beside him, a dragon guard and a wild dragon immediately landed at the position that was controlled by the horizon ruler.

“HMM? It’s our horizon ruler.”

“Damn it, that’s our sect’s cornerstone treasure.”

At the opposite position, everyone from the horizon sect saw the horizon ruler under Wang Xian and the rest. Their faces were filled with anger.
