Chapter 136: Descent Of The King (1)

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

The Yan Family sat there like how a King would.

Every action or word from them was watched closely by the surrounding people.

No one could stop them.

And they wouldn’t be stopped!

Just like the return of the King! The return of the true ruler!

“Don’t push it!”

Seeing Yan Zhongyuan approaching him, his body was shivering slightly and fear started creeping on him.

Behind him, the other Duan Family members’ faces were as white as sheets as they stood there helplessly.

“What do you mean by pushing it? This is just like any other ordinary sparring. My nephew is a Martial Artist Level 9 expert and so is Hu Fei. We are both at Martial Artist Level 8!”

Yan Zhongyuan looked at Old Duan tauntingly before turning to Old Xue. “Oh right, where’s that brat, Wang Xian? Why isn’t he here?”

Old Xue’s heart sank and had a ghastly expression. He knew that his close relationship with Wang Xian on that day had completely angered the Yan Family.

“I gave him an invitation letter but it seems like he’s not here today.” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Yan Feng looked around with derision. “His medical skills are so great and he has the capital to be proud. I still thought he would appear. It seems like he has disappointed me.”

He shook his head gradually and looked a little disappointed. “However, I told him that if he wasn’t here, he’d better watch out for his family and friends.”

Yan Feng stared at Old Xue and smirked. “Those who offend our Yan Family will definitely deeply regret their actions!”

“Come, let’s spar!” Yan Zhongyuan looked to Old Xuan and said plainly.

Yan Feng waved his hand to signal for a Martial Artist Level 7 expert from Yan Family to step out. He then looked towards Old Xue in contempt.

“Alright. Who’s afraid of you!”

“Come!”

Old Duan’s face turned solemn. He clenched his fist tightly and walked to the middle of the field.

Old Xue was equally solemn as he faced that expert from the Yan Family.

The crowd held their breath and looked at Old Duan and Old Xue with pity.

They were currently the third and fourth strongest families in Rivertown! And were extremely strong existences in the entire Rivertown! However, in the face of the Yan Family, they couldn’t do anything but be manipulated by them.

They could already foresee the Duan Family and Xue Family being erased from Rivertown in the near future.

“Haha. Come, come!” Yan Zhongyuan laughed heartily before launching his attack.

This was originally a training field and there was ample space.

“Cripple him! Tell Wang Xian that this is just the beginning. If he dares to be a coward, I’ll let him experience a life worse than death!” Yan Feng said to the Martial Artist from the Yan Family.

“Yes, young master!” That middle-aged man nodded his head and stared harshly at Old Xue.

“Wang Xian? Tsk!”

Contempt filled the eyes of Yan Feng.

As one that was favored by the gods, he was spotted by an expert from the Sacred Seas of Swords and had trained under him since he was young. When he was 18 years old, he was brought to the Sacred Seas Island by his master.

He had always been under the dazzling limelight when growing up.

Soon, the Yan Family would become the King of the entire Rivertown. At that time, he would be the crown prince of Rivertown.

No one would dare to go against his words.

So what if that brat has some medical skills? Crushing him would be as simple as crushing an ant.

Yan Feng smirked and stared at Old Xue. He looked to the surrounding crowd and spread his domineering aura towards them.

On the training field, Yan Zhongyuan was engaged in an intense fight with Old Duan.

Old Xue and the middle-aged man were also fighting with all they had.

Nonetheless, it was clear that Old Duan and Old Xue were on the losing end.

Since the Yan Family had chosen them for the battles, they would definitely be confident about the outcome.

“It’s over. Old Xue and Old Duan are probably going to be defeated soon. Yan Zhongyuan and the other Martial Artist are ruthless with each strike!”

“The third and fourth strongest families are going to be crushed so easily? That’s horrifying!”

The crowd looked attentively at the battle of these four people and discussed softly.

Xue Jing, his father and the members of the Duan Family were all watching anxiously. Their faces were as white as sheets and their eyes were filled with despair.

Arghh!

Argh!

A piercing scream sounded and the crowd felt as if their hearts skipped a beat.

Yan Zhongyuan palm struck ruthlessly on the chest of Old Duan, causing it to sink in directly. It was an extremely brutal scene.

As for Old Xue, his four limbs were crippled and he lay on the floor motionless. Even his Elixer Field had been crushed.

A complete tragedy!

As the two old men fell, it also represented the complete destruction of the Xue Family and Duan Family.

Xue Jing and his father’s eyes were bloodshot and they stared at the members of the Yan Family with deep hatred.

The members of the Duan Family were shivering in anger and clenching their fists tightly.

However, they didn’t dare to retaliate.

“Undermatch! Who still dares to go against our Yan Family?”

At this moment, seeing that Old Duan and Old Xue were lying on the floor, Yan Gukong stood up slowly and shouted. He lifted the dragon head walking stick in his hand slowly.

“Who else!”

It was another angry roar. This roar was full of might, dominance and the aura of an expert.

When his dragon-head walking stick landed on the ground, a low and dull sound propagated together with an invisible airwave towards the crowd.

Instantly, everyone felt a faint sense of pressure!

“Half-step! Inborn!”

The leader of the Ren Family, who was seated in the front, instantly opened his eyes widely. His face was filled with horror.

This aura was definitely from someone who was at the half-step to Inborn realm.

He had not expected Yan Gukong of the Yan Family to make this step and achieve the realm of half-step to Inborn.

“Half-step to Inborn! Oh my gosh! He’s at the half-step to Inborn Realm!”

“Old Yan is a half-step to Inborn expert! I’ll surrender. I’ll surrender!”

The surrounding Martial Artist were all shocked.

“We are willing to defer to the Yan Family!”

“We are willing to follow the commands of the Yan Family from here onwards!”

The remaining Martial Artists, who had not made a stand previously, immediately bowed down.

A disciple of Sacred Seas of Swords and a half-step to Inborn expert. What a horrifying family! They might very well become a First-class family in the future!

The Martial Artists bowed down to show their will to submit!

On the training field, Old Xue looked at the horrifying Yan Family in despair.

Even if Wang Xian was here right now, there would be no other way out. It’s over!

“Haha, follow our Yan Family and you will bask in glory in the near future!”

Yan Gukong looked at the crowd and laughed heartily. He then added four words, “The King has returned!”

“Let’s give up!” The leader of the Ren Family felt helpless. He knew that the Yan Family couldn’t be stopped and they couldn’t oppose the Yan Family. What was left for them would be only to surrender.

Although he was unwilling, there was no other option for him!

Just as he was about to lower his body, a voice sounded suddenly.

“The invitation letter stated that the banquet would start at 8 pm. It’s 8 pm right now. It seems like someone has been impatient!”

It was unexpected and the surrounding crowd was shocked.

They turned around and looked at the entrance.

A juvenile was walking towards them with a faint smile.

There was a group of people following behind this juvenile and they had a unique disposition around them.

All of them had completely sealed their auras. One could not sense a shred of internal energy from them. It was as though they were ordinary people.

Everyone was shocked to see this group of people.

Within the Ren Family crowd, Ren Zhian saw a familiar figure. Looking at the old man beside the figure, his eyes constricted.

“He... He’s here!”
