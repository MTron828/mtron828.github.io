“There is no lack of heroes in any place!”

Wang Xian rode on the spirit purple qilin and rushed over. When he saw the thousands of people below the city wall forming a human defense, he was slightly touched.

In this world where humans fought with ferocious beasts and demonic beasts, many heroes were born. Their strength might not be very strong, but their actions were the most worthy of respect.

“This is much better than those guys from star-moon kingdom!”

Wang Xian thought to himself. He patted the head of the spirit purple qilin and rushed towards the battlefield.

“Prince, we won’t be able to hold on for long. Please evacuate quickly. You must not get into any trouble!”

Below the city wall, three to four extraordinary ninth level or even half-step void interpretation experts were following the young man. They were afraid that he would be in danger, so they spoke anxiously.

“Don’t worry, I’ll be fine. You guys go there and defend. Leave this place to me!”

The Young Man’s face was ice-cold as he said coldly to the three people beside him. The longsword in his hand waved non-stop.

The expressions of the people beside him were especially ugly, but they did not dare to be distracted.

There were at least 200,000 ferocious beasts in front of them. Among them, there were quite a number of transcendent level 9 and half-step void interpretation experts.

“Hiss, hiss, hiss!”

Suddenly, the sound of beasts came from the back, and everyone froze.

“Boom, Boom, Boom!”

A rain of blood suddenly attacked them.

The dense rain of blood instantly covered the front of the city gate like a storm falling from the sky.

The rain of blood not only covered them, but also the beasts in front of them.

“Not good, it’s the attack from the blood savage beasts behind us. Defend!”

On the city wall, the old man looked embarrassed when he saw the blood rain that filled the sky.

He waved the scepter in his hand and covered the girl beside him.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

Below them, the beasts were the first to be attacked by the blood rain. They let out miserable screams and fell to the ground.

The thousands of people below the city wall had a drastic change in expression. Their eyes were filled with embarrassment, and some of them were even filled with despair.

They hurriedly released their strongest defense to block the blood rain’s attack.

“Ahhhhh!”

However, the blood rain was the combined attack of twenty to thirty rank 9 transcendents and half-step void interpretation level blood savage beasts behind them. The power of the attack was something that those below rank 7 transcendents could not withstand.

The blood rain penetrated through their defenses and landed on their bodies. Like corrosive sulfuric acid, it entered their bodies and corroded their flesh and blood.

“Oh no!”

The young man standing in the middle had a drastic change in expression. His eyes revealed an extremely embarrassed expression. His arms trembled and he felt weak.

“Prince, we can’t resist anymore!”

The four experts came to their side and roared with determination in their eyes.

The young man looked at his surroundings. More than half of the guards had been struck by the blood rain. They cried out in pain and his lips trembled.

“Buzz!”

However, at this moment, they felt as though the sky had trembled slightly. A Cool and life force was transmitted from the sky.

The young man was slightly startled. The surrounding people were also slightly startled. Their faces were filled with shock as they looked towards the sky.

“This is?”

Everyone looked over and saw a blue-green fog suddenly appearing above them. The fog slowly condensed into a liquid that dripped towards them.

“What... What is this? How did the injuries on my body recover directly? Moreover, even my spiritual Qi has recovered a lot!”

A middle-aged man whose head had been hit by the blood rain shouted in shock as a trace of disbelief appeared in his eyes.

The young man looked at the liquid that dripped onto his body and his eyes revealed a look of surprise.

He quickly looked towards the left side of the sky. A ferocious beast and a young man appeared in his line of sight.

“It’s still in time!”

Wang Xian looked down and revealed a faint smile on his face.

The water wood healing ability was a very powerful recovery-type ability. Even if Ling Zilin was severely injured, it could be healed instantly.

The group of martial artists below who had yet to reach the insightful void tier could be healed easily.

“Humans who are courting death, die!”

At this moment, among the group of ferocious beasts, more than 20 blood barbarian demonic beasts saw Wang Xian in the sky. Their eyes revealed a cold killing intent.

Two half-step insightful void tier blood barbarian demonic beasts turned into a blood shadow and charged directly at Wang Xian.

“Courting Death!”

Wang Xian saw the demonic beasts charging towards him. He waved his arm and a golden stream of light shot towards the two demonic beasts.

“Awoo!”

The golden light landed on the bodies of the two demonic beasts, causing them to scream in pain. Their corpses fell towards the ground.

“Zilin, I’ll leave it to you!”

He patted Ling Zilin’s head and jumped down to hover in the sky.

“Roar!”

Ling Zilin received Wang Xian’s order and let out a roar. The aura of an insightful emptiness realm expert was emitted directly.

“Crackle!”

The terrifying aura and Ling Zilin, who had formed a purple lightning domain, stepped on the air with all four limbs. They let out sounds that sounded like the galloping of tens of thousands of horses. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Boom!”

“An insightful emptiness realm ferocious beast. That is an insightful emptiness realm ferocious beast!”

Below the city wall, everyone below the city wall was slightly shocked, their faces revealing a shocked expression.

Why did a profound void tier dire beast suddenly appear.

The appearance of the spirit purple qilin caused the bodies of all the dire beasts below to tremble, and they looked anxiously at the Spirit Purple Qilin in the sky.

Some of the weaker dire beasts were even directly lying on the ground.

“Crackle crackle!”

“Roar!”

The Spirit Purple Qilin raised its head and roared towards the sky, causing a purple cloud to condense in the sky.

Following its roar, a purple lightning bolt that was seven to eight meters thick and over a thousand meters long struck downwards.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

“Roar Roar Roar!”

In an instant, the hundreds of thousands of beasts below revealed terrified expressions under the spirit purple qilin’s attack.

“Roar!”

Ling Zilin let out another roar and another terrifying bolt of lightning struck downwards.

The terrifying lightning struck down and easily killed a large number of them.

With just two lightning strikes, at least tens of thousands of ferocious beasts had died under the attack of Ling Zilin.

“Meddlesome humans, Retreat!”

A shrill voice came from the rear. On the battlefield, all the blood barbarian demonic beasts heard the order and quickly fled to the rear.

All the beasts also fled in a panic.

Wang Xian saw the retreating blood savage beasts and the scattered beasts floating in the sky with a smile on his face.

It was obvious that Ling Zilin was not satisfied with killing them. He moved his body and directly dashed towards the group of beasts below.

The dense lightning bolts took the lives of the beasts. They opened their huge mouths and directly swallowed a level nine extraordinary beast.

Everyone in wind salt town was stunned by the sudden change. They raised their heads to look at the void interpretation level ferocious beast that was slaughtering all over the place, and then looked at the young man floating in the sky.

Everyone’s eyes were filled with respect.
