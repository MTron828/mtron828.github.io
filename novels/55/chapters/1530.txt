Chapter 1531: 1531 became obedient after a beating

“You, you...”

Wu Qingyan widened her eyes and looked at the hand of divine light that continued to attack her. A look of shock appeared on her face and she could not help but retreat backward.

“Huh? What a weird guy!”

Wu Qingyan, who was standing at the side, was stunned when she saw her sister fighting with Wang Xian.

She waved her arm and a dark aura filled the air instantly.

“Ghost Claw!”

She waved her slender hand in front of her. A brutal and terrifying ghost claw condensed and attacked the hand of divine light.

It was the first level void Interpretation Dharma Idol, Ghost Claw.

In the Wuji Empire, the dark energy was the main force.

“Bang!”

A terrifying collision came from the hand of divine light and the Ghost Claw. Wang Xian’s gaze focused slightly and wrapped up the force of the collision.

A light chain condensed in the air and flew towards Wu Qingyan and Wu Qingyan.

“Stop!”

At this moment, the old lady who was standing behind waved her arm. A wave of dark force shook and shattered the light chain.

“Hehe!”

Wang Xian smiled when he saw the old lady making a move. He looked at Wu Qingyan, he said in a teasing tone, “The Lady of Light? You are so weak and you dare to call yourself the Lady of Light. How interesting. Do you have a son of light? Does that mean I can call myself the Lord of Light?”

“You...”

Wu Qingyan looked humiliated when she heard Wang Xian’s words. She stared at him furiously.

“Kid, Mind Your Words!”

The old lady beside Wang Xian stared at him coldly when she heard his insulting words.

“The darkness attribute that I cultivate is just right. Let Me Test my power of light!”

Wang Xian looked at the old lady and smiled. He stood up slowly. His body emitted a faint light. The entire house was filled with light.

Swoosh

At this moment, a ray of light attacked the woman directly.

“Little Fellow, you are playing with fire and setting yourself on fire!”

The woman’s body shook and her surroundings were filled with darkness. A hint of killing intent flashed in her eyes.

Wang Xian stared at the dark light surrounding the old man. His eyes were indifferent.

A Sword of light appeared and attacked her arm directly.

“You are courting death. I will cripple you today!”

When the woman saw the sword of light that Wang Xian was attacking, a look of disdain appeared in her eyes.

She waved her arm and a thick wave of dark energy swept towards the sword of light.

At this moment, Wang Xian had a thought. The Sword of light became even more resplendent and accelerated.

“Bzzz bzzz!”

The sound of melting was heard and the entire sword of light disappeared quickly.

“Humph!”

The woman snorted contemptuously, but soon her smile froze.

The rapidly fading sword of light, with only a fraction of it left, struck the woman.

“Hiss!”

The woman was in pain, and her face showed a trace of shock. She looked at the spot where her arm was bleeding, and her face was very ugly.

“I underestimated you!”

“WHOOSH WHOOSH WHOOSH!”

As soon as the woman finished her sentence, rays of swords of light gathered around her again. There were a total of about twenty swords of light.

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly and controlled the twenty swords to attack the woman in an instant.

“Kid, don’t Push Your Luck. Die For me. Aspect: body wrapped in demonic clothes!”

The woman let out a sharp voice. Her entire body trembled as a body wrapped in demonic clothes attacked Wang Xian directly.

It completely ignored the surrounding swords of light.

Wang Xian looked at the body of the Dharma Idol devil suit and sensed the darkness that was protecting the woman’s body. The surrounding swords of light moved.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

Easily, twenty swords penetrated the devil suit and the devil aura surrounding the old woman.

During this process, the power of light was quickly dissolved. Only a little sword hilt was left and landed on the woman’s body.

Following that, the power of light directly entered the woman’s body.

It was as if it entered the bone corrosion poison.

“Ah!”

The woman’s entire body was in pain, and a terrified expression appeared on her face.

It was too strange. This youth’s attack was simply too strange.

She even suspected that the other party was using the power of darkness, and she was a radiant priest.

When the power of light entered her body, it actually felt like it entered the bone corrosion poison.

Furthermore, his opponent’s attack was actually able to break through his defense.

Looking at Wang Xian who was standing there with a smile on his face, his eyes were filled with fear.

He had encountered a strong opponent!

She was at least a powerhouse at level seven of the Seethrough realm. She was a powerhouse at level six of the Seethrough realm. Yet, she was actually unable to put up any resistance in front of this young man!

“How is this possible?”

Wu Qingyan and her sister were shocked when they saw aunt Feng’s terrified expression.

Aunt Feng was a powerhouse at level six of the Seethrough realm. How could she... How could she not be a match for this young priest!

A hint of fear appeared in their hearts as they gulped!

“Light restrains darkness while darkness restrains light. This restraint is really great!”

Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled. If this woman was not of the darkness attribute, he would not have been able to defeat her so easily. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

In fact, he did not even use much strength. He only used the method that he used to cure his illness and remove the powers of darkness.

When darkness entered a person’s body, it could form a bone corrosion poison. When light entered the body of a creature of the darkness attribute, it could also create this effect.

Furthermore, after this period of time, he was able to treat thousands of patients every day. He could use the power of light to dissolve the power of darkness.

Only then could he control the power of light accurately and break through the woman’s defense.

“Not bad, not bad!”

Wang Xian was very satisfied. His understanding of light had reached an extremely high level.

Looking at the three of them who were filled with shock and even some fear, Wang Xian waved his arm. A beam of light fell into the old lady’s body and healed her injuries.

“I’m sorry, the three of you. I just remembered that this lady of light should be Princess Wu Qingyan. I’m really sorry. It was a misunderstanding!”

Wang Xian waved his arm and the surrounding light dissipated. He spoke to Wu Qingyan calmly.

“You...”

Wu Qingyan heaved a sigh of relief when she saw Wang Xian healing Aunt Feng’s injuries. However, when she heard his words, she was infuriated again.

I’m the Lady of Light? You are the Lord of Light?

However, when she thought of Wang Xian’s methods just now, her heart palpitated.

“Your Highness, this person is very terrifying!”

At this moment, the woman’s voice sounded beside her ear.

“Master of Light? You Can’t be an old man, right? Also, you, you... how are you so powerful!”

Wu Qingyan stared at Wang Xian as her expression changed drastically.

Wang Xian was stunned when he heard her words. He shook his head speechlessly. “I might not be as old as you. May I Know Why Your Highness is looking for me?”

As he spoke, he looked at Wu Qingyan who was at the side. He realized that she was secretly holding an array compass and was trying to cover him.

Wu Qingyan’s head shrunk, and she hurriedly put away the formation compass.

“It’s... It’s okay, let’s Go!”

As Wu Qingyan spoke, she hurriedly walked out in a panic.

The woman hurriedly followed behind.
