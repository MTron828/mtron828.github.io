Chapter 2972: race at the center of the universe

Ever since bhang offended the dragon palace, all the god Emperors and godly monarchs in the entire bhang had fled to the depths of the bhang six directions. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

During these few years, they had been living in this place.

When the Emperor Lord learned that there was a chance to cross this place and reach the center of the opposite universe, he immediately took action.

At the beginning, the bhang desolate god Emperor and the rest did not follow.

This was because they knew how terrifying the eight desolation six directions was. Some powerful arrays, strange spaces, and desolate beasts that had lived for a long time had a high chance of dying.

They did not participate in it. The Emperor Lord continued to probe, looking for a way to reach the other side.

In a short period of time, the Emperor Lord did not find a way to reach the other side.

The people of the eight barrens were also paying attention to the situation of the resplendent starry sky and the Dragon Palace.

Until three years ago, when they learned that the Dragon King had become the king of the entire resplendent starry sky, that the Dragon Palace had dominated the entire resplendent starry sky, and that the VELURIYAM domain had submitted and the Saint Domain had submitted.

When they learned that the entire resplendent starry sky was communicating with each other, all the divine emperors and experts of the eight Barrens looked extremely embarrassed.

Through their investigation, they found out that the dragon palace was even more terrifying now.

Six rank three divine emperors had directly destroyed the two demon caves that had occupied the glazed domain and killed countless demons.

According to the information they had obtained from the AI, there were probably ten rank three divine emperors in the entire Dragon Palace.

The Dragon King’s strength was at least at the peak of rank three divine emperors.

Not long ago, they had received news that their former base had been taken away by the experts of the Dragon Palace and brought back to the imperial star field.

The number of divine emperors in the Dragon Palace could be between 50 and 100!

Such a terrifying power terrified everyone in the eight desolate galaxy.

This was especially so since all the experts from all the factions in the resplendent starry sky had submitted. It was possible that the Dragon Palace could destroy the eight desolate galaxy with a single order without the Dragon Palace taking action.

With the Dragon Palace’s terrifying strength, the resplendent starry sky would belong to the Dragon Palace for the next few million years or even tens of millions of years.

And they would have to stay here until they were destroyed.

Such a situation made all the god Emperors and experts panic.

Even the desolate god Emperor was in a mess. He gritted his teeth and immediately decided to think of a way to get out of here with the Emperor Lord.

In three years, more than 100,000 people had died. Half of them were god King level experts.

“Everyone, get ready. No matter what, we have to crack the array here. If you die, we will treat your descendants well!”

Within the chaotic energy, the desolate god Emperor shouted coldly.

“Yes!”

Behind them, more than 10,000 divine emperors clenched their fists tightly. Their faces were filled with determination.

They had no right to resist the decisions of the divine emperors.

At this moment, there was only one thought in their minds. It was best if they could rush out of this place and find experts from the universe. They would destroy the Dragon Palace and leave no one alive!

“Charge!”

A God emperor roared.

More than 10,000 god Emperors formed a special formation and attacked one area after another.

More than 10 god Emperors immediately retreated.

“Boom!”

When their attacks landed on them, a terrifying rebounding force was transmitted.

The terrifying energy charged towards the more than 10,000 god King experts.

“Peng, Peng, Peng, Peng!”

In an instant, the terrifying energy caused the thousands of godly monarch experts to collapse, turning them into a pile of flesh and blood with no signs of life.

Many of the others were also heavily injured, with only a few dozen remaining unharmed.

Seeing this scene, the expressions of all the godly monarchs in the vast wilderness were abnormally ugly.

“The array formation is much weaker. It Won’t be long before we can break it!”

At this moment, the emperor’s eyes were filled with excitement.

“Good, good, good. At most a month, we should be able to break the formation here!”

Excited voices came from the Divine Emperors one by one.

Their eyes were filled with anticipation.

The back was a hopeless situation. The front could be hope.

…

“Dragon King, the Dragon Cave of our Dragon Palace is ready!”

The experts of the eight barrens were trying their best to break the formation and reach the center of the legendary universe. Wang Xian had no idea.

Now, he had long forgotten about the eight barrens. The power of a dozen or so divine emperors was not worth his attention.

Wang Xian, who was in the starry sky with a group of girls, received a message from Prime Minister Gui.

“Eh? The Dragon Cave is finished!”

Wang Xian’s eyes lit up with joy. He told the group of girls and returned to the Dragon Palace in an instant.

The Dragon Cave was a war machine that the Dragon Palace spent more than two years to build.

Hundreds of thousands of members of the Dragon Palace were used.

One had to know that the weakest member of the Dragon Palace had the strength of a level eight godly monarch. Using so much strength, spending two years, and consuming a large amount of resources to build such a war machine was a rare effort of the Dragon Palace!

After returning to the Dragon Palace, Wang Xian’s body moved and immediately flew out of the Dragon Palace.

At this moment, beside the Dragon Palace, there were two incomparably huge creatures.

One creature was more than 300 kilometers while the other creature was more than 200 kilometers.

After Xiao Lan and Xiao Zhai destroyed Yaoxie last time, the Dragon Palace would use some resources to upgrade Xiao Lan and Xiao Zhai to the combat strength of level five and level four godly monarchs.

With the increase of their levels, their body sizes had also increased drastically.

However, at this moment, Xiao Lan’s little house still appeared very small in front of a huge object beside it.

Dragon Cave!

The Dragon Cave was created from the level five Demon Cave of the Void Divine Emperor.

At the entrance of the cave at the front was an incomparably huge dragon head. Its gaze was awe-inspiring as it stared at everything in front of it.

“Dragon King!”

At this moment, Prime Minister Gui flew over and shouted at Wang Xian with a smile on his face.

“Let’s go and take a look!”

Wang Xian nodded his head and flew towards the Dragon Cave immediately.

“Dragon King!”

“Dragon King!”

When Wang Xian arrived, the members of the Dragon Palace, including Duan Jinming from the Heaven Formation, immediately greeted him respectfully.

“Yes!”

Wang Xian nodded his head and stood at the entrance of the Dragon Cave.

“Dragon King, the Dragon Cave has been completed. All the celestial thearch-level battle techniques that I have mastered are engraved on it. Among them, there are 33 celestial thearch-level fifth-level battle techniques and more than a hundred other battle techniques.”

“All kinds of powerful battle techniques are spread throughout the entire Dragon Cave!”

The celestial thearch walked over and introduced to Wang Xian.

“Apart from the celestial thearch-level battle techniques and the battle techniques set up by the Dragon Wizards, there are also all kinds of large-scale weapons forged by the fire hammer clan. There are a total of a million weapons. All of them are capable of exploding more than 10,000 celestial thearch-level powerhouses in an instant. Among them, a few of the core weapons are capable of killing a celestial thearch-level fifth-level existence!”

Duan Jinming also walked over with a smile and said to Wang Xian.

“The most important thing is that we use the grotto-heaven blessed land where the eight barrens used to be as energy!”

The Heaven Array said with a flushed face.
