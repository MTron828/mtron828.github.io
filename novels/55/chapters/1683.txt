Chapter 1684: 1684 life-and-death pill workshop and Holy Item Forging Workshop 4

The fall of the weapon master, the fall of a demigod expert, and the desperate escape of the medicine master caused the two forces to be completely defeated.

Everyone desperately fled into the distance while the disciples of the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan chased after them.

It wasn’t until Patriarch Feng Yun made his move in the sky that several half-step longevity experts were easily left behind.

Out of the 200,000 strong army, only 10,000 to 20,000 people managed to escape their pursuit.

The rest of the people all fell in front of the fire cloud mountain range.

“Haha, we defeated The Life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging Workshop!”

“Our Fire Cloud Sparrow clan is the strongest!”

“It’s all thanks to young master Wang that the two experts of the demon God tribe are on our side!”

Excited voices came from the mouths of all the Fire Cloud Sparrow’s people.

They had thought that today would be a battle of near death, but they didn’t expect it to be a one-sided massacre.

Out of the two forces’200,000 legions, 90% of the people had died here.

There were even longevity level experts and weapon masters left here.

“Hiss... The weapon master of the life and Death Pill Workshop was actually killed. A longevity expert has died. It’s been a long time since a longevity expert has died on the continent!”

“Who is that young man? Why is the demon god of the demon god tribe so respectful to him, to the extent that he is like a slave?”

“And that young man’s strength. He clearly hasn’t reached the realm of Wanshou, but he has the ability to teleport that only a wanshou expert can do!”

“Once the item forging workshop’s item master dies, the number one forging workshop on the continent will be destroyed very quickly. Report this to the clan leader immediately!”

“This war has truly exceeded everyone’s expectations. The artifact master has actually fallen!”

The surrounding scouts hidden in the void watched this war with faces filled with shock.

From the time the two longevity experts of the demon god Tribe joined the Fire Cloud Sparrow tribe to the time the artifact master was killed.

The entire battle only lasted for five minutes.

Within five minutes, the two great factions suffered a crushing defeat.

The powerful Wanshou expert and the youth that could grow to over ten kilometers in size attracted the attention of all the forces.

“Let’s go, let’s hurry up and leave!”

“Let’s leave this place and return to the Sacred Fire clan!”

Everyone from the Sacred Fire clan, who had stayed far away from the battlefield, had shocked expressions on their faces when they saw the battle quickly end.

When they had left, a disciple had directly said that their fire cloud sparrow clan was about to be exterminated.

The current situation was completely out of everyone’s expectations.

They did not dare to stay here any longer.

“One longevity-level corpse, 20 half-step longevity-level corpses, more than 100 ninth-level void-interpretation corpses, eighth-level seventh-level corpses... There are more than 9,000 corpses above the void-interpretation level!”

Wang Xian swept his gaze across the entire battlefield and revealed an excited expression.

The resources of these corpses could bring about a huge increase in the strength of the Dragon Palace.

Furthermore, the resources in the interspatial rings of each corpse would reach a terrifying level.

Furthermore, just by relying on the resources in these people’s interspatial rings, Wang Xian’s strength would be able to achieve a breakthrough.

After all, these were the core disciples and powerhouses of the two major forces!

“Huh?”

At this moment, Wang Xian’s dragon eyes looked to the right. His gaze was directed at the members of the Sacred Fire clan who were about to leave.

A wave of dragon’s might directly enveloped over two thousand of them.

“Whoosh!”

As they were about to leave, the members of the Sacred Fire clan who were flying into the sky instantly felt their breathing stop. Their faces revealed a look of fear.

The four elders turned around with great difficulty. They looked at the mysterious young man who had already transformed into a human and was staring at them coldly. Their expressions were uncertain!

Around them, some of the fire lark clan’s experts also sensed Wang Xian’s gaze and immediately looked over.

“Congratulations to all the fire Lark clan members for defeating two major factions. Congratulations!”

Seeing that many people were looking over, the four elders of the Sacred Fire clan had a change in expression. They squeezed out a smile, cupped their hands, and said with a smile.

“Congratulations? When we left, you said that our fire lark clan would be exterminated very soon!”

A fire cloud sparrow elder said with a cold expression.

“That’s right, you ungrateful wretches. Without your help, we would have been able to obtain victory!”

“We fought against our opponents. Aren’t you a little surprised?”

Some fire cloud sparrow disciples stared at them with cold expressions and their bodies drenched in blood as they mocked.

“How could this be? We Can’t wait to be happy for you. Everyone, we’ll return First!”

The faces of the four elders turned black. The disciples behind them also had sullen faces.

As they spoke, they prepared to leave immediately.

“You ingrate, don’t leave. Kill him!”

However, at this moment, Wang Xian’s cold voice rang out, causing the bodies of everyone from the Sacred Fire clan to stiffen slightly.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

As soon as Wang Xian finished speaking, the two elders from the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan and the group of elders instantly surrounded the sacred fire clan. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Now that young master Wang had saved the entire fire cloud sparrow clan, his words were more useful than the fire cloud queen.

“You... What are you doing? We are the Sacred Fire clan, we are the citizens of the Phoenix Dynasty!”

When the two thousand plus members of the Sacred Fire clan saw the fire cloud sparrow expert glaring at them with murderous intent, their expressions changed drastically. They hurriedly shouted out in a stern manner.

“Do it!”

Patriarch Fengyun, who was standing in the distance, swept his gaze over and directly gave an order to the fire cloud sparrow clan’s expert.

“Yes!”

The two clan elders and the group of elders revealed sinister expressions. They immediately raised the weapons in their hands.

Terrifying Energy Condensed, and the faces of everyone from the Lin Sacred Fire clan revealed terrified expressions.

“No, no, you can’t Kill Us. Our Sacred Fire clan, our Phoenix Dynasty, will not let you off. You Can’t make a move!”

Everyone from the Holy Fire clan looked terrified as they shouted out loud.

“Ahhhh!”

However, Wang Xian and Patriarch Fengyun had already given the order. How could they stop.

The attacks landed on the Holy Fire clan one after another. There was no room for them to resist.

“Senior Fengyun, get ready. We Will Attack!”

Wang Xian took a glance at the members of the Sacred Fire clan who had been exterminated. There was not a hint of emotion on his face.

The Sacred Fire clan was a member of the Phoenix dynasty. Soon, they would have a huge battle with the Phoenix dynasty!

The Sacred Fire clan was the enemy.

“Alright. The two major forces have attacked us. Now that they have been defeated, we can counterattack!”

“Destroy them completely. Make the life and Death Pill Workshop and the holy item forging workshop disappear from the stage of the continent!”

Feng Yun nodded her head heavily. Her eyes revealed a cold expression.

“Leave some people from the fire cloud sparrow clan to guard this place. The rest of the insightful emptiness realm experts will follow us on our expedition!”

Feng Yun’s order sounded. All the disciples of the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan nodded their heads excitedly.

“Queen of the fire cloud, please leave the medicinal pills and spiritual herbs here for me. Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian said to the Queen of the fire cloud as he looked at Mo Sha and devil’s scale.

This time, his level could be raised by at least one level!
