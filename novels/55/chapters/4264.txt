Chapter 4265: 4264 against the King of Void!

Translator: 549690339

This time, Duke Xining didn’t expect this result.

He also didn’t expect the Dragon King’s strength to be so terrifying.

The three life-saving treasures and the extremely powerful spatial dagger in his hand didn’t even last two minutes.

He looked at the divine tree that was wrapped around his body.

He struggled and used the spatial blade in his hand to slash at it.

However, when he made his move, he sensed a terrifying energy enveloping him.

He knew that he was doomed!

“I can’t hold on any longer!”Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Duke Xining shouted at Duke Jin Ming!

“Bang!”

Following that, a terrifying energy descended on his body.

His life force was wiped out by Wang Xian!

“What!”

Not far away, Jin Ming Gong sensed that Duke Xining had been killed. His expression changed drastically.

He had the thought of retreating.

The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace and the rest were not people they could fight against!

Now that Duke Xining was dead, he would be crushed quickly.

He could not hold on for long!

“Bang!”

Wang Xian grabbed Duke Xining’s corpse and threw it in front of the Dragon Palace. He stared at Duke Jin Ming with a grim gaze!

Just as Wang Xian was about to kill him, the emergency communication device in his hand started to vibrate.

When Wang Xian saw it, he immediately turned it on.

Emergency communication device.

Usually, it would only be triggered when a powerhouse in the origin of Heaven in the nine-origin universe was in a life-and-death situation!

Now that the emergency communication was vibrating, something must have happened!

When Wang Xian saw the message in the communication device, his gaze froze slightly!

This was a distress signal from the saint’s lineage!

The unity saint was attacked by the King of the Void Universe.

He was no match at all. The entire saint’s lineage had also suffered a tragic attack!

Now, the unity saint was asking them for help!

In the communicator, there were already replies from the heaven origin creation stage powerhouses. They had also suffered an attack from the heaven origin creation stage powerhouses in the Void Universe!

“The capital of the Void dynasty is here? It seems that all the powerhouses in the Void universe are here? Are they courting death?”

Killing intent appeared in Wang Xian’s eyes. Without any hesitation, he instantly arrived at the teleportation formation.

“Green Moon Qilin Ox, I’ll leave this to you guys. I’ll go to the saint’s faction for reinforcements!”

Wang Xian transmitted his voice and disappeared immediately through the teleportation formation!

He left the body of the Void Divine Dragon and the two treasures here.

This was to ensure the safety of the Dragon Palace.

“All the disciples of the saint’s faction, Run! Run through the teleportation formation! We’re not safe here anymore!”

“Jump! Run! We are not their match at all. This is a great dao level heaven origin creator.”

“It’s a powerhouse from the Void Universe! Run!”

When Wang Xian just came out of the teleportation formation, a terrified voice was transmitted into his mind.

Wang Xian stood there and scanned his surroundings.

The mountains and rivers collapsed and countless corpses of the saint lineage’s powerhouses fell to the ground.

More than half of the saint lineage’s domain had turned into a terrifying ruin!

When Wang Xian saw this scene, his expression changed slightly!

The entire saint lineage was actually so tragic!

Boom

At this moment, in the sky in front of him, a white-robed Hetian saint flew backward heavily.

Streaks of bloody marks appeared on his body.

His entire body was completely cut into countless pieces by the power of space!

From the Void Dynasty’s king to here, in just two minutes, Hetian Saint had already been killed once!

After he was resurrected through the supreme treasure, he immediately rushed over.

In the nine-origin universe, with the help of the universe’s AI, Hetian saint was able to burst out with the strength of a master.

However, there was still a huge gap between the master level and the Great Dao level.

This was especially so when he was facing the king of the Void Universe, the king of the Void dynasty!

An existence that controlled the entire universe!

“If you don’t hand over the universe’s AI, none of You Saints will be able to live!”

The king of the Void dynasty stared at the Hetian saint and said with a face full of killing intent!

In the sky, the Void Pagoda, which was comparable to a beginner-level Tianyuan creator, stood tall!

In front of the Void Pagoda, there was a space disk above the king of Void’s head.

A pair of pale white eyes kept scanning the surroundings, as if they were trying to penetrate the surrounding void to find the location of the universe’s AI!

“In the realm of the 9-essences universe, the living beings of the other universes are forbidden to travel. The intruders will be killed even if they are far away!”

Wang Xian stared at the king of Void with killing intent in his eyes!

He roared and instantly transformed into the body of a divine dragon!

“Roar! Roar!”

Wang Xian let out a dragon roar and instantly appeared beside the Hetian saint.

The pure power of the ancestral tree poured into his body and healed his injuries!

“Huh?”

“Dragon King!”

The sudden arrival of Wang Xian stunned the Hetian Saint for a moment!

Following that, an excited expression appeared on his face.

Just now, when he sent out a distress signal, there was a reply from the Heaven’s origin creator. They were also under attack.

This made the heart of the Hetian Saint Sink.

He knew that this was a premeditated attack from the void universe.

The other Heaven’s origin creator powerhouses must have been restrained!

The Void Empire wanted to fight for the universe’s artificial intelligence!

Just when he was feeling desperate, the Dragon King had rushed over so quickly!

“Kill the enemy!”

Wang Xian nodded at him and looked at the king of Void. “Let me experience the strength of the king of Void. Roar!”

Wang Xian growled. His dragon horns were towering and two streams of energy attacked the king of Void!

“Huh?”

When the king of Void saw Wang Xian who had suddenly appeared, his expression changed slightly and his expression darkened!

“You weren’t restrained by my subordinates?”

The king of Void’s expression changed slightly. With a wave of his arm, a scepter appeared in his hand.

With a wave of the scepter, a spatial blade shot towards Wang Xian’s attack.

“With just your two useless subordinates, you dare to attack my Dragon Palace? You want to restrain me too?”

Wang Xian stared at the king of Void and said coldly!

Boom

As soon as he finished his sentence, the towering energy of the Dragon Horn broke through the spatial blade and continued to attack the King of Void!

The king of Void’s expression instantly turned ugly.

He had yet to obtain the universal AI.

If a Dragon King of the Dragon Palace of the Great Dao level suddenly appeared at this moment, this operation would probably fail!

The probability of him obtaining the universe’s artificial intelligence was infinitely close to zero!

This made him clench his fists tightly as he flew into a rage!

“You’re courting death. You, a newly risen Dragon King of the Dragon Palace, actually dared to provoke me!”

The King of void stared at Wang Xian as he roared with a face full of killing intent.

He raised the scepter in his hand and the space disk above his head began to spin.

A terrifying spatial force began to brew!

“Dragon King, be careful. The space disk above his head is a treasure of Heaven’s origin. Its attack is very strange and can ignore space!”

When the Hetian Sage saw this scene, he immediately reminded Wang Xian!
