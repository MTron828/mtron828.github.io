Chapter 1447: 1447, you are not qualified to sign it

“Welcome human experts, please take your seats!”

The ceremony arranged by the Demon Beast clan was in a circular shape and was divided into two seats. In the front area, there were demon beasts entrenched there.

On the opposite side of the demon beasts, there were seats prepared for the humans.

There were over a million seats. Compared to the humans who had arrived, it was slightly less.

However, to the demonic beasts, this seat was enough. Preparing more than a million seats was already considered a lot.

Not every human had the right to prepare their own seats.

The ferocious-looking blood savage demonic beast swept its gaze across the tens of millions of humans. Its blood-red eyes flickered with a luster as it spoke in a deep voice.

“Blood flow empire, come and congratulate the demonic beast clan on establishing an empire!”

At this moment, a group of experts from the blood flow empire flew over from behind.

The Blood Emperor, who was in the lead, looked at a few top-tier demon beast clans, cupped his hands, and said with a smile on his face.

“Everyone from the blood flow empire, please take a seat!”

A sixth level void interpretation demon scale demon beast said in a deep voice.

The Blood Emperor laughed valiantly and led his subordinates to sit in the center.

“The Flowing Emperor Alliance wishes to establish a friendly relationship with the Demon Beast Empire!”

Feng Luan led a group of experts from the Flowing Emperor Alliance and flew over as she spoke to the Demon Beast Race.

“Please take a seat!”

The leader of the bloodthirsty sea monster swept a glance at King Immortal Feng Luan and the others and let out a sharp voice.

Feng Luan nodded and the group of people sat on the seats in front of them.

The distance between them and the flowing blood empire was about five hundred meters.

“The Ice Heart Empire congratulates the establishment of the Demon Beast Empire!”

A king of a dynasty said respectfully to the Demon Beast Race.

“All humans, sit down according to your strength!”

However, what made the king feel awkward was that no demon beast answered them alone.

A Blood Savage Demon Beast glanced at everyone and said in a deep voice.

This made the king feel slightly awkward and he directly sat down on his seat.

The other factions also sat down on their seats.

As for the remaining seats, there were some powerful mercenary groups and some well-known experts who sat on their seats.

As for those who weren’t qualified to sit on their seats, they all quietly floated in the sky and watched.

No one had any objections.

In an instant, the millions of seats were filled with people.

On the opposite side, hundreds of thousands of demon beasts were facing each other from afar!

It could be said that all the strongest experts in the entire flowing sea region had gathered here.

“The life and Death Pill Workshop has arrived!”

“The holy item forging workshop has arrived!”

“The world’s third trading company has arrived!”

At this moment, three teams carrying flags flew over to this side.

“Everyone, please take your seats!”

The arrival of the three powerful factions caused the demonic beasts to look over.

A sixth level profound void tier blood savage demonic beast politely invited them.

It was obvious that their attitudes towards these three factions were different.

And the seats of these three factions were also beside the Demonic Beast clan.

“Haha, Congratulations, Congratulations. The Demonic Beast clan being able to unify is also the blessing of the entire flowing sea region!”

The elder from the life and Death Pill workshop laughed loudly, his voice spreading throughout the entire sky.

“After thousands of years of war, we also want to stop our dispute with the humans. Today, we invite three factions to testify!”

The expert from the Blood Savage Demon Beast grinned and said in a deep voice.

“With us being fair, everyone can rest assured!”

An elder at the very front of the world’s third trading company expressionlessly said in a deep voice.

“Yes, yes!”

Upon hearing the old man’s voice, the level six demonic beast nodded slightly respectfully.

“Huh?”

The actions of the demonic beast caused Wang Xian, Feng Luan, and the others to frown slightly.

The attitude of this demonic beast expert toward the old man was a little too good.

“The Bright Sun is in the sky. The founding ceremony of the Demonic Beast Empire begins!”

At this moment, a Round Void Interpretation Demonic Beast Roared, its voice resounding through the heavens and earth.

“All Leaders of the demonic beast race, board the Natal Sculpture!”

Following that, the demonic beast roared once more!

“Roar Roar Roar!”

The leaders of the demonic beast race flew towards the huge sculpture in the center.

The Hundred Meter Tall Demonic Beast sculpture represented the various demonic beast races.

Now, every leader of the Human Demon Beast Race stood on the Demon Beast sculpture that belonged to them.

The leaders of the demon Lin Demon Beast, the Blood Barbarian Demon Beast, the Bloodthirsty Sea Demon Beast, the Ghost Monkey Demon Beast, the sickle-tailed Snake Demon Beast, and so on flew over one by one.

The leaders of the sixth and fifth level of the profound void martial stage emitted terrifying auras.

Of course, there were also some weak demon beast races that hadn’t reached the insightful void realm yet.

The leaders of these weak races respectfully lay in front of the 100-meter-tall statue.

Around them, tens of millions of people looked at the leaders of the Demon Beast races in shock.

These were all their enemies in the past.

“We, the demon Lin Race!”

“We, the Blood Barbaric Demon Beast Race!”

“We, the Bloodthirsty Sea Demon Beast Clan!”

...

When all the Demon Beast leaders landed on the statue, the Demon Beast leaders raised their heads and roared.

“I am one hundred and twelve Demon Beast clans. Once again, I announce the establishment of the Demon Beast Empire. The strong are respected, and the weak are ministers!”

After they finished, the Demon Beast leaders roared loudly.

Their voices spread throughout the entire human-demon graveyard. Even the few humans who had not arrived looked over in shock.

The humans who had come to watch were also incomparably shocked.

“Hehe, are the demon beast races in the flowing sea region much stronger than the humans?”

The elder sitting in the middle of the third trading company in the world said with a smile.

“Elder Ren, if the blood flow empire could join forces with the Flowing Emperor Alliance, the gap wouldn’t be too big!”

A middle-aged man beside him said with a smile.

“Oh? What a pity!”

As the old man said this, he looked at the Flowing Emperor Alliance and shook his head with a smile.

“Hehe, who asked someone among them to seek death? They offended the two behemoths, life and death and sacred objects!”

The middle-aged man said with a smile.

“Boom!”

“I am the leader of the Blood Savage Beast, announcing the establishment of the Barbarian Empire, I am the number one emperor of the Barbarian Empire!”

At this moment, the leader of the group of beasts on the statue, the Blood Savage Beast, moved and flew to the center of the Dragon Throne.

He stood on it, looking down at everyone around him, and roared loudly.

His ten-meter-tall body, terrifying arms, and ferocious face were filled with blood and cruelty.

He stood in front of the Dragon Throne and looked down at everyone. He stared at the two demon beast races in front of him and said, “Demon Lin clan, Bloodthirsty Sea Demon clan, do you have any objections?”

“Demon Lin clan has no objections!”

“Bloodthirsty Sea Demon Clan has no objections!”

The two Demon Beast leaders bowed their heads and said.

“Haha, Good, good. The Barbarian dynasty has been established. I hereby announce that the Demon Beast Imperial City will be established with the Blood Barbaric Demon Beast Cave as the Center!”

“In addition, I hereby announce that a peace treaty will be signed with the human blood flow dynasty. From today onwards, the Barbarian dynasty and the blood flow dynasty will live in peace. There will be no fighting or aggression!” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com
