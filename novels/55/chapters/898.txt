Chapter 899: The 0900 light of death enveloped the area

Translator: 549690339

“Haha, this is Great!”

The burly middle-aged man happily picked up the entire jar of wine and poured it into his mouth.

There were not many people around the second floor of the restaurant. Some warriors quickly turned their heads when they saw the burly middle-aged man.

This burly middle-aged man was not someone they could provoke.

“Haha, this is Great!”

The burly middle-aged man wiped the wine from his mouth, reached out to pick up the wine jar, and raised his head.

However, at this moment, a white light flashed.

“Cough, cough, cough!”

The burly middle-aged man’s body stiffened slightly, and the wine in the wine jar that he lifted quickly poured into his mouth.

However, what was terrifying was that the wine actually flowed out from his throat.

“Bang, Bang!”

The middle-aged man’s body fell to the ground, and the wine jar shattered.

“What’s going on?”

The guests and waiters on the second floor were slightly shocked, and they quickly looked at the burly middle-aged man.

When they saw the blood on the burly middle-aged man’s neck, they were shocked.

“What?”

A middle-aged man widened his eyes, and his eyes were filled with disbelief.

“What happened? How... How did Li Xiong get killed all of a sudden?”

“How is that possible? He was drinking just now. The wound on his neck, this, this...”

“Look, look at that. It’s a congratulatory note. It’s the dragon spike. It’s the Dragon Assassin Organization!”

“My God, they killed people in the daytime, and they were right next to us. Li Xiong, a level 4 transcendent, was killed right away!”

Everyone on the second floor was shocked and couldn’t help but exclaim.

They didn’t even see how the killer made his move. They didn’t even see Li Xiong put up any resistance. He died directly!

This made everyone feel a deep fear.

This was a level 4 transcendent expert.

At the same time, a young man walked towards the forging workshop.

The Holy Artifact Workshop was located in the center of Holy Sea Town. It was one of the best workshops in the entire transcendence continent.

“Young master Zhu is here. Welcome, Young Master Zhu!”

The young man had just walked to the entrance of the biological workshop when the attendant inside greeted him with a smile.

“En, is my weapon ready?”

The young man raised his head slightly and said with a smile.

“Of course, young master Zhu. The forging is ready and waiting for you to take it. In the future, when young master Zhu enters Eastsea Academy with the weapons of our holy item forging workshop, he will definitely be able to slaughter everyone!”

The waiter flattered him and turned around with a smile on his face, leading the way.

The young man nodded proudly. As the most outstanding prodigy of Holy Sea Town, he would definitely be the most dazzling existence when he entered EASTSEA Academy.

Everyone had to submit to him. He could have as many women as he wanted.

At the thought of this, a devilish smile appeared on the corner of his mouth.

However, at this moment, he felt a chill on his neck. His eyes widened and his entire body instantly lost all its strength.

“Young master Zhu, please come in!”

At this moment, the waiter turned his head, bent his body and made a welcoming gesture with his arms.

“Bang!”

However, the young man’s body fell straight into the holy item forging workshop, and blood slowly flowed out!

“Ah!”

A terrified scream came out of the waiter’s mouth. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

At this moment, in two other places, the light of Death also enveloped them.

Soon, in less than half a day, the entire holy sea town was boiling.

In the courtyard of the city guards’office, four bodies were placed on the ground.

Next to each body was a red piece of paper. After the incident with the dogfish mercenary group yesterday, everyone knew what this piece of paper represented.

Congratulations on death!

The Dragon Assassin Group!

At this moment, more than a hundred city guards were standing at the side. The one in front was still the woman.

A middle-aged man stood beside the woman.

The middle-aged man had long hair like a waterfall and was wearing a long robe. He seemed to have a special temperament.

“Reporting to my lord, it’s the dragon assassin organization. They... they are simply too terrifying. They were assassinated in the daytime!”

“There are many people around them, but no one could see the killers clearly. We didn’t find them through the formation either. It seems that they can avoid the detection of the formation... this, this...”

The city guard captain of holy sea town stared at the corpse on the ground with an embarrassed look and said with some fear.

Assassin assassinations happened almost every month in holy sea town.

However, it was the first time that a level three, two level four, and a level five transcendent were killed in broad daylight.

It was strange, terrifying, and unbelievable!

All the city guards looked extremely embarrassed. In the face of such a terrifying assassin, how could they investigate? Investigate my ass!

“Sir!”

At this moment, three old men rushed over with a red piece of paper in their hands.

“Sir, this is something an old friend of mine gave me. Last Night, the dragon assassin organization threw a throwing knife at his house. The contact information of the Dragon Assassin organization is written on it!”

“Through the Jade Plate, you can contact the dragon assassin organization. You can issue missions and hire them!”

An old man in the middle handed the red paper to the middle-aged man and another jade plate to him.

“Contact the Dragon Assassin Organization?”

The middle-aged man received it expressionlessly, and the woman next to him walked over curiously.

“Yes, through the communication jade plate, you can contact the dragon assassin organization and hire them!”

“However, there are three kinds of missions that the dragon assassin organization doesn’t accept. They don’t accept missions to assassinate children! They don’t accept missions to assassinate people of great virtue! They don’t accept missions that exceed the capabilities of the Dragon Assassin Organization!”

The old man replied.

“Oh? Three kinds of missions that they don’t accept, that’s really...”

The middle-aged man paused for a moment, and a smile appeared on his face. “What a principled assassin organization!”

“There’s such an assassin organization? Don’t assassins on the continent kill people for Money?”

The woman next to him was also curious. “They don’t accept missions to assassinate children, and they don’t accept missions to assassinate kind people. I feel that this assassin organization is a little... A Little Merciful!”

“Some people still have a bottom line!”

As the middle-aged man spoke, a hint of admiration appeared in his eyes. “This assassin organization was able to instantly kill transcendents of level five in the middle of the day. It’s definitely not simple!”

“Sir, what should we do about this matter? Now, the entire holy sea town is in an uproar. Everyone is talking about the dragon assassin organization. The dragon assassin organization’s assassination this time is simply too sensational. It’s blown up!”

The old man said with a dark face.

“HMPH, it’s blown up. These are all tasks that they issued themselves. Moreover, the people who died aren’t good people. So what if they die!”

The middle-aged man snorted and said directly.

Not to mention the three non-killing rules of the Dragon Assassin Group, even if the Dragon Assassin Group was an organization that killed people for money, he would not dare to offend them.

Although his power was not afraid of this assassin group, he still had his family and subordinates.

Even if he was the highest officer and the strongest person in the entire holy sea town, he would not dare to offend such a terrifying assassin group!
