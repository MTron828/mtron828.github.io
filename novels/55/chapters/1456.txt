Chapter 1457: 1,457 hands covered the sky

“Ah, I can’t accept this. To think that I, a rank 7 profound void martial artist, would actually die here!”

The voice reverberated, startling a radius of tens of thousands of kilometers.

A roar of unwillingness and regret. At this instant, everyone froze.

Everyone, at least a billion people, all raised their heads in shock, looking in the direction of the LADYBOY graveyard.

Their eyes widened, and they flickered.

A Level 7 insightful void realm expert had actually been killed!

Were there any insightful void realm experts in the flowing sea region?

How could they have been killed?

The flowing sea region began to tremble.

And within the blood flow imperial city, the blood emperor and the three emperors trembled, their eyes filled with terror.

They had been killed, and the level 7 insightful void realm expert of the third trading company in the world had actually been killed. This... How was this possible.

At that level, it was already very difficult for him to be killed. He did not expect that he would still die in the hands of the king of the wildlands.

“Next, it’s Your Turn!”

When Wang Xian heard this desperate scream, a faint smile appeared on his face.

He extended his Dragon Claw forward. The entire Dragon Claw turned into a three-kilometer radius and met the blood-red spear of the blood emperor.

“What?”

When the blood emperor saw Wang Xian’s dragon pearl turning into a radius of three kilometers, he was horrified.

What the hell? The Dragon Claw was three kilometers in size. Three kilometers? What kind of change was this.

This was something that should not belong to this world.

“Bang!”

The blood emperor’s blood-red long spear dissipated under the sweep of Wang Xian’s Dragon Claw.

There wasn’t even a trace left behind.

“This...”

The blood emperor’s expression changed drastically. He looked at the dragon claws that were heading toward him and hurriedly dodged to the side.

Boom

The Dragon Claws landed on the Dragon Palace below. A large number of buildings were destroyed.

The castles and indestructible buildings were like paper.

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz

However, just as the blood emperor was dodging Wang Xian’s dragon claws, the five elements millstone released streams of grayish destructive energy that swept towards him.

“Oh no!”

The Blood Emperor’s face was gloomy. Dark black gas surged out from his body and covered his entire body.

“Nether Gate!”

He let out a low roar and a black nether gate appeared in front of him.

The gate was covered with mysterious patterns.

Boom! Boom! Boom

The gate opened, revealing an endless darkness that seemed capable of devouring everything.

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz

The destructive energy of the five elements landed on the gate, emitting a special sound of collision.

Crack! Crack

However, soon, the gate seemed to be unable to withstand the destructive attack and slowly cracked open.

“Oh no, what a terrifying and Strange Attack!”

The blood emperor’s expression changed drastically. However, at this moment, the Dragon Claw that was also filled with destruction attacked him directly.

“Bang!”

The Blood Emperor’s arm shook and his entire body was wrapped in dark red energy. He raised the long spear in his hand and blocked the Dragon Claw’s attack.

“Pu!”

However, in an instant, when the Dragon Claw landed on his body, a terrifying energy and power directly charged over.

He spat out a mouthful of blood. His entire body flew backward at a terrifying speed.

At this moment, streams of energy in the sky continued to attack him.

“How can this be? How can there be such a huge gap between us!”

Blood spurted out from the blood emperor’s mouth as he stared at Wang Xian in disbelief. His expression was a little dazed.

The difference was simply too great.

Not to mention the five elements millstone that covered an area of three kilometers in the sky, it completely blocked the area above him.

Even the terrifying dragon claws were not something he could fight against.

“Even if I have to die, I will bite you!”

The Blood Emperor’s expression was a little desperate. However, soon after, his expression turned ferocious. The dark red energy made him look like a devil.

“Dharma Idol, Blood Emperor’s possession!”

He roared loudly. The dark red energy surged from the blood on his body like fresh blood.

His body slowly turned into the size of a thousand meters.

The Strongest Dharma Idol!

“Break for me!”

The Blood Emperor, who was a thousand meters in size, held a terrifying long spear in his hand and stabbed at the Dragon Claw.

“Hehe, I’m not playing with you anymore!”

Wang Xian watched as the blood emperor transformed into a dharma idol that was 1,000 meters in size. There was no change in his expression.

He was too weak!

He waved his dragon claw and the five elements grinding in the sky merged into the Dragon Claw.

A force that seemed to be able to destroy the world clawed towards the blood emperor.

“Heaven-piercing spear!”

Upon seeing Wang Xian’s dragon claw, the Blood Emperor let out a loud roar with an extremely embarrassed expression. He held the long spear in both of his hands and stabbed again.

“Bang!”

A body that was a thousand meters in size was like a god in the eyes of some extraordinary martial artists.

However, in the Imperial City of blood flow, all the citizens watched as their emperor, who was in his strongest state, was grabbed by Wang Xian’s claw.

When the long spear landed on the Dragon Claw, it did not cause any substantial damage.

On the contrary, the body that was a thousand meters in size was grabbed by Wang Xian’s dragon claw directly.

“Annihilate! Explode!”

Wang Xian stared at the blood emperor in the Dragon Claw. The invisible annihilating energy instantly charged towards him.

“No, no...”

At this moment, the blood emperor was in complete despair. He raised his head and let out a final sound.

“Boom!”

It exploded!

Even when the Blood Emperor was unleashing his strongest attack, he was still easily crushed in front of the serious Wang Xian.

“TSK TSK, the combination of the Kingdom of the dragon in my palm and the Great Mill of the five elements is simply invincible!”

Wang Xian looked at the corpse in the Dragon’s Claw and revealed a faint smile on his face!

“Ah!”

At this moment, another miserable scream came from the side.

Wang Xian turned his head and saw a black and white cross flashing in the sky five thousand meters away. The corpse of an emperor was falling towards the ground.

“No, the heavens want to destroy my bloodshed empire!”

“The heavens want to destroy my bloodshed empire!”

The two emperors who were fighting with the demon Lin bloodthirsty sea monster roared indignantly when they saw the blood emperor and one of the emperors being killed. Their eyes were bloodshot.

“It’s not that the heavens want to destroy your bloodshed empire!”

“It’s that I, Wang Xian, want to destroy your bloodshed empire!”

Wang Xian stared at the two emperors. He moved his body and attacked one of the emperors with his dragon claws.

“Kill them!”

When the demonic Lin Beasts saw Wang Xian’s attack, they looked at each other. They could see a trace of fear in each other’s eyes.

The two demonic beasts immediately unleashed their strongest attacks.

On the other side, sect leader Ling and ao Yao attacked the emperor who was fighting against the bloodthirsty sea monster.

Four against one, they didn’t even have the chance to escape.

Fall!

Fall!

In less than ten seconds, two miserable screams rang out. The emperor’s corpse fell to the ground.

“Bang Bang!”

The last two corpses landed heavily in front of the Dragon Palace.

It smashed into the hearts of every citizen of the Imperial City of blood flow.

“Roar Roar!” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Wang Xian roared and revealed a smile.

The blood flow empire was destroyed!

From then on, he covered the sky of the flowing sea region with one hand!

The people of Blood dynasty below looked up and found that the sun was blocked, only the horrible dragon claws.

One hand covered the sky!
