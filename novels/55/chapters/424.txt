Chapter 425: Suppression (1)

“Miracle Doctor Wang of Rivertown, you’re too arrogant. How dare you kill the disciples of Xiao Clan. You might be a supreme talent or number one on the Outstanding Young Heroes Chart, but you won’t leave the Xiao Clan today!”

An elder of the Xiao Clan took two steps forward as he stared at the two disciples who were lying dead on the floor. Murderous intent filled his eyes.

“What a brazen fellow. How dare you barge in and take down our people. Miracle Doctor Wang, are you sick of living after remaining alive, even after killing an elder of Sacred Followers Guild?”

Another elder stalked to one side.

On the other hand, several elders of the Xiao Clan glowered at Wang Xian as they spread themselves around, forming a semi-circle to lock them down with an imposing aura.

“Do you think four of you can just barge into a Sacred Clan as you like? Today, I’ll make you pay for killing two of our disciples!”

“Those who barge into Sacred Clan shall die!”

The elder from Liang Family and the remaining five Inborn Experts stood beside those elders of Xiao Clan. All of them sneered as they stared daggers at the quartet.

“Haha, Sacred Clan Xiao Clan? We’re here for revenge. Do you think you guys can stop us?”

Wang Xian threw them a taunting look as he swept his gaze across everyone. Eventually, he stopped at the wealthy-looking lady and the people from Liang Family.

With a grin, he said, “By getting us to provoke Xiao Clan, do you think they can kill us all?”

“Today, I’ll return justice to my disciple with blood. Everyone, including the Xiao Clan and you people, is bound to die. No one shall live!” Wang Xian bellowed as he placed his hand on Xiao Ran’s shoulder. “Your enemies... You must kill them one by one personally!”

“Yes, Master!” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Haha, fine. What an insolent lad to massacre the Xiao Clan. We, the Xiao Clan, do not share any grudge against you. Even if there is, so what?”

Just then, elders flitted out from the Xiao’s Mansion. Their movements seemed like an invincible expert in the movies, drawing afterimages under the moonlight.

Five elders were led by an old lady who had a staff in her hand.

“Yu Niang!”

“Yu Niang!”

One by one, the elders from Xiao Clan greeted the old lady respectfully.

“Great-grandmother!”

Xiao Fan, who was beside the wealthy-looking lady, greeted the old lady happily.

“Hehe, today’s Xiao Fan’s birthday. Without knowing, you’re already 18. Well, well!”

The old lady beamed at Xiao Fan with kindness in her eyes. Subsequently, she spun around. “Today’s the birthday of my great-grandson. How dare you barge into Xiao Clan, going around killing people, and even threatening to take revenge on us. If so, I’ll use your blood to cleanse all the bad luck!”

As the old lady spoke, the warm smile on her face was filled with coldness when she stared at the quartet.

Xiao Ran clenched his fist tightly as he gazed at that old lady.

She was the great-grandmother of Xiao Fan. That would mean the same to him. He shared the same blood, but the treatments were completely different.

Even his great-grandmother could not recognize him. How depressing this was.

He did not feel the slightest affection for Xiao Clan.

“What a way to put it. Even if there is, so what?” Wang Xian glowered at the old lady. “You’ll find out what it would be soon.”

With a cold expression, Wang Xian looked across all the Inborn Experts and said with a mean look, “Are these all the Inborn Experts you have? If there are more, bring them over!”

“Haha, you arrogant brat. Do you think that if you’re the number one on the Outstanding Young Heroes Chart, you can be invincible? We have sixteen Inborn Experts here who can slaughter you like livestock!”

The old man from Liang Family broke out laughing when he saw what Wang Xian was doing. Idiot. A completely idiotic fellow.

The skinny old man whose arm was missing threw Wang Xian a death stare as he revealed a hideous smile. He wanted to witness this fellow getting killed!

“I’ll play with you and teach you how it feels to be in despair!”

Wang Xian looked at them as they were pressuring them with numbers. If that is the case, he would do the same thing!

Whoosh!

As his words trailed off, the Dragonians who were in black Devil Dragon attire suddenly emerged on the roofs not far away.

With a swift movement, they flitted in their direction at an amazing speed.

Twenty-five Dragonians. Wang Xian did not call for all the Dragonians, but he would still want to see how Xiao Clan landed into desperation.

Twenty-five Dragonians kept their silence, exhibiting an imposing stance around them.

Ka Ka Ka!

Cracks were formed on the ground when they landed on it.

The Dragonians behind Wang Xian were glaring at all the people from Xiao Clan with murderous eyes.

“Sixteen Inborn Experts? I think it’s insufficient!” Wang Xian grinned at the old man of Liang Family and spoke indifferently.

Sss...

The old man, wealthy-looking lady, and the skinny old man were stunned.

It had only taken a second for those Dragonians to make their appearance.

When they saw the twenty-five Inborn Experts in Devil Dragon attire, a shocking look crept onto their faces.

Even the people from Xiao Clan could not help but narrow their eyes when they saw the sudden appearance of Dragonians. Their hearts sank with horror in their eyes.

“Twenty-five Inborn Experts? You actually have twenty-five Inborn Experts? Looks like you guys are prepared!”

The old lady held the staff tightly in her hands as she glared at the Dragonians behind Wang Xian.

“Twenty-five Inborn Experts. Which force are you guys from?” asked an elder from Xiao Clan, who was appalled to see the Dragonians behind Wang Xian.

“Twenty-five Inborn Experts. They are really strong!”

“What’s going on? How did Miracle Doctor Wang manage to call upon so many experts?”

The surrounding disciples of Xiao Clan were aghast when they saw the domineering experts. Initially, they’d come here to watch a show.

“Go and kill all your enemies with your own hands!” said Wang Xian to Xiao Ran, ignoring all the shocking experts from Xiao Clan and Liang Family.

“Yes, Master!”

Xiao Ran grabbed the longsword in his hand and stalked forward.

“Whoever dares to make a move will be killed on the spot!”

Wang Xian stared at everyone from Xiao Clan and warned them with an icy face.

“How did this...Why are there so many experts? Why?”

The wealthy-looking lady was in disbelief as Xiao Ran strode forward, staring at her with murderous intent in his eyes.

A film of cold sweat covered the forehead of the old man beside her. He had never expected them to have such a terrifying force.

“The first one that I’m going to kill is Aunt Mei. Come here!”

Xiao Ran lifted his chin with eyes that were filled with killing intent. He stared at her. “You killed my mum and chased us for more than a year just to kill us. If it were not for my master, we would be dead. Today, I’ll avenge my mum!”

“Asshole, you want to kill my mum? You’re just seeking your own doom!”

Xiao Fan was looking ruthless when he saw Xiao Ran trying to kill his mother. He snatched a sword from one of the disciples beside him and pointed it at Xiao Ran.
