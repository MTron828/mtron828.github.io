Chapter 1133: 1134 hundred patrol elders

Translator: 5496903

The formation was broken. When everyone looked at the floating sea city that was gradually becoming clearer, their faces were filled with shock.

An island that looked like a city appeared in everyone’s sight.

However, this city was not like the humans. Instead, it was built with many nests. All kinds of nests were strangely shaped, causing the entire island to look extremely strange.

At the edge of floating sea city, there was a huge inscription. On it were three powerful words: Hundred Beast City.

Around these three words, there was a pattern of all kinds of demonic beasts.

When the array was broken, everyone around had excited expressions on their faces.

All of them looked into floating sea city with fervent gazes.

“It’s The Hundred Patrol Beast Tamer, the Hundred Patrol Elder, who once shook the entire flowing sea region. Oh My God, this is his hundred Beast City!”

“Rumor has it that the Hundred Beast City is extremely mysterious. There was once a dynasty that offended the hundred patrol elder. In the end, the hundred patrol elder led his ferocious Beast Army to attack that Dynasty’s imperial city and destroyed it in one night. How terrifying!”

When everyone looked at the Hundred Beast City, some of them immediately recognized the origins of the Hundred Beast City.

The Hundred Patrol Elder was a Grandmaster Beast Tamer.

Beast Tamers, Alchemists, and weapon refiners were all relatively special professions, especially Beast Tamers.

Beast Tamers learned from Demonic Beasts.

Demonic Beasts could control fierce beasts through their bloodlines, and some of the human experts had studied and learned this technique.

However, Beast Tamers had a huge restriction, and that was that one had to have high-level demonic beasts and fierce beast bloodlines.

However, the Bai Xun Elder was a legendary figure, which was why he was passed down in the area of the flowing sea.

One had to know that the flowing sea area contained more than twenty countries, with a population of over ten billion people.

The Bai Xun Elder only possessed the bloodline of a half-step void interpretation level demon beast. However, he used his unique beast taming technique to allow himself and a sixth level void interpretation tarsal bone demon beast to enter his body.

Tarsal Bone Demon Beast, as its name implied, was a special demon beast.

This demon beast could enter the body of other creatures. It could bestow power to the person being possessed, and it could also make the person die quickly.

Old Man Bai Xun completely controlled this rank 6 void interpretation tarsal bone demon beast, so his strength was comparable to a rank 6 void interpretation level demon beast.

No one knew the process, but old man Bai Xun’s strength and reputation were known by everyone in the entire flowing sea region.

He was once the strongest person in the flowing sea region, an existence that could destroy an entire country with just one person.

“Charge, hurry up and enter. Haha, The Hundred Beast City of the Hundred Patrol Master. If I can obtain the tarsal bone demonic beast, then I will be able to ascend to the heavens in one step!”

“Enter, we must enter!”

In the surroundings, tens of thousands of martial artists flew towards the Hundred Beast City with excited faces.

In the sky, seven profound void martial artists floated in the air, their eyes flickering as they stared at the Hundred Beast City. They were not the first to enter.

“Hundred Beast City. I didn’t expect it to be the Hundred Beast City of the Hundred Patrol Master. However, the Hundred Beast City before us is only ten kilometers in radius. It seems like this is only a part of the Hundred Beast City of the Hundred Patrol Master!”

An old man from the Star Moon Kingdom dressed in a python robe looked down as he muttered.

“It is rumored that three hundred years ago, the Hundred Patrol Master offended a kingdom in the vast sea region, causing the tarsal bone demonic beast to be heavily injured. Since then, the hundred patrol master has disappeared from everyone’s sight. Could This place be...”

An old man holding a staff beside the old man in the Python Robe said softly.

“This matter concerns the hundred patrol master. This Hundred Beast City is definitely not simple. You must know that the hundred patrol master once controlled more than a dozen void interpretation level demon beasts. He even had a fifth level void interpretation level Demon Beast!”

The few void interpretation level experts had solemn expressions. This matter concerned a peak level void interpretation level sixth level expert. They could not afford to be careless!

In the sky, the seven insightful emptiness realm experts looked at each other, but they did not make a move.

They needed the group of people below to scout the way. If there was danger, they could also respond.

Among the surrounding ten thousand experts, fifty percent of them hesitated for a moment before flying directly into the Hundred Beast City.

The things left behind by a top-tier expert in the flowing sea region, even if they only obtained a little, were enough for them to go all out.

As martial artists who frequently dealt with life and death situations, their courage was unimaginable.

One by one, the martial artists sized up the Hundred Beast City warily and landed in different places.

“Let’s go, we’ll go as well!”

Wang Xian’s pair of dark fire dragon eyes swept across the Hundred Beast City. He looked at Feng Luan and said directly. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Alright!”

Feng Luan nodded her head. Even if she didn’t have powerful ocular skills, with her past experience, she wasn’t someone that could be compared to an insightful emptiness realm expert.

At this moment, the two of them were wearing a black mask.

A shadow mask, a void interpretation level concealment mask.

After wearing the mask, one would be able to conceal one’s figure, and outsiders would not be able to see clearly whether it was a man or a woman.

The two of them moved, blending in with the tens of thousands of people, and flew directly towards the Hundred Beast City.

In the sky, the seven void interpretation experts still did not move.

Standing on the Star Moon Dove, the third prince watched as the group of people swarmed towards the Hundred Beast City, and a faint smile appeared on his face.

“Let’s go, we’ll go too!”

With that said, the third Prince’s body moved, and he directly flew towards the location below.

“Yes!”

The two old men and four middle-aged men beside him immediately followed behind.

“Let’s go, let’s go in. We Can’t be the first to enter, but we can’t fall behind either!”

Some clans with transcendent tier 9 experts also began to move at this moment.

“Each of these nests has an array formation. Moreover, the level of the array formation is not low. The owner of the Hundred Beasts city is really powerful!”

When he landed at the edge of the Hundred Beasts City, Wang Xian looked at the nests in front of him with a shocked expression on his face.

Each of the nests had an array formation covering them. How big of an effort was this?

“According to what I heard from the surroundings, if this old man Bai Xun possesses the strength of a level six void interpretation expert, it wouldn’t be difficult for him to build a hundred beasts city!”

Feng luan sized up the surroundings.

Wang Xian nodded his head slightly. It was indeed the case. A level six seethrough cultivator could definitely build a dynasty.

The wealth of such a powerhouse was far beyond the imagination of others.

“Roar!”

“Ah!”

At this moment, the sound of a beast’s roar was suddenly heard along with a scream.

Wang Xian turned around and saw a level seven supernatural beast rushing out from a nest.

Its eyes were bloodshot as it attacked the group of people in front of it in a frenzy.

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly and sized up the surrounding nests.

There were at least tens of thousands of nests in the entire hundred beasts city. Some of the nests had ferocious beasts in them.

These ferocious beasts were sleeping in their nests. The operation of the formation maintained their vitality.

And just rushed out of the fierce beasts, the formation was destroyed, fierce directly mad.
