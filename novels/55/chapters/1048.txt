Translator: 5496903

“Holy crap! This Morning, the Immortal Phoenix Pill and Weapon Workshop announced a piece of news. In the auction two days later, Immortal Phoenix will be auctioning together with Immortal Phoenix. There will be a half-step void interpretation pet egg and the bloodline of a half-step void Interpretation Demon Beast!”

“Are you serious? Immortal Phoenix and Immortal Phoenix are auctioning together? I knew it. This Immortal Phoenix auction is very strange. Not only did it appear out of nowhere, but its name and Immortal Phoenix’s name are completely reversed. was immortal Phoenix pretending on Purpose?”

“This immortal Phoenix should be a deliberate disguise of Immortal Phoenix. However, why would immortal Phoenix do such a thing? I don’t understand! I don’t understand!”

“Regardless of whether it’s a disguise or not, immortal Phoenix plus all of the immortal Phoenix’s items are simply insane. I heard that Immortal Phoenix has already spread the word in other cities. Many great clans of star-moon kingdom are rushing over to East Sea City!”

“When the time comes, the ones competing will not be those great clans of eastern sea city, but those great clans from star-moon Kingdom!”

“The Phoenix Immortal is really awesome this time!”

Early the next morning, a piece of news spread throughout the city, causing everyone to discuss it excitedly.

The Phoenix Immortal and the Immortal Phoenix were auctioned together, and they were named the Phoenix Immortal auction.

The items that were auctioned together simply made everyone go crazy.

All the influential clans in East Sea city were looking forward to the auction two days later.

The Union of Immortal Phoenix and Immortal Phoenix gave them more choices in this auction.

If they couldn’t get the half-step void interpretation demonic beast bloodline, they could at least compete for the half-step void interpretation pet egg.

The people of the big families began to prepare spirit stones.

“What? There is such a grand auction in the Eastern Sea City? It will be held in two days? Quick, take all the spirit stones of the family and go to the Eastern Sea city immediately!”

“The Phoenix Immortal is auctioning the half-step Void Interpretation Demon Beast bloodline in the Eastern Sea city. Such a precious bloodline will be auctioned. We must get it, we must get it!”

“Although I am a void interpretation expert, look at all of you. Each and every one of you are trash. Your entire clan doesn’t even have a half-step void interpretation demon beast bloodline. When I die, this clan will be defeated by you. Quick, don’t you know that the Phoenix Immortal of the Eastern Sea city is auctioning off the half-step Void Interpretation Demon Beast Bloodline?”? “Hurry up and bring all of your valuables with me. Immediately rush to the Eastern Sea City!”

Some of the big families in star-moon city and the other eight cities of star-moon kingdom immediately rushed to East Sea city when they received the news from Phoenix Immortal.

It was the bloodline of a half-step Void Interpretation Demon Beast, a bloodline that even void interpretation experts would be tempted by.

For a time, many powerful forces rushed to East Sea city.

“Phoenix Immortal, Immortal Phoenix, as expected, the worst news has appeared. What Bullsh * t Immortal Phoenix? It’s Phoenix Immortal’s own trick!”

“What do they mean by this? They deliberately created an immortal phoenix, meaning that I created an immortal Phoenix myself, and then joined forces with them to deliberately disgust the matter of our life and death joining forces with Your Holy Relic?”

“It must be like this. F * ck, Immortal Phoenix’s move is really disgusting!”

At this moment, in the East District’s auction house, the senior executives of the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Relic forging workshop were sitting together, slapping the table with angry faces.

The scene that they didn’t want to see the most had appeared. The Immortal Phoenix was the Immortal Phoenix!

Yesterday, they had sent the message to the senior executives. The senior executives’intention was to wait and see.

Their intention was also very obvious. They also couldn’t take out an item that was more precious than a half-step void interpretation bloodline. The matter of the auction would depend on the situation at that time.

Now that the Immortal Phoenix was the Immortal Phoenix, there was no need for them to hold the auction this time.

F * ck, even if they held the auction, no one would come to their place on that day.

Was it going to be delayed by a day?

Then it would be better not to hold the auction!

“Looks like the auction this time is going to be canceled. I didn’t expect that the immortal Phoenix would be able to turn things around!”

An old man said with a somewhat embarrassed expression.

“Peng, Damned Immortal Phoenix!”

A middle-aged man slammed the table angrily.

...

“Looks like the auction in two days will be a grand event!”

Wang Xian and Feng Luan were walking on the streets. When they heard the discussions around them, a smile appeared on their faces.

“The bloodline of a half-step void interpretation demonic beast is very precious. If it were placed in the kingdom, it would cause a huge sensation. This demonic beast bloodline should be able to sell for 40 to 50 billion middle-grade spirit stones!”

Feng Luan said with a smile, “Where did you get it?”

“From the territory of the wind-winged savage fish. Hehe, good luck!”

Wang Xian smiled. 40 to 50 billion mid-grade spirit stones. After obtaining it, his strength would be able to rise to extraordinary level six.

The strength of the group of Strange Demons would also be able to rise by a lot.

After this auction, his faction would receive a huge boost.

“Let’s go to the place where we prepared to eat yesterday. Since we didn’t manage to eat yesterday, let’s try it today!”

Wang Xian brought Feng Luan to the Western District.

“Alright!”

Feng Luan nodded her head.

“Brother, I’m sorry for what happened yesterday. I’ve Misunderstood You!”

The Little Loli, who had been following behind them, saw that they had stopped talking and immediately walked over. She held Wang Xian’s arm and apologized with a pout.

“It’s Alright, Little Girl!”

Wang Xian smiled and shook his head.

“I told you, I’m Not Young Anymore!”

The Little Loli said with slight dissatisfaction.

“How Are You Old?”

Wang Xian revealed a teasing expression as he looked at the Little Loli.

The Little Loli looked at his expression and lowered her head to look at herself. Suddenly, she thought of the big sister from yesterday and her expression instantly fell.

She was indeed very young!

“HMPH, we have to let Sister Shu Qing and the rest come over earlier!”

At this moment, Feng Luan’s cold snort came from the side.

Wang Xian looked at her innocently.

“Walk faster!”

Feng Luan glanced at him and said.

Wang Xian opened his mouth. He couldn’t understand why Feng Luan’s expression had turned cold.

He shook his head and followed behind her.

Time passed slowly. Feng Luan’s auction was held at night.

During these two days, many powerful families from other cities in the star-moon kingdom had appeared in Donghai City.

Each of them was dressed luxuriously, or they were emitting powerful auras, causing the ordinary people in Eastsea city to feel extremely nervous as they passed by.

On the streets, the rarely seen rank 6 and rank 7 transcendent mounts were walking on the streets.

The citizens of Eastsea City even saw the city lord personally go to the city gates to welcome a group of people.

Who Could Make City lord lei come out of the city to welcome them? Without a doubt, it was an expert at the profound void tier.

As for how many hidden profound void tier experts were there? Nobody knew. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

According to the information that some busybodies had gathered, there were more than thirty powerful factions that came to the eastern sea city.

These powerful clans, factions, and experts were all here for the half-step profound Void Tier Demon Beast bloodline.

Everyone could imagine that when the auction was held, it would be an intense auction!
