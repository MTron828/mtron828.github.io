Chapter 1171: Bottleneck of 1172’s development

Translator: 5496903

“Wang Xian, these are all the elixirs that you bought with your spirit stones!”

Time passed very quickly. Two months passed in a blink of an eye.

During these two months, Wang Xian had been staying in the Dragon Palace. He accompanied a few girls to cultivate in the dragon palace.

Feng Luan came to Wang Xian’s side and handed him an interspatial ring.

Wang Xian took it and revealed an excited expression. “That’s enough, that’s enough!”

“Where are Shu Qing and the rest?”

Feng Luan looked around the Dragon Palace and asked Wang Xian.

“They’re cultivating!”

Wang Xian replied directly.

“I’m going to cultivate too. I should be able to achieve a breakthrough in the next two days. There will be a grand auction in the dragon and Phoenix Royal City. Be careful!”

Feng Luan reminded Wang Xian and flew directly to a cultivation site that she had specially built on the surrounding mountains.

“I’m actually going to achieve a breakthrough. I was originally thinking of catching up to Feng Luan. Now it seems that I have to work harder!”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and flew into the Dragon King Palace.

In two months, the entire Dragon Palace was developing rapidly.

Ao qitian, Ao Qi, and the other generals of the Dragon Palace led their subordinates to expand the territory around them. In the past two months, there were no more ferocious beasts or demonic beasts within a hundred-kilometer radius.

Their strength was improving at a terrifying speed every day.

The resources of the Dragon Palace were also being collected quickly.

Compared to when the Dragon Palace descended, all the members of the Dragon Palace had leveled up by one level. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The rate at which they had leveled up was already terrifying.

The dragon assassin organization had completely covered star-moon kingdom in the past two months.

Ever since that incident in Bright Moon City, star-moon kingdom hadn’t stopped the Dragon Assassin organization at all.

Perhaps star-moon kingdom really wanted to destroy the dragon assassin organization, but they absolutely didn’t dare to act rashly before they found the dragon assassin organization’s lair and destroyed it in one fell swoop.

Ten cities, eighty towns.

The dragon Spike had now become the underground emperor of star-moon kingdom.

However, the dragon spike that occupied the entire star-moon kingdom had brought Wang Xian more than 150 billion middle-grade spirit stones in two months.

This was an extremely terrifying figure. More than 150 billion middle-grade spirit stones were enough to buy three half-step void interpretation demonic beast bloodlines.

Wang Xian gave all these spirit stones to Feng Luan and asked her to help him buy elixirs.

Feng Luan had her own alchemist.

Although the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan could not provide her with martial arts, they could still provide her with other assistance.

For example, buying spiritual herbs!

These spirit stones were all refined by Feng Luan through the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan’s purchase of spiritual herbs.

Wang Xian sat cross-legged in the Dragon King’s hall and looked at the elixirs one by one before throwing them into his mouth.

There were tens of thousands of pills in his interspatial ring. He stuffed all of them into his mouth as if he was eating candy.

As the pills entered his stomach one by one, his dragon energy was increasing at a terrifying speed.

Boom

Roar! Roar

The pills were being consumed at a terrifying speed. When he was about to consume them to the end, the sound of a dragon’s roar came from within his body.

“Roar!”

Wang Xian transformed into his dragon form. His forty-meter-long body emitted a loud and crisp sound. His dragon head, body, and tail were growing rapidly.

The aura emanating from his body was getting more and more terrifying.

In the entire Dragon Palace, all the members felt the breakthrough of their Dragon King. They knelt on the ground and bowed respectfully towards the Dragon King’s palace.

“Ding! Congratulations to host for raising your level to extraordinary level 8!”

“Ding! Congratulations to host for comprehending the water attribute divine ability: water spirit!”

“Ding! Congratulations to quality for comprehending the Fire and earth dual attribute divine ability: Fire Territory!”

“Ding! Congratulations to quality for comprehending the water and wood dual attribute divine ability: water and wood healing!”

The system’s voice was heard and information was transmitted into Wang Xian’s mind one by one.

“Phew! I’ve finally made a breakthrough after consuming nearly 150 billion middle-grade spirit stones!”

Wang Xian heaved a sigh of relief. His eyes were sparkling with excitement.

This breakthrough had given him three divine abilities. Most importantly, there were two dual-attribute divine abilities among them.

The power of dual-attribute divine abilities was far from as simple as one plus one equals two.

Wang Xian had a thought.

Name: Wang Xian

Race: five Elemental Divine Dragon (able to transform into a human)

Level: Extraordinary Level

Dragon Crystal: 176400/1000000

Supernatural ability: ruling the water tribe (ruling the water tribe that is lower than one’s own level)

Devouring creatures (devouring creatures to extract dragon crystals)

Control of the five elements

Cultivation Method: Divine Dragon Transformation

Supernatural Ability: Fire Dragon’s flame, gold splits the void, wood world descends, water crisis city, fury of the Earth, soul capture, spirit possession, light and Dark Fire Dragon Eyes, light and dark void, light and dark shadowless, Earth Dragon Shield, light and dark, divine dragon’s fire tail, water spirit, fire territory, water and wood healing!

Dragon Palace: Level 2.

Dragon Palace members: 3,3

“The three newly added abilities, water spirit and water and wood healing are supportive healing abilities. The fire territory is a powerful ability with both Earth and fire attributes!”

“I wonder if my current strength is comparable to the first level of the Seethrough realm. Maybe the fire territory can fight against the spells of the Seethrough realm experts!”

Wang Xian mumbled to himself. As he felt his strength that was ten times stronger, an excited expression appeared on his face.

The current him, an expert of the first level of the Seethrough realm, might not be able to defeat him.

As for whether he could defeat an expert of the Seethrough realm, it was very uncertain!

After all, there was a qualitative difference between the ABHIJNA and Dharma spells. It would be a little difficult to cross this threshold.

“The next upgrade requires 100 million dragon crystals. If converted into spirit stones, it would be more than one trillion middle-grade spirit stones. More than one trillion. This number is too terrifying!”

Wang Xian frowned slightly.

Every upgrade would consume a huge amount of resources. Especially after that, the amount of resources was so huge that even he couldn’t bear it.

What was the concept of more than one trillion middle-grade spirit stones? Even the royal family of star-moon kingdom might not be able to afford more than one trillion middle-grade spirit stones.

“The next upgrade will be a huge bottleneck. It will even require the accumulation of the Dragon Palace for a few years. However, if the Dragon Palace were to give all the accumulation to themselves, the development of the Dragon Palace would be much slower!”

Wang Xian frowned. The next upgrade of his strength would be a huge expenditure!

“The Dragon and Phoenix Royal City will be holding a grand auction. The items in my hands should be able to be sold for 600 to 700 billion middle-grade spirit stones. It might be a little more. However, there is still a long way to go before I can upgrade my level again!”

Wang Xian had a hesitant look on his face.

Next, he had to think carefully about how to obtain resources. Otherwise, his own improvement would slow down the progress of the entire Dragon Palace!

“Phew!”

Wang Xian returned to his human form and sat on the dragon throne. He took out the information beside him.

This was the information that Prime Minister Gui had compiled about the sea area around the Dragon Palace, as well as the future development of the Dragon Palace.

“The development of the Dragon Palace is on the right track. I can’t have too much of an impact just because of my improvement!”

“Looks like I’ll have to settle this on my own!”

Wang Xian mumbled.
