“Dragon Palace: the Ancient Sea Race and the righteous God race have been destroyed by the Dragon Palace. We can not hold the remaining disciples of the two races responsible, but no one is allowed to touch the treasures of the two races. Anyone who touches them will be killed!”

When the Universe Intelligence System of the Dragon Palace announced this statement, it immediately caused a huge uproar.

The entire surrounding starry sky was instantly in an uproar.

“The ancient sea race, the true God race was actually annihilated by the Dragon Palace. How long has it been? How powerful is the Dragon Palace to be able to annihilate the two great powers so quickly?”

“Hiss, the Dragon Palace’s power is too terrifying, right? The true God race and the ancient sea race, all their elite warriors were annihilated just like that!”

“The power of the Dragon Palace is too invincible. Could it be that the Dragon Palace has a universe Knight Level 8 existence?”

“It’s highly possible. Otherwise, how could the two powers be annihilated so quickly? One must know that the true God race’s power is extremely terrifying.”

On the Universe AI, all the races surrounding Lu Xing Kong were extremely shocked by the power of the Dragon Palace.

The Righteous God race was already very terrifying in their eyes, but they were still destroyed so quickly.

How powerful was the Dragon Palace?

At this moment, the most terrified people were the ordinary disciples of the ancient sea race and the righteous God race.

The two races had deep roots in the galaxy, and they had trillions of people.

Now that all their elite warriors were killed, they were in despair.

When the elite experts were killed, they were like lambs waiting to be slaughtered in the surrounding starry skies.

Even if the Dragon Palace had issued a statement that they could be spared, the ancient sea race and the righteous God race still had enemies!

The disciples of the two major forces had also offended other weaker races.

Now that the elites of the two races had been killed, what awaited them was revenge.

This was a fatal blow to the disciples of the two races.

However, in the face of the warnings of the Dragon Palace, they didn’t dare to take the treasures of the races for themselves.

They were afraid to give the order to attack.

With the terrifying forces of the Dragon Palace, if the Dragon Palace issued the order to kill all the forces surrounding Lu Xingkong to kill the disciples of the Righteous God race and the ancient sea race, they believed that no force would refuse, and no force would dare to refuse.

In that case, it would be a disaster for the righteous god race.

The disciples of the Ancient Sea Race and the righteous God race fell into panic.

How did things develop to such an extent?

They used to be one of the top existences in the surrounding Lu Xingkong.

The announcement of the Dragon Palace stirred up the entire surrounding Lu Xingkong.

However, it wasn’t limited to the surrounding land.

Many races were also paying attention to the surrounding land.

The Righteous God race and the ancient sea race weren’t weak in the eyes of some of the forces at the edge of the land.

Some of the forces at the edge of the land were even weaker than them.

The number one and two forces in the surrounding land attacked the Dragon Palace. Although they didn’t send anyone to investigate, they were paying attention to the intelligence system.

When they saw the news of the Dragon Palace, they were shocked.

Almost all the powers were sure that the Dragon Palace had a level 8 knight.

Otherwise, with the strength of the righteous God race, they wouldn’t be easily destroyed.

Of course, there was another possibility, and that was that the Dragon Palace had over 20 level 7 knights.

Of course, this possibility was not as reliable as the first one.

“Senior, what if the Dragon Palace discovers us? We are no match for the Dragon Palace.”

At this moment, over 10 figures were flying rapidly toward the surrounding starry sky above Split Heaven Primal Continent.

A middle-aged man frowned slightly and said.

“F * ck, can’t we not be discovered? When the time comes, we just have to hide our identities. We have to go to the treasure land of the Righteous God race.”

A middle-aged man in the center shouted in a deep voice.

The strength of the Righteous God race was known even by some forces at the edge of the heaven opening primal continent. Now that the righteous God race had been exterminated, countless experts’divine kingdom treasures were in the nest of the Righteous God race.

This was an opportunity for them.

Usually, not to mention the strength of the righteous God race and the rules of the heaven opening primal continent, they did not dare to go to the surrounding Lu Xingkong to cause trouble. But now, it was different. They only went to look for treasures.

As for the Dragon Palace’s warning, it was just a warning to the forces surrounding Lu Xingkong.

The forces of the heaven opening primal continent used to hide their identities and get some treasures. How could the Dragon Palace find them?

This time, the risk wasn’t big for them.

It was possible to get a large number of treasures from the righteous God race with a small risk. Who wouldn’t do that.

They were sure that they weren’t the only ones going to the Lu Xingkong. There were also experts from other forces.

“We can’t be careless and hide our auras. Other than using treasures to hide our auras, the Dragon Palace hasn’t landed yet.”

A middle-aged man reminded them.

The Dragon Palace hadn’t landed yet. If their race was chosen, they would be finished.

Therefore, they had to be careful.

“It’s okay. We all have acquired spiritual treasures. It’s not a big problem to hide our auras.”

The middle-aged man in the center said confidently as he flew at high speed.

And when they rushed over, experts from other factions also rushed over from the edge of the heaven opening desolate continent.

These experts relied on their treasures to hide their auras, and with the attraction of the Righteous God race’s treasures, they decided to take a risk.

“Let’s Go Faster!”

However, some forces were more unscrupulous.

A Universe Knight level eight great being was considered a top-tier great being at the edge of the land of splitting heaven and primal chaos. However, this was not the first race to have such a great being.

Some races even had one or two universe knights level eight great beings.

There were even more than a dozen of them.

Such powers had no scruples.

They immediately sent their experts over. The treasures of the Righteous God race were also a huge amount of resources to them.

If they were lucky, they would be able to obtain a large number of treasures. Why Not?

Furthermore, according to what they knew from the universe’s AI, it would take at least half a month for the Dragon Palace to reach the righteous god race in the surrounding Lu Xing Kong.

They were closer and faster.

In the starry skies, Wang Xian did not know that although the various factions in the surrounding starry skies did not dare to touch their spoils of war, some of the powerhouses from the heaven splitting chaotic land had already entered the land of the Righteous God race, they flew towards the nest of the righteous God race.

At this moment, in the Dragon Palace, Wang Xian was studying the 30 righteous god battle bodies.

True God body, the strongest universe Knight Level 7!
