Chapter 1406: 1406 Xiaoyao city was being destroyed

“The young city Lord is dead!”

“The young city Lord is dead, the young city Lord is actually dead!”

“It’s over, it’s over. In the sky, two profound void fourth rank lords were killed!”

When the young city Lord’s miserable cry sounded, everyone in Xiaoyao city looked in that direction.

In their eyes, beside the young man from the profound void third rank fire hammer clan, their young city Lord’s corpse lay there.

The young city Lord’s eyes were filled with disbelief.

Perhaps he would never have thought that he would die in the mouth of the despicable race that he spoke of.

Perhaps the entire Xiaoyao city would never have thought that the disaster in Xiaoyao city was caused by the despicable race that they spoke of.

“Soldier!”

The city lord of Xiaoyao City roared with a face full of grief and indignation. His eyes slowly turned blood-red and the hundreds of Seethrough swords beside him let out a clanging sound.

“The trial has begun!”

Wang Xian stared at the mayor of Xiaoyao City, swayed his body, and said with a smile on his face.

“Do you really think that I, Xiaoyao Mountain, have wasted more than a hundred years of my life? Go To Hell!”

The mayor of Xiaoyao City roared loudly with a ferocious expression. The void interpretation swords spun one after another, bringing with them an intense sharpness as they streaked across the sky.

“Five elements millstone, spin!”

Wang Xian’s eyes revealed a cold expression. The five elemental whetstones with a radius of two kilometers above his head smashed towards the five elemental whetstones.

“Bang, Bang, Bang!”

The five elemental whetstones with a radius of two kilometers had a thickness of several hundred meters. When the five elemental whetstones landed on the whetstones, not a single trace was left behind!

“Hehe, with the strength of the nameless sword demon, you have only been around for more than a hundred years. Bing Hanzi has been around for more than 4,000 years, yet he was still killed directly!”

From below, the people from the Bamboo Mountain sect looked towards the sky.

When they saw Wang Xian transforming into that terrifying creature, the pitch-black millstone started to spin. A smile appeared on their faces.

They looked at the mayor of Xiaoyao city with disdain in their eyes.

After the short fight just now, they were certain that the mayor of Xiaoyao city was inferior to Bing Hanzi.

As for Bing Hanzi, he had already been killed by Wang Xian!

“This time, we will fight side by side with Lord Nameless Sword Demon. In the future, our Bamboo Mountain sect will definitely rise to the top!”

The people from the Bamboo Mountain sect looked at each other. Their eyes were filled with excitement.

“Don’t kill me. I surrender. I surrender!”

At this moment, miserable and terrified cries came from below.

They had collapsed. All the aristocratic families and powerhouses from Xiaoyao city had completely collapsed after Wang Xian had killed two fourth-level profound void martial stage powerhouses.

The violent seven to eight-meter demon monkeys were hovering in the air, holding bows and arrows in their hands.

There was also the metal sword principle that was filled with killing intent!

The influential families in Xiaoyao City could not withstand a single blow from the elites of the Dragon Palace.

In the sky, many profound void martial stage powerhouses were dying rapidly. Their corpses fell to the ground.

Some people in Xiaoyao city began to despair. They could not escape from the attacks of the other party at all.

“This... Such powerful strength. Is this the member of the Dragon Palace, the other subordinate of the Dragon King? It’s so terrifying!”

“My God, we will live with such a group of experts in the future. I can’t Imagine It!” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Haha, these experts will be our brothers in the future. Our Fire Hammer clan will rise up completely!”

“We must cultivate well in the future. The Dragon King told us that our bloodline is extraordinary and that we will become experts in the future!”

In the center of the destroyed manor, more than two thousand members of the Fire Hammer clan stood there and looked at the battlefield in shock.

The experts of the Dragon Palace who had come to pick them up were killing their enemies like gods of war.

They were standing in a pure land in Xiaoyao city.

“Xiaoyao city is going to be destroyed. It’s going to be completely destroyed!”

All the members of the Gilded Gold clan were standing next to the fire hammer clan.

Because they were from the gilded gold clan, the fire hammer clan leader had called them here.

They saw the familiar clan leaders and the familiar powerful warriors of Xiaoyao city die one by one.

Even the young master of Xiaoyao City died at the hands of their future son-in-law.

As for Liu Shaohua, the eldest young master of the Liu Family?

This kind of person was not worthy of Duan Jinming’s personal attack, nor was he worthy of a profound void martial artist’s attack.

In the first round of attack, he was killed by the members of the Dragon Palace.

As for the princes and princesses of the seven or eight dynasties, they were like ants here.

They were easily killed!

Looking up at the sky, one could see the corpse of a profound void martial artist falling from time to time.

They were very familiar with those profound void martial artists!

“I Walk in light and darkness, I am the emissary of light, I am the spokesperson of Darkness!”

“Darkness and light, Cross Kill!”

At this moment, a bone-chilling voice came from the sky.

The voice was filled with killing intent.

Everyone quickly turned to look at the sky.

About 3,000 meters to the right, the black-and-white space seemed to have encountered a black hole.

Darkness and light connected to the city.

The sky returned to normal, and the old man appeared in everyone’s line of sight.

He was the former water steward of Xiaoyao City, and now a fifth level profound void tier powerhouse.

According to the water steward, this was his first battle since he broke through!

However, at this moment, his entire body was in an extremely sorry state, and his body was covered in bloodstains.

Around several vital parts of his body, there were almost fatal wounds.

At this moment, in front of the water steward, there was a huge waterfall that was about 2,000 meters long condensed from energy.

The waterfall fell from the sky. He stood in front of the waterfall, making the injured him look extremely violent.

“Milky Way Waterfall Protection!”

The Butler held a bright scepter in his hand and roared.

“Weng!”

Time and space seemed to be frozen. On the opposite side, the white and black cross flashed and appeared in front of the butler.

The cross flashed past!

It passed through the waterfall and the water steward.

The Milky Way water slowly dissipated!

The water steward’s body descended from thousands of meters in the sky towards Xiaoyao City.

The type 5 void interpretation expert hidden in Xiaoyao city had fallen!

This was the prelude to the destruction of Xiaoyao City!

“A Type 5 void interpretation expert was killed by a powerful expert of the Dragon Palace!”

In the surrounding areas, when the residents of Xiaoyao City saw the body descending from the sky, they all trembled.

They knew that the era of the city Lord had ended.

Whether Xiaoyao city would survive or not was still unknown.

“Unless, the city Lord can kill all the enemies, but is it possible?”

A citizen looked at the war in the sky from afar.

It could be said that once the order of Xiaoyao city was issued, Xiaoyao City would be destroyed!
