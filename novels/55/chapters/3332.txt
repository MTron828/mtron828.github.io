“You don’t need to know, kill them!”

The people from the cursed spirit village didn’t care about the nine candle demon race, one of the mechas roared and attacked them.

Among the 400 mechas, there were 4 universe knights at Level 8.

This power, if placed at the edge of the Open Heaven Primal Continent, was a very powerful and terrifying existence.

The other group of mechas also attacked the light tribe and the nine-candle demon tribe.

“Die!”

In front of Wang Xian, the level eight mech of a universe Knight attacked him again.

“This weird thing.”

Wang Xian couldn’t help but curse. He was confident that he could kill this mech instantly.

However, there might be people who were cursed inside. He didn’t dare to kill them.

This made him a little angry and aggrieved.

“Not good, Retreat.”

The light race and the nine-candle race were even more passive when faced with the attack of the mechs from the cursed spirit village.

As long as they fought back and killed them, they would be attacked by the curse.

However, if they didn’t fight back, the mechs were also very terrifying. Even a level 8 universe knight could kill them.

Under such circumstances, the light race and the nine-candle demon race had no way of fighting.

They could only run away!

Especially now, three out of the five universe knights at level 8 had been killed. To their race, the losses were already terrible.

The Universe Knights of the two races resisted with all their might. The rest of the members immediately disappeared and returned to their God countries.

Fortunately, they were in the blessed land. Their recovery abilities were very strong, and this blessed land had no effect on the mech.

“Let’s Go!”

The last two level 8 universe knights saw their subordinates leave and disappeared in an instant.

“Who is this guy? Why does he have the strength of A Level 8 universe knight? They are not on the same side as the light race and the nine-candle demon race.”

“I don’t know. Kill him!”

Immediately, more than a hundred mechs attacked Wang Xian.

Wang Xian frowned slightly. He flapped his incipient saint wings and flew to the side in an instant.

With his speed, the mechs could not catch up to him at all.

“These guys are really disgusting. The cursed people used technology to burst out with powerful strength. Moreover, there are death warriors among them. It’s a little troublesome.”

Wang Xian shook off the group of mechas. His expression changed unsightly.

He had already witnessed how powerful the curse was. Three universe knights at level eight could not resist it at all.

On the other hand, they were merely a dozen people who had cursed. In fact, they had even implicated their descendants.

It was strange and terrifying!

Moreover, they were indeed compatible with the technology. Creating a death warrior was simply exchanging the weak for the strong. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

This was a huge profit for many races.

“Let’s go take a look around!”

Wang Xian was unwilling to give up on this blessed land. He moved his body and flew around the blessed land.

The entire grotto-heaven blessed land was not very big. However, at this moment, the cursed people were flying unscrupulously inside.

None of the desolate beasts dared to attack them.

They seemed to be investigating the situation and were preparing to occupy the place.

“These cursed people are so weak. How did they get such powerful mechas? Which faction is behind them?”

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered as he thought of the most powerful faction at the edge of the heaven-cleaving desolation continent.

The Steel Union.

If the Lich Kingdom was ranked in the top three, it would definitely not be number one because the steel union was number one.

This was a technological faction, and it was also the strongest technological faction in the heaven-cleaving desolation continent.

In the entire universe, the technological faction of the Steel Union could be ranked in the top three.

One could imagine their strength.

The people of the cursed spirit village might have obtained the mech from the Steel Union.

Of course, it could also be from other technological races.

“Now, if I want to compete for this blessed land, I have to grasp a method. That is to resist the power of the curse.”

Wang Xian pondered in his heart.

The power of this curse was very strong. It involved the special power of karma and bloodline.

Wang Xian’s body moved and he immediately flew towards the back.

He wanted to go to the cursed pool to take a look.

Wang Xian was very fast. Two days later, he arrived at the pitch-black and silent sea area. When he flew to the center, a strange energy charged over.

At this moment, there was no one around the cursed pool.

This place was not a treasured land to begin with. It was too late to hide and no one came over.

Wang Xian approached the strange basin. The closer he got, the more he felt a strange energy eroding towards him.

This strange energy wanted to fuse into Wang Xian’s body.

“The origin of this energy is still darkness. It’s just a variation of darkness.”

Wang Xian resisted this power and walked to the edge of the basin.

Standing here was the limit of his physical body’s resistance.

Once he entered the basin, he would probably be subjected to a terrifying attack.

“The heart of light and darkness that I possess can resist such a curse? The ancestral tree can resist such a curse?”

The heart of Light and darkness and the ancestral tree were Wang Xian’s trump cards against this strange curse.

The darkness of the heart of Light and darkness was the darkness of the origin. He could give it a try.

He was deep in thought. With a movement of his body, the Taiji dragon disc slowly appeared around him. The dark part of the Taiji Dragon Disc slowly transformed into a dragon of darkness and flew into the basin.

Buzz

The moment the black dragon entered, it was struck by a terrifying attack.

Waves of strange darkness energy surged into the black dragon’s body.

At this moment, Wang Xian could feel that the tai chi dragon disk seemed to be collapsing.

“Roar!”

At the side, the Divine Light Dragon roared and flew to the side of the black dragon. It activated its tai chi and immediately fled towards Wang Xian.

It couldn’t withstand it!

The tai chi dragon disk couldn’t withstand this strange attack.

If it stayed for a few more seconds, it would be damaged.

“The tai chi dragon plate can withstand an attack from a level nine universe knight.”

Wang Xian could not help but exclaim in his heart. His expression changed slightly.

“This strange power of darkness seems to have a soul.”

He mumbled and hesitated for a moment. With a move of his palm, a grey branch appeared in his hand.

Soul-returning Wood!

The soul-returning wood could absorb souls. Of course, this soul-absorbing wood could only absorb the souls of the members of the Dragon Palace.

What if he placed the soul-returning wood into something that was invaded by the power of Darkness?

Would the soul-returning Wood’s branches be destroyed?

Wang Xian felt that the possibility was very small. After all, the soul-returning Wood’s mother was the ancestral tree. He didn’t think that a pool of curses could contend against the ultimate treasure of the Heaven’s origin.

“I wonder what will happen!”

He mumbled and placed the soul-returning wood into the pool of curses!
