Chapter 866: 0867 wanted the Dragon King to be the mount

Translator: 549690339

“Want the Dragon King to be the Mount?”

“All the immortal sects will submit and become subjects. The Sacred Glory Empire will unify the Earth!”

“Just two sacred kings of the Sacred Glory Empire came and defeated the hidden experts of the Xuan Yuan clan, who were comparable to the godly kings, in one move. There are a total of twelve sacred kings. There is no way to guard against them!”

“In the future, we will become subjects of the Sacred Glory Empire. It is possible that we will enter an ancient slave country and worship the twelve Sacred Kings!”

“No, the Empire belongs to the power system. At that time, we will live like dogs!”

The arrival of the two ancient gods of the sacred glory empire shocked the entire Eastern world and all the immortal sects.

When the people received the results, their faces were filled with fear.

Ruled by the Sacred Glory Empire?

This was completely equivalent to returning to the ancient times. The ruler was greater than the heavens, and when the emperor was angry, blood would flow for thousands of miles.

They would lose their human rights and their freedom!

The twelve ancient gods would be their masters. If they wanted them to live, they could live. If they wanted them to die, they would die!

They would become the slaves of the empire.

“What should we do? The twelve ancient gods are too powerful. We don’t have the ability to resist them at all!”

“Even the Xuanyuan clan can’t do anything. They can only surrender in despair. What can we do?”

“What about the Dragon King? The Dragon Palace is the strongest in the world, and the Dragon King is also an invincible existence. Can the Dragon King fight them?”

“How is that possible? Even the Dragon King can’t be their opponent. The experts of the Xuanyuan clan who are comparable to the godly king were defeated in one move. Can the Dragon King do it?”

Everyone was in despair. The entire East was in complete chaos. Many forces were even prepared to surrender.

“If we submit in advance, we might be able to leave a good impression on the twelve holy kings. The Holy Kings might give their own immortal sects some power!”

The Immortals from the chaos origin immortal sect and a few other immortal sects were discussing.

At this moment, they had completely lost the will to resist.

“Brother!”

In the Dragon Palace, Xiao Yu walked in hurriedly and shouted at Wang Xian anxiously.

“I already know what you want to say!”

At this moment, Wang Xian was sitting on the dragon throne. Beside him, Prime Minister Gui was reporting something.

When he saw Xiao Yu rushing in from the outside, he waved at her!

“It’s about the incident with the Holy Glory Empire, right?”

“Yes, brother. Their strength is really strong. They actually want to make you... make you...”

This was also the first time Xiao Yu felt anxious.

The opponents who appeared this time were completely different from before. They were so strong that it made her panic.

All of her beliefs came from her brother. Now, she had no confidence. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“You want me to be their mount?”

Wang Xian added Xiao Yu’s words with a smile. A hint of coldness flashed across his eyes.

“Yes, brother. What should we do? Lingtian’s father and the people from the Xuanyuan clan asked me to ask you if you have any way to deal with them. If you don’t, you can only submit!”

Xiao Yu frowned and said with an ugly expression.

Wang Xian nodded slowly. “I’m not sure!”

“Not sure? Brother, are you saying that it’s still possible?”

Xiao Yu was slightly taken aback as she exclaimed in surprise.

“You said that if you were to cultivate properly, you would be able to deal with at least one of the two people who went to Hua Xia today!”

Wang Xian patted Xiao Yu’s head.

In the past year, Xiao Yu had been fishing for fish for three days and basking in the net for two days in her cultivation. Even elder fan had reached transcendence level one, and she was still a superior immortal.

If she broke through to the first level of transcendence, she would have no problem fighting against the two experts at the second level of transcendence.

Xiao Yu stuck out her tongue. “How strong are they?”

“The two people who went to Hua Xia today are at the second level of transcendence. Your sister-in-law and the rest will be able to handle them!”

Wang Xian spoke directly to Xiao Yu and frowned slightly. “There are still ten people left. I wonder how strong they will be!”

“Then what should we do?”

Xiao Yu’s expression was a little grave.

“Whether it’s a blessing or a curse, we can’t avoid it!”

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered.

The twelve ancient gods had established the sacred glory empire and called themselves the twelve sacred kings.

From the way they were addressed, the difference in strength between them shouldn’t be too big!

If it was really too big, they wouldn’t all be addressed as the twelve sacred kings.

They might be a sacred emperor, but in the sacred emperor, sacred kings, and the like.

There was at least a clear distinction between their levels. If they didn’t, their strength shouldn’t be too big.

In fact, their strength was between the second to fourth or even the fifth level of the transcendents.

The first sky of the first level of the transcendents had a huge difference in strength. It was very easy for a second level to kill a first level.

An equal title meant that the difference might not be too great.

However, this was just a guess.

If it was really as he had guessed...

The corner of Wang Xian’s mouth curled up slightly. If that was the case, he could capture the twelve ancient gods and twelve holy kings and interrogate them about the extraordinary continent.

If that was the case, their arrival would be a good thing.

“Brother, two days later, they want all the experts from the immortal sects to gather at the seaside and wait for their arrival. They want their King!”

Xiao Yu said to Wang Xian, “They want the people from the Dragon Palace to wait for them there too!”

“Wait for their king?”

The corner of Wang Xian’s mouth curled up slightly. “We’ll go and take a look then!”

“Dragon King, the only ones in the Dragon Palace who can kill a level two extraordinary are ao Yaoyao, Kun, the blue-green Moon Dragon Queen, Sun Lingxiu Dragon Queen, and you, Dragon King. If they really fight, it will be a huge battle!”

Prime Minister GUI said with a solemn expression.

Wang Xian stood up slowly and nodded his head heavily. His face was filled with fighting spirit. “Yes, I also want to see how strong I am at the moment!”

“Get Ready. We’ll head there the Morning After Tomorrow!”

Wang Xian looked ahead and said slowly.

Prime Minister Gui nodded his head. The members of the Dragon Palace who had entered the transcendence realm were able to fight against those at the second level of the transcendence realm. However, it was very difficult to kill them.

The battle two days later would mainly depend on the Dragon King, Guang CI, Lan Qingyue, and Kun.

Two days passed very quickly. These two days were a great torment to the entire east.

The internet was filled with unwillingness and anger.

The immortal sects were in despair and were ready to submit.

Two days later, in the early morning, at the huge dock by the East Sea, more than 100,000 people had gathered there as soon as the sky lit up.

They were all people from the various immortal sects, and none of them had fallen.

All the experts and immortal gods stood at the dock and looked toward the west, waiting for the arrival of the 12 sacred kings.

Everyone’s mood was a little heavy as they were worried about their lives.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

At this moment, Wang Xian flew over with a group of experts from the Dragon Palace.

“Hiss, the Dragon King is here too. The Dragon King is also coming over to submit!”
