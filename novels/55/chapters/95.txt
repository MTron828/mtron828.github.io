There was still another reason why Old Qin and Old Xue invited him over for a discussion, and that was “strength in numbers.”

They hoped that Wang Xian would ally with them and that they could help one another out.

When Wang Xian understood their thinking, he hesitated for a moment before agreeing to the suggestion.

The reason as to why Wang Xian chose to ally with Old Qin and Old Xue wasn’t because of their strength. Instead, he felt that Old Qin and Old Xue were nice people and worthy friends.

Otherwise, with his current strength and the powers of the Dragon Sect, it wasn’t necessary for him to ally with them.

When he walked out of the meeting with Old Qin and Old Xue, it was already 8 pm. Wang Xian hesitated for a moment before heading towards the sea.

He hadn’t been back for a few days and was wondering about the progress of the establishment of Dragon Sect.

At the seaside, Wang Xian removed his clothes and easily jumped out over 10 meters.

Splash!

After letting out a light roar, Wang Xian transformed into a five-meters long divine dragon.

Five Elements Divine Dragon with five different colors. Wiggling his body, Wang Xian swam towards the island in the middle of the sea at an incredible speed.

Executing water controlling techniques along the way, he arrived at the island 5 kilometers away in a single minute.

Eh? There’re quite a number of boats around.

Wang Xian noticed a few boats around the island. The island was brightly lit and he could see some figures moving on the island.

With a thought, an invisible Dragon Power spread towards the island.

Swoosh swoosh swoosh!

Soon, several figures descended by the seaside.

“Dragon King!”

“Dragon King!”

Mo Qinglong and his disciple, together with all the Dragonians, rushed over and kneeled down in front of Wang Xian with respect.

“Martial Artist Level Six. Not bad. To be able to reach Level Six in such a short time.”

Wang Xian looked towards the group of Dragonians before turning his attention to Mo Qinglong and his disciple.

Mo Qinglong had already reached the Inborn Realm and his disciple had reached Martial Artist Level Eight.

“What’s the progress of establishing Dragon Sect?” Wang Xian looked at the Island and asked.

“Dragon King, we are right on track. In just about another month, Dragon Sect will be established. At that time, our might will definitely spread through the world!” Mo Qinglong’s eyes lit up as he reported.

“Great. Cultivate diligently!”

Wang Dahai nodded his head. Flipping backward, he dove back into the sea.

“Sending off the Dragon King!” The group of Dragonians kneeled down and shouted in unison.

Wang Xian went over to the Clam girl.

Clam girl opened her shell slowly and revealed her human form. She immediately greeted him.

Wang Xian nodded his head before devouring the marine animals in the sea.

“Bohai Sea is too shallow. The variety of fish is too limited!”

After devouring a small shark, Wang Xian sighed emotionally.

Currently, he was about 80 kilometers from land. However, the seas were only about 18 meters deep. There were barely any schools of fish around.

As compared to the other sea regions where the depth of water could reach over a thousand meters, Bohai Sea was too shallow.

If he wished to increase his level, Bohai Sea would be hard to satisfy his desire.

To increase my level, it would be more effective to look for higher Level marine animals. Higher Level...

Wang Xian pondered. Suddenly, a place appeared in his mind.

Jianghai Lake.

There was a rumor about a huge sea monster in Jianghai Lake four years ago. Some people reported seeing a huge sea monster that resembled a grinding disc. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

It had a huge oval-shaped body. Some people caught it in a photograph where one could vaguely see a monster larger than boats surfacing from the water.

However, as the distance was too far, some said that it wasn’t a sea monster but just some reflections.

There were also people speculating that it should be some giant sharks or similar marine animals that had swam into Jianghai Lake.

Everyone had their own explanations and this even attracted a group of researchers. They conducted a search of the entire Jianghai Lake but didn’t detect any ginormous animal.

Therefore, this ended without a conclusive answer.

However, the rumors of a sea monster in Jianghai Lake didn’t just stop there. There were still people claiming to encounter the sea monster from time to time.

However, none had concrete evidence and no one had seen how the sea monster really looks.

Old Qin and Old Xue talked about the sea monster of Jianghai Lake today. In that case, there might really be a powerful sea monster.

Wang Xian thought. Based on his impression, he swam quickly towards where Jianghai Lake was located.

Jianghai Lake was connected to the Bohai Sea. However, since it was deep between the lands, many simply referred to it as Jianghai Lake.

Jianghai Lake covered an area of approximately 20 kilometers.

After passing through an entrance of over 100 meters in length and 40-50 meters in breadth, Wang Xian entered Jianghai Lake.

Who would have expected Jianghai Lake to be deeper than Bohai Sea? It’s at least 20 meters deep here.

Wang Xian was slightly shocked. The waters of Jianghai Lake were a little murky. Moving his body, he dove in directly.

The dragon energy I needed for cultivation is too high now. Ordinary fish don’t provide sufficient dragon energy. If there’re higher Level marine animals, my cultivation speed would also be quicker.

Wang Xian thought. Swaying his tail, he swam towards the middle.

The distance of 20 kilometers wasn’t far from Wang Xian. He swam to the middle and started observing the surroundings.

There were few marine animals around. This was a little strange for a lake so huge.

A golden light shot out from Wang Xian’s eyes as he looked at the surroundings carefully.

He swam in the vicinity while searching, but couldn’t find anything unusual.

Eh? How can there be nothing? If it is like what the people on the Internet have said, the sea monster should be at least 10 meters long. I should be able to find it.

Wang Xian’s eyebrows knitted together but he continued swaying his tail slowly.

Growl!

A dragon roar resounded in the Jianghai Lake. Wang Xian released all his aura to announce his arrival at Jianghai Lake.

The current Wang Xian could spread his dragon power to cover a radius of 2 kilometers. All the marine animals within the area were shivering and didn’t dare to budge an inch.

The water of Jianghai Lake was ravaged without cause.

Growl!

Wang Xian swam to another person and let out another roar. His dragon roar resounded throughout the entire Jianghai Lake.

Swish!

At this moment, Wang Xian could sense something to his back.

He immediately turned over and stared at the bottom of the lake.

Indeed! The sea monster truly exists!

Wang Xian looked forward and in the direction he was facing, a huge animal was floating up gradually.

It seemed to have been lying on the bottom of the water with its entire body sunk into the mud.

As he floated upwards slowly, the mud on his body slowly fell off.

The image of the giant shell became clearer and clearer to Wang Xian. On the shell, there were small sharp edges that looked like it was made from mud.

So big, so big!

At the front of the large shell that spanned at least 10 meters, a head slowly extended out.

His head was black and had sharp edges on it. Although its eyes were black, it had a glow that could be seen through the water in the middle of the night.

Rawwr! “Who are you?”

He opened his mouth and let out a roar, showing creepy-looking teeth. He looked directly at Wang Xian.

It has intelligence!

When Wang Xian heard this dinosaur-like turtle’s growl, he was slightly shocked.

Spiritual Turtle: Level 10

Extractable Dragon Energy: 123,272

A Level 10 Spiritual Turtle? That’s equivalent to an Inborn Realm Expert!

Wang Xian was shocked and his eyes lit up with excitement as he stared at this spiritual turtle.
