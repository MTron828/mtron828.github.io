Chapter 949: 0950, they were unqualified?

Translator: 549690339

Today’s mercenary group was completely occupied by the Chamber of Commerce, and some mercenary groups in the surrounding area were answering the call.

There were at least twenty chambers of commerce, some big and some small, but the mercenary groups employed were all at least two or three silver stars.

It usually took four or five days to travel from holy sea town to East Sea city, but for such a large-scale business group, it would take at least a week.

Due to the distance, the mercenary group needed to reach at least three to four stars of silver or even higher.

It was usually safer to follow such a business group of three to four hundred people.

However, if one was unlucky and encountered danger, there wouldn’t be any ordinary danger.

The ferocious beasts wouldn’t dare to attack if there were too many people. Once they attacked, they would become powerful ferocious beasts or groups of ferocious beasts.

Wang Xian entered the hiring association and swept his gaze across all the chambers of commerce.

Each Chamber of Commerce had a different scale and required different levels of hiring groups. Each Chamber of Commerce would recruit their own hiring groups individually.

Finally, they would set off together.

“Recruit the hiring groups that are at least five-star silver tier, including five-star silver tier!”

Wang Xian looked at the two middle-aged men and an old man who were standing in the middle and conversing with the few people beside him.

“Let’s go and take a look!”

Wang Xian said to Ao Jian and the rest before walking straight towards them.

“Everyone from the Green Vine Chamber of Commerce, please continue to hire a mercenary group!”

Wang Xian walked over and said to them directly.

“Okay!”

A middle-aged man immediately turned his head and looked at Wang Xian. His eyes swept towards the badge on his chest.

“A two-star gold mercenary group?”

The middle-aged man exclaimed in surprise. However, he frowned slightly when he saw the faces of Wang Xian and the rest.

“A 2-star gold-star mercenary group. This is considered the best in Shenghai Town!”

The rest of the people at the side also looked over. A middle-aged man looked at Wang Xian and the rest and said in a deep voice.

“Your mercenary group meets our standards. However, you need to bring out the main force of the mercenary group. This time, we will issue a mission of at least 1-star gold-star. If the mercenary group doesn’t send out strong members, it will still be against the rules!”

The middle-aged man said directly to Wang Xian.

The meaning was obvious. The level of the mercenary group was a condition. However, the members who carried out this mission also had to meet the conditions.

The escort mission was obviously different from other missions.

Wang Xian nodded and said directly, “All the members of our immortal Phoenix mercenary group are here. We can accept your mission!”

“There are only twelve people in a gold mercenary group?”

A voice came from the side. A bald middle-aged man dressed in black walked over with his arms crossed and his head held high. His gaze swept across everyone in Wang Xian’s group.

A special energy swept across Wang Xian and the rest.

“Deputy Leader Ling, can you help me take a look?”

The middle-aged man said with a smile when he saw the bald leader walking over.

“Just test your strength!”

The bald middle-aged man moved his palm and threw out a stone plate. The stone plate was suspended in the air and was emitting light.

“The few of you, test your strength!”

The bald middle-aged man said directly.

“Huh?”

Wang Xian revealed a surprised expression as he looked at the bald middle-aged man.

His gaze landed on the spot on his chest. There was a golden badge with four stars on it.

A four-star gold mercenary group, a Spirit Beast mercenary group!

This should be a mercenary group that came from Donghai City.

“Our strength can not be detected by a test stone plate!”

Wang Xian looked at the stone plate in front of him and said with a smile, “You guys can ask around!”

“We only believe what we see with our eyes. If we want to accept this mission, we have to have the strength.”

The bald middle-aged man said as the corners of his mouth curled up slightly. “It’s not bad that you are a gold mercenary group, but who knows if your leader and experts have died, leaving behind a bunch of trash.”

The bald middle-aged man’s words caused the members of the Green Vine Chamber of commerce to slowly nod their heads.

Vice leader Ling was right. This kind of thing was not uncommon.

Some gold mercenary groups went on missions. If the mission failed, all the experts in the group would die.

Then, the strength of this gold mercenary group might not even be comparable to a silver mercenary group.

“Let’s test it out!”

The bald middle-aged man stared at the Captain Badge on Wang Xian’s chest. A hint of mockery appeared on his face. He didn’t believe that such a young man was qualified to be the captain of a two-star gold mercenary group.

Wang Xian frowned slightly. Their levels were indeed not high. Even the highest level, ao Yao, who was at level six of the supernatural realm, couldn’t show himself.

He was only at level five of the supernatural realm.

“What’s wrong, Kid? Could it be that all the strong people in the group have died? That’s why you’re the leader. Hehe, a mercenary group like yours is not even as good as some silver ones!” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

The bald middle-aged man said loudly with a face full of mockery.

“What a waste of time!”

The few people from the green vine chamber of commerce frowned and showed a hint of impatience on their faces. They warned Wang Xian, “If you want to accept the escort mission, you have to have real strength. I’m not trash like you guys. Let’s go, Let’s Go!”

As they spoke, they waved their hands impatiently.

“In Shenghai town, there is no mercenary group that is stronger than us!”

Wang Xian frowned slightly and placed his hand on the testing stone plate.

“Oh?”

The bald middle-aged man raised his eyebrows and looked at the testing stone plate. Then, his eyes widened. “Level five transcendence. Impressive, impressive. I really didn’t expect that there would be such a powerful young man in such a small Shenghai Town!”

The bald middle-aged man’s eyes sparkled. “No wonder a kid was appointed as the leader. His aptitude is really terrifying!”

“However, you guys are still not qualified!”

Following that, he raised his head and looked at Wang Xian with a smile on his face.

“A two-star gold-rank mercenary group. The leader is actually at level five transcendence. Let’s go, let’s go. You guys are not qualified. With your strength, don’t do the escort mission. You are simply looking for trouble!”

The few people from the Green Vine Chamber of Commerce said to Wang Xian with a cold face.

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and smiled. “If we are not qualified, no one would be qualified!”

“HMM, why are you still pestering US after saying that you are not qualified?”

The few people from the Green Vine Chamber of commerce stared at him coldly.

Wang Xian glanced at them with slight disdain. Then, he turned around and walked toward another chamber of Commerce.

“Captain Wang!”

Just as he turned around, a group of people came up to him directly. When they saw Wang Xian, they greeted him respectfully immediately.

“Yes!”

Wang Xian nodded his head faintly. He didn’t recognize the other party either.

“Hehe!”

The other party and more than 20 people smiled when they saw Wang Xian’s indifferent reply and walked straight to the front.

“Everyone from the Green Vine Chamber of Commerce, we are here to accept your mission!”

A middle-aged mercenary group led by a middle-aged man said to the staff of the Green Vine Chamber of Commerce after missing Wang Xian and the rest.

“HMM? Finally, a capable mercenary group has arrived. It’s much better than the two-star gold mercenary group that was full of water!”
