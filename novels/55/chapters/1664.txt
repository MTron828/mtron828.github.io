Chapter 1665: 1665, the real killer 3

“The Fire Cloud Sparrow race is a loyal race. I still remember when I saw the Empress’s grace and the glory of the Fire Cloud Personal Guards!”

The Demon God changed the topic again and replied with a smile on his face.

“The Empress has already fallen, and the glory of the fire cloud personal guards is no longer there!”

The medicine master said indifferently from the side.

“That’s right, but the fire cloud sparrow clan is really not loyal enough. Since the Empress has fallen, then they should follow the Empress!”

The Demon God said with a cold smile.

“Our Life and Death Pill Workshop and holy item forging workshop are helping them follow the Empress’s Path!”

The medicine master pursed his lips and took over the Demon God’s words as he said indifferently.

“Demon God, just say it. Ask the Demon God tribe to act, what price will they have to pay!”

The medicine master could not keep up with the Demon God’s thoughts and did not want to be entangled with him. He asked directly.

“Keke, our demon God tribe now has two long lifespans. Tell me, what price do I have to pay for inviting you to kill the Phoenix Dynasty?”

The Demon God smiled and looked at the medicine master and weapon master beside him.

The medicine master and Weapon Master were stunned once again.

“Exterminate the fire cloud sparrow tribe. Demon God, you won’t suffer too much loss!”

“With me and the medicine master as support, help us kill that Feng Yun Fellow!”

The weapon master pondered for a moment before continuing, “Demon God, you can state your conditions. Our Life and Death Pill Workshop and the holy item forging workshop have always had a good relationship with your demon god Tribe!”

“Pills. I need a large number of pills. I also need some pills so that my strength can increase!”

“When the time comes, I will become the Master of the nine gods. TSK TSK TSK!”

The Demon God laughed willfully. His face was filled with excitement and excitement, as if the position of the Master of the nine gods was within his reach.

The medicine master and tool master trembled slightly when they heard the Demon God’s words. They felt their hearts palpitate at the Demon God’s madness.

This fellow was simply a madman.

However, a madman who could cultivate to the longevity realm was the most terrifying.

Moreover, he only needed some medicinal pills to increase his strength.

After reaching the longevity realm, it was extremely difficult to increase each realm. This newly promoted demonic god was actually about to break through.

He might really fight for the position of the nine gods master in the future.

“Our two great factions will help you advance to the second rank of the longevity realm, but we want the resources of the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan!”

The medicine master gritted his teeth and said directly.

“Keke, good, good. Let me know when you will make a move. Send the guest out!”

The Demon God laughed wildly and waved his hand as he said to the medicine master and the Weapon Master.

“Good!”

The weapon master and the medicine master stood up and looked at each other with satisfied expressions.

Although the price of inviting the demon God tribe was extremely high, as long as they could exterminate the fire cloud sparrow clan, the loss would be worth it no matter how much they lost.

When dealing with people like the demon god, although they could not keep up with his brain circuits, they were easy to come in contact with and would not be too calculative.

The two of them waved their arms and the mirror in front of them was put away.

“Farewell. When the time is ripe, we will invite the Demon God!”

The weapon master and the medicine master cupped their hands towards the demon god and left.

“Jie Jie, Farewell!”

The Demon God sat there and cupped his hands as he said with a laugh.

“Oh, helping them destroy a fire cloud sparrow clan will allow my strength to break through again. Awesome, Jie Jie!”

“With that heart of mine, it allowed me to comprehend darkness. I feel that I have a very high chance of becoming a god in the future. Jie Jie!”

Seeing medicine master and weapon master leave, the demon God laughed maniacally.

A thousand years of ups and downs in exchange for his current strength and potential, it was worth it!

“This demon god is really terrifying!”

“I heard that a year ago, this demon God who had left for more than a thousand years returned and directly challenged the current demon god, defeating him. Later, the Old Demon God refused to accept the challenge and nearly died. The two clans that supported the old demon God were all killed. The Old Demon God is already old, and the new demon God’s methods are very cruel. The Old Demon God completely abdicated his position and became the clan leader of the Demon God tribe!”

“Even our Lord Medicine Master is afraid of this demonic God!”

“After all, he is the demonic god of the nine God Empire, a true top faction on the continent!”

At this moment, in Fengtian city, the experts from the life and Death Pill Workshop and the holy item forging workshop heaved a sigh of relief when they saw the scene disappear. They slowly stood up. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

They looked at each other and said with some shock.

“However, with the addition of this demon god, we can finally eradicate the fire Lark clan easily!”

“That’s right. For the past four to five years, the fire Lark clan has been opposing us everywhere. It Won’t be long before they disappear from the stage of the continent!”

The experts from the two major forces revealed excited expressions.

Wang Xian and the fire lark tribe were unaware of all of this. The crisis of extermination had quietly arrived.

Wang Xian sat in the restaurant. His dragon eyes of the Yin-yang and five elements scanned every corner of the city.

After lunch, he slowly walked towards a small courtyard.

In the campus, a member of a mercenary group lived here.

They were here to kill the members of the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan, for a high reward.

As a mercenary group that roamed the central continent, they had five insightful void martial experts. Their strength was extraordinary, and they had a wealth of experience.

This time, they came to kill the members of the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan. With their wealth of experience, they gained a lot.

“Let’s go. It Won’t be long before a great war between the Fire Cloud Sparrow and the two major forces breaks out. We have to retreat in time!”

The experienced mercenary group leader said to everyone.

Ever since he had obtained the half-step longevity of the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan and killed all the elite disciples and core disciples of the three major forces, he had a premonition that a war might be coming.

Therefore, he made a prompt decision and immediately led the members of the mercenary group to leave.

“Okay, we’ll listen to the leader!”

“Haha, our gains this time are already very good, and there’s almost no loss!”

Dozens of members of the mercenary group laughed out loud as they packed up their things and prepared to leave.

“PFFT! PFFT! PFFT!”

“Oh no, there’s a Kill...”

“PFFT!”

At this moment, shadows appeared behind them one after another. The expressions of everyone in the mercenary group changed drastically.

“We’re already here, yet you still want to leave safely. Next, it’s time for the strange demon to perform!”

Wang Xian walked over slowly. He took a glance at the disappearing corpse with an expressionless face and walked in.

“This is the base!”

As Wang Xian spoke, the figures of strange demons appeared in front of him.

Five hundred strange demons stood there without any expression on their faces.

They did not have the slightest intention to kill. With their concealment techniques and their current strength, only experts at level eight or above of the Seethrough void could detect them.

“With Ao Yao and I, I would like to see how many people I can kill!”

A hint of coldness appeared in Wang Xian’s eyes.

“Let’s Go!”

As he spoke, his figure slowly disappeared!
