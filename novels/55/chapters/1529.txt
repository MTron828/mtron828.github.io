Chapter 1530: 1530 children of Light? below

Inside the Radiant Mountain Villa, Princess Wu Qingyan was conversing with a group of young men and women.

This group of people were all young elites of the divine light empire who cultivated the light attribute. They were the most outstanding prodigies of the entire Divine Light Empire.

Among them were the princes of the Divine Light Empire, the children of light who were also priests of light, the prodigies of the second level of the insight void tier.

“Eh? It’s already seven o’clock, why isn’t that priest Wang Here Yet? Sister? When did you invite that priest Wang over?”

After about an hour, Wu Qingyan asked Wu Qingyan with a slight frown.

“He only mentioned the night, and didn’t say the exact time. He might rush over later!”

Wu Qingyan frowned slightly, and then said with a smile.

“Our Princess Qingyan invited him, but he came so late. He doesn’t give us face!”

The young man called son of light said with a cold smile in his eyes.

His words made Wu Qingyan’s eyes twinkle. She was slightly dissatisfied with this priest Wang.

“Maybe that priest Wang is nervously making preparations!”

A girl teased.

“It’s possible!”

Wu Qingyan nodded in agreement.

Everyone in the ruins of the divine kingdom knew who lived in the Radiant Mountain Villa.

The Princess of the Wuji Empire, one of the three strongest forces in the vast region, the princess of the Empire. No one would not give her face.

Not to mention a young priest.

Wu Qingyan took a sip of tea and waited in a relaxed manner.

However, time slowly passed. By eight o’clock, the sky had completely turned dark, but there was still no sign of anyone.

“This... that priest Wang won’t... Won’t not come, right?”

A girl frowned as she watched the sky turn completely dark.

The surrounding people also looked at each other. That priest Wang had actually rejected Princess Wu Qingyan’s invitation.

This...

Even the son of light had not expected that priest Wang would be so disrespectful.

“Could it be that something has delayed him?”

Wu Qingyan looked at her sister and said softly. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“I don’t know. Let’s call it a day!”

Wu Qingyan’s expression was a little ugly as she stood up and said.

“Qingyan, that fellow is so disrespectful. Do you want me to teach him a lesson?”

The son of light raised his eyebrows and said directly.

“No need. Others might be delayed!”

Wu Qingyan shook her head and waved at them.

“That priest Wang actually stood Princess Qingyan up. This guy is too bold!”

“Yeah, Princess Qingyan is a little angry!”

Seeing Princess Qingyan leave, the surrounding youths whispered.

The son of light who was standing in the middle had a glint in his eyes and the corners of his mouth curled up.

“Aunt Feng, help me check what that priest Wang is doing right now.”

Walking into the house from a courtyard, Wu Qingyan said directly to a woman beside her.

“It’s her highness the Princess!”

The old woman nodded and immediately left.

“That priest Wang really has a personality. Sister, you didn’t even come with your invitation!”

Wu Qingyan said with a smile.

“What personality? HMPH, it’s best if I know that he didn’t come because he had something to do. If I know that he deliberately didn’t come, I’ll teach him a lesson!”

Wu Qingyan clenched her fists and said angrily.

“That’s right, that’s right. beat up that pretty boy. The priest of Light’s boys are all cowards. Just beat him up!”

Wu Qingyan said with a smile.

“Princess Qingyan, that priest Wang is drinking tea on the balcony!”

Not long after, the old woman walked in and reported to Wu Qingyan.

“What? Drinking Tea? This guy!”

Wu Qingyan widened her eyes and looked angry.

She was the princess of Wuji Dynasty. She invited him over as a guest, but he didn’t even come over to drink tea at home.

This made her look angry.

“This guy, we can’t tolerate it, we can’t tolerate it!”

Wu Qingyan, who was beside her, also widened her eyes and clenched her fists. “Let’s go, Sister. Let’s Go and beat that guy up. Let him be so arrogant!”

“Let’s Go!”

Wu Qingyan’s expression changed. She gritted her teeth and nodded heavily.

They were originally the princesses of Wuji Empire. In the entire vast region, no one dared to provoke her, and no one dared to disobey them.

This caused them to have small tempers.

In the past, when they invited someone, they would all come over respectfully.

Now, that Guy was actually sitting at home drinking tea.

I Can’t Stand It!

“Qingyan, come, let’s Go!”

Wu Qingyan immediately stood up. Beside her, Qingyan’s face was also filled with excitement, and she looked eager to give it a try.

The two immediately walked towards the Holy Medicine Shop’s location.

The night sky in the Kingdom of God ruins was very dark. However, on both sides of the street, there were bright lights.

Wu Qingyan and Wu Qingyan rode on a horse carriage and came to the front of the Holy Medicine Clinic. They immediately walked inside.

“The three of you, are you going to... ?”

The two female receptionists said. The woman at the side waved her arm. They felt slightly dazed and looked in front of them in a daze.

“Eh? What’s going on? I’m actually feeling a little sleepy!”

The two female receptionists knocked on their heads and braced themselves.

“That guy is on the fourth floor. Let’s Go!”

The two of them walked towards the fourth floor aggressively.

Wang Xian was the only person on the entire fourth floor. The two of them looked at the closed door and pushed it open.

Crash

Wang Xian, who was sitting on the balcony, frowned slightly when he heard the door being opened suddenly. He immediately looked outside.

When he saw the two ladies staring behind him, he raised his eyebrows slightly.

“We don’t receive patients at night!”

Wang Xian looked at them and said calmly.

Don’t receive patients?

They said that they were patients?

When the two of them heard Wang Xian’s words, they immediately revealed a sullen expression.

Looking at Wang Xian, who was drinking tea with an indifferent expression, Wu Qingyan became angrier the more she looked at him.

“I am the daughter of Light, Wu Qingyan. I am here to ask about priest Wang’s strength. Take This!”

As Wu Qingyan spoke, she waved her arm and shouted coldly, “Exorcism!”

“The daughter of Light? Wu Qingyan?”

Wang Xian looked at Wu Qingyan who was charging towards him and attacking him directly. A hint of coldness flashed across his eyes.

He stared at the supernatural ability that was attacking him and focused his gaze.

The supernatural ability exorcism collapsed immediately when it was about to reach him. The power of light that had yet to dissipate condensed into the supernatural ability exorcism and attacked Wu Qingyan directly!

“What? How is this possible?”

Wu Qingyan looked shocked when she saw Wang Xian’s attack. She waved her arm.

“Hand of divine light!”

The Dharma Idol that she had comprehended from the first level of the Seethrough realm met the attack directly. She dispelled the evil and continued to attack Wang Xian.

Wang Xian looked at the hand of divine light and slowly lifted his teacup.

Buzz

Just as the hand of divine light was about to reach Wang Xian, it collapsed once again. Following that, under Wu Qingyan’s incredulous gaze, another hand of divine light condensed and attacked her.

The old lady who had been standing at the back narrowed her eyes slightly and a look of vigilance appeared on her face.
