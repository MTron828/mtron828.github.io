Translator: 5496903

“Eh?”

Wang Xian looked at the spot beside Long Xiaotian and looked at an old man on the right.

The old man seemed to be quite old, but Wang Xian could sense that he was at the first level of the Seethrough realm.

“Brother Wang Xian!”

Seeing Wang Xian flying over, Long Xiaotian greeted him with a smile on his face and shouted loudly.

“Young master Wang!”

Behind him, Long Xiaotian’s subordinates greeted him respectfully, especially those who were riding on their mounts.

They had witnessed Wang Xian’s strength and were impressed by his formidable strength and monstrous beast taming skills.

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian nodded at long Xiaotian and the rest. Riding on the spirit purple qilin, he followed beside him.

His arrival caused Bai Qingshan and the elder to take a step back consciously. At the front, only he and long Xiaotian were there.

Now, everyone knew Wang Xian’s position in front of Long Xiaotian.

Especially yesterday, they saw their second prince’s excited expression.

They had something important to do today, so they asked the second prince to push it aside and lead everyone to the blood refinement ground.

“Brother Long Xiaotian, I didn’t expect a powerhouse at the first level of the Seethrough realm to join you. It seems like your strength has completely pulled away from your brothers!”

Wang Xian said to him with a smile.

“Haha, then I have to thank brother Wang Xian. After you helped to Tame the nether deer last time, elder Zhu led his mercenary group to join you.”

Long Xiaotian said happily as he moved closer to Wang Xian. He looked at the spirit purple qilin and the blood fiend turtle with some envy.

“Hehe, brother Wang Xian, see if you can help me tame a level one void interpretation beast. If that’s the case, it’ll be too cool!”

He said to Wang Xian shamelessly.

“If I can meet it, it’s totally possible!”

Wang Xian nodded with a smile.

“Really?”

Long Xiaotian’s eyes lit up!

He nodded. “After we return this time, I’ll help you get rid of all your brothers’subordinates!”

“Eh? Brother Wang Xian, what are you doing?”

Long Xiaotian was slightly surprised when he heard Wang Xian’s words. He asked in surprise.

“Someone tried to assassinate me last night. Therefore, it’s better to let your brothers despair quickly!”

Wang Xian smiled and said calmly.

“What? They actually hired assassins?”

Long Xiaotian’s expression changed as a hint of coldness flashed across his eyes. “Alright then. If brother Wang Xian helps, with my strength, I can destroy their forces, even if it’s the four of them working together!”

“Alright!” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Wang Xian nodded his head. With Long Xiaotian’s current two insightful emptiness realm experts following him and his two ferocious beasts, he could annihilate all of his brothers’subordinates even if he didn’t make a move.

The group of them flew towards the blood refinement ground. Long Xiaotian was deep in thought along the way. It was obvious that he was thinking about what to do next.

Wang Xian, Long Xiaotian and the rest flew towards the blood refinement ground in a mighty manner. Some of the people around them avoided them when they saw them.

The current long Xiaotian was well-known in the human-demon graveyard.

The blood refinement ground was even further away than the main hall. It was located at the edge of the human-demon graveyard.

There were many huge buildings there. Each building contained a powerful energy fluctuation.

There were some changes in the position of the ocean to the left.

In the ocean to the left, there were islands of different sizes.

That place also belonged to the land of blood refinement.

“Let’s go, we’ll go from the bottom!”

The group came to the bottom of the huge buildings. The buildings were like towers. There was nothing in the towers. Instead, there was a staircase leading down.

This place was a huge tunnel left behind by the blood stream sect in the past.

The tunnel led to the interior of the blood refinement ground about fifty kilometers away.

There were many such tunnels, and the number of people here was more than ten times that of other places.

There were hundreds of thousands of people entering and leaving the tunnel. As soon as they entered the tunnel, they could see at least a few thousand people.

There were mercenary groups and some powerful factions.

The blood refinement ground was a desolate territory. There were countless fierce beasts living here, and there were also all kinds of spiritual herbs growing in it.

In the land of blood refinement, there was an area of blood essence craggy demon beasts.

The blood essence craggy demon was a kind of tree, an extremely terrifying tree.

Especially the blood essence craggy demon king, it was a tree demon that covered an area of ten kilometers and had countless vines.

This tree demon had the strength of the eighth level of the profound void tier, and it was extremely terrifying.

In the entire flowing sea area, it was absolutely an invincible existence.

However, this tree demon could not move.

The blood essence craggy demons could absorb the corpses of living beings and condense their blood essence. Many people came to the training grounds to kill ferocious beasts. Some weaker blood essence craggy demons would absorb them and turn them into blood essence before taking them away.

The Blood Stream sect’s formation for condensing blood essence came from the blood essence craggy demons.

By killing ferocious beasts, demonic beasts, and even humans, one could turn them into blood essence that could be absorbed by others in the training grounds.

“Brother Wang Xian, we are not familiar with the blood refinement ground. If we want to tame the ferocious beasts, we need to slowly search for them ourselves.”

“Moreover, the blood refinement ground is filled with dangers. Demonic Beasts, powerful ferocious beasts, even a group of us have to be careful!”

Walking in the deep tunnel, Long Xiaotian said to Wang Xian.

“Leave it to me!”

Wang Xian said to Long Xiaotian.

He had the Dragon Eyes of light and dark fire. In the wild, it was an extremely heaven-defying investigative method.

“Brother Wang Xian, my subordinates are not weak either!”

Long Xiaotian smiled and shouted, “Let’s go, let’s increase our speed!”

The group of them increased their speed and sped forward.

Soon, exit after exit appeared above them. They did not leave immediately but continued to go deeper.

They arrived at the end of the tunnel. The entrance was in the middle of the forest.

Towering trees and the roars of birds and beasts could be heard from afar from time to time.

Due to the proximity to the ocean, the entire forest was extremely humid.

Poisonous insects, birds and beasts. This place was a paradise for ferocious beasts.

“Follow me!”

Wang Xian spoke to everyone and walked straight to the front.

He scanned his surroundings with his bewitching eyes. The blood refinement ground was filled with danger. In his eyes, there was no danger at all.

“Now, let’s begin my performance!”

Wang Xian revealed a smile. With his current strength, it was a piece of cake for him to tame a group of ferocious beasts below the insightful void realm.

“Follow behind!”

“Scouts are scattered around the area. You must be careful!”

Long Xiaotian ordered loudly. A vigilant look appeared on his face as he followed behind Wang Xian.

The two experts at the first level of the insightful void stage also braced themselves.

This was a bloody place for blood refinement. Even the insightful void stage experts had the possibility of dying. They had no choice but to be careful!
