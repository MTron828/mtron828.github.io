“Brother-in-law is going to have a life and death battle with Liao Feiyu because of his mother’s matter. The battle is about to begin, and this matter has already spread like wildfire in the underground city! ”

At the location where the Nine River Tribe lived, a youth reported loudly to Gong Chengmu, his face filled with anxiety!

When Gong Chengmu heard this, his expression was a little dazed!

Tianci was going to have a life and death battle with Liao Feiyu?

Liao Feiyu?

Liao Feiyu, she knew, a top-tier Heaven’s Pride Group’s Heaven’s Pride Group’s Heaven’s Pride Group!

In the six paths universe, among the heaven’s pride generation, it was considered to be the hot favorite to win the championship!

Why would tianci want to have a life and death battle with Liao Feiyu!

“No, no, I have to stop him immediately. Tianci isn’t Liao Feiyu’s match at all, I have to stop him immediately!”

Gong Cheng Glanced at the panicked expression on his face and quickly ran outside!

“Ah, sister, don’t worry. Just now, brother-in-law killed Liao Fei Yu’s sister, Liao Fei Yan. Liao Fei Yan was a Pinnacle Universe Knight, and he was killed by brother-in-law! ”

“Brother-in-law hid his strength. His strength is also at the Pinnacle Universe Knight level. He’s extremely terrifying. Damn, this news is boiling in the entire earth city. Brother-in-law hasn’t cultivated for 100 million years, yet he has such terrifying strength. It’s simply heaven-defying! ”

The young man saw his sister’s panicked expression and hurriedly followed behind and said loudly.

This news was obtained from the chat group of the Hidden Dragon and young Phoenix Group.

When he heard this news, he was also dumbfounded and filled with disbelief!

Now, all the Great Beings from the tribes had rushed over to watch this life-and-death battle!

They had all come to take a look at that young man who had cultivated for less than 100 million years, yet had reached the pinnacle level of a universe knight! This could be said to be unprecedented in the entire six paths universe!

“What?”

Gong Cheng Xiao’s body stiffened slightly when he heard these words. However, he did not ask further and immediately flew out.

Outside the Earth cave where they lived was the arena.

When he flew out, he saw two figures standing on the arena!

The surrounding disciples were all rushing over!

“Damn, how is this possible, brother Tian Chi has the strength of a Pinnacle

Knight! ”

Gong Cheng Mu arrived at the edge of the arena and heard Tu Jiang Tong’s shocked Roar!

The disciples who had just arrived were all discussing in shock!

“Are you ready to die?”

In the arena, Liao Feiyu stared at Tianci with a cold face. His face was full of violent killing intent and confidence!

Today, Mu Litianci had made him lose a lot of face. He wanted to make him pay with his life!

“Damn it, it’s You!”

Hearing Liao Feiyu’s words, Tianci’s face was full of coldness. With a move of his hand, he held the sharp sword in his hand and directly attacked!

“TIANCI, be careful! ”

Below the stage, Gong Cheng Glanced at the battle that had erupted, and his face was filled with anxiety and concern as he shouted loudly!

“You don’t know Death! ”

Liao Feiyu saw Tianci taking the initiative to attack him, and his face was filled with a cold expression!

His palm moved, and a shield and a long spear appeared in his hand! He waved the long spear, and directly stabbed towards tianci!

“Rumble!”

With a single move, the arena cracked open and a burst of Earth attribute energy charged towards tianci!

Tianci waved his arm and numerous water attribute sharp swords flew towards his surroundings!

Following that, they swiftly floated above his head and formed a sword formation!

The sword formation directly met Liao Feiyu’s Attack!

“Peng Peng Peng! ”

The Sword Formation attacked. The sharp swords carried a powerful might as they directly broke through Liao Feiyu ‘s Attack!

Following that, the power of the sword formation did not decrease as it attacked towards Liao Feiyu’s Attack!

“Earth, Sky High! ”CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Liao Feiyu felt the power of Tianci’s attack. His gaze focused and he immediately raised his shield!

The surrounding soil spread towards the shield and formed an incomparably thick and heavy defense!

“Water, Doppelganger! ”

“Water, sword tomb!”

Seeing this scene, Tianci’s eyes focused, and his body turned into dozens of doppelgangers!

Each of the doppelgangers held a water sword in their hands and stood in a fixed position.

Dozens of doppelgangers attacked Liao Feiyu at the same time!

“Humph! ”

Seeing this scene, Liao Feiyu’s face turned ugly!

He didn’t immediately use the bloodline weapon in his body!

If he used such a weapon right from the start, he would be despised by others!

He shouted loudly, and the surrounding soil rushed towards his body.

His entire body began to grow rapidly, and soon he became a hundred-meter-tall giant!

The long spear in his hand also became more than ten times bigger under the cover of the soil!

Liao Feiyu stared at Tianci’s figure with contempt, and the long spear in his hand swept out with a terrifying power!

Sword 21! ”

Tianci’s expression did not change when he saw this scene!

His 21 clones suddenly turned into water energy and surged into the water sword in his hand!

The water sword instantly shone brightly and streaked across a stream of light.

The 21 sharp swords connected together and brought with them a sharp edge as they went straight for the long spear. “Bang Bang Bang! ”

An intense collision sound rang out.

Everyone around could see that the long spear in Liao Feiyu’s hand slowly turned into soil and fell to the ground!

The water sword turned into a stream of water and attached itself to the long spear, instantly attacking his giant arm!

“Damn it, what kind of strange attack is This!”

When Liao Feiyu saw this scene, his expression changed drastically, and he hurriedly dodged!

One of his giant arms was broken!

However, he was not injured.

“This? ? Liao Feiyu was actually suppressed by Mu Litianci. Mu Litianci’s technique is so strong! ”

“Liao Feiyu is at a disadvantage. What sword technique does Mu litianci have? It’s so strong! ”

“Hiss, I can’t imagine it. Isn’t this Mu Litianci too monstrous?”

In the surrounding area, all the powerful disciples saw that Mu Litianci had completely suppressed Liao Feiyu. All of them opened their eyes wide and discussed.

The youths from the Hidden Dragon and young Phoenix Group were even more dumbfounded!

There was actually such a terrifying existence hidden among them?

This? ?

“What kind of opportunity did mu litianci obtain?”

The gazes of the upper seats and the experts from the top tribes flickered as they looked at Mu Li Tianci. Their Hearts were slightly shaken.

What kind of opportunity could cause such a young youth to possess such great strength?

“Tianci! ”

At this moment, Mu Li Yin c er, who was seated at the back, received the news. Her face was a little pale as she flew over.

When she saw the situation on the stage, she was also filled with shock!

Mu Li Yin ‘er’s parents and brother were also filled with shock and disbelief.

The youth on the stage was their grandson? Nephew?
