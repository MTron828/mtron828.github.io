“Hehe, I believe in brother Wang Xian. In the future, brother Wang Xian will definitely be the top existence in our sword and Magic Universe! ”

Long Yinhao said with a smile on his face!

“Oh right, yinhao, does Saintess flowing moon know that you have fallen? Yinhao, do you know the specific reason for your death?”

Long Yinyin asked him!

“Liuyue already knows. She said that she would rush over. As for the specific reason for my death, I only have a rough guess. ”nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

When Long Yinhao heard this, the smile on his face disappeared as he spoke!

“What reason? Is it because of Saintess Liuyue?”

Wang Xian asked directly!

Long Yinhao was silent for a moment before he nodded slightly. “It should be.

It should be the flowing water hailian of the Flowing Water Forbidden Ground! ”

“Flowing water connection? The grandson of the current owner of the flowing water forbidden ground, flowing water connection?”

Long Yinhao’s expression changed slightly when he heard that and asked.

Long Yinhao nodded his head slightly!

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows slightly when he heard that!

It was related to the grandson of the flowing water forbidden ground?

As for the reason behind it, they could guess it without long Yinhao’s explanation.

It was nothing more than jealousy.

It was nothing more than the fact that he was together with Saintess Liuyue, which made some people jealous!

It even involved the grandson of the Master of the Liushui Forbidden Land!

No wonder the experts of the dragon roar forbidden land couldn’t do anything about it!

“I didn’t tell Liuyue, sister, and you shouldn’t tell her when the time comes!”

Long Yinhao reminded long yinyin!

km-IOW!

Long yinyin frowned and nodded her head!

Her face was also filled with helplessness!

Wang Xian didn’t say too much. After chatting with long Yinhao for a while, they left!

Long yinyin’s family members were also feeling a little heavy-hearted.

They greeted Wang Xian briefly.

“We’ll wait for more than a month. I’ll take care of Yinhao’s matter.

Coincidentally, Pll take care of the previous matters as well. ”

Wang Xian and long yinyin came to the waterfall of the Heaven Peak and spoke to him!

“Eh? Brother Wang Xian, how… how are you going to take care of it? What were your previous matters?”

Long Yinyin looked at Wang Xian in astonishment and asked.

“The reason why I chose to seclude myself in seclusion for the past few hundred million years is because I was attacked in the abyss of Demonic

Beasts. I have already caught the attacker who was not enough. However, the subsequent matters have yet to be resolved!”

Wang Xian did not hide anything and spoke directly!

Long Yin heard him and looked at him nervously.

“Just wait. Wait for more than a month. After more than a month, you will understand!”

Wang Xian stroked her head and did not tell her anything else.

More than a month later.

Wang Xian would do whoever he disliked?

And he even dared to bully his brother-in-law?

Wasn ‘t he courting death?

So what if there was a heaven’s origin creation in the flowing water forbidden land?

At that time, he really didn’t believe that the Heaven’s origin creation in the sword and magic universe would really dare to engage in a great battle with him.

If a great battle really broke out, the aftermath would cause the entire sword and magic universe to suffer heavy losses!

It could cause the death of billions of lives in the sword and Magic Universe!

At this time, they absolutely did not dare to erupt into a battle that was too strong.

Otherwise, when the calamity arrived, it would be the end of the Sword and Magic Universe!

Therefore, he was no longer afraid of the sword and Magic Universe’s Heavenly

Fate!

Together with the matter from more than 400 million years ago, it was resolved!

“What lawsuit are you trying to sell? You are so mysterious that even our dragon roar forbidden land doesn’t know your background! ”

Long Yin looked at him and couldn’t help but speak up!

“Hehe, you don’t have to worry about it anyway.”

Wang Xian smiled and said!

“Hehe, alright. Since you’ve Said So, I won’t worry about it anymore! ” Long Yin nodded with a smile.

However, just as Wang Xian was about to make his move after more than a month!

Half a month later, Saintess Liuyue suddenly arrived!

After she arrived, she immediately went to look for long yinhao!

At first, the two of them were having a good chat. However, seven days later, the situation suddenly became chaotic.

Saintess Liuyue suddenly called long yinyin over. Wang Xian was also confident that he would follow her!

“Liuyue, yinhao, what happened to you guys?”

Long yinyin noticed that both Saintess Liuyue and long yinyin looked extremely embarrassed.

She asked with slight surprise!

Sister yinyin, Pm going to take Yinhao to find those guys and make them pay for what they did! ”

Saintess Liuyue said with a frosty face!

Hearing her words, long yinyin looked at her younger brother!

“1 didn’t say anything! ”

Long Yinhao shook his head bitterly!

“If you didn’t say anything, wouldn’t I be able to find out by myself? You said that you encountered a magical beast and was killed by it. How is this possible? We have already entered and exited the seventh level of the Magical Beast

Abyss many times. ”

“I’m not a fool. How can I not know anything? What are you hiding? What are you worried about? I have some power in the flowing water forbidden land. Pm also the Holy Maiden of the Flowing Water Forbidden Land! ”

“If someone kills you, we are in the right. Even if there is no evidence, I want them to pay the price. I may not be able to do anything to some of them, but I can still make them pay the price!”

The flowing Moon Holy Maiden said with a cold expression, her face full of strength!

On the other hand, Long Yinhao, who was at the side, kept smiling bitterly!

There was no other way. Even when long Yinhao was at his peak, he was still not a match for his girlfriend.

Not to mention his background!

Having a powerful girlfriend, he was also in pain and happy!

“Sister yinyin, Pll take Yinhao to the garrison. Those guys are all there. Pll ask them to give an explanation!”

The flowing moon Saintess continued to speak to long yinyin!

“You and Yinhao can decide this flowing moon. ”

Long Yinyin opened her mouth and said.

In fact, Saintess Liuyue was much older than long yinyin.

However, because of her younger brother, she called him elder sister!

Their ages added together, they were not as old as Saintess Liuyue!

Of course, even if it was hundreds of millions of years of age difference, it was nothing in the eyes of experts at their realm.

“Alright, yinhao, come with me.”

Saintess Liuyue pulled long Yinhao and said forcefully!

She wanted to stand up for her man!

“Hehe, Yinhao has found the right girlfriend.”

Wang Xian watched from the side and said with a smile!

He didn’t expect Saintess Liuyue to be so domineering.

She treated long Yinhao very well!

Saintess flowing moon wanted to bring long Yinhao to seek an explanation! It would take half a month to get to the abyss of Demonic Beasts from here!

Coincidentally, her original body would be there by then!

When saintess flowing moon heard Wang Xian ‘s compliment, her face turned red!

Long Yinhao smiled foolishly.

Facing his domineering girlfriend, he had no way to resist and could only obey!

Can only be obedient!
