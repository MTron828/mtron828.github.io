Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

Wang Xian rode his heavy-duty motorcycle from the school. What he didn’t know was that his name had once again caused an uproar in the school forum.

A thread from Lan Qingyue had made Wang Xian’s name known throughout the University of Rivertown.

As for Wang Xian, his name had truly spread to the entire University of Rivertown. Everyone would know about him and hear about him.

He had captured the hearts of two goddesses and even made Lan Qingyue made the comment on “fair competition!” This made all the male students spit out a mouthful of blood.

Why?

Why isn’t it me whom the goddess has fallen in love with?

If I was the one, you wouldn’t have to compete with anyone!

Wang Xian’s name was even known by the new batch of year one students.

Xiao Yu was naturally thrilled to see two goddess-level beauties pursue her brother and was trying to find out more about Guan Shuqing and Lan Qingyue.

She would like to know which sister-in-law would be better.

However, what she got was the same two words: “Perfect Goddess!”

...

After riding his motorcycle to the seaside, Wang Xian walked towards the forefront of a fish farm. There was a vessel that was parking by the side.

“Dragon King!”

On the vessel, the four dragonians immediately greeted with great respect the moment they saw Wang Xian.

Mm!

Wang Xian nodded his head and boarded the vessel.

The vessel spanned approximately 40 meters. It wasn’t huge and wasn’t a luxury yacht. It was simply a shipping vessel used for transportation.

The vessel moved quickly and soon they arrived at the deserted island in the middle of the seas.

At this moment, there were over a thousand people constructing on the island.

When the construction was completed, Dragon Sect would enter the ranks of the Ancient Martial Artist Families and make its name known throughout the country. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Wang Xian alighted at the island and observed the surroundings.

“Has the Dragon Sect Platform been built?” Wang Xian asked the dragonian beside him.

“Yes, it’s completed, Dragon King!” the dragonian immediately replied.

“Mm. Great.” Wang Xian nodded his head.

Dragon Sect Platform was similar to the “Generals Conferment Platform” of ancient times. To put it simply, it would be similar to a jetty. However, this jetty wasn’t for ships to park, but for the subordinates of the Dragon Palace.

Wang Xian arrived at the location of the Dragon Sect Platform. The location was a deserted area of the island and spanned over a kilometer. It was built from concrete and extended towards the sea.

At the middle of it was a platform with three words written in ancient style: “Dragon Sect Platform”!

Wang Xian stood on it and looked to the sea.

With just a thought, he spread his dragon power towards the surroundings.

In less than two minutes, a giant clam appeared at the surface of the sea in front of the Dragon Sect Platform.

“Dragon King!”

The clam opened and Roving Girl appeared on the sea surface. Around her, the waters were circulating. She has a figure similar to a human and greeted Wang Xian.

Wang Xian nodded his head slightly and didn’t say a word.

In less than five minutes, a golden lobster-like organism surfaced from beneath the water in front of the Dragon Sect Platform.

It stood on the surface of the water and had a pair of giant golden claws that had the glow of metal.

The golden metallic exterior shimmered under the sunlight. It bowed and greeted with great respect, “Dragon King!”

It was none other than Roving Lobster of the Dragon Palace!

Wang Xian nodded his head and still didn’t say a word.

At this moment, the waters in front of the Dragon Sect Platform started moving violently and caused huge waves.

A ginormous object that spanned approximately 10 meters emerged from the seas.

“Dragon King!”

The giant animal lifted his dull-yellow head and greeted Wang Xian.

It was none other than Prime Minister Turtle of the Dragon Palace!

The three marine animals floated on the surface of the seas. Any one of them, if discovered by a human, would have caused a huge uproar.

Wang Xian stood on the Dragon Sect Platform and looked down on his three subordinates.

Prime Minister Turtle: Level 11

Art of Cultivation: Earth Dragon Transformation

Superpower: Ability to control turtle race whose level is lower than own existing level; Control Earth

Roving Lobster: Level 8

Art of Cultivation: Metal Dragon Transformation

Superpower: Ability to control lobster race whose level is lower than own existing level; Control Metal

Roving Girl: Level 9

Art of Cultivation: Water Dragon Transformation

Superpower: Ability to control clam race whose level is lower than own existing level, Control Water

“Dragon King!”

The three marine animals exchanged gazes before greeting in unison.

“Mm. Currently, the three of you are the only members of our Dragon Palace. I will require more marine animals. Besides that, I’ve got to look for material to build the Dragon Palace. Today, I’ve summoned the three of you to follow me to search the entire Bohai Sea.”

Wang Xian stood on the Dragon Sect Platform, which looked just like the “Generals Conferment Platform” of ancient times, and spoke to Prime Minister Turtle, Roving Girl and Roving Lobster. He was satisfied with their current strength.

The group had practiced Divine Dragon Transformation and their strength had increased very quickly.

The strongest, Prime Minister Turtle, had already attained the level above the Inborn state, a level above his former stage.

“Yes, Dragon King!” Roving Girl, Roving Lobster and Prime Minister Turtle answered immediately.

Hmm.

Wang Xian nodded his head. Although he had only three subordinates at this moment, he hoped that there would be a day where he stood on the Dragon Sect Platform in front of tens of millions of Dragon Palace members. He also believed that the day would come sooner than later.

“Let’s go!”

Wang Xian jumped into the skies and turned into a five-colored divine dragon.

Growl!

A soft dragon roar propagated through the atmosphere. The five-meters long Wang Xian dove into the seas directly.

Swaying his body, he led the group.

Roving Girl and Roving Lobster immediately swam to his left and right while Prime Minister Turtle stayed behind Wang Xian.

“Dragon King!” At this moment, Prime Minister Turtle remarked.

“What’s the matter?” Wang Xian looked at Prime Minister Turtle with doubt.

“Dragon King, if you are looking to get more subordinates, I know of such a place.”

Prime Minister Turtle spoke slowly after thinking about the matter.

“Oh? Where would that be? What kind of marine animals are there?” Wang Xian asked Prime Minister Turtle inquisitively.

“A group of Water Monkeys. I remember encountering them at a location near the seas. They lived in a group, had pairs of sharp claws and were annoying!” Prime Minister Turtle replied.

“Water Monkeys?”

Wang Xian was taken aback and sank into thought.

He had heard of Water Monkeys previously. They were similar to apes and were referred to as water spirits by the civilians.

Water Monkeys looked horrifying and had hair all over their bodies. They also had tremendous brute strength.

Are the water monkeys Prime Minister Turtle has mentioned similar to those in folklore?

Wang Xian thought to himself. He turned to Prime Minister Turtle and instructed, “Lead the way!”

“Yes, Dragon King!”

Prime Minister Turtle nodded his head. He sank to the seabed and executed his Earth Control superpower.

Under the propulsion of the Earth, the speed of Prime Minister Turtle was unbelievably fast!

Roving Girl and Roving Lobster couldn’t keep up with him at all.

Prime Minister Turtle is still the more competent member. Not only has it lived for several thousands of years, but it also has a better understanding of the surroundings. Moreover, it is also stronger!

Wang Xian was very satisfied with Prime Minister Turtle. Perhaps Prime Minister Turtle could truly be competent enough to take on the responsibilities as the chamberlain of the Dragon Palace.

Bohai Sea. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Turtle, they swam approximately a hundred kilometers. Along the way, they met a few schools of small fish but Wang Xian ignored them.

“Dragon King, they are right ahead!” Prime Minister Turtle looked ahead and said.

Wang Xian turned his attention forward. This piece of sea region had complicated landforms.

The underwater mountains were closely packed.

Their peaks were also just a few meters from the surface of the water.

The entire region looked gloomy as though even sunlight couldn’t shine through.

Wang Xian jerked his head and looked to his right.

In that direction, there was an emaciated organism of approximately 1.5 meters which had red eyes. It stood at the peak of one of the mountains and was staring at them!
