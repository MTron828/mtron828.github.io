“The earth star fish is very difficult to catch. How could they catch four of them directly? Moreover, it seems that the earth star fish swam towards them on its own initiative!” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Did you hear that strange sound just now? It should have been attracted by the sound. I really didn’t expect that our immortal sect hadn’t found a way to attract the earth star fish for thousands of years, and it was actually found by someone else!”

“That little girl is very strong. Report this to senior sister and the rest!”

The two female disciples of the Fengyan Celestial sect flew towards the celestial sect with an embarrassed expression.

...

“Looks like she is destined to attract a lot of attention!”

Tang Yinxuan smiled at Wang Xian when she saw the two female disciples of the Fengyan Celestial sect leaving.

“It’s alright. We are here to capture us. Don’t bother about the others!”

Wang Xian shook his head nonchalantly.

“Alright!”

Tang Yinxuan nodded her head. She knew Wang Xian’s strength and influence. Naturally, she wouldn’t be worried.

On the beach in the east of the mysterious sea, there was only one small town near the sea that was relatively lively.

Basically, all the martial artists who entered the mysterious sea had to pass by this place. Even Wang Xian, who was riding on the airship of the natural born celestial sect, had to land near this place!

Boom

A rumbling sound was suddenly heard. The Terrifying Thunder Beast, which was emitting lightning, landed heavily on the beach.

The Thunder Beast was about three meters in size. It had a single horn on its head and its body was emitting a terrifying aura.

On top of the Thunder Beast, a young man was sitting on it.

The young man had a towering horn on his head and his eyes were like torches. The white-blue glow on his body was flickering with lightning.

Beside him, there was a lightning spear hanging. His entire person was like a god from the myths.

“Young clan leader, Miss Tang is in the mysterious sea!”

Beside the young man with the Lightning Beast, there were more than ten young men beside him as they spoke to him.

“En, no wonder I couldn’t find her. So she’s in the mysterious sea. Hehe, you can’t escape from my palm!”

The corners of the young man’s mouth curled up slightly, and an intense confidence appeared on his face.

“Young clan leader!”

A young man hesitated for a moment before continuing, “Young clan leader, there’s another young man beside Miss Tang!”

“En?”

“Crackle crackle!”

The young man’s gaze turned slightly cold, and the sound of thunder and lightning came from his body. He wasn’t angry, but he was imposing.

“A young man? Good, good. I want to see who dares to snatch a beauty from me. What qualifications does he have to compete with me!”

The young man raised his head slightly, his eyes revealing a cold expression. With a slight movement of his legs, the Thunder Beast directly soared towards the direction of the mysterious sea.

Not far away, the crowd looked at the young man with reverence in their eyes.

Some disciples from other immortal sects also stared at the young man’s back with solemn expressions.

In the pugilistic world, there were supreme beauties and there were also Heaven’s chosen rankings.

The Heaven’s pride roll didn’t have a specific ranking for the time being. Those on it were all the most outstanding disciples of the twenty immortal sects.

There were twenty people in total. Among them, the young clan leader of the Thunder clan was on the Heaven’s pride roll.

However, in the other seat, a group of disciples from the Wind Smoke Immortal sect also flew into the mysterious sea.

In the center seat was an extremely beautiful woman whose dress was at least two to three meters long. There was a red dot between the woman’s brows. Her entire body emitted a transcendent aura.

“Someone actually managed to attract the terrestrial star fish through a special method. How interesting!”

A smile appeared on the woman’s face. This smile was like a blossoming flower that could topple a nation.

...

“This is already the fourth wave of people that we chased away!”

The special sound waves were able to attract the terrestrial star fish to swim over. Although the mysterious sea was very large, it covered a radius of a hundred miles.

However, it was not huge for the strong ones, especially since Tang Yinxuan’s sound waves could cover a circumference of 10 kilometers.

After chasing away more than a dozen people who had come over, Tang Yinxuan continued with a little helplessness, “It might not be long before the entire mysterious sea knows that we can capture the terrestrial star fish through special methods!”

“It’s Alright, let’s continue!”

Wang Xian smiled and shook his head. He looked at the two terrestrial star fish in his hands and said, “Let’s cook one at night to taste it!”

“Cook? You’re really extravagant. This terrestrial star fish is equivalent to a grade-6 medicinal pill!”

Tang Yinxuan looked at him with a smile.

Wang Xian also smiled. If he were to consume this terrestrial star fish, he would only be able to absorb 70,000 to 80,000 dragon energy. To him, this was a drop in the bucket.

“Clap Clap Clap!”

At this moment, the sound of heavy hooves could be heard.

“Eh?”

Tang Yinxuan was about to play the guqin when she heard the sound. She immediately turned her head and saw the Thunder beasts that were charging towards them. Her expression was a little ugly.

“What’s wrong? Do you know them?”

Wang Xian turned his head and asked Tang Yinxuan.

“Yes, the young chief of the Thunder clan. That Annoying Fellow!”

Tang Yinxuan nodded.

“Miss Tang, I’ve been looking for you for so long!”

The Thunder Beast arrived at a spot ten meters in front of Tang Yinxuan at a terrifying speed. The young man sitting on it looked at Tang Yinxuan with a warm smile on his face.

“I’m not familiar with the young clan leader of the Thunder clan. Why are you looking for me?”

Tang Yinxuan looked at the young man and the people beside him and said calmly.

“Naturally, it’s to pursue the lady and make Miss Tang my person, Haha!”

The young man laughed loudly and said without any concealment in his words. He stared at Tang Yinxuan as if he regarded her as his own private property.

“Young clan leader Lei is such an insolent person, it’s really annoying!”

Tang Yinxuan also said coldly.

“Haha, Insolent? Only those who have the ability are qualified to be insolent. Miss Tang is so outstanding, a man who is worthy of the lady, there’s no one else but me!”

The young man did not show the slightest bit of anger when he heard Tang Yinxuan’s words. He looked at her with a face full of confidence and arrogance.

“Eh, I didn’t expect young clan leader Lei to be here!”

At this moment, a light voice came from not far away. More than twenty women were like fairies in the ocean, flying towards them in a light dance.

“City-toppling Beauty!”

Young clan leader Lei narrowed his eyes slightly and looked at the people behind him. “Why are the beauties from the Wind Smoke Immortal sect here?”

“Aren’t you here for that?”

Cheng Qingcheng, whose skirt was half a meter long, said lightly with a smile on her face.

“That? You Mean?”

The young man’s eyes sparkled. “The matter of the Earth Star Fish!”

Cheng Qingcheng shifted her gaze away from the young man and landed on Wang Xian and Tang Yinxuan. A hint of surprise flashed across her eyes.

“Our Fengyan Celestial sect, the Thunder clan, and the Ji clan have not found a way to attract the earth star fish for a thousand years. I didn’t expect this lady to actually find a way!”

“It’s just a small trick!”

Tang Yinxuan looked at Cheng Qingcheng and the others in surprise and said calmly.

“Since it’s a small trick, can you tell us about it? We’ll give you some benefits!”

Cheng Qingcheng continued to speak to Tang Yinxuan with a smile on her face.

“Other than me, no one else can learn it!”

A hint of confidence appeared on Tang Yinxuan’s face.
