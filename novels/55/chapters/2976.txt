Chapter 2977: Becoming a Dragon Knight in 1977? 3

The creator had arrived at the eight desolation six directions a month ago.

He was a robot himself and possessed powerful computational and analytical abilities. He also possessed strong investigative abilities. After entering the eight desolation six directions, he relied on his powerful computational and analytical abilities, in a month’s time, he found a weak spot and arrived at the other side of the eight desolation six directions, the center of the universe.

However, they didn’t know if he was lucky or unlucky. He just happened to meet a four-armed race expert who was leading his disciples to train.

The creator who came out from the eight desolation six harmonies was immediately discovered and captured by them.

They were naturally very curious about the robots that suddenly flew out from the Mohan clan’s ruins.

Under interrogation, the creator analyzed and calculated and told everything to everyone in the four-armed race.

When the four-armed race found out that the creator came from the void behind the Mohan clan ruins and that there was a divine dragon in the starry sky, their reaction was the same as the two people from the three-eyed race, they were filled with excitement and passion.

That was a divine dragon!

A peak existence in the universe, a divine dragon!

Then, they immediately asked the creator to bring them through this place.

When the creator saw this situation, he immediately asked the four-armed race to help him destroy the Dragon Palace.

The four-armed race didn’t hesitate and immediately agreed.

“Lord Qian, there’s a base not too far ahead of the Dragon Palace. Let’s Go There First!”

The creator looked at the old man leading the four-armed race and said.

“Okay, lead the way!”

The four-armed old man looked around and said immediately.

“Yes!”

The creator nodded and flew forward.

“Is this the starry sky behind the Mohan Clan? The Spiritual Qi here is weak!”

“Although the Mohan clan was destroyed, they still have many arrays. Many arrays absorb the spiritual Qi in this starry sky, so there is less spiritual Qi here!”

“Dragon God, look at the picture. It looks like a pure-bred wind dragon God. If there are many dragon gods, even some sub-dragons can capture them as mounts. It would be very satisfying!”

“Hahaha, we can forget about it, but it shouldn’t be a problem for us to become Dragon Knights at the last minute.”

“I hope there are more dragon gods in the Dragon Palace. In that case, our four-armed race will have a high chance of rising!”

Behind them, over 10,000 disciples of the four arm race were discussing excitedly.

They surveyed their surroundings, excited.

They had never expected to encounter such a situation during their training.

They were the elite members of the four arm race, 10,000 of them. The weakest was an undying king level 8, while the strongest was a pinnacle undying king.

The 15 emperors in front, the elder in the center, the 4 armed race deacon, had the strength of an emperor level 5.

“If there are more dragons in the Dragon Palace, we can keep them in captivity, even the Yalong can be sold for a good price, this is a good chance for our four armed race to rise!”

“According to the information from the creation, the Dragon Palace must have received a powerful inheritance from the Dragon God, otherwise they wouldn’t have grown so quickly, I wonder what their luck is?”

“Is it possible that it’s the corpse of a powerful pure-blooded divine dragon?”

In front of them, the four-armed race’s divine emperors couldn’t help but open their mouths to discuss.

The great opportunity was right in front of them. It was possible that their four-armed race had a chance to rise to the next level and step into the race’s ranks!

The group of four-armed race’s experts quickly flew towards the nearest branch dragon palace.

When they rushed over, it was located in the current eight barrens and six directions. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

The eight barrens and the base had been taken away by the sky array to build the Dragon Cave. The Dragon Palace now had five dragon palaces in the eight barrens and six directions.

They were located on five planets, which were also the five most prosperous planets in the eight barrens and six directions.

The planets were now under the management of the experts of the dragon and Phoenix Divine Dynasty.

And in front of the most prosperous planet in the deepest part of the planet, a huge divine kingdom was rapidly flying towards this planet.

“Sirs, on the planet in front of us, there is a base of the Dragon Palace. That was once the territory of our eight desolate, but now it has been occupied by the Dragon Palace!”

In the void divine kingdom, the desolate god Emperor stared at the prosperous planet in front of him, and his eyes were filled with coldness as he said to Yang Feng and Yang Xiaohun.

“Oh?”

Yang Feng raised his brows. His vertical eyes flashed with light as he scanned the planet.

“It’s really weak!”

His gaze swept across the planet. There was only one God Emperor on the planet. This caused him to reveal a smile and a disdainful expression.

“Let’s go directly!”

Yang Xiaohun, who was by the side, also revealed a smile as he said indifferently.

“Boom!”

The desolate god Emperor’s eyes revealed a wanton and excited expression. His huge divine kingdom sped up and flew directly towards the sky above the planet.

At the same time, a vast and mighty force charged towards the planet below.

“What’s going on?”

“That’s the divine kingdom? What a huge force. who dares to cause trouble on our nine Void Planet?”

“Which God Emperor is actually so unbridled!”

When the Void Divine Kingdom’s power surged towards the planet without any concealment, everyone’s pupils constricted and they looked up in shock.

However, there was no fear on their faces.

Now that the Dragon Palace was the king of the entire resplendent starry sky, no one dared to cause trouble in the resplendent starry sky, even if the other party was a god Emperor.

“Which God Emperor is actually releasing such pressure on our nine Void Planet?”

In a luxurious palace on the planet, the dragon and Phoenix God dynasty’s expert in charge of this planet flew up into the sky.

He stared at the divine kingdom in the sky and frowned slightly.

“Hehe, has someone already forgotten that the nine destruction planet is our eight desolates’territory?”

A group of God emperors slowly flew out from the divine kingdom. The desolate god Emperor stared at the planet’s manager below and asked coldly.

“Eight desolation?”

The manager of the nine obliteration planet was slightly stunned, and then a stunned expression appeared on his face.

“What? Eight Desolation’s Celestial Emperor? They… didn’t they run away because they were afraid of the strength of the Dragon Palace? Why are they back now?”

“Eight desolation’s Celestial Emperor is back? What do they want to Do?”

When everyone on the planet heard this, their faces were filled with astonishment.

Back then, eight desolation wanted to join forces with the imperial court to destroy the Dragon Palace. In the end, the Dragon Palace took action in advance and directly destroyed the imperial court and the imperial court. Eight desolation divine emperor was so scared that he led all his disciples to escape. He did not expect to return now.

Were they not afraid of the Dragon Palace?

“Eight desolation divine emperor? Why Are You Back?”

The expression of the manager of nine destruction planet changed slightly. He stared at the divine emperor who was floating in the sky and asked vigilantly.

“Hahaha, why are you asking us? The eight desolates and six harmonies belong to our eight desolates’territory. Why else would we come here?”

“It seems that some people have been presumptuous when we left. They don’t know whether they are dead or alive. Since they don’t know, then they should die!”

A celestial thearch from the eight desolates let out a maniacal laugh. He stared at the manager of the nine destruction planet and moved.

“Boom!”

In the next moment, he instantly appeared beside the planet’s manager. His palm, which contained a terrifying amount of energy, directly attacked him.
