“Thank you, sir. I am one of the sect leaders of the natural born celestial sect. May I know where you come from? What brings you to our natural born celestial sect?”

The Queen of Flowers swept her gaze across the ice god Celestial sect and the girl from her own sect and expressed her gratitude to Wang Xian.

The girl was not crippled. She would be able to recover after a few months of recuperation.

This showed that this immortal was doing this on purpose for his own sake. Secondly, he must have something to do at the innate immortal sect!

“I’m from the Dragon Gate. Sorry to bother you. I do have something to do at the innate immortal sect. I’m here to ask for a medicine!”

Wang Xian nodded to the flower queen and said truthfully.

He did indeed have something to ask of her, so he didn’t go too far.

“Oh? Dragon Gate?”

A hint of surprise flashed across the Flower Queen’s eyes. He had never heard of Dragon Gate, and it wasn’t one of the twenty immortal gates.

“Sir, please come in!”

No matter what, the other party was a middle-level immortal. She was worthy of taking him seriously. She invited Wang Xian in.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded and followed him into the inner area of the innate immortal gate.

Behind him, everyone was staring at his back in shock. Their eyes were still filled with disbelief.

The entire natural born celestial sect was in a world of plants. There were all kinds of trees, vines, and flowers.

Apart from the roads, the rest of the places were basically filled with plants.

Here, wood element cultivators could improve greatly when they fought.

The disciples of the natural born celestial sect lived on the wooden houses on the trees. Houses were built on the huge trees, giving people a natural feeling.

After passing through an area covered by rattan orchids, the Queen of Flowers brought Wang Xian to the central area.

Behind them, flower fairy carried Gu Ji and followed behind them. She sized up Wang Xian with a curious look on her face. Her mind was full of thoughts.

She was thinking about how old Wang Xian was this year?

What kind of force was Dragon Gate?

She was filled with curiosity towards him and a series of questions.

“Sir, please take a seat. Flower Fairy, pour some tea!”

Flower Fairy said directly to flower fairy.

“Yes, Master!”

Flower fairy nodded and immediately poured a cup of tea for Wang Xian.

“I am the Dragon King of the Dragon Gate. Wang Xian, sorry to disturb the sect leader of the Flower Queen!”

The other party greeted her politely. Wang Xian also cupped his hands at her.

“The main reason why I came to the innate immortal sect this time is to request for a type of spiritual herb!”

Wang Xian went straight to the point and said to the flower queen.

“Sir Wang Xian, what kind of spiritual herb are you looking for? If our innate immortal sect has it, we will definitely not be stingy!”

The Queen of Flowers asked Wang Xian.

“A spiritual herb that can strengthen one’s soul!”

Wang Xian stared at the Queen of flowers and said with some anticipation.

“Strengthen one’s soul?”

The Queen of Flowers was stunned for a moment and frowned slightly. “Things that touch one’s soul are very rare. The Hundred Flowers Liquid is an item that can help one recover one’s soul. If you say it’s a spiritual herb of a higher grade than the hundred flowers liquid!”

As the Flower Queen spoke, she looked at Gu Ji, who was at the side. “We do have a spiritual herb here. It’s called the wood spirit fruit. It’s a grade-8 spiritual fruit!”

“Really?”

Wang Xian’s eyes revealed a hint of surprise. “May I know how the Flower Queen can exchange it?”

“The wood spirit fruit is a very special fruit. Sir Wang Xian, the Ice Soul Stone contains your lover. Let me take a look at it for you. Our natural born celestial sect is not inferior to the Holy Doctor Celestial sect in terms of treatment!”

The flower queen said to Wang Xian as her gaze landed on the ice soul stone behind Wang Xian.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded and opened up all the Ice Soul Stones!

“Fire attribute!”

“What a terrifying flame!”

In an instant, the flower queen looked at Guan Shuqing who was inside the ice soul stone with a look of surprise.

A green glow entered her body with a movement of her arm. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“The body is fine but full of vitality. The energy in the body is somewhat chaotic and out of control. There is only one kind of situation.”

The flower queen frowned slightly and spoke slowly, “I suddenly received a terrifying power, but this power far exceeds the burden of the body, making it impossible for people to control it. It is to the extent that I can not control my body, and I can not even support myself to move!”

“It’s indeed because of my soul. I want to heal the spiritual herbs or elixirs that strengthen my soul!”

Wang Xian nodded his head slowly when he heard the queen of Flowers’diagnosis.

“We don’t have many wood spirit fruits here. I’m not sure if it can wake up my lover!”

The Queen of Flowers said to Wang Xian.

“I want as much as you have. You can tell me what you want in exchange!”

Wang Xian said to the flower queen in pleasant surprise.

“Flower Queen, a distinguished guest from the Holy Medicine Immortal Sect of the Holy Medicine Immortal sect is here. Come here for a moment!”

At this moment, a voice was suddenly heard. The flower queen, who was sitting at the side, was slightly surprised.

“Yes, Grand Elder!”

The flower queen immediately responded. She turned her head to look at Wang Xian and said, “Sir Wang Xian, the Holy Medicine Immortal sect and the Holy Medicine Immortal sect are here. They are also very good at this aspect. It’s a good opportunity for us to take a look.”

“Flower Queen, do you have a good relationship with the celestial sect of Holy Medicine and the Celestial sect of Holy Medicine?”

Wang Xian frowned slightly.

“Our relationship is quite normal. However, the celestial sect of Holy Medicine and the Celestial sect of Holy Medicine Want to cooperate with US since we have the most spiritual herbs in the world!”

The flower queen said to Wang Xian. Looking at his expression, she hesitated for a moment before asking, “Sir Wang Xian has a grudge with them?”

“Some grudge, I guess!”

Wang Xian replied plainly, “However, it’s not a big problem!”

“Sir Wang Xian, why don’t we go over and take a look? Everyone who comes to our natural born celestial sect is a guest. The wood spirit fruit is a little special. I need to inform the great elder and the rest!”

The Queen of Flowers stood up and spoke to Wang Xian.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded his head. He stood up and followed the Queen of flowers towards the back.

The flower fairy immediately followed behind him.

“Eh?”

As he walked behind, Wang Xian could feel a strong wood-elemental energy.

The energy was majestic and full of vitality.

If an ordinary person stayed here, he could even increase his lifespan by a few decades.

He looked at the source of the energy. His eyes were twinkling as he stared at a tree in front of him.

The Vimala Tree: ? ? ?

Activating the plant intelligence!

“It’s another special divine tree. Moreover, it’s different from the endless wood soul-returning tree with only one branch. This vimala tree is a complete tree!”

Wang Xian sized up the Vimala tree with a twinkle in his eyes.

The tree was not very tall. It was only about seven to eight meters tall and its branches were not very lush.

And now, half of the tree was dark green, and the other half was withered, as if it was malnourished.

It would not take long for the tree to completely wither, turning into a tree trunk like a soul-returning tree.

Next to the tree, eight people were sitting at a wooden table.

All of them were middle-aged elders, and they had a dignified expression on their bodies.

All of them were immortals, and all eight of them were immortals.

And at the side stood more than a dozen disciples!
