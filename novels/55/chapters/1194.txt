Chapter 1195: 1196, stay here

Translator: 5496903

For many people, the bloodline of a fierce beast or demon beast was like a treasure.

However, in the eyes of some outstanding disciples, bloodline cultivators were not enough.

This was because the bloodline had a limit. For example, if one had the bloodline of a demon beast at the profound void tier, they could only cultivate to the profound void tier at most.

In the eyes of many people, an expert of the first level of the profound void tier was only within reach. However, in the eyes of these proud children, it was nothing more than this.

This was because they pursued a higher realm.

“I wonder how he received the invitation from the second Prince?”

The girl called Sa Sa looked ahead and said with a smile.

“It’s very normal for him to be invited with his strength. However, he should be out of luck. The second prince will not blame Yin Xianfeng and the others of the six elements sect for the sake of a bloodline warrior!”

Xu Wenling said lightly.

“Hehe, the other princes of the Light Dragon dynasty are trying to rope in Yin Xianfeng. The second Prince’s main target today is not only Yin Xianfeng, but also big brother Xu Wenling. Also, judging from the second Prince’s attitude just now, he wants to rope in you!”

The young man at the side said with some flattery.

Xu Wenling smiled proudly and slightly raised his head, “I’m looking forward to the strength the second prince will show next!”

As he spoke, he took a small sip and looked at everyone in the banquet hall with a smile.

As a heaven’s pride expert who ranked higher than Yin Xianfeng on the prodigy roll, he was one of the most outstanding disciples of the Divine Wind Academy.

His family background was not very good, but it was precisely because of this that he was the object of contention among all the major factions.

At this banquet, the second prince clearly valued him the most.

Sitting here, he had a feeling that he was watching the storm with a smile.

“You want me to stay here?”

In the banquet hall, Wang Xian sat there and watched the people from the six elements sect staring at him coldly. A hint of killing intent flashed in his eyes.

By leaving him here, it meant that they clearly had an opinion and wanted to kill him.

“With just you guys, you don’t have the ability!”

Wang Xian stood up abruptly and looked at all of them.

“Haha, Brat, you still dare to be so arrogant even now. Let me tell you, in the territory of our six elements sect, you won’t be able to escape even if you have wings. In the dragon-phoenix Royal City, you dared to chase us out. Today, I will make you pay the price!”

A young man pointed his finger at Wang Xian. His eyes were filled with killing intent.

The moment he stretched out his hand and pointed at Wang Xian, he started to move.

He waved his arm and a stream of water shot towards the eight people in front of him.

“You still dare to make a move? !”

When Xing Tian saw Wang Xian making a move instantly, he revealed an embarrassed expression.

“Not good!”

However, as they felt the terrifying impact of the stream of water in front of them, the expressions of Xing Tian and the rest changed drastically.

“Be careful, his strength should be at the half-step void interpretation realm!”

A young man shouted loudly when he recalled how Wang Xian had instantly killed a level nine Hulei leopard in dragon-phoenix royal city.

The few of them trembled and hurriedly defended themselves.

However, it was too late!

The water currents struck the eight of them. Their defenses were like thin paper and were easily broken through.

A powerful force directly crashed into his body.

“Peng Peng Peng!”

“Pu Pu!”

In an instant, the eight people spat out blood and flew backward.

“What? This young man is so powerful!”

“He dares to directly attack the second Prince’s banquet. This young man is too arrogant!”

“He directly injured a disciple of the six element sect. is he going to make an enemy out of the six element sect?”

Everyone around was slightly shocked as they looked over in astonishment.

“Pa!”

At this moment, Yin Xianfeng, who was sitting at the side, had a slight change in expression. His eyes turned cold instantly.

His hand landed heavily on the table. A silver-white longsword appeared in his hand.

“Hua!”

The sound of a sharp sword being unsheathed rang out. The sharp longsword slashed towards Wang Xian’s position.

“You’re courting death!”

His eyes revealed an icy look. The temperature around him instantly dropped by dozens of degrees.

An extremely cold longsword stabbed directly at him.

“You’re the ones who are courting death!”

Wang Xian watched the longsword coming at him. His expression didn’t change as he waved his arm gently.

“Bang!”

The cold glow of the longsword melted immediately. Wang Xian waved his arm again.

A golden stream of light swept directly at his arm.

“Go to hell!”

When Yin Xianfeng saw that Wang Xian easily blocked his attack, his pupils constricted slightly and his aura trembled.

Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack

The sound of cracking could be heard from the surroundings. On the table, one cup after another was shattered by the bone-piercing cold air, producing a crisp sound.

The surrounding ground slowly turned snow-white.

“Retreat, get out of their battle range!”

“Hiss, that young man’s strength is so strong. He should be at the half-step void interpretation realm!”

“That young man is so arrogant. This villa is the property of the six element sect. There are experts from the six element sect here. If he dares to attack Yin Xianfeng and the rest here, isn’t he courting death?”

“The second prince is trying to rope in Yin Xianfeng. Even if that young man was invited by the second prince, given the current situation, the second prince will definitely stand on the side of the six element sect. After all, if he helps that young man, it would be a bad relationship with the six element sect!”

When the people around saw Wang Xian making a move, they were astonished. Those who were close to him quickly retreated into the distance.

“You dare to fight with me, Yin Xianfeng. You Dare to make a move in the territory of our six element sect. Today, I, Yin Xianfeng, will definitely kill you!”

When Yin Xianfeng saw the beam of golden light that was attacking him, a fierce glint flashed in his eyes.

He waved the longsword in his hand. The air around him seemed to have solidified as a faint white glow rose out of thin air. It was like a silver-white longsword that could penetrate through everything as it slashed towards the golden light.

“HMPH!”

Wang Xian looked at Yin Xianfeng’s attack with a hint of disdain in his eyes.

The golden light was a combination attack. The golden flow could be compared to his single-attribute attack and his ordinary attack in the form of the Divine Dragon.

If Yin Xianfeng did not use his divine ability to resist, he would be courting death.

Crack! Crack! Crack

The silvery-white longsword that was accompanied by an icy glow slashed onto the golden flow. Suddenly, the surrounding ice emitted a cracking sound. The golden glow swept towards him.

“What?”

Yin Xianfeng was slightly shocked. His expression changed drastically. His entire body trembled as layers of ice armor covered his body.

“Extremely hot water sea!”

Wang Xian saw his defense and waved his arm. A wave of seawater that was emitting a terrifying high temperature landed on Yin Xianfeng’s body faster than the golden current.

“Ah!”

The moment the extremely hot water sea landed on his body, Yin Xianfeng let out a scream.

The ice armor on his body melted at a terrifying speed.

The golden current landed on his arm that was holding the longsword.

The golden stream and the fire and metal elements combined to attack. A stream of light contained a terrifying attack.

When the Golden Stream swept past, Yin Xianfeng’s arm disappeared.
