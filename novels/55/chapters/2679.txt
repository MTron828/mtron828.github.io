2680 2680? Get Down

“All factions, get ready!”

In front of the abyssal seed, 500 to 600 million people stared ahead coldly.

Each of them exuded a strong fighting spirit.

Unlike the previous battles, this time, all the experts and disciples’eyes lit up.

The alliance of the entire Demon Island faction made this battle without the slightest suspense.

Now, all the experts and disciples wanted to kill more abyssal seeds and obtain the crystals of the abyssal seeds.

When the order came from the center, all the experts and disciples of the forces immediately got ready.

“Attack, kill these bastards!”

“Kill!”

The order to attack sounded from the center of the battlefield.

“Hahaha, Kill, kill them!”

“All Disciples, Kill, kill all the abyssal seeds. Kill!” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The leaders of the factions immediately shouted loudly.

“Let’s Go!”

On the Dragon Peak, Wang Xian also shouted softly. The huge dragon peak immediately operated and charged towards the abyssal seeds in front of them.

“All members of the Heaven’s Eye Arrow Division, Get Ready!”

Wang Xian shouted softly and stared at the area of the Dragon Palace that spanned over a hundred million kilometers.

In this area, there were about seven to eight million abyss seeds, two level 9 and 12 level 8 ones.

With the strength of the Dragon Palace, destroying them would be a piece of cake.

“This is like having more wolves and less meat.”

“Even though there are more abyss seeds in the central region, we, the world’s end and the nine heavens, will be dealing with them together. We won’t be able to get many abyss seeds!”

“Elder Hua, the few of US will deal with the Undying Level 8 abyss seeds, we’ll split them equally.”

And in the center, the disciples from Tian Ya and Jiu Xiao also charged into the abyss.

Some of the Warriors and disciples who were filled with fighting spirit saw this scene and frowned slightly, saying helplessly.

The two powers had the power to crush the entire Abyss race.

“Elder, there are too many of us here, if we want to split some of the Undying Level 8 seeds, we’ll have to split it amongst ourselves!”

In front of them, a group of warriors locked onto the seeds.

At the edge, a world margin deacon said helplessly.

If even the elders were going to split it equally, it would be even harder for them to gain more.

“That’s true, but there’s nothing we can do.”

Elder Tianya shook his head as he stared ahead, “Let’s do it. Although we’re stronger, we still have to fight for a while.”

“Elder, we can easily kill the abyssal seeds here. Why don’t we go to the side and kill a few rank 8 abyssal seeds? We’ll gain more than here.”

As soon as elder Tian Ya finished his words, a deacon raised his eyebrows and suggested.

“What?”

Elder Tian Ya paused and his eyes flickered, “The area next to us is where the great sect fought with the Dragon Palace last month.”

“It’s the Dragon Palace. Their Dragon Peak is right next to us. Elder, the Dragon Palace came here empty-handed. What can they say if we go and help them?”

The deacon said in a low voice.

“Moreover, Elder, we only killed a few level eight abyssal seeds. The Dragon Palace can’t do anything to us.”

He continued to speak.

This made elder Tianya’s mind move slightly.

“Let’s go.”

When he glanced at the situation here, his body moved and he immediately flew to the left.

“Let’s go. We’ll follow the Elder.”

The deacon waved to the group behind him, excitedly following behind.

“Haha, following the Elder, we don’t need too many abyss seeds, just two or three undying level 6 crystals will be enough!”

“I’ll be satisfied with just one level 5 crystal.”

“Absolutely, we have 50 to 60 people, helping them kill some abyss seeds would be considered helpful, and at most 100 or so, what can they say? There’s no problem at all.”

In an instant, 50 to 60 people immediately followed behind the Elder, excitedly flying to the left.

Here, each of them could at most get the crystals of the abyss seeds that were 2 levels lower than them, however if they followed the elder to the right, getting two crystals that were 1 level lower than them wouldn’t be a problem at all.

And with the elder here, they had nothing to worry about.

After all, the elder of the World Margin Sect was an undying level 9 being.

The strongest warrior of the Dragon Palace was only level 9. With the power of the world margin, even if he helped them kill some of the abyss seeds, they wouldn’t dare to say anything.

The battle had already started, in order to increase their strength, so what if they did so?

...

The path of the strong was the path they had to fight for.

“Aunt? Them?”

Around them, some people saw them flying towards the left and were slightly confused, however they didn’t follow rashly.

After all, they had an elder leading them.

“Sou Sou Sou!”

“Sou Sou Sou!”

Just as they passed, they heard the sound of arrows piercing through the air.

Following which, they saw many abyss seeds being swiftly harvested, unable to resist at all.

In fact, in front of them, a monster formed from Thorns attacked the two level 9 undying god King abyssal seeds.

“HM? This dragon palace is so powerful, it really lives up to its reputation.”

“What powerful archers! The Dragon Palace has actually nurtured so many undying god King Archers.”

...

They looked ahead, their faces filled with shock.

In front, the eyes of the world margin sect elder gleamed.

“Dragon Palace, we’ll help you.”

His body moved, his gaze locked onto an undying level 8 abyss seed, attacking.

“Let’s go, we’ll do it too!”

Behind them, the other warriors of the world margin sect also moved, swiftly heading towards the abyss seed.

Their eyes were filled with excitement.

As long as they killed a few of them, their harvest would be much greater than if they were in the middle.

“Huh?”

At this moment, Wang Xian, who was on the Dragon Peak, was slightly stunned. He looked at the group of experts who were charging towards the abyssal seed in astonishment.

When his gaze landed on the elder at the front, he narrowed his eyes slightly.

“Dragon King, that’s the experts from the world margin sect. They want to snatch the abyssal seed from our side!”

Tian Chen frowned slightly and said.

He said that he would come to support them, but his actions were obviously to snatch the abyss seeds and obtain the abyss seeds’crystals.

For example, the level 8 abyss seeds’crystals were indeed worthy of a godly monarch level 9 powerhouse.

However, Wang Xian did not expect that the people from the world margin sect would be so arrogant and did not put the Dragon Palace in their eyes.

“Haha, everyone from the Dragon Palace, don’t worry. We will help you fend off more than a hundred immortal god King abyssal seeds and share some of the burden with you. You can go and hunt the other abyssal seeds!”

At this moment, the deacon who was following closely behind the elder of the world margin sect said with a loud laugh.
