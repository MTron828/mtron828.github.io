2709 2709 Venom Dragon

The Queen of the Zerg race was a high-end existence of the Zerg race. They had a terrifying ability which allowed them to parasitize other creatures.

The scariest part was that the Queen of the Zerg race would replace the scent and memory of that creature after parasitizing.

From there, she would completely become a creature that was parasitized.

This ability was extremely terrifying.

The reason why Wang Xian was able to obtain the soul-absorbing ability which had nothing to do with the Divine Dragon tribe was due to the innate ability of the queen of the Zerg tribe.

Poison nine was lucky, but it could also be said that he was unlucky. When he was absorbing the poison, he encountered the Queen of the Zerg tribe who was already dead.

When he was absorbing the poison, such a powerful existence was not absorbed by her due to some special characteristic. Instead, due to this mysterious characteristic, it corroded his body and even his mind.

However, because the queen of the insect race had already died and only had one body, this mysterious characteristic did not completely invade Poison Nine’s mind.

This caused poison nine and the dead queen of the insect race to completely merge into one, forming a special existence.

This kind of special existence was not so easy to form.

This required the characteristics of a creature like poison, plus various reasons.

In other words, it was a mutation.

Some of the mutations were weak, but some were heaven-defying.

The strength of the venom was to absorb powerful toxins. It was able to absorb the corpse of the Queen of the Bug clan and fuse with it. Furthermore, it did not die. From Wang Xian’s point of view, this fusion was heaven-defying.

However, it was best to improve this fusion.

Dragon transformation pool. The Dragon Transformation Pool of the Divine Dragon Clan did not have such heaven-defying effects in the past.

It was a heaven-defying existence formed from the fusion of the Bug clan’s bug nest technology.

“Poison Nine, go into the dragon transformation pool.”

Wang Xian looked at the dragon transformation pool. There were some spare dragon blood in it. These spare dragon blood were enough to give birth to an undying god King Level 9 combat strength.

He stayed behind to prepare for urgent needs.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Poison nine felt the enormous energy in the dragon transformation pool. Without any hesitation, he jumped in.

He didn’t have any doubts either. The dignified Dragon King of the Dragon Palace wouldn’t lie to a nobody like him.

Wang Xian stood in the magnificent dragon pool and waited quietly.

“The Queen of the Zerg race is a peak existence of the Zerg race. I wonder what kind of dragon seed will be formed when she merges with the venom.”

Wang Xian mumbled as he stood there and watched quietly.

Time passed slowly. The dragon blood in the dragon transformation pool was slowly being absorbed.

“Splash!”

“It disappeared. I feel that the thing that lingered in my mind has disappeared. Thank you, Dragon King. Thank you, Dragon King.”

Five hours later, poison nine flew out from the dragon transformation pool. He looked at his arm with an excited expression.

“There’s a change.”

At this moment, Wang Xian looked over. His eyes were sparkling.

Ding! “Congratulations on the birth of a new dragon species in the Dragon Palace, Venomous horned dragon (1/10000) .”

As expected, the system’s voice was heard.

“Venomous horned dragon. From the name, it sounds like it’s not simple.”

Wang Xian’s heart was filled with anticipation as he looked at poison nine.

Compared to the previous poison nine, the current him had undergone a huge change.

There were two additional horns on his head. This horn looked like an insect horn that was emitting a strange energy.

His head was still pitch-black. However, his appearance was similar to the dragon’s head, but it was more ferocious.

His body was humanoid and pitch-black. He looked exactly the same as before.

However, his body was like half of a liquid. It seemed like it could flow away at any time.

“Poison nine, feel your strength.”

Wang Xian said to him immediately.

“It’s the Dragon King.”

Poison nine nodded immediately. However, he had just raised his arm when a shocked expression appeared on his face.

“Dragon King, i. . . I have obtained a new ability.”

He said in a daze.

“Huh? What ability?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and asked immediately.

“Dragon King, the fusion of our Venom’s previous abilities with the poison has not changed. However, there is an additional parasite. I feel that I can parasitize into the bodies of other creatures and occupy their bodies.”

Poison nine opened his eyes wide and said.

“Parasitize?”

Wang Xian’s eyes lit up as they sparkled.

...

This was an extremely perverse ability.

Buzz

At this moment, Poison Nine’s body trembled as an extremely excited expression appeared on his face.

“Dragon King, I feel that my current strength can reach level four of the Immortal King Realm. I am clearly at level one of the Immortal King Realm.”

His incredulous voice rang out.

Level four immortal king combat strength. Even their clan leader was only at this level.

“A dragon that surpasses three levels to reach the peak of dragon species!”

Wang Xian’s eyes lit up.

“Furthermore, Dragon King, I feel that this is not my limit. I feel that as long as I absorb more powerful toxins, I will be able to fight at a higher level.”

“Can’t you feel that you are online? It is similar to the dragon wizard dragon species in the Heaven Array. It has unlimited potential.”

Wang Xian’s eyes were sparkling.

...

However, it would be difficult to upgrade such an online version, but it was enough.

“What does this 1/10,000 mean?”

Wang Xian looked at the final data of the system notification and frowned slightly.

Ding! “With the current Queen of the Bug clan and the venom mutated energy in the Dragon Palace, only 10,000 Venom horned dragons can be born.”

At this moment, the system’s reply sounded.

“The Queen of the bug clan and the venom mutated energy can not be replicated. In other words, the dragon palace can only produce 10,000 venom horned dragons in the future.”

Wang Xian mumbled. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“It’s a pity that the venom horned dragons have a strong parasitic ability. They can only produce 10,000 venom horned dragons. That’s a little too little.”

Wang Xian shook his head and looked at Poison Nine’s body.

“Mo Sha, Ba Qi, call everyone from the poison making division over.”

He sensed the location of the Ba Qi Mo Sha and his voice reached their ears directly.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

The Ba Qi Mo sha nodded immediately.

“My minions, Let’s Go and meet the Dragon King.”

They waved their hands and immediately rushed towards the dragon transformation pool.

“Dragon King, what did you call us for?”

Mo Sha walked over and said with a smile.

“There’s a new dragon seed in the Dragon Palace, the Venom Dragon. It’s very compatible with your poison making department. You guys can switch to the Venom Dragon Class!”

Wang Xian said.

“AH? Dragon King, we... We still want to switch to the Venom Dragon class.”

Mo Sha was slightly stunned and said.

“The possibility of becoming poison dragons is too low. Poison horned dragons can fight three levels above them. If you can get a poison treasure, you can also upgrade it. It’s a dragon species above the peak and has the ability to parasitise. With the current mutated energy, it can only give birth to 10,000. If you don’t change your jobs, I’ll let the rest of the members of the poison department change their jobs.”

“Coincidentally, the poisonous horned dragon was born because of poison nine. He will be in charge of this department in the future.”

Wang Xian looked at them and said plainly.

“So Powerful!”

“D * mn, Dragon King, let’s take a look around. We are determined to become the poisonous horned dragon.”

When the two of them heard Wang Xian’s words, their eyes immediately lit up as they roared.
