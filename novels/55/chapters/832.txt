Chapter 833: 0834 Dragon Palace upgrade

Translator: 549690339

In the sky above Wuwei Island, the atmosphere was extremely heavy. The two forces were emitting a terrifying aura.

Wang Xian stood on the dragon throne and stared at all of them with a domineering expression. His face revealed a cold expression.

When the gods from the Garden of Eden and Ancient Greece heard Wang Xian’s words, their faces revealed a gloomy expression.

He was already dead. What else did he want?

He was extremely powerful.

“Bang!”

Mad God’s huge hammer struck the void once again. The terrifying energy caused the waves to churn. He stared at Wang Xian with murderous intent.

“Dragon King, you killed the gods of the Garden of Eden. You are trying to start a war!”

Mad God growled in a low voice with a ferocious expression.

Wang Xian smiled and nodded. “We can fight at any time. You guys can set a time and place!”

“Arrogant. Is this the attitude of the western immortal sects today?”

On the other side, the old man who was sitting on the throne looked coldly in the direction of the Xuan Yuan clan and the Yuwen clan.

“Master of Olympus, the cause of this incident is all because of you. The Puppet Immortal sect is the Dragon King’s friend. You used an absurd reason to kill two of their immortals. That’s why today’s incident happened!”

The elder of the Yuwen clan said with a smile on his face.

“Alright, Alright. It seems like we can’t come to an agreement today!”

The elder held up the scepter beside him coldly and said with a cold expression.

“I would like to know how you guys are going to talk about this.”

Wang Xian crossed his arms and looked at all of them.

“Kill the gods of the Garden of Eden’s divine territory and give us sufficient resources as compensation. Otherwise, we will be enemies!”

As the Mad God spoke, the black warhorse raised its front hooves and looked like it was about to attack.

“What wishful thinking. If you want to fight, then fight. If not, then get lost!”

Wang Xian laughed out loud and shouted at them directly.

“Good, good. Dragon King, our ancient Greek divine realm will remember this. There will be plenty of time in the future. All of you will pay a heavy price for this!”

The Master of Olympus stood up coldly and stared at Wang Xian.

Wang Xian did not show any signs of weakness as he swept his gaze across all of them. “If you want to start a war, I will accompany you at any time!”

“Let’s Go!”

The gods swept their gaze across Wang Xian with murderous intent. Their bodies moved and they flew into the distance.

“Dragon King, although you have vented your anger over this matter, you have to be careful in the future. The western divine territory is very powerful!”

The grand elder of the Xuan Yuan clan watched as the people from the divine realm left. He turned his head slowly and said to Wang Xian.

“Hehe, thank you for your reminder!”

Wang Xian cupped his hands.

“This time, our Eastern Immortal sect has formed a conflict with the western divine realm. The feud between the east and the west has existed for a long time. A thousand years ago, the western divine realm was defeated by our immortal sect. For more than 200 years, he had to submit to us. However, the distance between the two parties is too great. The West belongs to them. Later on, they gave birth to a powerful godly king in the west to get rid of our suppression.” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Soon after our immortal sect entered the world of the cauldron to survive, the western divine realm also established the divine realm with divine objects and entered the divine realm. The western divine realm was only born not too long ago!”

“Now, the changes in the west are even greater than ours. They directly rule the entire western world. They are gods, and ordinary people worship them!”

The supreme elder of the Yuwen clan said slowly.

“Hehe, if there is sufficient spiritual energy on earth, it might even evolve into a fantasy world!”

Wang Xian said with a smile.

The two of them nodded in agreement. If there was sufficient spiritual energy, the technological world would disappear and become a fantasy world.

“Oh right, elder Yuwen, your Yuwen clan is good at formations. I wonder if we can trade some grade-2 formations with you!”

Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled as he asked the supreme elder of the Yuwen clan.

“Formations? We do have grade-2 formations. However, the rarity of grade-2 formations is not inferior to a celestial artifact. If the Dragon King wants it, he can exchange it with a celestial artifact!”

The supreme elder of the Yuwen clan replied with a smile.

“I Want Seven Grade-2 formations. Any kind of formation with any effect is fine. I wonder if you guys have any?”

A glint flashed across Wang Xian’s eyes as he asked with a smile.

“Yes, of course. It would be even better if the Dragon King could produce an earth-type celestial artifact!”

The grand elder of the Yuwen clan said.

“Alright, we might not have seven earth-type formations. If you have the materials, I can help you refine them too!”

Wang Xian nodded his head immediately.

“Deal. The formation is located in our Yuwen clan. Please follow us, Dragon King!”

“Alright!”

Wang Xian was all smiles. He sat on the dragon throne and followed the Yuwen clan members as they flew towards the gate of immortality.

“Look, that’s the Dragon King. Oh My God, he’s so domineering!”

“Those nine dragons are immortal-level existences. Now, they are actually pulling the throne for the Dragon King!”

“The nine dragons are riding on the throne. They are simply too powerful!”

When they arrived at the Yuwen clan’s Gate of immortality, the disciples of the Yuwen clan below looked at the gigantic nine dragons in shock. Their eyes were filled with respect and admiration.

When they arrived at the Yuwen clan’s Celestial Mountain, the supreme elder of the Yuwen clan handed the seven formations to Wang Xian.

He handed over the seven immortal-level artifacts two days later.

Wang Xian sat on the dragon throne and caused a commotion once again. He flew towards the Dragon Palace.

“The ten level-2 formations have been gathered. The buildings that need to be upgraded in the Dragon Palace have been completed. With the addition of these seven formations, the Dragon Palace will be upgraded to Level-2!”

Wang Xian revealed an excited expression.

A Level-2 Dragon Palace had doubled its effectiveness. This upgrade would bring great benefits to the members of the Dragon Palace.

The cultivation speed could be doubled and reach a terrifying level.

Initially, he thought that the Yuwen clan might not agree to it due to some conflict with them. However, from the looks of it now, it was completely different from what he had imagined.

The celestial artifact was also a rare treasure for the Yuwen clan.

After arriving at the Dragon Palace, Wang Xian hovered above the dragon palace and swept his gaze downwards.
