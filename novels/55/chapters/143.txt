Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

“What?”

When Wang Xian heard his sister, he stood up immediately and stared at her in shock.

“Brother, calm down. This isn’t anything bad.”

Seeing her brother’s agitated looks, Xiao Yu explained, “This was a rather sci-fi matter. Initially, I couldn’t believe it either. However, when my master displayed unbelievable abilities, I realized that there are people who can walk on walls and injure others with just a leaf in this world. Brother, I’m going to become a heroine in the future.”

Wang Xian’s eyebrows knitted together. “What’s the name of the Sect you are joining?”

“Thistles and Thorns Sect! My master told me that our sect is very strong and is a second-class sect. Moreover, my master is incredible and is a Level 8 Martial Artist!”

Xiao Yu answered before asking curiously, “Brother, do you know about sects?”

Wang Xian nodded his head gradually.

Wang Xian had not told Xiao Yu about the matters of the underworld. Since she had joined a sect by coincidence, Wang Xian did not intend to hide further.

“Brother, you know about them too?” Xiao Yu’s eyes stared, opened wide as she looked at Wang Xian in disbelief.

“Do you think your brother’s medical hall is just any ordinary medical hall?” Wang Xian smiled and said to Xiao Yu.

Xiao Yu’s eyes popped open and looked at Wang Xian in disbelief. She then asked suddenly, “Brother, you are so bad. Why don’t you tell me about these things? Hmm! You are really bad to hide it from me. I wanted to share this matter with you once I learn about it! You... You have changed!”

Wang Xian started coughing violently upon hearing Xiao Yu. “Alright, alright. It’s your brother’s fault. I just thought that the timing wasn’t right.”

“Hmm!” Xiao Yu stared at him and was clearly displeased.

Wang Xian smiled and quickly walked in front of her. “Did your master teach you any cultivation arts?”

“Nope. Last night, my master said that I have great body constitution and talents. However, she said that I have to undergo examinations with other disciples tomorrow night before teaching us cultivation arts!” Xiao Yu answered.

“Tomorrow night? I’ll go with you tomorrow.” Wang Xian hesitated for a while before he sooke.

“Brother, you are going with me? This... This might not be acceptable!” Xiao Yu replied shyly.

“It will be fine. You can tell them I’m from the Ancient Martial Arts circle too. Moreover, since you are entering the Ancient Martial Arts circle, your master will know that you can’t hide it from your family. I don’t think she will say no,” Wang Xian said.

“Mm. Alright then, let me ask my master!” Xiao Yu nodded her head and continued, “Brother, my master is a really, really beautiful lady.”

“Is she? That’s great. If your master was a guy, I might not agree to him taking you as a disciple,” Wang Xian joked.

Xiao Yu rolled her eyes at him. “The main reason why I’m here today is to ask you something. Brother, now that you are so rich, should we buy some presents for Sister Li’s wedding. Also, shall we get some presents for Uncle Zhang?”

Hmm.

Wang Xian nodded his head. “Let me get some gifts for Uncle Zhang and Sister Li. Uncle Zhang and his family have been taking care of us. It’s about time that we repay and thank him.”

Uncle Zhang had always seen them as his own family and took great care of them

For some people, although they weren’t related by blood, their relationships were closer than those with blood ties.

Wang Xian and Xiao Yu had always remembered how Uncle Zhang had taken care of them and their grandmother.

It’s only natural for them to return this gratitude as though Uncle Zhan was their kin.

“Hmm. I’ll leave this to brother then. I’m hungry, brother. Bring me out for dinner!” Xiao Yu pulled her brother’s hands as she asked him.

“What do you want to have for dinner?” Wang Xian caressed her head and asked.

“I want to have steamboat. Why don’t we ask sister-in-law to eat with us?” Xiao Yu smiled and asked.

“Hmm. Alright. Before this, follow me to the upper story!”

Wang Xian brought Xiao Yu to the upper story and asked her to lie on the bed.

“Brother, what do you want to do?” Xiao Yu looked inquisitively at Wang Xian and asked. “I’m not sick.”

“Just lie down. Let brother examine your health.”

Wang Xian patted on her head. “I’ll make you sleep for 5 minutes in a while. Close your eyes!”

“Oh!”

Xiao Yu nodded her head and closed her eyes. She knew that what her brother was doing would be for her good.

Wang Xian tapped lightly on Xiao Yu’s body and she fell unconscious immediately.

Over the last few days, he had been reading some medical books. He understood a little about how to knock one unconscious by tapping at certain spots of the body. These small techniques were still useful for him.

Regardless of whether Thistles and Thorns Sect is good or bad, since Xiao Yu will be entering the Ancient Martial Arts circle, let me strengthen her body a little!

The reason why Xiao Yu was spotted by her master was probably because Wang Xian had strengthened her body previously.

While Wang Xian was at it, he decided to help Xiao Yu open all her meridians.

He wanted Xiao Yu to be an existence that equalled one who was favored by gods no matter where she was.

Dense dragon energy entered Xiao Yu’s body and into her meridians directly.

Xiao Yu’s body had been strengthened previously. There were almost no impurities in her body.

And now, all eight extraordinary meridians were opened.

Based on what Wang Xian knew of the Ancient Martial Arts circle, those that were born with their eight extraordinary meridians opened were known as having an Inborn constitution.

Inborn constitution only existed within the myths. There might not be even one in a hundred million people.

However, as long as one with Inborn constitution was to start cultivating, he would definitely reach the Inborn Realm.

Horrifying!

After exhausting some dragon energy to open all eight extraordinary meridians on Xiao Yu, Wang Xian tapped on her body again.

“Hmm? Brother, it’s done?”

After recovering consciousness, Xiao Yu looked at Wang Xian.

“Alright, let’s go have steamboat!”

Wang Xian smiled and went over to First-grade Restaurant to get Guan Shuqing. After which, they walked to the steamboat restaurant around the corner.

8 pm. Wang Xian sent Xiao Yu back to the dormitory before returning to the medical hall to give Old Xue a call.

“Old Xue, I have something to ask you. Do you know anything about Thistles and Thorns Sect?”

Wang Xian went straight to the point.

“Thistles and Thorns Sect?” Old Xue was taken aback slightly. “I know a little about them. They are a rather good sect within the province and could be considered as a second-class sect. Nonetheless, their actions are righteous and open and they could be considered as an orthodox sect!”

“The sect leader is a half-step to Inborn expert. I heard that there are several sects who come to Rivertown to recruit disciples recently. Did Brother Wang Xian come across them?”

“My sister was selected by a member of the Thistles and Thorns Sect. Therefore, I’m just asking around,” replied Wang Xian.

“Hmm. In that case, please give me some time. I’ll get you more detailed information,” Old Xue immediately replied.

“Alright, thank you, Old Xue.”

Wang Xian nodded his head.

In less than 10 minutes, an information file was sent to Wang Xian. Wang Xian opened it with his computer. Not only was there information on Thistles and Thorns Sect, but there was also information on other sects.
