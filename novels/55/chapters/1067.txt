Chapter 1068: 1069, a nobody?

Translator: 5496903

As the iron steeds galloped, the surrounding fierce beasts sensed their aura and fled far away.

“Haha, a good man should fight everywhere!”

“That’s right. If only I had a mount, I could ride the beasts and roam freely in the world!”

“When we enter the ocean cultivator corps, we will have a chance to get a wind wildebeest. I’m really looking forward to it!”

After a moment of silence, the young men began to talk excitedly. They were not too worried about the hunting of the ferocious beasts this time around.

They were only here to gain experience. Furthermore, with the riding wind battle team around, the possibility of them suffering casualties was very small.

“With the strength of the riding wind battle team, as long as they don’t encounter any powerful demonic beasts or ferocious beasts that are at the half-step void interpretation level, there shouldn’t be any problems!”

Wang Xian’s gaze swept across the wind riding squad beside him as he checked their strength one by one. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

There were quite a number of experts who were at extraordinary level six or seven. They were indeed worthy of being one of the three great squads in the sea cultivator corps of Donghai city.

“CHIRP CHIRP!”

The chirping of birds and beasts could be heard in the sky. Wang Xian raised his head and took a glance before driving at a high speed.

They had been driving for 30 minutes. According to their speed, they would arrive at the area of the water wolves and ferocious beasts in 10 minutes.

“CHIRP CHIRP!”

Two minutes later, the sound of birds chirping could be heard again. Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and swept his gaze across the sky.

“Huh?”

At a height of two to three thousand meters above them, two ferocious beasts with four-meter-wide wings and gray eagle-like eyes were staring at them with a burning gaze.

One of them chirped while the other one flew forward rapidly.

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly as his eyes flickered.

Two minutes ago, the cry that he heard was also from this bird beast. At that time, he took a glance and clearly remembered the size of this bird beast.

However, two minutes later, it was still following him.

There was also the other bird beast that was flying forward.

Something was wrong.

“Is it spying on US and reporting the information?”

Wang Xian was puzzled. The intelligence of Demonic Beasts was not inferior to that of humans. They also knew how to detect and counter-detect. It was not impossible for them to send a ferocious beast to monitor their surroundings!

“Teachers, the gray bird in the sky has been following us for a few minutes!”

Wang Xian looked at the four teachers at the side and said directly.

“Huh?”

Director Qian and the other four turned their heads and looked at Wang Xian in astonishment.

“Student Wang Xian, are you saying that it is monitoring us?”

One of the teachers asked in astonishment.

Wang Xian nodded his head. “It should be. There are two bird in the sky. One of them flew forward just now!”

Director Qian and the other four changed their expressions. They raised their heads and looked at the sky. “Are you sure?”

“Yes!”

Wang Xian nodded his head affirmatively. He was certain that the bird in the sky was spying on them.

“Wait a minute!”

Director Qian and the rest looked at each other. If not for the fact that they had witnessed Wang Xian’s powerful detection ability, they would not have believed his words.

Seeing the bird in the sky meant that he was spying on them?

This sounded a little unrealistic. This was because in the wilderness, it was extremely normal for there to be birds and beasts in the sky.

The four instructors increased their speed and flew towards the front.

“Director Qian, what business do you have here?”

The old man from the Ocean Academy looked at the four of them and asked with a smile.

“I have something to report to vice commander Meng!”

Director Qian said to the old man, then looked at vice commander Meng and directly called out.

“What business do you have!”

Deputy Commander Meng turned to look at the four of them and asked in a deep voice.

“Deputy Commander Meng, there’s a bird and a beast following us in the sky. We suspect that the wolf ahead is watching us!”

Director Qian and the others said directly.

“Huh?”

Deputy Commander Meng was slightly stunned. He raised his head and looked at the sky.

A gray eagle appeared in his line of sight.

“Eagle Eye, look at the Gray Eagle in the sky and see if it’s spying on us!”

Deputy Commander Meng said to a middle-aged man beside him.

“It’s deputy commander!”

The middle-aged man nodded as blue light shot out from his eyes as he looked at the sky.

“It’s a transcendent level 7 gray-winged goshawk. It’s indeed following us in the same direction. It’s hard to say if it’s spying on us!”

The middle-aged man locked his gaze on the gray-winged goshawk.

At that moment, the gray-winged goshawk seemed to sense something. Its body shook and it disappeared.

“It flew away, towards the left of us!”

The middle-aged man continued.

“Yes!”

Vice Commander Meng nodded. “We’re about to reach the location of the water wolf beast. Everyone, be careful!”

“Be Alert!”

The middle-aged man nodded and shouted softly. Everyone slowed down immediately while four to five soldiers headed forward to check out the situation.

When director Qian and the rest saw the situation, they returned to the position of the Demon Hunters Academy.

“The grey-winged goshawk has left. Deputy Captain Meng has already made his preparations!”

A teacher looked at Wang Xian and said directly.

“Left?”

Wang Xian frowned and looked towards the sky.

“Not yet. Behind a gray fog, the grey-winged goshawk is already monitoring our location!”

Wang Xian shook his head.

“What?”

Director Qian and the other three were slightly taken aback. Astonishment appeared on their faces. “Are you sure you haven’t left yet?”

Wang Xian nodded his head.

The four of them looked at each other. After hesitating for a moment, they said, “Let’s go. Leader Wang Xian, follow US and report this matter to deputy leader Meng!”

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded.

“Deputy captain Meng, according to our investigation, the gray-winged goshawk didn’t leave. It was above the gray fog in the sky!”

Director Qian and the rest rushed over and said directly.

“Huh?”

Deputy Captain Meng raised his eyebrows slightly.

“No way! The eagle-eyed officer clearly saw the goshawk leave just now. Why is it still above?”

The old man from the Ocean Academy looked at the five of them in disbelief.

“Our Demon Hunter Academy’s Wang Xian has a powerful ocular technique and a powerful detection ability!”

Director Qian said.

“PFFT, it can’t be? He has a powerful ocular technique. If he had a powerful ocular technique, why would your demon Hunter Academy suffer heavy losses on the way to Saint Sea Town? Stop joking around!”

However, as soon as director Qian finished his sentence, a mocking voice came from the side.

Deputy Captain Meng looked at Hai Wen in surprise.

“Uncle Meng, you might not know this, but the Demon Hunters Academy lost a mentor and more than 70 students on the way from the East Sea!”

Hai Wen saw the look in deputy captain Meng’s eyes and said with a smile. There was a hint of mockery in his voice.

Then, he looked at Wang Xian. The disdain in his eyes intensified. “Besides, Captain Hawkeye also possesses powerful ocular skills and insight. Could it be that Captain Hawkeye is inferior to a Nobody?”
