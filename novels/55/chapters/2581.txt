2582 2582 had plotted and killed the level seven divine king abyssal seed

“We’re not sure if the Dragon King and the others killed the members of the Sky Mountain Sword sect, but we can make a guess. Even if they didn’t kill them, it wouldn’t affect us!”

“Moreover, we don’t need to personally inform the Sky Mountain Sword sect about this matter. We just need to pass the news to the Sky Mountain Sword sect!”

“Let the Sky Mountain Sword sect decide what to do next!”

The sect master of the demon-slaying sect said with a smile on his face!

When the rest of the people heard his words, they looked pensive!

“It’s possible. After all, there’s no loss for us. If we can make the Sky Mountain Sword sect join our side, the Dragon Palace can be destroyed easily!”

The vice sect master of the ninth-grade sky sect nodded slightly!

“Then we won’t take action for the time being?”

The sect Master of the three seas sect said with a frown!

“Let’s stop for the time being. We won’t take action for the time being until we’re confident!”

The vice sect master of the ninth-grade sky sect said, and the other forces also nodded slightly!

“I’ll go and spread some news first!”

The sect master of the demon Slayer sect left with a Smile!

The other experts hesitated for a moment and also left one by one!

Not long after, someone posted an anonymous message on the AI, saying that they had seen the Dragon King kill a group of 63 people from the Tianshan Sword sect in the Abyss!

This news did not cause much of a stir. After all, it was an anonymous message, and there was no evidence to show that not many people believed it!

However, this message had reached the Tianshan Sword sect!

“How does the person who posted this news know that the sixth elder and the others are sixty-three people?”

In a hall of the Sky Mountain Sword sect, an elder looked at the message and frowned slightly. He looked at the people beside him!

“Many people know that the sixth elder and the others went to the abyss this time, but the exact number of sixty-three people shouldn’t be too many. However, people with good intentions should be able to notice it. How reliable is this news?”

An elder frowned and asked the crowd!

“The other party sent the message anonymously. It’s obvious that he doesn’t want us to know. Perhaps he’s afraid of the power of the Dragon Palace, so he went to investigate the whereabouts of the Dragon King and the others!”

The first elder who was in the lead said indifferently!

“Yes!”

A deacon nodded and immediately walked out!

The group of people waited slowly!

“Reporting to Elder, according to the information we received, the time when the Dragon King and the others entered and even came out is basically the same as the time when sixth elder and the others came out!”

Soon, a piece of news arrived, causing the group of people from the Sky Mountain Sword sect to frown!

“Report to Lord Sword King and let him decide!”

An elder hesitated for a moment before speaking!

“Alright!”

Everyone nodded. This was a matter related to a powerful force, and it was not something they could decide on their own!

“Send someone to test the Dragon King and the others to see if they killed them. If It’s not us apologizing, then... that’s another matter!”

Soon, the sword King sent a message!

They were not sure if the sixth elder and the rest were killed by the Dragon King, but they could test them!

As for the result of the test, if it was not done by the Dragon King and the rest, at most, they could apologize. There would not be any harm!

The people from the Sky Mountain Sword sect immediately nodded. The group immediately flew towards the direction of the Abyss!

When the Dragon King led the members out, they could confirm whether the sixth elder and the rest were killed by him!

While the ninth-grade heaven sect was scheming against Wang Xian and the Heaven Mountain Sword sect was about to probe him, Wang Xian led the members of the Dragon Palace to the front of the Giant Mountain!

The towering giant mountain stood upright in the abyss seed. It was like a beehive, containing waves of terrifying power!

From time to time, violent and bloodthirsty abyss seeds would poke out from the holes!

“Retreat 100 million kilometers and place the dragon’s blood here!”

“The rest of the members are hidden in the formation. Don’t be discovered!”

Wang Xian and the rest came to a spot 100 million kilometers away from the giant peak and took out the dragon’s blood!

After that, the members of the Dragon Palace entered a hidden formation. The formation was made by the Heaven Formation and could completely hide from the level seven abyssal seeds! Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

After the dragon blood was placed, Wang Xian and the rest hid in four different directions and waited quietly!

“Roar Roar Roar!”

In less than five minutes, roars could be heard. In their line of sight, a round abyssal seed was staring at the dragon blood with burning eyes. It was flying towards them at a terrifying speed!

Last time, it was this fellow who had swallowed the Dragon Blood!

“Ji Ji Ji Ji!”

At this time, another voice came from behind, the Undying Level 7 abyss seed with bone spikes flew over too!

Behind it, there were 2 to 3,000 abyss seeds, of which 400 to 500 were undying level!

“GOOD GOOD, 2 undying level 7, get ready, Strange Demon, you and Ao Qi Tian will instantly kill one, the other will surround and Attack!”

...

“You guys finish off the remaining two to three thousand Duan Jinming. You must do it as soon as possible. Don’t alert the nest of the abyssal seed!”

Wang Xian immediately reminded him!

“It’s the Dragon King!”

One voice after another entered his mind. Wang Xian stared straight ahead!

The round level 7 immortal King abyssal seed looked bloated, but its speed was indeed the fastest. It was still the first to arrive beside the dragon’s blood!

He stared at the Dragon’s blood in front of him, his eyes filled with excitement and greed!

“Ji Ji Ji Ji!”

Behind him, the abyssal seed that was filled with bone spikes let out an angry roar!

The round abyssal seed ignored it and opened its mouth wide to swallow the dragon’s blood!

“Attack!”

At this moment, a glimmer of light flashed in Wang Xian’s eyes. He immediately roared loudly!

...

Buzz

In an instant, AO Yaoyao and AO qitian appeared behind the circular abyssal seed!

Puff

Ao Yaoyao’s claws pierced directly into the body of the circular abyssal seed!

Roar! Roar! Roar

In an instant, an intense pain caused it to let out an angry and fearful roar. Sharp Thorns suddenly appeared on its back and pierced towards ao Yaoyao!

When Ao Yao saw the sudden appearance of the sharp thorns, his expression changed greatly!

“Peng!”

“Ao ao ao ao!”

However, at this moment, ao Qitian’s sea-pacifying needle landed directly on its head. The terrifying power caused it to let out a miserable cry!

Ao Yao’s figure flashed, and a cross of Light and darkness landed directly on its body!

“Ao ao ao ao!”

An incomparably painful cry was heard, and the round abyssal seed revealed a terrified expression!

“Peng!”

The next moment, his body instantly exploded, and he split into a dozen or so, fleeing in all directions!

“If you want to escape, don’t even think about it!”

Ao Yao’s arm shook, and the chains on the ocean-pacifying needle in his hand instantly spread out, directly covering the space within a radius of ten million kilometers!

“Light and Shadow Kill!”

Ao Yao saw the change in the abyssal seed, and his eyes revealed a cold expression. He instantly turned into more than ten black and white shadows and chased after the abyssal seed!

“Pu Pu Pu!”

The sound of penetration was continuously heard!
