Chapter 492: In The Name Of The Fire Goddess (2)

Wang Xian stared coldly at that lady.

As for Mu Xiaowan and her mother, whom Wang Xian had pulled along, all they felt was that they had appeared on the roads all of a sudden. Both of them were still in shock.

However, Mu Xiaowan’s mother clearly knew a little about martial artists. She quickly took a few deep breaths to calm herself.

Rumble!

Several luxurious police cars drove over and started cordoning off the area.

“Deity Lady, don’t waste precious time on an ant. It’s time for us to go!” the old man beside the lady said to her while staring at the Fire Spirit Island before them.

“Hehe, interesting! Such a young Dan Realm expert. I wonder which denomination he’s from?”

The lady scrutinized Wang Xian from head to toe before hugging the skull in her hands.

Her eyes and the skull in her hands flickered in a black glow before she smiled and said, “A pretty good brat!”

The two old men by her side chuckled after seeing how she reacted.

An evil and chilling thought reached Wang Xian.

Deity Lady? A pretty good brat?

Wang Xian shivered in chills. With her looks, she looked more like an old hag than a Deity Lady.

Swish swish swish!

At this moment, a group of fifty people flew towards the Fire Spirit Island. From them, one could sense terrifying aura.

“All unauthorized personnel please leave this place immediately. We are sealing off this region. If you wish to die, you can remain behind!”

Cold instructions reverberated while the cops of Dubai put up the seals around the area.

“Xiao Wan, leave with aunt now. Go home and get as far away as possible!”

When Wang Xian saw the experts of Nether Flame flying towards the Fire Spirit Island, he immediately said this to her.

“Uncle... They... They...”

At this moment, Mu Xiaowan was still in shock. She was pointing to the sky and mumbling blankly.

“Let’s go Xiaowan, listen to brother. We’ve got to leave!”

Mu Xiaowan’s mother was aware that this incident wasn’t something she could handle and immediately pulled Xiao Wan away.

“Be good! Go back and rest!” Wang Xian patted her head and said with a smile.

“Oh? Alright then!”

Mu Xiaowan looked at him, nodded her head and left with her mother.

Wang Xian stood there and frowned as he looked in the direction of the Fire Spirit Island.

When the police saw him standing there, they didn’t pay additional attention. There were still many martial artists that remained and they weren’t people who ordinary cops could handle.

All they had to ensure was that the locals were evacuated from the place.

“All the terrifying existences from the Fire God Denomination, Nether Flame and Heavenly Flame Denomination are here. They are going to take down the Fire God’s Graveyard forcefully this time!”

“I heard the Deity Lady from Nether Flame is here! How incredible is this! Even the Deity Lady is here!”

“The Deity Lady is extremely famous in all of Asia. The Nether Skull in her hands is also a powerful spiritual weapon!”

“There’s something strange about Dubai today. In the day, many of them entered the Fire Spirit Island. Could it be that Dubai has gotten some incredible items?”

Wang Xian walked towards the beach and heard the discussions among various martial artists.

Rumble!

At this moment, flames that covered a hundred zhang rose above the Fire Spirit Island and illuminated and dyed the entire sky red. [1] Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Dubai has obtained the Fire God’s Graveyard. Everyone, please leave!”

Grrr!

In the air, a soft and crisp voice reverberated.

Following this was a terrifying growl. Everyone on the beach could feel a stifling pressure from this growl.

“What? The uproar yesterday was because of you guys?”

“My Nether Flame was completely annihilated. It would appear that you guys have controlled the fire demons to kill them. Do you know the price of offending our Nether Flame?”

Angry roars erupted and the martial artists on the beach could see a group of experts hovering in the sky above the Fire Spirit Island.

On the volcano, there were over a thousand fire demons which illuminated the entire Fire Spirit Island.

“What happened yesterday was at the most critical juncture of obtaining control over the Fire God Palace. The riots of the fire demons had nothing to do with us and we have no grudge or feud against Nether Flame!” That crisp voice reverberated once again.

“Nonetheless, the losses of our Nether Flame still had something to do with you guys!” the coarse voice of the lady resounded.

“We have no control over the riots of the fire demons. Therefore, we are sorry to the experts from Nether Flame. Our Dubai nation wouldn’t want to become enemies with you!”

“If you don’t want to, take out sufficient compensation!”

“Are you threatening our Dubai?”

“So what if we are? My Nether Flame suffered grave losses. Since you guys have obtained the Fire God Palace, you have to pay a sufficient compensation. Otherwise, we will have to retrieve the compensation ourselves!”

“Experts from the Fire God Denomination and Heavenly Flame Denomination, do you guys have the same thoughts?”

“Hehe. Dubai was founded by a Water God. You guys would have no use for the Fire God Palace. Why not give it to us?”

“Haha! All treasures in the world have always been decided by the strong!”

The conversation in the air disrupted the silent night. Everyone on the beach could hear it clearly.

“Who would have thought that the treasures have fallen into the hands of Dubai! How surprising!”

“So what if they did. That’s the graveyard of a Fire God. Those three fire attribute denominations won’t just let it go. Dubai could only negotiate!”

“A Budding Realm existence from both the Fire God Denomination and Heavenly Flame Denomination are here. I just wonder how many came from the Nether Flame?”

“Since Dubai lost the Holy Water Scripture a few hundred years ago, the last Budding Realm expert has passed away. There’s no Budding Realm expert left in Dubai and they aren’t a match for the three denominations. They are going to just admit their defeat!” A few martial artists were discussing.

“In that case, we could only fight!”

“Grrr! Get out of our territory or all of you will die here!” the crisp voice followed by the roar of a beast erupted. The next instant, one could clearly feel that the temperature around Fire Spirit Island had gone up by several hundred degrees.

A heat wave was formed over the sea.

“Insolent fool! How can a small Dubai possibly be a match for us!”

The coarse voice became a little sharp. A skull was emitting a dull glow.

It was extremely dazzling within the light from the fire.

“They are going to fight!”

“Oh gosh! A battle between Budding Realm experts! A battle that could destroy heaven and earth!”

“Is Dubai courting death?”

The martial artists on the beach were astonished as they continued staring in the direction of the Fire Spirit Island.

Grrr!

A huge and invincible figure jumped into the air and attacked the three denominations immediately.

The terrifying aura sent chills down the spine of everyone.

“F*ck. Snatching my items?”

When Wang Xian saw the battle erupting over Fire Spirit Island, his turned gloomy. He jumped and flew towards the Fire Spirit Island directly.

“What is he doing? Courting his own death? Why is he even thinking of participating in a war like this?”

When the people on the beach saw Wang Xian flying over, they were shocked.

Wang Xian was emotionless. It was as though he was moving instantaneously as he covered a distance of several thousand meters in an instant.

“Huh? This isn’t right. Why do you from Dubai know how to use fire attributes attacks? Could it be...you’ve inherited the legacy of the Fire God?”

An exclamation broke out from the Deity Lady from Nether Flame. In the air, all the experts stared at Adjaya who was standing on the Fire Spirit Island!

“If you guys aren’t leaving, don’t blame me for not being courteous.”

On Adjaya, bright red flames were burning. She held a truncheon in her hands, one that belonged to the Fire God!
