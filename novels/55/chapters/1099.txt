In holy sea town, a powerful array guarded the town, calming everyone down.

However, the sadness left behind by the Demon Beasts’siege caused the atmosphere in holy sea town to become slightly silent.

Those who died defending the town were collectively buried under the arrangements of the mayor’s office.

The people of holy sea town consciously came out to send off the heroes defending the town.

All of them worked together as one.

After the entire town was attacked by the desperate demon beasts, everyone in the town became much closer.

They were all comrades who fought together.

“Send off... our heroes, our relatives!”

On the third day, under the leadership of the mayor, Jin Qianyuan, the people of Holy Sea Town walked out of their homes and saw a tombstone.

Many of the soldiers guarding the city were swallowed by the ferocious beasts, so there were almost no corpses. There was only one tombstone.

The tombstone was filled with names. There were more than 3,000 names in total.

If Wang Xian had not appeared at the north gate, more people might have died.

The descendants of the deceased, one by one, carried the memorial tablets of their father and grandfather. They drove through the streets of Shenghai Town and finally entered the Hall of heroes that was specially set up by Shenghai Town!

“Bow!”

Mayor Jin looked at the tombstone of the Hall of heroes and shouted loudly.

The tens of thousands of people standing around and the people on the streets outside immediately bowed.

“The deceased have passed away. The future of our Shenghai town will be better in the future!”

Jin Qianyuan swept his gaze across everyone around and said loudly.

Wang Xian stood on the upper floor of the mayor’s residence and looked down.

“After experiencing this disaster, the entire Shenghai town is equivalent to being reborn from the Ashes!”

Wang Xian looked around and said with a sigh.

Buzz! Buzz

At this moment, the communication stone plate in his hand started to tremble.

“What’s going on? HMM? It’s public information!”

Public information was a piece of information that was forcefully released to everyone in a certain area.

To release such information, the mayor of East Sea city and a few of the top bigwigs in East Sea city had to give the order.

This was the same as the mission released by the Mercenary Association.

However, when he saw this piece of information, his face instantly darkened.

Arrest Warrant!

Currently, East Sea city had issued an arrest warrant: arrest the leader of the Celestial Phoenix mercenary group, Wang Xian, a former first-year student of the Demon Hunters Academy. Anyone who had any information about this person would report it through the communication stone plate. After the information was confirmed, he will be rewarded with a million middle-grade spirit stones. He will be killed and rewarded with 100 million middle-grade spirit stones!

Below the wanted notice, there was a picture of Wang Xian.

“HMPH, a wanted notice!”

Wang Xian didn’t need to think to know that this was an order issued by the general of the ocean cultivators army.

He had killed his son. He would never let this matter rest.

...

“What? An arrest warrant?”

“This is an arrest warrant issued by the Eastern Sea City. I want his uncle!”

“Damn it. It must be because Lord Wang had killed the son of the general. That’s why the general of the ocean cultivator corps issued an arrest warrant!”

“These D * MN guys. The ocean cultivator corps had escaped when we were in danger. It was Lord Wang who saved us. He even gave us a million middle-grade spirit stones. I Won’t even report to you even if you give me ten million!”

“We are very clear about this matter. When we went to the ocean mountain region to resolve the hidden dangers, the general’s son killed four people because of his selfish desires. In the end, he even arrogantly said that his father was tsunami sky. What can you do about it? !”

“F * ck the ocean cultivator army! F * ck the SH * t star-moon Kingdom! The kingdom has already given up on us. We are not people from star-moon kingdom!”

At this moment, the rest of the people in Holy Sea Town who saw the wanted notice had furious expressions on their faces as they cursed loudly.

At this moment, they did not care if you were the city lord of East Sea City, the general of the ocean army, or the king of the star-moon kingdom. In their eyes, they were all BULLSH * t.

Now, they only knew one person, their great benefactor, Wang Xian!

Even a wanted order?

Jin Qianyuan and a few experts from holy sea town also saw this information. Their faces turned slightly gloomy.

Buzz Buzz

At this moment, Jin Qianyuan suddenly saw a message from the castellan of East Ocean City.

“Holy sea town was not destroyed by the ferocious beasts?”

A surprised question.

At this moment, in the Castellan’s residence of East Ocean City.

Two middle-aged men sat side by side in the center of the front row. One of them had terrifying lightning in his body. A snake-like lightning was spinning on his arm.

The other middle-aged man had his palms on a huge sword. He sat there motionlessly.

“City Lord Lei, it’s true that the holy sea town was not breached by the ferocious beasts. A friend of mine told me that they were saved by an expert named Wang Xian who took out a powerful defensive formation!”

On both sides of the table, there were many experts seated.

A middle-aged man stood at the front and reported respectfully to mayor lei.

“I have already sent a message to the mayor of the Holy Sea Town and I’m waiting for his reply!”

Mayor Lei’s face was solemn as he sat on the table and waited quietly.

His eyes were staring at the communication stone plate and there was some fury in his eyes.

Since the holy sea town was already secured, it would be a waste for a small town mayor like you to not report in time when he had already sent the news of the holy sea town being destroyed to the imperial city.

“Wang Xian!”

The middle-aged man with his palm on the big sword muttered. His eyes were filled with a strong murderous intent.

Instantly, everyone felt the room turn cold. They couldn’t help but shiver.

“Yes, City Lord Lei!”

In the Holy Sea Town, Jin Qianyuan’s eyes flickered. He hesitated for a moment before replying.

“It has been confirmed that the holy sea town has not been destroyed!”

City Lord Lei read the message and said in a deep voice.

“Ask the mayor if the guy who killed my son is still in the holy sea town. I want to go over and kill him!”

The middle-aged man stood up slowly. He was like a roaring ocean.

“Okay!”

City lord lei nodded slowly.

“The holy sea town has been defended. If we don’t report it in time, what crime should we commit?”

“I heard that Wang Xian is there. Leave Him in the holy sea town and don’t let him leave. General Hai, head to the holy sea town immediately!”

He spoke directly to Jin Qianyuan. His words were filled with dissatisfaction towards him.

He was the city lord, the city lord of one of the top ten cities in star-moon kingdom. He was an expert at the insightful void level. Jin Qianyuan was merely the mayor and one of his subordinates.

A single word from him could cause Jin Qianyuan to lose his position as mayor, or even his life.

Therefore, his words were filled with the authority of a superior, controlling life and death!

However, in holy sea town, when Jin Qianyuan received the message from the Thunder City Lord, a furious expression appeared on his face.

“F * ck you! When holy sea town was in crisis, the insightful void realm expert didn’t come. Instead, he came directly because of his son’s matter. F * ck!”

Jin Qianyuan’s furious roar immediately sounded!
