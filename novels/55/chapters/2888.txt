Chapter 2889: 2,889 dragon punishment 5

* Boom! *

Little Blue’s gigantic body, which was more than 100 kilometers long, crashed heavily into the vast land of Lianshan Formation. The entire space seemed to tremble.

* crack crack crack crack! *

Soon, cracks appeared on the powerful formation that was guarding Wu Mountain.

* Buzz! *

* Woo Woo! *

Little Blue’s body trembled slightly and let out a low roar. The defensive mountains formed by the Earth attribute collapsed rapidly and turned into dust.

“Not good, the vast earth array of the Lianshan Mountain has been broken!”

The experts from the Wizard Association were greatly shocked and shouted in alarm.

The Wizard turned his head and his heart sank when he saw this scene.

The monarch’s expression changed and he had a bad premonition.

“You must be careful!”

His mind moved and he immediately reminded the other monarch.

The monarch was slightly stunned and he gritted his teeth.

He knew what the Emperor meant.

Glancing at the disciples of the imperial court behind him, he clenched his fists and stared at the people of the Dragon Palace in front of him.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

At this moment, another terrifying roar was heard.

The Nine Wind God Dragons in the center flapped their enormous wings and countless small wind god Dragons appeared around them.

“Roar!”

Each of the small wind dragons seemed to come to life, and they let out a dragon’s roar as they attacked forward.

“This attack!”

The Wizard in the center, who was controlling the spell formation, saw the nine wind dragons attack again, and his heart froze.

“Wizard World’s spell formation, Wu Mountain fog rain spell formation, defend!”

The Wizard waved his arm, and the two spell formations instantly rose into the air, welcoming the divine dragons formed from countless wind elements.

The Magus world and the Magus Mountain fog rain formation were the two strongest formations of the Magus Union.

After a billion years of construction, modification, and augmentation, the two formations were now able to cover the entire Magus Mountain.

Furthermore, with the two formations activated, a Type 2 divine emperor attacked them, not moving an inch.

Even if there were two or three Type 2 divine emperors, they would not be able to break through this formation!

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

“Pa! PA! Pa!”

However, when the countless wind attribute divine dragons’attacks landed on the two formations, a terrifying scene appeared.

The wind attribute divine dragons’attacks landed on the two formations, causing cracks to appear on the formations.

When the Magus saw this scene, his heart sank.

He was confident that he could withstand the attacks of four or five rank two divine emperors because of these two formations.

These two were the legacy formations of the Magus Union!

But now, their legacy formations were slowly cracking!

This gave him a bad premonition!

From the start of the battle, the Magus Union and the others had been using their formations to resist and did not directly clash.

However, the formations had been broken one by one, and they were still so easily broken. What followed next…

“Magus, the formations are going to be broken, the formations are going to be broken!”

At this moment, son of heaven shouted at the Magus with a pale face.

Formations were their strongest trump card. As powerful formation masters and Magi with formation masters as their foundation, once the formations were broken, they would lose all their means.

If even the formation could not withstand it, then the outcome of welcoming them was obvious.

“Shut up, I know!”

The Magus roared with a face full of frustration and violence.

He knew the consequences of breaking the formation.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

Another roar came from the center.

The nine wind divine dragons flapped their enormous dragon wings and charged towards the Magus world’s formation and the Magus Mountain fog rain formation.

“Bang, Bang, Bang!”

With their terrifying speed, they charged right before the two formations, and violent sounds of collision rang out.

* Crash! *

The mirror that seemed to be protecting the mountain of sorcerers cracked.

“Roar, Roar, Roar!”

In the next moment, terrifying dragon roars and waves of mighty dragon might were displayed before all the powerful warriors and disciples of the Shaman Association and the imperial court.

The spell formation was broken!

The attack lasted less than two minutes!

“It’s broken! All the five spell formations of the Witch Formation Association have been broken!”

“Hiss, so fast! This is the Witch Formation Association of the Heaven Magus region! It has been the Overlord for one billion years and has a terrifying foundation. How could it be broken so quickly? Those nine wind divine dragons are so terrifying. Only real divine dragons are that terrifying, right?”

“The Dragon Palace is too powerful, especially those nine divine dragons. Those nine divine dragons are exactly the same as the wind divine dragons in the records. They are definitely true divine dragons!”

The experts from the Heaven Magus region who were hiding in the surrounding void watching the battle were somewhat stunned when they saw this scene.

The formation of the Witch Formation Association, the Overlord of the Heaven Magus region, who was best at defense, was quickly destroyed one by one.

In less than two minutes, the formation protecting the entire Wu mountain had collapsed.

‘If the formation Wizard Association doesn’t have any trump cards, they’ll be finished!’

Everyone thought to themselves.

‘not good, they’re attacking!’

“Guardian, guardian, they’re attacking!”

“Lord Magus!”

When the nine wind divine dragons entered the Wu Mountain’s domain, the faces of the formation Wizard Association’s experts and disciples on the Wu Mountain changed drastically as they roared in fear.

Facing these nine terrifying wind divine dragons, they felt that they were on a completely different level.

With just a slight movement from the nine wind divine dragons, they would die.

There was a huge difference in their lives.

“This is bad!” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

The expressions of the Magi changed drastically. The Magus Union’s defenses, which they were so proud of, had actually been so easily broken through. How were they going to fight next?

“Damn it!”

At the side, the Divine Emperors of the formation spell union were also drenched in cold sweat.

“Hahaha, Space Lockdown!”

“Formation Spell Union, it’s been more than ten million years. It’s been more than ten million years. I’ve been waiting for more than ten million years. Today, I want you all to be destroyed!”

At this moment, the sky array, which had not made a move all this while, let out an excited roar.

“Buzz, Buzz, Buzz!”

As he spoke, their bodies separated one by one.

Nine heads with nine different attributes flew in all directions.

Each head shot out rays of light.

The nine rays of light illuminated the entire area and enveloped more than half of the Wu Mountain.

In front of them, all the god emperors, experts, and disciples of the Magus Union were all enveloped within.

Space blockade!

This was the array formation that the sky array had been preparing ever since it found out that the Dragon Palace was going to attack the Sky Magus region.

“Not good!”

At that moment, the Magus’expression changed drastically.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

The array formation collapsed, and the god Emperors of the Dragon Palace rushed in. The 100,000 disciples of the Dragon Palace also rushed in from behind.

“How can this be!”

The monarch looked at this scene with an unwilling expression.

He knew that the Witch Formation Association was probably finished.

With his strength, he could sense that the three rank two godly monarchs, the wind god dragons, were not something that a rank two godly monarch like him could compare to.

It was not unfair that the defense of the Witch Formation Association was destroyed in this battle!

Because the other party was a true godly dragon!
