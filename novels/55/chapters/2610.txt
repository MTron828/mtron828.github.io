2611 2611’s strength had broken through

“Sister bei Shuang has really been accepted as a disciple by the Dragon Palace?”

Outside the Dragon Palace, the North Gate Undying God dynasty girl stood outside with a shocked expression. She could not help but Exclaim!

“Yes, I’ll have to trouble Little Xun to tell the emperor that I’ll be training here in the Dragon Palace in the future!”

Bei Shuang nodded and said to her. She then looked at the North Gate Undying God dynasty emperor beside her. After that, she waved at the girl and entered the Dragon Palace!

The girl opened her mouth, her face filled with shock!

“HM? Miss bei Shuang has really been accepted as a disciple by the Dragon Emperor?”

Very quickly, the North Gate Emperor received the news, his face filled with shock, after which he frowned slightly!

“Becoming a disciple of the Dragon Emperor is good for our North Gate Undying Dynasty, but what about the North River Sect?”

He muttered, his face filled with hesitation!

“Just inform the North River sect, bei Shuang isn’t as important as before, they shouldn’t bother about her anymore!”

An old man from the North Gate Undying dynasty beside said!

“HM, that’s true!” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

The north gate emperor nodded!

Bei Shuang being sent to their side meant that the North River sect had completely given up on her!

The matter of bei Shuang being taken in as a disciple by the Dragon King did not attract much attention!

After this huge battle, the Dragon Palace had also kept a low profile. The Dragon Star had also become prosperous!

Time passed by slowly. Half a year passed very quickly. The Dragon Star had become the center of the southern star system!

On this day of half a month, Wang Xian brought Hua’er, Cai’er, and Xiao ran over!

The arrival of the two little girls made the entire dragon palace much livelier. Hua’er and Cai’er stuck to Wang Xian all day long!

This stunned the imperial star Lady and made her call Wang Xian a beast!

In the southern star system, the Dragon Palace had an absolute position. The resources that the Dragon Palace obtained every day were also extremely terrifying!

Every day, the Immortal King was born in the Dragon Palace!

The strength of the Dragon Palace had also increased by leaps and bounds!

“Be careful when you enter. Ao Tu, you guys better defend yourselves. The Level 8 undying godly monarch abyss seed is not that easy to deal with!”

A year later, in the Abyss, around the huge Abyss Peak, Wang Xian led a group of Dragon Palace powerhouses to the front of the huge peak and said to them!

“It’s the Dragon King!”

There were a total of 42 level 7 immortal king powerhouses. including Wang Xian himself, the Dragon Palace had sent out all the powerhouses this time!

In addition, 100 level 6 immortal king powerhouses were sent out as well!

A year and a half later, Wang Xian came here again!

This time, Wang Xian wanted to break through this huge abyss peak and obtain the treasures inside!

After destroying the six major forces, the Dragon Palace obtained all of their resources!

Their resources allowed the Dragon Palace to add 11 level 7 immortal king powerhouses and 50 Level 6 immortal king powerhouses!

Meanwhile, Wang Xian also obtained a large amount of resources from all the immortal kingdoms and treasure vaults of the six major forces!

It was a pity that these resources were not enough to upgrade him to level one!

However, it was not far from upgrading!

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian shouted softly and entered the huge mountain!

With the strength of the Dragon Palace, even if there were four immortal King Level 8 existences inside, they would be able to contend with them!

Of course, if there were really four of them, it would be difficult for the Dragon Palace to conquer this place!

However, according to his investigation last time, there was only one immortal King Level 8 abyss seed inside!

“As long as I can break through here, that huge tree’s fruit should be able to raise my battle strength to undying level 8, and it should also be able to add an undying level 8 warrior to the Dragon Palace!”

He muttered, his eyes filled with hope!

“Weng Weng Weng!”

Beside him, the sky array took out many array compasses and waved them in the air!

“Dragon King, according to the energy scan, there’s only one undying level 8, and 15 Undying Level 7!”

Tian Chen said slowly!

“Not bad, old Tian Chen, impressive!”

Beside him, Mo Sha gave him a thumbs up!

“Little guy, treat the old people with respect, especially if you can’t beat them!”

The sky array said to him indifferently!

“Hehe, if you rely on your seniority, I’ll Crush You Next Time!”

Mo Sha smiled and said with a chuckle!

“Alright, let’s Enter!”

...

Wang Xian smiled and everyone immediately entered from the cave entrance around the peak!

“15 level 7 and 150 level 6 ones to deal with the rest. We’ll take care of that level 8 abyss seed of the Immortal King!”

Wang Xian said calmly!

“It’s the Dragon King!”

“Five minutes at most, all of them are done!”

The members of the Dragon Palace said confidently!

“Buzz Buzz Buzz!”

The next moment, everyone flew down at a terrifying speed!

They locked onto one abyssal seed one by one!

Under the magma at the bottom of the sea, the group of abyssal seeds sensed the arrival of the Dragon Palace’s powerhouse. They felt a strong pressure and immediately came out from the magma!

“Roar Roar Roar!”

...

Even the level 8 immortal king Abyss species showed its head restlessly. Its cold, blood-red eyes stared at Wang Xian and the rest!

“Kill!”

“Roar Roar Roar!”

“Roar Roar Roar!”

In the next moment, Wang Xian’s members transformed into powerful dragon species and let out a roar!

Wang Xian transformed into a seven-colored divine dragon. He swayed his huge body and attacked downwards with his dragon claws!

At this moment, the power of the Dragon Palace was displayed without a doubt!

“Roar Roar Roar!”

The abyss seed below let out a furious roar and charged forward!

“Kill!”

With the power of the Dragon Palace, 10 Level 7 members could fight against an undying King Level 8 abyss seed!

Currently, 25 undying King Level 7 members were fighting against the level 8 abyss seed!

The Imperial Dragon Species Ao tu and the others were defending!

The arrow dragon species Mu Ze Sen and the others were attacking from afar!

The berserk dragon species ao Qitian was fighting against AO qi master in close combat!

The Ao Yao Thorn Dragon species was attacking!

At the back, the demonic fiend eight Qi master was interfering with the poison!

The Dolphins were supporting!

Along with Ao Xing Mu’s starwood dragon species and Ao Feng Huang’s Heavenly Lightning Earth Fire Dragon Phoenix species!

Under such circumstances, the Dragon Palace was able to suppress all the abyss seeds in an instant!

“Alright, Kill!”

When Wang Xian saw this situation, a smile appeared on his face!

According to this situation, as long as the ten members of the Dragon Palace cooperated well, they would be able to kill all the level 8 abyss seeds within half an hour, not to mention the twenty-five!

“Boom Boom Boom!”

The powerful battle lasted for four minutes. The Level 8 immortal King Abyss Seed was killed by Ao Yao, Mu Zesen and the rest, and its body was penetrated!

“Keke Keke, it’s So Easy!”

Ba Qi and the rest smiled when they saw the level 8 undying god King Abyss seed being killed!

“This level 8 undying god King Abyss Seed’s corpse can raise a person’s combat strength to level 8 undying God King. Look at it yourselves, who’s going to use it!”

Wang Xian said with a smile!

“Dragon King, I want it. I’ll raise it first. Juniors, do you have any objections?”

Tian Chen’s eyes were burning as he spoke immediately!

“Taking advantage of your seniority!”

The eight-limbed demon Fiend and the others spoke, but no one objected!
