Chapter 1588: There were 1,588 dead bodies and thousands of miles of blood

“There’s news from Wanbei City of the Bingxin Empire. The Sky Demon and an old man with monstrous demonic aura have appeared. All the disciples of the royal family of the Bingxin Empire have been killed!”

“Kill anyone who doesn’t kneel. This is the eighth city!”

While Wang Xian and the hunchbacked old man were massacring in the Bingxin Empire, the news had also spread to the ruins of the divine kingdom.

Everyone had shocked expressions on their faces.

“This sky demon really wants to exterminate all the members of the royal family of the Bingxin Empire. Sky Demon is worthy of being a Sky Demon!”

“The unkillable Bingxin Empire, the unkillable Sky Demon. He is fulfilling his promise!”

“Back then, pastor Wang helped the Patriarch of the Bingxin Empire expel the dark soul from his body for free. Now, they have forcefully separated Ling Jian ‘er and Wang Xian. They even want to kill Pastor Wang. Naturally, pastor Wang will not let them off. I support pastor Wang to exterminate the Empire!”

“All ungrateful people, kill them all!”

In the ruins of the divine kingdom, everyone was discussing loudly after receiving the news.

The extermination of the Empire was being carried out under the attention of the entire vast region. If the Bingxin Empire was exterminated, it would set off a storm in the vast region.

“Ahhhh!”

In an incomparably beautiful city, screams of pain could be heard endlessly.

“More than ten thousand people, Keke!”

The hunchbacked elder flew over and licked his tongue. The ball of blood in front of him was already two meters in size.

The Dancing Ball of blood looked abnormally evil.

“Boss Devil, more than a thousand kilometers ahead is the imperial city of the Iceheart Empire, the Majestic Empire on the Iceheart Lake!”

“The entire imperial city has been standing for more than ten thousand years. There must be many powerful arrays inside!”

The hunchbacked old man pointed ahead and said with excitement in his eyes.

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian didn’t hesitate at all and flew directly toward the Imperial City of the Bingxin Empire.

Today, no matter what, the country must be destroyed and people must be killed!

Only cruelty and bloodshed could make the sect afraid. Only then would the sect not dare to do anything to Jian ‘er.

Regardless of whether it was the anger and brutality in his heart or for Jian ‘er’s sake.

Today, the sky would definitely be dyed red.

“It’s just ahead. It’s been a long, long time since I last started killing!”

The hunchbacked old man’s turbid eyes were filled with excitement.

Wang Xian stared ahead. In front of him was an incomparably huge lake. The water in the lake was so clear that the bottom could be seen.

In the center was a huge castle. The entire castle was suspended above the lake. It was like a world in a dream.

At this moment, the huge castle was completely enveloped in the azure blue lake water.

“Roar roar, Ice Dharmaraja. is the Bingxin Empire ready to be destroyed?”

Wang Xian stared at the castle in front of him, and a strong murderous intent shot out from his eyes.

“D * mn Sky Demon, our Bingxin Empire has stood in the vast region for more than 10,000 years. Is it really that easy to destroy our empire?”

At this moment, in front of the main gate of the Bingxin Imperial City, all the experts of the Bingxin Empire were standing on the city wall.

There were more than a hundred thousand people. Their eyes were filled with killing intent as they stared at Wang Xian and the stooped old man.

The long-haired old man looked extremely embarrassed as he stared at them and growled in a low voice.

“Those who dare to offend our Bingxin Empire will be killed without mercy!”

“Killed without mercy!”

“What Sky Devil and Earth Devil? As long as they dare to go against our Bingxin dynasty, let them go to hell!”

“That’s right. Kill the Sky Devil, hang his head on the city wall, and chop his body into pieces!”

On the city wall, the experts of the Bingxin dynasty shouted sternly.

The three forefathers of the Bingxin dynasty stood in the center.

The king of the Iceheart dynasty stood to the side.

The king of the Iceheart dynasty did not die in the martial arts arena of the Solitaire sect. As the king of a first-rate force, he had powerful life-saving methods.

The moment the battle broke out, he escaped with his son, Bing Jinghuan.

Looking at the Sky Demon in front of him, his body trembled.

Right and wrong, regret, unwillingness, anger, and finally, thick killing intent.

We must kill the skyfiend, we must!

“Hehehe, I thought you were so powerful, but you were still hiding in your nest!”

“Look, this is the blood of the royal family of the Bingxin dynasty. The blood flows for thousands of miles, and more than 200,000 dog lives. hehehe, hehehe!”

The hunchbacked old man moved and floated in the center, the blood in front of him jumping.

An evil aura emanated from his body, and his appearance was that of an evil villain.

“What?”

“That ball of blood gives me a very familiar feeling. This... Damn Devil, kill him, kill him!”

“Blood flowing for tens of thousands of miles? How dare he slaughter the members of our Royal Family’s Ice Clan? We can’t let them off!”

The hundreds of thousands of people on the city walls were mostly members of the royal family’s Ice Clan. When they saw this scene, their eyes turned blood-red as they roared with killing intent.

Even the three elders of the Bingxin Empire had blood-red eyes and their bodies were trembling slightly.

“Priest Wang, you’ve killed them as well. Now, do you really want to fight to the death with our Bingxin Empire?”

Bing Fafu stared at Wang Xian with an extremely embarrassed expression as he roared in a low voice.

“There’s no need for the ungrateful clan to exist in this world!”

Wang Xian roared with a furious expression. He opened his huge dragon mouth and a ball of black flame flew straight towards the imperial city.

“Good, good. Do you really think that our Bingxin Empire will be afraid of You?”

The white-bearded elder, who was in the middle, roared with a ferocious expression. He waved his arm.

The formation that included the imperial city of bingxin condensed into a giant sword that was a thousand meters in size.

The giant sword flew towards Wang Xian and the hunchbacked elder.

“Such a powerful attack formation. TSK TSK!”

The hunchbacked old man looked at the huge sword that was attacking him with a cold look in his eyes.

He waved his arm and numerous black spears flew towards the huge sword.

Boom! Boom! Boom

The sound of intense explosions could be heard.

“That’s right. An attack formation can threaten a powerhouse at level eight of the Seethrough realm. As expected of an empire that has stood for tens of thousands of years!”

The hunchbacked old man licked his tongue and looked at Wang Xian.

“Boss demon, it’s a little troublesome. An offensive formation can threaten a powerhouse at level eight of the Seethrough realm. A defensive formation will definitely be able to withstand an attack from a powerhouse at level eight of the Seethrough Realm!”

He said to Wang Xian.

“You wish to destroy our Bingxin Empire? Dream On!”

At the city wall, the three old men from the Bingxin Empire stared at Wang Xian and the stooped old man with eyes filled with killing intent.

“Is that so? I really want to give it a try!”

Wang Xian licked his lips and stared at the sky above the Bingxin Imperial City.

“Dharma Idol, Abyss Demonic Dragon!”

Wang Xian roared loudly. Darkness gathered in the sky and a huge abyss door slowly appeared.

“Although I haven’t achieved the fusion of light and darkness, I can achieve the balance between light and darkness. Let’s try this move!”

After Wang Xian released his Dharma Idol, Abyss Demonic Dragon, a ray of light slowly appeared in the abyss-like deep dragon’s eyes.

The light slowly covered his body.

For the first time, he transformed into a divine light dragon.

The Dragon Pearl was spat out from his mouth. The light power in the heart of Light and darkness was activated at full strength. Countless rays of light surged towards the light dragon pearl.

A divine light dragon that was similar to the Abyss Demonic Dragon condensed in the sky.

One light and one darkness. The Yin and Yang were polar opposites, creating and destroying each other!

Wang Xian forcefully created two divine light dragons and dark divine dragons with the same strength.

Two Dragons destroy the world!
