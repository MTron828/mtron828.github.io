Chapter 1546: 1546 suppressing all the heaven’s favorites 9

“Oh right brother, how do you know that priest Wang Xian Wang?”

At this moment, Wu Qingyan, who was rushing to the banquet venue, asked her brother curiously.

They had already sent their subordinates to look for information on Wang Xian. When they were reporting to them, they found out that her brother was also sending people to look for information on him.

“Huh?”

Wu Qingcheng was slightly taken aback. He coughed lightly and said faintly, “I bumped into him by accident two days ago and realized that he was extraordinary. He was a dragon among men, so I did some research!”

“I even gave him an invitation letter for today’s banquet. He should be here today.”

Wu Qingcheng said directly without blushing or gasping for breath.

He couldn’t possibly say that he was met by that young man and was intimidated by him. He even asked for an invitation letter from him. It was simply too embarrassing to say that.

How could he retain the image of being invincible in the hearts of his two younger sisters?

“He will be here? HMPH, this fellow has said that I’m the daughter of Light and I’m trash in front of him. What the hell!”

Wu Qingyan snorted coldly when she heard that Wang Xian was coming over.

Wu Qingcheng smiled when he heard his sister’s words.

“However, with his strength, not only am I trash in front of him, even you, brother, are trash in front of him!”

However, Wu Qingcheng’s smile soon froze.

He wanted to vomit blood when he heard his sister’s words. The image of him being invincible in his sister’s heart!

However, he wasn’t in the least bit jealous of the mysterious and monstrous Wang Xian.

When a person’s strength far surpassed his own and he had to look up to him, there wouldn’t be any jealousy in a person’s heart.

There would only be respect and worship!

Although he didn’t have to worship that young man, he was extremely fearful in his heart.

Such a person would either not be his enemy or he would have a 100% certainty of killing him. Otherwise, there would be endless trouble in the future.

Even for the Wuji Empire, there was a possibility of endless trouble in the future.

“According to the news, that priest Wang came to the vast region to look for a woman. I didn’t expect him to be a person who values friendship!”

Wu Qingyan, who was at the side, suddenly said.

“Indeed, I’m a little envious of that girl!”

Wu Qingyan nodded. A Heaven’s pride expert had traveled the entire vast region in order to look for a woman.

Although they had received a lot of information, there was one thing that they didn’t know. That was that Wang Xian had transformed into a demonic dragon.

At that time, Wang Xian was concealed by the He clan’s patriarch and a group of experts using a formation. Other than the He clan and he Sui clan’s higher-ups who knew about it, no one else knew about it.

“There are too many dead people!”

“Kill him for me!”

Just as they arrived at the banquet area in front of the Black Lotus Lake, a cold voice suddenly sounded.

The voice stunned Wu Qingyan and the rest of them. They looked ahead.

When Wu Qingcheng saw a group of people gathered in front of him and someone in the middle took out a weapon, his expression instantly turned cold.

“What interesting thing happened? Why didn’t you inform me in advance? Everyone!”

Wu Qingcheng saw that someone was causing trouble at his banquet. His body emitted a wave of pressure as he charged forward.

His voice resounded in everyone’s mind.

In the center, the people from the Bingxin Empire and the disciples of the solipsistic sect were surrounding Wang Xian.

Young Master Tian and young master di stood there as though they were the center of the world. They opened their mouths to judge.

Just as they were about to make their move, the voice of Wuqing city was heard.

Hearing this voice, everyone was slightly shocked. Even the disciples of the Solitaire sect who were about to make their move immediately stopped.

“The crown prince of Wuqing City of Wuji Imperial City Is Here!”

“It’s the voice of the crown prince. The Crown Prince Is Here!”

“The voice of the crown prince is filled with anger. It seems that he is a little angry!”

Everyone around was slightly shocked and quickly turned to the back.

“His Highness the Crown Prince!”

“His Highness the Crown Prince!”

Everyone quickly called out respectfully.

Today’s banquet was organized by His Highness the Crown Prince of Wuqing City. This was the territory of the Crown Prince of Wuqing City.

Anyone who came would have to give face, even if it was the two young masters of Heaven and earth.

Wu Qingcheng walked towards the center of the hall with great strides. Everyone quickly made way for him.

“What happened?”

He asked in a deep voice with no expression on his face.

“Crown Prince of Wu Qingcheng, long time no see. Someone is provoking us here. We might have to trouble you today. Next time, Heaven and earth will return the favor!”

The two young masters of Heaven and Earth raised their brows slightly when they saw Wu Qing city walking over. A faint smile appeared on their faces as they said this.

After all, this was Wu Qing city’s territory. If they were outside, they could ignore Wu Qing city and directly kill that brat.

But here, he had to give Wu Qing city some face.

“Oh? That fellow Southern Emperor Wudi didn’t come. Who else would dare to provoke you!”

Wu Qing Cheng continued to walk inside. He looked at the two young masters of Heaven and earth and was slightly surprised.

Behind him, Wu Qing Yan and Wu Qing Yan also followed behind with faces full of confusion.

Other than their own brother and southern Emperor Wudi, who else would dare to provoke the two heaven’s and Earth’s proud sons of Heaven of our sect?

“There are always some people who want to die. Give us some face and we’ll return it to you next time!”

Young Master Tian smiled at Wu Qingcheng.

Wu Qingcheng also smiled when he heard young master Tian’s words. The face of the elites of the only sect in the world was still very valuable.

He had invited them over this time for the heart of Darkness Fruit. He could ask the only sect to help him look for it.

“Who doesn’t know...”

Wu Qingcheng had already made up his mind. As he spoke, he looked at the figure surrounded in the middle.

However, before he could finish his words, he swallowed them and a look of astonishment flashed across his eyes.

He pursed his lips.

Why didn’t I think of this? Besides me and Nangong Wudi, he was the only one who dared to provoke these two guys!

Wu Qingcheng thought to himself. His mind was full of thoughts. He didn’t expect that the people of my sect would have a conflict with him the moment he obtained the information about this monster. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“It’s him!”

Wu Qingyan and Wu Qingyan, who were standing behind Wu Qingcheng, were astonished when they saw Wang Xian who was surrounded in the middle.

“Princess Qingyan, it’s this guy. This disrespectful guy actually dares to insult you, Princess!”

Wu Qingyan exclaimed in surprise, causing Tian Qingguang and Tian Qingyuan from the Divine Light Empire to move their eyes slightly. They quickly walked over and pointed at Wang Xian.

“Hehe, so this guy has provoked Princess Qingyan before. That’s great. I’ll get rid of this piece of trash today!”

Young Master Tian revealed a faint smile on his face and gestured to the disciples of the Solitaire sect.

“No!”

“No!”

“No!”

However, just as young master Tian finished his sentence, three voices of rejection came from the mouths of Wu Qingyan and Wu Qingyan!
