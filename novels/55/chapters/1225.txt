“HMM? The game is over. It seems that the eighth prince has the upper hand this time!”

“The eighth prince has teamed up with the people of the nine star dynasty to eliminate one of the battle teams of the second prince. I didn’t expect that the eighth Prince would have the upper hand this time!”

“That young man is going to be finished. He will be the sacrifice between the two princes!”

“Why does it look like the second prince isn’t worried about that young man? Could it be that the young man has a way to deal with him?”

“A way? Could it be that he can deal with the experts of the Nine Star Dynasty? There’s an existence at the first level of the profound void tier!”

The surrounding people saw the final situation and discussed in low voices.

In the Light Dragon Dynasty’s Prince Assessment, the princes could fight each other, but there was a very strict rule that only subordinates could fight. Brothers and sisters were absolutely not allowed to kill each other.

This was a rule that had been passed down from the Light Dragon Dynasty. No matter how many of the Princes’subordinates died, the dynasty would not care about it. However, there must not be any casualties between the princes.

Once a prince offended them, the punishment would be more severe than expected.

The selection of the crown prince was absolutely fair and impartial. With all the forces of the Light Dragon dynasty watching over them, there would definitely not be any injustice.

However, the competition between the princes was also very intense. For example, if they were to fight now, apart from the two princes, no one could guarantee that they would be able to survive.

They would usually not fight until the end.

The eighth Prince also saw this point. Therefore, even though he was not as strong as the second prince, he still dared to fight against him.

“Don’t worry, we will definitely not let him off. Do It, everyone, do it!”

The chubby young man Jiuquan Liang looked at Yin Xianfeng. He responded with a ferocious expression and looked at Wang Xian sinisterly.

“You Want to kill me? You wanted to kill me just now. In a while, I will tear you into pieces and make you wish you were dead. Haha!”

A twisted smile appeared on his face as he roared loudly.

Just now, he had experienced a life-and-death situation. If not for the sudden appearance of the eighth prince, he might have already died.

Everything was because of this fellow. It was all because of him that he almost caused his own death.

Now, it was time for him to take revenge. He wanted to make his life worse than death!

“Good, good!”

Yin Xianfeng looked at Jiuquan Liang with a smile on his face. Then, he fixed his gaze on Wang Xian.

The eighth Prince looked at this scene with a smile.

Just like the discussions of the people around him, he had won this game.

With the help of the power of the nine stars dynasty, he could kill one of his second brother’s powerful subordinates.

As for the young man who could defeat Yin Xianfeng, he didn’t care about him at all. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

His only opponents were the other princes. As for their subordinates, he didn’t care about them at all.

He could kill a person with no background as he pleased!

“Attack!”

The nine stars Dynasty’s insightful void martial artist stared at Wang Xian and gave the order to attack in a deep voice.

In the surroundings, the weapons of the nine stars Dynasty’s experts instantly gathered together to attack.

“Hehe, do you really think that I’m so easy to bully?”

Wang Xian saw that everyone around him had a look of death on their faces, and a hint of mockery appeared in his eyes.

“Die!”

Just as he finished his sentence, the experts from the nine stars dynasty around him attacked Wang Xian directly.

Wang Xian stood there, and the mockery in his eyes became even more intense!

“Roar!”

Just as the attacks were about to land on Wang Xian, a low roar was heard.

An earthy yellow energy covered Wang Xian completely.

The attacks, including those from a half-step void interpretation stage powerhouse, did not even cause a ripple when they landed on him.

“Huh?”

Everyone was slightly stunned and revealed a look of astonishment on their faces.

The people from the nine stars dynasty, Yin Xianfeng, and the eighth prince were also slightly surprised. They quickly looked towards the dragon and Phoenix grocery store.

“Roar! Roar!”

At this moment, another low roar was heard. The voice was extremely dull and rang in everyone’s ears.

Everyone was slightly shocked. Even the nine-star Dynasty’s insightful emptiness realm expert’s pupils shrunk slightly.

A ferocious beast walked out from the store. It was three meters tall and its body was flashing with purple lightning. It had two huge fangs and looked extremely ferocious.

Its eyes were blood-red. It swept its cold gaze across everyone around and slowly walked towards Wang Xian.

However, this was not the end.

When the ferocious lightning beast walked out, a turtle-like creature that was three meters in size crawled out.

Its entire body was blood-red and was filled with a strong murderous aura.

Everyone was familiar with this ferocious beast, the blood evil turtle.

Similarly, it walked straight towards Wang Xian.

The two ferocious beasts were very fast. In the blink of an eye, they arrived beside Wang Xian, one on the left and one on the right.

They raised their heads slowly and stared at the group of people who were attacking Wang Xian.

“Hiss!”

At this moment, Long Xiaotian, who was beside Wang Xian, inhaled a breath of cold air.

Bai Qingshan, the Elder, and the group of people riding the black shadow leopard beside Long Xiaotian widened their eyes slightly. They stared at the two ferocious beasts in disbelief.

Ling Zilin, they all knew that it was a ferocious beast at the first level of the Seethrough realm.

As for the blood evil tortoise, this was the first time they had seen it.

The level of this blood evil tortoise was very familiar to those who had stayed in the human-demon graveyard for a long time. This was because the blood evil tortoise had appeared in the Sea of the human-demon graveyard.

A blood evil tortoise at the first level of the Seethrough realm.

Another blood evil tortoise at the first level of the Seethrough realm.

Including Ling Zilin, there were a total of two subordinates at the first level of the Seethrough realm.

This was simply too crazy.

Long Xiaotian’s eyes flickered as he looked at Wang Xian. He exchanged a glance with Bai Qingshan and the elder beside him. Both of them could see the shock in each other’s eyes.

A month ago, Wang Xian only had one ferocious beast of the first level of the Seethrough realm. However, a month later, he obtained another ferocious beast of the first level of the Seethrough realm.

Moreover, this blood evil turtle was obviously obtained from the Sea of the demi-human graveyard.

In just a short month, he had an additional ferocious beast pet of the first level of the Seethrough realm under his command. This made long Xiaotian feel ashamed.

He was the Prince of the Radiant Dragon Dynasty. The strength of his subordinates was not even as strong as Wang Xian’s two pets.

“This thigh is really thick and strong!”

A hint of excitement flashed across long Xiaotian’s eyes as a smile appeared on his face.

“What is that?”

At this moment, everyone’s attention was focused on the two ferocious beasts beside Wang Xian.

The earthy yellow defense earlier was clearly released by the blood evil turtle. They were almost certain of the blood evil turtle’s strength.

The first level of the Void Interpretation Stage!

As for the other one, although he didn’t exude his aura, he was able to walk out together with the blood evil turtle.

Presumably...

Everyone’s faces turned solemn gradually.

The pupils of the Seethrough realm expert from the nine stars Empire shrunk slightly. Clearly, he had thought of this as well.

“Do you really think that I am someone that you can kill as you please?”

Wang Xian looked at them with a mocking expression.

“Kill them!”
