Chapter 2911: had the power of the Dragon Palace on its back

Boom! Boom! Boom

Wave after wave of terrifying attacks came.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

However, the roars of countless demons in front of them were still extremely terrifying.

“Attack!”

The sound of orders came from the side.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

A deafening sound was heard. A shell that was dozens of kilometers in size flew into the front and formed a mushroom cloud in the air in front of them. It looked extremely terrifying.

However, those demonic beasts were also exuding an incomparably terrifying might. The dozens of demonic beasts in front could even withstand the attacks of the artillery shells.

The speed of their retreat was not very fast. However, according to the bombardment of the artillery shells and the attacks of the countless soldiers on the platform, they should be able to retreat safely.

“Not good, junior brother invincible. Quick, look at master. The two first level divine emperor abyss seeds that flew out from the Demon Cave are attacking Master.”

At this moment, second senior sister pointed at the void in front of her with a panicked expression and said to invincible battle technique.

Invincible battle technique looked over and his expression sank slightly.

“F * ck, where’s their Veluriyam’s trump card? Isn’t Veluriyam very strong?”

“Take out your trump card and supreme treasure to F * ck this bunch of demons?”

Invincible battle technique roared with an embarrassed expression.

He hesitated for a moment and flew directly toward the center of the third division of the fighting ring.

“Junior Brother Invincible.”

Second senior sister’s expression changed as she followed closely behind.

“Group commanders, quick, quick, quickly take out your trump cards and leave this place. If you guys are any slower, your group commanders will die.”

“F * ck, can’t you guys retreat faster?”

Invincible flew to the center and looked at the group commanders who were attacking from afar. He urged them with an embarrassed expression.

“You…”

The group of commanders saw invincible flying over and shouted, their expressions ugly as they stared at him.

“Pull him to the side, a piece of trash, how can he command and question us.”

One of the commanders looked at the situation before him and roared angrily. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“The two of you, go to the side and wait, or you can escape and not disturb our Lord.”

The two undying undying level 9 warriors immediately pulled on invincible, their auras locked onto him, his entire body reeking of blood.

They coldly warned invincible.

“Damn, take out your trump cards, either help the commander, or leave quickly.”

Invincible’s expression was ugly as he cursed.

“Punk, if you don’t know anything, don’t cause trouble here. If you weren’t the disciple of the deputy commander, we would have dealt with you long ago!”

The two undying level 9 warriors said coldly.

“Brother Invincible, don’t be rash, master will be fine.”

On the side, the 2nd senior quickly said to him.

“I don’t know anything, but I know that you Liu Li are trash, damn, luckily I shamelessly asked boss Wang and the rest for some good stuff.”

Invincible combat technique ignored his senior sister and pointed at the two divine king ninth rank experts.

“Humph, quickly take this fellow away. If he continues to cause trouble, lock him up.”

At the side, a few battle group commanders heard invincible combat technique’s words and ordered with gloomy faces.

Behind them, a group of soldiers also swept over with cold faces.

In a short period of time, the entire Third Army knew about this careless and cowardly fellow.

They did not say anything on the surface, but they cursed him in their hearts from time to time.

If not for the fact that he was the disciple of the vice commander and the vice commander was willing to risk his life for Liu Li, they would have beaten him up a long time ago.

Even if he was the disciple of the other divine emperors, he would have been beaten up by now.

“Get lost!”

The two divine King Tier 9 experts lost their patience and shouted coldly.

“Trash Liu Li!”

“I have to do it myself!”

Invincible raised his middle finger and looked at the battlefield. His body moved and he flew forward.

“Invincible Junior Brother!”

Second senior sister saw invincible flying forward and her face changed. She shouted loudly.

“This kid is courting death!”

When the surrounding glazed soldiers heard invincible battle technique’s words, their faces turned extremely dark.

Seeing him flying over, they said coldly.

“Senior sister, don’t follow me. Don’t worry, I will be fine!”

Invincible battle technique said as he waved his arm and a blood-red cloth covered his body.

“Grandpa Tianchen, I hope you didn’t lie to me.”

He patted the venerable mark on his body and said as he waved his arm again.

“Roar Roar!”

A low roar was heard and Long Ji appeared directly beside him.

“Big Brother Duan Jinming, you are the most honest. You Won’t lie to me.”

Invincible continued to say as he waved his arm and a water droplet cannon appeared beside Long Ji.

“Dragon armament, control the water droplet cannon and open up a path of life and death for this young master!”

Invincible stood on top of the Dragon Armament’s head and commanded loudly with a thought.

“Weng!”

The dragon armament waved its arm and controlled the thousand meter large water droplet cannon.

The water attribute law divine stones that were prepared beforehand were all placed inside.

“Go, get closer to my master!”

Invincible roared loudly.

“Buzz!”

The dragon mechanical body moved and directly flew towards the sky in front of them.

“Senior sister, take down this scene of me being valiant and invincible!”

Invincible battle technique turned his head and shouted loudly at his second senior sister.

“That Guy’s brain really has a problem!”

On the platform, all the soldiers said disdainfully when they saw invincible battle technique actually flying over at this time.

In front of them were hundreds of millions of demons. If they flew over at this time, they would certainly be attacked by countless demons.

Only a few thousand demons attacked, and that annoying guy was not even left with a dregs.

Even a peak-stage godly king expert would die if he flew over at this time.

“Although this junior brother of mine is afraid of death, he’s not stupid. He has such a good relationship with the Dragon King, so maybe he has some treasures.”

Second senior sister looked very embarrassed as she watched invincible in battle fly over. She could only comfort herself in her heart.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

As expected, just as invincible in battle flew about 50 million kilometers away, countless demons noticed them.

In front of them, two demons at the peak of the godly monarch realm let out an angry roar at the same time and attacked him directly.

Behind him, hundreds of thousands of Yao Xie also attacked. The terrifying energy completely covered the starry sky.

“That kid will probably die if he doesn’t run now!”

“With that Trash’s character, he will definitely run away immediately!”

On the platform, everyone could see clearly that Yao Xie had launched an attack and said coldly.

Several battle group leaders also watched indifferently.

“How dare you attack me!”

“With your back against the Dragon Palace, your magical power is boundless. Water drop cannon, Attack!”

Seeing Yao Xie attacking him, invincible battle group was furious and shouted loudly.

“Weng! Hualala!”

The sound of Raindrops came from the water drop cannon.
