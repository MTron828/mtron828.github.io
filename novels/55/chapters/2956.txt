Chapter 2957

“An lie, how far can you teleport now?”

Sky array stared at an lie and asked.

“I’m too weak. I can only teleport around 100 million kilometers. But when I teleport to 100 million kilometers, I can teleport another 100 million kilometers. If I want to cross the entire glazed domain, it will only take me a few seconds!”

An lie opened his mouth and said excitedly.

!!

This speed was heaven-defying!

“Then, if you want to kill someone, you can come to me with a thought and kill me instantly?”

Wang Xian stared at him.

This ability was too heaven-defying!

He could do anything with a thought, but he couldn’t do it at all.

He wanted to launch an attack. With a thought, he condensed his own energy and released it. It required a process.

However, he didn’t need a process at all.

There was only the beginning and the end.

“If you evolve into a thorned dragon, wouldn’t you be able to defy the heavens?”

Wang Xian stared at him and said again.

“Dragon King, there’s no such thing as a good thing. If I evolve into a thorned dragon, my energy will disappear!”

“Furthermore, I realized that it would be difficult for me to improve in the future.”

Speaking of leveling up, an Lie’s expression fell.

“If I want to level up, I need to absorb the energy on the altar. Without it, I can never level up, I can never train!”

His expression changed.

His current teleportation was too heaven defying, however it seemed very difficult to level up.

Only the altar’s energy could improve it. Without it, he would always be in the immortal King Realm.

At this realm, his lifespan was less than a million.

“Is that so? But this is normal. Your ability is too heaven-defying. Even among the top races in the universe, there isn’t such a terrifying ability!”

Wang Xian said.

“But Dragon King, I can feel that there are many, many coordinates in my mind. There are so many that I can’t count them. I can teleport over with just a thought.”

At this moment, an lie spoke again.

“There’s such a situation?”

Wang Xian and the rest were slightly shocked.

“There are countless coordinates in your mind. This means that there are altars there or they are man-made summoning altars. If they are altars, you can absorb energy to evolve.”

The sky array said to him.

An lie nodded.

“Why don’t you teleport there to try?”

Tian Chen continued.

“I can sense that the nearest coordinates are the chimei territory in front of me. I don’t know where the others are.”

An lie said.

“Teleport there and then teleport back. With your reaction power, unless you’re an existence above the celestial emperor, you won’t be able to stay!”

Heaven’s formation said to him.

“Then I’ll give it a try. Go to the distant coordinates.”

An lie hesitated for a moment before his figure disappeared.

However, just as his figure disappeared, he reappeared instantly.

Wang Xian and heaven’s formation didn’t manage to react in such a short period of time.

However, at this moment, blood was slowly flowing out of an Lie’s eyes, nose, mouth, and ears. His body was trembling.

“How terrifying, how terrifying, how terrifying! I will never teleport randomly again!”

An lie raised his head and cried out. Blood mixed with tears flowed down.

Although an lie looked extremely comical at this moment, Wang Xian and the heaven’s formation looked at each other and were filled with shock.

When an lie teleported back, they didn’t even have the time to react. On the other hand, an lie had suffered a terrifying attack.

To be able to injure an lie in such a short period of time, what kind of existence was he?

He was definitely above the celestial emperor.

“An lie, what did you see?”

Wang Xian asked him.

“I didn’t see anything. I only felt a pair of eyes looking at me. Luckily, I escaped fast enough. Oh My God, I was scared to death!”

“I won’t teleport randomly in the future even if I’m beaten to death!”

An lie shouted while still in shock.

“I feel like a pair of eyes are looking at you.”

Wang Xian inhaled a breath of cold air as his heart trembled.

Such an existence was definitely a top-notch expert in the universe.

“Your injuries aren’t too serious. It’s fine.”

Wang Xian comforted him.

“It’s fine, it’s fine. It’s all thanks to your blessings, Dragon King!”

An lie nodded and recovered. At the same time, he flattered him.

“Don’t teleport to the coordinates that are far away. Go to those coordinates in the chimei domain and take a look. Are there many coordinates in the chimei domain?”

Wang Xian instructed him.

“Ah, Dragon King, I, I, I…”

“The chimei domain is not dangerous to you at all. Based on your reaction, if the god Emperor wants to kill you, you can escape easily unless you know where you will appear in advance and release your attacks in advance.”

Wang Xian interrupted him and said to him.

“I will do my best!”

An lie nodded his head heavily and squeezed out a smile. “Dragon King, we have conquered the chimei region. How about I absorb all the altar energy there?”

“I will give you half. The Dragon Palace needs to nurture another person with abilities like you. There are still quite a number of people like you in the Dragon Palace.”

Wang Xian told him the truth.

“Dragon King, this is a rare exception in the universe. I’m a genius that is one in a billion and an existence that can not be replicated. It doesn’t mean that someone who is infected by the altar’s energy after consuming the womb fruit can have a physique like mine.”

An lie said unwillingly.

“Alright, Alright, let’s Get to work!”

Wang Xian patted him on the shoulder.

“It’s the Dragon King. There are more than 10,000 altar coordinates in the chimei region. I’ll report to you one by one!”

An lie said with a bitter face.

“Take this with you. As long as you reach a Demon Cave, you’ll be able to scan the surrounding demonic powers within a second!”

The sky array gave him a compass and said to him.

“Yes, I promise to complete the mission!”

An lie nodded and disappeared in an instant. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“An Lie’s ability is really abnormal. Although he is only at level nine immortal king, he should be able to instantly kill an unprepared peak king God!”

Wang Xian said.

“If the god Emperor wasn’t prepared, he would be able to severely injure him with a sharp weapon. However, once he is prepared, he wouldn’t be able to break through the defense.”

The Heaven Array nodded slightly.

“The energy from the altar in the Chimei region should be able to help him improve.”

Wang Xian said as he waited there quietly.

“TSK TSK Tsk, my speed is simply invincible. Those bunch of silly demons can’t even see my shadow. hahaha!”

Four minutes later, an Lie’s voice sounded.

Beside the altar, an lie walked over with his head slightly raised. He was filled with pride.

It was as if he wasn’t the one who was bleeding from his seven orifices not long ago.

“Dragon King, this is the information that I have collected. Hehe!”

An lie handed over the communication stone plate of the Heaven Formation.

Wang Xian immediately took it and looked at the information recorded on the communication stone plate.

“This is?”

When Wang Xian and the Heaven Formation looked over, they were slightly stunned.

There were 15 black dots on it.
