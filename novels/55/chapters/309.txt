Chapter 310: Spiritual Island On The Sea

“Thank you, young master, for your kindness!”

Beside the cauldron, the six disciples of Sui Family, whose eight extraordinary meridians had been cleared by Wang Xian, kneeled on the floor respectfully and expressed their gratitude.

Around them, after seeing their seniors had stood up to thank Wang Xian, the other members knew that they had to do the same.

Therefore, they stood up one after another and said loudly, “Thank you, young master, for your kindness!”

Wang Xian who was sitting beside Sui Huang waved his hand plainly. Following which, he turned to Sui Huang and said, “Old Sui, those are Meridian Clearing Beads that I went through great lengths and dangers to get!”

“Alright, alright. I know what you are after, rascal!” Sui Huang gave him a glare before continuing, “Follow me back after this. I’ll let you take a look at the Arts of Refining Elixir Pills.”

“Thank you, Old Sui!”

Wang Xian smiled, as he’d gotten something he wanted without giving up anything. Nope! He did give up something. Other than putting up a show, he exhausted some dragon energy.

Hehe!

Wang Xian was thrilled. By showing kindness to the Sui Family in this manner, Sui Huang wouldn’t be stingy considering his personality.

After all, he had increased the numbers of Inborn experts in Sui Family by six. This wasn’t a small gift.

“Alright, I believe you guys have seen the problem today. I don’t wish to see this again!” Sui Huang instructed the members of the Sui Family.

The performance of the fourth and fifth generation of the Sui Family was really terrible. This had infuriated Sui Huang.

However, the gift Wang Xian took out was indeed able to make up for some of these weaknesses. This was also the reason why Sui Huang agreed directly to allow Wang Xian to take a look at the Arts of Refining Elixir Pills.

“Who’s the young man with our Laozu? He’s really incredible. The ball he spat out from his mouth could actually turn into a divine dragon that even Inborn experts couldn’t withstand!”

“The ability to heal the injuries on everyone with a wave of his hand is really amazing. If he can sit beside our Laozu, he must be at the same level as our Laozu!”

“At the same level? Oh gosh! He’s so young and yet he’s already at the same level as our Laozu?”

“Unbelievable superpower! That’s what a real expert is!”

As the ceremony ended, the group saw their Laozu leave with Wang Xian. The disciples of the Sui Family were whispering fervently and were clearly in awe.

Even the second generation of the Sui Family had to look at the figure in fear and respect as they sighed. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Wang Xian could hear the constant compliments and worship of the Sui Family’s disciples behind him. Subconsciously, he revealed a faint smile.

He followed behind Sui Huang and arrived at a cave enthusiastically.

“This is the book recording the Arts of Refining Elixir Pills. I’m only allowing you to read for a night!”

Within a cave, Sui Huang took out a simple looking book made of parchment paper. On the parchment paper, dense ancient text was written all over.

Luckily, what was comforting was that there were various papers slotted in between the parchment sheets. These were the explanations for the ancient text.

“Alright. Thank you, Old Sui. I’ll give you a godly elixir pill after I refine them!” Wang Xian laughed. After informing Guan Shuqing, Xiao Yu and the rest, he took up the Arts of Refining Elixir Pills and started going through them.

Puff!

I hope it works!

Wang Xian took a deep breath.

If he could extract dragon energy from spiritual medicine, he should be able to do the same for elixir pills. Going further based on what Sui Huang had explained, an elixir pill had ten times the effects of spiritual medicine.

That would mean that the dragon energy within the elixir pill was at least several times that of the spiritual grass.

In that case, refining an elixir pill could also allow him to increase his strength level quickly.

Furthermore, although he was able to raise dragonians rapidly to the Inborn Realm, it would be extremely difficult for him to raise them to the Dan Realm.

Even if he wished to help, it wouldn’t work.

Therefore, if he could refine powerful elixir pills and if he had the ability to breed spiritual grass and medicine, he could raise the strength level of dragonians to the Dan Realm rapidly or even to a higher level.

Wang Xian flipped through the Arts of Refining Elixir Pills slowly as he memorized each word on it.

[Ding! Grasped the Arts of Refining Elixir Pills.]

After five hours, the notification of the system sounded in his mind. Wang Xian revealed a faint smile.

Arts of Refining Elixir Pills: Alchemist Apprentice (Refine All Elixir Pills In The World With The Origin Source Flame)

Wang Xian looked at his personal attributes through the system and noticed a new “Arts of Refining Elixir Pills” under his “Art of Cultivation.”

Moreover, the introduction of his Arts of Refining Elixir Pills looked much stronger.

Refine All Elixir Pills With The Origin Source Flame!

I wonder how strong the Arts of Refining Elixir Pills is. However, I’m just an Alchemist Apprentice at this moment. Should I try to refine some elixir pills?

Level 3 elixir pills and below would not require an alchemy furnace to refine. However, it would still require a fire attribute cultivator.

It’s a shame that I do not have any spiritual grass or medicine with me currently. I’ll find time to give this a try after I get back! Wang Xian thought to himself.

The entire Arts of Refining Elixir Pills was written on thirty to forty pages of parchment paper. Other than the first few pages which introduced the method of refining elixir pills, the rest were all elixir pill recipes.

An elixir pill recipe was very important to an alchemist. Without an elixir pill recipe, it would be extremely difficult for one to refine elixir pills by self-discovery.

Wang Xian looked through it for the entire night. Along the way, he visualized the process. Finally, he had completely memorized all the contents on the parchment paper.

“Brother Wang Xian, how are you doing?” The next morning, Sui Huang smiled radiantly as he walked into the cave and asked Wang Xian.

“Understood and digested completely. A grandmaster alchemist is about to surface in this world!” Wang Xian smiled and answered Sui Huang in a joking manner.

“Oh, is that so? It seems like Brother Wang Xian’s Arts of Refining Elixir Pills will be surpassing all that comes before you and you will soon rule the world with it!” Sui Huang replied with a little sarcasm.

Hehe.

Wang Xian smiled and handed the parchment book back to Sui Huang. “We will be returning back home today. Old Sui, do you want to go back with us?”

“I’ll return tomorrow. I still have some family matters to handle!” Sui Huang answered and shook his head.

Wang Xian nodded his head, exchanged some casual words and left the cave.

“Young master!”

At this moment, Mo Qinglong came to him and reported, “Young master, it’s about the dragonians.”

“Oh, what’s the matter?” Wang Xian asked immediately.

They had found the real culprit behind the incident of Mo Ersan and Mo Sanyi previously. However, Wang Xian had instructed Mo Yuan to investigate the source instead of taking revenge immediately.

“One of our brothers found a piece of spiritual land on the sea!” said Mo Qinglong enthusiastically.

“Spiritual land?”

Wang Xian was shocked and felt confused.

“Mo Shiwu found a well-hidden island in the sea. The island has dense spiritual energy on it. Based on his conjecture, it should be the remains of an ancient sect and there should still be treasures on it!”

“However, the island was surrounded by strong marine animals guarding it. The island was also extremely mysterious. Mo Shiwu didn’t find the island by himself. Those that were with him have already informed their families and sects!”

If that was really the ruins of a sect, there might be quite an amount of spiritual medicine in it. It might even have more spiritual treasures!
