Chapter 3026: 3025 was intimidating

“What the F * CK, is the information on the universe’s AI called the Dragon Palace True?”

“Hiss, look at those corpses. They are all the corpses of the brain and ancient rare race experts. I know one of them. He’s an elder of the ancient rare race!”

“It’s true. Look at the information on the ancient rare race and the brain race. It’s completely blown up. People are panicking now. I didn’t expect that the Dragon Palace was the one who did it!”

“The Dragon Palace has been assassinating some domain-level races recently. What is the purpose of this? They said that those who invade the Dragon Palace will be killed even if they are far away. What did the two domain-level races do?”

“It’s crazy. They actually assassinated more than a thousand god-emperor experts from the two domain-level races. Moreover, they even have eighth-level god-emperor experts. Does the Dragon Palace want to intimidate them and establish their might?”

“This dragon palace is so terrifying. Are they all professional assassins? They actually killed a celestial thearch powerhouse from a planet without making a sound. This is too terrifying!”

Not long after Wang Xian and the rest returned to the Dragon Palace, a piece of information on the universe’s AI caused a stir in this star field.

The information was released by the Dragon Palace. It directly stated that anyone who violated the Dragon Palace and those who violated the rules in the Dragon Palace’s territory would receive revenge from the Dragon Palace, regardless of which faction they belonged to!

Below, there were pictures that made one’s scalp tingle.

They were the corpses of ancient rare race and brain spirit race experts.

The corpses of level eight divine emperor experts.

Level eight divine emperor experts did not exist in many races, yet they were easily assassinated by the Dragon Palace.

This information immediately caused a huge sensation.

This was not only the assassination of level eight divine emperor experts, but also the Dragon Palace’s unconcealed assassination and provocation of the brain spirit race and ancient rare race.

It was clearly a warning to the two great domain level races.

Perhaps, it was also a warning to the other powerful races.

On the universe’s AI, countless people were discussing, and the news quickly spread to all the races near the Mo Han clan’s domain level races.

“Damn the Dragon Palace, they actually killed the 13th Elder and the others, this is completely a provocation to us!”

At this moment, the experts of the brain spirit clan were furious.

They had been on guard against the assassination of the young clan leader, but the thirteenth elder was still assassinated.

The Thirteenth Elder was at the core of the Purple Fire Planet.

That place was extremely secretive. Only the clan members with higher statuses in the clan knew about it.

How did the Dragon Palace Know About It?

“The Dragon Palace should have powerful magic tools and a group of experts who are good at assassination.”

The head of the brain spirit clan, who was sitting in the center, looked extremely gloomy at this moment.

Even when his son was killed, he was not so embarrassed.

What did it mean that the Dragon Palace could assassinate the experts of their clan again and again? L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

It meant that the other party had powerful assassination methods.

This kind of method was not something that their brain spirit race could withstand.

If the other party continued to assassinate them…

At the thought of this, the brain spirit race patriarch frowned and his expression changed.

“Assassins? They are able to assassinate the clansmen of our god-emperor members so strangely and quickly. Could it be that they have grasped a powerful sorcery and used the bloodline of our clansmen?”

An expert from the brain spirit race said with a slight fear in his heart.

“No matter what, this dragon palace is very troublesome and difficult to deal with. They didn’t continue the assassination and even publicly announced it on the universe’s AI to intimidate us. They might also be afraid that we would be caught dead!”

“But I have to say that this deterrence has worked!”

The Brain Spirit Race’s clan leader said in a deep voice.

“Clan leader, are we just going to let it go? We didn’t get the Divine Dragon, and now the Dragon Palace has killed so many clansmen!”

An elder said unwillingly.

“Before we find the Dragon Palace’s Nest and destroy the Dragon Palace, let alone the brain spirit clan, I’m afraid those domain level clans won’t dare to offend the Dragon Palace!”

The Brain Spirit clan leader said with a dark face.

The experts of the brain spirit clan frowned and didn’t say anything.

“Let me inform the old clan leader!”

The brain spirit clan leader said helplessly.

…

At this moment, not only the brain spirit clan, but the experts of the ancient rare race also looked gloomy and embarrassed when they saw the information released by the Dragon Palace.

Even if the Dragon Palace announced it, they didn’t dare to take revenge.

Deterrence, a powerful deterrence.

They didn’t dare to take revenge rashly, otherwise, it would be a disaster for the ancient rare race.

Before they had a way to deal with the assassination from the Dragon Palace, they couldn’t take any excessive revenge.

The other domain-level races also received the news at the first moment.

After the domain-level experts discussed, they immediately sent messages.

“Oh?”

“Oh?”

Soon, the experts within the resplendent starry sky received the messages from their clans. Their expressions changed slightly.

“What powerful assassination methods. How did they do it? Witchcraft? Or what?”

The rank nine and peak divine emperor experts looked at this message and muttered.

“It seems that before we find the Dragon Palace’s lair and have no way to deal with the assassin, it’s best to keep a low profile. It’s best not to anger the Dragon Palace. Otherwise, the gains will not make up for the losses.”

The race experts muttered.

They had already made up their minds.

…

“Hehehe, Dragon King, the ancient rare race and the brain spirit race didn’t dare to say anything when we posted such information on the universe’s AI. It seems that they are really afraid!”

In the Dragon King Palace located in the Dragon Palace, the leaders of eight Qi and the others looked at some of the information on the AI and said with a smile.

“Before they find our base of operations, they shouldn’t dare to offend US AGAIN!”

Wang Xian said.

The deterrence of the Dragon Palace this time was completely effective.

Poisonous horned dragon species and thorned dragon species. These two were top-notch dragon species when the divine dragon race was at their peak.

In addition, they had the mutated existence, an lie.

With the three of them working together, there was almost no solution to the assassination.

Even if they were to face a powerful primary race in the universe, they would still be able to succeed.

“In the next period of time, our Dragon Palace should be able to calm down, raise our strength, and recuperate!”

Wang Xian said to them in a good mood.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

The leaders of the Dragon Palace nodded their heads.

They had gained a lot from this assassination.

There were five corpses of level eight divine emperors and more than 20 corpses of level seven divine emperors.

In addition, Wang Xian still had a large number of elixirs and divine flowers in his hands.

These resources were enough for him to achieve a breakthrough in his strength.

“After the upgrade, I have to think of a way for the Dragon Palace to gain a foothold in this starry sky!”

Wang Xian thought of the current situation of the Divine Dragon in the center of the universe and frowned slightly.

“Forget it, let’s upgrade First!”

He took out pills one by one and poured them into his stomach.
