“Damn, the second prince is still so domineering. Anyone with a discerning eye can tell that the eighth prince is not a friend of the nine-star dynasty at all. In the end, after saying so much, he was directly dumped by the second Prince!”

“In the beginning, the eighth prince did what he wanted to do casually, but I didn’t expect the second prince to say it so directly. Eccentric? The description is really appropriate!”

When the surrounding people heard long Xiaotian’s cold words and saw the eighth prince’s changed expression, they all smiled.

Even the subordinates behind the eighth Prince felt a little uncomfortable.

In the matter of martial artists, the strong should be the enemy. There was no need to be so eccentric.

“Humph!”

When the eighth Prince Heard Long Xiaotian’s words, his expression also turned cold when he heard the surrounding people’s voices.

“So I didn’t want to shed all pretense of cordiality with second brother. But since you want to say it directly, just say it. That kid behind you has offended a few of my friends!”

As he spoke, he looked at Yin Xianfeng and the rest of the six element sect behind him.

“Your Highness, I’m sure you are aware of the enmity between your friend and me. Hehe!”

Yin Xianfeng took a step forward and glared at Wang Xian with hatred. He said word by word, “I want him dead!”

I want him to die!

His killing intent was undisguised. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“He dares to hurt our senior brother Yin. He must pay a heavy price!”

“Today, he must die no matter what!”

Beside Yin Xianfeng, a few of his junior brothers behind him said with killing intent.

“Hehe, eighth brother, can’t you just say what’s on your mind? Why are you beating around the bush for so long?”

Long Xiaotian stared at him coldly. “Let my brother die. It’s not that I look down on you, but you don’t have the strength to do so!”

“Hehe, I admit that second brother is stronger than me, but it’s still easy to kill him!”

The eighth prince narrowed his eyes and looked at the people of the Nine Star dynasty. “You guys go and kill that kid. Leave my second brother to me!”

“HMM?”

The eighth Prince’s words caused the eyes of the people from the nine star empire to flicker. They looked at the second prince and fell into deep thought.

“Don’t worry, he won’t dare to take revenge on all of you. If he does, come and find me. I, Long Xiaoyun, will keep my word!”

When the eighth Prince saw their hesitant expressions, he spoke again.

“Yes, yes, it’s the eighth prince. We agree. Leave Him to us. Leave that damned fellow to us!”

Without waiting for the insightful emptiness realm expert to agree, the fat young man, Jiuquan Liang, quickly replied loudly.

His face was full of muscles and was filled with ferocious excitement.

“Alright, we believe in the eighth Prince!”

When the insightful emptiness realm expert saw that the young prince had agreed, he nodded his head slowly with a cold expression in his eyes.

His eyes were filled with killing intent as he stared at Wang Xian.

“Eighth brother, it seems like you want to fight with Me Now!”

Long Xiaotian frowned slightly and said to him with a solemn face.

“Second brother, with your current strength, you can’t destroy my men. As long as I can restrain your men, that kid will naturally be killed!”

“I promised brother Yin Xianfeng that I would help him kill that kid. I will definitely do it!”

The eighth Prince raised his head slightly and revealed a confident expression.

“Haha, Thank You, Eighth Prince. In the future, I, Yin Xianfeng, will fight for the eighth prince to the death. I wish you the throne!”

Beside him, Yin Xianfeng revealed an excited expression and quickly expressed his loyalty.

“Second prince, no matter what, that Kid Must Die. No one can save him!”

Following that, he looked at long Xiaotian and said with a smile on his face.

After that, he turned his head abruptly and stared at Wang Xian. A ferocious smile appeared on his face.

“No one can protect the people that our eighth Prince wants to kill. The throne belongs to our eighth Prince!”

“Haha, that’s right. A brat. We can kill him if we want to. No one can stop us. The throne belongs to the eighth Prince!”

Behind the eighth prince, his subordinates raised the weapons in their hands and shouted confidently.

“Haha, with all of You Brothers, I also believe that the throne belongs to me!”

The eighth prince laughed loudly and said confidently.

“Do it!”

“Clang, Clang, Clang!”

When he finished speaking, the subordinates behind him pulled out the weapons in their hands.

The eighth Prince looked at the people from the nine stars dynasty.

The nine stars Dynasty’s insightful emptiness realm experts naturally knew what they should do now. At this point, they had no way out.

If they didn’t make a move, they would definitely die.

They didn’t hesitate at all and stared at Wang Xian with murderous intent.

“Second brother, if you dare to help your friend, I will help my friend too. Think about it, even though my subordinates aren’t as strong as you!”

“However, our brothers from the nine star empire are very strong. Hehe!”

The eighth Prince shrugged his shoulders and looked at long Xiaotian with a smile.

“Second Prince, Our Nine Star Empire doesn’t want to be your enemy. I hope you won’t make things difficult for us!”

The insightful void martial artist from the nine Star Empire said faintly.

Long Xiaotian frowned when he saw this scene. The more than 200 subordinates behind him also looked at him.

“Alright, leave it to me!”

Wang Xian patted long Xiaotian’s shoulder and said calmly.

“How is it? Brother Wang Xian, you don’t have to worry. I can protect you!”

Long Xiaotian frowned slightly and asked.

“Are you still worried about me?”

Wang Xian revealed a smile on his face.

Long Xiaotian smiled when he saw Wang Xian’s smile. He immediately raised one of his arms and looked in the direction of the eighth prince.

“Watch them closely. If any of them dares to move, kill them immediately!”

Long Xiaotian shouted loudly.

“Yes!”

The subordinates behind him immediately shouted loudly.

The eighth Prince felt the imposing manner of the other party. Instead, a smile appeared on his face.

“Don’t worry, second brother. As long as you don’t make a move, I will definitely not make a move!”

“Hehe, I thought that second brother would fight with me for the sake of his friend!”

As he spoke, he didn’t forget to hit long Xiaotian’s prestige.

Long Xiaotian’s nonchalant lips curled up slightly. He looked at Wang Xian beside him and a look of confidence flashed across his eyes.

“Kill that fellow for me. Tear him into pieces!”

When Yin Xianfeng saw that the second prince did not make a move, he revealed an excited expression.

As long as the second prince did not make a move, with the strength of the people from the nine stars dynasty, the Jedi could easily kill Wang Xian.

Although he could not kill him with his own hands, he would die because he provoked him.

As long as he saw his death, he, Yin Xianfeng, would get his revenge. He was delighted.

The people from the nine stars dynasty narrowed their eyes slightly and gripped their weapons tightly

They stared at Wang Xian and were ready to attack!
