3250 3249 was courting death

“What happened? What happened in the sky above our race?”

“Why did the sky above suddenly turn into nothingness? What Happened?”

In the sky above the main planet of the race, the change in the sky caused a huge change to all the disciples on the planet.

The space beast that suddenly flew towards them suddenly appeared in the nothingness.

Many disciples were shocked.

However, at this time, the void disappeared and dozens of figures appeared.

They were the venerables of the horned seal race.

“Eh? Where are our clan leader and the others? What about the Space Beast?”

The disciples of the horned seal race looked over, their faces full of surprise.

“Sou!”

At this time, the dozens of figures in the sky didn’t give any orders and flew toward the hall of the horned seal race.

Following that, an order was passed down throughout the entire horned seal race, gathering all the resources.

At the same time, among the dozens of people from the horned seal race, a figure that did not belong to the horned seal race was hidden among them.

All the disciples of the horned seal race were unaware of all these changes.

At this moment, in the starry sky not far away from the horned seal race, Wang Xian and the rest were already preparing to rush back.

As Xiao Lan’s little house could not return to the Dragon Palace in an instant, they continued flying back.

“Dragon King, we have obtained over 3,000 corpses of universe knights this time. Among them, there are six at the level of a level five universe knight and 13 at the level four!”

Prime Minister Gui, who was on Xiao Lan’s body, said with a smile.

Out of the 3,000 corpses, there were a total of seven at the level five universe knight level. However, there was one at the level of eight-headed spirit.

These corpses were sufficient for the Dragon Palace to receive a huge upgrade.

Other than these corpses, the sky array was currently located at the eighth level. Next, they began to search for a group of universe God kingdoms.

Other than that, there were also a large number of resources from the horned seal race and the Snake Lady Race.

“I wonder if these resources are enough to increase my strength!”

Wang Xian stood at the side, his eyes shining.

If he could increase his strength this time, it wouldn’t be as simple as increasing one level.

Instead, it would directly increase his combat strength from a level five universe knight to a level seven universe knight.

“Those two space beasts are back!”

Little Blue was flying in the starry sky. The two old men were shocked when they felt the aura in front of them.

They thought they had lost the two space beasts, but they didn’t expect them to come back.

They looked at each other excitedly.

“How long will it take for the experts of our clan to arrive?”

An old man asked with a burning gaze.

“At most 10 minutes. This time, our clan elder is here too. Hahaha, with our clan elder’s help, suppressing these two space beasts shouldn’t be too much of a problem!”

The other old man looked at the universe AI and laughed loudly.

“Looks like our luck isn’t bad. We’ll hold them off until the clan elder and the others arrive!”

As they spoke, their eyes gleamed.

With a wave of their arms, a net of light appeared in front of them.

The two of them looked at the two space beasts that had appeared in their line of sight, their eyes filled with excitement.

Their holy prose clan was considered an extremely powerful existence in the surrounding starry skies.

Suppressing the strongest universe Knight Level 5 Space Beast wasn’t a problem at all.

Once they subdued it, it would be a huge improvement for their holy prose clan!

After all, such a huge and terrifying space beast had an abnormally terrifying strength.

“Be careful!”

“Use the holy net of light to trap it!”

The two of them reminded each other and an incomparably huge net of light headed straight for Xiao Lan.

“Eh?”

At this moment, Wang Xian and the rest, who were on Xiao Lan’s body, were slightly stunned when they saw the huge net of light heading towards them. A cold look appeared in their eyes.

“Get lost!”

Prime Minister Gui looked over and his body moved. He hovered above Xiao Lan’s body and warned the two elders in front of him.

“Eh?”

The two warriors of the Saint Wen Clan who were attacking little blue were stunned, their eyes shining.

“There’s a human on that space beast. That creature is only a level 3 universe knight.”

An old man from the Saint Wen Clan narrowed his eyes, his expression unsightly.

They had been following the space beast for a long time. They had seen the opportunity to subdue it, but they had not expected there to be a human on it.

Was the space beast subdued and suppressed to begin with, or was there something else going on?

“Test their strength. If they are strong, apologize and leave. Don’t expose your identity.”

The two elders from the sacred prose clan were slightly unwilling, and one of them said in a low voice.

“Alright!”

The two nodded, but their movements did not stop. The net of light continued to attack them.

At the same time, their figures were completely covered by the light. Their faces could not be seen clearly.

If the other party was very strong, they would leave immediately.

If there was only one creature floating in the air, they could consider their next move.

“You’re courting death!”

Seeing that they were still attacking them, Wang Xian’s eyes turned cold.

“Woo Woo, Woo Woo!”

Xiao Lan’s eyes were filled with fury. She opened her mouth and let out a low roar.

The next moment, an extremely huge black hole appeared in front of him. His body entered the black hole directly.

“He wants to escape. It seems that his opponent isn’t very strong. Attack!”

When the two elders from the Shengwen clan saw this scene, their eyes glowed as they shouted excitedly.

“Weng!”

However, in the next moment, a black hole appeared beneath them, and an incomparably large mouth began to devour them.

“What! ?”

“Be careful!” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Seeing the black hole appear beneath them in the blink of an eye, and seeing the incomparably large mouth, their expressions changed slightly.

Their bodies moved, wanting to dodge to the side.

However, at this moment, a terrifying suction force appeared, causing their pupils to constrict slightly.

“Wings of light, break free from the shackles!”

The two of them roared at the same time, and a pair of wings of light appeared behind them.

They fled to the side.

“You want to escape? You’re courting death!”

“Hualala!”

However, at this moment, chains attacked them.

The chains instantly wrapped around their bodies.

“Oh no, there’s an expert!”

At this moment, the two elders from the holy prose clan revealed expressions of fear. A bad premonition enveloped their hearts.

“Hualala!”

Their bodies were completely wrapped around, and they directly fell towards the terrifying space beast.
