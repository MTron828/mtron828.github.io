Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

“Mo Qinglong, check on the recent events that happened to Lan Family, and check on the Tyrannical Sword, Liu Family, too!”

Back on the roof at the villa, Wang Xian commanded Mo Qinglong over the phone.

“Yes, Dragon King!”

“What strength do we have now in the Dragon Sect?” Wang Xian continued to ask Mo Qinglong.

“Dragon King, we have 50 Dragonians at level 8 while Mo Yuan is already a Half-step to Inborn!” Mo Qinglong answered.

“Okay, I got it. Have you brought the nine venomous sea snakes back to the sea?”

“Yes, they are safe in the sea now!”

“Great!”

After Wang Xian hung up the phone, he looked at the message sent by Lan Qingyue. He immediately asked, [Are you a willing party in this marriage?]

[Sometimes, you can’t get what you want, and you can’t refuse to do something when you don’t want to!]

About five minutes later, Lan Qingyue gave a double-edged reply.

“I’ll get the things I want, and no one can force me to do something that I don’t want to do. I’ll have control of my own fate!”

Wang Xian stared at the sea in the distance, drawing the corner of his lips.

At the same time, two middle-aged men were standing beside Liu Fei Yun with respect in a manor at Hailing Province.

“Useless things! You’ve got two people, and you can’t even kill a Level 8 Martial Artist,” Liu Fei Yun screamed impatiently at the two middle-aged men beside him.

“Young Master, her swordsmanship is formidable, and she was at the peak of Level 8. We were afraid we might draw attention if we got into a tangle with her for too long!” Both middle-aged men explained with an awful look.

“Oh? Formidable swordsmanship?” Liu Fei Yun drew his lips slightly. “Last night, I finally deciphered the Art of Sword Celestial from the authentic calligraphy of Li Bai and obtained Sword Celestial’s inheritance. Soon, I’ll become a Level 8 Martial Artist. I would like to meet and spar with the lady you said to be strong in her swordsmanship. However, I’m too busy lately, and I don’t have the time to play with them!”

“Young Master, you obtained Sword Celestial’s inheritance. I’m sure you’ll make it to the Outstanding Young Heroes Chart one day and overlook the rest of the heroes!” The two of them quickly flattered him as they were shocked.

“Haha, of course. Outstanding young heroes. My Tyrannical Sword and I will ascend to the top!” Liu Feiyun laughed.

“Congratulations, Young Master!” Both of them quickly licked his boots again.

“Hmph, he’s just a Miracle Doctor ranked 18. Both of you will make a trip with Butler Zhao and Liu San the night after tomorrow. You must kill them for me. Otherwise, don’t come back,” said Liu Feiyun coldly.

“Yes, Young Master. We’ll deliver his head to you!” the two middle-aged quickly answered.

Liu Fei Yun waved his hand and smirked. “Wang Xian, Miracle Doctor Wang, and you, Lan Qingyue. If it were not for your billions worth of assets, do you think the Liu Family would go all the way to help you out? You are just a plaything to me. Since a plaything is not obedient, I’ll make sure you listen to me!”

Liu Fei Yun displayed a haughty look. With the inheritance of Sword Celestial, he would become one of the most formidable Sword Celestials in the world soon.

Two days passed.

These two days, Guan Shuqing had been resting while Wang Xian was waiting quietly in the villa.

The school would open tomorrow, and Wang Xian took a month’s leave.

“Dragon King, the information you wanted is here!” In the afternoon, two figures jumped up to the roof like ghosts when they reported to Wang Xian under the beach umbrella.

Wang Xian reached and took the information.

It was about Tyrannical Sword Liu Family and Lan Family.

“One Inborn Expert, four Half-step to Inborn Experts and 13 Level 9 Martial Artists. No wonder they are the first-class force!” Wang Xian squinted his eyes as he read Liu Family’s information.

The entire document had detailed records of the strength in the Tyrannical Sword Liu Family. The only one that could evenly match with them in the entire Hailing Province was Ancient Fist Sect.

In Hailing Province, no one dared to offend Liu Family.

When Wang Xian picked up the information about Lan Family, an invitation card was caught in between the papers.

Wang Xian opened it up. It was an invitation for an engagement party sent by Lan Family to other wealthy families.

His eyes turned cold as he continued to read.

Deep-sea Jewelry and Lan Family had taken a hammering under The Zhou Jewelry and Lingyue Sect just recently.

First, they took a loss in a billion-dollar investment project in Dongqing Province. Next, they were targeted by The Zhou Jewelry.

This caused a huge blow to the Lan Family.

In desperation, Lan Family had to join hands with Liu Family to stand up against The Zhou Jewelry and Lingyue Sect’s hammering.

However, Liu Family requested Lan Qingyue to marry to their family.

“Tomorrow!” Wang Xian stood up slowly. “Liu Family will not be a concern anymore.”

“You may leave!” Wang Xian gestured for them to leave and pondered quietly.

Night fell when Xiao Yu, Guan Shuqing, and Elder Fang were watching soap operas downstairs.

Wang Xian was thinking of his plan for tomorrow. Should he inform Lan Qingyue in advance? Should he ask for Lan Qingyue’s advice?

At about 10 pm, Xiao Yu and the rest went back to their rooms to sleep. Guan Shuqing did not allow Wang Xian to enter her room.

Without any choice, he went to the next room.

Around 11 pm, Elder Fang woke up in her room as she looked at the bells ringing non-stop at the bedside. With a swift movement, she opened her door.

“Elder Fang, let’s do it together!” Just then, a voice came from upstairs. She lifted her chin and saw Wang Xian looking over with a smile.

Elder Fang paused before she nodded.

Wang Xian made a quiet jump into the living room.

Indeed, Miracle Doctor Wang is not that simple! Looking at the way he moved, Elder Fang thought to herself. She had always believed that the mysterious Miracle Doctor Wang was not someone simple.

“Last time, they sent two Level 8 Martial Artists over here. This time, they will definitely send more formidable people over!” Elder Fang reminded Wang Xian.

“Don’t worry. I’ve got everything prepared!” Wang Xian chuckled and looked outside.

Voila!

The door was opened and the four black middle-aged men walked into the villa.

“I have been waiting for you guys for many days. Finally, you guys came!” Wang Xian gazed at the four people in front of him with smiles on his face.

“Hur?” The four black figures hesitated as they swept their watchful gazes around.

“Just the two of them!” a middle-aged man narrowed his eyes and said coldly.

“Kill them, and behead the man!” The middle-aged man in the middle spoke in a cold and harsh tone.

“What’s the hurry? I still want to ask who sent you guys over!” Wang Xian wore a smiley face as if everything seemed like a breeze to him.

“Kill!” However, the quartet did not hesitate at all. With swift movements, they launched an attack at them.

“You are really asking for it!” Wang Xian looked at the four black figures with an icy look.
