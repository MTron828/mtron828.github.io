Translator: 5496903

“I’m just a nobody. That’s why I’m called Nobody!”

“Not long ago, someone called me...”

“Sword Demon!”

On the Heaven’s pride stage, under the gaze of more than 200,000 people, Qian ye looked down at Wang Xian with a dignified expression. Her high and mighty attitude was filled with judgment.

Wang Xian had a cold expression on his face. After he finished his sentence, he waved the demon-free sword in his hand gently.

Buzz

The demon-free sword trembled and activated the heaven-deceiving pearl. The sharp attribute light turned pitch-black immediately.

Just like in front of the sword mansion, a huge amount of pitch-black energy fluctuated and emitted a deep black glow.

When Wang Xian threw away his black robe and wore a mask while holding a black longsword in his hand, the sword glow emitted a deep glow.

Some of the people in the arena paused for a moment, and their pupils slowly dilated.

“Sword Demon? What Sword Demon? You’re just pretending!”

When a young man from the Divine Wind Academy heard Wang Xian’s words, a look of disdain appeared on his face.

You’re a sword demon, and I’m the god of Swords!

“Sword Demon! Sword Demon! Not long ago, someone called me... Sword Demon!”

However, around the arena, a group of people stared at Wang Xian and mumbled.

“Yes, sword demon. He is sword demon. It’s him, it’s really him!”

The surroundings were silent for two seconds before a shocked roar was heard. A middle-aged man was staring at Wang Xian with a face full of shock.

“It’s this set of clothes, the same mask, the same black longsword, and the same sharp longsword at the second level of the void interpretation stage. That’s right, that’s definitely right!”

He stared at Wang Xian and roared.

“Sword Demon? Sword Demon, could it be the sword demon that killed two first level void interpretation stage experts of the Meng clan and over 200 experts of the Meng clan in one move? Oh My God, no way!”

“It’s him, it’s him. This is the first time he appeared at the Sword Mansion. He defeated all the elites of the Meng clan with one person and one sword. Two void interpretation stage experts were killed, and his swordsmanship was extremely terrifying. After that, he was called the Sword Demon!”

“It must be the sword demon, it must be him. Look at Ren Xingchen’s attitude towards him. He is extremely respectful towards him. Back then, the sword demon saved Ren Xingchen’s life!”

More and more voices rang out. Their faces were filled with shock as they roared, expressing the shock in their hearts.

There were not many people who had seen the sword demon with their own eyes. There were only a few thousand people, but there were many who had heard of the name Sword Demon.

After all, one person had killed two insightful void martial artists of the Meng clan. One could imagine his strength.

Those who had seen the figure of sword demon slowly overlapped with the figure in front of them, perfectly overlapping.

Their faces were filled with disbelief. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Sword Demon was actually a nameless prodigy.

He was actually only a 26-year-old youth.

Qian ye had reached the insightful void martial stage at the age of 49, which had already caused a great sensation.

Now, the nameless prodigy was sword demon, the sword demon who had killed two insightful void realm experts by himself.

They felt that it was very unreal.

“Sword demon, I seem to have heard of this name before. He killed two insightful void realm experts by himself. He’s incomparably powerful. He actually...”

When some people heard the exclamations of the people around them, their faces also slightly opened their mouths.

“What the F * ck, nameless is sword demon. Then what the F * ck is Qian Ye? Sword demon killed two insightful void realm experts at the first level!”

“Haha, no one would have thought that Qian ye would reveal her shocking identity and power, standing high and mighty. However, no one would have thought that nameless’s identity would be even more terrifying!”

“This is going to be interesting. Thousand Shadows mercenary group leader Versus Sword Demon. Haha, however, I still have high hopes for sword demon!”

“This year’s top ranker battle is simply more brutal than the previous one. Everyone thought that Qian ye was already extremely terrifying. No one would have thought that nameless would be even more terrifying. He fought two experts at the profound void tier and even killed them. This is a true battle record!”

The crowd was in an uproar.

The identity that nameless revealed was too shocking!

“Cool, this is simply too cool. I just don’t like Qian ye acting cool. Now, let’s see how you can still act cool. Haha, You Even said that nameless is an ant and killed him casually. Haha!”

Some people revealed excited expressions as they stared at the arena with burning eyes.

In the sky above the arena, Qian ye’s expression slowly darkened. Her eyes were sparkling as she stared at Wang Xian below.

It was beyond his expectations. It was completely beyond his expectations.

Sword Demon. This was the first time he had heard of this name. However, from the exclamations around him, he knew the strength of that sword demon.

He had single-handedly killed two powerhouses at the first level of the Seethrough Void Stage!

This...

“I hate it the most. Someone is trying to show off in front of me. Thousand Shadows mercenary group? Hehe, come on, Captain Qian Ye. Kill me, and your thousand shadows mercenary group will become even more famous!”

Wang Xian waved the long sword in his hand and pointed it at Qian Ye. “Strength comes from killing, not from words!”

“Cool, this is so cool. Strength comes from killing, not from words!”

“Awesome, this is the real strong one. Don’t be so cocky, let’s see who’s the real deal!”

“Qian Ye’s expression has started to change. Just now, she kept stepping on the Nameless Heaven’s favorite to show off. Now, she’s acting too big!”

When the crowd heard Wang Xian’s words and saw Qian ye’s expression, some of them mocked him.

To the audience, they didn’t have much of a position to begin with. Whoever was cocky would support them.

“Alright, Alright!”

Qian ye gritted her teeth when she saw Wang Xian’s provocation. There was no way out for him now.

In fact, he had to win this battle. Otherwise, his pretentious act would undoubtedly become a huge joke.

This was also a huge blow to the thousand shadows mercenary group.

“I don’t care if you are nameless or sword demon. I will defeat you under my blade here!”

Qian ye’s body trembled as a terrifying aura emanated from his body.

Sharp lancet blades appeared around him. There were more than a dozen of them.

Each of the lancet blades was emitting a green glow.

Qian ye’s famous weapon, The Lancet Blade, was able to unleash a terrifying attack while controlling more than a dozen lancet blades.

Wang Xian sensed Qian ye’s aura and a look of disdain flashed across his eyes. “I’ll let you make the first move!”

“Arrogant. Do you really think that you can underestimate me, Qian Ye?”

Qian Ye’s face was ice-cold. With a wave of her hands, the lancet blades with strong wind blades flew straight at Wang Xian!

The battle had begun!

Everyone’s heart skipped a beat as they watched this unexpected battle with excitement.

They thought it would be a battle between a half-step void interpretation stage powerhouse. In the end, it turned out to be a battle between two void interpretation stage powerhouses.

Brilliant Sun!

The demon-free sword in Wang Xian’s hand waved gently at the lancet blades.

A combined attack of three attributes.

Under the heaven-deceiving pearl, brilliant sun turned into a ray of black light.

Crack! Crack! Crack

When the two attributes collided, it didn’t explode as expected.

Instead, it was the sound of shattering.
