Chapter 738: 0739 injured (16/20)

Translator: 549690339

The group of Yellow Heaven Immortal sect elders and deacons looked at each other in dismay as they looked at their own crown prince.

This was the first time they had seen their own optimistic crown prince in such a manner.

That overbearing crown prince with terrifying talent who was always optimistic all day had actually squatted on the ground and started crying.

The self-reproach on his face caused their faces to reveal a pained expression.

From the Crown Prince’s words, they could guess a little.

Two half-step immortal god, thirteen infant realm experts, and that terrifying immortal bursting explosive stone. With their crown prince’s strength, he had no way of resisting.

Just two half-step immortal god experts were enough to make it difficult for the crown prince to escape.

Now that their crown prince could escape, it was obviously related to the heavily injured Miss Wang Yu.

They had also heard from elder Feng that the girl’s strength was extremely terrifying and it wouldn’t take long for her to step into the immortal realm.

“Primordial Immortal Sect, you are all courting death!”

Elder Feng’s eyes were ice cold as he growled.

“Immediately activate the highest alert of the immortal sect and prepare for battle!”

An elder with a walking stick said in a deep voice.

“It’s the Great Elder!”

The elders and deacons of the immortal sect immediately responded loudly.

“I’ll contact the sect leader!”

“We must cure this lady, no matter how many pills we consume!”

“Elder Feng, enlighten the Crown Prince!”

The old man with a walking stick gave out orders one after another. In an instant, dozens of yellow heaven immortal sect experts immediately began to carry out their orders.

The Hunyuan Immortal sect had sent out such an expert to kill their crown prince. This was equivalent to declaring war!

The sect leader only had one son, and he was also the future sect leader’s successor of their immortal sect. They couldn’t afford to lose him!

“Dong Dong Dong, Dong Dong Dong!”

The rapid bell chimes resounded throughout Yellow Heaven City and Yellow Heaven immortal sect, ringing incessantly in their ears.

This caused the expressions of everyone in Yellow Heaven Immortal sect and Yellow Heaven City to change drastically.

“Highest alert! Everyone, prepare your weapons!”

A roar resounded throughout Yellow Heaven City. In an instant, everyone entered battle mode!

Highest Alert! Highest Alert!

The actions of the Chaos Origin Immortal sect could already be upgraded to a war between immortal sects.

Everything had to wait for the sect leader to come back and give the order!

“What’s going on? Why Is it the highest alert?”

At this moment, in a street in Yellow Heaven City, elder fan and the people from Thorn sect had a slight change in expression.

“What is the highest alert?”

Elder fan immediately asked the people from the Thorn sect to the side.

“The highest alert means entering a state of battle. A war can break out at any time. This war is the War of the entire immortal sect!”

The people from the Thorn sect said with faces full of fear.

“What happened?”

Elder fan furrowed her brows and her expression changed slightly. She immediately picked up her phone to call Xiao Yu.

However, the call could not get through. This caused her to have a bad premonition!

“I’ll go look for Xiao Yu First!”

Elder fan’s figure moved and flew directly towards the Yellow Heaven Immortal Sect’s location.

The Ten Drakonids not far away also furrowed their brows and hurriedly followed.

“This lady...”

“Is Xiao Yu in your immortal sect?”

“Yes, Miss Xiao Yu and our crown prince are in danger. Miss Xiao Yu is currently recuperating!”

“Bring me there immediately!”

Elder fan followed an elder from the immortal sect to the Medicine Peak. When he saw the pale-faced Xiao Yu lying on the bed, his expression changed slightly!

“Don’t worry, Miss Wang Yu is already fine and is currently recovering. We will use the best medicinal pills to treat Miss Wang Yu!”

An elder in the room saw elder fan enter and immediately walked over to say.

“Let me take a look at her!”

Elder fan’s expression was somewhat awkward, and he walked over with some self-blame in his heart.

Sensing the injuries on her body, he heaved a sigh of relief in his heart.

As both were mutated bone dragons, elder fan knew that Xiao Yu was only heavily injured and was not seriously injured.

His gaze swept past the medicinal pills that contained powerful energy.

These medicinal pills were enough to allow Xiao Yu to recover.

His heart that had been lifted up also relaxed.

“With Xiao Yu’s strength, how could he be injured when he was secretly protected by a half-step immortal God and three infant realm experts! ?”

Elder fan’s gaze swept past Feng Lingtian who was lying on the bed, and he spoke with elder Feng and the others with a gloomy face.

“HMM?”

The Yellow Heaven Immortal Sect’s great elder and elder Feng were slightly surprised when they heard her words!

“Pa! PA! Pa!”

At this moment, drops of blood suddenly dripped onto the ground.

Everyone was stunned. The faces of the elders of the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect changed, and they immediately took out their weapons.

“Strange Demon, are you injured? Show yourselves!”

Elder fan swept his gaze over, and his face changed slightly as he hurriedly said.

“Bzz!”

A strange demon appeared. His body emitted a faint white light. The white light energy slowly dissipated, revealing his true body.

There was a terrifying wound on his body.

Elder fan’s expression changed slightly. He immediately took out pills from his interspatial ring.

“Please give me some pills!”

Elder fan said with a dark expression.

The Yellow Heaven Immortal sect elders beside him all sucked in a breath of cold air when they saw the strange demon. A trace of fear flashed through their eyes.

He was so heavily injured, yet he was still able to hide in the room and not be discovered by them.

The person who shocked him the most was a very strange creature.

“Please Hurry Up!”

A trace of impatience appeared in elder fan’s eyes, and a faint aura emanated from his body.

Everyone was shocked again. They looked at each other and said, “Immediately take the medicinal pills to treat him!”

“Of the four strange demons, only one has appeared. I’m afraid the others have already...”

Elder Fan’s face was dark.

At this moment, she saw Feng Lingtian walking towards Xiao Yu’s bed. Her face was slightly dark as she said, “Feng Lingtian, what exactly has happened to Xiao Yu?”

“Let me tell you!”

Elder Feng looked at elder fan and slowly began to explain.

“Huh?”

Before they could say anything, a voice came from Xiao Yu’s side. Elder fan was stunned and immediately walked over.

“Xiao Yu, are you alright? Are You Alright?”

Feng Lingtian, who was standing at the side, saw that Xiao Yu had woken up and asked with an excited expression.

“Have you escaped? That’s good. Looks like you still have some use!”

Xiao Yu looked at Feng Lingtian and smiled.

“I’m useless. I’m completely useless!”

Feng Lingtian stood there with his head lowered, his body trembling slightly! Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Xiao Yu was stunned for a moment, before squeezing out a smile. “It’s still useful. Without You, we wouldn’t have been able to escape!”

“They are here to kill me. If it wasn’t for me, you wouldn’t have...”

Feng Lingtian lowered his head and said softly.

“Alright, if I didn’t ask you to bring me to play, you wouldn’t have been attacked. Everything is in the past, why are you still acting like a girl!”

Xiao Yu said, amused.

“Xiao Yu, if I had followed you today, you might not have been hurt!”

Elder fan walked over and said to her with some self-reproach.

“Master, why would I blame you? It’s not my fault. I was only hurt a little!”

Xiao Yu smiled.

“I’ll tell your brother about this now!”

Elder fan took out his phone and said.

“No, there’s no need. I’ll tell you when I’m Better!”

Xiao Yu immediately shook his head and looked at his master.

“Three strange demons may have died!”

Elder fan sighed and said.

“Then... Then I’ll tell my brother!”

Xiao Yu was startled and said with some hesitation.
