Chapter 1306: The central figure of 1307’s powerful background

Manager Qian was gone!

Under everyone’s watchful eyes, he was gone just like that.

He was crushed so forcefully that there wasn’t even a corpse left.

Just now, the invincible manager Qian, who even the Heaven Sword Sect was afraid of, was killed directly.

This made everyone feel a little dazed.

Their eyes were wide open and filled with shock.

When Tang Ling ‘er, Tang Feng, Tang Yuan, and the rest saw this scene, they couldn’t help but shiver. They looked at Wang Xian with a hint of fear in their eyes.

“It won’t bring you any trouble, right?”

Wang Xian looked at he yuan and kept the weapon in his hand into his interspatial ring.

“There’s no trouble. I’ll just kill this thing!”

He Yuan shook his head nonchalantly.

“You... you actually dared to kill young master Qian!”

The three experts of the Yan clan who were at the second level of the Seethrough realm looked over. Their faces were filled with shock. They looked at Wang Xian and gritted their teeth as they spoke.

“Oh, that’s right. The two of you should go back and tell your Qian clan that the B * Stard of your Qian clan has recklessly provoked my he yuan’s brother. Kill him immediately. If he dares to take revenge, let him come to the He clan!”

He Yuan looked at the two second rank profound void martial artists and said indifferently, then added, “Also, don’t think about taking revenge. Otherwise, the Qian clan will be the unlucky one!”

He Yuan’s expression was calm and composed.

It was as if manager Qian’s death was like stepping on an ant.

He didn’t care about it at all.

“Cough, cough, cough... He clan... He Yuan...”

The two second rank profound void martial experts widened their eyes, and their pupils constricted slightly. The two of them looked at each other, and a trace of fear flashed in their eyes.

“Young master he, I’m Sorry!”

The two people’s expressions were extremely unsightly, and they bowed to he yuan. With a wave of their arms, they directly grabbed the spatial ring left behind by shopkeeper Qian after his death. Their bodies moved, and they flew out.

When they saw the two second-level profound void martial artists leaving, the surrounding people were stunned again.

“This... they actually... they actually left and even apologized!”

“Oh my God, what is the identity of that young man? Manager Qian, kill him as you wish!”

“That Wang Xian is also very fierce. He didn’t hesitate at all. However, what is the identity of that young man called he yuan? How dare he ignore the Qian family of the third trading company in the world!”

“Another young master with a terrifying identity. One by one, people with powerful forces came to help Wang Xian. Why is Wang Xian’s network so terrifying? What is his identity exactly?”

Everyone around looked at the two young men who were chatting. Their eyes were filled with shock.

“Haha, brother Wang Xian, in the future, be it in the flowing sea region or the vast region, if anyone dares to provoke you, tell me. I will help you!”

Standing in front of Wang Xian, he yuan patted his shoulder in a forthright manner.

“I will remember this favor. Thank you for today!”

Wang Xian smiled. If he yuan was not around today, there might be some trouble.

“It’s a small matter. It’s only right for friends to help each other. Eh, brother Wang Xian, are these two your female confidants? Awesome, Awesome!”

He Yuan shook his head nonchalantly and said to Zhang Fengying and Ling Jian ‘ER.

Wang Xian shook his head speechlessly. “This is Zhang Fengying, my good friend. This is Ling Jian ‘er!”

“She is Miss Ling Jian ‘ER. I heard from Wang Xian that she is your neighbor. From the looks of it now... Hehe!”

He Yuan looked at Ling Jian ‘Er in surprise. “But with your strength, brother Wang Xian, you are a perfect match!”

“I think so too!”

Ling Jian ‘er smiled faintly at the side.

Her words stunned he yuan slightly. He then laughed out loud and gave Wang Xian a thumbs up. “Awesome, Awesome!”

“Alright, Alright. Why did you suddenly become so talkative?”

Wang Xian looked at he yuan speechlessly and said with a smile.

“Hehe, isn’t there a beauty beside you?”

He Yuan chuckled and was very easy-going.

He Yuan was a favored son of heaven with a background. Very few people of the same age could get together with him. If it wasn’t for the fact that he was stronger than him, he might have ignored Wang Xian at the beginning.

However, although he was a little arrogant, he was still a good friend.

However, looking at the group of people who were chatting around, everyone couldn’t help but swallow their saliva.

Everyone present wanted to know what kind of identity he yuan had.

What kind of relationship did Wang Xian have with the mysterious he yuan? Why were they so familiar with him.

“Clan leader Yan, may I ask who that young master he is?”

Tang Feng and Tang Yuan looked at each other. Their faces were filled with fear. They couldn’t help but come to the side of clan leader Yan and asked in a low voice.

Even they wanted to curry favor with manager Qian, the person in charge of the third trading company in the world that even the entire blood flow empire feared.

He had actually been directly killed, and when the two second stage insightful void realm experts of the world trading company heard he Yuan’s words, they didn’t pursue the matter in the slightest. They even directly left after apologizing.

What sort of power was this?

Only then could they directly kill manager Qian without the slightest care and not take it to heart?

“One of the top powers in the vast region!”

Clan leader Yan looked at Tang Feng and Tang Yuan’s cautious expressions and replied with a faint smile.

If they were to make a move today, it would bring great benefits to the Yan clan.

In the future, all the powers in the Liuhai region would know that they were related to the He clan in the vast region.

This made the few people from the Yan clan extremely excited.

“One of the top forces?”

Tang Feng and Tang Yuan’s pupils constricted slightly. Looking at Wang Xian who was chatting with he yuan, their expressions were extremely awkward. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Let’s go, we’ll leave immediately!”

The two of them didn’t hesitate at all. They pulled Tang Ling ‘er and walked out quickly.

At this moment, Tang Ling ‘er didn’t dare to say anything. Her eyes were filled with fear as she walked out.

Even manager Qian was killed. If Wang Xian relied on that young man to kill her, what could the bloodshed empire do?

Would they pretend that this didn’t happen?

The bloodshed empire was still far from the peak of strength in the vast region.

The Liuhai region was just a small third-rate region.

As they watched the people of the bloodshed empire leave with their tails between their legs, the people around them were slightly dazed.

In the end, Tang Ling ‘er, Tang Feng, and the rest still left with embarrassed expressions.

This time, it wasn’t only Ling Jian ‘er who embarrassed them. It was also that Wang Xian.

Everyone realized that they couldn’t provoke that Wang Xian. They definitely couldn’t provoke him.

“Haha!”

Long Xiaotian, who was standing at the side where Wang Xian, he yuan, and the rest were, grinned. He was roaring in his heart excitedly.

Awesome, Awesome!

He didn’t expect he Yuan’s identity to be so terrifying.

In fact, he didn’t expect any of the things that happened today.

It was obvious that the mentor of the divine wind academy who adored Wang Xian was an expert at the Seethrough level.

Ling Jian ‘er, who confessed to Wang Xian.

And he yuan, who had a terrifying background.

Each of their identities were extremely awesome, and their center was Wang Xian.

Wang Xian, is his brother Long Xiaotian!
