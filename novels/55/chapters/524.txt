Chapter 525: Killing Experts From Dong Hua Sacred Sect (2)

Dong Hua Spiritual Ore Mine was situated in the Qilu Mountain Range.

Spiritual Energy had diminished during the ending of the age of Dharma, leaving fewer and fewer Spiritual Ore Mine in the world. Within the territory of China, the only Spiritual Ore Mine was guarded by Donghua Sacred Sect.

And not many ancestral sects knew of the exact location of Dong Hua Spiritual Ore Mine as it was top-secret.

As Omniscient Group and the enemy of Donghua Sacred Sect, Diabolism knew the location of Dong Hua Spiritual Ore Mine very well.

The mechanical sound that had been blasted for the entire day on Dong Hua Spiritual Ore Mine had finally ended at night. Large pieces of heavy machinery were placed in the Spiritual Ore Mine.

Surrounding Dong Hua Spiritual Ore Mine were woods towering at a dozen meters high just to conceal its location.

This place was totally secluded even though houses were built by the side of the Spiritual Ore Mine.

The interior of the houses were simple but luxurious.

Inborn Experts walked out of the houses around the mine, and did their routine checks.

“All clear!” a middle-aged man said with a smile on his face.

“Staying put at this isolated Spiritual Ore Mine really bores me to death. We won’t even get to view the battle between Sect Leader and Emperor Qi from Diabolism!”

Holding a Vajra in his hand, a bald, middle-aged man not far away shook his head and remarked plainly.

“During normal times, it’s fine to have lesser people over here. But it’s the critical period now, and this place needs to be heavily guarded. Isn’t Supreme Old Zhou staying here every day?”

An elder smiled to the bald man as he spoke.

“Hmph, it’s all because of damn Diabolism and Dragon Sect. Otherwise, we wound’t have to keep watch over here every day.”

The bald, middle-aged man swung the Vajra in his hand. “If I see them, I’ll send them to hell. Especially, that Dragon King from Dragon Sect. Goddammit!”

“The Dragon King of Dragon Sect is not our concern. When we settle Diabolism, the Dragon Sect will be easily settled as well.”

The old man replied without any emotion. “But we should not belittle them. After all, they annihilated the Remains. Hence, their strength must be strong.”

“I wonder how a twenty-year-old lad possesses such daunting strength. Do you guys think he chanced upon something great?”

“That’s for sure. The rise of the Dragon King was too fast and furious. He must have inherited some powerful ancient sects’ legacy. After we settle Diabolism, the first thing that Donghua Sacred Sect will do is get rid of Dragon Sect. If we can take over his legacy, it will be another boost to Donghua Sacred Sect.”

“Fancy defeating Hai Jiao at age twenty. What a scary legacy he has. We cannot let him develop further.”

All the Inborn Experts of Donghua Sacred Sect were exchanging conversations.

The bald, middle-aged man with the Vajra suddenly looked around. “If I were the Dragon King, I would come here. Then we could... Heh, heh, trap the beast and slay the dragon!”

“If Dragon Sect found out about this place, they might really come over. But they should be sneaking in for an attack tomorrow. I dare him to come today since all the experts of Donghua Sacred Sect can rush over here in ten minutes. Okay, let’s get some rest now!”

The old man gestured a dismissive wave at the group of people and flitted to one of the rooms.

The bald, middle-aged man shook his head slightly as he placed the Vajra on his shoulder and headed to the room where he was staying.

“Hur?”

At this moment, his body was suddenly stifled as he narrowed his eyes and peered somewhere in front of him. A trace of horror and surprise flashed across his eyes.

“Someone is flying towards us!”

The bald, middle-aged man sounded out softly as he clenched his Vajra tightly while he alerted his companions around him.

“Hur?”

The Inborn Experts who had just reached the porches of their houses were stunned for a moment and looked ahead.

Dong Dong Dong!

The sound of a bell was clearly heard within a radius of a few kilometers around Dong Hua Spiritual Ore Mine.

“Someone is here?”

The disciples of Donghua Sacred Sect walked out from the houses, observing the surroundings with doubts.

“Why would anyone come at this time?”

Within a room in the most central house, Supreme Old Zhou of Donghua Sacred Sect opened his eyes. With a swift move, he appeared outside of the house instantly.

Fifteen Inborn Experts of Donghua Sacred Sect were standing in the air while hundreds of Level 8 and Level 9 disciples were standing below with their eyes fixed ahead.

Old Zhou made a quick move and took the forefront position. He squinted his eyes slightly and peered ahead.

Over there were fifty black figures with scary masks and pairs of black Devil Wings behind them. They were hovering towards them, looking menacing.

“Fifty. They have fifty men!”

The bald, middle-aged man glared ahead with cold eyes and remarked in an icy tone.

“Fifty men?”

The rest of them gazed suspiciously ahead.

“Fifty men? The Dragon Sect!”

“They have devilish attributes. On top of that, they have fifty men. It’s the Dragon Sect, no doubt. They are barging into Dong Hua Spiritual Ore Mine!” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Prepare to fight!”

Cold bellows were heard from everyone, while Old Zhou fixed his gaze on the figure who was in the middle.

He was wearing the same mask and had a similar pair of wings, but Old Zhou could still tell that it was the figure of a young man.

At the same time, he could sense a horrifying aura coming from that young man.

“Dragon King of Dragon Sect, what a surprise. I didn’t expect that you would choose this time to break into our Dong Hua Spiritual Ore Mine!”

There was a flash of cold radiance in Old Zhou’s eyes.

“Contact the experts from the ancestral sect. Today, we’ll hold everyone from Dragon Sect over here. This is also a good sign for the battle of the Sect Leader tomorrow.”

Old Zhou revealed a faint smile as he instructed the disciple beside him.

“Yes!”

A disciple nodded his head immediately as he delivered the message instantaneously to Donghua Sacred Sect.

A large number of experts of Donghua Sacred Sect would arrive ten minutes later.

“They are here to receive us?”

Seeing a dozen people standing in front in the air, coldness swept across Wang Xian’s eyes.

“Just with ten-odd Inborn Experts? How would they dare to receive us here? It looks like they have some hidden cards!”

Wang Xian squinted his eyes a little as he scanned around him with red-blue radiance in his eyes.

“Hur?”

A special layer of energy appeared within his vision. He had seen this when he was at Huashan.

Obviously, this bout of energy was weaker by a hundred times as compared to Huashan.

The hidden energy encompassed an area of five kilometers.

“Donghua Sacred Sect is just fifty kilometers away from here. Their reinforcements will be able to reach here in ten minutes. We must kill them all by then!” Wang Xian commanded the surrounding Dragonians in a dull voice.

“Yes, Dragon King!”

Wang Xian jerked his Devil Wings behind him, and so did the 49 Dragonians behind him, emanating bouts of formidable aura.

The intense killing aura surged from their bodies while devil clouds were coalescing in the sky, as if devils were emerging from the abyss.

It was petrifying and domineering!
