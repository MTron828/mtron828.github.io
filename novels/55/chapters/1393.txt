Chapter 1394: How could 1394 compete with them

“This... The Liu family is obviously going to fight over it!”

“The Liu family is bullying us. Other people come over respectfully to propose marriage, but they are putting on airs. But who asked the Liu family to be so powerful!”

Mrs. Liu and Liu Shaohua did not hide their words at all, causing an uproar in the surroundings.

They looked at Duan Jinming and the Fire Hammer clan sympathetically.

Although the current fire hammer clan was quite strong, they were still far from the Liu clan. They didn’t dare to reject the Liu clan’s proposal.

“Who are you calling a lowly demonic beast clan? !”

Duan Jinming heard them calling him a lowly demonic beast clan, and his expression turned angry. He growled in a low voice.

“Jinming, don’t be angry!”

The Fire Hammer tribe leader waved his hand at Duan Jinming, telling him not to speak recklessly.

He straightened his clothes and cupped his hands towards the center.

“Gilded Gold tribe leader, our fire hammer tribe is sincerely here today to propose a marriage. The Gilded Gold tribe leader also knows that the two children have long been in love!”

“Our Fire Hammer tribe was indeed a lowly demonic beast tribe in the past. Perhaps we are still a lowly tribe in the eyes of some people now!”

“Hehe, bring out the marriage proposal gift prepared by our lowly clan. I believe that the Gilded Gold clan leader will be able to see our sincerity!”

After the fire hammer clan leader cupped his hands, he slightly raised his head and straightened his back as he stood up.

“It’s the clan leader!”

At the rear, a few members of the fire hammer clan carried the items from the carriage down.

“Peng Peng Peng!”

There were a total of ten boxes. The members of the Fire Hammer clan directly placed the boxes on the ground in the middle.

“Chief gilded gold, our fire hammer clan comes from an ordinary background. In the past, many thanks to chief gilded gold for giving us a meal!”

“Our gilded gold bloodline is extraordinary. Now that we have become insightful emptiness realm experts, these are the betrothal gifts we prepared to show our sincerity!”

The chief of the Fire Hammer clan walked over and waved at the clansmen behind him.

“Ka Ka Ka!”

The chest opened, revealing some of the items inside!

“Hua!”

“Holy shit, so many weapons and equipment!”

“Hiss, so many weapons! The fire hammer clan actually brought out so many exquisite weapons!”

“Look at that chest, there’s a forging table inside. It should be a profound void tier forging table. This forging table is worth at least ten billion middle-grade spirit stones!”

“My goodness, what a huge sum! Look at those brats! Five void interpretation weapons! How... how did the fire hammer clan become so rich? !”

“All these items added together should be worth at least a hundred billion middle-grade spirit stones, right?”

When the items were opened one by one, the surrounding people revealed shocked expressions.

A Weapon, a weapon worth a hundred billion middle-grade spirit stones.

This wasn’t something that could be easily taken out by a random force.

Even the gilded gold clan’s items that were worth such a high price were equivalent to one-seventh to one-eighth of their clan’s wealth!

Everyone in the Gilded Gold clan was slightly stunned. Their gazes looked at the items one by one, and a trace of shock flashed through their eyes.

This was F * cking generous!

“Third miss, this is my gift to you!”

At this moment, Duan Jinming walked over, took out the water orb from his interspatial ring, and handed it to gilded speech.

“Water Orb, the water orb that was auctioned at the king’s auction yesterday!”

“Oh my God, a water orb worth more than 10 billion mid-grade spirit stones. I heard that the young city Lord wanted to buy it, but the people of the dragon-phoenix Empire didn’t give the young city lord any face and directly bid for it!”

“This fire hammer clan is simply too generous. More than 100 billion items to propose marriage, TSK TSK!”

“It seems that the fire hammer clan has a powerful background. The Liu clan came to propose marriage, but they didn’t even prepare the items. There’s no sincerity at all!”

Around them, everyone looked at the gifts with some shock and swallowed a mouthful of saliva.

“This is an item that our lowly race took out. I hope that the gilded gold tribe leader will agree to the marriage between Jin Ming and third Miss!”

The fire hammer tribe leader cupped his hands once again and looked at everyone from the Liu tribe as he spoke indifferently.

At this moment, everyone from the Liu tribe looked at the items in the arena with an embarrassed expression.

Hearing the words ‘items prepared by the lowly race’, their expressions changed slightly.

A lowly race had already taken out so many items. As the Liu family, shouldn’t you take out something even more precious?

“It’s just some external items. Our Foundation and strength aren’t something they can compare to!”

Liu Shaohua’s gloomy face swept across Duan Jinming as he stared at the gilded gold family with an embarrassed expression. “Uncle and aunt, I’m more than enough for your three daughters. Please consider it carefully!”

“Mrs. Gilded Gold, for your daughters’sake and for the gilded gold family’s sake, you’d better betroth your third daughter to my son!”

Mrs. Liu said with an embarrassed expression.

There was a hint of threat in her voice.

The Liu family’s words caused the gilded gold family’s expressions to change slightly.

It was very obvious that if their daughter didn’t marry the Liu family, then the gilded gold family would be in trouble in the future!

The meaning was obvious!

“Haha, if you want to propose a marriage, then propose a marriage. Why did you bring along a competition of influence?”

Wang Xian, who had been watching from the back, smirked when he saw the people from the Liu family.

Using influence to suppress others. The Gilded Gold family wouldn’t be able to withstand the pressure of the Liu family.

He walked out with a smile on his face. His gaze swept across everyone from the Liu family. His eyes were filled with disdain. “Do you really think that only your Liu family has influence?”

“HMM? Who is that young man?”

“He has been with the fire hammer family all this while. He should be from the dragon and Phoenix Empire!”

“The influence of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire is much stronger than the Liu Family!”

When the people around saw Wang Xian walking out, they were all surprised and discussed in a low voice.

“Dragon and Phoenix Empire? This has nothing to do with you guys. You are meddling too much. Do you really think that this is your dragon and Phoenix Empire?”

Everyone from the Liu clan was focused on Wang Xian.

Liu Shaohua stared at him with a cold face.

“If someone bullies my subordinates, I will naturally take action. If you are not satisfied, we can have a fight. With Your Liu clan, do you believe that I can destroy all of you easily?”

Wang Xian glanced at everyone from the Liu clan with a smile and said forcefully.

“He’s really domineering!”

“This is interesting. Now that the Fire Hammer clan has the dragon and Phoenix Empire behind them, it’s really easy for them to destroy the Liu clan with the power of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire!”

When the people around saw Wang Xian’s domineering manner, their eyes lit up.

This time, the Liu clan had encountered a tough nut to crack!

“You...”

When everyone in the Liu clan heard Wang Xian’s words, their faces changed slightly. They looked extremely embarrassed.

“Hehe, a gentleman would like to have a beautiful lady. As a young man, what’s the difference between a good-for-nothing and a good-for-nothing by relying on the forces behind him? Let’s compete on our own!”

Wang Xian said with a smile on his face, “If your Liu clan dares to suppress us in this matter, I will take action as well. If you don’t, let’s see how strong you are from the Gilded Gold clan!”

As he spoke, he gestured at Duan Jinming!

“With your individual strength, how can a noble trash like you compete with me? HMPH!” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Duan Jinming stared at Liu Shaohua and roared loudly.

His aura shook and a second-level profound void martial stage aura was emitted.

A terrifying aura charged forward!
