The entire hotel lobby quietened down.

This included Uncle Zhang’s relatives and friends and also the relatives and friends of the bride and groom.

The businessmen and influential figures on Pengzhou that they had invited over were looking at the development in disbelief.

They knew clearly of the background of the bride and groom. The groom’s grandfather is the President of a mining organization. He could be considered as one of the earliest batches of people in Pengzhou who got rich.

Although the family business had been on a decline, the groom’s grandfather had great connections throughout Pengzhou.

As long as his grandfather was still around, the majority of the people in Rivertown would be respectful to him.

Many rich men in Pengzhou were invited to the wedding. In fact, the old master had even invited members of the Song Family.

The Song Family was the strongest family in Pengzhou at this moment. Their background was mysterious but strong.

In Pengzhou, whenever the Song Family stomped its feet, the entire Pengzhou would feel the tremors.

Yet, the three members of the Song Family were bowing down respectfully to a juvenile sibling and even ordered the groom and bride to apologize.

“This... Why would the Wang siblings be so influential? Even... The guests that were invited by the other party had to be respectful to them and even slapped the arrogant young man for the Wang sibling!”

“That’s incredible! How did the Wang siblings get to know those influential figures? Even these people had to be respectful to the Wang siblings!”

“Look, look! Du Qingshan is walking over.”

“All the influential figures had gathered there. Oh my gosh! All of them are going over to greet those siblings!”

“This... How can this be possible?”

Behind them, Uncle Zhang and his relatives and friends were dumbfounded.

Those were people that they couldn’t offend. Yet, when the Wang siblings went over, even those influential figures had to bow to the Wang siblings and even ordered the bride and groom to apologize.

In fact, even Du Qingshan, who had been overbearing in the entire Feng Lake county, just stood there like a small underling.

He wasn’t at the level of those influential figures yet.

At this very moment, Uncle Zhang was completely shocked and stood there in a daze.

He saw that arrogant young man fall to the floor from the slap.

And he saw the arrogant bride and groom bowing down and apologizing in fear.

This was completely beyond his imagination. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Xiao Yu, Xiao Xian.”

Uncle Zhang opened his mouth and looked at his nephew and niece.

Wang Xian smiled at Uncle Zhang before looking coldly at that couple. “Seeing that it’s your wedding today I won’t be calculative with you guys.”

“Thank you, thank you!”

The bride and groom had already been scared out of their wits. When they realized Director Song didn’t add a word, they finally heaved a huge sigh of relief.

If he was someone that the Song Family was so fearful of, what would the groom and bride even be in front of him?

“However, I wouldn’t just let that young man off so easily.” Wang Xian glanced at Fenghai who was just getting up.

Fenghai’s mouth was filled with blood and his entire face had been deformed.

“I’ll leave this to you guys!” Xiao Yu frowned upon seeing Fenghai, speaking to the three members of the Song Family.

“Yes, yes. We will definitely give the Saintess and Mr. Wang a satisfactory explanation!”

Three members of the Song Family replied immediately. This was the order of the Saintess!

Even if the Saintess wanted to crush the Li Family, the Song Family would not hesitate a moment.

When Fenghai heard what the Song Family members said, his eyes were filled with despair. Following which, he blacked out and fell to the ground.

Since the Song Family had spoken, he was finished. Even if he was not dead, he would be severely punished.

The faces of the bride and groom, together with the surrounding crowd, had turned as white as sheets.

“Mr. Wang, Saintess. I had not expected to bump into you guys in Pengzhou. Are you all here to attend a wedding too?”

The old man from the Song Family looked around before asking this with a smile.

“Yeah. We are from Pengzhou too. My sister is getting married today!”

Seeing how careful the Song Family was acting, Xiao Yu smiled and nodded her head.

“Oh? Is that so? What a coincidence. Since she’s a relative of the Saintess, she’s also a relative of the Song Family. Hehe.”

The old man from the Song Family smiled.

“She’s the only relative we have in Pengzhou. Please help them along in the future.”

Wang Xian placed his hands over the shoulders of Uncle Zhang as he spoke to the old man from the Song Family.

“Not a problem at all. This is just a small matter. Rest assured, Mr Wang. Just leave this to the Song Family.”

The old man from the Song Family immediately gave his guarantee. After this, he smiled. “Since they are the relatives of the Saintess and Mr. Wang, they are one of us. Let’s go over a while.”

“Xiao Kun, prepare some gifts for them.”

“Yes, father.”

The middle-aged man beside the old man nodded his head. Following which, he headed towards the table that was collecting the monetary gifts.

Du Qingshan, who was standing at one corner, looked at the development in disbelief. Suddenly, he spotted a familiar figure among the crowd.

His expression changed, and he walked to Uncle Zhang and asked, “Big Brother, are you from Feng Lake County?”

“Yes, Director Du. How are you?”

Uncle Zhang heard someone speaking to him. When he saw it was Du Qingshan, he was slightly shocked and immediately replied.

“I am not Director Du. Big Brother, you can just address me as Xiao Du. Xiao Du would do. You should be a few years older than me.”

Du Qingshan put on a big smile and quickly added, “I had not expected us to be from the same area.”

As he spoke, he smiled radiantly and said to the old man of the Song Family, “Director Song, we are from the same hometown. I’ll look out for Big Brother in the future. No one would dare to offend him.”

Hmm. When the old man from the Song Family saw Du Qingshan walking over trying to curry favor, he nodded his head in satisfaction. “Come with me in a while!”

“Yes, yes!”

Du Qingshan was thrilled upon hearing the old man from the Song Family. His face turned red in agitation as he looked to Uncle Zhang. “Big Brother, we should be friends since we are from the same place. Let me just go give my monetary gift!” Du Qingshan said as he walked towards the place to give the monetary gifts.

At this moment, the middle-aged man was standing in front of the table collecting monetary gifts.

The middle-aged man who was in charge of collecting immediately stood up, smiled and asked, “Sir, how much would you like to give?”

“$500,000!”

The middle-aged man from the Song Family smiled before taking out stacks of cash from a briefcase.

“Whose name should I record for these?” The middle-aged man’s pupils shrank as he spoke.

“Just record it as the Song Family,” the middle-aged man from the Song Family replied after pondering for a moment.

“Alright!” The middle-aged man nodded his head in a hurry.

At this moment, Du Qingshan also walked over with a smile and said to the middle-aged man, “Hey brother, please help to record mine too!”

“Du... Director Du... You...”

“$300,000!” Du Qingshan smiled. “My big brother’s daughter is getting married. It’s only natural that I give a little more.”

“Big Brother...”

When the middle-aged man heard Du Qingshan, he swallowed his saliva before replying, “Alright, alright.”

One gave $500,000 and the other gave $300,000. Stacks of cash now filled the table.
