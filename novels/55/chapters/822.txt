Chapter 823: 0824 tamed Ba Qi

Translator: 549690339

Wang Xian chuckled and stared at Ba Qi coldly. He didn’t say anything and followed closely behind.

Ba Qi gritted his teeth and moved for a while. The Beast Bone staff in his hand emitted a black demonic shadow. In an instant, thousands of identical figures appeared.

The demonic shadow avatars flew in all directions.

Wang Xian swept his gaze across them. His gaze was still fixated on the real body.

Now, Wang Xian realized that it was a wise choice to modify the penetrating eye back then.

Seeing that Wang Xian was still following closely behind, the eight-headed snake continued to flee with a dark expression.

Time passed slowly. Soon, five to six hours had passed. The nine foreheads of the eight-headed snake were covered in cold sweat. Looking at Wang Xian and the members of the Dragon Palace who were chasing closely behind, they gritted their teeth and continued to flee forward.

His eyes flickered as he looked around, looking for the best escape location.

Fortunately, they were in the sea. The area was larger than the land and the terrain was complicated. It was suitable for escaping.

If they were on land, he would have been caught up.

Wang Xian followed behind without changing his expression. The eight-limbed giant snake had nine heads and could find the most suitable direction in the fastest time possible.

On this point, one had to admit that the eight-headed beast was a demonic beast with extraordinary talent.

It had powerful intelligence, turned into a human, and had terrifying strength and means. It was indeed worthy of being called a god and had believers.

“Eh, is that the direction of the Dragon Palace?”

When Wang Xian saw that the direction of his escape had actually changed to the direction of the Dragon Palace, a thick smile appeared on his face.

“Dragon King, you will never be able to catch up to me. Let’s just forget about it. We will not interfere in each other’s business in the future!”

“Dragon King, I am willing to give you a portion of my collection. Our feud will end here!”

“Dragon King, can’t we discuss this?”

More than ten minutes later, the eight-limbed snake was getting anxious and kept shouting at Wang Xian.

Wang Xian ignored him and followed closely behind him. He looked ahead and revealed a smile.

“Dragon King, if you push me too far, I will perish together with you!”

After running for a few more minutes, the eight-limbed snake roared furiously.

His nine heads were filled with anxiety. He had been running for four to five hours but still could not shake it off. If he continued to run, his speed would decrease!

This made him anxious. His nine pairs of eyes were spinning non-stop.

“Xiao Lan, come and stop it!”

When he was within ten kilometers of the Dragon Palace, Wang Xian shouted softly.

Kun, who had been staying around the Dragon Palace, swayed slightly when he heard Wang Xian’s voice.

His speed was extremely fast and his body size was terrifying.

A hundred and fifty meters was definitely the largest existence on earth.

Its skin was dozens of meters thick. If it wanted to kill this kun, even if seven or eight nuclear bombs landed on its body, they might not be able to kill it.

Its body moved, and its eyes, which were the size of a house, reflected everything ten kilometers in front of it.

The Kun’s body moved, and it swam directly toward the eight points.

The Kun’s body was incomparably huge, and its speed was not slower than the nine flood dragons. In an instant, it appeared in front of the eight points.

Ba Qi, who was desperately running for his life, almost wet his pants when he saw Kun suddenly appear in front of him.

It had a terrifying 150-meter-tall body, a gigantic mouth, and terrifying eyes.

“Buzz!”

A gray area appeared on Kun’s head, and its body directly charged toward Ba Qi.

Ba Qi’s expression changed slightly. Looking at the gray area, he had a bad premonition.

He raised the beast bone staff in his hand and pointed forward.

The three-meter thick corrosive poison instantly formed a thousand-meter long poison pillar and attacked the Kun.

The terrifying poison sizzled as it landed on the Kun’s body. Its skin was instantly corroded five meters deep and ten meters wide.

“What?”

However, Ba Qi suddenly let out a scream. There wasn’t a single drop of blood on this terrifying wound. The Kun didn’t even feel the slightest pain.

A terrifying force instantly struck over.

“Boom!”

It was as if the entire Kun’s strength was concentrated at the point of impact. This force was comparable to a full-strength strike from a middle-level immortal.

And this full-strength strike was also a physical attack.

In an instant, Ba Qi’s body instantly collapsed. His eyes almost popped out.

If it was not for his terrifying physical body and the strength of a high-level immortal, even if he was a middle-level immortal, he would have been reduced to meat paste under this impact.

This terrifying creature could concentrate all the strength in its body into one point and release it.

If this Kun reached 10,000 meters, it could even hit the earth. This was also the terror of the Kun.

“You can die now!”

Wang Xian saw the octahedron flying towards him. His sharp dragon claws clawed at its head.

One of the octahedron’s heads turned around. Feeling the threat of death, his expression changed drastically.

How could the Dragon Palace be so terrifying.

Plop

His expression changed drastically. Following that, he made a move that stunned Wang Xian.

In the air, he resisted the urge to spit out a mouthful of blood. He landed on the bottom of the sea and knelt down.

“I surrender, I surrender!”

Wang Xian was slightly stunned. He extended his hand and the members of the Dragon Palace surrounded him. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

A look of fear flashed across Ba Qi’s eyes. He squeezed out a smile and said, “I surrender, Dragon King. I surrender. I will do whatever you want me to do in the future!”

“HMM? Didn’t you say that you would rather die than surrender? Are You a god who is high and mighty?”

A teasing look flashed across Wang Xian’s eyes. “Now, you can commit suicide by digging your own stomach!”

“Dragon King, I surrender sincerely. I have already enjoyed all the things that I should enjoy. In the future, I will serve the Dragon Palace and fight for the Dragon King. We will destroy the Western Sea God Sea region and unify the sea. Dragon King, you are mighty!”

Ba Qi said to Wang Xian with a mischievous look.

Wang Xian stared at Ba Qi with a twinkle in his eyes. There was a hesitant look on his face.

Ba Qi looked at Wang Xian with a feeling as if he wanted to devour him. His expression changed.

“Dragon King, I have many underlings who can join the Dragon Palace. In the future, I will fight for you. Please give me a chance, Dragon King!”

The eight-limbed snake said hurriedly, “Furthermore, I have collected many treasures over the past two thousand years. If you kill me, these treasures will be gone. Give me a chance to serve you!”

He shouted loudly. The longer he lived, the more afraid he would be of death.

The eight-limbed snake was the same. He was afraid that he would be swallowed by Wang Xian, so he shouted loudly.

“Alright!”

In the end, Wang Xian decided not to swallow the eight-limbed snake. He was still lacking more than ten million dragon qi. As long as he had some treasures, he would be able to achieve a breakthrough.

The eight-limbed snake was still useful. Besides him and Shu Qing, there were no other upper-level immortal-level members in the Dragon Palace.

Most importantly, the eight-limbed snake had lived for a long time and understood a lot of things. His intelligence and knowledge were even higher than Prime Minister Gui!

If he had not met him, he would have been an invincible existence in his territory.
