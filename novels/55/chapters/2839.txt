“Bang, Bang, Bang!”

Wang Xian’s body cracked open. His body flew backward like a fly that was hit by a slap.

A large amount of blood gushed out from his body. His face turned extremely pale instantly.

“This… what a terrifying attack!”

His pupils contracted slightly and a look of astonishment appeared on his face.

!!

This was beyond his expectations. It was completely beyond his expectations.

“Bang Bang Bang!”

“Oh no!”

At this moment, Wang Xian’s expression changed drastically again. His body that was flying backward touched some of the surrounding trees.

“WHOOSH WHOOSH WHOOSH!”

In the next moment, the leaves that filled the sky attacked him again.

“Ah!”

Countless leaves landed on his body like sharp blades and swords. He couldn’t help but let out a scream. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

However, the fan-like attack of the leaves and branches made him unable to stop or control his body.

At this moment, he felt as though he was Sun Wukong who was caught in the banana fan.

Unlike Sun Wukong’s unrestrained manner, his body was almost split open and he spat out fresh blood.

“Bang, Bang, Bang!”

The extremely powerful impact force caused him to be placed on the mountain peak. A huge hole was created on the mountain peak and his body was still sent flying out.

He had already flown out of the windless forest valley.

If it wasn’t for the fact that his divine dragon body was stronger, Wang Xian would probably have died.

When his body flew out of the windless forest valley, he heaved a sigh of relief. His body was extremely weak.

Fortunately, he didn’t die!

Boom

This attack sent him flying for billions of miles before he landed heavily on the ground.

At this moment, a voice suddenly came from the side.

Not far away from him, a graceful and elegant lady was sitting cross-legged.

There were traces of blood on her body. She was recuperating when she saw a person suddenly flying towards her. Her expression changed drastically.

Wang Xian’s figure touched the branches of the tree. Countless branches and leaves instantly covered this area.

The graceful and elegant lady was also covered by the branches.

Her expression changed drastically. She gritted her teeth and waved her arm.

Buzz

A green wind shield of laws enveloped the surroundings, and Wang Xian was also covered by the wind shield.

Bang! Bang! Bang

Countless leaves fell on the branches, causing him to look extremely embarrassed.

The graceful and elegant lady looked at where Wang Xian was and revealed an angry expression.

“Cough, cough!”

Wang Xian landed on the ground and felt extremely painful. He sat up with great difficulty and coughed out a large amount of blood.

He smiled awkwardly when he saw the sullen gaze.

“I’m sorry. I’ve implicated you.”

Wang Xian wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and said apologetically.

Buzz

The elegant lady stared at him coldly. A majestic aura was emitted from within.

He was holding something that looked like a compass in his hand. The compass was emitting light and a wave of energy swept past Wang Xian.

She looked at the information on the compass and her eyes flickered slightly.

“You are only at level five immortal King and you dare to barge in here? Are you courting death?”

The lady stared at Wang Xian coldly and said with a hint of anger.

“Cough, cough. I was attacked here. I’m very sorry.”

Wang Xian regained some of his breath and smiled. His gaze swept across the lady and a hollow defense around her.

He waved his arm and a wind jade flew towards the lady.

“Take this as compensation. It wasn’t easy to get it.”

Wang Xian sat cross-legged on the ground and said apologetically.

“A wind jade of level nine immortal king. With your level five immortal king strength, you actually dared to touch something of this level. You’re really lucky that you didn’t die!”

The elegant lady raised her eyebrows when she saw the wind jade that Wang Xian threw over. She was full of surprise.

“I’m just lucky!”

Wang Xian casually replied.

The lady stared at the Wind Jade in front of her. Her expression changed. She struggled for a while and kept it in her hand.

“From now on, I will protect you and leave this place until your injuries recover. This wind jade will be your reward!”

As the woman spoke, she stood up slowly and looked around.

“The wind shield won’t be able to hold on for long. I will bring you away immediately.”

She waved her arm and a gust of wind elemental energy wrapped around Wang Xian.

“Huh?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and looked at the woman who was making good decisions.

Buzz

The next moment, the woman led Wang Xian and flew towards the outside.

The wind shield around them followed them.

“This wind shield is really powerful. It can actually dodge the attacks of the Trees!”

Wang Xian looked at the wind shield and asked.

“This is the most important life-saving treasure I have when I enter the windless forest.”

The woman said and led Wang Xian to fly quickly.

Her speed was very fast. Wang Xian could sense her cultivation base at a glance. She was at the peak of the Immortal King Realm.

However, her appearance was about the same as a woman in her thirties. Her facial features and temperament were more outstanding. As for her specific age…

Wang Xian estimated that she was already eight to nine million years old.

She could be considered as an old monster.

However, for a woman at this level, unless she was about to die, her vitality and appearance could be maintained perfectly.

The woman brought Wang Xian and flew out. Wang Xian didn’t say anything, and neither did the woman.

The wind shield dissipated after an hour. Following that, the woman used her powerful wind attribute control ability to dance under the attacks of the leaves. She managed to completely snatch away the countless leaves.

Upon seeing this, she was able to recover from the injuries in her body in peace.

Her injuries were very serious. If she consumed some elixirs, she would be able to fully recover in no time.

“He’s Out!”

Seven to eight hours later, the lady flew out of the windless forest with Wang Xian. She took a glance at Wang Xian who was recovering and waved her arm after saying something.

A banana fan appeared in front of him. The size of the fan was large enough to accommodate hundreds of people.

Looking at the godly weapon of the banana fan, Wang Xian couldn’t help but take a few more glances at it.

After all, he was attacked by a tree branch in this shape just now.

Wang Xian sat on the plantain fan to recover from his injuries while the lady stood on it without saying a word.

The two of them flew in the desolate land.

A day later, Wang Xian sensed that there were more people around him.

He opened his eyes and scanned his surroundings. He noticed that there were many people flying in the void around him. There were also many flying machines.

With a glance, most of them were experts at the level of a god King. There were very few people at the level of a god Lord.

Very soon, they arrived at a planet. Most of the people on the planet were below the level of a godly king. It was obvious that this was a planet of life and power.

The woman led Wang Xian to a manor in front of a lake on the planet.

There was a busy market in front of the manor. It felt like it was hidden from the world.

“You can recuperate here. You can leave anytime after you recover.”

There were many houses in the manor. The woman brought Wang Xian to the front of a room and said expressionlessly.
