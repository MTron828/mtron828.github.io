DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“The young insightful emptiness realm expert of the fire hammer clan is going to propose marriage to the Gilded Gold clan!”

“It is said that when the fire hammer clan was in the gilded gold clan, the mutated Duan Jinming and the third young miss of the Gilded Gold clan had a crush on each other. I didn’t expect that they would propose marriage today!”

“Could this be considered as a successful counterattack? Who would have thought that Duan Jinming’s bloodline would actually return to its ancestor? Now that he has directly advanced to the first level of the insightful emptiness realm, it is more than enough for him to propose marriage to the Gilded Gold clan!”

“The current fire hammer clan can be considered to have made a comeback. With the protection of a profound void tier expert, they are no longer something that ordinary factions can bully!”

At the entrance of the fire hammer shop, when the shop’s door closed and two horse carriages stopped at the entrance, dozens of members of the fire hammer clan stood around the horse carriages. The surrounding customers and passers-by looked on with bewildered expressions.

Who would have thought that not long ago, an extremely poor and lowly clan would actually have a profound void martial expert.

And this young profound void martial expert had completed his counterattack and went to the gilded gold clan to propose marriage.

The Gilded Gold clan was a well-known large clan in the entire weapon district. Other than the Liu clan, the gilded gold clan’s influence was the strongest.

The strongest expert in the clan was at the third level of the profound void martial stage, and there were five or six experts at the profound void martial stage.

However, it was more than enough for a level one of the void interpretation stage to propose marriage to the third young miss of the gilded gold tribe.

“Let’s go and take a look!”

“Let’s Go!”

Some people who had nothing to do followed behind and walked in the direction of the gilded gold tribe.

Duan Jinming and the leader of the fire tribe stood at the front while Wang Xian and Ao Jian followed in the middle.

Along the way, some passers-by saw the fire hammer tribe going over to propose marriage in such a grand manner. They looked at them curiously.

“Father, mother, Jin Ming will come over to our house to propose the marriage later. Can you... can you not make things difficult for him?”

At this moment, in the study room of the Gilded Gold clan, Gilded Gold Yan ran over with a face full of joy and told them about the time when Duan Jin Ming was going to propose the marriage.

She looked at her parents with some anticipation, her eyes full of desire.

“Good, good, good. Now that that Kid has become a profound void stage powerhouse, he is worthy of our Yanyan. When that kid comes over later, we will definitely not make things difficult for him!”

The leader of the gilded gold tribe looked at his daughter and laughed loudly. He also said happily.

“Thank you, father. I will go and make some preparations now!”

Gilded Gold tribe leader’s face turned red. His eyes were as happy as crescent moons. He jumped out excitedly.

“Good, good. Although the Liu family did not agree, that kid actually obtained an opportunity and directly became an insightful emptiness realm expert. He is worthy of our Yanyan!”

A woman in the study said with a smile.

“The current fire hammer clan is no longer the fire hammer clan of the past. They have a powerful backer!”

The Gilded Gold clan leader said slowly.

“I heard that the young man from the dragon-phoenix dynasty offended the young city lord. Will the fire hammer clan be fine in the future if they join them? Will our words be married to them?”

The woman suddenly said with some worry.

“Hehe, it’s not a big deal. Although the dragon-phoenix dynasty offended the young city lord of Xiaoyao City, they didn’t offend the city lord of Xiaoyao City. It’s said that the dragon-phoenix dynasty has four or five fourth level profound void martial experts. The young city Lord can’t do anything to them!”

The Gilded Gold tribe leader shook his head with a smile on his face.

“Let our clansmen prepare. Since the fire hammer tribe is here to propose marriage, our gilded gold tribe can’t be stingy. Besides, the dragon-phoenix Empire might follow us. Let’s put on a show and go out to welcome them later!”

The Gilded Gold tribe leader continued to say with a smile.

“It’s husband!”

The woman nodded and passed the news to the gilded gold tribe clansmen.

“Eh? Duan Jinming is coming to our house to propose marriage later?”

When the brothers and Sisters of the Gilded Gold tribe received this message, they were slightly stunned.

“Young master Liu said that if our sister has any news, tell him. Should we tell him?”

“Of course, Tell Young Master Liu. Third Sister May marry out of Xiaoyao city in the future, but we still have to stay in Xiaoyao City!”

As the two of them spoke, they immediately relayed this matter to young master Liu.

...

At the peak ten thousand meters behind the weapons district, in front of the waterfall, twenty to thirty young noble men and women were playing.

Liu Shaohua, who was sitting next to Yao Dingfeng, was slightly stunned when he saw the message on the communication stone plate. Immediately after, his eyes flashed with an inexplicable luster.

“What’s wrong, Shaohua? What’s the matter?”

Yao Dingfeng asked curiously when he saw the corner of his good brother’s mouth curling up slightly.

“I have something to do. I’m leaving First!”

Liu Shaohua stood up and said with a smile on his face.

“Huh? What’s the matter? The young master of the city is coming soon. Are you leaving now?”

Yao Dingfeng asked in astonishment.

“I’m going to propose a marriage!”

Liu Shaohua said with a smile on his face.

“Propose a marriage? Didn’t you say a few days ago that you were going to be free and easy for a few years? Why?”

As Yao Dingfeng said this, he thought of something and stopped. He asked, “Gilded Gold Family?”

“Gilded Gold Family!”

Liu Shaohua nodded with a smile.

“Haha, the third miss of Gilded Gold family is pretty good. Let’s go, I’ll go with you!”

Yao Dingfeng laughed and stood up with a smile.

“Eh? Young Master Liu, young master Yao, what are you going to do?”

At this moment, some young men and women asked curiously.

“Young Master Yao is going to the gilded gold family to propose marriage. I’ll go with him!”

He laughed and the two flew down.

The Liu family was under the waterfall!

“Eh? Propose Marriage?”

Some young men and women were slightly stunned and showed a stunned look.

...

“Duan Jinming of the fire hammer clan has proposed marriage to the third young miss of the Gilded Gold clan!”

“The members of the Gilded Gold clan are waiting at the entrance. It can be said that they have obviously agreed to this marriage!”

“I heard that the fire hammer clan has found a powerful backer, the dragon-phoenix Dynasty!”

When the marriage proposal team was about to arrive at the Gilded Gold clan’s mansion, the nearby residents saw the fire hammer clan walking over and whispered among themselves.

At the entrance of the Gilded Gold clan’s residence, a group of Gilded Gold clan’s people were welcoming them.

After meticulously dressing up, Gilded Gold Yan stood at the center of the group, looking at the marriage proposal team with a face full of joy!

Duan Jin Ming saw the Gilded Gold clan’s people waiting at the entrance of the residence from afar. His beloved woman was waiting for him. His face was full of excitement.

Behind him, the members of the Fire Hammer clan were also full of pride.

Today, a member of their clan came to propose marriage to the Gilded Gold clan!

All the honor and confidence were given to them by the king beside them.

“Lord of the Gilded Gold clan, this kid, Duan Jinming of the Fire Hammer clan, has a long-standing relationship with the third young miss. Today, he is here to propose marriage to the Gilded Gold clan!”

“I hope Lord of the clan and the third young miss can agree to this kid’s proposal!”

The team approached. Under the guidance of the fire hammer patriarch, Duan Jinming walked over with some restraint. He cupped his hands and said sincerely.
