Chapter 6: Redcap Brown Oranda

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

“You are also from Class of 2020? Which department are you from?”

On the small path in the school, Guan Shuqing looked at the boy with shimmering eyes.

A height of 1.7 meters wasn’t very tall. However, he had a unique aura around him. His determined face carried with it a tinge of stability that students didn’t possess.

She was full of gratitude towards the man who had helped her in the afternoon. If it wasn’t for this man, she really couldn’t imagine the consequences.

“I study Business Administration. You can call me Wang Xian,” Wang Xian replied with a smile.

“Business Administration? Our classrooms are close to each other. You’re not going home for the summer break either?” Guan Shuqing continued, “I’m really thankful for your help with the incident today. If it wasn’t for you, I really don’t know what would have happened to me.”

“You don’t have to thank me for it. It was just a simple act.” Wang Xian smiled before continuing, “No, I’m not going home this summer – found a summer job outside the school.”

“Oh really? What a coincidence! Sadly, I got fired by my boss.” Guan Shuqing pouted slightly.

“Hehe,” Wang Xian looked at her and smiled, “My dormitory is right over there. Talk to you next time.”

Wang Xian waved his hand as he spoke. All he was thinking about was the ornamental fish and making money. He didn’t have the additional energy to think about chatting with a beautiful girl.

Wang Xian walked away directly. This made Guan Shuqing a little shocked as she looked at his back. “Then... Bye bye... You...”

“What?” asked Wang Xian as he saw her stop suddenly despite having things to say.

“Can I add you on WeChat? It’s all thanks to you that the incident in the day was settled. Let me buy you a meal some time,” said Guan Shuqing.

“Hmm. Alright.” Wang Xian nodded his head. However, he smiled bitterly after looking at the fishbowl and umbrella in his hand. “My phone is in my pocket. I’ll give you my number and you can add me with that.”

“Alright.” Guan Shuqing nodded her head. She took out her phone and added Wang Xian on WeChat.

“Alright, I shall not take up more time of yours. Goodbye.” Guan Shuqing waved her hands at him after sending the friend request.

“Goodbye.”

Wang Xian nodded his head before walking quickly in the direction of the dormitory.

“Did I lose my charm?” Guan Shuqing touched her face as she looked at the back view of Wang Xian at a loss. “If it were any other man that had helped me, perhaps... What a unique man. Could it be that he already has a girlfriend?”

Guan Shuqing mumbled to herself. She hesitated for a moment before taking out her phone and sending a message to a classmate of hers that was also in Business Administration.

“Xiao Ya, is there a guy called Wang Xian in your class?”

“Wang Xian? Yes. What’s the matter? Don’t tell me he’s wooing you. That can’t be. He’s a pretty introverted man.” After several tens of seconds, she received a reply from her classmate.

“Introverted?” Guan Shuqing looked at the reply messages from Xiao Ya and sank into deep thought. She replied, “No. It’s just that this man really helped me out today and I would like to find out more about him. He is a little different from others.”

“Huh? Really helped you out? Oh Goddess Shuqing, are you thinking of marrying him to show your gratitude? I know a little about Wang Xian as he is in the same dormitory as my boyfriend. From what my boyfriend told me, his family background’s conditions are really bad and his sister is all he has as family. Not only has he got to work for his living expenses, he still has to raise his sister. He didn’t join any group outing in his first year in school. In fact, he rarely joined his roommates in any gatherings. He’s really poor.”

“Poor?” Guan Shuqing felt a little confused when she saw Xiao Ya’s reply. But he went to First-grade Restaurant for lunch today!

“Did he have something to do at First-grade Restaurant?”

Guan Shuqing was confused but subsequently replied, “Alright, I got it. From what you said, this man is pretty good.”

“Oh, my Goddess Shuqing, you can’t be serious. You have to think thrice about it!”

“Don’t read too much into it. I’m focusing on my studies right now...”

Wang Xian had no clue that the it girl of the school was scooping around about him.

At this moment, he was back in his dormitory. He locked the door of the room and stared excitedly at the eight goldfish in the fish tank.

“I wonder if the exhaustion would be huge.”

Wang Xian scooped up one of the goldfish and thought to himself.

With just a thought, he injected Dragon Energy into the body of the black and white goldfish. The breed of this goldfish was Ranchu and it had cost $120 for one. It could be considered rather expensive.

He was preparing to upgrade the goldfish to the most valuable Redcap Brown Oranda. Therefore, all the goldfish that he had chosen were of similar colors to the Redcap Brown Oranda.

As the Dragon Energy entered the body of the goldfish, a controlling force cruised within it.

A faint smile appeared on Wang Xian’s face. The Dragon race had absolute control over marine animals and Dragon Energy could even upgrade other marine animals.

He picked up his phone and upgraded the goldfish according to the picture in the phone.

“It’s done.” Looking at the modified Redcap Brown Oranda, Wang Xian’s face was filled with excitement.

The Redcap Brown Oranda which was upgraded using Dragon Energy was much more beautiful than those in the picture.

Moreover, it had a nobility aura around it as though the fish was from a noble race.

Besides that, this Redcap Brown Oranda looked extremely lively. When compared with other Redcap Brown Oranda, this was definitely one of the highest tiers.

“It’s so beautiful. However, upgrading one Redcap Brown Oranda would exhaust two points of Dragon Energy. This exhaustion is a but high. If I am to upgrade larger size fish like arowana and koi carps, it would probably take twenty to thirty Dragon Energy.”

Wang Xian frowned slightly. He had only gained twenty points of Dragon Energy after devouring thousands of jin of fish in the entire lake of the school. After helping Guan Shuqing in the afternoon, he was only left with nineteen points.

“Let’s make some money first. I can gather Dragon Energy by devouring fish in the lake or oceans. Besides that, I can also gather it through cultivation practice.” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Wang Xian thought to himself. Money was still very important to him.

He continued his upgrades using Dragon Energy. Soon, several Redcap Brown Orandas were created.

Looking at the lively and nimble Redcap Brown Orandas in the fishbowl, excitement filled his face.

“Eight goldfish! If we go by the current market price, these would be worth more than two million.”

Wang Xian’s eyes lit up. If he could really get two million, he wouldn’t have to work part-time in the future. He would also be able to allow his sister to truly enjoy her university life.

“I have exhausted 16 points of Dragon Energy and can clearly feel that I have been weakened. I’ve got to cultivate diligently from now on to reach level 2 as quickly as possible and become a true Divine dragon. I will also have to build my own Dragon Palace.”

Looking at the information about himself, Wang Xian’s eyes lit up.

With a casual jump, he jumped onto his bed and immediately sat with his legs crossed on it.
