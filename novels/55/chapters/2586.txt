2587 In the fury of the 2587 Sky Mountain Sword sect

“Good, good, good. Dragon King, it was indeed you who killed all the experts of our Sky Mountain Sword sect. Very good!”

When the elders of the Sky Mountain Sword sect saw Wang Xian’s reaction, they narrowed their eyes slightly and a violent killing intent appeared on their faces instantly!

They were initially uncertain about it but now, they were basically certain about it!

However, what they did not expect was that the Dragon Palace had already provoked the five major forces and now, they actually dared to kill the disciples of their Sky Mountain Sword sect!

“Dragon King, prepare for the Endless Revenge of our Sky Mountain Sword sect. Prepare for the destruction of the Dragon Palace!”

One of the experts from the Sky Mountain Sword sect roared with a ferocious expression!

Among the group of people who entered the Abyss was his grandfather!

Now that he knew that he was killed by the Dragon King and the rest, his heart was filled with endless killing intent!

Only by using fresh blood could he repay his grandfather’s life!

“Are all the people from the Sky Mountain Sword sect seeking death like this?”

Wang Xian looked at them staring at him with murderous intent. His eyes slowly revealed a cold expression!

Buzz

In the next moment, he did not hesitate at all. The Five Elements Millstone appeared in the Void!

“Oh No, run! Return to the sect and destroy their Dragon Palace!”

The Sky Mountain Sword sect elder roared with a grim expression when he saw Wang Xian making a move!

“You want to escape?”

“It’s Too Late!”

Wang Xian said coldly. The Five Elements Millstone was activated and the space-locking formation was activated instantly. Rays of light landed on their figures!

“Not good!”

Everyone was horrified. They quickly turned around and tried to escape into the distance!

Boom

In the next moment, an extremely terrifying energy engulfed them!

“Damn it, the Dragon King wants to kill all of us here. If you dare, the Sky Mountain Sword sect will not let you off!” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The elder of the Sky Mountain Sword sect roared with blood-red eyes and a horrified expression!

“Hehe, why wouldn’t I dare? You are the ones who are courting death. Then, I shall grant your wish!”

Wang Xian’s face was filled with mockery!

In the Abyss, the people of the Sky Mountain Sword sect were courting death. Now, they were here to court death. Did they really think that they wouldn’t dare to kill them?

Boom! Boom! Boom

“No, no, no!”

The terrifying five elemental laws pressed down on them. The faces of the experts from the Sky Mountain Sword sect were filled with despair and pain!

As the destructive attacks landed, the voices stopped abruptly. The elder from the Sky Mountain Sword sect stared at Wang Xian, filled with fear and unwillingness!

They didn’t expect that in front of the Dragon King, they didn’t even have the chance to escape back to their divine kingdom!

This was something that they did not expect at all!

If they knew, they would immediately flee after confirming it!

“HMPH!”

Wang Xian snorted when he saw their corpses and flew directly towards the entrance of the Abyss!

“Go in!”

His figure moved and he immediately entered the abyss. At a terrifying speed, he continued to fly towards the nest of the Giant Mountain and Abyss!

“After coming back this time, I don’t care if it’s the ninth-grade heaven sect or the Sky Mountain Sword sect. As long as they dare to provoke the Dragon Palace, I will make them pay the price!”

He mumbled while his eyes were filled with killing intent!

Just as Wang Xian was hurrying on his way in the abyss, two disciples of the Sky Mountain Sword sect revealed anxious expressions on the land plate at the entrance of the Abyss!

When Wang Xian killed the people from the Sky Mountain Sword sect, there was no one around. Therefore, they didn’t notice the battle that lasted for only a few seconds!

However, there were a few people who didn’t see Wang Xian killing the people from the Sky Mountain Sword sect. However, they saw the people from the Sky Mountain Sword sect flying to the left. Soon, the Dragon Palace flew over from the left!

The people from the Sky Mountain Sword sect couldn’t be contacted all of a sudden, causing the two disciples to be extremely bewildered!

“Let’s go to the entrance of the Abyss!”

The two of them looked at each other and immediately flew towards the entrance of the Abyss!

“No, the elders said that they were waiting around. We can’t contact them now, and they aren’t here either. Could they have entered the Abyss?”

One of the disciples said with an uncertain expression!

“Impossible, the elders definitely won’t enter the Abyss. They can’t directly escape back to the Divine Kingdom after entering the abyss. Immediately inform the experts of the sect!”

The other disciple shook his head with certainty and said to the other person in a deep voice!

“Two disciples of the Sky Mountain Sword sect, we just saw a situation not far away!”

At this moment, two middle-aged men flew over. Their eyes were shining as they threw something at them!

“You are?”

...

The two disciples of the Sky Mountain Sword sect waved their arms, and a ball appeared in front of them. They looked at the two middle-aged men in surprise!

“We are the alliance of the Five Great Forces of the ninth-grade heaven sect. We have been tracking the Dragon King’s whereabouts. We just recorded a scene. It should be related to your Tianshan Sword sect!”

A middle-aged man said with a smile!

“Huh?”

A disciple of the Tianshan Sword sect opened his AI. They took the ball and put it on it!

“Buzz!”

An image appeared. The image was not very clear because of the distance, but they could see that the people of the Tianshan Sword sect had flown to the left not long ago!

A minute later, the Dragon King and the others entered the abyss!

Seeing this video, the pupils of the two people slightly shrank!

“Damn it, let’s copy this video!”

A disciple of the Sky Mountain Sword sect saw the scene in the video and said in an extremely ugly manner!

...

“Of course there’s no problem!”

The two middle-aged men immediately nodded. They did not expect such a pleasant surprise, nor did they expect the Dragon King to be so bold as to dare to kill the members of the Sky Mountain Sword sect at this time!

“Let’s go back immediately!”

Soon, the two disciples of the Sky Mountain Sword sect immediately flew toward the center of the Southern Star System!

The two middle-aged men looked at each other and immediately reported the situation here!

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

A day later, figures filled with murderous intent flew toward them. The old man in the lead stood on a blood-red sharp sword, and the murderous intent on his face was not concealed at all!

Behind them, there were more than twenty experts standing on the sword, and each of them was filled with a cold aura!

“Grandmaster Fa Xuan, please use the formation to find some clues!”

The Sword King on the blood-red sword growled at the long-haired, white-bearded old man!

“It’s the Sword King!”

The long-haired, white-bearded old man beside him nodded and cast one formation after another!

Soon, blurry figures appeared. They were the elders of the Tianshan Sword sect!

They followed the traces and flew about 1,000 kilometers to the left!

“Bang!”

The formation broke down after 1,000 kilometers, causing the long-haired, white-bearded elder’s face to change drastically!

“I can’t sense him anymore. If he doesn’t have a powerful formation jammer on him, he must be a powerful formation master himself!”

The long-haired elder with a white beard said solemnly with a slightly changed expression!

“It’s the Dragon King. In the southern star system, only the Dragon Palace has an array master stronger than Grandmaster FA Xuan. It’s definitely the Dragon King!”

An elder roared with a cold face!

“Dragon King!”

The Sword King who was standing on the blood sword spat out two words coldly, and the blood light on the blood sword started to flow!
