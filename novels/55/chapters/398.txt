Chapter 399: I’ll Kill Anyone Who Offends Me

Ah!

To his horror, the young man realized there were only faint ripples when he wielded his sharp sword at the water snake.

With eyes filled with trepidation, he hurriedly receded.

However, the speed of the water snake burst as it wound itself around the neck of that young man.

“You...” Cough!

Fear filled the young man’s eyes. When he was about to speak, he felt a fearsome strength that choked him, making him breathless.

“How dare a Half-step to Inborn be so insolent! Are you brazen because you think you’re great or is it because the sacred sect is backing you up?” Wang Xian asked disdainfully as he stared at that young man.

“Gentleman over here, stop! We were rude just now. Please forgive us!”

The middle-aged man at the side bowed to Wang Xian with his cupped fist as he looked extremely embarrassed.

The surrounding disciples of Sacred Seas of Swords were looking sheepish as they glared at Wang Xian with tension while holding onto their swords.

They were out to hunt the spiritual fish with no other experts from the sect tagging along. The most formidable ones were two Half-step to Inborns.

“You know you were rude?”

Wang Xian glared at the middle-aged man with contempt as he swung his arm.

Kaka!

A bone-cracking sound was heard. That middle-aged man stared with his eyes wide-opened as he looked to his side immediately.

Bam!

That young man fell on the deck with a loud thud.

All the disciples from Sacred Seas of Swords felt their hearts palpitating violently as traces of fear flashed in their eyes.

“He...He killed Senior Brother Ma. He actually killed the disciple of Sacred Seas of Swords!”

A disciple could not believe his eyes as he exclaimed in a low voice.

“Explain to me the distribution of powers of the sea!” Wang Xian demanded of the disciples of Sacred Seas of Swords.

The middle-aged man had an extremely awful look on his face as trepidation was found in his eyes. He took out a map from his coat and handed it to Wang Xian.

“This is the map of the power distribution in the sea.”

“You could have saved yourself the trouble if you handed it to me earlier.”

Wang Xian sneered when he took over the map as he swept his gaze across everyone.

“I have already given the map to you. What else do you want?”

Sensing a faint killing intent from Wang Xian’s eyes, the middle-aged man slightly darkened his expression as he asked Wang Xian with embarrassment.

“Nothing much. Since you guys made an attacking move on us just now, I want you to receive a move from me too!”

Wang Xian revealed a smile as he expanded his arms.

“You...”

Upon hearing Wang Xian, there was a gloomy look on the middle-aged man while the rest of the Sacred Seas of Swords’ disciples drew their swords immediately.

Boom!

Just then, a booming sound came from the waves suddenly.

All of the Sacred Seas of Swords’ disciples had a change in their expression as they looked to both sides.

The sea turned extremely choppy as though feeling the anger from God of the Sea.

“Oh no, our boat is sinking!”

One of the disciples suddenly realized the sea level and the vessel were on the same level because the vessel was sinking. All he had was a frightened look on his face.

The sea began to rise, swallowing the entire vessel.

Everything looked as though a terrible disaster had arrived as the vessel continued to sink.

“How dare you kill the disciples from Sacred Seas of Swords. The sect will never let you off!”

There was a drastic change in the middle-aged man’s expression as he leaped, making an attempt to flee.

Bam!

However, daunting sea waves suddenly gushed up into the air, throwing him back into the sea.

The vessel sank rapidly. Within a minute, the ocean began to calm down as though nothing had happened here before.

“Let’s go!”

Wang Xian swept his glance around before he made a swift movement to the yacht.

“Brother, I realize those disciples from the so-called Sacred Sects or first-class forces were very haughty. They just killed anyone readily and were tyrannical.”

Xiao Yu did not feel anything for those people who were drowned in the sea by Wang Xian.

Even though she’d just gotten in touch with the Underworld not long ago, she had a strong understanding of what it was like being in the Underworld.

The disciples of the Sacred Sects and Ancestral Clans considered themselves superior as they looked down on those from the weaker sects.

Some of the experts even struck at those weaker ones when things did not go their way.

Speak with your fists. The rules of the jungle were reflected realistically in the Underworld.

Wang Xian smiled as he nodded. “This is the essence. The elephants don’t care for an ant if it’s dead. They will not remember it. Nobody will care about the mosquitoes when they are smacked to death either.”

Those disciples with a strong background or who came from some families were all prideful and full of self-confidence. They loved to look down on those who were weaker than them.

Dragons were too proud to stay in one place with snakes. That was the logic.

Hence, those Sacred Sects were never in the good books of Wang Xian. So it was with the Sacred Followers Guild. One of their elders was killed, and they just sent their men to kill him without asking for any reason.

The Sacred Sea of Swords was the same. When Wang Xian and the gang were passing through this place from afar, they came under fire from the Sacred Sea of Swords.

It was the same this time. They struck after a warning.

Wang Xian never had a good impression of Sacred Sects. Hence, he would leave no mercy for those who provoked him.

Since you want to talk with your fists, then let’s do it. The outcome will be determined by strength.

From now on, I’ll not strike if no one provokes me. But I’ll kill anyone who offends me!

Wang Xian thought to himself as he looked at the map in his hand.

The power distribution map of the sea region included those zones around Asia.

“There are more than a dozen forces throughout the Eastern Sea. The territory occupied by Sacred Sea of Swords is the largest while there are some foreign forces as well!”

The map was very detailed on the territory distribution around the nearby region. Apart from the Eastern Sea, the rest of the areas were covered by many different kinds of forces.

There were at least thirty forces in the entire Asia region. Among which, some of them could be comparable to the Sacred Sea of Swords.

Apart from that, there were some disordered regions in the sea.

The disordered regions were places no forces were occupying except some smaller forces, including Wandering Sea Groups.

Wandering Sea Groups were similar to pirates who dealt with all kinds of business.

Some of the Wandering Sea Groups even dared to enter the territories of other forces.

“Looks like it’s very messy in the ocean as well. Everyone talks with their fists!”

With various forces and Wandering Sea Groups rooted in the sea, it seemed to be extremely chaotic.

Wang Xian briefly exclaimed to himself as he stared at that recreational area, which belonged to the first-class force, Qing Bi Sect.

There was an island surrounded by many cruises making it an attractive tourist spot. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Many affluent people and Martial Artists would go there for some recreational activities.

The yacht was steering toward that region rapidly. After three hours, the cruises appeared before them one by one.

Beside those cruises was a small island that spanned a radius of two to three kilometers.

Various yachts were docked by the side of the island.

Even in the middle of the ocean, this place remained a cool tourist attraction.
