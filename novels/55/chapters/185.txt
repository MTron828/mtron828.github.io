Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

“You guys are courting your death!”

Just as Elder Fang was preparing to pull out her long sword to attack, a voice pierced through the silence.

The four black figures wavered and looked at their surroundings attentively.

“How dare you barge into the forbidden grounds of the Dragon King! How audacious!”

The voice sounded again and a shadow appeared in front of the four black figures, staring at them coldly.

“You...”

The four black figures were shocked by the sudden appearance of an old man and instinctively staggered back several steps.

“You...Who are you?”

“Oh no, we are ambushed!”

The four black figures stared at the old man who appeared suddenly, feeling aghast.

Elder Fang also perked up and stared at the old man in front of her attentively.

To her astonishment, she didn’t manage to see how this old man had appeared.

“Cough cough. The Dragon King is asking you guys a question. If you aren’t answering, I’ll just have to make you talk.”

Mo Qinglong stretched his arms out slowly.

The four black figures looked at Mo Qinglong with heavy expressions. As Mo Qinglong stretched his arms up, a devilish force swept towards them.

“Shit! He isn’t someone we can stand up against! Run! Hurry, run!”

The four black figures were petrified. At the instant the old man raised his arms, they felt the fear of death creeping upon them.

“Can you escape?” Mo Qinglong commented mockingly as waves of dark energy entered the body of the black figures.

The four froze and horrified expressions were seen on their faces.

To everyone’s astonishment, the old man was able to control their bodies just by raising his arms.

Following which, their eyes were shrouded by darkness and their bodies stiffened.

This... is the Devil Path! An Inborn expert!

Elder Fang was horrified to see Mo Qinglong controlling the four men through such a terrifying method.

Devil Path!

Moreover, he was a powerful expert at the Inborn Realm.

An Inborn expert who practices the Devil Path takes orders from Wang Xian? Could it be that he also practices the Devil Path? Elder Fang thought.

“Speak! Who sent you guys here?” Wang Xian asked the four men coldly.

“It’s... It’s our young master!” the four black figures replied together.

“Who is your young master?” Wang Xian continued asking.

“Young Master Liu, Liu Feiyun! He wanted us to come and claim your head and kill off everyone in the villa. He wanted this as his present for his engagement ceremony the next day!” they replied.

“Liu Feiyun! Fine, fine!”

Wang Xian squinted his eyes as murderous intent flashed past his eyes.

He didn’t expect these men to be sent by Liu Feiyun. Furthermore, he ordered these men to decapitate him.

“Since that’s the case, I will send you a congratulatory gift tomorrow!”

“Kill them!” he said coldly to Mo Qinglong.

“Yes, Dragon King!”

Mo Qinglong waved his arms and the four collapsed on the ground.

Elder Fang’s heart skipped a beat as she saw the developments. She looked at Wang Xian with her eyes flickering.

“Get everyone in Rivertown to go to the Lan Family’s villa tomorrow!”

“Yes, Dragon King!”

Mo Qinglong nodded respectfully. Shifting his stance, he disappeared from sight.

Dragon King? Elder Fang thought to herself.

Elder Fang heard how the terrifying Inborn expert addressed Wang Xian. She had a lot of questions in mind but didn’t act rashly.

“You are going to the Lan Family tomorrow? Tomorrow is the day the Lan Family and the Liu Family hold their engagement ceremony,” Elder Fang reminded Wang Xian.

“I know,” Wang Xian replied. He continued calmly, “Elder Fang, you should go get some rest!”

Elder Fang looked at Wang Xian once again. She hesitated but still went back into her room.

She pondered for some time before taking out her mobile phone and calling Sect Leader Tang.

“Elder Fang, did something happen for you to call me at this time?”

The voice of Sect Leader Tang could be heard from the other end of the phone call.

“Sect Leader, I have a very important thing for you,” Elder Fang said solemnly.

“Just say it!” Sect Leader Tang got serious and answered.

“It’s about Xiao Yu’s elder brother, Miracle Doctor Wang.” Elder Fang took a deep breath and continued, “The Liu Family from the Tyrannical Sword sent assassins to assassinate him tonight. However, a terrifying old man appeared and addressed Miracle Doctor Wang as the Dragon King. The old man uses Devilish techniques and is definitely an Inborn expert. With a wave of his hand, he murdered two Level 9 Martial Artists and two Level 8 Martial Artists.”

“Furthermore, Miracle Doctor Wang is preparing to meet the Lan Family tomorrow. My guess is that he will be confronting the Liu Family.”

Liu Family of the Tyrannical Sword! Inborn expert! Dragon King! DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Sect Leader Tang’s expression got worse as Elder Fang spoke. He replied, “I knew Miracle Doctor wouldn’t be simple since he can take out a Level 4 Spiritual Medicine effortlessly. However, I hadn’t expected an Inborn expert to address him as Dragon King.”

“The Liu Family only has an Inborn expert. Since Miracle Doctor Wang dares to go, he should have enough confidence!”

Sect Leader Tang’s eyes flickered as he continued, “Miracle Doctor Wang and Xiao Yu... I will bring some men to the Lan Family tomorrow!”

Elder Fang was stunned after hearing Sect Leader Tang. Nonetheless, she replied respectfully, “Yes, Sect Leader!”

Dragon King and an Inborn expert! Sect Leader Tang started to ponder.

Tonight was fated to be an eventful night for the people of Rivertown.

“None dare to defy once the order of the Dragon King is issued!” the Ren Family Head replied respectfully to the dark shadow.

Mm. The dark shadow nodded, his body moved and disappeared from the luxurious villa.

“The order from the Dragon King had been issued! Rivertown will be chaotic once again!” Ren Family Head said as he looked at the dark shadow disappearing. He could feel a faint pressure from the dark shadow.

However, he knew that this was just an ordinary member of the Dragon Sect.

“Tomorrow is the day the Lan Family and the Liu Family host their engagement ceremony. It seems like the Dragon King is targeting the Liu Family!”

The Ren Family Head eyes flickered and he shouted to those outside, “Come in!”

“Family Head!”

Two people rushed in and addressed him respectfully.

“Gather all the elites of the Ren Family. Follow me and obey the orders of the Dragon King tomorrow!”

“Yes, family head!” The two members were shocked and nodded their heads.

Old Duan got dressed early in the morning and gave his orders to the elites of his family.

Tomorrow, we shall obey the command of the Dragon King!

“Obey the command of the Dragon King!”

“Obey the command of the Dragon King!”

Each and every Ancient Martial Arts Family from Rivertown answered in unison and would obey the command of the Dragon King.

At the Qin Family, Old Qin dressed up and laughed heartily, “Brother Wang Xian wants to blow this up! With the Dragon Sect and everyone from Rivertown, there’s no reason to be scared of the Liu Family. Haha! Incredible! Incredible! Once the order of the Dragon King is issued, no one in Rivertown dares to disobey.”

The news spread to every elite and wealthy man in Rivertown.

Old Qin from the Qin Family had told them personally. The order of the Dragon King had been issued and they shall obey the order tomorrow.

Although this group of people did not understand much about the Dragon King and some might not have heard of him, Old Qin and those wealthy men with connections with Ancient Martial Arts Families had all received the news.

Tomorrow, they shall head to the Lan Family and take orders from the Dragon King.

At night, the whole of Rivertown shook just because of a person’s order.

The night passed by peacefully. However, turmoil had started to brew.

“So, the Dragon King has the Dragon Sect backing him!”

“Dragon King, I have come too!”

At the top floor of a building, a long-haired man stood there and spoke plainly.
