Chapter 1589: 1589 dyed the sky red

“Roar! Roar!”

“Roar! Roar!”

Two roars sounded in front of the royal city of Bingxin. In the sky, a huge abyss gate slowly opened up above the city.

An Abyss Demon Dragon extended its huge and ferocious head.

A roar came from the mouth of the Abyss Demon Dragon.

In front of Wang Xian, a divine light dragon condensed. It had a dazzling white glow, a holy body, and lifelike dragon scales. It also let out a dragon roar.

“How can a person control both the darkness and light attributes!”

“What a terrifying aura. How did we provoke such a powerful enemy!”

“The saint of light and the celestial demon. How did we provoke him? This...”

“Damn it. How dare he come to Our Bingxin Royal City? Who cares about the celestial demon or the saint of Light? Kill him, kill him!”

At this moment, within the Bingxin Imperial City, everyone’s faces were filled with fear as they looked at the Abyssal Demonic Dragon and the Divine Light Dragon in the sky.

The entire huge imperial city was incomparably silent. Tens of millions of people were paying attention.

Some were shocked, while others were incomparably furious.

“It is impossible to break our formation. Our Bingxin Empire has stood for tens of thousands of years. Without the arrival of the profound void tier 9 formation, we can forget about breaking it!”

The king of Bingxin looked at the Abyss Demon Dragon and the Divine Light Dragon that had formed in the sky with an extremely ugly expression. He growled in a low voice.

The three patriarchs also stared at them with a gloomy expression. They did not move at all.

They had already witnessed the strength of Wang Xian and the hunchbacked old man. Even if the three of them joined forces to attack, they were still not a match for Wang Xian and the rest.

They could only rely on the formation in the imperial city to defend and battle.

Looking at the light and dark creatures in the sky, the three of them looked extremely solemn.

“Two dragons converging!”

Wang Xian stared at the two divine dragons of light and dark in the sky. One of the eyes of the two divine dragons slowly turned black.

Roar! Roar

The two divine dragons circled around each other. They had the same strength, so their strength couldn’t hurt the other party at all.

“Kill!”

Wang Xian waved his dragon claw. The two dragons that were circling around each other were completely entangled together. Their bodies rolled and swayed as they attacked the bingxin imperial city directly.

“You want to break through the city of our Bingxin Imperial City with just these two beasts? Dream On!”

Seeing the two light and dark divine dragons that were more than 100 meters in size attacking them, ice master Wufa waved his arm.

“Hum!”

Azure light flashed, and ripples appeared on the Ice Heart Lake.

The ripples surged toward the ice heart imperial city, and a palm that was about 5,000 meters long appeared in the sky.

“Kill these two creatures!”

“Those who dare to attack the Ice Heart Imperial City will die!”

“Those who offend the Ice Heart Imperial City will be killed!”

On the city wall, the experts in the ice heart imperial city shouted in excitement when they saw the enormous palm appear.

“Roar! Roar!”

The two light-dark divine dragons stared at the palm that had completely covered them and let out a roar.

Boom

The gigantic palm landed and the two divine dragons met it head-on.

A terrifying collision sound was heard and the two light-dark divine dragons were sent flying backward.

“HMPH, even if you use all your strength today, don’t even think about stepping into our royal city of Bingxin!”

Bing FA didn’t see this situation. A cold smile appeared on his face as he shouted at Wang Xian.

“Even if we don’t attack, you won’t be able to enter our iceheart imperial city. Sky Demon, Scram immediately!”

The white-bearded old man standing in the middle shouted with anger and confidence.

“Scram, Scram for me!” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Damned Devil, Damned Thing, Scram for me!”

“Even if I stand here and don’t move, you won’t be able to kill me!”

The words of the two patriarchs boosted the confidence of everyone in the Iceheart Imperial City. They cursed at Wang Xian who was standing outside.

“That’s what I’m talking about. Our magnificent Iceheart Empire has stood for tens of thousands of years. How can we be defeated so easily?”

“Although that Sky Devil is powerful, he’s still a little arrogant if he wants to destroy our Iceheart Imperial City!”

“Humph, that darn skyfiend said that he wants us to bleed for thousands of miles. Come over if you have the strength!”

In the quiet city, everyone’s confidence was boosted when they saw the scene outside the city wall.

At the beginning, they were all extremely nervous because of their fear of the name Skyfiend. Now that they saw that the skyfiend could not enter at all, they immediately felt much more relaxed.

Some of the hot-tempered people pointed outside and started cursing.

In an instant, the entire iceheart imperial city became lively.

“Hehe, how interesting. I didn’t expect to see such an interesting scene!”

In a luxurious building closest to the main city gate, more than ten young men and women sat on the roof with smiles on their faces.

From their positions, they could clearly see everything outside.

A young man glanced around with interest on his face as he said with a smile.

“That’s right. The Sky Demon has come to attack the Bingxin Imperial City. This is a matter that will shake the vast region!”

A young man beside him echoed with a smile.

“Humph, so what if it’s the Sky Demon? It’s still watching from the outside!”

A few young men dressed in the uniform of the bingxin imperial family said with cold expressions.

“Haha, but the Sky Demon is very powerful to be able to force you to this point!”

The youth dressed in golden clothes in the middle smiled and looked outside.

They didn’t care that the sky demon wanted to destroy the Iceheart dynasty.

Even if the city gate was breached, they weren’t worried at all.

Because they were disciples of the southern Royal Family!

The Sky Demon did not dare to kill them and offended the southern royal family instead.

“Hehe, this is only the beginning!”

Outside the city gate, Wang Xian heard the curses and taunts coming from within the Imperial City. A hint of a cold smile appeared on his face.

He slowly extended two dragon claws.

The light-dark divine dragon that was sent flying backward swayed its body and continued to circle together.

“Destroy!”

With a low roar, the light-dark divine dragons once again flew toward the city wall.

“Stubborn fools, Continue!”

Seeing the two light-dark divine dragons attacking again, a cold expression appeared on frostfaceless Ice’s face.

He waved his arm, and the huge palm of light struck out again.

“Roar! Roar!”

The light-dark divine dragons’heads were close together, and they let out a dragon roar at the same time.

The huge palm landed on their heads, and waves of power entered their bodies.

“The strongest part of the light and Dark Tai Chi is its defense and transfer. The power that falls on the body of the light and dark divine dragon is transferred to the Dark Divine Dragon, and the power that attacks the dark divine dragon is transferred to the body of the light and Dark Divine Dragon

“The two powers collide and cancel each other out. As long as they don’t exceed the limit of the light and Dark Divine Dragon, they won’t be injured

“Other than that, they can also borrow the other party’s attack to fight with strength, borrow strength, and fight with strength. This is the true essence of the light and Dark Tai Chi!”

Wang Xian stared at the two divine dragons as he muttered.

Following that, his body shook. “Break!”

A loud roar came out from Wang Xian’s mouth. Streams of water formed around the two divine dragons.

The huge palm melted slowly as waves of water energy rotated.

“Roar! Roar!”

Two dragon roars were heard. The light and dark divine dragons carried the water energy around them and attacked Bingxin royal palace directly.
