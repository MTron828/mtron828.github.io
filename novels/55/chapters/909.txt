The appearance of the labyrinth-like demonic cave caused Wang Xian to slow down completely.

Moreover, most of the jellyfish in the labyrinth were in groups.

Every level five extraordinary jellyfish had 20 to 30 underlings. Once they sensed danger, they would immediately flee.

Although the strongest jellyfish here was only level five extraordinary, it was extremely difficult to hunt them down.

In this narrow area, even a level five extraordinaire would have a high chance of dying.

Even a level six extraordinaire would be restricted by the surrounding rocks here. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

This was a place where low-level mercenary groups hunted ferocious beasts, but it was not an ideal place for a powerful mercenary group.

“There are actually three level five extraordinaire jellyfish beasts gathered together. There are more than 50 level three and four extraordinaire Jellyfish Beasts!”

When Wang Xian stayed in the maze for two days, he suddenly saw a densely populated area!

There were three extraordinary level five jellyfish.

“Heaven Billow grass, there are so many heaven billow grass!”

Wang Xian swept his gaze across and his eyes lit up.

Currently, Wang Xian had obtained a total of more than 100 heaven billow grass. However, there were at least 50 to 60 heaven billow grass in the area in front of him!

“After collecting these heaven billow grass, I will leave this place!”

Wang Xian thought to himself. There were not many sea jelly beasts in this dark demon lair. Furthermore, there were too many passageways in the surroundings that gave him a headache.

In two days, they had only killed about 70 to 80 sea jelly beasts. Among them, many of them were at the second level of transcendence.

Therefore, there was no need for them to stay here any longer.

Furthermore, Wang Xian and the rest had already kept the items for the mission.

“Kill!”

Wang Xian pointed with his arm. The group of Strange Beasts immediately hid themselves and came to the group of Jellyfish Beasts lying on the ground.

“PFFT! PFFT! PFFT!”

The highest level of strength was at level five transcendence. Under the attacks of Ao Yao and the rest, they were completely defenseless.

After storing all the jellyfish beasts’corpses into his interspatial ring, Wang Xian looked at the heaven waves grass in front of him.

There were a total of 63 Heaven’s wave grass of extraordinary fourth level.

The Heaven’s wave grass, Heaven’s star grass, and the carcasses of the ferocious beasts in Wang Xian’s possession were worth over a million middle-grade spirit stones.

To other mercenary groups, this was something unimaginable.

For example, the horned shark mercenary group was so powerful that it would require a huge amount of energy to kill a level five extraordinary horned snake.

The huge horned snake was brought to the holy sea town and caused a huge commotion.

Ferocious beasts and demonic beasts were not easy to kill.

Not to mention killing a level five extraordinary ferocious beast and searching for spiritual herbs in Wang Xian’s current environment.

Even if Dao Hen, the number one mercenary group in the Holy Sea Town, brought all his members here, their harvest might not even be one-tenth of Wang Xian’s.

This was even under the circumstances where Dao Hen was personally involved.

“Let’s Go!”

Without any hesitation, Wang Xian led the members of the Dragon Palace out of the demon den and headed in the direction of Shenghai Town.

After successfully returning to Shenghai Town, Wang Xian headed towards the demon hunters association with a smile on his face.

One could pass through the mission stone plate if they accepted the mission. However, they had to go to the demon hunters association if they handed in the mission.

There would be many people in the demon Hunters Association every day. The number of people in the association today was much more than usual.

Wang Xian and the rest went in. They were curious when they saw many people queuing up to submit the mission.

After listening for a while, they realized that it was a mercenary group from Donghai City.

Every few months, the merchants of Donghai town would gather together and hire more than a dozen mercenary groups to come to Shenghai town to deliver supplies.

This resulted in a group of mercenary groups submitting missions together every time.

Wang Xian was waiting in line while a group of members of the Dragon Palace stood at the side.

“The mission this time is really dangerous. The strength of those bandits is beyond imagination!”

“F * ck, if Boss hadn’t made a breakthrough not long ago, we might have died here!”

“After submitting the mission this time, we should be able to advance to a two-star silver-star mercenary group!”

“Hehe, a 2-star silver mercenary group can be ranked in the top 40 in our academy. I’m so tired. After handing in the mission, hurry up and find a place to rest!”

At this time, another group of people came to the mercenary group and began to talk loudly.

This group of people was not very old. They were all young people.

They were talking loudly, but there was a proud look on their faces.

“Such a long line?”

It was obviously their first time in holy sea town. When they saw seven or eight mercenary groups lining up, they were surprised.

“When we reach the gold mercenary group, if there is no gold mercenary group in front, we can directly cut the line!”

A young man said with some yearning.

Reaching the gold mercenary group was a watershed. When a mercenary group reached the gold level, the minimum must be a transcendent level 6 powerhouse.

At this level, when one was handing in the mission, they could directly cut the queue when there were mercenary groups below the gold level at the front.

This was the privilege of a powerhouse.

“Eh? A two-star bronze mercenary group? Hehe, look around. Most of the mercenary groups in Shenghai town are bronze-level. There aren’t many gold-level ones at all!”

“Haha, after all, this is a small town. Our one-star silver-level mercenary group is considered pretty good here!”

The group of people came to the back of Wang Xian and said with a smile when they saw the mercenary group on Wang Xian and the rest.

“Brother, can you give us some space? We are in a hurry!”

At this moment, Wang Xian felt a palm placed on his shoulder and the voice from behind was heard.

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and moved the young man’s hand away. He turned around and said, “I’m sorry, we are also in a hurry!”

“Huh?”

Wang Xian’s words made the young men unhappy. “What, you don’t agree?”

Wang Xian smiled faintly and ignored them.

“Humph, a small two-star bronze mercenary group. We are talking to you guys properly, yet you don’t give us any face!”

A young man saw Wang Xian turning around, and his eyes revealed a hint of coldness.

The corner of his mouth curled up slightly. He swept his gaze across the surroundings and flicked his finger.

The golden needle formed from metal attribute pierced directly toward Wang Xian’s back.

Buzz

Wang Xian sensed the small movement behind him and a golden light flashed across his back.

“Ah!”

A scream came out from the young man’s mouth. He covered his arm with an embarrassed expression.

“What’s going on?”

Everyone in the hall turned around immediately when they heard the young man’s scream. They looked over in astonishment.

“Kid, you actually dared to sneak attack me!”

One of the young man’s palms was covered in blood. He stared at Wang Xian with a gloomy expression.

“I know who is going to sneak attack who!”

Wang Xian glanced at the young man indifferently and said with slight disdain.

“You’re courting death!”

The young man covered his wound and stared at Wang Xian coldly.

“No one is allowed to make a move in the hiring association!”

At this moment, the cold voice of the guard came from the side!
