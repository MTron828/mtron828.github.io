Chapter 462: Annihilating Sacred Sects (3)

“This... How can this... How can this be...? They are too strong and frightening!”

At this very moment, the group from the Sui Clan looked on in horror at the battles developing before their eyes from the side.

In just a few minutes, eight Inborn experts had died from the Medical Saint Sect, Qiao Clan and the other seven forces. There was even one Half-Step to Dan Realm expert that had perished.

What was most shocking were the performances of the few girls.

In the sky, three incredibly young girls were going against the Supreme Elders of the Medical Saint Sect and the Laozu from the Qiao Clan.

Their terrifying strength enabled them to go toe to toe with the Dan Realm unparalleled experts.

It was especially so for the girl in the middle. The faint greyish energy was completely overwhelming the Supreme Elder from the Hua Family of Medical Saint Sect.

His brambles were withering rapidly within the greyish energy. Even one of his jade-green arms was withering gradually within the greyish energy.

Incomparably frightening!

After which, it would be the disciple of their Laozu. This twenty-year-old little girl was standing there with a firebird circling above her head. Wave after wave of terrifying flaming feathers was shot towards the enemies.

She did not stop at all for a few minutes. Every flaming feather was like a terrifying bomb.

Before her, a seven to eight-meter hole appeared on the island. Those that were injured or killed by the flaming feathers numbered several hundreds of people.

Those who hadn’t reached the Inborn Realm couldn’t withstand the flaming feathers at all.

“Little Junior Sister seems to have endless fire attribute energy. She hasn’t stopped at all while constantly releasing highly explosive attacks. Moreover, she doesn’t look fatigued at all. It’s no surprise that our father wanted to take her in as a disciple. She’s frightening!”

“Yeah. She’s really incredible. Under sufficient protection, her destructive powers could even match ten Inborn experts. It’s no surprise that grandpa wanted her as a disciple. She’s insane and too demon-like!”

“It’s not just little Junior Sister who seems like a demon. All the girls around the Dragon King are exceptionally powerful. Three of them are even going toe to toe against three Dan Realm experts!”

The crowd from the Sui Clan was astonished.

“I can now understand why he asked our Xiao Clan and Sui Clan to stay away. With such incredible strength, only Dong Hua Sacred Sect could match them!”

The crowd from the Xiao Clan and their Laozu were stunned and in awe of the battle.

They looked at Guan Shuqing, Lan Qingyue and the girls before turning to their young clan leader.

“Only the Dragon King could raise such terrifying existences. It’s our young clan leader’s greatest blessing to meet the Dragon King!”

“Incredible!”

Xiao Quanshan, who had been standing by the side, was in awe. He looked to the three girls in the air and his eyes were flickering.

“Who are the three girls fighting with the Supreme Elders of the Medical Saint Sect and the Laozu of Qiao Clan?”

“That’s what a battle between immortals would look like. The battle between unparalleled experts could split the sky and destroy the earth!”

“The battle is a thousand meters above the sea. That giant tree swaying, flashes of golden rays, purplish flames torching the skies and devilish aura shooting through the skies are what one should expect for the battles between unparalleled experts!”

At the beach, the crowd of martial artists looked up at the six black dots in the sky.

Battle of the ages! That’s what a battle of the ages should resemble.

They could hear every homing attack and explosion clearly.

“What the hell is that greyish energy?”

At this moment, the Supreme Elder from the Hua Family of Medical Saint Sect stared at Lan Qingyue with one of his arms trembling.

One of his jade-green arms had withered and lost all signs of life.

As for the other arm, it was also exceptionally dull.

The brambles that spanned over several tens of meters and were hovering in the sky were supported by his powerful strength. However, the brambles had lost all signs of life.

It was over ten times harder to control than usual.

Bam! Bam! Bam!

A short distance away, purplish flames and devilish aura clashed. As the Supreme Elder from the Medical Saint Sect swung his arm, the purplish flames within a hundred meter radius swept towards Xiao Yu.

At this moment, Xiao Yu was on the defensive. Her wings were behind her and she was releasing devilish aura towards the purple flames.

On the other end, Elder Fang was surrounded in the space filled with metal energy. Countless invisible blades made of metal energy flew and attacked her.

As the invisible metal blades grazed by her, they left faint marks on her armor.

“What a terrifying defense. The toughness of their black armor is too strong!”

When the Laozu from Qiao Clan slashed down with his long sword on the wings of Elder Fang, he could only knock her back a hundred meters, but could not break through her defense.

This made him incomparably bitter. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

However, other than the Supreme Elder from the Hua Family of Medical Saint Sect, the other two had the upper hand.

Argh!

At this juncture, endless pitiful cries reverberated from below.

The three of them looked down and anger instantly fumed in their eyes.

The elite disciples of the Medical Saint Sect and the Qiao Clan had over ninety percent of their strength all gathered there.

And now, there were several hundred corpses below them.

Incessant pitiful cries came from the disciples of their Sacred Clan and Sacred Sect.

They saw the Dragon King of the Dragon Sect swinging his golden fan towards the Half-Step to Dan Realm experts.

After a few wretched cries, all the Half-Step to Dan Realm experts were killed.

After the few elite experts were killed, Mo Qinglong led the dragonians and killed over ten Inborn experts in an instant.

In the air, the Supreme Elders of the Medical Saint Sect and the Laozu of Qiao Clan shivered in anger. Anger and sorrows filled their faces.

“Dragon Sect, you will perish here!”

A Supreme Elder from the Medical Saint Sect roared furiously. Purplish flames welled up from all parts of his body and swarmed towards Xiao Yu.

“This is bad!”

Xiao Yu was caught by surprise and could only fly higher into the sky.

Huh?

However, Xiao Yu was astonished to find that his target wasn’t her.

The Supreme Elder of the Medical Saint Sect descended from the sky like a meteor towards the dragonians.

“It’s your Medical Saint Sect that will perish!”

A dull gold light glowed in Wang Xian’s eyes as he saw the Supreme Elder from the Medical Saint Sect getting ready to attack and kill the dragonians.

“Today, this will be the burial site for the Medical Saint Sect and the Qiao Clan. No one is getting away!”

As he spoke, he moved and charged towards the Dan Realm expert covered in purplish flames.

“Little crook! Even if I have to sacrifice this old life of mine, I’ll annihilate all of you!”

A purplish light beamed from the eyes of the Supreme Elder from Medical Saint Sect and his eyes turned red.

“Hehe! You are thinking too highly of yourself!”

Wang Xian moved and appeared before him instantly as a ray of dull gold light.

“Die!”

A golden dragon claw appeared and ripped towards the Supreme Elder from the Medical Saint Sect.

“Thinking of killing me?”

The Supreme Elder of the Medical Saint Sect condensed the purplish flames around him together. The temperature was so high that the flames appeared black.

The dull purplish flames turned into a beast and pounced towards Wang Xian.

Roar!

The cry of a wild beast reverberated. The next moment, the golden dragon claw held the beast by the neck and ripped it apart. Without a loss in momentum, Wang Xian continued his charge towards the Supreme Elder of the Medical Saint Sect.

Boom!

The golden dragon claw penetrated and split the body into two.

An unparalleled expert had fallen!
