Chapter 1113: Level 3 Dragon Palace, 11

Translator: 5496903

In seven days, the group of girls had settled everything on Earth.

Xiao Yu and Feng Lingtian had also settled everything at home. Feng Lingtian’s father, Ling Xiao, did not follow them.

Looking at the dark passage, everyone in the Dragon Palace was excited.

A fighting spirit was emitted from their bodies.

At this moment, there were 800 demon monkeys of the Demon War Department standing behind Wang Xian. All of them had the strength of level four transcendence.

The 800 members of the Thunder Department were also at level four transcendence!

The 800 members of the Dragon Defense Department were all at level four transcendence!

The 400 members of the Golden Swordfish clan of the Dragon Guards were all at level four transcendence other than ao Jian’s 11 strong ones!

There were 100 members of the eight-headed poison-making department who were at Transcendent Level 4.

There were 220 dolphins, and all of them had reached transcendent level 5.

There were 150 bizarre demons. The current bizarre demons could be called light spikes. This group of light spikes didn’t include the bizarre demons who had followed Wang Xian previously.

The 150 bizarre demons and the reserve members of the dragon spikes had all reached transcendent level 6!

There were also 50 civil officials trained by Prime Minister Gui and 100 members in charge of the Dragon Palace.

The members of the various races who had broken through the Dragon Gate had all chosen a direction of evolution to make up for the various legions of the Dragon Palace!

There were a total of more than 3,500 members of the Dragon Palace.

This was the full strength of the Dragon Palace. It was not strong, but it was definitely not weak.

The main reason was that the light thorn tribe was the strongest. With 150 light thorns, they were able to assassinate an enemy at level eight extraordinary.

In addition to the 20 people who had reached level seven extraordinary and Ao Yaozai, the strength of Wang Xian’s subordinates was only slightly weaker than the Phoenix and Dragon Army.

“This is a new journey. We must let the Dragon Palace stand at the top of the extraordinary continent!”

Wang Xian was also extremely excited.

“We will fight for the Dragon King and the Dragon Palace to the death!”

The members of the Dragon Palace roared loudly.

“Alright, Ao Yaoyao, Ao Jian, you guys lead the way. Everyone, enter the passageway!”

Wang Xian waved his arm and said directly.

“Yes!”

Ao yaoyao, Ao Jian, was the first to enter the passageway. Behind him, Prime Minister Gui and the rest followed closely behind.

One by one, the members of the Dragon Palace entered the passageway. In the end, Shu Qing, the girls, Xiao Yu, and the rest also entered the passageway.

“Move the Dragon Palace to the other end of the passageway!”

After everyone left, Wang Xian looked at the Dragon Palace and thought to himself.

Ding! “Congratulations to the host for conquering the ocean of a planet. In order to leave behind the race of the Divine Dragons on this planet, the system will establish a level one dragon palace to remain on Earth!”

At this moment, the system’s voice sounded. Wang Xian was stunned for a moment before a smile appeared on his face.

This time, Wang Xian had left behind some foundations on Earth after entering the extraordinary mainland.

Prime Minister Gui left behind a few civil servants and a few subordinates of the Dragon Palace on Earth. They taught the water tribe who had potential and nurtured them into strong individuals. They were continuously transported to the Dragon Palace on the extraordinary mainland.

However, the system was even more considerate and left behind a level one dragon palace.

“Let’s Go!”

The huge Dragon Palace entered the extraordinary mainland through a passageway. A miniature version of a level one dragon palace appeared beside it.

Wang Xian’s body moved and entered the extraordinary mainland through the passageway.

At the last moment, a gigantic object that was more than a thousand meters long entered the passageway.

“Let’s Go!”

The Dragon Palace appeared out of thin air in the ocean of the extraordinary mainland. The gigantic dragon palace descended to the bottom of the ocean like a miracle.

The Dragon Palace with a radius of 20 kilometers instantly attracted the attention of all the ferocious beasts and demonic beasts in the surroundings.

“Let’s go over immediately!”

Wang Xian moved his body and the members of the Dragon Palace entered the Dragon Palace in an instant. They were observing their surroundings.

Boom

At this moment, the Dragon Palace suddenly trembled. The formation protecting the Dragon Palace was shattered.

“This is bad. A level-two dragon palace can’t withstand the attacks of the creatures of the extraordinary mainland!”

Wang Xian’s expression changed slightly. He transformed into a divine dragon and let out a dragon’s roar. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Xiao Lan!”

Lan qingyue immediately shouted at Xiao Lan who was following behind.

Xiao Lan’s body shook and a terrifying aura spread out in the surroundings instantly.

The five giant squid that was attacking the Dragon Palace turned into a bloody mist and entered its body after being knocked lightly by it.

“Ao Yao, your clan will be around to prevent other ferocious beasts from attacking. Let’s Go!”

Controlling the Dragon Palace, they flew quickly towards the base of the Dragon Palace.

In fact, this was not the first time Wang Xian had come to the base of the Dragon Palace. He was no stranger to it.

The Sea Mountain region was not far from the current Dragon Phoenix city.

Mountain peaks stretched out from the sea, but this did not affect the migration of the Dragon Palace.

On the contrary, this was the most suitable place in the vicinity.

The sea here was more than 20,000 meters deep, which was close to the extraordinary mainland. There were no powerful fierce beasts or demon beasts around.

However, even if it was close to the sea, a dragon palace with a circumference of 20 kilometers had traveled dozens of kilometers, which caused a huge sensation at the bottom of the sea.

Fierce Beasts swam over quickly. When they saw the Dragon Palace, their eyes were filled with greed.

Some of the ferocious beasts flew towards the dragon palace recklessly and were killed by AO Yaoyao and Ao Jian.

“I have to upgrade the Dragon Palace to level three!”

Wang Xian looked at the level two Dragon Palace. The ferocious beasts from the supernatural continent could basically break through the array formation and enter the Dragon Palace directly.

He looked at the items in his interspatial ring and smiled.

It was not very difficult for the Dragon Palace to upgrade to level three. The spiritual stones only required 100 million middle-grade spiritual stones, the array formation of the supernatural level, and various materials.

When he was in dragon-phoenix City, Wang Xian had collected the corpses of the ocean cultivators. The interspatial rings of the tens of thousands of soldiers were also in his hands.

The items inside were sufficient to upgrade the level of the Dragon Palace.

“The materials required for the construction of the Dragon Palace have always been a benefit given by the system!”

Wang Xian was full of smiles as he looked ahead. The Sea Mountain region appeared in front of him.

Buzz

Wang Xian moved the Dragon Palace to the center of the Sea Mountain region. It occupied a quarter of the entire sea mountain region.

Boom

When the Dragon Palace landed at the bottom of the sea, it was perfectly compatible with the surrounding environment.

“The upgrade of the Dragon Palace requires 100 million middle-grade spirit stones and ten extraordinary-grade formations...”

Wang Xian looked at the requirements for the upgrade and took out the items from his interspatial ring.

“I found ten extraordinary level formations. Do you want to merge them to upgrade the Dragon Formation?”

“I found ten million middle-grade spirit stones and five tons of extraordinary materials to upgrade the Dragon King Palace!”

...

One by one, the materials were taken out and quickly absorbed by the Dragon Palace.

“Ding! All the buildings in the Dragon Palace have been upgraded to level three. The Dragon Palace has been upgraded!”

At this moment, the Dragon Palace began to undergo a tremendous change at the bottom of the sea, which was twenty thousand meters below the sea.

All the buildings were expanding at a terrifying speed.

The ocean-pacifying needle, which was more than 100 meters tall, slowly became more than 500 meters tall.

The Dragon King Palace, which was about 2,000 meters wide, became five times bigger, and the 50-meter-long dragon throne became 100 meters long!

The Dragon Palace was evolving rapidly!
