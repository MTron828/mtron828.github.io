Chapter 1066: 10

Translator: 5496903

In front of the East Gate of the Holy Sea Town, the bearded old man and the old man from the ocean academy who were riding on birds and beasts also looked at the demon Hunters Academy with curiosity.

One of the five instructors was missing, and more than seventy students were missing.

Some of the students were injured. It was obvious that those who had not arrived were most likely dead.

It shouldn’t be too dangerous for them to travel from East Ocean City to holy sea town, so how could they be so seriously injured.

However, although they were surprised, their faces were full of mockery.

Behind them, the people from East Ocean Academy and Ocean Academy were also full of mockery.

“Isn’t the demon Hunters Academy said to have the most combat experience? Why are they so slow to come to holy sea town this time, and they even lost so many people? It seems that they don’t live up to their name!”

“TSK tsk, I thought we were slow enough. I didn’t expect that there would be others who were slower than us and suffered such heavy losses.”

“Maybe they thought that they were experienced and powerful, so they were arrogant. In the end, they didn’t expect to be in danger. Haha!”

The students of the two academies didn’t try to hide their ridicule at them. Their faces were full of schadenfreude.

When the Demon Hunters Academy students who had just walked over heard their words, their faces instantly revealed an angry expression.

More than 70 of them had died, and one of their instructors had also lost his life. Now, they were still being ridiculed. Naturally, they were very angry.

Everyone’s faces revealed an aggrieved expression.

“Director Qian, what’s going on with you guys? With your strength, there shouldn’t be any ferocious beasts that can threaten you guys on this path, right?”

However, although there was a trace of mockery in the mouths of the two old men from East Ocean Academy and Ocean Academy, they still looked at them with concern. Their gazes landed on director Qian as they asked with a frown.

With the strength of the Demon Hunters Academy and their experience, they really shouldn’t have suffered such heavy losses.

When director Qian heard the words of the two old men, his expression became even more unsightly.

Could he say that all of this was because of him?

“There are some problems!”

Director Qian said with a sullen face.

“Huh?”

The two old men raised their eyebrows and didn’t ask any more questions.

“Sirs, your residences have been prepared. Please go and rest for a while. When the experts of the ocean corps arrive, we will be ready to move!”

An old man saw that the students from the Demon Hunters Academy had arrived as well and said to them.

“Alright, thank you for your trouble!”

The old man with a long beard who was riding on the birds and beasts nodded his head.

“My Lords, please come in!”

The old man invited them as they followed behind him and headed towards the holy sea town.

Compared to Donghai City, the difference between the holy sea town and Donghai City was huge. be it the city walls or the size of the town, it was incomparable.

Wang Xian looked at the town that he was in for the first time. A smile appeared on his face as he had a small sense of belonging.

Following the old man to the seat of the Mayor’s residence, the group of people were arranged in a large manor behind the mayor’s residence.

The students from the three academies were arranged in a different area. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Let’s Rest for a while. We might have a mission to carry out soon!”

Ever since they entered Shenghai Town, Wang Xian had felt a tense atmosphere. All the mercenary groups had gathered together with their weapons.

There were very few people on the streets.

This atmosphere was obviously the tense atmosphere before the big battle. Even the ordinary citizens were making preparations.

Therefore, it was impossible for them to rest for a long time.

Wang Xian reminded everyone.

“Yes, Captain!”

Everyone nodded and sat down to rest. All of them behaved obediently.

“Captain, we’ll be depending on you for the next mission. We’ll definitely follow your orders!”

“That’s right, that’s right. We’ll follow your orders!”

A few students came to Wang Xian’s side and said fawningly.

The rest of the students also said hurriedly.

The incident just now had let them know that a mentor might not be as reliable as the leader.

The mission had yet to begin. Now was the time to cling onto the leader’s good side. Moreover, the leader’s strength had reached level seven of the supernatural realm.

There were also eleven subordinates who were at level seven of the supernatural realm. They were also very strong.

“As long as all of you listen to the leader’s commands, I will ensure your safety!”

Wang Xian looked at their fawning gazes, waved his hand and said plainly.

“Definitely, definitely!”

The students quickly promised.

When director Qian saw this scene, he looked extremely embarrassed. The three instructors looked hesitant.

“Student Wang Xian, how did you... how did you find out that there was danger there?”

One of the instructors couldn’t help but ask.

“Eye technique, an eye technique that specializes in detection!”

Wang Xian’s eyes revealed a strange glint as he looked at the instructor.

The instructor looked at him and instantly felt as though he was stripped naked. He hurriedly avoided Wang Xian’s eyes in fear.

“I see, I see. We were wrong this time. I hope Wang Xian doesn’t mind. The matter of leading the team will depend on Wang Xian!”

The instructor lowered his stance and said.

“Don’t Worry!”

Wang Xian nodded his head.

The other two instructors nodded at Wang Xian with a friendly expression.

Even director Qian’s eyes were filled with surprise. However, his eyes turned gloomy again.

Pupil technique was a very powerful divine ability.

“Everyone, the leader of the Ocean Corps is here. Please come and discuss the situation!”

Not long after, the old man walked over again and spoke to them.

“Alright!”

A few of the instructors nodded their heads and looked at Wang Xian. “Student Wang Xian, you should come over too!”

“Okay!”

Wang Xian nodded his head and followed them.

As soon as he walked out of the courtyard, Wang Xian saw a group of instructors from the East Ocean Academy and the Ocean Academy.

Behind the instructors were two young men.

Both of them looked at Wang Xian with a curious expression.

“It’s You!”

When one of them saw Wang Xian, his face was filled with surprise. His expression slowly darkened.

Wang Xian looked over and saw that he was dressed in the same aquamarine-colored clothes. It was the young man, Hai Wen, whom he met at the auction the other day. He was also called Young Master Hai.

“Eh, you’re the leader of the Demon Hunters Academy? Why haven’t I heard of someone like you?”

The other young man looked at Wang Xian curiously and sized him up.

“Wang Xian from the Demon Hunters Academy!”

Wang Xian nodded his head faintly.

“Wang Xian?”

The young man shook his head slowly. He had never heard of him.

“So you are a student of the Demon Hunters Academy and the leader of the Demon Hunters Academy!”

Hai Wen stared at Wang Xian with a cold face.

The last time he was at the auction, he had lost a lot of face. It was all because of this guy.

“Hehe!”

Wang Xian glanced at him and ignored him.

“HMPH, the reason why the Demon Hunters Academy suffered such a heavy loss this time should be because of you, right?”

When Hai Wen saw that Wang Xian ignored him, he sneered with a cold face, “As the leader, you actually suffered such a heavy loss even when you arrived at Shenghai Town. I think you should go home!”

“Huh?”

The group of teachers who were walking in front turned around curiously and looked at director Qian who had a solemn expression on his face.

“Could it really be because of this kid? He caused the demon hunters academy to suffer heavy losses?”

“Judging from the looks of director Qian and the rest, it’s very possible that this kid is the descendant of the higher-ups of the Demon Hunters Academy?”

“It’s possible!”

The teachers were deep in thought as they thought to themselves.

“Shut up!”

Wang Xian glanced at him and said faintly.
