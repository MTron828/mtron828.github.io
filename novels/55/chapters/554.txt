Chapter 555: My Name Will Start To Spread (4)

“Not too bad to have you guys as punching bags!”

“I can defeat all of you in twenty moves!”

Disciples from Mt. Tianshui walked out with overbearing confidence.

“Let’s do it. I’ll make sure all of you admit your defeat today!”

The youth in the center raised his hand as he drew his longsword.

“Haha, great!”

Hua Yu cast a look at Yu Ling’er and the rest behind him. They had the absolute confidence in winning this five on five group battle.

There was no hesitation for them. With Wang Xian around, they had a hundred percent chance of winning!

“Your guidance is much appreciated!” said Wang Xian with his sword in his hand as Yu Ling’er and the rest walked over and put up a ready stance.

His sword was still in the scabbard when he spoke. However, his sword was drawn as soon as he finished.

“Hur? I’ve never seen this lad in Mt. Fengyu before.”

Upon seeing Wang Xian ready to strike at them, the five young men from Mt. Tianshui furrowed their brows.

The petite girl brought several youngsters over with a broad smile.

The young man who had her in his arms even whispered to her that two chickens were pecking each other. [1] Then, they looked up at them.

“You’re so eager for a beating! Beichuan Senior Brother, thrash Mt. Fengyu!”

“Seeking your own doom. Beichuan Senior Brother, teach them a lesson!”

The group of surrounding disciples from Mt. Tianshui cheered loudly.

“Hmph, digging your own graves!”

Coldness flashed across Wang Beichuan and his gang as they drew their swords.

Four water clones with swords in their hands popped out around Wang Xian as he jerked his body. Wang Xian was also wrapped in the water current.

“Illusory sword!”

The surroundings were instantly filled with mist after the sword left the scabbard.

“Insignificant trick!”

The disciples from Mt. Tianshui watched the strike from Wang Xian with contempt.

“Let’s do it too!”

Immediately, Hua Yu called out to his members after he was stunned by Wang Xian, who took the lead.

“Where’s the next location!?”

Bam, Bam, Bam!

However, all the water clones and Illusory swords before them dissipated at this time!

Along with which came five crashing sounds.

“No... how is this impossible?”

“Wow, damn. He’s powerful!”

Only shocking and painful moans were left in the air.

Wang Xian was already standing at the spot where the five young men stood while they were lying on the floor.

“Next, next...,” Hua Yu stammered with a stupefied look.

“Next is Mt. Xuanshui, ranked seventeenth!”

Hua Yu only managed to complete his sentence after a long time.

“Let’s go!”

Wang Xian turned around as he spoke to Hua Yu.

“Wait, Big brother. Hang on!”

Hua Yu looked like he was in a trance before he sprinted to a mountain in front of the training field of Mt. Tianshui.

On that mountain was a Spiritual Stone, which he gently pulled.

“Okay, our ranking is up. We’re going to Mt. Xuanshui!”

“Let’s go!”

Sensing the impatience of Wang Xian, he hurriedly assured him, “Let’s go, Big brother!”

The disciples from Mt. Fengyu behind him were dumbfounded. They expected a win, but not an instant kill!

They stared blankly at Wang Xian with a hint of horror in their eyes.

The new disciple from Mt. Fengyu was not a simple character.

Yu Ling’er felt even more complicated as she fixed her eyes on Wang Xian in a daze.

Mt. Fengyu’s disciples rode on their swords and left, and the entire process only took two minutes.

All the disciples from Mt. Tianshui were stunned, looking at the five senior brothers lying on the ground.

“Instant kill. He could knock out Beichuan Senior Brother and the rest single-handedly. The strength of that young man was so damn strong!”

“How did this happen? When did Mt. Fengyu recruit such a powerful disciple? This...”

All the disciples of Mt. Tianshui revealed an incredulous look.

They knew Mt. Fengyu like the back of their hands. But now... it turned out...

“How did this happen? The strength of that young man!”

Several youngsters beside that petite girl had shock plastered on their faces.

“This is interesting. Mt. Fengyu actually recruits a disciple who possesses remarkable strength.”

The young man who was holding the petite girl in his eyes had a brief stunned moment before he commented with flickering radiance in his eyes.

“He’s quite strong. I’d guess he’s at least a Half-Step to Dan Realm, and somewhat skilled in his Illusory swords and water clones.”

Another young man nodded in agreement.

“Given his strength, he should be able to lead Mt. Fengyu into the top fifteen!”

“Almost there. The rest of the Mt. Fengyu disciples are just too lousy!”

Those disciples who came from the mountain sect that was ranked twelfth began to comment.

“Interesting. Let’s follow them and see how far that lad can lead Mt. Fengyu in terms of ranking!”

The young man smiled with his lips quirked. He stood on the sword and rode away.

“Let’s follow them. It was a surprise for Mt. Fengyu to have an expert. I want to check out their results too!”

Wang Beichuan swept the water droplets off his body with embarrassment as he spoke with a sullen face.

“Let’s go!”

The group of Mt. Tianshui disciples hesitated before they hopped on their swords and headed to Mt. Xuanshui.

“Next...”

Just when the Mt. Tianshui disciples arrived at Mt. Xuanshui, a clear and icy tone cut the air.

Everyone froze.

The young man who had the petite girl in his arm raised his eyebrow. “Consuming his physical strength at such a rate is not wise!”

“If he continues his incessant challenges, he can only stop at fifteenth. There are Half-Step to Dan Realm experts within the top fifteen sects!”

Some of them commented when they saw Mt. Fengyu disciples rushing over to another mountain sect.

“Let’s keep up with them this time!”

The group of youngsters darted out while the Mt. Tianshui disciples followed suit. Those Mt. Xuanshui disciples who had just been just defeated also went over with curiosity.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

A total of ninety disciples from two mountain sects followed behind.

When they arrived at the mountain sect ranked sixteenth, the disciples in that mountain sect were freaking out.

“It’s just a challenge. Why did so many people come and make me jump?”

A wild and young man walked out, beckoning some of the surrounding disciples.

Ten seconds later!

“Damn, he’s awesome. Another kill in seconds!”

“They’re going to Mt. Wuyin. But Qin Shan from Mt. Wuyin is a Half-Step to Dan Realm Expert. It’s impossible to achieve another kill within seconds!”

“This disciple from Mt. Fengyu is really fierce. I bet he could beat Qin Shan!”

The disciples of Mt. Fengyu rode on their swords with over a hundred followers behind them.

All the followers were those who had been defeated by them.

Damn, killing in seconds. It took him just one move to finish five strongest experts within the mountain sect. Now that they are challenging another mountain sect, they cannot miss it.

All the people behind the disciples of Mt. Fengyu were discussing how far this new disciple could go.

Seeing all the disciples from 16, 17, 18 placings following behind them, the disciples of Mt. Fengyu exhibited thrills on their faces.

In the beginning, they had scorned this new disciple who just joined. But it soon developed from shock to respect, and eventually worship.

Instant kill!

The ranking of Mt. Fengyu leveled up a lot, and the resources in the ancestral sect almost doubled!
