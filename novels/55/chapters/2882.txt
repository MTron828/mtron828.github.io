Chapter 2883: divine dragon went on the expedition

“This is the Dragon Palace?”

The Sacred Lord and the others entered the Dragon Palace and looked at the majestic palace with sparkling eyes.

The Dragon Palace didn’t shock them too much.

After all, the current Dragon Palace was only a grade-7 dragon palace and could only withstand attacks from those below the divine emperor level.

However, the Majestic Dragon Palace, the divine dragons circling on the pillars, and the huge dragon throne in the Dragon King Palace gave them the feeling that they were pure divine dragons.

There was a feeling that this was where the Divine Dragons lived.

“Prime Minister Gui, get ready to receive the guests.”

Wang Xian instructed Prime Minister Gui.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Prime Minister Gui immediately replied and began to prepare.

“Prepare to attack the Heaven Magus region in half a month’s time!”

After entertaining the Holy Lord and the rest, Wang Xian called Prime Minister Gui over when the Godly monarchs of the Holy Region flew out of the Dragon Palace and strolled around the Dragon Island.

“Dragon King, are all the disciples of the Dragon Palace going on this expedition?”

Prime Minister Gui pondered for a moment and asked.

“There’s no need. Just lead the strongest disciples of the 100,000 Dragon Palaces. All the Divine Emperors will go on this expedition.”

Wang Xian shook his head. A cold glint flashed in his eyes.

“In half a month’s time, the three wind god dragons will have completed their breakthroughs. By then, with our strength, we will be able to sweep through the imperial court and the Witch Formation Association, as well as the Heaven Magus region.”

Wang Xian’s face was filled with confidence.

“Yes, Dragon King. I will go and prepare now.”

Prime Minister Gui nodded immediately.

In the next few days, the Saint Lord of the Holy Region and the others stayed on the Dragon Island for three days before leaving.

After they returned, the Saint Lord announced that they would become friendly neighbors with the Dragon Palace of the Imperial Star Field.

As for the rest, he did not announce too many things.

After all, they were the ones who announced that they would become friendly neighbors with the Dragon Palace.

It was also the sacred lord who brazenly announced it.

The sacred Lord’s announcement caused the entire holy region to boil again. Then, it was transmitted from a planet at the edge of the Holy Region. The Dragon Palace had a divine dragon, a true divine dragon.

This made many people extremely surprised.

However, there was no evidence that the Dragon Palace had a divine dragon. Although countless people discussed it, not many people believed it.

News of the Dragon Palace’s Dragon King’s strength had spread throughout the entire holy region.

What was killing two divine emperors so easily.

The god-killing emperor was like killing ants.

There were all kinds of words.

God-emperor Hong Fengyan and the others from Shangshui did not leave the Dragon Island. When they learned that the Dragon Palace was going to conquer the Heaven Wizard region, invincible in battle techniques was excited and prepared to follow them.

Hong Fengyan was also prepared to follow the Dragon Palace. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

In the past few days, they had been strolling around the Dragon Island under the guidance of invincible battle technique.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

Half a month passed quickly. When the roars of the Dragon Palace rang out, the entire Dragon Palace started to move.

100,000 of the strongest members of the Dragon Palace quickly flew into the dragon field.

The leaders of the Dragon Palace immediately flew over.

“Roar!”

Nine Wind God Dragons flew over from the front.

The three wind god Dragons in the center were 25,000 meters tall and gave off a powerful pressure.

These three wind god Dragons had made a breakthrough yesterday and had the strength of a rank two divine emperor.

Boom! Boom! Boom

Behind the group of Wind God Dragons, the leaders of the Dragon Palace landed in front of the members of the Dragon Palace.

There were 13 divine emperors and 13 towering figures.

After killing two divine emperors from the eight barrens and one divine emperor from the imperial court, the Dragon Palace had three more divine emperors.

Including Wang Xian and the nine wind god Dragons, the number of divine emperors in the Dragon Palace had reached 23.

Among them, the strength of the Heaven Array could not be calculated by an ordinary first level divine emperor.

Secondly, there was Xiao Lan’s little house. Including them, there were a total of 25.

Wang Xian came to the front of the members of the Dragon Palace. He swept his gaze across them and revealed a smile.

“All members of the Dragon Palace, Get Ready!”

He shouted softly and the incorporeal holy wings appeared on his back. His body was emitting a powerful dragon aura.

“As You Command, Dragon King!”

The 100,000 members of the Dragon Palace immediately shouted.

Among the 100,000 members of the Dragon Palace, the weakest one had the combat strength of a level 6 immortal king.

Currently, they were the most elite group of the Dragon Palace.

“Let’s go to the Heaven Wizard Territory!”

Wang Xian waved his arm and shouted loudly.

“Let’s go to the Heaven Wizard Territory!”

The members of the Dragon Palace shouted loudly.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

The three divine wind dragons in the lead flew forward with a low roar. The other six divine wind dragons followed closely from both sides.

“Boom!”

Their wings trembled slightly as a dragon sedan materialized behind them.

The Dragon sedan was extremely huge and had a circumference of ten kilometers.

There was a dragon chair in front of the Dragon sedan.

“Let’s Go!”

Ao Jian and Prime Minister Gui moved to the left and right of the Dragon Chair.

One of them represented the dragon guards while the other represented the important ministers of the dragon.

Wang Xian moved to the Dragon Chair and commanded.

“Roar, Roar, Roar!”

The Nine Divine Wind Dragons roared and flew out of the Dragon Palace with the Dragon Chair.

“Splash!”

The Divine Wind Dragons poked out of the sea while the members of the Dragon Palace followed behind.

“Wu Wu Wu!”

When they arrived, muffled sounds came from both sides.

The enormous little blue and the small house flew out of the sea.

“Get on the War Kun!”

Prime Minister Gui ordered the members of the Dragon Palace.

“Yes!”

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

60,000 members of the Dragon Palace flew toward little blue, and 40,000 members of the Dragon Palace flew toward the small house.

With little blue’s small house’s size, not to mention a 100,000-strong army, even a million-strong army would be able to support it.

“My Goodness!”

On the side of the Dragon Palace, the invincible God Emperor of Shangshui, Hong Fengyan, and his disciples were slightly speechless when they saw this scene.

The nine wind dragons were at the front, pulling a dragon chair.

On the two enormous beasts at the back, there were 100,000 members of the Dragon Palace.

The Dragon Palace didn’t send many people this time, but they were all experts.

Every one of them was a core existence in any force.

Especially the god-emperors who were emitting terrifying auras.

They could sense that there were 25 of them.

There were 25 god-emperors. Before Hong Fengyan broke through, there were only five god-emperors.

“Liuli’s celestial thearch is only so-so.”

Shangshui celestial thearch muttered.

“Master, I’m going too. I’m going to stand on that giant beast and sweep through a region. Together with the Divine Dragon, I’m going to conquer the imperial court and destroy the Witch Association!”

Invincible battle technique looked at his master with excitement.

“If the Dragon King is willing to take you, you can go.”

Shangshui Celestial Thearch looked at his disciple and said.

“Hahaha, good, good!”

“Boss Wang, Wait, Bring Me along!”

Invincible opened his mouth and flew over excitedly.

“Hehehe, little guy, come over here!”

Wang Xian glanced at him and smiled faintly.

On Xiao Lan’s body, the octahedron waved at him.
