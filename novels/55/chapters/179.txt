Chapter 180: The Treatment

“The trio is so arrogant! The first thing they did was to demand Miracle Doctor Wang to follow them to Dianlang Sect to treat their Big Brother!”

“That guy with long hair looks so strong! The trio was terrified by just a sentence from him. Even the middle-aged man with long hair had to queue with his son for the treatment and yet the trio dared to demand that the miracle doctor follow them to Rongzhou right away. Don’t they know the rules here? How dare they still kick up a fuss here.”

At this moment, those around the group started to whisper to one another.

As the trio overheard the conversations, their bodies stiffened. There was a flicker of fear in their eyes.

Even the Maniac Ji brought his son here for treatment and queued patiently for his turn. This...

Is he just a Miracle Doctor that ranked near the twenties in the ranking board? Even the Miracle Doctor that ranked 9 was murdered when he offended the Maniac Ji.

“We are sorry, Miracle Doctor Wang, we will scram immediately. Immediately!”

The trio left the place immediately with fear evident on their faces.

Looking at the trio with slight disdain, Wang Xian shook his head slowly. It was human nature to bully the weak and be fearful of the strong.

Ignoring this brief interlude, Wang Xian walked to the last person in the queue and continued with his treatment.

After five minutes, he nodded with satisfaction and walked out. “Let’s go take a look at your son,” he said to Maniac Ji.

“Yes.”

With a flicker of hope in his eyes, Maniac Ji nodded his head and followed Wang Xian up the stairs.

At the second story, Maniac Ji walked to his son who was on the bed. His eyes were filled with love he had for his son.

With determination in his eyes, he said, “Miracle Doctor Wang, I can promise you anything so long as you can cure my son!”

Wang Xian nodded his head and looked at the young man who was on the bed. “Haven’t you look for other skilful Miracle Doctors to treat him?”

Maniac Ji replied in a solemn expression, “I once approached the ranked 4 Miracle Doctor. He told me that only the 10,000-years Cleansing Elixir could cure him.”

The 10,000-years Cleansing Elixir was considered to be Level 7 or 8 spiritual medicine. Disregarding the chances of finding it, whether it really existed was a question. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

After hearing from the Maniac Ji, Wang Xian reached out and lifted the young man’s arm. He felt a slight warmth from his arm and a faint glow emitting from his arm. However, one could also vaguely see that his bones had turned black.

The toxins had already bound with his bones. Ordinary medical techniques couldn’t possibly cure it. It would require a large amount of strong spiritual herbs to purge the toxins from the bones.

While holding the young man’s arm, Wang Xian injected a stream of Azure Dragon energy into his body.

Through his senses, he noticed that the young man’s bones were all pitched black. It looked horrifying.

However, there was a sweet scent of spiritual medicine emitted from his body too.

If it wasn’t for the vast amount of spiritual medicine in his body, he would have died long ago.

Maniac Ji told Wang Xian, “Although that Miracle Doctor did not cure Xiao Xiang’s illness, he reminded me of a way to keep his life — using the body as medicine to suppress the toxins. For every cycle, I would need various spiritual grasses and decoct them into soup to feed him. Otherwise, he would be beyond curing if the toxins toxin enters the body!”

If Wang Xian had not demonstrated the terrifying strength the previous day, Maniac Ji would not have bothered and wasted his time on a Miracle Doctor that ranked only 18th.

He wouldn’t have queued patiently and wasted his time explaining all this to him.

As the energy of the Azure Dragon flowed into the young man’s body, Wang Xian couldn’t help but frown slightly. As he was still too weak, the energy of the Azure Dragon couldn’t deal with the toxins in the body.

“These toxins are really vicious. The dosage of the toxins is horrifying too.”

As the energy from the Azure Dragon contacted the toxin, the energy was being neutralized at a terrifying speed. The toxin seemed to be alive and would attack the energy from the Azure Dragon frantically once they sensed it coming.

“This venom was released by a Half-step to Inborn expert just before he died. This venom that was released was sufficient to kill ten thousand people!”

As Maniac Ji spoke, he shook with wrath. There were signs of madness in his eyes.

Wang Xian looked at Maniac Ji. With how it looked now, Maniac Ji was no doubt experiencing madness in his mind

If his son had died, Maniac Ji would likely fall into deprivation and become a real demon.

“The situation is within control,” Wang Xian said as he sent Divine Dragon Energy into Xiao Xiang’s body this time.

Sss sss...

Wang Xian could hear burning sounds from the body of Xiao Xiang. He realized the concentrated toxins and the divine dragon energy were neutralizing each other.

Although Dragon Energy was considered to be among the highest-tier energies, the amount was limited. On the other hand, the toxin had been inside Xiao Xiang’s body for several years and was deeply rooted in his bones.

Nonetheless, neutralizing the toxins in his body was still possible with the Dragon Energy.

100, 200, 300...

The Dragon Energy was being exhausted quickly. The amount of toxins in Xiao Xiang’s body far exceeded Wang Xian’s expectations.

However, the expense of the dragon energy was nothing compared to what there was to gain.

“This...This...”

As he looked at the black toxin diminishing from his son’s body at a pace visible to the naked eye, Maniac Ji’s eyes lit up with excitement.

He crouched beside the bed, hugging his own head.

Wang Xian looked at Maniac Ji and thought to himself, Even a crazy person has a soft spot in his heart.

Wang Xian utilized both of his arms and emitted dense dragon energy from his body. At the same time, he was emitting the demeanor of a supreme Emperor.

Maniac Ji was in awe. Horror flashed in his eyes as he lifted his head and looked at Wang Xian.

This aura... This aura... It’s too strong...

Puff

“Alright, the toxins in your son’s body have been removed,”

Wang Xian exhaled as he spoke. He had used up more than 2,000 points of Dragon Energy to cure Maniac Ji’s son. This was a huge price to pay.

Argh, argh.

Just as they spoke, Xiao Xiang started to murmur.

With the help of the vast quantity of spiritual medicine in his body, his body was recovering at a rapid pace after the toxins had been purged.

In the future, if he started to cultivate, he could easily reach Martial Artist Level 8 or 9.

“Ji Xiang, my son, my dear son!” Maniac Ji exclaimed in excitement.

Wang Xian looked back at him while walking down the stairs. He wanted to give the father and son some personal time.

As Wang Xian returned to the first story, the other three patients had left. He poured himself a new cup of tea and started drinking in his chair.

The fragrance of the tea was what he liked.

Bang Bang Bang!

About ten minutes later, footsteps were heard from above.

“Ji Xiang, wait for me outside the medical hall. I will join you shortly.”

A fatherly love could be felt from Maniac Ji as he spoke. He was no longer in the state of madness.

“Yes, father,” Ji Xiang nodded as he walked out.

Maniac Ji walked to Wang Xian and bowed deeply. “Thank you, Miracle Doctor Wang. I will fulfill all your requests so long as you don’t send me to die. I would still like to accompany my son for some time,” he promised.

As Wang Xian rose from his seat, he smiled at Maniac Ji and said, “I need an astronomical amount of spiritual stones. I need a way for me to obtain them.”
