“Kill!”

A deafening sound reverberated throughout the deep sea spiritual spring.

“Dragon King, it’s the Dragon King’s Voice!”

“The Dragon King is here, the Dragon King Is Here!”

When Wang Xian’s voice rang out, some of the members of the Dragon Palace who did not see Wang Xian’s arrival shuddered. Soon after, their faces revealed an excited expression.

“Roar Roar, the Dragon King is here. Those who dare to offend our Dragon Palace and take over our treasured land will die!”

A demon monkey roared with excitement, and his face instantly revealed a violent expression.

“Are You Motherf * cking Dragon Palace Crazy?”

“Are you courting death? Hurry up and dig out the spirit stones. Motherf * cker, I think you don’t want to live anymore!”

“What Dragon King? Bullsh * t Dragon King!”

Around them, the humans of the Sky Island dynasty, the aquatic electric eel demon beasts, and the Harpoon Demon Beasts saw the roar that suddenly covered the entire area, and their faces slightly changed.

When they saw the excited expressions of the members of the Dragon Palace, their faces turned black, and they immediately cursed.

The Dragon Palace was the weakest among the four forces, and it was also an existence that was bullied by the other forces.

Now, they actually dared to shout arrogantly, and they immediately cursed.

“Kill!”

However, in the next moment, what made the Sky Island dynasty, the electric eel demon beasts, and the harpoon demon beasts terrified was that the members of the Dragon Palace put down the mining shovels in their hands and directly attacked the three forces.

Caught off guard, hundreds of humans and demon beasts were killed instantly.

“Die! Kill those bastards from the Dragon Palace!”

Some of the experts of the Sky Island dynasty roared angrily.

Boom

However, at this moment, a terrifying force covered the entire deep sea spiritual spring.

“What happened? Who Dares to Intrude Our Sky Island Dynasty’s territory? !”

When the terrifying force covered an area of ten kilometers, the location in the sky.

On the strange ship that was a thousand meters in size, three insightful emptiness realm experts flew out directly. Behind them, there were more than ten half-step insightful emptiness realm experts!

Boom

However, just as they came out, Wang Xian, who was floating in the sky, waved his arm.

A force of five elements annihilation swept towards them.

Under the watchful eyes of the five to six thousand people from the three major forces at the bottom of the sea, the experts who had just flown out died before they could even scream in pain under the terrifying energy.

“What? There are experts from the Dragon Palace? What is the Dragon Palace trying to do? They actually dare to make an enemy out of the three of us!” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“You are courting death. When the top experts from the Sky Island Empire arrive, everyone from the Dragon Palace will die. How dare you offend your superiors!”

Furious voices came from the surroundings.

Boom

“Offend your superiors?”

Wang Xian floated in the air and stared at everyone from the other three forces below.

His body trembled and rays of gray light shot downwards.

“Ahhhh!”

Below him, humans and demonic beasts were dying.

“What?”

When Wang Xian’s terrifying attack landed, all the humans and demonic beasts of the Tiandao dynasty, the electric eel tribe, and the Harpoon tribe were stunned.

“Dragon King, come back! Anyone who dares to offend us, kill them!”

Ao Qitian let out a loud roar. His body shook and he turned into a 15-meter-tall behemoth. In his ear, a huge ocean-pacifying needle appeared in his hand.

He waved the ocean-pacifying needle, and a huge amount of energy directly attacked the three powerful human demon beasts.

“Kill!”

The other members of the Dragon Palace also shouted excitedly.

The humiliation and anger that they had felt during this period of time were all vented out, and the attacks tore the enemies’bodies apart.

“Not good, run, run quickly!”

The human and Demon Beasts of the three forces saw their own experts being killed instantly, and the experts of the Dragon Palace massacred wantonly. All of them were terrified and fled in all directions.

However, ao Qitian would not let everyone off

With his monstrous demonic flames, he waved his ocean-pacifying divine needle. With a swing of his rod, even an expert at the second level of the Seethrough Void Tier would be afraid.

“Ba Qi, where are Prime Minister Gui and the Dragon Queen?”

Wang Xian was floating in the sky as he looked down and asked Ba Qi who was beside him.

“Reporting to the Dragon King, today is the day of the marriage between the Tiandao Kingdom and the one-leaf mainland dynasty. The Tiandao dynasty invited our Dragon Palace over and asked all of our experts to celebrate. Prime Minister Gui and the Dragon Queen have already gone over!”

Ba Qi said to Wang Xian.

“The day of the marriage, the day of the wedding!”

Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled. “You know the place, right? Let’s go over!”

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Ba Qi nodded. “The Sky Island dynasty is about 400 kilometers away from here and belongs to an island dynasty!”

“The king of this dynasty has the strength of a fourth-level void interpretation. The one-leaf mainland dynasty that has the marriage with him is even stronger. There is more than one fourth-level void interpretation expert among them!”

Ba Qi reminded Wang Xian lightly.

“Okay!”

Wang Xian nodded his head and looked down.

Under ao Qitian’s personal attack, only a second-level insightful void martial artist could fight against him. The rest, even if they were at the first-level insightful void martial artist, were no match for him.

In the entire deep sea spiritual spring, almost all the humans and demonic beasts from the three factions were killed!

“Ao Qitian, you guard this place. Ba Qi, let’s Go!”

As Wang Xian spoke, he flew directly toward the sky island dynasty under Ba Qi’s lead.

“Where are the aquatic electric eel and Harpoon Demonic Beasts?”

While flying in the ocean, Wang Xian asked Ba Qi with a twinkle in his eyes.

“Dragon King, the marriage between the Sky Island dynasty and the one leaf continent dynasty is very big this time. The aquatic electric eel and harpoon demonic beasts should be with the Sky Island dynasty as well!”

Ba Qi replied.

“Oh, is that so? That’s Great!”

Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled. Since they were all there, it would be easy to solve the problem.

If he could not give him a satisfactory answer, Wang Xian would not let him know what regret was.

What despair was.

Whoosh

After flying for hundreds of kilometers, Wang Xian, Zhang Fengying, and Ba Qi rushed out of the sea.

“Dragon King, in front of us is the Kingdom of the Sky Island. There are more than 30 million people on the island. The royal family of the Sky Island is the king here!”

An island appeared in their line of sight.

The island had an area of more than 100 kilometers. It was not very big, but it was not small either.

There were many trees on the island, but there were no ferocious beasts or demonic beasts on it. The cities on the island looked magnificent.

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered as he flew toward the center of the island.

Near the center of the island, festive flowers could be seen from afar.

In the sky, colorful seabirds were flying around, making the center of the island look very beautiful.

In a huge palace in the center of the island, there were at least tens of thousands of people gathered at a spacious spot in front of the hall.

Among them, the prime minister Guan Shuqing and they gathered in one place!
