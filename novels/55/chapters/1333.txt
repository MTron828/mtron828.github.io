Chapter 1334: 1335. The eighth Prince had to die

“I am Wang Xian, Long Xiaotian’s good friend!”

On the island of the Guanglong dynasty, Wang Xian heard long Tengyang’s words and cupped his hands in greeting as well.

The two of them faced each other from afar and greeted each other politely. This was a simple greeting from an expert.

“Haha, Good, good. It is really an honor for Xiaotian to be able to meet a young talent like brother Wang Xian!”

Long Tengyang laughed out loud as his eyes sparkled.

Just now, Wang Xian was able to kill Bing Hanzi, which left him deeply shocked.

He knew that it was impossible for him to kill Bing Hanzi with his strength.

If the other party wanted to escape, there was no way for him to stop him.

However, Wang Xian was able to kill Bing Hanzi with such ease. His strength was at the peak even among the fifth level of the Seethrough realm!

Following that, he continued loudly, “Brother Wang Xian, when you have the opportunity to come to our Guanglong Empire in the future, we will continue to hold the ceremony!”

Wang Xian nodded his head faintly.

He smiled and gestured to the white-haired elder beside him.

When everyone saw the equal exchange between Wang Xian and the king of the Guanglong Empire, they sighed in their hearts.

The white-haired old man nodded slowly and looked in the direction of Wang Xian.

“Cough cough, the ceremony will continue!”

The white-haired old man coughed lightly and looked at Wang Xian.

“The sacrificial ceremony has ended. The selection of the crown prince will be evaluated based on the strength, influence, and battle results of all the Princes!”

“Now, the decision will be made by our judging panel!”

As he spoke, he pondered for a moment before looking at the second Prince and the eighth prince.

All the princes in the surroundings also landed on the two of them.

“It should be the eighth Prince!”

“There’s no mistake about the eighth prince. Even if he doesn’t have frigidsect, with the eighth Prince’s strength, he will definitely inherit the position of the Crown Prince!”

“Although the second prince is the brother of Wang Xian, a top-notch powerhouse, it’s still impossible for him to interfere with the position of the Crown Prince of the Light Dragon Empire!”

Everyone’s gaze fell on the eighth prince once again.

Although everything that happened today had shocked everyone, the selection of the prince still had to continue.

The eighth Prince, Long Xiaoyun, was undoubtedly at level three of the Seethrough realm.

“The eighth Prince, Long Xiaoyun, has inherited the position of the crown prince. He has the right to inherit the throne as the first in line!”

“The second prince, Long Xiaotian, has the right to inherit the throne as the second in line. Furthermore, he has conferred the title of the Second Prince as the Royal Highness of Dragon Immortal!”

The white-haired old man’s voice rang out. As expected, the eighth Prince had inherited the position of the crown prince.

On the other hand, the Guanglong royal family had conferred the title of the Royal Highness of Dragon Immortal on the account of Wang Xian. This was the first time in the history of the Guanglong dynasty.

“Long Xiaoyun accepts the order!”

The second prince, Long Xiaoyun, did not look too good. He walked out slowly, bowed and replied loudly.

“Phew!”

Long Xiaotian, who was at the side, let out a sigh and walked forward as well. “Long Xiaotian accepts the title!”

“Crown prince token, the eighth Prince receives it!”

A smile appeared on the white-haired Elder’s face.

The eighth Prince had obtained a fortuitous encounter in the Origin Light Dragon Pool. His strength was incomparably powerful, and his future was boundless. He could even lead the light dragon dynasty to take a step forward.

The second Prince befriended a top-notch expert at the fifth level of the profound void tier, and it was also very beneficial to the light dragon dynasty!

The crown prince token emitted a dazzling white light as it flew towards the eighth prince.

At this moment, a faint smile finally appeared on Long Xiaoyun’s face.

Although his subordinates had died, he still had the entire Radiant Dragon Empire.

He extended his hand and took the token of the crown prince.

Wang Xian looked at the token of the crown prince as well as the eighth prince. A smile appeared on his face.

He extended his arm slowly!

Whoosh

Just as the token of the crown prince was about to fall into the eighth Prince’s hand.

The token flew towards Wang Xian instantly under a powerful force.

Snap

In an instant, the token was in his hand. He looked at the stunned Long Xiaoyun with a smile on his face.

“What?”

“Wang Xian is going to do it!”

Everyone changed their expressions slightly. Looking at Wang Xian who was holding the crown prince’s token, their eyes sparkled.

All the important ministers, generals, the white-haired elder, and the king, Long Tengyang, stood up instantly. They stared at Wang Xian with an unsightly expression.

“You... you...”

Long Xiaoyun widened his eyes and stared at Wang Xian with an unsightly expression.

“Brother Wang Xian, what are you trying to do?”

Long Tengyang stared at Wang Xian with a serious expression and asked with an unsightly expression.

“King Long Tengyang, I might have to offend you next!”

Wang Xian stood there and squinted his eyes slightly as he said faintly.

“Brother Wang Xian!”

Long Xiaotian was shocked when he heard Wang Xian’s words. He quickly shouted.

Wang Xian looked at him and said indifferently, “This matter has nothing to do with Brother Long Xiaotian!”

As he spoke, his gaze swept across Long Xiaoyun and all the people from the Frost sect behind him. Killing intent slowly appeared in his eyes!

“Next, Long Xiaoyun must die and the Frost sect must be destroyed!”

Wang Xian stood there and uttered a few shocking words.

“What?”

“D * mn, Wang Xian is going to do it!”

“He... he...”

As soon as he finished speaking, all the forces and families in the Guang Long Empire stood up and stared at Wang Xian in shock.

The people who came to watch the ceremony were also dumbfounded.

What was Wang Xian going to do?

Was he going to make an enemy out of the Guang Long Empire?

Wasn’t He Long Xiaotian’s brother?

Why?

“Wang Xian, you... how dare you! How dare you!”

Under Wang Xian’s gaze, Long Xiaoyun couldn’t help but take two steps back. His face was filled with fear.

“How dare you?”

A hint of contempt appeared on Wang Xian’s face. “Long Xiaoyun? You ordered the sect master of the Frost Sect, Ling Binghanzi, to kill me just now. Do you really think that I’m afraid of the Frost Sect?”

“Or do you really think that I won’t dare to kill you just because of the Light Dragon Dynasty?”

“Cold sect, I want to destroy you. I want to kill you. Today, even the Light Dragon Dynasty Can’t Save You!”

Boom

After Wang Xian finished his words, a terrifying killing intent swept towards Long Xiaoyun and everyone from the cold sect.

The killing intent was locked onto them!

Everyone in the surroundings was filled with astonishment!

In the territory of the Guanglong dynasty, he wanted to kill the newly appointed crown prince..

This was too arrogant! Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Boom

On the stage, the king of the Guanglong dynasty, Long Tengyang, instantly emitted a terrifying aura.

“Brother Wang Xian, are you making an enemy out of the Guanglong Dynasty?”

Long Tengyang stared at Wang Xian with an ugly expression.

“Haha, King Long Tengyang, your son, Long Xiaoyun, wants to kill me. Do you think that I’m someone that others want to kill?”

“Since you can’t kill me, then just wait for your death!”

Wang Xian laughed out loud and stared at Long Teng Yang. “Let me say it here today. Whoever dares to stop me will be my enemy!”

“If your light dragon dynasty wants to make a move, then today, I will make your light dragon dynasty...”

“Rivers of blood!”
