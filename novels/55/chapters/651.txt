Chapter 652: Another Two Immortals

“Anomaly of Mt. Taibai!”

The yacht was moving in the direction of the Dragon Palace at a fast speed.

Wang Xian was sitting in his chair, reading the information in his hand while Lan Qingyue and the rest of the girls crowded together with curiosity.

The anomaly of Mt. Taibai started five days ago. A sudden surge of Spiritual Energy in the air rushed to the mountain range like flowing water, causing a drastic change to places within a radius of less than twenty kilometers.

With the sweeping of the Spiritual Energy, all the ordinary beasts grew larger by three to four meters, turning them into powerful creatures.

Under the wash of the Spiritual Energy, Martial Artists greatly enhanced their cultivation. Within five days, dozens of Inborn Experts emerged.

Where did this Spiritual Energy come from? No one knew about it!

All the Martial Artists of the Underworld gathered at this place.

“It streams down from mid-air. Hence, it must come from the Nine Cauldron Worlds. I wonder what happened.”

“But what makes it even weirder was that the Spiritual Energy did not dissipate in the air but streamed into the mountain!”

Wang Xian was full of curiosity as he read the data. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“With such an immense amount of Spiritual Energy entering the mountain, wouldn’t that form a Spiritual Ore Mine?” asked Adjaya with slight surprise.

“Totally possible. I guess Mt. Taibai has become an immortal mountain now!” Wang Xian’s eyes were gleaming. “This is a great chance. Let’s return to China in a few days’ time!”

“Mm, it’s time to go back too!”

The girls nodded.

Back on Mt. Taibai, thick and dense Spiritual Energy poured down to the mountain range from mid-air just like a waterfall.

Martial Artists were sitting with their legs crossed at the foot of it, absorbing all the Spiritual Energy with excitement.

An area not far from them was divided into two different worlds by a compelling force.

On the other side of the world, five significant obscure figures were standing in the air, staring at the colossal cauldron above them.

The cauldron was enormous, containing an incomparably insane level of energy.

The energy was imposing and vast, just like the sea.

At the same time, the Spiritual Energy from Heaven and Earth was flowing out of the hundred-meter cauldron!

“Those long divided shall be united; those long united shall be divided: such is the way of the universe. The Nine Cauldrons are returning to Earth. What a surprise. The current real world was no longer our world, and the Nine Cauldrons are returning to their homes!”

A great figure murmured with a voice that sounded like a large bell, sending his voice across the sky.

“The Nine Cauldrons were refined by nine dragon veins with their great might. Now that they are returning to where they belong, there will be nine Immortal areas emerging in this world. Our array in the world is weakened. Hence, those Inborn and beyond will not have any danger to their lives if they get out now. At most, severe injuries!”

“Send some disciples out and began their cultivation at this immortal mountain range. When our world descends into the real world, we will divide the mountains again.”

“Two more months before our Xia Cauldron world descends into the real world. At that time, how are we going to face it?”

“The world has changed and divided with different kings ruling it. Since we are entering the real world, we can only influence the world, but not change it. If we can’t change it, we have to adapt to it. The most important thing is our resources!”

The figures took turns speaking. As the five Pinnacles of the Xia Cauldron, their words sealed the fate of millions of people.

“Greetings to the Dragon King!”

Back in the Dragon Palace, all the Dragon Palace members knelt in the Dragon King Hall, greeting Wang Xian with respect.

“I called you guys here to make an announcement. Today, there will be a sparring competition in the Dragon Palace. Apart from Prime Minister Turtle, I’ll enhance the strength of the strongest person over here to the next level!

“Apart from that, the remaining Devil Division, Dragon Guard Division, Dragon Assassinating Division, and Anomalocaris race will be divided into smaller teams based on the strength of the experts. We’ll be doing training, formation changing, and choosing the team captains. From now on, every Head of Division and the team captains will gain extra cultivation resources,” said Wang Xian to them slowly.

Establishing a set of complete rules was suggested by Prime Minister Turtle.

He had devised detailed rules for every division’s training and development.

Amongst them, the selection of the leaders was the top priority.

The rules established by Prime Minister Turtle was a combination of ancient and modern systems, forming a set of a complete system.

This could better stimulate and enhance the strength of the Dragon Palace members.

The main reason accounting for the army becoming powerful was discipline.

According to Prime Minister Turtle’s idea, not only must the members be restricted with military rules, but they must also cultivate themselves under a high degree of pressure.

Dragon Field was not a decoration. They must make use of it to spar and test their battle techniques.

In addition, there would be a promotion system based on strength. The stronger ones would get access to more resources.

Competitions would be held regularly in Dragon Palace. That was only one part of it. After Prime Minister Turtle groomed a team of wise and intelligent civil officials, all the Dragon Palace members could learn from them!

“Yes, Dragon King!”

The group of Dragon Palace members answered in sync.

At present, the members of the Dragon Palace might have had high intelligence. Still, they did not possess the mindsets of humans in society.

Commands and orders were the only things they understood.

This could be good and bad. But when their strength hit a certain level, they would think further.

This train of thought was a good thing, as this represented the birth of a true civilization.

“Fall in at the Dragon Field!”

With a swift movement, Wang Xian arrived at the Dragon Field.

Standing in front of the members, he said, “Among the leaders of Level 12, I’ll enhance the strongest one to the next level. If you think you’re the strongest, step forward for the challenge!”

“Roar, Dragon King. Let me do it!”

The first to step forward was Roving Heavens. He was seven meters tall with a body of dark fur. Under the fur was layers of scales. His burly muscles were even bulging out.

He was carrying a huge, seven-meter metallic rod on his shoulder.

“Who will challenge me, Roving Heavens!”

Roving Heavens let out a loud bellow as he placed his rod down, staring at Roving Yaksha and Nine Venomous Snakes with burning fighting spirit in his eyes.

Wang Xian looked at Roving Heavens with a smile on his face.

Wang Xian did not consider the strength of Roving Heavens to be the strongest. However, his insane combat capability and desire were above all the other members.

“Me!”

Roving Yaksha, looking on impassively, pointed at Roving Heavens with the fork in his hand.

“We fight! Roar!”

The first competition in the Dragon Palace had officially begun. Violent devilish aura surged from Roving Heavens.

The furious aura caused some of the weaker members to stagger back immediately.

“The Devil Monkey is violent. The more violent it gets, the more terrifying it becomes. Apart from Roving Sword, Roving Heavens should be ranked number one within the Dragon Palace.”

At this time, Prime Minister Turtle’s voice surprised Wang Xian.

“Hur? Roving Heavens is the strongest? Roving Yaksha, Roving Demon, and Nine Venomous Snakes should not be weaker than Roving Heavens, right?” asked Wang Xian with surprise.

“Dragon King, even I could not withstand the violent attacks from Roving Heavens when it comes to a life-and-death match. Dragon King, watch, and you’ll find out!”
