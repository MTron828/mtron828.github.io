Chapter 1554: With the evolution of the 1554 Dragon Pearl, he had gained a huge harvest

“Let’s continue!”

Wang Xian, who was thousands of kilometers away, sensed that Ling Jian ‘er was completely safe. He opened his eyes and looked ahead.

His body moved and flew into the sky. He scanned his surroundings.

“There, there are spiritual herbs of the fourth level of the Void!”

His body moved and flew over directly.

“Eh!”

Just as he arrived, he suddenly noticed more than ten figures flying over.

“There are a total of eight spirit grass of the fourth level of the void interpretation. Ten Darkness Souls of the third level of the void interpretation can deal with them!”

“Eh? There’s another person?”

A group of people flew over. They were wearing black and white clothes.

If they weren’t wearing black robes, it meant that they were at least from a first-rate force.

Based on their black and white attire, the two big words “I am the only one”could be used to determine the other party’s identity.

Solipsistic sect!

“One person?”

A dozen middle-aged men from solipsistic sect glanced at Wang Xian and sized up their surroundings warily.

The old man standing in the middle gestured to the two middle-aged men. The two of them nodded and flew directly towards Wang Xian.

Wang Xian stood there and watched the two middle-aged men flying over quietly. The corners of his mouth curled up slightly.

“Kid, why aren’t you running?”

Seeing Wang Xian standing there motionlessly, the two middle-aged men stood in front of him and behind him. A hint of surprise flashed across their eyes.

“Why are you running?”

Wang Xian looked at the two middle-aged men and asked faintly.

“That’s true. You Can’t run away even if you want to when you meet our lone sect. Haha!”

A middle-aged man laughed out loud.

“Alright, let’s get rid of this kid. Who knows, he might have some spiritual herbs in his interspatial ring!”

The old man in the middle said plainly to the two middle-aged men.

“Yes, senior brother!”

The two middle-aged men retracted their expressions and stared at Wang Xian arrogantly.

“I’ll send you on your way!”

A middle-aged man moved and slashed the scimitar in his hand at Wang Xian instantly.

“Ants!”

Contempt appeared in Wang Xian’s eyes. With a wave of his arm, a demonic dragon directly attacked the two middle-aged men.

Buzz

In an instant, the demonic dragon swept past them. Before the two of them could even scream, they died instantly.

Following that, the demonic dragon swept towards the rest of the people from the lone sect.

“Not good, that fellow is very strong! Set up a formation!”

The old man in the center saw that his two junior brothers had died instantly, and his face revealed a trace of shock. He hurriedly shouted.

“Roar!”

However, at this moment, the Demon Dragon lightly roared, and a violent and violent roar charged towards them.

“This... how...”

Everyone’s eyes widened, and their faces revealed an expression of disbelief.

Streams of blood flowed out from their ears, nose, mouth, and eyes.

How was this possible? How could a third level void interpretation expert be so strong?

Their eyes were filled with disbelief as their vitality slowly dissipated.

“Roar! Roar!”

The demonic dragon swayed its huge body and headed straight for the Soul of darkness.

“Just a little more. The level of the dark dragon bead is about to increase!”

Feeling the terrifying pressure from the demonic dragon, Wang Xian revealed a smile on his face.

He kept everyone’s interspatial rings and left without looking.

The more he flew towards the exit, the more people he encountered. Wang Xian even encountered demonic beasts from the natural moat.

When these humans and demonic beasts saw Wang Xian alone, they attacked without hesitation. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

The result was obvious!

“The last ten!”

Two days later, beside a small lake, Wang Xian looked at the black lotus in the Black Lake and the ten darkness souls in the lake. His eyes were sparkling.

“Roar Roar!”

He waved his arm and the demonic dragon directly devoured the Darkness Souls.

The ten darkness souls were completely unable to resist and were directly devoured by the Dark Dragon Bead.

After swallowing the Ten Darkness Souls, the demonic aura on the demon Dragon’s body surged.

“Boom! Boom!”

A muffled sound was heard. The hundred-meter-long demon dragon slowly shrank and turned into a primitive black dragon pearl.

The Black Dragon Pearl, which was like a black hole, slowly floated in the sky.

“Roar!”

At this moment, an extremely violent roar of the demon dragon came from the Black Dragon Pearl, and the sound reverberated throughout the entire black screen garden.

Crack! Crack! Crack

Following that, the fist-sized dragon bead expanded in an instant. It was like a world-destroying demonic dragon that had emerged from a black hole.

The body of the demonic dragon gradually expanded. In the end, it stopped at about 150 meters!

Roar

Another earth-shattering roar was heard.

Wang Xian waved his arm and the demonic dragon flew towards him. It shrank slowly and circled around him!

“It has evolved!”

A smile appeared on Wang Xian’s face. Not long ago, he was still worrying about how to evolve the Dragon Pearl. In the end, it had only been a few days and it had already evolved.

“When the Light Dragon Pearl evolves, it will be the time for darkness to merge!”

Wang Xian thought to himself.

“What is that sound? Is it the roar of the Soul of Darkness?”

“My God, this violent Roar is definitely the roar of the Soul of darkness at level seven or even level eight of the Seethrough realm. Didn’t they say that there are no such powerful souls of darkness in the Black Screen Garden?”

“Hiss? who provoked such a terrifying existence? Let’s not go in that direction!”

At the same time, the roar of the evolution of the black dragon pearl caused everyone in the black curtain garden to look over in fear.

Everyone’s faces were filled with fear as they located the forbidden area in this direction!

“Now that my dragon Pearl has entered my body, I can completely fight against a level 8 soul of Darkness!”

“I have already swept through most of the black curtain garden. Let’s go to Jian ‘er!”

Wang Xian held the Dark Dragon Pearl and flew over quickly as he sensed the location of the light dragon pearl.

“There are so many people ahead!”

When Wang Xian flew over and arrived at the location of the Light Dragon Pearl, he waved his arm and the light dragon pearl attached to the statue flew directly into his hand.

After putting the statue away, he looked at a spot a kilometer ahead.

A kilometer ahead, there was a deep valley with a depth of two hundred meters.

The entire area of the deep valley was about five kilometers in radius. At this moment, there were more than a thousand people gathered on both sides of the deep valley.

There were three first-rate forces, and Ling Jian ‘er and the rest were beside the deep valley.

At this moment, more than a thousand people were staring at the deep valley with burning faces. Everyone was getting restless.

Wang Xian swept his gaze over and looked at the deep valley. A hint of surprise appeared on his face.

“There are so many spiritual herbs and spiritual fruits. There are at least three to four hundred of them. Furthermore, there are three spiritual herbs of the eighth level of the void interpretation in the middle. This is really strange!”

Wang Xian revealed a hint of surprise on his face.

Most of the spiritual herbs in the deep valley were of the first and second level of the void interpretation. However, there were three spiritual herbs of the eighth level of the void interpretation in the middle of the valley.

The spiritual herbs were emitting a golden light and were shaped like swords.

This was the eighth rank of the profound void tier sword heart grass!

This spiritual herb was a rare treasure for metal elemental profound void tier experts.

Everyone around them was looking at the sword heart grass in the center of the valley with a burning gaze. Their breathing was a little hurried.

Meeting a spiritual herb of the eighth rank of the profound void tier at this place was a huge opportunity for all of them.

Especially since the strongest dark soul in the deep valley was only at rank 3 void interpretation.

Moreover, there were only a hundred of them!
