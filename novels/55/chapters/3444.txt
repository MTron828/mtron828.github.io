“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

The Water Dragon and the Green Dragon Roared.

The leader of the Dragon Palace’s Water Dragon, Green Dragon Moon, and the rest roared and attacked the four of them directly.

The five elements millstone and the ninth-grade water lotus also released a terrifying power in an instant.

Wang Xian stood at the back and licked his lips. He flapped his incipient saint wings and disappeared instantly.

“Eh? Be careful!”

When the four of them saw Wang Xian disappear and sensed the position of the five elements millstone, they were shocked.

The four of them surrounded each other and quickly put up a strong defense.

“Attack!”

Wang Xian shouted loudly. His arm turned into a dragon claw and gray energy charged straight at them.

“Boom!”

“Boom!”

“Boom!”

The Green Dragon Moon, the Heaven Formation, the Water Dragon Leader and the five elements water grinding lotus exploded with energy and charged at them.

Looking at the incoming attack, the expressions of the four of them changed slightly again.

“Not good. Their attacks are extremely terrifying. Block them with all your might!”

The figure holding the staff roared with a face full of shock and anger.

Four against four. In their eyes, there was no danger at all.

Even if that fellow who had appeared had killed cave master shui, in their eyes, there were two other experts who had launched a sneak attack.

However, when they sensed this terrifying attack, they knew that it was not.

Regardless of whether it was the strange array master’s attack or the attack that was filled with the deathly silent energy disc, they all felt incomparably terrifying.

They would definitely not be able to resist this attack one on one.

“Go All Out!”

One of the figures wearing a light mask also roared crazily. One of his arms enlarged and blocked the area in front of him.

The hearts of the other three people pounded violently. They took out their strongest connate numinous treasure and acquired Supreme Treasure to block the attack.

“Brother Wang Xian is so strong. Is this his subordinate? He is also extremely powerful!”

Green Dragon Moon felt the attacks around him and his face was filled with joy.

Boom

A terrifying collision was heard. The energy in the entire sky was sent out in all directions.

“Eh? What? There seems to be a change in the battle in the sky. There are still experts on Green Dragon Moon’s side!”

“Green Dragon Moon has helpers. It seems that their ancestral dragon lineage has made preparations!”

“That’s great. There are still experts on our side. That’s Great!”

Shocked and exclamations came from below. They looked at the terrifying collision in the sky, and they were all extremely shaken.

This terrifying energy fluctuation made even the cave masters’Hearts palpitate.

“That new cave master is so powerful. Did Water Mage Cave master get killed, or did he escape?”

Several cave masters raised their heads to look. They couldn’t see clearly due to the distance.

However, they could feel that there were at least eight universe masters with first-level battle power in the sky.

“DAMN!”

An old man in front of a cave abode looked up at the sky, his eyebrows twitching.

His body trembled, and an identical figure separated from his body and disappeared in an instant.

Pu! Pu! Pu! Pu

At the same time, at the same place in the sky, four figures wearing light masks spat out blood. Their faces were filled with shock.

They had been severely injured by that terrifying attack!

Their opponents’attacks were extremely terrifying.

They felt as if they were not facing four universe ruler level one great beings, but ten, or even more.

“Undefeatable! The enemy’s array masters have already sealed off our space!”

The four of them looked at each other, and the figure holding the staff said with an unsightly expression.

“Break this sealing formation for us!”

One of the burly figures let out a low growl. His voice traveled far and wide.

“Huh?”

Wang Xian heard the growl and narrowed his eyes slightly.

“Kill!”

His figure flashed and instantly arrived at the side of the powerhouse holding the staff. He clawed out with his dragon claws.

“What speed. No Wonder Cave Master Shui was killed. His speed is comparable to a powerhouse with the combat strength of a level two universe dominator.”

The figure holding the staff had a drastic change in expression. He raised his innate spiritual treasure-level staff to block the attack.

Boom

A terrifying collision occurred once again. The figure holding the staff flew backward and spat out a large amount of blood again.

Wang Xian’s figure flashed and appeared on the other side of him in an instant.

“Save him!”

The other three people shouted immediately.

Streams of energy covered the surroundings of the expert holding the staff.

“Kill!”

Tian Cheng let out a low roar and waved his hand. One formation after another was instantly formed and attacked them.

The Azure Dragon Moon and the water dragon leader swayed their huge bodies as their dragon tails swept out.

The dragon tails formed from the condensed attributes blocked the heaven and earth.

“This won’t do. We’re not their match at all. Defend, Defend Again!”

The burly figure roared furiously.

“Quickly break through the array’s defenses, quickly!”

He continued to roar sternly, his eyes filled with anxiety and fear.

They were no match for them. They were completely no match for them.

If this dragged on any longer, they would be killed!

The four of them directly gathered back to back, propping up their defenses.

“Boom Boom!”

Another wave of attacks landed on their bodies.

The arms of the two men who raised their arms instantly disintegrated and dissipated.

“Continue to kill. I think there are more accomplices!”

Wang Xian let out a low roar and continued to attack.

“Boom!”

However, at this moment, a rumbling sound came from the rear.

“Dragon King, there are experts at level one of the Masters of the universe breaking the formation outside!”

The Heaven Formation swept over immediately and shouted in a deep voice.

“Hold them off!”

“Let’s make our move as soon as possible!”

Wang Xian shouted loudly and glanced at Azure Dragon Moon.

“Die!” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Azure Dragon Moon’s eyes were filled with rage.

To kill him this time, he actually sent out so many masters of level one of the universe.

If not for Wang Xian, he would definitely die today.

“Not good, Dragon King. The formation has been broken. The other party has an innate spiritual treasure.”

At this moment, the voice of the Heaven Formation was heard.

“Continue to kill them. Even if they are broken, they will not be able to escape!”

Lightning exploded on the uninitiated holy wings on Wang Xian’s back. They turned into lightning needles and attacked the four of them directly.

“Wings of the King of Angels, run!”

“Just you wait. Your ancestral dragon will be destroyed!”

At this moment, a bright wing suddenly rose in the middle of the four of them.

The light wing completely enveloped them.

Wang Xian’s lightning attack landed on the light wing and was immediately blocked.

The spear of obliteration from the five elements grinding landed on the light wing but was still unable to shake it.

“The defense of the Angel Race!”

When Green Dragon Moon saw the light wing that was used for defense, her expression was unusually ugly.

The fact that the other party had such a powerful light attribute life-saving treasure was enough to represent that even if the angel race did not participate in the fight, they were indirectly involved.

After all, this kind of defensive life-saving treasure was not so easy to obtain!

Under the cover of the Angel King’s wings, the four figures slowly disappeared.

They fled back to their own divine kingdom.

“Angel Race!”

Azure Dragon Moon looked at the body of the light wings and trembled, his expression extremely ugly.
