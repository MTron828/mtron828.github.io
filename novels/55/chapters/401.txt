Chapter 402: Annihilating the Century Ghost

“Huh? You dare to attack us? Haha! Kill these recklessly ignorant fools first!”

When the dozen-odd members of the Century Ghost Group saw Wang Xian, Xiao Yu and the group charging and attacking them, their expressions turned as cold as ice.

The Century Ghost member in the center charged towards Xiao Yu with a dagger that glowed in a creepy green light.

His savage-looking mask glowed dazzlingly. Noticing the speed at which Xiao Yu charged towards him, he was shocked. “Little brat, you are pretty fast. However, let me show you the way of assassination!”

As that Century Ghost member moved his arm, the green dagger left afterimages.

Seeing how arrogant and brazen this guy was, Xiao Yu was filled with contempt.

She slashed down with the bone sword in her hands.

“How fast!”

That Century Ghost member was taken by surprise and immediately blocked it with the phantom-like dagger.

Ka ka!

However, as the bone sword swung over, his dagger was easily sliced into two. At the same time, the long bone sword slashed down at the body of the Century Ghost member.

Pa Pa!

That Century Ghost member stopped. The glow of his mask dissipated gradually, split in the middle and eventually fell to the ground.

His eyes were filled with disbelief! FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

A stream of blood flowed down from his head.

He had been split in half from top to bottom.

Xiao Yu was taken aback and clearly made uncomfortable by the scene.

“Die!”

At this instant, the other Century Ghost member to the left moved beside Xiao Yu like a specter. He had long claws which emanated a chilling green glow, and he swung them towards Xiao Yu.

Xiao Yu was shocked and immediately stretched her left hand forward. A black bone spike extended out from her arm immediately.

The bone spike was three to four meters long. To the astonishment of that Century Ghost member, the bone spike pierced through his chest.

Seeing Xiao Yu easily kill two Century Ghost members in the blink of an eye, Wang Xian couldn’t help but feel his mouth twitching.

The attacks of a Skeletal Dragon were exceptionally brutal.

Considering the toughness of Xiao Yu’s bones, these bones could match the toughness of Level 11 defensive equipment.

At this point, even Inborn Spiritual Weapon couldn’t put a dent in Xiao Yu’s impenetrable physique.

“Kill!”

Wang Xian threw his arm forward and streams of water shot towards the five water spirits before him.

Bam! Bam!

The five water spirits didn’t put up the slightest resistance as they were instantly killed and their bodies slashed into two at the waist.

“I’ll get those four Inborn realm Century Ghost members. As for the rest, I’m leaving them to all of you!”

Wang Xian looked to Xiao Yu and the group as he spoke. Moving off, he headed over and attacked in the direction where the four Century Ghost members were surrounding the Inborn experts from Qing Bi Sect.

The expert from Qing Bi Sect was covered in wounds. Moreover, there was a layer of poison on these wounds, causing sizzling sounds.

That Inborn expert’s eyes were bloodshot. He had totally disregarded his life while battling with the four Century Ghost members.

If the four Century Ghost members hadn’t been thinking of avoiding injuries, the Inborn expert from Qing Bi Sect would have long since been finished off.

“A pile of trash and yet you guys dare to encroach on our sea territory and kill the innocent. How presumptuous!”

The four Century Ghost members who were attacking the expert from Qing Bi Sect suddenly heard a voice coming from behind them. They raised an eyebrow and looked at Wang Xian.

“There’s another Inborn expert. This is troublesome. Kill him!”

The four Century Ghost members were flushed with bloodlust. Two of them charged forward immediately.

A samurai sword slashed upwards while a razor-sharp claw swung down at the same time.

“Be careful. Their weapons are covered in poison!”

When the expert saw Wang Xian charging forward, he immediately reminded him of this loudly.

“Two piles of trash! I can kill them as I wish!”

Wang Xian looked at the duo charging towards him with contempt. Picking up the scent of blood from them, his eyes turned chillingly cold.

The scent of blood on the duo was even thicker than that on Mo Qinglong and Mo Yuan.

One had to note that Mo Yuan and Mo Qinglong had each killed four to five hundred people when they annihilated the Dark Conjurers.

However, the two Century Ghost members had taken even more lives.

“Scumbag, I’m going to cut you up!” The Century Ghost member, who was carrying a samurai sword with both hands, slashed upwards.

“Ant!”

Wang Xian swung his hand and countless razor-sharp arrows shrouded towards the duo.

Rumble!

Thousands and thousands of water arrows shot out in unison towards the two Century Ghost members. However, the arrows were stopped by their weapons and eventually landed on the floor.

The two Century Ghost members’ expressions sank.

“This guy is a little hard to deal with!” a Century Ghost member commented as he looked alertly at Wang Xian.

Boom! Boom!

Suddenly, the two of them sank rapidly into the sea.

The seawater was just like a meat grinder and started circulating violently.

Argh!

Screams of desperation reverberated. The seawater was dyed red and soon the commotion died down.

“What?”

The other two Century Ghost members were shocked to see Hai Zuotou and Ni Zhu being slain instantly.

“The sea region isn’t a place where trash like you guys can do as you wish in the future!”

Ruthlessness gleamed in the eyes of Wang Xian. As he moved, he appeared before the two Century Ghost members who’d had the Inborn expert from Qing Bi Sect cornered previously.

Argh!

Suddenly, pitiful cries reverberated from the yacht.

When the two Century Ghost members turned around, they saw their underlings being killed off one after another. Bitterness and sadness shrouded their eyes.

“Run!” The two exchanged glances and remarked coldly.

They didn’t show any hesitation at all. One of them sprinted away while the other jumped directly into the sea.

“Wanna run?”

Wang Xian’s figure shimmered and appeared before the two Century Ghost members instantly.

“How quick!”

That Century Ghost member’s eyes shrank. He quickly threw a punch and scattered a green poisonous substance towards Wang Xian.

Roar!

At this instant, a roar erupted from the bottom of the sea. A huge snake emerged, swallowed the Century ghost member, and dived back into the sea.

“Wu Wu is dead!”

The last Century Ghost member called Shui Gui was petrified to sense that the presence of Wu Wu had dissipated completely.

“Shit! Shit! If you let us, the Century Ghost Group, know about your identity, we will definitely let you experience the torture treatment from us!”

Shui Gui dived towards the bottom of the sea frantically.

“What?”

At this moment, he suddenly saw the young man who had attacked him previously before his eyes.

His pupils shrank and fear welled up.

Blop! Blop!

All of a sudden, Shui Gui could sense the surrounding seawater crashing towards him. He held his neck in horror as he attempted to break away from the vice-like grip of the seawater over his neck

“How can this be? I’m Shui Gui. How can his speed in water be...” [1]

“You are just an insignificant spirit!”

Wang Xian took a glance at Shui Gui before making his way back to the surface of the water.

“Thank you. Thank you, brother, for saving my life!”

The moment Wang Xian emerged from the sea, the Inborn expert from Qing Bi Sect hurried over and thanked him sincerely.

“You are welcome. These guys are too arrogant. Since they were in my way, I just had to clear them!”

Wang Xian nodded his head plainly and looked towards the yacht.

At this instant, the commotion on the yacht died down. All the members of the Century Ghost Group had been killed.

“I’d like to express my gratitude on behalf of Qing Bi Sect for helping us out!”

The old man looked at Wang Xian, bowed down and clasped his right fist with his left palm as he spoke. He appeared to have something to add but stopped short of it.

“Young brother, are you Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown?”

[1] Shui Gui could also mean “Water Spirit.”
