Chapter 134: Craziness Before Destruction (2)

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

7.30 pm. The tables set up at the Yan Family’s Mountain Villa training field was filled with Martial Artists.

Martial Artists from Rivertown sat in two rows according to their strength.

Those who were at the forefront were all top-ranking families.

However, there were eight seats placed horizontally across the middle.

These seats were for the Yan Family.

The Yan Family was very particular about the setting of this banquet and was being extremely arrogant.

Two straight vertical rows for the various Martial Artists of Rivertown and a horizontal row at the front for the Yan Family.

This setting was an emulation of the local authority in ancient times.

The King would be seated in the middle.

And his officials would sit in two rows in front of him.

Everyone could tell that the Yan Family was seeing the other families in Rivertown as their “officials,” while they were the King.

There was still half an hour until the start of the banquet. Seeing that everyone had arrived, the Yan Family felt satisfied.

At approximately 7:35 pm, members of the Yan Family started walking in from the entrance to the banquet one after another.

The six of them instantly attracted the attention of everyone.

In the middle of the group, an old man held a walking stick with a dragon head at the top. He had a head of grey hair but the looks of a child. One would easily mistake him for a middle-aged man of 40-50 years old. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

To the side of this old man was an extremely good-looking juvenile wearing white.

The juvenile had pearl white teeth and thin, red lips which made him look extremely beautiful.

Beside the two of them were two old men. They had burly statures and looked across the surroundings as though they were far superior to the rest.

Further to each side were two middle-aged men.

“The old man in the middle must be the leader of the Yan Family, Yan Gukong. He reached Martial Artist Level 9 20 years ago. I wonder if he has taken that final step!”

“The oldest generation of the Yan Family included Yan Gukong, Yan Gufeng and Yan Gulie. Among them, Yan Gukong is the strongest!”

“Those two middle-aged men are Yan Zhongyuan and Yan Zhongwen. Both of them are Level 8 Martial Artists. Together with their Martial Artist Level 8 butler, they still have three other Level 8 Martial Artists who aren’t here today!”

“They are too strong! Really too strong! Even if Yan Gukong hasn’t made the breakthrough, the strength that the Yan Family has displayed is enough to overwhelm everyone here today!”

The Martial Artist Families and Martial Artists, who were seated at the side, looked at the six people in shock as they walked towards the seats at the forefront.

When the six of them reached their seats, they turned around and looked down on the surrounding crowd.

Yan Gukong was holding on to a dragon-head walking stick and shouted, “Twenty years ago, our Yan Family announced our retirement and stayed away from the matters of the underworld. On this very day, twenty years later, our Yan Family is announcing our return!”

“The reason why we have invited everyone is to announce this. Twenty years! We have been missing from the underworld of Rivertown for twenty years. Today, our Yan Family is back!”

Yan Gukong lifted his head slightly and looked across the two flags erected at two ends.

Return of the hidden dragon! Roaming the nine skies!

As he spoke, a faint smile appeared on his face. “I’m grateful to everyone who could attend the Yan Family’s banquet. Please enjoy the food and alcohol today. However, our Yan Family has a few things to announce before we start!”

It’s coming!

The entire banquet hall was silent. When they heard Yan Gukong, their hearts skipped a beat.

What was coming next would affect everyone’s interests.

Yan Gukong looked across the crowd and showed a faint smile.

“First, the Yan Family hasn’t participated in the quarrels of Rivertown in the last 20 years. Since we are announcing our return, it’s only natural for us to collect some interest. Experts rule the underworld. Our Yan Family won’t rob you guys of your interest. However, we will be collecting 20% of your resources.

“What? 20%!”

Before Yan Gukong had finished his words, a middle-aged man couldn’t help but exclaim.

“Wait for me to finish!” Yan Gukong stared at the middle-aged man and said plainly.

The middle-aged man immediately held his breath and did not dare to say another word.

The surrounding crowd turned solemn as they waited for Yan Gukong.

“Second, now that the underworld is changing and the competition for resources has gotten fiercer, our Yan Family welcomes any families who wish to become our affiliates.”

“Third, Ancient Martial Arts Families in Rivertown have been fighting over their own interests all along. I feel that we should get together and take a common stand against outsiders for survival!”

“Anyone has any objections?”

Ruthless! Ruthless Ruthless!

Each announcement was more ruthless than the previous.

First, collecting 20% of interests from every family.

Second, recruiting affiliates to the Yan Family.

Third, becoming the King of Rivertown. In other words, it was similar to the ruler of the underworld in ancient times.

When Yan Gukong completed his announcement, the surrounding Martial Artists and Ancient Martial Arts families instantly turned solemn.

The three announcements of Yan Gukong were simply ruthless.

“Our Cao Family supports the Yan Family. Old Yan and Yan Family’s strength are something that we all could see with our eyes!”

At this moment, a middle-aged man stood up and replied loudly. As he spoke, he looked across the crowd.

“Yan Family’s strength is miles ahead of us. If Old Yan really wants to do a major reshuffling in Rivertown, who can possibly stop him? Old Yan is compassionate. The three conditions aren’t too tough. Our Cao Family is willing to support the Yan Family!”

“I, Chang Gaoyang, am willing to join the Yan Family. I’ve always held Old Yan in high regards. I’m willing to join Yan Family and be on the same boat as them!”

“Our Wu Family is willing to support the Yan Family and become an affiliated family!”

One after another, leaders of various Ancient Martial Arts Families and Martial Artists stood up and announced their desire to join and support the Yan Family.

There were more than two dozen people who stood up and pledged their loyalty to the Yan Family.

“Haha, great. Now that you guys have joined our Yan Family, our Yan Family will naturally be kind to you. All of you will be part of the Yan Family from today onwards!”

Yan Gukong looked on as he spoke to the two dozen people.

“It is obvious that these people are bought over by the Yan Family in advance!”

“20% of our interests and to follow the instructions of the Yan Family from here onwards? That’s equivalent to treating us as his subordinates!”

“That’s too much! The conditions of the Yan Family were truly too much!”

Some were agreeable but the majority wasn’t willing to accept.

The Yan Family wants to collect 20% of our interests the moment they announce their return, and have even demanded our obedience? That’s no different from treating us as their subordinates!

The few families, which were seated at the forefront, exchanged glances.

“Old Yan, aren’t you too overbearing with your three conditions. Although the Yan Family is strong, aren’t you a little too over yourself by demanding to collect our interests and treating us like your subordinates? Our Hu Family is just a small family. All we are looking for is to survive steadily. We will not be participating in this!”

Seated in the first row, Hu Fei, who sat beside the leader of the Hu Family, stood up and spoke to Yan Gukong.

“The families in Rivertown have always sought their own development. Moreover, the relationships between Ancient Martial Arts Families in Rivertown are cordial. I don’t think your concerns are warranted!”

The 20th generation leader of the Ren Family, who was a Level 9 Martial Artist, also stood up and made his decision known.

Old Xue, Old Duan and the leaders of a few other families also stood up.

With regard to these three conditions, they couldn’t agree!

“Hahaha, great! Great! It’s alright! It’s only natural that you guys won’t agree!”

Yan Gukong laughed out loud. However, his expression turned vicious as he looked at the remaining Martial Artists.

“However, don’t forget that we are part of the underworld. In the underworld, experts rule. If you guys don’t agree, the Yan Family can only suppress you guys and make you guys agree with violence!”
