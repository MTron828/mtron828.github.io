What did it mean to be invincible in this generation.

If one was below the age of 50 and possessed the strength of the second level of the profound void tier, they could be considered invincible in the flowing sea region.

Not to mention the strength of the demon soul in the flowing sea region, even if it was placed in a wider and more vast region, it could still be ranked in the top three or even first.

When it stood on the Prodigy Bridge, it was already destined that the supreme prodigy stage in the sky would belong to it!

All the humans’faces were extremely unsightly, and their hearts were filled with helplessness.

How could such a prodigy King Beast resist?

In the human’s position, everyone was somewhat silent. Looking at The Prodigy King Beast filled with demonic flames, their expressions changed!

“Such a powerful demon beast, not to mention the human prodigy, even some veteran insightful void realm experts might not be a match for it!”

“If we lose, there’s no need to fight at all. The gap between the first and second level of the insightful void realm is too big. Even Ren Xingchen has the strength of the first level of the insightful void realm. Under the leadership of the nameless sword demon, he’s still not a match for the second level of the insightful Void Realm Demon Beast!”

Some of the human elites frowned slightly and shook their heads slowly.

“Despicable and shameless humans, I’ll let all of you elites go on stage today. Do you have the guts to fight? If you don’t, when you see us demon beasts in the future, you will obediently bow down to us, a bunch of ants!”

“You bunch of despicable fellows, you only used despicable methods to enter the training grounds. Roar Roar, now let’s have a fair fight and ask if you dare. You Bunch of Shameless bastards!”

Demon Soul saw that all of the humans were looking at him with fear in their eyes. Many of them were filled with fear as they mocked him angrily.

A few days ago, he had been chased by a despicable human in the training grounds. Even his precious treasure had been snatched away. He was incomparably furious.

He had already sworn that in the future, he would kill every single human he saw, and let the humans suffer the cruelty of the world.

“A bunch of ants!”

It stood on the Prodigy Bridge, raised its head, and roared mockingly in front of hundreds of thousands of people.

This made all the humans’faces extremely ugly.

Everyone knew that the blood flow empire had used the descent technique to enter the training ground.

However, everyone knew that the blood flow empire’s experts had been easily killed by the demon soul.

The Heaven’s Pride King Beast’s expert had already exceeded everyone’s expectations.

Although some people later said that human experts had once again descended to the training grounds and wantonly killed the demon beasts, this was only hearsay.

Now, it seemed that this matter was very likely true.

Speaking of which, it was already a disgraceful matter for human experts to use a special method to descend to the training grounds.

Now that it was brought out, it made everyone lose face.

“I really didn’t expect that this beauty’s strength would be so strong. However, the Demonic Beast’s demonic soul strength is somewhat heaven-defying. The Geniuses of your flowing sea region aren’t her match!”

“Even if this demonic soul was placed in our vast region, it would still be a top-notch genius!”

Manager Qian’s eyes flickered as he looked at the demonic soul and Ling Jian ‘ER in the arena. His eyes were filled with shock for the first time.

He did not expect that there would be such an outstanding genius in this small place. Even he was far inferior to him.

“That might not be the case. Ling Jian ‘ER has a battle prowess at the first level of the profound void martial stage. I believe that Ren Xingchen isn’t too bad either. In addition, he was able to insta-kill the nameless sword devil at the first level of the profound void martial stage. Perhaps, he might be able to contend against him!”

Long Xiaotian was slightly displeased with manager Qian’s words.

After interacting with him for the past few days, he realized that this manager Qian was incomparably arrogant. It was as if he had come from the city and looked down on the people from the countryside.

His lofty aura made him slightly displeased.

“Haha, What are you going to use to fight? A Heaven’s chosen like Ling Jian ‘ER has already appeared in your Liuhai District once in a thousand years. If you want to defeat the Demon Soul, even the top heaven’s chosen in our vast region don’t have the confidence to win!”

Shopkeeper Qian shook his head lightly and said with a smile.

“Yeah, this demon beast is too strong, Sigh!”

“There’s actually a heaven’s favorite at the second level of the profound void tier in the vast district. It’s truly terrifying!”

A few young men at the side said with some ingratiation.

Shopkeeper Qian smiled faintly and raised his head slightly. “More than twenty years ago, an elder of our Qian family reached the second level of the profound void tier at the age of fifty!”

“Hiss, so powerful? Shopkeeper Qian might also be able to reach the second level of the profound void tier at that age!”

“Haha, that’s right, that’s right. With shopkeeper Qian’s strength, he would be one of the top five prodigies in our flowing sea region!”

The bootlicking voices continued to ring out, causing Long Xiaotian to curl his lips slightly.

“Let me ask you, cowards of the human race, do you dare to fight!”

The taunting voice of the Demon Soul continued to ring out, and the demonic beasts around the arena let out a provocative roar!

Ling Jian ‘er held the longsword in her hand tightly. She turned her head and looked in Wang Xian’s direction.

When he saw Ling Jian ‘er looking over, Wang Xian looked at the extremely arrogant demon soul with a mocking expression on his face.

He nodded slowly at Ling Jian ‘ER.

“Alright, since you want to fight, we will accompany you!” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

When Ling Jian ‘er saw Wang Xian nodding his head, she immediately looked at the demon soul and said coldly,

“Senior, I Will Go First!”

Ren Xingchen looked at Wang Xian and said respectfully. Following that, he looked at the demon soul with his eyes filled with excitement and fighting spirit.

“Fight, what do we humans have to fear!”

His body moved and he flew down directly.

Facing a second level void interpretation stage demon soul, he knew that he was definitely not a match for it.

However, there was still his senior.

In his heart, his senior was invincible. Even though he was only 26 years old, in his heart, he was still invincible.

He would never forget that he was the one who saved him when he almost died twice.

Being able to fight alongside his senior was the most exciting thing for him.

Ren Xingchen flew to the arena and stood on the right side of Ling Jian ‘er, leaving a spot in the middle of them.

“Hiss, they actually chose to fight. This... isn’t wise!”

“What do you mean not wise? This is the true pride of humanity. How can they dare to call themselves the Pride of humanity without fighting? They are the true pride of Humanity!”

“This Ren Xingchen clearly has the battle prowess of a profound void Tier 1 expert. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have come down. I reckon the nameless sword demon is going to make a move too!”

“I think it’s better not to fight. Even if the three of them have the strength of a Level 1 demon soul, they aren’t a match for the Demon Soul. It’s a little risky!”

“They might have their own trump cards. Even if they can’t win, as long as they can survive, it’s fine. As long as they dare to fight, they will be the heroes of Humanity!”

“Support, fight! Fight!”

When the people around the arena saw them fighting, their expressions changed. Some frowned, some looked worried, and most of them were filled with admiration.

Even when facing such a powerful enemy, they still dared to fight.

Even if they lost, they were still human heroes.

“Roar, good, good. My Demon Soul, if I don’t kill all of you today, I’ll Be a heaven’s chosen beast King in vain!”
