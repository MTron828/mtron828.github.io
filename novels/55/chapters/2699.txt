The incipient sacred wings were a supreme treasure that Tian Chen had obtained together with that sorcery. It was also because of the incipient sacred wings that he was able to survive.

According to Tian Chen, the incipient sacred wings were a very powerful treasure.

Even when he was at his peak, he could not see through the materials of the incipient sacred wings.

Tian Chen wanted the incipient sacred wings so that he could build it on the biological armor.

Of course, this was only temporary on the biological armor. With the incipient sacred wings’mysteriousness and power, it could only be said to be a waste of resources.

As for consuming the normal embryo fruit, the sky formation was prepared to use it to destroy and give birth to the spirit of the Pinnacle Undying God King Abyss seed.

To create the biological armor, one needed to have a sliver of intelligence and complete control over it.

“This garish thing is quite interesting. Old Man, let’s study it together and create a biological armor. We’ll add some poison to it!”

Beside them, the demonic eight Qi looked over curiously and said.

“Hehe, sure. You two little fellows can turn into Dragon Wizards. I can teach you a thing or two in the future.”

Tian Chen looked at the two of them and said faintly.

“Hehe, it’s impossible for us to be your lackeys. We’re still waiting for a poisonous dragon to appear in the Dragon Palace. When we have the chance, we’ll turn into poisonous dragons. You’re a Dragon Wizard. It’s too strenuous for you.”

Mo Sha Ba Qi shook his head slightly and said directly.

Poisonous Dragons belonged to the dark mutated divine dragon and were also extremely powerful divine dragons. However, the Dragon Palace could not turn a dragon into a poisonous dragon.

This kind of mutated divine dragon required powerful treasures and opportunities.

“Hehe.”

Tian Chen smiled faintly and left without saying anything.

Mo Sha Ba Qi and the rest followed immediately. Duan Jinming and the clan leader of the Fire Hammer clan also followed behind.

The pinnacle of blacksmiths was the creator.

They could learn something from the creation of the biological armor.

Wang Xian saw it and smiled.

“Let all the disciples improve!”

He said faintly.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Prime Minister Gui nodded his head and immediately began to assign the matters regarding the improvement of the members of the Dragon Palace.

Wang Xian didn’t have much to do as he looked at the Heaven Formation.

In the next ten days, all the members of the Dragon Palace were improving their abilities.

On the Demon Island, a major event happened.

This sensational event came from the Dragon Palace.

Ten days after the Dragon Palace pacified the northern abyss, this news was spread out.

The first to know about this was the nine heavens breaking great sect.

The eastern abyss of the Demon Island was pacified, and no abyssal races appeared for the time being. The nine heavens breaking great sect and the others then focused their attention on the northern abyss of the Demon Island.

However, when they sent people to investigate, they found that there were no abyssal races in the Northern Abyss, which made them astonished.

After searching, they found that all the experts of the Dragon Palace had gone out to take action more than ten days ago, and finally, they received specific information from the Hierarch last month.

When they confirmed this matter, they were extremely shocked.

It was even more shocking than the last time when the Dragon Palace severely injured the world margin sect.

Then, Patriarch Nine Heavens and the others directly came to the Dragon Palace with heavy gifts to pay them a visit.

If the strength displayed by the Dragon Palace last time made them fearful, then this time, they were terrified.

They also understood the strength of the abyssal seeds in the Northern Abyss, which was similar to the ones in the east.

In the past, the abyssal seeds in the east could only be resisted by the combined forces of Jiuxiao, Duan Tian, and a bunch of other factions.

Now that the Dragon Palace was able to destroy such a force directly, it meant that the Dragon Palace had the strength to destroy Jiuxiao and Duan Tian.

They had to come over to express their goodwill!

Wang Xian naturally accepted Jiuxiao and Duan Tian’s visit to express his goodwill.

If one didn’t accept it, the other party might feel panicked.

Such a shocking matter was not known by ordinary people. Only a few powerhouses knew about it. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Following that, the entire demon island calmed down.

Without the threat of the abyssal seed, the Demon Island was much more relaxed.

However, compared to the calm of the Demon Island, the battles in other places were getting more and more intense.

On the AI, one could often see the cold night island and the fall of a certain sect’s powerhouse.

The fall of a certain sect’s powerhouse on the Ping Yi Island.

In the past few days, the AI reported that a peak immortal king powerhouse had fallen in the imperial court. An army of powerhouses had been attacked by the abyssal seeds and were all annihilated.

The battles in other places were getting more and more intense. The people on the demon island could feel that the abyssal invasion in other places was even more ferocious and cruel!

Wang Xian also learned some things about the other islands and the central region from the AI.

...

However, this place was very far away from the Demon Island. The members of the Dragon Palace were also in the process of upgrading, so he didn’t pay too much attention to it.

“Dragon King, all the upgrading of the disciples of the Dragon Palace is over!”

After a few days, Prime Minister Gui came to the Dragon King’s Hall and reported to Wang Xian.

“Very good, let them get used to it!”

Wang Xian smiled when he received the news.

The strength of the Dragon Palace had reached another peak.

“TSK TSK tsk, very good, very strong. Haha, Boss Dragon King, take a look!”

At this moment, Mo Sha’s voice sounded from outside. Following that, Wang Xian saw a black humanoid monster that was 2,000 meters in size enter the Dragon King’s palace.

It was 2,000 meters tall and every bone in its body was like a terrifying sharp weapon.

Behind it, there was a pair of jade-white bone wings. The white bone wings were about 3,000 to 4,000 meters in size.

Its body was filled with a strong murderous aura.

...

The aura of a peak godly king could be faintly felt.

Wang Xian looked over and his eyes were sparkling.

Buzz

Mo Sha flew out directly from the head of this terrifying monster with an excited expression.

At this moment, the sky array’s eight-limbed Duan Jinming and the rest walked in as well.

“Has it been completed?”

Wang Xian walked over and asked with a smile.

“Greetings, Dragon King!”

The moment he walked over, the humanoid monster immediately knelt down and bowed to Wang Xian.

“Dragon King, it has been completed. It has inherited the strength of the humanoid immortal King’s Peak Abyss Seed. With you as the leader, you can enter and take control of it.”

The Heaven Array walked over and said with a smile.

“It does have the taste of a mech.”

Wang Xian placed his palm on its body. Waves of information were transmitted. His body moved and entered its body directly.

The next moment, Wang Xian appeared at its head. With a thought, he could control it.

Similarly, even if he did not control it and encountered danger, it could still fight on its own.

In it, it did not affect Wang Xian’s ability to unleash his attacks at all. It was very mystical.

“This is very strong. I’ll call you dragon weapon from now on!”

Wang Xian said faintly.

Although this kind of thing was flashy, at this stage at least, the dragon weapon was a powerful combat subordinate.

It was also an extremely powerful bodyguard.

“It just so happens that my current strength has yet to reach the peak of the Immortal King Realm. With this, I’m not afraid of existences at the peak of the Immortal King Realm.”

Wang Xian smiled. This could be considered as relying on external things.

He had the feeling of a tycoon.
