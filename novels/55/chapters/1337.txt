Chapter 1338: 1338 items from the Dragon Palace. All of you must die

“Dragon King, the deep-sea spiritual spring is a small spiritual vein discovered by the Dragon Palace. It is 600 kilometers away from the Dragon Palace. However, after we discovered it, the undersea demon beasts discovered it. Half a year ago, leader Ao Qitian was killed in a battle. It took a lot of resources to resurrect him. After that, Prime Minister Gui led all the experts of the Dragon Palace on an expedition, but they were still unable to protect the deep-sea spiritual spring

“However, for the deep-sea spiritual spring, the Dragon Palace has ten percent of the resources, the sky-island Dynasty has seventy percent, the electric eel clan has ten percent, and the harpoon clan has ten percent

“Right now, Prime Minister Gui and the others are going to the deep-sea spiritual spring to take the spiritual stones that belong to us. In addition, the sky-island dynasty and the one-leaf continent dynasty are going to propose a marriage and invite the Dragon Palace

“A day ago, Prime Minister Gui and the rest went there personally to handle the matters regarding the deep sea spiritual spring and the Sky Island Dynasty!”

When the civil officials of the Dragon Palace heard Wang Xian’s question, they immediately bowed and reported respectfully.

When Wang Xian heard his words, he raised his eyebrows slightly. His eyes were sparkling.

“Are you saying that the deep sea spiritual spring was discovered by the Dragon Palace first? Later, it was discovered by the other demonic beast races, the Human Dynasty?”

His eyes flickered with a cold expression as he asked indifferently.

“It was the Dragon King. The deep-sea spiritual spring was discovered by a strange demon. However, when we were preparing to mine it, it was discovered by the other demon beasts. Finally, it was discovered by the human dynasty!”

“In the beginning, there was a competition. However, the human dynasty had a top-tier expert at the fourth level of the profound void tier. We couldn’t defend it at all, so we only got 10% !”

“However, even if it was 10% , it still brought a huge amount of resources to the Dragon Palace!”

The Dragon Palace’s civil official nodded and reported.

“10% ?”

A cold smile appeared in Wang Xian’s eyes.

“Where is the deep sea spiritual spring? Bring Me There!”

He stood up slowly and ordered with a twinkle in his eyes.

“It’s the Dragon King. I’ve never been there before. I’ll go and call for a Yaksha!”

The civil official nodded and walked out immediately. Soon, a member of the hag clan arrived.

“Dragon King, I know the location of the deep sea spiritual spring. I’ll Bring You There!”

The general of the hag clan bowed respectfully and said to Wang Xian.

“Come, Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian looked at Zhang Fengying. “Fengying, are you strolling around here, or are you coming with me...”

“I’ll go with you!”

Zhang Fengying said directly.

“Alright, let’s go. Show me the direction!”

Wang Xian moved his body and transformed into a terrifying divine dragon that was 50 meters long.

He waved his arm and Zhang Fengying landed on his body.

As for Yaksha who was at the side, he was controlled by Wang Xian’s energy and was guiding the direction.

He didn’t dare to stand on Wang Xian’s body. He wouldn’t dare to do so even if he was given ten guts.

As for Zhang Fengying, Feng Luan, and the other girls, they were naturally in a special situation.

“Let’s Go!”

“Roar!”

Wang Xian let out a soft roar and a dragon’s roar sounded. His huge body flew deeper into the ocean.

His speed was several times faster than the demon soul. Especially in the ocean, his speed was even more terrifying.

His huge body that was fifty meters long emitted a powerful dragon’s might.

In the surroundings, some aquatic creatures sensed Wang Xian’s aura. They laid in the water from a distance of 1,000 meters and worshipped him.

With Wang Xian’s current speed, he only needed about 10 minutes to cover a distance of 600 kilometers. In fact, his speed was even faster than his current speed.

“Dragon King, it’s right in front of us!”

At this moment, the Yaksha that was controlled by Wang Xian’s energy pointed forward respectfully and said to Wang Xian.

“Okay!”

Wang Xian looked at a spot three kilometers in front of him. His body came to a stop slowly as his eyes flickered.

There was a huge underwater factory in front of him.

At this moment, the depth of the factory was about 20,000 to 30,000 meters.

Even so, the factory that was similar to a base in front of him was very vast.

A thousand-meter-sized ship was floating in the middle of the sea. The entire ship was flashing with a blue luster and looked extremely mystical.

At the bottom of the ship, demonic beasts of all shapes and sizes were scattered all around. There were the electric eel demonic beasts that were more than ten meters long and were emitting lightning bolts. There were also the sea fork demonic beasts that were bloated and had forks on their heads and arms.

Most of them were humans.

Similarly, Wang Xian also saw members of the Dragon Clan inside.

The deep sea spiritual spring was simply a deep sea spiritual vein. Even if it was just a small-scale deep sea spiritual vein, it was still priceless.

It was possible to collect trillions or even tens of trillions of middle-grade spiritual stones from the deep-sea spiritual spring.

This was definitely a terrifying treasure trove. If the Dragon Palace could obtain all of it, it would at least increase the strength of all the members of the Dragon Palace by one or two levels.

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian’s gaze swept ahead. His body moved and he reverted to his human form as he walked towards the deep-sea spiritual spring.

The Yaksha immediately followed closely behind Wang Xian.

Zhang Fengying followed closely behind with a curious expression.

They were at the bottom of the deep sea. However, the area in front of them was emitting a white glow.

That was the glow emitted by the spiritual stones.

“Stop! Who Are You?”

Just when Wang Xian and the other two were about a thousand meters away from the deep sea spiritual spring, a cold voice was suddenly heard.

Two extraordinary level eight humans appeared in front of them and glanced at Wang Xian and the other two.

“We are from the Dragon Palace. Please let us in!”

The Yaksha quickly stepped forward and bowed. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“From the Dragon Palace?”

The two middle-aged men looked at Wang Xian and Zhang Fengying. Their eyes lingered on Zhang Fengying for a few seconds.

“Hehe, I didn’t expect there to be so many beauties in Your Dragon Palace. Let’s go in!”

A lewd look flashed across the eyes of the two middle-aged men as they said faintly.

“Thank you!”

The Yaksha nodded and led the way for Wang Xian.

Wang Xian glanced at the two middle-aged men. His eyes were filled with indifference.

“Dragon King, come over here. There are two thousand members of our Dragon Palace who dig for spiritual stones here. After that, we will distribute the spiritual stones!”

The Yaksha brought Wang Xian to the largest house in front of them.

Wang Xian looked around. Some members of the Dragon Palace looked over when they sensed the arrival of the Dragon King.

He gestured to the members of the Dragon Palace to stay still and continued to walk forward.

“Peng, Heaven Island dynasty. Isn’t the distribution this time a little too low? The middle-grade spirit stones dug out this month are at least one hundred billion middle-grade spirit stones. Why do we only have five billion here?”

Just as Wang Xian approached, he heard an angry roar.

The voice sounded familiar. It was obviously from AO qitian.

“Less? How is it less? Last month, you guys also had 5 billion middle-grade spirit stones. This month, it’s the same. How is it less?”

“Haha, 5 billion. That’s it. That’s your share. Cut the crap. If you want it, then take it. If not, then get lost!”

A sinister voice and a maniacal laughter continued to come from within!

I was going to publish five more chapters, but after writing a few, I felt that it wasn’t very well written. I even published two more chapters. I might as well just cancel the second chapter and then cancel everything I wrote yesterday.

I wanted to make the plot more exciting. If I wasn’t satisfied with it, I would just delete it. As a result, I only published one chapter yesterday (I deleted the second chapter after I published it) , but it took twice as much time as usual.

I got up at night and wrote another chapter, and Tomorrow I’ll be back to normal, and I’ll do everything I can to make it good!

I’m sorry, everyone!
