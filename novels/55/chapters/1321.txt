Chapter 1322: 1,323 guests

One emperor and one courtier!

Although the transcendence continent respected martial arts, if long Xiaotian could ascend to the throne, as a relative of his mother’s side, it would be equivalent to ascending to the heavens in a single step.

As the King’s cousin, he would naturally receive many benefits in the future.

“So it’s the Hua family. Brothers, come forward. Please take care of me in the Light Dragon Dynasty in the future!”

While the Hua family members were talking arrogantly, a complimentary voice came from the back.

“Hehe, we’re all friends. These are the members of the Lingnan family of Lingnan City, right?”

“Yes, yes, we’re from the Lingnan family. We’re here to congratulate the second prince on inheriting the position of crown prince!”

Dozens of middle-aged young men were floating in the air with smiles on their faces. Beside them, five or six young men, middle-aged men and even old men were talking to the Hua family members warmly.

The second Prince had inherited the throne, and the clan that benefited the most from it was the second Prince’s mother’s clan.

As the tide rises, the boat rises. In the future, the Hua clan would definitely hold great power.

“Hey, the two in front, which clan are you from?”

At this moment, the voice of a young man came from behind.

“HMM?”

Wang Xian turned his head and looked at the young man from the Lingnan clan. He raised his eyebrows and asked, “What’s the matter?”

“Nothing much. Brother, if you are not in a hurry, please step back for a moment and let the Chinese people stand in front. Is that Alright?”

The young man from the Lingnan family said with a smile on his face.

Wang Xian smiled faintly and did not mind it. “Sure!”

“Hehe, young man, you are not bad. Since you are able to attend this ceremony, it means that you have some status. When you come to Lingnan city in the future, I will bring you to have some fun!”

The young man looked like he was not bad. He patted Wang Xian on the shoulder and praised him.

Wang Xian smiled nonchalantly.

Although the queue was very long, it was very quick to enter. In just a few minutes, there were only a dozen people left.

It was obvious that the people from the Lingnan family wanted to curry favor with the Chinese.

The group of Chinese people glanced at Wang Xian and did not take it to heart.

“Everyone, take out the invitation cards for the ceremony!”

The line was getting shorter and shorter. The voices of a few guards came from the front.

Two middle-aged men in armor who were riding on a transcendent level nine black shadow Panther were checking the invitation cards one by one.

Around them, there were a row of warriors in black armor who were riding on ferocious beasts.

They stood there proudly and looked at the group of people who had entered.

“Black Armored Cavalry. The second Prince’s Black Armored Cavalry. There are more than 100 people in total. Each of them is at least at transcendent-level rank 7. They are very powerful!”

“The strength of this black armored cavalry is almost comparable to some top battle teams of the Radiant Dragon Dynasty!”

“This black armored cavalry looks arrogant. TSK, TSK, I’m really envious. They are the second prince’s true confidants!”

The voices of the Hua clan and the Lingnan clan came from the front. Their faces were filled with envy.

Some of the clans in the surrounding Guanglong dynasty were also looking at them with envy and respect.

The Hua clan and the Lingnan clan handed over the invitation letters and nodded to the black armored cavalrymen with smiles on their faces.

“Invitation...”

Wang Xian and Zhang Fengying walked over and the two black armored cavalrymen spoke as usual.

However, when they saw Wang Xian, they were stunned before they could speak.

“Young master Wang!”

The two black armored cavalry soldiers immediately bowed respectfully to Wang Xian.

“Huh?”

“Huh?”

This caused the hua people and the people from the Lingnan family who had just walked in to turn their heads in astonishment.

When they saw the black armored cavalry soldiers bow respectfully to the young man who was standing in front of them, their eyes widened even more.

This...

Who was he?

“Young master Wang, our prince has been looking for you for a long time. He thought that you wouldn’t be able to come today!” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Young master Wang, let us bring you there!”

At this moment, two figures flew over from a short distance away.

One of them was Bai Qingshan, who was dressed in a white robe, and the other was elder Zhu.

They came to Wang Xian’s side with some respect as well and said with a smile.

“I had some matters to attend to not long ago, but I just happened to be in time!”

Wang Xian smiled faintly and said to them.

“Young master Wang, let’s go. We will bring you in!”

Bai Qingshan and elder Zhu extended their hands toward him respectfully.

Wang Xian nodded his head and followed them into the room.

“Who... who is he? How could he allow senior Bai and senior Zhu to bring him in directly? Senior Bai and senior Zhu are the second prince’s true confidants!”

“The two insightful emptiness realm experts who followed the second Prince at the very beginning actually treated that young man so respectfully. Who is he? could he be that brother of the second Prince?”

“You mean, that young master Wang who helped the second Prince?”

The hearts of the Hua people and the members of the Lingnan clan turned cold. They were shocked as they watched the two insightful emptiness realm experts personally send the young man over.

The surrounding clans of the Light Dragon dynasty also watched this scene in shock.

Everyone knew that the second prince could easily take over the position of crown prince because of the help of a young man.

Because of that young man, the second prince was able to do so smoothly.

Moreover, according to rumors, that young man’s connections were very powerful. He knew the daughter of the sect master of the Heavenly Sword sect as well as the major figures in the vast region.

“Young master Wang, the prince has instructed that if you come, you will sit here!”

At the heavenly worship ceremony and the place where the prince was established, there were many viewing platforms.

In the center was the place where the king, the important ministers, the royal elders, and the Princess Sat.

Below that was the position of the city lords of the Light Dragon Dynasty.

At this level, the first position was the position of the Hua people.

The Hua people, the clansmen of long Xiaotian’s mother, had contributed a lot to long Xiaotian’s ascension to the throne.

There were two seats at the front of the Hua people.

One was the leader of the Hua people, and the other was a seat specially reserved for Wang Xian.

When Wang Xian and the rest arrived, many hua people had already arrived.

Many seats around them were already filled with people.

An old man holding a walking stick was already sitting at the front. Behind him were a group of old men and middle-aged men.

Their faces were all flushed red. Clearly, they were very happy.

“Oh? This should be young master Wang. Haha, Please Take A Seat!”

The leader of the Hua people stood up with a warm expression and extended his hand to shake Wang Xian’s hand.

“Hello, this old man should be long Xiaotian’s grandfather!”

Wang Xian extended his hand with a smile.

“Yes, yes. Xiaotian is really lucky to have a brother like you. Come and have a seat!”

Long Xiaotian’s grandfather invited him enthusiastically. He looked at the seat behind him and said, “Come, Xiao Liang. Your seat is for young master Wang’s friend!”

“Yes, yes!”

An old man at the back smiled and nodded. He immediately stood up and invited Zhang Fengying.

A guest, a real guest!
