Chapter 1608: 1608 shocked the world

“It’s over. The relationship between the goddess of desolation and the lone sect. The Sky Demon is doomed!”

“This time, not only the sky demon is doomed, even the old man Mo Sha is in trouble. The goddess of desolation is too powerful!”

“Sigh, brother Wang Xian...”

At the positions of the He clan and the Wuji Empire, when they saw the goddess of desolation suddenly appearing in the void and heard the voice of the Supreme Sect Master, their faces revealed a helpless expression.

The desolate goddess was an extremely mysterious woman who possessed an incomparably terrifying gigantic beast.

After the desolate goddess appeared and destroyed a first-rate family, she was declared as the fourth largest super force in the vast region.

A human and a beast were considered super forces. One could imagine how much fear everyone had towards the desolate goddess.

In fact, just now, everyone had compared the ten thousand meter body of the sky demon to the desolate goddess’gigantic beast.

In comparison, everyone still thought that the giant beast of the desolate goddess was more terrifying.

Now, the Sky Demon’s strength had greatly decreased, and with the arrival of the desolate goddess, it could easily punish the sky demon.

“This time, the Sky Demon’s hope of sacrificing a level 9 profound void martial artist with his life is about to be lost!”

The elder of the Wuji Empire’s level 8 profound void martial artist said with some disappointment.

Wu Qing city watched helplessly from the side.

As for he yuan, he suiqing, and the rest, they let out an indignant and sorrowful sigh.

“Oh! Oh!”

The terrifying giant beast completely emerged from the black hole.

His gigantic gray eyes looked at Wang Xian in the sky. There was some excitement in his eyes as he let out a cheerful voice once again.

The moment he came out, he sensed that extremely familiar aura.

That aura that was like his father.

The huge beast, Xiao Lan!

The mysterious woman who was floating in the middle of Xiao Lan’s huge mouth had naturally left the dragon palace. She was Lan Qingyue, who had left Wang Xian for more than two years.

Lan qingyue, who possessed the inheritance of the ancient god kun-feeding master, had potential that was not inferior to the divine dragon inheritance.

After the Dragon Palace moved to the extraordinary continent, she led little blue on the path of the strong.

This journey lasted for more than two years.

Her strength had already reached the eighth level of the profound void tier. As for little blue, she was even stronger than her.

Because of a coincidence, she found that the only sect had obtained a large number of life stones, so she wanted to obtain them from there.

Little Blue’s strength increased rapidly, so she needed more and more energy.

However, as long as she could obtain the life stones from only me sect, she could greatly increase little blue’s strength.

She could even break through to the longevity realm, become a demigod, and become a space beast.

As long as she obtained these life stones, Lan Qingyue decided to return to the Dragon Palace, her husband’s side, and her sister’s side.

Back to her home.

When she came out from the Kun Cave, a blood connection and a spiritual connection was immediately transmitted over.

She ignored the figure of the supreme headmaster and the purpose of her visit.

She quickly looked at that figure.

“Xiao Xian, husband!”

When Lan Qingyue saw the body of the Divine Dragon with attributes, two years of longing and two years of emotions made her burst out completely.

Her body trembled slightly.

However, when she sensed the condition of Wang Xian’s body, her face instantly darkened.

She felt heartache and a surge of anger.

This was her husband. She had distanced herself from him in order to increase her strength so that she could fight alongside her husband and help him.

Now that she saw that he was severely injured and could not even recover from it, the dignity and anger that she had accumulated over the past two years of training burst out completely.

“Female sovereign of the Wildlands Sea, help us kill the Sky Demon first, then kill this level 9 profound void martial artist. Our southern royal family promises to mobilize all our strength to help you find what you need!”

Nangong Jianghe, who was dozens of kilometers away from the battlefield, also hurriedly shouted.

His face was also filled with excitement. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

The Sky Demon was heavily injured, and the wilderness goddess had descended. Once the wilderness goddess helped them, they would be able to easily destroy the Sky Demon.

With the wilderness goddess’mysterious energy, she could definitely keep Mo Sha.

Excitement, excitement, and fervor!

“Hahaha, wilderness goddess, our two superpowers have promised that as long as you help us, we will definitely repay you tenfold!”

When the supreme sect master heard the promise from the southern Royal Family, he also roared with excitement.

Previously, he was able to use the life stone to invite the barbarian goddess. This time around, he was confident that he could get her to help them.

“That’s great, the barbarian goddess is here. Kill the Sky Demon, kill the Sky Demon!”

At this moment, ao Tian also roared in a low and savage voice.

Because of the woman he liked, the only sect had fallen into this situation.

After this matter was over, he would definitely be a sinner of the lone sect. However, as long as he killed the Sky Demon, he would be able to reduce his crimes.

“It’s over. The two superpowers have made a huge promise to invite them, and with the relationship between the wilderness goddess and them, the sky demon and the elder might be left behind!”

“The Sky Demon and the other peerless expert should have left long ago. Now, with the Wilderness Goddess’strange methods, it will be difficult for them to escape!”

When the surrounding forces saw this scene, they thought to themselves.

“Xiao Xian!”

When Lan Qingyue heard the words of the supreme headmaster and Nangong Jianghe, her body trembled slightly and she clenched her fists tightly.

She opened her mouth and called out gently to Wang Xian.

Her voice instantly resounded throughout the entire world.

Xiao Xian?

The gentle call stunned the excited supreme headmaster and everyone from the sect.

Everyone around was also stunned.

“Husband!”

“Woo!”

Another voice was heard along with the cheers of the terrifying giant beast.

Xiao Lan brought the wilderness goddess and flew slowly towards the Sky Demon.

Xiao Lan’s huge figure moved and came directly in front of Wang Xian. She used her head to touch Wang Xian gently in an attempt to please him.

Lan qingyue gently caressed Wang Xian’s huge dragon head. A mysterious energy entered Wang Xian’s body and healed his injuries.

However, at this moment, the entire world seemed to have turned silent.

Everyone, everyone!

Everyone was looking at this scene in disbelief.

Husband!

These two words resonated deeply in everyone’s mind like thunder.

The Sky Demon, the saint of Light, and the priest. Everyone knew that his real name was Wang Xian.

Xiao Xian was such an affectionate name!

Husband, this was a form of address between husband and wife!

The Sky Demon was the husband of the wilderness goddess, the wilderness goddess, and the wife of the Sky Demon.

What the F * ck!

Shocking!

“Cough cough, qingyue, it’s been more than two years. Did you miss me?”

Wang Xian looked at Lan Qingyue’s sudden appearance. He was also a little surprised and pleasantly surprised.

His figure moved and transformed into a human form. He gently touched her face and his face was full of smiles!
