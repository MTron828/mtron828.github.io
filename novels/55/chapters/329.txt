Chapter 330: Kill the Saint, Leave With Ease

The taunt resounded within the Heavenly Sound Sect. However, the entire Heavenly Sound Sect quietened down after Wang Xian’s voice died down.

No one dared to make a move. The expressions on the Inborn experts from the Heavenly Sound Sect were changing rapidly.

The atmosphere instantly chilled.

Around them, the disciples of the Heavenly Sound Sect were shocked and horrified.

Feeling that unrivalled aura, their bodies were shivering in fear. They were surprised to see that the members of the upper management of the sect did not react to the taunt.

There were fourteen Inborn Realm experts and two Inborn-level Sacred Birds from the Heavenly Sound Sect right now!

However, they didn’t dare to attack the ten assassins from the Abyss.

This...

It’s him! It’s definitely him!

At this moment, Tang Yinxuan stared intensely at Wang Xian from the side of the training field.

Even though he was wearing the Abyss Mask, she could still recognize him. That familiar figure was his!

The amiable young man who had brought her an Inborn Spiritual Weapon as gift yesterday was currently in their Sacred Sect and had killed the granddaughter of her Vice Sect Leader.

The scene of Wang Xian standing upright and facing off against the experts of the Sect greatly shocked her.

What incredible strength and imposing stance!

Tang Yinxuan couldn’t match the figure of the person she had met and had a meal together with yesterday with the one in front of her eyes currently. However, she was certain that it was him!

“Haha! If you guys aren’t going to fight, we are leaving then!”

Wang Xian laughed out loud and looked haughtily at the group. Behind the mask, he revealed a faint expression of ridicule.

“Oh right!”

At this moment, Wang Xian turned his head around.

The experts of the Heavenly Sound Sect stared bitterly at Wang Xian. Murderous intent and shame filled their eyes.

“Old hag, you were too arrogant previously. Moreover, the disciple of the Heavenly Sound Sect have killed two disciples of ours. I have to kill another one!”

As he finished his words, his figure disappeared from sight instantly. The next moment, Wang Xian appeared before the Saint of the Heavenly Sound Sect.

“Don’t you dare!”

When the old lady saw Wang Xian appearing before the newly crowned Saint in an instant, she was infuriated.

She played the Heavenly Sound Zither instantly and sharp wind blades shrouded towards Wang Xian.

Wang Xian didn’t even look back. Waving his hand back, the dragon head around him enlarged.

Rawrr! A wall of flames neutralized all the wind blades.

Seeing this, the experts of the Heavenly Sound Sect gasped. This was how horrifying and invincible a Dan Realm expert was.

At this moment, Wang Xian stared coldly at the horrified Saint of the Heavenly Sound Sect.

He was the young men who provoked him the previous day.

“No. We have no qualms. No... Please don’t kill me...”

At this moment, Wang Xian could no longer see the arrogance and haughtiness from the Saint.

He pleaded for mercy in horror and his face was filled with cold sweat. He almost wanted to kneel on the floor.

“Didn’t you say you were going to kill me personally?” Wang Xian looked mockingly at the Saint of the Heavenly Sound Sect and repeated the ruthless words he had said to Wang Xian the previous day.

“What?”

The Saint was lost in the instant. However, a figure quickly flashed in his mind.

His eyes popped wide open and were filled with disbelief.

It can’t be! How can this be possible?

His inner self was screaming in despair. That rascal from yesterday, that insignificant guy from before...

He’s actually the leader of the Abyss! He’s the horrifying existence that all the experts in the Sect didn’t dare to go against!

Yet, he had actually made a bold claim to kill him the previous day.

He felt strength being sapped away from his body as he slumped onto the chair behind him. His eyes were filled with despair.

Tsk!

Contempt gleamed in Wang Xian’s eyes. Waving his arm, intense flames shrouded the Saint.

Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

“Abyss!”

A deep growl came from an Inborn expert of the Heavenly Sound Sect. Wang Xian turned over and laughed, “Now that we have taken our revenge, the Abyss shall no longer have any feud with you guys. Obviously, if you guys aren’t satisfied, our Abyss wouldn’t mind playing with you!”

The hysterical laughter resounded throughout the training field. Subsequently, Wang Xian jumped and left rapidly.

Behind him, Mo Qinglong, Mo Yuan and the other dragonians followed closely behind and left the Heavenly Sound Sect.

The members of the upper management of the Heavenly Sound Sect pulled long faces and looked bitterly at the rapidly disappearing figures.

They couldn’t help but feel helpless.

“If our Laozu was here, we wouldn’t have had to suffer such grievances!” the Sect Leader of the Heavenly Sound Sect growled bitterly, clenching his fist tightly.

Ten assassins of the Abyss had barged into their Heavenly Sound Sect and killed two of their disciples right in front of them. One of them was the granddaughter of the Vice Sect Leader while the other was their Saint.

They showed no regards and killed them in a domineering manner.

Puff!

“I’ll report this to Laozu. Besides this, settle this matter as soon as possible!”

The old lady took a deep breath. She stared at the book in the hands of the Sect Leader and instructed coldly.

The Abyss had killed their disciples! This was something they would want to make them pay for!

However, the one who had offended the Abyss and resulted in them killing the disciples of the Heavenly Sound Sect would receive punishment too, regardless of whether she was already dead.

Nonetheless, they wanted to investigate this matter thoroughly. If there were people supporting these people in the dark, they shall not be forgiven either!

The old lady took a glance at the Vice Sect Leader before leaving.

The surrounding few Inborn experts also pulled long faces as they moved towards the main peak to discuss the matter.

“That’s too horrifying!”

“The Abyss is simply too strong. They actually managed to intimidate our experts from taking actions!”

“Their strength has definitely reached the level of a Sacred Sect. Otherwise, our Heavenly Sound Sect wouldn’t be that wary!”

“Perhaps it’s because our Laozu isn’t around and the Supreme Elder didn’t dare to act rashly. The assassin from the Abyss is too strong. Look at our training field. Even the tough flooring of the training field has cracks of over ten meters long. Is he still human?” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Our Saint was killed directly. He’s really unlucky!”

“The Abyss is indeed incomparably horrifying and domineering, just as the rumors said. The Saint hadn’t offended them but was still implicated in this.”

The surrounding disciples exchanged glances and whispered softly among themselves.

For the disciples of the Heavenly Sound Sect, it was as though they had experienced a 10.0 earthquake.

The self-proclaimed invincible Sect was invaded directly and the invaders even killed on the ground.

This had doused their arrogant attitude with a cold basin of water.

“How did Senior sister Hu offend the assassins of the Abyss? From what their leader said, it appears that Senior sister Hu had employed the Dark Conjurers to assassinate their disciples!”

At this moment, the disciples of the Heavenly Sound Sect thought of a question when they looked at the corpse on the stage.

The crowd was confused, baffled, surprised and shocked.

“Who would have expected things to develop like this?”

Tang Yinxuan looked at the Hao Zhong in his hands before looking in the direction where the Saint had been reduced to dust. At this moment, she couldn’t help but sigh.

She knew why Hu Qingqing had been killed and also the reason why the Saint had eventually been reduced to dust.

“All of these things were simply the consequences of their actions. The pride of an expert isn’t something they could offend. They were too arrogant!”

Tang Yinxuan shook her head slightly and placed Hao Zhong back into the box.

After today’s incident, the position of the Saintess was almost certainly hers.
