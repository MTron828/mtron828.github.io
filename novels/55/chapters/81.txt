“Brother, we have already spent over $70,000 on skincare products. How much money is left on the card? All items we have bought add up to over $300,000!”

Walking out from the Lancôme shop, Wang Xian had a few other things in his hands. Currently, his hands were full of bags.

However, with his current strength, it was an easy task to carry all these.

“Let’s go on. We haven’t gotten any shoes.” Wang Xian smiled. He was also very delighted to see his sister being so jubilant.

This was the first time he could buy her things without reserve.

“Eh, there’s a watch shop right there. You guys can go and take a look first while I organize the things in my hands. There are too many bags right now,” Wang Xian said to his sister.

“Senior, let us help you with some of those,” Xiao Mi said, feeling a little embarrassed.

Wang Xian shook his head and smiled. “It’s fine. These aren’t heavy anyway. Go and take a look first while I organize these.”

“Alright, I’ll go with Xiao Mi then. Brother, you can be our bodyguard today! Hehe!”

Xiao Yu smiled as she pulled along Xiao Mi into the Patek Philippe Watch shop.

“Hmm?”

When the two of them entered, they saw a group of familiar people immediately. Jiang Shuang was in front of the cabinet, trying out the watches.

“The price of this watch is a little over $37,000. It’s a discounted item in our shop and looks great on you,” the store attendant said to Jiang Shuang.

Jiang Shuang looked at the watch on her and was truly fond of it.

However, her family only gave her $60,000 this time. If she bought this, she would be a little tight on money. Therefore, she was a little hesitant.

“Hmm? Why did they follow us here?”

At this moment, a guy behind her was surprised to see Xiao Yu and Xiao Mi walk into the shop.

“We didn’t follow you guys here. We are here to take a look at our own accord,” Xiao Mi looked at them and said.

Xiao Yu saw Jia Wenrui and the group look over but didn’t pay attention to them. She walked over to the cabinet in front of her and started looking at the watches within it.

“These watches are so expensive!” Xiao Yu was a little shocked by the prices of these watches.

As compared to luxury bags, the prices of watches were even more eye-popping.

Just a casual watch would cost $30,000 – $40,000. There were even some that cost over $100,000 or even several hundreds of thousands.

“Patek Philippe is a world-class watch brand. A good watch could cost as much as a luxury car,” Xiao Mi reminded her from the side.

Xiao Yu’s jaw dropped open. She looked into the cabinet and saw a watch that cost $80,000. “This watch is so beautiful.”

“Hey salesgirl, can you take this out for us to take a look?” Xiao Mi said to a salesgirl standing at the side.

“Tsk, shameless.”

At this moment, Jiang Shuang, who was sitting a short distance away and trying out a watch, looked over at Xiao Yu and Xiao Mi with deep contempt. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“You guys should take a look at the price of the watch. Can you guys even afford it? Taking a look? Can you all pay for it if you scratch it?”

When the salesgirl heard what Jiang Shuang said, she looked at Xiao Mi and Xiao Yu with hesitation.

They were wearing very ordinary clothes. It was especially so for Xiao Yu. In fact, one could say that her clothes were of rather poor quality.

They weren’t wearing any accessories and didn’t look like they could afford the watch at all.

“Are you sure you are buying?” the salesgirl in front of Jiang Shuang asked them.

Xiao Mi and Xiao Yu were furious upon hearing this.

This was their first time in such a luxury watch shop and it was natural for them to feel angry when being questioned in such a way by the salesgirl.

“Can’t I try it if I’m not sure?” Xiao Mi replied angrily.

She knew that Xiao Yu’s brother was rich and could afford it.

“Hehe, not sure?” Jiang Shuang laughed in a condescending manner. She looked at them and added, “Can you guys afford it? Can’t you see the price on it? You should have taken a look at yourself!”

“If you can’t afford it, it’s better if you don’t try it on,” the salesgirl said after hearing the words of the customer in front of her.

“Did you see this? If you don’t have the money, don’t shop around here and waste everyone’s time,” Jiang Shuang mocked.

The words of the salesgirl and Jiang Shuang made the faces of Xiao Mi and Xiao Yu turn red rapidly.

They were all 18-19 years old girls and naturally wouldn’t have encountered such mockery and belittlement.

“We... Who says that we can’t afford it...” Xiao Mi was seething in anger! Her eyes had turned a little red, from both anger and embarrassment.

Tsk. Jiang Shuang sneered and stood up directly. She said to the salesgirl in front of her, “I’ll be taking this watch on me. Please wrap it up for me.”

“Thank you, miss. Thank you, miss.” That salesgirl was thrilled and immediately walked over.

“I’ll be paying by card!” Jiang Shuang held out a bank card.

“Xiao Yu.”

At this moment, Jia Wenrui suddenly walked over to Xiao Yu who looked ghastly. He took a glance at the watch in the cabinet.

“If you like it, I’ll buy it for you, but you have to be my girlfriend.”

Jia Wenrui put on a strong front. He stared intensely at Xiao Yu and continued, “I can give you a life that you could never imagine. All you have to do is to agree to be my girlfriend and you wouldn’t have to suffer with your brother. All you have to do is to agree and you will never have to be looked down on by a salesgirl in a shop.”

Jia Wenrui revealed a confident look. He knew that his words could definitely move a girl. To him, no one would choose to not pursue a better life.

As long as she was with him, he was able to provide.

“Wenrui!” Jiang Shuang was shocked upon hearing Jia Wenrui. Her face quickly sank and turned hideous as she walked over. “Wenrui, she’s just a little brat from a village. Her dressing is bad and her family is poor. Why would you...”

“Shut up!”

At this moment, a cold shout pierced through the atmosphere. Even the temperature in the whole shop seemed to have fallen by several degrees.

Wang Xian happened to overhear Jia Wenrui’s words when he walked in after organizing the bags in his hand. He also heard what the girl with the online celebrity’s face said about his sister. This made his face twitch with anger.

“Brother?” Xiao Yu saw Wang Xian and immediately walked to him. Her face was still a little red with embarrassment and anger.

“Senior Wang Xian.” Xiao Mi also walked over.

Wang Xian looked condescendingly at Jiang Shuang and Jia Wenrui.

“Thrash! Thrash that is so full of yourself just because your family is rich.”

Wang Xian looked coldly at Jia Wenrui and continued, “Tsk. Give my sister a life she cannot imagine? With how you are currently?”

“Do you know how much these things in my hands are? Did your parents give you enough money?”

“Salesgirl, get me the most expensive and the best female watch in this shop!”

Wang Xian placed the things in his hands on the cabinet as he spoke coldly.

Clothes from Prada, bags and clothes from LV, skincare products from Lancome. All of them were the latest design.

One of the salesgirls saw the 7-8 bags on the cabinet and was surprised. These things would most likely cost $200,000 – $300,000!

“Alright, alright!” a salesgirl quickly replied. “Sir, these are the best female watches we have. This watch has diamonds embedded at this spot and sapphire here...”

“This watch. Payment by card,” Wang Xian said as he pointed to the watch he felt looked the best.

“Sir, are you really going to buy? This watch costs $888,000. Are you sure?” The voice of the salesgirl was trembling.

“Wrap it up.” Wang Xian threw the card on it directly.

“Yes, sir.” That salesgirl was thrilled. What a rich tycoon to spend $888,000 without batting an eye!

“Get your manager here,” Wang Xian said coldly to the salesgirl.

“Yes, sir.” That salesgirl was shocked and quickly ran to a small storage room at the back.

A middle-aged woman walked out and looked at Wang Xian. With a warm tone, she greeted, “Sir, thank you for visiting Patek Philippe. Is there anything you need?”

“My sister was here a while ago and was looked down on by your salesgirl. Give me an explanation!” Wang Xian said to the middle-aged manager with an indifferent tone.

The middle-aged manager was shocked and frowned at the salesgirl.

As an international brand, they had very high demands for the quality of service and cared a lot about word-of-mouth.

Now, this young customer who spent $888,000 without batting an eye was questioning her directly and wanted her to give him an explanation.

In such a scenario, she really had to give him an explanation.

Everyone around was dumbfounded.

When Jia Wenrui heard Wang Xian calling him “thrash,” he had wanted to retort. However, when he saw the luxury goods in his hands, he was stunned.

He knew very clearly about these things. The prices of these items in Xiao Yu’s brother’s hand weren’t cheap.

He was even more shocked when he saw Xiao Yu’s brother buy a female watch that cost $888,000 immediately.

At the same time, Jiang Shuang was watching Wang Xian’s actions in disbelief.

He bought an $888,000 female watch without batting an eye!

The other young men were even more shocked. $8880,000! $888,000 for a single watch!

This...

Didn’t they say that Xiao Yu and her brother only had each other since young and had a tough life?

This is what they consider tough?
