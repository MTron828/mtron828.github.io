Chapter 346: Ancient God Kun Breeder

The lingering will of the blood in the corpse is actually able to control the surrounding creatures instinctively. In this process, it mutates the surrounding creatures to protect itself. At the same time, it is absorbing the fresh blood of these creatures to revive itself. What a horrifying ability!

Wang Xian couldn’t believe what he was seeing. He stared blankly at the corpse and his expression was changing violently.

There are lots of living creatures in the Yellow River. However, this corpse only controlled those smaller creatures like ants, mosquitoes and leeches. Why didn’t it control the fish? Especially those bigger ones which are around a meter?

Even till now, the biggest living creature it controlled was a toad the size of a palm!

It’s because...!

He squinted his eyes and a thought struck him. It’s because this corpse is already dead. Even though there is lingering vitality in its blood, the blood does not have sufficient energy. Thus, it can only control those smaller creatures like ants and mosquitoes. Perhaps the creatures it controlled have grown stronger recently and thus it is now able to control toads!

In reality, this corpse does not possess any combat capacity. It instructed some of the creatures to go search for fresh blood required for its revival while leaving behind the strongest creatures to protect itself from being discovered by other living creatures. Once it is discovered, the chances of it reviving would be close to zero!

At the thought of this, Wang Xian’s eyes beamed.

This was an existence with a bloodline that ranked in the upper echelons throughout the universe. It was also a horrifying existence that could match a divine dragon. The corpse before Wang Xian currently was a huge trove of treasure!

Wang Xian’s eyes were beaming. From this corpse, he gradually emitted the might and aura of a divine dragon.

Psst!

Croak!

At this instant, those Level 11 mutated creatures that were surrounding the corpse noticed Wang Xian and stared at him immediately. Their gazes were cold without any emotions.

Roar!

A soft growl of the dragon emanated suddenly.

Splash!

A five-colored divine dragon appeared in the Yellow River.

This location was just slightly over ten meters deep. For Wang Xian’s huge body that spanned approximately seven meters, it was just like a small pond.

Croak!

Buzz Buzz Buzz!

Just as Wang Xian turned into a divine dragon, those twenty-odd formidable mutated creatures charged towards Wang Xian without hesitation.

These creatures couldn’t feel the slightest fear or pain. They opened their mouths, revealed their sharp teeth and attempted to sink these teeth into Wang Xian.

Their speed was astonishingly fast and the sharpness of their teeth was comparable to Level 9 weapons.

“Die!”

Wang Xian saw twenty-odd creatures charging towards him and swung his razor-sharp claws at them in response.

Sss sss sss!

Horrifying and densely packed streams of Metal attribute energies instantly covered an area of over ten meters before him.

Boom Boom!

Horrifying clashes rang! These mutated creatures did not have any elemental attributes. However, they did have incomparably tough defenses.

Unfortunately for them, they were facing Wang Xian this time. Wang Xian’s current strength level could match a Level 12 creature!

Razor-sharp streams of Metal energies fell on more than ten creatures, leaving behind long wounds.

Even the sharpness of the Inborn Spiritual Weapon, Zhan Lu, couldn’t match the dragon claws of Wang Xian

As the pinnacle existence in the entire universe, the toughness of the body of the divine dragon would be among the top three. Together with their elemental attribute attacks, they remained the pinnacle of all existences in the universe.

“Divine Dragon Tail Whip!”

Wang Xian controlled his tail and swept towards the mutated creatures.

Boom boom!

Sounds of explosions propagated throughout the surrounding area spanning ten kilometers.

“What’s that sound?”

“What’s that sound? I faintly heard a roar!”

“Is there any explosion in the vicinity?”

At the temporary base four kilometers away from the Yellow River, the experts and Miracle Doctors walked out of the tent and exclaimed in shock.

Croak croak croak!

Buzz buzz buzz!

Sss sss sss!

At this instant, a deafening sound that sent chills down their spines rang loudly. Everyone could hear it clearly.

“What? What is that sound?”

“It must be from the mutated creatures. The deep croak was from the mutated toad. However, it’s more terrifying than the one we heard in the day!”

“The other sounds were from the mutated mosquitoes and leeches. Oh gosh! What happened?”

Hearing the deafening and rapid cries of these creatures, the group of Inborn Experts was startled.

Ka ka ka!

At this moment, all the lights in the temporary base lit up, illuminating the surroundings and turning it as bright as the day.

The soldiers walked out of their tents and the middle-aged man in military uniform leapt onto biggest tent and stared in the direction of the Yellow River.

The group of Inborn experts exchanged glances before levitating into the air and looking in the direction of the Yellow River.

Boom!

At this instant, they heard a loud explosion that resembled something smashing onto the surface of the river.

Roar!

A frightening roar erupted once again. Looking from afar, they could vaguely see a huge tail sweeping forward.

“What a terrifying aura. I could even feel the threat of death from this distance!”

“What’s happening at the Yellow River to cause such horrifying explosions? Moreover... What kind of creature is making that frightening roar?

The group of Inborn Experts widened their eyes as they looked in the direction of the Yellow River in shock.

Feeling the dominating powers, their hearts were filled with horror.

“There is a powerful creature fighting there. It’s so strong that it appears unbelievable!”

The middle-aged man in military uniform stared in that direction and his body was shivering a little in awe.

The cries of the mutated creatures and the mighty roar of the powerful existence had both frightened the group.

They were no match for the creatures in the Yellow River.

“Fight?”

The crowd swallowed their saliva. It was especially so for those who had not reached the Inborn Realm. Every sound that came from there filled them with horror.

They were certain that if they were any closer, they couldn’t even stand.

To them, the creatures there were equivalent to gods and demons.

“Could it be that the creature that caused the mutation is fighting other living creatures?” the surrounding crowd conjectured.

At this very moment, Wang Xian, who was in the Yellow River, released a green dragon ball from his mouth.

The surrounding seagrass grew rapidly to the thickness of a human’s arm with thorns. Subsequently, these seagrasses wrapped towards all the mutated creatures.

Wang Xian extended his dragon claws and gripped the Level 11 Cadaveric Toad tightly.

Bam!

The Cadaveric Toad was squashed into a heap of flesh instantly. Despite having an incredible defense, it was still killed instantly.

Around Wang Xian, the mutated creatures were all trapped by the thorny seagrasses. The creatures struggled vigorously and were starting to break out of the hold of these seagrasses.

“Just a group of meager Level 11 creatures! Die!”

Wang Xian looked up and opened his mouth widely as the river waters retreated quickly from Wang Xian.

Lava-like flames shrouded towards and covered these mutated creatures. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com
