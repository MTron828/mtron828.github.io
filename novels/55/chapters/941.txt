Lin Feng shook his head with a face full of fear and walked towards the Lin family mansion in a daze.

He wanted to report this matter to the two remaining experts in the family.

If this matter was not resolved, then the Lin family would not have the strength to resist the following assassination.

In fact, all of them might even die.

Time slowly passed. In the morning, the news of the assassination of the Lin family’s old master, the strongest expert of the Lin family, spread throughout the entire bridge forest town.

When everyone received the news, their eyes widened and their faces revealed shock.

However, not long after, an even more shocking news spread.

The Lin family’s old master was not the only one who died. The president of the Bridge Forest Business Association was also killed. Five transcendents at level six were assassinated, and thirteen transcendents at level five were also killed by dragon spike.

Everyone’s faces were filled with shock. F * ck, so many experts had died. More than half of the Lin family’s forces had been killed.

Now, only two level 7 transcendents were guarding the Lin family.

So many experts had died in the Lin family, causing everyone to be shocked by the terror of the Dragon Spike Assassin organization.

This made many people recall the contact information they had obtained last night.

When they had obtained the contact information of the Dragon Assassin organization, they had not taken it to heart. Now, it seemed that the dragon assassin organization was simply a great killing tool.

In bridge forest town, there was no character that they could not assassinate. Even the mayor could be assassinated.

This made many people moved.

It was not that there was no assassin organization in Bridge Forest Town. The undercurrent assassin organization covered the entire star-moon kingdom.

However, the assassins of the undercurrent might not necessarily accept missions to assassinate level 8 transcendents.

The undercurrent did not have so many top-notch experts to accept such missions.

The failure rate of assassinating a level 8 transcendent was already very high.

If they failed, the assassin organization would at most return half of the commission.

However, if they failed too many times, then no one would hire assassins from the undercurrent in the future.

The reputation of the undercurrent would also suffer a huge blow. At that time, no one would hire assassins from the undercurrent, and the undercurrent would gradually decline.

Therefore, the undercurrent assassin organization was also very cautious when choosing missions.

Big families like the Lin family of Qiulin town had a protective array. They did not dare to accept such missions because they were afraid that the mission would fail and destroy their reputation.

However, the dragon Spike dared to accept it and even succeeded in assassinating them.

This made many people’s hearts move. If they hired the dragon spike to kill their enemies...

“The Lin family has always been tyrannical. Now that the old master of the Lin family has been killed, the Lin family only has two transcendent seventh rank experts. We might as well hire the dragon Spike to kill them!”

“F * ck, let’s assassinate one first. Qiulin town, the Lin family has many enemies. There are definitely many people who won’t let go of this opportunity. Besides us, there are at least one or two other families who won’t be able to resist taking Action!”

“Haha, the Lin family is finished this time. I didn’t expect that Immortal Phoenix mercenary group from holy sea town to be such a ruthless person. They spent at least hundreds of millions of middle-grade spirit stones. TSK tsk, they’re really rich!”

In a luxurious courtyard, five or six people were sitting in a room and chatting in a low voice. Their eyes revealed an excited look.

It wasn’t just here. In Qiao Lin Town, in many places, some mercenary groups and some families were preparing to make a move against the Lin family.

The Lin family was in Qiao Lin Town. They relied on their relationship with the mayor to act tyrannically and provoked many enemies.

However, having such an opportunity made many people extremely excited.

They quickly contacted the Dragon Assassin organization to assassinate the members of the Lin family.

“Dragon King!”

After eating some food in the restaurant, Wang Xian returned to his room. Long Yi immediately walked over.

“HMM, you have a mission?”

Wang Xian asked with a smile.

“Dragon King, things have really gone beyond our expectations!”

Long Yi handed the mission to Wang Xian and said in surprise.

“Oh? What’s Wrong?”

Wang Xian took over the mission list one by one and revealed a look of surprise.

“There are actually ten missions to assassinate the Lin family. Even a young master of the Lin family who is at level one extraordinary is willing to pay five times the commission to assassinate him. TSK TSK!”

Wang Xian looked at the mission list in shock.

“That’s right. Two level seven extraordinaire experts of the Lin family are also on the mission list. The people of Qiao Lin Town are really crazy!”

Long Yi said in shock.

In shenghai town, no one issued any missions to assassinate a level seven extraordinaire. In the end, there were two missions to assassinate a level seven extraordinaire in Qiao Lin Town. It was a little crazy.

One had to know that the reward for assassinating a level seven supernatural being was extremely terrifying!

“It’s not that they are crazy. It’s just that the Lin family has provoked too many people. Many people wish for them to die!”

Wang Xian mumbled to himself. Thinking of the old lady who sold funerary goods, he sighed slightly.

His eyes sparkled, after hesitating for a moment, he said, “Long Yi, activate rewards for good and punishment for evil. In the future, the Dragon Assassin organization will activate the crowdfunding mode to assassinate the most vicious and evil people. After the target has been investigated by the Dragon Assassin, they will assassinate them at half price!”

Activate rewards for good and punishment for evil!

The Dragon Assassin organization would not assassinate those who were extremely good.

The leader of the Dragon Assassin organization would assassinate those who were extremely vicious. Crowdfunding assassinations would be assassinated at half price.

If the other party was an extremely evil person with a higher cultivation level, everyone would be able to raise crowdfunding and assassinate him at half price.

This would be another rule of the dragon assassin organization.

It was also one of Wang Xian’s original intentions.

The Dragon Assassin organization was not a good organization. They killed people!

However, the dragon assassin organization would mainly kill evil people. They would not kill the good people!

It was directed at their original intentions!

Long Xian was stunned for a moment before he nodded immediately. “It’s the Dragon King. We will pass this news to all the customers immediately!”

“Okay!”

Wang Xian nodded his head. After this rule was activated, it might reduce the income of the dragon assassin organization. However, he felt very comfortable doing so!

“...”.

“Master Lin, you must protect our Lin family. You must restrain that lawless organization of the dragon Spike!”

At this moment, the remaining two extraordinary level seven experts of the Lin family and the core members of the Lin family were standing in front of an old man with a horrified expression.

The old man had a frail figure and a sinister look flashed across his eyes from time to time. He sat in the middle and stared at the members of the Lin family. He frowned slightly!

“This dragon Spike actually assassinated brother Lin!”

The old man gently knocked on the table, his eyes shining.

“Lord Lin, it’s the Dragon Assassin hired by the Immortal Phoenix mercenary group. Our Lin family can’t not take revenge. We want to kill that Kid First!”

The two old men standing at the front had ferocious expressions, and they gritted their teeth. “Lord Lin, if our Lin family can get through this, we are willing to follow you in the future!”

“Oh?”

The elder suddenly stood up as a glint flashed across his eyes.

Following him meant that his Lin family would become his people. Not to mention the Lin family’s resources and heritage, just these two remaining experts of the Lin family were enough to tempt him!

“Alright, an assassin organization wouldn’t dare to assassinate an official of the kingdom. With me around, an assassin organization wouldn’t dare to be impudent!”F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com
