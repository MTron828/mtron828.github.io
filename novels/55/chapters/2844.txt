2845 2845. Who’s going to guide who?

“It’s alright. Show me what you’ve got. Let Me See!”

When Wang Xian heard the lady’s words, the corner of his mouth could not help but Twitch.

Show her the wind attribute?

Wang Xian relied on the holy feather to possess the energy of the wind attribute. However, due to the restriction of the Holy Feather, his wind attribute strength was very weak.

He only possessed the offensive strength of a Level 2 immortal king.

However, if they were to really fight, Wang Xian could rely on his understanding of the wind attribute to fight against those of a higher level.

However, even if he was able to deal with a level 3 immortal king, he was still a rookie in his eyes. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Now, even the weakest person in the Dragon Palace possessed such strength.

“This… Alright!”

Wang Xian also knew the lady’s goodwill. The corner of his mouth curled up slightly as his eyes sparkled. With a wave of his arm, a small tornado appeared in his hand.

The tornado spun freely in front of him. With a thought, he could easily change the direction of the tornado.

“Huh?”

The lady was slightly stunned when she saw Wang Xian’s control over the wind. A look of surprise appeared on her face.

“Use your strongest attack to attack me.”

The lady’s expression changed slightly as she said to Wang Xian.

“The strongest attack of the wind attribute?”

Wang Xian pursed his lips and asked.

“Yes, attack me.”

The woman nodded her head. She didn’t notice the other meaning behind his words.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian smiled and waved his arm. A green gourd was formed.

Buzz

The next moment, a green flying sword flew out from within and attacked the woman instantly.

The lady stared at the Cyan Gourd and the flying sword. Her eyes were glowing.

She could not help but shout softly. Her eyes were filled with shock.

Bam

She stretched out her palm and caught the flying sword easily.

“Huh?”

However, she frowned and looked at Wang Xian very quickly.

“Use your strongest attack. Don’t worry, you can’t hurt me.”

The Lady said.

“This is indeed the strongest attack of the wind attribute that I have mastered so far.”

Wang Xian smiled and said.

“Strongest attack? I can sense that you have the strength of a level 6 immortal king. Why do you only have this little attack?”

The lady frowned.

“This is already the strongest attack.”

Wang Xian said again. Wind attribute. This was indeed his strongest attack.

This attack was a simulation of the immortal slaying calabash.

This attack could allow him to fight against opponents of a higher level.

The lady raised her eyebrows and looked at Wang Xian. She felt that he was a little mysterious.

He didn’t even agree to take him in as a disciple with his strength at the peak of Godly King realm. Furthermore, he was able to obtain the level 9 immortal King Level Wind Jade and the mystical treasure feather.

His entire body was emitting a mysterious color.

“This green gourd of yours and your control over the wind attribute is unprecedented. You are a natural-born Skywalker.”

She didn’t pursue the matter with Wang Xian. Her gaze landed on the green gourd as she said with a face full of astonishment.

“Yes!”

Wang Xian nodded his head.

What a joke. Although he didn’t control the wind attribute through the incipient saint wings, he had the inheritance of the wind god Dragon and possessed the immortal slaying gourd that could unleash an attack at the level of the godly monarch realm.

Now, there were already four wind attribute immortal-slaying swords in the immortal-slaying calabash. When all of them were unleashed, even a first level divine emperor would have to dodge in fear.

It was no exaggeration to say that his understanding of the wind attribute was even higher than the lady in front of him.

“This move is the strongest one that I am currently in control of. I call it the immortal-slaying calabash.”

Wang Xian said as he looked at the lady in front of him. He pursed his lips and prepared to educate her.

Of course, this was meant to educate her.

“In this gourd of mine, there is a vacuum world. When I opened the gourd, I used the wind attribute laws to condense a sword. I also used the wind attribute laws to block the exit

“When I controlled the flying sword to fly out, I also began to squeeze the immortal-slaying gourd and unleashed a terrifying attack!”

Wang Xian said faintly.

This kind of attack method was similar to the vacuum cannon.

It sounded simple, but it was very difficult to control.

This was a test of one’s control over the wind attribute.

With Wang Xian’s control ability at the level of celestial thearch, it was very easy.

“The Celestial Thearch’s Abhijna should be similar to this. It covers an area and condenses a terrifying attack within an area, which is also an abhijna.”

“Of course, this is too complicated. It’s impossible to comprehend it with just a few words. You have to rely on yourself.”

Wang Xian looked at her and said faintly.

As he spoke, he slowly condensed an immortal slaying calabash, a transparent immortal slaying calabash.

From the outside, one could see the changes within the immortal slaying calabash.

Breaking through a major realm had a powerful shackle.

This was not something that could be comprehended with just a few words.

However, Wang Xian possessed the inheritance of the wind god Dragon. This was akin to the top existence in the universe teaching a godly king to make a breakthrough.

Was It Easy?

Easy!

The reason why those powerful races could cultivate to the peak was firstly because of the resources and secondly because of the inheritance.

The inheritance was equivalent to the guidance of a teacher.

The lady watched as Wang Xian transformed into the immortal slaying calabash in front of her. Her body trembled and a shocked expression appeared on her face.

“Hehe!”

He smiled gently and turned around to walk into the house.

The immortal slaying calabash that was condensed from the wind attribute floated there. After more than ten minutes, it slowly dissipated.

However, even though the immortal slaying calabash had dissipated, she still stood there motionlessly.

“You still want to guide me? Hehe, I’m the one guiding you, right?”

Wang Xian smiled.

As for guiding her in her cultivation, it was because Wang Xian had a good impression of her.

When he revealed the powerful treasures, she didn’t show any signs of greed. She had a good temperament.

She still wanted to guide and help him.

In that case, he might as well help her.

All the causes and consequences were caused by this woman herself.

Good cause, good result!

“The windless day will be in five days. There will be many powerhouses coming over from the windless forest. It’s time to make preparations.”

“We’ll have to let the Heaven Array and the others come over!”

Wang Xian mumbled.

According to his understanding during this period of time, the windless day was considered an important day in the eight desolates and six harmonies.

Every time there was a windless day, many divine emperors would enter.

Even if they were not wind attribute cultivators, they would still enter to search for treasures.

Even if they could not use them, they could still sell them!

As for wind attribute cultivators, there would be even more of them.

When that time came, the windless forest would be a grand feast.

Wang Xian naturally had to make preparations. When that time came, he would bring along the eight-headed demon Ao Yao of the Heaven Array. Even if he encountered other powerful factions, he would be able to meet them.

This time, Wang Xian had to obtain the sacred feather of the incipient holy wings.

Whoever dared to fight with him would be his enemy.

He had to be prepared for a big battle.

He had to obtain it!
