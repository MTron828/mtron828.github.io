Chapter 1430: Under the Alliance of 1430

“Sixth level of the Void Interpretation Stage!”

“This... this... !”

In the Imperial Study Room of the Guanglong Palace, the king of the Guanglong Kingdom and a few top-notch experts of the Guanglong Kingdom were sitting in the imperial study room.

Everyone was looking at Wang Xian and the other two people who were sitting in a row in shock.

Even Long Xiaotian, who was sitting at the side, widened his eyes.

“King of the Guanglong Kingdom, everyone is very clear about the matter of your eighth son. It’s not that I want to say it, but you have to bear the consequences if you make a huge mistake!”

“Your second son has such a good relationship with young master Wang. Hehe, everyone knows the world of the strong!”

Sect Master Yi said to the king of the Light Dragon Kingdom with a smile on his face.

The faces of the people of the Light Dragon Kingdom changed slightly.

It was the most ruthless imperial family!

Take Long Xiaotian and his brothers for example. There was not much brotherly love between them.

After all, they were not born from the same mother. Instead, they competed for the throne.

The death of the eighth prince did not matter much to the other princes.

On the other hand, it was impossible to say that the dozens of sons of the Guanglong Kingdom were very close to each of them.

The dynasty was bigger than those princes.

Furthermore, there was the relationship between Long Xiaotian and Wang Xian.

Wang Xian was a powerhouse at level six of the Seethrough realm!

There were only benefits and no bad things in forming an alliance.

“If the heavenly sword sect agrees, we will agree!”

The king of the Kingdom of Light Dragon said with a twinkle in his eyes.

“Alright. If young master Wang wants to negotiate with the Kingdom of light dragon, it will be easier!”

Chief Yi said with a smile on his face.

The king of the Kingdom of Light Dragon looked at Wang Xian and took a deep breath. “If we can form an alliance this time, we will let bygones be bygones!”

“Don’t worry, Long Xiaotian is my brother!”

Wang Xian smiled faintly.

“Okay!”

The king of the Kingdom of light dragon nodded and squeezed out a smile.

He also knew that his second son had a very good relationship with Wang Xian. If not for his eighth son angering him, it would be the best for the Kingdom of Light Dragon to have an ally at level six of the Seethrough realm!

“In that case, King of the Light Dragon Empire, do you want to go to the Heaven Sword sect with us?”

Sect Master Yi said with a smile.

“Alright!”

The King of the Light Dragon Empire hesitated for a moment before nodding his head.

“Time is of the essence. Let’s set off now!”

Feng Luan said directly.

The group headed outside and flew towards the Heaven Sword sect.

Compared to the Light Dragon dynasty, when they came to the sky sword sect, their treatment was completely different from that of the Light Dragon dynasty.

“I didn’t expect young master Wang to actually come to our sky sword sect. Hehe, let’s go and inform the young Miss!”

An elder floated in the sky and cupped his hands towards Wang Xian as he said with a smile.

“Didn’t expect it? People who don’t know about this treatment would think that he’s the son-in-law of the Sky Sword sect!”

Feng Luan watched from the side and said mockingly.

“Ahem, Elder, beside me is the Queen of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire, the King of the Light Dragon Empire, and the sect master of the Blood Stream sect. We are here to talk to your sect master about something important!”

Wang Xian coughed and explained his purpose of coming here in an awkward manner.

“Oh? Our sect master?”

“Let young master Wang and the rest come up!”

As the elder of the Heavenly Sword sect spoke, a voice came from the peak of the Heavenly Sword Mountain.

“Everyone, follow me!”

The elder of the Heavenly Sword sect gestured upwards.

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian nodded his head.

“Is this the Wang Xian that our young miss likes? A Supreme Heaven’s pride expert with terrifying strength at the fifth level of the void interpretation stage. Our young miss has good taste!”

“That’s right, that’s right. He is my idol, an invincible Heaven’s pride expert. Furthermore, back then, senior brother Ren Xingchen wanted to acknowledge him as his master but was rejected by him!”

“Senior brother Ren Xingchen seems to have been saved by him twice. I heard from senior brother that the reason why he is able to reach this stage today is all because of young master Wang Xian!”

“Our senior brother Ren Xingchen’s talent is also terrifying. In just a little over a year’s time, he has actually advanced to the second level of the Seethrough realm. How terrifying!”

At the bottom of the mountain, some disciples of the Heavenly Sword sect were discussing among themselves when they saw Wang Xian and the rest.

“Eh?”

When Wang Xian and the rest arrived at the peak of the Heavenly Sword Mountain, there was a middle-aged man and a young man standing on the peak.

The middle-aged man looked at Wang Xian in surprise and raised his eyebrows.

“Sir!”

Ren Xingchen, who was standing at the side, saw Wang Xian. He took two steps forward respectfully and shouted.

“I didn’t expect your strength to improve by quite a lot. My Daughter’s taste is really good!”

The middle-aged man looked at Wang Xian with a smile and said with a smile.

The corner of Wang Xian’s mouth twitched when he heard his words. “Sect leader Ling, we are here to discuss something with you!”

“Oh? What is it? To think that the king of the Guanglong Kingdom, sect leader Yi, and the Queen of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire are here as well!”

Sect leader Ling asked with a smile on his face.

“To form an alliance, sect leader Ling understands the strength of the blood stream sect, the Light Dragon Empire, and the Dragon and Phoenix Empire. In addition, sect leader Ling, you and young master Wang are both at level six of the void interpretation stage. Let’s form an alliance!”

“To deal with the upcoming changes!”

Sect leader Yi looked at sect leader Ling and said seriously.

“HMM? Sixth level of the Void Interpretation Stage? You’ve reached this stage?”

Sect Master Ling was slightly shocked as he stared at Wang Xian and asked.

Wang Xian nodded with a smile.

“Alright, let’s talk inside!”

Sect Master Ling didn’t hesitate much and nodded directly. He brought them to a room.

The demonic beasts wanted to establish a dynasty!

The order for the blood flow empire had been issued!

Following that, the storm in the blood flow region was about to erupt.

In this kind of change, there might be a terrifying war.

Even the Heaven Sword sect couldn’t guarantee that they would be able to survive this crisis alone.

Now that they could form an alliance, it was the best choice.

This way, in the next wave, they would be able to grasp the direction.

They wouldn’t be forced to obey a single order from the blood flow empire. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Feng Luan, forget about the blood flow empire. How long do you think it will take for you to rule the entire Liuhai Region?”

After spending five hours to discuss everything, everyone left.

Wang Xian and Feng Luan flew towards the dragon-phoenix Empire as he asked slowly.

“HMM? Forget about the blood flow empire? The sect master of the Heaven Sword sect is very strong. He’s at level six of the Seethrough realm. They’re a sect, so there’s not much of a hindrance!”

“The Light Dragon Empire and the boundless sea empire are not weak. If I can break through to the sixth level of the void interpretation realm and have another person at the sixth level of the void interpretation realm, it should be enough. Why? Why are you asking about this?”

Feng Luan looked at him in puzzlement.

“If you can achieve it, I will help you deal with the blood flow empire!”

Wang Xian said to Feng Luan mysteriously.

“You...”

Feng Luan was slightly taken aback before she smiled bitterly.

“I thought my current development speed was fast enough. I didn’t expect that I couldn’t keep up with your pace!”

“Let me think of a way. I will try my best to possess such strength within a year!”

As she spoke, she took a glance at Wang Xian and smiled happily!
