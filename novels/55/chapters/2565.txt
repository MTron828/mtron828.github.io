2566 The Battle of 2566 was about to begin

“Don’t drag us down if you want to die, the ninth rank celestial sect is already here to destroy you. Hurry up, I want my money back!”

“That’s right, why did you provoke the ninth rank celestial sect for no reason? Hurry up and leave. If you don’t leave, you won’t even know how you died!”

“Give us our money back, give us our money back!”

“F * ck, I bought a house here yesterday, this motherf * cking big loss, take advantage of the ninth rank celestial sect has not come, quickly give us money back!”

Inside the Dragon Star, when everyone knew that the ninth-rank sky sect was coming to attack the Dragon Palace, the entire dragon star tens of billions of customers completely panicked!

The power of the ninth-grade celestial sect has been deeply embedded in the hearts of everyone in the southern star system. Although the Dragon Palace and the tiger chaotic demon kingdom are also very strong, but after all, they have just risen!

Judging from the strength they displayed now, they were much stronger than the Dragon Palace and the chaotic Tiger Demon Kingdom!

Now that the ninth-grade celestial sect was attacking them, how could they not panic?

“How dare you!”The people who were buying houses in the Dragon Star and paying for the divine stones in the training grounds protested loudly!

The entire dragon star instantly became flustered!

“After this, the status of the dragon star should be able to be completely stabilized!”

Wang Xian stood on the planet in the sky and looked down at the dragon star below. Looking at the scene, he said calmly!

Many customers were protesting. There were also many people who were escaping out through the teleportation formation!

No one thought that the dragon palace and the chaotic demon kingdom would be able to withstand the attack of the ninth-grade heaven sect!

Almost everyone was certain that the ninth-grade heaven sect would definitely destroy the entire Dragon Star!

This caused tens of billions of people to walk out in Panic!

Those who spent divine stones in the training ground demanded divine stones of retreat. Those who bought houses and rented shops in the Dragon Star wanted divine stones of retreat from the Dragon Palace, but they stopped buying and renting!

The entire Dragon Star was slightly chaotic!

“Everyone, don’t worry. Our Dragon Star is absolutely safe. Don’t Worry!”

At this moment, an expert from the chaotic tiger demon country spoke from below!

“Safe? Safe my ass. Don’t you know the strength of a ninth-grade sky sect? It’s useless to say so much now. Refund the money!”

An angry undying shouted directly!

“Withdraw the god Stone, immediately withdraw the god Stone!”

Everyone around shouted loudly!

“Anyone who wants to withdraw the god stone, give them a refund. You can also return the houses you bought!”

At this moment, Wang Xian’s voice reverberated throughout the entire Dragon Star!

“That’s more like it. Hurry up, we don’t want to die with you guys!”

Some people heaved a sigh of relief and hurried him!

“Hehe!”

Wang Xian looked down at the scenes of the Dragon Star and a smile appeared on his face!

This time, he would return all the divine stones. After today’s battle, the Dragon Palace would be able to sell them for two to three times the price!

“The billions of people on Dragon Star have all escaped!”

“Not only did they escape, they even asked the Dragon Palace and the Tiger Demon Nation to withdraw the god stones. Now, they have withdrawn all the god Stones!”

“Dragon Star is doomed. They thought that they would be able to rise again, but the Dragon Palace and the Tiger Demon Nation are simply courting death!”

What happened on Dragon Star caused quite a stir in the AI!

After all, tens of billions of people had escaped from Dragon Star, which had caused quite a stir!

The entire star South Galaxy was paying attention to the following battle!

“How much longer until we reach Dragon Star!”

At this moment, in the starry sky of the universe, fifteen space battleships were shuttling through the starry sky!

In the battleship at the front, the ninth grade sky sect’s sect master asked with a cold face!

“Reporting to the sect master, we will reach the front of the Dragon Star in an hour!”

An elder immediately reported!

“There is one more thing to do after we destroy the Dragon Palace and the tiger turmoil demon kingdom. Let’s see if we can get the training field on the Dragon Star. I heard that the training field is very powerful!” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

A patriarch of the ninth-grade heaven sect said indifferently from the side!

“Indeed. Some disciples went there to investigate, but it seems to be a formation set up there. It’s very difficult to replicate!”

The Patriarch of the ninth-grade celestial sect said faintly!

“A formation? Then it won’t be easy to replicate. When the time comes, let’s just destroy the Dragon Star!”

The Patriarch of the ninth-grade celestial sect said flatly!

...

“Prime Minister Gui, are the people from the commercial planet of the ninth-grade celestial sect ready?”

At the same time, on the planet above Long Xing, Wang Xian looked at Prime Minister Gui and asked!

“Dragon King, they are ready!”

Prime Minister Gui said with a smile!

...

“That’s good. When they make their move, give the order immediately!”

The corners of Wang Xian’s mouth curled up slightly. He looked at the void in front of him and waited for the arrival of the ninth-grade heaven sect!

Fifty-five minutes later, there was no one else on dragon star other than the people from the Dragon Palace and the chaotic Tiger Demon Kingdom!

All the customers had fled to other planets. Only a few godly kings with great skills and courage were in the surrounding void. They wanted to watch this battle!

“Dragon King, we have detected the other party. They will arrive in five minutes!”

At this moment, Heaven Array walked over with a formation compass in his hand and said to Wang Xian!

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded and waited slowly!

Boom! Boom! Boom

Four minutes later, 300,000 members of the Dragon Palace stood at the back. With a glance, the number of immortal king powerhouses had reached 500!

At the side, nearly 300 powerhouses from the chaotic Tiger Demon Nation stood at the side and stared coldly ahead!

...

Boom! Boom! Boom

“Lock onto the planet in front!”

“Scan the opponent’s strength!”

“803 immortal god King Experts!”

“Scanning the fluctuation of the formation, insufficient data!”

In the void, 15 starships whizzed over and entered the line of sight of Wang Xian and the rest!

At the same time, mechanical voices were heard from the starships!

“Hehe, 800 immortal God kings, no wonder they dare to provoke us!”

The ninth grade Sky sect leader and the group of warriors stood up, looking through the transparent metal in front of them, staring at a planet in front of them!

They looked at the million troops above, their eyes filled with killing intent!

“Bombard them directly, master, let’s use a heavenly thunder net!”

The ninth grade sky sect leader said coldly, looking at the elder beside him and saying!

“Haha, Good, Good!”

The ninth grade sky sect’s patriarch nodded!

“Weng!”

In front of them, a pillar covered with lightning appeared. The pillar was half a meter thick, and it contained an incomparably terrifying power of lightning!

The ninth grade sky sect’s sect master and Patriarch placed their arms directly on it!

“Ka Ka Ka!”

In the sky, a passageway opened up, and the heavenly lightning pillar extended upwards!

In the surroundings, the fifteen starships lined up in a row, and terrifying cannon barrels opened up one after another!

“Two newly risen powers actually dare to provoke our ninth grade sky sect. Today, I’ll make you become stray dogs!”

The ninth grade Sky Sect’s sect master roared with a sinister face!

Waves of terrifying lightning power spread from his palm to the sky, and an incomparably empty lightning bolt shot into the void for millions of kilometers!
