Translator: 549690339

“Hiss, what is this?”

“What? There’s actually a huge and majestic dragon palace at the bottom of the sea that is thousands of meters deep!”

“Oh my God, this is too shocking. The Dragon Palace below is so majestic and magnificent!”

“It’s too beautiful. The bride is simply a princess who walked out from the bottom of the sea!”

Everyone looked at Wang Xian as he held Xiao Yu’s hand and walked out from the Dragon Palace that was thousands of meters deep. All of them had shocked expressions on their faces.

They were shocked by the majestic and magnificent dragon palace at the bottom of the sea.

They walked out from the deep sea all the way to the surroundings of the floating island.

Wang Xian looked at Feng Lingtian who was waiting by the side of the island and slowly handed Xiao Yu’s hand to him.

His eldest brother was like a father. At this moment, Wang Xian felt like he was marrying his daughter.

“Dragon King, I will treat Xiao Yu well for the rest of my life!”

Feng Lingtian said with a serious expression.

Wang Xian patted his shoulder and smiled. He nodded his head faintly and said, “Okay!”

He didn’t say too much, but Wang Xian was thinking that if he didn’t treat Xiao Yu well, he would kill him in the future.

Of course, he couldn’t say such words on this occasion.

Moreover, based on Xiao Yu’s character, Feng Lingtian was at the level of a little puppy. He wouldn’t be able to stir up any waves.

“Let’s go on Stage!”

Wang Xian smiled at them and said.

“Okay!”

Xiao Yu looked at her brother. Her eyes were filled with happiness, disappointment, and happiness.

The two of them walked forward. At this moment, the surroundings were filled with music.

Around the floating island, hundreds of dolphins leaped into the air. A melodious sound came from them.

When the sound covered the entire island, everyone actually felt happy, and a sense of joy surged from their hearts.

This made the immortals slightly shocked, and their faces revealed a shocked expression. They could not help but clap.

Marriage, marriage!

“I grew up with my brother, living in a small town and living a poor life. In high school, it was my brother who worked and supported me. It was my brother who protected me time and time again. My elder brother is like a father. In My Heart, my brother is my elder brother and also my father!”

“I’m very glad that I have a brother who loves me so much. Without my brother, I wouldn’t be where I am now...”

The wedding ended with Xiao Yu’s speech. After lunch, they had to send Xiao Yu off.

Xiao Yu was finally married. The wedding was held next to the Dragon Palace, but she still had to return to her new home.

“Brother!”

Sitting on a bridal sedan chair, Xiao Yu wiped her tears and waved at Wang Xian!

“MMM, you’ll be a big girl in the future. Don’t Cry Anymore!”

Wang Xian waved his hand and said with a smile.

“MMM, I’ll bring Ling Tian over in two days and stay in the Dragon Palace for a period of time!”

Xiao Yu waved her hand and said.

“Alright!” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Wang Xian nodded his head.

“Let’s Go!”

Ling Xiao said to the people from the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect beside him.

The group immediately flew into the sky.

“Eldest princess, let’s Go!”

Nine Dragons flew down from the sky and rode on the sedan. They flew into the sky and flew towards the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect.

“Little sister Xiao Yu is married off. It can be considered as settling one of Your Worries!”

Guan Shuqing and the other girls came to Wang Xian’s side and said to him with a smile.

“That’s right. My younger sister is married. This is considered a major event. I plan to head to the transcendence continent in half a month!”

Wang Xian looked at the girls and said to them.

“Yes, you can go. But you have to come back as soon as possible. We are waiting for you at the Dragon Palace!”

Lan Qingyue and the rest nodded their heads.

“Don’t worry. I will be able to gain a firm foothold in the transcendence continent soon. When the time comes, I will bring all of you there. It will be tough on all of you during this period of time!”

Wang Xian nodded his head heavily.

“After you leave, we will also have to cultivate well. There is no sun or moon in our cultivation. One retreat might last for a few months, so it’s not a big deal!”

As Guan Shuqing spoke, she suddenly thought of something. “Oh right, see if you can find sister Feng Luan. If there’s a chance in the future, we will look for her!”

“Yes, Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded his head and looked to the east. His sister’s figure had already disappeared.

This caused a faint smile to appear on his face.

At the same time, around the world, the members of the Dragon Palace, with the cooperation of the immortals and deities from various places, began to provide relief to the poor.

Food, drinks, accommodation.

Resettlement work! Resettlement accommodation.

With the assistance of the local immortals and deities, everything went smoothly.

This made all the poor people in the world extremely grateful. Many people even built the Dragon King Temple.

They built the Dragon King statue and worshiped it.

They treated it as a living God, a true God, and the faith in their hearts.

It was not the so-called immortals and deities.

Guan Shuqing and the rest read the information one by one and showed it to Wang Xian.

He smiled slightly. He used to be dependent on Xiao Yu. He knew the hardships. Now that he could help others, he had to help them more.

Now, he had the ability.

At this moment, at the Yellow Heaven Immortal Sect, nine giant flood dragons led the bride.

Everyone in the festive yellow heaven city was shocked.

“This powerful creature is even more powerful than the strongest of the major immortal sects!”

“This is the flood dragon that pulled the dragon chair for the Dragon King. It’s too powerful!”

“Our crown prince is really lucky to be able to marry the Dragon King’s sister. Everyone calls our crown prince a gigolo, Hehe!”

“Whoever marries the Dragon King’s sister will be a gigolo. It’s said that all the immortals and gods of the world will be present at this wedding!”

“That’s right. There are five to six hundred immortals present, but it’s said that there are at least four to five hundred immortals and gods in the Dragon Palace today. Moreover, the powerhouse who founded the Sacred Glory Empire was packing up in the Dragon Palace. With the Dragon King’s strength, he can rule the earth in a minute!”

When the crowd saw the arrival of the bride, the entire yellow heaven city burst into cheers.

It was the fortune of everyone in the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect that their crown prince could marry the Dragon King’s sister.

All the major media outlets in the world and all the big screens in the city were full of blessings for the wedding of the Dragon King’s sister.

Those who received help even began to pray, blessing the Dragon King and his relatives.

A wedding was a celebration for all!

Time passed slowly. Xiao Yu, who had stayed in the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect for a few days, brought Feng Lingtian back to the Dragon Palace and stayed there.

More than ten days later, Wang Xian moved the Dragon Palace to the passageway of the transcendence continent and sealed the entrance with the Dragon Palace.

Standing beside the entrance, Wang Xian looked at Xiao Yu, Guan Shuqing, Lan Qingyue, and the rest. A smile appeared on his face.

“I’m going over now. Wait for My Good News!”

“Xiao Xian, be careful. We’ll wait for You Here!”

“Don’t worry. Nothing will happen. You all know that!”

Wang Xian pointed at the position of the ancestral tree of the Dragon King Palace and said with a smile.

“Okay!”

The group of girls nodded. The main reason why they could let Wang Xian go to the other world without worry was that he could be revived through the ancestral tree.

Wang Xian turned his head slowly and looked at the passageway ahead.

The black passageway led to the other world.

He walked over slowly.

Transcendent continent, I’m Here!
