Chapter 558: The Name Of The Dragon King

Casual and carefree while taking off on his sword.

All the disciples around stared blankly at the leaving figure. Not a single one wasn’t impressed and surprised.

“Why haven’t I seen this Senior brother before? How did he just shoot up so suddenly?”

“He is definitely peerless below the Dan Realm. In fact, he might even be able to go toe-to-toe with a Dan Realm expert!”

“I’m certain that he has definitely reached the Dan Realm. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be that incredible.

Disciples from various mountain sects discussed fervently as they saw Wang Xian leaving.

“Mentor Du said that his attacks haven’t reached the Dan Realm. It is just that his swordsmanship and ability to control water are too insane!”

“Mt. Fengyu has really shot to fandom. He has carried the mountain sect on his shoulders alone and has contributed to the rise!”

The comments of the surrounding crowd slowly made their way to the ears of the twenty-odd disciples from Mt. Fengyu.

Their feelings were complicated. Some were agitated but most were exhilarated.

Now that Mt. Fengyu had risen from nineteenth to the eleventh, the resources allocated to them would increase three to four-fold.

Considering that Mt. Fengyu had few disciples, everyone would be able to get substantially more resources and they would also improve drastically.

Yu Ling’er stared at that figure blankly, feeling exceptionally conflicted.

Once, their Mt. Fengyu was also an incredibly strong mountain sect in Da Hong Immortal Sect. Her father was even the strongest existence on the ranking board of youths of various mountain sects.

He was the number one disciple of Da Hong Immortal Sect.

The glory days had since departed from Mt. Fengyu for over ten years. During these years, Mt. Fengyu had fallen to the bottom of the mountain sects.

Her mother was supporting Mt. Fengyu desperately.

She would have never expected the young man that fell from the waterfall, the one who gave her a scare and the one her mother took out precious elixir pills to save would be so incredibly strong.

I have been against him. He probably doesn’t have a good impression of me now. No! He hasn’t been looking into my eyes from the very beginning.

At the thought of this, Yu Ling’er felt bitter.

“Hey, brothers from Mt. Fengyu. What’s the name of this Senior brother? When did he join your Mt. Fengyu?”

At this moment, curious questions came from the surrounding disciples of various mountain sects.

Several hundred disciples, with the majority of them being even stronger than them, were staring at them.

“Wang Xian. Our Senior brother’s name is Wang Xian!”

“Wang Xian? Senior brother Wang Xian?”

The surrounding disciples mumbled to themselves as they etched this name into their minds. After this day, the name of Wang Xian would definitely be known throughout Da Hong Immortal Sect.

“He told us his name is Wang Xian and that others call him the Dragon King!” Yu Ling’er mumbled to herself.

“What? Junior sister Ling’er, what did you just say? His name is Dragon King?”

A disciple from Mt. Fengyu standing by the side was shocked as he looked at Yu Ling’er with doubts.

“Yeah!”

Yu Ling’er nodded her head.

“Dragon King... Haha! This name is truly domineering. The dragon king that creates clouds, casts rain and stirs waves on the surface of the seas. A really apt name!” a disciple from Mt. Fengyu exclaimed loudly.

“Dragon King? What a domineering name!”

The surrounding crowd and disciples were taken aback but exclaimed with a smile soon after.

“That’s a really domineering name! Dragon King! Dragon King!”

Wang Xian wasn’t aware that what he said casually when he first regained consciousness was now starting to spread throughout Da Hong Immortal Sect.

In Da Hong Immortal Sect, disciples would end their day of training after 5 pm.

All the disciples from various mountain sects could choose to head to the Martial Peak to spar with others. Alternatively, they could continue their practice.

They could also head to the Sword Cleansing Peak to sharpen their weapons, to the Pill Hill to purchase elixir pills, or even to the Scripture Depository to read books.

Whenever the evening arrived, the areas around the main peak would be exceptionally lively.

“Look! Mt. Fengyu’s ranking has increased by eight in a single day!”

“How can this...? How can Mt. Fengyu be ranked so highly? Last I recalled, weren’t they the second from the bottom? Their entire mountain sect only has twenty disciples!” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“It’s because of a disciple from Mt. Fengyu. He is extremely strong and defeated eight mountain sects alone. Today, disciples from six to seven sects witnessed with their own eyes how he challenged one mountain sect after another. He’s really strong!”

“A disciple defeated eight mountain sects in a single day? Could he have Dan Realm-level strength?”

“I’m not certain. Others are calling him the Dragon King. What a domineering name!”

“Dragon King? Who gave him the guts to call himself that? He’s arrogant!”

“He had the capital to do so! He defeated eight mountain sects on his own, including crushing five Half-step to Dan Realm disciples easily. These Half-step to Dan Realm disciples are all really strong and tough!”

The surrounding disciples around the main peak stared at the leaderboard vigilantly while discussing in awe.

The news of a single disciple from Mt. Fengyu defeating eight mountain sects alone quickly spread among various disciples.

Some were shocked while others were surprised. However, there were more who weren’t convinced.

“I heard that the Dragon King of Mt. Fengyu wanted to challenge the tenth-ranked Mt. Jiulian. However, it was getting late and thus he gave up on the idea. If he had not, I believe Mt. Fengyu would still be able to increase its ranking by several spots!”

“Yeah! The Dragon King is really strong. He definitely has the strength to go against Dan Realm disciples!”

Several disciples that had gone along to spectate in the afternoon looked at the leaderboard on the cliff as they exclaimed emotionally.

“He needs to at least be in the Dan Realm for him to challenge the tenth-ranked mountain sect. An insignificant disciple calling himself the Dragon King? What a joke!”

“How arrogant! There’s not a single supreme talent in the bottom ten mountain sects. There’s nothing to be proud of after defeating a pile of scraps!”

At this moment, several disciples walked over, glanced at the leaderboard and spoke with indignance.

Huh?

Several youths looked at the other disciples, frowned and remarked, “That’s because you guys haven’t witnessed the strength of the Dragon King. If you guys had, you wouldn’t be saying the same!”

“Dragon King? Who the hell is he? If he dares to challenge us, our Senior brother Su Fa will teach home a lesson so well that he will be humble. Calling himself the Dragon King? What a joke!” several disciples remarked in contempt.

They shook their heads and continued, “A disciple that rules over the bottom ten mountain sects will at most be capable of being a leader of a flock of chickens!”

Several disciples were full of indignance as they walked past them.

Some youths opened their mouths and wanted to say something but eventually chose not to.

Indeed, Senior brother Dragon King from Mt. Fengyu had not defeated a Dan Realm disciple.

And that Senior brother Su Fa...

They lifted their heads and looked at the leaderboard of youths in Da Hong Immortal Sect.

First: Hong Tianda! Budding Realm!

Second: Piao Lingxue! Budding Realm!

Third: Ao Shuwen! Budding Realm!

...

“The name of the Dragon King isn’t something he is qualified to be addressed as!”

“Tianyi Swordsman, Hong Tianda. Wandering Snow Sword, Piao Lingxue. Fengyun Sword, Ao Shuwen. All of them are in the Budding Realm. Moreover, all of them are ranked in the top twenty among the younger generation of disciples in Da Hong Immortal Sect!”

“He will only be considered as one of the most outstanding talents in Da Hong Immortal Sect after he gets into the top twenty. Before that, who the hell is the Dragon King!?”

While the crowd was in awe with the frantic advancement of Mt. Fengyu up the ranking charts, most of the disciples in the top ten mountain sect were nonchalant.

In their eyes, an eleventh ranked mountain wasn’t something that would impress them.

So what if he defeated eight mountain sects alone? Does he have the guts to challenge our mountain sect?

We will teach that Dragon King how to be humble!

Calling himself the Dragon King? Is he qualified to accept this title?
