“Hades Ghost Avatar, what a powerful Hades Ghost Avatar. Is this the Dragon King’s Hades Ghost Avatar?”

When Wang Xian arrived with Ming shasheng.

Ming Shasheng looked at the four Hades ghost avatars surrounding the demonic wings with a shocked expression on his face!

Hades ghost avatars were unique to their Hades race.

It was also because of Hades ghost avatars that their Hades race was able to rank among the top races in the universe!

However, what shocked him was that the Dragon King also possessed the Netherworld Ghost clone?

The Netherworld Ghost clone was not something that only the netherworld race could refine. There was also the possibility of experts from other races refining it!

However, the probability of this happening was very small. It was less than one in a million!

In addition, only experts with the darkness attribute could refine it!

The Dragon King could actually possess it?

“Hehe!”

Wang Xian smiled faintly. He looked at the demonic wings in front of him and said directly, “Surrender or die. Choose One!” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Oh no!”

The demonic wings had been suppressed all this while and had no ability to resist at all!

Now that he saw Wang Xian flying over, his expression changed drastically.

When he saw Ming Shasheng standing respectfully beside the Dragon King, his heart was filled with despair!

“Ming Shasheng, you actually submitted to the Dragon King.”

Demon wing stared at Ming Shasheng and said with an embarrassed expression.

“I’m willing to take out the innate supreme treasure to trade, and I’m also willing to take out some treasures to compensate!”

After he finished speaking, he looked at Wang Xian and continued speaking with a gloomy expression!

If he knew this would happen, he would have already taken out the innate supreme treasure to trade!

This Dragon King was too despicable!

Demonic Wings thought indignantly. When he saw Wang Xian looking at him mockingly, his expression changed slightly!

“I’ll give you five seconds to consider. Submit or Die!”

Wang Xian stared at him and gave him his final warning!

“Demonic wings, submit. You are not the disciple of a peak race. There’s nothing wrong with submitting to the Dragon Palace. After all, the Dragon Palace is going to advance to a peak race in the Universe!”

Ming Sha Sheng said indifferently to him!

This caused demon wing’s expression to constantly change, and he took a deep breath!

“I submit!”

He slightly lowered his head and said!

There was no other way, if he didn’t submit, he would be finished!

Submit!

Anyway, among the old crazy demons, the old witch, water demon, and Ming Sha Sheng had all submitted, it wasn’t shameful for him to submit!

Moreover, just as demon wing said, he wasn’t a powerhouse of a peak race, and after breaking through, he might be recruited by other peak race powerhouses!

It was not a bad idea to join the Dragon Palace Now!

If he didn’t join, he would die!

“Very good!”

Wang Xian revealed an excited expression. Next, he would make Shi Sen consume the dragon blood and transfer the Kingdom of God to the Dragon Palace!

After subduing the two of them, Wang Xian was a little excited!

Not only did he obtain all of their resources, but he could also have two powerful subordinates. It was a huge profit!

“Next, Shi Sen, Lei Shan, and sky-shrouding are the three crazy demons. Let them come all at once!”

Wang Xian, who had tasted the sweetness, was prepared to do the same. He took out the universal AI and sent a message to the three old crazy demons!

The message was received very quickly!

The old crazy demons did not hesitate at all when it came to a treasure that could allow them to achieve a breakthrough. They flew over at the fastest speed possible for fear of an accident!

After agreeing on a fixed time, Wang Xian began to absorb the resources of the demon wings and Ming Shasheng!

These old demons had a lot of resources. Each of them was comparable to the resources of a powerful high-level race!

Wang Xian was already close to achieving a breakthrough. According to his guess, after absorbing their resources, he should be able to achieve a breakthrough after absorbing the resources of one or two other demons!

Boom! Boom! Boom

While Wang Xian was absorbing the resources, figures flew over from the front of the ancient divine kingdom of Hengxu!

An earthen yellow stone man was emitting a heavy aura. He scanned his surroundings and slowly turned into an ordinary stone that was floating there!

Not long after, a dark cloud flew over. There seemed to be something inside the dark cloud. When he arrived, a branch extended out and stared at the stone that was floating to his right. It was glowing!

The Dark Cloud did not approach the stone. It was also waiting at the side!

The last one to arrive was an old monster that was purple all over and in human form. However, there was a lightning symbol between his brows!

He looked around and muttered, “Shi Sen, shading Tian, the two of you are here too!”

“Lei Shan, did you also receive the Dragon King’s message?”

The earthen yellow stone transformed into a native and asked Lei Shan!

Lei Shan nodded. “It should be time!”

“It’s Time!”

As soon as he finished his sentence, Wang Xian walked out from the inner part of the ancient Hengxu Divine Kingdom!

“Dragon King, do you have a large number of normal birth fruits?”

Lei Shan stared at Wang Xian and asked!

“That’s right, there are enough normal birth fruits. It’s enough for you to achieve a breakthrough!”

Wang Xian nodded his head faintly. With a move of his palm, 600 fruits flew towards them!

“Huh?”

Seeing the Dragon King giving them 200 fruits each, lightning blotting out the sky and Shi Sen were slightly taken aback!

He gave them the fruits just like that?

They hadn’t even started the trade yet!

They hadn’t even said what kind of items they wanted to trade with!

“You guys can take some to feel the effects first.”

Wang Xian looked at them with a smile on his face. He looked amiable!

The three old crazy demons were a little unsure of Wang Xian’s confidence. They only took some after a detailed inspection of the normal fetus fruits!

“It really works, it really works!”

Very soon, an excited voice came out from their mouths.

The eyes of the three crazy old men were filled with passion and excitement!

“Alright, as long as it works. The price is still the market price. However, you have a second choice. Join Our Dragon Palace and become a member of our Dragon Palace. Our Dragon Palace really hopes to have three powerhouses join us!”

Wang Xian continued with a smile on his face!

“Join the Dragon Palace? I’m sorry, Dragon King. I, Lei Shan, am used to freedom. Consuming the common embryo fruit is very useful to me. However, I don’t have enough resources now. After I make a breakthrough, we will return this favor to Your Dragon Palace!”

When Lei Shan heard Wang Xian’s words, his eyes sparkled as he spoke!

“Oh? You’re not joining? What about the two of you?”

Wang Xian slightly raised his eyebrows. He looked at sky-shrouding and Shi Sen and asked!

“We will remember this favor. We will return it to you in the future, Dragon King!”

Shi Sen stared at the ordinary fruit in his hand with a burning gaze and replied without raising his head!

Sky-shrouding didn’t say anything, but it was obvious that he had the same intention!

“That won’t do. If you don’t join us, the three of you will have to exchange resources!”

Wang Xian looked at them and shook his head!

“Hahaha, Dragon King, the fact that you have our favor is a huge opportunity for you and the Dragon Palace. You must seize this opportunity. Don’t miss it. Let’s meet again if we are fated!”

Lei Shan laughed and prepared to leave!

Sky shrouding and Shi Sen were also preparing to leave!

Obviously, they were not prepared to exchange resources!

Nonsense, the common fetus fruits were already in their hands. How could they be asked to exchange for a connate cardinal treasure?

Was that possible?

They were mad demons!
