Chapter 344: Corpse (2)

“A level 9 weapon is incomparably valuable. Even an Inborn expert would find it hard to obtain a Level 9 weapon!” Bian Yaoquan remarked proudly. Having a Level 9 weapon was also an exemplification of one’s standing. He had something that even Inborn experts didn’t have!

“I’ll use my weapon to slay this creature!” He looked emotionlessly at the ongoing battle as his lips curved into a smile.

“It’s going to get away. Old Du, we will pin it down while you attack it with the Level 9 weapon!” the middle-aged man in military uniform shouted loudly after seeing the mutated toad breaking out of the restraints of the cage.

“Leave it to me. I’ll definitely kill it within ten strikes!”

Old Du held the Sky Splitting Blade in his hand and spoke confidently.

“Holy Goddess, be careful!”

At this moment, the mutated toad charged towards Sun Lingxiu. It shot its horrifying tongue at her while fixing its gaze on her.

Sun Lingxiu was slightly surprised and instantly emitted dazzling light.

Swish!

However, a longsword with a golden shine slashed towards the mutated toad while it was in mid-air.

Before the sword reached it, the glow of the sword had slashed it.

All the surrounding experts with weapons in their hands could feel the resonance from their weapons.

Bam!

To the astonishment of the crowd, the golden longsword cut into the head of the toad directly.

The mutated toad fell to the ground.

“What?”

“This...”

The surrounding experts who were getting ready to attack were taken aback and shocked.

That golden longsword was actually able to cut into the body of the toad!

How could that be possible? Despite having it surrounded and attacking it for some time, they were only able to inflict minor injuries to it previously.

“Not bad, it’s pretty sharp.” A peal of light-hearted laughter resounded and the surrounding crowd instantly looked over.

Sensing the crowd’s attention, Wang Xian smiled and pointed the scabbard of Zhan Lu ahead of him.

Bzz bzz!

Zhan Lu, which had pierced the mutated toad, vibrated violently. After emitting a crisp buzzing sound, it flew back into the scabbard.

No blood was left on the razor-sharp blade at all.

“This... That is an Inborn Spiritual Weapon!”

Seeing this, an Inborn expert couldn’t hold back and exclaimed. He stared intensely at Zhan Lu in Wang Xian’s hand.

“Inborn Spiritual Weapon! Oh gosh! It’s an Inborn Spiritual Weapon!”

The surrounding crowd was greatly shocked.

Inborn Spiritual Weapons were weapons often regarded as only appearing in legends. Even though they were Inborn experts, they rarely saw one, let alone possessing one.

Blacksmith and alchemist were both occupations taken up by few. The most powerful and known grandmaster blacksmith was only Level 7.

He could forge Level 7 weapons. However, that’s still a huge difference from an Inborn Spiritual Weapon.

An Inborn Spiritual Weapon could be the Treasure of the Clan for a Sacred Clan or Sect.

The reason why they were so horrifying was because they possessed spirituality and the ability to suppress ordinary weapons.

If a Half-step to Inborn expert used an Inborn Spiritual Weapon, he could even slay an Inborn expert.

An Inborn Spiritual Weapon was incomparably sharp and could easily break through the defense of an Inborn expert.

Around Wang Xian, most of the Inborn experts had Level 6 or 7 weapons. A few had Level 8 weapons while only Bian Yaoquan had the Level 9 Sky Splitting Blade.

A Level 9 weapon had already greatly surprised them, let alone an Inborn Spiritual Weapon.

One should note that the Inborn level Hao Zhong had previously surprised the entire Sacred Sect, Heavenly Sound Sect!

“This is Zhan Lu!”

Wang Xian could tell everyone’s attentions were fixed on the longsword in his hand. He smiled, lifted it and explained to the crowd.

“Zhan Lu? It’s actually Zhan Lu! The top-3 weapon in history!”

“Inborn Spiritual Weapon, Zhan Lu. How incredible! Our combined all-out attack only managed to inflict light injuries on the mutated toad. Yet, Zhan Lu killed it directly. Zhan Lu is so much stronger than Level 9 weapons!” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Before the Inborn Spiritual Weapon, everything else is just scraps. Even a Level 9 weapon couldn’t possibly be a match for it!”

The surrounding Inborn experts exclaimed in shock as they turned and looked at the dead mutated toad.

Behind them, the rest of the crowd stared fervently at Zhan Lu. They were shocked and dumbfounded.

“Inborn Spiritual Weapon! Miracle Doctor Wang’s weapon is the Inborn Spiritual Weapon, Zhan Lu!”

“Oh gosh! I thought Young Master Bian was incredible to possess a Level 9 weapon! Who would have expected the sword of Miracle Doctor Wang to be an Inborn Spiritual Weapon?”

“Just a simple wave of his hand and the Inborn Spiritual Weapon killed the mutated toad. What horrifying sharpness!”

“I thought that the sword was just for decoration. I would have never expected...”

“It would appear that Miracle Doctor Wang actually has deeper pockets than Young Master Bian! Powerful medical skills, an alchemist and now his weapon!”

The strength that Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown had demonstrated over the past two days was too shocking.

Even the core disciple of a Sacred Sect with hundreds of years of history couldn’t be compared with him.

Bian Yaoquan’s jaw had dropped and he was in disbelief. Following which, his expression turned gloomy as he stared bitterly at Wang Xian.

He clenched his fist tightly. This rascal was going against him in all ways.

Murderous intent gleamed in Bian Yaoquan’s eyes.

The surrounding Inborn experts consciously and subconsciously looked at Zhan Lu fervently.

“Let me take a look at that mutated toad to see why it has such a powerful defense!”

A Miracle Doctor walked to the mutated toad and started examining it.

“Be careful, everyone. This matter is more severe than a few days ago. Even Half-Step to Dan Realm creatures have appeared!”

The middle-aged man in military uniform spoke with a solemn expression. Now that such a horrifying creature had appeared, would there be stronger creatures?

If there was, he could only invite the Laozus of those Sacred Clans.

He heaved a sigh and ordered his men to handle the corpses of the Inborn experts. After which, he looked to the muddy Yellow River.

Wang Xian was also looking into the Yellow River. He wasn’t concerned that he had exposed his Inborn Spiritual Weapon, Zhan Lu.

If the mutated toad had not attacked Sun Lingxiu previously, Wang Xian wouldn’t have struck.

Everyone’s attention was on the Inborn Spiritual Weapon, Zhan Lu. No one actually noticed Wang Xian’s strength level.

Wang Xian glanced at the corpse of the Cadaveric Toad before looking into the depths of the Yellow River.

The breadth of a thousand meters was all within Wang Xian’s sight as he used his Piercing Eye.

He walked to the edge of the shore and looked right down.

Sun Lingxiu looked at Wang Xian and came to him. Miracle Doctor Blood Man followed closely behind her.

“Miracle Doctor Wang, be careful!”

Seeing that Wang Xian was about to break away from the group, the middle-aged man in military uniform reminded him.

Wang Xian turned to him and nodded his head. A blue and red glow flashed in his eyes as he continued looking into the river.

Huh?

After walking along the river bank for over two thousand meters, he stopped in his tracks and looked in shock ahead of him.

“That is...?”

Wang Xian stared intensely at the middle of the river.

A group of mutated creatures had gathered there. There were Cadaveric Mosquitoes, Cadaveric Leech and Cadaveric ants that were half a meter in size.

There were also toads that were two meters in size.

A total of approximately thirty horrifying creatures lay there and seemed to be protecting something in the middle of the river.
