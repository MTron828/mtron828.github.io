Chapter 1604: 1604 Battle of Madness 3

“Attack!”

When the supreme headmaster and Patriarch Fengchi saw Nangong Jianghe’s plea for help, their expressions changed drastically.

A huge green fan flew towards Wang Xian.

Dense wind needles also flew towards Wang Xian.

“Are you looking down on me? Keke!”

Mo Sha saw the two of them attacking and laughed out loud with a cold expression. He opened his arms.

His body was covered in scales and he looked like a devil.

When he opened his arms, the dark power around him condensed into pitch-black dragon scales.

The wind attribute and wind needles that were filled with destruction landed on the pitch-black dragon scales around Mo Sha!

“Keke, awesome, powerful defense, this is awesome!”

The wind needles and wind rays that landed around mo sha immediately dissipated, causing an excited expression to appear on his face.

“Quick, quick, hide at the furthest place!”

“Oh my God, the sky demon is actually on par with Nangong Jianghe!”

“Hide, hide at the furthest place!”

The sudden outbreak of the battle caused the other factions in the vast area to nearly wet their pants.

Even the Wuji Empire’s Patriarch’s expression changed drastically as he hurriedly led everyone from the Wuji Empire to fly towards the furthest edge of the array formation.

They directly pulled apart a distance of ten kilometers.

The strongest expert of the other first-rate forces of the He clan also hurriedly led his clansmen to hide around Wuji Empire.

“Priest Wang’s strength?”

Wu Qing Cheng’s face was filled with shock as he looked at the spot where the battle was taking place. He exclaimed in disbelief.

“Ninth level of the profound void tier. This is definitely the destructive power of a ninth level of the profound void tier!”

The elder from the Wuji Empire roared in shock.

The Sky Demon actually possessed the strength of a ninth level void interpretation!

The people from all the surrounding factions were also filled with shock.

“No wonder they dared to not give any face to the only sect!”

“F * ck! If Bing Jian ‘Er had married priest Wang back then, the Ice Heart Empire would have been able to live in peace for at least four to five thousand years. Now, they actually...”

A series of shocked voices came from the surroundings. Everyone looked towards the location of the battle in fear.

“Ahhhh!”

At this moment, screams of Pain were heard. In the southern royal family which was targeted by Wang Xian, death had already begun.

“Hiss! The people from the southern royal family are going to be destroyed!” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“The sky demon is simply too unbridled. The southern royal family wants to help lone sect. He immediately killed everyone from the southern Royal Family!”

“This time, even the southern royal family has been kicked to the metal plate!”

Everyone’s expression changed drastically when they heard these screams.

“Sky Demon, you’re courting death!”

Nangong Jianghe’s furious roar sounded. His gaze swept across the southern royal family’s location, and his eyes were blood-red.

He never expected that the sky demon actually possessed the strength of a ninth level void interpretation.

If he knew, why would he make a move?

But now, there was no room for regret!

“Trash of the southern Royal Family, your southern royal disciple was killed by me, Hehe!”

“More than a thousand years ago, your southern royal family’s Nangong Shang ambushed me and was killed by me. Nangong Shang, you damned fellow caused me to be silent for more than a thousand years!”

At this moment, Mo Sha’s maniacal laughter came from the front.

“What? My father was killed by you!”

When Nangong Jianghe heard Mo Sha’s words, he glared at him furiously.

“Damn it! Nangong Shang, that despicable fellow, launched a sneak attack on me. If it wasn’t for my quick reaction, I would have died in the hands of your southern Royal Family!”

Mo Sha was also a little irritable and shouted directly.

“Haha, just in time. Let’s have a battle today!”

Wang Xian laughed out loud with a ferocious expression.

“Roar!”

As he roared, his body transformed into a divine dragon that was 150 meters in size.

The grayish mist emitted a bloody aura as it filled the surroundings. The five elements grinding mill above his head emitted a destructive aura.

“I would like to see if today’s battle can destroy your solipsistic sect!”

Wang Xian was a little ferocious as he unleashed all the strength in his body without any restraint.

Nearly 100,000 innocent people died because of him.

He wanted to take revenge.

Today, he had already consumed the violent blood pill. He was already prepared to lose his body here.

With his body, he would destroy the entire sect.

“You You...”

The supreme headmaster and Patriarch Fengchi stared at Wang Xian and Mo Sha as their expressions changed drastically.

Two experts at the ninth level of the Seethrough void tier were actually two experts at the ninth level of the Seethrough void tier.

Even if they were to pull Nangong Jianghe along and fight three against two, even if they were able to win.

Some of them might even die.

As for the entire lone sect, their battle could only be carried out here since their array formation covered 108 mountains.

However, once the formation was withdrawn, the sky demon and Mo Sha could leave easily.

“Jian ‘er, don’t be afraid. With me around, no one can hurt you!”

Wang Xian’s gaze swept across everyone. His dragon body moved and flew directly towards Ling Jian ‘er.

Gulp

Ao Tian’s face was filled with fear when he saw Wang Xian flying over.

“Tian ‘er, let’s Go!”

The sect master’s wife immediately grabbed ao Tian’s arm and flew towards the back.

At this moment, no one dared to stop Wang Xian.

Buzz

Wang Xian’s dragon claw extended towards Ling Jian ‘ER. The restraints on her body were instantly removed.

“Wang Xian!”

Ling Jian ‘er opened her mouth. Her red eyes were filled with joy as she looked at him and landed in the middle of his Dragon Claw.

“Jian ‘er, don’t worry!”

Wang Xian smiled and looked at Mo Sha. “Mo Sha, I’ll leave Jian ‘er to you. As long as she loses a single hair, you won’t be able to live anymore!”

“Don’t worry, boss Mo. with me, Mo Sha, around, no one will be able to harm Miss Ling Jian ‘er!”

Mo Sha patted his chest and promised.

“Turn off the formation!”

The supreme headmaster and Patriarch Fengchi felt the aura from Wang Xian and Mo sha and shouted in embarrassment.

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz

With the formation shut down, only the mountain range could enter and exit freely again.

“The formation is activated. Let’s Retreat!”

“Only the sect has given in. They don’t dare to fight here!”

“Originally, only the sect wanted to use the formation to trap them and kill them. However, the sky demon now has the strength of A Level 9 Seethrough void martial artist. It has completely exceeded the ability of only the sect to fight back!”

“I didn’t expect that the sky demon would actually win this confrontation. Moreover, after today, a fifth Super Force will appear in the vast area!”

All the forces revealed shocked expressions when they saw the formation break.

Using the strength of two people, they made the only sect lower its head.

“You think that I will leave after opening the formation? Haha!”

“If I leave, then what about the nearly 100,000 people who died because of me?”

“Today, unless I die here, your sect will not be at peace!”

Wang Xian waved his dragon claw and sent Ling Jian ‘er to Mo Sha’s side. His body was emitting a bloody and determined aura.

He swept his gaze across everyone in the sect and roared with killing intent.

His words caused everyone in the sect to have extremely gloomy expressions.

It is easy to invite evil, but difficult to send evil!
