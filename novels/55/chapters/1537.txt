Chapter 1538: 1538 suppressing all heaven’s favorites 1

“Greetings, Your Majesty!”

“Haha, Jian ‘Er is here. Sit Down, sit down!” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

In a palace that looked like a small palace, Ling Jian ‘er entered and respectfully greeted the old man sitting in the middle.

The old man was wearing an ice-white robe, and there was a white dragon embroidered on his chest. It was a dragon from the transcendent continent!

This was the monarch of the Bingxin Empire.

The bingxin monarch’s face was filled with smiles when he saw Ling Jian ‘er arrive.

This woman was brought back by the grand ancestor of the Empire not too long ago, and she possessed extremely terrifying talent. She was only in her thirties, yet she already possessed the strength of the second level of the profound void tier.

Most importantly, she possessed terrifying battle prowess, and she was completely capable of fighting against opponents of a higher level.

She was even more powerful than the most monstrous disciple nurtured by the three great superpowers!

This made the bingxin king very happy. For the entire empire to have such a proud son of heaven appearing in the Bingxin Empire was a good thing.

However, what made him helpless was that Ling Jian ‘er was too cold, as though she had no feelings.

“It’s the Emperor!”

Ling Jian ‘er nodded and sat at the side.

In the room, there were a few princes and princesses. The most outstanding one was the ninth prince. He was over 100 years old and had the strength of a third-level profound void martial artist.

Over 100 years was still very young for a lifespan of 5,000 years.

“In a few days, the black curtain garden will open. You must be careful when you enter. At that time, our Bingxin Empire will send some experts at the peak of the third-level profound void martial artist to follow you. They will focus on training and do not encounter any danger!”

The king of Bingxin said to them.

“Don’t worry, father. I will definitely protect my younger brothers and sisters!”

The ninth Prince said to the king of Bingxin.

“Haha, Good, good. With Jing Huan around, father will feel much more at ease!”

The king of Bingxin smiled. He was very satisfied with this son of his.

Everyone chatted with each other. Ling Jian ‘er sat there and seldom spoke. She only spoke a few sentences when she was asked about her. She appeared to be a little cold.

Wang Xian hid in the void of a thousand meters and looked down.

Half an hour later, Ling Jian ‘er stood up and left. Only the king of Bingxin and the ninth Prince were left in the room.

“Father, can you betroth Jian ‘er to your son?”

Just as Wang Xian was about to leave, he suddenly heard the ninth Prince’s words.

This made him slightly stunned and he slowly closed his eyes.

“Jing Huan, are you interested in Jian ‘er?”

The king of Bingxin knocked on the table gently and asked with a smile.

“Yes, imperial father. I will not hide it from you. I am in love with Jian ‘er!”

A hint of passion flashed across the ninth Prince’s eyes as he nodded his head.

Whether it was Ling Jian ‘ER’s talent or her temperament, they both made him rather tempted.

“Now that Jian ‘ER has joined our bingxin empire for such a short period of time, it would be bad if imperial father were to marry her directly. Wait a little longer, wait a little longer!”

The king of Bingxin said with a smile on his face.

“Thank you, Father! Thank you, Father!”

The ninth Prince stood up excitedly and bowed.

“Haha!”

The king of Bingxin laughed.

“Damn it, a guy who is more than a hundred years old still wants to marry Jian ‘er!”

Wang Xian, who was in the air, narrowed his eyes slightly. A hint of coldness flashed in his eyes.

“It seems like I can’t hide in the surroundings every day. I have to take action. With Ling Jian ‘ER’s current attitude, if the king of Bingxin were to marry her to this ninth prince, she might not know how to reject him!”

Wang Xian frowned and stared at Ling Jian ‘ER’s figure. His figure moved and followed behind her.

“Sister Ling Jian ‘er, two days later, the Prince of Wuqing City invited us to attend a banquet. Don’t forget about it!”

Ling Jian ‘er and the princesses and princes of the Bingxin Empire walked out. A prince said with a smile.

“Prince of Wuqing City? is he the Prince of Wuqing City of Wuji Imperial City?”

Ling Jian ‘er was slightly interested and asked them.

“That’s right, the Prince of Wuqing City of Wuji Imperial City. I heard that the Prince of Wuqing City wants to use the black curtain heart fruit in the black curtain garden to increase his strength. The black curtain heart fruit is very precious, so we are preparing to invite the disciples of the major forces. If we can get it, I hope we can sell it to him!”

The prince nodded.

“I heard that the two Peerless Heaven’s favorites from the sect will be there as well. The Beast Taming Young Master from the He clan’s forest will be there as well. At that time, the heaven’s favorites from the vast region will be gathered!”

A princess said as her eyes lit up.

“Then I want to take a look!”

Ling Jian ‘er nodded her head. She was also filled with curiosity towards the heaven’s favorites from the vast region.

“A banquet? Why don’t I go there and meet Ling Jian ‘er formally?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and thought to himself.

“However, I don’t seem to have an invitation letter. Wouldn’t it be bad if I went in directly?”

Wang Xian frowned slightly and followed Ling Jian ‘ER to her residence. He continued to watch her practice her swordsmanship.

At night, Ling Jian ‘er sat cross-legged on the bed and cultivated. Wang Xian hesitated for a moment before flying out.

“The direction of the He clan is over there!”

Wang Xian hid in the sky and flew towards the He clan.

According to the conversations of the princes and Princesses of the Bingxin Empire, he yuan would also be attending the banquet.

“The Forest Beast Master. This title has a personality!”

Wang Xian smiled and arrived at the He clan’s base in the ruins of the divine kingdom.

As the He clan with the best first-rate forces, they also occupied quite a lot of territory in the ruins of the divine kingdom.

However, what made Wang Xian frown was that he yuan was nowhere to be found when he used his dragon eyes of light and dark fire to search the entire he clan from the sky.

“What’s going on? Is He not here yet?”

Wang Xian hesitated. He moved his body and came to the position below. He looked for some people and asked around. However, he yuan was nowhere to be seen.

“Is he not here yet?”

Wang Xian frowned and walked slowly on the road. He was thinking about how to get an invitation letter.

“I should go to Guangming Villa to look for Wu Qingyan. He is the Princess of Wuji Empire. The younger sister of Wuqing City should have an invitation letter?”

Wang Xian hesitated in his heart and walked towards the seat in front.

The territory of Wuji Empire was in the middle of the He clan and Bingxin Empire. He happened to pass by when he went back.

However, he had only met Wu Qingyan once. Furthermore, he had taught her a lesson. If he were to go...

“Your Highness the Crown Prince, we have arrived at the mansion!”

Just as Wang Xian was walking on the road, deep in thought, a voice suddenly came from the front.

“Crown Prince?”

Wang Xian was slightly taken aback. A look of astonishment appeared on his face.

“What a coincidence! Just as I was dozing off, someone sent me a pillow.”

He mumbled as he looked ahead.

A handsome and extraordinary young man got down from a luxurious car.

The young man was wearing black clothes. On his chest, there were four big white words.

Wuji world!

The crown prince, in the imperial dynasty, the only one who could have this title was the heir to the throne of the next generation.

The heir to the throne of Wuji dynasty represented the top existence that would be able to cover 30% of the world in the future.

And Wuqing City was the crown prince of the Wuji dynasty!
