Chapter 1455: 1455 chased after 20,000 Li, killing him

Run, run!

The Blood Emperor looked at the terrifying killing intent charging at him. Even though he was a sixth level void interpretation expert, his face was pale.

Without any hesitation, he roared loudly and directly fled into the distance.

Flowing Emperor Alliance had three sixth level void interpretation experts, and Beast Empire still had four sixth level void interpretation experts, a total of seven.

However, they only had four.

As for the rank five and rank four profound void martial artists and above, the difference was many times greater.

“Run, run!”

All the people of the blood flow empire did not have the slightest fighting spirit, and fled in the direction of the blood flow empire in fear.

They had never expected that today, when they came to destroy the Flowing Emperor Alliance, the result would be their own doomsday.

The powerhouses of the Bloody Flow Empire tried their best to escape into the distance.

In just a few seconds, they had fled four to five thousand meters away.

“Roar!”

“All the insightful emptiness realm experts chase after them. Those who have not reached the insightful emptiness realm do not need to chase after them!”

At this moment, a majestic voice sounded in the sky.

In the surroundings, the tens of millions of humans who had not managed to escape far looked towards the direction of the voice. Soon, their eyes widened.

“Oh my god, what kind of creature is that?”

“It’s Wang Xian, the Heaven’s Pride Supreme Wang Xian!”

“It’s too terrifying. It’s 70 meters long. This is the largest creature I’ve ever seen!”

The humans widened their eyes and were filled with shock.

“Follow your orders, chase after it!”

The leaders of the demon Lin clan and the bloodthirsty sea monsters were slightly shocked when they sensed the terrifying aura coming from Wang Xian.

They didn’t hesitate at all and immediately roared at all the Demon Beast races.

Although Wang Xian didn’t belong to their Demon Beast Empire, he was the boss of their emperor. How could he not obey?

“Today, I will definitely destroy your blood flow empire!”

Wang Xian swayed his huge body and directly made Feng Luan stand on his body.

On his left and right, there were four demon Lin and bloodthirsty sea demon beasts of the insightful void level on his left and right.

Sect Master Ling followed from the side.

Behind him, there were a few thousand insightful void-level demon beasts and four to five hundred insightful void-level powerhouses from the Drifting Emperor Alliance.

“Roar! Roar!”

Wang Xian roared and chased after them.

Feng Luan stood on Wang Xian with a smile on her face. She held the Phoenix staff in her hand and a huge pair of Phoenix Wings appeared on her back. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

She was dressed in fiery red clothes and surrounded herself. Standing on Wang Xian, she was like the Queen of the entire continent.

Wang Xian was trying to create momentum for Feng Luan!

It was to pave the way for Feng Luan to control the flowing sea region in the future.

“What is the relationship between the Queen of Dragon and Phoenix and Wang Xian? Wang Xian actually allowed her to stand on his body!”

“I heard that the Dragon and Phoenix Empire was able to reach this stage thanks to the support of the Supreme Heaven’s pride expert. Their relationship is not shallow!”

“It’s too terrifying. That Supreme Heaven’s pride expert led thousands of insightful void stage powerhouses to hunt down the flowing blood empire. Good Boy!”

“Lord Wang Xian and the rest are still magnanimous. They are not as overbearing as the blood flow empire.”

The humans around them heaved a sigh of relief when they saw that the demon beasts and the Flowing Emperor Alliance did not attack them. They looked forward in shock.

It was not only the humans around them who were shocked.

Even the insightful emptiness realm experts from the flowing Emperor Alliance who were following behind had a contemplative look on their faces when they saw this scene.

What happened today was not only shocking to the blood flow empire, but also to them.

Looking at Feng Luan who was standing on Wang Xian’s body, everyone had a myriad of thoughts in their minds.

In the future, there might be a queen appearing in this flowing sea region!

“They are chasing us. It’s over, it’s over!”

“No, don’t kill me, don’t kill me!”

There were more than a thousand experts from the blood flow empire who had yet to reach the profound void tier. How could they be faster than Wang Xian and the rest.

When they saw the thousands of insightful emptiness realm experts who were chasing after them, despair appeared on their faces.

They begged for mercy loudly in despair.

Wang Xian ignored them and continued to chase after the 600 to 700 insightful emptiness realm experts who were flying ahead.

However, Wang Xian did not bother with them. This did not mean that the demonic beasts of the first and second level of the insightful emptiness realm and the people from the Liuhuang Alliance did not bother with them.

“Ahhhh!”

When Wang Xian flew about 2,000 meters away, he heard a scream coming from behind him.

“Ah, don’t kill me, don’t kill me. I surrender. I’m willing to join the Liuhuang Alliance!”

“No, no, no, no!”

Very soon, in less than a minute, the first level of the insightful void Tier, who was the slowest, was caught up.

The sound of despair was heard again.

The pursuit continued!

“Spread out, let’s spread out!”

“How can we spread out? There are thousands of insightful void martial artists on the other side. Even if we spread out, we will be chased by a group of insightful void martial artists!”

“Blood Emperor, save me, Your Majesty, Save Me!”

After five minutes of pursuit, more and more insightful void martial artists died.

Originally, there were 600 to 700 insightful void martial artists in bloody flow empire, but now there were only over 300.

At this moment, many insightful emptiness realm experts had collapsed. They shouted loudly at the few figures in front of them who were dozens of kilometers away.

“Roar! Roar!”

At this moment, another roar came from behind them.

“Lock onto the four insightful emptiness realm experts of the blood flow empire. Increase Your Speed!”

Wang Xian shouted softly. His huge figure swayed and his speed increased once again.

The five insightful void Tier 6 powerhouses beside him also increased their speed and locked onto the four emperors of the blood flow empire.

As for the rest of the insightful void tier powerhouses of the blood flow empire, they were beheaded by the thousands of insightful void tier powerhouses behind them!

“Damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it!”

At the front, the blood emperor and the three powerhouses of the blood flow empire were shouting in horror.

Hearing the screams coming from behind, they gritted their teeth and looked pale.

“Run! As long as we enter the palace and open the array, we can fight them!”

One of the Emperors clenched his fist and roared. His eyes were filled with madness.

“Blood Emperor, three emperors! Today, you won’t be able to escape! Don’t even think about escaping!”

Sect Master Ling flew on his sword and roared with killing intent as he looked at the four rulers of the blood flow empire who were more than ten kilometers away.

“You Want to kill us? Dream On!”

The Blood Emperor roared with a cold face. He gritted his teeth and turned into a bloody shadow.

“Oh my God, what a terrifying sound. A shadow flashed by. Who is that?”

“Blood Emperor? Why did I hear that it’s the blood emperor? I heard three emperors. What’s Going On!”

“Oh my God, what’s that 70-meter-tall creature? And those terrifying demonic beasts!”

While they were chasing, they arrived above a city.

When a deafening sound rang out, the city-guarding formation automatically activated.

The enormous city-guarding formation trembled under the cold shouts, as if it was about to collapse.

A terrifying figure flashed past, and everyone’s eyes widened.

“The Blood Emperor and the three emperors are being chased. Oh My God, what is going on?”

Within the city, a terrifying figure flew past, and the terrifying pressure made them lie on the ground.

Even the city Lord felt the same. They raised their heads and muttered with shock on their faces.
