2701 2701 headed to the imperial court

“Dragon King, how is it, isn’t it very powerful? Haha, it has the powerful poison that I and Ba Qi released, this poison is all immersed in the bones, as long as it hurts the enemy’s body, the poison will enter the enemy’s body, even an undying level 9 warrior will be injured, an 8 will die immediately.”

Within the Dragon King Palace, Mo Sha was all smiles as he took credit.

“Your poison is useless, an undying level 8 or 9 wouldn’t be able to defend against the dragon armament. You guys are even worse than Duan Jin Ming’s Fire Gold Dragon Sword, fire gold hook!”

Beside him, Tian Cheng laughed and said.

Mo Sha curled his lips and didn’t say anything else. Speaking of which, their poison was indeed useless.

There was no other choice. Currently, the weakest department in the entire Dragon Palace was ao Yasha and the others from the Dragon Defense Department. The second department was Mo Sha and the others.

They could only fight against those who were one level above them. In the Dragon Palace, they were considered the five worst fighters.

The fire metal sword and the fire metal hook were modified by Duan Jinming and the others using the bones of their dragon mechanical bodies. They could enhance the combat strength of the dragon mechanical body.

The current dragon mechanical body was much stronger than before.

Wang Xian was very satisfied with the dragon mechanical body. It was much more suitable than using it to enhance the strength of the members of the Dragon Palace.

“Dragon King, the imperial court has announced something on the AI.”

At this moment, Prime Minister Gui walked over and said to Wang Xian.

“HMM? What is it?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and asked Prime Minister gui.

“It has just been announced that the imperial court is recruiting strong individuals. Any strong individuals from the imperial star area are welcome to enter the Abyss to establish their merit points.”

“It has been stated that as long as you come to the imperial court and kill the abyssal seed, you will be able to accumulate the imperial court’s merits. The merits are of great use. Now, the entire imperial star field is in an uproar.”

Prime Minister Gui said as he waved his arm. The image of the imperial court’s announcement appeared in front of him.

At the same time, there were some discussions about this announcement.

Wang Xian looked over. Indeed, just now, the imperial court had issued an all-ai announcement.

This announcement from the imperial court had caused an uproar in the entire Imperial Star Field. The main reason was that as long as one had sufficient merit points, one could become a disciple of the imperial court.

Furthermore, as long as one had merit points, one could exchange for many treasures that would drive one crazy.

“The imperial court has actually opened the imperial court’s treasury. As long as one has merit points, one can exchange for them?”

“This foundation is really terrifying.”

Wang Xian’s face was filled with astonishment.

There were many types of items to exchange for. There were thousands of pages in total, and each page contained thousands of treasures.

Even Wang Xian was envious of the treasures inside.

Other than these treasures, cultivation techniques, guidance from experts, and some cultivation treasure grounds could all be exchanged with merit points.

However, although countless treasures were coveted, many people also realized a problem. The abyss of the imperial court was very dangerous.

Even the imperial court had gathered experts in this manner. One could imagine how dangerous the Abyss would be.

“This edict from the imperial court will probably attract many experts over.”

Wang Xian mumbled.

Gathering all the experts in the imperial star field, as long as they killed the abyssal seeds, they would be rewarded with merit points and a merit list would be established.

This was a good opportunity for many people to become famous.

Once they made a name for themselves here, it would be known by everyone in the imperial star field very quickly.

To become famous in one battle.

Merit points and fame had a fatal attraction for many experts.

Even if they knew it would be very dangerous.

“Dragon King, should we send the experts over?”

Prime Minister Gui asked Wang Xian. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The imperial court’s announcement of gathering all the heroes in the world also had a lot of attraction for the Dragon Palace.

In the Imperial Court, merit points were exchanged with the abyss seed crystals. According to Prime Minister Gui’s calculations, the exchange of an abyss seed Crystal for merit points was a little higher than the market price.

The Dragon Palace could send people to hunt the abyss seed in exchange for merit points and exchange merit points for elixirs.

“Send people to know more about that place before sending them.”

Wang Xian said faintly. He took out his artificial intelligence and sent a message to the empress.

Not long after, the Empress sent him a long reply.

The content of the reply was about the current situation of the imperial court.

The Empress was currently at the Abyss battlefield where the imperial court was at the border of the Night Cold Island.

As the Empress of the current generation of the imperial court, she did not head to the core battlefield. Instead, she was at a relatively safe place.

According to her, the situation there was a little cruel. It was a fact that the Imperial Court had an undying Pinnacle God king fall.

Furthermore, the abyssal seed on their side was different from the northern side. The abyssal seed there knew how to create terrain, how to use the battlefield, and even the unique god equipment of the abyss.

At the entrance of the abyss, there were all sorts of huge abyssal meteorites floating. These meteorites were extremely sturdy.

There were even some floating abyssal forests.

The abyssal creatures used these terrains to expand the abyss. If they wanted to stop them, they had to enter the abyss to hunt. After entering, it wasn’t certain who was the prey and who was the hunter.

...

Hence, the imperial court had suffered a huge loss. According to what Imperial Star Lady Knew, since the war started almost two months ago, the imperial court had lost at least 100,000 immortal God kings.

This was an extremely huge number.

Therefore, in the face of such losses, the imperial court opened the treasury and attracted the experts from the imperial star field to relieve the pressure.

“They know how to build the terrain and have already lost no less than 100,000 immortal kings and Abyss seeds. How terrifying.”

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered. Under such circumstances, it was not worth it for the experts from the Dragon Palace to go over.

This was because the imperial court did not have the upper hand in the Battle of the Abyss. All the powers of the Dragon Palace combined would not be able to change the situation.

“Wang Xian, are you coming over?”

“This time, our imperial court has gathered and promised many benefits. You can bring the powerhouses of the Dragon Palace over to take a look.”

At this moment, the Imperial Star Lady sent another message.

“Do you want to go over to take a look?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and appeared to be deep in thought.

...

“Alright, send me the coordinates. I’ll go over and take a look in the next few days.”

After thinking for a while, he decided to go over to the imperial court.

If the situation was not too dangerous, he could call over some experts from the Dragon Palace. If the situation was dangerous, he could also lead a few experts from the Dragon Palace to hunt down some powerful immortal god King abyssal seeds.

Putting everything aside, killing a few level nine abyssal seeds was a significant improvement for the Dragon Palace.

When the Empress heard that Wang Xian was coming, she was very surprised and immediately sent him a location.

“Prime Minister Gui, get Ao Jian to bring two dragon guards and AO qitian. I’m going to the imperial court to take a look at the situation.”

Wang Xian looked at the location that the Empress sent over and said to Prime Minister Gui.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Prime Minister Gui nodded.

Soon, Ao Jian and AO qitian walked over with two dragon guards.

The two Dragon Guards had level 9 immortal king combat strength. As for AO qitian, he had already reached the peak of the immortal king combat strength.
