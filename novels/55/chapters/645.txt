Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Ji ji ji, ji ji ji!

A scary buzz came from the sky.

A Manta Ray of more than thirty meters was flapping just like a bat flapping its wings in the air.

Its teeth were five meters long as though bones were piercing outward when the mouth was open.

Along with its cry, clouds of scary demonic aura coagulated into smaller Manta Ray images of four meters in size.

The demonic shadow struck at the sharp golden swords.

Boom boom!

The Manta Ray demonic phantoms collided with the golden sword shadows, giving off a huge explosion. Black and golden colors exploded like daunting fireworks.

Whoosh!

At this instance, rays of golden beams darted out from the sea as though some terrifying things were rising out from it while the seawater spread out on its own.

Roving Sword stood on the longsword that was glowing in golden radiance. He was staring at the Manta Ray King that was oozing with demonic aura in the air.

“Get out of our region!”

The Manta Ray King suspended itself in the air as it stared at Roving Sword with its pitch-black eyes, spewing rings of ripples.

The ripple waves were like a transmission on a spiritual level as the voice traveled out to a radius of over ten kilometers!

All the living creatures could understand, as though its words could enter into the mind of every living being.

“We came from the Dragon Palace. If you submit to us and join us, we can spare your life!”

Roving Sword stared at the Manta Ray King and spoke with a cold face.

“What Dragon Palace? Get out of this water region, or else, die!”

The Manta Ray King flapped its vast wings, shrouding Roving Sword with a domineering demonic aura.

At the same time, its body looked like a fighter plane, whizzing in at Roving Sword.

“Swords rule the world, I’m the supreme!”

Seeing Manta Ray King going for a strike, Roving Sword jerked himself back, releasing daunting metallic energy and blocking the shrouding demonic aura.

Millions of golden longswords appeared in the void, aiming straight at Manta Ray King.

Zi zi!

Manta Ray King suddenly retracted its wings while the sharp teeth in its gigantic head went for a bite of Roving Sword’s head.

“Spaceless Blade!”

Seeing that no swords left any trace on its wings, Roving Sword raised his arm and brought it down!

All the golden radiance came together at rapid speed, forming a hundred-meter-long sword pointing at Manta Ray King.

Bang, bang, bang!

Behind Manta Ray King was a black tail that extended to a length of over ten meters like a devilish whip, sweeping in at Roving Sword.

“Sword Defense!”

There was a change in Roving Sword’s expression. The surrounding golden swords were spinning at a rapid speed, forming a wall of sword defense.

Boom!

However, the compelling forces swept off Roving Sword, causing him to plummet into the sea at a terrifying speed.

Waves splashed up a hundred meters.

“Jiji, Devil Shadow!”

Manta Ray King watched the sea with trembling wings.

Another similar-sized demonic shadow headed into the sea.

Boom!

Another explosion was heard. All the seawater within the radius of one kilometer sank down, forming a scary whirlpool.

Roar!

At this moment, a beam of sword radiance darted out from the sea.

The golden longsword was twenty meters in size, directed at the Manta Ray King.

This was not a golden longsword, but a daunting metallic swordfish.

Golden swordfish, Roving Sword.

At this time, Roving Sword returned back to his original form with imposing aura. His entire body had turned into a ruthless sword.

Using the spine on his head as the tip of the sword, and his body as the edge of the sword, his fishtail was the sword hilt!

Sword becomes one, I’m the sword!

Bam!

Roving Sword transformed into a sword and charged.

Boom!

Petrifying impact and a deafening clang resounded through Heaven and Earth.

Ji ji! Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

However, Manta Ray King went forward slow and steady with its hair-raising wings and tail.

Boom boom!

The battle between the Immortals was destructive.

Patches of gold and black filled the air while all the water in the sea tumbled.

The current sea was like a small boat rocking in a tsunami.

Bam, Bam, Bam!

At this moment, Manta Ray King’s tail was emitting dazzling black demonic aura, looming over Roving Sword’s body with its Devil’s Whip.

The unparalleled domineering power caused the glow on Roving Sword’s body to dim.

Bam!

Countless Devil’s Whips suddenly got together and stuck forcefully at Roving Sword.

Roving Sword was thrown off, sinking into the deep blue sea.

“Oh no, what a terrifying Manta Ray King!”

Wang Xian, who flew over from the disordered island, was aghast.

“Jiji, go to hell!”

The tail of Manta Ray King suddenly grew long and stabbed into the sea.

“Sword Alps!”

Roar!

No hesitation at all. In that instance, Wang Xian swept in with majestic energy.

The seawater within a radius of ten kilometers tumbled, forming a daunting Sword Alps on the sea surface.

The Sword Alps of a few thousand meters stood before Manta Ray King, blocking off its tail.

At the same time, Wang Xian turned into a Marine Divine Dragon ten meters in size!

Ka Ka Ka!

The Manta Ray King’s tail stabbed into the Sword Alps. The mountain-like Sword Alps cracked at a rapid speed.

“Crazy attacking power!”

Wang Xian’s expression changed.

“You’re courting your own doom!”

Manta Ray King’s eyes slowly turned red. The appearance of Wang Xian infuriated him.

Wang Xian swayed his body while his tail rocked in the sea.

“Great Waterfall Water Shockwave!”

Instantly, the water from the sea shot up straight to the sky.

All the water up to two thousand meters deep rose into the sky in a split second.

As the seawater rose up, a black seabed emerged.

“Get out of my territory, or die!”

Manta Ray King spun around and fixed its eyes at Wang Xian. It flapped its scary wings, transforming into a devil shadow.

It charged through the water region that rose in the sky ten kilometers high ahead of it.

“Water Shockwave!”

Wang Xian stared at the domineering Manta Ray King and exhibited a stern look on his face.

His body exuded a dazzling azure glow.

Boom boom!

Streams of Water Shockwave rushed towards Manta Ray King within a radius of ten kilometers, with Water Shockwaves coming one after another.

Every Water Shockwave rose to a thousand meters just like the twine of Aquatic Ropes, gathering forces of supremacy!

Clang!

At this time, there was another clashing sound. A twenty-meter-long sword was charging toward Manta Ray King again.

Wang Xian had an idea. A hole tear in the Great Waterfall Water Shockwave such that Roving Sword could charge.

Ow!

Along with the Water Shockwave force, the Merciless Sword slashed across!

An agonized voice was heard while dark blood slowly flowed out from its body.

“Damn you!”

The Devil’s Whip of Manta Ray King swept Roving Sword aside while his wings were flapping at a daunting frequency.

Om!

“What fast speed!”

Seeing Manta Ray King disappearing at his right-hand side immediately, Wang Xian was slightly horrified.
