Chapter 4188: 4,187 had a breakthrough

Translator: 549690339

Among the 12 corpses, there are still nine that have their spatial attributes removed. If I take out five of them to trade, I should have enough resources to break through on my own

Wang Xian did some calculations.

Currently, he needed a lot of resources to break through.

However, he had enough resources to exchange for five corpses.

Wang Xian took out his communication stone plate and sent a message to the elven empress and the rest.

Of course, he did not send a message to the emperor of Phoenix.

He had no intention of trading these treasures with the Phoenix tribe.

After hesitating for a moment, Wang Xian also informed the skeleton tribe, the Divine Tiger Tribe, and the Celestial Nation.

Although these three tribes did not have any powerhouses in the Heaven’s origin realm, the resources they had were huge.

It was enough to trade for the corpse of a powerhouse in the Heaven’s origin Kismet Realm.

After the news was sent, Wang Xian read the reply and talked to the other powerhouses in the Heaven’s origin Kismet realm before setting a date.

A trade would be held in a thousand years.

At that time, the other powerhouses in the Heaven’s origin Kismet Realm could also take out some treasures to trade.

“Dragon King, the floating queen of the Celestial Nation and the rest are requesting to see you!”

Not long after, Prime Minister Gui flew over and reported to Wang Xian.

When Wang Xian heard that, he raised his eyebrows. Summon them in! ”

“It’s the Dragon King! ”

Prime Minister Gui nodded.

“Greetings, Dragon King! ”

“Greetings, Dragon King! ”

Soon, the floating queen followed her two brothers and rushed over. She bowed respectfully to Wang Xian.

Queen of the floating water. The last time Wang Xian brought her to the sword and magic universe, she stayed there for a long time.

Liu Lan taught her a lot.

However, her breakthrough naturally required her to return to the nine-origin universe.

Ever since she came to the nine-origin universe, she had been cultivating and had yet to make a breakthrough!

The corpse of a heaven-origin creator that Wang Xian obtained this time had a water attribute.

However, he wasn’t prepared to give it to the queen of the floating water tribe for free.

In the past, Wang Xian invested in her because he wanted her to stand on the same side as him and fight against the Phoenix tribe together.

However, the strength of Wang Xian and the dragon palace had increased tremendously. Whether the Queen of the Floating Water Tribe achieved a breakthrough or not was no longer important to him!

Of course, it was also a great thing for the Dragon Palace if she could achieve a breakthrough.

“You ‘re welcome, floating water. How much longer do you need for your breakthrough?”

Wang Xian nodded at them. He looked at Queen floating water and asked faintly.

“Dragon King, it’s extremely difficult to break through to the Heaven’s origin blessed realm. Now that my strength has improved a lot, I can easily kill existences of the same level. However, there’s still no direction for my breakthrough. ”

Queen of floating water shook her head bitterly.

With Liu Lan’s guidance and the fragment of the god of elements given to her by Wang Xian, her strength had improved a lot.

However, she still felt that there was still a gap between her and the Heaven’s origin creation stage!

“It is extremely difficult to break through to the Heaven’s origin creation stage. You will need a special opportunity. ”

Wang Xian said to her, “There is no need for you to be anxious. You can not force it! ”

“Dragon King, we have just received news from you that you are going to kill the bodies of the Heaven’s origin creator. Is this true?”

One of the elder brothers of the floating queen looked at Wang Xian and asked hopefully.

“It’s true. This time, I went to another universe. By chance and with the addition of special treasures, I killed some Heaven’s origin creator. Of course, I didn’t kill them completely. They can all be resurrected! ”

“One of them is the corpse of a water-elemental Heaven ‘s origin powerhouse. ”

As Wang Xian spoke, he did not hide anything. With a wave of his arm, the water-elemental Heaven’s origin powerhouse floated in front of him.

An extremely pure and resplendent energy gushed out from the corpse.

The energy from just one corpse made the hearts of the floating queen and the rest palpitate. They had the urge to worship it.

This was a high-level suppression!

“Dragon King, can you…”

The Floating Queen’s brother opened his mouth and revealed an excited expression. He couldn’t help but open his mouth.

However, before he could finish his sentence, Wang Xian shook his head.

“Although the fragment of the god of elements that I gave to floating water previously is not as good as this corpse, it is still a great fortune for a powerhouse at the peak of the universe dominator. The value of this corpse is very high. I can use it to nurture the disciples of the Dragon Palace so that they can make a breakthrough in other universes. ”

“There will be a limit to the investment. Furthermore, with the current strength of the Dragon Palace, it will be easy for them to exterminate the Phoenix clan. ”

Wang Xian sat there and spoke with confidence!

His words shocked queen floating water and her two brothers.

Following which, they fell silent.

They knew that the Dragon King had given them enough resources and treasures.

Just because of that one condition, it was not worth it for the Dragon King to give them such a valuable corpse of a heavenly yuan creator.

“In a thousand years, there will be a trade conference. At that time, other Heavenly Yuan creator powerhouses will also take out some treasures. When the time comes for the trade, I will use these corpses to exchange for resources. There are no restrictions on the types of resources. Divine herbs, divine fruits, and divine pills are all available. The one with the highest price will get them. ”

“When the time comes, the only ones competing with you might be the Saints. ”

Wang Xian spoke to them.

“Dragon King, can we give you a sum of resources for the trade now?”

One of the elder brothers of the floating queen hesitated for a moment before asking.

“With our relationship, of course we can. However, the value of the resources must be equal to this corpse. You should understand this equality. I can sell it to you in advance, but I won’t give you too much discount! ”

Wang Xian thought for a moment and nodded.Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Thank you, Dragon King. We will definitely give you the resources that you are satisfied with!”

The two brothers of the Queen of the floating waters immediately said.

The Queen of the floating waters stood there and bowed.

“Floating waters, you should know about cultivation. Don’t feel too much pressure. Even if you can’t break through this calamity, I can guarantee that your celestial nation will not decline. It can be considered a good karma! ” Wang Xian saw the expression of the floating water queen and spoke to her!

“Thank you, Dragon King! ”

This sentence made the floating water queen feel slightly relieved.

“Thank you, Dragon King. Our Celestial Nation will never forget today’s kindness! ”

The two brothers of the floating water queen also knelt down gratefully and bowed!

“We are all creatures from the same universe. Go and prepare. Calm your mind. It’s best if you can break through. It’s fine if you can’t!”

Wang Xian waved his hand at them.

“It’s really hard to break through the Heaven’s origin blessed realm. If I have to break through this realm, how hard would it be? would it be hard to break through for the rest of my life?”

Wang Xian looked at the background of the floating queen and mumbled.

He was now at level seven of the universe’s ruler. His strength was at the beginner level.

Level eight of the ruler corresponded to the level of control.

The ninth level of the ruler corresponded to the level of Great Dao.

The peak of the ruler corresponded to the level of chaos.

Wang Xian thought for a moment and smiled. He did not have any restrictions to be able to possess the combat strength of the chaos level. An expert at this level should be almost invincible, right?

There was nothing to worry about.

As for whether there was anyone above the chaos level, that was too far away!
