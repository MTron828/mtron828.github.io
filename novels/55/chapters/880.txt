“Let’s Go!”

After walking out of the mercenary group, Wang Xian and the rest went straight to a restaurant. They rented a few rooms and ordered some food.

The buildings in the supernatural continent usually had five to six floors and were about twenty meters tall. They were exceptionally sturdy.

In every town or city, there would be four to five huge towers. Those towers were used to look at the distant towers to stabilize the formation and defend against flying demonic beasts.

“Dragon Two, Dragon Three, you guys are a little old. You guys have passed the age of recruitment for the Demon Hunters Academy!”

Wang Xian sat on the table and swept his gaze across the ten people beside him.

The names used in the past were too troublesome. Wang Xian named them from Dragon one to Dragon Ten.

Gu Qingwen was dragon one.

Dragon two, dragon three were two middle-aged men. They were already over sixty years old!

On the transcendence continent, those in their sixties were middle-aged men, and those below fifty were young men.

Those who had reached transcendence would have a lifespan of five hundred years. Those below forty were considered very young.

“Yes, leader. If you enter the Demon Hunter Academy, we can only wait outside. We can wait until we finish the mission together!”

The two middle-aged men nodded and said bitterly.

“Dragon King, in the past, I didn’t have the confidence to enter the Demon Hunter Academy. Now, I have 80% confidence!”

Long Yi’s face was full of fighting spirit. “With the Divine Dragon Bloodline, our current strength has greatly increased. We can’t say that we’re invincible among the same level, but we’re definitely not a match for them!”

Long Er, Long San, and Long Yi were all at transcendent level 3, while Long Yi and the others were at transcendent level 2.

In the past, the Holy Glory mercenary group was at Level One Silver Star.

Long Yi was now around 30 years old. His talent was considered to be at the genius level.

The rest of them were around 38 or 40 years old. They barely qualified for the Demon Hunter College.

After becoming a drakonid and possessing the bloodline of the Divine Dragon, their abilities had improved tremendously.

“Let’s see tomorrow. It would be best if we could join!”

Wang Xian nodded slowly.

The next morning, Wang Xian woke up early.

After a simple meal, the group of people brought along the badge of the Celestial Phoenix mercenary group and headed towards the square.

“Quick, quick, let’s hurry over!”

“Son, remember what I told you. You must be careful. Survival is more important. Forget it if you can’t complete the assessment!”

“I wonder what the assessment will be this year. Last year’s assessment was equivalent to a 5-star bronze rank mission. I hope it won’t be so difficult this year!”

Early in the morning, the surrounding people hurriedly walked towards the square. Some brought their children along, while some looked excited.

Those who did not participate in the assessment were prohibited from entering the square!

A sign was placed at the entrance of the square. A middle-aged man stood there.

On the shoulder of the middle-aged man stood a black crow. The Crow’s eyes were earthy yellow and it looked very strange.

“We want to participate in the assessment!”

Wang Xian and the rest arrived. Long Yi said to the middle-aged man.

“Enter!”

The middle-aged man said coldly.

The nine of them immediately walked towards the square.

“Brother, I’m the Deputy Leader of the torrent mercenary group. I’m sending my son to participate in this assessment...”.

“Those who don’t take the assessment, shut up. Those who take the assessment, go inside!”

“This...”

“The torrent mercenary group is a two-star gold mercenary group. It’s a famous and powerful mercenary group in our Holy Sea Town!”

“What’s the use of that? Does the demon Hunters Academy care about a member of the gold mercenary group?”

Rustling sounds came from behind. Some young men in the square stood there, not knowing what to do.

There were also some young men gathered together, wearing the uniforms of the academy.

“There are quite a number of students from transcendence academy...”

“There are also quite a number of elite students from Saint Sea Academy!”

“There are at most 70 to 80 people from our Saint Sea Town who can join the Demon Hunter Academy. Now, there are actually so many talented students!”

At this moment, voices came from the side. They were discussing with an embarrassed expression.

Wang Xian swept his gaze over. The so-called transcendence academy, Holy Sea Academy, was considered a beginner-level cultivation academy.

Ordinary children would enter these academies to learn and cultivate systematically before breaking through to the transcendence realm.

Those who were qualified and talented could enter an intermediate-level academy, which was similar to the Demon Hunter Academy.

However, the Demon Hunter Academy was very dangerous. The chances of death were very high when one entered the academy. This was because the demon hunter and Demon Hunter was a battle.

Furthermore, there would be many life-and-death battles.

One after another, more and more youths entered the square. Very quickly, the number of youths in the square reached more than ten thousand.

“It’s Ao Xue, Qing Feng, bei Ming and the others. Their team is extremely powerful. It’s almost 100% certain that they will be able to enter the Demon Hunters Academy!”

“Ao Xue, the daughter of Vice Leader ao Tian, Qing Feng, is the third strongest among the transcendental academy’s current batch of graduates. Bei Ming and the Transcendental Academy’s current batch of graduates are ranked second. All of them possess the strength of a transcendent tier 2. Furthermore, the group of people beside them aren’t weak either. If they join forces, they will definitely be able to complete the assessment mission!”

“It would be great if I could join their team!”

“Move aside, move aside. They are walking towards the front. Let’s move aside!”

There was a small commotion at the back. Following that, Wang Xian heard the group of people at the back making a path for them.

Wang Xian turned his head in surprise and looked at the group of people walking towards the front.

There were eight people in the group. There were two women and six men.

“It’s her?”

Wang Xian frowned.

“HMM?”

A cold gaze stared at him and the woman stopped moving.

“What’s wrong, ao Xue?”

The girl beside him saw him suddenly stopping and asked in puzzlement. She followed her gaze and looked over.

“I didn’t expect to meet you here!”

Ao Xue suddenly laughed. Her smile was filled with coldness and playfulness.

“What’s wrong? Ao Xue, do you know them?”

A young man at the side raised his eyebrows. He looked at Ao Xue and swept a glance at Wang Xian.

“Yes, my sword was destroyed by him. Furthermore, they wanted to kill me. Hehe!”

Ao Xue was still smiling, but her eyes were like poisonous snakes.

“Is there such a thing?”

The young man slowly narrowed his eyes and swept his gaze across Wang Xian and the rest.

“It was yesterday!” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Ao Xue’s smile slowly disappeared. “I didn’t expect all of you to participate in the Demon Hunter College’s assessment. Very good!”

“Hehe!”

Wang Xian laughed coldly when he heard their words.

When the surrounding people heard the situation, they looked over with a face full of surprise.

“Laugh it up. Laugh it up now. No one dares to destroy my sword and still want to attack me. Let me tell you, it’s not safe outside. Be careful during the assessment!”

Ao Xue said coldly.

“Hehe, someone actually dares to bully ao Xue. Looks like there will be a few more corpses in the wild!”

The corner of a young man’s mouth curled up slightly. He held the long sword in his hand and smiled coldly.

“Scram!”

Wang Xian frowned and shouted at them coldly.
