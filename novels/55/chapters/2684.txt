2685 2685 Dragon Palace vs Tianya

“Ka Ka Ka Ka!”

Within the black hole space, the sound of law defense breaking could be heard. The four elders of the world margin sect stared blankly ahead.

When the Thorn swept over, the defense in front of them was immediately broken.

Seeing this, the four of them were completely stunned.

They were all elders of the world margin, with undying emperor level 9 battle strength. In the weaker sects, they were all pinnacle warriors.

Even though they were wary of the Dragon Palace, they didn’t pay too much attention to it.

The Dragon Palace could instantly kill an undying level 9 warrior, but if the four of them worked together, they would need at least 10 to kill them.

This would require a long battle.

However, from their point of view, they could hold on for at least 20 to 30 minutes, an hour of battle and they would be instantly defeated.

The defense in front of them could be said to have been put into full use.

Now, it was so easily broken through.

This...

“How could this thorny monster’s attack be so terrifying! ?”

A terrified voice came from elder Tianya and the other three. Their pupils constricted as they looked at the two thorny monsters in front of them, their faces filled with shock.

“Sou Sou!”

“Pu Pu!”

In the next moment, the two brambles instantly shot out brambles and pierced through them.

At such a close distance, the incomparably sharp brambles were like venomous snakes, instantly piercing through their chests.

“Ah!”

A scream came from an elder Tian Ya, his eyes wide in disbelief as he stared at his chest, his face filled with fear.

“They... They are pinnacle undying Emperor level monsters, Pinnacle Undying Emperor level, the Dragon Palace has Pinnacle Undying Emperor Level Warriors!”

The panicked voices came from the other elders, they roared and their bodies trembled.

The Dragon Palace also had Pinnacle Undying Emperor level warriors!

Hence, if the other party really wanted to kill the four of them, they had no way to resist.

“No No... Dragon Palace, how can you have a pinnacle undying emperor, you...”

An elder roared.

“Sou Sou Sou!”

At this time, the thorns that pierced through their chests started to move, instantly piercing through their bodies again, completely binding them together.

The four of them couldn’t fight back at all and were instantly subdued.

Four Sharp Thorns shot out from the four thorns, aiming at their heads.

“No, no, don’t Kill Us!”

At this moment, the four elders of the world margin sect shouted with panic on their faces.

When death came, most people would feel fear.

This was especially so for the group of high-ranking experts. They couldn’t bear to part with this bright world.

“That bastard old demon, how did he provoke the Dragon Palace? He actually made the Dragon Palace our enemy.”

While the four of them were terrified, they were also extremely furious at elder Yao.

However, they didn’t know that they didn’t put the Dragon Palace in their eyes at the beginning.

“Don’t kill him yet. Seriously injure him.”

On the command platform, Wang Xian said faintly.

“Yes, yes. Dragon King, don’t Kill Us. Don’t Kill Us. We, the world’s end, are willing to take out treasures to redeem our lives!”

When the four of them heard Wang Xian’s words, they had a glimmer of hope. They immediately shouted loudly.

“PFFT! PFFT! PFFT! PFFT! PFFT!”

As soon as they finished their words, numerous thorns landed on their heads. With their vitality, they naturally could not kill them.

Buzz

Wang Xian flew over. With a wave of his arm, he immediately cast soul capture.

“Heaven Formation, remove the black hole disturbance formation and set up an Illusion Formation!”

Wang Xian said immediately.

Boom

As soon as he said that, a wave of dragon’s might rushed directly into the mind of an elder of the world margin sect.

“Summon the Immortal Kingdom.”

Wang Xian’s voice appeared in his mind.

“Yes, yes, yes!”

The elder of the world margin said in a daze. An immortal kingdom slowly appeared at the side.

...

Wang Xian’s body trembled. A Dragon Palace appeared behind him and directly kept the immortal kingdom into the Dragon Palace.

“Bang!”

He slapped his arm and landed on his head, killing him immediately.

“What... What are you doing? What kind of sorcery is this? !”

Wang Xian’s actions caused the other three Tianya elders to show a look of despair as they shouted loudly.

However, Wang Xian did not pay any attention to them. He followed the same method and summoned all of their immortal God countries back.

These immortal God countries were huge resources to ao crab and the rest. These four immortal God countries, along with some other resources, could allow ao crab and the other devouring dragon to raise their combat strength to level nine immortal god King.

If it wasn’t for the fact that they couldn’t summon their God countries in the abyss, he would have also summoned the god countries of elder Yao and the rest of the world margin sect through this method.

“The harvest this time is pretty good.”

After killing the four elders of the world margin sect, Wang Xian’s eyes gleamed.

With four elders, he could increase the Dragon Palace’s combat strength by six immortal King Level 9 fighters. With the addition of another, there would be a total of seven.

...

There were also two abyss seeds. This trip would increase the Dragon Palace’s combat strength by nine immortal King Level 9 fighters.

“I wonder how Tian Ya will react after killing the five elders of Tian Ya.”

The corner of Wang Xian’s mouth curled up slightly.

“Dragon King, shall we start the battle next?”

Tian Cheng asked Wang Xian.

“Get all the disciples to prepare. Even if we don’t start the battle, Tian Ya will start the battle.”

Wang Xian smiled and said faintly.

Tian Cheng nodded slightly and prepared immediately!

Crack! Crack

“My amulet is broken. My amulet is actually broken.”

At the same time, a middle-aged man who was chatting with his fellow disciples on the Heaven’s end ruler suddenly had a magical pendant on his chest crack.

The middle-aged man was stunned instantly. Following that, he widened his eyes and shouted in shock.

“Eh? Senior Brother Lan? What happened to you?”

In front of him, a few middle-aged men saw the sudden change in his expression and their expressions changed. They quickly asked.

“The amulet broke. The amulet my grandfather gave me actually broke on its own.”

The middle-aged man’s face was filled with fear. He grabbed the amulet with his hand, his eyes widened. “This is the amulet my grandfather gave me. Grandfather’s Kingdom of God can sense it when in danger. The Kingdom of God will send a force to protect me. Grandfather said that once he dies, this amulet will break. Grandfather...”. ...”

The middle aged man shouted. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The other middle aged men were stunned too. They looked at each other and gulped, their faces filled with fear.

They all knew that their senior Lan’s grandfather was an elder of the world’s End, an undying god King Level 9 existence.

“Senior LAN, report to the sect master and Patriarch immediately.”

One of them hurriedly said to him.

“Try it, sect master, Patriarch!”

The middle-aged man gradually recovered his senses and directly rushed to the front of the horizon ruler, shouting loudly.
