Translator: 549690339

“Damn it, they want to fight me! ”

When the Holy Father saw Wang Xian facing his attack and didn’t Dodge at all.

When he wanted to fight him head-on, his expression changed drastically.

He was confident that he could kill Lin Niu. However, now that there was another Heaven’s origin manifestation powerhouse, he was definitely not their match!

Under such circumstances, if he continued to fight, he would definitely be the one to die.

He had to escape!

However, if he wanted to escape, he had to get rid of their attacks.

Boom

At this moment, Wang Xian’s dragon claws collided with the staff in his hand.

A terrifying energy surged out in all directions.

The rain in the sky was instantly evaporated.

Even the seawater below had been annihilated by the energy and disappeared.

Wang Xian’s dragon claws instantly turned into a bloody mess. Each of his claws looked as if they were about to fall off.

However, the Holy Father didn’t feel good either.

Their battle was purely close combat. Their main bodies were the first to suffer the impact of the energy.

The arm that he was holding the staff in his hand collapsed immediately. His flesh and blood disappeared, leaving behind only his pale bones!

It also looked abnormally tragic!

However, at this moment, the five elements millstone followed closely behind Wang Xian.

The five-colored divine dragon head attacked him.

The distance between the two parties was too close.

He was already fighting with the Kylin Bull and was prepared to end the battle quickly. Therefore, he was heavily injured.

Now that Wang Xian had suddenly attacked him, there was no way for him to dodge.

After dodging Wang Xian’s attack, the attacks from the five elements grinding also landed on his body.

Boom

The Five Elements Dragon head landed on his body directly.

The Holy Father’s eyes were about to split open as his entire body emitted a dazzling white light.

He took out a divine herb and placed it directly into his body!

Boom

The Five Elements Dragon head landed on his body and the spot on his chest emitted a powerful radiance!

A shield of light with patterns on it blocked the attack in front of him.

However, even though it blocked the attack of the Five Elements Dragon Head, its body fell down violently.

When Lin Niu saw this scene, his gaze froze.

“Fight, don’t you want to fight? Hahaha, let’s see who dies today. F * ck, I’ll let you be arrogant! ”

Lin Niu raised his head slightly, and the blood-red energy all over his body began to gather.

Behind him, the shadow of a Demon God appeared.

The Demon God slowly spread his arms and embraced the Holy Father!

The threat of death once again enveloped the Holy Father.

The Holy Father saw the attacks one after another, and he roared furiously.

The magic staff that had fallen to the side instantly arrived above him. The magic staff turned into a defensive barrier and wrapped around him.

Boom

The Demon God’s embrace wrapped around the holy father. A great terror was happening inside.

Countless demons were tearing at him from within!

Wang Xian moved his body and waved his arm. The space lock of the Starfield fragment was activated.

At the same time, stars appeared one after another, forming a line that connected the city!

Buzz

The energy of the Demon God’s embrace started to dissipate slowly. Wang Xian waved his arm and the stars that contained terrifying power attacked the Holy Father!

“This… foster father, foster father is here!”

From the moment Wang Xian arrived to the moment he launched his attack, everything happened in an instant.

Tianci, who was lying on the body of the Unicorn Ox, saw Wang Xian’s figure. His eyes widened and his face revealed a look of pleasant surprise.

When he saw the terrifying stars lined up in a row with no end in sight, his face was filled with shock.

His foster father was definitely a powerhouse in the Heaven’s origin realm.

A top-notch powerhouse in the world.

“All of you deserve to die, all of you deserve to die. If you dare to kill me, I will spread the news that all of you have obtained the ultimate treasure in the Heaven’s origin realm. ”

When the Holy Father saw the terrifying attacks coming at him one after another, his miserable body trembled violently as he shouted loudly!

“Kill him with all your strength! ”

Wang Xian stared at the Holy Father with a cold expression in his eyes. Since he had discovered tianci, he could not let him go no matter what would happen next.

On the contrary, after killing him, he would resurrect in his own universe. Even if he were to rush over, he would need a long time.

As for saying that he would announce TIANCPs matter to the public.

Wang Xian felt that the possibility was very small.

Now, kill him and Buy More Time!

As long as Tianci grew up, he would be unafraid of anyone. It would be impossible for other powerhouses to snatch the ultimate treasure of Tianyuan from him!

“Yes, Boss!”

Lin Niu immediately replied loudly. Energy began to brew on his body!

When the attacks from the planets were over, Lin Niu would launch another full-powered attack!

When the Holy Father heard Wang Xian’s words, he saw the terrifying stars.

He sensed his body and let out a furious roar!

With a move of his palm, a special ray of light appeared in his hand.

This long ray of light instantly flew into the distance.

It was so fast that Wang Xian and the rest could not react in time.

When the stars were about to land on his body, his body disappeared without a trace!

When Wang Xian saw this scene, his eyes narrowed slightly.

He knew that existences at this level had some means of escape.

Otherwise, they would not dare to step into the six paths universe!

However, it was a pity that he was severely injured when he was attacked by Lin Niu in the beginning!

His strength was now less than 50% !

“You want to escape! ”

“Chase after him! ”

Wang Xian growled at Lin Niu and chased after the line of light!

“Just you wait, just you wait. The Ultimate Treasure of Tianyuan belongs to me, belongs to me! ”

The Holy Father attached himself to the line of light and escaped quickly!

His face was filled with malevolence!

He still had a chance after this failure. He had to get his hands on the Heavenly Yuan Destiny Treasure!

However, at this moment, the sound of collision suddenly sounded.

In front of him, a five elements energy blocked the fast flying of the thin thread!

When the Holy Father saw this scene, his expression changed slightly!

He recovered from the thin line’s state, waved the staff in his hand, and smashed it forward!

“Boom!”

An invisible energy barrier appeared, and under his attack, it trembled slightly.

“Boom!”

Seeing the energy barrier trembling, his arm emitted a radiance that was transmitted to the staff, and he gritted his teeth and continued to attack!

“Crack Crack Crack! ”

Cracks started to appear on the energy shield!

He raised the staff in his hand again and continued to attack!

“If you want to attack, attack. If you want to escape, can you escape?”

At this moment, Wang Xian and Lin Niu were standing on top of a star at the back. They were flying towards him rapidly!

Boom

Wang Xian was holding the five elements millstone in his hand. With a wave of his arm, the five elements millstone turned into a terrifying killing weapon and smashed towards him!
