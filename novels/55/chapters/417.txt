Chapter 418: The Youngest Inborn Expert

“No matter how insanely gifted you are, you are still going to meet your end here!”

On a deserted road in Rivertown, Xiao Shisan mumbled to himself after seeing the video call disengage.

“What a shame! Now that you have offended Madam... A young hero?”

Xiao Shisan looked at the corpses around him and instructed the few people with him to clean things up.

That Madam was the daughter of the family head of a first-class family in Shang Jing. That first-class family was among the most elite first-class forces, with close to ten Inborn experts.

One could even say that they were one of the strongest existences beneath a Sacred Sect.

At this moment, her status in the family had risen because of his son. That young master had talents that triumphed the entire Sacred Clan and had been widely regarded as the future successor. He was also the most outstanding disciple that was believed to have the highest chance of attaining the level of their Laozu.

In the entire Xiao Clan, that Madam also had incredible influence.

If she wished to kill a brat, that brat would die no matter how insanely gifted he was.

...

“What’s the matter? What happened to Xiao Ran?”

In the afternoon, Wang Xian saw Liu Mengxin, whose eyes had turned red and swollen from crying, in the living room when he entered the villa. His attention shifted to Xiao Ran who appeared pale and was lying on the sofa.

Sun Lingxiu was sitting by his side while administering treatment. Clearly, his injuries weren’t light.

“He was ambushed and forcefully executed the technique Sui Huang taught him. His body suffered huge damages but this isn’t a serious issue. He should recover in five to six days!” Sun Lingxiu turned to Wang Xian and explained. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“He was ambushed?”

Wang Xian’s eyebrows knitted together.

The Underworld still wasn’t aware that Xiao Ran was his disciple. At the very least, he barely paid any attention to this disciple.

Other than giving him the cultivation arts from the Fire God Denomination, the Tranquil Blue Heavenly Flame and some elixir pills, he had basically not played a part in his cultivation path.

He didn’t know how to teach his disciple. Even his cultivation knowledge was gained from joining Guan Shuqing when Sui Huang was teaching.

Nonetheless, he was very satisfied with this disciple of his.

He was resilient and willing to endure hardship. Other than his meals, he spent all his time on cultivation.

Whenever he saw him, he would just address him as “Master” softly. At the same time, he would always make him tea and bring a cup to him.

There’s nothing Wang Xian would pick on about this disciple.

“Who would ambush a teenager for no reason? Moreover, with Xiao Ran’s current strength of Half-step to Inborn, he wouldn’t be injured unless he was fighting experts at the same level or higher...”

Wang Xian squinted his eyes and a flash of killing intent gleamed in them.

No matter what, Xiao Ran was his disciple. Although he was just an unofficial disciple, it would still be a slap to his face if his disciple was ambushed by others.

“They are from our family, the Xiao Clan!” Liu Mengxin looked at Wang Xian with his red and swollen eyes and walked towards him.

“Xiao Clan? The Sacred Clan, Xiao Clan?”

Wang Xian was taken aback and sank into deep thought.

Xiao Clan was one of the three main Sacred Clans and one of the five main Sacred Clans in China. They had strength equivalent to other sacred sects.

So the assassination when I first encountered them was sent by a Sacred Clan? A Sacred Clan is pursuing and assassinating two kids?

At that time, Wang Xian hadn’t asked about the reasons.

“Mengxin, why is the Xiao Clan pursuing and assassinating you guys?”

Wang Xian glanced at the unconscious Xiao Ran and placed his hand on him. Streams of Azure Dragon’s energy flowed into his body and started healing his injuries.

“Our aunt is trying to kill us. Our mother isn’t the first wife to our father and we have always been living outside the Xiao Clan. Subsequently, brother reached Martial Artist Level 3 in just a year. Seeing that brother has strong talents, father brought us back to the Sacred Clan. However, that aunt has always targeted us. The resources that had been allocated to us were all snatched away by her. Subsequently, our father died in an accident and that aunt’s actions got even more brazen.

“Our mother couldn’t stand her taking away our resources and therefore went to reason with the Elders in the clan. However, our food was poisoned after she got back. When my mother learned about it, she decided to bring us away from this perilous place. However, we had not expected to be pursued by assassins. Our mother was killed while protecting us. The last time we saw Brother Wang Xian, we had already been running for a year!” Liu Mengxin clenched her small hands as she spoke furiously.

It might not be just because of your mother. Xiao Ran is probably a factor too! Wang Xian thought to himself after hearing Liu Mengxin’s explanation.

In large families, it would be similar to the royal race in the past. Heirs would resort to unscrupulous acts to increase their chances of succeeding the throne. Xiao Ran’s gifts had probably encroached upon the interests of some people.

To be able to reach Martial Artist Level 3 without any resources in a year, he must be really gifted. As long as he had sufficient resources, he would definitely still become the most dazzling star even when compared across the Sacred Clans.

The only shame was that his mother was just another woman his father had outside the clan and she wasn’t the first wife.

“The quarrels within your family have nothing to do with me. However, it involves me when my disciple is harmed!”

Wang Xian gave a cold smirk and looked at the unconscious Xiao Ran on the sofa.

Let this incompetent master of yours help you for the very last time. You still have to rely on yourself in the future!

Wang Xian had made up his mind. He would be using elixir pills to raise his cultivation realm to the Inborn Realm before bringing him to the Xiao Clan and demanding a fair explanation.

Head to the Sacred Clan and demand a fair explanation.

“Master!”

At this instant, Xiao Ran, who was lying on the sofa, opened his eyes suddenly. He squeezed out a shy smile and struggled to sit up.

Wang Xian didn’t stop him, patted him on the shoulders and said, “Have a good rest today. I’ll increase your strength tomorrow before going back with you to demand a fair explanation!”

Xiao Ran’s face turned red from agitation. Tears streamed down uncontrollably as he thanked Wang Xian profusely. “Thank you, master. Thank you, master!”

Wang Xian smiled and caressed his head before turning around and leaving in the direction of the floating island.

After all, Xiao Ran was still just a fifteen-year-old kid. His life had been tumultuous and even worse than his and Xiao Yu’s in the past. At the very least, Wang Xian and Xiao Yu wouldn’t have to worry about their safety.

Arriving at the spiritual medicine garden on the floating island, Wang Xian looked around and gathered the spiritual medicine required to refine Level 4 elixir pills. After which, he turned to the two Level 6 spiritual medicines.

The Green Fruit Tree and the White Valley Lotus.

The fruits from the spiritual tree, Green Fruit Tree, were Level 5 spiritual medicine or the equivalent of Level 4 elixir pills. As for the White Valley Lotus, it could match Level 5 elixir pills.

That was similar to the Devil’s Skeletal Pill which could greatly increase the strength of even Inborn experts.

Clearly, Devil’s Skeletal Pills weren’t suitable for Xiao Ran and would only cause side effects. However, he could consume a Level 6 spiritual medicine directly.

Consuming four to five Level 4 elixir pills and several lotus seeds from the Level 6 spiritual medicine, having his conception vessel and governing vessel cleared, together with the body refining effects of the Dragon Ball, Xiao Ran could definitely reach the Inborn Realm.

This was an Inborn expert raised by exhausting immense resources and wealth.

A fifteen-year-old Inborn expert. Even the Sacred Clan would be completely shocked by him!

Wang Xian’s lips curved up slightly. Subsequently, he started refining Level 4 elixir pills.

After the massive refining session over this period, the entire spiritual medicine garden had basically emptied out with only a few tufts of spiritual medicine and grass remaining.

He had to start breeding his own or looking for other spiritual medicine and grass.
