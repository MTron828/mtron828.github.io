3274 Three thousand, two hundred and seventy-three godly dragons had fallen

“Hong! Hong! Hong!”

“I can’t accept this. I’m a pure-bred godly dragon. To be able to stand at the top of the universe, that cowardly Devil Dragon King actually didn’t make a move to save me!”

Within Kun region, Fire Dragon Master roared somewhat crazily.

His body was covered with many tragic wounds, and each wound was deep into his bone marrow.

Right now, his combat strength was less than 50% of his peak.

Facing the terrifying attacks, he had no way to resist.

Despair!

Death was waiting for him!

His eyes were filled with fury.

If the Demon Dragon King and the others were willing to attack him, he still had a chance of survival.

But now, everything was over.

“Die!”

An Lie’s figure flashed and appeared behind the Fire Dragon Lord’s head. A terrifying energy heavily struck his head.

“Boom!”

A muffled explosion sounded. The Fire Dragon Lord opened his eyes wide, and large amounts of blood flowed out.

His dragon head shook twice, and his body slowly fell downwards.

Tian Chen and the others in the surroundings saw it, and their eyes flashed with a cold expression.

“Wu Wu!”

Xiao Lan let out a low roar, and the Kun domain disappeared.

When the void of the dark space disappeared, this piece of starry sky once again appeared in front of everyone.

“What!”

“Fire Dragon Master was killed!”

“This… Fire Dragon Master died!”

The Great Beings of water dragon palace were shocked when they saw fire dragon master’s body floating in the sky.

“Roar, good kill, good kill, they want to kill us!”

Some of the Great Beings of Water Dragon Palace roared excitedly.

“Damn it, what a waste, waste, a universe Knight Level 6 power, he was killed by the Dragon Palace and Water Dragon Palace in such a short time!”

Devil Dragon Emperor saw this scene and his face was extremely ugly, he couldn’t help but roar.

However, the death of a universe Knight Level 6 pure-blooded dragon shocked him.

Fire Dragon Emperor was much stronger than him.

Sou

The sky array moved and put away fire dragon emperor’s body and his true treasures.

Peng! Peng! Peng

At this time, there was a loud crash in the sky.

Everyone looked over, their eyes shining with shock.

Compared to the battle between Fire Dragon Emperor and the others, the battle between Devil Dragon Emperor and Dragon Emperor was even more terrifying.

“Not good, our Devil Dragon Emperor has been completely suppressed. Our Devil Dragon Emperor is injured!”

In the three dragon palaces, the faces of the experts from the devil dragon lineage darkened when they saw this scene.

At this moment, there were many wounds on the Devil Dragon Emperor’s body, and large amounts of blood flowed out.

He was completely suppressed and beaten.

The Fire Dragon Lord had just been killed, so their Devil Dragon Emperor wouldn’t be…

They didn’t dare to imagine it.

If something happened to the Devil Dragon Emperor, then they would be completely finished.

“It’s impossible for a divine dragon of the same level to kill his opponent, even if the Dragon King has a powerful defensive treasure. It’s impossible, completely impossible!”

The Devil Dragon King shook his head and roared.

He firmly believed that his father would never be killed by the Dragon King.

At this moment, everyone in the four dragon palaces raised their heads and looked up at the sky.

“Hehe, do these guys think that I can’t kill you after entering the Dragon Palace?”

An lie glanced around and saw that all the divine dragons were staring at the battle in the sky. His eyes sparkled.

He looked at the Demon Dragon King and disappeared in an instant.

“Damn it! I Can’t fight with him anymore. I have to go back to the Dark World of Devil Dragon. Otherwise, I might be exhausted to death!”

“That defensive true treasure on his body is too powerful!”

Devil Dragon Emperor growled in a low voice.

“Let’s fight it out. Even if my injuries are more serious, I have to go back to the Dark World of Devil Dragon!”

He growled with blood-red eyes and stared at the sky.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

He let out a wild roar. The skeletons and the demon dragon pearl surrounded him. The dark laws on his body condensed into demonic flames.

“Law projection, Demon Dragon Destruction!”

Demon Dragon Emperor let out a wild roar and flew directly in the direction of the dark world of the Demon Dragon.

The streaks of demonic flames condensed into the virtual image of the demon dragon, burning and corroding the entire void.

“It’s time to go all out!”

Wang Xian saw the violent energy on the Devil Dragon Emperor’s body and stared at his dragon eyes.

“Then let’s Fight!”

He sensed the life force fluid in the ancient lamp. There was not much life force fluid left.

However, he was still in his peak condition.

“Kill!”

Wang Xian roared.

“Law form: eight-sided Dragon Pillar!”

“Roar!”

The eight-sided dragon pillars was Wang Xian’s strongest attack. It was also the first law form of the nine transformations of the divine dragon when he stepped into the realm of a universe knight.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

The moment the law form was unleashed, dragon pillars appeared in all directions.

As he was in the state of the Divine Light Dragon, each dragon pillar had a divine light dragon coiled around it.

Eight Dragon Pillars and eight divine light dragons sealed off all directions.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

The eight divine dragons roared, their gazes locked onto the attacking Devil Dragon Emperor as they charged forward.

“Kill Kill Kill!”

Devil Dragon Emperor felt the terrifying energy on the eight dragon pillars, he gritted his teeth and continued charging forward.

Light and darkness collided.

Buzz

The next moment, it was as if the entire void was engulfed. A terrifying energy vortex formed at the center of the collision.

In the Energy Vortex, Devil Dragon Emperor’s body appeared and continued to charge towards the sky.

Wang Xian also swayed his huge body and charged forward.

Bang Bang Bang

There was another violent collision. Wang Xian waved his dragon claws and clawed at Devil Dragon Emperor.

Devil Dragon Emperor also extended his Dragon Claw and met the attack head-on.

“Bang, Bang, Bang!”

It was another physical confrontation. This time, Devil Dragon Emperor was even fiercer. He did not care about the injuries on his body.

Wang Xian did not have any scruples either. His Dragon Claw and Dragon Tail attacked one after another.

In an instant, fresh blood splattered everywhere. A large number of dragon scales fell down.

The entire battle was unusually intense.

The vitality fluid in the ancient lamp on Wang Xian’s body was depleting rapidly. Soon, it was completely depleted.

This time around, Wang Xian had brought all the vitality fluid with him. Once it was completely depleted, the defense of the ancient lamp would disappear completely.

“Scram, scram, scram, scram!”

However, this incomparably intense battle caused Devil Dragon Emperor to be a little terrified. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

The injuries on his body were getting more and more serious.

Even though he possessed the body of a divine dragon and had a strong recovery ability, his entire body was stained with blood under this collision.

A pair of dragon horns were completely broken, and a large number of cracks appeared on the dragon head.

As for his body, almost half of his dragon scales had fallen off.

Now that he had one life, it was possible that he only had half of it left.

“I’ve used up all the vitality fluid!”

However, at this moment, Wang Xian also sensed that the vitality fluid had completely disappeared. The fire shield defense on his body had also completely disappeared.
