Chapter 446: Sacred Sect: Dragon Sect (6)

“I’m sorry! I’m not participating in the ranking of the Outstanding Young Heroes Chart!”

When the crowd heard Wang Xian, they were taken aback.

“What’s happening? Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown is not participating in the Outstanding Young Heroes Chart?”

“This... What a turn of events! With his strength, why isn’t he participating? It is almost certain that Miracle Doctor Wang would rank in the top three or four. With such results, he could get at least seven to eight hundred spiritual stones at the end of the competition after considering how popular the Outstanding Young Heroes Competition is this year!”

“At this moment, the total bets placed for the competition in the Underworld have reached several hundreds of billions. The top five would each receive at least eight billion. Changing money to spiritual stones would also reap him immense resources. Why isn’t he participating?”

“Could it be that he’s afraid after seeing so many experts? This isn’t his style at all!”

To the astonishment of the crowd, Wang Xian had declared he wouldn’t participate. As a result, the crowd was curious and discussing.

The young lord of Sea Serpent Island was also surprised by Wang Xian’s decision. He stared coldly at Wang Xian and asked, “What’s the matter? Are you afraid? This isn’t your style at all!”

Wang Xian smiled plainly and replied, “Hehe! Do I need a reason to not participate? Naturally, you can think whatever you wish!”

“Haha! Great! Regardless, the opportunity for us to fight will be here soon! Rest assured, it won’t be long!” the young lord of Sea Serpent Island said with hidden meaning behind his words. Subsequently, he looked to the rest of the crowd.

Ka ka ka!

Suddenly, a layer of frost formed over the surface of the arena. The surrounding temperature was also decreasing rapidly.

A stream of chilling aura emanated from the young lord of Sea Serpent Island. As he moved his hand, a short blade appeared in it.

The short blade was white as snow and was emitting layers and layers of white fog.

This wasn’t hot air but chilling air.

At his chest, a frosty round disc appeared gradually. It started turning and his body started turning white.

“I’m the champion of all promising young talents! Who isn’t convinced?”

Chilling cold aura swept towards the surroundings. Some of the young men instantly paled.

“You or that monk are both qualified to fight with me!”

The lips of the young lord of Sea Serpent Island curved into a smirk as he emitted chilling aura.

“Amitabha. You are really the son of the Lord of Sea Serpent Island. With such an incredible father, the son couldn’t be any weaker.”

The Flower Monk stared at the young lord of Sea Serpent Island, the short blade in his hand, and the round disc at his chest. In his eyes, a tinge of fear flashed.

Hehe.

The ominous-looking young man stared at the young lord of Sea Serpent Island. In the end, he shook his head and said, “If you took down the frosty round disc on your chest, you wouldn’t be a match for me!”

“Haha! Just shut your mouth if you don’t dare to step forward.”

The young sea serpent island master stared calmly at the ominous-looking young man and continued, “Be careful or you won’t walk out of here alive if you are spouting too much nonsense!”

The ominous-looking young man frowned and snorted, “You can be first this time. I’ll be second. Ling Sha! Are you convinced?”

“Amitabha. Since young Palace Master Fu likes to be second, the poor monk here shall be third then!” Flower Monk smiled gently and answered plainly while moving the string of buddha beads with his finger.

“I shall be fourth then! Anyone not convinced?”

After the top three of the Outstanding Young Heroes Chart had been decided, one of the Saints from the Dark Sect looked nonchalantly at the crowd. In one of his hands, he was playing with a dagger.

“I shall be fifth. Anyone not convinced?” Xiao Ran took a step forward and looked at the crowd.

“The aura from the young lord of Sea Serpent Island is too terrifying. Even the Flower Monk and the ominous-looking young man admitted that they wouldn’t be a match for him. He’s definitely deserving of the title of the champion of the supreme talents!”

“It is clear that the ominous-looking young man knows Flower Monk. There’s no problem at all with them ranking second and third.”

“The leader of the duo from the Dark Sect has insane mastery of the flying dagger. Ranking fourth is also not a problem!”

“Although Xiao Ran from Xiao Clan is young, he possesses a Heavenly Flame and Inborn Spiritual Weapon. Moreover, no one would probably have doubts about him ranking fifth after seeing his battling strength!”

The crowd started commenting after seeing the supreme talents stepping forward and claiming their spots on the chart.

“I shall be sixth. Anyone not convinced?”

The number two on the Outstanding Young Heroes Chart from some time ago stepped forward with a long face and announced this to the crowd.

“I’ll be seventh. Anyone not convinced?”

“I’ll be eighth. Anyone not convinced?”

“I’ll be ninth. Anyone not convinced?”

Emotionless calls reverberated across the field and the Inborn level supreme talents jumped into the arena after claiming their spots.

This happened until the eighteenth spot. Eighteen Inborn Realm supreme talents stood in the arena, emitting terrifying aura.

“Anyone not convinced?”

The young lord of Sea Serpent Island looked at the Inborn supreme talents around him. He lifted his head proudly and asked loudly again, “I shall be the champion of the supreme talents. Anyone not convinced?”

The disposition of a champion emanated from his body.

The remaining Inborn supreme talents pulled a long face and lifted their heads slightly.

Regardless, being ranked on the Outstanding Young Heroes Chart this year was also a testament to their strength.

“Great. Since no one has anything to say...!”

The young lord of Sea Serpent Island squinted his eyes and looked in the direction of Wang Xian. His eyes were beaming with killing intent.

In the arena, five other Inborn level supreme talents looked towards Wang Xian.

Now that the Outstanding Young Heroes Competition had ended, they knew that it was time for them to make a move.

Below the stage, some sects and families were also eager to strike.

They could also tell that the young lord of Sea Serpent Island had accepted the mission from the Medical Saint Sect. However, this didn’t mean that the rewards would belong to them.

Whoever could kill Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown would receive the greatest remuneration.

“The ranking of the Outstanding Young Heroes Chart is over. Get ready! Tsk! This Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown is really arrogant to kill the people from the Medical Saint Sect on the spot. Now that Medical Saint Sect is willing to offer such an insane remuneration, many experts from various sects will be eager to strike. Even Saint-class forces won’t be an exception.”

Below the stage, the families and sects who had received the message were exhilarated.

The best show after the Outstanding Young Heroes Chart ranking was finally about to begin.

At this very moment, many people were looking at the ranking through the Underworld website.

[F*ck! Why didn’t Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown participate? I bet five million on him!]

[The young lord of Sea Serpent Island has declared himself as the champion. The short sword and the round disc on him should both be insanely powerful Inborn Spiritual Weapons. The only disappointment is Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown not participating!]

[Is Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown afraid of embarrassing himself after seeing multiple powerful characters on the Outstanding Young Heroes Chart this year?]

[He’s probably pondering how he could handle his own matters at this point in time. He’s a dead man after killing the most outstanding disciple of Medical Saint Sect in this generation!]

[F*ck! Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown dared to kill the people from Medical Saint Sect. Why wouldn’t he participate? The ten million I placed on him was forfeited directly!]

[The Outstanding Young Heroes Competition has finally ended. Although there wasn’t a fight at the end, the competition this year was truly satisfying!]

[The supreme talents must have a rough idea of their strength and therefore didn’t express opinions against those who were stronger than them. Because of this, they didn’t fight at the end. The only disappointment has to be Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown. In the end, he chose to be a coward!]

The Underworld was discussing fervently on the web. As to the fact that Wang Xian didn’t participate, many people were shocked and infuriated.

It was especially so for those who had placed bets on Wang Xian earlier. They even hurled vulgarities at him.

If you want to be a coward at the very end, what the hell are you in Huashan for? You might as well just cower in the corner at home!!

You still dare to kill the people from Medical Saint Sect without knowing what’s best for you?

Some people were cursing. However, there were others from some families and sects that were watching the live stream. They were waiting for the end of the competition and the death of Miracle Doctor Wang.

“Today, I want to see his corpse!” The members of the Medical Saint Sect stared emotionlessly at the live stream.

“We are not convinced!” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Suddenly, just as the crowd was about to make their move, a unison cold snort reverberated across the space!
