Chapter 1521: 1521 Holy Medicine Clinic’s priest Wang

“Hall master, this young master Wang wants to join our clinic. Young master Wang is very strong!”

On the top floor of the Holy Medicine Clinic, the old lady saw that leader Yun Gu and the rest were about to leave. When she saw the hall master looking over, she immediately asked.

“Are there any rookies who are pretty strong?”

Before the Hall Master could reply, a young man walked out from the room. He held some light spiritual herbs in his hands and said, “Master, I am in need of an assistant. If you are pretty strong, follow me!”

As the young man spoke, he looked at the old woman, Old Hu, Wang Xian, and the rest.

“Huh?”

The old woman was slightly stunned when she heard the young man’s words. She looked at him in astonishment.

“Alright, Alright. Chief Tang, it’s the young man behind you, right? Leave him to Tianguang!”

The hall master nodded and instructed the old woman.

Wang Xian did not look at the young man nor the Hall Master of the Holy Medicine Hall. His gaze was still fixed on Captain Yun Gu and the rest who came to their side.

Captain Yun gu frowned slightly when he saw Wang Xian staring at his abdomen.

However, he didn’t say anything. Since the other party was from the Holy Medicine Clinic, he had to give him some face.

“I can remove the bone corrosion poison from this gentleman. Do you need me to help you remove it?”

At this moment, Wang Xian looked at Captain Yun Gu and the rest who were about to head downstairs and asked directly.

“Huh?”

They were about to leave when they heard Wang Xian’s voice. They were stunned.

Captain Yun gu frowned and looked at Wang Xian with a hint of doubt in his eyes.

The head and the young man beside him were also stunned.

“Hey, what nonsense are you spouting? Even my master couldn’t solve the bone corrosion poison. If you can solve it, don’t you understand the rules of the radiant priest? “If you’re not confident, don’t treat people. Otherwise, you’ll harm others and yourself. How dare you speak so arrogantly at such a young age? HMPH!”

The young man immediately frowned and shouted at Wang Xian.

“Young man, you’re still a newborn calf, aren’t you?”

Captain Yun gu squeezed out a smile and said faintly.

“Head, young master Wang is very, very strong. I’ll send you a message. I don’t know if you’ve received it yet!”

However, at this moment, the old lady looked at Wang Xian. After hesitating for a moment, she spoke to the hall master again.

“Oh?”

The hall master revealed a look of surprise. The old lady had emphasized that she was very strong twice in a row. At the very least, she was stronger than her.

He knew the old lady’s strength very well. She was at the half-step void interpretation stage. She was not strong, but she was not weak either.

To be able to make her emphasize that she was very strong, then...

He sized up Wang Xian with a face full of astonishment.

When Captain Yun Gu heard the old lady’s words, he was also slightly stunned. He looked at Wang Xian who had an indifferent expression and asked with uncertainty, “You... can you really cure the bone corrosion poison in my body?”

“Once the bone corrosion poison enters my stomach, it will be difficult for me to swallow the food. My strength will be weakened by at least five layers. The five internal organs of humans can not be treated casually with the light attribute. Unless there is a 100% guarantee, it will cause side effects!”

Wang Xian said directly to leader Yun Gu.

“HMM? You... you are really confident?”

When leader Yun Gu heard Wang Xian’s words, he revealed a look of surprise on his face. He quickly took two steps forward.

“Young man, how did you know?”

The leader was also slightly shocked. He only found out about it after checking his light attributes. This young man obviously did not know about it beforehand. However, he knew the result with just a glance.

In this aspect, he was more powerful than him!

“100% . Leader Yun Gu is not very strong. I can clear the dark energy in my stomach!”

Wang Xian said confidently. He looked at the head of the hall and said, “Hello, head of the hall. I sensed it!”

“This...”

The head of the hall was astonished.

This young man was too arrogant. He directly said that leader Yun Gu was not very strong. After all, leader Yun Gu was at the second level of the Seethrough realm.

How could he not be strong?

Even the people around the leader of Cloud Valley looked at Wang Xian in astonishment.

Level two of the Seethrough realm was considered strong no matter where he was placed.

“Really? Young master, are you really 100% confident? Then... Then, please help me get rid of him. I will definitely reward you handsomely!”

When the leader of Cloud Valley heard Wang Xian’s tone, he believed his words even more. He said quickly with some anticipation.

“Sure, take off your clothes. Don’t resist!”

Wang Xian nodded his head.

Captain Yun Gu took off his shirt without hesitation.

The people beside him looked at Wang Xian in astonishment. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Wang Xian moved his arm and an illusory palm of light appeared in front of him.

“The hand of divine light. It’s actually the hand of divine light!”

When the hand of divine light appeared in front of Wang Xian, the young man at the side revealed a shocked expression.

The Hand of divine light. One could tell Wang Xian’s strength the moment he made his move.

A void interpretation expert.

A young priest of the light of void interpretation.

This made the young man’s expression a little awkward. Just now, he was thinking of asking the other party to be his assistant. This was... A slap in the face!

“What a dazzling hand of divine light. What a strong control!”

The head of the Hall looked at the hand of divine light and said with a face full of shock.

“Don’t resist!”

As Wang Xian spoke, the hand of divine light waved and directly cut a hole in his stomach. The Hand of divine light directly opened up the flesh and blood on both sides.

“You... you be careful!”

Captain Yun Gu’s family members at the side saw this scene and said nervously.

“I’m fine. I didn’t feel any pain at all. This young master’s Healing of light is really amazing!”

Captain Yun gu waved his hand and looked at Wang Xian with a twinkle in his eyes.

Wang Xian didn’t answer him. Instead, he looked at his stomach.

A third of his stomach was completely black. A special dark energy was attached to it.

“The one that injured me was a bone eroding demonic flower of the third level of the Seethrough realm. Fortunately, I dodged it quickly. Otherwise, I would have lost my life!”

Captain Yun Gu looked down at his stomach and said with a frown.

“The bone corrosion poison has already fused with my stomach. Light restrains darkness. The power of Darkness is extremely pure and contains poison. Even if I am strong enough, the moment I cast light and remove the bone corrosion poison, my stomach would also be severely injured. By then, it would be even more difficult for me to recover from the injuries here!”

The pavilion master looked at Wang Xian and reminded him.

“It’s difficult to fuse attributes. Leader Yun Gu cultivates metal attributes. Even under special circumstances, it will take a long time to fuse them. Even if leader Yun Gu cultivates darkness attributes, the power of darkness of the bone eroding demonic flower is purer than that of leader Yun Gu. Furthermore, there is a poison attached to it. Therefore, they are not fused as one!”

As Wang Xian spoke, he touched his stomach with the hand of divine light. The light rain, strong healing, and other light powers seeped into his stomach directly.

Since the two did not fuse together, it was fine as long as they were aimed at a single thing and entered the bone corrosion poison.

An ordinary radiant priest would not be able to sense a single thing that entered the bone corrosion poison, but Wang Xian could.

Compared to light, he was better at darkness. When darkness entered his stomach, he could accurately sense every place where the power of darkness was located.

Therefore, he could control the power of light and accurately remove every power of darkness without hurting his flesh and blood.
