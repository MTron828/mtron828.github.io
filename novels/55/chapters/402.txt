Chapter 403: Establishing the Maritime Force

“Hur?”

Wang Xian was not surprised that the old man had recognized him. In the Underworld, not many people could recognize his look.

But many people knew about his strength.

There was only one person in the Underworld who could kill the Century Ghost Inborn members at such a young age. That was none other than Wang Xian.

Hence, the old man from Qing Bi Sect recognized him immediately.

“You’re really the Miracle Doctor Wang of Rivertown!”

The old man cupped his fist again with a tinge of shock in his eyes. “Miracle Wang is indeed the youngest Inborn Expert and the Number One on the Outstanding Young Heroes Chart.”

“Thank you.”

Wang Xian smiled at the old man before he waved a dismissive gesture and flew towards the cruise.

“Xiao Xian!”

Upon seeing Wang Xian, the ladies immediately went over to him.

“What a letdown. I wanted to stay here for a few more days to have fun!”

Xiao Yu grumbled as they observed the ruins around them.

It was hard for them to find such an enjoyable recreation. They felt helpless when such a thing happened in the end.

“We can only head back!”

The surrounding cruises were sinking. Even though they were not totally submerged, they could no longer be used for recreational purposes.

Some of the tourists and Martial Artists were still standing on the island, trembling in fear.

From time to time, they kept looking over at the cruise ships with astonishment.

“Yes, we can only go back. Sigh, what a spoiler!”

Lan Qingyue and the rest shook their heads.

“Let’s get back to our yacht. We can go to other places as you wish!” Wang Xian chuckled as he spoke.

“Let’s go over now. We still have about ten days before our Chinese New Year!”

They headed to the yacht after much thought.

After they returned to the yacht, Xiao Yu was asking for a Mahjong session. The girls began to crowd around and played Mahjong together.

Wang Xian looked over with his chin lifted, and they reminded him of a scene in the movie, Flirting Scholar. [1]

“Is Miracle Doctor Wang around?”

Just then, a voice was heard from the outside.

“Yes, come up, please!”

Wang Xian walked out of the living room and came to the deck.

That old man from Qing Bi Sect, along with a middle-aged man, arrived, holding things in their hands.

“Miracle Doctor Wang!”

The old man walked over with respect while the middle-aged man put the things on a table.

“Miracle Wang, I’m Duan Muwen from Qing Bi Sect. This is a small token of appreciation. I hope you like it. If it were not for you, we would have suffered a huge loss. Thanks for your help!”

The old man thanked Wang Xian once again.

“Okay!”

Wang Xian took a glance at the things on the table, but he did not turn them down. He looked around with doubt. “Is it very frequent for such a thing to happen?”

“The Wandering Sea Groups will rob a few times in a year. But it is not common for such a formidable Wandering Sea Group like Century Ghost to do it!”

The old man revealed a bitter smile. “There were only four or five powerful Wandering Sea Groups in the Asia region. They don’t enter into our waters as they are usually active in the disordered region.”

“Disordered region?”

Wang Xian thought of the markings around the disordered region on the map. “Can you tell me more about the disordered region?”

“Of course.” The old man waved a friendly gesture while he was thinking of what to say. “The disordered region is a place that has not been dominated by any of the forces. That region is a treasure-hunting ground. All the forces wanted to occupy that region, but it is on the cross-section point of four to five countries. Even those forces and organizations that are as strong as Sacred Sects are looking to occupy it.”

“That region is a breeding ground for the Spiritual Medicine, Pure Blood Coral. None of the forces are willing to let go, but none of the forces can get rid of the rest of the forces. As a result, dozens of forces are gathered over at that area, forming a disordered region!”

“Subsequently, the emergence of the sea creatures has stirred up more of a mess in that sea region. Now, everyone is killing one another, robbing Spiritual Grass and treasures.”

“Only those who are rather formidable, or ruffians, can conduct long-term activities over there,” the old man explained slowly to Wang Xian.

Wang Xian nodded. It was absolutely normal to have killings and robberies in a treasure ground without governance.

When such a situation persisted for a long time, a disordered region in the sea was formed.

“I don’t know why the Century Ghost Group dares to invade our territory. The foreign forces are getting brazen. Chinese Underworld power remains weak in the international arena.”

The old man exclaimed, “Given our current situation, I don’t know how many decades we will take to catch up with the foreign forces!”

Wang Xian smiled and nodded. This was not the first time he heard that the Underworld’s forces were weak.

Compared to those forces in the foreign countries, the Ancestral Clans in the Underworld were much weaker.

The Chinese Ancestral Clans liked to keep it to themselves. All the precious manuals would be carefully hidden, and the conditions to inherit them were rather stringent.

To prevent the leak of cultivation manuals, many families and clans only allowed men to inherit them.

Coupled with the history of when the Imperial Court was in power, they wantonly burned all the secret manuals to prevent Martial Artists from creating disorder. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Since then, many secret manuals disappeared. Generation after generation, the almost invincible Underworld had now become the weakest existence in the international arena.

Even the Knight and Mage bloodline from Europe was much more powerful.

This was also the reason why Fire God Denomination dared to infiltrate the Underworld and annihilate Flame Palace.

After chatting with Duan Muwen, Wang Xian realized he was someone who worried about the nation and could not take it lying down that the Underworld’s forces were weak.

At the same time, he was also disgruntled with the internal strife in the Underworld.

Those domestic families and clans were killing each other for just an acre of resources, treasures, and spiritual grasses.

Yet, the international forces had already set their eyes on the vast ocean and began to plunder resources from other countries.

Qing Bi Sect often came into contact with these international forces as their territory was located in the middle of the sea. Hence, they often felt great pressure.

Wang Xian listened and chatted with him for half an hour before sending the old man off.

“This Qing Bi Sect is not bad!”

From the conversation with Duan Muwen, Wang Xian came to an understanding that the competition at the ocean was much higher than the peaceful domestic land.

Many of the disciples were not as arrogant as those in the mainland as well.

This had something to do with their living environment. The powerful Ancestral Sects in the mainland raised arrogant disciples that no one dared to provoke. In the long run, they developed haughty and demanding characteristics.

The disciples from the sects in the sea had stayed in a dangerous and competitive environment for too long. They had encountered too many stronger opponents, which developed into their cautious characteristics.

“Disordered region!”

Wang Xian took out that map again and drew his lips.

Whether the Underworld’s forces were weak or strong, it was none of his business. But he could take down the disordered region first.

He could start with this region and clean up various clans and forces in the sea.

“Great. The Golden Swordfish are learning how to speak and read. I can build them into a formidable maritime force, wiping out everyone else.”
