Chapter 3143: 3142 was exterminated. The Milky Way was in a state of shock

“No!”

The leader of the Dragon Race looked at the mountain beast in front of him as it started to crumble bit by bit. A look of despair appeared on his face.

The mountain beast was the strongest trump card of the dragon race.

The entire mountain beast had experienced countless generations of powerful dragon race experts pouring their blood into it.

It had already been over two billion years since it reached him.

Over two billion years, the mountain beast had become the strongest trump card of the dragon race.

It could completely fight against several level 2 universe knights.

It could even fight against level 3 universe beings. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

However, the mountain beast actually slowly crumbled under the attacks of the members of Dragon Palace.

This caused the expression of the dragon race leader to slowly crumble.

The level two universe knights in the Dragon Palace were comparable to level three venerables.

“Dragon King, we don’t have a deep grudge against each other. Why do you want to exterminate our Dragon Race!”

The leader of the Dragon Race roared with a mournful face.

“You don’t have a deep grudge against each other? Sending the dragon-faced knight to ambush and kill me and killing the Asian dragon wantonly. This crime is enough to exterminate your race!”

“In the future, if there are forces that hunt the Asian dragon wantonly, they will be the enemies of our Dragon Palace.”

Wang Xian announced with a cold face.

Countless chains were rising around him. His eyes were filled with killing intent as he stared at the leader of the Dragon Race.

“Kill him!”

Wang Xian let out a low roar and attacked the leader of the dragon race.

Ao he and the devouring dragons swayed their huge and ferocious bodies as they charged forward.

The Heaven Formation set up a formation and began to seal and kill.

“I, Long Yun, am incompetent. I was unable to resist the enemy’s invasion. All My clansmen, flee. Remember, if one day I have enough strength, I must destroy the Dragon Palace.”

The Dragon Clan Leader’s eyes revealed his will to die as he roared with a ferocious expression.

“What?”

“Clan leader!”

“Not good!”

The expressions of all the surrounding dragon clan experts and disciples changed drastically when they heard their clan leader’s words.

Their eyes were filled with despair.

“Run, run, run! Everyone, run now!”

The hearts of the two universe knights of the dragon race trembled violently as they roared.

“Run, run quickly!”

“It’s over, our dragon race is finished!”

The eyes of all the great beings and disciples of the dragon race were blood-red. They lost all their fighting spirit instantly and ran back.

“You want to escape? It’s not that easy. Kill!”

Prime Minister Gui, who was commanding in the sky, had a cold look in his eyes.

He moved his body, and a huge turtle shell directly attacked the disciples of the Dragon Race.

“Kill!”

All the members of the Dragon Palace exploded with terrifying power and chased after them.

They were defeated like a mountain.

When the leader of the Dragon Race announced it, it meant the destruction of the entire dragon race.

“Lock onto the two universe knights. We can’t let them escape.”

The black screen formation gradually collapsed. In an instant, more than a dozen Dragon Palace Knights locked onto the two universe knights and charged over.

“Damn it, run!”

The two universe knights of the dragon race looked shocked and quickly ran away.

Pu

At this time, a black and white shadow suddenly appeared behind a universe knight, and its sharp claws instantly pierced through him.

“I’ll leave the other one to you!”

Ao Yao pierced through the body of a knight and said indifferently.

“Ao Yao, you’re looking down on us!”

Behind them, Mu Zesen and the others’unhappy voices could be heard.

Sou Sou Sou

The Deadly Arrow immediately locked onto another universe knight.

When that universe Knight sensed that his companion had been killed, he had a bad premonition.

He gritted his teeth, not daring to stop for even a moment, and flew forward desperately.

Sou Sou Sou Sou

But at this time, he sensed a great terror attack coming from behind.

He gripped the godly weapon in his hand tightly, and he had no choice but to turn his body to resist.

Hong

The arrow was blocked by his incomparably powerful energy, but around him, a few universe knights from Dragon Palace had already surrounded him.

“It’s over!”

Looking at the group of knights from Dragon Palace, his eyes revealed a deathly look.

“No!”

At this time, a desperate roar came from the side once again.

He looked over and saw their leader being grabbed by the Dragon King’s huge claws.

This made his body tremble. He closed his eyes helplessly and slowly let go of the godly weapon in his hand.

He lost all will to fight and gave up resisting.

Pu

An arrow entered his body and melted it.

“Our leader is dead, and the two knights are dead too!”

“Run, run!”

The death of the clan leader and the last two universe knights.

It caused all the disciples to panic.

They were fleeing even more crazily than before.

Below them, some ordinary disciples who did not participate in the battle were fleeing.

The entire dragon race was in chaos.

The sounds of fleeing, begging, and crying filled the air.

After killing the leader of the Dragon Race, Wang Xian scanned his surroundings indifferently and watched quietly as he floated in the air.

They were slaughtering the Asian dragons wantonly. Did they ever think that such a day would come?

They had brought this upon themselves!

A primary race of the universe was rapidly approaching its demise.

“We’re Here!”

At this moment, at the edge of Dragon Mountain, a three-foot race and two universe knights from the dragon race rushed over to check on the situation.

They were covered in metal armor and looked ahead.

“HM? The Dragon Race has collapsed? They were destroyed so quickly?”

“According to the records of our three-foot race, the Dragon Race has a very powerful guardian item. I didn’t expect it to be destroyed so quickly!”

“This speed is too fast. Look, third brother, there are so many universe knights in Dragon Palace, this…”

The two universe knights from the three-foot race looked over and revealed a shocked expression.

With a glance, there were more than 20 universe knights.

Such a number was simply terrifying.

“No wonder the Dragon Palace was able to exterminate the dragon-descendant race. This strength is definitely one of the best in our Milky Way, and the number of universe knights is the highest.”

One of the supremacies from the three-foot race mumbled.

“Huh?”

At this moment, Wang Xian, who was floating in the middle of the dragon race, sensed that someone was spying on them. He raised his eyebrows slightly and looked over immediately.

“Oh no, we have been discovered. That should be the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace!”

The two supremacies from the three-foot race felt Wang Xian’s gaze and their hearts pounded violently.

“Sir Dragon King, we were just passing by and came here out of curiosity. Please forgive us.”

The two of them looked at each other and immediately bowed to Wang Xian.

Wang Xian retracted his gaze and ignored them. With a wave of his arm, the crescent moon appeared in front of him and he looked at this world quietly.

More and more universe supremacies were rushing over from the surroundings of the dragon race.

When they saw this scene, their faces were filled with shock.
