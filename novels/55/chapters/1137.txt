Chapter 1138: 1139 entered the main hall

Translator: 5496903

The third prince stared at the green knife that had disappeared in a flash. A hint of coldness appeared in his eyes.

He had obtained this green knife from an ancient tomb of an expert. This green knife had the ability to attack an expert of the Seethrough realm.

Any martial artist below the Seethrough realm would definitely be killed.

“PFFT! PFFT! PFFT!”

At this moment, at the edge of the floating sea city, Wang Xian’s body had already left the floating sea city and was falling towards the beach.

He was holding the lightning strike wood in his hand. In front of the lightning strike wood, there was a small green knife.

A terrifying force was transmitted from the small knife. It almost wanted to tear apart the lightning strike wood.

“Meow, Meow, Meow!”

The ice fire civet cat in Wang Xian’s arms was extremely happy at this moment. It looked at him spitting out fresh blood as it stuck out its small tongue and licked non-stop.

“What a terrifying small green knife. If I didn’t sense it with my light and dark fire dragon eyes and blocked it with the lightning strike wood, this strike would definitely have taken my life!”

“A Prince? That young man is actually the third Prince of star-moon kingdom. Damn it!”

Wang Xian’s eyes were filled with anger. His internal organs were almost torn apart under the terrifying force of the green knife. Large mouthfuls of blood could not help but flow out.

“Phew!”

Seeing the green knife gradually disappearing, he heaved a sigh of relief. However, when he saw a group of figures chasing after him, he gritted his teeth and jumped into the sea. The Dragon Energy on his body quickly healed his body.

“I actually consumed 130,000 dragon crystals!”

Wang Xian entered the sea and immediately began to recover from his injuries. He flew in another direction at a terrifying speed.

“Where is he?”

“Damn it, where is that Kid’s corpse? Why did it disappear all of a sudden?”

“Could he have entered the sea?”

Soon, at the edge of the floating sea city, the third prince and the rest arrived. They scanned their surroundings and jumped into the sea as soon as they saw no corpse.

“Look for it. You must find it for me. You must get the Cubs of the ice fire civet cat!”

The third Prince roared with his fiery red eyes.

“It’s the third Prince!”

Everyone felt a chill in their hearts and immediately jumped into the sea.

“This fellow is really addicted to drinking my blood?”

Wang Xian waited for the Cubs of the ice fire civet cat from another direction. He smiled as he looked at the Cubs of the ice fire civet cat who was licking the blood on his face.

He sized up the fire and ice civet cat carefully, and a look of surprise appeared in his eyes.

Fire and ice civet cat: transcendent level

“This fire and ice civet cat looks like it was just born not long ago. It has the strength of a transcendent level 8 when it was just born? This is too abnormal!”

Wang Xian stared at it with a twinkle in his eyes.

The fire and ice civet cat also stared at him with its beautiful eyes. It licked its lips as if it still wanted more.

“Little Fella, stay in the Spirit Storage Bag!”

Wang Xian grabbed it and placed it directly into the spirit storage bag.

“Meow!”

The ice fire civet cat, which had just entered the spirit storage bag, started to scream in panic. It kept screaming in the pitch-black space.

“Stop screaming. Stay in there for a while!”

Wang Xian comforted it and looked at the center of the city of beasts. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

The beasts roared and the group of people who came in from the island fled into the distance in fear.

There were tens of thousands of people gathered at the East Gate of Bright Moon City. They watched from afar and didn’t dare to come forward.

Even the army of Bright Moon City was guarding at the East Gate, afraid that ferocious beasts would break into the city.

Tens of thousands of ferocious beasts with the lowest level seven were definitely a terrifying force for Bright Moon City.

“To be able to get one-tenth of the people who entered the Hundred Beasts City Out Alive is already considered pretty good!”

Wang Xian sighed slightly. Everyone thought that it would be an opportunity, but they didn’t expect it to be a disaster.

“Before one has the strength, human lives are like ants!”

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered. He raised his head and looked at the sky. Seven insightful emptiness realm experts were fighting against the two explosive golden lions of level three of the insightful emptiness realm.

In terms of level, the two golden lions of the insightful emptiness realm could completely defeat the seven experts. However, due to their prolonged hibernation, their strength was not at 50% of their peak, or even less.

The two golden lions were being suppressed by the seven insightful emptiness realm experts.

Even so, there were two insightful emptiness realm experts whose bodies were covered in blood.

“Ao Yao, you will enter the main hall with me. The rest of you will secretly store the corpses here into your interspatial rings!”

Wang Xian instructed ao Yao and the rest.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

The group of strange demons hurriedly replied.

Wang Xian did not hesitate and flew directly to the main hall. Feng Luan had already entered the main hall. He did not know if she had gained anything.

His body moved and easily dodged the ferocious beasts one by one.

He swept his gaze across the void interpretation stage powerhouses in the sky and rushed straight into the main hall.

“Eh?”

Right at this time, the Wind Howl dynasty’s Type 3 void interpretation expert, who was fighting a golden lion alone, felt something, and he looked down.

“Someone actually entered the main hall after taking advantage of the situation. He’s really courting death. I’ll Let You Scout the way!”

The expert’s gaze was cold, and his eyes were filled with killing intent.

“Roar!”

“Not good!”

At this moment, his expression changed drastically. The Golden Lion with its mouth opened its mouth and attacked him with all its might. The violent attacks made him palpitate in fear.

“Did these two golden lions sense that someone has entered the hall?”

He was bewildered and began his final attack with an embarrassed expression.

“HMM? The hall only covers an area of one kilometer. It’s not a huge area!”

Wang Xian, who had just entered the main hall, saw sculptures in the shape of ferocious beasts around him. Every sculpture was lifelike.

Entering the main hall was like entering an ancient place of worship. There were all kinds of ferocious beast patterns everywhere.

Wang Xian frowned slightly. Walking in the middle of seven to eight meters and more than ten meters of ferocious beast sculptures, there was always a feeling that made one’s heart palpitate.

The entire hall was in a mess. Even if Wang Xian flew to the top, he could not see what was going down ahead.

“Bang!”

At this moment, a shattering sound was heard. Wang Xian was slightly stunned. His body moved and he flew directly to that location.

“Wang Xian!”

When Wang Xian flew over, Feng Luan’s voice was heard.

“Feng Luan, how is it? Did you get anything?”

When Wang Xian saw Feng Luan, he flew over immediately with a smile on his face. He looked in front of her and saw that a ferocious beast sculpture had been broken by her.

“No!”

Feng Luan frowned slightly and looked at the dried blood in her hands.

“The entire hall is filled with these ferocious beast sculptures. It is very chaotic. There is a drop of the blood of these ferocious beasts in the sculptures. Some of them have dried up and are completely useless. I have seen so many ancient tombs, tombs of emperors, and land of heritage. This is the first time I have seen such a strange one!”

Feng Luan frowned as she looked around and slowly said.

“When they came in, the two fierce beasts said not to disturb their master’s sleep. Could it be that there’s a hidden compartment here?”
