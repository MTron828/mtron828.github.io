Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

Dragon Balls were weapons unique to the dragon race. Based on their elemental attributes, they would have different dragon balls.

Dragon ball of fire attribute could burn the skies and cook the seas while the dragon ball of ice attribute could freeze the world.

A strong dragon ball was sufficient to change an entire world.

Wang Xian looked at the glazed inferno crystal in his hand. He dripped a drop of dragon blood on it before injecting dragon energy into the fire crystal. Soon, he felt a sense of control.

Wang Xian revealed a faint smile. Through the upgrades used dragon blood and dragon energy, the glazed inferno crystal started to give off its own glow.

The crimson red glow emitted a scorching hot temperature that could easily burn up a human.

With just a change in his thoughts, the dragon ball levitated gradually in mid-air. All Wang Xian had to do was to instruct with his mind and the dragon ball would start moving rapidly.

Great. Through the nourishment with dragon energy, this dragon energy will only get stronger and stronger in the future!

Wang Xian was pleasantly surprised. Even at this very moment, the strength of this dragon ball was very horrifying.

Its temperature could be 3000-4000 degrees.

An ordinary man would be turned to ashes upon contact with the fire dragon ball! At this moment, even my body couldn’t take it head on and a level seven martial artist couldn’t touch it at all!

Wang Xian thought to himself. With another change in thoughts, he kept the dragon ball in his body.

“Great, great.”

Excitement filled Wang Xian’s face. Seeing that Guan Shuqing was still reading the information, he switched on the computer and started playing.

“Xiao Xian, I’ll be heading home.” At five-plus in the evening, Guan Shuqing spoke to Wang Xian who was facing the computer.

“Are you going back now? Do you need me to send you back?” Wang Xian took down his earphones and asked.

“It’s okay.” Guan Shuqing shook her head.

“Let me know if there’s anything,” Wang Xian said to her.

“Mm. Alright.” Guan Shuqing smiled, nodded her head and headed out of the restaurant.

“It’s five-plus now. I should get going at 7 pm.”

Wang Xian looked at the time. There would be a banquet hosted by Old Qin at Old Xue’s five-star hotel tonight and he would be going over to take a look.

When Guan Shuqing got home, her parents asked her to change into an evening gown and follow them to a banquet excitedly.

Guan Shuqing was a little surprised by her parents’ behavior.

“Quick. Qin Family will be hosting a banquet at Summer Sun International Hotel tonight and they have invited us!” her father said agitatedly.

Considering the state of her family at this moment, they were not qualified to attend a banquet hosted by the Qin Family. However, they had surprisingly received an invitation!

If Guan Shuqing’s father could get to know some friends in the banquet or get into the good books of Qin Family, it would be an easy task for him to make a comeback.

Guan Shuqing was taken aback by what she heard from her father. Qin Family? Summer Sun International Hotel?

This made her recall her lunch with Old Qin and Old Xue at Summer Sun Resort in the afternoon. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

However, she did not read too much into it and couldn’t believe that would be true. She changed into the clothes and headed to Summer Sun International Hotel with her parents in advance.

Summer Sun International Hotel was a property under the Xue Family of Rivertown. When one spoke of the Xue Family, the upper social circle often referred to them as Ancient Martial Arts Family, Xue Family.

They were ranked fifth in the ranking of Ancient Martial Artist Families in Rivertown. However, they would probably advance up the ranking by one or two as the Old Master of Xue Family had recently achieved a breakthrough.

As for Qin Family, they were the commerce superpower in Rivertown. Qin Family’s Ancient Dynasty Property, Ancient Dynasty Logistics and Ancient Dynasty Real Estate, were all humongous organizations.

The assets of Qin Family were over $10 billion. Moreover, the background of Qin Family was very, very strong.

Currently, the Old Master of Qin Family had a war comrade holding an important position in the government. The brother of Old Qin’s wife was a very capable person in the capital of the province. Despite not being an Ancient Martial Arts Family, Qin Family was still one of the strongest in existence within Rivertown.

Even Ancient Martial Arts Families wouldn’t dare to offend them.

For the banquet hosted by Qin Family tonight, 60% of the elites of Rivertown would be present.

At 7.30 pm, a heavy-duty motorcycle arrived at Summer Sun International Hotel. There was a row of luxury cars lined up neatly in front of the entrance of the hotel.

Wang Xian removed his helmet and smiled as he looked at the luxurious hotel in front of him.

“Hmm... It seems that I have underestimated the Xue Family. This construction costs of this hotel would at least be several hundreds of millions.”

Wang Xian looked around before walking in.

The seventh story was where the Qin Family would be hosting the banquet and they had already booked the entire seventh story.

Wang Xian walked out from the lift and headed to the main hall joyously.

“Mister, please show us your invitation.” When he arrived at the entrance, the two employees were looking at him with weird looks.

“Invitation letter?” Wang Xian shrugged his shoulders and replied, “Qin Lianhui said it would be fine as long as I said I’m with him. You could give him a call to check.”

“Qin Lianhui?”

Director Qin!

The two employees were shocked. One of them took out a phone to verify after taking another look at Wang Xian.

“Mister Wang, this way please.” After hanging up the phone, the employee spoke enthusiastically.

Wang Xian nodded his head and headed in.

“This is Qin Family’s banquet. Isn’t this young man too casual with his dressing?”

“If he could call our Director Qin by his name, his background must not be ordinary.”

The two employees conversed softy as they saw Wang Xian off.

Dressing?

With Wang Xian’s acute hearing, he could hear the conversation between the two of them clearly. He was shocked and quickly took a look at his attire.

He was wearing casual attire from Versace and a pair of white casual shoes. I do look pretty handsome!

Hmm? Perhaps my attire isn’t really suitable for the occasion!

At this moment, Wang Xian saw the group of people in the banquet hall who had arrived. The guys were all in suits and the girls were in evening gowns.

Looking across, he understood the level of this banquet immediately.

Most of the men had watches on their wrists. As for the ladies, they had all kinds of necklaces around their necks.

Damn it. This is my first time attending a banquet like this. I didn’t know about these!

Wang Xian truly didn’t know. He hadn’t given much thought about the banquet in the afternoon and headed over directly in his casual attire.

My attire currently isn’t really fitting for the occasion here!

Forget it. Since this was organized by Old Qin, he will know that I’m not being disrespectful to him.

Wang Xian shrugged his shoulders and didn’t pay too much attention to it. He walked inside in a straight line.

He hadn’t had his dinner yet. Therefore, he chose to head to a corner to get some food.

Eh? Isn’t that Shuqng? When Wang Xian arrived at the corner, he was surprised to see a familiar figure.

Guan Shuqing was sitting with a middle-aged man and a couple and they were most probably her parents.

Guan Shuqing was wearing a black evening gown tonight. She also had high heels on and exquisite makeup put up, making her look extremely alluring.

Wang Xian walked over with smiles. “Shuqing, what a coincidence! You are here too!”

Guan Shuqing was slightly shocked when she saw Wang Xian after lifting her head. She was also surprised and asked, “Xiao Xiao, why are you here too?”

Guan Shuqing stood up.

Her parents, who were beside her, turned their heads around with doubts. They took a look at Wang Xian before looking at their daughter again. Immediately, they frowned.

“Daughter, who is he?” Her father frowned and asked.

To be dressed so casually in a formal setting, the first impression he had of Wang Xian was that this young man wasn’t sensible.
