Chapter 1155: 1156 hit in the face

Translator: 5496903

In the middle of the night, almost everyone was already resting.

No one was browsing the public forums in Bright Moon City.

After Wang Xian’s news was sent out, it didn’t cause much of a stir.

However, Wang Xian didn’t mind it. The real start would come tomorrow.

The battle between the two assassin organizations was very interesting!

Wang Xian smiled and saw Feng Luan resting on the bed. He smiled and sat on the chair to cultivate.

“Murder!” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“What happened to the post that was posted late at night on the public forum of Bright Moon City? was that the declaration made by the Dragon Thorns?”

“Dead. More than a dozen experts from the Yang family of the Northern District were killed. Oh My God, all the top-notch experts were killed overnight!”

“Fifty to sixty people died last night. All of them were done by the dragon assassin organization. There is a congratulatory Death Note from the Dragon Assassin Organization!”

“On the forum, it should be a message from the dragon assassin organization. F * ck, they are going against the undercurrent assassin organization!”

“I have to say, this dragon assassin organization is quite disciplined. The mission that they accepted yesterday was completed today. Moreover, they destroyed a family with a transcendent level 9 expert. This dragon assassin organization is not simple!”

The next morning, the entire bright moon city became lively.

Screams of murder!

The message in the Bright Moon City Forum.

Many families and experts had been destroyed.

The entire bright moon city exploded early in the morning.

This caused the citizens who were prepared to watch the show to reveal expressions of interest.

“Haha, the Dragon Spike has made a move, the dragon spike has made a move. I didn’t expect this dragon spike to be so trustworthy!”

“Haha, Father Is In Heaven. Thank you, Dragon Spike. That’s great, that’s Great!”

“This dragon spike is really trustworthy. As long as we accept the mission, we will definitely complete it. This is the credibility that an assassin organization should have!”

“Not bad, not bad. Looks like our money wasn’t wasted. It was worth it, very worth it, Haha!”

However, the mission publishers who had originally not had much hope for the mission were excited when they received the news.

Not only did the dragon spike not escape, but he even completed the mission at night. This kind of behavior made them very excited.

Especially the three provocative words from the dragon spike. In their eyes, this was the dragon Spike’s counterattack and also the dragon Spike’s confidence.

Even if the master of undercurrent had killed so many people in public last night in such a domineering manner, the dragon Spike still didn’t care about you.

“I knew it. Since the dragon Spike dared to kill the son of the Master of Undercurrent, he definitely won’t admit defeat so easily. It’s probably just the beginning now!”

“What’s next is interesting. The master of undercurrent swore to kill the dragon spike in public, and the dragon Spike didn’t show any weakness in his response. Haha, Interesting!”

Some people were whispering in the restaurant.

However, while everyone was discussing, there was a new problem.

Yesterday, Dragon Spike had accepted more than fifty missions, and 50 to 60 people were directly killed. Moreover, they were still accepting missions.

Yesterday, those who didn’t make a move were assassinated by dragon Spike hired by their enemies. Today, would they make a move?

If they didn’t make a move, their opponents might not be able to sit still and ask dragon spike to make a move!

The dragon Spike’s assassination once again caused many people to sink into a state of anxiety. Some people were hesitating.

“Let’s bet on this dragon spike. If they can withstand the attack of the master of undercurrent, if their enemies hire them first...”

In front of their own lives, everyone had to think carefully.

Strike first to gain strength, then to suffer!

Everyone had to think about it.

“Damn it, go to hell!”

At this moment, in the base of the undercurrent assassin organization in Bright Moon City, the master of undercurrent waved his arm with a cold face.

“Bang!”

The DRAKONID who was hanging on the torture device turned into a bloody mist. He stared at it with a gloomy face.

One night, an entire night, he did not receive any news about the dragon spike.

However, just now, the dragon Spike had provoked him, making him extremely angry.

“I want to see how many people your dragon Spike has that I can kill. I’ll play along. Keke, then let’s play. I have plenty of time!”

The Master of Undercurrent’s eyes revealed a crazed expression as he muttered softly.

The one-armed white-clothed old man could not help but shiver, his eyes revealing a terrified expression.

Their leader had gone crazy!

According to him, this kind of crazy state only happened twice. The first time was when his family was destroyed.

The first time was when his eldest son was killed.

This time was when his second son was killed and undercurrent was provoked.

He could already imagine what would happen if the dragon spike was stared at by the leader.

“Go and prepare!”

The master of undercurrent coldly said to the white-clothed old man by the side.

“It’s leader!”

The old man in white quickly bowed and walked out quickly.

Beside the leader, there was a feeling of accompanying a king like accompanying a tiger.

...

The entire Bright Moon City was discussing the dragon assassin organization and the Master of Undercurrent. On the Bright Moon City’s forum, Wang Xian’s statement had also attracted countless attention.

There were many comments about how awesome the dragon assassin was and how domineering the Dragon Assassin was!

The confrontation between the two assassin organizations had caused the entire forum to become much livelier.

There were even people who set up a bet to see who would win in the end.

Wang Xian looked at the information on the Forum and revealed a faint smile on his face. This was only the beginning.

The beginning of a face-smacking.

As long as someone issued a mission, as long as it complied with the rules of the Dragon Assassin Organization, the Dragon Assassin would not reject anyone who came.

Of the forty strange demons he brought, one was killed by the master of undercurrent, and the remaining thirty-nine were killed.

Of these thirty-nine, nineteen were able to assassinate level nine transcendents.

No matter how many missions there were, the dragon spike was able to accept them.

In this one day, the dragon Spike accepted more than sixty missions, from assassinating level four transcendents to the highest level nine transcendents.

After a thorough examination, the dragon Spike accepted all of them.

“Long Yi, keep in contact with Ao Yao at all times. You must be careful this time!”

Wang Xian reminded Long Yi.

“It’s the Dragon King. Don’t Worry!”

Long Yi nodded. The death of a DRAKONID had already made them realize the seriousness of the problem.

In the evening, according to the usual practice of the dragon spike, it was time to pay the commission.

The streets were crowded with people, so no one knew who the spy of dragon spike was.

Only when the spy of dragon Spike came out to take the commission would the person who paid the commission know that it was the spy of dragon spike.

This method was very safe and also very dangerous.

If the person who paid the commission wanted to deal with the spy, it would be very easy.

Today, Dragon Spike was still using this method.

And today, the master of undercurrent also used this method. He and the white-clothed old man followed a middle-aged man from afar.

The middle-aged man came to the designated location, placed an interspatial ring on the trash can, and walked forward for more than ten meters.

The corners of his mouth curled up slightly, waiting for the dragon spike and dark thread to take the bait!
