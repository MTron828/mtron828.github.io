Chapter 843: 0844 meeting the parents

Translator: 549690339

With the current strength of the Dragon Palace, Wang Xian did not dare to claim that he could sweep across the entire earth. However, it would not be a problem for him to sweep across the entire western divine realm.

Therefore, when the goddess spoke about the judgment from above, the golden swordfish beside him would make a move without him saying a word.

A mere lower immortal dared to be so arrogant. It was already a sign of forgiveness that he did not kill them directly.

If there were people who dared to provoke the ancient emperors, their heads would have long fallen.

Although Wang Xian was not an emperor now, he could already unify the Earth if he wanted to be the king and dominate the world.

After returning to Jiang City, great changes had taken place in the city. The environment had changed for the better and the surrounding trees had grown taller. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

When they arrived in the city, there were more people flying in the sky. There were at least a thousand people flying on swords.

These people were at least at the Xiantian realm.

In the past, a Xiantian Master could suppress an entire region. Now, there were as many Xiantian Masters as dogs.

“Let’s call our old friends and have a chat!”

Wang Xian looked at the floating island in front of the villa.

This floating island was given to Xiao Yu for him to play with. On it, the Azure Dragon and the other drakonids were taking care of it.

The auction was still held normally. It could be considered one of the few properties of the Dragon Palace in the human world.

“Dragon King!”

A group of DRAKONIDS flew over. Wang Xian swept his gaze across them and revealed a faint smile on his face.

Twenty Immortals. Not Bad!

As Wang Xian had been staying in the Dragon Palace, these Drakonids had been following Xiao Yu’s orders.

However, Xiao Yu did not need the DRAKONIDS. Hence, they had been staying on the floating island.

“Call Old Xue, Old Qin, Old Wang, Dahai and the rest over. Tell them to come back and treat them to a meal!”

Wang Xian ordered Mo Qinglong.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

The group of DRAKONIDS nodded their heads respectfully.

“Xiao Yu, did you call that brat over? He took away my precious little sister. It’s about time to meet him after such a long time!”

After Wang Xian gave his instructions, he said to Xiao Yu who was beside him.

“Brother, this...”

Xiao Yu was a little shy and didn’t know what to say.

“Go. The matter of Feng Lingtian is a problem in the future. Soon, I will be going to another world. Therefore, the matters on earth must be resolved as soon as possible!”

Wang Xian said to Xiao Yu with a serious tone this time.

Entering the extraordinary mainland was inevitable. Whether Xiao Yu wanted to follow and how Feng Lingtian should deal with it were both troublesome matters.

Whether Feng Lingtian should join the Dragon Palace or not, he would have to make a decision when the time came.

“Alright, Brother!”

Xiao Yu also put away her willfulness and nodded. She was also conflicted about the future.

She was 100% unwilling to leave her brother who had been protecting her. However, she did not wish to be separated from Feng Lingtian either.

“Then I’ll make a trip to the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect!”

Xiao Yu said to Wang Xian.

“Don’t go. Let them come over!”

Wang Xian said directly.

Xiao Yu stuck out her tongue when she heard her brother cut her off. She knew her brother’s intention.

She and Feng Lingtian were on two different levels.

Speaking of which, Feng Lingtian was on a higher level.

Naturally, Wang Xian couldn’t let his sister suffer. He wouldn’t let her suffer in the future either. Naturally, he had to show some dignity.

“Alright, Brother. Don’t worry. Lingtian wouldn’t dare to make me angry!”

Xiao Yu said with a smile.

Wang Xian smiled with a straight face. “Alright, I’ll accompany Shuqing and Qingyue for a stroll. You Settle your own matters first.”

Following that, Wang Xian accompanied Guan Shuqing, Lan Qingyue, and the rest to their home. He also sent someone to invite Tang Yinxuan’s family over.

The few girls would be members of the Dragon Palace in the future. Naturally, he had to make some arrangements.

Then, he chatted with his two old friends in Jiang City. Two days passed by quickly.

On the morning of the third day, a group of people welcomed them from the floating island.

“Brother, Lingtian, his father, and the people from the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect are here!”

Xiao Yu said to Wang Xian with a slightly red face.

“Let’s go out and take a look!”

Wang Xian smiled and nodded. Xiao Yu held his shoulder and walked out.

In the leisure area of the floating island, there was a huge villa. In front of the villa was an empty space with a pond in the middle.

At this moment, at the entrance, a group of over 200 people were standing on the ground in front of them.

“Six Immortals!”

Wang Xian swept his gaze over. The foundation of the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect was not bad. There were already six immortals, and Xiao ran was among them.

Sect leader Ling Xiao had also reached the upper immortal realm.

“Dragon King!”

Ling Xiao immediately cupped his hands respectfully when he saw Wang Xian coming out.

Although Wang Xian was Xiao Yu’s brother, his elder brother was like a father. They were of equal seniority.

However, in terms of strength, the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect was still far behind. Even the current Yellow Heaven Immortal sect was still very weak compared to the Dragon Palace.

He had never dared to imagine that his son could climb up to the Dragon King’s sister.

“Haha, Sect Leader Ling, everyone, please come in!”

Wang Xian extended his hand and greeted them.

“Dragon King, sorry to Bother You!”

Ling Xiao smiled but was still a little reserved. After all, the person in front of him was a terrifying existence who had destroyed the Holy Doctor Holy Medicine Immortal sect.

Feng Lingtian followed by the side nervously and secretly looked at Xiao Yu.

His father was cautious, so he was even more nervous. The person in front of him was the Dragon King!

Wang Xian saw Xiao ran beside them and waved his hand.

“Master!”

Xiao ran immediately walked over and said respectfully.

Xiao ran was the disciple of the Dragon King. Everyone in the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect knew about this.

Otherwise, even if Xiao ran’s talent was extraordinary, he would not have stepped into the immortal realm.

The resources of the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect were biased towards him.

Even if Xiao ran was an outsider, no one in the entire immortal sect dared to say anything. On the contrary, they wanted nothing more than to nurture Xiao ran properly.

However, Xiao ran did not disappoint. He had already reached the immortal realm at the age of nineteen.

“You’ve grown a lot taller!”

Wang Xian patted Xiao ran, who was shoulder-to-shoulder with him. Some things had changed, but people had changed. The little guy who was 1.6 meters tall had now grown taller.

“Hehe!”

Xiao ran smiled foolishly. His eyes were filled with gratitude.

“Where’s your ancestor? In the past, he took Shu Qing as his disciple. In the past, your master’s wife was in a coma. Now, you have to thank him properly!”

Wang Xian asked Xiao ran.

“Master, ancestor didn’t follow us in the celestial sect. Should I inform him?”

Xiao ran said immediately.

“There’s no need. Your master’s wife will go there herself. I’ll give you some pointers on your cultivation later.”

“Yes, it’s Master!”

Xiao ran nodded excitedly.

After entering the hall, Wang Xian gestured to Ling Xiao and the others.

Ao Jian and the other three stood by the side with their swords in hand. Mo Qinglong and the other Drakonids immediately prepared tea.

Xiao ran also stood by Wang Xian’s side.

When the remaining three immortals from the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect saw this scene, they stood by the side obediently and did not dare to sit down.

Since the others did not sit down, Feng Lingtian did not dare to sit down either. He stood by his father’s side.

It was too restrictive.

Nowadays, although the number of immortals had increased by two to three times, they were still immortals after all. They would be honored guests wherever they went.

However, in the Dragon King’s place, the Immortals served tea and stood by the side to protect him!
