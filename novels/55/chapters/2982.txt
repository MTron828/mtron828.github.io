Chapter 2983: 1983 had easily killed them

“Are there such ugly dragons among the Divine Dragons? Do they also have the bloodline of the Divine Dragons?”

“Isn’t this too ugly? Even if they have the bloodline of the Divine Dragons, I don’t think they can be sold at a good price, right?”

“Yes, they are too ugly. They are not suitable to be mounts!”

The members of the Dragon Palace suddenly appeared and greeted them with smiles on their faces, causing everyone around them to be extremely shocked.

When the members of the four-armed race saw this, the corners of their mouths curled up slightly as they unscrupulously sized up the poisonous horned dragon seed and the others.

They didn’t conceal anything at all.

In their eyes, the Dragon Palace actually sent people to welcome them. What did this mean?

It was because they feared them and wanted to curry favor with them!

And as the race at the center of the universe, they had a noble status in this remote place.

Therefore, they did not put the members of the Dragon Palace in their eyes at all.

“Oh?”

The godly monarchs and disciples of the eight barrens were slightly stunned when they saw the arrival of the Dragon Palace.

“The Dragon Palace is afraid. They actually thought of coming here to curry favor with us!”

“Haha, I didn’t expect the Dragon Palace to have such a day!”

“Good, good. We should make them kneel down and beg for mercy later!”

Some experts of the eight desolates shouted in low voices with excitement and malevolence on their faces.

“This…”

The people of this planet were also slightly surprised when they saw this.

They also didn’t expect the people of the Dragon Palace to come and welcome them. Should they treat them well?

However, it made sense when they thought about it. The four-armed human and the three-eyed human were powerful forces in the center of the universe.

The Dragon Palace was very powerful in the starry sky, but it was nothing in the center of the universe!

It was natural for the Dragon Palace to try to please them!

“Hehehe!”

The eight-headed demon fiend and the others smiled even more and laughed even louder when they heard the reckless words of the other party!

“Little Brothers, let them know our enthusiasm!”

The eight-headed demon fiend laughed and looked at the sky array.

“Hehe, eight-headed demon fiend, you are really ugly!”

Tian Chen laughed and waved his arm. Rays of light instantly filled a radius of hundreds of millions of kilometers, enveloping everyone within.

“Tian Chen Old Man, we don’t like to hear your words. However, it’s your fault for being strong. We Can’t beat you, but they…”

“Let’s start with you. Enjoy our hospitality!”

Ba Qi stared at Tian Chen and laughed out loud as he waved his arm. His entire arm instantly grew longer as he grabbed towards the four-armed race that said they were ugly.

“Oh?”

“This is?”

Ba Qi suddenly made his move. A colorful light suddenly enveloped everyone. It happened in an instant.

“You’re courting death!” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

The expressions of the five fourth level God Emperor realm experts from the four-armed race turned cold. Their four arms instantly condensed into long spears and slashed towards Ba Qi’s arm.

“Bang!”

However, when their long spears slashed onto Ba Qi’s arm, a collision sound was produced.

“Ah!”

A miserable cry sounded. It came from the three four-armed race disciples who said that the poisonous horned dragon species was too ugly.

His body was directly grabbed by eight Qi.

“What!”

The expressions of the four-armed race void God Emperor rank four experts who attacked changed drastically when they saw this scene.

They did not manage to block the attack just now!

“Your mouths are not clean. Let’s Entertain Your Mouths First!”

At this moment, three four-armed race disciples were floating in front of eight Qi. Their bodies could not move, and their eyes were filled with terror.

“No, cough cough cough!”

They roared in terror. However, at the next moment, their mouths began to rot, looking abnormally terrifying.

The rot slowly spread to the area below.

“Ao ao ao ao!”

A strange and terrified roar sounded from their mouths, sounding abnormally miserable.

Hearing this miserable scream, everyone couldn’t help but shiver, and a trace of fear flashed across their faces.

“Dragon Palace, you’re courting death!”

The four-armed race’s God Emperors revealed furious expressions, and a terrifying aura rushed out. The leading five rank four god Emperors moved, and their four arms held four spears as they charged over.

“Kill them, kill those reckless fellows from the Dragon Palace!”

All the disciples of the four-armed race roared coldly.

Over 10,000 of them, the weakest was an undying king level 8.

The powerful aura made everyone on the surrounding planet Pale.

Even the emperor’s pupils contracted, filled with shock.

Everyone stared at this scene.

“Jie Jie Jie, little ones, please take care of the experts from the center of the Universe!”

Mo Sha Roared as a cold and terrifying aura charged out.

“Jie Jie Jie!”

Ba Qi stretched out his arms and black claws that were like viscous liquid attacked the five four-armed god Emperor experts.

“Boom!”

The 10,000 members of the Venom Serpent Dragon soared into the sky with a terrifying aura.

As one of the more powerful dragon species in the Dragon Palace, although they were few in number, the weakest among them had the combat strength of a ninth-level divine king.

Among them, there were 300 divine emperor realm experts.

There were three fourth-level divine emperor realm experts other than Mo Sha du jiu.

In other words, the venom serpent dragon species had five fourth-level divine emperor realm experts.

Eight points had a rank five God emperor combat strength.

A terrifying aura erupted instantly. The cold and terrifying aura caused the four-armed race members who were attacking them to hold their breaths as their pupils slowly dilated!

“Sou Sou Sou!”

At this moment, eight points’s attack had already arrived in front of the five rank four void God emperor experts from the four-armed race.

Feeling the terrifying attack, the expressions of the four of them changed drastically once again.

The collision earlier had already caused them to have a bad premonition. Now, the attack had caused them to feel some fear.

“Peng, Peng, Peng!”

The Spears on their four arms attacked the eight Qi’s condensed arms. The Spears were quickly melted.

The attacks were still attacking them.

“Not good!”

“Oh no, he is a rank five God Emperor!”

The five experts from the four-armed race immediately shouted.

“What!”

Hearing the words of the five experts, the bodies of the four-armed race trembled.

“Get ready to enjoy the pain we bring you. hehehe!”

“Welcome to our Dragon Palace’s Territory!”

Ba Qi laughed with killing intent. His figure instantly appeared in front of the five rank four void God emperor experts from the four-armed race.

“Pu Pu Pu!”

His arms became longer and easily pierced through their bodies.

“Jie Jie Jie!”

At this moment, Mosha poison nine and the rest of the poisonous horned dragon species also charged over. Their sinister and terrifying aura and savage faces caused the faces of the four-armed race members to turn incomparably pale!

“How is this possible!”

An almost invincible aura came crushing towards them as the four-armed race’s divine emperor involuntarily roared.

How could the strength of the Dragon Palace be so strong?

The other party had only sent over 10,000 members and already possessed such a terrifying aura.

There was also that divine emperor rank 5 expert. How was this possible…

The information that they had obtained was not like this!
