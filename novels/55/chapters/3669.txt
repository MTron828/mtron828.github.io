3670 3669 space beasts, Demon Breaker

The Space Beasts of the invincible region were all extremely powerful!

In fact, in the universe, the space beasts were the most powerful existences.

Any one of them had terrifying strength and talent.

Especially in the mountain and sea region.

In the mountain and sea region, there were some powerful space beasts that didn’t even have the ability to break through.

In other words, they could easily break through from the Universe Knight Realm to the universe ruler realm.

Kun was one of them, but they weren’t the only one in the universe.

Some terrifying space beasts, when the pinnacle race experts saw them, they would immediately flee.

Similarly, Kun used divine dragons and Phoenixes as food, and he also liked to devour other pinnacle race experts.

To be able to devour divine dragons and Phoenixes, one could imagine how terrifying his strength was.

“Let’s go and hunt down the space behemoths.”

Wang Xian said to Wu Sha.

In the Invincible Zone, Wang Xian didn’t think that any space behemoths could be his opponent.

With Wu Sha, he was confident that he could hunt down any space behemoths.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Wu Sha nodded her head. With a move, she brought Wang Xian and flew to the right!

At this moment, they were deep in the area. The surrounding trees had already disappeared. The surrounding void was filled with huge meteorites.

Occasionally, they could see some dilapidated divine kingdom buildings.

“In that direction, there is a space beast called lava. It is a fire element space beast. It has an extremely huge body. In the area where it lives, it has a large number of fire meteorites. The strength of the lava space beast is similar to that of a mad demon.”

Wu Sha introduced to Wang Xian as she flew.

Wang Xian nodded and continued flying forward. The temperature in front of him was getting higher and higher.

Before long, meteorites emitting flames appeared in his line of sight.

Boom! Boom

Not far away, there was a sea of flames burning in the void.

“This is the Sea of flames, Dragon King. We have stepped into the territory of the Lava Space Beast. There are usually treasures in these sea of flames.”

As Wu Sha spoke, her body moved and flew straight into the Sea of flames.

Wang Xian followed beside her.

“There really are!”

At this moment, Wu Sha’s eyes lit up as she stared at a fiery-red meteorite in the Sea of flames.

This was an extremely strange fiery-red meteorite. Flames were constantly dripping down from the top!

The Flames dripped into the fiery-red meteorite and formed a small nest.

The entire flaming meteorite was extremely radiant and was also emitting a bright luster.

“Innate spiritual treasure.”

Wang Xian swept his gaze over and said.

“Yes, many innate spiritual treasures are formed naturally. The power of this innate spiritual treasure is not weak.”

The Wizard waved his arm and the wizard’s hand grabbed it over and handed it to Wang Xian.

“This place is really a treasure ground. I easily obtained an innate spiritual treasure.”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and said.

“The place where the space beast lives must be a treasure ground. However, in terms of treasures, the biggest treasure in this entire space is the lava space beast.”

Wu Sha said as she stared ahead. “We have already appeared in its territory and taken some things away. This lava space beast has yet to appear.”

“Let’s go ahead and continue to take a look. With the size of the space beast, it’s very easy to find it.”

As Wang Xian spoke, he continued to fly forward.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

After flying for another hour, violent sounds were suddenly heard.

The sudden roar stunned Wang Xian and the rest. They looked ahead in astonishment.

“HMM? This is the furious roar of the Lava Space Beast. What’s going on? Is it a battle between the Space Beasts? Or are there other experts who have stepped into his territory?”

Wu Sha said.

The two of them continued to fly forward. Soon, the scene in front of them appeared in Wang Xian and the rest’s sight.

“What is this?”

Wang Xian looked over and saw more than a hundred experts dressed in black were surrounding and attacking a gigantic space beast.

Among the over 100 experts, the weakest one was much stronger than the ordinary level three masters of the universe.

Two of them were stronger and were not weaker than the supreme water demon king and the rest!

In the sky above them, a water bottle-like innate true treasure was floating in the sky.

The water in the water bottle flowed down like a terrifying waterfall. It had a terrifying penetrating force!

Below was the lava space behemoth that was a million kilometers in size.

Its entire body was like a sea of fire. It stood upright in the void and its body was similar to that of a human.

On its body, streams of fiery lava were constantly exploding. It was like a flaming meteorite that was about to explode at any moment.

A huge rope was held in the hands of dozens of experts. They were prepared to attack the lava space behemoth.

“This is?”

Wang Xian swept his gaze over and looked at the hundred over experts in astonishment.

These hundred over experts were very strong. The innate treasure in their hands was also very powerful.

However, it was obvious that they were not experts from the same race.

Among these hundred over experts, there were phoenixes, divine tigers, human experts, and wizards.

There were even experts from other races.

It was rare to see more than a hundred experts of such strength working together in the Invincible Zone.

“They are demon breakers. They are experts from the circle of Demon Breakers.”

Wu Sha, who was at the side, recognized this group of experts and said to Wang Xian.

“Demon Breakers?”

Wang Xian nodded his head slightly. This was a circle of experts from the long river and belonged to half of the organizations.

The powerhouses in this organization had the goal of breaking through to the realm of the ruler of the universe.

They had also reached an agreement that once there were powerhouses who had broken through, they would impart their own breakthrough experience.

Such an organization had nearly 200 powerhouses. Among them, there was even a powerhouse who was at the level of a mad demon.

However, that mad demon rarely appeared. Clearly, he was not in a good condition either.

Wang Xian observed them from the side and realized that many of these demon breakers had bought ordinary fruit from him before.

Moreover, they had bought quite a number of them.

“It seems like they got there first.”

Wang Xian mumbled.

“Dragon King, with our strength, we can definitely chase away these demon breakers or even kill them. This lava space beast still belongs to us.” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Wu Sha said coldly.

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered slightly.

In the invincible zone, the strong preyed on the weak. It was even crueler than the outside world.

Killing and snatching treasures were common occurrences.

“Don’t come out for now. I’ll chase them away.”

Wang Xian said. His body moved and emitted a powerful aura as he flew forward.

Boom

When Wang Xian flew over, a terrifying aura surged toward the battlefield.
