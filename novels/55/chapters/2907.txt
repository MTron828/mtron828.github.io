Chapter 2908: had the power of the Dragon Palace behind him

Sensing the stares around him, invincible of battle technique pursed his lips and said nothing.

What could he say?

It was simply too great!

“Sigh, my master, Han tie, should also know that he still came here at this time. Isn’t he tired of living?”

“He has been away for a million years. Why did he come back?”

Invincible battle technique thought to himself.

Following behind, invincible battle technique and the others entered the teleportation array.

“Weng!”

At the next moment, waves of terrifying and savage auras charged over.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

“Boom Boom Boom!”

The roars could be clearly heard as waves of auras charged over.

“Weng Weng Weng Weng!”

Beside them, a group of glazed god Emperors flew into the air and stared coldly at the area in front of them.

Invincible in battle technique also flew into the sky and looked ahead.

The scene was a little blurry. He immediately took out a mirror.

This was the mirror that the Heaven Array had given him back then.

Through the mirror, he could clearly see everything in front of him. He could see the battle on the battlefield.

“Junior brother, what treasure is this?”

By the side, his senior sister and senior brother, who were invincible in battle technique, immediately came over and looked at the mirror.

“This… what a terrifying battlefield!”

When they saw the scene in the mirror, they sucked in a breath of cold air, their faces filled with shock.

In front of them, there was a battle line that was hundreds of millions of miles long in the void.

There were all kinds of war machines standing in a forest.

There were also incomparably powerful technological warships lined up in a row, densely packed so that they could not see the end of the line.

What shocked them the most was that in the picture, there were two incomparably terrifying space beasts. Those space beasts were tens of kilometers in size, and they were fighting with a group of demonic beasts.

“These are Liuli’s two space beasts. They are celestial emperor level Space Beasts!”

Eldest senior brother’s face was filled with shock as he roared in a low voice.

“The First Corps, Second Corps, and Fourth Corps are currently fighting. Let’s go directly to the front lines!”

The Grand Supreme Fourth Elder’s gaze was fixated on the frontlines as he spoke, his eyes flickering as he flew over.

“Let’s Go!”

Divine Emperor Shangshui said. With a wave of his arm, he brought invincible battle technique and the others flying forward.

“We’re heading to the 6th Legion!”

A few divine emperors and a group of experts flew to one side.

Invincible battle technique followed his master and flew towards the 3rd Legion. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

On the front line of the vast battlefield, rows and rows of densely packed experts were gathered there.

“Is this the third legion? There are at least one billion people!”

“The people in front are all god-king level experts. There are so many experts.”

“Look ahead. Those demon caves look so terrifying. The monsters and demons inside seem to be endless!”

Invincible battle method and his brothers followed their master as they approached the battlefield, their faces full of shock.

Such a vast battlefield shocked them greatly.

“All the soldiers of the third legion, Come Here!”

Invincible battle method and the fourth supreme elder came to the front of the battle line, and the fourth supreme elder said directly.

“Yes!”

Seeing the fourth supreme elder and the others coming over, the experts above the eighth level of the Godly King Realm flew over immediately.

“Next, I will be the commander of the Third Legion, and the Green Mountain Godly Emperor will be the deputy commander!”

The fourth supreme elder stared at the soldiers and said directly.

“Yes, greetings to the commander, Greetings to the Deputy Commander!”

The soldiers immediately shouted loudly. When they looked at the god Emperor of Shangshui, they were slightly surprised.

Especially the middle-aged man at the back who was at the eighth level of the Godly King realm. When he saw the god Emperor of Shangshui, his face darkened.

“All commanders, come here!”

At this moment, a voice rang out.

“It’s the voice of the first elder. He should be discussing the next battle plan. Qingshan, let’s go over.”

The fourth supreme elder said to the divine emperor of Shangshui.

“Yes, good!”

“You guys wait here!”

The divine emperor of Shangshui nodded and said to invincible combat style and the others behind him.

“It’s Master!”

Invincible battle technique and the others nodded and stood there, sizing up their surroundings.

“Hei Yao, that vice regiment commander seems to be your uncle.”

When the soldiers of the division saw the division commander and the others leave, they stood there and waited.

At the back, a thin middle-aged man said to the middle-aged man dressed like a mecha.

“I don’t have such an uncle. If it weren’t for him, my father wouldn’t have died.”

The middle-aged man in the mecha roared in a low voice with some anger on his face.

“Hei Yao, don’t be angry. Everything that happened back then was an accident. Didn’t Uncle Qingshan’s children… who would have thought that Uncle Qingshan would return at this time and even break through to become a divine emperor!”

A fat middle-aged man beside him patted his shoulder and comforted him.

“HMPH!”

The middle-aged man dressed in a mech suit didn’t appreciate his kindness. He snorted and didn’t reply.

Even though their conversation wasn’t loud, the few thousand people around were all at least undying level 8, they all heard it clearly.

Invincible also heard it and looked over curiously.

They had some understanding of why their teacher was so far away from home.

However, they could not participate in their master’s family matters.

Some of the surrounding soldiers also looked at invincible battle technique and the few of them, but they did not say anything.

“Third Legion, 123rd Battle Legion, Replace 123rd Battle Legion.”

Very soon, the grand supreme fourth elder and the upper water god Emperor flew over and gave the order.

“Yes!”

The soldiers of 123rd Battle Legion immediately carried out the order and flew forward.

Soon, tens of millions of disciples charged into the void ahead.

That was the battlefield.

However, at this moment, only a few god-emperor-level demonic beasts were participating in the battle. They were being held back by the two space behemoths. There was no demonic god-emperor in other places, so the battlefield was still stable.

However, even if it was stable, a large number of people died.

“Let’s go over!”

The fourth supreme elder said to the divine emperor of Shangshui and flew towards the front of all the soldiers of the third legion.

Out of the one billion soldiers of the third legion, a large portion of them were sitting cross-legged on the ground to cultivate and recover.

The arrival of the divine emperor of Shangshui and the others did not cause any ripples. This was also a military order.

Invincible in battle followed behind. Their eyes swept across the entire legion and they were slightly speechless.

From what they could sense, the number of godly monarch experts in the Third Army alone had reached 300,000.

The number of godly monarchs in the entire glazed domain was estimated to exceed three million.

“I brought you here first to let you see master’s hometown, and second to let you gain some experience.”

“Each of you will have a jade token. You can enter the battlefield to gain some experience. If you encounter any danger, the jade token will immediately bring you back to your own divine kingdom. Once you return, don’t come here for the time being.”

The God Emperor of Shangshui took out four jade tokens and handed them to invincible battle technique and the others.

“It’s Master!”

Invincible battle technique’s three senior brothers and sisters immediately nodded.

He pursed his lips and looked at his master. “Master, is it alright if you don’t enter the battlefield to temper yourselves?”
