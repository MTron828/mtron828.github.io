3624 3623. Is there really an invincible enemy in this world? 2

Run!

Run!

The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace was a monster and an existence that could not be provoked!

Now, they could not understand why they had encountered such a terrifying enemy?

Could it be that the other party had inherited the halo of the entire Divine Dragon Clan?

“Run, can we escape?”

Prime Minister Gui wanted to escape when he saw them?

His face was cold!

“Hahaha, the six great races, our Dragon Palace wants to see where you can run to this time!”

Ba Qi Ao and the others laughed crazily, and a terrifying aura burst out from their bodies!

“Can you escape? This time, I’ll let all of You Die Here!”

The experts of the Dragon Palace roared with murderous intent!

“You think you can kill us and leave so easily?”?

“Then you underestimate the Dragon Palace!”!

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

All the members of the Dragon Palace roared angrily!

Waves of energy shot up into the sky!

“Hiss, what… What’s going on? Why are there so many experts of the Dragon Palace?”

When all the Great Beings of Dragon Palace released their full power, the 71 Great Beings were stunned again!

The power of universe masters with level 3 power was very obvious!

From the Great Beings of Dragon Palace, they could feel more than 100 waves of this terrifying power!

What did this mean?

It meant that Dragon Palace had more than 100 universe masters with level 3 power!

Oh My God!

Do they still need to live?

“How is this possible? Why are there so many experts in the Dragon Palace?”

“Why? How is this possible? I don’t believe it!”

The experts of the six great races were all stunned!

They were completely stunned!

“Hahaha, that Magus is dead. The array formation of our dragon palace has been restored!”

At this moment, a Dragon Magus roared and shouted excitedly! RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Because of the existence of the Black Tower Magi, the spell formation they had set up had lost its effect!

And after the Black Tower Magi died, the spell formation had been restored!

“No, no, no!”

When the Sacred Dragon King and the others heard this, they felt their vision go black.

The Black Tower Magi had once said that the Dragon Palace’s spell formation was their trump card!

After the spell formation exploded, even experts like the grand aquatic demon king had to be careful!

Now that the array formation had been restored?

“Hahaha, we can finally use the equipment of the fire hammer clan to guard the Dragon Palace!”

At this moment, the leaders of the Fire Hammer Dragon Clan of the Dragon Palace laughed crazily. Terrifying holes appeared out of thin air around the Dragon Palace!

Especially the eighteen holes in the center. Each hole gave them a horrifying feeling!

The 18 cannon holes were surrounded by all sorts of complicated engravings, and the aura they gave off was terrifying and strange!

This was Devil Dragon Cannon!

It was the masterpiece of the fire hammer race!

One cannon could threaten a universe master level three great being, and it was suitable for a defensive battle!

“Not good, not good. We have to break the restriction as soon as possible. We have to escape immediately, or we will be finished!”

An expert from the light giant race said in Panic!

“Boom!”

“Ah! AWOOOOO!”

At this moment, a sudden scream came from the side!

When they heard the scream, their bodies trembled violently and they looked to the side!

They saw the flesh and blood on the arms of the supreme water demon king flying everywhere. They saw his body flying backward!

Meanwhile, the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace continued to attack the Taishui Demon King!

Just like the performance of the Black Tower’s Magi, killing the experts of the invincible region was like slaughtering a dog!

“Crash!”

Wang Xian flapped his primaless sacred wings. When he saw the severely injured Taishui demon king, he flew over and transformed his arm into a dragon claw!

The divine light dragon on the Taiji Dragon disc attached itself to it and charged heavily at the Taishui Demon King!

“Ahhhh!”

The Taishui Demon King roared. The flesh on his chest bulged out and formed a flesh and blood defense!

“Bang!”

The attack landed on his flesh and blood defense. His flesh and blood split apart. However, the Taishui Demon King managed to block this attack!

“I blocked it!”

The taishui demon king was pleasantly surprised. He could block the Dragon King’s attack, even if he would be injured!

However, before he could be proud of himself, Wang Xian launched a series of heavy punches at him!

The bright dragon head kept on attacking and biting at his defense!

The most terrifying part of the Tai Chi Dragon Plate was its defense and Backlash!

As long as the attack power of the Tai Chi Dragon Plate was not broken, it was best not to attack Wang Xian.

Otherwise, all the attacks would backfire on him!

Since he could not break through Wang Xian’s defense, his own defense was the best choice!

However, it was a pity that with the support of the Tai Chi Dragon Plate, Wang Xian’s attack power was at the level of a true ruler of the universe!

Therefore, under Wang Xian’s continuous attacks, the Tai Shui Demon King could not hold on for long!

Especially in such close combat, he would not be able to withstand the attacks even if he had ten lives!

Bam

With a heavy blow, the Dragon Claw entered the body of the Taishui Demon King!

Waves of energy dissipated his life force!

“Hehe, you dare to challenge me with this strength? Silly Dog!”

Wang Xian raised his head and spoke calmly to the Taishui Demon King!

Silly Dog, you’re here to die!

The taishui demon king stared at Wang Xian with its huge eyes and its aura slowly disappeared!

“I’m invincible below the level of the universe’s ruler!”

Wang Xian said again indifferently!

The Monster King opened its mouth and its eyes were blood red. “There is no invincible in this world. Explode!”

After saying that, the terrifying energy in its body began to brew!

“Eh? It’s Too Late!”

Wang Xian sensed that the Taiji dragon coiling dark divine dragon had also entered his body!

A corpse quickly fell down!

“Mine, Mine, all mine!”

The king of water tentacles looked at the corpse of the Taishui Demon King and roared with excitement. Then, he flew over quickly!

The corpse was hers!

“It’s over!”

“It’s over!”

From the side, these two words appeared in the minds of the Saint Dragon King and the rest of the experts when they saw the TAISHUI demon king being killed!

It was completely over!

The supreme water demon king was actually killed within a few seconds!

“Oh no!”

When the old scholar saw this scene, his face changed drastically, and his face turned pale!

Weng Weng Weng

At this time, the Dragon Palace’s array formation started to operate, and terrifying dragon pillars appeared in the surroundings!

At the same time, the surrounding sky also changed, and nine-colored energy enveloped it!

Under the Forbidden Sky of the innate supreme treasure, another array formation appeared!

This was the Dragon Palace’s Forbidden Sky Sealing Array Formation!

Another seal appeared in this space!

How could they escape?

“Didn’t the experts of the invincible zone say that they wanted to take the Dragon Palace’s head? Why aren’t they taking it anymore? Are they all trash?”

The Sacred Dragon King couldn’t help but roar when he saw this scene!

Are the experts of the Invincible Zone all trash?

Aren’t they all very confident and arrogant?

Didn’t they say that they wanted to take the Dragon King’s head easily when they came?

What Happened Now?

All of you only know how to F * cking brag, and now you actually put yourselves at risk!

At this moment, they even hated the third Prince of the Angel clan in their hearts!

Why did they look for trash like them?
