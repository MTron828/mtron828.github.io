Chapter 1598: Domineering and Crazy 2

“Senior!”

“Senior!”

Ao Tian and Bing FA Wu walked over and immediately cupped their hands respectfully towards the long-haired old man.

“Let me ask you something. Seven days ago, a dozen young disciples of our Southern Royal Family passed by your icy heart imperial city. Do you know about this?”

Nangong Jianghe saw their respectful expressions and his expression didn’t change at all. He directly asked Bing FA Wu.

“Seven Days Ago?”

Bing FA Wu was slightly taken aback. “Reporting to senior, if the southern royal family’s disciples come, our Bingxin Imperial City will definitely welcome them warmly. Seven days ago, our Bingxin Imperial dynasty was met with an extermination disaster...”

As he spoke, his expression was extremely unsightly.

“Seven days ago, more than ten core disciples of our Southern Royal Family went missing at your place. We haven’t heard from them since!”

Nangong Jianghe said coldly with a gloomy face.

These core disciples had his favorite great-grandson. He didn’t expect them to go missing right now.

In this vast area, who would dare to kill his beloved grandson? Even the experts of the only sect didn’t dare to do so.

“Brother Jianghe, since you’re here, come and have a seat!”

At this moment, the supreme sect master’s voice came from the distant mountain peak.

“Okay!”

Nangong Jianghe looked up and hesitated for a moment before nodding his head.

His figure moved and disappeared in an instant.

“I didn’t expect the patriarch of the southern royal family to come today.”

Wu Qingcheng frowned slightly when he saw the disappearing figure.

“Our patriarch dark eye has already broken through several layers of the black water god Lake’s restrictions. The reason why Patriarch Southern Emperor came this time should be to discuss the issue of alliance with the only sect!”

The old man behind Wu Qing Cheng said with a smile. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Dark eye patriarch is about to break through the restrictions? It seems that the lone sect and the southern Emperor family are getting anxious!”

Wu Qing Cheng was slightly stunned before an excited expression appeared on his face.

A divine tree suddenly appeared in the Black Water God Lake. According to the three superpowers’guesses, this divine tree had powerful functions.

The three superpowers competed with each other and restrained each other. Seeing that the Wuji Empire was about to break the restriction, they naturally had to join forces to fight against them.

This wasn’t something rare.

In fact, the three superpowers often worked together to compete against each other. Sometimes, the Wuji Empire would join forces with the Solitaire sect to deal with the southern royal family.

Other times, the other party would join forces to deal with them.

“Brother Jianghe, I didn’t expect you to come so early!”

On the unitary peak, the unitary sect master sat on a green chair and signaled to Nangong Jianghe.

“More than ten disciples of the southern royal family disappeared in the Bingxin Imperial City. We came here to ask the people of the Bingxin Empire in advance!”

Nangong Jianghe said with a bad expression.

“They disappeared in the Bingxin Empire seven days ago. It must be the work of the Sky Demon!”

The supreme hierarch said calmly, “The sky demon is coming to our sect. We will kill him and give you an explanation!”

“Alright then. Let’s talk about the divine tree in the Black Water Divine Lake!”

Nangong Jianghe nodded. The disciples of the southern royal family should have been killed by the Sky Demon. However, the death of the sky demon basically put an end to this matter.

Even if he felt sorry for his great-grandson, he could only do so much.

“Alright, for the Black Water Divine Lake, if we work together, the Tree of God has a 90% chance of obtaining it. However, for all the gains, we, the supreme sect, want 70% !”

“Oh? The supreme sect leader is so confident? However, this 70% is a little too high!”

“Hehe, it is a little too high, but for that 20% , our supreme sect will have to pay a huge price!”

The supreme headmaster said to Nangong Jianghe.

“I don’t understand why the supreme headmaster is so confident!”

Nangong Jianghe sipped his tea and asked.

“The mistress of the desolate sea wants a treasure from our sect. She wants to use that treasure to lure her out. The southern Royal Family will pay the 20% Price!”

The supreme headmaster said with a smile on his face.

“The mistress of the barren sea?”

Nangong Jianghe narrowed his eyes. “I didn’t expect you to invite her. where is the mistress?”

“Hehe, I invited her today. She will give face to our sect. She should be here soon!”

The supreme headmaster said confidently.

“Okay, I want to see the desolate goddess!”

Nangong Jianghe nodded solemnly.

The desolate sea lord, the desolate goddess, had single-handedly destroyed a first-rate force overnight.

Compared to the Sky Demon’s strength, the desolate goddess was truly terrifying.

This was because even they had to be extremely wary of the desolate goddess.

In fact, they definitely couldn’t become enemies with her because her methods were too strange!

The two leaders of the superpowers were chatting. At Ying Tian Peak’s location, all the powers in the vast region had gathered.

All the powers were clearly seated in different places. Every single one of them was an existence that could shake the entire region for tens of thousands of kilometers.

“Chirp chirp, CHIRP CHIRP!”

“The auspicious time has arrived!”

At noon, the chirping of birds could be heard from the sky.

“It’s the Chaotian Sparrow!”

“The Chaotian Sparrow Demonic Beast clan, a rank seven profound void demonic beast clan!”

Everyone’s powers immediately looked towards the sky. Numerous Green Chaotian sparrows were circling in the sky.

Flower petals directly fell from the sky.

The largest Chaotian Sparrow in the lead let out a human’s voice.

Under the control of Chaotian sparrow, the flower petals kept floating in the sky, making the entire Ying Tian Peak extremely beautiful.

“A seventh level profound void martial stage Chaotian sparrow flying in the sky, this is simply too beautiful!”

“To be able to marry the young lord of Ao Tian is simply a great fortune. Unfortunately, Bing Jian ‘er actually fell in love with the Sky Devil!”

“Perhaps Bing Jian ‘ER has already gone back on her words and is prepared to spend the rest of her life with the young lord of Ao Tian. After all, if she marries the young lord of Ao Tian, she might be able to become the Supreme Headmaster’s wife in the future!”

The birds flew in the sky, and the young men and women from all the factions raised their heads in shock.

Using a seventh level void interpretation demonic beast to dress up a wedding was something that only the three super factions could do.

This could be said to be something that made all the women present extremely envious. They wished that they were the ones who would marry Young Master Ao Tian.

“Let’s welcome the bride and groom!”

A woman’s voice sounded from a stone platform in front of Ying Tian Peak.

There were flower petals placed on it.

Spiritual pearls were placed on both sides, rows upon rows of extremely luxurious pearls.

They were all connected to the cave dwelling where the bride of Ying Tian Peak was.

When the woman’s voice fell, Ling Jian ‘er, who was wearing a red veil, and the arrogant young master ao Tian walked out.

The two of them walked all the way to the stone platform.

Young Master AO Tian swept his gaze over everyone around him, his cold and arrogant face filled with a smile.

All the forces around him were gathered on young master aotian and Ling Jian ‘ER.

“Please welcome the groom’s relatives!”

“Please welcome the bride’s relatives!”

The woman stood at the front, her face full of smiles as she continued to shout.

At the back, Bing FA Wu slowly walked over, his face squeezing out traces of a smile.

With the destruction of the Iceheart dynasty, it was already very difficult for him to be able to smile.

“Hehe, my son getting married is the happiest time for me as his mother!”

A graceful and elegant lady walked over slowly.

“Mother!”

Ao Tian turned around and shouted with a smile on his face.

“Haha, Tian ‘Er is getting married. As her father, I naturally have to attend personally!”

At this moment, a voice came from the sky and two figures flew over instantly.

One figure landed at the front of the southern royal family and sat down.

The other figure landed beside ao Tian with a smile on his face.

“Father!”

Ao Tian immediately bowed.

Supreme Headmaster!

Around him, tens of thousands of elite disciples and powerhouses of Supreme Headmaster quickly bowed to show their respect.

All the forces around were filled with respect.

“Haha, Welcome to My Son’s wedding. is everyone here?”?

The supreme sect leader stood on the stage and smiled as he scanned the surrounding people.

When everyone saw this scene, their hearts trembled. It was about to begin!

“Supreme sect leader, all the factions have arrived, but the desolate goddess has yet to arrive. Other than that, there is still one person who has yet to arrive. I wonder if he will still come!”

An old man cupped his hands and reported from below.
