3801 All 3,800 were annihilated

The Archangel’s secret message’s attacks were all aimed at LAN qingyue.

Following that, all the experts of the angel race fled in one direction.

Yes!

They wanted to escape!

After witnessing the terrifying battle strength of the three Kun, they prepared to escape.

This wasn’t a battle of the same level.

“Wishful thinking!”

Lan Qingyue’s eyes turned cold when she saw the attacks of the Archangel’s secret message attacking her.

There were more than 20 attacks, and each attack was extremely terrifying!

Lan Qingyue waved her arm. In the next instant, Xiao Lan’s figure disappeared in front of her.

When she reappeared, she was already around Lan Qingyue.

That’s right, around!

Xiao Lan’s mouth opened, and Lan Qingyue and Wang Xian stood on it.

She waved her arm, and a surge of energy surged into Xiao Lan’s body.

“Woo Woo!”

Xiao Lan also let out a low growl. One by one, the blurry shadows of the Kun gathered.

The Shadows instantly met the attack of the Archangel’s secret message.

“Boom Boom Boom Boom!”

A terrifying collision sound was heard. The attacks made the shadows of the Kun even more illusory!

However, they were only illusory!

The Archangel’s secret language attacks had no effect at all.

As for the Archangel’s secret language attacks, each attack would take at least a year.

In other words, after this attack, their trump cards would disappear!

“Little blue, destroy them!”

Lan Qingyue ordered little blue when she saw this!

“Wu Wu Wu!”

Little Blue growled and moved, instantly chasing after the experts of the angel race!

His mouth was wide open, and his speed was extremely terrifying!

With a slight sway, he caught up with the experts of the angel race who were preparing to escape.

“Is this the power of the ancient god Kun-master?”

“The trump card of the angel race, the Archangel secret language that can kill a ruler at the seventh stage realm, all of the attacks were aimed at the ancient god kun-master and were easily blocked. Isn’t the ancient god Kun-master too strong?”

“That Kun instantly arrived around the ancient god kun-feeding master, but I didn’t sense it at all. What kind of strange energy is this, space movement?”

“The trump cards of the angel race are completely useless. They can’t escape at all. That Kun is too strong!”

Everyone in the surrounding area was shocked by Lan Qingyue’s move.

That was the trump card of the angel race, yet it was blocked so easily. This was simply inconceivable!

Perhaps this was the legendary ancient god Feeding Kun Lord!

“It’s over, it’s over, how is this possible?”

“How can our trump card be so easily blocked? How is this possible?”

“It’s over, it’s over, we’re completely finished!”

The fleeing experts of the angel race sensed the scene behind them and felt Little Blue’s might. They were in complete despair.

They had thought that the Phoenix clan would give them some power.

However, they had never thought that their own power couldn’t withstand a single blow!

“Just what kind of enemy has the third Prince Provoked?”

An angel of light couldn’t help but shout out in despair!

When the third Prince heard this, his heart was as dead as Ash!

He was in complete despair!

He had the treasure to resurrect. If he died this time, he could also resurrect through the treasure!

But what was waiting for him after resurrection?

He knew!

What was waiting for him was to be refined into a battle angel.

This time, even his father couldn’t protect him.

In fact, his father wouldn’t even protect him.

Because this time, he had made a huge mistake!

It was so huge that it had caused an unimaginable loss to the angel clan.

“Third Prince, your life is mine. I will personally kill you!”

At this moment, the Dragon King’s voice sounded beside his ear.

The third Prince looked over and saw the Dragon King who was very close to him. His eyes were filled with unwillingness!

The person in front of him was an ant that he looked down on in the slightest!

If he had known earlier, he would have ordered his subordinates in the ruler realm to destroy the Dragon King.

Even if it was against the rules of the peak race.

But now, it was too late!

Buzz

In the next moment, Wang Xian’s palm grabbed the third prince’s neck directly. A wave of destructive energy immediately rushed into his body, causing him to be severely injured in an instant.

At this moment, the third Prince’s fighting spirit had completely disappeared. His face was filled with grief!

Wang Xian waved his arm and the five elements millstone appeared under his feet. He threw the third prince’s body onto the five elements millstone.

One of Wang Xian’s feet stepped on his face.

Public humiliation!

“Ahhhhhhh!”

The third prince seemed to be unable to withstand such humiliation. He roared indignantly.

The energy in his body surged out and he wanted to commit suicide.

“Bang!”

However, Wang Xian moved his right foot and directly destroyed all the energy in his body, completely confining it.

He moved his body and flew back to his previous position.

“Ahhhhh!”

“No, no, no, don’t!”

At this moment, the escaping experts of the angel race let out screams of despair.

Xiao Lan opened her mouth and could devour the stars.

The group of Angels had no room to dodge.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

“Woo! Woo! Woo!”

“Wu Wu Wu!”

At this moment, the little house and Little White also attacked the angels.

An ancient sound rang out as their enormous bodies charged towards the group of Phoenixes!

“Run!”

“Run!”

The two phoenixes who had forcefully upgraded saw this scene and flapped their Phoenix Wings, one on the left and one on the right, trying to escape into the distance.

Their strength had been upgraded.

They had a chance to escape!

They still had a chance to survive!

“Xiao Bai’s little house, lock onto them. Leave the rest to me.”

Lan Qingyue said faintly. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Wang Xian stepped on the third Prince’s head and watched this scene with a smile on his face.

Escape?

Where could they escape to?

This was the starry universe, the territory of the space behemoths.

It was Xiao Lan’s world!

They had a natural advantage here!

“None of them can escape!”

“How can we escape? What can we use to escape?”

“Just wait for death, and you still think of escaping!”

The experts of the peak races couldn’t help but say when they saw this scene.

At the same time, they were extremely shocked by the strength of the ancient god Kun Master and Kun.

They also showed a trace of respect for the Dragon Palace!

The rise of the Dragon Palace was inevitable!

With the Dragon King’s potential, he might not be able to reach the ruler realm, but he should be able to reach the peak ruler realm without any problems.

At that time, with the addition of the ancient god Kun master, the glory of the Divine Dragon Clan would be restored.

Even now, the twelve peak races could be changed to the thirteen peak races!

“I wonder what will happen if the angel race and the Phoenix race know about the situation here?”

“I wonder what will happen if the other powerful disciples in the nine-origin universe see the third Prince of the angel race being trampled under the Dragon King’s Feet?”

The surrounding powerful disciples looked at this scene in shock and muttered.
