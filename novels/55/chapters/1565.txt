Chapter 1566: 1566 sages of Light 5

“Greetings, Morning Light Patriarch!”

The radiant priest of the Divine Light Dynasty, Morning Light Patriarch, arrived.

He bowed respectfully to the bald black-eyed elder, while the rest of the radiant priests bowed respectfully to morning light patriarch!

As an existence like the patriarch of the radiant priest world, all the radiant priests had to bow when they saw him.

“Eh? Morning Light? Your strength has improved quite a bit again?”

Dark eye patriarch sized up morning light with his abyss-like eyes, and a trace of surprise appeared on his face.

“It’s my Lord. He has improved a bit, reaching the peak of the eighth level of the profound void tier!”

Morning Light Patriarch smiled.

“Master, quickly look at my brother. He has been possessed by the soul of Darkness!”

Wu Qingyan hurried over when she saw the old man. She said anxiously.

“Don’t worry, Qingyan. Master will do everything he can to cure the crown prince of Wuqing City!”

Forefather of dawn light said with determination in his eyes.

Because of Wu Qingyan, the relationship between Divine Light Empire and Wuji Empire was pretty good.

This time, if he could cure the crown prince of Wuqing City, his relationship with Wuji Empire would be closer.

At that time, as long as Wuji Empire was around, his divine light empire would not suffer a destructive disaster.

“Brother Chenguang, quickly take a look at Qing city!”

The elder holding the dark staff hurriedly indicated.

“Yes!”

Chenguang forefather respectfully nodded at him and immediately walked to the side of Wuqing City.

“Forefather, the crown prince of Wuqing City has more than ten sixth level void interpretation dark souls entering his body. It’s very troublesome!”

A few experts from the Bingxin dynasty, Tian Qingguang, and the others immediately walked over and whispered.

Forefather Chenguang nodded, and his gaze swept over Wuqing City, revealing a trace of solemnity.

“Forefather, the He clan’s people have arrived!”

“Forefather, the Bingxin dynasty’s people have arrived!”

At this moment, two voices came from the side.

Behind the two middle-aged men were the He clan and the Bingxin dynasty’s people.

Even the bingxin King had rushed over.

The experts from the Wuji dynasty called them over, and they didn’t dare to be the slightest bit negligent.

“We pay our respects to Patriarch Dark Eye!”

Everyone looked at the bald black-eyed elder and felt a chill in their hearts. They immediately bowed respectfully.

“En!”

Patriarch dark eye slowly nodded.

“He clan, do you know where that young man called priest Wang is located?”

The elder holding the dark staff looked at the He clan and asked.

“Eh?”

The He clan members were slightly stunned. He Yuan, who was standing beside an elder, was shocked.

He hesitated for a moment and took a step forward. “Senior, may I know why you are looking for priest Wang?”

“He Yuan, you don’t have to worry. We have no ill intentions. Right now, my brother has been invaded by the soul of darkness. I heard that priest Wang had cured a young man who had been invaded by darkness, so I brought him here!”

Wu Qingyan looked at He Yuan and said directly.

“Reporting to senior, Princess Qingyan. To be honest, I haven’t seen that brother of mine since he left the Crown Prince’s mansion in Wu Qing City!”

When he yuan heard Wu Qingyan’s words, he swept his gaze across the room and immediately said.

“You don’t Know? You Can’t find where he lives?”

Wu Qingyan frowned.

“He Yuan doesn’t dare to hide anything!”

He Yuan shook his head.

“Miss Ling Jian ‘er, do you know where priest Wang is currently?”

Wu Qingyan turned her head and looked towards the location of the Bingxin Empire.

Her gaze landed on Ling Jian ‘er who was at the side.

Seeing Wu Qingyan’s gaze, the bingxin king was slightly stunned.

“Princess Qingyan, this adopted daughter of mine is called Bing Jian ‘ER. I don’t think she knows that priest Wang!” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

He hurriedly replied.

Ling Jian ‘er also looked at Wu Qingyan with a frown. It was obvious that the words ‘ling Jian ‘er’had caused her to be slightly confused.

“This lady is indeed called Ling Jian ‘Er. That priest Wang has been looking for her for a very long time. Miss Ling Jian ‘er, do you know where priest Wang is now?”

Wu Qingyan looked at Ling Jian ‘ER and continued to ask.

“This...”

Ling Jian ‘er felt a little absent-minded as she thought of the statue that was placed at the entrance every day.

She felt that the other party might be not far away from her, but she did not know exactly where the other party was.

Bing jinghuan, who was at the side, slightly clenched his fists as he stared at Ling Jian ‘ER.

“I don’t know where he is either?”

Ling Jian ‘er shook her head.

Wu Qingyan frowned when she heard her answer.

“Qingyan, that priest Wang came to the vast region from hundreds of thousands of miles away to look for this lady?”

At this moment, the elder holding the dark scepter asked faintly.

“Yes, grandfather. I came to look for her. I thought she should know...”

Wu Qingyan nodded.

“That’s simple!”

The elder holding the dark scepter nodded and opened his mouth slightly.

“Priest Wang, this Miss Ling Jian ‘ER is with us. Please come over!”

A voice suddenly resounded throughout all the regions of the Kingdom of God ruins.

Everyone could hear the elder’s words.

His words made Ling Jian ‘er frown slightly.

A simple sentence from the Wuji Empire revealed how overbearing they were.

It was very simple to tell Wang Xian that since Ling Jian ‘er was with them, it was best for him to come over.

Although his tone wasn’t too harsh, it was filled with a faint threat.

“Who is that priest Wang?”

However, at this moment, forefather Chenguang, who was standing beside Wuqing City, suddenly raised his eyebrows and asked indifferently.

“Master, it’s a young man with monstrous strength. He has the strength of the seventh level of the profound void Martial Stage!”

Wu Qing Yan immediately answered.

“Oh? The cultivation base of the seventh level of the profound void martial stage?”

Grand ancestor Chen Guang was slightly surprised.

“Grand ancestor, that guy is very arrogant. At that time, not only did he say that the son of light is trash, but he also said that the daughter of light of Princess Qing Yan is trash. He is very arrogant!”

Tian Qingguang, who was at the side, immediately said with an embarrassed expression.

“Oh? He actually called Qingyan and Qingguang Trash? I want to see how capable he is!”

The chenguang patriarch slightly narrowed his eyes and said indifferently.

“Master, he is indeed powerful!”

Wu Qingyan glanced at Tian Qingguang and said indifferently.

“Hehe, even if he is powerful, he doesn’t have the right to call me Chenguang’s beloved disciple!”

Forefather of the morning light stroked Wu Qingyan’s head and said coldly.

“That’s true. That fellow is indeed a little arrogant. HMPH!”

Wu Qingyan smiled at her master.

She called Wang Xian over because she wanted to give it a try. In her heart, the most powerful radiant priest was her master.

“HMM?”

At this moment, Wang Xian, who was sitting cross-legged in the room to balance the light and darkness, opened his eyes when he heard this voice. A hint of coldness flashed across his eyes.

“Why are you looking for me?”

Wang Xian frowned slightly.

However, he did not hesitate. He stood up immediately and flew towards the front of the Wuji Empire’s palace.

“Dragon King, the Dragon Queen was called over by the Wuji Empire to look for you. She probably wants you to save their crown prince!”

Ao Yao’s voice was heard when Wang Xian entered the Wuji Empire’s area.

He nodded his head slowly and looked at the place where the radiant priests were gathered.

“All the powerhouses of Wuji Empire, your invitation is really something new!”
