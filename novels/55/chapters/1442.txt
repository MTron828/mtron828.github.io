Chapter 1443: 1443 collected some interest before he left

“You, you, you...”

Upon hearing Wang Xian’s teasing words, crown prince Tang Xuewen pointed at him with a sullen face. He was extremely furious.

The Blood Emperor and the three emperors stared at Wang Xian with gloomy expressions. Their breathing was a little hurried.

It was a blatant taunt and a blatant provocation.

This was the first time someone dared to taunt them like this in the flowing sea region.

However, they had no other way.

“Hiss, this... this...”

In the surrounding area, the people who had arrogantly shouted that they wanted to destroy the dragon-phoenix Empire’s Sky Sword sect and the others.

The people who had arrogantly shouted that those who dared to offend my blood flow empire would die were now filled with fear.

They looked at the shadow floating in the sky, the energy behind it that was more than 2,000 meters tall.

It was as if there was a sharp dagger placed in front of his neck, ready to deal a fatal blow to them at any moment.

They were afraid, they were afraid.

They would never have imagined this scene.

The dynasty that they thought was invincible and tyrannical was actually being mocked by others.

“I’ll give you 10 seconds to open the formation. Otherwise, I’ll start killing!”

“As long as I make a move, I’m afraid that the entire bloody flow imperial city won’t be enough for me to kill!”

Ao Yao’s extremely cold voice came from the sky.

The undisguised threat entered everyone’s ears.

“Gulp!”

The surrounding citizens, whose faces were filled with fear, hurriedly looked at the blood emperor and the other experts within the array.

Their eyes were filled with pleading.

They didn’t want to die.

“Alright, Alright!”

The Blood Emperor held the blood-red spear in his hand tightly. Gritting his teeth, he stared at ao Yao and growled, “Deactivate the formation!”

Buzz

At the back, two insightful void stage powerhouses immediately deactivated the formation.

“Get out of our bloody flow Imperial City!”

The blood emperor suppressed his crazy killing intent and shouted at Wang Xian and the rest.

“You guys leave First!”

Wang Xian smiled and looked at Feng Luan and the rest.

“Xiao Xian, be careful!”

Feng Luan looked at him and said with a smile.

“Don’t worry. The bloodshed empire only has four sixth-level void interpretation. It’s impossible to kill us!”

Wang Xian said confidently to Feng Luan.

Just as he said, even if Wang Xian, Ao Yao, and sect leader Ling couldn’t defeat the bloodshed empire, they wouldn’t be killed.

“Okay!”

Feng Luan nodded and looked at the king of the Kingdom of Light Dragon and sect leader Yi.

“Thank you, Lord Wang Xian. The Kingdom of light dragon is the closest to here. Let’s return to the Kingdom of Light Dragon First!”

The king of the Kingdom of Light Dragon took a deep breath and bowed to Wang Xian in gratitude.

Today, if Wang Xian did not hide a powerhouse at level six of the Seethrough Void Tier, they would have died without a doubt.

Even the entire Guanglong Empire would be destroyed.

Compared to Wang Xian killing one of his unfilial sons back then, compared to the favor he owed him this time, it could be completely canceled out.

Wang Xian waved his hand. Feng Luan and the rest looked at the blood emperor and the rest. They walked out with smiles on their faces.

The group of them left directly under the gaze of everyone in the Imperial City of bloodshed.

Wang Xian stood there and watched Feng Luan and the rest disappear quickly with a smile on his face.

“I really don’t understand what benefits your blood flow empire will get if they fall out with us!”

Sect Master Ling looked at the Blood Emperor and the rest and shook his head slowly.

“We, the blood flow empire, will remember today’s humiliation. We will definitely exterminate all of you in the future!”

The Blood Emperor swore with an extremely cold expression.

“If you don’t Kill Us this time, it will be even harder to kill us in the future!”

Sect leader Ling’s expression turned cold as well. “Remember, your blood flow empire will not be able to control the sky in this flowing sea region in the future!”

“Scram. There will be plenty of time in the future. I will make you regret it!”

The Blood Emperor raised his long spear and shouted coldly.

Sect leader Ling looked at Feng Luan and the rest who had already disappeared. He exchanged a glance with Wang Xian.

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian looked at Ao Jian and said to him.

“Yes!”

Ao jian nodded his head. With a move of his body, he disappeared into the void.

The energy behind him also disappeared.

After exchanging a glance with sect leader Ling, the two of them flew out directly.

“Eh? Little brother Wang Xian, why did you suddenly stop?”

When the two of them flew out of the city, sect leader Ling looked at Wang Xian who had suddenly stopped and looked at him in puzzlement.

“Since they dared to attack us, we naturally have to collect some interest before we return!”

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly and turned around to look at the glorious city of the blood flow empire.

“Huh?”

Sect leader Ling revealed an astonished expression. He suddenly sensed the surroundings and his eyes flickered.

“Damn it!”

When they saw Wang Xian and the rest leaving, the blood emperor and the three emperors shook the weapons in their hands with an awkward expression.

The four of them had dark expressions on their faces as they swept their gaze across the destroyed buildings and the five to six thousand people who had died. They took a deep breath.

Their bodies moved and flew directly towards the imperial palace. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Below them, Crown Prince Tang Xuewen had a dark expression on his face. He turned around and walked towards the imperial palace with a face full of anger.

Behind him, the group of insightful void martial artists looked at each other in dismay.

No one had expected that the incomparably domineering blood flow empire would actually suffer a huge setback here.

No one had expected that the four powers of the dragon-phoenix Empire’s Sky Sword sect would be so terrifying.

The situation in the flowing sea region would change in the future.

The blood flow empire citizens on both sides no longer had the arrogance they had before.

They looked at the crown prince who walked back to the palace in anger and sighed helplessly.

Today, the blood flow empire had lost!

“Dong Dong Dong!”

At this moment, the crown prince of Bloody Dynasty who was walking towards the palace suddenly froze.

Following that, the sound of a strange rubber ball hitting the ground could be heard.

When some of the people who were watching the crown prince saw the scene in front of them, they felt their breathing stop.

They widened their eyes and their bodies started to tremble violently.

Heads rolled down!

“Your Highness the Crown Prince!”

“Your Highness the Crown Prince!”

A series of terrified voices suddenly sounded, and even more people scanned their surroundings vigilantly.

Dead, their highness the Crown Prince had actually been killed directly.

Without the slightest sign, no one noticed the assassin.

“It must be that black and white sixth level void interpretation expert just now, it must be him!”

One of the Kings felt a chill on his back, as if a hand was pressing down on his neck, as he muttered in fear.

A rank five void interpretation expert had been silently killed.

If they had such an enemy, they would not be able to sleep or eat in peace.

“Boom!”

Right at this moment, a terrifying voice carrying boundless killing intent flew out from the palace.

When he saw his son’s corpse in front of the imperial palace, his eyes were blood red.

“Dragon-phoenix dynasty, Sky Sword Sect, Light Dragon Dynasty, and Blood Stream sect, just you wait. I, the Blood Emperor, Will Destroy You!”

A crazy roar came out of the blood emperor’s mouth and resounded throughout the entire blood stream imperial city.

Everyone was shocked!
