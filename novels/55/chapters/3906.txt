Translator: 549690339

The power of the Dragon Palace was displayed, and the Allies of the Phoenix clan rushed over as well!

Four level seven masters versus four level seven space beasts!

From the looks of it, they were evenly matched!

In the starry city, all the strong disciples stared at the group of experts from the Dragon Palace and the Phoenix clan outside. Their eyes sparkled.

Wang Xian stared at the four cosmic behemoths who were at the seventh level and sized them up.

When his gaze landed on the more than 20,000 strong practitioners from the Phoenix clan, a smile appeared on his face!

These more than 20,000 phoenixes would become the best resources for the Dragon Palace!

“Is this the trump card of your Phoenix Clan? It’s not enough. If this is all you have, you will still die!”

Wang Xian did not speak. Behind him, the leader of the succubus dragon species slowly flew into the sky!

The group of succubus dragon species also floated in the sky.

Boom

Boom

In the next second, waves of powerful aura were emitted from their bodies.

The powerful aura that belonged to a master of level seven surged into the sky!

A rank 7 ruler was nothing.

However, more than 170 rank 7 rulers were terrifying!

The Succubus Dragon held the black spider lily!

They had a weird expression on their faces.

“Let me introduce myself. Dragon Palace, Succubus Dragon, your power isn’t enough!” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

The leader of the succubus dragon stared at the experts of the Phoenix clan and said coldly!

When more than 170 succubus dragon-type rulers of the seventh rank revealed their power, the 20,000-plus rulers of the Phoenix clan were slightly shocked!

“This? How can there be so many rulers of the seventh rank in the Dragon Palace? How is this possible? There are more than 170 of them?”

The Phoenix clan ‘s leader, a Level 7 ruler, narrowed his eyes and said in disbelief!

On their side, only 40 or so level 7 rulers had come!

These 40 or so were already quite a number!

There were more than 170 of them. The entire Phoenix clan didn’t have so many level 7 rulers.

How could the Dragon Palace have them?

In the past, the Dragon Palace only had some level 1 and level 2 sovereign realm experts.

In just tens of millions of years, less than 100 million years, the Dragon Palace had more than 170 level 7 sovereign realm experts.

The speed of their improvement was unbelievable.

More than 170 level 7 sovereign realm experts could kill more than 20,000 level 7 sovereign realm experts!

“What? There are so many masters of the seventh level in the Dragon Palace?

How… how could they improve so fast?”

“What kind of fortune did the Dragon Palace get? How could they produce so many masters of the seventh level? It hasn’t even been 100 million years. How is this possible?”

“Hiss, is this the trump card of the Dragon Palace? Although there are few masters of the Dragon Palace this time, they are all top-tier existences. When their peak combat power is equal, the dragon palace is much stronger!

“What kind of opportunity did the Dragon Palace obtain? Could it be an opportunity comparable to our peak race’s treasure lands?”

On the starry city, all the expert disciples were shocked when they saw this

scene.

In the beginning, the ancient god kun-rearing master and the four allies of the Phoenix race had attracted their attention.

They hadn’t noticed the group of subordinates behind the Dragon King.

But now, these subordinates were actually so powerful!

So terrifying!

“More than 170 rank seven ruler realm experts. It looks like your Dragon Palace has obtained an enormous fortune and treasure. Very good!

The leader of the Phoenix race, the rank seven ruler Realm Phoenix, stared coldly at the succubus dragon seed and the others!

“If you don’t have any trump cards, you can die.

The leader of the Succubus Dragon said coldly!

“Haha, You Want Us To Die? Do you think your Dragon Palace can destroy us today? The ones who will die will be you. Today, we will let you know the consequences of offending our Phoenix Clan!

“After today, the Dragon Palace will be completely eliminated from the starry universe and the 9-origin Universe!”

The Level 7 ruler of the Phoenix clan roared with a grim expression!

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

As soon as he finished speaking, two enormous creatures flew out from the back.

The two enormous roars caused everyone to be shocked.

They immediately looked towards the source of the sound. When they saw the two enormous space beasts, they were shocked.

“This… This Is?”

One of the two space beasts had three heads and looked like a terrifying python. Its lower body looked extremely bloated, but its upper body was filled with sharp thorns!

The other space beast looked like a gorilla and had an enormous horn on its head!

This horn was actually about the same height as its body. It was extremely strange and strange!

Their auras were no weaker than the other four universe overlord Level 7 Space Beasts!

“Another two universe overlord Level 7 Space Beasts. Are these space beasts allies of the Phoenix Race?”

“No, these two universe overlord Level 7 Space Beasts don ‘t have intelligence. They should have been tamed by the Phoenix race. They actually tamed two universe overlord Level 7 Space Beasts!

“Hiss, these are universe ruler Level 7 space beasts. It’s unbelievable that there are two more of them!

“Two of these level of strength have completely crushed the Dragon Palace! All the disciples of the 9-origin universe were shocked when they saw this scene.

The Phoenix clan still had a trump card!

And it was such a terrifying trump card!

“The Phoenix clan must have used the four space beasts to get their help. The Dragon Palace’s Dragon King and the rest are going to be in trouble for taming these two space beasts that are at the seventh level of the Universe Overlord Realm!

Some of the powerful experts from the other peak races mumbled to themselves!

The surrounding powerful experts nodded their heads in agreement.

When Wang Xian saw the two space beasts that were at the seventh level of the Universe Overlord realm appearing again, he raised his eyebrows slightly.

“Hahaha, Dragon Palace, Dragon King, what about our Phoenix clan’s trump The level seven universe dominator of the Phoenix clan laughed maniacally and glared at Wang Xian with a face full of killing intent. “However, do you think this is the end?”

He laughed sinisterly and added another sentence!

“Today, the Dragon Palace will be destroyed and the Dragon King will die!

As soon as he finished his sentence, a voice suddenly sounded from the city wall of the starry city.

The sudden voice shocked everyone and they immediately turned their heads to look..
