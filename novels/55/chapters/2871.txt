Chapter 2872: breakthrough, Wind God Dragon Wings

“It’s the Dragon King!”

The nine wind god Dragons looked at the wind jade one by one, and their eyes revealed a heated expression.

More than 40 Wind Jade at the first rank God Emperor Realm and one at the second rank God Emperor Realm.

The energy of these wind jade could at least allow two wind god dragons to have the strength of a second rank void God Emperor realm, or even more.

“Dragon King, after the nine wind god Dragons have advanced, we will be able to destroy the formation sorcerer association and the Imperial Court.”

Prime Minister Gui said with a smile on his face.

“MN. However, it might still be a little difficult to destroy the emperor and the Magi.”

Wang Xian nodded his head slightly. With a wave of his arm, 48 holy feathers appeared in front of him.

With a move of his body, the prieless sacred wings appeared behind him.

Buzz

A wave of energy enveloped the bunch of holy feathers. He closed his eyes slightly.

As long as he could nurture all these holy feathers, the god of wind wings of the incipient holy wings would be completed.

Wang Xian was looking forward to the changes that would happen when the time came.

In the next few days, Wang Xian had been nurturing a bunch of holy feathers in the Dragon King Palace.

Nurturing one at a time was similar to nurturing 48 holy feathers at a time. According to Wang Xian’s estimation, it would only take a few days to nurture them.

Buzz

Three days later, the uninitiated holy wings on Wang Xian’s back quivered. The holy feathers in front of him also quivered slightly.

The 48 somewhat illusory holy feathers were now like green scales. A small divine dragon condensed from the wind attribute was hovering above them.

Every single holy feather was filled with pressure.

Wang Xian stood up slowly and the uninitiated holy wings appeared behind him.

Buzz

The entire genesis wings trembled violently. The holy feather in front of him flew towards the genesis wings slowly and fused with one of the holy feathers on it.

Chirp! Chirp! Chirp

When the group of holy feathers covered the genesis wings and one of the wings, an extremely sharp roar appeared in Wang Xian’s mind.

A blurry shadow seemed to be circling in his mind.

The shadow had two gigantic wings. One of the wings was green in color and contained the terrifying wind attribute laws.

The other wing was covered in lightning. However, the other wing seemed to be illusory at the moment.

“Crash!”

At this moment, the wings on Wang Xian’s back emitted a sound. The wind attribute wings on the left side emitted a powerful green glow.

Wang Xian hovered above the Dragon King Palace slowly. The wings on his back flapped slightly.

On the wings, streams of wind-attribute law energy circulated.

Buzz

At this moment, the circulating law energy slowly flowed along the wings, along the bones of the origineless holy wings, and surged into Wang Xian’s body.

“Eh? This Is?”

Wang Xian felt a surge of energy entering his body, pulling the five elements and light and darkness in his body.

This made his heart tremble slightly.

Boom

All of a sudden, it was as though a violent wind had surged into his body. The whistling sound of the wind from within his body could be heard continuously.

“This is the power of the Holy Feathers. The 49 holy feathers carried a terrifying amount of energy and entered my body directly!”

“Oh no, my physical body can’t withstand this energy. The wind attribute laws are tearing my body apart!”

Wang Xian’s expression changed as his pupils contracted slightly.

He could feel the violent wind attribute energy entering his body and tearing his physical body apart!

Buzz

However, at this moment, a surge of energy was transmitted from the inceptive sage wings on his back. The energy entered his body and protected his body.

Every time the wind attribute tore a wound, it would be healed instantly by the energy transmitted from the inceptive sage wings.

The five elements power in his body and the light and darkness power in his body began to circulate rapidly.

Waves of spiritual energy surged into his body crazily in the surroundings.

“This is? The five elements power and light and darkness power in my body feel threatened and want to absorb the spiritual energy to grow stronger!”

“The surrounding spiritual energy is also being drawn by the wind element law power and is surging over rapidly.”

“Roar!”

Wang Xian mumbled and immediately transformed into a seven-colored divine dragon.

He crouched in the Dragon King’s palace and absorbed the surrounding spiritual energy rapidly.

The dragon energy in his body was increasing at a terrifying speed.

Wang Xian’s eyes were filled with excitement when he saw this scene.

This was an opportunity for him to increase his strength.

Closing his dragon eyes, Wang Xian crouched in the Dragon King’s palace and recovered quickly.

Ding! “Congratulations on your upgrade, host. You have reached Immortal King Level 6!”

After an unknown period of time, the system’s voice rang in Wang Xian’s mind.

He was delighted.

“I can withstand the wind attribute law energy in my body. It’s about time.”

At this moment, Wang Xian sensed the energy in his body and smiled.

The fusion of the 49 holy feathers and the incipient holy wings had raised his strength by one level.

His heart moved and his attributes appeared in his mind.

“Immortal King Level 6. I can now fight against a Level 2 void God realm existence.”

Wang Xian mumbled as he felt the majestic strength in his body. His body moved.

Boom

His body flew directly towards the sky.

Two gigantic wings appeared on the back of his majestic dragon body. One of the wings was similar to the wings of the wind god Dragon. However, it was filled with an aura that was more powerful than the wings of the wind god Dragon.

There were no feathers on the other wing. It was a little strange.

Wang Xian’s mind moved and he transformed into his human form.

Whoosh

The huge wings followed his body and became two meters in size. The left wing contained a vast wind power while the right wing was a little strange.

Wang Xian could feel his control over the wind.

His body moved.

Boom

The next moment, his body came to the sky above the Dragon Island. Looking over, the entire Dragon Island was abnormally small.

“This speed?”

Wang Xian’s eyes were filled with excitement as his wings flapped slightly.

“Boom!”

At the next moment, his body appeared at the end of the Dragon Island. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

How Big was the Dragon Island? Even a level one godly monarch would need more than ten hours to fly at top speed. If it was slower, it would take a few days.

However, with just a flap of his wings, he could travel from one side of the Dragon Island to the other in a few seconds.

“This speed is definitely not something that a level two void God emperor can compare to. At least a level three void God Emperor!”

Wang Xian’s eyes were glowing.

“However, my attack power did not increase just because of an additional wind attribute. It was just an increase in speed.”

“Even so, I should be able to insta-kill a level two void God Emperor opponent!”
