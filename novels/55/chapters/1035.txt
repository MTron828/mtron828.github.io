Chapter 1036: 1037 compromise (4/10)

Translator: 5496903

“City Lord, we...”

In the city Lord’s Mansion, an old man stood in front with an embarrassed expression. He lowered his head and said hesitantly, “Do we continue?”

“Are you saying that in the future, everyone in Eastern Sea City will laugh at me, and even my colleagues in other cities will laugh at Me?”

Lei Feihu stared at the old man and said in a deep voice.

“It’s not the city lord, this lowly one doesn’t mean that!”

The Old Man’s face instantly turned pale as he hurriedly said.

“I really don’t believe that an assassin organization can overturn rivers and seas, and can turn Eastern Sea city upside down!”

Lei Feihu’s expression was ice-cold as he slowly stood up. “In a while, I’ll invite commander Gao of the Ocean Corps over to discuss this. At this time, the dragon assassin organization has already threatened...”

“City Lord, City Lord!”

At this moment, an anxious voice interrupted lei Feihu’s words, causing his expression to instantly sink.

He, who was already in a bad mood, looked over with a cold gaze.

In an instant, the middle-aged man who ran over collapsed to the ground, looking at Lei Feihu with a terrified expression.

“Speak!”

Lei Feihu coldly spat out a word.

“City Lord, it’s bad. All... all the city guards have arrived at the city Lord’s Mansion!”

The middle-aged man said with a face full of fear.

“What? Why did they come to the city Lord’s Mansion?”

Lei Feihu asked with a deadpan expression.

“They... they requested city lord to ensure their safety!”

The middle-aged man didn’t even dare to wipe the cold sweat off his forehead as he spoke in fear.

Lei Feihu’s expression changed as he slowly turned around.

He wanted to accompany the dragon assassin organization to the end, but the group of city guards didn’t dare.

They didn’t want to die.

“City Lord, according to the information we received, the Dragon Assassin organization has reaccepted the mission.”

The leader of the city guards stood out with a somewhat embarrassed expression and said, “If we don’t have the confidence to destroy the dragon assassin organization, once we continue to target their spies, there might be even more city guards dying tomorrow!”

“City Lord, please give the order. If you really want US city guards to act, I will give the order. No one will dare to disobey your order!”

“Let’s not bother about the Dragon Assassin’s matter for now!”

The room was silent for five minutes before Lei Feihu’s voice finally sounded.

Let the city guards continue to send themselves to death?

If he had the confidence to annihilate the dragon assassin in the next few days, then he would be willing to sacrifice hundreds of city guards.

The city guards have nothing to say.

But if a few days, even a dozen days can not eliminate the dragon spur.

During this time, hundreds or even thousands of city guards will die, then who would like to be a city guard? Who else would submit to his lord?

He can’t do that.

“Dragon’s Thorn... Dragon’s Thorn... Just You Wait!”

Lei Feihu clenched his fist, his eyes flashing with crazy killing intent.

...

...

“Dragon King, the mission is normal, we received the Mission Commission smoothly, not by the City Guards Attack!”

In the evening, Long Yi came over and said excitedly to Wang Xian.

“It’s all because of the Ao Yao!”

A smile appeared on Wang Xian’s face.

He knew that the lord of Eastsea City could not afford to play, nor could he afford to waste time.

As the saying goes, a bare foot is not afraid of wearing shoes. This was his territory, and he was much more fearful of it.

He couldn’t possibly watch his subordinates die all the way.

The castellan made a wise choice.

However, he also knew that this time, the dragon spike had completely offended the star-moon kingdom and the Thunder Castellan, a powerhouse at the insightful void tier.

However, the development of the dragon Spike had to take this step.

If they wanted to become an assassin organization that could intimidate the supernatural continent and make all the kingdoms and empires fear them, today was just the beginning!

The opponents they would have to face in the future would be even stronger.

“Tonight, carry out the assassination mission as usual!”

Wang Xian said to Ao Yao.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Ao Yao replied immediately.

“It’s time to reap the rewards. There should be more than a billion middle-grade spirit stones in your account, right?”

Wang Xian smiled happily and continued to refine pills and weapons.

Wang Xian really liked the feeling of being a thousand miles away.

Next, it was time to get on the right track and prepare for the auction house.

...

The dragon Spike accepted the mission once again, causing many people to become restless. That afternoon, more than 30 people hired the dragon spike.

However, many people were still discussing whether the city Lord’s estate would continue to encircle and annihilate the dragon spike.

Although it was obvious that the dragon spike assassin organization had the upper hand today, City Lord Lei was, after all, an expert at the insightful void realm.

Behind City Lord Lei was the entire star-moon kingdom.

Under everyone’s curiosity and bewilderment, a day quickly passed.

“Ah!”

However, in the early morning of the next day, when an exclamation broke the tranquility of Eastern Sea City, a piece of news was quickly transmitted to eastern sea city.

The mission that Dragon Spike had accepted yesterday had been completed overnight.

This immediately caused the atmosphere of the entire eastern sea city to change.

“Damn, the city Lord’s mansion must have compromised? Dragon Spike didn’t encounter any obstacles in accepting the mission!”

“Just as the dragon Spike said, the darkness has already arrived. Whoever tries to stop it will be enveloped by it. The city Lord’s Mansion did not stop it, and the darkness is about to envelop the entire Eastern Sea City!”

“Next, the Eastern Sea city will fall into the era of the dragon spike. In the era of the darkness, unless there are no missions, people will be assassinated by the dragon Spike Every Day!”

“Too powerful, to think that even an insightful emptiness realm expert would have to compromise. Next, the darkness will belong to the dragon Spike!”

The Eastern Sea city forum was filled with information about the arrival of the era of the dragon spike.

More people either started hiring the dragon spike or reconciled with their enemies.

In an instant, all the restaurants in the eastern sea city were taken over by the major clans and mercenary groups.

As long as it wasn’t a life-and-death feud, no one would pay a huge price to hire the dragon spike. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Therefore, those who could reconcile would do so. If they really couldn’t, they would take a walk on the stage.

The last option was to hire the dragon spike. Let’s see who would act quickly!

Wang Xian didn’t pay attention to what happened next. He left everything to the DRAKONIDS and Ao Yao.

He stayed at his residence and began to forge weapons and pills to prepare for the auction in a few days.

At this moment, in the direction of the West City Gate, manager Yi of the Immortal Phoenix Pill and weapons workshop, the shopkeepers of the five shops, the four middle-aged men, and the four youths all came to the position at the city gate.

The three women and the middle-aged man stood at the very front, their faces slightly nervous as they looked into the distance.

Not long after, a caravan rushed over. At the back of the caravan was an old woman, a veiled woman, two middle-aged men, and a strange-looking little girl.

When the three women and the middle-aged man saw them, they immediately rushed over to welcome them.

They bowed slightly, showing great respect.

To be able to make four extraordinary level 9 experts so respectful, one could imagine the identity of the newcomers!
