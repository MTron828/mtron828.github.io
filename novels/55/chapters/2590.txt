2591 The Battle of 2591 began, and the stars were destroyed

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

In the resplendent starry sky, the stars emitted terrifying explosions!

A spatial sword pierced through the stars, directly turning them into dust from history!

There were dozens of planets in the Tiger Riot Demon Kingdom, and not a single planet was spared!

Even their main planet, the main planet with countless buildings on it, was completely destroyed!

There were even some heavenly demons hidden on some of the planets, and they were all destroyed just like the stars!

Terrifying explosions reverberated in the void, spreading far and wide!

“This is? What are the ninth-grade heavenly sect’s Heavenly Mountain Sword sect doing?” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Someone in the starry sky noticed the huge commotion and flew over!

When they saw the stars being destroyed one by one, their faces were filled with shock!

The stars exploded in an instant!

“They are destroying the planets of the Tiger Chaos Demon Nation!”

An expert muttered, his eyes filled with shock!

Destroying the stars directly, this was an attempt to completely destroy the other party. A planet was equivalent to a home, a home that had been destroyed to the point of irreconcilable destruction!

This news was spreading through the AI at a terrifying speed!

“Reporting to the king, Old National Advisor, our planet has been completely destroyed, completely destroyed!”

In the Dragon King Palace of the Dragon Palace, an expert reported to the chaotic Tiger King and the others!

They had already received the news that their planet had been destroyed!

“On our planet, many Old Sky Demons who were unwilling to leave have all been killed!”

The heavenly demon expert roared with a face full of grief and indignation!

“Ka Ka Ka!”!

“They have simply gone too far. They have destroyed our planet. Do they really think that our tiger demon empire would not dare to fight them to the death?”

The old National Advisor immediately stood up and roared with a face full of rage. He was filled with a violent aura!

His chest heaved up and down. This was their home. It had been destroyed just like that!

Countless Sky Demons who hadn’t left the planet were also killed!

“Old National Advisor, don’t worry. We’ll take revenge!”

Prime Minister Gui and the others were standing on the side, their eyes flashing with crazy killing intent!

“Summon all thorned dragon species!”

He shouted and all the strange demons rushed over!

Now that the number of members of the Dragon Palace had increased to nearly 400,000, the number of strange demons had also increased to 40,000. These 40,000 strange demons had already evolved into thorned dragon species!

All of the strange demons had at least the strength to assassinate an eternal God Lord Level 5!

“Strange Demon clan greets Prime Minister Gui!”

Very quickly, all of the strange demons arrived. In front of them were over 100 undying god King Level Strange Demon Warriors!

“All of the strange demons, enter the domain planets of the ninth grade Sky sect and Sky Mountain Sword sect!”

“A strange demon with the strength of a god King, bring a group of members and listen to my orders!”

Prime Minister Gui also ordered with killing intent!

Once the other party continued to destroy the stars without caring about the lives on the planet, there was no need for the Dragon Palace to be restrained!

As long as it was a planet belonging to the Sky Mountain Sword sect and the ninth-grade heaven sect, they could assassinate it directly and kill it without caring about anything else!

As long as it was a member of their planet, they were enemies, mortal enemies!

This was how battles were!

“It’s Prime Minister Gui!”

The group of Strange Beasts immediately replied, their black and white bodies emitting a cold aura!

“Immediately head over and wait for the order. Also, the moment you encounter danger, immediately flee back to the Undying Country!”

Prime Minister Gui ordered coldly!

“Let’s Go!”

The group of Strange Beasts received the order and immediately flew out!

As long as they hid and entered the planet where the Sky Mountain Sword sect and grade 9 Sky sect were located, it would be a piece of cake!

As time slowly passed, the news of the Sky Mountain Sword sect and the ninth-grade heaven sect sending experts to destroy the planet of the chaotic tiger demon country quickly spread!

Seeing this situation, all the factions were in an uproar. Their hearts were filled with fear!

Directly destroying the planet meant that they wanted to destroy everyone on the other party’s Planet!

“The Dragon Palace used to be in a remote place. If we were to fly through the star sword, it would take about ten hours. We would need to pass through the Lorman Desolate Beast Garden!”

At this moment, in the void of the universe, after the Sky Mountain Sword sect and the others destroyed dozens of planets in the chaotic Tiger Demon Kingdom, they immediately turned their attention to the Dragon Palace’s territory!

The demon slaying sect master looked at the map on the AI and roared with killing intent in his eyes!

...

“Huh? You need ten hours?”

The experts of the ninth-grade sky sect of the Sky Mountain Sword sect raised their eyebrows slightly and said, “If we rush there, the chaotic Tiger Demon Kingdom is just a side effect. The real price to pay is the Dragon Palace!”

Without any hesitation, they flew directly to the edge of the southern star system!

They were very fast. While they were rushing, the forty thousand strange demons entered the planets under the banner of the Ninth-grade Sky sect and the Sky Mountain Sword sect through all kinds of means!

The two major forces, as the two largest forces in the southern star system with the most profound foundations, controlled several hundred life planets, and even some weak planets were not included!

The two major forces added up to more than a thousand, and forty thousand strange demons swarmed in. Speaking of which, there were less than a hundred planets!

This was completely negligible for the passenger flow of a planet!

After the strange demon entered, it immediately began to investigate the entire planet’s situation!

Especially for the Undying God king level strange demon, if a planet didn’t pose a threat to their undying god King, they could still destroy a planet within a few minutes!

“We’re here, ahead is the Dragon Palace’s territory, according to our news, the Dragon Palace has taken over this remote place’s entire ocean, their base is within the ocean!”

10 hours later, a huge blade pierced through the Luo er man desolate beast garden, the three seas sect leader’s bloodthirsty gaze stared at a star ahead!

...

“This remote area should all have something to do with the Dragon Palace, kill them all!”

He continued brutally!

“Kill them all, this... isn’t it harming the innocent!”

Beside them, a few undying emperors frowned!

“The Dragon Palace has taken over many planets in this region, it’s impossible to destroy them all, however we can destroy one or two planets and make the Dragon Palace feel fear and rage, the few planets before us, destroy them all!”

The Sky Mountain Sword sect leader’s old man said cruelly!

“Attack!”

His body moved and he immediately jumped down from piercing star sword!

The others also jumped down immediately!

“Clang, Clang, Clang!”

A world-destroying sound was heard. On the planet in front of them, the former members of the iron-blood Alliance didn’t even have time to react before the star-piercing sword pierced through the stars!

Then, the Apocalypse arrived!

“Buzz, Buzz, Buzz!”

At this moment, in the main Dragon Palace, Prime Minister Gui immediately received the news when an undersea dragon palace where the iron-blood alliance used to be was destroyed!

The destruction of the Dragon Palace caused only one image to be transmitted over. In the image, the entire planet exploded!

“All Strange Demons, Attack! Kill!”

When Prime Minister Gui saw the news, his heart turned cold, and he roared coldly!
