Chapter 493: In The Name Of The Fire Goddess (3)

The truncheon that symbolized the power of a God was giving off a radiant flame, with a maroon Flame Bead embedded on it.

With a crown on her head, Adjaya raised the truncheon in her hands and fired her attack.

“A Fire Demon is trying to stop us?!”

The charred body of the old man from Nether Flame seemed to crack while flaming liquid oozed out from it.

“Burst off!”

The old man stretched out his arm, firing a two-meter-thick fire column at that Fire Demon.

Roar!

That ten-meter Fire Demon craned its neck up and stared fearlessly at that dreadful column of fire.

The length of the fire column spanned over a few hundred meters long.

The daunting momentum could either collapse a mountain or overturn the sea.

“Scram!”

The gigantic purplish Flaming Sledge Hammer in the hands of Fire Demon smashed at the fire column.

Boom!

The fire column was forced back at a more rapid speed, charging towards the charcoal-black old man.

The charcoal-black old man had a slight change in his expression. He opened his chest, which had completely turned fiery-red, just like an endless flaming cave.

The fire column charged at his chest.

“Attack!”

The Deity Lady of Nether Flame revealed a grave expression as the black skull that she was hugging waa suspended above her head. Black flames exploded from her eyes.

At the same time, the sockets of the black skull were surging with black flames.

Four beams of flames that looked like Aurora fell onto the Fire Demon.

Sst!

A sizzling sound was heard as the figure staggered a hundred meters back in the air, with four black marks left on its body.

However, the mark did not cause any damage to it, not even breaking down the body armor.

“What strong armor. No doubt, it’s the equipment made by the Fire God!”

Deity Lady of Nether Flame exhibited an awful expression while the skull above her opened its mouth with a clicking sound.

“Fire Rain, seethe!”

Another old man came, with his body painted in black runes that were radiating with flames.

Instantly, masses of daunting fire clouds condensed in the sky.

The size of the Fire Cloud was a hundred meters, located amid the empty air.

Whoosh!

Drops of flaming rain descended from the sky.

Growl!

Weak Fire Demons let out painful shrieks below as deep hollows sunk in on their bodies when the Fire Rain landed on them.

The Fire Clouds changed as endless, dense raindrops kept falling onto the Fire Demons.

The earth-shattering scene depicted a forbidden spell cast.

“Fire God, Mu Hua!”

Seeing that the endless Fire Rain kept attacking the Fire Demons, Adjaya stretched her arm out, igniting a fiery glow from the bodies of Fire Demons.

The Fire Rain fell onto it just like raindrops falling on an umbrella.

“The slave of Fire God indeed. You have inherited the Fire God’s legacy to possess a Budding Realm’s strength at such a young age!”

The husky voice from Deity Lady of Nether Flame was heard again. She turned to the two old men beside her and said coldly, “If both of you aren’t making your moves, get lost now. If you want to take advantage of the situation, I’ll kill everyone here!”

“Haha, the Fire Demon is compelling. To restrain it, we need at least two to three people. You guys will keep the Fire Demon busy, while we will slaughter that girl!”

The two old men from Fire God Denomination and Heavenly Flame Denomination burst out laughing as they looked at Adjaya. “We can only slay you since you put up a fight now!”

The two of them struck with one holding a hammer, and one holding a sword and shield with flames swirling on it.

The old man with the sword and shield was bursting with Zero-degree Sapphire Heavenly Flames that made his assault a creepy and daunting one.

Roar!

Seeing that Adjaya was under attack, the Fire Demon quickly lunged at them.

“You still want to protect your owner?”

Deity Lady of Nether Flame swung her arm, jerking her body and the skull above her head.

The ten-meter skull that was formed by black flames opened its huge mouth as it bit at the Fire Demon.

“Descend from the Fire Cloud!”

Another old man revealed a cold smile as the hundred-meter Fire Cloud from the sky began descending, crashing down at the Fire Demon.

“Crack!”

The chest of the charcoal-black old man cracked, with two scary fire hands stretching out at the Fire Demon.

Bam!

For a moment, the Fire Demon was twisting with the gigantic flaming skull, hand, and Fire Cloud.

“Roar. Scram!”

The Fire Demon bawled with a furious look on his face as he wielded the Flaming Sledge Hammer in his hand.

A hundred-meter flame swept across the sky with each swing.

“Kill! Little girl, do you think you can fight against us with just a Fire Demon alone?”

The Budding Realm expert with a sword and shield was exuding a sapphire flame. Pointing the long sword at Adjaya, he was closing in on her within a ten-meter range.

Shoo!

Just then, a five-meter-long Flaming Spear popped into the air as it struck Adjaya. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Kill!”

Upon seeing the incoming attacks from both sides, Adjaya had a dreadful look.

She let out a cry while thousands of Fire Demons, and over a score of Dan Realm Fire Demons, charged at the disciples of the three denominations.

Her truncheon spun and was raised above her head.

The flaming truncheon exploded into a daunting fire column, which dashed for the Flaming Spear.

“You’re still too weak!”

Just then, the old man with the sword and shield displayed coldness on his face as a sapphire glow flickered, piercing Adjaya with his flaming longsword.

Adjaya had a drastic change in her expression. Her truncheon continued to spin in her hands.

Dense vivid flaming truncheons were rotating around her.

Boom!

The Zero-degree Sapphire Heavenly Flame on the longsword seemed to pierce through the air and slashed at the defense on Adjaya.

The compelling force hurled her off the ground by a few hundred meters immediately.

“How dare a lass who has just inherited the legacy dare to vie with us. Go to hell!”

Another old man combined with the long spear, exploding a glow of the fire that lurched at Adjaya.

Bam!

Adjaya was appalled. She placed her truncheon across her body while the compelling force forced blood to be spat out from her mouth.

She had just inherited the Fire God’s legacy two days ago, after which her combat techniques and skills could not be compared with these old and experienced freaks.

“Ignorant lass, exterminate!”

The old man with the sword and shield held them and lowered both of his arms!

“Sword raises and down the shield!”

Behind Adjaya, countless sapphire swords condensed by Zero-degree Sapphire Heavenly Flame emerged and shrouded the thousand-meter space.

Numerous shields fell from the sky, dashing for Adjaya.

Adjaya paled with despair surging from her heart.

“Oh no, Adjaya is in danger!”

“We’re gone. It’s not easy for our family to have a Budding Realm expert. Adjaya was just too stubborn. Just give them the treasures since they can’t take the Fire Demons away!”

At the same time, everyone from the royal family stood at a rooftop on a building across from the Fire Spirit Island. Upon seeing the developments of the event, they paled and clenched their fists tightly.

“It was a surprise for her to inherit the legacy of all legacies and become the Fire Goddess!”

“What Fire Goddess? She’s been chased away by three major denominations now!”

Everyone at the beach watched the battle erupt on Fire Spirit Island with horror.

When the Fire Goddess emerged suddenly, they were flabbergasted.

However, the Fire Goddess was going to perish!

The daunting fire was breaking out around a radius of more than ten kilometers of Fire Spirit Island.

Every blow could destroy Heaven and Earth.

Thousands of Fire Demons jumped to the sky and wrestled with the three major denominations. They killed the disciples of the denominations mercilessly.

Yet, their Fire Goddess was stuck in a devastating plight of the Budding Realm battle.

“The battle is coming to an end. After the Fire Goddess is killed, the Fire God’s Graveyard will belong to the three denominations!”

The Martial Artists watched and shouted loudly from the faraway beach.

Roar!

However, at this time, a long roar echoed through the sky!
