Chapter 752: 0753. The power of a deity can not be offended (5/5)

Translator: 549690339

“If that’s the case, this young master, these seven drops of hundred flower liquid belong to you!”

Flower Fairy took a deep breath and waved her arm. She took the seven drops of hundred flower liquid in her hand and walked towards Wang Xian.

This time, she didn’t throw it over directly. Instead, she walked over directly.

Taking out such a precious item was equivalent to giving it to her indirectly. She had to thank her somehow!

“This...”

The surrounding people were slightly stunned when they saw flower fairy walking over. However, they soon felt relieved.

It was normal for flower fairy to deliver such a precious item to her personally.

Bingchuan Yun held his arm tightly and stared at Wang Xian with fury in his eyes.

“Thank you, Young Master!”

Flower fairy passed the hundred flowers liquid to Wang Xian and thanked him.

“No Need!”

Wang Xian smiled as he looked at the hundred flowers liquid in her hand. He passed the staff to her.

“Do you have any more hundred flowers liquid? Or an item that has similar effects to the Hundred Flowers Liquid?”

Wang Xian took it and asked the flower fairy.

The flower fairy looked at Wang Xian and nodded slowly. “To be honest, young master, we still have some hundred flowers liquid. I have a huge advantage in exchanging seven drops of hundred flowers liquid for this staff. I’ll give the rest of the hundred flowers liquid to you!”

“Okay, thank you!”

Wang Xian nodded his head at her.

“Oh my God, Ice Soul Stone. It’s an ice soul stone. What a huge ice soul stone! Oh My God!”

At this moment, a shocked voice came from the side.

A young man dressed in white came to Wang Xian’s side quickly. His gaze was fixed on the crystal box that Wang Xian placed on the Stone Table!

His eyes were filled with disbelief and madness.

“Ice Soul Stone?”

Everyone was stunned, especially the disciples of the Ice God Celestial sect. They immediately looked towards the direction where the young man was looking at.

“It’s really an ice soul stone... cough cough, ice soul stone, what a big piece!”

“It’s the holy weapon for ice attribute cultivators. It’s the best material to create an ice attribute spiritual weapon. Oh My God, Oh my God!”

In an instant, the disciples of the ice god Celestial sect gasped when they saw the huge piece of ice soul stone in front of Wang Xian.

Ice Soul Stone was a grade-13 metal.

This kind of metal emitted cold air. If they were to sit cross-legged and cultivate on it, it would be the best holy weapon for the disciples of the ice god Celestial sect who cultivated the ice attribute.

In fact, the ice soul stone could also be used to create immortal god weapons.

To ice element cultivators, this was simply a supreme treasure.

And this ice soul stone in front of them could create many spirit weapons and could also allow several disciples to cultivate!

It was no wonder that the ice god Immortal sect disciples were so crazy.

“Ice Soul Stone!”

Bingchuan Yun’s breathing was somewhat hurried as he stared at it with excited eyes.

He didn’t expect this young man to have such a big ice soul stone!

If he had some ice soul stones, he could even break through to the level of a half-step immortal god.

Wang Xian frowned slightly when he saw the ice god Celestial sect’s disciples staring at the crystal box with Shu Qing’s body.

“Phew, phew, Ice Soul Stone. Brother, can you sell some of it?”

The young man who was the first to rush over stared at Wang Xian passionately. He couldn’t help but approach Wang Xian and extend his arm.

“I’m not selling it. Take your hand back!”

Wang Xian looked at the young man coldly.

However, the young man didn’t seem to hear him. He continued to touch the ice soul stone!

Boom

Just as his arm was about to touch the stone, Wang Xian waved his arm. A terrifying energy landed directly on the young man’s body.

“Bang!”

The young man didn’t have the slightest ability to resist. His body flew into the distance.

“PFFT!”

“Ah!”

At this moment, the young man finally woke up. He couldn’t help but spit out a mouthful of fresh blood. His face was in extreme pain as he let out a terrified scream.

Wang Xian didn’t use much strength in this attack, but it was enough to turn the young man into a cripple.

“What? How dare you make a move!”

The surrounding disciples of the ice god Celestial sect came back to their senses. When they saw their fellow disciples who were seriously injured, their expressions changed drastically. A middle-aged man immediately walked to the side of the young man and shouted at Wang Xian with an embarrassed expression.

“You don’t know what’s good for you!”

Wang Xian swept a cold glance at the young man.

The expressions of the disciples of the ice god Celestial sect were slightly embarrassed. Just now, Wang Xian had warned their fellow disciples that the young man didn’t hear that he was severely injured. It was the young man’s fault first.

However...

“Brother, my junior brother only touched the ice soul stone with his hand. Isn’t it too much for you to hit him so hard?”

Bingchuan Yun’s eyes sparkled when he saw that the disciple of the celestial sect was seriously injured. He stared at Wang Xian coldly.

“He is already lucky that he didn’t kill him!”

Wang Xian glanced at them coldly.

“You are really arrogant. Don’t be so arrogant just because you have some spiritual artifacts. Kid, I’m warning you. This is the area of our soup cauldron!”

Bingchuan Yun stared at Wang Xian coldly.

“That’s right. Our junior brother only touched you once, but he already hit you so hard. This is too much. You must give us an explanation today!” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

A middle-aged man from the ice god Celestial sect stood beside Bingchuan Yun and said with a twinkle in his eyes.

“It was the disciples of the Ice God Celestial sect who crossed the Boundary First!”

Fairy Centaurea was stunned when she saw this scene. She took a glance at Wang Xian beside her and immediately said to Bingchuan Yun.

“Junior sister centaurea, the disciples of the ice god Celestial sect only wanted to touch him. It’s not like they wanted to take him away. He attacked with such force. This is too much!”

“Furthermore, who gave him the right to attack in our hundred flowers celestial sect? He doesn’t put our natural born celestial sect in his eyes!”

As soon as she finished her sentence, the female disciple of the innate immortal sect beside Bingchuan Yun pointed at Wang Xian and spoke on Bingchuan Yun’s behalf.

Seeing her senior sister’s criticism, the flower fairy’s expression turned slightly awkward.

Wang Xian’s attack was too harsh. It was indeed difficult for her to protect him, especially since he was a member of the Ice God Immortal sect!

She furrowed her brows tightly and said, “Let me treat this junior brother’s injuries with medication!”

“This is not a matter of treatment. Kid, let me tell you. Give me some ice soul stones to compensate for my junior brother’s injuries. Otherwise...”. “I don’t care who you are or which immortal sect you are from, you will have to pay a heavy price in the area of our Tang Ding!”

Bingchuan Yun took a glance at the ice soul stone and stared at Wang Xian coldly.

“Hehe!”

Wang Xian looked at them with a hint of coldness in his eyes. He opened the ice soul stone gently.

He opened the bottle of hundred flowers liquid directly and let out the fragrance. Then, he placed it around Shu Qing.

“Shu Qing, some people are disturbing you. Let me deal with them!”

Wang Xian mumbled and covered it again. Then, he slowly carried it on his back.

“This...”

However, everyone who was standing around looked at the opened ice soul stone in shock.

Inside... There was actually a beauty!

Although it was just a glance, her face was definitely not inferior to flower fairy’s!

The level thirteen spirit tool, Ice Soul Stone, the ice soul stone that caused the disciples of the ice god Immortal sect to go crazy, actually contained a beautiful girl.

And he spent such a terrifying price to trade ten drops of hundred flower liquid with flower fairy not to pursue flower fairy, but for that girl.

Moreover, that hundred flower liquid was actually used to directly put in the Ice Soul Stone!

Such behavior was simply shocking!
