Chapter 1413: 1413 was secretly visiting in disguise

“Your Majesty, there are some unfair things in every place. You are ambitious, but your policy time is still too short. It needs some time to ferment!”

The old woman standing behind Feng Luan whispered when she saw the Queen’s slightly unhappy look.

“I know that some things can happen, but they must be changed in the future!”

Feng Luan nodded her head. She took a glance at the carriage and continued walking forward.

“The snow and wind dynasty, which used to be cold and freezing, belongs to a dynasty where the people are more valiant and simple. There are many martial artists with water and mutated ice attributes born here!”

Feng Luan introduced to Wang Xian and the rest.

Some of the people in the surroundings were wearing thicker clothing compared to other cities. The temperature here was at least several tens of degrees below zero.

For many of the younger children, the weather was still very cold.

The few of them came to the most luxurious restaurant in wind and Frost City, looked at the beautiful scenery around them, and ate some food.

“I heard that the wind and Frost Lake in wind and frost city is very beautiful. Let’s go and take a look later!”

Guan Shuqing looked at some information about wind and frost city on the communication stone plate and said with a smile.

“Sure, we’ll stay in wind frost city for a few days anyway!”

Feng Luan said with a smile on her face.

“Then let’s hurry up and eat. I heard that you can skate on it, Hehe!”

The group of girls became interested.

After eating, they walked toward the central wind frost lake again.

When they came to the wind frost lake, they found over a thousand young men practicing martial techniques on the lake.

Not far away from them, there was an academy, the wind and Frost Academy. Within the academy, many students were practicing their martial techniques within the wind and Frost Lake.

It was a scene of prosperity!

“There are so many people, there should be at least a hundred thousand people!” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Shu Qing and the others walked towards the frozen lake with interest, grabbing the surrounding snow.

Within the lake, there were many children. The laughter of children filled the sky above the wind and Frost Lake.

“Hua Hua Hua!”

At this moment, the sound of a carriage came from behind.

More than ten huge carriages stopped in front of the wind and Frost Lake.

“It’s time to collect the clear spirit grass. All parents, bring your children over!”

At this moment, more than twenty middle-aged and old men stepped out of the carriage, and their voices echoed in the surroundings.

“It’s time to collect the clear spirit grass. Hurry, Hurry!”

“Quick, quick, son, come here. Mommy will bring you to collect the clear spirit grass!”

“Thank you so much, your Majesty!”

One by one, the middle-aged men hurriedly brought the children around them and walked towards the carriage.

Feng Luan looked over and a trace of a smile appeared on her face.

“Mommy, I want it too!”

“Child, we are not qualified to collect it. When your father breaks through to the transcendent realm, we will be able to collect it!”

“Oh!”

“Child, you have to cultivate well in the future and become a powerhouse. We can buy these things ourselves!”

At this moment, the sounds of mother and son conversing could be heard from the side.

Wang Xian and Feng Luan looked over. Two mother and son dressed in simple clothes stood at the side and looked in the direction of the carriage.

Feng Luan frowned and looked at the surroundings.

She noticed that a few children were looking at the carriage with eager faces.

“Sister Feng Luan, if I remember correctly, the clear spirit grass is produced in Qingling Mountain. Although it’s only an extraordinary first grade spiritual grass, it’s very effective for children!”

“The dynasty invests at least a trillion middle-grade spiritual stones every year and gives the clear spirit grass to all children for free. Now... What?”

Sun Lingxiu’s gaze swept the surroundings, and she frowned as she looked at Feng Luan.

“Some people are courting death. How dare they covet Something Like This!”

Feng Luan slowly shook her head, and walked towards a boy who was dressed in shabby clothes.

“Little friend, where’s your father?”

Feng Luan walked over, wearing a veil, and asked the little boy with a smile on her face.

“Mom and Dad are working!”

“They are working. Let’s go, Auntie will take you to get the clear spirit grass!”

Feng Luan said to her with a smile.

“I can’t get it. Dad said to buy it for me to make my body better!”

The Little Boy shook his head and said to Feng Luan.

This made her slightly stunned, and her face slowly darkened. “Buy?”

“Let’s go, Auntie will take you there!”

Feng Luan held the little boy’s hand and walked towards the carriage.

The Little Boy wanted to break free, but after Feng Luan turned her head and smiled at him, he immediately followed behind.

Sun Lingxiu followed behind. Wang Xian shook his head and ignored her.

Feng Luan was disguised as a private visitor. She wanted to find out the problem and solve it.

He wasn’t surprised to encounter such a matter.

“Hello, we are here to collect the clear spirit grass!”

Feng Luan walked over with the little boy and said directly.

“What’s Your Name?”

The middle-aged man in front of the carriage asked without raising his head.

“Ming Ziyang!”

Feng Luan looked at the little boy and the little boy said directly.

“Ming Ziyang? HMM? There is no such name!”

The middle-aged man raised his head as he spoke and looked at the little boy. He frowned and said impatiently, “Don’t you know your name? You are not on the list to receive it!”

“Why can’t I receive them?”

Feng Luan asked directly with a cold face.

“If I say I can’t, then I can’t. I didn’t expect you to dress up pretty well. Your child is so sloppy. Hehe, woman, with the money to dress up like this, I can buy clean spirit grass for your child!”

The middle-aged man looked Feng Luan up and down and said with a smile.

“According to the law of the dragon and Phoenix dynasty, every six to twelve-year-old child can receive a clean spirit grass every month. Why Can’t we receive it?”

Feng Luan stared at the middle-aged man and coldly said.

“If you can’t accept it, then you can’t accept it. Get lost quickly, or don’t blame me for being impolite!”

The middle-aged man heard Feng Luan’s words and sternly berated her.

“Do you know what will happen if you violate the law of the Dragon and Phoenix Dynasty?”

Feng Luan coldly asked them.

“Are you courting death, woman? Decree? We Are the decree. We risked our lives to bring the pure spirit grass here from tens of thousands of kilometers away. It’s easy for us. I’m warning you, get out of here quickly. Otherwise, you’ll spend a few days in the prison!”

“Someone with such delicate skin like you is absolutely welcome!”

“Haha!”

The middle-aged man said arrogantly to Feng Luan, which made the surrounding middle-aged men and elders burst into laughter.

“We are acting according to the orders of the higher-ups? What? You Want to sue us? Go ahead!”

A burly elder walked over directly and said to Feng Luan with a cold expression.

“Aunt, the decree says so, but not everyone can receive it. There are also conditions. If I can’t receive it, I don’t want it anymore!”

The Little Boy saw the fierce middle-aged man and spoke with a face full of fear.

At the side, some families who came to collect the clear spirit grass frowned at this scene. No one dared to say anything.

“Sue You? Then I want to see who gave you the Order!”

Feng Luan sneered when she heard their arrogant words and looked at Manhong.

“City Lord of Wind Frost City, get your ass over here!”
