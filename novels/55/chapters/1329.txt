Chapter 1330: 1331 divine dragon descends into the world

“I am Bing Hanzi, the founder of the Frost sect. I was trapped in the Light Dragon Source Pond and was saved by the young master. I must kill the person the young master wants to kill!”

A cold and mechanical voice came from the center of the explosion.

This voice was not very loud, but everyone felt that this voice seemed to be right beside their ears.

It was clear, cold, and emotionless.

The smoke from the explosion slowly dissipated, and a clear figure appeared in front of everyone.

It was a skinny old man who looked like he was going to die at any moment.

There was no sign of life on the old man’s body. Coldness and deathly stillness filled his entire body.

Hearing the old man’s words, everyone was stunned.

The founder of the Frost sect?

The Frost sect was a sect faction of the Light Dragon Dynasty. In the past, the strength of the Frost sect was on par with the Light Dragon King.

The reason for this was the existence of the founder of the Frost Sect, Bing Hanzi.

Bing Hanzi of the Frost sect was now a figure from more than four thousand years ago!

Although the lifespan of an insightful emptiness realm expert was five thousand years, the number of people who could live to five thousand years old was extremely small.

The injuries and hidden dangers of the past 1,000 years, the deaths of those who stepped into dangerous situations in order to seek a breakthrough.

The sudden historical changes and so on.

This caused the number of experts who could live up to 4,000 to 5,000 years to be very, very few.

It was not an exaggeration to call each and every one of those who could live up to 4,000 to 5,000 years old old monsters.

At present, the Frost sect had already experienced seven or eight generations of sect masters. Now that the founder of the Frost sect, Bing Hanzi, had suddenly appeared, it had shocked everyone!

This was especially so for the families and forces of the Light Dragon Dynasty. They were well aware of the deeds of the legendary figure in the Light Dragon dynasty, Bing Han Zi!

“Bing Han Zi!”

The king of the Light Dragon dynasty also stared at him in astonishment.

Even though he was the king of the Light Dragon Dynasty, he was still full of respect and fear for such a legendary figure.

He opened his mouth, wanting to make his son stop fighting. However, when he saw such a legendary figure, he hesitated for a moment before sitting down with a solemn expression!

“If you want to blame someone, blame yourself for offending Xiaoyun too much. I didn’t expect that Xiaoyun would make such a strong person respected!”

“What a pity, the supreme chosen, the Nameless Sword Demon!”

He sighed in his heart.

The Most Outstanding Heaven’s pride expert in the flowing sea region was helpless against an old monster who had lived for more than 4,000 years.

After all, to be able to live for such a long time, his strength and battle experience were terrifying!

Even if they were at the same level, it would still be difficult for them to defeat him!

“This... What’s the point of beating an egg? An old monster who has lived for more than 4,000 years and a 26-year-old?”

“It’s over, it’s over. From the looks of it, the eighth Prince will definitely not let Wang Xian off. This time, the Peerless Heaven’s favorite of the generation may be about to fall!”

“The gap of more than 4,000 years between a fifth-level insightful void martial artist of the older generation and a Peerless Heaven’s favorite of the new generation!”

When everyone around heard the words ‘Bing Hanzi’, they were extremely shocked.

Such a legend of the older generation would be considered a top-notch existence in the Liuhai region.

“Brother Wang Xian, leave quickly!”

Long Xiaotian looked at Bing Hanzi who descended like a God and Demon. His face was filled with despair as he shouted at Wang Xian with a worried expression.

“Escape? You want to escape? is that possible?”

Long Xiaoyun looked at long Xiaotian with his cold eyes. He stood there arrogantly and looked at everything coldly.

She was shocked by Bing Hanzi.

He was his subordinate!

He was filled with enjoyment!

“Young master, don’t worry. With his strength, he won’t be able to escape!” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Bing Hanzi looked at Wang Xian coldly and said calmly.

He didn’t put Wang Xian in his eyes at all.

Based on the battle just now, it would be easy for him to kill him.

As he spoke, he waved his arm and an extremely cold air directly attacked the five elements millstone above Wang Xian.

Boom

The terrifying cold energy landed on the five elements millstone and produced a dull sound.

The entire five elements millstone flew into the distance.

“Hehe!”

Wang Xian looked at the pretentious Bing Hanzi and the Arrogant Long Xiaoyun who wanted to kill him.

With a wave of his arm, the five elements millstone that flew out began to shrink and slowly rotated above his head.

“Hiss, what a huge gap!”

“The sect master of the Frost sect couldn’t even shake the huge millstone with his dharma idol, yet he was easily sent flying by Bing Hanzi. This is not on the same level!”!

Seeing Bing Hanzi’s casual attack, everyone’s eyes focused and took a deep breath.

“The founder of the Frost sect. That’s perfect. Today, I will let you watch the destruction of your frost sect!”

“Ashes to Ashes, dust to Dust!”

Wang Xian was floating in the sky. There was not the slightest fluctuation on his face.

His lips moved slightly and his voice reverberated throughout the entire sky.

“What?”

Tens of thousands of people opened their mouths slightly when they saw Wang Xian still saying such words at this moment.

Why did he... ?

Long Xiaotian was stunned. He clenched his fists tightly and stared at Wang Xian.

“Haha, that’s good too. I would like to see how strong I am now. Let’s use you to test it out!”

“Haha!”

While everyone was stunned, Wang Xian’s voice rang out again.

This time, it was a maniacal laughter.

After the laughter ended, a terrifying aura began to gather on his body.

Within a radius of more than ten kilometers, an inexplicable imposing manner began to gather.

“Roar! Roar!”

At this moment, an inhuman roar sounded from his mouth.

The voice was loud and clear, filled with an inexplicable imposing manner.

Under everyone’s dumbfounded gaze, Wang Xian, who was still in his human form a moment ago, turned into a terrifying 50-meter-long divine dragon.

His huge body and terrifying aura.

Every piece of dragon scale was shining with a luster.

His horns were like a deer, his head was like a camel, his eyes were like a rabbit, his neck was like a snake, his stomach was like a clam, his scales were like a fish, his claws were like an eagle, his palms were like a tiger, and his ears were like an ox.

The Chinese Divine Dragon, the Dragon Race of the universe. His real appearance was in the flowing sea region.

Under the gaze of everyone, Wang Xian swayed his huge body. His pair of majestic dragon eyes stared coldly at Bing Hanzi and the sect leader of the Frost sect who was beside him.

“I’ve said it before. I want to destroy the Frost sect. First, I’ll kill the sect leader of the Frost sect!”

Wang Xian spoke in human language. Under everyone’s stunned gazes, the five elements millstone above his head recovered to a size of 2,000 meters at a terrifying speed.

Following that, Wang Xian swayed his divine dragon body and charged forward with the five elements millstone.

The Divine Dragon Swayed!

Divine might descended!

“Five Elements Millstone: obliterate!”

The dragon scales on Wang Xian’s body flickered with a five-colored glow. At this moment, he was a five-colored divine dragon.

A wave of obliterated energy covered an area of two kilometers in front of him.

“This...”

Bing Hanzi, who was standing in front of him, saw a wave of energy that was filled with violence as if it was going to destroy the world. His extremely cold and indifferent expression finally changed.

His pupils bulged, and his eyes were filled with disbelief.

“Ka Ka Ka!”

His body moved, and a dazzling blue light appeared around him. The blue light turned into a deep ice block that covered his entire body.

His entire body directly expanded by ten meters.

He completely couldn’t care about sect leader Han Zong beside him!

“No... how could it be this creature? Run... run...”

Sect Master Han Zong looked at the world-destroying energy in front of him as it streaked across the sky, and he cried out in terror.

“Weng!”

However, as the energy swept past, his body stiffened, and he slowly trembled.

The final life force, the terrifying creature that he had seen back then in the main hall appeared in his mind!
