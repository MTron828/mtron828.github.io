Chapter 1119: 1120 Feng Luan’s predicament

Translator: 5496903

“HMM?”

In the Hall of the city Lord’s mansion, Feng Luan sat in the center. Beside her was the dean of the Dragon and Phoenix Academy, Yu Chengzi, the leader of the Dragon and Phoenix City Guards, Yan Wenshan, and the commander of the Dragon and Phoenix Army, Mang Hong, jin Qianyuan sat on the left and right respectively.

Jin Qianyuan was also the mayor of holy sea town, and his strength was at rank 9. More importantly, the boldness that Jin Qianyuan displayed during the siege of the Demon Beasts had won the hearts of the people.

Now, Jin Qianyuan’s position was the city lord of dragon-phoenix city.

Although there were still Feng Luan and three insightful void realm experts above the city Lord, Jin Qianyuan also knew that if the Dragon-phoenix dynasty really became powerful in the future, he would be the city lord of the Imperial City.

He would also be the founding minister of the dragon-phoenix Dynasty.

Feng Luan, who was discussing the matter of dragon-phoenix city in the hall, relaxed when she heard the voice from outside. She smiled and walked out.

The four people in the hall looked at each other and knew who it was.

Only that young man could make their queen let go of all her worries.

“Shuqing, Lingxiu, yinxuan, a jiaya, Qinglan!”

Feng Luan walked out of the hall and saw Guan Shuqing and the others. She smiled and went up to them.

“Sister Feng Luan!”

Guan Shuqing saw her walk out and walked over with an intimate expression. She gave her a hug.

Among the group of girls, Guan Shuqing and Feng Luan had the best relationship and were also the most intimate. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Shuqing, I didn’t expect you guys to come so soon!”

Feng Luan grabbed her arm with a face full of affection and sized her up from top to bottom.

“Eh? Where’s Qingyue?”

Feng Luan chatted with them warmly one by one and suddenly found that Lan Qingyue was not here, so she asked curiously.

“Sister Qingyue took Xiao Lan to explore the world alone!”

Guan Shuqing explained to her.

“Is that so?”

Feng Luan nodded her head slowly. Among Wang Xian’s women, none of them were simple.

However, the most mysterious one was Lan Qingyue.

Even she could not see Lan Qingyue’s potential clearly. Her weak strength gave her a terrifying sense of threat.

“Sister Feng Luan, we brought you many delicious things and beautiful clothes!”

A few girls took out some gifts from Earth and said to her happily.

“Thank you, sisters. Let’s go to my room!”

Feng Luan nodded. She didn’t have the demeanor of a great empress, but was more like an ordinary woman.

“Oh right, Miss Zhang Fengying is in Jin Liuyan’s courtyard. You should go and see her!”

Feng Luan looked at Wang Xian and said suddenly.

“Okay!”

Wang Xian nodded. “You guys catch up first. I’ll go and take a look!”

“Zhang Fengying?”

Seeing Wang Xian leave in a hurry, Guan Shuqing and the other girls raised their eyebrows and looked at Feng Luan. “Sister Feng, who is Zhang Fengying?”

“A very beautiful woman with a very hot figure.”

Feng Luan said directly.

“What? She has a hot figure like sister a Jiaya?”

Guan Shuqing screamed immediately.

“Her figure is even hotter than sister a Jiaya’s!”

“What’s the relationship between Xiao Xian and her?”

“I don’t know. When I met Wang Xian, he already knew that beautiful woman. Moreover, their relationship was pretty good. This time, because of Wang Xian, their family was exterminated by the people of Donghai City!”

“This... this... I knew that he wouldn’t change. Pervert, this pervert!”

“Shu Qing, what you said is wrong. You even scolded us like SH * T... However, Xiao Xian is the same as a pervert...”

“We’ll talk about it when he comes back. Sister Feng Luan, let’s go. Tell us, what have you been doing for the past three years?”

Wang Xian walked out and heard the angry voices of the girls behind him. He shook his head bitterly.

When he arrived at Jin Liuyan’s courtyard, he knocked on the door.

“You’re here!”

“Wang Xian, you’re here. You’re here to see...”

Jin Liuyan’s voice was heard. When she opened the door and saw Wang Xian, her eyes lit up and she asked.

“HMM, is he inside?”

Wang Xian nodded his head.

“He’s sitting there.”

Jin Liuyan pointed at Zhang Fengying who was sitting in front of the pool in the courtyard and sighed slightly.

She sat there and looked at the small pool in front of her with empty eyes. Compared to when they parted, she looked much more haggard.

The aura of a strong woman had completely disappeared, revealing a sense of weakness.

“I’m sorry, I’ve implicated your Zhang Family!”

Wang Xian walked over and said slowly.

“No... It’s not your fault...”

All of a sudden, Zhang Fengying turned around when she saw Wang Xian. She sat on the bench and hugged Wang Xian’s body. She couldn’t help but cry.

Ever since she found out that her family was destroyed, she was in a trance.

Her family was destroyed and she lost all her family members. Now that she saw Wang Xian whom she knew, she couldn’t help but cry.

“I will avenge your family members. I promise, we will kill them all!”

Wang Xian’s hands landed gently on her back and patted her gently.

“Phew, I’m sorry. I need to calm down!”

Zhang Fengying, who had been sobbing for a few minutes, suddenly stood up and wiped the tears from her eyes. She took a deep breath and walked straight into the room.

“Fengying, I...”

Wang Xian stretched out his hand but didn’t know how to console her.

“If you have anything to say, you can tell me...”

“If there’s anything I can do, tell me...”

Wang Xian hesitated for more than ten minutes before walking to the door and speaking to her.

However, Zhang Fengying did not respond.

Wang Xian was helpless and stayed outside the door for more than two hours.

“I’m staying in the Mayor’s residence next door. If there’s anything you need, come and look for me. I’ll look for You Tomorrow!”

The sky gradually turned dark. After saying that, Wang Xian walked out.

Jin Liuyan watched from the side and didn’t say anything.

“What? Sister Feng Luan, we don’t have to be afraid. Come back to the Dragon Palace with us and cultivate for one to two years. We will definitely beat them up!”

When Wang Xian arrived at the mayor’s residence, he heard Guan Shuqing’s voice coming from inside.

“It’s not as simple as you think. The king of star-moon kingdom has already broken through to the fourth level of the void interpretation stage (the king of star-moon kingdom has broken through to the fourth level. There was a mistake earlier and it has been revised) . The stronger we act, the more they will be afraid of us!”

Feng Luan shook her head and said to them.

“Did you run into any trouble?”

At this moment, Wang Xian pushed open the door and entered. He asked Feng Luan.

“According to the information we received, the general and deputy general of the star-moon Army have already led the star-moon army into East Sea city. They are accompanied by a deputy sect leader of the Skymoon sect!”

Feng Luan did not hide anything when she saw Wang Xian enter.

“Star Moon Army? Skymoon sect?”

Wang Xian looked at Feng Luan in confusion and asked her.

“The Star Moon Army is the strongest army in the Star Moon Kingdom. The leader is the younger brother of the current king, a level three Seethrough void martial artist. The Skymoon sect is a sect in the star Moon Kingdom. The deputy sect leader has the strength of a level two seethrough void martial artist!”

Feng Luan explained to Wang Xian.
