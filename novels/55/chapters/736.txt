Xiao Yu’s expression changed slightly when she saw the object they threw at her. She was prepared to flee in all directions.

However, the terrifying immortal bursting explosive stone did not attack them from the center. Instead, it sealed off all the areas they could escape from.

“We’re finished!”

When Feng Lingtian saw the immortal bursting explosive stone that was sealed off, despair appeared on his face.

This time, he was even more desperate than when he was surrounded by fifteen experts from the immortal sects.

Xiao Yu’s expression changed slightly, and the black bone shield on his left hand grew bigger.

At this moment, Feng Lingtian felt the black bone shield surrounding him.

“My defense is very strong!”

Xiao Yu looked at Feng Lingtian and said to him.

“Boom!”

However, at this moment, the immortal bursting explosive stones surrounding them exploded.

A terrifying power.

Even from a hundred meters away, Xiao Yu could feel a terrifying energy rushing towards her body.

“Pu!”

Xiao Yu’s expression changed drastically as she spat out a mouthful of blood onto Feng Lingtian’s body.

“Not good!”Her expression changed.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

At this moment, continuous explosions sounded as Xiao Yu spat out a mouthful of blood.

Feng Lingtian was completely stunned as he looked at the blood in front of him.

“Boom! Boom!”

However, at this moment, an incomparable explosion sounded above their heads.

It was as though the sky had collapsed,

the ground had collapsed!

“Crack! Crack!”

Cracks appeared on Xiao Yu’s shield. Her expression changed and a trace of fear appeared in her eyes.

The bone shield itself was a part of her body.

She was originally a mutated bone dragon and the bone shield was her physical body. Now that the bone shield was cracked, it was equivalent to her body being heavily injured.

“Crack Crack Crack!”

The sounds of explosions in the surroundings continued. Drops of fresh blood dripped from the bone shield and fell towards the ground.

The fresh blood dripped onto Feng Lingtian’s body, causing his dazed eyes to regain some color.

The sounds of explosions in the surroundings began to decrease!

He quickly looked over and discovered that Xiao Yu’s face was extremely pale, as though there was no life left in him!

“No, no, why am I so useless!”

When Feng Lingtian saw this scene, his heart suddenly ached. His eyes were blood red, and his face slowly turned sinister. Drops of fresh blood were spat out from his mouth, and his body was emitting a green wind radiance.

The wind light directly tore through his clothes.

“Pu!”

Large mouthfuls of blood were spat out from his mouth, and the entire world seemed to quiet down in his ears.

The sound of an explosion, the sound of an immortal-breaking stone being thrown over.

“Ah!”

His eyes began to bleed. He picked up feather’s body and instantly flew into the sky.

“Shadowless Blood Escape!”

With a roar, he flew towards the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect at a speed that was three to four times faster than usual.

“Stop him! Kill him!”

The surrounding chaos origin immortal sects saw the figure that suddenly flew out and roared loudly.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

In an instant, golden figures charged towards windling tian.

“Damn it!”

“How can there be such a terrifying defense and that little bastard’s explosive speed? So Fast!”

In the sky, the vice sect leader of the Origin Immortal sect looked slightly embarrassed.

He clenched his fists tightly and glanced at the old man not far away. Finally, he relaxed.

If it was not for the immortal God beside him, he would really dare to take the risk and attack.

However, with the immortal God watching from the side, once he made a move, he would break the agreement between the immortal gods!

If the immortal God broke the agreement, he would be punished by all the immortal gods.

Up until now, no immortal God dared to break the agreement. Because of the rules, the first person who broke the agreement would definitely be the first person who broke the agreement.

At that time, his attack would even cause the entire immortal sect to fall into a desperate situation!

He did not dare to take the risk.

Feng Lingtian’s figure flew towards the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect at a terrifying speed.

The people behind him could not keep up at all.

The wind attribute was already one of the top two in terms of speed. Now that Feng Lingtian had used the blood sacrifice to explode, his speed was even more terrifying.

None of the experts of the chaos origin immortal sect had expected that they would be able to withstand the attack of the immortal blasting stone.

If a half-step immortal God was hit by these immortal blasting stones, he would instantly be heavily injured.

If a few dozen immortal god experts were hit at the same time, they would also be injured.

At this moment, several deep craters that were hundreds of meters deep appeared on the spot where the explosion had occurred.

If it wasn’t for Xiao Yu being a mutated bone dragon, if it were any other divine dragon, the earth divine dragon would probably not have been killed by the explosion.

The other divine dragons would all die under this terrifying attack.

“Ah Ah, we’re almost there, we’re almost there!”

Feng Lingtian hugged Xiao Yu’s body and turned into a green light.

“Ah Ah, someone, someone!”

The Yellow Heaven Immortal sect was right in front of them, and the infant realm experts from the chaos origin immortal sect behind them stopped with ugly expressions.

Feng Lingtian’s shrill voice rang out from the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect.

This caused everyone from the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect to be completely stunned.

“It’s the Crown Prince’s Voice!” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“It’s Ling Tian’s voice!”

Shocked voices rang out one after another, and the expressions of the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect experts changed drastically as they instantly flew into the sky.

The Crown Prince’s voice was too shrill, causing them to panic!

“Crown Prince!”

“Ling Tian!”

“Ling Tian!”

When the group of Immortal Sect’s infant realm experts saw Feng Lingtian’s figure, their faces changed drastically as they flew over!

The group of experts instantly used wind energy to support Feng Lingtian’s body!

“Hurry up and save him! Hurry Up!”

Feng Lingtian looked at the elders and deacons around him and shouted loudly.

“I’m too useless, too useless. I actually need a woman to protect me!”

Feng Lingtian kept on saying, causing the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect’s experts’expressions to change.

“Lingtian, go to the Medicine Peak, let’s go to the Medicine Peak!”

Everyone quickly looked at Xiao Yu in his arms, looking at the bone shield that was bleeding and their expressions changed.

“Sou!”

Everyone instantly landed on a mountain peak.

“Bring all the medicinal pills of the immortal sect over, bring them all over!”

Ling Tian frantically ordered.

“Yes, yes, Old Feng, bring over all the medicinal pills in the immortal sect, all of them!”

When the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect’s experts saw their crown prince in such a crazed state, their expressions changed drastically as they shouted.

“Save her, we must save her!”

Ling Tian’s mind seemed to have been stimulated as he roared in anger.

“Ling Tian, calm down. Miss Wang Yu still has a lot of hope, it’s just that her body has suffered a powerful attack!”

Elder Feng sensed little Yu’s body and heaved a sigh of relief as he spoke to Lingtian.

“Lingtian, who attacked you?”

An old man handed Lingtian one pill after another as he spoke with killing intent in his eyes.

“It’s the Chaos Origin Immortal sect. They used the chaos origin formation to trap us and used the immortal bursting explosion stone to attack us. If it wasn’t for her blocking the attack for me, I’m afraid...”

“I’m too useless. If it weren’t for her, two half-step immortal gods and thirteen infant realm experts would have already killed me!”

As Feng Lingtian spoke, he actually started to cry. He squatted on the ground and kept blaming himself.
