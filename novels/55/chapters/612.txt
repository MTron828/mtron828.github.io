Chapter 613: He Is The Dragon King (4)

“How’s this possible? How could this be? How can he be that powerful!?”

“This is madness. It’s insane. The stances weren’t even this forceful during the spar between Roving Sword and Senior Brother Hong Tianda. Now how did it ...”

“Just earlier, Senior Brother Roving Sword had said that the Elder from Immortal Slaying Sect had been the one to concede defeat personally by gesturing to the referee. Why would he do that?”

“Two moves. All it took was two mere moves to defeat Senior Brother Ge Wen. It was really formidable!”

“The gap is too huge. To think that Senior Brother Ge Wen, the Invincible one of the Young Generation, has been defeated so easily. This... This...”

The surrounding hundreds of thousands of disciples uttered as they gulped in disbelief, watching Senior Brother Ge Wen. He was slowly picking himself up from the ground while recovering from a state of being a mess.

This was the number one Senior Brother Ge Wen, Champion of a Grand Tournament! DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

To think that he could not even withstand two moves!

Just how powerful was the prowess of Roving Sword?

“This fellow...!”

Meanwhile, the Elders from the Immortal Slaying Sect muttered as their group of more than a dozen watched from atop the summit they were at. They all looked on with darkened and awful expressions.

But while they were fuming in fury, they were also overwhelmed by shock and trepidation at the same time.

“Don’t tell me he... he made some breakthroughs in his swordsmanship?”

“How could this be. How long has it been? To think his prowess has developed this much. He’s one wicked talent!”

“Given his Spiritual Equipment and armor, along with his prowess, Ge Wen is already considered to be at the apex of the Budding Realm. And yet, he’s been defeated in two moves. Don’t tell me Roving Sword’s prowess has already ascended to Half-Step to Immortal Realm!”

“That’s possible. It appears that he is very likely to reach the Immortal Realm, even if he doesn’t enter the Yong Chang Cauldron!”

The group of Elders from the Immortal Slaying Sect spoke as they eyed Roving Sword with the utmost shock and caution.

After all, the prowess which the latter displayed had sent them into alarm and frenzy.

“Wow, if he still isn’t allowed into the Yong Chang Cauldron given his current prowess, then...,” the Elder from the Immortal Slaying Sect murmured with a contorted look. The Immortal Slaying Sect had really embarrassed themselves this time around.

The approach of Roving Sword was also no doubt a tight slap to the Immortal Slaying Sect.

“Dragon King!” Roving Sword called out. He was checking on Ge Wen, who was located beneath, before arriving by Wang Xian’s side.

“Oh!”

Without saying a word, Wang Xian nodded in response as he stood atop the summit, expressionless.

To which, Roving Sword also remained silent as he stood behind Wang Xian on his diagonal right.

Wang Xian had his reasons for mobilizing Roving Sword and allowing him to defeat Ge Wen.

The Immortal Slaying Sect had forbidden Roving Sword from entering the Yong Chang Cauldron which was somewhat against the rules of the Grand Tournament. Yet, he had no means of intervention given that this was the decision made by the Immortal Slaying Sect.

In that case, he might as well allow Roving Sword to defeat Ge Wen. With even the champion of the Grand Tournament of the three major Immortal Sects being unable to make it into the Yong Chang Cauldron, it would no doubt place the Immortal Slaying Sect in a difficult position.

Perhaps then, through this method, the Immortal Slaying Sect would allow Roving Sword into the Yong Chang Cauldron.

“Tsk, Roving Sword seems to be on rather amicable terms with this Dragon King!”

Just then, the crowd of outstanding young heroes who had been suspended in mid-air took in one deep breath as they eyed Wang Xian and Roving Sword who were on stage with glistening eyes.

“This Roving Sword seems to be very obedient towards the Dragon King’s words. Have you all noticed that he’s been standing one step behind the Dragon King throughout these proceedings while paying him due respect!”

One of the outstanding young heroes looked on at the duo with utter shock, as they remained on stage.

As of now, the only ones remaining on the stage of the summit were Roving Sword and Wang Xian. As they stood, they gave off a special vibe to the rest who were watching.

It was an attitude as though they were invincible.

It was an attitude as though they had the world at their feet.

“His prowess?”

Jin Jian and Ao Shuwen questioned this with awful expressions as they eyed the duo that was on stage.

“Seems like Roving Sword is no match for the Dragon King which explains why he’s so respectful towards him!”

Hong Tianda finally managed a comment after gasping in a deep breath. At the same time, the crowd of outstanding young heroes who were suspended in mid-air remained silent for a long while.

“What?”

All the outstanding young heroes were stunned by the sentence from Hong Tianda as they turned their heads in utter shock.

“How’s that possible? I reckon, with Roving Sword’s prowess, even the Elders from our Immortal Sects would be no match for him. How can that Dragon King be even stronger than Roving Sword then!?”

Ao Shuwen rebutted immediately while his face darkened.

“In my opinion, Roving Sword would be able to handle at least five to six Budding Realm experts single-handedly. So how can that Dragon King be even stronger than him!?”

“Don’t tell me their prowess has reached Half-step to Immortality?” another young hero questioned with a low growl.

“He ever defeated me in one move!” Hong Tianda replied coolly as he watched Wang Xian with shifting eyes.

“What...defeated you, Senior Brother Hong, in one move!”

All the young heroes gasped once again. As they did, they spun their heads about and fixed their gazes upon Wang Xian.

“Roving Sword was able to defeat Senior Brother Ge Wen using two moves while the Dragon King was able to take Senior Brother Hong down in one. Hah, hah, they, they...” The young heroes had their tongues tied as they gazed at the duo on the stage.

The hundreds of thousands of disciples who remained beneath also had their eyes on the duo who remained on stage.

“Why aren’t the other Seniors getting up on the summit stage?” some of the disciples muttered under their breath as they watched in confusion.

“Let’s go!”

After another round of silence which lasted under a minute, Hong Tianda shifted his stance before leaping gently onto the summit stage. He stood to the side while sweeping his gaze across the duo.

Piao Lingxue looked at Wang Xian and still did not walk over to him after some brief contemplation.

She felt as though the other party and herself were beings from two different worlds!

“If what Hong Tianda says is true. Perhaps then, under some preemptive calculation, the Dragon King and Roving Sword pair are enough to kill fifteen experts of the Budding Realm!”

Ao Shuwen managed this with a burdened look while his eyes watered.

“Dear Outstanding Young Heroes, please stand along the aisle. Sect Leader Hong Yan will soon present you with your awards!”

Just then, the voice of an elder from the Yong Chang Immortal Sect could be heard.

The various disciples made their way to the fringe of the stage. After having just recovered from their excitement, their eyes were stirring with emotions.

To each and every one of the disciples, it was an immense honor to be able to have the Grand Immortal grace the event in person.

“Will the Immortal appear?” Wang Xian asked in mild surprise, but recovered his composure soon after.

For he feared no Immortal right now!

Shoom!

Just then, a commotion was stirring from beneath.

“Huh? It’s Junior Sister Xiaoxiao!”

“It’s Junior Sister Xiaoxiao. The attire on her though, looks so... so scary!”

“Such a powerful surge of flames from this attire. It’s covered in Level 12 Spiritual Equipment from top to bottom!” the crowd of outstanding young heroes said as they looked down. Upon seeing Xiaoxiao, who was emitting Holy Flames while she flapped her Flaming Wings, the youths peered at her in envy.

Xiaoxiao was decked in Spiritual Equipment from head to toe, from her earrings, necklace, bangles, shoes, clothes, and wings.

“I reckon it’s the Spiritual Equipment which His Excellency Huolong has made for Junior Sister Xiaoxiao!”

The crowd of youths muttered to themselves while green with envy.

“Dear Senior Brothers and Sisters, I’m here!” Xiaoxiao said in elation as she smiled while glancing over to the crowd who stood on the summit stage.

“Come over quick, Xiaoxiao!”

“Come on up, Junior Sister!”

The group of youths gestured to Xiaoxiao with big smiles.

Smiling, she nodded in response before flapping her wings in resemblance to a beautiful and adorable Flaming Angel.

Turning their heads to look up at her, the hundreds of thousands of disciples underneath looked on in complete awe.

Some of the male disciples even uttered to themselves, saying that the one who marries her would be able to have it easy for the rest of their life!
