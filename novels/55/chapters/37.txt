Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

“Hey, young lad! Not bad, not bad.”

Zhou Yuanhao looked at Wang Xian, extended his hand towards his shoulders and wanted to pat on them.

“Hehe.”

Wang Xian had his eyes fixed on this young man as he avoided his palm fluently. He had the feeling that this dude was up to something.

Zhou Yuanhao’s arm stiffened. Following which, he smiled and said, “Let’s go. I’ve made a reservation and we can go straight to the private lounge.”

“Misters, this way please.”

As Zhou Yuanhao spoke, the waitress by the side led the way for him.

First-grade House could be divided into two stories. The lower level was the main hall while the upper story was where the private lounges were at.

“First-grade Restaurant is a rather famous restaurant in Rivertown. You can get to taste all types of seafood, abalone, shark fin and sea cucumber. Sometimes, there is also precious seafood such as Atlantic Bluefin marlin sashimi.”

Zhou Yuanhao was walking at the front of the pack as he explained to the group with a face full of smiles. He looked to Guan Shuqing and Wang Xian, who was beside her, and said, “Shuqing, your school is around this area. I’m guessing you know about this restaurant.”

“Of course I know about it. This restaurant is known to be expensive,” Guan Shuqing smiled and replied.

“Hehe, I came here once previously when a friend of mine was giving me a treat. I have to say that the food here is really expensive. A meal in a private lounge will cost at least seven to eight thousand. This is the level of a five-star hotel. Since Director Zhou is paying today, we are in for a treat!”

“First-grade Restaurant is known for its seafood. Although they are delicious, their prices are too expensive. I heard about it previously but this is still the first time I’ve come here. I have to thank Director Zhou for your generosity.”

The two young commented with intentions to flatter Director Zhou.

“Hehe. As long as everyone works hard and we do well, such a gathering will be common in the future.”

Zhou Yuanhao said with magnanimity, “Although First-grade Restaurant is expensive, the food they serve is really delicious. I have always liked their food and often patronize this restaurant.”

“In that case, we’ve got to stick close to Director Zhou in the future. There aren’t many bosses who are as generous as Director Zhou!” a girl smiled and said to Director Zhou.

“Naturally, I wouldn’t treat you guys badly.”

The edge of Zhou Yuanhao’s mouth arched up.

Guan Shuqing and Wang Xian followed behind and didn’t comment as the group arrived at a private lounge.

“Shuqing, you can sit beside me.”

Zhou Yuanhao sat at the seat of the host as he spoke to Guan Shuqing, who was just beside him.

Guan Shuqing was taken aback slightly before nodding her head and sitting down. She looked to Wang Xian and said, “Wang Xian, why don’t you sit beside me?”

“Huh? Alright.” Wang Xian nodded his head. The few young men and women took a glance at Zhou Yuanhao and Guan Shuqing before sinking into deep thought.

“You guys, take a look at the menu and see what would you like to have. Come! Just order as you wish.”

Zhou Yuanhao passed the menu to Guan Shuqing and asked, “Take a look and see if there’s anything you would like. You can just order it directly.”

“It’s okay, Director Zhou. I’m not a picky eater and am fine with anything.” Guan Shuqing waved her hand and handed the menu back to him.

“You... Alright. In that case, let me order a few dishes. Hmm... This sea cucumber porridge with lotus seed is good for the complexion. Let’s get a bowl for Shuqing and the ladies here.”

Zhou Yuanhao looked and spoke to Guan Shuqing and the few other ladies.

“Our Director Zhou is such a gentleman. Hehe,” one of the ladies laughed and said.

“That’s true. After all, Director Zhou attended a famous University in the UK for three years. He’s definitely the role model of a gentleman,” a young man commented as he tried to get on the good books of Director Zhou subtly.

“Haha.” Zhou Yuanhao smiled. “Alright, let’s get a bottle of champagne and white wine to go along with the seafood.”

“Alright, Mister, please wait a moment.” The waitress by the side nodded her head, collected the menus and walked out of the lounge.

“Shuqing, do you have the intention to come to our company to work after you graduate from school?” Zhou Yuanhao asked as he poured Guan Shuqing a cup of tea after filling his own cup.

“Director Zhou, I can do it myself.” Guan Shuqing tried to take the teapot and pour for herself in a hurry. “I still have two years until my graduation.”

“It’s alright. You can come over to the company during the weekends or when you have no classes. I wouldn’t scrimp on your salary. Our company business is growing larger and larger and we still need some talents,” Zhou Yuanhao remarked.

“This...” Guan Shuqing was a little tempted. Now that her father had declared bankruptcy, her family conditions weren’t too great. Currently, she had to settle her own living expenses.

“I think it’s fine. Shuqing, this is a good idea. After all, the curriculum of university isn’t that tight. You definitely could gain some working experience during your free time. This is a good thing.”

“Yeah, just take a look at how well Director Zhou is treating us. It’s hard to get a good boss like him. You might not be able to get such a good job even after you graduated.”

The two young men by the side tried to convince Guan Shuqing.

“Hmm, this would work too.” Guan Shuqing took a look at Wang Xian who was beside her and nodded her head.

When Zhou Yuanhao heard her reply, a joyous feeling surged. “Haha, let’s welcome Shuqing for joining us officially.”

As they were chatting, the dishes were being served one by one.

Zhou Yuanhao kept trying to chat with Guan Shuqing. As for Wang Xian, he just sat there alone as he ate the food.

“Shuqing, do you have a boyfriend?”

Suddenly, Zhou Yuanhao asked Guan Shuqing.

This question shocked Guan Shuqing. Her eyes were wavering as she turned her head over and looked at Wang Xian.

Zhou Yuanhao saw her action and frowned. His vision fell on Wang Xian as he tried to change the topic. “Oh, Shuqing, you haven’t introduced us to this friend of yours!”

“This is my classmate, Wang Xian,” Guan Shuqing replied immediately.

“Hello, everyone, I’m Wang Xian.” Wang Xian remarked.

“Don’t just eat, let’s have a chat.” Zhou Yuanhao looked at him and squeezed out a faint smile. “Brother Wang Xian, your family conditions should be pretty good. What is your family like?” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Family?” When Wang Xian heard him, he laughed, “I only have a sister as kin.”

“Huh?” Zhou Yuanhao was slightly stunned and shocked. A smile appeared as he continued, “I’m sorry to ask about something that I shouldn’t have. However, please allow me to say this. Brother Wang Xian, life isn’t easy. You should be making plans for life after graduation. Similar to Shuqing, you are from the University of Rivertown. It’s clear that you are a capable man. Why don’t you come and work for my company? If you work for me, it would definitely be better when you try to look for a job after graduation.”

“That’s right. We will be working for Director Zhou in the future and he would be our leader. Haha!” a young man laughed and said.

“Hehe. It’s alright.” Wang Xian shook his head. “It’s better to just enjoy my university life!”

“Oh, Xiao Wang, that’s not a good mentality to have. You should be working hard starting from university. When you say you want to enjoy your university life, what are you actually thinking of? I’m guessing it’s not playing games and is about finding a beautiful girlfriend. However, you need to be rich to find a beautiful girlfriend. Buying a bag for your girlfriend would set you back several tens of thousands! Similarly, buying clothes, jewellery and gifts would also be in the range of several tens of thousands!”

“As a young man, one should have goals. This would then give you motivation. If you can’t rely on your family, you can only then rely on yourself.”

“For example, if you want to get a girlfriend as beautiful as Shuqing, you can’t be just giving her a bag that costs a few hundred. Moreover, you can’t even get one at a few hundred dollars nowadays. It can’t be that you are thinking of bringing her to the canteen for meals all the time. All of these would cost money. If I had a girlfriend as beautiful as Shuqing, branded bags and clothes are a necessity. As for other gifts or even a house or car, these are needed in the future.”

“The company my family owns has just started. Despite that, our annual profits are in the range of five to six million dollars. Even so, I feel that my conditions in Rivertown are still below average. Therefore, a young man like you should be looking to start working hard from a young age.”

“Xiao Wang, you can consider working for me in the future. You can still expect to easily earn $3,000 a month in a part-time role.”

Director Zhou lit a cigarette and smiled.

In his words, he had lifted himself up subtly and bashed Wang Xian..

Work part-time for $3,000 a month?
