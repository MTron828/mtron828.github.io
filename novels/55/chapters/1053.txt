Chapter 1054: 1,055 sky-high price demonic beast bloodline

Translator: 5496903

Zhang Yushu and the others were dumbstruck.

Today, at the auction held by the Phoenix Immortal, the admission tickets had already been sold for tens of thousands of middle-grade spirit stones.

However, when they entered, no one stopped them. When they went up to the third floor, they also directly entered. Moreover, there was no one in the private room, only them.

After all, those who were qualified to enter the private room were all profound void tier experts and their strength!

Could it be that that young man was a big shot? Or perhaps he was the successor of a powerful family?

Thinking of this, Zhang Yushu looked at his aunt.

“Aunt, was that your boyfriend just now? So powerful, he was actually able to bring us directly to the private room!”

“When did this happen? It’s good to have such a little uncle-in-law!”

Zhang Yushu mumbled, his face full of happiness.

“Shut up, you. Don’t provoke that Hai Wen in the future. He’s not someone we can afford to provoke!”

Zhang Fengying’s small face was slightly red. She glared at him and said directly.

“Isn’t there a little uncle-in-law? If he can enter the private room, his family also has a terrifying expert at the profound void tier!”

As Zhang Yushu spoke, his face turned dejected. “Sigh, I didn’t expect Xiaomei to be such a person!”

Zhang Fengying rolled her eyes at him and found a seat to sit down. She ignored him.

...

“Let’s eat something. The auction is about to start!”

In the room on the fourth floor, Wang Xian placed the packed dishes in front of Feng Luan with a smile.

“HMM, I’m not interested. Take a look!”

Feng Luan raised her head and said to him.

“TSK TSK, I still can’t compete with Her Majesty the Empress. This is my biggest gain since coming to the transcendence continent!”

“For the spiritual stones that will be auctioned tonight, your Fengxian Elixir and weapons workshop will exchange all the spiritual stones for elixirs!”

Wang Xian said directly to Feng Luan.

“Alright, I’ll get someone to prepare it and send it to you in two days!”

Feng Luan said.

“Your Majesty, we can use this opportunity to throw Fengxian out!”

The old woman at the side said to Feng Luan.

“MMM, we have to give up. Otherwise, a large portion of our energy will be spent on the Fengxian Pill and Weapons Workshop!”

Feng Luan nodded.

“Yes? What’s wrong? Fengxian won’t open it in the future?”

Wang Xian asked Feng Luan with a surprised expression.

“Yes, keep what’s left in Donghai City and sell the rest!”

Feng Luan nodded and did not hide anything. “Now, Fengxian has spread throughout the Three Kingdoms. However, the impact of the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Saint Item Forging workshop is too great. It will consume a lot of energy!”

“Furthermore, the next development will require a terrifying amount of spirit stones. We have to sell all of Feng Xian!”

Wang Xian nodded his head slightly. “Initially, I was planning to set up a pill and weapon workshop when I came to the transcendence continent. Since you opened it, I didn’t open it. Now, it seems like it’s a wise choice!”

“However, you still have to keep some shops. In the future, the pills that I buy alone will be enough to support a lot!”

“HMM, sure. I’ll give you a 30% discount when the time comes!”

Feng Luan smiled.

Wang Xian shook his head and didn’t mind. “Sure!”

“Welcome to the auction held by the Phoenix Elixir and weapons workshop. I know why everyone is here. I Won’t waste any more words and will start the bidding immediately!”

“Now, Let’s start with the first item. The first item is also the item that everyone is paying the most attention to. The bloodline of the half-step void interpretation demonic beast. Let’s start the bidding immediately!”

At this moment, an old man’s voice came from the hall on the first floor.

The old man stood on the auction stage and said to everyone with a smile on his face.

The auction began immediately!

The first item was the half-step void interpretation demonic beast bloodline!

After the first item was auctioned off, they would be able to compete for the next item even more freely.

Otherwise, many aristocratic families wouldn’t dare to make a move. They were afraid that there would be pressure when bidding for the half-step void interpretation demonic beast bloodline.

“Half-step Void Interpretation Demonic Beast bloodline. This demonic beast bloodline is the wind-winged Savage Fish Bloodline!”

“Many people should know about the wind-winged savage fish. It is the wind-winged savage fish species in the wind-bell forest of the Eastern Sea city. Now, it has been obtained by us, the Phoenix Immortal!”

“I don’t need to say much about the value of the half-step void interpretation demonic beast bloodline. Everyone is clear that the starting bid now is 10 billion middle-grade spirit stones. Each increment must not be less than one billion. Now, let the bidding begin!”

“Peng!”

The hammer landed, and a clear sound echoed in everyone’s ears.

“F * ck, the first one is auctioning the half-step void Interpretation Demon Beast bloodline. Do you have to be so crazy! ?”

“I didn’t expect this to be the bloodline of the wind wing savage fish. The wind wing savage fish is a wind attribute demon beast, and its strength is very powerful. Especially in terms of speed, it can’t catch up with those of the same level!”

“The bloodline of the wind-wing Savage Fish Demon Beast is definitely the most powerful demon beast below the insightful void realm. It seems that the wind-wing savage fish has a magical ability called Wind Howl. It is very powerful!”

When the first auction item, the bloodline of the wind-wing Savage Fish Demon Beast, was brought out, everyone had a heated expression on their faces.

The people of East Sea city were very familiar with the wind-wing savage fish. It was a demon beast with a powerful wind attribute.

It had once attacked the East Sea city and was killed by the city Lord and the commander of the ocean cultivator corps.

Among the demon beasts, its strength was relatively strong, especially its speed!

“It’s actually the bloodline of the wind-winged savage fish. Each of the wind-winged savage fish’s abilities are more practical. It’s one of the best among the same level!”

In the private room upstairs, City Lord Lei Feihu looked at the bloodline of the wind-winged savage fish below, and his eyes revealed a trace of fervor.

A few years ago, the ones who killed the experts of the wind-winged Savage Fish clan were him and the experts of the city Lord’s mansion.

He was deeply aware of the strength of the wind-winged savage fish.

“If it doesn’t exceed 35 billion middle-grade spirit stones, we can take it down!”

City Lord Lei Feihu slightly clenched his fist, and his eyes flickered.

The higher-ups of the Eastern Sea city saw City Lord Lei’s expression and knew that the city lord was about to make a move.

They looked at each other, their eyes filled with helplessness.

They also wanted to obtain such a half-step void interpretation demonic beast bloodline.

But they knew that this bloodline was not something they could compete for.

Even the city lord was not 100% sure that he could compete for it.

They knew very well how many experts were participating in the auction.

Five insightful void realm experts had personally arrived, and there were also a few clans with insightful void realm experts.

“10 billion mid-grade spirit stones starting bid. Oh My God, this is 10 billion, I wonder how many will be sold in the end!”

“Oh my God, Our clan has prepared more than 10 billion mid-grade spirit stones, it seems like we are going to be finished!”

“This half-step void interpretation demonic beast bloodline isn’t something we can participate in at all. It’s most likely a competition between the experts in the private room!” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“If it doesn’t exceed 20 billion mid-grade spirit stones, we can compete for it!”

In the hall, everyone spoke in a low voice as they looked at the bloodline, their eyes burning with incomparable fervor.

“20 billion!”

However, right at this moment, a voice directly came from within the private room.

Everyone widened their eyes and felt that their vision was a little blurry. Spirit stones were spinning in front of their eyes one after another.

The face of the elder who said that he was prepared to fight for 20 billion turned black.

Damn it, the first bid had already reached 20 billion, what was there to fight for!
