“The dragon spike mercenary group still hasn’t reached the stage where they can kill whoever they want!”

Wang Xian mumbled. With so many people, it could be seen how unpopular mayor Lin Xiao was.

However, the dragon Spike had no choice but to take into consideration the strength of the Star Moon Empire.

If the Star Moon Empire sent out experts to target the dragon spike, although they wouldn’t be wiped out, they would still be in big trouble.

“I think I should stop!”

Wang Xian shook his head and looked at the other missions.

Most of the assassination missions in Qiao Lin Town were to assassinate the Lin family.

Not only did they assassinate the Lin family’s extraordinaire level four and level five experts, there were also several missions to assassinate the extraordinaire level one and level two experts.

This should be the revenge of the Lin family’s disciples who used the Lin family’s prestige to humiliate others.

The dragon Spike accepted all the missions.

Other than the missions of the Lin family, there weren’t many other missions. There were only five or six missions. The highest mission was to assassinate a leader of the mercenary group who was at extraordinary level six.

When Wang Xian saw this leader of the mercenary group, he felt a sense of familiarity. Then, he thought of the leader of the mercenary group who had talked to the Lin family at the entrance last night.

He accepted all the missions. Then, Wang Xian started to collect the commission.

“Members of the Immortal Phoenix mercenary group, you are surrounded. Come Out Now!”

At five in the afternoon, a roar suddenly sounded from outside. Wang Xian was stunned! Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Wang Xian was slightly stunned and his face was full of astonishment.

His eyes flashed with a strange luster and he immediately looked around.

“This is?”

Wang Xian suddenly widened his eyes and looked around with an embarrassed expression.

City guards, the city guards of Qiulin town.

A total of more than a hundred people were standing in front of the restaurant. In the middle stood an old man.

Wang Xian immediately recognized this old man.

Mayor Lin Xiao!

“What are they trying to do?”

Wang Xian’s expression was a little ugly as he swept his gaze across the group of people.

“The Celestial Phoenix Mercenary Group hired the Dragon Assassin Group to assassinate the members of the Lin family. The evidence is conclusive. From today onwards, the remaining members of the Lin family will join the mayor’s residence. I hope that some of them will not go against the star-moon Kingdom!”

At this moment, Lin Xiao’s voice rang out.

He was announcing the verdict!

He was issuing a warning!

Firstly, he was announcing the verdict. The Celestial Phoenix Mercenary Group hired assassins to assassinate the members of the Lin family. The evidence was conclusive.

Secondly, it was a warning to the dragon assassin group. The rest of the members of the Lin family were already members of the mayor’s mansion. If they were to make a move again, they had to pay attention!

A sentence was heard clearly by everyone in the surroundings.

Wang Xian’s expression changed slightly. A cold look appeared in his eyes.

He moved and flew out of the window onto the street with an embarrassed expression. Ao Jian and the rest followed closely behind him.

Wang Xian’s face was solemn as he looked at Lin Xiao who was in the sky. “Mayor Lin, do you have any evidence that my immortal Phoenix mercenary group hired assassins to assassinate the Lin Family?”

“Evidence? I am the evidence. You hired assassins to assassinate my father and the rest. It was you!”

At this moment, Lin Feng and a dozen people from the Lin family walked out. They stared at Wang Xian with bloodthirsty eyes and roared with murderous intent.

Wang Xian glanced at them and raised his gaze to look at the expressionless Lin Xiao again. “Mayor Lin, can the words of a single person from the Lin family be used as evidence?”

“The evidence is conclusive. Come back with us. If there’s any injustice, we’ll talk about it in the prison cell!”

Lin Xiao looked at Wang Xian expressionlessly and said coldly.

“Hiss, the Celestial Phoenix mercenary group is going to be taken away by the Mayor!”

“This... this...”

When the crowd saw this scene, they immediately understood that the mayor wanted to take revenge for the Lin Family!

“Now, not only does the mayor want to take revenge for the Lin family, he has also warned the secret dragon assassin organization that it is forbidden to kill the members of the Lin Family!”

“I didn’t expect that. I didn’t expect that Mayor Lin would protect the Lin family directly. This is troublesome. Mayor Lin didn’t have any children in his early years and didn’t have any relatives. Therefore, he is completely unafraid of the dragon thorns. He also knows that the Dragon Thorns wouldn’t dare to assassinate him!”

“This is troublesome. Damn it!”

“It’s over. I didn’t expect that the mayor would actually do such a thing. The dragon Spike is afraid of the strength of star-moon kingdom, so it doesn’t dare to make a move at all!”

When the surrounding crowd saw this scene and heard Lin Xiao’s voice, their faces turned ugly.

However, the surroundings were deathly silent, and no one dared to make a sound.

Provoking Lin Xiao was simply courting death. He had a hundred ways to kill him.

In fact, Lin Xiao, who controlled the formation in the town, was even more terrifying than the dragon assassin organization.

The dragon assassin might still need to assassinate him. As long as he sealed off an area, he could kill him directly!

Now, the mayor was obviously protecting the remaining members of the Lin Family!

This made many people clench their fists tightly.

Wang Xian stared at Lin Xiao. A hint of killing intent flashed in his eyes. “Mayor Lin, you want to capture us for no reason. is someone like you worthy of being the mayor?”

“How dare you!”

Just as Wang Xian finished his sentence, a roar came from the side.

An old man standing beside Lin Xiao glared at Wang Xian. “How dare a small mercenary group act so arrogantly towards the mayor? Men, suppress them. If they dare to resist, kill them without mercy!”

Lin Xiao also stared at Wang Xian coldly with a hint of coldness in his eyes.

He raised his head slightly and an aura of an extraordinary level eight powerhouse slowly enveloped Wang Xian.

“This Celestial Phoenix mercenary group is doomed!”

“It’s over. We’ve offended Lin Xiao. We’re dead meat this time!”

“What a pity. Such a good man has fallen in our Qiao Lin Town!”

When the surrounding people saw this scene, their expressions changed slightly.

“Kid, you’re dead for sure today!”

“I’m going to cut you into a thousand pieces!”

Lin Feng and the rest who were in the middle of the road shouted at Wang Xian with ferocious expressions.

Wang Xian’s gaze swept across them. A group of city guards surrounded him. Lin Feng was the ferocious cursemancer.

There were already close to 10,000 people gathered around him, but no one dared to say anything.

“Next, the crowdfunding mission to assassinate the Mayor!”

“Begin the assassination!”

“Today, the Dragon Assassin organization will let you know what lawlessness is!”

“Even if it’s the mayor, I will still dare to kill him if he gets agitated!”

When Wang Xian saw this scene, his expression turned cold. He had an idea and immediately gave the order.

Assassinate the mayor!

“Whoosh!”

A breeze blew over from nowhere.

Suddenly, a red piece of paper floated down from the sky.

It was densely packed with red pieces of paper. Those who didn’t know would think that it was the result of someone getting married.

However, it wasn’t.

The red pieces of paper floated down.

Slowly, all the pieces of paper floated towards the position of mayor Lin Xiao.

“What is that?”

On the street below, some people suddenly saw the red piece of paper that appeared out of nowhere and shouted in shock.

“This... This is the congratulatory death piece of the Dragon Assassin Organization!”

“What? There is a dragon assassin organization around? What is the Dragon Assassin organization doing?”

Everyone looked over and looked at the congratulatory death piece of paper floating toward Mayor Lin Xiao in shock!
