Chapter 1256: 1257 supreme geniuses

Translator: 5496903

There were more than a hundred princes in the Light Dragon dynasty, but only seven or eight were qualified to compete for the position of crown prince.

The second Prince Long Xiaotian was one, the first Prince Long Xiaochen, the eighth Prince Long Xiaoyun, the sixteenth prince, the twenty-second prince, the thirty-sixth prince, the forty-second prince, and the forty-seventh prince.

The eight princes were the most outstanding princes in the Light Dragon dynasty, and each of them could be called geniuses in the outside world.

The first few princes had reached the half-step void interpretation realm, and their strength was unparalleled.

Long Xiaotian looked at the four princes in front of him, and his eyes revealed a trace of seriousness.

“Big Brother, 16th brother, 22nd brother, 36th Brother!”

Looking at the four young men flying in front of him, he nodded lightly.

“Second brother, where are you going with so many people?”

A blue-robed young man swept his gaze over the people beside Long Xiaotian. A faint smile appeared on his face as he asked once again.

“The training ground. Big Brother, and a few younger brothers. I didn’t expect that you guys would actually mix together!”

Long Xiaotian’s face revealed a faint smile as he looked at them and said.

“Second brother, you’re currently in the limelight. You’ve already surpassed all of us by a head. Even eighth brother was forced by you to head to the origin light dragon pool in search of an even stronger strength. We naturally have to unite together!”

Long Xiaochen, who was standing in the middle, revealed a trace of a cold smile on his face as he spoke with a somewhat ugly expression.

After long Xiaotian obtained a group of fierce beast mounts, his strength was much higher than the other princes. In addition, some time ago, all of the eighth Prince’s subordinates had been killed by his friends.

After that, Long Xiaotian obtained dozens of powerful and talented people who came to seek refuge with him.

This made long Xiaotian’s strength soar like the Sun in the sky, almost double the strength of the other princes.

“Eighth brother went to the Origin Light Dragon Pond?”

Long Xiaotian’s expression changed slightly, and a trace of shock flashed in his eyes.

“That’s not the case. Even when father sent him a message, he didn’t accept it. Hehe, but second brother, the position of crown prince may not necessarily be yours!”

Long Xiaochen revealed a faint sneer on his face.

“If it wasn’t for me, no one would have the qualifications to do so!”

Long Xiaotian replied confidently.

“Hehe, is this your friend? Very good, very good!”

The expressions of the four princes turned cold. They looked at Wang Xian and asked coldly.

Wang Xian looked at the four of them who were looking at him. A faint smile appeared on his face.

This was especially so for the young man who spoke.

Long Xiaochen. If he remembered correctly, he was ranked tenth on the Heaven’s pride roll. When he challenged him back then, he admitted defeat immediately.

However, Long Xiaochen didn’t know that the Wang Xian he was looking at was the heaven’s pride roll that made him surrender.

“This is my brother. If there’s nothing else, I’ll take my leave First!”

Long Xiaotian smiled. He patted the head of the black shadow leopard and walked straight ahead.

His subordinates followed behind him and flew towards the depths of the tomb of the demi-human.

“HMPH!”

Seeing Long Xiaotian leave, the faces of Long Xiaochen and the rest darkened. Their eyes flickered as they stared at their departing figures.

“Big Brother, we have to join hands and kick second brother out as soon as possible. Otherwise...”

The eyes of the twenty-second prince flickered as he spoke.

“Call out 42 and 47 and discuss with them!”

Long Xiaochen said with a gloomy face.

Facing such a powerful long Xiaotian, they could only join hands.

...

“Brother Wang Xian, I’m really sorry to have involved you in the fight for the throne!”

As he flew towards the central area of the demi-human graveyard, Long Xiaotian looked at Wang Xian and said apologetically.

“It’s alright. The battle for the throne of the Guanglong dynasty isn’t too dangerous!”

Wang Xian smiled and shook his head nonchalantly.

The battle for the throne of the Guanglong dynasty was still far from being comparable to the battle for the throne of the ancient princes on Earth.

The power that the princes could use, the second level of the Dingtian Dongxu, was almost negligible to him.

“Now, my brothers are going to join forces to deal with me. Brother Wang Xian, you have to be careful. I think they will also deal with you!”

Long Xiaotian had a serious expression on his face. “What I didn’t expect was that my eighth brother went to the light dragon origin pool!”

“Huh? What kind of place is the origin of the Light Dragon Pool?”

Wang Xian asked doubtfully.

“The origin of the Light Dragon Pool is a place where the ancestors of our long family rose to prominence. It is a bottomless space filled with danger. Anyone who enters it would almost certainly die. However, if they are lucky, they might be able to obtain a heaven-defying treasure. What I didn’t expect was that my eighth brother actually went all out!”

Long Xiaotian frowned, he looked at Wang Xian and said, “The one who spoke to my brothers just now is my big brother. He is currently ranked eighth on the Heaven’s pride ranking. He is the strongest among us princes. He has recruited many elite subordinates through the title of Heaven’s pride. In a few days, he will probably participate in the supreme prodigy tournament of the Heaven’s Pride Bridge and fight with the demons. If he can defeat his opponent, his reputation will definitely soar. He is the strongest force other than me...”. “... “...”

Long Xiaotian introduced the situation of the princes to Wang Xian one by one, reminding him to be more careful. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Wang Xian nodded his head silently at the side. He knew that Long Xiaotian was telling him to be more careful.

After all, the princes could not commit suicide. They could indeed kill their subordinates.

When they talked about the first prince, they also talked about the heaven’s pride bridge. Regarding the Heaven’s pride bridge in ten days time, Wang Xian would participate on time. He had to obtain the title of the supreme prodigy.

If he obtained the title of Supreme Genius, he would be able to obtain the reward of the heaven’s Pride Stage’s spiritual liquid infusion.

In the past, there were very few humans who had obtained the title of Supreme Genius. The sect leader of the Heavenly Sword sect was one of them. Back then, with his powerful sword techniques and his strength at the first level of the Seethrough realm, he obtained the title of Supreme Genius.

After obtaining the title of Supreme Genius, his strength rose to the second level of the Seethrough realm immediately after he walked out of the supreme platform.

One of the main reasons was because of the infusion of spiritual liquid.

Other than the sect master of the Heavenly Sword sect, no one else had obtained the title of supreme prodigy for more than a hundred years.

Demonic Beasts, to humans, had enormous talent. That was, they did not need to comprehend divine abilities or dharma forms. As long as they had sufficient resources, they could quickly increase their strength.

Every time there was a supreme genius, there would be an existence at the insightful void tier among the demonic beasts.

Humans were no match for them at all.

However, Wang Xian was determined to get this supreme genius. Even if he encountered a demonic beast at the second level of the insightful void tier, Wang Xian would be able to defeat it or even kill it!

The group of people flew into the depths of the graveyard of the human and demonic beasts. After more than an hour, a dilapidated building complex appeared in their sight.

In this building complex, there was only one building that was well-preserved. The building occupied an area of 1,000 meters.

Inside the building, there was an entrance with a radius of about 500 meters!

Around the entrance, there were thousands of people entering and exiting from inside!
