“Buzz!”

In front of the teleportation formation, an elder from the great sect of last month hurriedly entered and teleported towards the territory of the Dragon Python group.

In the next moment, he disappeared.

“I hope the experts of the Dragon Palace can come to my rescue quickly. If I had known that the Dragon Palace had a Type 9 powerhouse, I would have formed a good relationship with them in advance.”

The Great Sect Master of last month thought to himself with an ugly expression.

“Old Feng, hold on, hold on!”

He shouted loudly at the forefather of last month.

When the forefather heard that there were experts from the Dragon Palace, his eyes lit up with hope, and his desire to live increased.

“The Dragon Palace is in front, in front, that’s great!”

At the same time, in front of the Dragon Python group’s Planet Domain, the forefather of last month saw the huge dragon peak in the abyss, and his eyes lit up with excitement.

“Dragon King, request for backup, request for backup!”

He immediately flew into the Abyss and shouted loudly.

“Huh?”

When the experts and disciples of the Dragon Python group saw the great sect elder running over anxiously last month, they were astonished.

On the command platform, Wang Xian looked towards the voice and raised his eyebrows slightly.

“Dragon King, request for Dragon King to support our central region. Our sect leader and the rest can’t hold on much longer. As long as the Dragon Palace makes a move, our great sect last month will be eternally grateful. Dragon King, if you have any conditions, you can just say it!”

“Please make a move, please make a move!”

Last month, the elders of the great sect flew into the Abyss and saw the experts of the dragon palace killing the abyssal seeds one by one. When they saw Wang Xian, they immediately bowed and pleaded anxiously.

“Can’t hold on any longer?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and asked.

“It’s the Dragon King. Of the six abyssal seeds, three of them are trapping our sect leader and the rest. One of our ancestors is being besieged and can’t hold on for more than three minutes. Please make a move.”

“As long as you are willing to help us, Dragon King, the great sect will definitely reward you handsomely last month.” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Elder last month said hurriedly once again.

“That’s fine too. The rest of you in this area should go and support the ancient God dynasty. Leave the central area to our Dragon Palace.”

Wang Xian nodded his head faintly.

“Dragon King, I’m asking you and a group of experts to rush over through the teleportation formation. I’m afraid that our ancestors can’t Hold On!”

The great sect elder from last month said.

“Sure.”

Wang Xian looked into the Dragon Peak. “Ao Xingmu, ao Fenghuang, and Mu Zesen, the three of you will rush over through the teleportation formation with me.”

“Sky Formation, ride the Dragon Peak and rush over.”

“It’s the Dragon King!”

As he spoke, he immediately flew towards the teleportation formation. Ao Xingmu, Mu Zesen, and Ao fenghuang immediately followed behind.

The next moment, the four of them quickly arrived in front of the teleportation formation.

“What terrifying speed. The Dragon King is also an undying godly king level 9 powerhouse. The other three are as well!”

When elder Yue saw the speed of Wang Xian and the others last time, his face revealed shock and excitement.

He hurriedly followed behind.

Buzz

The five of them immediately arrived in front of the inviting Moon planet through the teleportation formation.

“I can’t hold on any longer. Hahaha, I didn’t expect that I, Yue Shang Feng, would actually die in the hands of these abyss seeds.”

When they just came out of the teleportation array, a voice was heard.

“Not good.”

Beside them, elder last month’s expression changed drastically.

“Damn Beasts!”

In the sky above the Abyss, the sect leader of last month and the two forefathers were attacking the abyss seeds in front of them, their faces filled with unwillingness.

However, the abyssal seeds in front of them were also resisting their attacks in a frenzy.

They didn’t even give them a chance to support them.

Below them, some of the experts and disciples looked over and their faces turned pale.

This was especially so for the disciples from the great sect from last month. This was their pillar of support from last month.

“Mou Zesen.”

Wang Xian looked over and moved his feet lightly. He flew straight into the abyss.

Ao Xingmu, Ao Kuang, Mou Zesen, and the rest followed beside him.

Buzz

...

Mou Zesen pulled the bowstring fully and locked his gaze on the surroundings of forefather shangyue.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

In an instant, three arrows vanished instantly and attacked a distance of more than 100 million kilometers away.

“Cough! Cough!”

In the sky above the Abyss, Elder Shangyue looked at the three level nine abyssal seeds in front of him with an extremely pale and despairing expression.

His arm had already disappeared, there was a fist sized hole in his chest.

The upper half of his body was only connected to the lower half of his body.

His appearance was extremely miserable.

Most importantly, there was energy within his body that was digesting his life force. He could already predict that the moment the three undying god King Level 9 seeds attacked him, it would be the moment he died.

“Howl Howl!”

“Ga Ga!”

...

The three level 9 abyssal seeds let out excited roars, the one in the middle extended its claw and attacked the great sect forefather from last month.

Seeing the attack of the abyssal seeds, he closed his eyes in despair.

“Sou Sou Sou!”

“Rumble Rumble Rumble!”

At this time, he heard a piercing sound, followed by a collision energy.

Under this wave of energy, his body flew backwards.

However, at this moment, a trace of hope and hope appeared in his eyes.

“It’s not too late.”

A voice sounded. He turned his head with difficulty and saw four vast figures flying towards him.

At this moment, his face revealed an extremely excited expression.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

When the abyssal seed that attacked saw that the attack was blocked, an angry roar was heard.

The two abyssal seeds on the side also revealed a fierce expression. They directly released a terrifying energy to attack the Patriarch of last month’s great sect once again.

“Hahaha, let our Dragon Palace come and meet you.”

A maniacal laughter rang out. A stream of energy came across the sky and began to block the abyssal seed’s attack.

At this moment, the Patriarch of the great sect of last month also sensed that he was enveloped by the energy of the Yin and yang poles.

His figure flew backward rapidly.

“I’m saved.”

Sensing that he was rapidly moving away from the three ninth-grade abyssal seeds, the Patriarch of the Great Sect of last month revealed an extremely excited expression.

He had survived a disaster.

“Thank you, Dragon King, for taking action. Thank you to all the powerhouses of the Dragon Palace for saving my life. I, Yue Shangfeng, swear that I will repay you with Gushing Springs. I, Yue Shangfeng, owe you all my life!”

Yue Shangfeng bowed respectfully to Wang Xian.

He was already in despair just now, but he didn’t expect the experts from the Dragon Palace to rush over and save him.

This favor was a gift of rebirth.

“Hahaha, thank you, Dragon King, for bringing all the experts from the Dragon Palace here. In the future, the Dragon Palace will be the benefactor of the great sect of last month!”

When the sect master of last month saw this scene, his eyes revealed an extremely excited expression.

He swept his gaze across Wang Xian and the rest. His heart was filled with surprise and gratitude as he shouted loudly.

“First, entangle these six abyssal seeds. Don’t let them escape.”

Wang Xian smiled faintly and said directly.

“Alright!”

The Chief of last month and the rest naturally had no objections to Wang Xian’s words!
