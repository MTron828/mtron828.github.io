Chapter 1652: 1652 nine God Demon God

“What? All the spiritual herbs in the six attribute herb gardens in the Heaven Herb Valley have disappeared!”

“Who did this? Who is targeting our life and Death Pill Workshop? The pills in Heaven City were stolen. Now, a quarter of the pills in the Heaven Herb Valley have been stolen. How can they not know who the opponent is?”

“How is this possible? Our Heaven Herb Valley is protected by a longevity-level array formation. Three half-step longevity-level grand elders are guarding it. How can a quarter of it be stolen?”

In a huge grassland, the valley and the plateau were fluctuating. Many powerful demon beasts were running on it.

In a flower garden beside a huge river, when the senior executives of the life and Death Pill Workshop received the news from the Heaven’s medicine valley, their faces revealed extremely ugly expressions.

In Fengtian City, their life and Death Pill Workshop had suffered heavy losses. However, they didn’t expect that something had actually happened in the Heaven’s medicine valley.

The loss of the Heaven Medicine Valley made them feel anger and fear.

The Heaven Medicine Valley was where their foundation lay. If they lost one point, it would be the loss of their own foundation.

However, from the beginning to the end, they did not know who their opponent was.

“Now, the medicine master has personally gone to the life and death medicinal pill workshop. Those who can barge into our heaven medicine mountain are at least half-step longevity experts!”

An old man said with a somewhat grave expression.

“It must be the fire cloud sparrow clan. It must be them!”

An old man dressed in white clothes growled with an ice-cold expression.

“Even if it wasn’t them who did it, it has a great relationship with them. Now that they’ve invited the Sacred Fire clan to come and help them, it’s very likely that they’ve also invited other experts that we don’t know of!”

In the center, a thin and weak old man holding a resplendent bamboo said faintly.

“The Sacred Fire clan clearly doesn’t want to go all out, but their deterrent force is still there. Some of the Phoenix dynasty’s mercenary groups and some experts have withdrawn a lot!”

An old woman frowned slightly.

“Hehe, the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan is indeed powerful. They were once the Empress’s personal guard group, but our life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop aren’t doing it for nothing. If they can invite people, We Can Too!”

The water tribe leader of the life and Death Pill Workshop, who was holding the bamboo, said faintly.

“Oh? Tribe leader, we have helpers too?”

The old woman was slightly taken aback as she hurriedly asked.

“It’s not like we are asking others to risk their lives for us. Naturally, there will be people who are willing to take action, especially those who are battle-hungry!”

The water tribe leader, who was holding the bamboo, smiled.

“Those who are battle-hungry, are they from the nine God Empire’s Demon God Tribe?”

The old woman was slightly stunned and quickly asked.

“The demon god of the nine gods!”

The chief of the water tribe with the green bamboo in his hand revealed a hint of coldness in his eyes.

...

“He’s gone! He’s gone!”

At this moment, at a location 50 kilometers away from the Heaven Herb Valley.

He had been squatting here for two days. The moment he saw the space tremble slightly, he hurriedly fled into the distance.

A Wanshou Master had arrived.

“What a pity!”

Two Wang Xian, who appeared 100 kilometers away in a flash, sighed.

He wanted to wait for the attack of the formation to stop. Now that a Wanshou Master had appeared, it would be troublesome if he wanted to enter the formation.

“When my strength reaches Wanshou, I must destroy the life and Death Elixir workshop and make a trip to the life and Death Elixir Garden!”

Wang Xian thought to himself as he flew in the direction of the fire Lark clan.

He was already very satisfied with his gains this time around.

If his strength increased by one level, he would be invincible under 10,000 years old. Next, he would bring the strange demon clan to massacre everyone.

It was time to enter the battlefield between the fire Lark clan and the two major forces.

Wang Xian flew at high speed and headed straight for the battlefield.

The increase in his strength had increased his speed by about five times.

Previously, his speed was 2,000 meters per second. Now, it was 10,000 meters per second. The range of teleportation had also increased to 50 kilometers.

Boom! Boom! Boom

Just as Wang Xian was flying, a terrifying aura suddenly came from the left.

A fiery red figure was approaching at a terrifying speed.

“Eh? A ferocious beast?”

Wang Xian looked over and revealed a curious expression.

“Keke Keke, catch the flaming soul and it. I didn’t expect our luck to be so good to meet a flaming soul!”

Then, at this moment, sounds of excitement could be heard from behind the flaming soul.

Five figures were flying over at a terrifying speed. Their target was the flaming soul.

Wang Xian’s gaze swept across them and finally landed on the fiery soul they were talking about.

“Eh? What pure fiery energy. This is similar to the soul of Darkness!”

Looking at the fiery soul, Wang Xian’s face was filled with astonishment.

The Soul of darkness was formed from strong dark energy. This fiery soul was formed from fiery energy.

Wang Xian could make the five elements grind to absorb this energy.

“Roar!”

When the soul of fire saw Wang Xian, who was right in front of him, his eyes revealed a look of panic and anger.

He spat out flames from his mouth and attacked from a distance of 10,000 meters away.

“There’s someone in front!”

“Keke, there’s an unlucky fellow. He can help us defend for one second!”

Strange cries came from behind. Five figures were approaching quickly.

“My Luck is really good!”

Wang Xian looked at the flaming soul of the ninth level of the void interpretation stage. A Yin-yang tai chi pattern appeared around his body.

When the Flames landed on it, they were easily blocked.

Wang Xian waved his arm and transformed it into a dragon claw. He clawed at the Flaming Soul.

“Confine!”

He let out a soft cry. The gray energy trapped the flaming soul directly.

The Dragon Claw, which was more than ten meters in size, grabbed the flaming soul directly. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Roar! Roar!”

The Flaming Soul looked at Wang Xian with a look of horror in its eyes.

“What?”

“How is this possible?”

Exclamations came out from the mouths of the five elders. They widened their eyes and revealed a hint of shock and fear on their faces.

He was able to grab the flaming soul of the ninth level of the Seethrough realm in one move?

Such strength...

“What a pure flame. A Fire Phoenix Dragon Seed of the first level of the Seethrough realm can absorb it and reach the eighth level of the Seethrough realm in one leap!”

Wang Xian ignored the five elders. He looked at the flame soul in his hand and revealed a look of surprise.

“This... senior, we are from the demon God tribe of the nine God Empire. The flame soul in your hand is our prey!”

The five elders saw that Wang Xian ignored them. They looked at each other, gritted their teeth, and said indignantly.

This flaming soul was a priceless treasure!

“I caught it now!”

Wang Xian grabbed the flaming soul and glanced at it indifferently.

“We are the demon God tribe. Please give us some face, senior!”

The five old men’s faces changed. With a dark expression, they took out their names again.

One of the nine gods, the Demon God!

“You talk too much nonsense!”

Wang Xian waved his arm and five grayish hand seals attacked them directly.

“What? You Dare to attack us?”

The five of them had a drastic change in expression.

“Bang!”

However, before he could resist, the palm landed on their bodies. The powerful force caused them to fly backward at an even faster speed.

Fresh blood flew out from their mouths.
