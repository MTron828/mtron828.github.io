Chapter 936: 0937 Bridge Forest Beast Park 2

Translator: 549690339

“Commander Wang, we have a total of 25 people and five carriages. Due to the urgency of time, we need to cross the Bridge Forest Beast Park!”

“The Bridge Forest Beast Park is a very dangerous area. If we cross it directly, there is a high chance of encountering a supernatural tier-6 ferocious beast. If we are unlucky, we might even encounter a supernatural tier-7 ferocious beast!”

A middle-aged man from the bridge forest business association said to Wang Xian after coming out of the Employment Association.

Wang Xian nodded his head slowly. “Don’t worry. Leave the safety issue to us. I guarantee that we will send all of you to bridge forest town safely!”

He said with confidence. With the current strength of Wang Xian and the rest, they could deal with even a level eight supernatural beast, let alone a level six supernatural beast.

“That’s Good!”

The middle-aged man nodded and the group came to a restaurant.

In front of the restaurant, five carriages had been prepared. The group was already getting ready in the carriages.

“Brother Feng, have you hired the mercenary group?”

A woman in the middle got down from an extremely luxurious carriage and said to the middle-aged man.

“We’ve found them. Let’s set off immediately!”

The young man nodded and said.

“You’ve found them? That’s Great!”

The Lady said with a smile on her face. She looked at Wang Xian and the rest and saw a slight difference in Wang Xian. “It can’t be them, right?”

“Yes, they are very famous in Shenghai town. They are known as the number one mercenary group. There shouldn’t be a problem!”

The young man nodded.

“There should be no problem? We are passing through the Bridge Forest Beast Park!”

The girl slightly pouted.

“The reputation is well deserved. There should be no problem with this mercenary group!”

The young man also said with uncertainty.

He did not dare to imagine that such a young man was actually the leader of the strongest mercenary group in Holy Sea Town.

“Young master, we are about to set off. We have to hurry!”

At this moment, a middle-aged man’s voice was heard.

“Alright, let’s Go!”

The young man nodded and boarded the girl’s carriage.

“Leader Wang, thank you for your trouble!”

A middle-aged man said to Wang Xian.

“Don’t worry, let’s set off!”

Wang Xian nodded and said to him.

“Alright!”

The carriage set off from the west gate and headed outside.

Wang Xian, Ao Jian, and the rest sat at the front and back as well as on the central carriage. They looked relaxed.

“Captain Wang, we have already left the city. Do We need your members to stand guard in front of us?”

After leaving Shenghai town, they entered the wild. There was no safe zone in the wild.

Even if it was a road that was frequently taken by people, if they were unlucky, they might encounter ferocious beasts that were at level eight or nine of the extraordinary. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Therefore, once they were out of the city, the mercenary group had to be on alert.

After they were out of Shenghai town, a middle-aged man from the Qiuling Chamber of commerce frowned and asked Wang Xian.

“Everyone, please rest assured. We will guarantee that everyone will enter qiuling town safely and escort them. We have our own arrangements!”

Wang Xian said confidently.

Ao Yao and the rest were already on alert in the surroundings. They would be able to react in time if they were to encounter any danger.

Furthermore, if there were ferocious beasts in the surroundings, Ao Yao and the rest would be able to handle them easily.

They would only be in danger if they were to encounter those extraordinary level nine ferocious beasts.

“As long as commander Wang understands!”

The middle-aged man frowned when he heard Wang Xian’s words. His expression didn’t look too good.

However, he couldn’t say anything. After all, he had to rely on the other party’s protection.

He exchanged glances with the other four middle-aged men. Their expressions didn’t look too good.

Wang Xian’s feeling made them feel that they weren’t reliable.

The horse carriage drove at a fast speed.

The horse was a stallion with a burly body that was at least three meters tall. The strength of the stallion had reached the level of immortals and gods on Earth. It could run for two days and two nights.

The horse carriage traveled at a fast speed and did not encounter any ferocious beasts along the way.

It should be said that Ao Yao and the rest had cleared out all the ferocious beasts in front of them.

“Our luck is really good. We actually didn’t encounter any ferocious beasts along the way!”

After traveling for five hours, the four middle-aged men looked at each other and said in astonishment.

“The Bridge Forest Beast Park is ahead. Let’s stop and have some food before charging through the Bridge Forest Beast Park in one Go!”

When they arrived at the front of a forest, a middle-aged man said to Wang Xian and the rest.

“Sure!”

Wang Xian said nonchalantly.

The five carriages stopped and everyone took out their food.

With the interspatial ring, food was very easy to carry for the powerhouses of the supernatural continent.

“The Bridge Forest Beast Park is right in front of us. There are many dangers in there. We have to be more vigilant!”

The young man got down from the carriage and said to the young man beside him.

“With brother Feng around, I’m not afraid of anything!”

The girl said to the young man with a bright smile.

“Don’t worry, I’m Here!”

The young man nodded proudly and looked at Wang Xian and the rest.

“The Bridge Forest Beast Park?”

Wang Xian looked at the location in front of him. Every tree was a few hundred meters tall and their branches and leaves were very lush. It was afternoon and there were only a few rays of light inside!

“Commander Wang, it’s not a wise choice to stay in the Qiulin Beast Park. We need to break out of here in one go.”

“Tomorrow night, we can pass through the entire Qiulin Beast Park. During this period, I hope commander Wang and the rest of you can cheer up!”

A middle-aged man walked to Wang Xian’s side and said solemnly.

“You can rest in the carriage. Leave the rest to us!”

Wang Xian said indifferently.

“Alright, we’ll leave it to captain Wang then!”

The middle-aged man nodded and looked at Wang Xian. He wanted to say something but didn’t say it out loud.

“Let’s Go!”

After more than ten minutes, the group set off again and entered the Bridge Forest Beast Park which was like an abyss.

There was a type of black weed growing at the bottom of the Bridge Forest Beast Park. It looked a little strange.

The depth of the weed was even one meter deep.

It was also because of this that the mercenary group that lacked strength would definitely not dare to step into the Bridge Forest Beast Park.

“Commander Wang, Don’t you want to let your men guard the surroundings? This is not a flat land!”

After entering the Bridge Forest Beast Park, a few middle-aged men saw that Wang Xian and the rest were still standing on the horse carriage. They asked with an ugly expression.

Their eyes were cold!

If they were to say that they didn’t enter the Bridge Forest Beast Park and were so careless, they wouldn’t be able to say anything.

However, if they were still so careless after entering the Bridge Forest Beast Park, they would be courting death.

Once upon a time, a gold mercenary group was wiped out in the Bridge Forest Beast Park.

That gold mercenary group had the strength of three level 6 transcendents, but they were still wiped out.

Now, they actually dared to be so careless. They were simply courting death.

This was hard for them to endure.

No matter how awesome you were in Holy Sea Town, you can’t be so careless, right?

How could such a careless mercenary group survive till now?

You’re courting death, we don’t want to die!
