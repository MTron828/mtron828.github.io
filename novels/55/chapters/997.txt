Chapter 998: 0999, the amethyst mercenary group made their move

Translator: 5496903

“Bang!”

“I think you’re really asking for it. Kid, you’ve offended too many people. Get the hell out of Here!”

With a loud bang, the leader of the tornado mercenary group slammed his palm on the table. He stared at Wang Xian coldly and shouted loudly.

The commotion here immediately aroused the curiosity of the other students. Everyone looked over curiously.

“Student Wang Xian, our regiment commander has already told you to SCRAM. Why are you still sitting here?”

Duan Qingwen’s lips curled up slightly. He looked at Duan Qingwen with a mocking expression as he spoke loudly.

“Wang Xian?”

“Which Wang Xian? The new Wang Xian?”

“No way! How did he come here?”

When the crowd heard Duan Qingwen’s words, they were stunned.

Some of them walked over with curious expressions.

They had heard a lot about Wang Xian during this period of time, but they had never seen him in person.

They wanted to see who was the person who dared to provoke the young master’s mercenary group so recklessly.

“You want me to Scram? What right do you have!”

A hint of killing intent flashed in Wang Xian’s eyes. He stood up coldly and glanced at the people from the tornado mercenary group. He paused on Duan Qingwen.

“You...”

Duan Qingwen felt a chill in his heart when he saw Wang Xian staring at him. Following that, he glared at Wang Xian furiously.

“Qualifications? Kid, I don’t care how you managed to sneak in. Leave us now. Otherwise, our tornado mercenary group will let you know what qualifications are!”

The leader of the tornado mercenary group stared at Wang Xian with a threatening look.

They were not afraid of this new student. Even if this kid had severed the arms of an extraordinary level four powerhouse, his strength was extraordinary.

However, he was still far from being comparable to them.

“Oh? Then I would like to see your qualifications!”

Wang Xian sneered as he stared at the members of the tornado mercenary group.

“This is the new student, Wang Xian? He’s a little arrogant!”

“Yeah, he’s really arrogant. He actually dared to challenge the tornado mercenary group. The tornado mercenary group is not weak at all!”

“He even dared to offend the young master’s mercenary group, not to mention that he has gone crazy. In my opinion, he’s courting death!”

When the people around saw Wang Xian, they started to discuss among themselves.

They didn’t try to hide anything because they didn’t put Wang Xian in their eyes.

What ability did a freshman have?

“Good, good. Arrogant Fellow, I don’t know how you survived until today. But let me tell you, don’t let us meet you in the wild in the future!”

When Captain Tornado saw the people around him looking at him, he instantly felt dispirited. He glared at Wang Xian and said.

“Haha, this Wang Xian has angered tornado and the rest again. He’s totally courting death!”

“Exactly. I really wonder how he survived until today!”

“I wonder how this kid got in here? who invited him so recklessly? Could it be that he came in by himself?”

When the surrounding students saw Wang Xian’s appearance, they felt extremely arrogant. All of them shook their heads and said with smiles on their faces.

“So what if we met in the wild?”

At this moment, a girl suddenly came over.

Everyone was slightly taken aback. Upon hearing the familiar voice, they quickly looked towards the entrance.

About twenty girls walked over.

The leader was a blonde beauty who was taller than most of the boys present.

Her figure and height made many of the boys feel ashamed.

The one who spoke was a burly girl beside her.

“Captain Zhang, deputy captain Xiao!”

The captain of the tornado mercenary group was stunned for a moment before he greeted Wang Xian with a smile.

“If I were to meet this kid in the wild, I guarantee that he will regret coming to this world. HMPH, what an arrogant and reckless fellow!”

The captain of the tornado mercenary group said with a smile on his face. His gaze landed on Wang Xian and was filled with coldness.

The faces of the girls in the amethyst mercenary group darkened immediately when they heard his words.

Especially vice-captain Xiao, who walked straight towards Captain Tornado with a frosty expression.

Currently, Captain Tornado had yet to figure out the current situation. He only knew that Wang Xian had provoked the amethyst mercenary group, but he didn’t know what happened on the Thunder Island.

When he saw vice-captain Xiao walking over, he still had a smile on his face. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Bam

However, his expression quickly turned stiff because deputy captain Xiao’s fist landed heavily on his face.

He didn’t show any mercy.

The body of the captain of the tornado mercenary group flew backward heavily. A few of his teeth flew out.

“In the future, as long as the amethyst mercenary group lets us see you in the wild, we will make you regret coming to this world!”

Deputy Chief Xiao said to the tornado mercenary group with a cold expression.

He was stunned!

Everyone around him looked at this scene in astonishment.

“This... why did deputy chief Xiao suddenly hit chief tornado and say such words?”

“What’s going on? Doesn’t the amethyst mercenary group have a feud with that Wang Xian? Why would they speak up for him?”

Deputy Chief Xiao, who had a stunned expression on his face, was stunned. Even chief tornado, who was knocked down on the ground, was stunned.

The members of the tornado mercenary group looked on at a loss.

“Student Wang, leave their tornado mercenary group to us. We will definitely let them know the price for offending you!”

Vice-captain Xiao glanced at the tornado mercenary group coldly. He turned around and said to Wang Xian.

“Student Wang Xian, thank you for the incident on the Thunder Island!”

Zhang Yitian walked over as well. He sized up Wang Xian curiously and said with a smile on his face.

“What... What exactly is going on?”

A young man mumbled in a low voice as he looked at Wang Xian in disbelief.

The deputy captain of the amethyst mercenary group took action personally to vent his anger for the new student.

Captain Zhang Yitian walked over with a smile on his face again and spoke politely.

Didn’t this guy have a grudge against amethyst? Why Now?

Wang Xian looked at the tall and beautiful lady who was walking over with a hint of surprise in his eyes. He nodded his head faintly.

Zhang Yitian smiled and looked at the members of the tornado mercenary group around him. The smile on his face disappeared and he shouted coldly, “Scram!”

Scram!

When they heard the captain of the amethyst mercenary group telling them to scram, the members of the tornado mercenary group trembled.

“Leader Zhang, I’m sorry, I’m sorry. Let’s Scram. We’ll scram immediately!”

The vice-leader of Tornado said loudly and walked to the side with an extremely embarrassed expression.

The people around swallowed a mouthful of saliva and looked at each other. Their eyes were filled with shock.

Why did that freshman Wang Xian have such a good relationship with the amethyst mercenary group?

“Peng Peng!”

Duan Qingwen stood up with a trembling body. He staggered and bumped into the chair with a look of horror on his face.

He had joined the tornado mercenary group and thought that he had a backer.

However, he didn’t expect that he would actually be listed in the amethyst mercenary group.

Would he take revenge on him?

Thinking of this, his body almost fell to the ground again.

Compared to the amethyst mercenary group, the tornado mercenary group was on a completely different level!

In the future, he would be in deep trouble!
