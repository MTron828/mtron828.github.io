Chapter 457: The Battle Of The Ages (3)

Splash!

Fine rain sprinkled down.

The group of Qiao Clan came to the seaside and stood there while the surroundings plunged into silence. Everyone watched them with horror in their eyes.

“Too strong!” a young man remarked with awe and dodgy eyes.

“Have the people from Medical Saint Sect arrived yet?” a formidable elder from Qiao Clan looked around and asked in a deep voice.

“They’re here!”

The old man looked behind him. In green and red uniforms, the group of Medical Saint Sect experts was flitting in their direction.

Two elders were traveling in the sky.

The way they traveled was not comparable to any of those Inborn Experts who could only flit in the air temporarily.

They were hovering in the air for real, just like birds gliding in the air.

On top of that, their speed in the air was not any slower than on land.

In the realm above Inborn Realm, Dan Realm Experts could fly in the sky.

This was another important hallmark of Dan Realm Experts.

“What? Two Dan Realm Experts?”

“They are the Supreme Elders of Medical Saint Sect, from Hua Family and Laozu from Bian Family!”

“Sss, the real unparalleled experts, unparalleled experts!”

“The Laozu of Qiao Clan is also from the same realm. There are three unparalleled experts!”

The crowd watched the Supreme Elders of Medical Saint Sect in the air with disbelief.

Some of the elders within Qiao Clan looked over with appalling looks and flickering eyes.

“The Medical Saint Sect lives up to their name. They have two unparalleled experts who are simply compelling!”

“Medical Saint Sect also brought forty Inborn Experts here. That’s great. Now that they have ninety Inborn Experts, it will be a breeze to annihilate Dragon Sect. We might not even have many losses!”

“Three unparalleled experts. Even though the Dragon King is also an unparalleled expert, he will perish under the joint attack of three equivalent-leveled experts!”

The people from seven forces, including Wu Family, had thrills flushing in their eyes. With so many experts around, what was there to be afraid of?

“Old Hua, Old Bian, since we’re all here, let’s go!”

Laozu of Qiao Clan was not surprised by the two unparalleled experts of Medical Saint Sect. The two strong families, Hua’s and Bian’s, had been two Sacred Clans since a long time ago. The two families had too many casualties such that they joined hands to establish the Medical Saint Sect.

Hence, it was not surprising to have two unparalleled experts in Medical Saint Sect.

“Let’s go. We’ll eliminate that brazen brat today. Medical Saint Sect has not struck for the past fifty years. Today, we’re out for some fresh air!”

An old man revealed a faint smile on his face.

“Haha, let’s go. We shall see what is backing this insolent brat. Haha!”

Laozu of Qiao Clan chortled and ascended to the air, exuding terrifying might.

“Let’s go. I’ll let the people in the Underworld know today that no one lives after killing the disciples of Medical Saint Sect!” the old man from Medical Saint Sect exclaimed softly. Though it was soft, the voice traveled to miles away.

The three unparalleled experts took to the air and flitted towards the island in the sea.

The disciples of Medical Saint Sect, Qiao Clan, and the remaining seven forces left and were on the heels of them.

But, they set their foot on the surface of the water and flitted ahead at a rapid speed.

“They are simply compelling. Is this the strength of two Sacred Sects?”

“With close to hundreds of Inborn Experts, who else can’t they annihilate?”

“The Dragon Sect and Dragon King are finished this time since there are so many Inborn Experts from Medical Saint Sect and Qiao Clan. Not to mention the three unparalleled experts!”

The crowd at the beach watched as horror filled their faces.

“That arrogant brat, get out, and accept your doom!”

Just then, they heard an indignant, mighty bellow coming from a far distance.

“I think we can check on the bodies of the Dragon Sect later on!”

“There’s no doubt about it. Three unparalleled experts that can overturn anything!”

“Let’s quickly place our bets on the Underworld forum. Given the combined strength of Medical Saint Sect and Qiao Clan, annihilating a Dragon Sect is just a piece of cake,” the crowd exclaimed loudly at the seaside.

Meanwhile, news about the battle of Sacred Sects in Rivertown was updated on the Underworld forum.

[Three unparalleled experts are leading over ninety Inborn Experts to annihilate Sacred Sect!]

[Dragon King of Dragon Sect cannot be brazen anymore. How dare he proclaim he’ll be able to annihilate Medical Saint Sect and Qiao Clan. Hehe, they can forget about a Pilgrimage since they will soon be finished!”

Many people were gloating over the misfortune on the Underworld forum as they watched.

Countless people from the Underworld were extremely jealous of a twenty-year-old young man establishing the Dragon Sect. Seeing that the Dragon Sect and Dragon King were about to be annihilated, many people clapped their hands in celebration. Dare you to be insolent!

“Unfortunately, we’re unable to watch what is going on inside. It’s a battle of the unparalleled experts!”

A young man sighed as he looked out to the sea.

“Let’s go. Don’t make any moves unless necessary!” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Just then, the crowd at the beach witnessed a score of people flitting towards the island in the sea.

All of them were slightly stunned as they revealed shocking looks on their faces.

“All of them are Inborn Experts. Look at their clothes. They are Sacred Clan, Sacred Clan!”

“What? Which Sacred Clan? What are they doing by heading out to the island now?”

“Sui Clan of Shang Jing. Those are from the Sui Clan. Gosh, they went over!”

“Could the Sui Clan be on the same side as Medical Saint Sect and Qiao Clan? No, if that’s the case, they should have left together with the Medical Saint Sect. Could it be...?”

“What’s the situation now? Is another Sacred Clan involved?”

All of them were slightly stunned when they saw a score of Inborn Experts flitting towards the island. Everyone was petrified.

Another Sacred Clan is involved, and they could be here to assist the Dragon Sect.

“If they were here to assist Dragon Sect, the stakes are getting higher for this battle.”

“Four Saint-class forces involved, that’s too scary...”

Everyone was shocked.

“Here comes another mighty force!”

At this time, another exclamation came from the side while all turned around immediately.

An old man, followed by a juvenile alongside him.

That juvenile looked very young, with a longsword in his hand.

A group of people was trailing behind them.

“How dare someone try to kill my master. Tired of living!”

Just then, the juvenile at the front let out a cold bellow. With a swift movement, he flitted to the island in the sea, while the old man beside him was hovering in the air.

The various experts on their heels gave off domineering oppression.

“This, this....”

All the people were shocked by what they saw, especially when they noticed the huge word “Xiao” on their clothing. Their eyes were wide.

Xiao Clan, Shang Jing.

“Another Sacred Clan. This is the fifth Saint-class forces. Gosh, is this going to be the battle of the century?”

“The juvenile at the forefront is Xiao Ran. He’s the youngest Inborn Expert now. The mighty, young Clan Leader of Xiao Clan!”
