Chapter 3886: The 3885 belief universe army retreated! Get Down

Translator: 549690339

“Retreat, retreat immediately! ”

“All Disciples of the belief universe, Retreat! ”

In front of the Giant Star City, the terrifying army of the belief universe shook the sky.

The Sky and earth changed color, the starry sky changed color!

In the Giant Star City, all the powerful disciples had solemn expressions on their faces.

Even if they knew that the giant star city was extremely powerful, looking at the terrifying army of the belief universe, they didn’t have 100% confidence.

What if the belief universe took out an even bigger trump card?

However, just when all the powerful disciples of the 9-essences universe thought that a great war was about to break out, all the tier 7 gods in the belief universe suddenly roared loudly!

They actually gave the order to retreat!

When all the powerful disciples of 9-essences heard this order, they were slightly stunned, their faces filled with astonishment.

What was going on?

Was it intentional?

“What’s going on?”

“Don’t Know? Is it their scheme?”

Some great beings of peak races couldn’t help but shout in a low voice!

“What? Sir, why did you suddenly retreat?”

“What’s going on?”

Not only were all the great beings and disciples of the 9-origin universe in a daze, even the gods and believers who believed in the universe were also in a

Daze!

What was going on?

The Aura had already risen. Why was it suddenly going to retreat?

A Tier 6 God couldn’t help but ask!

Something has happened to the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace. Retreat immediately! ”

A Tier 7 god replied and ordered loudly again!

Something has happened to the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace?”

All the gods and believers who believed in the universe trembled violently when they heard this.

Something happened to the Dragon Palace’s Dragon King?

What did this mean?

This meant that the experts who were chasing after the Dragon Palace’s Dragon King had been killed by the Dragon Palace’s Dragon King! In order to deal with the Dragon Palace’s Dragon King, they had used the fragments of the Heavenly Yuan creation treasure!

This represented the strongest combat strength of the belief universe!

However, something still happened!

This also meant that the Dragon Palace’s Dragon King’s strength was probably not something that the belief universe could contend against!

This meant that the Dragon Palace could slaughter the universe they believed in and their legions!

“How is this possible?”

Some of the rank six gods couldn’t help but growl!

The Aura on their bodies began to rapidly decrease.

At this moment, the rank seven gods roared and immediately turned to leave!

They knew even more how serious this matter was!

The Dragon Palace’s ancient god Feeding Kun Lord was already comparable to the peak gods!

Moreover, he had two such levels of combat strength!

If they were to hunt them down, even if all the legions of the twenty-one palaces joined forces, they wouldn’t be a match for them.

One had to know that the Dragon Palace’s Dragon King himself was extremely terrifying!

Once they were intercepted by the Dragon Palace’s Dragon King, they believed in the twenty-one legions of the universe. It would already be pretty good if a million of them could survive!

Now, before the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace could react, they had to escape first, and they had to split up to escape!

Then, a scene that shocked all the disciples of the experts of the 9-origin universe appeared!

The 21 legions of the belief universe, more than 20 million gods and believers, quickly flew into the distance.

No, this wasn’t flying away, it was more like escaping!

Each of their faces were filled with anxiety.

“They have received the order from the experts above, or else they wouldn’t have retreated! ”

In front of the city wall, a master at level seven couldn’t help but say.

“I think I heard a level seven God say that something happened to the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace. ”

A wind god Tiger at level seven opened his mouth and said.

This was what he vaguely heard!

“Yes, something has happened to the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace. The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace has been in trouble, causing the entire army of their belief universe to retreat. What has happened? What has the Dragon

King done to their belief universe?”

On the side of the Elf clan, a great elf at the seventh level also nodded.

Not only did the experts of the Divine Tiger clan hear it, but other experts at the seventh level also heard it.

As they spoke, their faces were filled with shock.

Something had happened to the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace!

In the end, the 21 extremely terrifying armies of the belief universe, as well as over 20 million gods and believers, fled.

How terrifying was this?

What terrifying thing had the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace done?

The words of the few level 7 sovereign realm experts were not concealed at all, allowing all the experts and disciples behind to hear them clearly.

They looked at the disappearing figures of the army of the belief universe and watched as they fled, and each of them gulped.

After a few seconds of silence, there was an uproar.

“Oh my God, what did the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace do to make the Army of the belief universe flee?” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“This is unbelievable. Something happened to the Dragon King of the Dragon

Palace, and they fled. What did the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace Do?”

“There are experts in the belief universe who trapped the Dragon King with the fragments of the Heavenly Yuan creation. Could they have been killed by the Dragon King?”

“That’s very possible. The Dragon King must have shown his terrifying strength. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have run away. Hiss, how strong are the

Dragon King and the others?”

The shocked discussions were heard.

Everyone’s faces were full of shock, and some of the experts’ disciples showed a hint of respect and worship.

This terrifying battle that was about to erupt ended because of the Dragon King!

The belief universe army that was even more powerful than their 9 -origin universe had actually escaped!

This was simply unbelievable!

This caused them to feel reverence towards the Dragon King!

Was this the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace?

Using his own strength to fight against the entire belief universe was simply terrifying!

“How is this possible?”

The Phoenix clan and the Angel clan were also stunned!

Just because something happened to the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace, the Army of the belief universe immediately fled!

This scene made them feel extremely absurd.

A Dragon King actually scared the entire army of the belief universe away.

Then, how terrifying was the Dragon King and the others?

Especially the Phoenix clan, all the strong disciples were stunned.

They had just provoked the Dragon Palace, and now this had happened? The more powerful the dragon palace became, the worse the news was for them.

They even hoped that a great battle could break out.

They hoped that the Dragon Palace Dragon King would be killed by the belief universe’s strong people!

But Now? ?

The current Dragon Palace Dragon King seemed to be abnormally terrifying, and it wasn’t something the Phoenix clan could contend against!

At least here in the starry universe, they were completely unable to compete with the Dragon Palace!
