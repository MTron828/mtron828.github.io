The Thunder Light Race’s recruitment of disciples was a grand event in the surrounding area.

Especially for the living beings in the Thunder Cloud region.

In this Thunder Cloud region, the most powerful race was the Thunder Cloud race, followed by a few cities like Heavenly Thunder City.

However, compared to the Thunder Cloud Race, Heavenly Thunder City still had a huge gap in strength and inheritance.

Not to mention the other creatures in the Thunder Cloud region, there were still around 50 to 60 billion.

Especially because this region was very suitable for thunder attribute experts to cultivate, many thunder attribute experts came here to cultivate.

Every time the Thunder Light Tribe recruited disciples, many people would come.

After all, compared to being free and unfettered, having a powerful backer also had many benefits.

There were also many residents living in the Heavenly Thunder City who wished for their children to join the Lightning race.

“Hurry, Hurry, there are still more than ten minutes before the start. I hope I can pass the assessment this time!”

“The minimum strength requirement was at the fourth level void God Emperor last time. I wonder what the minimum strength requirement is this time?”

“This doesn’t just depend on the minimum strength. It also depends on your bloodline and physique. Those who can’t fight two levels above you will probably be eliminated!”

Ten days later, Wang Xian arrived at the selection venue of the Thunder Ray race’s disciples. At this moment, a large number of people had gathered around.

Some young men walked towards the huge venue in front of them. There were more than ten million people in the entire square.

In the surroundings, there were various spaceships or experts floating on treasures, waiting for their children’s test in anticipation.

Wang Xian looked at the arena and at a stone at the entrance.

There were rings of growth rings on that stone. It looked very mystical.

“You are over twenty epochs old. Get Out Now!”

At this moment, he saw a young man walking in. However, when he passed by the stone, the growth rings on the stone were glowing.

A middle-aged man sitting by the side locked his gaze on the young man and coldly warned him.

“Sir, I was only in closed-door cultivation and missed the last disciple recruitment. My strength is strong enough!”

The young man’s expression changed drastically and he immediately explained.

“Get out. If you are older than your age and want to join My Thunder Ray race, you will have to go to the Thunder Cloud to pass the trial.”

“This…”

This caused the young man’s expression to change drastically. When he saw that many people were staring at him, he left dejectedly.

Wang Xian swept his gaze across the crowd and walked straight in.

The recruitment of disciples by any tribe did not require all the strong ones.

Compared to the strong ones, they valued loyalty and potential more.

This was also to prevent other factions from infiltrating their tribe. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

By recruiting younger disciples, they could cultivate loyalty and pass all sorts of tests to test their loyalty.

However, for some older ones who suddenly appeared to join their race, they would basically not agree.

Even if they agreed, they would not place them in an important position.

When Wang Xian entered, the stone with the growth rings did not show any reaction. Clearly, he had passed the test.

He scanned the surroundings and revealed a smile on his face.

With a glance, he saw the strongest level eight void God Emperor.

In fact, to be able to reach level eight void God emperor after cultivating for less than two million years was already very impressive.

This required one to have a strong bloodline, or a strong physique, as well as a strong inheritance.

If these people were placed on the side of Lu Xing Kong, they would all be rare geniuses that had been around for billions of years.

However, this place was different from the side of Lu Xingkong. Any random person from this side would be able to fight against those of a higher level.

There were also many people who fought against those who were two levels higher.

Even those who fought against those who were three levels higher were not that rare.

After all, this was the center of the universe, the center of the heaven splitting chaotic land.

Many disciples from the various peak races were able to fight against those who were three levels higher.

Wang Xian stood in the middle of the square and waited quietly.

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz

Not long after, more than a dozen figures appeared in a teleportation formation in front of the square.

These figures had a pair of wings on their backs. Their noses were a little sharp and their bodies were about two meters tall.

The arrival of more than a dozen experts from the lightning race shocked the entire square.

“The assessment is about to begin. This time, there is no minimum limit to one’s strength. All aspects of the assessment include potential, comprehension of the lightning attribute, and strength!”

The middle-aged man in the center looked down sharply at all the disciples participating in the assessment and said directly.

“This is a chance for us!”

“We must succeed!”

Some of the participants had looks of joy on their faces as they clenched their fists tightly.

Buzz

At the next moment, the leader of the Lightning race waved his arm. A Thundercloud appeared in the sky and enveloped everyone.

Wang Xian raised his head. His eyes were sparkling.

This was an acquired treasure.

“Let the assessment begin.”

As the leader of the middle-aged men finished his sentence, bolts of lightning descended from the sky.

A bolt of lightning landed on Wang Xian’s body, but there was no reaction from him at all.

“Ahhhh!”

However, screams of pain rang out continuously in the surroundings.

One by one, the young men who screamed and fell to the ground were directly sent out with a wave of the arm of the Lightning Race’s powerhouse.

“Crackle crackle!”

Five seconds later, another bolt of lightning landed on Wang Xian’s body. The power of this little bit of lightning was about the same as his scraping.

However, this time, another batch of people fell.

The third round continued until the fifth round. There were only about a thousand people in the arena.

At this moment, apart from Wang Xian, everyone else was in a sorry state.

“Eh?”

Wang Xian stood there without changing his expression. He attracted the attention of the experts from the Lightning race ahead. They were astonished.

Around them, some of the examinees were also looking at Wang Xian in shock.

“Good, not bad. The 1,103 of you have passed the test. You can join the outer sect of our lightning race. Follow us now. There are also some simple tests.”

More than a dozen experts from the lightning race looked satisfied as they spoke to them.

“Follow us into the teleportation formation!”

More than a dozen experts of the Lightning race immediately entered the teleportation formation and disappeared.

“Let’s go, Let’s Go!”

More than a thousand disciples who passed the assessment followed behind with excited faces as they teleported through the teleportation formation.

Buzz

When Wang Xian entered the teleportation formation, he immediately felt the surroundings changing.

The power in front of him was a palace. The entire palace was suspended in a thundercloud.

They were on a high platform in front of the palace.

There were quite a number of disciples from the Lightning race in the surroundings. There were tens of thousands of them.

When Wang Xian arrived here, a strong attractive force was felt.

His eyes flashed with a hint of heat. He immediately looked towards the front.

In the middle of the front, an elder from the lightning race was sitting there.

That familiar feeling came from the position of the old man’s wings.

Lei Yu was there.
