The young master of the night clan. Even if some people had never seen him before, they had heard of him before.

Now that they saw that he seemed to have gotten into a conflict with someone, their faces were filled with astonishment.

Who would dare to offend the young master of the Night Clan?

“Who is that young man?”

“I don’t know him. He’s a little unfamiliar. Is he a disciple of the imperial court?”

“Even an ordinary disciple of the imperial court wouldn’t dare to offend the young master of the night clan, right?”

Some of them looked at Wang Xian with a curious expression.

“Eh? Wang Xian?”

“Dragon King, he...”

At the side, the Imperial Star Lady and the rest were stunned when they saw the situation here.

The imperial star Lady’s gaze swept across young Emperor Ye. She frowned slightly and walked over hurriedly.

“This is the hero gathering organized by the powerhouses of the imperial court. I don’t want to cause trouble here, but no one else can provoke me either. That venomous member already belongs to my subordinates. Send him over immediately. Otherwise, Hehe.”

Young Emperor Ye saw that he had attracted the attention of the surrounding people. He raised his eyebrows slightly and stared at Wang Xian as he warned him.

At the same time, he also told the surrounding powerhouses of the imperial court that it was not young emperor ye who was causing trouble here, but someone was snatching his men.

“Or else what? A Kid who hasn’t even reached the level of godly king dares to say such words to my master?”

However, just as he finished his sentence, a bone-chilling voice rang out.

Young Emperor Ye felt a chill down his spine as cold air gushed out from the bottom of his heart.

“Who is it?”

The two middle-aged men beside him changed their expressions and immediately looked to the side.

“Eh? Bei Shuang, you’re here too?”

However, Wang Xian heard this voice from the side. He looked to the side and asked with a smile.

“Yes, master. I plan to come here to gain some experience and obtain some treasures.”

Bei Shuang walked over and said to Wang Xian.

After she finished speaking, she looked at Ye Shaohuang who was at the side and said, “A trash who only relies on his family dares to provoke a powerhouse? Aren’t you afraid of Death?”

“You... You’re courting death. Who Are You?”

When ye Shaohuang heard bei Shuang’s words, he was instantly enraged.

“This is the frost goddess, that girl is the Frost Goddess.”

“That’s right, it’s her, the one who once suppressed an entire generation. A few years ago, after taking the Dragon King as her master, she rose to power. She’s only 30,000 years old and already has the strength of an undying level 8, extremely powerful.”

“That Frost Goddess just called that youth her master, doesn’t that mean he’s the Dragon King? Hiss, he’s so young, this...”

Young emperor ye questioned bei Shuang’s order. Some of the people around looked at bei Shuang and were quickly recognized. All of them said in surprise.

“Huh?”

Young Emperor Ye and his two middle-aged subordinates who were protecting him had a drastic change of expression when they heard that.

“Wang Xian, what happened? What is young emperor ye up to?”

At this moment, the Empress Star Lady and the rest walked over. They glanced at young emperor Ye and walked in front of Wang Xian.

“Dragon King!”

The imperial star ladies who were beside him greeted Wang Xian respectfully.

“It’s alright. I saw a good seedling and was prepared to take him into the Dragon Palace. In the end, the Little Rascals wanted to stop me. How interesting.”

Wang Xian shook his head indifferently and his gaze landed on young Emperor Ye.

“It seems that the young master of the Ye clan is lacking in manners. It’s best for him to know how high the sky is and how thick the ground is.”

He spoke plainly.

Wang Xian’s words nearly made young emperor ye vomit blood. His expression changed drastically as he clenched his fists tightly.

“Young master, it’s the Dragon King.”

The two middle-aged men beside him broke out in cold sweat as they sent a voice transmission immediately.

“Huff! Huff!”

He took a quick breath as his expression changed.

“This... Dragon Palace, Dragon King...”

Beside him, the venom leader and his clansmen widened their eyes in shock.

They knew the importance of the Dragon Palace and Dragon King.

Not long ago, the Dragon Palace defeated the horizon sect and forced the entire sect to flee.

The power of the Dragon Palace spread throughout the imperial star field.

How strong would the force that could defeat the horizon sect be?

It might not be as strong as the night clan, but would the young master of the night clan want to compete with the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace?

It was not an exaggeration to say that they were completely unworthy.

...

There was no comparison between a god Lord and a peak powerhouse.

“If I had known earlier, if I had known earlier...”

The moment the venom leader and the others thought about how the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace had personally recruited them and how they had actually chosen the young emperor of the night and even had a conflict with the Dragon King, they felt their vision darken.

That Dragon King had taken a liking to poison nine?

That Fellow, who they thought was trash, had actually been called a good seedling by the Dragon King...

“Dragon King!”

Poison Nine, who was standing behind Wang Xian, trembled as he stared at the figure in front of him with his eyes wide open in disbelief.

A leader of a sect-level force had taken a liking to him?

“It’s really the Dragon King. I didn’t expect that the Dragon King would actually come here.”

“Hiss, this is the leader of a sect. I heard that the Dragon Palace on the Demon Island is currently the strongest.”

“This young Emperor Ye has offended the Dragon King. He even scolded the Dragon King Just Now?”

...

Some of the people around saw the celestial emperor and the others walking over. When they saw how the Celestial Emperor addressed the celestial emperor, they could completely confirm Wang Xian’s identity. Everyone was discussing in low voices in astonishment.

Not far away, even the two guardians of the imperial court who were conversing with the one-armed saber and the Heavenly Sword King looked over in astonishment.

“Let’s Go!”

The young emperor of the night trembled when he heard the discussions around him. He said with a gloomy expression.

“Did they let you go?”

Wang Xian watched him leave and asked indifferently.

The young emperor of the night’s expression changed. The pupils of the two guardians also contracted slightly.

“Dragon King, what do you want? Is Your Dragon Palace going to make an enemy out of the Ye Clan?”

His body trembled. He gritted his teeth and turned his head to stare at Wang Xian as he growled in a low voice.

“If you can represent the Ye clan, yes.”

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly when he heard his words. His tone was a little cold as well.

“Wow!”

Everyone’s expression changed drastically when Wang Xian finished his words.

“Is young emperor ye tired of living? How dare he threaten the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace!”

“This... Young Emperor Ye is not in his right mind. How dare he say such words? Does he think he is a powerhouse at the peak of the Ye Clan?”

Around them, a few powerhouses from the imperial court frowned slightly and spoke without hiding anything.

In their eyes, young Emperor Ye’s words were no different from an idiot.

“Young Emperor Ye, think before you speak. See who you are talking to.”

The Empress who was standing next to the Imperial Star Lady also spoke sarcastically without any hesitation.

Perhaps she was used to being arrogant and thought that her status was honorable.

But you should also see who you are talking to. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Dragon King of the Dragon Palace, the leader of a powerful sect. You are a disciple of a god Lord level. Even if your background is deep and your father and grandfather are at the peak of the god King level, that is not you.

How could the dignity of a strong person be so easily challenged?

The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace sent the experts of the Dragon Palace to find an opportunity to kill you directly. What could the night clan do to the Dragon Palace without any evidence?

Start a battle of the great sects just for one person?
