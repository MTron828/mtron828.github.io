Chapter 501: Alliance Of The Orthodox Sects

Sigh!

Wang Xian heaved a sigh and shook his head while looking at the villa before he headed outside.

A man has a home that he cannot return to. How sad it is!

But he had brought it upon himself.

One must bear certain consequences of having his harem.

Wang Xian walked to the sea. With a swift movement, he hovered to the floating island.

It had been some time, and the construction of the island was almost complete. The buildings were all up and running.

Treasure Vault, Elixir Refining Room, and now there would be a new addition – Refinery Room.

Wang Xian revealed a smile on his face when he came to the Treasure Vault and saw a truckload of treasures.

There were more than three hundred Inborn Spiritual Weapons, but all of them were, however, fire-attributed Spiritual Weapons, which were not practical to Dragonians.

In addition to the myriad of weapons, the rest were fire-attributed materials.

Using the fire-attributed material to make weapons would not necessarily refine only fire-attributed weapons. Still, it would require materials of other attributes to neutralize it.

Wang Xian was unsure of the details.

Wang Xian took out the Art of Blacksmith from the Fire God’s Secret Book that Adjaya had passed to him.

From the Level 13 Spiritual Weapon in Adjaya’s hand and over three hundred Inborn Spiritual Weapons, one could tell that Fire God Hephaestus’ forte was refining equipment.

His skill in smithing was definitely top-notch.

The Art of Blacksmith was a long-lost skill in the Underworld. As such, all Inborn Spiritual Weapons were extremely precious, so much so that even Sacred Sects would treat them as valuable items.

If Wang Xian could smith out different Inborn Spiritual Weapons, he could arm Dragonians to the teeth.

In addition, this could also enhance the level of Dragon Palace.

“Refine weapons using low-grade material to make high-level items!”

Wang Xian read the first line of the note and continued.

“Dragon King!”

At this time, Mo Yuan’s voice was heard from the outside.

“Hur?”

He frowned slightly. “What’s the matter?”

“Donghua Sacred Sect sent someone here to invite the Dragon Sect to join the alliance of the orthodox sects. They urged you to attend as all the Sacred Sects, Sacred Clans, and first-class forces from the Underworld will be present!” said Mo Yuan.

“Alliance of the orthodox sects? When is it?”

Wang Xian knit his eyebrow slightly.

“Tomorrow at noon at the Dong Hua Ritual Grounds!” Mo Yuan answered.

“Call upon some Dragonians to go with me!”

After some consideration, Wang Xian instructed Mo Yuan.

“Yes, Dragon King!”

The alliance of the orthodox sects was equivalent to the Underworld joining hands.

“It seems like the war between good and evil is inevitable!”

Wang Xian frowned slightly as there would be many unparalleled experts participating in the war.

Since Inborn Experts were the main strength in this war, their deaths made perfect sense.

That included unparalleled experts. For those who had yet to become Inborns, they would be on their own to stay alive.

“Let’s check them out.”

Wang Xian stood up and walked out.

“Dragon King!” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Soon, Mo Yuan brought twenty Dragonians to Wang Xian and greeted him with respect.

“Where is the Dong Hua Ritual Grounds?” asked Wang Xian to Mo Yuan.

“They are located at the North Mountain, which is the most central spot in the country. We need eight hours to reach there!”

“Get ready, and we’ll set off soon,” said Wang Xian to Mo Yuan. With quick movements, he flitted to the villa.

When he reached the entrance of the villa, he tip-toed in.

“Brother!”

Seeing Wang Xian coming in, Xiao Yu quickly walked to him.

“What’s the situation now?” asked Wang Xian in a low voice.

“What else?” Xiao Yu rolled her eyes at him. “In the past, I still thought of finding a boyfriend like you. But now, you might as well kill me to have a boyfriend like you!”

“Eh... I’m heading out later. Donghua Sacred Sect is organizing an alliance of the orthodox sects, so I’m going over later!” Wang Xian asked Xiao Yu, “Are you going too?”

“Yes, Master just called me to go over. I heard that Donghua Sacred Sect was not only the one leading, but there are also another six forces turning up. No one dared to reject!”

“Don’t go. Stay at home and watch over them for me,” Wang Xian peered at the rooms and said to Xiao Yu.

Xiao Yu rolled her eyes. “Then I’ll inform my master!”

Wang Xian nodded, stroked Xiao Yu’s hair, and giggled.

Xiao Yu threw him a dirty look. “The two sisters-in-law are infuriated. You better go out and stay clear for the time being!”

“Okay!”

Wang Xian smiled and nodded as he headed outside.

Donghua Sacred Sect was the strongest Sacred Sect in the Underworld, and it was recognized as the most powerful force.

Nie Wushuang, Sect Leader of Donghua Sacred Sect, was the ultimate expert in the Underworld. Donghua Sacred Sect was the one who took the lead in establishing the alliance of the orthodox sects against Diabolism fifty years ago.

Today, the alliance of the orthodox sects was taking form once again.

When Wang Xian led twenty Dragonians near Dong Hua Ritual Grounds, it was night time.

Dong Hua Ritual Grounds were situated in the most central region in China, which was next to a small county.

“Are you all from Dragon Sect?”

Just as they entered the small town, several young men in yellow outfits walked over and cupped their fists as they asked.

“Yes!”

Mo Yuan, standing by the side, nodded to the disciples of Donghua Sacred Sect.

“Please follow us into the mountain. We have prepared your accommodation!”

The young man gestured to them with a beam.

“Sure!”

Wang Xian nodded and went into the mountain of Donghua Sacred Sect.

Several young men were staring at Wang Xian with curiosity. One of them hesitated before he said, “I presume you’re the Dragon King!”

“Mm.” Wang Xian nodded nonchalantly.

Seeing his lukewarm reaction, these young men raised their eyebrows and kept quiet!

Whoo-hoo!

Just then, eight people hovered through the air and entered the range of mountains ahead.

“Let’s hover over!”

Wang Xian gazed at the road ahead, which was several kilometers away before they could reach their destination. Given the speed of these young men, they needed to walk for another ten minutes at least.

“Dragon King, only the Inborn Experts of our sect can hover in the air. Flying is prohibited for other sect members!” a young man explained to Wang Xian with a broad smile.

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and said impassively, “Donghua Sacred Sect doesn’t respect their guests!”

“Heh!”

Those young men chuckled upon hearing his comment. They had faint pride surfaced on their faces. “Dong Hua rules supreme in the Underworld. This is our rule, and the respect shown to Donghua Sacred Sect from the guests!”

Respect?

A hint of disdain flashed in Wang Xian’s eyes while he did not utter any words.

Seeing Wang Xian keeping mum, those young men deepened their smiles and lifted their chins while leading them into the mountains of Donghua Sacred Sect.

Towering mountains with flying cranes and cries of the ancient apes.

Majestic buildings stood among the mountain range while water tumbled down from the mountain in the center just like a wonderland!
