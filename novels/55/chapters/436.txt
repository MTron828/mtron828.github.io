Chapter 437: The Champion Of The Younger Generation (2)

“Young Master, that’s Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown.”

“Has Uncle Bian found the killer?”

“Not yet, but the possibility of it being Miracle Doctor Wang’s doing is quite high. Sect Master Bian has prepared to strike.”

“Oh, really?”

“The information that Sect Master Bian received was that Young Master Bian lost contact ever since he reached Shang Jing. Back then, Miracle Doctor Wang was in Shang Jing too!”

“Brother Quan was my playmate since we were young. How dare someone murder him. The killer deserves to die!”

Back at the center of the field stood three people from Medical Saint Sect. Among which, the young man, Hua Mingshan, in the middle was staring in Wang Xian’s direction. Flashese of cold radiance blinked in his eyes.

“Miracle Doctor Wang has domineering talents, and his Arts of Refining Elixr Pills was better than Young Master Bian!” an old man at the side whispered to Hua Mingshan.

“Since he can kill Brother Quan, who was protected by the Poison Duo, I don’t think he’s that simple. He must possess a strength near Pinnacle Inborn!”

Hua Mingshan squinted his eyes slightly together as murderous intent flashed in his eyes as he stared daggers at Wang Xian.

“With an Inborn Spiritual Weapon in his possession, no average Inborn Experts is of his match,” said that old man slowly as he noticed the Zhan Lu Sword at Wang Xian’s waist.

“Bian Family of Medical Saint Sect is better at refining medicines while the Hua Family is more proficient in combat. I’ll take care of this Miracle Doctor Wang, so that Brother Quan can rest in peace too!” Hua Mingshan said at a slow pace.

“Young Master, should we inform Sect Master Bian?” asked the old man with a frown.

“No. Let’s meet this guy first!”

Hua Mingshan lifted his chin slightly. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Bian Family and Hua Family of Medical Saint Sect had different fortes. Bian Family was better at refining medicines while Hua Family was more skilled in combat.

Their most outstanding disciples of Medical Saint Sect were Bian Yaoquan and Hua Mingshan.

In Medical Saint Sect, it was easy to groom an Inborn Expert with elixir pills.

Outstanding Young Heroes Chart was not the focus of Medical Saint Sects. As such, they would only send a disciple here to exhibit their prowess every few years.

A disciple from Medical Saint Sect had already attended last year. Hua Mingshan had not been preparing to come this year. But he changed his mind when he found that Wang Xian was attending.

Since young, Hua Mingshan had been taking all kinds of precious elixir pills, and he had advanced to Inborn a few years ago.

Besides, Hua Family’s cultivation was wood attributed. With the special Spiritual Grass as supplements, their combat power would be extremely domineering.

All Saint-class forces had their own strong advantages.

...

“Young Lord, that is Miracle Doctor Wang of Rivertown!”

Two powerful Inborn Spiritual Beasts were lying at the other side of the field while the Young Lord of Hai Long lifted open the veil and looked at the surroundings with some slack.

None of the forces dared to approach this place. All of them stood far away and looked over with awe.

Not even the people from Sacred Sects or Sacred Clans dared to come near them.

As the only son of the second most formidable person in the Underworld, his status was even higher than that of Saint. Besides, the Lord of Hai Jiao was a legend in his own lifetime. Even the Sacred Sects had to beware of him!

“Oh?” Hai Long looked over with a faint smile on his face. “The competition this year is far more interesting than before. So many people are here, which makes the game even more exciting!”

...

Saint Qi and Saint Wen of Dark Sect were standing alongside Sun Longxuan, having conversations as they cast their attention in Wang Xian’s direction.

Some of the disciples from the Sacred Clan also looked over with curiosity.

Xiao Ran was standing in the center among Xiao Clan’s people. He was beaming as he looked at his master with a sense of pride surfacing on his face. “If my master participates in this ranking, no one will be his match!”

“Hehe, he’ll be a bully if he does.”

Several elders around him immediately flattered him.

But what they said was from the bottom of their hearts too. Even Laozu also remarked on the domineering prowess of Miracle Doctor Wang for coaching a fifteen-year-old Inborn Expert.

Naturally, he was of the same realm as Laozu.

For such an expert to attend the Outstanding Young Heroes Competition, that would be abuse.

“This time, I’ll strive to get a good ranking so that I’ll not bring shame to my master!”

Xiao Ran chuckled as his youthful appearance was filled with fighting spirit.

All the eyes of the elders in Xiao Family were filled with admiration and impressiveness as they looked at the young Clan Leader.

...

“Miracle Doctor Wang of Rivertown?”

Just when Wang Xian and Xiao Yu were standing at the front desk, checking the odds for all the supreme talents, they heard a cold voice.

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows as he spun around.

The familiar outfit with a huge ‘Saint’ on it indicated the difference in their level of forces.

Medical Saint Sect!

Wang Xian looked at the young man who was staring at him. He cast his sight to the side, and there was an old man and a middle-aged man too.

“What’s up?”

“Nothing much. I just wanted to meet you and check with you about something.”

Hua Mingshan squinted his eyes a little. “Have you seen my brother Bian Yaoquan?”

“Hur? Your brother is missing, and you’re looking for him at my side?”

Wang Xian threw Hua Mingshan a taunting look. He swept his gaze across the surroundings and noticed many people turning their attention in their direction.

“You know what I’m saying, don’t you?”

Hua Mingshan glowered at Wang Xian with a cold look. In his hand, he was holding on to an emerald twig that looked like some jewelry.

“What’s going on? Why did Hua Mingshan of Medical Saint Sect look for Miracle Doctor Wang? Are they going to spar?”

“The competition has not even started yet. Do they have some conflicts?”

“Through their conversations, it seems like another disciple of Medical Saint Sect was involved!”

The crowd over at the front desk was caught by surprise when they overheard their conversations.

Generally, the battle between a Saint and a supreme talent happened in the arena. Why did Hua Mingshan look for Miracle Doctor Wang?

“I have seen three people from Medical Saint Sect. One young man who was tired of living and another two old men. I’m not sure if you’re referring to that person!”

Wang Xian arched his lips slightly as he replied to Hua Mingshan plainly.

“Tired of living?” Hua Mingshan slowly turned the branch in his hand with killing intent flashing in his eyes. “Looks like the death of Bian Yaoquan of Medical Saint Sect really has got something to do with you!”

“Haha,” Wang Xian chuckled. “If you’re talking about that fellow who was tired of living, just say it. It’s not a big deal anyway.”

“He’s dead!” He beamed as he spat out the words with a casual face.

Hua Mingshan was stunned, and so were the surrounding people. Apparently, they were caught off guard when Wang Xian announced the death so easily.

Hua Mingshan of Medical Saint Sect was clearly questioning Miracle Doctor Wang of Rivertown about whether he had killed another disciple.

With no clear evidence, no one would own up to offending a Sacred Sect under this circumstance.

Yet, Miracle Doctor Wang admitted it straight away by saying that the person was dead. In other words, it was clear that he had killed that person.

This...

Everyone found it unbelievable. All of them felt that this Miracle Doctor Wang was rather... too full of himself!

“Why? Do you want me to send the body to you?” Wang Xian threw him a disdainful look, “Bian Yaoquan from the Medical Saint Sect attempted to ambush me previously. It was only natural that I send him to hell!”
