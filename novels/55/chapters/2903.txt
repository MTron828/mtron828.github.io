Chapter 2904: had the power of the Dragon Palace on its back

“Eh? Boss Wang, what is this?”

Invincible looked at the immortal slaying Calabash before him, his eyes gleaming. Looking at the colorful light, he smacked his lips and couldn’t help but grab it.

“The immortal slaying Calabash already has a lot of immortal slaying swords in it. The 10 sword attacks of the wind attribute should be able to kill a god Emperor Level 1 warrior, there are 20 of them.”

“The rest of the immortal-slaying swords can only kill a peak immortal king level existence.”

Wang Xian said to him.

“Wow, boss Wang, this is a supreme treasure. You actually lent me such a precious treasure.”

“You gave me such a powerful treasure so that I could defeat Liu Li? hehehe!”

Invincible battle technique stared at the immortal-slaying calabash and shouted loudly with his eyes shining.

“It’s for you to save your life.”

Wang Xian smiled at him.

“Hehe, what danger can there be if you follow my master? Furthermore, if my master returns and recognizes his ancestors, he will be Liuli’s disciple. Invincible battle technique will have another powerful background.”

Invincible battle technique narrowed his eyes slightly and said.

“Hehe, Kid, only five god-emperors died in the Liuli region two days ago. The Liuli region is not safe now. The Dragon King lent you the treasure so that you can save your life.”

Prime Minister Gui, who was sitting at the side, said to him mockingly.

“What? Five Divine Emperors died? F * CK, is the war in the glazed domain so terrible?”

Invincible battle technique immediately jumped up and said with his eyes wide open.

“Why don’t you go and take a look?”

Prime Minister Gui said to him with a smile.

“I. . . No wonder master looked so embarrassed. Did Master’s family die? Wow, I, Invincible battle technique, don’t want to die young. Boss Wang, do you have any other treasures? Lend me two more to protect myself!”

Invincible in combat said with a sad face.

“No more. Let’s go. Your master won’t let you die. If you encounter any danger, just return to your divine kingdom. Your Divine Kingdom is here in the Dragon Palace anyway.”

Wang Xian waved his hand at him and said speechlessly.

“Is it really gone, boss Wang?”

Invincible in combat lowered his head and asked again, unwilling to give up.

“It’s gone. If you die, I will send an expert from the Dragon Palace to bring your corpse back.”

Wang Xian said to him.

“Heartless, I am your little brother, boss Wang!”

Unrivaled battle technique shook his head and walked out with a sad face.

Wang Xian looked at his figure and smiled. It was enough to give him an immortal-slaying gourd to save his life.

The god Emperor of Shangshui brought him there. It was impossible for him to put himself in danger.

After all, this was the god Emperor of Shangshui’s precious disciple.

“I didn’t expect the glazed tile region to be so dangerous now. Master, this stubborn donkey, had a conflict with his family back then. He didn’t return for a million years. Now that he’s suddenly returned, something must have happened to his family.”

“With this stubborn donkey’s temper, I reckon he will fight to the death with the people who killed his family. F * ck, the five God emperors are all dead. It’s dangerous. No, I have to bring more life-saving items.”

Invincible battle technique walked out of Wang Xian’s study room. He mumbled as his eyes kept rolling.

His body moved and he immediately flew towards the location of the Dragon’s lair.

“Grandpa Tianchen, Grandpa Tianchen, your grandson is here!”

Arriving in front of Tianchen’s Dragon’s lair, invincible battle technique shouted loudly.

When Tianchen, who was in his dragon’s lair, heard invincible battle technique’s words, his face turned black.

“Kid, what’s the matter?”

Tian Chen shouted at him.

“Hehe, Grandpa Tian Chen, I’m coming in!”

Invincible smiled and walked in.

In the Dragon Cave, Tian Chen was reading a wizard manual, and there were a few dragon wizards studying something.

Invincible walked in and squinted his eyes, looking like a thief.

“Kid, spit it out!” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Tianchen said to him.

“Grandpa Tianchen, you have to save me, Grandpa Tianchen!”

Invincible battle technique’s expression changed and tears flowed out of his eyes. He rushed over and hugged Tianchen’s thigh.

“SOB, sob, sob, Grandpa Tianchen, save me. It seems that I often bring you all kinds of delicious food!”

He cried out with great acting skills.

“Kid, if you have anything to say, just say it!”

Tianchen glared at him and said.

“Grandpa Tianchen, I want to follow master to the glazed domain. There is a war happening in the glazed domain now. Boss Wang said that five God emperors died in the glazed domain two days ago. I guess it should be my master’s relatives who died. If I go to the battlefield, with my strength, I will be courting death!”

Invincible battle technique wailed.

“Oh, don’t worry. Your master won’t Let You Throw Your Life Away!”

Tianchen glanced at him and said indifferently.

“No, Grandpa Tianchen. I’m not afraid of anything. If I die, who will give you good wine and food in the future? If I Die, you won’t have any descendants.”

Invincible battle technique shouted exaggeratedly.

“Get lost!”

Tian Chen kicked him away angrily. With a black face, he waved his arm.

“Weng!”

A blood cloth hanging on the wall fell on invincible battle technique’s body.

“Take this thing and scram. This is a saint’s mark. After my modification, I can guarantee that you won’t die under the god Emperor’s attack for ten minutes.”

Tian Chen said to him, “After it has reached its limit, it will automatically disappear and return to me.”

“Wow, Grandpa Tian Chen, I love you so much!”

Invincible battle technique’s eyes lit up as he shouted loudly.

He stroked the saint’s mark on his body and was extremely excited.

However, he looked at a flute on the wall and pursed his lips.

“Grandpa Tian Chen, I have a self-defense one. Do you want to give me one to fight my enemies? Grandpa Tian Chen, what’s the use of that flute? Can I borrow it?”

Invincible battle technique pointed at the earthy yellow flute and said.

Just now, he saw the Knight’s mark on his body together with the flute. The Knight’s mark was a god Emperor level treasure, so the flute was definitely not bad.

Tian Chen stared at him and raised his eyebrows.

“Grandpa Tian Chen, your grandson’s Life!”

Invincible battle technique pleaded in a low voice.

“That is the control of the Earth. When the flute is played, it can condense an earth attribute first level god Emperor Monster to fight.”

“This treasure and the Knight’s mark on your body belong to the Cheng Sorcerer Association’s Clan Supreme Treasure. Since You Call Me Grandpa, I Won’t be stingy. I can lend it to you.”

“Just like the Knight’s mark, once the treasure has the risk of being taken away and destroyed, they will immediately disappear.”

Tian Chen said indifferently.

“No problem, no problem. Grandpa Tian Chen, you are the one who loves me!”

Invincible battle technique’s eyes lit up as he said loudly.

“It’s the New Year. Kowtow to me a hundred times. I will help you set up a formation on the Earth’s control and leave a trace of your soul. When the time comes, you can directly open it!”

Tian Chen said indifferently to him as he sat in front of the chair and looked at him.

Hearing this, invincible battle technique’s face darkened.
