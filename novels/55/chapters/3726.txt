“Huh?”

Wang Xian, who was standing there and watching, suddenly felt his heart tighten. His expression changed and he immediately looked over.

Their eyes met.

Wang Xian looked at the 12-winged angel.

The extremely handsome and extraordinary 12-winged angel stood there and stared at him with a calm expression.

A long white robe was draped over his body and there were three words carved on it!

“The third Prince of the Radiant Angel of the Angel clan.”

Wang Xian looked over and his pupils contracted slightly.

The third Prince looked at him quietly and looked at his side.

“Monitor all the members of the Dragon Palace. The moment anyone with the Divine Dragon bloodline enters, lock down the Dragon Palace immediately and kill them. I don’t want any of the disciples of the Dragon Palace to be alive after entering the starry universe.”

He looked at a burly battle angel beside him and ordered.

“It’s Your Highness, the third prince. Leave one of the Dragon Kings to me.”

The burly 12-winged angel nodded and looked at Wang Xian as well.

“The third Prince’s strength is extremely terrifying. It’s so terrifying that he can kill me in an instant.”

“That burly Angel’s strength is equally terrifying. He can also kill me easily.”

Wang Xian stood there and his expression changed slightly.

Wang Xian estimated that the third prince’s strength was at least at the fifth level of the universe dominator.

It was even possible for him to reach the seventh or eighth level of the universe dominator, or even higher.

The angel who was staring at him now was also very powerful.

“As expected, the third prince still wants to kill me. I reckon that once I enter, the experts of the angel race will come and kill me!”

Wang Xian frowned slightly, and a contemplative look appeared on his face.

The angel race could not attack him here, but they could do so in the starry universe.

The Starry Universe was an unknown Treasure Trove. Although there were dangers, it could allow an expert to soar into the sky.

According to the thinking of an expert, the third Prince would definitely not allow the experts of the Dragon Palace to search for opportunities in the starry universe.

It was highly possible that he would allow them to enter and then destroy them.

“If I enter now, I can still escape from their lock.”

Wang Xian pondered in his heart. With the escape scroll in his hand, he could escape in an instant.

Although this instant escape was somewhat random, it was still a life-saving treasure and could be used three times.

He could use the mother nest to lead the powerhouses of the Dragon Palace into it and escape.

“Let’s Go!”

He was deep in thought. With a move of his body, he disappeared instantly.

“Third prince, take this to prevent those with the divine dragon bloodline from being taken away from the life space.”

After Wang Xian disappeared, the eyes of the Green River Phoenix landed on the third prince from the side of the Angel clan.

In front of the third prince, a statue with the head of a dragon appeared.

Upon seeing this statue, the third prince smiled and nodded his head lightly.

This was to prevent other strong disciples from using their life space to carry the strong disciples of the Dragon Palace away.

Once there was one, the third prince could sense it through the head of the dragon. At that time, he could send people directly or follow them personally.

“A small Dragon Palace wants to fight with me?”

The third prince sneered and revealed a cold expression.

Once he could make a move personally, the small dragon palace would be easily crushed!

At this moment, Wang Xian returned to the Dragon Palace and entered the Dragon King’s Hall. He was deep in thought!

“An lie!”

His mind moved and he shouted. However, he didn’t get a response. He then sensed the dragon palace and took out the universal AI to send a message to an lie.

“Dragon King, you called for me!”

Very soon, an Lie’s figure appeared. At this moment, he seemed to be in high spirits.

“Eh?”

Wang Xian sized up an lie, and a look of surprise appeared in his eyes. “An lie, your strength has become stronger?”

“Yes, Dragon King. Dragon King, in the Void Pagoda, I can cultivate. Moreover, the Void Pagoda in the invincible zone is one of the top void pagodas. There aren’t many in the entire void universe. After some research, I discovered other functions that allowed my strength to soar!”

An lie said excitedly.

The Void Pagoda in the Invincible Zone was definitely a top-tier supreme treasure in the Void Universe.

More importantly, this supreme treasure wasn’t an ordinary innate supreme treasure, but a terrifying war machine.

There weren’t many of them in the entire void universe.

Such a powerful supreme treasure was now occupied by an lie alone, and the energy in it greatly increased his strength.

“Oh, is that so? An Lie, how far are you teleporting now?”

Wang Xian’s eyes lit up as he asked him expectantly. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

If an Lie’s teleporting distance was very far, he could let an lie go over first and then bring them over.

“If it’s teleporting distance, I can teleport to the center from one side of the river of Eternity!”

An lie said.

“At this distance?”

Wang Xian frowned slightly when he heard that. This distance was not very safe.

The range that the world of technology could investigate was about the size of the entire river of eternity.

Once an lie was teleported over, based on the technology of the world of technology, he would be able to detect some clues.

Now, Wang Xian could confirm that an lie’s ability belonged to the teleportation ability of the Void Royals in the Void Universe. Once he was discovered, it would be very troublesome.

“Dragon King, I can now perform some simple controls on the Void Pagoda. If I were to control the Void Pagoda, the teleportation distance would be increased by ten times!”

At this moment, an lie added.

“Is that so?”

Wang Xian’s eyes lit up. There was a hint of excitement in his eyes.

“Let’s go. Follow Me!”

He moved and immediately brought an lie along as they continued to fly deeper into the mountains and seas.

When they were still a distance away from the entrance of the world, he stopped.

He scanned his surroundings. After confirming that there were no experts around, Wang Xian gestured to an lie.

“Summon the Void Pagoda over.”

He spoke.

“Alright, Dragon King!”

An lie nodded. In the next moment, an incomparably huge void pagoda appeared in front of him.

“Dragon King, let’s Enter!”

An lie spoke to him and brought him directly to the seat controlled by the Void Pagoda!

“Dragon King, I’m sitting on the Void throne. My ability can be terrifyingly enhanced. Under the condition of sensing the space, I can sense the location in front of me. There’s a large number of experts gathered there. I can sense the other side of the starry universe. I can stretch far, far away.”

An lie sat on the Void throne and spoke to Wang Xian.

“Very good. Immediately teleport to the limit of the Void Pagoda and enter the starry universe. You Won’t be discovered, right?”

Wang Xian asked him.

“No. There are no experts at the entrance of the starry universe who can discover the Void Pagoda.”

As an lie spoke, he used the power of the Void Pagoda to sense rapidly. In the next moment, they disappeared!
