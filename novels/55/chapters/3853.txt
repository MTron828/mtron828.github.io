3854 3853 kill, the power of the Heaven’s origin fragment

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

When the crystal creature saw the attacks from Wang Xian and the rest, it roared in shock and anger.

It did not dare to take the attacks from Wang Xian and the rest head-on.

Six Spears shot towards it. Once it was hit, it would definitely die!

The crystal creature hurriedly dodged to the side.

However, when it dodged to the side, the Five Elements Annihilation Disc’s attack landed on its body.

The powerful attack caused cracks to appear on his body.

This time, the cracks covered almost his entire body.

“Continue!”

Lan qingyue shouted softly. With a move of her palm, a grayish palm pressed down directly on the crystal creature.

Xiao Lan and the rest opened their mouths. Waves of energy were injected into the palm.

The gigantic and terrifying palm arrived above the head of the crystal creature!

Wang Xian waved his arm and the soul battleship under him crashed towards it!

The AOE attack covered it once again!

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

The Crystal Creature let out a furious roar and instantly appeared at the edge of the Kun’s domain. Endless sea water attacked the Kun’s domain.

It wanted to break through the Kun’s domain.

As long as it left the Kun’s domain, it would be able to escape easily.

Otherwise, what awaited it would be death!

“It won’t be so easy to escape!”

Wang Xian moved his body and the Divine Dragon of light and darkness circled around his body.

He used the strength of his physical body to attack it directly.

The great grinding of the five elements also smashed towards it forcefully.

The crystal creature sensed the attack from Wang Xian and the rest again. Its face was filled with panic.

He quickly stopped attacking the Kun’s domain. All the seawater surged towards his body, forming a powerful defense.

Boom

Lan Qingyue and the rest landed their palms on it.

The Crystal Creature’s defense was actually forcefully blocked.

Bang

However, the five elements Millstone had already arrived in front of him. The entire five elements Millstone was emitting flames as it charged towards him forcefully.

Boom

The immense force caused cracks to appear on the body of the Crystal Creature!

Wang Xian followed closely behind as his arm turned into a dragon claw.

The Light and Darkness Dragon Claws overlapped with each other and smashed onto the surface of the crystal creature.

Crack! Crack! Crack

In the next moment, the body of the crystal creature was like glass.

Pieces of crystals fell from its body.

Each piece of crystal contained a majestic energy.

When Wang Xian saw this scene, his eyes lit up with joy!

“Big Whale Fist!”

Lan qingyue swayed her body and threw an ordinary punch at the crystal creature.

Her punch seemed to contain the strength of three kun.

“Bang!”

When her punch landed on the body of the crystal creature, its body completely collapsed!

Its entire body turned into pieces of crystal energy.

“It’s dead!”

When Wang Xian saw that the crystal creature had completely collapsed, a look of joy appeared on his face.

“This crystal creature is really powerful. If we didn’t trap it, we wouldn’t be able to kill it.”

Lan Qingyue said with a smile on her face.

“Indeed. This crystal creature’s speed is too fast and its attack power is also very strong. If it wanted to escape outside, it would be easy for it.”

Wang Xian nodded his head.

If it weren’t for him and Lan Qingyue working together, ordinary experts wouldn’t be able to do anything to him.

One had to know that when Wang Xian and Lan Qingyue worked together, they could rival more than ten cosmic beasts that were at the level of a ruler at level six.

If he couldn’t restrict his movements, Wang Xian felt that even if it was a cosmic beast that was at the level of a ruler at level seven, it would be very difficult to catch it.

Wang Xian moved his body and waved his arm to collect the crystals.

Each crystal contained a huge amount of energy.

Wang Xian could also absorb this energy.

However, he did not lack the resources to upgrade.

He waved his arm and threw them to Xiao Lan.

Currently, they were prepared to focus all their efforts on nurturing Xiao Lan. They would first upgrade Xiao Lan to the overlord of level seven.

“Woo Woo!”

Xiao Lan swallowed all the crystals and let out a joyful sound.

“How much more energy do I need to raise my strength?”

Wang Xian asked Xiao Lan with a smile.

“Dragon King, I need to kill at least three more of these crystal creatures before I can raise my strength.”

Xiao Lan reported.

“Three?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows. There were too many of them!

They were lucky to be able to kill this crystal creature this time.

This crystal creature was a little arrogant. It wanted to fight them if they didn’t run away.

If it ran away immediately, Wang Xian and the rest wouldn’t be able to kill it.

“Let’s take it slow!” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Wang Xian wasn’t in a hurry. He wanted to improve slowly.

As long as Xiao Lan improved, he would continue to worship the gods in the universe.

At that time, he would be able to obtain a terrifying amount of resources.

“Wu Wu!”

Thinking of this, little blue and the others let out a low roar, and the Kun domain instantly disappeared!

“Huh?”

However, when they had just appeared in the ocean, Lan Qing Yue slightly focused and immediately looked to the left.

“Little Xian, I can sense the energy of the universe masters of Faith. They are chasing us.”

Lan Qingyue immediately spoke up.

“Are they chasing us? How dare the tens of millions of troops from their ten palaces come here? Aren’t they afraid of the attacks of the Space Beasts?”

Wang Xian revealed a look of surprise as he spoke up!

“They shouldn’t be the troops who believe in the universe. They only have eight streams of energy. The strength of a level seven pantheon!”

Lan Qingyue sensed and spoke up!

“Eight level seven pantheon? Are they chasing after us? Do they have any trump cards?”

When Wang Xian heard that, he didn’t relax at all. On the contrary, a solemn expression appeared on his face!

“Let’s go. Let’s not touch them for the time being.”

Wang Xian hesitated for two seconds and spoke immediately!

Lan qingyue nodded her head.

Eight level seven pantheon dared to chase after them. It was impossible to say that the other party didn’t have any trump cards.

Wang Xian and the rest had completely exposed their strength.

If they were to chase after them under such circumstances, they must have a trump card.

A powerful trump card!

Wang Xian and the rest came to Xiao Lan’s body. Xiao Lan swayed her huge body and swam straight ahead.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

Not long after, eight figures appeared at the position of Wang Xian and the rest. Each of them was stepping on a book condensed from their faith.

Their eyes scanned the surroundings, and there was a glint in their eyes.

“The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace and the rest have just left this place!”

“There must have been a huge battle here. Let’s go, let’s continue our pursuit!”

The eight gods of level seven spoke as they moved and continued their pursuit in the direction of Wang Xian and the rest.

Their speed was extremely fast, and they were no slower than Wang Xian and the rest.

Wang Xian directly dodged and fled. After flying for more than a month, Lan Qingyue did not sense the eight level-seven gods.

“This chasing technique of the belief universe is really amazing. To be able to lock onto us with such precision, it’s really not simple!”

Lan Qingyue could not help but exclaim.
