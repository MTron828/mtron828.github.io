Chapter 1529: 1529 son of Light? In

The dove occupied the magpie’s Nest!

The Divine Light Dragon charged towards the soul of darkness and attracted it with pure darkness energy.

The Soul of darkness, which didn’t have high intelligence, naturally wanted to charge towards the location of the Darkness Energy. However, Wang Xian easily caught it in his hand.

Wang Xian stared at the soul of darkness. His eyes were sparkling. He didn’t purify it but kept it.

With a move of his arm, the Divine Dragon of light returned to his hand and turned into a dragon ball.

“It’s Done!”

Wang Xian waved his arm and a stream of energy healed the wound. He spoke to the young man calmly.

“HMM?”

The young man opened his eyes and touched the spot on his abdomen. Following that, his body shook and a stream of light energy enveloped his entire body. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“It’s done. Haha, I’m finally done. I, Yin Haoyan, have finally recovered. I’ve finally recovered!”

“Thank you, Reverend Wang. Thank you, thank you. I will repay you for your kindness in the future even if I have to work as a slave!”

An excited voice came out from the young man’s mouth. He knelt in front of Wang Xian and kowtowed non-stop.

A Heaven’s favorite was tortured to this day because of the soul of darkness. He was the only one who understood the hardships and mockery involved.

“Go back. You Don’t have to come back anymore!”

Wang Xian waved his hand and spoke to him indifferently. Then, he walked straight to the balcony.

After grabbing the soul of darkness, he had a new understanding.

When the young man saw Wang Xian walking to the balcony, he clenched his fists in gratitude.

“Reverend Wang, you are the one who gave me this life. Thank you!”

He kowtowed heavily once again and walked out with a determined gaze!

He was reborn!

Wang Xian did not answer him. Instead, he stared at the soul of darkness in front of him. His eyes were sparkling.

This soul of Darkness is exactly the same as the intelligence that was born in the Dragon Pearl

Wang Xian thought to himself as he sensed the location of his heart.

At this moment, the light portion of the heart of Light and darkness had reached more than 40% . At most, it would take five days for the light and darkness to maintain balance.

“The problem of the balance between light and darkness has basically been solved. The next step is the fusion of light and darkness!”

“The fusion of light and darkness is much more troublesome than the balance between light and darkness. I can refer to tai chi or the five elements grinding!”

Wang Xian was deep in thought. With a move of his palm, a ball of tai chi appeared in front of him.

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz

However, very soon, the powers of darkness and light collided and produced a melting sound.

Following that, Wang Xian continued to use the same amount of light and darkness to form a tai chi pattern, causing the forces of light and darkness to rotate.

“HMM?”

At this moment, Wang Xian realized that the speed of the melting of light and darkness had slowed down.

With a thought, he accelerated the speed of the rotation of Tai Chi. He realized that when the speed was maintained to a certain extent, the forces of darkness and light would no longer melt.

It felt like they were chasing each other, but neither of them could catch up to the other.

“There’s still another problem. I Can’t control the heart of Light and darkness to rotate all the time!”

Wang Xian frowned slowly. He had been doing this for five hours.

“Haha, I finally understand. The five elements grinding has merged with the five Elemental Dragon Pearl. There are five divine dragons pulling it.”

“On the Taiji diagram, there are two black and white spots in opposite positions. You can also use the divine dragons to pull it!”

A strong luster shot out from Wang Xian’s eyes. His eyes revealed an excited expression.

It had only been a month. It had only been a month. He had finally figured it out.

It was just a matter of time before he could completely control the heart of light and darkness.

Wang Xian clenched his fists tightly. His entire body was extremely relaxed. During this period of time, he had been tortured by the heart of Light and darkness.

For the heart of Light and darkness, he even became a priest of light.

Now, he could finally heave a sigh of relief.

However, Wang Xian didn’t stop treating him for free the next day.

Currently, the balance between light and darkness had yet to be achieved.

“Priest Wang, priest Wang, someone has sent an invitation to invite you over as a guest!”

In the evening of the second day, a female receptionist ran over and handed him an invitation.

“Huh?”

Wang Xian looked over and took the invitation letter. On it were the words ‘Guangming Villa’.

“Guangming Villa!”

When Old Hu saw these words, he was slightly shocked and shouted in shock.

“Uncle Hu, do you know this Guangming Villa?”

Wang Xian looked at him and asked curiously.

“Yes, Guangming Villa. It is the residence of Princess Wu Qingyan from Wuji Empire!”

Old Hu said with a solemn face.

“Wuji Empire?”

Wang Xian was slightly stunned. His eyes were sparkling. “Uncle Hu, tell me about this Princess Wu Qingyan!”

He did not know this Princess Wu Qingyan at all. Even when he came to the ruins of the divine kingdom, he did not leave the Holy Medicine Clinic. He did not know why Wu Qingyan invited him.

“Princess Wu Qingyan is also known as the daughter of light. Since young, this princess does not like to kill. She is under the tutelage of the radiant priest of the Divine Light Empire!”

“Now that she has the cultivation of the second level of the void interpretation stage, the radiant villa was specially built by the Emperor of the Wuji Empire for Princess Wu Qingyan!”

“Princess Wu Qingyan must have heard of your reputation and invited you over!”

Old Hu introduced Wang Xian.

“Oh, I See!”

Wang Xian nodded and walked towards the balcony.

“Eh? Pastor Wang, you... You’re not going? This... This is an invitation from the Princess of Wuji Empire!”

Old Hu looked at Wang Xian who was sitting there motionlessly with a stunned expression on his face.

“I don’t have the time!”

Wang Xian shook his head. He wasn’t interested in this invitation at all.

“This...”

Old Hu was stunned for a moment before he shook his head bitterly.

He couldn’t understand this mysterious and powerful young man.

...

“Sister Qingyan, did you really invite that priest Wang who saved the world from the hanging jar? I heard that this priest Wang is very young, very handsome, and very powerful. Haha, this time I want to see if it is as the rumors say!”

At this moment, in the Radiant Mountain Villa, a group of young men and women were sitting in front of a courtyard building. A girl said loudly with a face full of surprise.

“Why are you so clear-faced? Why are you so excited? Why Don’t I introduce you to priest Wang later?”

Wu Qingyan looked at her sister and teased.

“Cheh, I don’t like priests of light. I like the kind of strong people who exude a gloomy temperament and evil aura. Sister, you only like this kind of people!”

Wu Qingyan retorted.

“Hehe, Princess Qingyan, we would like to see if this priest Wang is as the rumors say!”

At the side, a young man holding a staff had a hint of jealousy in his eyes. He said indifferently, “I would like to see his light skill!”

“That priest Wang should have some ability. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to treat so many people every day. However, compared to the daughter of light, Princess Qingyan, and the son of light, the son of light, the Prince of Light, there is still a gap!”

“That’s true. Those who went to see the doctor were all weak people. Naturally, the treatment wouldn’t be that difficult!”

A few men and women on the side said.

“I’m also very curious about his strength. We’ll know when he comes!”

Princess Wu Qingyan said with a smile.
