“The northern front has been lost. Even our homes are gone. Sigh, this battle is too intense.”

“It’s already good that we’re still alive. Too many people died in this battle.”

“If it weren’t for the Dragon Palace experts and the Dragon King, we would probably all be buried in the void of the northern front. But even so, I don’t know how long we can stay here!”

More than 400 planets were suspended in the starry sky at the Demon Island. On the planets, countless people were discussing.

After ten hours of flight, the more than 400 planets had arrived at the place the Hierarch had mentioned last month and were temporarily settled here.

As for the future, they didn’t know yet.

Even the great sect of last month didn’t know what would happen next.

“Dragon King, this is the ocean of the Moon inviting planet. It is also the best ocean among the four hundred planets. You can build a teleportation formation and a palace here.”

At this moment, in the sky above the ocean of the Moon inviting planet, the sect leader of the last moon sect, the elders, the Dragon Python Group, the Beichuan sect, and the experts at the peak of the ancient God dynasty were accompanying Wang Xian.

“Let’s Go!”The sect leader from last month said with a smile.

The Dragon Palace wanted to build a teleportation formation in the ocean of a planet. Even though this was something that occupied their territory, who wouldn’t want to build a closer relationship with the Dragon Palace?

In this battle of the Abyss, the strength that the dragon palace had displayed had completely subdued the northern forces.

Not to mention the strength that they had displayed at the start to easily kill a few level 9 abyssal seeds, they were even more terrifying and sharp swords that resisted the trump cards of a Pinnacle Immortal King.

How could he not lick such a powerful Dragon Palace?

“Alright, Thank You!”

Wang Xian swept his gaze over and revealed a satisfied expression on his face.

The planet located at the Northern line had probably been destroyed by the abyssal seeds. A new one was created here to be used for teleportation.

“Next, we have to take care of some things. We will meet everyone after we are done.”

Wang Xian cupped his hands at them and flew towards the bottom of the sea.

Behind them, all the members of the Dragon Palace followed behind and entered the sea.

The sect master and the rest of them naturally nodded without any objections. Everyone exchanged glances and left immediately.

Boom! Boom! Boom

With the existence of the system, a dragon palace was built very quickly.

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz

The group of members entered the Dragon Palace and immediately arrived at the main dragon palace through the teleportation formation.

“Prime Minister Gui, check on all the gains and estimate the improvement of the disciples of the Dragon Palace.”

After Wang Xian entered, he immediately said to Prime Minister Gui.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Prime Minister Gui’s face was filled with smiles.

In this war, the gains of the Dragon Palace were huge.

“Dragon King, there are a total of eight level 9 undying god King Abyss species corpses, 72 level 8 undying god King Abyss species corpses, 210 level 7 abyss species corpses, and 1,123 level 6 abyss species corpses...”

“A total of 231,200,000 abyss seed corpses!”

Soon, Prime Minister Gui walked over and reported to Wang Xian.

“Let all the members of the Dragon Palace Upgrade!”

He squinted his eyes slightly and said with a smile.

“Dragon King, I suggest to upgrade the sky array to the peak of the undying god King’s combat strength. Although it will consume a little more, it is totally worth it.”

Prime Minister Gui said.

Wang Xian nodded slightly.

The improvement of the sky array was not enough with the level 9 abyss seed corpses of the immortal king level. They still needed to take out 20 level 8 abyss seed corpses.

Even though this would affect the birth of the level 9 powerhouse of the Dragon Palace, they would still be able to have a peak of the immortal king level.

The most important thing was the improvement of the sky array. It could raise dragon peak to its limit and kill two to three peak of the Immortal King Level Abyss seeds at the same time.

This was extremely terrifying to the Dragon Palace. The resources it consumed were totally worth it.

“As for the rest, use level 8 corpses for Level 9 combat strength, Level 7 corpses for Level 8 combat strength, and so on.”

Wang Xian thought about it and said.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Prime Minister Gui immediately replied.

With such an improvement, the Dragon Palace could add five level 9 combat strength members, 23 level 8 combat strength members, and more than 100 level 7 combat strength members.

As for the other members, the increase was even more terrifying.

After all, there were more than 20 million corpses this time, and the lowest strength of these corpses was rank-3 or rank-4 eternal lord.

With so many corpses increasing the strength of the 400,000 members of the Dragon Palace, the weakest members of the Dragon Palace might have rank-7 or rank-8 eternal lord.

The number of godly king experts could reach 80,000 or 90,000, or even 100,000.

After this upgrade, the strength of the Dragon Palace far exceeded the strength of the entire northern front.

They could even easily wipe out the great sect of last month.

...

“Fortune comes from danger. Only by nurturing the Dragon Palace through battle can one improve faster.”

Wang Xian mumbled as the corners of his mouth curled up slightly.

In the following period of time, all the members of the Dragon Palace entered a phase of frenzied improvement.

Wang Xian did not improve. Instead, he was free.

Seven days later, batch after batch of members had finished their improvement. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Reporting to the Dragon King, sect leader Yue from the Demon Island has something important to ask you.”

On this day, a member of the Dragon Palace who stayed on the planet of inviting the Moon rushed over and reported to Wang Xian.

“HMM? Is there something important?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and moved his body. He went straight to the Dragon Palace on the planet of inviting the moon through the teleportation formation.

“Master!”

He saw bei Shuang the moment he came out.

...

“What happened to sect master last month? Did Something Happen?”

Wang Xian and bei Shuang flew out and asked.

“Master, sect master last month was outside. Something big happened at the Northern line. The Abyss is coming towards us and it’s not far away from us.”

Bei Shuang said with a serious expression.

“Dragon King!”

“Dragon King!”

At this moment, sect master Yue and the rest saw Wang Xian coming out and shouted immediately.

“I heard from bei Shuang that where is the Abyss Now?”

Wang Xian asked.

“Dragon King, let’s go and take a look!”

Sect Master Yue said.

“Alright!”

He nodded and the group immediately flew towards the direction of the Northern line.

“Roar!”

“Ga Ga Ga Ga!”

After flying for three hours, they heard the roars of the abyssal seeds.

Wang Xian stopped his body slightly and looked ahead. His eyes were sparkling.

In front of them was an abyss that was so deep that there was no luster. At the edge of the Abyss, there were a large number of abyssal seeds gathered.

On the bodies of the countless abyssal seeds, dark energy emerged. When this energy gathered together, the entire Abyss expanded rapidly.

“In a short seven days, the Abyss has already reached this side. In a few days, our current position will be covered by the Abyss!”

“Unless we can destroy the abyssal seeds here, otherwise...”

Beichuan sect master looked forward weakly, saying with an embarrassed expression.

“With two peak divine king abyssal seeds guarding, we won’t be able to resist.”

The few powerhouses beside him shook their heads.

“Do you have any preparations now?”

Wang Xian frowned slightly and asked.

“Continue to head to the center of the Devil Abyss. We have already made contact with the forces there and are preparing to establish the Devil Island Alliance!”
