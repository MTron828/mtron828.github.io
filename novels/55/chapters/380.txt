Chapter 381: Bloodbath (7)

“What’s the situation, Clan Leader?” a middle-aged man asked with a frown. He was currently standing behind the crowd, dressed in all black, and raised the question upon smelling the blood stench like the rest.

“This...,” the Clan Leader and Elder of the Liuyun Family trailed off.

They had been walking at the front of the group while looking around to assess the situation. They were astonished by the sight ahead.

They glanced across the ground, in the face of tens of dead bodies dressed in white with a black lotus motif. It was obvious that these were members of the Nine Lotus Sect.

When their sight landed on the area beside the cave exit, their faces twitched in shock.

Two grotesque looking bodies lay next to the cave opening. One of them was wearing a white robe embellished with a black lotus motif, and appeared very familiar.

While the other also resembled a close acquaintance.

“It’s the young master of Nine Lotus Sect, plus Fang Huazi, disciple of Elder Feng!” the duo cried out with a heavy look. They scanned around once more. There was no one from the Nine Lotus Sect in sight, only dead bodies of their members.

“These few here?” a voice quizzed.

In reflex, the group looked ahead immediately, and saw a young man pushing a wheelchair while he hovered outside the cave entrance.

He was accompanied by a young maiden in the wheelchair.

The pair was standing by the cave entrance in silence, as if waiting for those inside to come out.

“A sanguinary vibe?” one asked.

“Move along, Liuyun Clan Leader!” the rest of the forces hurried in confusion, as they were further inside the underground cave and hence oblivious to the scene ahead.

With their gazes fixed on Wang Xian and company, the two Elders who donned all-black attire leaped into the air with one move. As they landed above the cave entrance, they guarded against the surroundings in vigilance.

“Clan Leader!” several voices greeted. It came from the members of various forces, as well as several middle-aged men dressed in black robes, as they hurried their way over to meet the Clan Leader.

The disciples of the remaining forces also ran over to receive the experts from their Ancestral Sects.

“What’s the matter?” the two Elders of the Liuyun Family asked their disciples with a burdened look, after a brief glance at Wang Xian and company.

“Clan Leader!” the disciples called out. They eyed Wang Xian and the group in fear, before continuing with their updates on the situation.

“What happened?” one questioned.

“What’s the matter with Nine Lotus’ young master and Miracle Doctor Fang Huazi?” the others chimed in.

Right then, the rest of the forces who were following behind had managed their way out. They shouted at the horrifying sight.

The disciples who had been waiting for them outside the entrance hurried over to narrate what happened.

“What’s the situation? Make way for the Nine Lotus Sect!” an Elder demanded, while his voice boomed with dominance beneath the cave opening.

Hastily, all the forces stepped back to the sides. With a burdened look, they eyed Wang Xian’s group of six. But as they turned back to look at the experts from the Nine Lotus Sect, their eyes glowed. The experts were walking over from the furthest edge of the underground cave.

The news delivered by the group of disciples had simply overwhelmed them.

To think that Miracle Doctor Wang, a mere factionless doctor from Rivertown, had the guts to come all the way here in order to wipe out the Nine Lotus Sect.

They knew that a battle would break out this time, at the tragic sight of the Nine Lotus’ young master and Miracle Doctor Fang Huazi.

“Eh? How come there’s blood stench coming from above? Why? Did some reckless fellow attempt to barge in?” a chubby middle-aged man asked. He had just emerged from the underground cave with all smiles.

“Sect leader!” a weak voice called out. The chubby Elder was slightly puzzled as he turned over. Yet, when he lifted his head to check, the smile on his face vanished.

He looked forth in the direction where the voice had come from.

In an instant, a murderous aura filled the air.

“Shaoling, you ... why have you become like this?!” the plump Elder cried out with a contorted expression. With a single leap, he dashed to the side of the Nine Lotus’ young master as his eyes fumed with fury.

“What happened?” the plump Elder demanded.

“What?” another voice started to ask, upon hearing the commotion.

“Who was it? Who has the audacity to kill my Nine Lotus Sect disciple!” the plump Elder continued.

“Huazi!” The voice who had asked a question before shrieked this time.

As all members of the Nine Lotus Sect emerged from the cave, they were followed by Fang Huazi’s master, the Elder from the Sacred Followers Guild, as well as another Miracle Doctor from their Sect.

When they saw the surrounding scene, their eyes went bloodshot with bellicose howls.

As he growled, the plump Elder turned to face the Nine Lotus’ young master who was on the ground. “Shaoling, who did this? Tell me, who did this? I’ll make sure to tear him to pieces!” he cried with an awful look.

“They’re out!” Wang Xian exclaimed with a smile, as he saw that all members of the Nine Lotus Sect had stepped out from the cave.

“Huh?” the crowd asked in bewilderment as they looked over at Wang Xian, whose voice had drawn their attention.

Elder Feng, who was beside Fang Huazi at the time, looked over immediately upon hearing the voice.

“Rivertown’s Miracle Doctor Wang!” Elder Feng called out in recognition.

Elder Feng’s focus landed on Wang Xian after scanning his group of six. “Is this your doing?” he asked with a narrowed gaze, as it filled with savagery.

“Yep. This is just the beginning. You guys are next!” Wang Xian nodded, before he proceeded to draw his sword.

“How dare you kill my Nine Lotus Sect disciples. I’ll make you wish you were dead!” an Elder snapped upon hearing Wang Xian’s words. He darted over with one leap and began to attack.

With few questions asked, and few details fussed over.

He with the guts to kill the Nine Lotus Sect disciples, and the audacity to land the Youth Leader in such miserable plight, shall die!

“Nine Lotus Sect? I wonder who gave you the courage and audacity to harm my little sister!” Wang Xian retorted. Taking a stance, he sprung forth to meet the Elder heads-on.

“You’re courting doom!” the Elder hollered. With his Inborn-level prowess, he exuded a chilling force of dominance.

“Hmph!” Wang Xian grunted sarcastically, as his sword flashed past.

Pfft!

One strike of the sword. Again, one strike of the sword was all it took. The Elder smacked in Wang Xian’s direction with his palm. But, after the sword struck right back, the Elder’s attack halted to an abrupt stop.

“And the wipeout begins!” Wang Xian announced as he withdrew his sword. With one quick shift, he bolted towards the crowd from the Nine Lotus Sect and began to strike.

“Huh?” the Nine Lotus Sect members uttered with a puzzled look, as they looked on at the Elder who had initiated the attack.

Why had the Elder’s attack halted so abruptly?

Bam!

Under the astonished gaze from the Nine Lotus Sect members and the rest, the Elder’s body crashed onto the floor, while he looked on with enlarged pupils.

Blood gushed out from his neck in copious amounts.

“Killing the Elder with one strike of the sword?” one uttered.

“Oh no!” another cried out in realization.

Upon realizing that their Elder had actually died, everyone from the Nine Lotus Sect looked over at Wang Xian, who was now coming for them as they shrieked in panic. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Kill him!” the Nine Lotus’ Sect Leader ordered, as he glared at Wang Xian with eyes wide.

“Kill!” all the experts from the Nine Lotus Sect chimed in unison. As they aimed at Wang Xian, they lunged forward with their palm-strike.

Pat, pat, pat!

Wang Xian wielded his long sword, and slashed away at the bodies of the Nine Lotus Sect experts with incredible speed.

While he was not versed in swordplay, Wang Xian was backed by his formidable combat powers. Coupled with the boost from his Inborn-level weapon, it was a piece of cake for him to slay those whose abilities were a level below his.

Which made killing the Inborns as easy as slaughtering livestock.

“What? How can it be? How can he be this formidable?” the onlookers gasped. They were astonished by the ease of the young man as he killed an Inborn expert with one strike of his sword.

The ease of defeating the Nine Lotus’ young master may have taken them by surprise. But, given that he had just achieved his Inborn status, defeating him in one move was not impossible.

Yet, right now, even the experienced and reputed Inborn expert had been slain with one strike of the sword.

And in particular, it was the long sword which the young man wielded, which had also begun its massacre on the numerous experts of the Nine Lotus Sect!

Taking them down one after another, one strike at a time!
