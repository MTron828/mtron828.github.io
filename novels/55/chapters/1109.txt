Translator: 5496903

“All citizens, today is the first year of the establishment of the Dragon and Phoenix dynasty. From now on, we will enter the year of the Dragon and Phoenix calendar. Today will be the day of the founding of the National Day

“In the future, I will make the Dragon and Phoenix Dynasty the Dragon and Phoenix Empire, standing at the top of the extraordinary continent. You will be my first batch of citizens. Next, we will lead everyone and create miracles!”

Feng Luan looked at the 1.7 to 8 million people below and smiled. She said calmly as if she was stating a fact!

Everyone below widened their eyes. They looked at the queen who was emitting flames and were in a daze.

This kind of absurd and whimsical thing seemed to be coming true from her mouth.

This made them feel that they might be a little crazy, but they actually believed her words!

“Next, I will quickly transform dragon-phoenix City and build a city guard team!”

“Everyone, please do your own things now!”

After Feng Luan finished speaking, she flew down directly.

Wang Xian followed her back to the mayor’s residence.

“Oh my God, that beauty, no, our queen, she actually built a dynasty in our holy sea town!”

“We can’t call it Holy Sea town anymore, we should call it dragon-phoenix city instead. The array formation the queen brought out is so powerful, and the spiritual energy here is increasing rapidly!”

“It’s not just spiritual energy, I can feel the water energy falling on my body, and now my whole body is feeling very comfortable!”

“Haha, in the future, when our holy sea town has these arrays, the demon beasts and fierce beasts attacking the city are just courting death!”

“Exactly. With our four arrays and Lord Wang’s arrays, even insightful emptiness realm experts can’t do anything to us. Besides, the dragon-phoenix city now can’t even be compared to those big cities in the Empires!”

“Our Queen was brought here by Lord Wang. I wonder what the relationship between Lord Wang and her is!”

“I saw them when they were passing by the city. They seem to be very close to Lord Wang!”

“Alright, Alright. The Queen’s private affairs are not something that we can discuss. We will definitely have good fortune after surviving a great disaster, Haha!”

“In the future, when the academy is established, the insightful emptiness realm expert will be the principal. There will be abundant spiritual energy and strong instructors here. Perhaps my child will also be able to become a hero like Lord Wang!”

When they saw the queen leave, all the citizens had excited and excited expressions as they started chatting.

As they looked at the sky, they suddenly felt that it was extremely blue and filled with hope.

Especially when the queen said “I am the queen”, it made their blood boil. They had the urge to fight for the queen.

In just a few minutes, Feng Luan had won the hearts of everyone.

“Impressive. As expected of the number one empress of all time!”

Wang Xian looked at Feng Luan with a smile. “Even without me, you can win the hearts of the People!”

“Without you, it would be much more troublesome!”

Feng Luan shook her head.

If she were to attack a city, the city Lord’s mansion would definitely gather the entire city’s strength to defend the city.

If someone was defending the city, she would have to kill the person defending the city.

Once someone was killed, the family members of the person defending the city would resent her.

Even if she were to take out so many treasures, it would still cause the family members who died defending the city to resent her. They might even take revenge!

And here, with Wang Xian around, the hearts of the people were united. She only took out some treasures and gathered the hearts of the people.

In front of the people who had experienced despair, she was naturally extremely grateful.

A large part of the reason was still because of Wang Xian!

“I’ll return in a while. You guys stand still. I’m going to officially enter the transcendence continent!”

Wang Xian looked at Feng Luan and said with fighting spirit in his eyes.

“Okay. Call me when you’ve migrated over. I’ll go meet Sister Shu Qing and the rest!”

Feng Luan nodded.

“Okay!”

Wang Xian smiled.

“Here are the remaining pills. Take them!”

Feng Luan gave him the remaining pills from the sale of the half-step void interpretation bloodline.

Wang Xian stretched out his hand and took them. A smile appeared on his face. “Alright, I’m leaving. Be careful of the Star Moon Kingdom!”

“Yes, the star-moon kingdom will not mobilize all their forces just because of a town!”

Feng Luan nodded at him.

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian shouted softly. With a move of his body, he flew directly to the location of the Earth’s passageway.

Ao Jian and the group of strange demons immediately followed behind.

Feng Luan looked at Wang Xian’s figure and revealed a smile.

“Empress, young master Wang’s subordinates have all made breakthroughs in just half a month. It’s especially so for those kinds of creatures. It’s absolutely easy for them to assassinate martial artists who are at level nine of the extraordinary realm!”

“The one who combines light and darkness has reached the peak below the void interpretation realm!”

The old lady looked at Wang Xian’s figure and whispered.

“Xiao Yun, I might not be able to return to the peak in the future history of the transcendence continent, but he will definitely be able to stand at the peak of the transcendence continent and be worshipped by all races!”

Feng Luan’s eyes flickered as she said.

“Oh?”

A trace of shock appeared in the old woman’s eyes. This was the first time she had heard the empress say such words.

She looked at the gradually disappearing figure in astonishment and a smile appeared on her face. “If he is really like what the Empress said, then this young master Wang will help you return to Your Peak!”

“I want to do it myself!”

Feng Luan’s face revealed a resolute expression, followed by a valiant smile as she went to deal with the problem of Dragon Phoenix city.

“I wonder what Shu Qing and the rest are doing? Are they still in seclusion? This is the longest time I have been away!”

Wang Xian smiled and entered the ocean.

“Eh?”

When Wang Xian was about to reach the passageway, he was astonished.

With a thought, he flew to the left.

“That’s AO qitian!”

Wang Xian looked over and saw Ao Qitian and Ba Qi attacking a five-headed giant squid that was at transcendent-level five.

Ao Qitian and Ba Qi were both at transcendent-level four. However, due to their blood barbarians, there was no problem for them to fight above their level.

The five-headed giant squid was about to be killed by them.

“Dragon King!”

“Dragon King!”

Ao Qitian and Ba Qi also sensed Wang Xian’s arrival. They turned around and shouted excitedly. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Not bad. Let’s go. Let’s go back first!”

Wang Xian looked at them with satisfaction on his face.

The last time they returned to the Dragon Palace, he had asked Prime Minister Gui to send people into the transcendence continent to hunt ferocious beasts. Based on Ao Qitian and Ba Qi’s abilities, their gains were not bad.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

The two of them nodded respectfully. They put away the corpses of the five giant squid and swam toward the passage.

“This time around, it’s time for the Dragon Palace to conquer the extraordinary mainland!”

Wang Xian moved his body and returned to the Dragon Palace through the passage.

He was familiar with the Dragon Palace and was surrounded by the water tribe cultivators. This made him smile.

He slowly walked to the Dragon King’s palace.

“Greetings, Dragon King!”

The water tribe members who had learned of his arrival stood respectfully at the Dragon King’s Palace and shouted loudly.
