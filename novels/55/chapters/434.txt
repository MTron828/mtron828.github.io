Chapter 435: Saints and Saintesses

“Have Xiao Yu and the rest arrived?”

The next day morning, Wang Xian asked Guan Shuqing, who was talking to Xiao Yu on the phone.

“Yes, they just reached the hotel, and they are having breakfast with the members of Thistles and Thorns Sect. We’ll meet at the entrance to the Outstanding Young Heroes Competition!”

“Mm, the competition is finally starting today. I can’t wait!”

Wang Xian chuckled as he looked at the restaurant in the hotel. Most of the Martial Artists were younger ones while the older generation was tagging along.

The Outstanding Young Heroes Competition is not child’s play, and it is normal to sustain injuries or get killed in the competition.

“The competition this year is fu*king crazy. I thought I could get into the top 20 since I’m a Level 9 Martial Artist. Now, there’s no chance at all!”

“To get into top 20, you must be at least a Half-step to Inborn, or a supreme-class Half-step to Inborn. Guess who I saw just now? Saint Qi and Saint Wen from the Sacred Sect, Dark Sect. Gosh, the number of young talents at Inborn Levels have almost reached ten.”

“Based on past experience, there will be many formidable disciples from the Sacred Clans and Sacred Sects. Only Heavenly Sound Sect, Xiao Clan, and Dark Sect showed up now. I think there will be another three to four Saint-class forces showing up. Besides, the Saint-class forces will definitely send their Saintess and Saint to the Outstanding Young Heroes Competition this year.”

“Apart from those Saint-class forces, the disciples of first-class forces would not be weak either. They are at least a half-step to Pinnacle Inborn!”

“The main characters for this chart this year will be those demon-like disciples and the Saintesses and Saints from Saint-class forces. The rest can just sit back and watch the show!”

“This year, we can only sit around and watch. Dig in. We need to get there soon!”

At this time, several young men walked over and placed their swords on the table while exchanging conversations with a sullen look.

Disciples from insignificant sects like them were not eligible to fight with the Saintesses and Saints.

“Let’s go!” said Wang Xian to Guan Shuqing and the rest after taking a look at those young men.

“Xiao Xian, will you be participating this time?” asked Lan Qingyue to Wang Xian.

Wang Xian had recovered, but even he was unsure how strong he was now.

“Nope!”

Wang Xian shook his head and headed to Huashan. They arrived at the entrance where they held the Outstanding Young Heroes Competition.

“We’ll wait here for a while. Xiao Yu will be here soon!” Guan Shuqing said as they arrived at a stone staircase at the side.

It was crowded with all the Martial Artists from around the country. All of them were in high spirits as they marched inside.

Some of the Martial Artists stood at the entrance, observing those young Martial Artists who entered.

“That’s him. That monk who is extremely gruesome. He lacks the benevolence of a monk. Yesterday, a first-class force provoked him, and he just annihilated them straightaway. The Sect Leader, who was an Inborn Expert, was killed!”

“This monk possessed the strength to be crowned as the champion among the younger generation.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

The surroundings broke out with exclamations when everyone turned to look at the monk in his robe.

Wang Xian checked him out with curiosity. A fair-looking monk in his kasaya. He had no burn marks, but rather, an odd-looking pattern on his head. Instead of serenity, he exhibited more of an evil vibe.

The monk arched his lips as he walked in with an evil, yet charming smile.

“They’re here. That palanquin!”

At this time, a vintage sedan was carried in by four young men. No one could see the profile of that person inside the sedan.

“Haha, is that a babe in the sedan?”

Just then, a harsh and manly voice was heard from behind. Four young men were on the heels of that sedan. They were teasing loudly with their lips quirked as they looked over.

The one in the lead was riding a lion whose fur was thick. His imposing eyes were gazing around with a vibe of a lion king that was simply unapproachable.

Another three young men were riding leopards with two golden birds standing on one of their shoulders.

“Sss, they are the disciples from the Imperial Beast Sect, Sacred Sect. That must be the Roaring Lion, which is an Inborn Spiritual Beast. Scary!”

“What a surprise to see the Imperial Beast Sect this year. In the past few years, they did not send any disciples over.”

“A sedan carried by four Half-step to Inborns and the disciples of Sacred Sect riding Inborn Spiritual Beasts. This is getting scarier!”

The crowd looked over with shock.

The four young men who were carrying the sedan paused for a moment and headed inside without much bother.

The young men from Imperial Beast Sect did not say anything as they rode the powerful Inborn Spiritual Beasts inside.

“The Saintess of Heavenly Sound Sect is here!”

“She’s beautiful. She really lives up to the name of the Saintess of Heavenly Sound Sect.”

“Not only is the Saintess of Heavenly Sound Sect pretty, but her voice is also intoxicating. I hope she can be crowned as the champion!”

Just then, Heavenly Sound Sect’s disciples with their musical instruments at their backs walked in. The crowd was looking at them with an obsession.

“She advanced to Inborn Realm in such a short time. It looks like she was given a lot of resources after she was promoted to Saintess!”

Upon seeing the popular Tang Yinxuan carrying the Zither of Hao Zhong behind her, Wang Xian revealed a faint smile on his face.

As if sensing his gaze, Tang Yinxuan peered in his direction. After seeing Wang Xian, she slightly froze before she drew a smile.

“Wow, wow! The Saintess is smiling at me. Did you see it? Did you see it?”

A young man at the side was elated.

“Pretty?”

Guan Shuqing and Lan Qingyue stood on his left and right with their death stares on him.

“Oh, that Roaring Lion is really overbearing!”

Without a change in his expression, Wang Xian continued.

“You do have a strong desire to survive!”

“Qiao Clan, Sacred Clan is here!”

“See, it’s another Inborn. Damn it. There are more than ten young Inborn Experts!”

“Are the Outstanding Five Devil Dragons here? If they are here, they will add on to the number of young Inborn Experts!”

“If Outstanding Five Devil Dragons and Dragon Seven Stars are here, it will be damn interesting. They’ll just add up to another 12 Inborn Experts!”

“I wonder where did they come from. They are just too imba. I heard all of them were very powerful.”

Everyone around chipped in their comments.

“They are here, disciples of Hua Family, Medical Saint Sect. Another Inborn Existence!”

“The current Clan Leader of Xiao Clan, Xiao Ran, is here too.”

“Gosh, is he the current most talented teenager? He’s so young!”

Xiao Ran, Clan Leader of Xiao Clan, Tang Yinxuan, Saintess of Heavenly Sound Sect, Hua Mingshan from Medical Saint Sect, Shi Ming from Imperial Beast Sect, Qiao Fuzi from Qiao Clan and Saint Qi and Saint Wen from Dark Sect.

The current most outstanding disciples of the six Saint-class forces.

On top of that, there was Flower Monk, a mysterious person in the sedan, the young man with the golden fan, and Hai Long, the young overlord.

That would make ten of them. If they added up the supreme talents from last year and those that were still hidden, there would be more than a dozen Inborn Experts.

Considering those new emerging people in the Underworld lately like the Outstanding Five Devil Dragons and Dragon Seven Stars, that made more than a score of Inborn supreme talents battling for the championship!
