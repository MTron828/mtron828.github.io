Chapter 1623: 1623, the Alliance of the three great superpowers

“Who’s up there, come down immediately!”

At the city walls of the dragon-phoenix Imperial City, more than ten profound void martial experts flew directly into the sky.

They stared vigilantly at the people of Wuqing City who were flying towards them in the sky, and shouted loudly.

“Wuji Imperial Court, Wuqing City, come to pay respects to the dragon-phoenix Empress!”

Standing on top of the proud sons, Wuqing City said indifferently.

“Wuji Empire’s crown prince, Wuqing City?”

The dozens of void interpretation experts guarding the city wall sized up the people of Wuqing City and then extended their hands to invite them, “Please!”

“Please take me to meet Empress Dragon and Phoenix!”

Wuqing city said directly to them.

“Yes!”

The leader in the center nodded. The Crown Prince of Wuji Empire had come in person, so he must have something important!

“Your Majesty, the Crown Prince of Wuji Empire requests to see you!”

In the Dragon Palace of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire, Feng Luan, Guan Shuqing, and the other girls were sitting in the back garden.

Feng Luan was surprised when she heard the report from the maid.

“Wu Qingcheng is here? Tell him to wait in the Imperial Study!”

Feng Luan said directly and walked toward the imperial study.

“Empress Dragon and Phoenix!”

Entering the imperial study, Wu Qing city cupped his hands towards Feng Luan.

“I wonder why the Crown Prince of Wu Qing city is here?”

Feng Luan sat down and gestured at him.

The relationship between the Dragon and Phoenix Empire and Wu Ji Empire wasn’t bad, but it definitely wasn’t good either!

When the two countries interacted, it was basically for the sake of benefits.

“Empress Dragon and Phoenix, there are two things that Wu Qing city is here for!”

“The first reason is that priest Wang once saved my life. I, Wuqing City, am a grateful person. I would like to pay my respects to priest Wang!”

Wuqing city said in a neither servile nor overbearing manner.

“There’s no need to pay my respects, and I can’t pay my respects either!”

Feng Luan shook her head. “Crown prince of Wuqing City, just tell me the second reason!”

“That’s really a pity. There aren’t many people that Wuqing City admires in our lifetime. The younger generation even looks down on all heroes. Only priest Wang commands my respect!”

Wu Qing Cheng shook his head regretfully. “The second thing is that we have something to discuss with Empress Dragon Phoenix on behalf of our Wuji Empire!”

“Oh? What is it?”

Feng Luan asked curiously.

“Our Wuji Empire has been on good terms with the life and Death Pill Workshop and the holy item forging workshop for generations. This time, the two major forces have come to beg us!”

“They hope that the Dragon Phoenix Empire can remove the restrictions on them. They hope that the market can be handed over to them!”

Wu Qing Cheng continued.

His words caused Feng Luan’s pupils to constrict slightly, and a trace of coldness flashed in her eyes.

“This is the decision of your Wuji Empire?”

Feng Luan stared at Wu Qing Cheng and directly asked.

“Oh?”

Wu Qing Cheng felt Feng Luan’s gaze and was startled. He slowly puffed out his chest and said, “We have been entrusted by the two great forces of the transcendent continent to come here to mediate!”

“What if we can’t mediate?”

Feng Luan said indifferently.

“Then? Then I don’t know either!”

Wu Qing Cheng pursed his lips and pondered for a moment before continuing, “The life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop are, after all, the most powerful forces in the entire continent!”

“There are dozens of half-step void interpretation rank nine experts and two longevity experts. It’s not wise to make an enemy of such a force!”

“Our Wuji Empire also came to remind us out of kindness to avoid making a big mistake!”

He said slowly.

“Hehe!”

Feng Luan smiled. “Since we dare to drive the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop out of the domain, we naturally know them well!”

“In the vast area, as long as your Wuji Empire doesn’t make an enemy of us, the two major forces of the extraordinary continent can’t do anything to us!”

“Even if they join forces with the lone sect and the southern Royal Family!”

As Feng Luan spoke, she slowly drank a mouthful of tea and looked at Wu Qing Cheng indifferently.

Upon hearing her words, Wu Qing Cheng’s expression was somewhat unnatural.

“Since Empress Dragon Phoenix has already made up her mind, there’s nothing Qing Cheng Can Do!”

Wu Qing Cheng stood up and cupped his hands. “However, I still have to remind the empress that the two major forces are, after all, the top forces of the entire continent. We can’t afford to offend them!”

“Farewell!”

As he spoke, he directly walked out.

Feng Luan watched Wu Qingcheng leave, her eyes shining.

“Call Prime Minister Gui and Qing Yue over. There’s something important to discuss!”

Feng Luan said to the old woman at the side.

“It’s the Empress!”

Soon, Prime Minister Gui, Lan Qingyue, and the others came over. After hearing Feng Luan’s words, all of their faces revealed solemn expressions.

“The only sect, the southern royal family, and the Wuji Dynasty, the three super forces, have a total of five experts at level nine of the profound void tier!” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Right now, only the Dragon Queen and the Phoenix Emperor have reached level nine of the profound void tier. If the Wuji dynasty really makes a move against us, we’ll be in trouble!”

The worst thing had happened. The intervention of the Wuji dynasty could completely change the situation of the entire vast region in an instant!

“Then what should we do now?”

Lan Qingyue asked with a frown.

“Little Xian hasn’t resurrected yet. Even if she does, we are still at a disadvantage!”

“Once the Wuji dynasty really makes a move, we can only retreat back to the flowing sea region!”

Feng Luan said with a gloomy face.

The great situation was going to be completely ruined because of the life and Death Pill Workshop, the holy item forging workshop, and the Wuji dynasty!

“It would be great if the Dragon King could be resurrected. In this way, we can move the Dragon Palace to the Sea of desolation. Even if they join forces, we will still be invincible!”

Prime Minister Gui said with a frown.

“It should be soon. According to the news from the Dragon Palace, Little Xian’s dragon body has begun to recover!”

Lan qingyue looked at Feng Luan. “Let’s prepare for the worst first. At most, we can endure for two more years. When we come back, we will destroy all three major forces in the vast region!”

“That’s the only way!”

Feng Luan nodded, feeling somewhat unwilling.

The Fire Cloud Sparrow had already started a war with the two major forces. With its strength, it was definitely at a disadvantage.

What it wanted in exchange was a stable development. However, it didn’t expect such a result.

The Dragon and Phoenix Empire had no choice but to prepare for their escape.

Feng Luan even rushed to the flowing sea region overnight, converting the resources in her hands into her own strength.

In the Wuji Empire, three days later, Wu Qing city sent the answer from the Dragon and Phoenix Empire.

This answer didn’t make the Wuji Empire angry. Instead, a smile appeared on their face.

“Raise a peak-stage rank 8 void interpretation expert to rank 9 void interpretation!”

“Contact the solipsistic sect and the southern royal family. We’ll accept all the territories of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire. If you agree, we’ll agree too!”

The two conditions were passed on to the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop.

In the end, the two large forces gritted their teeth and agreed.

If they lost a place like this vast region, their businesses would be cut off by one-fifth.

If they cut off their source of income, they would definitely kill them!
