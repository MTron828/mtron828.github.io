Chapter 1324: 1325, help me ascend to the crown prince position

The princes stood there in an orderly fashion.

Behind them were their respective powerful forces.

They faced the direction of the Light Dragon Dynasty’s king and a group of ministers.

A few old men from the jury sat in a row, and the white-haired old man stood up and asked everyone.

In everyone’s eyes, today’s crown prince selection was just a formality, a process that had to be gone through.

Regardless of whether it was the light dragon dynasty or the outside forces, they all had a clear idea of the crown prince’s position.

That was long Xiaotian!

No crown prince was stronger than him, and no one was his match.

The crown prince’s position was well deserved.

Even the white-haired elder of the judging panel didn’t object to that sentence? It was just a formality!

When he said that, all the princes stood there with ugly expressions.

Object? With what object?

However, just when everyone thought that it was over, a voice suddenly sounded.

“I object! I, Long Xiaoyun, object!”

This sentence, with a hint of anger and arrogance, directly resounded in the sky.

Everyone around was stunned, be it the various major forces of the Light Dragon dynasty or the people who had come to watch the ceremony.

Even the king of the Light Dragon Dynasty on the stage had a surprised look on his face.

Everyone looked towards the entrance.

“That’s it!”

When everyone looked over, their eyes widened and shock appeared on their faces.

Even the king of the Light Dragon Dynasty had a surprised look in his eyes.

Compared to Long Xiaoyun in the past, he looked much thinner and thinner, and his hair looked much longer.

However, the confidence and dominance he exuded was dozens of times more than before.

Behind him was a group of people, thousands of people.

They were wearing aqua-blue clothes. Some held scepters in their hands, and some held ice swords in their hands.

On their chests, there was a big word ‘Han’!

“Why are they from the Frost sect? Why are they following the eighth Prince!”

“Didn’t the eighth Prince enter the Origin Light Dragon Pool? He actually came out, and judging from the eighth Prince’s strength, he seems to have made a huge breakthrough!”

“Oh my God, how did the Frost sect get mixed up with the eighth prince? Could it be...”

The faces of the various factions and families in the light dragon dynasty were filled with shock as they stared at the eighth prince who was walking towards them.

Long Xiaotian frowned and looked at Long Xiaoyun.

The Frost sect was a powerful sect in the Light Dragon Dynasty. It was not under the control of the Light Dragon Dynasty.

The Frost sect was very powerful. At least the Light Dragon dynasty would not touch them easily.

The sect master was at the fourth level of the insightful void tier. There were four or five at the third level of the insightful void tier. As for the first and second level of the insightful void tier, there were more than thirty of them.

The cold sect was located at Mount Han, which was at the border of the Light Dragon Dynasty.

The Light Dragon dynasty had always wanted to subdue it, but the cold sect had never yielded.

But on the surface, the cold sect was very respectful to the Light Dragon Dynasty, and they did many things to give the Light Dragon dynasty face.

As time passed, the Light Dragon dynasty did not force the cold sect to obey.

“Could the eighth Prince of the Light Dragon Dynasty have roped in the people of the cold sect to fight for the position of Crown Prince?”

“This is interesting. I thought that the second Prince would definitely inherit the position of crown prince. Who would have thought that an eighth prince would suddenly appear out of nowhere!”

Some of the forces in the Liuhai region who came to observe the ceremony were curious when they saw the eighth prince strolling onto the stage.

“HMM? Xiaoyun, you said that you object?”

The white-haired elder from the judging panel stared at the eighth prince who had suddenly appeared out of nowhere and asked in surprise.

“That’s right, I object!”

Long Xiaoyun walked to the front of Wang Xian with a face full of confidence.

“The position of crown prince. In terms of individual strength and the forces under him, he, Long Xiaotian, is inferior to me in terms of two years of battle results!”

As Long Xiaoyun spoke, his gaze was fixed on Long Xiaotian as he roared loudly with a cold face.

“Eighth brother, just because the Frost sect supports you doesn’t mean that they are your forces. The true forces are able to obey you and obey your orders. I don’t know what agreement you have reached with the Frost sect, but... “You are obviously not in line with the rules!” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Long Xiaotian frowned slightly and glanced at the thousand-odd people of Frost sect with an embarrassed expression.

The thousand-odd people of Frost sect and almost all the experts had been mobilized.

The sect master of Frost sect, a group of insightful emptiness realm experts, had at least thirty people.

Faced with so many experts, Long Xiaotian’s expression also didn’t look good.

He didn’t expect that the eighth prince who had entered the Origin Light Dragon Pond would actually directly charge out, and even bring the people of Frost sect with him.

However, the support of a powerful force didn’t represent one’s own force.

“Haha, Haha!”

Long Xiaoyun suddenly laughed wildly when he heard his words. His eyes were full of excitement. “Disciples of the Frost sect, Listen Up!”

“Yes, my Lord!”

He directly raised his arm and shouted.

Behind him, under everyone’s shocked eyes, including the sect master of the Frost sect, he directly half-knelt on the ground and shouted loudly.

“What?”

Long Xiaotian widened his eyes and stared at this scene in disbelief.

The few princes beside him also widened their eyes, their faces filled with shock.

The Frost sect, this was the Frost sect, a powerful sect that even the light dragon dynasty could not subdue.

Now, even the sect master of the Frost sect, a fourth level profound void martial expert, was kneeling in front of the eighth prince.

He was kneeling right there, and an expert was kneeling. This represented submission.

Otherwise, with his pride and status as an expert, he would never kneel before a weakling.

“What? Everyone in the Frost sect actually respects the eighth Prince!”

“Oh my God, how could the eighth prince subdue the Frost sect? This... This is simply unbelievable!”

“If the eighth Prince really subjugates the Frost sect, then the position of crown prince will belong to the eighth Prince!”

Everyone around, be it the various major powers that had come to watch the ceremony, the royal family of the Light Dragon dynasty, or the various ministers and generals, exclaimed in shock.

“This... Xiaoyun, Xiaoyun actually... actually subjugated frigidsect. Haha, this is simply too good, too good!”

Long Xiaoyun’s mother, Long Xiaoyun’s mother’s family, trembled with excitement when they saw this scene.

They never expected that their son, who was supposed to die in the origin light dragon pool, would actually return as a king.

He led a powerful force and came directly.

Some were happy while others were worried!

“How is this possible? How is this possible? Why would the people of the Frost sect listen to the orders of a little guy? This... this...”

Long Xiaotian’s grandfather, who was sitting beside Wang Xian, looked at this scene with an extremely embarrassed expression. His face was filled with disbelief.

Everyone from the Hua clan also looked extremely embarrassed.

Wang Xian also raised his eyebrows slightly. His eyes were flickering as he stared ahead.

People from the Frost sect?

Wang Xian was even prepared to destroy the Frost sect before he left!

“My subordinates from the Frost sect, help me ascend to the position of Crown Prince!”

At this moment, Long Xiaoyun’s gaze swept across the surroundings. An arrogant expression appeared on his face as he shouted loudly.

“Yes!”

A shout filled with majesty directly resounded through the sky!
