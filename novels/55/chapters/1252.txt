Chapter 1253: How dare she show off with such strength?

Translator: 5496903

Qian ye’s famous weapon was the lancet. There were a total of 18 of them, and each of them was a weapon at the half-step void interpretation level.

When all 18 of them were combined, the attack that they could unleash would definitely not be inferior to a weapon at the first level of the void interpretation level. In fact, it might even be a little stronger.

However, when those lancet blades touched Wang Xian’s radiant sun, they were like glass that had been burnt and broke apart.

“What?”

When Qian ye saw that her lancet blades were shattered, she widened her eyes. Her eyes were filled with disbelief.

The Radiant Sun charged forward like a black hole. It attacked Qian Ye.

Qian ye’s expression changed drastically.

“Storm Attack!”

He growled and a terrifying storm appeared around him. It attacked the black light.

Boom! Boom! Boom

The collision of the two energies produced an explosive sound. The power of the storm attack was quickly melted by the black light.

It was as though the entire world had been cleansed and turned into darkness.

Qian Ye’s eyes widened and her body could not help but tremble.

“Water tomb!”

At this moment, Wang Xian waved the longsword in his hand once again and a black ocean appeared under Qian Ye’s feet!

“Get lost!”

Qian ye roared furiously as she looked at the pitch-black liquid that looked like an abyss below. She looked at the sun that had broken through the storm and let out a roar.

A terrifying gust of wind and waves was emitted from his body. The surrounding air seemed to be stirred by this gust of wind and waves.

As the sun was blocked, the water tomb below began to fluctuate rapidly!

“Get lost. Do you really think you are so superior?”

At this moment, Wang Xian’s cold voice came from below. He looked over and his expression changed drastically.

Earth burial entwining, an attack with the combination of wood and earth attributes.

However, after Wang Xian’s deeper understanding of the combination of attributes, earth burial entwining this time had undergone a huge change.

The soil was wrapped around the thorns and coiled around Qian ye’s legs like a poisonous snake. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Qian ye’s expression changed drastically. With a wave of her arm, streaks of extremely sharp wind rays slashed towards the thorns.

However, his ordinary attacks were completely useless against Wang Xian’s combined attacks.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

The thorns that were covered by the Earth attribute wound around one of Qian Ye’s legs in the sky.

Wang Xian pulled gently. The terrifying strength instantly left him in shock.

“Three spirits battle armor, cover!”

The three spirits battle armor was a combination of water, wood, and earth. It was Wang Xian’s only defensive combination of battle skills.

The three spirits battle armor could not only cover his entire body, but it could also cover other places.

Wang Xian’s arm shook slightly. The three spirits battle armor covered the thorny thorns directly.

Qian ye struggled with all her might, but the thorny thorns did not move at all. This caused a look of horror to appear in his eyes.

“Bang!”

Under the immense strength of Wang Xian, his body crashed heavily onto the ground, causing Qian Ye to spit out fresh blood. His head was in a Daze!

“A guy who has just stepped into the insightful emptiness realm and is weaker than the two insightful emptiness realm experts that I killed. How dare he speak arrogantly in front of me?”

“How dare he act arrogantly in front of me? How dare he make me submit?”

Wang Xian held the thorn with one hand and his disdainful voice resonated in the arena.

“You You...”

Qian Ye, who was stunned by Wang Xian’s attack, revealed a blood-red expression. “Go to hell!”

“Dharma Idol, Wind Spirit Blade God!”

He roared again and his entire body was covered by a blade-shaped green wind energy.

Qian ye was like a terrifying lancet. With a wave of his arm, he conjured another lancet and slashed at the thorn that was tied to his leg.

“Bang!”

The sound of the collision rang out. However, the result left him dumbfounded.

“How... how is this possible...”

An unbelievable trembling voice came from his throat.

“Trash, your superior appearance is totally incompatible with your strength!”

Wang Xian stood there and looked at him quietly.

With his current strength, it was a piece of cake for him to kill Qian Ye.

Even if he were to use his dharma idol, it wouldn’t pose any threat to him.

Swoosh

At this moment, Wang Xian pulled the thorn in his hand gently again. His entire body flew towards him uncontrollably.

“Die, die, die!”

Qian ye listened to Wang Xian’s taunt and watched as his body was pulled over. Her face was filled with fear. She waved her arms in fear and slashed towards the Thorn.

The Dharma Idol Wind Spirit Blade God. This was his dharma idol, his strongest attack.

When his Dharma Idol was activated, he transformed into the willow leaf blade god. With a wave of his arm, a terrifying and sharp wind blade appeared.

However, his attack was completely useless when it landed on the thorns.

A look of despair appeared on his face. He was a little crazy and found it hard to accept.

He was an existence at the top of The Prodigy roll. He was a peerless prodigy who had reached the profound void tier at the age of forty-nine.

Now, in the hands of this nameless sword demon, he actually did not have the strength to resist at all.

“Pa!”

“What else do you have to say!”

Right at this moment, a long sword was placed on his neck. In front of him was a mask.

It was as light as the wind and clouds!

Thousand leaves widened her eyes. Her face was covered in cold sweat. In fact, her entire body was covered in sweat.

“Boom!”

“I... I...”

“This... this...”

At that moment, it was as if a soundless rumble of thunder resounded in the minds of everyone around the arena.

They even wanted to roar, but they felt as if their throats were being choked.

How could this be?

How long had it been?

The battle between Qian Ye and the nameless sword demon had not even lasted a minute!

However, in just a few short seconds...

Qian Ye!

The leader of the Thousand Shadows mercenary group!

The champion of The Prodigy roll!

However, in the battle just now, he did not have the slightest ability to resist. He even used his strongest attack, his dharma idol, but it was still useless.

At this moment, the nameless sword demon’s long sword was placed on his neck. His face was filled with fear and fear.

“How can the gap be so huge? How can the nameless sword demon be so strong? He is only 26 years old!”

When some insightful void martial artists saw this scene, they also gulped. Their faces were filled with shock.

“Are you going to kill yourself, or do you want me to help you?”

Wang Xian stared at Qian ye with a mocking expression and said faintly to her.

Humiliation, blatant humiliation!

Are you going to kill yourself, or do I have to help you? !

Just like what Qian ye said to Wang Xian earlier, there was a difference between not surrendering.

Disdain and mockery.

However, it was now Qian Ye’s turn.

“No, no... Don’t kill me...”

Qian ye looked at the longsword that was right in front of her and said with a trembling voice.

He was a heaven’s favorite with a bright future. He wasn’t willing to die just like that.

He wasn’t willing!

“Why don’t I Kill You?”

Wang Xian looked at him indifferently and asked.

“Please, please don’t kill me. I’ll apologize to you. I’ll apologize to you!”

He shouted at once!

He no longer had the heroic spirit he had earlier. He no longer had the imposing manner of a ruler!
