Chapter 791: 0792 opening crisis

Translator: 549690339

The first large-scale auction in Jianghu, the Dragon Gate auction, had ended.

This auction caused a great sensation on the Jianghu website.

There were twelve immortal gods present, and some of them had reached the half-step infant realm, or they had enough spirit stones to enter the venue.

The entry requirements for the participation of immortal gods were extremely high, making this auction much more pretentious.

In particular, there were twelve immortal gods who came and participated in the auction. The standard was very high.

“Twelve immortal gods competing for five immortal God weapons, and a group of Heaven’s favorites competing for the spirit weapon set. The highest price of one immortal God weapon reached 1,650,000 spirit stones. This is crazy!”

“The Dragon Gate auction house has completely succeeded this time. The next auction will be held in two months. When that time comes, I’m afraid there will be even more experts going over!”

“Each and every spiritual weapon and medicinal pill is a precious treasure to every martial artist. Unfortunately, there are too many competitors. A Grade-7 medicinal pill will be fought over by dozens of infant realm experts and even half-step immortal gods!”

“This time, there are more than forty items being auctioned. Every item that is taken out will attract a fight for it, and even a life and death fight. and the Dragon Gate has taken out so many at once. I don’t dare to imagine how rich the Dragon Gate is!”

“Tomorrow morning at 10 am, the eight shops of the Dragon Gate forging workshop will open at the same time. At that time, they will sell grade-12 spiritual weapons and Grade-7 medicinal pills. They will also be used to refine pills and weapons. Damn it, I don’t have the qualifications to go to the auction. Tomorrow, I will be the first one to enter the Dragon Gate Forging Workshop!”

“In the future, the Dragon Gate will very likely monopolize the refining of medicinal pills and weapons. However, based on the price that the Dragon Gate has offered, the Dragon Gate is welcome to monopolize it!”

“Whether it is the refining of medicinal pills or spiritual weapons, the price of the Dragon Gate is simply too cheap. It is even cheaper than the refining of our immortal gate elders. Tomorrow, bring all of my family assets to the Dragon Gate Forging Workshop!”

The end of the Dragon Gate auction caused a great sensation. At this time, Mo Qinglong also officially announced that the Dragon Gate forging workshop would officially open for business tomorrow.

As soon as this news was released, it instantly attracted the attention of the entire jianghu. All the disciples of the Immortal Gate, even some immortals, were prepared to go.

On the same night, martial artists were already heading to the city where the Jiang City and the other seven Longmen forging workshop were located.

As the opening of the shop was relatively close to the area of a cauldron, it wouldn’t be so troublesome.

After Wang Xian’s strength increased, he smiled when he saw the information on the Jianghu website. The success of the Longmen forging workshop was just around the corner.

...

At this moment, on the towering mountain peak covered by plants in the Yao Ding.

In the palace, two people who were completely shrouded in shadows were standing at the entrance. Their black eyes were staring at the group of Immortals and deities in front of them.

“Make Your move tomorrow. Out of the eight shops, you have to destroy at least three of them!”

An old man in a green robe and an old man in fiery red clothes stood in the middle and spoke to the two shadowy figures.

“It’s very easy. The opening day tomorrow will be the day we become ruins. Don’t worry about us, Sly Thorn, doing things!”

A voice came from the Shadow Man’s mouth. His tone was calm, as if to them, it was a very simple matter.

“Alright then. As long as it’s completed, we will send the reward on time!”

The old man in green robes nodded and spoke to the two shadow men.

“Alright!”

The two black shadows nodded and slowly disappeared.

The Immortals of the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect looked at each other when they saw the two leaving.

“We will directly destroy the shop closest to our Xia Ding. We will destroy it openly. The members of Dragon Gate will be killed immediately. In addition, we will send people to destroy at least two more shops!”

In the deepest part of the hall, an elder with a fat face slowly walked out and ordered.

“It’s the Grand Supreme!”

“In addition, we must be prepared for the Dragon Gate’s revenge. However, this is a battle between a cat and a mouse. If they want revenge, we can make use of it to ambush them!”

“Hehe. Those who provoked us, the Holy Doctors, the holy medicines, and the immortal sects, will know how terrifying the price they will have to pay!”

“This time, we will play with the Dragon Gate to the end. Tomorrow, we will make the Dragon Gate the laughingstock of the entire jianghu. Haha, as long as we are here, it will never be possible for us to monopolize the pill refining and artifact refining!”

The Holy Doctor Holy Medicine Immortal sect and the other immortals laughed confidently.

As a powerful immortal sect that had been passed down for a thousand years, when they showed their fangs, it would definitely shake the entire jianghu!

Tomorrow, it would be the time for their Holy Medicine and Holy Medicine Immortal sect to suppress all the immortal sects!

A crisis regarding the Dragon Gate forging workshop had already arrived.

The next morning, Wang Xian and a group of girls walked towards the Dragon Gate forging workshop on the Ancient Street.

Early in the morning, the entrance of the Dragon Gate forging workshop was filled with decorative items such as flowers.

The plaque of the Dragon Gate forging workshop was hung up. The entire Dragon Gate forging workshop had been modified by the puppet immortal sect. It was a very luxurious shop.

Wang Xian and a group of girls entered the shop. The shop assistants were all ordinary people who were responsible for the sale of elixirs.

On the rooftop, four members of the Dragon Gate were guarding the safety of the items in the shop.

Four nascent Soul Realm Warriors. The power of guarding the shop was sufficient!

“Dragon King, Congratulations on the opening of the Dragon Gate Forging Workshop!”

Before the opening of the shop, many martial artists who were waiting for the opening of the shop had gathered in front of the shop. Most of these martial artists were also disciples of the Mingwang Immortal sect and the puppet immortal sect.

At this moment, the voices of the sect masters of the two immortal sects came from outside. A few immortals came over to congratulate them.

“Haha, Congratulations on the opening of the Dragon Gate Forging Workshop!”

A cheerful voice was heard. The two immortals of the Xuan Yuan clan had arrived.

Wang Xian went up to them with a smile. “Thank you, thank you!”

“Dragon King, you guys are going to monopolize all the elixirs and spiritual artifacts in the martial arts world this time. In the future, the Dragon Gate will be really rich. There will be an endless supply of resources!” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

The two immortals from the Xuan Yuan clan said with some envy.

“Haha, if you two want elixirs and spiritual artifacts, you can come to me directly. I’ll give you a bargain!”

“Then, Dragon King, we’ll take it seriously. We came here this time to look for Dragon King to help us refine spiritual artifacts!”

“Then, I thank you for taking care of our business. Leave your spiritual artifacts to us, Dragon Gate!”

Wang Xian laughed and chatted with the five or six immortals.

As the time for the official opening of the shop approached, the number of disciples of the immortal gate at the entrance increased to a few thousand.

This was not only the case in Jiang City. It was the same in other cities as well.

Before the opening of the shop, there were already more than a thousand disciples of the Immortal Gate waiting outside.

The opening of the Dragon Gate forging workshop was something that many disciples had been looking forward to for a long time.

However, among the crowd of people in the city, there were many people with strange gazes staring at the shop in front of them with smiles on their faces.

In a city next to Xia ding, the experts of the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect slowly surrounded the dragon gate forging workshop.
