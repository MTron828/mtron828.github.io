Translator: 5496903

“What’s going on? The amethyst mercenary group actually beat up the captain of tornado for the sake of that freshman!”

“I don’t know. But now, it seems that Wang Xian has hooked up with the amethyst mercenary group!”

“Captain Zhang seemed to have mentioned that Wang Xian had helped them on the Thunder Island!”

“Now that the amethyst mercenary group is actually protecting Wang Xian, doesn’t that mean that they are going to be enemies with the young master’s mercenary group?”

“This is complicated. Who would have thought that the brat has such a good relationship with the amethyst mercenary group? I wonder what the young master’s mercenary group Will Do!”

After sweeping a glance at everyone around him, deputy chief Xiao sat down.

The group of people from the mercenary group immediately returned to their seats. They looked over from time to time and discussed in low voices.

With the amethyst mercenary group around, they didn’t dare to discuss loudly for fear of offending the amethyst mercenary group.

Everyone looked at the tornado mercenary group with a hint of sympathy in their eyes.

Who would have thought that the freshman would be protected by the amethyst mercenary group in such a manner.

“Bah Bah!”

Beside them, the leader of the tornado mercenary group who was lying on the ground spat out a mouthful of fresh blood. He stood up with an embarrassed expression.

He looked at Wang Xian who was chatting with Zhang Yi. His expression was as though he had eaten a dead rat.

“Leader, what... What should we do now?”

A young man asked with fear in his eyes.

Earlier on, Amethyst said that she would teach them a lesson in the wild. However, it was definitely not a joke.

If they met each other outside, they would definitely be in trouble.

Even if there were ten tornadoes, they would not be a match for one amethyst.

“Let’s Go!”

The expression of the leader of the tornadoes kept changing. He gritted his teeth, wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth, and walked out.

“Bang!”

“Are you courting death? Watch Out!”

Just as they reached the entrance, they almost bumped into a group of people.

A youth wearing a black hat coldly berated them.

Beside the youth wearing the hat was a youth with a somewhat demonic appearance. The youth’s face was extremely fair.

His body also gave off an enchanting feeling. His pair of triangular eyes flickered with a vicious luster.

“I’m sorry, I’m sorry, Commander Snake. We were careless!”

Commander Tornado’s expression changed slightly when he saw the group of people in front of him. He hurriedly lowered his head and said.

That bewitching youth didn’t say anything and directly walked inside.

Commander Tornado’s expression changed when he saw the group of people from his young master’s mercenary group enter. His eyes flickered.

“Commander, let’s Go!”

A young man beside him whispered.

“Let’s go back!”

Captain tornado gritted his teeth and turned around.

“Eh? Captain?”

The members of the tornado mercenary group looked at him in astonishment.

Captain Tornado didn’t take a deep breath. When he saw the young master’s mercenary group enter and sit down, he walked straight over.

In the banquet hall, when everyone saw the arrival of the young master’s mercenary group, they also looked toward Wang Xian’s position, intentionally or unintentionally.

“The amethyst mercenary group is here. Xia houming and the rest are not here yet!”

The group of young master Wang Xian’s mercenary group sat on the empty seats in the middle. The young man wearing a hat scanned the surroundings and said calmly.

“If we work together for the mission in the Dragon Wind region this time, there should be a lot of rewards!”

The devilish young man fiddled with the ring in his hand and said calmly.

“Captain Snake!”

At this moment, the captain of the tornado mercenary group and a group of members walked over and greeted respectfully.

The devilish young man took a sip of his wine and looked at them expressionlessly.

“Captain Snake, the new Wang Xian is over there!”

The captain of the tornado mercenary group saw the devilish young man’s expression and pointed to the side as he spoke.

The devilish young man’s eyes suddenly narrowed when he heard his words. A murderous and emotionless glint flashed across his eyes as he stood up immediately!

“Wang Xian!”

“He’s Here?”

The rest of the young master’s mercenary group raised their eyebrows and stood up with cold eyes.

“Captain Snake, that Wang Xian has a very good relationship with the amethyst mercenary group. I was punched by vice-captain Xiao just now!”

Captain Tornado said hurriedly.

“Oh?”

The devilish young man revealed a surprised expression. He looked at the members of the amethyst mercenary group. When his gaze landed on Wang Xian, he chuckled and walked over.

“Captain Snake has gone over!”

“It must be because of that Wang Xian!” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“I wonder if there will be a conflict!”

When the group of people saw the young master’s mercenary group walking over, they looked over.

Wang Xian was chatting with the tall and beautiful lady beside him. He saw a group of people walking over with an unfriendly expression.

When he saw the badges on their chests, Wang Xian understood.

“Leader, the people from the young master’s mercenary group are here!”

“Let’s do it!”

Zhang Yitian’s expression didn’t change. He looked at Wang Xian and said, “Leader Wang, leave the matter to US later!”

The amethyst mercenary group knew Wang Xian’s strength. He was an extraordinary level seven powerhouse.

The young master’s mercenary group was no match for him alone.

However, they also knew that if they were to fight to the death, Wang Xian was still no match for them. Their background was too strong!

Wang Xian nodded with a smile and poured himself a glass of wine.

“Captain Zhang!”

The group of people from the young master’s mercenary group walked over. The devilish young man looked at Wang Xian and landed his gaze on Zhang Yitian. He shouted with a smile.

“Captain Snake, let me introduce you. This is our friend from the amethyst mercenary group, Wang Xian!”

Zhang Yitian nodded and directly expressed his relationship with Wang Xian. His meaning was self-evident.

“I’m also here to check on this student Wang Xian. I wonder if he has three heads and six arms and dares to go against our young master’s mercenary group!”

The corner of the devilish young man’s mouth curled up slightly as he stared at Wang Xian.

“Student Wang is a friend of our amethyst mercenary group. If you have any grudges, please give me, Zhang Yitian, some face and let it go!”

Zhang Yitian stood up directly, picked up the wine cup on the seat, looked at him and said.

“Captain Zhang, you should know that no one can live well after losing the face of our young master’s mercenary group!”

The devilish young man didn’t move. He stared at Wang Xian with a faint smile on his face.

Upon hearing his words, Wang Xian smiled instead. He raised the wine glass in his hand and gestured at him before taking a sip with a smile.

“Could it be that the young master’s mercenary group doesn’t even give him face?”

Zhang Yitian looked at him and said without showing any signs of weakness.

The ranking of the amethyst mercenary group in the Academy was higher than that of the young master’s mercenary group.

In terms of background, Zhang Yitian was not afraid of the leader of the young master’s mercenary group. Naturally, he would not show any signs of fear.

“This is not a matter of not giving face to leader Zhang. He must die!”

The devilish young man said calmly, “No one can stop him. Whoever dares to stop him is the enemy of our young master’s mercenary group!”

“It seems that the young master’s mercenary group is going to become the enemy of our amethyst mercenary group!”

Zhang Yitian heard his words and stared at him expressionlessly as he said.

They were tit for tat and didn’t give in at all!
