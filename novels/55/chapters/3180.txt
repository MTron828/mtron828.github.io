Chapter 3181: 3180 plundered the bloodline

“Buzz, Buzz, Buzz!”

In front of the teleportation array, all the members of the Heavenly Dragon Clan from the ancient painting sect stepped into it and quickly teleported toward the Milky Way.

This time, they were fully prepared.

Now that the Dragon King and Willow deity were both in the Tianhai Dragon Palace, the Heavenly Dragon King had already stolen the Dragon King’s bloodline.

Under the situation where the Dragon Palace lacked top-notch experts, the two factions could easily suppress the dragon palace.

Kill the disciples of the Dragon Palace and suppress the purebred divine dragon.

This was their mission this time around.

Through the teleportation formation, they quickly rushed toward the Milky Way.

At the same time, they were at the Sky Sea Dragon Palace.

Wang Xian looked at the strange black liquid on his palm. Suddenly, he sensed the movement coming from the ground in front of him. His brows were tightly knitted, and his eyes were cold and alert.

When he first entered this place, he didn’t sense the aura of any living creature.

Who was that in the soil?

His dragon eyes were flickering.

Buzz

At this moment, the Heaven Dragon King who was in the soil stood up slowly. The soil on his body fell off and his true appearance was revealed.

“Eh? It’s You, Heaven Dragon King?”

Wang Xian recognized him and a solemn expression appeared on his face. He stared at him intently and asked, “You inherited this Dragon Palace?”

“Not yet, but I will soon inherit this Dragon Palace.”

The Heaven Dragon King Sized Up Wang Xian with a fiery gaze. His face was filled with a ferocious smile.

“HMM?”

Upon hearing his reply, a hint of doubt flashed across Wang Xian’s eyes.

“What a strong bloodline, what a pure bloodline of the Divine Dragon. Hahaha, if I can obtain your bloodline, I will definitely be able to make the divine dragon race stand at the peak once again!”

“However, this is about to happen. Soon, I, the Heaven Dragon King, will become the strongest divine dragon in the universe.”

“Roar Roar Roar!”

The Heaven Dragon King roared ferociously and excitedly. His body had undergone a transformation.

He had a huge horn, huge wings, and a dragon tail that was similar to the Divine Dragon.

This was the appearance of his true form.

Sensing the aura of the Heaven Dragon King and listening to his words, Wang Xian’s eyes revealed a cold expression.

“You want to obtain my bloodline?”

As he spoke, he stared at the black liquid in his palm. The energy that was extinguished trembled slightly.

Buzz

However, when the energy swept past, the black liquid did not dissipate. Instead, it transformed into a special symbol.

“Hahaha, today, your bloodline is my bloodline. I have spent a lot of effort and schemed for three years just to wait for this moment. Don’t worry, Dragon King. I will bring the bloodline in your body to greater heights!”

“Roar! Roar! Roar! The power that comes from the taboo comes from the most ancient technique, the heaven pilfering technique. Activate!”

He raised his head and let out an excited roar.

Following that, black symbols gushed out from his body and spread toward Wang Xian.

Wang Xian looked at the strange symbols. With a wave of his arm, the five elements millstone appeared in his hand.

Boom

With a wave of his arm, a frost divine sword slashed directly at the strange symbol that was connected together.

Bang

However, what surprised Wang Xian was that when the frost divine sword landed on the strange symbol, it did not have the slightest fluctuation.

It did not stop it at all.

This caused his expression to change slightly.

Whoosh

At this moment, the strange symbol in front of him instantly entered his body.

This caused his expression to change drastically. The bad premonition in his heart became even stronger.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

When the strange symbol entered his body, the strange symbol that flew out from the Heavenly Dragon King’s body flew over quickly.

The five elements grinding was used to block it, but it was useless.

Buzz

The strange symbol entered Wang Xian’s body. This made him feel extremely cold.

This strange symbol connected him to the Heaven Dragon King.

“Hahaha, this is indeed a forbidden technique. It is indeed an ancient technique!”

“Heaven pilfering pulse changing technique!”

The Heaven Dragon King saw the strange black symbol entering Wang Xian’s body. Through this strange symbol, he could feel the surging bloodline power in his body.

This made his body tremble. The greed and excitement in his heart reached its peak.

“Heaven Pilfering Meridian Exchange?”

When Wang Xian heard these words again, the intense uneasiness in his heart became even stronger.

The Heaven Dragon King in front of him looked even more ferocious and excited.

His body trembled, but he realized that the energy in his body could not be mobilized.

This caused his expression to change slightly.

“Let’s begin, Meridian Exchange!”

“I will possess your bloodline. I will exterminate your Dragon Palace, carry forward the Heaven Dragon Clan, and lead our Heaven Dragon Clan to Glory!”

The Heaven Dragon King raised his head and roared in excitement.

“Hahaha, not bad, not bad, not bad at all.”

All of a sudden, a voice rang out, startling Wang Xian and the Heaven Dragon King.

In the next moment, the Heaven Dragon King’s figure disappeared. An illusory figure formed from black symbols appeared in front of them.

The head was like a camel, the horns were like a deer, the eyes were like a rabbit, the ears were like an ox, the neck was like a snake, the abdomen was like a clam, the scales were like a carp, the claws were like an eagle, and the palms were like a tiger.

Looking at the illusory figure in front of him and the black symbol, Wang Xian’s expression changed slightly.

This was a divine dragon, a real divine dragon.

However, it seemed to have lost its physical body and only had that illusory energy.

“I have waited for billions of years. Finally, I have waited for a divine dragon with such a high bloodline. Furthermore, it is a mutated divine dragon that is far superior to a purebred divine dragon. I have not waited for billions of years in vain!”

The Divine Dragon Phantom roared with excitement.

“You…”

“You’re the Tianhai Dragon King?”

Wang Xian stared at him. His pupils contracted slightly as he spoke with a vigilant expression.

“Haha, that’s right. It’s me, the Dragon King. I’ve been here for billions of years. After billions of years of elimination and loneliness, I could have possessed them long ago. However, their bloodline is too garbage.”

“I’ve been waiting, waiting for a powerful person with the Divine Dragon bloodline to enter. Today, I’ve finally waited, I’ve finally waited.”

“The emperor and the heavens have not let down their painstaking efforts. Hahaha, I’m very satisfied with your bloodline.”

“Heaven pilfered to change my bloodline, using your bloodline to condense my body!”

The Tianhai Dragon King roared ferociously as well.

He had endured too much during these billions of years.

However, this day had finally arrived. The bait that he had released, the Tianhai Dragon King, did not let him down.

He had even given him such a great gift.

As long as he could condense his body with his bloodline, he would be able to completely recover and get rid of his current appearance.

He would be able to see the sun again.

He would be able to step into glory.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

Wang Xian sensed the energy on the strange dark symbols. His expression changed drastically as he raised his head and let out a dragon roar.

He transformed into the body of a divine dragon and the mighty energy swept forward.

“It’s useless. This is a forbidden power. This is an ancient spell. You Can’t break free from it.”

The Tianhai Dragon King laughed out loud as he spoke. When he saw Wang Xian’s body of a divine dragon, a dark glow shot out from his eyes.

“What a powerful bloodline of a divine dragon. It actually possesses so many attributes. Very good, very good. It belongs to Me Now!”Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com
