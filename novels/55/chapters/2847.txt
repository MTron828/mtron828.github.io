2848 Among the 2,848 bosses

Ye Lui Ying’s fifth senior brother’s strength had already reached immortal King Level 6. In the absence of wind, the tree’s attack was greatly reduced.

“I got it!”

With his strength, he easily plucked the wind jade. The tree’s attack was easily blocked by him.

“Here you go.”

Fifth Senior Brother flew over and handed the Wind Jade to Wang Xian with a smile.

“You guys can take it. I don’t need it. Its level is too low.”

Wang Xian shook his head and said directly.

“Huh?”

Fifth senior brother was slightly stunned. Then, he looked at the uninitiated holy wings behind him and pursed his lips.

“Alright then. We’ll take it directly.”

Fifth Senior Brother said directly.

Wang Xian nodded his head.

“Give it to your junior sister. This Wind Jade is just right for you to use!”

Fifth Senior Brother said with a smile.

“MMM!”

Ye Lui Ying kept it with a smile. Then, she looked at Wang Xian and asked, “Wang Xian, did you get a lot of high-level wind jade with this pair of wings?”

“Last time, master brought you out from the windless forest. Did you get a lot of wind jade in the windless forest?”

She asked with a twinkle in her eyes.

“Yes, that’s why I’m not interested in low-level wind jade.”

Wang Xian nodded with a smile.

“No wonder, Wang Xian, you’re a Tycoon!”

Ye lui Ying exclaimed in surprise.

“Let’s go. Since no one else has entered, we can get more wind jade.”

Wang Xian urged.

“Alright!”

Ye Lui Ying and the rest nodded excitedly.

The windless forest was very terrifying. Once they entered the windless forest, they would be attacked endlessly.

This attack was completely endless.

With your level one godly monarch strength, you could only stay in the area with the attack power of an eternal godly monarch. Otherwise, you would be courting death.

Once they entered the windless forest, they would be attacked. The movement speed of the strong ones would also be greatly reduced.

There should not be many people who could reach Wang Xian and the rest.

“There’s a Feng Yu over there!”

“There’s another one here!”

With the Dragon Eyes of the yin-yang and five elements, coupled with Wang Xian’s strength at the level of celestial thearch, it would be extremely easy to find Feng Yu under his guidance.

Ye lui Ying kept cheering excitedly as she met one Feng Yu after another.

However, gradually, they were shocked as well.

Wang Xian was leading the team. One, two, three wind jade was fine. Perhaps he was lucky.

However, he ran into dozens of wind jade consecutively. This was luck.

“This Wang Xian is not simple. No wonder even master rejected him as a disciple.”

Three hours later, fourth senior sister couldn’t help but send a voice transmission to her junior brothers and sisters.

Fifth Senior Brother and sixth junior sister nodded their heads slightly.

To be valued so highly by his master, his ability was indeed extraordinary.

“Eh?”

At this moment, Wang Xian let out a soft exclamation of surprise and looked to the right.

“What’s Wrong?”

Ye Lui Ying, who was beside him, asked with sparkling eyes.

“Our luck is really not bad.”

Wang Xian said with a smile on his face and flew directly to the right.

“We are going to be rich!”

Seeing Wang Xian’s expression, how could ye Lui Ying not know? She shouted excitedly.

They immediately followed behind Wang Xian.

“What is this?”

“Hiss, why are there so many wind jades?”

When they flew over, Ye lui Ying and the other two took a deep breath. Their eyes were filled with shock.

In front of them, there were over 20 connected trees with wind jades.

These wind jades were all undying level 6 existences.

Over 20 undying level 6 wind jades were extremely precious to them.

Even the Undying Level 7 senior sister’s eyes were burning.

“You guys have to be careful, this treasure of mine won’t be able to protect you here. The moment you get any closer, you’ll be attacked by the Trees!”

“Furthermore, there are more than 20 wind jades here. Their attack power is definitely very strong. Even a level five or six immortal king could pose a threat to them.”

Wang Xian stared ahead and sensed the energy here before speaking to them.

“Don’t be afraid, Don’t be afraid. With fourth senior sister here, Hahaha, we are going to be rich!”

Ye lui Ying’s eyes lit up as she said.

“Okay!”

Wang Xian nodded his head. With the strength of Ye Lui Ying’s fourth senior sister, she could obtain more than 20 wind jades.

Even if she couldn’t do it, Wang Xian would do it himself. He could obtain them with a wave of his hand.

“Help them obtain these wind jades and leave on your own.”

Wang Xian watched and thought to himself.

It was almost time. After entering the windless forest valley and obtaining the Holy Feather, he would return to the imperial star field as expected.

By then, he wouldn’t have much interaction with them.

“All of you stay here and don’t move!”

Wang Xian looked over to the side as he heard fourth senior sister’s instructions.

Fourth senior sister’s figure moved and she immediately flew forward.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

Just as she flew over, numerous attacks were launched at her.

Her figure moved and a wind shield appeared around her to defend herself.

“Bang! Bang! Bang!”

The attacks landed on her body but did not break through the defense. However, this reduced her speed.

It was not a big deal!

“Someone is coming!”

However, at this moment, Wang Xian had a thought and looked behind him.

“I can sense the wind jade. It’s right here, Right Here!”

“Hiss, there… There are more than twenty of them. Hahaha, we’re rich, we’re Rich!”

When he sensed it, the group of people flew over quickly.

Their speed was extremely fast. The attacks from the surrounding leaves were blocked by the defensive barrier.

“Someone is coming!”

Hearing the voices, ye Lui Ying and the rest felt their hearts tighten. They quickly looked over.

Swoosh

At this moment, on a flying craft, more than twenty middle-aged men and women were standing on it.

At this moment, their eyes were filled with fervor.

“Someone’s Here!”

The more than 20 people standing on the aircraft also noticed Wang Xian and the rest, especially fourth senior sister, who was grabbing a piece of wind jade with her arm.

The first piece of wind jade was quickly plucked by her and she immediately grabbed the second piece.

“Stop!”

Seeing the large amount of wind jade in front of them, the eyes of the people on the aircraft were burning with fervor. They did not hesitate at all.

“Boom!”

The middle-aged man in the lead directly attacked fourth senior sister.

“Huh?”

Fourth senior sister sensed the attack from behind. Her expression changed slightly and she hurriedly retreated to the side.

“Who are you? We found this place first!” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Fifth senior brother and the others saw the attack from the other party and their expressions changed instantly. A fan appeared in their hands and they stared at them coldly.

“These wind jades belong to us!”

Fourth senior sister landed right in front of them and said with a cold gaze.

“They belong to us now!”

More than twenty middle-aged men swept their gaze across Wang Xian and the rest. When they sensed fourth senior sister’s might, the corners of their lips curled up slightly.

Boom! Boom! Boom

The might from their bodies moved as a powerful aura charged towards them.
