Chapter 1201: 1202 treasures

Translator: 5496903

In the human-demon tomb, next to the ancient proverb mansion of the insightful emptiness realm expert, everyone from the Spirit Array sect stood at the entrance of the cave mansion with cold gazes.

The rest of the people were also surrounding the ancient proverb mansion as they waited for Wang Xian to come over.

The weak were innocent and would be punished for possessing treasures.

The weak were not qualified to possess treasures.

“They are guarding the surroundings one by one!”

Wang Xian turned his head and looked over. His eyes revealed a cold expression. The corner of his mouth curled up slightly as he looked at the front of the cave.

After entering the interior of the mansion, there was a different world inside. The entire mountain peak was completely empty. Inside was a training ground.

The area above had collapsed. However, due to the protection of the formation, the interior was extremely clean.

Upon entering the interior, Wang Xian could clearly sense that the spiritual energy was several times stronger than the outside.

The former blood stream sect was built on a mineral vein. Although the mineral vein had been dug out, its foundation was still intact.

After walking for about a hundred meters, a hall of the cave abode appeared in Wang Xian’s line of sight.

In the middle of the hall, there was a futon.

Near the wall, there were tables, chairs, and benches. It was obvious that the FUTON was used to entertain guests.

Even after thousands of years, they were still undamaged.

“I wonder what treasures are inside!”

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered. He immediately cast his Dragon Eyes of Fire and darkness and scanned his surroundings.

“Eh? This futon is a treasure!”

Wang Xian looked at the futon that was sitting cross-legged in the middle of his training. His body moved and he flew over directly. With a wave of his arm, he grabbed the futon in his hand.

“TSK TSK, the futon that is used to assist in training is comparable to a weapon at the half-step void interpretation level!” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

A smile appeared on Wang Xian’s face. As expected of the mansion of a void interpretation expert. Any one of the items was not cheap at all.

After keeping the futon in his interspatial ring, Wang Xian swept his gaze across the hall once again. There were no valuable items in the entire hall.

He looked up.

There were stone caves at the top of the hall. The largest one was in the middle.

Wang Xian flew up and pushed open the stone door in the middle.

Boom! Boom

The stone door opened and Wang Xian looked inside. It should be the resting place of the strong ancient adage. There was a one-meter-sized spiritual tree in front of the bed.

However, it had already withered.

He glanced around and frowned slightly. There was nothing there.

He walked out of the stone door in the middle and came to the left. The moment he opened it, the stench of corrosion came from inside.

Wang Xian frowned slightly and looked inside. There were three three-meter-long bodies of ferocious beasts lying inside.

Ferocious beasts that were at least at the half-step void interpretation level had starved to death inside.

“Don’t tell me there aren’t any treasures?”

Wang Xian revealed a helpless expression as he walked into the third stone cave.

Boom

When Wang Xian pushed open the door, he frowned again. Bones, human bones.

Moreover, it was the bones of a woman. There were more than a dozen of them.

“It seems like this insightful emptiness realm expert is not a good person. He has imprisoned so many women!”

Wang Xian took a glance and walked towards the last two caves.

Buzz

When Wang Xian pushed open the fourth cave, a strong spiritual energy rushed over.

He was delighted and quickly entered the cave.

It was a small herb garden.

The entire herb garden was covered by a formation. A strong surge of spiritual energy came from within. There was a pond in the middle with half of the water in it.

A strong surge of spiritual energy came from the water.

“All of them are elixirs above transcendent level eight. Haha, there are more than 200 stalks of them. Not Bad, not bad!”

Wang Xian laughed. More than 200 stalks of spiritual herbs were enough to extract more than 100,000 dragon crystals.

After storing all the spiritual herbs into his spiritual bag, Wang Xian walked towards the last cave.

“I hope there are some good things inside. Otherwise, the cave abode of a void interpretation stage powerhouse would be too shabby!”

As Wang Xian spoke, he opened the last cave.

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang

The moment the door was opened, the sound of metal colliding could be heard from inside.

Wang Xian looked over and was pleasantly surprised.

Weapons. The last cave was filled with all kinds of weapons.

In the middle of the cave, there was a red water table.

Beside the water table, there was a pile of neatly arranged metals. There were all kinds of metals.

The lowest grade of the metals was transcendent-level 9. There were even quite a number of metals at the first level of the void interpretation stage.

On the wall, there were ten weapons at the first level of the Seethrough realm. The rest were all above transcendent level eight. There were more than a hundred of them.

Wang Xian grinned. He didn’t expect this old saying to be a master of water refining.

“Not bad, not bad. These weapons can be sold for a lot of money. Moreover, these metals can be refined into weapons themselves. Furthermore, they are the type of set equipment!”

Wang Xian kept them into his interspatial ring directly.

“Oh right, there’s also that Master Hua Zhenzi’s interspatial ring!”

Wang Xian thought of the interspatial ring that he picked up on the way in and took a look at it immediately.

“A thousand drops of spiritual liquid. It’s really poor. There are two spell formations of level eight and one of level nine transcendence. It’s still average!”

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes. The income from this trip could be exchanged for at least five million spiritual liquid.

“TSK tsk, it seems that I will be able to advance to level nine of the extraordinary soon!”

Wang Xian couldn’t help but laugh. His Dragon Eyes of light and dark fire scanned the surroundings. When he realized that no treasures had fallen, he walked toward the entrance.

“Eh? They actually surrounded the entire area!”

Wang Xian looked outside. At the entrance, the people from the Spirit Array sect were staring at him coldly.

He frowned slightly. There was a void interpretation expert outside, and there were quite a number of half-step void interpretation experts.

Although it was not to the extent of leaving him here, it was still very troublesome.

“Let’s go out from somewhere else!”

Wang Xian thought for a moment and came to the opposite side of the entrance. With a wave of his hand, a beam of golden light shot towards the mountain peak.

Whoosh

When the Golden Light landed on the mountain peak, it dissipated immediately, revealing the protective formation.

Wang Xian’s figure moved and flew out directly.

“Huh?”

The surroundings of the ancient proverb mansion had already been surrounded by hundreds of people. The moment Wang Xian dashed out, he attracted the attention of more than a hundred people around him.

“He’s out. Kill him!”

“This guy must have obtained a lot of treasures in there. Leave Him alone!”

Two roars were heard. In an instant, the eyes of the two half-step void interpretation experts who were closest to Wang Xian revealed an excited look as they attacked him directly.

“You really think I’m easy to bully?”

Wang Xian’s eyes were filled with a cold glint. He shook his hands and a ray of golden light and a red and blue ball of light shot towards the two void interpretation experts who were close to him.

Boom

Buzz

Two unique sounds were heard as they attacked the two of them instantly.

“Ah!”

“Ah!”

The two of them hurriedly brandished their weapons and slashed towards Wang Xian’s attack.

However, a miserable scream was heard in an instant.

As the Golden Stream swept past, half of the body of the insightful emptiness realm expert disappeared. He fell to the ground with serious injuries.

As for the other expert, he was torn into pieces under the attack of the extreme explosion of ice and fire!
