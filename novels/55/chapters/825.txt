Chapter 826: 0827 conditions of cooperation

Translator: 549690339

What the angel meant was that they could use their own methods to refine items that were comparable to elixirs.

Naturally, Wang Xian could understand. Their brewing method could indeed be comparable to elixirs, but it had a huge drawback.

It required a long period of time to settle down. This was a huge drawback.

“That’s right. This requires a few hundred years of settling down. That’s why we asked the Dragon King to come over and have a discussion!”

The angel chuckled and asked, “May I know how the Dragon King intends to cooperate?”

“It would be even better if we can open the shop in the divine territory. If we can’t open it, we’ll give you two sets of ingredients. One of the ingredients will be the medicinal pill.”

Wang Xian said directly. This was the condition for the refinement and it was very suitable.

If he were to find another alchemist to refine it, he would definitely not give them as little as he did.

The angel exchanged a glance with the group of celestials beside him. Following that, he nodded to Wang Xian slowly and said, “It’s very reasonable. We will discuss this matter with our godly king later. It shouldn’t be a big problem!”

“HMM? Alright then. Since that’s the case, here’s some good news from all of us. It’s just some small things. I’m sorry for not paying my respects!”

Wang Xian did not expect things to go so smoothly. With a gentle wave of his arm, numerous straight daggers flew to the table beside them.

A level-12 spirit weapon was quite valuable due to its exquisite quality.

“Haha, Thank You, Dragon King!”

The group of Immortals raised their wine glasses at Wang Xian with smiles on their faces.

Wang Xian nodded with a smile. He took a sip of red wine and chatted with them for a while before leaving.

“This Dragon King is quite bold!”

The angel opened the exquisite dagger and revealed a smile.

“The Dragon Palace is the strongest faction in Huaxia’s immortal sects. They are proficient in alchemy and weapon refinement. This collaboration is a good thing for them and us.”

The flower god beside him wove a flower on the dagger and said with a smile.

“However, the specific collaboration still needs to be discussed!”

The angel turned to look at the five island immortals dressed in black.

“Huaxia’s Yellow Heaven Immortal Sect, Yongchang Immortal Sect, Great Flood Immortal Sect, and Beast Immortal sect are all very powerful. What do you plan to do?”

“Okra’s Angel, we won’t submit to them. We invited the gods of the Garden of Eden’s divine realm over because we want to discuss the cooperation!”

A thin and frail elder with a small mustache said to the angel with a smile.

“It has been decades since any immortal God appeared in the various major God realms. Currently, the most important thing for us is the resources. Tell me, how do we cooperate?”

The angel Okra picked up her wine cup and said calmly.

“Now that the subcontinent has been completely occupied by the immortal sects, our nine snakes association has quite a lot of power and spies. We will be useful in the future. I heard that the ancient Greek god realms killed two immortal gods from the puppet immortal sect!”

The thin elder smiled and said, “As you know, we have been enemies with China for generations!”

“Okay, we will help you solve this problem!”

Okra’s angel nodded.

“Then we will invite the gods to come here tonight!”

The thin elder narrowed his eyes and said.

“Okay, by the way, we will invite this Dragon King to come with us later. With this Dragon King around, this matter will be much easier!”

Okra’s Angel said with a smile.

“After all, this Dragon King is from the Huaxia Immortal sect. Will he?”

The thin and frail old man said hesitantly.

“This Dragon King doesn’t have a good relationship with the Huaxia Immortal sect. Don’t worry, leave it to us!”

Okra’s Angel revealed a faint smile.

“Then thank you to the gods of the Garden of Eden!”

As the thin and frail old man spoke, he placed an item beside him.

The eyes of the angel of okra sparkled. After opening it, a satisfied expression appeared on his face. “Everyone, see you tonight!”

After the gods of the Garden of Eden left, the five elders slowly stood up. Their expressions were as sinister as that of a venomous snake.

“The celestial sect of China has appeared, and the western gods are still ruling the world. It’s too difficult for us to survive in the crevices!”

“Only when they fight will we have a chance to survive. The world is currently short of resources, and the ancient Greek gods killed the puppet immortal sects. In the future, there might be another war between the immortals and gods!”

“More than a thousand years ago, the western gods were defeated, and the immortal sects even fought to the west. It would be interesting if a second war between the east and the West broke out!”

The five old men stood there in a gloomy manner. Their eyes were flashing with a venomous snake-like smile.

“Eh? Xiao Yu?”

When Wang Xian returned to the floating island, he saw Xiao Yu and a group of young men and women on the floating island.

Feng Lingtian was among them.

“Brother, why are you here?”

When Xiao Yu saw Wang Xian flying over, she asked curiously as well.

They flew over to take a look out of curiosity when they discovered that the floating island had appeared by the sea.

“There are some matters that need to be taken care of. Why are you guys also on the island?”

Wang Xian swept his gaze across the surroundings and realized that they were all elite disciples of the major immortal sects. He stroked Xiao Yu’s head with a smile on his face.

“Dragon King!” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

The group of core disciples of the immortal sects looked at Wang Xian with some restraint and greeted him respectfully.

Feng Lingtian also shouted nervously.

The person in front of them was the Superior Immortal King Dragon, the most powerful force in the entire jianghu and the owner of the Dragon Palace.

The reason why they were able to be together with the younger sister of the Dragon King was also because of Feng Lingtian. This made them both nervous and excited.

“HMM, why are there so many of you here?”

Wang Xian asked curiously.

“Brother, we were originally going to Sanya. In the end, the Wild Beast Immortal sect and the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect came to the island to subdue the forces of the island. That’s why we came here!”

Xiao Yu smiled as she held Wang Xian’s hand.

“Subdue the forces of the island?”

A hint of surprise flashed across Wang Xian’s eyes. “Subdue what forces?”

“The nine Snakes Association. I’m not too sure either!”

Xiao Yu looked at Feng Lingtian who was at the side.

“Dragon King, currently, the major immortal sects are unifying all the major forces in the sub-continent. Our four major immortal sects are prepared to subdue or destroy the forces of the island nation. They will give us a reply today!”

Feng Lingtian said respectfully to Wang Xian.

“The forces of the island nation? which forces?”

Wang Xian frowned slightly and asked them.

“The nine snakes association is the strongest force in the entire island nation. They have five celestials and they are not weak. If they don’t give us a reply tonight, we will destroy them!”

A young man chimed in.

“The Nine Snakes Association? Five Celestials?”

Wang Xian was stunned and his eyes flickered.

The Nine Snakes Association, if he did not guess wrongly, should be the people of the octahedron.

And those five immortals should be the five immortals that he saw at the gods in the Garden of Eden today.

It seemed that everything was not as simple as he had imagined.
