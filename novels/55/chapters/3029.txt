Chapter 3030: 3029 i, Celestial Emperor Hong Tian, will definitely die if I defy you

“Master, the person from the Dragon Palace is here.”

In a palace on a star in the ruins of the Mo Han clan, an elder from the Red Mist clan came to the main hall and reported to Celestial Emperor Hong Tian who was sitting on it.

“Is he here?”

Celestial Emperor Hong Tian sat there with a red halo floating above his head and a faint smile on his face.

“Yes, master. Other than the arrival of the Dragon King, the three great domain-level races, the heavenly flame race, the Qianhai race, and the pangolin race, have arrived. Only the Nethersky race has yet to arrive.”

The old man below continued to report.

“I heard that the Nethersky race member has returned.”

Celestial Emperor Hong Tian said faintly.

“Yes, master. The Nethersky race member has suddenly returned after disappearing for tens of millions of years. It is said that he is trapped in the Mo Han clan’s ruins.”

The old man below said respectfully.

“Hehe, I wonder how much he has improved!”

God Emperor Hong Tian said faintly. His eyes were flashing with a cold expression.

…

“Dragon King, the few from the Dragon Palace, this way please!”

On a planet beside the heaven-connecting tower, Wang Xian and the rest were led to a large hall by the experts from the Red Fog clan.

At this moment, many factions had arrived in the hall.

Among them, the stronger factions were all seated at the front.

Wang Xian and the rest were also arranged to sit at the front.

“Dragon King, the three races in front are the strongest domain-level races in this starry sky.”

The voice of the heaven array was heard when Wang Xian and the rest sat down.

His gaze swept across the Heaven Flame race who was emitting flames all over. They were like the god of fire. They had a shell on their back, a tail, a body like a pangolin, and a head like a human.

They were a race from the human lineage of the Qian Hai.

There were three domain-level races and all of them had powerhouses at the peak of the Divine Emperor Realm.

This was the strongest faction in this starry sky.

While Wang Xian was scanning his surroundings, some of the factions in the hall were also paying attention to them.

The powerhouses from each faction carried a trace of curiosity and astonishment.

It was the first time the Dragon Palace stood in front of a group of factions.

“You must be the higher-ups of the Dragon Palace. I have to say that the assassination methods of Your Dragon Palace are really strong!”

Suddenly, a powerhouse from the Heaven Flame tribe, whose entire body was emitting flames, spoke faintly.

“A faction must have the ability to establish a clan. Otherwise, they can only be controlled by others. We are new to the Dragon Palace. Please forgive us!”

When Wang Xian heard the words of the expert from the Heaven Flame clan, he cupped his fists and said with a smile on his face.

“There’s no need to bear with us. I heard that there are Asian Dragons in the Dragon Palace. Can you let us take a look?”

At the front, the expert from the mountain-piercing clan said faintly.

“There’s no need to take a look. Our Dragon Palace is afraid that you guys might do something wrong!”

Wang Xian said faintly.

“Haha, this person from the Dragon Palace is really interesting!”

An expert from the barren race of Qianhai laughed out loud.

Around them, the other factions heard their conversation and listened quietly from behind.

With the might of the Dragon Palace, ordinary domain-level races wouldn’t dare to be too arrogant towards them.

Only the few powerful races in the starry sky had the qualifications to do so.

“Welcome to the ceremony of our Red Mist race!”

At this moment, a voice suddenly sounded.

Hearing this voice, everyone’s hearts trembled slightly.

“Weng!”

In front of the grand hall, the entire building in front of them suddenly disappeared, revealing an incomparably spacious road.

The road extended all the way forward, and an incomparably huge star appeared in his line of sight.

“This is?”

When everyone saw this scene, their pupils constricted slightly as they flashed with a luster.

“Everyone, please follow us!”

Two ninth-level divine emperor experts from the red fog race flew over and stood on both sides of the path. They greeted everyone respectfully.

“Hehe, it seems like divine emperor Hong Tian has occupied quite a number of stars in the Mo Han Clan Ruins!”

The experts from the various races in the Qian Hai stood up and walked toward the large path that had suddenly appeared with smiles on their faces.

The experts of the Pangshan clan and the Heavenly Flame clan also stood up and walked toward the road.

“There are a total of 9,999 planets in the ruins of the Mohan clan. It seems that Celestial Emperor Hong Tian has already cracked some of them!”

“Celestial Emperor Hong Tian’s strength is considered top-tier in our starry sky. His attainments in array formations should be unrivaled.”

“In the future, the foundation of the Red Mist clan will be the planets in the ruins of the Mohan Clan?”

The experts from some factions revealed astonished expressions as they walked forward one by one.

When they reached the Great Dao formed by the array formation, the experts moved very quickly.

In front of them was an incomparably huge star. There were many towering and enormous palaces on the star.

“Look to your left and right. God Emperor Hong Tian has definitely obtained quite a number of stars!”

At this moment, some experts looked around. In the surrounding void space, there were also many great dao that were connected to the stars.

As far as their eyes could see, they could see dozens of stars connected together.

“This… God Emperor Hong Tian has actually broken through so many stars!”

“Look over there. If I remember correctly, that is the divine garden star of the Mo Han clan. The Mo Han clan’s medicinal garden was also broken through by God Emperor Hong Tian!” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Hiss, the Divine Garden Planet of the Mo Han clan ruins doesn’t have any powerful medicinal pills. Just that planet alone is worth quite a lot.”

“No Wonder God Emperor Hong Tian dared to establish a clan. So he has such a foundation.”

All the experts from the various factions looked over and revealed expressions of shock.

Even the eyes of the three top-tier domain-level experts were solemn.

After all, this was once a planet of a powerful universe’s primary race.

The group walked forward.

Their group didn’t have many people. There were more than 100 forces, a total of over 100,000 people.

“Are the disciples of the red fog race ahead?”

Walking all the way to the planet ahead, there were many experts of the red fog race on both sides.

They were lined up in two rows on the left and right.

The two rows were all disciples at the seventh rank of the godly monarch realm and above.

At a glance, there were more than 100,000 disciples at this level.

These were all the grand-disciples of the Hong Tian godly monarch.

Walking all the way forward, they arrived at a huge square. On the square, there were many huge flags.

The red flags were fluttering in the air.

In front of the plaza, stood over 50,000 experts of the red fog race.

Every single one of them was an existence at the divine emperor level.

“Hehe, many thanks to everyone for being able to participate in our red fog race’s founding ceremony!”

Sitting on the central throne at the very front of the plaza, Divine Emperor Hong Tian was seated there.

Upon seeing the arrival of a group of factions, a faint smile appeared on his face.

Everyone’s gazes were looking forward, their eyes flickering with a luster.

“Celestial Emperor Hong Tian has established a race. We will naturally come forward to present our congratulatory gifts. Congratulations!”

An old man from the desolate race of the Qian Hai said lightly.

“Haha, everyone being able to come is giving face to me, Hong Tian.”

Celestial Emperor Hong Tian laughed loudly and stood up.

“Today, i, Celestial Emperor Hong Tian, announce the establishment of the Red Mist race. We will conquer the starry skies and sweep through all directions!”
