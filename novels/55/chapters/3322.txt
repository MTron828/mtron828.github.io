“Undo all the formations.”

Around the Dragon Palace, the National Master of the Lich Kingdom received the order from the Lich King and ordered with an ugly expression.

The surrounding liches nodded silently.

They had already learned of what had happened in Blackwing city.

They had also learned of the death of the thousand-eyed city lord.

It was already the best choice for them to bow down to the Dragon Palace.

If they continued to fight, no one would know who would die?

But they were certain that their lich kingdom would suffer great losses.

The arrays were dismantled one by one, and the starry sky around the Dragon Palace regained its light.

Very soon, experts from the Lich Kingdom were teleported over from the teleportation array not far away.

They placed the righteous God Race Cosmos God kingdoms in the void beside them.

Time passed by little by little. Not long after, more than 10,000 God kingdoms floated around the Dragon Palace.

These unowned God kingdoms were an exceptionally rich resource for any power.

Other than the God kingdoms of the universe knights, there were also the God kingdoms of millions of void God emperors.

The Lich Kingdom returned all the God kingdoms of the righteous God races one by one.

Below them, the disciples of the Dragon Palace sneered when they saw this scene.

“It seems that the Lich Kingdom knows its place. If they dare to be arrogant for another year or two, we’ll destroy them after Ao crab and the others improve!”

The leaders of the Dragon Palace said with a smile when they saw this scene.

These divine kingdoms were very beneficial to the devouring dragon.

And the divine kingdoms that the Lich Kingdom had robbed this time could be said to have robbed a large part of the devouring Dragon’s resources.

If ao crab knew this, he would definitely kill the Lich Kingdom and the others after he leveled up.

Now that the Lich Kingdom had returned all the divine kingdoms, they had actually dodged a disaster.

At the same time, the powerhouses at the edge of the land, stars, and desolation continent also knew what had happened on the Dragon Palace’s side. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Has he admitted defeat?”

In the heaven-opening desolation continent, Wang Xian squinted his eyes slightly when he saw the news.

Now, after exterminating the thousand-eye city lord, he had obtained another universe knight level 8 powerhouse’s corpse.

After absorbing this corpse, the Dragon Palace would be able to increase the combat strength of four universe knights level 8 powerhouses.

With this number, if they continued to fight against the Lich Kingdom, they would still suffer heavy losses.

However, since the Lich Kingdom had stopped fighting, Wang Xian was not prepared to make a move either.

If they continued to fight against the Lich Kingdom, there would still be some dangers.

Everything would be settled after one or two years.

“Let’s go back!”

Wang Xian muttered. His body moved and he immediately flew out of the heaven-splitting chaotic land.

He didn’t return to the Dragon Palace immediately because he had some matters to settle.

It was a small matter to him at the moment.

“An lie, bring the Heaven Array Here!”

Wang Xian sent a message to an lie and waited for a reply.

“Greetings, Dragon King”

Not long after, the sky array and an lie appeared in front of them.

The sky array had already absorbed the corpse of another expert from the corpse-wrapping race. Its strength had also broken through to the level of a level eight universe knight.

Furthermore, after destroying three cities in the Lich Kingdom, they had obtained a lot of knowledge on spell formations and other aspects.

This had greatly improved the heaven formation and the Dragon Wizard.

“Check the location of this corpse’s Divine Kingdom!”

Wang Xian waved his arm and threw a corpse in front of the Heaven Formation.

This corpse was the one he had killed beside the treasure of the Righteous God race.

At that time, he had killed more than ten other people.

This was the disciple of a race in the heaven opening and desolation continent. Although he had been killed, he did not die completely. He must have survived with the help of the Supreme Treasure.

Not long ago, this guy who escaped had been taunting and cursing him on the universe’s AI.

He was also the one who spread the news about the lich kingdom snatching the treasure of the Orthodox God Race of the Dragon Palace.

At that time, he even cursed the Dragon Palace!

Wang Xian was very displeased with this guy.

Now that the matter of the Lich Kingdom had been resolved, he would pay a visit to this keyboard warrior and let him know the dangers of this world and the strong malice towards him.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

The Heaven Formation nodded immediately. With the corpses around, it would be much easier for him to find the Kingdom of God.

Furthermore, it was much easier now that he had achieved a breakthrough in his strength.

“Dragon King, in this direction!”

Soon, the Heaven Formation pointed in a direction and spoke.

Wang Xian waved his arm and the five elements millstone appeared beneath them. Immediately, they flew towards the direction pointed by the Heaven Formation.

The speed of the five elements millstone was not slow either. The two of them shuttled through the heaven-splitting chaotic land at a rapid speed.

“Let’s take a look. Let’s take a look at the position at the edge of the heaven-splitting chaotic land. which place is suitable for our Dragon Palace to live in?”

Wang Xian said with a smile on his face.

Very soon, they would be able to enter the heaven-splitting chaotic land completely.

“Yes!”

The Heaven Formation nodded and opened the universal AI to take a look.

At the edge of the heaven opening primal continent, the Dragon Palace could land wherever they wanted.

“Trash, the Lich Kingdom is trash. They can’t even destroy a small dragon palace, and they still claim that they are the top three forces at the edge of the Heaven Opening Primal Continent. They are trash!”

At the same time, in a palace in a swamp in the heaven opening primal continent, a middle-aged man roared furiously.

His face was filled with anger and unwillingness.

He had hoped that the Dragon Palace would be destroyed by the Lich Kingdom and that the Dragon King would be killed!

But now, the Dragon Palace had actually forced the lich kingdom to lower its head and admit defeat.

If that was the case, the possibility of him wanting to take revenge had completely disappeared.

“Damn it!”

He slammed the items one by one, took a deep breath, and closed the universe AI in front of him.

“I should recover my power as soon as possible, and ask for some treasures from my father.”

The middle-aged man’s face was dark, and he decided to forget about revenge.

He moved and left the palace immediately, flying down.

If his hope was destroyed, he wouldn’t have any hope of revenge in the future. He would recover his power first.

“Dragon King, it’s right in front!”

Five days later, the Heaven Array stood on the five elements Millstone and pointed at a swamp in front. “This place seems to be the territory of the deep swamp race. This race is not weak. There are many level seven universe knights in the race.”

“According to the instructions of the array, the universe god country of this corpse is Right Here!”

Wang Xian stood up and looked at the spot in front. He frowned slightly.

“Deeppool race? Let’s go. Hehe, let’s go and kill that Rat!”

He said faintly.
