When a vicious beast was raised, it would at most rely on its master and listen to its master’s orders.

Its intelligence would have a huge flaw and it would require a long period of training to be able to command it.

However, a Demon Beast Cub was different. A Demon Beast Cub could speak and communicate with humans. In terms of intelligence, it was no different from humans.

It was even able to assimilate into the clan like some of the demon beasts in the city.

To a clan, the value of a demon beast cub was something that even two ferocious beast pets could not compare to.

The Life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop working together to take out items was indeed something that they could not compare to.

“HMPH, isn’t it just a Demon Beast Cub? We also have a lot of treasures!”

A little girl at the side heard their words and suddenly took off the hairpin on her head. “This was given to me by my mother. I don’t believe that it’s not as attractive as a demonic beast cub!”

“Miss!”

The four middle-aged men saw her hand over the phoenix-shaped hairpin and revealed a bitter expression. “This can’t be auctioned!”

“HMPH, so what? I’ll ask my mother to give me another one when the time comes!”

The little girl curled her lips. “We can’t let others bully us!”

“Miss, let’s wait for Wang and the others to decide!”

The four middle-aged men didn’t dare to say anything and raised their heads to send a voice transmission to a clan elder standing on the fourth floor.

The two middle-aged men raised their eyebrows and immediately knocked on the door to report.

Feng Luan and the old woman walked out from inside.

“Sister Feng, auction off this hairpin of mine. Isn’t it a treasure? We have one too!”

Seeing Feng Luan walk over, the little girl immediately ran over and said loudly.

“Alright, Xiao Hong, stop fooling around as a child!”

Feng Luan stroked her head and put the hairpin on her.

“I’m not a child. I’m already more than twenty years old this year. Among humans, I can be considered a big girl!”

As the little girl spoke, she pouted with slight dissatisfaction.

“You’re still a child in the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan!”

The old woman pulled the little girl to the side. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“It’s a loss to hold an auction in East Sea city for void interpretation level items. The best item we can take out is a half-step void interpretation level pet egg. Let’s proceed with this auction as usual!”

Feng Luan said to them with slight helplessness.

Although she could still take out more precious items, this precious item could not be sold at a high price in a kingdom. It might even be a loss.

It was only worth it to take out items below the insightful void tier.

However, the most precious item she had here was this half-step insightful void tier pet egg.

“Yes.”

Supervisor Yi and the others nodded, but then they frowned. “At that time, our auction house will have fewer people, and the items might not be sold at a high price!”

“Sell as many as you can!”

Feng Luan said directly.

“Yes!”

Everyone nodded helplessly.

“The foundation of the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop is too deep. We can’t compete with them!”

The old woman said in a deep voice.

Feng Luan was slightly silent. Now, Feng Xian was being suppressed by the life and Death Pill Workshop and the holy item forging workshop everywhere.

If she couldn’t fight back a few times, she would never be able to think about it again. People would think that Feng Xian was inferior to them.

As time passed, Feng Xian’s business would become even more difficult.

However, these two behemoths had deep roots. If they weren’t from the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan, their shops would have been destroyed long ago.

Ever since she came to the extraordinary continent, she had been restricted everywhere.

The current situation was ten times more difficult than it was a thousand years ago.

“I wonder if they are here!”

A few figures appeared in her mind...

That was a young man whom she had slept with for a few months.

Those few were her special sisters.

If they were here, at least she would have someone to talk to.

...

“TSK TSK, amazing, amazing. The Life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging Workshop actually took out a demonic beast cub. It’s really powerful!”

At night, when Wang Xian saw the information on the forum, he was astonished.

A half-step void interpretation pet egg!

A demonic beast cub that was half-step void interpretation!

Each of them was more impressive than the other!

There are still four days left. It seems like I should start promoting myself

Wang Xian thought to himself.

The competition and promotion between Phoenix Immortal and the holy item of life and death is actually very beneficial to me

Wang Xian stroked his chin and smiled.

“Long Yi, have you rented the auction house?”

There were five auction houses in East Sea city, all belonging to various chambers of commerce.

If it was a normal day, it would be very troublesome for him to rent an auction house.

However, it would be very easy for him to do so in the next few days.

Especially after four days.

With Fengxian and the Holy Relic of life and death holding an auction, how would the other auction houses dare to auction?

There was probably not even a single person.

“Dragon King, we have rented the two largest auction houses in Donghai city. Phoenix immortal and the rest have already rented them. Our auction house can only accommodate 2,000 people!”

Long Yi immediately replied to Wang Xian.

“That’s enough!”

Wang Xian nodded. “Have you finished decorating the Interior?”

“Yes, Dragon King. What should we name this auction?”

Every auction had a name, even if their auction house was rented.

This was because holding an auction could accumulate reputation.

If the auction was held many times and the items auctioned were good, many people would come to the auction once their reputation was established.

“Immortal Phoenix, Let’s call it immortal Phoenix auction. We can just announce it directly!”

Wang Xian thought for a moment and said directly.

“It’s Dragon King. We will start promoting it tomorrow!”

Long Yi nodded.

“Okay!”

The next morning, Wang Xian stretched his back and didn’t sleep for the entire night. He walked directly to the Western District.

Long Yi’s rental auction house was located in the Western District. He wanted to go over and take a look.

“Even after the entire day, there is still no reaction from Feng Xian. It seems like she has admitted defeat!”

“It should be. Feng Xian is already very powerful to be able to take out a half-step void interpretation level pet egg, but the opponent is even more powerful!”

“Feng Xian is suppressed by the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop everywhere in Eastern Sea City. It’s the same for this auction!”

“These three clans are all huge, but Feng Xian’s foundation is too weak!”

“I heard that people from other families have already arrived in the city closest to us!”

Walking on the road, Wang Xian could vaguely hear the discussions of the people around him. A smile appeared on his face.

Regardless of whether it was Fengxian, his life or death, or the holy item, they were going to become his stepping stones this time.

He was really thankful for their help in promoting the auction!

Wang Xian came to the location of the auction house in the Western District and saw a huge plaque hanging on it.

Immortal Phoenix Auction!

“Pah Pah Pah Pah! Passersby, come and take a look. We have an important announcement to make!”

When Wang Xian had just walked over, he saw Long Yi standing on the stage in front of the auction house and shouting loudly.
