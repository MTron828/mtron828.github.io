And at that moment, Jin Yong saw on the stone tablet that most of the experts of the demon breaker circle had been extinguished!

This meant that more than 150 experts of their demon breaker circle had been completely annihilated!

“This… this speed is too fast? Is there an ambush? It’s over, the entire demon breaker circle is going to be finished!”

Crazy Gold Demon’s body trembled violently, and his expression kept changing!

“Since all of you are dead, then I’ll help you keep the treasures in the god country, to prevent that Dragon King from finding them.”

Crazy Gold Demon’s expression slowly sank, and he muttered!

Now, his power was less than 1% of his peak power, and he was only a level two universe master. Such power was very weak even in the invincible region!

And he needed a lot of resources to recover quickly!

Now that the Great Beings in the demon breaker circle had died, he could get the treasures in his God country and the god Country!

This way, he could quickly recover his strength!

“That Dragon King is very fast. Based on his speed, if he were to rush here directly, it would take at most one to two hours. Within an hour, I have to bring their divine kingdom and treasures to my divine kingdom as soon as possible!”

As Crazy Demon Jin Yu spoke, his body moved and he immediately flew out!

Although the god country they were in was dilapidated, it was still not as simple as they had imagined!

Some places within the god country required some treasures to enter!

Otherwise, even a level 2 universe ruler would not be able to enter!

The place where Crazy Demon Jin was at was extremely safe!

Even if he was at his peak, he wouldn’t be able to break through!

If he wanted to enter, he needed a key!

And this key was in his hands!

He knew where the god countries of the other Old Monsters of demon breaker were, and he had a way to enter!

He quickly came to a side hall with a jade stone in his hand.

The jade stone was shining, illuminating the area below.

Below, a space was opened!

This space was extremely huge, and there was a large number of divine kingdoms in it!

He quickly moved this divine kingdom into the space where his divine kingdom was located!

“Lord Jin Gong is dead, all the other experts are dead!”

This was an expert who had been resurrected through a supreme treasure. He felt the movement outside and flew out of his divine kingdom, his entire body extremely weak!

He looked at Jin Lao’s actions and said with a twinkle in his eyes!

“Move all the divine kingdoms into the domain where my divine kingdom is located. You Go too. We will hide in that domain to prevent the Dragon King from coming over!”

Jin Lao’s gaze swept over that great being and immediately said!

“Good, good!”

That great being who was still in shock immediately nodded his head.

There were about 200 experts in the demon Breaker’s circle, but most of them were either cultivating in seclusion or going to other places to train.

In all the lairs, only Jin Yu and the others were there.

After Jin Yu crazily moved all the divine kingdoms to the location of his divine kingdoms, he slightly let out a sigh of relief!

With the treasures in the divine kingdoms, he could recover much faster!

He could even use the resources of the other experts to recover to his peak!

This time, out of the 150 experts, eight had life-saving treasures and survived.

“If I can recover to my peak, I’ll make the Dragon Palace Restless!”

Half an hour later, in the Hall of the Mad Demon God Country, Jin Yun sat on his divine throne and said with a ferocious face!

The entire demon breaker circle was completely finished. He had been killed once, so he had to take revenge!

Although the Dragon King’s strength was heaven-defying, he was still very confident in dealing with the other disciples and experts of the Dragon Palace!

“Let the Dragon Palace be restless. When the time comes, we will watch the disciples of the Dragon Palace and kill them. Let the Dragon King know the price for killing us!”

At the front, the nine old monsters in the Demon Breaker’s circle roared ferociously as well!

They had all survived through their life-saving treasures.

They had all been killed by Wang Xian!

However, at this moment, each of them was weaker than the other.

There was even one who only had the strength of a godly king!

“Let’s increase our strength first. It’s safer here. The Dragon King can’t enter.”

As the mad demon spoke, his body moved. He picked up the treasures he had collected and began to recover his strength!

The other nine old monsters nodded heavily and flew towards their divine kingdom!

Time flew by quickly!

“The Dragon King has arrived. In front of him is the lair of the Demon Breaker Circle!”

Time flew by quickly. Wu Sha pointed in a direction opposite the long river and spoke to Wang Xian!

Wang Xian looked over. That place was like an incomparably huge ancient city. It was directly inserted into the void. It looked exceptionally magnificent and magnificent!

The entire ancient city contained a terrifying amount of energy!

In particular, the spot where it was inserted into the void rift was filled with a void storm. The energy inside was extremely violent!

“Okay.”

Wang Xian nodded his head.

“Dragon King, according to my senses, their divine kingdom is here!”

Wu Sha continued!

“That’s right. Even the resurrected Mad Demon Jin Yu is here. They didn’t escape. There should be a strong defense here. Otherwise, they wouldn’t be here!”

Wang Xian swept his gaze across the surroundings and said!

“This place used to be called the ancient divine kingdom of Hengxu. Later on, it became the lair of the Demon Breaker Circle. The ancient divine kingdom of Hengxu wasn’t completely destroyed. Some places still contain energy and laws. They should be hiding in this divine kingdom. Dragon King, this divine kingdom was built by the Masters of the universe who were at least level four and above. We don’t have the keys and methods to enter the Interior!”

Wu Sha’s introduction!

Wang Xian nodded his head and moved closer to the ancient Divine Kingdom of Hengxu!

He scanned his surroundings and indeed, there were many powerful restrictions in many places!

The Divine Kingdom also contained powerful energy and laws!

This law and energy came from the void storm at the void crack!

Boom

Wang Xian waved his arm and the destructive force of the five elements was directed towards one part of the dilapidated divine kingdom!

Buzz

The attack did not budge at all!

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows. This ancient Hengxu divine kingdom was not something he could break through!

He took out the universal AI and sent a message!

Soon, he set up a demonic altar in front of him!

An Lie’s figure slowly appeared!

“An lie, enter the interior of this divine kingdom and see which space has a large number of divine kingdoms. Be careful!”

When Wang Xian saw an lie appearing, he immediately instructed him!

At the same time, the tai chi dragon plate was hovering around him!
