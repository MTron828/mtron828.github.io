Chapter 1454: 1,454 people blocked and killed

“Huh? Seventh level of the Seethrough Realm?”

“What? That third trading company in the world is actually a seventh level Seethrough realm expert!”

“Another seventh level Seethrough realm expert has appeared!”

When the hundreds of thousands of demon beasts and people from the Flowing Emperor Alliance saw an old man who suddenly appeared in front of the blood flow empire, their expressions changed slightly.

They stared at the water-blue light screen like a barrier that fell from the nine heavens, blocking the front of the blood flow empire’s people.

All the demonic beasts stopped and looked at their emperor.

Ao Xingmu frowned slightly and looked at Wang Xian, waiting for his order.

“You will be in charge of the following matters!”

Wang Xian frowned and said to Feng Luan when he saw the third trading company in the world standing in front of the blood flow empire.

Regardless of whether it was the third trading company in the world, the life and Death Pill Workshop or the holy item forging workshop, they were not something the current Dragon Palace could fight against.

If they really offended them, Feng Luan would still need to be prepared to deal with them.

Therefore, he let Feng Luan make the decision.

“The third trading company in the world, you have to interfere in our fight!”

Feng Luan nodded slowly and floated in the sky. Her eyes flickered as she stared at the elder at the seventh level of the profound void tier.

“No, the establishment of the Demon Beast Empire and the ceremony was announced by US and the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging Workshop!”

“We have the obligation to protect the humans who came today from any harm!”

The old man looked at Feng Luan with a smile on his face and indifferently continued, “The emperor of the wilderness and this young master Wang, I think this matter should end here. If we really fight, it won’t benefit anyone!”

“Hehe, the third trading company in the world. Then why didn’t you stand out when they wanted to kill us just now!”

Feng Luan’s expression turned cold when she heard the old man’s words as she asked mockingly.

“Haha, Give Our World Trading Company some face this time. If we really fight, we will kill a thousand enemies and lose eight hundred of our own!”

The old man did not directly answer Feng Luan’s words. He slightly raised his head and the aura on his body rose once again as he spoke with a smile on his face.

A faint threat entered the ears of every person and demonic beast.

As an expert who had stepped into the seventh rank of the profound void tier for more than two thousand years, he did not think that the emperor of the wildlands was his opponent.

Moreover, if they really fought, he could make the wildlands empire and the Flowing Emperor Alliance suffer heavy losses.

The other party knew what to choose!

“This time, our blood flow empire admits defeat. If we really fight, you will lose at least half of your forces. Our blood flow empire will not attack your flowing Emperor Alliance in the future!”

The Blood Emperor said to Feng Luan with an extremely unsightly expression.

This time, his tone was a little weak.

If it wasn’t for the presence of the experts from the third trading company in the world, their blood flow empire would be completely finished.

The emperor of the wildlands was actually the subordinate of that Wang Xian. This made him unable to believe it even until now.

Faced with the Elder’s faint threat, Feng Luan’s expression was a little ugly. Her eyes flickered with killing intent.

“Do you want to make a move?”

Wang Xian sensed Feng Luan’s killing intent and asked her plainly.

“I can make a move. Are You Confident?”

Feng Luan’s eyes flickered as she looked at him and asked.

“Kill anyone who gets in my way!”

Wang Xian smiled faintly. His voice was not concealed at all as it resounded in the sky.

Kill anyone who gets in my way!

With AO Xingmu’s current strength, he could almost kill an opponent of the same level with 100% certainty.

Since the third trading company in the world dared to interfere, he would kill them all!

“Kill anyone who gets in my way?”

Wang Xian’s words caused the expressions of everyone in the bloodshed empire to change slightly.

The expression of the old man from the third trading company in the world also changed slightly. A cold look appeared on his face.

“Kill me? Haha, Don’t be too arrogant!”

The old man laughed maniacally and said with a face full of ridicule.

“I’ll kill you if I say so!”

Wang Xian looked at the old man who was laughing maniacally and shouted with a straight face.

“The Dragon King wants you to die. No one will be able to save you today!”

“Kill him!”

Ao Xingmu roared when he heard Wang Xian’s words.

As soon as he finished his sentence, his entire figure disappeared and appeared in front of the old man in an instant.

“Forest illusion!”

A cold voice resonated in the sky. Following that, a terrifying forest appeared around him in an instant.

The entire forest instantly covered the old man.

The trees outside the forest rapidly rotated, forming a terrifying space with a radius of five kilometers in the sky.

“What? You Want to kill me? You’re courting death!”

When the world’s third trading company’s old man saw Ao Xingmu instantly attack, his expression changed drastically, and he roared furiously.

“Shatter, Sea Palm!”

His entire body trembled, and a terrifying tsunami came from his body. The tsunami surged out of his body, transforming into a terrifying palm with a radius of three to four kilometers.

The palm directly bombarded the surrounding forest.

“Absorb!”

However, what shocked the old man was that when the palm landed in the forest, it did not cause the slightest ripple, as if it had directly disappeared.

He clearly sensed his own energy and released it.

“Tree Demon, Attack!”

Ao Xingmu was floating at the front. With a light shout, hundreds of tree demons that were hundreds of meters in size attacked the old man.

After absorbing the ancestral tree’s energy in the Dragon Palace, Ao Xingmu had completed a terrifying transformation.

After the transformation, he was 100% confident that he could kill a seventh-level profound void martial artist.

Boom! Boom! Boom

The trees instantly appeared in front of the old man at a terrifying speed. The terrifying sharp thorns on them stabbed at him.

This caused the old man’s expression to change drastically.

Things seemed to have exceeded his expectations.

“Kill! All the people from the bloodshed empire, leave no one alive!”

However, when Ao Xingmu’s forest illusion completely enveloped the expert at level seven of the Seethrough realm in the sky, all the experts from the demonic beast race and the Liuhuang Alliance started to move.

Wang Xian waved his arm and the five elements millstone directly floated in the sky.

“They... they actually dared to attack!”

“Oh my God, the king of the wildlands actually attacked the old man from the third trading company in the world and trapped him completely!”

“Dodge, let’s Dodge!”

The instant the demonic beasts and the Flowing Emperor Alliance made their move, the tens of millions of humans around them were shocked.

They watched in horror as the experts charged over and hurriedly fled into the distance.

“This... this...”

At this moment, everyone from the blood flow empire was stupefied.

They had originally thought that the appearance of the third trading company’s rank 7 void interpretation expert would save their lives.

However, what they had never expected was that the other party didn’t care about that rank 7 void interpretation expert at all.

Moreover, he wanted to kill him!

“This...”

“How do we fight? How Do We Fight? The other party’s strength is several times stronger than ours!”

All the experts of the blood flow empire looked at the demon beasts and the experts of the flowing emperor alliance with terrified faces.

“Run, everyone, quickly run!”

The terrified voice came from the mouth of the blood emperor!Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m
