Chapter 3022: 3021 created a bloody path to intimidate everyone

While the experts from the brain spirit race were discussing, the experts from the other races were also discussing with gloomy expressions.

To the demonic wind race, the living soul race, and the thousand-hand race, Wang Xian’s intimidation was completely effective.

As a race, the strongest among them was only an eighth level divine emperor.

The Dragon Palace had the ability to kill a level eight divine emperor. To them, the Dragon Palace was no longer something they could deal with.

If they angered them and came to their race to massacre them wantonly, it would be a devastating blow to them.

Furthermore, they were afraid that the experts from the Dragon Palace would come to assassinate them.

However, even though Wang Xian and the rest had intimidated the entire race, they did not give up on some domain-level races.

This was especially so for the few domain-level races that had peak-stage celestial thearch-level experts.

The Allure of the Divine Dragon was worth the risk.

Furthermore, even though the Dragon Palace had assassinated a large number of celestial thearch-level experts, the highest-level was only at level eight.

This also meant that rank eight divine emperor was the limit of the Dragon Palace.

Even if the Dragon Palace had a rank nine divine emperor expert, they did not need to be afraid.

The Dragon Palace’s assassination was also a provocation to them.

Other than a few domain-level races who had some misgivings, the rest of the domain-level races would continue to take action.

They had even sent all of their peak divine emperor experts, including rank nine divine emperor experts, over personally.

On this day, many domain level race experts floated in the sky and looked in the direction of the bright starry sky. Their eyes were shining.

“Dragon King, I’m afraid that we won’t be able to intimidate the other party!”

At this moment, in the Dragon Palace, the sky array looked at some information on the universe AI and frowned slightly. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“If we can intimidate them a little, we should intimidate them a little. At the very least, some races don’t dare to get involved in this mess. The other domain-level races should be able to intimidate them as well. They won’t go so far as to recklessly kill the innocent!”

“If they dare to recklessly kill the innocent, they will have to consider our revenge. Moreover, our main dragon palace has already been transferred here. They can’t do anything to us!”

Wang Xian spoke.

Tian Chen nodded slightly.

“Dragon King, the eight-limbed demonic fiend and the rest have sent a message. The old clan leader of a domain-level race has come personally. In addition, there are also a few other domain-level races that have sent a level 9 celestial thearch.”

“Furthermore, there will be a peak celestial thearch powerhouse from the Heaven Flame race!”

At this moment, Prime Minister Gui received the message from the eight-limbed demonic fiend and reported to Wang Xian.

“Let’s do it. An lie, bring some poisonous horned dragons along and scout the way to these domain-level races first. Once they have crossed the line, we will hunt down their tribesmen, level two or three celestial thearch powerhouses, and their elite disciples!”

“I would like to see if they dare to fight against our Dragon Palace!”

“Also, Heaven Array Ao Yao, you guys should increase your strength first. After that, it will be easier to hunt them down.”

The corner of Wang Xian’s mouth curled up slightly as he spoke in a sinister tone.

This time around, three level eight celestial thearch powerhouses and 16 level seven celestial thearch powerhouses had died in his hands.

These resources were sufficient for Heaven Array Ao Yao and Ba Qi to possess the combat strength of a level eight celestial thearch.

At that time, with an lie, who could ignore the array formation and teleport, it would definitely be a disaster for the domain-level disciples.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

An lie nodded and immediately left with dozens of poison horned dragon species’elites.

Next, if a group of factions dared to act wantonly in the Dragon Palace’s territory, the Dragon Palace would slaughter their disciples and experts.

As the days passed, the poisonous horned dragon also sent messages.

Some experts came to the starry sky.

The Dragon Palace didn’t do anything but waited.

Maybe it was because of the deterrence this time, but no one massacred the innocent in the territory of the Dragon Palace.

The experts flew directly toward the imperial star field.

They had almost gotten the information they needed. Now, they only needed to go to the Dragon Palace’s lair.

“It seems that there are quite a lot of people!”

Half a month later, on the Dragon Island above the imperial star area, the old chief of the brain spirit race glanced around, his eyes sparkling.

He looked at the towering palace below and flew down.

“HMM? That should be the ocean where the Dragon Palace is located. There’s a palace inside, but it’s not Big!”

The head of the brain spirit race flew down directly.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

Some figures in the surroundings also flew over.

“There’s no movement inside. It seems that the people from the Dragon Palace have escaped!”

An old man with the head of a human and the body of a pangolin stared at the place below and said indifferently.

“Humph, you killed hundreds of experts from my ancient rare race. I want to see how powerful this Dragon Palace is!”

A cold shout was heard, and a top-tier expert from the ancient rare race entered the ocean below.

The experts from the surrounding forces also moved and immediately flew down.

“Welcome to our Dragon Palace. We don’t want to be enemies with you. Please don’t make things difficult for us!”

When the seven experts arrived at the front of the Dragon Palace.

A civil official of the Dragon Palace walked out from the East Gate of the Dragon Palace and bowed to them.

“Call the leader of Your Dragon Palace Here!”

The ancient rare race expert narrowed his eyes and ordered coldly when he saw the Dragon Palace civil official with a turtle shell on his back.

“Hehe, everyone, our Dragon King is not here. I’m the only one here!”

The Dragon Palace civil official smiled and said.

“What?”

“How dare you kill a member of the ancient rare race!”

The ancient rare race expert was stunned for a moment. Then, he sent a terrifying force toward the civil official.

“The Dragon Palace doesn’t offend anyone, and no one can offend the Dragon Palace. Killing people in the territory of the Dragon Palace requires a price, and the rules of our territory are set by us!”

The civil official’s face turned pale, and he continued to speak in a neither servile nor overbearing manner.

“Hehe, is it very powerful? Then do you know that the Dragon Palace also has to pay a price for assassinating our brain spirit race?”

The Brain Spirit Race’s old patriarch asked indifferently.

“A return and a return are just enough to offset each other. When Is it time for revenge? Our Dragon Palace has no intention of becoming enemies with any faction!”

The Dragon Palace’s civil official replied indifferently.

“You still don’t have the qualifications to talk to us. Tell your leader to come out!”

On the right, an elder at the ninth level divine emperor said coldly.

“If there’s a chance, our Dragon King will meet you all.”

The civil official of the Dragon Palace spoke again.

“We’re all here, but Your Dragon King isn’t going to meet us?”

The ancient rare race expert asked coldly, his eyes slowly revealing killing intent.
