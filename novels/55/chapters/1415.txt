Chapter 1416: 1416, what was a heaven’s Pride? 2

A young genius at level eight or nine extraordinary was already a very dazzling existence in a dynasty or a city!

Especially a level nine extraordinary, it was enough to establish a pretty good family!

Even if it was in a capital, it was still the same.

“It’s still pretty good. These are all talents that can be molded. Teach them well, at least half of them can reach the insightful void realm!”

Feng Luan looked over and slowly nodded her head.

These people were the top geniuses among the seven to eight hundred million people. To be able to reach the eighth or ninth level of the extraordinary realm was also a dragon among men.

However, these so-called Heaven’s favorites were a little weak by Wang Xian’s standards, especially when compared to the heaven’s favorites in the tomb of the human demon.

In the tomb of the human demon, one must have the strength of a half-step insightful emptiness realm if they wanted to enter the top twenty of the Heaven’s favorites list.

Even many young people at the half-step void interpretation realm couldn’t enter the prodigy roll.

Perhaps there would be a half-step void interpretation realm prodigy in this year’s prodigy competition of the dragon-phoenix dynasty, but obviously, there was no such person here.

“Let’s go sit down and eat something to enjoy the night view!”

Xiao Yu and the others were dispirited when they saw the so-called prodigies. In their eyes, the strength of the so-called prodigies was even weaker than the weakest of the Dragon Palace.

“Alright!”

Everyone nodded and went to a pavilion at the side. They ordered some food and drinks.

Soon, the sound of music could be heard from the small lake. In the lake, a woman was holding a guzheng and playing a song.

A young man from the group of Heaven’s favorites was waving a long sword on the water with great interest.

“Yinxuan, I haven’t heard you play the guqin for a long time!”

Wang Xian looked at Tang Yinxuan and said with a smile.

“That’s right, sister-in-law Yinxuan’s guqin is like a dream!”

“Sister Yinxuan, do you want to play a song?”

Wang Xian opened his mouth and looked at Tang Yinxuan. The girls were also staring at her with great interest.

“Okay, okay. Since husband and the other sisters want to hear it, I’ll play a song for You!”

Tang Yinxuan was all smiles.

She was originally from the heavenly note sect, and she had also comprehended a special sound wave energy from the Dolphins.

The music she played could make one feel as if they were in a fairyland!

Tang Yinxuan waved her arm gently, and a guqin at the third level of the void interpretation realm appeared in her hand.

This guqin was called the bell. It was the name of the first guqin that Wang Xian gave her, and it had been used ever since.

“Ring, Ring, Ring”

The guqin floated beside Tang Yinxuan. Her slender fingers moved slightly, and in an instant, the surroundings seemed to have quieted down.

“Eh? What a pleasant sound?”

When Tang Yinxuan’s guqin rang, everyone around was slightly stunned. Their faces were filled with astonishment. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Even the surrounding Heaven’s favorites looked over hurriedly.

“What a beautiful melody, it can actually affect a person’s mind!”

Everyone was slightly shocked as they quietly listened.

The sound was pleasing to the ear and went straight to the mind.

Tang Yinxuan was playing a cheerful piece of music to express her feelings.

When the surrounding people heard his music, they could not help but smile happily.

In the lake, the young sword-wielding Heaven’s favorite seemed to have gained some enlightenment, and the sword technique in his hand became even more agile and agile.

“Eh? Sister Yinxuan, the young man in the lake has realized something and is about to break through. Give him a hand!”

At this moment, Feng Luan sensed the fluctuations from the sword-wielding young man in the lake, and a strange look appeared in her eyes as she whispered to Tang Yinxuan.

“Oh?”

Tang Yinxuan looked at the young man in the lake, and a smile appeared on her face. “Good fortune!”

She lowered her head slightly and her fingers moved quickly. The Sword in the young man’s hand became more and more dreamy.

Streams of water followed his sword technique and a blurry image appeared behind him.

A crescent moon reflected in the lake.

“Look at young master Xiaoyue’s sword technique. My God, has he comprehended something? is he going to break through?”

“Young master Xiao Yue has comprehended something. is he going to become the number one half-step void interpretation expert in our Flaming Sun Continent?”

Everyone around had shocked expressions on their faces as they stared blankly at young master Xiao Yue in the lake.

Even the group of Heaven’s favorites had shocked expressions as they stared at young master Xiao Yue in the lake with their eyes wide open.

“He’s still a little bit away, but he’ll definitely break through within two days!”

Feng Luan looked at him with a hint of admiration in her eyes.

It was not bad for the Dragon and Phoenix Empire to have such a young half-step void interpretation expert.

“Haha, Haha!”

Not long after, when the sound of Tang Yinxuan’s guqin disappeared, young master Xiaoyue in the lake laughed out loud with excitement on his face.

“Young Master Xiaoyue, you’ve broken through?”

Under the pavilion of the group of Heaven’s favorites, a lady asked with a twinkle in her eyes.

“Not yet, but I’m almost there. Haha!”

Young Master Xiaoyue placed the treasured sword in his hand back into its scabbard and laughed happily.

His eyes looked towards the pavilion of Wang Xian and the rest. When he saw Tang Yinxuan, his eyes lit up.

His body moved and he flew straight towards Wang Xian.

“The sound of this lady’s guqin is truly like the music of the heavens. If it wasn’t for her celestial voice, I wouldn’t have been able to comprehend it. Xiaoyue, thank you again!”

Xiaoyue Gongzi came to the pavilion and cupped his hands towards Tang Yinxuan.

“Eh? Xiaoyue Gongzi actually went to look for the lady who was playing the guqin. I have to say that the sound of the guqin just now was really like the music of the heavens. This is the best guqin I’ve Heard!”

“Wow, look at that beautiful woman playing the zither. She’s so beautiful. She’s like a goddess in the sky!”

“The few women beside her are also very beautiful. Why are there so many beautiful women?”

The surrounding people looked over. When they saw Tang Yinxuan and the others, their faces were filled with astonishment.

“There’s no need!”

Tang Yinxuan shook her head lightly.

“I wonder how old you are, where are you from?”

Young Master Xiaoyue looked at Tang Yinxuan and asked again.

“My sister-in-law!”

At this moment, Xiao Yu suddenly said, causing young master Xiaoyue’s face to stiffen.

“This lady, your... Sister-in-law? This...”

Young Master Xiaoyue’s handsome face was obviously stunned. He asked hesitantly, “I wonder if you are married?”

“Why? What else do you want to Do?”

Xiao Yu asked mockingly.

“Naturally, it’s a fair competition!”

Young Master Xiao Yue puffed out his chest as he spoke. He looked at Wang Xian, who was the only young man in front of him. “I believe this brother is this lady’s boyfriend!”

“You are also here to participate in the Heaven’s favorites competition? Why don’t we spar a little? I would like to see what qualifications you have to be favored by such a beautiful lady!”

Wang Xian looked at this young master Xiaoyue and smiled.

“Let’s go, husband!”

Tang Yinxuan held Wang Xian’s arm and winked at him with a smile.

“Let’s go, let’s go. There are too many people here!”

The group of girls also stood up with a smile and walked out.

“HMM? Coward, if you’re a man, let’s Spar!”

Young Master Xiaoyue’s expression changed slightly. He gritted his teeth and shouted at Wang Xian.

“I will get the title of the number one heaven’s favorite in Flaming Sun City. I’m the most outstanding young man. When the time comes, Miss...”

He was a little unwilling to admit defeat as he spoke. However, when he saw Wang Xian, Tang Yinxuan, and the rest leaving without turning back, his expression changed.

Young Master Xiaoyue clenched his fists tightly. His eyes were filled with fighting spirit.

When everyone around saw this scene, they were slightly stunned.

This Xiao Yue Gongzi actually fell in love with a woman?

However, the other party already had a boyfriend and didn’t care about him at all!

This was gossip!
