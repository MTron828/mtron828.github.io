Chapter 175 Spiritual Stone

“Blood essence of Suzaku!”

Wang Xian looked at the red stone, shocked.

Suzaku was one of the five phoenixes.

They were named Red Suzaku, Yellow Ensuu, Green Ran, Purple Saku Ootori, White Hon Jun.

Phoenixes, like the Divine Dragons, were the top race in the universe.

In history and myths, the emperors were represented by dragons, and the empresses were represented by phoenixes. The Chinese idiom ‘Nine and Five Reign Supreme’ was originated from the nine dragons and five phoenixes.

Phoenixes had a formidable ability – Nirvana, ability to be reborn.

It was different from the Nine Divine Dragon Transformations of the Dragon Race. The five phoenixes’ cultivation was known as Nine Nirvana Transformations. At the same time, it was the most formidable existence in the universe.

Wang Xian did not expect he could buy a piece of Suzaku Essence Blood with more than $10 million.

This was hitting the jackpot!

(Suzaku Blood Essence: Level 15]

(No Dragon Energy could be extracted, but it could be used to refine medicine, weapons, and Nirvana.)

A simple message appeared in Wang Xian’s brain. Such a simple blood essence was actually a Level 15. This was a total surprise to him.

A piece of Suzaku’s blood essence was already Level 15. It was not hard to imagine its mightiness.

After Wang Xian swiped his card, he could not take his eyes off the blood essence.

“Brother, what is this thing?” Xiao Yu observed it with curiosity.

“Good stuff. I’m going to study it!” Wang Xian stared at it.

Xiao Yu rolled eyes at his behavior and continued to focus on the next round of the auction. The auction had begun with the last few items’ bidding. The competition remained fierce.

“How can we activate this thing?”

Wang Xian stared at the Suzaku’s Blood Essence puzzledly. With a slight hesitation, his finger moved, and a drop of blood appeared.

He slowly smeared the blood on the stone, and the blood slowly seeped into the Suzaku Blood Essence.

And then, nothing happened.

Wang Xian tried to instill Inferno Dragon Energy, but soon, he realized nothing got in.

“Is it because of my low level?”

After playing it for 20 minutes, Wang Xian did not figure out how to use the Suzaku Blood Essence.

He was ignorant of refining medicines and weapons. As for Nirvana, he knew nuts about it.

Without any choice, Wang Xian could only keep the Suzaku Blood Essence for now.

“I wasn’t expecting that Manjac Ji would be hiding in the crowd. Totally unexpected!”

“Master, who is he?”

“There is a saying in the Ancient Martial World. ‘Be mad, be a maniac.’ Do whatever it takes, Maniac Ji Yuankun!”

“What a name. I saw that Liu Family, Ancient Fist Sect, Lingyue Sect, and Demon Subduing Sect were quite wary of him. Master, how strong is he?”

“An Inborn Expert!”

Just then, the exclamations from Elder Fang and Xiao Yu drew Wang Xian’s attention. He spun around with doubts and looked down.

A man was sitting at the last table at the back. His shoulder-length hair hid his face as he sat there like a dead person.

Everyone in front of him was looking at this man with fear and respect.

“Master, why do people call him a maniac?” asked Xiao Yu curiously.

“There’s a reason behind it. Ji Yuankun was from an Ancient Martial Artist Family in Flow City. Back then, Ji Family was of second-class strength. His father was a Half-step to Inborn. After they provoked a first-class force, his entire family got eliminated. Both parents and his wife were killed. At that time, he fled with his five-year-old son in his arms.”

“Ten years later, Ji Yuankun hunted down his enemies on his own and exterminated that first-class force. More than 1,000 people were killed. It was a shocking piece of national news. But Ji Yuankun was avenging himself, so none of them said anything.”

“After which, Ji Yuankun killed the miracle doctor ranked number nine on the Miracle Doctors Chart. He did that because of his son.”

“His son was saved ten years ago, but he was poisoned and remained unconscious all the time. It was Ji Yuankun who used a myriad of spiritual medicines to keep his son alive. He brought his son to seek medical treatment, but was humiliated by that miracle doctor. Hence, Ji Yuankun killed him!”

“His family demise and his unconscious son seemed to have impacted him, causing him to act eccentrically. Now, he does crazy things to cure his son’s illness. With his terrifying strength, none of the forces are willing to provoke him,” said Elder Fang slowly.

“Then he’s quite pathetic,” said Xiao Yu.

Elder Fang chuckled, “This type of person is the most frightening.”

“The strongest person in the Southern Province is Maniac Ji. He did not rebuild his family nor join any forces. By the way, the auction has ended. Let’s go down. Didn’t your brother wants to auction some stuff?”

Elder Fang threw a glance at Wang Xian.

“Okay, let’s go down.” Wang Xian nodded.

“Miracle Doctor Wang, let’s detour to avoid the suspicion of others,” said Elder Fang to Wang Xian as she took them on a detour.

Wang Xian knew her qualm. She was worried that Liu Feiyun would suspect they were in Suite 13.

After detouring, Wang Xian realized that no one had left the place. The wealthy people, families, and sects were still looking at the auction table.

On the stage stood a Martial Artist who was holding a Level 2 Spiritual Medicine.

“Level 2 Spiritual Medicine in exchange for 100 pieces of stone with spiritual strength. I wonder if anyone wishes to trade.”

After the auction ended, Nine Stars Auction House would provide a free trading place for all the guests to trade their items.

“A Spiritual Stone!”

Just when the middle-aged Martial Artist was waiting for a reply, a cold voice cut through the air suddenly.

The middle-aged Martial Artist cast his glance over and narrowed his pupils. Immediately, he said, “Sure, Senior Ji.”

Maniac Ji swung his arm from the back row, and a white, twinkling Spiritual Stone was sent flying to the middle-aged Martial Artist.

“Spiritual Stone, a complete Spiritual Stone!”

“This deal is worth it. A Spiritual Stone is usually used by Inborn Experts for their cultivations. The value of it is more than Level 2 Spiritual Medicine!”

“I have heard that Maniac si has been collecting various Spiritual Medicine. Looks like the rumor is true!”

The surrounding crowd exchanged discussion in whispers.

Wang Xian looked at the Spiritual Stone falling into the middle-aged Martial Artist’s hand slowly. He was stunned.

(Spiritual Stone: 100 grams]

(Can be used for cultivation!]

“Spiritual Stone. It’s the real Spiritual Stone!”

When the message appeared in Wang Xian’s brain, his eyes turned passionate.

He finally saw the core material required for building the Dragon Palace – Spiritual Stone!

This Spiritual Stone is 100 grams, yet its value is more than $10 million. If he needs a ton of Spiritual Stone, that would be 1,000 kilograms. Based on the price, 10,000 of such Spiritual Stones would cost $100 billion. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Wang Xian thought for a moment and frowned.

“I have a family sword that cut iron like mud. I would like to exchange it for Level 1 Spiritual Medicine for improving blood circulation or cash!”

After the middle-aged Martial Artist went down, another Martial Artist went up to the stage with a honed sword.

Wang Xian ignored the auction on the stage as he fixed his eyes on Maniac si at the back.

Since he possessed Spiritual Stone, he must have known how to obtain them.
