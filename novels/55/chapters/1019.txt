Chapter 1020: 1021 fled in despair and returned with a full load

Translator: 5496903

“The wind-winged savage fish and the Jinlin boa have arrived. I wonder how many of you will be able to survive?”

When Wang Xian’s voice rang out, everyone was stunned.

Looking at the wind-winged Savage Fish and the Jinlin Boa that had entered their sight, a strong murderous aura came gushing towards them.

Everyone had terrified expressions on their faces.

“You... Why? Why didn’t you save them?”

A young man shouted at Wang Xian with a face full of anger.

Why?

When Wang Xian heard his words, a mocking expression appeared on his face. He didn’t bother with them at all.

He remembered that just now, a group of them mocked snake mark and the rest to kill him quickly so that they wouldn’t waste any time.

They looked at him in annoyance and wished that he could be killed!

In fact, the four extraordinary level seven powerhouses who were with them helped snake mark and the rest.

For all sorts of reasons, if Wang Xian still saved them, he would be too stupid.

When he was in trouble just now, they gloated over his misfortune. Now, they still wanted him to save them.

It was unknown if they felt that they were stupid or if they were stupid.

“Hehe, let’s Go!”

Wang Xian looked at them mockingly and said to the amethyst and void beasts.

With a wave of his hand, he created a huge hole in the sky. With a leap, he leaped up.

“Go, Go!”

Zhang Fengying shouted softly. The rest of them followed closely behind and flew up.

Ao Jian and the rest packed up the corpses and followed closely behind.

“Run!”

“We’ll follow too!”

“Hurry up, the demonic beasts are coming!”

The students of the Demon Hunters Academy scrambled to follow Wang Xian and the rest as they jumped up.

“Let’s Go First!”

Wang Xian sensed that the rest of them were following him. With a mocking smile on his face, he said to Zhang Fengying and the rest.

“Okay!”

Everyone from the Amethyst and void Beast mercenary group hurriedly followed behind Wang Xian.

“Hurry up and escape with them!”

At the back, the members of the Demon Hunters Academy saw Wang Xian and the rest and wanted to follow them immediately.

Boom! Boom! Boom

“Haha, if you dare to follow us, Die!”

The eleven Golden Swordfish who were at the back brandished the longswords in their hands and slashed at the ground in front of them.

The huge sword ray instantly covered an area of a thousand meters.

The students who followed behind were shocked and quickly retreated in fear.

“He actually didn’t let us follow behind!”

“He wants us to become food for demonic beasts and fierce beasts. He’s so ruthless!”

“Damn it, damn it, we’re finished. We actually followed them out of the tunnel!”

The students were intimidated by AO Jian and the others’attacks, and their faces were filled with fear.

When they followed them out, the demonic beasts behind them had already chased after them. In the vast area, twenty demonic beasts at transcendent-level rank seven could easily eat all of them.

“Run, run quickly!”

The four transcendent-level rank seven experts’faces were extremely gloomy. At this moment, they completely ignored the students behind them and directly fled into the distance.

“Ah! They’ve come out!”

At this moment, a miserable cry was heard.

One after another, the wind-winged savage fish and the Brocade scale boa drilled out of the cave and rapidly pounced towards the surrounding students.

The miserable cry instantly sounded.

The strength of their group was completely inferior to that of the demonic beasts and fierce beasts. They could only frantically flee in their surroundings.

As for who could escape, it would be their luck.

The members of the Amethyst and void beast mercenary group who were fleeing in front heard the screams behind them. Their faces turned pale.

This time, they were lucky to have met Wang Xian. Otherwise, even if they managed to escape in the end, they would have lost quite a number of people.

They had no sympathy for the students of the Demon Hunters Academy.

They had witnessed what had happened just now. It was reasonable that Wang Xian did not save them.

However, just as Wang Xian and the rest were flying towards the direction of Donghai City, they were in the wind chime forest.

One after another, the wind-winged savage fish and the Jinlin boa were crazily hunting down the demon hunters academy students who were fleeing in all directions as well as the few extraordinary sixth and seventh stage powerhouses.

In the sky above them, 21 strange demons quietly stood in the air and watched this scene.

A group of Demon Hunters Academy students were quickly killed.

In less than 10 minutes, out of the 70 to 80 people, only 7 to 8 managed to escape from here.

As for whether they could safely return to East Sea city, it was still unknown.

“Do it!”

Ao Yao saw all the wind-winged savage fish and the Brocade scale boa gathered together once again and prepared to head into the nest. Ao Yao’s order sounded.

In an instant, a miserable cry sounded again.

However, unlike the miserable cry just now, this time, it was demon beasts and fierce beasts.

A group of strange demons, with Ao Yao who was at transcendent level nine, could hunt more than a hundred demon beasts and fierce beasts at an extremely fast speed.

In less than five minutes, all the wind-wing savage fish and the Brocade scale boa were wiped out.

At this point, the wind-wing savage fish clan was completely wiped out.

This was something that all the mercenary groups in East Sea City did not know.

“Pack up the corpses and let’s go back!”

Ao Yao ordered all the strange demons.

“Yes, leader!”

The strange demons immediately nodded and began to clean up the scene.

The corpses of Demon Beasts, fierce beasts, and humans were all stored in their interspatial rings.

Now, there were five to six hundred corpses in their interspatial rings. If they returned to the Dragon Palace, they could refine a lot of dragon blood.

“Phew, I didn’t expect the territory of the wind wing savage fish to be so dangerous. There are twenty demonic beasts at transcendent level seven. F * ck, these guys are really cunning!”

On the sea, the members of the amethyst and void beasts flew out from the bottom of the sea. When they came to the sky, Xia houming looked behind and said with a face full of fear.

“It’s all thanks to Commander Wang this time. Otherwise, we would have been in trouble just now!”

Zhang Yitian looked at Wang Xian and thanked him.

Zhang Fengying was also looking at Wang Xian and the 11 indifferent golden swordfish behind him with a curious expression.

Just now, the 11 golden swordfish had shocked them.

11 underlings of an extraordinary seventh level. Such strength was already very strong in Donghai city. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

He wondered if he had a powerful background behind him.

Wang Xian smiled at the side. This time, he had to thank them.

If it wasn’t for the invitation from the amethyst mercenary group, he wouldn’t have been able to reap such a huge harvest.

After this, if all the items were exchanged for resources, Wang Xian’s strength and the strength of the group of Strange Demons would receive another huge boost.

After his strength increased further, Wang Xian could consider transferring the dragon palace to the transcendence continent.

With their strength, they could definitely protect the dragon palace.

When the dragon palace descended to the transcendence continent, it would be the time for them to improve rapidly!
