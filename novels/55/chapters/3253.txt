“The bloodline of the Demon Dragon has issued a statement. They have warned the water dragon palace to suppress them if they don’t surrender within ten days!”

“Hiss, the bloodline of the demon dragon is too powerful now. If they ask the Water Dragon Palace to surrender, will the Water Dragon Palace agree to it?”

“The Water Dragon Palace is stronger than the bloodline of the Red Gold War Dragon and the wind-thunder divine dragon. Will the Water Dragon Palace agree to it?”

“The water dragon palace might be suppressed if they don’t agree. After all, the Red Gold War Dragon and the Fire Dragon Palace have both submitted to the Demon Dragon.”

“The Water Dragon Palace and the Dragon Palace will not submit if they join forces.”

“It’s obvious that the demon dragon is the strongest now. I guess the demon dragon is going to unify the Divine Dragon bloodline around Lu Xingkong.”

The statement of the Demon Dragon bloodline caused a huge uproar.

They directly made the Water Dragon Palace surrender. This was too strong.

The countless races in the surrounding starry sky discussed.

“They don’t put us in their eyes at all. Do they really think we’re easy to bully?”

The experts of the water dragon palace were filled with anger when they heard the news.

The expressions of the Water Dragon King and the Water Dragon Queen were extremely ugly.

The current demonic dragon lineage had forced them into a desperate situation.

“Their strength is not something we can contend against. If they can open up our water dragon palace, we will not be their match.”

The Water Dragon Queen said with a solemn expression.

Everyone in the Dragon King Palace looked extremely ugly when they heard this.

Just as the Water Dragon Queen had said, the strength displayed by the demonic dragon lineage was not something they could contend against.

“Mother, we can ask brother Wang Xian and the people from the Dragon Palace for help. With the help of the Dragon Palace, we shouldn’t be afraid of them!”

Shui Linglong stood at the side and said angrily.

“The Dragon Palace?”

The Water Dragon Queen and the Water Dragon King looked at each other.

The Water Dragon Palace and the Dragon Palace had announced their alliance. However, this alliance was initiated by the Water Dragon Palace.

Now that the water dragon palace had encountered such a situation, they were embarrassed to look for the Dragon Palace again.

Would the Dragon Palace agree to them?

The two of them were not sure.

Their relationship with the Dragon Palace was not as good as they had imagined. Even their daughter had only known the Dragon King for a short time.

Would the Dragon Palace agree to help them in a war that could kill hundreds or thousands of knights?

“Hu!”

“Water Dragon Emperor, Dragon Queen, why don’t we ask for help from the Dragon Palace? Otherwise, we can only give up on the Water Dragon Palace.”

An old woman’s expression changed as she spoke from below.

“There’s only one way now. We just don’t know if we can hold them off with the Dragon Palace.”

An old man beside him said with a changed expression.

“Let’s try. Leader Shui Yin, take Linglong with you.”

The Water Dragon Queen pondered for a moment and said.

As she spoke, she waved her arm, and a water dragon pearl that contained terrifying energy and a bracelet that looked like a water pearl flew toward leader Shui Yin.

“These two acquired Supreme Treasures will be our gifts.”

The Water Dragon Queen said lightly.

The expressions of the leaders of the Water Dragon Palace changed slightly when they saw these two acquired treasures.

“Yes!”

Chief Shui Yin sighed helplessly, nodded, and looked at Shui Linglong. “Princess, let’s Go!”

“Okay!”

Shui Linglong nodded, and the two immediately flew out.

The atmosphere in the water dragon palace was unusually heavy.

…

“He doesn’t put the Water Dragon Palace and our Dragon Palace in his eyes at all!”

At the same time, in the Dragon Palace, Wang Xian’s eyes were sparkling when he saw the news.

Their Water Dragon Palace and the demonic dragon lineage had just announced their alliance, yet the other party had made such an announcement.

It was obvious that they didn’t put them in his eyes.

Perhaps, they thought that they could destroy the Dragon Palace easily.

“Is the Water Dragon Palace acting this way?”

He revealed a curious expression and shook his head.

He moved and entered the Divine Kingdoms of the universe knights and began to collect treasures.

As a universe knight, their divine kingdoms contained all their treasures. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

There were all kinds of elixirs and godly herbs.

Wang Xian collected all the elixirs and godly herbs one by one.

“Eh, what is This?”

After searching for more than half an hour, Wang Xian suddenly found a mystical treasure in the treasure vault of a universe Knight’s divine kingdom.

It was an oil lamp. It looked very simple and unadorned.

The oil lamp did not seem to have any outstanding features. In fact, it was already extinguished. However, this oil lamp gave him a very mystical feeling.

The material of the oil lamp looked extraordinary. There were ancient oil colors carved on it.

There were shields, city walls, and giants.

“This lamp seems to be extinguished. There is no energy left in it.”

Wang Xian mumbled. He felt that this treasure was extraordinary and immediately kept it.

After checking the resources in his hands, a smile appeared on his face. He moved his body and immediately flew into the Dragon King’s palace.

The resources in his hands were sufficient for him to improve.

“Roar Roar!”

With a low roar, he transformed into the body of a divine dragon. Wang Xian’s dragon claws moved slightly and a large amount of resources entered his mouth.

“Boom Boom Boom!”

Waves of terrifying aura spread out from Wang Xian’s body.

When Wang Xian was improving, there were also many members of the Dragon Palace who were breaking through in the dragon transformation pool.

In the various Cosmos God countries, the devouring dragons began to devour.

Time passed by slowly.

“Hong!”

A day later, in the Dragon King Palace, an extremely vast energy spread to the surroundings.

“Ding, congratulations to host for increasing your level. You have broken through to the ninth change of the Divine Dragon Realm, the realm of a level one universe Knight!”
