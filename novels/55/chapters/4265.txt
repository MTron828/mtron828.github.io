Translator: 549690339

“Alright, Hetian saint, settle the disciples around you first. Leave this to me!”

Wang Xian’s face was filled with coldness when he saw the king of Void’s furious expression!

He swayed his huge body and stared at the king of Void coldly!

Buzz Buzz

The King of Void stared at Wang Xian with a face full of hatred. He waved the scepter in his hand.

The space power that was brewing in the space disk attacked Wang Xian instantly!

When Wang Xian saw this scene, his eyes narrowed slightly. His face was also filled with caution!

The other party was the king of the Void dynasty. He was the controller of the universe.

In addition, he had a space treasure of the heaven origin creation level on his head!

A treasure of the heaven origin creation level with such a combat ability was extremely terrifying!

Buzz Buzz

In the next instant, Wang Xian’s expression suddenly changed!

He could sense a terrifying spatial force cutting towards his body!

“Ignore the distance!”

His body trembled as the nine-colored energy from his body surrounded his entire body.

The dragon scales emitted a luster.

His entire body was blocking it.

However, terrifying wounds still appeared on his body!

The wounds directly entered his body!

This space-attributed heavenly Yuan creation treasure could ignore space when it attacked. In fact, it could even break through one’s defenses!

It was extremely terrifying!

“A fellow who has just stepped into the Great Dao realm, I will kill you and Take Your Dragon Head!”

When the void King saw this scene, a cold and sinister expression appeared on his face!

He flew directly to the top of the Void Pagoda and disappeared with the entire void pagoda in an instant!

“With just you?”

Wang Xian’s eyes revealed a sinister expression. His body trembled.

The energy of the ancestral tree began to circulate. The dozens of serious wounds on his body were recovering at a terrifying speed!

You have the ultimate treasure of the Heaven’s origin!

Wang Xian also has it!

“Roar!”

The next moment, Wang Xian raised his head and roared furiously at the top.

A nine-colored torrent shot upward!

The terrifying torrent seemed to be able to penetrate the entire starry sky!

“The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace is here. The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace is here. He is here to help us!”

“That’s great. The Dragon King is also an existence at the level of the Great Dao. With the Dragon King here, we can totally fend off this king of the Void Universe!”

“Quick, quick, let’s Get Far Away quickly!”

Wang Xian’s sudden arrival made the fleeing disciples of the saint lineage look excited and relieved.

The last minute was like hell to them.

That terrifying king of the Void universe easily killed their Hetian saint!

With a wave of his hand, the mountains and rivers of their saint lineage collapsed and the void was torn apart!

All the powerful disciples felt as if they were ants.

They were easily slaughtered!

Even a trace of energy would turn them into ashes!

This was their doomsday.

If they were unlucky, they would die.

In a short minute, one-third of the powerful disciples of their saint lineage died!

It was extremely terrifying!

Now that the Dragon King had arrived, he could fight against this terrifying king of the void.

If the Dragon King had arrived a few minutes later, their saint’s disciples would have been destroyed!

“All the disciples, Retreat!”

Saint Hetian swallowed the pills in large mouthfuls to recover from his injuries.

He looked at all the disciples around him and immediately ordered loudly!

“Boom!”

At this moment, an extremely violent collision sound came from the sky.

The nine-colored dragon breath crashed into the void above.

However, the king of Void was standing under the Void Pagoda above, and a wave of spatial energy surged downwards.

Two terrifying energies were confronting each other!

When everyone saw this scene, their faces were filled with shock.

This scene was simply too shocking!

At the center of the collision of energies.

It had turned into a dead zone. Even space had been penetrated.

“Is This It?”

The King of void stared at Wang Xian and said with a gloomy face!

He waved the scepter in his hand.

Above his head, the space disk was spinning slowly.

With every rotation, a terrifying gigantic space disk would fly out from it.

Soon, more than ten huge disks attacked Wang Xian in an arc in the surrounding void!

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

The terrifying disks attacked Wang Xian at an unbelievable speed!

Wang Xian waved his dragon claws and illusory dragon claws attacked the disks!

“Bang! Bang! Bang!”

The sound of violent collisions rang out.

However, Wang Xian’s attacks were unable to withstand the attacks of all the circular discs.

The three spatial discs penetrated into Wang Xian’s body directly!

A terrifying wound was created on his body!

“Phew!”

Wang Xian took a deep breath. The wood attribute energy in his body circulated, and the powerful recovery ability allowed the wound to heal at a terrifying speed.

“King of the Void Universe, is this your full strength? It’s just so-so!”

Wang Xian stared coldly at the king of the Void Universe and mocked.

The king of the Void’s own strength could only be comparable to those who had just stepped into the Great Dao realm.

In addition to the Heavenly Yuan Destiny Treasure, his own space attribute, and that powerful void pagoda.

This allowed him to deal with five new Tianyuan destiny-level existences!

This was all of his strength.

As for Wang Xian, although he didn’t bring the body of the Void Divine Dragon, the Tai Chi Dragon Disc, and the five elements great mill with him.

However, he had the ancestral tree in his body.

With the blessing of the ancestral tree, he could allow her to fight against two new Tianyuan destiny-level existences.

In other words, the king of void and his strength were only lacking three new Tianyuan destiny-level existences!

It was the difference of a control-level powerhouse.

Such a difference was not fatal to Wang Xian and the rest!

“Huh?”

The king of Void saw that the injuries on Wang Xian’s body were recovering at a terrifying speed. His expression changed slightly!

“Do you have a recovery-type Heaven’s origin creation treasure on You?”

His expression darkened as he stared at Wang Xian and shouted!

“Hehe!”

Wang Xian sneered and stared at him. “I just killed a control-level powerhouse in your void universe. If you don’t leave today, I will kill you too!”

“Impudent, arrogant!”

The king of Void’s face darkened. “I want to let you know what the foundation of a powerhouse is!”

Buzz

The king of Void’s face was filled with fury as he entered the Void Pagoda!

In the next instant, the Void Pagoda disappeared!

Buzz

Following that, Wang Xian sensed an extremely terrifying force heading toward him!

“Huh?”

Wang Xian was slightly shocked. He didn’t sense the trajectory of the king of Void’s Attack!

Bang

A powerful force crashed into his body.

The spatial attribute’s cutting force caused large scales on Wang Xian’s body to fall off. Dragon blood also dripped down slowly!

Boom

Wang Xian’s body trembled. One dragon pillar after another appeared around him!
