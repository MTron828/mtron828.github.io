Chapter 673: Peerless In The World

“I’m killing you guys!”

When Wang Xian’s voice reverberated across, the hundreds of thousands of martial artists from the Underworld gasped.

They looked to the sky instantly. When they saw that familiar figure, their eyes lit up.

“The Dragon King is still the Dragon King! He’s still as domineering and fearless in the face of strong enemies!”

The crowd of martial artists from the Underworld couldn’t help but be impressed.

“A guy courting his own death!”

Upon hearing Wang Xian, killing intent flashed across Jin Kunming’s eyes as he stared harshly at Wang Xian.

“This is...?”

The group of experts from the Yellow Sky Immortal Sect stared at Wang Xian in astonishment.

Who is he? What gives him the guts to be so arrogant?

Wang Xian’s cold gaze swept across the surrounding crowd and eventually landed on Lan Qingyue, Xiao Yu and the girls. He asked, “What’s the matter?”

“Brother, they are forcing our Dragon Sect to join the Primeval Chaos Immortal Sect. If we don’t agree, they are going to annihilate us!”

Xiao Yu pointed at Jin Kunming and the group while speaking with anger.

“Nine Budding Realm experts and a group of Dan Realm experts. It’s not surprising that you are so arrogant and haughty!”

Jin Huiao stared harshly at Wang Xian and remarked, “It seems like you guys aren’t willing to join our Primeval Chaos Immortal Sect!”

Wang Xian turned around gradually and his gaze fell on the group from the Primeval Chaos Immortal Sect. He said, “I’ll give you guys two options too right now. Get down on your knees now or die!”

Hahahaha!

Upon hearing Wang Xian, Jin Huiao couldn’t help but burst into laughter. “Brat, what the hell are you saying?”

“What am I saying?”

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered while staring at Jin Huiao. He waved his arm and a water rope appeared around his neck all of a sudden.

Jin Huiao was astonished. Even Jin Kunming, who was standing by the side, was taken aback as his pupils constricted unconsciously.

“Slash!”

Jin Kunming lifted his palm and slashed down on the water rope.

Wang Xian wasn’t bothered at all. The water rope glowed in brilliant blue light. Wang Xian gave it a tug and Jin Huiao was pulled towards him directly.

“What?”

Jin Huiao was flabbergasted as he released dense golden rays from his body!

Bam!

However, at this instant, a short figure flashed across everyone’s eyes.

The skull exploded and fresh blood splattered everywhere!

“Darned piece of shit! You won’t have to know what our Dragon King is saying ever again!”

Dragon Spirit held a dagger in his hand and his emotionless voice resounded.

Boom!

When Jin Huiao was killed directly, the group from the Primeval Chaos Immortal Sect was instantly roused.

“How dare you kill the people from our Primeval Chaos Immortal Sect? You guys are definitely going to die!”

Jin Kunming’s expression was a little contorted from anger as he growled.

His angry roar reverberated throughout the surrounding ten kilometers!

“It seems like you guys are choosing the second option. In that case, just die!”

Wang Xian lifted his arm and five flying swords flew out of his space ring instantly.

“Haha! Kill!”

Behind him, the group of dragonians moved and charged towards the experts from the Primeval Chaos Immortal Sect directly.

“Kill them!”

Witnessing Wang Xian and the group’s overbearing actions, Jin Kunming shouted angrily.

He lifted both of his hands and the Emperor’s Bell glowed dazzlingly under his control.

“Asking my Dragon Sect to join your Immortal Sect? Is your Primeval Chaos Immortal Sect qualified?”

Wang Xian stared at Jin Yuankun. Moving his hand slightly, five Level 12 spiritual swords attacked suddenly.

Layers of ripples were formed over the five spiritual swords.

This was the Tier Blade technique. Under the frightening control ability of Wang Xian, the Tier Blade technique could reach several tens of tiers.

In other words, a single attack would damage one several tens of times.

Boom!

At this instant, the golden light in the sky illuminated the entire space. Terrifying sounds carried immense golden-colored energy and swept towards Wang Xian.

“Level 13 spiritual equipment! How well could you utilize the strength in it!”

Contempt filled Wang Xian’s eyes. He flexed his body and a ball of water energy instantly surrounded the Emperor’s Bell.

The water energy was pumped under the impact of the golden-colored energy.

However, the golden rays weren’t able to penetrate the water energy.

“This isn’t possible! This is spiritual equipment used by an Immortal!”

Jin Kunming was at a loss of words when he saw Wang Xian instantly stopping the attack of the Emperor’s Bell. With a horrified expression, he stared at Wang Xian.

“You are... You are an Immort...”

Swish swish swish!

However, at this instant, five spiritual swords landed on the golden defensive outfit on him. The spiritual swords penetrated through his body easily.

“...al...”

Jin Kunming’s eyes widened with disbelief and indignance as his jaw dropped!

Unable to put up any resistance! He was killed instantly without even being able to put up any forms of resistance!

“Sword Explosion!”

Wang Xian turned around, manipulated the five spiritual swords to stick together and surrounded them with the blue-colored ball of light.

Boom!

A thousand-meter longsword slashed across the experts from the Primeval Chaos Immortal Sect.

“Shit! Stop it! Stop it!”

Thirty Budding Realm experts from the Primeval Chaos Immortal Sect were completely scared out of their wits as some of them screamed.

Layer after layer of golden doors appeared before them.

“Explode!” Wang Xian shouted. Several thousand-meter longswords exploded, transforming into countless water swords that were only a meter long and launched towards the group of Budding Realm experts.

The five pieces of spiritual equipment were the fiercest weapons! As they slashed across, they severed the head of Budding Realm expert after Budding Realm expert.

Argh!

Thirty Budding Realm experts were dying at a frightening speed.

Experts were like dogs and easily slaughtered!

Around them, the dragonians emitted a pungent smell of blood as they charged ahead for the kill.

Gulp!

“Immortal...”

Feng Jinqing’s eyes widened, and he stood on the spot and stared at Wang Xian in horror. His body was shivering a little from fear.

Everything was like an ant before an Immortal. Only an Immortal would be an extraordinary existence!

However, they would have never expected this young man to be an Immortal.

To their astonishment, the leader of the Dragon Sect was an Immortal!

There is an Immortal Realm existence in the real world?

The other people from the Yellow Sky Immortal Sect around him could also feel their scalps going numb.

Budding Realm experts were dying with just a wave of his hand. If he wasn’t at the Immortal Realm, who would be?

“The Dragon King is invincible...”

“The Dragon King is awesome...”

The crowd of martial artists from the Underworld below the battle was completely stunned. Their eyes widened and were filled with admiration and shock.

Once again, the Dragon King had easily annihilated experts whom they had thought were invincible.

Some martial artists even wanted to go on their knees and pray to Wang Xian. Too strong! He’s truly peerless in the world!

“The brother of that brat is an Immortal Realm existence just like my father!” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Feng Lingtian’s expression darkened and his legs went soft. He felt extremely bitter and embarrassed.

Weng!

Wang Xian waved his arm again and the Emperor’s Bell shrank gradually under his control. In the end, the Emperor’s Bell landed in Wang Xian’s hand.

Wang Xian turned it in his hand before looking to the remaining group of people from the Yellow Sky Immortal Sect.

“Were they involved in this previously?”

Sss!

Upon hearing Wang Xian, everyone in the Yellow Sky Immortal Sect couldn’t help but take a step back in fear.

Feng Jinqing’s lips trembled as he said, “Your Excellency, we...”

“Brother, that brat was fighting with me a while ago but called upon his elder when he couldn’t win. Help me watch out for the rest while I spar with him again!”

Before Feng Jinqing could finish his words, Xiao Yu pointed at Feng Lingtian and was eager to fight again.
