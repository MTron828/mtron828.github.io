Chapter 1368: 1368’s blood flowed like a river

“Ahhhh!”

When the black rain fell downwards, endless screams sounded in the battlefield.

“This, this... The black rain from the sky fell on the bodies of the troops of the Three Kingdoms. It carried a strong poison. A transcendent level 8 was actually heavily injured. My God!”

“The blue rain from the sky fell on my body. I feel that my recovery ability has increased by a lot. The wound that appeared just now is rapidly recovering!”

“It’s at the rear. It’s Lord Wang’s subordinates. Look at the sky!”

When the rain that covered the entire battlefield descended, the soldiers of the dragon-phoenix Empire were once again stunned.

The dense rain and black rain accurately fell on the soldiers of the three dynasties, while the blue drops landed on their bodies instead.

The black raindrops could even injure a Type 8 transcendent.

However, the blue raindrops could increase their strength and recovery, the supporting effects were heaven-defying.

In fact, the instant the black raindrops landed, tens of thousands of people had died in the rain.

If the earlier battle had been one-sided, it was now a one-sided massacre!

“Disperse the black clouds in the sky, we must disperse them!”

On the battlefield, a half-step void interpretation expert blocked the violent demon monkey in front of him. As he felt the black rain falling from the sky, he shouted with an extremely ugly expression.

“And behind them, the creature that is emitting special sound waves to assist us kill them. We must kill them!”

However, just as he finished speaking, another expert not far away shouted loudly.

“It’s over, it’s over, how could it be, how could they be so terrifying!”

However, there were even more terrified voices coming from the battlefield.

Some of the soldiers of the Three Kingdoms had already cried out in fear.

They were somewhat shocked by the sudden appearance of these creatures. Their violent attacks, terrifying defenses, and powerful strength made it difficult for them to resist!

They were originally at a disadvantage, but now they were being disturbed by the sound waves and attacked by the black rain in the sky.

They had to resist both the powerful enemies and the black rain in the sky.

As for dispersing the black rain and killing the group of dolphins behind them?

Who was going? Right now, they were no different from lining up to die.

“As long as the Lord Profound Void can kill the other party, we can still obtain victory, we can still obtain victory!”

Some of the soldiers thought in fear.

“Ah, I’m not resigned!”

However, at this moment, a tragic sound reverberated throughout the entire sky.

Hearing this sound, the hearts of all the soldiers of the southern cloud dynasty trembled slightly. They turned their heads and widened their eyes, their eyes filled with fear.

“What... how is this possible... how is this possible!”

They widened their eyes and looked at a huge millstone that covered the head of the southern cloud king thousands of meters in the sky.

The millstone spun and streams of gray energy washed over the southern cloud king.

The armor on his body quickly crumbled under the gray energy. The greatsword in his hand was directly sent flying!

Their king struggled in fear. His face was filled with unwillingness and fear.

“Die!”

At this moment, they heard a disdainful voice.

Some people turned their heads and looked at the dragon and Phoenix Dynasty’s city wall.

There, a young man was floating in the air. His palm moved slightly and controlled the huge millstone from a distance of five to six thousand meters.

The millstone spun and crushed towards their king.

“Ah!”

With a desperate scream, the Southern Cloud King was crushed by the five elements millstone.

And that figure only attacked from a few kilometers away.

The gap was so huge. It was simply crushing!

“This... this... It’s over. Our king actually fell. It’s over, it’s all over!”

When the southern cloud dynasty soldiers saw this scene, their bodies trembled violently, and the fighting spirit in their hearts disappeared.

Their king, the strongest expert of the Southern Cloud Dynasty, was actually controlled by someone to directly kill him at a distance of five to six kilometers.

This disparity was simply too great.

One of the profound void tier 4 experts had already fallen, how could they continue to fight?

“Ahhhhh!”

Right at this moment, another miserable cry sounded out.

Some of the soldiers raised their heads once more to look, and they saw that in the sky, many profound void tier experts had fallen one after another under the attacks of the nine flood dragons and the demon monkey lightning creature.

Originally, those creatures were able to contend against the forty profound void martial experts of their three empires.

Now that all the profound void martial experts of the dragon-phoenix Empire had made a move, it had completely become a crushing blow. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Flee! Flee!”

The profound void martial experts of the three great empires watched as their comrades fell one after another, their faces filled with fear and uncertainty.

They gritted their teeth, and one of the rank three profound void martial experts turned around and fled into the distance.

“Haha, a bunch of trash, still trying to escape!”

The two dragon-phoenix dynasty experts roared out with derision.

“Roar!”

The two flood dragons saw the escaping experts and moved.

As members of the Wind God Dragon bloodline, there were very few who could be faster than them.

The two flood dragons chased after them, and in less than a minute, they killed the expert who had lost the battle.

Escape, he couldn’t escape!

Fight, he couldn’t win!

The rain in the sky continued to fall. Some of them landed on the ground, mixed with blood. The entire ground was sticky and blood-red!

Ten minutes later, the blood on the ground gradually gathered into a small river.

There were two to three hundred thousand corpses on the ground.

It was brutal, the intensity of the battle!

Wang Xian floated above the city wall. He didn’t continue to attack. Under his control, the five elements millstone floated beside the battlefield of Feng Luan, the King of Star Moon, Mu Zesen, and the king of the Fengxiao dynasty.

He wanted to prevent the other party from escaping.

None of the enemies that came today would be able to escape!

“Haha, we are going to win. We are going to win. This is great, this is great!”

“Lord Wang is mighty. He killed the king of Southern Cloud in just a few minutes. Furthermore, he has been standing on the spot and controlling the millstone from afar. He is simply invincible!”

“This is great. Hahaha, the Dragon and Phoenix dynasty is invincible. Lord Wang is invincible. Her Majesty the Queen is Invincible!”

In the dragon-phoenix Empire, the people of the dragon-phoenix Empire who were watching the battle in the sky roared in excitement.

They had won! They had won!

Judging from the battle, they had won 100% !

Their dragon-phoenix Empire was the strongest!

They were so excited that they couldn’t describe it.

“How is this possible? The three dynasties have lost! They have lost completely!”

“That Lord Wang, he... he actually has such terrifying strength and influence. Heavens, if I had known earlier... If I had known earlier, I would have stayed in the dragon-phoenix Dynasty!”

“He actually defeated the three dynasties. Heavens, doesn’t that mean that the three dynasties will be conquered by the dragon-phoenix Dynasty in the future? I actually left the dragon-phoenix Dynasty!”
