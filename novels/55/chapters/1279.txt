Chapter 1280: 1281 was confessed to

Translator: 5496903

“Ta ta ta ta ta!”

“Look, that’s the nameless sword demon, the supreme prodigy!”

“Wow, it’s so domineering. Riding on the King Beast, that’s a terrifying demon beast that can grow to the sixth level of the profound void tier. The nameless sword demon is so domineering!”

“Boss Nameless Sword Demon, do you lack underlings? I’m willing to be your underling!”

“Handsome nameless sword demon, do you need a wife? If you really can’t do it, a maid can do it too. It’s to warm the bed!”

When Wang Xian rode his demon soul and flew towards his residence, everyone saw him stopping in a hurry. Their faces were filled with respect.

Some of the young men and women even shouted at him directly. When Wang Xian heard the voices around him, he raised his eyebrows slightly.

“Looks like I should hide my demon soul in the future. Otherwise, there will be a lot of trouble!”

Wang Xian thought to himself. When he arrived at the edge, his body moved and he landed on the ground.

“Demon Soul, can you change your body size and make it smaller?”

Wang Xian jumped down from the demon soul and said to it.

“It’s the King!”

The demon soul nodded.

There were two forms of the Demon Scale Demon Beast. One of them had four limbs facing the ground while the other was in the form of a human.

The scales on the demon soul’s body squirmed slowly and its entire body shrunk rapidly. It turned into a size of 1.78 meters. It seemed that there was a huge gap between it and the demon scale clan.

“King, this is already my limit. Turning into this state will affect my combat strength!”

The Demon Soul said to Wang Xian.

“It’s Alright, let’s Go!”

Wang Xian shook his head. The mask on his face disappeared and he brought the demon soul to his residence.

The nameless sword demon disappeared.

He was completely hidden and Wang Xian couldn’t help but reveal a smile.

“I really hid my achievements and FAME!”

He thought to himself and opened the door. The two ferocious beasts inside immediately roared at him.

Wang Xian smiled and threw some food to them. He returned to his room in a good mood and began to rest.

After sleeping for more than ten hours, Wang Xian walked into the courtyard with a satisfied expression. He poured himself a cup of tea and thought about his next move.

Now, he could be said to have cleared the heaven’s pride stage and the training grounds of the blood stream sect in the demi-human graveyard. He had also obtained a large amount of spiritual liquid.

If he wanted to obtain more spiritual liquid, he could only do so in the blood refinement grounds and the main hall.

Compared to these two places, they were much more bloody. Many insightful emptiness realm experts were active there.

This was especially so in the main hall, the main hall. Those who had not reached the insightful emptiness realm would be courting death if they stepped into it.

“Awooo!”

Just as he was deep in thought, a cry was suddenly heard. Wang Xian was slightly stunned and raised his head to look.

As expected, it was still the young lady in the white dress who was staring at him.

Wang Xian was a little stunned. He extended his hand and gestured to her. “Come over and have a seat. What’s the matter?”

Ling Jian ‘er looked at him. She hesitated for a moment before flying over to Wang Xian.

Xiao Ha, who was on his shoulder, jumped in front of Wang Xian. She extended her tongue excitedly and licked his arm.

Ling Jian ‘er walked over and looked at the demon soul beside her. She wasn’t too surprised.

She already knew Wang Xian’s identity.

“Pretty Lady, why are you looking for me?”

Wang Xian was speechless when he saw her looking at him.

“My father is looking for me. He wants me to go back with him!”

Ling Jian ‘er suddenly said.

Wang Xian raised his head and looked at her. He felt that her words were somewhat inexplicable.

“Eh? What does this have to do with me? What do you want to say?”

Wang Xian pointed at the seat beside him again and gestured at her.

“I don’t want to go back. I’ve already abandoned it. I don’t need it anymore!”

She still didn’t sit down and said faintly.

“Do you have to think about this yourself? It’s up to you!”

Wang Xian shook his head. He couldn’t understand the thoughts of this beauty. He shook his head and took a sip of tea.

“I want to follow you!”

Ling Jian ‘er looked at Wang Xian with a twinkle in her eyes. As she spoke, she slowly lowered her head.

“PFFT!”

When Wang Xian heard her words, he revealed an extremely shocked expression. He couldn’t help but stand up.

“D * mn, Ling Jian ‘er, you... You Are... I’m telling you, I can have a wife!”

Wang Xian widened his eyes and sized her up.

What was this cold woman doing?

Confessing.

F * ck!

She was actually confessed to!

Ling Jian ‘er was slightly stunned when she heard Wang Xian’s words. Her expression changed drastically. “It’s alright. Your Wife is definitely not my match. I Won’t hurt her either!”

When Wang Xian heard her words, the corner of his mouth couldn’t help but Twitch violently.

However, what Wang Xian and Ling Jian ‘er didn’t know was that at a height of more than 10,000 meters, a white-haired middle-aged man and an old man were looking down.

When they saw Ling Jian ‘ER’s performance, the corner of their lips couldn’t help but Twitch.

This was especially so for the white-haired middle-aged man. His ice-cold face started to change.

His daughter actually said such words?

“Sigh!”

But soon after, he sighed. His former daughter was also extremely cheerful and lively.

Now, she was extremely cold. She didn’t even acknowledge him as her father. Her entire personality had changed, and she was completely frozen.

Everything was because of him!

Especially that sentence, “Your wife isn’t my match.”.

As a father, he knew what that sentence meant. This made his eyes slightly moist.

“Sect leader, the Demonic Lin Beast beside this young man is a demon soul. Looks like he is the nameless sword demon. Jian ‘er might have a good impression of that young man!”

The old man at the side looked at Wang Xian with a twinkle in his eyes and said.

“HMM, this young man is not bad. I have no objection to their matter!”

As the white-haired middle-aged man spoke, a bitter look appeared on his face.

“Ling Jian ‘ER, you are thinking too much. Not only do I have one wife, but I also have six. Moreover, your strength is not the strongest among them!”

Wang Xian felt that Ling Jian ‘er had a problem in her heart.

She confessed to him without any reason and even said something without any reason.

Wang Xian, a normal person, found it hard to accept it. Moreover, Ling Jian ‘er was not outstanding in any way.

In terms of beauty, she wasn’t as pretty as Ling Jian ‘er. In terms of figure, she wasn’t as cold as a Jia Ya!

Wang Xian really didn’t have any thoughts about her.

“Six... Six?”

She frowned slightly and looked deep in thought. “Are they on good terms?”

“Yes, of course, they’re very good!”

Wang Xian said directly. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“That works too. I can blend in with them!”

Ling Jian ‘er thought for a moment and said again.

Wang Xian was stunned. He stared at Ling Jian ‘ER in disbelief.

In the sky, the white-robed middle-aged man’s body trembled. His face revealed endless bitterness as he shook his head slowly.

All of this was his own fault!

He was the daughter of the sect leader of the Heavenly Sword sect, yet he had to share a husband with someone else. This was something that was impossible in the past!
