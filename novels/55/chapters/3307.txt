3308 3307 scorpion destruction Emperor City

“Hong, Hong, Hong!”

The group of Universe Knights roared and attacked the blood-red chains.

At the same time, the entire Scorpion Emperor Grotto-heaven erupted with a terrifying aura.

Green poisonous fog shot up into the sky from the holes.

This poisonous fog was like smoke.

“Someone has invaded our city god Grotto-heaven! Someone has invaded! All citizens of Scorpion Imperial City, prepare for battle!”

“Prepare for battle! Kill, Kill, Kill!”

“Kill, Kill, Kill!”

In an instant, figures shot up into the sky from Scorpion Imperial City and flew towards Scorpion Imperial grotto-heaven.

Over ten million people in the city all rushed over at the same time.

A terrifying energy instantly shot up into the sky.

Faced with the invaders, everyone in the Scorpion Imperial City was united.

“HMPH!”

At the same time, Wang Xian snorted in the Scorpion Emperor Grotto-heaven.

In the entire Scorpion Emperor Grotto-heaven, no living creature could pose any threat to him, even the poisonous scorpion.

“Die!”

Many chains wrapped around the poisonous scorpion. The attacks of the surrounding universe Knight Level 7 experts couldn’t cause much damage when they landed on the chains.

Wang Xian’s dragon claws clawed at the Scorpion once again.

“No, no, no!”

“Run, run, run!”

When the numerous faces on the Scorpion’s head saw Wang Xian’s terrifying attack, all of them revealed terrified expressions.

They let out horrifying screams and shook their bodies in an attempt to escape.

However, in front of Wang Xian, the level 8 universe Knight did not have much power to resist.

The Dragon Claw grabbed onto the scorpion and waves of energy surged into its body.

“Oh no, our city Lord isn’t here. We Aren’t a match for the other party. Run, run, Run Now!”

The eyes of the Level 7 universe knight liches narrowed slightly when they saw this scene.

They knew that they weren’t a match for the other party.

Run!

At this moment, they could only run!

“Can we escape?”

Wang Xian waved his dragon claw and the ferocious faces on the venomous scorpion crumbled.

He kept the venomous scorpion and flapped his incipient saint wings to attack them.

How terrifying was Wang Xian’s speed?

He was comparable to a Level 9 universe knight.

Even if they were experts in speed, they were still far from Wang Xian.

“No, no, don’t kill me!”

“All disciples, run, run!”

The Level 7 universe knights sensed Wang Xian’s speed, and despair appeared in their eyes.

There were liches begging for mercy, and there were liches warning the disciples in Scorpion Emperor City outside.

“Pu, Pu, Pu!”

But without exception, they were easily killed by Wang Xian.

“Huh?”

“Not good. The lords in the Scorpion Emperor’s Cave are no match for the intruders. Let us escape!”

The faces of the disciples of the Scorpion Emperor’s city who were flying over from all directions changed drastically when they heard the voices.

Many of the powerhouses stopped immediately.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

The next moment, a terrifying roar was heard.

Wang Xian flew out from the Scorpion Emperor’s Cave and transformed into the body of a divine dragon.

Currently, his body had already reached the size of 100,000 meters. His terrifying body was like a mountain, and it contained a terrifying pressure and aura.

He swayed his dragon body and swept his dragon tail in all directions.

A greyish energy attacked the surroundings at a terrifying speed.

“Not good, the opponent’s strength is terrifying. Let’s escape quickly!”

The liches in the scorpion imperial city sensed the might coming from Wang Xian and roared in fear.

Boom

However, the terrifying destructive power had already caused the deaths of millions of liches instantly. Their corpses fell towards the ground.

“D * mn it. What kind of powerhouse did our scorpion imperial city offend to be so terrifying!”

Some of the liches in the scorpion imperial city sensed this scene and widened their eyes. They tried their best to escape into the distance.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

“True Dragon Body, Fire Dragon God!”

Wang Xian let out a low roar. His entire body turned into a body of flames. A terrifying flame shot out in all directions.

That terrifying flame made all the liches in the surroundings look horrified.

“You want to escape? Today, this Dragon King will destroy the city!”

Wang Xian’s eyes were filled with killing intent. With a thought, the five elements great mill flew backward.

He flew forward.

The five elements great mill expanded rapidly, reaching a radius of more than 100 million kilometers.

The various acquired Numinous Treasures and acquired Supreme Treasures that were absorbed attacked the liches one by one.

“Run, run, run!”

“Hide in your COSMOS GOD COUNTRY!”

“Run quickly!”

Faced with Wang Xian’s rampage, the scorpion imperial city had no way to resist.

Wang Xian swayed his huge body as flames attacked in all directions.

The surrounding mountain peaks collapsed and the buildings were set ablaze.

Half of the scorpion imperial city was engulfed in a sea of flames.

Coupled with Wang Xian’s terrifying speed, a large number of liches were killed by him.

Only a small number of them were able to escape.

The entire Scorpion Imperial city was being slaughtered by him rapidly. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

At the same time, in the main city of the Lich Kingdom, the Lich City.

The Lich City stood on the body of a skeleton corpse.

The entire skeleton corpse was embedded in the ground. This skeleton corpse was so huge that it was abnormally terrifying.

It was rumored that at the beginning of the universe, life was born in the heaven-splitting prehistoric continent.

When Life was born, it suffered a great calamity and died in it.

Then, it merged with the heaven-splitting prehistoric continent and formed a special paradise.

Hundreds of liches stood excitedly in the huge skeleton’s head.

In the center of them, there was a huge pile of treasures.

When these treasures gathered together, even the great beings of the liches country were moved.

“Hahaha, this time our liches country’s harvest is not bad, every city will get a share of the resources!”

In the center of the huge pile of treasures, the liches king said with a face full of laughter.

“Liches king, this time’s income is at least equivalent to our harvest of over a hundred million years. Hehe, as expected of the strongest force in the surrounding starry skies, the accumulation is indeed rich!”

“Haha, that Dragon Palace still wants to compete with us. At most, there’s a universe Knight Level 8 great being, yet they still dare to compete with our Lich Kingdom. They’re simply courting death!”

“That’s right, even if we offend that Dragon Palace this time, it’s worth it to obtain these treasures!”

Around them, Universe Knight Level 8 liches laughed loudly.

This time, the harvest of their Lich Kingdom was simply too great!

The most important thing was that these gains were very easy for them, and they didn’t have to pay any price.

As for offending the Dragon Palace, they didn’t take it to heart.

Their strength was over 10 times that of the Dragon Palace.

If it wasn’t for the rules of the heaven opening primal continent, if the Dragon King dared to be arrogant in front of them, they would have killed him long ago.
