Chapter 1576: 1576

“You... What did you do to me?”

“You actually broke the energy that was suppressing the dark soul in my body... you...”

The stooped old man’s face was pale as he stared at Wang Xian in fear. His body trembled as he spoke.

“Be a good cripple!”

Wang Xian took a glance at the stooped old man. His arm returned to its human form and gave him a gentle push.

The hunchbacked old man staggered and fell to the ground at the side. His face was filled with panic.

“No, no... Pastor Wang, save me, save me!”

The hunchbacked old man watched Wang Xian leave and became completely flustered. He shouted at Wang Xian with a face full of fear.

However, Wang Xian ignored him and walked into the distance.

A powerhouse who was invaded by the soul of darkness came to him for treatment. He even wanted to use force. Wang Xian naturally wouldn’t let him off easily.

The Soul of darkness that was suppressed in his body was directly knocked away by Wang Xian.

If the soul of darkness were to crash into his body again, the old man would become a cripple.

“However, this old ancestor’s strength was once at the peak of the eighth level of the Seethrough Void Tier!”

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly. He did not kill the old man because of this.

“Save me, save me!”

The hunchbacked old man roared with a face full of pain. His face was extremely ferocious.

He felt a little regretful. Why did he have to use force? Now that he couldn’t act cool, he was killed instead!

“Eighth level of the void interpretation stage, eighth level of the void interpretation stage. With his strength, he can definitely get rid of the dark soul in my body and return me to my peak!”

“No, no!”

As the hunchbacked old man spoke, he gritted his teeth and wanted to chase after Wang Xian’s figure.

However, Wang Xian’s figure had already disappeared.

This made him stand there in despair. His body was trembling non-stop.

“Pastor Wang, save me. Please save me. It was my fault yesterday. Please!”

The next day, when Wang Xian arrived in front of Ling Jian ‘ER’s courtyard, the old man from yesterday ran over and pleaded in fear and trepidation.

“You’re still waiting here. This means that you’re not from a big faction. Are You Alone?”

“No matter who you are, you’d better not bother me. Otherwise, I won’t have any scruples even if I kill you.”

Wang Xian glanced at the old man coldly.

Asking You to show off yesterday and threaten me with force?

In the past, you were at least a peerless powerhouse at level eight of the Seethrough void tier. Now?

Wang Xian shook his head in disdain and came to Ling Jian ‘ER’s courtyard.

For the next two days, Wang Xian and Ling Jian ‘er visited some scenic spots in the ruins of the divine kingdom.

The two of them seemed to have become a couple.

On the fourth day, Ling Jian ‘ER’s turn came for the solitaire martial arts competition of the Solitaire sect.

The solitaire martial arts competition would select the first and second Peerless Heaven’s favorites under the age of 50 and be conferred the title of Heaven’s and Earth’s two heaven’s favorites.

The current Heaven’s and Earth’s young masters were the previous Heaven’s favorites.

However, the current Heaven’s and Earth’s two heaven’s favorites had occupied this title for more than a decade.

With the strength of Heaven’s and Earth’s young masters, unless they were over the age of 50, no one would be able to defeat them.

However, it was not necessarily the case for this competition.

Wang Xian sat on the spectator stand and watched Ling Jian ‘ER’s battle with a young man at the second level of the insight void stage with a smile on his face.

This young man was a disciple of the solipsistic sect. With his strength at the second level of the Seethrough realm, he was equivalent to the number one person under the Heaven and earth.

In the arena, he stared at Ling Jian ‘er coldly and looked down arrogantly.

Under the orders of his two senior brothers in heaven and earth, he would make this girl extremely embarrassed in this battle.

“Begin!”

The deacon at the side shouted softly and announced the start of the competition.

“Bing Jian ‘er, right? Wait a moment, I will...”

“Whoosh!”

That disciple originally wanted to use words to humiliate Ling Jian ‘er, but he did not expect that the other party’s golden light would directly attack him.

“Looks like I have to teach you a good lesson!”

Seeing that the golden light was attacking him, that disciple raised his palm with a cold expression.

A huge green palm directly attacked the golden light.

“Pu Pu Pu!”

However, the golden light easily pierced through the green palm and continued to attack the disciple.

“What?”

The Disciple’s expression changed. He waved his hand and a gust of green wind surrounded his body as he dodged to the side.

“Sou Sou Sou!”

However, at this moment, the golden light split open and instantly struck the disciple.

“Ah!”

A miserable cry came from the disciple’s mouth.

“What? He killed senior brother Lie Feng in one move. That Bing Jian ‘ER’s strength is so terrifying!”

“My God, he killed her in one move. How is this possible? Could it be that Bing Jian ‘er has the cultivation of the third level of the profound void martial stage?”

“This... this... what a terrifying woman. Is there going to be a change in the heaven and Earth’s prodigies this year?”

When Ling Jian ‘er easily defeated the two heaven and Earth’s prodigies, everyone had shocked expressions on their faces. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Another peerless prodigy had risen.

“How is this possible? She... is so powerful!”

On the stage at the very front, when the two heaven and Earth’s prodigies saw that Ling Jian ‘er had actually killed lie Feng in an instant, their expressions were incomparably grave.

Lie Feng’s strength was only one level lower than theirs, yet he was actually killed in an instant.

Even they couldn’t kill him so easily.

“So strong, this woman is really a strange woman!”

Ao Tian’s gaze flickered as he looked at Ling Jian ‘er, his eyes filled with shock.

“This Bing Jian ‘er seems to have a very good relationship with that priest Wang, right?”

Ao Tian slightly narrowed his eyes and said indifferently.

“It’s senior brother. It’s this girl. She’s the last disciple of the patriarch of the Bingxin dynasty, the adopted daughter of the Bingxin King. That priest Wang has been pursuing her!”

“I heard that priest Wang came to the vast area for her. We wanted to let lie Feng teach Bing Jian ‘er a lesson and embarrass that priest Wang, but we didn’t expect...”

The two heaven’s favorites in the sky and on the ground spoke in a low voice, their faces filled with embarrassment.

“A heaven’s favorite. In the entire vast region, there isn’t such an outstanding heaven’s favorite. Moreover, she’s a virgin, TSK TSK!”

Ao Tian’s eyes flickered as he looked at Ling Jian ‘er with a hint of greed and possessiveness in his eyes.

As the supreme force of the only sect, the son of the only sect leader, he had seen too many beautiful women.

In his eyes, beautiful women were just playthings that were slightly beautiful.

However, this Ling Jian ‘er was different.

“Only such a beauty can be worthy of me!”

Ao tian mumbled softly. His gaze swept across Wang Xian who was sitting on the seat and the corner of his mouth curled up slightly.

“Call Bing Jinghuan from the Bingxin Empire over!”

Ao Tian said plainly to the two heaven’s favorites in the sky and Earth beside him.

The two of them were stunned when they heard ao Tian’s words. Their faces were filled with shock. Then, their eyes lit up.

“Yes, it’s senior brother. Only such a heaven’s favorite is worthy of senior brother!”

“That priest Wang, what right does he have to compare with you!”

As the two of them spoke, they moved and flew towards Bing Jing Huan.
