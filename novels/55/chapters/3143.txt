Chapter 3144: 3143 was exterminated, and the Milky Way shook

The race was exterminated, and the prosperous leaves fell.

Wang Xian hovered above the dragon-descendant race and watched the extermination of a primary race in the universe.

The crescent moon shone in the sky, showing this desolate scene.

Wang Xian was monitoring everything in the dragon-descendant race, monitoring everyone.

There were already more than a dozen universe knights who were observing the surroundings. He merely glanced at them and gave them a warning before ignoring them.

“Dragon Palace, most of the powerhouses of the dragon race have been annihilated. The rest of the ordinary disciples have either died or escaped.”

Half an hour later, Prime Minister Gui flew over and reported to Wang Xian.

“HMM, very good. Let’s go and collect the treasures of the Dragon Race.”

Wang Xian nodded.

He was very satisfied with this battle.

There were almost no casualties among the 500,000 members of the Dragon Palace in this battle.

This was very rare in a race war.

He moved and immediately flew toward the Dragon Mountain.

At the side, the sky array carried the corpses of three universe knights and began to check the location of their universe God nation.

After destroying the dragon race, it was time to count the spoils of war.

As a race that had stood for billions of years, they had a huge amount of resources.

“Woo Woo Woo!”

According to the memories in his mind, Wang Xian flew towards a mountain peak.

When he landed below, a violent and oppressive voice was heard.

It was a venerable-level blazing turtle-winged beast without a leader.

This venerable-level battle pet was sold by Wang Xian and the rest. It was auctioned off by the dragon-born race.

Now, this battle pet was placed at the foot of the mountain peak.

Wang Xian didn’t understand why he didn’t order it to make a move during the battle just now. However, he knew that a place that could be guarded by a venerable level battle pet was definitely not a simple place.

According to the memories in his mind, this was the treasure vault of the dragon race.

How many treasures would a race have for billions of years?

It was simply unimaginable!

“I hope it will bring some surprises.”

Wang Xian mumbled. The dragon’s might emitted from his body and headed straight for the supremacy-level battle pet.

“Roar! Roar!”

Feeling the familiar dragon’s might from Wang Xian, the battle pet laid on the ground and did not dare to resist.

“Dragon King, I have found the location of the Divine Kingdom of the Dragon tribe leader and the rest. I will go and retrieve their universe divine kingdom.” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

At this moment, the voice of the Heaven Array was heard from the sky.

“Go!”

Wang Xian nodded with a smile and entered the treasure vault.

“As expected of the treasure vault of the Dragon tribe. There are so many treasures just after entering.”

The moment he stepped into the treasure vault, Wang Xian’s shocked voice was heard.

Just as Wang Xian and the Dragon Palace started to collect the spoils of war, the Milky Way was in an uproar.

“The dragon race has been completely exterminated. All the venerables of the dragon race have been killed!”

“The Dragon Palace has exterminated the Dragon Race.”

The news of the Dragon Palace exterminating the dragon race was spread out.

Even though everyone had a premonition that the dragon race would be exterminated, the news spread so quickly that it shocked countless people.

Especially the ordinary citizens of the nine swords race and the Dragon Race.

They stared at the news in a daze.

The Dragon Palace did not attack the other planets in the territory of the descendants of dragons, nor did they attack the ordinary citizens.

They were now watching as their race and backer were exterminated. Each and every one of them was filled with fear and did not know what to do.

Thinking back to a month ago, they had mocked the dragon palace. In just a month, they had already been exterminated.

Although the nine-blade race had not been exterminated, they had been scared away and disappeared from the Milky Way.

Only the ordinary citizens were left behind.

One was exterminated and the other fled.

This was the might of the Dragon Palace.

However, when the news of the Dragon Palace having more than 20 universe knights spread, it caused a huge sensation.

More than 20 universe knights?

What kind of concept was that?

Even the mist race, the strongest race in the Milky Way, only had nine universe knights on the surface.

And the Dragon Palace had more than 20.

This made some of the weaker universe primary races in the Milky Way have to take a look at the power of the Dragon Palace.

They had to think of ways to curry favor with the Dragon Palace so that they wouldn’t be targeted by the dragon palace and be annihilated.

…

“Phew, fortunately, the Dragon Palace’s first target is not our nine swords race. Otherwise, it would be our nine swords race that would be annihilated now.”

At this moment, countless people of the nine swords race were sitting on all kinds of powerful warships, islands, and divine weapons in the void. When they saw the information on the AI, their faces revealed a look of relief.

There was still a gap between their nine swords race and the dragon race.

If the Dragon Palace attacked them first, all of them would die.

“This group of people are from the Milky Way?”

On the right side of the nine swords race’s group, two figures quickly flew over.

Their gazes swept over, and one of them had a glint in his eyes.

“I checked. It should be the nine blade race. A war has broken out in the Milky Way and a power called the dragon palace has risen up and destroyed an elementary universe race.”

An elder beside him said calmly.

“The Dragon Palace? Do you think Lou Shan and the others’deaths are related to the Dragon Palace? Everyone in the Milky Way knows the strength of our sect and they don’t dare to touch Lou Shan and the others.”

“Moreover, with the strength of the few primary races in the Milky Way, the only ones who could leave Lou Shan behind were the foggy and skeleton races.”

The middle-aged man guessed.

“No matter which force or powerhouse, as long as they are found, their nine races will be exterminated.”

The old man growled in a low voice.

They looked ahead and sped up their flying speed.

…

“This… This Is?”

Wang Xian was unaware of the situation in the outside world. At this moment, Wang Xian was in the treasure vault of the dragon race. He looked at the scene in front of him with a face full of shock.

In front of him, an extremely huge Asian dragon was tightly entangled by a one-meter-thick chain.

The entire Asian dragon was over 10,000 meters in size.

Thump! Thump! Thump

The faint sound of a beating heart could be heard. The entire Asian Dragon still had a hint of life left in it.

Under Wang Xian’s senses, this Asian Dragon possessed a strong divine dragon bloodline. It was considered a powerful dragon species even in the Dragon Palace.

However, its extremely weak body made its aura extremely weak.

Below its huge body, there was a pool that was about 10 meters in size. There were about 1,000 liters of dragon blood in it.

There was a huge wound on the body of the Asian dragon above the pool.

“Was this Asian dragon suppressed here by the Dragon Race? Has It been absorbing dragon blood from the Dragon Race?”

Wang Xian was a little shocked.

He could tell that this Asian dragon’s strength was not simple in the past. He could also tell that the powerful chains had sealed this Asian dragon for a very, very long time.

It could have been hundreds of millions of years, or even more.
