Chapter 1094: 1095 void interpretation

Translator: 5496903

“Boom!”

The fire tail of the divine dragon was a supernatural ability that Wang Xian had comprehended when he was at transcendent level seven. His attack required the help of the body of the Divine Dragon.

With the terrifying fire attribute energy coupled with his powerful physical body, he was able to unleash his attack.

When Wang Xian’s attack landed on the Blood Shadow, the leader of the Blood Barbaric Demon Beast’s expression changed slightly.

His body moved and turned into a blood mist.

The blood mist attached to the dragon’s tail and produced a sizzling sound.

Drops of fresh blood fell to the ground.

The leader of the three-meter-long blood barbarians flashed and stared at Wang Xian with a cold gaze.

“Leader, the group of demonic beasts hiding in the void is very terrifying!”

The other three half-step void interpretation blood barbarians appeared beside him and spoke with a terrified expression.

Twenty figures that were emitting light and a powerful creature that was emitting light and darkness had actually killed 21 of their comrades in an instant.

Among them, 20 were at transcendent level nine and one was at half-step void interpretation!

This made their hearts palpitate.

They were 100% certain of death!

“They can only unleash a terrifying killing intent in an instant. There’s no need to be afraid!”

The eyes of the leader of the blood barbarians flickered as he scanned the surroundings of Wang Xian.

After killing 21 terrifying creatures, they immediately vanished into the void and prepared for a second assassination attempt.

“Set up the blood barbarian space!”

The leader of the blood barbarians trembled as red and black energy was emitted from his body. His two sharp claws trembled slightly.

Blood bugs were swimming around.

The other three blood barbarians released the same attack. The red and black space immediately covered an area of four to five kilometers.

“The darkness attribute still wants to defend against Ao Yao’s assassination?”

Wang Xian’s eyes revealed a hint of mockery. His body moved and his swaying body attacked them directly.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

In the space, streams of blood bugs charged towards Wang Xian’s body. However, this attack did not leave any traces.

“Roar!”

The dragon soared and roared. Wang Xian’s entire body was covered in flames. His dragon tail swept across and immediately dispersed the red and black areas in the area.

Four half-step void interpretation demonic beasts appeared in four directions and attacked him in an instant.

“Boom!”

Wang Xian’s body trembled as he used his dragon tail and dragon claws to meet them.

“Buzz!”

In the air, ao Yao appeared beside a blood barbarian demonic beast. That Blood Barbarian demonic beast hurriedly dodged.

After witnessing Ao Yao killing a companion of the same level in an instant, this blood barbarian demonic beast would not give ao Yao any chance.

Wang Xian was no match for four half-step void interpretation demonic beasts alone. Even if he were to face three of them, he would be in great danger.

Fortunately, he had ao Yaoyao by his side to restrain them. He could definitely restrain two of them.

“Ahhhh!”

At this moment, the screams of the blood barbaric demonic beasts could be heard from the surroundings.

There were a total of 33 blood barbaric demonic beasts. After 21 of them were killed by the strange demon, there were only 12 of them.

Four half-step void interpretation demonic beasts were fighting against Wang Xian.

There were another eight of them.

Those eight demonic beasts were completely slaughtered by the twenty strange demonic beasts.

In less than a minute, the eight blood barbarian demonic beasts were dead.

This infuriated the leader of the blood barbarian demonic beasts. His attacks were also getting more and more explosive.

“I heard the blood barbarian demonic beasts screaming from afar. Commander Wang is killing them. We can’t hold them back. Kill them!”

“Kill, Kill! With Sir Wang around, we have a great chance of defending our home!”

At the city wall, everyone was shouting excitedly.

In the distance, commander Wang was slaughtering the blood demon beasts. At the bottom of the city wall, they were also slaughtering the wandering sea demons.

There were only tens of thousands of wandering sea demons. With the number of these beasts, holy sea town could easily deal with them. In fact, it was even very easy.

Victory was right in front of their eyes. Everyone was extremely excited!

The battle continued. Twenty Strange Beasts joined the battle between Wang Xian and the rest.

Although they only had the combat strength of an extraordinary level nine, with twenty of them, they could still threaten a half-step void interpretation level blood barbarian beast!

This caused their battle to be in a stalemate.

It was difficult for Wang Xian to kill them, and it was also difficult for them to kill Wang Xian.

However, he was not in a hurry. When Ao Yaoyao and his supernatural powers could be unleashed again, he would have a great chance to kill one of them.

Moreover, the sustained combat strength of the Divine Dragon was far superior to these blood barbarian demonic beasts.

As long as he was exhausted, he would definitely not lose.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

After fighting for more than ten minutes, Wang Xian’s body was left with scars that were one to two meters long.

These scars were not fatal.

There were also scars on the bodies of the four half-step void interpretation blood barbarian demonic beasts.

The entire battle was extremely intense.

“Damn you guys. I was hunting humans to advance to the void interpretation stage, but I was stopped by you bunch of damn creatures. Your crimes are unforgivable!”

“I want to kill all of you. I want to avenge my dead subordinates!”

All of a sudden, the leader of the Blood Barbaric Demon Beast moved and distanced himself from Wang Xian by 2,000 meters.

It stared at Wang Xian with a ferocious gaze and growled in a low voice. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“You want to kill millions of humans. The ones who deserve to die are all of you!”

Wang Xian stared at the leader of the Blood Barbaric Demon Beast with his ice-cold Dragon Eyes. A mouthful of dragon flames shot toward another blood barbaric demon beast in front of him.

“Devour!”

The eyes of the leader of the blood barbaric demon beasts slowly turned blood-red. His eyes were filled with madness and violence as he roared loudly.

“King, no, don’t, we...”

When he finished his sentence, the other three blood barbaric demon beasts suddenly revealed a look of horror.

“Come here and give up your lives. We will avenge you. I will slaughter everyone here. I will slaughter all of them!”

The leader of the Blood Savage Beast Roared. He raised his head and his entire chest started to move!

“Hiss!”

A tearing sound was heard. His chest suddenly split open, revealing a cavity full of blood.

The blood on his chest started to move and slowly turned into a mouth.

“I will sacrifice myself for the King!”

A Blood Savage Beast’s eyes revealed despair. His body trembled as he flew over and entered the blood red mouth on his chest.

“Ah!”

“Sacrifice for the King!”

“Sacrifice for the King!”

The other two blood barbarian demonic beasts also flew over while trembling as they roared loudly.

“I swear on my blood that I will slaughter everyone here, especially you!”

The leader of the blood barbarian demonic beasts stared at Wang Xian abruptly.

“Hehehe!”

A horrifying voice came out of its mouth.

Wang Xian’s expression changed slightly.

“Gold crack void!”

Without the slightest hesitation, he directly released the metal attribute divine ability, gold crack void.

“Buzz!”

At this moment, the red and black energy that pervaded the surroundings slowly shrank into the body of the leader of the blood barbaric demon beasts.

The powerful attack of gold crack void was directly blocked by the red and black energy.

The three blood barbaric demon beasts were swallowed by the ferocious mouth on its chest, and the red-black energy slowly entered its body.

Its aura, its blood, its violence, and its darkness increased at an astonishing speed.

It was about to break through!

A Demon Beast at the profound void tier!
