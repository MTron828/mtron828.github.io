Chapter 1626: 1626 set out to conquer the flowing sea region

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

120,000 people, vast and mighty. Although their numbers couldn’t reach the tens of billions of people, they were all the strongest experts in the vast region.

The weakest was at the ninth rank of the extraordinary realm. What kind of concept was this.

Any one of them, if placed in the flowing sea region, would be able to establish a thousand year clan.

These 120,000 people were the strongest existences among the hundreds of billions of people in the vast region. Each of them could be said to be one-in-a-million experts.

Especially at the front.

Six elders stood at the front.

The three ancestors of the Wuji Empire all rode on the Dark Shadow Lion of the eighth rank of the profound void tier.

The ten-meter-long dark shadow lion had a dignified face, and terrifying demonic qi shook. Its dignity was inviolable.

The supreme headmaster stood on the body of a giant green bird of the eighth rank of the profound void tier. The giant green bird, which had spread its wings and was 20 meters long, also emitted a sharp edge.

The two ancestors of the southern royal family rode on the two Sky Wing Wolf Kings with huge wings.

Six top-tier experts of the ninth rank of the profound void tier, invincible existences in the vast area.

“Hiss, the three super powers almost used all their strength. This time, it’s for Real!”

“The Wuji Empire actually has three experts of the ninth rank of the profound void tier. My God, didn’t they only have two in the past?”

“Invincible, this lineup is simply invincible. Six experts at level nine of the profound void tier and more than forty experts at level eight of the profound void tier killing the dragon-phoenix Empire is a piece of cake!”

“The dragon-phoenix Empire is at most fifty-fifty with the lone cult and the southern royal family. But now, the strength of the Wuji Empire is almost no weaker than the two super powers. This battle, there is a 100% chance of winning!”

“We should destroy the dragon-phoenix Empire in the flowing sea region and let you be arrogant. Since you dare to come to our vast region and start a war, you deserve to die!”

In the divine kingdom ruins, everyone looked up in awe as all the factions in the vast region flew towards the flowing sea region.

Everyone was filled with excitement towards this journey.

No matter what, the dragon-phoenix Empire was an outsider and an invader.

They were the ones who started the war. Now that all the forces in the vast region had joined forces, it was exciting.

The invader must die!

However, at this moment, Feng Luan, Lan Qingyue, and the others who were standing on Xiao Lan didn’t know that the entire army of the vast region was chasing them.

“That’s the Barbarian Goddess’giant beast. There seem to be many people on it. What are they trying to do?”

“The Wuji Dynasty has decided to deal with them. I think the barbarian goddess and the dragon-phoenix dynasty are running away!”

“They should be heading toward the flowing sea area. It seems that they are going to run away!”

“If they don’t run away, the Wuji dynasty will be able to destroy them directly. They are the ones who are going to start a war in our vast area!”

Feng Luan, Lan Qingyue, and the others, who were standing on Xiao Lan’s figure and had sensitive ears, could faintly hear the voices coming from below.

This made their expressions turn ugly.

“The Wuji dynasty’s actions are even more disgusting than the solipsistic sect and the southern royal family. If they want to fight, they’ll fight. Now, they’re fighting for benefits, and they’re standing at the moral high ground, fighting for the Peace of the vast area? It’s really shameful!”

Sun Lingxiu said with some disgust.

“We have to take revenge for this!”

Lan qingyue pursed her lips. “My cultivation base has just stepped into the eighth rank of the profound void tier. Soon, I will be able to fight against a ninth rank profound void tier expert. In two to three years, little blue will be able to evolve again!”

“After evolving, little blue can sweep across the entire vast area!”

“We don’t have to rush. One or two years. We can afford to wait!”

Feng Luan looked down at the territory below. Her face was filled with strong confidence.

In the face of this situation, if she were to rely on herself, she might be depressed and disappointed.

However, with Wang Xian, Lan Qingyue, and the Dragon Palace around, other than a hint of unwillingness, she didn’t feel too disappointed.

Just as Lan Qingyue said, if she was given another two to three years, wouldn’t it be easy for Xiao Lan to turn into a giant beast in the longevity realm and sweep across the entire vast area?

“One day, we will make a comeback and make the entire vast area respect us as Kings!”

Behind them, a group of important ministers from the Dragon and Phoenix Empire said with determination.

Xiao Lan was traveling at a fast speed. With her speed, she could reach the Liuhai region in a day.

...

“Eh? That’s... ? That’s the Wuji dynasty, the solipsistic sect, and the southern royal family, as well as a group of first-rate and second-rate forces!”

“What’s going on? A few hours ago, the dragon-phoenix dynasty fled to the flowing sea region. All the forces in our vast region are heading in that direction as well. Are they trying to kill us?”

“Oh my God, almost all the forces in our vast region are making a move. They’re trying to destroy the dragon-phoenix Dynasty!”

Feng Luan rode on Little Blue’s back as the three super factions flew behind her.

When everyone in the city below saw this scene, shock appeared on their faces.

The three super factions could already represent the vast region.

The vast region wanted to destroy the flowing sea region?

Time slowly passed. Feng Luan, Guan Shuqing, and the others used a day to return to the flowing sea region.

Everyone from the Dragon and Phoenix Empire returned to the Imperial City.

Feng Luan followed the Dragon Palace and returned to the Dragon Palace.

“Judging from the situation of Little Xian, he should be resurrecting soon!”

The group of girls came to the dragon pool immediately. They looked at the dragon body lying inside and said softly.

This time, they did not take the failure of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire and the Dragon Palace to heart.

Although they failed, the Dragon Palace had received a huge improvement.

When Wang Xian woke up, they could still continue the battle.

Time passed day by day. All the forces in the vast region were approaching the Liuhai region bit by bit.

Feng Luan and the rest had no idea that the three major forces had come to destroy the dragon-phoenix Empire.

As time passed, Wang Xian’s body was already formed in the Dragon Pool.

The 150-meter-long dragon body was shining with a five-colored radiance.

The five elements circulated in his body. He lay there quietly like a divine object.

“I’m just a little bit away from fusing the heart of light and darkness with my body!”

Wang Xian, who had long regained consciousness, felt his body and revealed an excited expression.

The current him could be completely resurrected, but he did not choose to wake up. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The heart of Light and darkness had been completely fused, but he wanted to fuse the heart of Light and darkness with the body of five elements.

During the near one year of resurrection, 60 to 70 percent of the time was spent on the balance between the heart of Light and darkness and the seven attributes.

Now, he was at the final step.

Once he succeeded, Wang Xian would be able to grind the five elements above his head and step on the Yin and yang poles.

At that time, his combat strength would receive a huge boost!

It might not be comparable to half-step longevity, but it should not be too difficult for him to kill a ninth-level profound void martial artist.
