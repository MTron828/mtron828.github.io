Chapter 1445: 1445, human-demon graveyard

“News from the Demon Beast Clan. Seven days later, they invited all the forces in the Liuhai region to attend the ceremony in the human-demon graveyard. They want to live in peace with US humans. What should we do?”

In the Flaming Sun City of the dragon-phoenix dynasty, this place had become the temporary base of the Liuhuang Alliance.

This was the center of the Liuhuang Alliance’s forces.

In a circular hall, Feng Luan, sect leader Ling, sect leader Yi, and the King of the Light Dragon Kingdom sat at a round table.

Around them, there were more than ten middle-aged and old men surrounding them.

As the king of the Light Dragon Kingdom spoke, his gaze swept over sect leader Ling and Feng Luan.

Although the current flowing Emperor Alliance was dominated by the four of them, the true core still depended on the dragon-phoenix dynasty and the Sky Sword sect.

“The Demon Beast clan is holding a ceremony to establish the Demon Beast dynasty in the human-demon graveyard. Of course, we have to go there. According to the information I got, once the Demon Beast dynasty is established, they will have two to three thousand insightful emptiness realm experts!”

“The level-six insightful emptiness realm experts far surpass us and the bloody flow dynasty. They will become the most powerful force in the Liuhai area!”

“Moreover, the Demon Beast Clan has signed a peace treaty with US humans. We have to participate in this!”

Feng Luan sat there and said slowly with a twinkle in her eyes.

“Okay!”

Sect leader Ling nodded slowly from the side.

“Dragon and Phoenix Queen, how many people do we have to send over? We are so nervous with the blood flow empire now!”

A king of the Empire looked at Feng Luan and asked.

“I’ll call Wang Xian and ask him to make preparations. If we send half of our forces, we don’t have to worry about the bloodshed empire!”

“During this period, the bloodshed empire will not start a dispute with us. In fact, for the next few years or even longer, they will not attack us unless they are absolutely confident!”

“So you don’t have to worry and you don’t have to be afraid of the bloodshed empire!”

Feng Luan’s gaze swept across the members of the Flowing Emperor Alliance as she said calmly.

“What the Dragon and Phoenix Queen said makes sense. No matter what, they absolutely won’t make a move unless they have absolute confidence. With that Lord around, they won’t dare to make any sneak attacks!”

Sect leader Ling and the others slowly nodded their heads.

In a short span of three days, Feng Luan was basically the main focus of all their matters.

Sect leader Ling was very strong, but he was not able to control the overall situation.

This was a matter of strategy and vision. Feng Luan was able to solve everything quickly and give the best answer.

They even felt that they were standing beside the dragon and Phoenix Queen and had the illusion of obeying the monarch’s orders!

After a few times, the others basically did not express their opinions. After Feng Luan said it, they pondered for a while and could not find any problems. Basically, they followed this plan.

Another reason was that they also knew that the monstrous heaven’s favorite, Wang Xian, and another level six Seethrough void martial artist, who had been hiding all this while, did not belong to the Liuhuang Alliance and had their own forces.

However, the Queen of Dragons and Phoenixes was able to get Wang Xian to make a move.

With their powerful strength and unparalleled control, they were led by Feng Luan.

“Everyone, get ready. We will set off in three days!”

“Yes!”

As Feng Luan spoke, everyone replied.

...

“We will go together.”

When Feng Luan came to tell Wang Xian about this matter, he was looking at the information in the communication stone plate and said with a smile on his face.

“Yes, the establishment of the Demon Beast Empire. I wonder what kind of structure it is. Is it a three-way tripod or...”

Feng Luan sat opposite Wang Xian and looked at him.

“You will know when the time comes!”

Wang Xian smiled and placed the communication stone plate into his interspatial ring. A mysterious smile appeared on his face.

“Is there any good news?”

Feng Luan looked at him and recalled some information that Wang Xian had revealed in the past. She asked curiously.

“There isn’t any good news yet.”

Wang Xian shook his head and didn’t say anything else. Instead, he leisurely poured a cup of water.

He placed the dried tea leaves into the water. The tea leaves immediately spread out as though they had just been picked. The green tea leaves emitted the fragrance of the tea.

Just like his original plan, it would be time for him to reap the rewards very soon.

When that time came, the entire Liuhai region would be his world.

He smiled and took a sip of the tea gently.

Feng Luan rolled her eyes at Wang Xian when she saw that he didn’t say anything. After a brief exchange with him, she left to settle some matters.

Recently, regardless of whether it was the Liuhuang Alliance or the Heaven’s pride competition in the Dragon and Phoenix Empire, she had been very busy.

She wasn’t as carefree as Wang Xian.

Three days passed very quickly. In the early morning, more than five hundred insightful void martial artists from the dozen factions of the Liuhuang Alliance gathered outside Flaming Sun City.

Apart from insightful emptiness realm experts, there were also about two thousand half-step insightful emptiness realm experts.

This was half of the flowing Emperor Alliance’s strength.

“Set off!”

Feng Luan glanced at everyone and ordered with a smile on her face.

“Let’s go to the human-monster graveyard!”

A king shouted softly and the group flew into the sky, heading toward the human-monster graveyard.

Flaming Sun City was only a few hundred thousand kilometers away from the human-monster graveyard.

With their speed, they would be able to arrive within three days. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

This speed was not slow. Even if they circled around the earth, it would only be 40,000 kilometers long.

“More than a year ago, this was the place where Lord Wang Xian was famous. The nameless sword demon shook the cemetery of the humans and demons!”

One of the kings from the Liuhuang Alliance looked at Wang Xian and said with a smile.

“That’s right. Nowadays, the reputation of the nameless sword demon is still spreading in the cemetery of the humans and demons. Even the demonic beasts have to be respectful when they meet Lord Wang Xian!”

Voices of conversation could be heard.

Wang Xian smiled from the front and looked ahead.

After three days, they had entered the territory of the demi-human cemetery.

The group of people was Majestic. There were more than 500 insightful emptiness realm experts. This formation caused a huge commotion when they entered the demi-human cemetery.

“People from the Liuhuang Alliance, people from the Liuhuang Alliance have arrived!”

“As expected of one of the three major factions in the flowing sea region. Over 500 insightful void realm experts have arrived!”

“Nameless sword demon has also arrived. Who would have thought that he, who isn’t even 30 years old, would have the strength of a level 6 insightful void realm expert? A top-tier expert from one of the three major factions?”

When they arrived at the human gathering place in the human-demon graveyard, the humans there looked over at them with astonished expressions.

This was a power that could fight against the blood flow empire!

“Eh? Look to the right. That’s the blood emperor flag. The experts from the blood flow empire have arrived!”

At this moment, exclamations sounded from below. Everyone looked to the right and saw the experts from the blood flow empire flying over.

The two forces had arrived!
