Chapter 670: Xiao Yu’s Battle (1)

Dressed in golden armor like a Heavenly General, the old man looked around with a smiling face.

Behind him were a few hundred people in golden armor too.

“Second Grandpa, according to the news we got, the current Underworld has completely gone downhill. But now, it doesn’t seem to be that bad since there are a few hundred Inborn Experts!” said the young man beside the armored elder who was staring at the Martial Artists of the Underworld with eyes full of golden radiance.

“That’s due to the spiritual energy waterfall. Half a month is good enough to undergo a complete change!”

The old armored man was also beaming with golden radiance in his eyes. He swept a gaze at the Martial Artists below. “Not bad. After cleansing, there will be many potential cultivators!”

“Who’s in charge over here?”

The old armored man slightly lifted his head up, and his voice reverberated through the air.

“Guys, we’re from Dragon Sect, and we call the shots here!”

Lan Qingyue cupped her fist once again to those experts that came out from the Huang Cauldron world.

“Hur? The in-charges are a few pretty girls. Dragon Sect? From now on, the Dragon Sect will join Primeval Chaos Immortal Sect and become our disciples,” the old armored man said to Lan Qingyue in a domineering way.

“Jin Kunming, they belong to Yellow Sky Immortal Sect. You’re too late! ” the old man in golden clothing said to the old armored man coldly.

“Hur?”

Upon hearing the words, the old armored man darkened his expression. “Did you just say we’re too late?”

“That’s right!”

The old man in golden clothing nodded gently with a beaming face as he exchanged a glance with the other old man.

“We, the Dragon Sect, will not join any Immortal Sects!”

At this time, Xiao Yu lifted her eyebrows and answered upon hearing their conversation.

“Haha, Feng Jinqing. Did you hear that? They disagree with joining Yellow Sky Immortal Sect!”

Hearing what Xiao Yu said, the old armored man who was sulking burst out a clap of laughter.

“Stupid girl!”

The young man beside Feng Jinqing glared at Xiao Yu angrily.

“You’re the stupid one! So dumb. Who says we’re joining the Yellow Sky Immortal Sect?”

Xiao Yu returned that young man a death stare immediately.

“You need some teaching!”

Seeing Xiao Yu glaring at him, the young man pointed at her with slight embarrassment.

“You deserve a beating!”

Xiao Yu beckoned with her fingers without showing any feebleness. On top of that, her face was full of contempt.

“Haha, interesting. The wicked prince of the Huang Cauldron world is challenged by a lass from the real world. How embarrassing!”

At this time, the young man beside the old armored man, Jin Kunming, trolled the other young man.

“Jin Huiao, shut up, will you? If you’re not convinced, you can spar with me!”

Upon hearing what Jin Huiao said, that young man was infuriated.

“Haha, I was not the one who said you deserve a beating!”

Jin Huiao raised an eyebrow and trolled him.

“Lass, don’t assume that because you’re a girl, I won’t bully you. Wait till I teach you a lesson!”

That young man jumped, and his green robe and white shirt billowed without any wind. His long hair gave him the classic look of a handsome boy.

However, he was slightly furious.

“Idiot. Just a slight provocation and you’re losing your cool!”

Seeing that the young man was staring daggers at her, Xiao Yu snorted.

Lan Qingyue, Sun Lingxiu, and the rest laughed but said nothing.

None of the people before them were Immortal-class. With the few of them around, they had nothing to be afraid of. Moreover, Xiao Xian would be back in no time.

They could still run!

“You...you...”

The young man was raging while Jin Huiao and some of the young men beside him were sneering at him.

“Lass, I’ll make you kneel before me and beg for my mercy!”

“Just you alone?”

Xiao Yu rolled her eyes at him.

“Fine, prepare to receive my strike!”

The young man was boiling with anger. He had just arrived in the real world and was being ridiculed by a lass. To think he was the famous wicked prince in the Huang Cauldron world. Since when had anyone rolled their eyes at him?

With a swift movement, green radiance flashed, and the spiritual sword in his hand struck at a daunting speed.

“You really deserve a beating. Come and lick my shoes!”

Seeing that the young man struck at her, Xiao Yu pouted and went for it.

“This...The sister of the Dragon King and that young man are fighting it out!”

“The group of people standing in the air is too formidable. One might be in danger if they engage in a conflict!”

“Danger? Who knows how strong the Dragon King is? Besides, Princess Xiao Yu apparently knew about the Nine Cauldron Worlds. In my opinion, the Dragon King might not be scared of them!”

“That’s right. There is no boundary to the Dragon King’s strength. If they ever hurt Princess Xiao Yu, it’ll be hard to know who the unlucky one is!” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The group of Martial Artists commented as they watched Xiao Yu dueling with the young man from the Huang Cauldron world.

The Dragon King had always made their jaws drop by killing all the different experts. Many of them were worshipping the Dragon King blindly.

So what if those people came from the space crack?

In the past, during the fight between the Dragon King, Nie Wushuang, and Emperor Qi, they also broke through the space.

“Tsk, what princess? She’s not even fit to be a maidservant!”

Upon hearing the comments from below, the young man spoke scornfully, sending the sword in his hand towards Xiao Yu at a daunting speed.

“Someone with fair and tender skin like you could be a prince? You are the eunuch of the palace, right?”

There was a tinge of surprise flashing in Xiao Yu’s eyes as soon as she saw the incoming spiritual sword. She quickly dodged to one side.

Bam!

The sword brushed across the black armor of Xiao Yu at a fast speed, leaving a faint white mark on it.

“Hur?”

“Hur?”

Xiao Yu was surprised by the speed of the spiritual sword, while the young man was taken aback by the body defense of Xiao Yu.

“Lass, how dare you say I’m a eunuch. It seems that I’ll have to teach you a proper lesson today!”

A furious flame darted out from the eyes of that young man. He could imagine the sneering looks from those scumbags of Primeval Chaos Immortal Sect after the lass said he was a eunuch.

Feng Jinqing remained quiet as he watched the battle continuing between that young man and that girl.

Revealing that young man’s strength to deter the Martial Artists of the real world was not a bad choice either.

“Wind leaves no trace, but a sword leaves a shadow!”

“Sword Shadow!”

The young man fixed his eyes on Xiao Yu, wielding the spiritual sword in his hand. Instantly, gusts of wind energy gathered around the spiritual sword.

Thousands of swords enveloped Xiao Yu.

“Sword Slash!”

Xiao Yu was looking stern as she swung her left arm, bringing out a colossal ivory shield. The other hand stuck the young man with a black sword!

Bam, Bam, Bam!

Thousands of swords left only faint marks on Xiao Yu’s ivory shield despite them being Level 12 spiritual swords. Only mere white dots were left on the shield.

“What?”

There was a slight change in the young man’s expression. He was stunned as his spiritual swords were unable to break through that ivory shield’s defense. Seeing Xiao Yu sweeping in for an attack, he exclaimed loudly.

“Wind Blast!”
