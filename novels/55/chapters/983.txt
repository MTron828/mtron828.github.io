Chapter 984: The battle at the peak of Mountain 0985

Translator: 549690339

“What kind of treasure is that?”

Wang Xian revealed a surprised expression. The Lightning at the peak of the mountain was not as violent as the ones around him.

Instead, it was filled with a kind of life force.

This kind of special life force seemed to be nurtured by something.

Wang Xian’s eyes lit up. His eyes sparkled as he stared at the location of the mountain peak with his gigantic dragon head.

The mountain peak that passed through the dark clouds was more than a thousand meters long. On this one-thousand-meter-long mountain peak, the rocks were no longer ordinary rocks.

There was a blue glow on top of the mountain peak which contained the terrifying power of lightning.

On the mountain peak, there were seven to eight gigantic thunderfish. Each of them was about ten meters in size.

Furthermore, the fins of these thunderfish were extremely huge and emitted a blue glow.

These thunderfish had evolved into wings!

This was especially so for the one closest to the peak. It had the largest body and was bathed in lightning as if it was hibernating.

The entire space was extremely noisy due to the sound of thunder and lightning.

Wang Xian’s pupils contracted slightly. The seven thunderfish that were 10 meters in size were existences of level 8 extraordinaire.

As for the thunderfish that was close to the peak, its strength might not have reached level 9 extraordinaire, but it was still at the peak of Level 8 extraordinaire.

Even Wang Xian could not guarantee that he would be able to defeat it.

“Good, good. There are no beasts at level nine transcendence!”

Wang Xian heaved a sigh of relief in his heart. If a level nine transcendence appeared, Ao Yao would be able to deal with it.

However, Wang Xian was not a match for this group of level eight transcendence beasts.

There were seven level eight transcendence thunder fruits!

Wang Xian scanned his surroundings. Other than the Thunder Fish at the peak of the mountain which did not have any thunder fruits, there was a huge thunder vine beside the other seven thunder fish.

A thunder fruit fell onto the thunder vine, shining brightly.

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly. “I haven’t fought with my full strength since I came to the transcendence continent. Today, I can have a good fight!”

“Ao Yao, Get Ready!”

Wang Xian glanced at him. Ao Yao nodded her head and disappeared instantly. She flew toward the strongest leader of the thunderfish on the mountain peak.

Buzz

Ten seconds later, the figure of the strange demon appeared directly behind the thunderfish. His sharp claws attacked the vital parts of the leader of the thunderfish.

Crackle! Crackle

However, the moment Ao Yao appeared, the lightning around him suddenly became violent.

Bolts of lightning as thick as an arm attacked ao Yao directly.

Ao Yao’s expression did not change at all when he saw this. His body flashed as lightning passed through his body.

At the same time, his sharp claws pierced into the body of the lightning fish.

The violent energy destroyed its body.

“Coo-coo!”

An angry roar was heard. The lightning fish that was attacked widened its eyes and opened its huge mouth. Terrifying Lightning flashed in its mouth.

“Coo-coo, coo-coo!”

It let out a miserable cry.

“Crackle, Crackle!”

Lightning instantly covered its entire body. In an instant, it condensed into a long spear and attacked Ao Yao.

“Death Struggle!”

Ao Yao moved. Black and white shadows flickered and appeared a hundred meters away. His eyes revealed a confident expression.

“Coo-coo!”

The leader of the thunderfish twisted its body in pain, as if it was making a final struggle.

“Ka Ka!”

Suddenly, it opened its mouth. It was at the peak of the mountain above it, the area that was covered in blue light.

Blue-green lightning rays were attracted by it and entered its body directly.

“COO COO!”

Slowly, the leader of the thunderfish calmed down. At the spot where its wound was, flesh and blood slowly squirmed!

Ao Yao’s eyes revealed a serious expression.

“I actually failed. I actually failed to assassinate a thunderfish at the peak of extraordinary level eight!”

Wang Xian revealed a look of surprise. His gaze looked at the blue area of ten square meters at the peak of the mountain again.

“Coo-coo!”

“Coo-coo, coo-coo!”

The sudden appearance of the attack woke up the rest of the thunderfish. Their eyes were suffused with blue light as they stared coldly at Ao Yao.

“Fight!”

Wang Xian saw the situation and moved his body. He swayed his 30-meter-long body and attacked the thunderfish closest to him.

“Gold crack void!”

As soon as he came up, Wang Xian did not hesitate and released his metal attribute divine ability.

Countless golden rays condensed in the air at a height of five to six thousand meters. They tore apart the black clouds and the lightning around them and attacked the extraordinary level eight thunderfish.

“COO COO!”

The ferocious beast let out a low growl and opened its huge mouth!

“Crack!”

A bolt of lightning that was three to four meters thick descended from the sky. Rays of golden rays struck out.

Under the Lightning, the golden rays were extinguished immediately!

“Flame of the Fire Dragon!”

Wang Xian’s expression did not change. He opened his huge mouth and shot out flames that were a hundred meters long.

“COO COO!”

The scales on the thunderfish’s body were shimmering. The compressed power of lightning was emitted from the scales and formed a defense in front of him.

Wang Xian did not stop his speed at all. When the flame of the fire dragon landed on the scales of the thunderfish, it was blocked directly.

However, the scales of the thunderfish dissipated immediately. Wang Xian’s figure had already rushed over.

The dragon claws that were emitting golden light clawed at the thunderfish.

“COO COO!”

The thunderfish’s eyes were extremely cold. When it saw that Wang Xian was only 50 meters away from it, it didn’t panic at all.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

In an instant, the thunderfish scales on its body exploded and covered the sky and earth as they went towards Wang Xian.

“Light and darkness!”

Wang Xian’s heart skipped a beat. Black and white rays of light flashed across his body.

“Buzz!”

The lightning fish scales passed through and Wang Xian’s dragon claws attacked.

The lightning fish was obviously stunned for a moment. However, at this moment, the four-meter-long dragon claws had already grabbed onto its body.

Hiss

The terrifying divine dragon claws landed on it and directly grabbed into its body.

Its huge body was flung forcefully!

Boom

The terrifying divine dragon’s strength caused it to land heavily on the mountain peak.

A violent sound reverberated within a radius of a few thousand meters.

A huge mountain rock rolled downwards.

Roar

Wang Xian let out a roar. The powerful supernatural power of light and darkness caught a torpedo fish off guard and caused it to be severely injured.

He let out a loud roar and initiated the battle.

COO COO

Die

As a divine dragon, Wang Xian was able to sense the information transmitted by the aquatic creatures. Even if the intelligence of the ferocious beasts was not high, they were able to transmit vague information.

Looking at the two thunderfish that were attacking him in an instant, Wang Xian’s eyes flickered.

“Buzz!”

“Bang!”

Ao Yao’s body intercepted one of the thunderfish in an instant. His light-dark body stared at the other six thunderfish strangely. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Wang Xian heaved a sigh of relief. With his strength, he could only deal with one thunderfish at most.

The one just now was severely injured when he was caught off guard. The light-dark void divine ability could no longer be used for a short period of time.

However, Wang Xian was still very knowledgeable when it came to dealing with one!

“Roar!”

He let out a wild roar once again and met with the thunderfish that was attacking him!
