Chapter 1396: 1396, I will be in charge

In front of the residence of the gilded gold family, a group of young men from the families in Xiaoyao city stared at Wang Xian coldly.

This was especially so for the four young men from the top families in Xiaoyao City. Their eyes were filled with coldness.

If this was any other time, they would definitely not provoke the dragon and Phoenix Empire for no reason.

However, the young city lord was coming over immediately.

At the auction, that guy from the dragon-phoenix dynasty did not give face to the young city lord, causing the young city lord to lose face and become extremely angry.

Now that the young city lord was coming over, they naturally had to put on a good show.

Between offending the dragon-phoenix dynasty and pleasing the young city lord, they naturally chose the latter.

Moreover, they were already displeased with that guy from the dragon-phoenix dynasty.

“Young Masters, you might not have understood something!”

At this moment, a voice suddenly sounded.

Around them, a dozen middle-aged elders and young men walked over.

They were all wearing green clothes with a bamboo pattern on it.

The one who spoke was a middle-aged man in a wide robe. His gaze swept across the group of young masters in Xiaoyao City before he approached Wang Xian.

“What master Wang means is that his subordinates have proposed to the gilded gold family, and the Liu family has also proposed to the gilded gold family. What master Wang wants is a fair fight!”

“A fair fight. As a top family in Xiaoyao city, they wouldn’t do anything threatening to a marriage, right?”

As the middle-aged man in a wide robe spoke, he cupped his hands toward Wang Xian.

“HMM?”

The sudden appearance of more than a dozen people stunned everyone. When they gathered around these people, everyone was slightly shocked.

“Bamboo Mountain sect, why did the group of people from Bamboo Mountain sect suddenly interfere?”

“This? What is the relationship between Bamboo Mountain sect and the Dragon and Phoenix Empire? That middle-aged man in broad robes seems to be the eldest son of the current Bamboo Mountain sect leader. He actually addressed that young man as Lord Wang!”

“The Bamboo Mountain sect’s strength can be said to be the most powerful sect within a hundred thousand kilometers. There are three or four insightful void Tier 4 experts within the sect. Although they are not as powerful as the dragon-phoenix Empire, they are definitely not weak!”

When everyone around saw the group of people from the Bamboo Mountain sect that suddenly appeared, their faces revealed a shocked expression.

The Bamboo Mountain sect was definitely the strongest sect within a hundred thousand kilometers. Their strength was even stronger than many dynasties.

What they didn’t expect was that the Bamboo Mountain sect was actually standing on the side of the Dragon and Phoenix dynasty.

If they were to go against the Liu clan, Yao clan, and the others, it would be too much!

“Your Bamboo Mountain sect...”

When the Liu clan’s Yao Dingfeng, young master Li, Young Master Yang, and the others saw the sudden appearance of the Bamboo Mountain sect, their expressions changed drastically.

The Bamboo Mountain sect stood on the side of the dragon and Phoenix dynasty without a care. It was obvious that they wanted to go against them.

A powerful empire and a powerful sect were much stronger than them.

Even though they were the top four families in Xiaoyao city, they still had to be wary of the alliance of the two terrifying forces.

Unless, they never left Xiaoyao City!

The expressions of the top young masters kept changing.

“Eh?”

Wang Xian looked curiously at the group of people who suddenly appeared to speak up for them. He revealed a puzzled expression.

“Sir Wang, I have the honor of seeing your figure in the human-demon graveyard. I have been looking forward to meeting you for a long time!”

A middle-aged man beside the middle-aged man in a loose robe bowed and said to Wang Xian with a fawning expression.

“Oh, I see. Thank you very much!”

Wang Xian nodded with a smile. Then, he looked at the people from the gilded gold tribe and said, “Leader of the gilded gold tribe, you can choose directly. If there is anything, I will take care of it for you!”

The leader of the gilded gold tribe looked at the people of the Liu residence with a bitter expression. Then, he looked at Wang Xian and the rest. Finally, it landed on his daughter.

“This is the marriage of my third daughter. As her parents, I hope that she will marry someone she likes. Young Master Liu and Young Master Duan are both dragons among men. Let my daughter make her own choice!”

As the leader of the gilded gold tribe spoke, he left this matter to my daughter to settle.

Both parties were not to be offended, but everyone knew what the Gilded Gold Clan’s choice was?

When Gilded Gold Yan heard her father’s words, her face lit up with joy and revealed an excited expression.

“Father, I choose...”

“Marriage is a major matter. Parents’orders, matchmakers’words. Since it’s not easy for parents to choose, then I’ll act as a matchmaker. I think the third young miss of the Gilded Gold clan marrying brother Liu of the Liu Residence is just right!”

She looked at Duan Jinming with a blissful expression and immediately spoke. However, before he could speak, a familiar voice came from behind.

Hearing this voice, the expressions of the surrounding people changed slightly.

The pupils of the gilded gold family’s people contracted slightly, and their faces revealed respectful expressions.

“Young City Lord!”

“Young City Lord!”

“Young City Lord!”

The group of youths hurriedly turned their heads and looked behind them.

A long-haired youth dressed in white robes held two balls of toys in his hands. Beside him, a beautiful woman was holding his arm.

The youth walked over, and everyone around him made way for him.

His words caused gilded gold Yan’s expression to change drastically, and his face turned slightly pale.

“How about it, everyone from the Gilded Gold Family? If I am not qualified as a matchmaker, I will tell my father to set me up!”

The young city Lord walked over and a group of young men stood behind him consciously.

He glanced at the gilded gold family and his gaze finally landed on Wang Xian. The corners of his mouth curled up slightly as he said mockingly.

“This, this...” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

The Gilded Gold tribe leader and everyone around him had a drastic change in expression.

“Gilded Gold tribe, do you have any objections?”

The young castellan saw the change in the gilded gold tribe leader’s expression as he stuttered. He stared at him unhappily and asked coldly.

“Hehe, Gilded Gold tribe leader, you can bring your tribe members to the Dragon and Phoenix Empire. When the time comes, I will make you a castellan!”

Wang Xian glanced at the young city lord and spoke to the gilded gold tribe with slight disdain.

The leader of the gilded gold tribe was slightly stunned. He looked at the tribe members beside him.

The tribe members were also moved when they heard Wang Xian’s words. It might be a good choice to become a city lord.

The young city Lord’s expression changed when he heard Wang Xian’s words. He looked slightly ferocious.

“Gilded Gold family, you must know that you are still a member of Xiaoyao City. If you don’t Give Me Face, you are not giving the city Lord’s mansion any face!”

“Today, I, the Xiaoyao soldier, have said it here. The marriage between the Liu Mansion and the gilded gold family has been decided. I will make the decision!”

The young city Lord stood there and swept his gaze across everyone with a domineering expression as he commanded.

Everyone’s breathing paused slightly. Everyone knew that the young city Lord was targeting the young man from the dragon-phoenix Empire.

“Father, mother, the young city Lord has already spoken. He wants third sister to marry into the Liu residence. Wasn’t this what you all wanted to see the most in the past?”

“That’s right, mother. Let’s quickly agree. That Fellow from the dragon-phoenix Empire can not be compared to the young city lord. In front of Xiaoyao City, the dragon-phoenix Empire is nothing.”
