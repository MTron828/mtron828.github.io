“HMM? The Unicorn Ox has broken through. ”

At the same time, in a certain area of the flowing water forbidden ground.

Wang Xian, Long Yin, yin long, Hao, and the flowing moon Saintess were located in a certain area of the flowing water forbidden ground.

Wang Xian saw the terrifying aura coming from the right.

When he heard the Unicorn Ox’s voice, he smiled.

When the Unicorn Ox was about to break through, he had already informed Wang Xian in advance.

Wang Xian had not left this place recently. He had been waiting here all this while.

“Brother Lin Niu has broken through?”

Long Yinhao’s eyes shone when he saw this vast power. He asked with slight excitement.

Lin Niu was his brother-in-law’s mount.

Lin Niu’s breakthrough could greatly increase Wang Xian’s strength.

The stronger Wang Xian was, the more powerful his backer would be.

Now in the Sword and Magic Universe, which Saint Son or Saintess wouldn’t be polite to him.

Not to mention saint son or saintess, even an expert at the peak of the Dominator realm would be polite to him.

After all, he was now the strongest second generation of the rich in the sword and Magic Universe.

“Let’s Go! ”

Wang Xian nodded with a smile. With a wave of his arm, he led them to the Linniu’s location.

“The Dragon King’s mount has broken through to the Heaven’s origin blessed realm! ”

“Hiss, this is really shocking. Even the Dragon King’s mount has reached such a terrifying level. ”

“I didn’t expect that I would be able to witness the breakthrough of the Heaven’s origin blessed realm in my lifetime. This is really shocking. This power is too terrifying. ”

“Let’s go, Lord Dragon King and our flowing water forbidden land’s long yinyin are lovers. They are very close to our flowing water forbidden land. Let’s go over and congratulate them! ”

At the flowing water forbidden land, all the strong disciples immediately rushed over, their faces filled with reverence and respect!

It was the heavenly fate.

There were only two existences of this level in their entire universe.

Furthermore, they were all born during the last calamity.

After the end of the calamity, there was no Third Heaven’s origin creation powerhouse in their entire universe.

One could imagine how difficult it was to give birth to an existence at the Heaven’s origin creation level.

When Wang Xian flew over, Liu Lan had already arrived.

Hopeless Heaven was also rushing over quickly.

In the middle.

The Unicorn Ox was floating there.

In the middle of all the energy.

At this moment, the scales all over his body were displaying divine ash!

There were symbols on them.

A pair of wings had appeared on his original body.

This pair of wings was somewhat similar to the wings of the Asgardian demon god. It looked very domineering.

A pair of heavy pupils had appeared in the Unicorn Ox’s pupils.

There seemed to be countless pupils in his pupils. They were deep and terrifying.

“Congratulations, you have achieved a breakthrough! ” Shui Lan looked at Lin Niu and congratulated him with a smile.

“Thank you! ”

Lin Niu nodded his head happily. He looked at Wang Xian and flew over excitedly. “Boss, I have achieved a breakthrough. I will be your mount in the future. Haha, a mount of the Tianyuan destiny level. It will definitely be awe-inspiring! ”

As he spoke, he had a proud expression on his face.

“Hehe, good, good! ”

Wang Xian smiled.

Lin Niu was someone who knew how to be grateful.

If it weren’t for him this time, it would be impossible for Lin Niu to achieve a breakthrough.

“Congratulations, brother Wang Xian, Congratulations, brother Lin Niu! ”

“You’ve achieved a breakthrough to the Heaven’s fate level. From now on, you’ll have an endless lifespan.”

At this moment, Hopeless Heaven flew over and congratulated him with a smile.

“Congratulations, Lord Linniu!”

“Congratulations, Lord Linniu! ”

Around them, a large number of strong disciples from the flowing water forbidden ground flew over and knelt down respectfully.

A strong cultivator at the Heaven’s origin destiny realm was worthy of their respect!

“Hahaha, there’s no need to stand on ceremony, there’s no need to stand on ceremony! ”

Lin Niu laughed out loud. He waved his arm and made everyone stand up.

“Lin Niu, since you have made a breakthrough in the sword and magic universe, all disciples of the sword and Magic Universe can come and listen to the sermon today for 100,000 years.”

Wang Xian instructed Lin Niu with a smile.

“No problem, boss.”

Lin Niu immediately smiled and nodded his head.

“Then, we represent the disciples of the sword and Magic Universe to thank brother Lin Niu and brother Wang Xian! ”

Hopeless Heaven immediately cupped his hands and thanked Wang Xian and Linniu.

It was a great fortune for the strong disciples of the sword and Magic Universe to preach the Dao.

It was extremely difficult to break through to the Heaven’s destiny.

Hopeless Heaven was the Heaven’s destiny, but his understanding of cultivation was completely different from Liu Lan’s understanding of cultivation.

In particular, there was only one path to Heavenly Yuan creation, and it could not be replicated.

If the water element had heavenly yuan creation, then the other elements would not have it.

Every Heavenly Yuan creation had a different understanding of breakthrough and cultivation.

The power of creation they grasped was different.

Lin Niu’s sermon was useful to Liu Lan and hopeless sky to a certain extent.

After all, they were all experts of the same realm.

They still needed to verify each other in their cultivation.

“You’re welcome. Lin Niu can be considered a living being in the sword and Magic Universe! ”

Wang Xian shook his head.

He was lucky to be able to subdue Lin Niu!

“A thousand years later, I, Lin Niu, will be giving a sermon for 100,000 years to repay the Sword and Magic Universe. Any living being can come and listen to my sermon. ”

Lin Niu said loudly. “Thank you, Lord Lin Niu! ”

“Thank you, Lord Lin Niu!”

In the surrounding area, all the powerful disciples were filled with excitement as they hurriedly replied loudly.

The heavenly fate preaching the Dao for a hundred thousand years was a good opportunity.

Liu Lan and the Hopeless Heaven, the two heavenly fate, had only preached the dao four times in the past twenty billion years. Every time, it was a feast for all living beings.

It was an opportunity.

Many powerhouses had a breakthrough because of this.

A brand new attribute of the Heaven’s origin was lecturing them. This was an opportunity for many powerful disciples.

Wang Xian smiled at the side.

“Hehe, Dragon King, senior Wang Xian, come and sit with me. Let’s drink some fine wine. I have brewed quite a lot recently. ”

Liu Lan invited with a smile.

Wang Xian and the rest nodded with a smile.

In the following period of time, the news of Lin Niu’s breakthrough spread throughout the entire sword and magic universe.

The news of the sermon also spread throughout the universe.

Countless powerful disciples rushed over.

Due to the orders given by the undeserved forbidden ground and flowing water forbidden ground, the two great fortunes of the Heaven Origin emphasized once again.

Now, no faction dared to make a sound about the massacre.

Hence, this also resulted in a grand event in the sword and Magic Universe.

It was a prosperous one.

Countless creatures came to Lin Niii’s sermon.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Wang Xian was also watching from the side.

He was prepared to return to the nine-origin universe after Lin Niu’s sermon. He would bring Lin Niu along with him to the starry universe.

Regardless of whether it was searching for resources or other things, it was time for Wang Xian to return and take a look.

When the time came, he would let the body of the Void Dragon continue to cultivate here..
