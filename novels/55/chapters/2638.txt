“It’s all thanks to the Dragon Palace this time. Otherwise, we might not have survived!”

“Yeah, thanks to the Dragon Palace’s help, the Dragon King and the powerhouses of the Dragon Palace are so powerful!”

“The Dragon King will be a major shareholder of the Dragon Python group in the future. I didn’t expect that!”

“The Dragon Palace is our benefactor. In addition, the Dragon Palace is so powerful. It’s only right for them to become a major shareholder!”

As they watched the Dragon Palace’s Dragon Peak leave, some of the dragon Python group’s disciples looked at the Disappearing Dragon Peak in awe and began to discuss!

This battle was all thanks to the Dragon Palace!

“All Disciples, retreat from the Abyss!”

When the Dragon Peak passed by last month’s great sect, a voice came from within!

Wang Xian’s gaze swept across the area. Last month, the Great Sect’s three immortal King Level 8 and above experts had repelled two level 8 and above Abyss seeds!

In the abyss, they had also killed a large number of abyss seeds!

As the strongest faction in the northern front, the moment they encountered pressure, it would be the most dangerous moment!

Fortunately, the great sect had won the war easily this time!

The Dragon Peak flew quickly and arrived at the planet where the Dragon Palace was built half an hour later!

“Let’s go back to the main Dragon Palace!”

Wang Xian said to Tian Cheng and the rest with a smile on his face!

“It’s the Dragon King!”

The group of members immediately entered the Dragon Palace and were teleported to the main Dragon Palace!

Prime Minister Gui also sent people to guard the Dragon Peak!

“For this upgrade, let’s raise the combat strength of Tian Cheng to level 9 immortal King!”

“Use the rest of the level 8 and Level 7 abyssal seed corpses to increase the combat strength of some level 8 members!”

After returning to the Dragon Palace, Wang Xian immediately instructed the sky array and the rest!

16 immortal King Level 8 abyssal seed corpses, together with a bunch of level 7 abyssal seed corpses, could create two level 9 combat strength members!

However, Wang Xian was not prepared to do so. 10 level 8 corpses would create one level 9 combat strength while 10 corpses would create 10 level 8 combat strength members!

Ten level 8 combat strength members were sufficient to fight against a level 9 godly monarch!

Therefore, Wang Xian was only prepared to upgrade the heaven array to level 9 immortal godly monarch combat strength. With the upgrade of the Heaven Array, after he set up the array, it was sufficient to fight against two to three existences of the same level!

As for Wang Xian himself, he was not prepared to upgrade it at the moment. He could not upgrade it directly through the abyssal seed corpses either!

“It’s the Dragon King!”

The eyes of the heaven array revealed an excited expression. The Level 9 immortal King’s combat strength was one step closer to his peak! Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“This time, the Dragon Palace will be able to increase the combat strength of 10 Immortal King Level 8 Immortal Kings!”

Wang Xian looked at the resources in his hands and muttered to himself!

As for the improvement of the other members, it was even more terrifying!

In the next few days, the members of the Dragon Palace entered the dragon transformation pool and rapidly increased their strength!

And over at the Demon Island, after this battle, it caused quite a stir!

Amongst which, the Dragon Palace became famous!

The Warriors of the Dragon Palace first helped the Bei Chuan Sect Destroy 8 undying level 8 abyss seeds!

Then they supported the Dragon Python Group and killed 8 Undying Level 8 abyss seeds!

Along with the terrifying archers of the Dragon Palace, over 10 million abyss seeds died in the hands of the Dragon Palace!

The Dragon Python group even gave 10% of their shares to the Dragon Palace!

News after news stunned everyone!

“The strength of the Dragon Palace is much stronger than the ancient God dynasty of the Beichuan Sect’s dragon Python Group!”

“You don’t know, the experts of the Dragon Palace are simply too fierce. The Dragon King still has a subordinate hidden in the void, and his attacks will definitely heavily injure the rank 8 abyssal seed!”

“The Dragon Peak is even more terrifying. Three thorny monsters easily suppressed the level eight abyssal seed. There are also archers. There are thousands of arrows in a second. It’s simply a reaper for the abyssal seed!”

“This time, the Dragon Python group directly gave the Dragon King 10% of the shares and ordered their disciples to meet the Dragon King as if they were meeting them. The Dragon Python group owes the Dragon King a huge favor. In the future, they will probably be on the same side as the Dragon King!”

“It’s not just the Dragon Python group, the Frost Goddess of the Bei Chuan sect is the disciple of the Dragon King, and the Dragon King has helped the Bei Chuan sect twice. The bei Chuan sect owes a huge favor too, if anything happens to the Dragon Palace, the Bei Chuan sect will help too!”

On the AI, countless people were discussing!

Towards a warrior from a small galaxy that suddenly appeared, everyone was filled with shock!

Especially after killing 16 undying level 8 abyss species in one battle, this achievement was something only a large sect could achieve!

Along with the Master of the Frost Goddess, and now that the Beichuan Sect Dragon Python group owed him a huge favor, it could be said that this battle had allowed the Dragon Palace to rise up on the Demon Island and become famous everywhere!

Its power was also feared by many powerful warriors, just the power displayed by the Dragon Palace alone could only be suppressed by a large sect!

In the entire demon island, there were only four great sects!

The strength of the Dragon Palace could be considered as one of the best in the Demon Island!

In addition to the relationship between the Dragon Python Group and the Beichuan sect, other than the great sects, no other factions on the Demon Island could compete with the Dragon Palace!

However, even the great sects would show some respect to such a level of faction!

...

“Little Xian, the star lady will be leaving Tomorrow!”

Wang Xian did not know about the demon island. In the Dragon Palace, Tang Yinxuan came to his side and said!

“Oh? Why is that girl leaving?”

Wang Xian was slightly surprised!

The star Lady had stayed in the Dragon Palace for a few years. According to what she said, she would be returning to the imperial court in two years to participate in the assessment of the younger generation!

As long as she passed the assessment, she would be able to enter a void God realm in the imperial court and enter the Imperial Court’s Secret Realm!

At the same time, her status in the imperial court would also be greatly enhanced!

She was returning now?

“Oh? Star-lady said that the imperial court seemed to have encountered the threat of the Abyss, so the assessment of the young disciples this time was brought forward!”

As Tang Yinxuan spoke, she hesitated for a moment before continuing, “Little Xian, are you going with her this time?”

Tang Yinxuan and the others also knew a little about Celestial Maiden’s situation!

...

The imperial court had two types of assessment for its disciples. One was strength, and the other was influence!

Strength was one’s own strength, and influence was the power that could be mobilized by the forces under one’s control!

These two points were the criteria for evaluating the disciples of the imperial court!

The stronger one was, the more benefits one would get!

Apparently, the Imperial Star Lady didn’t have any power, but her strength was very strong!

With the strength of a peak master God, she was absolutely invincible in the current generation of the imperial court. In addition, she was now an immortal king level five battle pet, the Space Beast towering snake!

Her strength was definitely superior to the entire generation!

If it was a faction, there would be none!

If Wang Xian were to go, he would be able to represent her faction!

“If I go now...”

Wang Xian frowned slightly!

If it were any other time, Wang Xian would naturally go with her. However, the war at the Demon Island had yielded huge rewards every time!

This was a great opportunity for the Dragon Palace!

However, at this moment, the position of the Dragon King’s Hall suddenly trembled, interrupting his thoughts and causing him to be slightly stunned!
