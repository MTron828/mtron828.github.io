Chapter 1341: 1341 destruction of the country 2

In the huge banquet hall, a young man and a woman stood in the center in formal attire.

The Young Man’s face was full of pride, and he exuded a strong sense of confidence. His face was full of smiles.

He was handsome and unrestrained, a favored son of heaven.

He was the Crown Prince of the Sky Island dynasty, the future heir to the throne of the Sky Island dynasty.

The woman beside him had exquisite looks, and her formal attire made her look very beautiful.

She was the princess of the one leaf dynasty, the daughter of the king of the one leaf dynasty.

The woman stood there with a hint of pride and pride on her face. She slightly raised her head, proudly revealing her pure white neck.

On the center stage, the King of the Sky Island dynasty sat on the throne with a smile on his face. There was another seat beside him, and an old man sat on it.

The Old Man was a peerless expert of the one leaf continent dynasty, with a fourth level profound void tier cultivation base.

In order to promote the relationship between the two countries, they were engaged in a huge marriage alliance.

The one leaf continent dynasty’s king’s favorite princess marrying the Crown Prince of the Sky Island dynasty was a very important matter for both dynasties.

All the major forces of the Sky Island dynasty had arrived in the surroundings.

In order to show the power of the dynasty, the Sky Island dynasty had invited all the experts of the Harpoon Demon Beast clan, the Electric Eel Demon Beast clan, and the Dragon Palace.

The Dragon Palace and the two demon beast clans had to come because of the deep sea spiritual spring.

“Hehe, Sky Island King, Your Dynasty has developed so fast in the past two years. TSK, TSK, the three forces below all look extraordinary!”

On the stage in front, the old man from the one leaf continent dynasty glanced at the Dragon Palace and the two demonic beast races with a trace of surprise on his face.

“Haha, Fortunately, Fortunately, the three forces are not our subordinate forces. They just have some contact with each other!”

The Sky Island King laughed heartily.

Half a year ago, he suddenly found a deep-sea spiritual spring.

According to his estimations, he could at least take out tens of trillion middle-grade spirit stones. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

This was tens of trillion, and it could allow their sky island dynasty’s strength to receive a huge increase.

This was because the sky island dynasty had spent a lot of money in the past half a year, causing the one leaf continent dynasty to enter into a marriage alliance with them.

He could already see that the sky island dynasty would become stronger and stronger in the future!

“Is that so?”

The elder beside him revealed a smile as he looked at the scene.

“The sky flower clan sends their congratulatory gifts to congratulate Crown Prince Jiang and princess one leaf on their marriage in the future. Congratulations!”

Congratulatory voices sounded from below.

The marriage between two dynasties. Even though today was only the engagement day, the customs were extremely complicated.

Token exchange, gift giving, toast to guests, and so on.

The engagement process was already halfway through.

It was the basic etiquette for the crown prince and Princess one leaf to receive gifts and toast to guests.

As two large countries, all the customs were very grand.

Beside the Crown Prince and Princess, there were the crown prince’s siblings and the Princess’siblings.

The crown prince and the princess walked over, and a few young men came to their side and toasted with them.

“The people of the Sky Island dynasty are really insatiable. Not only do they want to call us over, but they also want us to give them enough gifts to support them. Humph!”

In the seat of the Dragon Palace, a group of members of the Dragon Palace were sitting in an area. Guan Shuqing looked forward, pursed her lips, and said somewhat angrily.

“We are not as strong as them. Xiaoxian has been away for a year, but he doesn’t know how to come back. Humph!”

A Jiaya echoed angrily.

“With our development speed, they will have to think twice before threatening us again!”

Sun Lingxiu said indifferently.

As members of the Dragon Palace, each of them had the ability to fight above their level.

The strongest person in the dragon palace was Mou Zesen. He had the strength of a level two void interpretation expert, but he was able to fight against a level three void interpretation expert.

Sun Lingxiu had reached level one void interpretation, so he could also fight against a level two void interpretation expert. He was even stronger because of his physique.

“When brother comes, we’ll teach them a good lesson!”

Xiao Yu also followed them and echoed.

On the entire round table, besides Guan Shuqing and Xiao Yu, only Prime Minister Gui was serving them.

“Huh?”

At this moment, Prime Minister Gui, who was listening to the Dragon Queen’s conversation with a smile on his face, moved slightly, and his eyes sparkled.

“Dragon Queen, Grand Princess, the Dragon King Is Here!”

A hint of excitement flashed in his eyes, and he quickly looked at the sky.

“Eh?”

The few girls were slightly taken aback. Soon after, they looked towards the sky excitedly.

Buzz

In the distance, Wang Xian, Zhang Fengying, and Ba Qi appeared in a flash in the sky and arrived at the location of the people from the Dragon Palace.

With his speed and concealment, the king of the Sky Island Empire and the old man from the one leaf mainland empire on the stage did not sense anyone suddenly flashing over.

“Dragon King!”

Prime Minister Gui stood up immediately. The surrounding members of the Dragon Palace also wanted to kneel down.

Wang Xian waved his hand and gestured for them to sit down.

“Brother!”

“Xiao Xian!”

A few girls looked excited. Xiao Yu stood up happily.

This was the longest time that Wang Xian had left them. They had not seen each other for an entire year. The girls missed him dearly.

“Huh?”

“Humph!”

“No wonder he didn’t come back for a year!”

However, their faces turned dark when they saw Zhang Fengying beside Wang Xian.

The happy expression on their faces disappeared instantly. With a snort, they sat there without moving.

“Hehe, this must be Miss Fengying. Have a seat!”

Sun Lingxiu was the kind of girl who was indifferent towards the saint mother. She looked at Zhang Fengying with a smile and invited her.

“Miss Fengying, come, come, sit beside me!”

Guan Shuqing squeezed out a smile and gestured to the seat beside her.

The few girls knew about Zhang Fengying.

Because of Wang Xian, her entire family was wiped out. They also knew about this matter.

They knew that Wang Xian had always felt extremely guilty towards her.

They had no ill intentions towards Zhang Fengying.

However, this did not mean that they would allow Wang Xian to continue floating like this.

Zhang Fengying nodded her head faintly and sat beside Guan Shuqing.

“Dragon King, please take a seat!”

Prime Minister Gui stood up respectfully and said hurriedly.

“There’s no need. Just let him stand by the side!”

Guan Shuqing glanced at Wang Xian and said faintly.

“There’s no room for him to sit. Prime Minister Gui, you can just sit down!”

A Jiaya, Tang Yinxuan, and the rest looked at Prime Minister Gui and said.

Prime Minister Gui revealed an embarrassed smile. He looked at Wang Xian and lowered his head without saying a word.

Although the Dragon King was revered, this was after all a family matter of the Dragon King. With the attitude of the Dragon Queens, he didn’t dare to say a word!
