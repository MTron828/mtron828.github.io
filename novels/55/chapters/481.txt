Chapter 482: Surfing

“The name of a foreigner is really long!”

Wang Xian chuckled upon seeing the name before leaving the white book at one side.

The entire book had a detailed introduction to the females of Dubai, the rules of Dubai and some rules that applied to the royalty.

Wang Xian didn’t know who Hertha Mohakaben Cesid Al Adjaya was or the purpose of her sending him the white book.

“Could it be this is a trick from Mu Xiaowan, the little brat?”

Wang Xian raised an eyebrow and found this to be highly likely.

At this moment, within the Fire God Palace on Fire Spirit Island.

In just a night, the entire Fire God Palace had undergone huge changes. All areas that were damaged had returned to their original state after the lava flowed past them.

A girl was sitting on the throne in the main hall.

Her dressing today was completely different from the previous day. In her exquisite fiery-red dress, she personified nobility and a fire goddess.

Her nobility and beauty made one want to look up to her.

The first queen in history was just so.

Below her, an old man in a white robe stood before the middle of the main hall. He looked at the girl on the elevated platform with surprise and solemness.

“Adjaya, since you have made the decision, I won’t be adding much. However, I hope you will remain and station yourself in Dubai.”

The old man in the middle looked at his daughter on the throne as he remarked.

“Rest assured, father. The Fire God Palace is still here and I won’t be leaving. It wouldn’t be convenient for the fire demons to leave this place either!”

Adjaya looked at her clanmates before her before looking up.

“Now, this is the only option. Moreover, that guy is pretty strong and quite a nice guy!”

Adjaya looked at the clothes she was wearing. She had broken free from the constraints of her family completely.

Perhaps this type of clothes is more in line with the general senses for aesthetics, she thought to herself. At the thought of the incident the previous night, her eyebrows knitted together and her face was flushed.

“Haiz! You are really slow. I’ve been waiting for half an hour!”

When Wang Xian walked down from the hotel, he immediately spotted Mu Xiaowan pouting and grumbling unhappily.

“Today’s weather is a little cold. Let’s find a place for a sunbath!”

Feeling the cool wind blowing, he teased her.

“How can you do this to me? I’ve been waiting for you for half an hour and even got my surfboard ready!”

When Mu Xiaowan heard Wang Xian, she instantly felt wronged. She pointed to the surfboard beside her and was on the verge of tears.

“Alright, alright. Let’s go surfing! Let’s go surfing!”

Wang Xian immediately changed his words and stopped teasing her.

“That’s better! I’ll show you how great I am at surfing in a while!” Mu Xiaowan chuckled happily. Pointing to the surfboard, she said, “Take that along. I’m too tired and you are a gentleman!”

Wang Xian smiled speechlessly. He turned to Tang Lingling and asked, “Aren’t you going to join?”

“Perhaps not. I’m waiting for someone!” Tang Lingling shook her head.

Wang Xian nodded his head, carried the surfboard and walked to the beach with Mu Xiaowan.

“Let’s go!”

The little brat carried her surfboard and went straight into the water.

“Mr. Wang, please help to take care of Xiao Wan,” Tang Lingling reminded Wang Xian.

After giving her a reassuring hand sign, Wang Xian picked up the surfboard and walked towards the water.

Surfing was a popular sport overseas. There were lots of people surfing around them.

There were people from both genders. Some moved up and down along the waves and looked extremely cool.

Wang Xian had not surfed before. However, this didn’t mean he wouldn’t know how to.

The truth was that all he had to do was to place the surfboard on the water and he could move out like a rocket.

Simple water manipulation would enable him to do so.

Mu Xiaowan, the little brat, lay on the surfboard and tried to paddle with her hands. One could easily tell she knew nothing about surfing and was simply playful.

Wang Xian stepped onto the surfboard and moved with ease. What was a little frightening was that he was moving against the direction of the waves.

Wang Xian controlled the surfboard and made a turn around that little brat.

“Haiz. Is this your level of skills? You can’t make it!” Wang Xian smiled and said sarcastically.

“Wow! You are really good!”

Seeing how cool Wang Xian was when moving, Mu Xiaowan was a little dumbfounded.

“I guess I’m still fine!” Wang Xian chuckled joyously. As the incident of the Fire God Palace had ended, he could have a day or two of good rest before returning.

“Quick! Teach me! I want to look as cool as you!” Mu Xiaowan exclaimed at Wang Xian.

“Come, let father teach you. Hold my arm!”

Wang Xian smiled and moved through the waves while holding her.

This made Mu Xiaowan extremely excited, and she even forgot about Wang Xian teasing her.

“Eh, Tang Lingling is here too!”

Just as Wang Xian and the little brat were playing, they saw Tang Lingling entering into the water with a few young men.

“Those are some of our friends in the country. Their families have businesses in Dubai. Look! One of them is even a big star!” Mu Xiaowan pointed and smiled. “One of them is Sister Lingling’s boyfriend. As for the rest, they are all perverts. I still have a month till I reach the legal age and yet one of them tried to woo me! He should be given the death penalty!” the little girl grumbled.

Wang Xian chuckled. “Now that you guys are living in Dubai, are your family businesses doing well?”

“That gigantic mall right there was built from the investment from my family, Sister Lingling’s family and the families of those young men. We have invested over tens of billions into it. I’ll bring you there tomorrow. If you come to Dubai in the future, follow me and you will definitely get to eat the best food!”

The girl patted her flat chest and spoke proudly.

This little girl was pretty cute but her figure was bad. She was more loli than a typical loli.

“Brother, I saw that you are great at surfing a while ago. Come. Should we go to deeper waters?”

Four youths approached Wang Xian on their surfboards and one of them spoke with a smile to Wang Xian.

“That’s the pervert!”

Wang Xian could hear the little girl speaking softly, and nodded his head with a smile.

“Come, brothers!”

A young man raised an eyebrow at him and the other young man in front of Tang Lingling was clearly her boyfriend.

There was another guy who was rather known and looked extremely gorgeous.

In other words, he was a star from Korea who didn’t have the capabilities to remain there.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian didn’t reject him.

“Xiao Wan, why don’t you get on my surfboard. You must have heard about my skills. It would still be absolutely safe with the two of us!” the young man with short hair said to Mu Xiaowan.

“It’s alright. I’ll just go with this uncle. Uncle is pretty good too!”

Mu Xiaowan looked at him and raised an eyebrow. “What do you think?”

“Just get up, my dear daughter!”

“Scumbag! Are you eager to die?”

When Mu Xiaowan heard Wang Xian, she kicked him furiously right away.

Wang Xian immediately grabbed her by her arms and put her into the water till the water was at her waist.

“If you are going to continue kicking, I’m going to release my hand!”

“Scumbag!”

“Again?”

Wang Xian loosened his grip.

“Wahh... I’ll stop. I’ll stop. It’s my fault!”

“That’s better. Come, let me bring you surfing!”

Wang Xian laughed loudly and pulled the eighty-catty girl up.

Beside them, the face of the young man with short hair instantly darkened upon seeing them.

The young man beside Tang Lingling whispered softly into her ear and she replied to him softly. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Huh? Calling him daddy. How uncouth!” the young man snorted.

Tang Lingling rolled her eyes and remarked, “He saved our lives and is the benefactor of Xiao Wan and I. Don’t be rude!”
