Silence!

In the hall of the main peak of the Ming Wang Immortal sect, all the experts of the immortal sect were completely stunned. Their eyes were wide open and filled with disbelief.

They couldn’t afford to offend him?

Their sect leader actually said that the other party was an existence that they couldn’t afford to offend.

This caused everyone’s faces to reveal shock.

“Pass down the Order!”

The two immortal gods of the Ming Wang Immortal sect didn’t want to stay here any longer.

After all, this was a very shameful matter.

The two figures moved and directly disappeared, leaving behind a group of immortal sect experts who were dumbstruck.

“Sect leader actually said that the Dragon Gate is an existence that our immortal sect can not afford to offend!”

An old man’s eyes flickered as he muttered.

Lord sect master said that it was not an existence that they could provoke, which also meant that it was not an existence that their Ming Wang Immortal sect and puppet immortal sect could provoke.

They knew that their two immortal sects currently had a total of six immortal gods!

Six immortal gods did not dare to provoke the other party?

Then what exactly was the other party’s existence?

“Just how powerful is this Dragon King of the Dragon Gate? In particular, the sect master actually said that we can go there to forge spirit weapons. Just how terrifying is the other party that made our Lord Immortal God lower his head!”

An elder said with an ugly expression.

It was understandable that the other party was very powerful if they did not provoke him. However, the immortal God said that they could go to the other party’s place to refine pills and weapons. The indirect propaganda was that their immortal god was completely suppressed by the other party.

Otherwise, how could they publicize an enemy’s weapon refining and pill refining shop?

“Send the order. Since the sect leader has said it, then the other party is definitely not someone we can offend. Don’t let our immortal sect suffer a powerful enemy!”

The bald old man sighed slowly. “If you want to blame someone, blame Lao Bai and the others for their bad luck. They provoked the immortal God and were directly killed. It’s their fate now!”

“Okay!”

The group of immortal sect powerhouses nodded slightly and scattered in all directions.

An opponent that even the sect leader didn’t dare to provoke could possibly destroy their immortal sect.

This Dragon King of the Dragon Gate, this former jianghu force, simply shocked them.

It was the same on the puppet immortal sect’s side.

For a moment, all the experts of the two immortal sects fell silent.

Then, on the same night, a piece of news that shocked all the disciples of the Shun Ding world came.

“All Disciples of the Puppet Immortal Sect of the Ming Wang Immortal sect are forbidden to provoke the members of the Dragon Gate and the Dragon King of the Jiang City in the future. Those who violate the sect rules will be punished!”

“In addition, the Dragon King of the Dragon Gate has opened a forging shop on the ancient street. It’s more suitable. You can go there to refine spirit tools and elixirs!”

When this order was given, the entire Shun Ding world was shocked.

Everyone’s faces were filled with disbelief.

Everyone’s eyes were dull!

Tonight, all the disciples of the immortal sect had angrily vowed to destroy the Dragon Gate and the Dragon King. In the end, the Lord Immortal God gave the order directly at night!

What did this mean? They couldn’t afford to provoke the Dragon Gate or the Dragon King.

They even gave the order that if anyone dared to provoke the Dragon Gate and the Dragon King, the sect rules would be punished and the law enforcement team would punish them!

They even publicized the other party’s forging shop!

This..

Even if the elite disciples of the immortal sect were killed and the elders of the half-step immortal God were killed, the immortal God still gave such an order.

Everyone’s furious mood was instantly splashed with a bucket of cold water.

Those disciples of the immortal sect who were about to say that they wanted to whip the corpse shut up.

Those disciples who swore to take revenge also shut up.

When the warriors of the aristocratic families in Jiang City received the news, their eyes widened and their faces were filled with shock.

Their backer, the immortal sect they had joined, had bowed to the Dragon King.

Although Jiang city was still the territory of their immortal sect in the future, the king here had changed.

It was still the same old king.

The Dragon King was still the Dragon King!

In just one night, Jiang city had changed!

The next morning, Wang Xian came to the school and began his leisurely life as a student.

In the school, the students greeted him respectfully as senior and student Wang Xian.

When the disciples of the immortal sect met Wang Xian, they even called him Dragon King in horror!

This made the rest of the students dumbfounded.

The high and Mighty Disciples of the immortal sect had never placed them in their eyes.

Now, when they met Wang Xian, they greeted him even more respectfully than they did.

“Boss, you are so awesome. The Immortal sect is bowing its head. You actually made our immortal sect bow its head!”

Wang Dahai stared at Wang Xian in shock and shouted loudly.

“The Ming Wang Immortal sect knows about our relationship. They didn’t make things difficult for you, right? If they make things difficult for you, tell me!”

Wang Xian smiled and said to Wang Dahai.

“No, no. Now, because our relationship is better, the immortal sect asked me to maintain a good relationship with you. They even gave me a lot of rewards. hehehe!”

Wang Dahai said happily.

“That’s good.”

Wang Xian smiled and started to chat with Wang Dahai.

Meanwhile, the group of DRAKONIDS entered the jianghu and started to gather information.

The appearance of the immortal sect made the information of the Zhi Tian group almost useless. It was very, very difficult for the Zhi Tian Group to enter the immortal sect.

Therefore, the group of Drakonids had to go there personally.

The drakonids were already able to take charge of their own affairs. There was no need for them to do anything personally.

All they had to do was wait for the results!

They sat on the fishing platform and watched the storm with a smile!

“Dragon King, the first-grade pavilion has been transformed into a forging workshop. It has been completed!”

After school in the afternoon, Mo Qinglong came to Wang Xian’s side and said to him.

“So Fast? The transformation was completed in one day!”

Wang Xian asked in surprise.

“Dragon King, we asked the disciples of the puppet immortal sect to help us with the renovation. They are very fast in this aspect!”

Mo Qinglong said to Wang Xian.

“Oh, let’s go and take a look. If the renovation is done, we will start our business in two days!”

Wang Xian said with a smile.

Refining artifacts and pills was the fastest way to obtain resources. As long as his forging workshop was publicized, it would be even faster than robbing money in the future!

At this moment, in the region of the Yellow Cauldron world.

The Yellow Cauldron world had a total of three immortal sects: The Yellow Heaven Immortal Sect, the Hunyuan Immortal sect, and the upper nine immortal sects.

Of the three immortal sects, the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect and the Hunyuan Immortal sect had always been enemies.

As for the upper nine immortal sect, they belonged to a neutral force.

The three immortal sects were evenly matched.

The Yellow Heaven Immortal sect had one middle-level immortal, the Hunyuan Immortal sect had three lower-level immortals, and the upper nine immortal sect also had three lower-level immortals.

Overall, the difference in strength between the three immortal sects was not too great. It was basically impossible to devour or destroy the other party.

“I’ve made a breakthrough! Haha, I’ve finally made a breakthrough!”

In one of the mountain peaks of the Chaos Origin Immortal sect, the Golden Mountain Peak looked abnormally dazzling.

An old man with disheveled hair roared with excitement on his face.

Streams of golden liquid flowed around the old man’s body, and the terrifying energy was completely restrained.

“Congratulations on the Grand Elder’s breakthrough!”

Beside him, a middle-aged old man looked at the old man with excitement.
