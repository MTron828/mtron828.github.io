“I don’t care who you are. If you don’t apologize, I’ll teach you a lesson today!”

Xiao Yu waved his arm, and a black bone whip appeared in his hand. He stood in the middle of the road with a cold gaze, sweeping his gaze over the people around him.

This scene stunned everyone around him.

Yellow Heaven City was very close to the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect. It was only four to five thousand meters away. Basically, apart from the stewards of the immortal sect and the disciples who worked hard in cultivation, most of the disciples of the immortal sect lived in Yellow Heaven City.

It was the busiest time of the night, and there were a lot of people around.

The disciples of the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect looked at Xiao Yu, who was standing in the middle of the road, in astonishment.

“Where did this wild girl come from? Judging from her clothes, she should be from the real world. This wild girl actually dares to provoke Kong Leshan, Tang zhiming, and the others!”

“Hey, the crown prince is here too, the one who has his head lowered and is holding a game console!”

“The Crown Prince is here too? Seriously, this wild girl is too bold. She came to our Yellow Heaven Immortal sect to cause trouble. Isn’t she just looking for trouble?”

“It seems that this girl wants to avenge one of her juniors. She even wants to challenge Kong Leshan and the others. How ignorant!”

“These young men are the most elite disciples of our Yellow Heaven Immortal sect. It seems that other than the people ranked second and fourth, more than half of the top ten disciples of the immortal sect are here. Most importantly, the crown prince is also here!”

The surrounding disciples and family members of the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect looked at them and pointed at them as they spoke.

If it weren’t for the fact that Xiao Yu was a pretty little girl, they might have already said some nasty words!

“Little girl, I think you need to be taught a lesson!”

The young man with the Golden Sword in his hand saw Xiao Yu take out the bone whip, and his face turned cold as he said with a sullen face.

“Fight, fight, fight! The Boss is dying!”

At this moment, the youth who was playing the game console pressed the button excitedly and said in a low voice.

However, the few of them were already used to hearing this.

“HMPH, I see that you guys need to be taught a lesson. And you, this fellow!”

Xiao Yu snorted coldly. The bone whip in his hand moved and directly attacked the Golden Sword Youth.

“You’re courting death, you little girl who needs to be taught a lesson!”

The Golden Sword Young Man’s face went cold, and the Golden Longsword in his hand instantly unsheathed, directly slashing towards the bone whip.

There were even numerous sharp wind blades surrounding the longsword.

“You, Scram!”

Xiao Yu’s eyes revealed a trace of disdain, and the bone whip shook, causing the young man who hadn’t even reached the infant stage to have a huge change in expression.

The bone whip lashed onto the longsword, causing his arm to instantly go numb as it directly coiled around his arm.

Xiao Yu lightly pulled!

“Ah!”

The Golden Sword Young Man let out a miserable cry as his body directly crashed onto the ground.

“En?”

“En?”

The young man and the girl who were prepared to watch the show at the side were stunned, and their expressions changed.

“Stop!”

The gazes of the two young men were grave as the longswords in their hands slashed out one by one towards Xiao Yu.

“I’m Scared!”

The Bone Whip Shook, and the Demonic Qi on it instantly shattered the wind sword. The bone whip was like a venomous snake, slashing out numerous phantoms.

In an instant, the bone whip coiled around their legs.

Feather lightly pulled.

“Bang Bang!”

The two fell heavily to the ground.

With Feather’s current half-step immortal God strength, these so-called heaven chosen disciples of the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect were completely crushed.

They couldn’t even see the shadow of Xiao Yu’s attack.

“You people still want to teach me a lesson!”

Xiao Yu’s face revealed a look of disdain. With a wave of the bone whip in his hand, he instantly attacked the young man who was playing the game console.

“Pa!”

The young man who was holding the game console with both hands was instantly stunned.

“Ah, I’m about to clear the level. The boss is about to die. Damn it!”

The young man exploded in anger as he stood beside Xiao Yu.

The girl beside him was also stunned as she opened the fan in her hand, “How dare you disturb Lingtian’s game!”

The green energy emitted from the fan as the girl stared at Xiao Yu coldly.

“Not only am I disturbing his game, I want to give him a good beating!”

The bone whip in Xiao Yu’s hand did not stop, and once again swung towards Ling Tian.

“You dare to disturb me? You’re looking for a beating!”

Ling Tian raised his head with a fierce expression, and the six spiritual weapons in his interspatial ring instantly appeared.

However, the moment he raised his head and saw Xiao Yu, he could not help but retreat backwards.

“It’s you, witch!”

He let out a sharp voice as though his anus had been blown open as he stared at Xiao Yu with bloodshot eyes.

“Little slave, we meet again!”

Xiao Yu looked at the terrified expression on Feng Lingtian’s face and the corners of his mouth curled up, full of mockery.

He swung the bone whip in his hand.

“F * * K!”

Feng Lingtian could not help but curse. The six spirit weapons spun rapidly and formed a three to four meter long wind shield.

“You actually dare to attack Lingtian!”

The expression of the girl beside him changed slightly. With a wave of the fan in her hand, a wind attribute fan shot towards Xiao Yu.

“Get out of my way!”

Xiao Yu waved his arm, and with a wave of the bone whip in his hand, the fan in the hands of the girl was sent flying.

“Little slave, I said that I would beat you up every time I see you!”

Xiao Yu’s voice rang out again, “It seems like you are some crown prince of the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect. How dare you let Your Yellow Heaven Immortal sect bully my martial nephew? You are really looking for a beating!” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“MOTHERF * cker!”

When Feng Lingtian saw Xiao Yu’s bone whip coming at him again, he could not help but raise his eyebrows and grit his teeth, his eyes widened, “Witch, you think I can’t Beat You? In this one year, I have specially cultivated a battle technique that can counter your whip. I will teach you a good lesson today!”

“Teach me a lesson, and today, I will make your buttocks blossom!”

Xiao Yu’s face revealed a mocking expression as she waved the bone whip in her hand once again.

“You shut your mouth for this young master!”

“WHOOSH WHOOSH WHOOSH!”

In an instant, the six longswords transformed into thousands of wind swords that shot towards Xiao Yu. Feng Lingtian gritted his teeth and instantly flew twenty meters into the sky.

“A small trick, just a piece of trash like you. You haven’t improved at all!”

Xiao Yu smiled. Compared to a year ago, ling Tian’s strength had increased by quite a bit. However, compared to her improvement, Ling Tian hadn’t improved at all.

A year ago, Xiao Yu’s suppression of Ling Tian wasn’t that strong. At that time, if Ling Tian wanted to escape, Xiao Yu wouldn’t be able to catch up to him.

But today, Ling Tian was completely crushed.

Ling Tian, who was filled with fighting spirit, thought that he could take revenge today.

“Roar!”

The bone whip in Xiao Yu’s hand shook, and a terrifying demonic qi instantly condensed into the ferocious head of a bone dragon.

“Peng Peng Peng!”

The tens of thousands of wind swords were instantly shattered.

Xiao Yu leaped, and the bone whip in his hand shot towards Feng Lingtian. The Bone Whip grew longer!

“F * * K!”

Feng Lingtian’s face turned black when he saw that his attack, which was almost comparable to a peak-level attack, was shattered!
