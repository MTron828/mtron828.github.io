Chapter 1526: 1,526 sounds traveled five thousand miles

“Eh? Why did they come down so quickly?”

“Yeah, how long has it been? Five minutes at most. There shouldn’t be any problems, right?”

At this moment, there were already over a thousand people lining up at the entrance of the Holy Medicine Clinic.

When they saw the first batch of ten people who entered just now come out, the people who were lining up had astonished expressions on their faces.

It had only been five minutes, how could they come out so quickly?

“No, look, look at those two people. When they came out, they had lost their arms, but now they have grown back!”

“It’s true. Judging from their excitement, they should have all been cured. Oh My God, ten people have been cured so quickly!” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Suddenly, a few middle-aged men looked at the ten people who came out and asked excitedly.

“Haha, Alright, Alright. We are completely healed. Reverend Wang is very powerful. Reverend Wang is a good person!”

The ten people who came out saw the crowd outside staring at them with eager faces.

They all said excitedly.

“Next, another ten people will come!”

At this moment, a female receptionist in front of them raised her head slightly and shouted with a smile on her face.

“Don’t be anxious. Come one by one. Our Reverend Wang is very powerful!”

The female receptionist said proudly to everyone.

“Yes, yes. Reverend Wang is very powerful. My arm has been broken for more than ten years. Even our Reverend Wang Can Cure it!”

An old man said excitedly. After saying that, he turned around and bowed towards the holy medicine clinic.

“Let’s go, it’s our turn!”

The ten people behind followed the girl excitedly and walked towards the fourth floor.

“Reverend Wang, the patient is here!”

The girl who received him brought her people to the fourth floor and greeted Wang Xian sweetly.

“Okay, let them come in directly!”

Wang Xian smiled at the girl.

Seeing Wang Xian smiling at her, the girl who was receiving him almost fainted. She nodded immediately.

Wang Xian swept his gaze across the ten patients and checked their conditions to prevent some from pretending to be poor.

Following that, rays of light energy landed on them.

At this moment, the head of the Hall walked over silently. He looked at Wang Xian who was treating the patients and looked at the patients who were recovering rapidly. His eyes revealed a hint of amazement.

The young man followed behind him. He looked on with a face full of shock. He watched as groups of people came over and were quickly healed.

“Amazing, amazing. It’s like the new wave is pushing the new wave forward. Compared to him, I’m far from him. I’m far from him. His use of light is simply unbelievable!”

The hall master stood there and watched for an hour. Then, he shook his head with a face full of shock and walked upstairs.

“Master, is He... is he really that powerful? I didn’t see him use a dharma idol that was too powerful!”

When the young man heard his master’s words, a shocked expression appeared on his face.

His master was a radiant priest at the third level of the insightful void tier!

“The strength of a radiant priest lies not only in their level, but also in their control of light. Just now, every time that young master Wang used the power of light, he was able to achieve a very precise control, which just happened to clear away the power of Darkness!”

“I can’t do that. Even the head of the Divine Light Medical Center might not be able to do it. Perhaps only the old ancestor of the Divine Light Empire can do it. I wonder what kind of identity this young master Wang has!”

As the head spoke, his eyes were filled with astonishment.

“This...”

The young man at the side widened his eyes.

His master’s evaluation of that young man was simply too high!

On the fourth floor, Wang Xian quickly treated one patient after another. In the entire morning, he treated three to four hundred people.

At noon, he didn’t stop and continued his treatment.

“Reverend Wang didn’t even rest at noon. He’s such a good person!”

“He treated at least four to five hundred people in the entire morning. This... This is simply too amazing!”

At noon, in front of the Holy Medicine Clinic, the people who came to queue for treatment were having a sentimental conversation.

They had encountered this kind of free treatment by the priest of light once or twice, but the number of people who received free treatment was at most one to two thousand people. More than a hundred people were cured in one day.

Unlike this priest Wang, who only cured four to five hundred people in one morning.

He didn’t even rest at noon.

In front of the entrance of the Holy Medicine Clinic, the number of people who came to line up after hearing the news didn’t decrease. Instead, it increased by several times.

There were seven to eight thousand people gathered in the surrounding area. If it wasn’t to prevent overcrowding, there would probably be more than ten thousand people.

“Eh? What’s the situation up ahead?”

At this moment, a row of luxurious carriages drove on the road.

Inside the carriage, a woman saw the crowd gathered outside through the screen window and asked curiously.

“Let me take a look!”

There were four or five women sitting inside the carriage. They opened the curtains and looked outside.

“It seems that the holy medicine clinic is treating some people who can’t afford it for free. There are so many people lining up. There are at least seven or eight thousand people!”

A woman looked outside and said with a smile.

“Are you imitating the daughter of light, Sister Wu Qingyan? hehehe!”

A woman smiled and said to the woman in white in the middle.

“What do you mean by imitating me? Qingyan, are you asking for a beating?”

Wu Qingyan glared at the woman and said.

“The others are far inferior to our sister Qingyan. Our Sister Qingyan is a famous daughter of light!”

A few girls beside them said with a smile.

“That’s right. It’s probably just a gimmick to promote their clinic!”

The girls chatted as the carriage drove past.

The treatment continued.

In the afternoon, Wang Xian did not stop. A Day passed very quickly.

In the whole day, Wang Xian had cured more than a thousand people.

“The last ten, the rest will be treated tomorrow!”

Wang Xian spoke to the girl who was receiving him. Soon, ten people were brought over.

“Huh?”

However, this time, when Wang Xian swept his gaze across the ten of them, he raised his eyebrows slightly.

This caused the ten people who just walked in to look at Wang Xian in awe.

They had queued up for an entire day. They also had an understanding of Reverend Wang’s healing process.

Priest Wang would not ask if there were any problems. Instead, he could easily solve them for them.

This made the patients who came over exclaim in admiration. They praised priest Wang for being very powerful.

When they saw Wang Xian sizing them up, they were a little nervous.

“You, if you have the ability to seek treatment from other priests of light, Scram immediately!”

Wang Xian pointed at a middle-aged man and said coldly.

The middle-aged man who was pointed at by Wang Xian was slightly stunned. His eyes revealed a look of panic.

“Sir... i... I really don’t have the money to treat your illness. Sir, I...”

“Throw him out!”

Wang Xian said directly to Lao Hu who was at the side.
