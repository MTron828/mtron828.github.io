Chapter 2978: Becoming a Dragon Knight in 1978? 4

“No, I’m from the Dragon and Phoenix God dynasty, with the Dragon Palace behind me!”

When the manager of nine destruction planet saw the emperor that was charging towards him, his pupils contracted and his forehead broke out in cold sweat.

He roared with a pale face.

“Peng!”

However, the Emperor’s eyes didn’t change, his palm landing on his body.

The manager of nine destruction planet was only an undying king level 9, against an Emperor’s attack, he didn’t even have the chance to escape.

His body exploded, instantly turning into dust.

“Hiss, what, the god Emperor of eight destruction killed the manager of our planet!”

On the planet below, everyone’s expression changed when they saw this scene, they couldn’t help but roar.

“Bhang, you actually dared to kill our dragon and Phoenix experts. Our empress will not let you off, and the Dragon Palace will not let you off either!”

On the planet below, when some of the other people on the nine destruction planet saw this scene, their expressions changed drastically, and they immediately roared loudly.

“Won’t let us off? This time, we came out to destroy the Dragon Palace and kill the Dragon King!”

The desolate divine emperor’s eyes revealed a cold expression. He held a scepter and looked down.

“Boom!”

The Scepter released a terrifying stream of water and attacked the palaces below.

With a loud sound, the area of thousands of kilometers below the scepter was instantly razed to the ground.

The stream of water flooded the surroundings.

This time, it was fortunate that many people had made preparations beforehand and were not killed.

However, a large number of people were still affected.

“HMPH, today, I, desolate, announce my return. It Won’t be long before we destroy the Dragon Palace and raise the head of the Dragon King!”

Desolate divine emperor announced loudly with a cold expression.

His voice spread throughout the entire void space.

On the planet below, everyone’s expression changed drastically when they heard this as they watched in shock.

They were very curious. With the current strength of the Dragon Palace, what right did bhang have to fight with them.

“Then the Dragon Palace is over here, right?”

Yang Feng and Yang Xiaohun swept their gaze over and said indifferently toward the ocean.

“Yes, Sirs. The base of the Dragon Palace is in the ocean!”

Hearing their words, the godly monarchs hurriedly responded respectfully.

Without any hesitation, they flew toward the ocean.

They followed closely behind.

“Who are those two? Why are the desolate godly monarch and the other godly monarchs so respectful?”

“They are flying toward the Dragon Palace.”

On the planet, everyone looked over curiously.

The return of the experts from the eight barrens killed the manager of the dragon-phoenix dynasty.

Furthermore, the desolate divine emperor directly said that he wanted to destroy the Dragon Palace and kill the Dragon King!

What did they have to rely on?

Who were the two people who made the eight barrens divine emperor address them as lords?

Everyone’s expressions changed, and they quickly transmitted their news to the AI.

Some of the divine king experts on the planets hesitated for a moment, and they kept an eye on the situation at the ocean.

Weng

The three eyed group’s Yang Feng and Yang Xiao Hun were extremely fast, the two of them floated in the air above the ocean, their eyebrows burning as they stared at the ocean below.

Rumble

At this time, a powerful pressure came from within the ocean, a blood red chain wrapped around his body, Thunder Hammer in one hand and devil flame spear in the other, a mad dragon appeared and stared at the two silhouettes above.

Behind him, there were dozens of undying emperor level 8 and 9 members.

When the Mad Dragon looked at the three eyed race members, his expression changed.

“This is the emperor of the Dragon Palace?”

“He doesn’t seem like a dragon with the bloodline?”

Yang Feng and Yang Xiao Hun stared at the mad dragon and frowned.

“Undefeatable!”

The berserk dragon seed sensed the strength of the two of them, especially the pressure coming from the vertical eye, causing his expression to change slightly.

He swept his gaze to the side and did not hesitate at all when he saw the eight desolate divine emperors flying over.

“Retreat!”

With a low roar, the berserk dragon seed immediately fled towards the Dragon Palace.

“You want to escape?”

“Wishful thinking!”

Yang Xiaohun’s eyes revealed a look of disdain. His eyes shot out beams of dazzling light as he attacked the members of the Dragon Palace.

The moment he attacked, a group of people flew toward them from the void in front of them.

They were from the four-armed race.

“There’s a base of the Dragon Palace on the planet in front of us. No, Lord Qian, I’ve selected a piece of information from the A.I. that the eight barrens divine emperor has also arrived on this planet!”

At the center, the creator’s eyes were flashing with all kinds of information as he spoke to the fifth deacon of the four-armed race.

Deacon Qian of the four-armed race looked forward and narrowed his eyes.

“What faction is eight desolation?”

A four-armed race celestial emperor asked from the side.

“This is the information about eight desolation. According to the information released by some people on the planet in front of the AI, eight Desolation Celestial Emperor has come with two people and wants to destroy the Dragon Palace!”

The creator waved his arm and displayed all the information about the eight barrens.

Deacon Qian swept his gaze over and felt the power coming from the planet in front of him. He had a bad premonition.

“Let’s go, we have to speed up!”

Without any hesitation, he took the lead and flew towards the planet in front of them.

The group immediately followed closely behind.

“Boom!”

“Hehehe, you still want to escape? You still want to escape from My Hands?”

At this moment, in the sky above the ocean, Yang Xiaohun extended his arm. In front of him, the rank one divine emperor mad dragon species and the other dragon species were all bound.

The two three-eyed race members stared at them with disdain and mockery on their faces.

The huge difference in strength caused the members of the Dragon Palace to be caught before they could escape back to the Dragon Palace.

“What are you trying to do? Are you trying to make an enemy out of our Dragon Palace?”

Seeing that they were caught, the mad dragon species’expression did not change at all. They stared at them and questioned.

“Oh? You have guts?”

Yang Xiaohun raised his brows slightly when he saw that the expressions of the group of dragon species did not change at all.

“First level divine emperor’s strength, and the scales on his body are somewhat similar to the dragon scales. A quasi-dragon?”

Yang Feng sized up the berserk dragon species, his eyes flashing with excitement.

“Brother Yang, it looks like these fellows have impure bloodlines!”

Yang Xiao Hun also sized them up and said with slight disappointment. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Oh?”

However, just as he finished speaking, Yang Feng’s expression changed slightly. He immediately looked to the side, his eyes filled with solemnity.

“This is?”

His expression changed drastically when he saw the experts from the four-armed tribe flying over. His expression was extremely ugly.

“What is it?”

Yang Xiaohun and the experts from the eight desolation tribe sensed it and immediately looked over.

The faces of those who saw the four-armed tribe were filled with incomparable surprise.

“The four-armed tribe, why… why have they appeared here!”

Yang Xiao Hun face unusual embarrassed low voice roar way.
