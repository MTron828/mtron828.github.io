Translator: 549690339

“A piece of trash like you dares to harass my mother? You’re courting death! ”

In the arena, TIANCPs cold gaze locked onto Liao Feiyu, his face filled with disdain.

The discussions and exclamations around the arena didn’t reach his ears.

His gaze was only on Liao Feiyu.

As soon as he finished speaking, his attack continued!

His body moved and he split into dozens of clones. Each of them held a sharp sword in their hands.

Dozens of clones quickly surrounded Liao Feiyu!

“Earth, heavy blow, tremor, gravity suppression! ”

Liao Feiyu stared at Wang Xian with a cold and gloomy expression.

He let out a low growl and smashed the gigantic shield in his hand onto the ground.

The ground began to collapse and tremble violently. Like waves, waves spread out in all directions.

At the same time, the entire space seemed to have frozen.

A powerful gravity filled the entire arena!

An area-of-effect attack.

Tianci stood on the arena and immediately felt the gravity below increase to a terrifying degree!

His speed was directly reduced by half!

Tianci’s expression did not change. With a move of his palm, streams of seawater appeared out of thin air and covered the ground!

The seawater became higher and higher, drowning Tianci’s figure!

“Whoosh! ”

In the seawater, he was like a swimming fish as he continued to attack Liao Feiyu!

Liao Feiyu stared at him and let out a low roar. The long spear in his hand grew bigger again and he threw it directly at tianci.

Tianci was in the water and his figure flashed.

In the surrounding area, water clones held sharp swords and formed a sword formation!

Rays of light connected the swords together!

“He merged the formation into the sword technique. What a powerful sword formation. If the Sword Formation is formed, Liao Feiyu is definitely not Mu Litianci’s match! ”

Beside the arena, Gong Cheng glanced around. A few elders and middle-aged men appeared and looked at the arena in astonishment!

“Great-grandfather!”

“Grandfather, Father! ”

Gong Cheng Glanced’s younger brother saw a group of figures suddenly appear and hurriedly shouted!

“This Mu Litianci either obtained a heaven-defying opportunity or has an expert teaching him from behind. Otherwise, it’s impossible for him to have such a realm and possess such powerful combat techniques and experience! ”

Gong Cheng glanced at their great-grandfather and nodded. He continued to speak and his gaze fell on her, “Mu Litianci, do you understand him?”

“Great-grandfather, I. . . I didn’t know that he would have such powerful strength. Great-grandfather, will he be Alright?”

Gong Cheng glanced at her and immediately shook his head. He could not help but ask worriedly.

“No, his combat experience and reaction speed are much stronger than Liao Feiyu’s. He Won’t Lose!”

Gong Cheng Mu’s great-grandfather shook his head and said!

“That’s good, that’s Good! ”

Gong Cheng Mu let out a sigh of relief and continued to watch.

“To have such combat experience at such a young age, he must have a strong teacher behind him! ”

An old man standing beside Gong Cheng glanced at his great-grandfather and made a judgment!

The others nodded in agreement.

“Heavenly Sword, seal the Devil! ”

At this moment, Tianci’s cold voice sounded in the arena.

On the arena, an incomparably huge sword formation was formed.

The entire sword formation shone with a sharp luster. Countless sharp swords interweaved together to form a huge pattern.

The huge sword formation completely surrounded Liao Feiyu!

Numerous sharp swords continuously attacked him!

“Bang Bang Bang! ”

Liao Feiyu held his shield and blocked the attacks with an extremely ugly expression!

“Crack Crack Crack! ”

Cracks appeared on his huge shield!

“Damn it, how can this guy’s attacks be so strong!”

Liao Feiyu’s face was cold.

He didn’t plan to use his bloodline weapon immediately. He wanted to kill Tianci with his own strength.

Even if he won, others would know that he relied on his powerful weapon to kill Tianci.

But now, without using his bloodline weapon, he might not be his opponent!

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! ”

Just as he was thinking, the situation suddenly changed.

Below him, numerous sharp swords suddenly pierced through the soil under his feet and shot toward him.

“What?”

Liao Feiyu saw this scene and his face changed drastically.

But at this moment, he couldn’t react in time.

“Bang! Bang! Bang!”

“Bang! Bang! Bang!”

The sharp swords twisted and killed him, causing his hundred-meter-long body to quickly collapse. Pieces of Earth element energy armor collapsed and fell off!

The huge impact caused his heart to tremble violently and fresh blood flowed out from his mouth!

His body couldn’t help but fly up into the sky!

“That Liao Fei Yu is going to lose! ”

“He lost a little too quickly. To be able to defeat someone of the same level so quickly, this Mu Li Tian Ci’s strength is much stronger than I thought, almost half a step into the universe ruler realm! ”

Around them, some of the stronger warriors looked at the battle on the stage and decided in their hearts.

“HMPH!”

In the upper seat, at the position of the Black Earth tribe, Liao Fei Yu’s father and grandfather looked at this scene, their faces cold!

“Mu Li Tian Chi, don’t think of defeating me, I said I want to destroy you, I will destroy you! ”Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Liao Fei Yu spat out fresh blood and flew towards the sky.

His entire body was in extreme pain!

His face was slightly distorted, and his face was filled with a sinister expression.

Liao Feiyu’s palm slowly covered the spot on his chest, and he used all his strength to claw!

An earthen yellow hammer appeared in his hand, and when the entire Earth Hammer appeared.

It directly emitted an earthen yellow luster.

The water sword that was attacking him quickly crumbled and disappeared under this earthen yellow light.

It was as if it had encountered a terrifying existence!

Scram! ”

Liao Feiyu’s face was flushed red as he held the earth hammer and smashed it downwards.

The earthen yellow energy charged downwards, and the force of the impact covered the entire stage!

The shadow of the Earth Hammer covered the entire stage!

When Tianci saw this scene, his expression changed slightly. All the clones in the surroundings gathered towards him!

However, in the next instant, all of his clones crumbled under this energy!

Tianci raised the sharp sword in his hand. The sharp sword split into eight and circled around him, forming a defensive barrier!

Crack! Crack

However, this defensive barrier quickly crumbled under the Earth Hammer’s attack.

Fortunately, the Earth Hammer’s attack completely disappeared at this moment!

“Is this his foundation? Is this the treasure given to him by the experts of the Black Earth tribe?”

Tianci stared at the Earth Hammer and felt the threat of death.

However, his expression didn’t change much!

His foster father had already told him about Liao Feiyu’s treasure.

Now that he felt its terrifying power, he wasn’t worried at all. For the adoptive father, he has 100% confidence and trust!
