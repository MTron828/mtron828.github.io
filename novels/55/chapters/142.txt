In the Divine Dragon Medical Hall. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

A middle-aged man was shuddering as he lay on the bed next to his father.

A few juveniles were standing at the side with caution. They wailed softly and did not dare to move, let alone talk.

Scary!

They did not know that the owner of this medical hall had such a strong background.

Gazing at their elder brother and father who were lying on the beds, their faces turned pale.

Initially, it only cost two million for the treatment. Now, it had shot up to twenty million.

It’s twenty million... How much can the Zhao Family’s companies pay?

However, given such a circumstance now, they must pay. They had to pay.

Because of their arrogance just now, they needed to pay a painful price ten times more than before.

“Dragon King, these are some of our tokens of appreciations from the Martial Artists and families in Rivertown. I hope you can accept them!”

“Yes, Dragon King. Please accept them. Let us know if we can be of some use to you in Rivertown in the future.”

The Ren Family Head, Old Duan, and Hu Fei spoke to Wang Xian fervently and respectfully.

“Your thoughts are appreciated. Just leave it aside, and calling me Wang Xian will do.”

Wang Xian smiled and nodded at them.

“Yes.” The group of people smiled and nodded. They looked around and said with some hesitation, “Then we’ll take our leave now. Please rest well.”

“Okay, I still have some patients to attend to. Thank you for your concern.” Wang Xian nodded with a smile.

“You’re welcome!” The group of people beamed at Wang Xian.

“Okay.” Wang Xian nodded his head. Ren Family Head and the rest left, but only Old Xue stayed put.

“Old Xue, let me check your body,” Wang Xian said to Old Xue with a smile.

“Thank you, Wang Xian.” Old Xue thanked him as he followed Wang Xian to the second floor.

In fact, Wang Xian had already cured Old Xue’s injuries. But because Old Xue got implicated because of him last night, he decided to reward Old Xue.

“Lie down. I’ll unblock your meridians for you!” Wang Xian said with a smile.

“Unblock the meridians?” Old Xue hesitated as he revealed a pondering look. He lay on the bed slowly.

Wang Xian placed his hand inside Old Xue’s body and injected an immense amount of Dragon Energy into his meridians.

Even though Old Xue was a Level-seven Martial Artist, his Conception Vessel, and Governing Vessel, were not unblocked yet.

He did not use the Dragon Energy to unblock them. Instead, he unblocked all the vessels before the Conception Vessel and Governing Vessel.

That is to say, if Old Xue wanted to attain Level Nine in the future, it would take him a few months to do so, and it would be a breeze for him.

Wang Xian clearly distinguished his gratitude and resentment.

Old Xue moved his body on the bed, looking shocked.

“Done!” Wang Xian smiled as he opened his eyes slightly.

“My meridians are unblocked. You actually unblocked my meridians!” Old Xue flinched as he stared at Wang Xian with disbelief.

“You had a tough time yesterday.” Wang Xian shook his head and smiled.

“Compared to what I have now, the pain I received yesterday was nothing!” Old Xue shook his head and exclaimed. “Others envied that I can make friends with you. I’m also envious of myself now. Unblocking the meridians... Only the top ten miracle doctors of the Miracle Doctor Chart can do this. Your medical skill is extremely terrific!”

“Miracle Doctor Chart?”

“You didn’t know about it?” asked Old Xue doubtfully.

Wang Xian shook his head.

“The Miracle Doctor Chart is an international chart that consists of the top-notch miracle doctors in the world.”

“The first on the chart is Hand of God from Europe. He’s recognized as the world’s number one. It is said that he is capable of reviving the dead.”

“The second on the chart is Medical Saint from China. He’s the current Head of the Medical Saint Sect. The third one is Sacred One, the Head of the Sacred Followers Guild!”

“Fourth is Emperor Samana from India and fifth is King Sanhe from an island country...”

“It is said that each miracle doctor is highly-skilled in medicines, and they can also use special techniques to unblock the meridians to increase the cultivation speed.”

“Of course, unblocking meridians needs to consume a large number of herbs. So it is tedious. Wang Xian, I’m really grateful that you can help me unblock them,” Old Xue said to Wang Xian thankfully.

Wang Xian nodded his head slowly. He did not know that there was such a chart around in the world.

“Wang Xian, I’ll not disturb you further. Let me know when you need any help!” Old Xue cupped his fist and said.

“Sure, Old Xue!”

Wang Xian nodded his head and sent Old Xue to the door. After which, he spun around and looked at those who were standing in the medical hall obediently. Wang Xian revealed a faint smile. He walked over and gave them treatment.

Doctor Sun stood by the side with curiosity piqued. Her eyes were full of admiration.

For the subsequent days, the Divine Dragon Medical Hall was finally made known in Rivertown. Every day, there would be two or three patients turning up at the medical hall to seek treatment.

At the same time, not only did the medical skills of Miracle Doctor Wang become famous, but also the rules of the medical hall.

Apart from the expensive fees, the patients must have a good attitude. Otherwise, no one knew how much Miracle Doctor Wang would quote for the cost of treatment.

The medical hall received two or three patients and earned about six to ten million a day.

Within a short period of ten days, his deposits hit $150 million.

“Tsk tsk, I’m also a billionaire now.”

Wang Xian lay on his deck chair and smiled to himself.

Wang Xian was delighted as he’d penniless in the first place, but now he had $150 million in his hand,

“Brother.”

At this time, he suddenly heard Xiao Yu’s voice. Wang Xian spun around and saw Xiao Yu, who was beautifully dressed.

Ever since he’d strengthened Xiao Yu’s constitution with his Dragon Energy, the military training was much easier for her.

Her skin was not that tanned anymore.

“You got a break?” asked Wang Xian with a smile.

“Yes. I don’t have military training tonight, and tomorrow is the last day of it!” Xiao Yu walked in happily. She grinned at Wang Xian. “Why are you lying down here like an uncle?”

“Hehe, I’m relaxing. Get me a cup of tea!” said Wang Xian smilingly to Xiao Yu.

“Sure, my brother!”

Xiao Yu walked to the side, filled the teacup, and passed it to Wang Xian. “Brother, it’s National Day soon. When are we going back?”

“National Day?” Wang Xian paused and looked at his phone. Indeed, it was almost the end of the month. “I had forgotten about it. We’re not going back.”

“Brother, Sister Li is getting married on National Day. Don’t you want to go back?” Xiao Yu rolled her eyes at Wang Xian. Then she picked up a huge Bodhi figure from the table.

“She’s getting married?” Wang Xian was stunned. “But Uncle Zhang did not tell me!”

“Sister Li told me. So I guess Uncle Zhang didn’t tell you. We need to go back on National Day,” said Xiao Yu. She hesitated and decided to continue, “Brother, I want to tell you something. But you must not let anyone you know. A lady asked me to be her disciple and join her sect. I agreed!”
