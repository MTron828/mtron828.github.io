Chapter 1309: 1310 was a slap to the face

“What is this? is the competition for the position of the Crown Prince of the Dragon Dynasty going to be decided today?”

“This... Long Xiaotian actually sent all of his subordinates directly to compete with the other princes. Isn’t he a little too hasty? With his current strength, he can’t crush them at all!”

“Isn’t this a little stupid?”

When the surrounding people saw Long Xiaotian’s subordinates surrounding them, they didn’t leave immediately. Instead, they stood by the side and watched.

When some people saw this situation, they said in surprise.

It was a little reckless to make a move at this time!

Moreover, judging from the strength of his subordinates, they weren’t a match for the five princes at all!

“Do you like it? I said that I would help brother Long Xiaotian take down the position of crown prince, and I will do it as I said!”

Wang Xian looked at the ferocious and excited expressions of long Xiaochen and the rest, and a smile appeared on his face.

“Roar!”

“Roar!”

“Hualala!”

However, just as Wang Xian finished speaking, two beast roars suddenly came from below.

Zhang Fengying’s figure appeared. She moved and came to Wang Xian’s side. She stood silently by the side.

“Eh?”

Two ferocious beasts at the first level of the Seethrough realm suddenly flew out from the bottom of the sea, causing the expressions of long Xiaochen and the other princes to change slightly.

However, they did not panic.

“Hehe, four powerhouses at the first level of the Seethrough realm. Even you, Wang Xian, have the combat strength of the first level of the Seethrough realm. It’s still not enough to deal with us!”

Long Xiaochen and the other princes glanced at the group of people surrounding them and said coldly. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Kill the enemy!”

However, Long Xiaotian did not waste any time with them. He raised his hand and roared.

“Roar!”

“Roar! Roar!”

Roars came from everyone’s mounts.

“Chirp! Chirp!”

After the roars, a different kind of chirping sound was heard. At the rear, more than ten birds that were emitting light flew over.

Every bird and beast was emitting a powerful aura.

Especially the one in the middle that was at the first level of the profound void tier. In the dark night, it was like a blazing sun.

“What?”

“That’s a flying dodo bird, a flying dodo bird at the profound void tier!”

“Hiss, a flying dodo bird at the profound void tier and more than ten half-step profound void tier beasts. No Wonder Long Xiaotian dared to show his cards at this time. With this strength, he can completely fight against the forces of the five princes!”

“These... those two middle-aged insightful void tier one middle-aged men and three ferocious beasts of insightful void tier one can definitely fight against the five insightful void tier experts beside the five princes. With the dodo birds and the subordinates riding on their mounts, the second prince has a high chance of winning this battle!”

When the surrounding people saw the dodo birds that suddenly appeared, their expressions changed slightly.

Everyone had a look of amazement on their faces. Long Xiaotian’s forces, even if they did not rely on the light dragon dynasty, were still not to be ignored.

“Kill! Those who surrender will be spared your lives!”

Long Xiaotian roared!

“Kill!”

His subordinates and fierce beasts instantly moved and directly attacked the subordinates of the five princes.

“What?”

They did not allow Long Xiaochen and the other princes to be shocked or have any time to think. They attacked them one by one.

“Face the enemy!”

Long Xiaochen and the other three princes roared with ugly expressions. They moved and retreated to the side.

“This... They are fighting. They are fighting right now!”

“The competition between the princes of the Light Dragon dynasty is very cruel!”

The eyes of the surrounding people flickered when they saw the battle between thousands of people.

“Damn it! Damn it! How could long Xiaotian have so many fierce beasts? !”

At this moment, the five princes who flew to the side watched the battle with unsightly expressions.

If it weren’t for that flock of Dodos, their strength would definitely be stronger than long Xiaotian’s.

However, the appearance of the dodos made their subordinates completely unable to match them.

Those were more than ten half-step void interpretation fierce beasts!

“CHIRP CHIRP!”

“How could this be? How could this be!”

Xu Wenling looked at the Dodo bird that was attacking him. His face was filled with cold sweat.

He never expected that the current second prince would be so powerful that he could fight against five of them alone.

Furthermore, he could completely suppress them.

A strong sense of regret surged into his heart. If he wasn’t jealous of Wang Xian back then, if he had submitted to the second Prince back then, he might be riding a half-step void interpretation beast now.

In the future, he would also become the king’s trusted aide.

Now, he regretted it!

Looking at the beast in front of him, he immediately braced himself. With an ugly expression, he gritted his teeth and responded.

“This... There are more half-step void interpretation experts at the second prince’s side. The Victor has already been decided!”

“I really didn’t expect that the position of the Crown Prince of the Light Dragon Dynasty would last for another seven months. I didn’t expect it to be decided now!”

Looking at the battle in front of the island, everyone sighed.

“Long Xiaotian, I’ll go teach your brothers a lesson!”

Wang Xian took a glance at the battlefield and said to Long Xiaotian with a smile. He then looked at long Xiaochen and the rest.

“Eh? Brother Wang Xian... as long as their lives are not harmed!”

Long Xiaotian hesitated for a moment before saying with a smile.

“Don’t worry, they are your brothers after all!”

Wang Xian revealed a faint smile. With a move of his arm, the lightning strike wood appeared in his hand. He narrowed his eyes slightly and looked at long Xiaochen and the rest.

“Eh? What are you going to do?”

When the 42nd Prince saw Wang Xian looking at them with a hostile gaze, his expression changed slightly. He stared at Wang Xian with his eyes wide open.

The rest of the princes also turned their heads to look at Wang Xian with uncertain expressions.

“You guys are making me very unhappy. Of course, I will teach you guys a lesson!”

The corners of Wang Xian’s mouth curled up slightly as he walked over slowly.

“You...”

Long Xiaochen stared at Wang Xian with uncertain expressions. His gaze swept across Long Xiaotian who was behind him.

“Brothers, don’t worry. Brother Wang Xian will not take your lives!”

“Don’t look at me. It’s useless even if you look at me. Who asked you to make brother Wang Xian unhappy!”

As Long Xiaotian spoke, a faint smile appeared on his face.

“HMPH, Wang Xian, don’t think that just because you have an extraordinary status, you don’t put everyone in your eyes. I, Long Xiaochen, am a heaven’s favorite. Do you really think that I’m afraid of You?”

Long Xiaochen snorted coldly when he heard long Xiaotian’s words. He stared at Wang Xian coldly.

“Heaven’s Pride?”

The corners of Wang Xian’s mouth curled into a mocking smile. He was merely a heaven’s pride who was ranked seventh!

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

He moved his arm and a thick and heavy thorn went straight for them.

“You’re courting death!”

The expressions of the five of them changed drastically. They immediately picked up the weapons in their hands and slashed at the Thorn!

However, what frightened them was that their attacks did not have any effect when they landed on the Thorn.

“Ahhhhh!”

The few of them let out a blood-curdling scream as their bodies struggled violently.

“Pa pa pa pa pa pa!”

However, very soon, the sound of a face-smacking was heard.

The brambles were flung directly onto their faces, appearing exceptionally eye-catching in the night sky!
