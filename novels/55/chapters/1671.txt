Chapter 1672: The 1672 immortal fire Lark clan did not give up

A powerful assassin organization would cause all the forces to be afraid, even to the point of being terrified.

The former underworld assassin organization had assassinated more than a thousand great demons of the ten thousand fey empire who were at the profound void tier in one night. Their reputation shook the entire transcendence continent.

They were known as the most powerful assassin organization.

And now, the assassin organization under Wang Xian would definitely be famous throughout the entire transcendence continent.

The 500 assassin organizations that had the ability to assassinate a level six SEETHROUGH expert did indeed have such capabilities. Their voices shook the entire continent.

“If there were no other factions interfering, the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop wouldn’t dare to continue wasting their time with us!”

Feng Yun said in a deep voice.

The news that the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan received was very accurate and timely. In Fengtian city, there were disciples of the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan disguised as a mercenary group and stayed there.

From the information they received, they could clearly recognize the strength of this assassin organization.

She could even tell that their firecloud sparrow disciples were filled with fear.

At that time, they were hiding in Fengtian city. If they were unlucky, they might be among the assassins.

“With young master Wang’s assassin organization, we don’t have any scruples even if they don’t leave!”

A few clan elders said excitedly.

Back when Wang Xian came, he had mentioned that he had an assassin organization. However, the high-level members of the fire Lark clan didn’t pay much attention to it.

After all, they were facing an organization that was only inferior to an empire.

However, when they saw this piece of information, they couldn’t believe it.

However, when they thought about how young master Wang was able to raise Huo Luo'er, who had just matured, to the eighth level of the Seethrough Void Tier, the surprise in their hearts lessened a little.

This was a person who was full of miracles.

“Reporting to the patriarch, Young Master Wang Is Back!”

At this moment, an elder came in to report.

“Let’s go and meet him!”

Feng Yun stood up and said directly.

“It’s the Patriarch!”

Everyone nodded their heads and disappeared in an instant.

“Senior Feng Yun, come in!”

Wang Xian returned to the room and sensed the fluctuations in the surroundings. When he knew that Feng Yun and the rest had rushed over, he immediately said.

“Thank you, Young Master Wang, for your help this time!”

Feng Yun led a group of high-ranking members of the fire Lark clan over and said with a smile.

“Hehe, senior Feng Yun, you don’t have to be so polite. Although the two major forces have left this time, it’s still uncertain whether the other party will make a comeback!”

Wang Xian shook his head.

“No matter what, Young Master Wang, your help has relieved us of a lot of pressure!”

The clan elder at the side said with a smile.

“Young master Wang, I have a spirit fruit of the first level of longevity here. See if you can increase your strength!”

Feng Yun took out a fruit from her interspatial ring.

The moment the fruit was taken out, the red glow that it emitted illuminated the entire room. One look and one could tell that it was extraordinary.

“Oh? Then thank you, senior Feng Yun!”

When Wang Xian saw the fruit, a hint of joy flashed across his eyes. He immediately took it.

After a brief chat for more than ten minutes, Feng Yun and the rest left.

Wang Xian took a look at the fruit and consumed it immediately.

From Fengtian City, Wang Xian’s harvest could be said to be extremely rich.

He had harvested tens of thousands of insightful void-level elixirs, six to seven thousand weapons, and many other resources.

There were more than four thousand corpses of insightful void-level powerhouses. As for the corpses of transcendents at level seven and above, there were more than 3.7 million.

Just these corpses alone could create more than ten half-step longevity cultivators for the Dragon Palace.

“If I add these elixirs and the spiritual fruits given by Feng Yun, the energy required to level up should be able to reach 80% !”

Wang Xian thought to himself as he swallowed the elixirs and spiritual herbs one by one.

“As expected, there’s still about 20% left!”

Wang Xian looked at his attributes and his face was full of smiles.

It wouldn’t be long before he could level up.

At that time, throughout the entire central continent region, Wang Xian could be considered a big shot.

“Phew, I wonder what will happen next. If the two major factions really give up, I will lead strange demon and the rest to assassinate the people from the two major factions and visit their elixir store and weapons store!”

“If they make a comeback, I will have to deal with them carefully!”

Wang Xian thought to himself as he looked into volcano city.

At this moment, there was a commotion in volcano city.

Everyone from the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan had received the news that the two forces had left.

This was undoubtedly a heavy sigh of relief for everyone.

In the past year or so, the attacks from the life and Death Elixir Workshop and the holy item forging workshop had caused the entire fire cloud sparrow clan to suffer heavy losses.

Now, there were only two of those affiliated forces. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Everyone in the entire fire cloud city was discussing that mysterious assassin organization, and they were all filled with excitement.

The reason why the two major forces in Fengtian City had retreated was also quickly spread to the ears of the other forces in the central continent.

When they heard that it was a mysterious assassin organization that had forced the two major forces to leave helplessly, everyone’s faces revealed a shocked expression.

Especially when they heard that they had killed more than four thousand insightful void martial experts and several million people in a single day, everyone’s first reaction was disbelief.

They believed that someone was exaggerating the truth.

Some powerful factions repeatedly confirmed this and sucked in a breath of cold air.

A terrifying assassin organization was about to rise.

The Terror of an assassin organization possessed the ability to change a war.

Some people compared this mysterious assassin organization to the underworld assassin organization, but many people also thought that this mysterious assassin organization might not be inferior to the underworld.

“Leader, a new assassin organization rose up on the main road. In one day, it assassinated more than four thousand insightful void martial artists, three to four million people!”

At this moment, in the distant Dark Valley, a pitch-black, scale-covered humanoid Demon Beast entered a hall and reported to the leader in the darkness.

“Let me see!”

The demonic beast in the darkness waved its arm and looked at the information on it.

“Retreat!”

However, with just a glance, the paper turned into ashes and smoke. The voice in the darkness did not have the slightest fluctuation.

It seemed that this was an extremely boring piece of information to him.

It was not worth him looking at!

“The war between our life and Death Pill Workshop and the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan is not over yet. We will destroy the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan!”

“Our holy item forging workshop will not rest until we exterminate the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan!”

Just as everyone in the central continent was paying attention to the mysterious assassin organization, voices suddenly came from the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop.

In the respective cities of the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop, all the disciples and all the experts were gathered in front of their public square.

At the very front was a figure that was emitting a dazzling light.

They stood in the air and looked at their subordinates as if they were gods.

“We will not rest until the fire lark clan is destroyed!”

The two god-like figures coldly roared. Their oppressive voices resounded throughout the main cities of the two forces.
