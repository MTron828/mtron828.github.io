3784 The first step of 2783’s counterattack

“Recently, Our Angel clan and the Phoenix clan seem to be in a bit of trouble. The elders have issued an order. I wonder if the third prince has killed the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace.”

“I don’t think so. If he has killed the Dragon King, the third Prince should have announced it. This time, the third prince has caused us a lot of trouble. If he can’t kill the Dragon King, he’ll have to bear the consequences!”

“Hehe, the third prince didn’t expect the Dragon King to grow so terrifying. Oh right, we have to be careful. I heard that the Dragon King has the strength to kill a master of the sixth level. He also has powerful treasures and a ghost clone.”

“Haha, if the Dragon King dares to come here, he will never come back. Our Holy Angel Judgement Formation can kill a master of the seventh level in one blow.”

“That’s right. Although the Aurora Domain was ambushed by the Dragon King, our place is different from the Aurora Domain.”

In the front of the storm continent, eight angels were chatting idly.

Around them were more than ten level five masters of the universe.

This was all the power they had to guard this place.

The number of masters didn’t need to be too many. As long as they were strong enough, it would be enough!

Although the number of strong warriors here wasn’t as great as the Aurora Domain, their defensive and counterattack abilities were stronger than the Aurora Domain.

Most importantly, the Dragon King had only ambushed the weak of the angel race. Even the universe dominator level 6 warriors weren’t attacked.

“I hope the third prince can get rid of the Dragon King as soon as possible. Our Angel race can not afford to lose face.”

An angel said faintly.

“Buzz! Buzz!”

Just as he finished speaking, the sound of alarm around them suddenly sounded.

Here, the basic vigilance and defense were still based on the means of the technological world.

Crestford was also located here, in a metal fortress, and was conducting research.

When the alarm sounded, the group of angels immediately looked over.

Crestfall’s gaze also focused as he instantly rushed out of the fortress.

“It’s the Astral Beast!”

Through the information transmitted from the alarm, crestfall’s gaze stared to the right as he shouted with a grave expression!

“Wu Wu!”

At this moment, all the Angels heard the roar of the Astral Beast.

“This might?”

The group of Angels felt a savage aura rushing over and their expressions changed slightly.

Over 20 angels swiftly flew into the sky and looked over.

In their line of sight, Little Blue’s incomparably huge body appeared.

He had an extremely terrifying huge body, like a terrifyingly bloated swimming fish.

He had a pair of wings that were like fins and wings.

The Aura on his body wasn’t concealed at all.

With this roar, even the space beast race from the two storm continents looked over.

“A Level 4 universe overlord Space Beast. Damn it, why is this thing here? If it was in the 9-origin universe, I would have killed it!”

The group of angels looked over, their eyes revealing a cold and embarrassed expression.

“If it wasn’t for the suppression of the space universe, we could have easily killed it. However, this space beast is courting death. It has already entered the range. Attack and kill it!”

“Hahaha, if we can get our hands on this Space Beast’s corpse, it’ll be pretty good!”

The two level 6 rulers laughed loudly.

Crestus flew over. Hearing their words, he let out a slight sigh of relief!

“Attack!”

The five angels looked at each other. A sharp sword appeared in their hands, and they swung it heavily!

In the surrounding area, the angel statues on the Sacred Mountain of light waved the huge swords in their hands.

A beam of light shot out from the huge swords and formed a blade.

More than ten blades merged together and slashed directly at the space beast.

And that Space Beast was Xiao Lan!

“Eh? This attack!”

At this moment, Wang Xian and Lan Qingyue, who were inside Xiao Lan’s body, felt this attack. Their expressions changed slightly.

This attack was completely out of their expectations.

The reason why Xiao Lan’s figure rushed out in an instant was to test out the attacks from the dozens of radiant mountains.

“Xiao Lan, use all your strength to block it!”

Lan qingyue also felt the terror of this attack. She shouted at Xiao Lan!

Gray energy burst out from her body. A phantom image of a Kun appeared.

Lan Qingyue waved her arm, and the image of the Kun entered Little Blue’s body, directly passing through his body.

A Kun image formed around him, completely protecting him!

“Wu Wu!”

Little Blue’s body trembled slightly, and the flesh on his body began to squirm. A gray energy was attached to his body.

“Boom!”

In the next second, the terrifying holy light sword directly stood above little blue.

Lan Qingyue’s all-out defense was quickly destroyed by the Holy Sword of light.

The attack was still aimed at little blue’s body.

“Boom!”

An extremely dull sound rang out as gray energy surged out of Little Blue’s body.

An extremely terrifying crack quickly appeared.

It covered a third of Little Blue’s body.

It went deep into a fifth of Little Blue’s body.

“Wu Wu!”

Blue let out a scream. If Lan Qingyue hadn’t blocked this attack, it would have been enough to split blue into two.

“Wu Wu!”

“Wu Wu Wu!”

When Blue’s scream sounded, the same roar came from the front and right.

In the next moment, Little House and Little White appeared on the left and back of the experts of the Angel clan!

Little House and little white swayed their enormous bodies and directly attacked the Divine Mountains of light!

“What! ?”

“Not good, one attack didn’t kill that Space Beast, and two more space beasts came!”

“Oh no, the next attack of the Angel Judgement Formation will take a few seconds, the formation is going to be destroyed!”

At this moment, all the Angels had ugly and shocked expressions on their faces when they saw little white and little white suddenly appear.

Their eyes were filled with Panic!

“Bang! Bang! Bang!”

At this moment, little white and Little White’s bodies had already arrived in front of the Divine Mountain of light. They directly collided with it. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

In an instant, five or six divine mountains of light collapsed!

They continued to attack the group of angels.

“Damn it, we’re not their match. Run!”

One of the Angels hurriedly roared and flew toward the teleportation formation in front of them.

“Wuuu!”

However, at this moment, Little House let out a wild roar. Gray energy instantly enveloped them and pulled them into the Kun domain!

The group of angels, who were the strongest rulers of the sixth stage, were still a little slow.
