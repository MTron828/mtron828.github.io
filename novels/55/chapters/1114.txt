“Dragon King, this should be a race of demonic beasts. Furthermore, they are not weak!”

At the West Gate of the Dragon Palace, Wang Xian looked ahead. Behind him, a group of members of the Dragon Palace followed behind him.

Other than the leaders of the strange demon clan and Prime Minister Gui, most of the subordinates of the Dragon Palace had the strength of a level five extraordinary being.

With the Divine Dragon Bloodline, they were able to unleash the combat strength of level six extraordinary.

With the enhancement of the array formation of the Dragon Palace, their strength could be tripled and they could unleash the strength of level seven extraordinary.

With over 3,000 warriors of the Dragon Palace, in addition to Xiao Lan’s strength, the strength of the Dragon Palace could be considered a powerful race of demonic beasts at the bottom of the sea.

Wang Xian nodded his head and looked at the group of demonic beasts that were carefully sneaking over.

“Get ready to welcome them!”

Wang Xian walked out slowly and stared ahead.

“Hide in the surroundings!”

Prime Minister Gui waved his hand at the group of members of the Dragon Palace behind him and ordered.

“Yes!”

Ao qitian, Ao Qi, and Ao Jian immediately led their subordinates and hid behind the surrounding mountains.

The Strange Monster clan immediately disappeared.

Under the detection of the array formation, three hundred green figures with longbows on their backs slowly approached.

The figure at the front looked around vigilantly.

A huge building suddenly appeared at the bottom of the sea. Even if he was a profound void tier creature, he was still extremely fearful.

What kind of power could directly build a group of buildings at the bottom of the sea?

“Such a vast amount of spiritual energy is gathering here. This must be a paradise. If we can cultivate here, our wind-eye clan will definitely be able to improve quickly!”

The green eyes of the figure at the front flickered as he looked at the sky, flickering with an unknown luster.

“Oh my God, what a magnificent building!”

“What’s that pillar? It’s emitting golden light. It’s too terrifying!”

“How could such a majestic underwater city appear out of thin air? !”

At the back, all the creatures of the Wind Eye clan were staring at this place in shock with green light flashing in their eyes.

Although their strength had not reached the profound void tier, their powerful ocular arts allowed them to see through the formation.

Looking at the golden ocean-pacifying divine needle that was hundreds of meters tall in front of them, their faces were filled with shock.

“We’ve been discovered!”

When the creature at the front saw Prime Minister Wang Xiangui and the rest who were standing in front of the West Gate of the Dragon Gate, he was slightly shocked.

“Oh? They saw us from a distance of ten kilometers. It seems that this demonic beast race also possesses ocular skills!”

Wang Xian and the demonic beast looked at each other. He could tell that the other party had already seen him.

“May I know why all of you have come to my Dragon Palace?”

Wang Xian asked the creature in a deep voice.

The creature that was lying on the ground hesitated for a moment before standing up.

The group of people from the wind-eye clan behind him also stood up when they saw Wang Xian. They frowned and looked ahead.

“Leader, we...”

An aged creature from the wind-eye clan walked forward. He looked at the leader at the front and said.

“Let’s go and take a look. This underwater city that suddenly appeared is too close to our lair. We have to know if it’s a friend or foe!”

The creature standing at the front had a thoughtful look on his face. After hesitating for a moment, he walked towards the front.

The group of people following behind did not hesitate at all. They followed behind and walked towards the direction of the Dragon Palace.

The group of creatures from the Wind Eye clan at the back took down the longbow on their back. They scanned their surroundings vigilantly.

Looking at the wind-eye clan who was walking towards the Dragon Palace, Wang Xian sized them up from head to toe.

A Demon Beast at the void interpretation level should be at the first level of the void interpretation level. There were three to four half-step void interpretation level demon beasts, more than a dozen of them were at transcendent level nine, and the rest of them were all at least at transcendent level six.

The closer they got, the more shocked the people from the phoenix-eye clan were.

The leader who was walking at the front was also sizing up prime minister Wang Xiangui and the rest. His eyes were filled with astonishment.

“We are the wind-eye Demon Beast clan. We are located more than 100 kilometers away from here. Just now, we sensed a large amount of spiritual energy gathering here. We are here to investigate. What is Your Race?”

The leader of the wind-eye clan stared at Prime Minister Wang Xiangui and the rest cautiously. Then, he stopped three kilometers away.

The people of the Wind-eye clan behind him looked around.

“The wind-eye Demon Beast Clan?”

Wang Xian looked at them with a twinkle in his eyes.

“We are from the Ocean Dragon Clan. This will be our territory in the future. I wonder if you are interested in joining our Dragon Clan!”

Prime Minister Gui was carrying a turtle shell on his back. He sized them up and narrowed his eyes slightly.

“HMM?”

Prime Minister Gui’s words made the leader of the Wind Eye clan alert. He looked at Prime Minister Gui and then at Wang Xian.

“Dragon Palace? What does it have to do with the Dragon Clan in the Sea of Dragons?”

He asked them with a twinkle in his eyes.

“It doesn’t matter. I wonder if Your Wind Eye clan is interested in joining our Dragon Palace!”

Prime Minister Gui said as he took two steps forward slowly. He looked at Wang Xian and said, “This is the Dragon King of our Dragon Palace. If you join the Dragon Palace, you will become citizens of the Dragon Palace and live in the Dragon Palace!”

“Our Dragon Palace is a huge paradise. Cultivating in it is many times better than cultivating in the outside world!”

Prime Minister Gui said slowly as the turtle shell on his back shimmered.

“I’m not interested!”

The leader of the wind-eye clan shook his head slowly.

“Then, do you guys want to be our guests?”

Prime Minister Gui invited them with a smile on his face. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“No need. We are just here to take a look!”

The leader of the wind-eye clan shook his head warily.

Wang Xian looked at Prime Minister Gui beside him and smiled.

This Prime Minister Gui was really cunning. It was obvious that he wanted to subdue the wind-eye clan. At the very least, he wanted to keep them here.

Survival at the bottom of the sea. The strong preyed on the weak. If the Dragon Palace wanted to develop rapidly, the only way was to kill and subdue the ferocious beasts.

There was no other way!

On the way to the throne, there was no mercy. There was only fighting.

“Everyone, since you are here, don’t leave this place for unnecessary trouble!”

The turtle shell on prime minister turtle’s back trembled slightly. The Demon War Division, Thunder Division, and Golden Swordfish clan, who were hiding behind the surrounding mountains, were all standing on the mountains.

“Roar!”

A soft sound was heard. At the position of the Dragon Gate, Xiao Lan, which was more than a thousand meters in size, swam out slowly and hovered above Wang Xian and the rest.

Her two eyes were bigger than a house. Her gray eyes were staring at everyone from the wind-eye tribe.

“Hiss!”

“What giant beast is this!”

Three kilometers away, the expressions of the creatures from the wind-eye tribe changed drastically. Just the visual impact of the giant beast, which was more than a thousand meters in size, shocked them greatly.

The expression of the wind-eyed race’s leader also changed slightly. His eyes revealed a cold expression.

“You are even more cunning than humans!”
