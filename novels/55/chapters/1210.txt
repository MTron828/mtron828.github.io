Dual-attributed cultivator!

When everyone saw the young man in tattered clothes use his metal attribute attack again, everyone was in an uproar.

Everyone was very clear about how terrifying dual-attributed cultivators were.

Everyone who dared to cultivate dual-attributed was either a madman or a peerless genius.

However, this level 9 transcendent, dual-attributed young man in front of them was clearly not a madman, but a peerless genius.

“Dual-attributed, and he has even cultivated to level 9 transcendent. His strength is definitely enough to ascend the prodigy roll!”

“This is really beyond everyone’s expectations. Dual-attributed, who would have thought that a dual-attributed genius would appear. No wonder he can fight against a half-step void interpretation, he completely has the ability to fight against opponents of a higher level!”

Everyone was in an uproar, their eyes wide open as they stared in shock at the young man in tattered clothes who was fighting against three level 9 transcendents and a half-step void interpretation expert.

At this moment, his tattered clothes made him look even taller.

Only a monster who trained hard could cultivate his dual attributes to such a level.

“What’s going on in this demi-human graveyard? A month ago, a peerless genius who seemed to have dual attributes directly destroyed heavenly sword star, and now another one has appeared. Heavens, isn’t this letting people live?”

A young man sighed, looking at the shabby-clothed young man with envy and reverence.

“He fought against four experts of the Meng clan, and wasn’t at a disadvantage at all. He’s so strong, as expected of a peerless genius with dual attributes!”

An old man at the side stared at the battle in the arena and sighed.

The moment the dual-attribute cultivator appeared, the entire arena was in shock.

“How can this be? No, he must die, he must die!”

When Meng Shaoqin saw the tattered clothes of the young man suddenly erupt with dual-attributed cultivation, his expression turned incomparably ugly. His eyes revealed a crazed envy as he roared in a low voice.

A dual-attributed peerless genius who had even cultivated to transcendent level 9. In the future, he had a very high chance of becoming a peerless expert who could shake an entire region.

To become enemies with such a person, he had to completely eliminate him. Otherwise, there would be endless trouble in the future!

“How can this be, how is this possible?”

Zhou Yanmei, who was at the side, also had a face full of shock, staring at the young man in the battle field in disbelief.

Her eyes suddenly revealed a look of regret.

If she could catch up to such a peerless genius, even the Zhou clan would definitely support her with all their might.

“Wear the Golden Sword!”

“Ahhhhh!”

Suddenly, in the battle field, after an ice-cold shout, a miserable sound was heard.

Everyone was slightly shocked.

Three level 9 transcendents fell to the ground and lost their life force. The half-step void interpretation expert was heavily injured!

“How is this possible...”

Meng Shaoqin cried out in shock. His body trembled and he hurriedly took out his communication stone plate.

Was this the terror of a dual-element expert?

This sentence appeared in the minds of everyone around.

“Eh? He actually mastered the combined attack of two types of golden water sword principles. His talent is really extraordinary!”

Wang Xian, who thought that he would need another five to six minutes to finish the battle, was astonished when he saw the golden-piercing sword.

He had mastered two types of golden water sword principles in a month. His talent was definitely terrifying.

“You You...”

The half-step void interpretation expert of the Meng clan had an extremely pale face. He had a huge sword wound on his abdomen. When he saw the ragged-clothed young man staring at him with killing intent, his expression changed drastically, and he retreated.

“Those who kill will be killed!”

The ragged-clothed young man’s eyes were devoid of any emotion. He raised the large sword in his hand and slashed directly at him.

“Ah!”

In less than twenty moves, the half-step void interpretation expert of the Meng clan died. He turned his head and stared at Meng Shaoqin.

“What do you want to Do? What do you want to Do? I’m telling you, don’t act recklessly!”

Meng Shaoqin saw the young man in tattered clothes staring at him. His face changed drastically and he retreated.

He no longer had the arrogance from before. He no longer had the arrogance of being a butcher and being a fish.

His face was filled with cold sweat as his eyes flickered.

“HMM?”

Zhou Yanmei’s expression was extremely ugly when she saw this scene. She looked at the tattered young man and hesitated for a moment before saying, “You should stop. The Meng clan is very strong.”

“Bzz!”

The tattered young man turned his head and stared at Zhou Yanmei. His eyes were filled with killing intent.

Zhou Yanmei’s expression changed drastically while the old woman’s expression also changed slightly.

“All of you deserve to die!” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The young man in shabby clothes said coldly.

“This... is a complete reversal of the situation just now!”

“Everyone thought that the Meng clan was going to exterminate that young man. Who would have thought, who would have thought!”

“Haha, now Meng Shaoqin and Zhou Yanmei are finished!”

When the crowd saw this scene, they couldn’t help but mock.

Just a moment ago, they wanted to kill others and snatch their treasures. Now, they had become fish meat.

“You have a good temperament. If you continue to grow, you can become a powerhouse!”

Wang Xian looked at the young man in tattered clothes. A hint of satisfaction appeared on his face. It was not in vain for him to give him that huge sword.

It didn’t disappoint him.

“Huh?”

Suddenly, he turned his head and looked at the sky on the left.

“Who dares to kill a member of the Meng Clan? They deserve to die ten thousand deaths!”

At this moment, a deep voice rang out from the sky. It was so loud that it covered an area of five to six kilometers around the sword mansion.

Hearing this, everyone was slightly shocked.

“It’s a member of the Meng clan! Oh My God, why are there so many people from the Meng Clan? Why are they rushing here so quickly? !”

“Two void interpretation experts? Oh My God, the Meng clan only has a total of six void interpretation experts, and two of them are here!”

“How can there be so many people? Two insightful emptiness realm experts, and more than half of the Meng clan’s elites are here. There are at least five or six half-insightful emptiness realm experts!”

The faces of everyone in front of the sword mansion changed drastically. They stared in shock at the two hundred or so people flying toward them in the sky.

That’s right, there were more than two hundred people, and all of them were the Meng clan’s elites.

Obviously, the Meng clan must have something important to bring so many clansmen to the ladyboy graveyard.

“That dual-element Peerless Heaven’s favorite is going to die!”

“His luck is really not good. The Meng clan’s people are actually nearby!”

Some People’s expressions changed slightly as they sighed on behalf of the young man in tattered clothes.

“Haha, we all deserve to die. I think you deserve to die. No one can save your dog life today!”

Meng Shaoqin hurriedly turned his head. When he saw his clansmen arrive, his face revealed an excited malevolence.

He puffed out his chest and stared at the shabby-clothed young man as he roared.

“Ai, you’re the one courting death. You Can’t blame anyone else!”

Zhou Yanmei saw the Meng clansmen arrive and also let out a slight sigh of relief. Her gaze was ice-cold as she spoke to him.

When the shabby-clothed young man saw the over 200 people flying over, his expression changed drastically.

Without the slightest hesitation, he directly fled into the distance.

“Sou!”

“Hong!”

Suddenly, a wind sword that was at least 1,000 meters in size was inserted directly in front of the young man in tattered clothes.

This caused panic to appear in his eyes.

“A mountain brat killed my clansmen and still wants to escape? In your dreams!”

A green figure flashed and instantly stood on the wind sword that was 1,000 meters in size that was inserted into the ground, arrogantly staring at the young man in tattered clothes.

The young man in tattered clothes had a drastic change in expression. There was a hint of bitterness in his eyes.

“Why are you so unlucky? Two experts at the first level of the Seethrough realm. Let’s test my current strength!”

When Wang Xian saw this scene, he thought of the young man in tattered clothes who had been kneeling in the sword tomb for more than an hour. He shook his head slowly.

Being surrounded by two Seethrough realm experts and more than 200 extraordinary realm experts, that fellow was almost 100% dead.

He looked at that unlucky child with some ridicule!

Unlucky Child!

Fortunately, you met me!

I’ll save you one last time!
