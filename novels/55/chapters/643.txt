Chapter 644: Submission

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

The people from the Devil Sealing Immortal Sect had a drastic mixed expression as they fixed their eyes hard on Wang Xian.

He had asked them, the people from Xia Cauldron, to kneel.

The feeling and humiliation of asking them to kneel seemed like they were some beggars or slaves.

They had come to this real world, and they had been overlooking the people in this world, just like ants.

Now the ant who they had always regarded as such was asking them to kneel. Prideful as they were, they found it hard to accept it!

Sensing the frightful water energy around them, the middle-aged man in the center bellowed at Wang Xian with fear in his eyes, “You’re half-step to Immortal, or...”

“Ants, your time is up!”

Wang Xian looked at the fourteen people who were altering their facial expressions. With coldness flashing in Wang Xian’s eyes, he placed his palms together while the water swords in the air whizzed downward.

“How dare you. We’re the disciples of Devil Sealing Immortal Sect. If you dare to kill us, our Immortal Sect will not let you off when the Xia Cauldron descends into the real world. The Immortal experts will be after you!”

Trepidation flashed in a young man’s eyes as he exclaimed loudly in a harsh tone.

“Don’t think too highly of yourself. You guys aren’t Immortals!”

Wang Xian swept a cold gaze at that young man while the daunting water swords in the air exploded into endless streams of water swords sweeping into their faces.

“Kill!”

The middle-aged man was horrified as he let out a loud roar.

“I’ll make you kneel today!”

A hint of contempt flashed in Wang Xian’s eyes. With a thought, five Level 12 spiritual swords appeared around them, slashing at the group right away.

Given Wang Xian’s current strength, killing a Budding Realm was effortless even in his humanoid state.

Five spiritual swords that were exuding immense water energy struck at them, along with those endless water swords besieging them.

“Ah, no!”

As the spiritual swords whizzed over, a middle-aged lowered his head in fear. Their legs were already separated from their bodies at this moment!

“No, I surrender. I will kneel!”

Sensing the pain from his left leg, the middle-aged man looked down with horror in his eyes as he fell to his knees.

His strength was unstoppable!

They didn’t have the slightest ability to resist it.

This struck a deep sense of defeat and fear into them. How could there be such a domineering person in this real world?

Everyone was bitter when they thought of the evaluation they’d made of the Dragon King of the Underworld.

“I surrender!”

“I surrender!”

One by one, the experts from Devil Sealing Immortal Sect knelt in consternation as they shouted.

“That’s right. What were you waiting for?”

Wang Xian scorned them nonchalantly before he looked over to the Wandering Groups. “How about you guys? Needless to say...”

“We surrender! We surrender!”

The leaders of the Wandering Groups hurriedly exclaimed at the top of their lungs.

They had already submitted themselves to the fifteen daunting experts just now. Why would they not surrender now?

“Get them to explain the situation in Xia Cauldron world. Also, the battle techniques they are cultivating and the application of the demonic aura. These will be of great use to you guys!”

Wang Xian spoke to Mo Qinglong behind him.

“Yes, Dragon King!”

Mo Qinglong nodded as he headed slowly to the experts of Devil Sealing Immortal Sect, staring at them over their heads.

As though God had descended to the world, they were shaking and were left with only despair when they saw Wang Xian.

“Speak up!” Mo Qinglong commanded them coldly.

Looking at Mo Qinglong, the group of people clenched their fists while the middle-aged man in the center began his account with a dreadful look.

Wang Xian peered over and walked toward the merman.

[Merman: Level 9]

“A merman at Level 9 is far too weak!”

Wang Xian sized up the merman. It was no different from human body size, and somewhat took the shape of a human. It was wrapped in a skin that was grim looking.

“What do you mean by the awakening of the merman!?”

Wang Xian asked this plainly while his voice was ringing in the ears of the people from Devil Sealing Immortal Sect.

They took a deep breath with a serious look.

“We’re not sure of the specifics. But according to records, mermen are rather mystical creatures in the ocean. They are ugly and weak before they are awakened. After they awake, they possess striking appearances and great talents.”

A middle-aged man explained it to Wang Xian with a sullen face.

“Oh? How do we wake them up?” asked Wang Xian curiously.

“Feed it Spiritual Grass and flesh. The more well-fed they are, the stronger they will become after awakening. In addition, they will have intelligence and their own inheritance!”

The middle-aged man continued to answer.

“I see.”

Wang Xian nodded gently and turned to the Wandering Groups.

“Those who are Half-Step to Dan Realm and above, get over here!”

“Yes, Sir!”

The group of the Wandering Groups’ experts quivered before they stood up and humbled themselves before Wang Xian.

“8 Budding Realm, 23 Dan Realm, and 50 Half-Step to Dan Realm experts. This is just right to boost the strength of Dragon Sect!”

Wang Xian exhibited a satisfied look. He waved his palm, and drops of Blood Essence appeared on it.

“Take this and do not resist. Otherwise, you’re dead!”

As Wang Xian spoke emotionlessly, the drops of Blood Essence hovered over to them.

“Yes!”

Upon seeing the golden drops of Blood Essence, the experts of the Wandering Groups were having different thoughts. They knew that the outcome would be disastrous if they did not resist it.

However, if they did, they would die.

They might be maniacs, but none of them wanted to die.

“Back then, no other denominations could have me controlled!”

Radiance flickered in one of the leaders’ eyes as he absorbed the Blood Essence.

Buzz!

When the Blood Essence entered their minds, a scary thought was formed inside them.

Their eyes were surging with a hysterical look, staring at Wang Xian passionately.

“Greetings to the Dragon King!”

They yelled with eighty-one Wandering Groups’ experts kneeling uniformly before Wang Xian, like passionate believers.

“This...”

The group of Devil Sealing Immortal Sect disciples turned around in disbelief as they stared at the fanatic Wandering Groups.

“They are being controlled! What kind of means is this to control their minds?” the middle-aged man murmured with shock as he looked aghast.

“Are you going to control us too?”

The middle-aged man was shocked as he shuddered. They came to this world only to become slaves to someone else in the end.

They were not even subordinates, but slaves with no minds of their own!

All the surrounding members were horrified by what they saw. They lowered their heads in trepidation.

“Dragon King, we got all the information!”

About ten minutes later, Mo Qinglong came to Wang Xian and reported.

“Okay, since we got what we wanted, then just...”

Wang Xian looked at those Devil Sealing Immortal Sect people.

“Are you going to control us too?” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

The experts from Devil Sealing Immortal Sect were terrified.

“Just kill them all!” said Wang Xian indifferently.
