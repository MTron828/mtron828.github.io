Chapter 1328: 1329 versus the fourth-level of the void interpretation stage

“What is Wang Xian talking about? He wants to destroy the entire cold sect. This... this...”

“The nameless sword demon is not afraid of the cold sect at all. Moreover, from their conversation, the sect master of the cold sect had fought with the nameless sword demon before. Clearly, there was no victor!”

“How strong is the nameless sword demon? He is only 26 years old this year and he is able to fight against a fourth-level of the void interpretation stage. How are we supposed to survive?”

Everyone around heard Wang Xian’s words, “I didn’t kill all of you last time. This time, I will exterminate everyone in your cold sect.”.

There was an uproar!

Shock!

Initially, everyone thought that the second prince, Long Xiaotian, was at the end of his rope and the eighth prince had risen to power. However, no one expected that.

The Wang Xian who wanted to help the second prince ascend to the position of crown prince actually had another identity, the nameless sword demon.

One of them was a young and invincible expert who had fought with the sect master of the Frost sect in the main hall.

The strength displayed by the eighth Prince had already shocked many people. Now, the strength and boldness displayed by Wang Xian was even more admirable.

He did not lose out to the sect master of the thousand-year-old Frost sect.

“What an arrogant brat. You Dare to kill the people of our Frost sect. Don’t even think about escaping today!”

The sect master of the cold sect stared at Wang Xian with a face full of killing intent as he said coldly.

“Kill him. Kill him for me. I must kill him today no matter what!”

“No matter who he is, I must kill him!”

Behind the sect master of the cold sect, the eighth Prince Long Xiaoyun shouted loudly while staring at Wang Xian with a ferocious expression.

At this moment, he was extremely furious.

In the past, he was forced to enter the origin light dragon pool because of him. Fortunately, he obtained a huge inheritance and saved the elders of Frost sect who had been trapped in the origin light dragon pool for 2,000 years.

He initially thought that with his inheritance and strength, he would be able to dominate the younger generation in the flowing sea region and become a well-deserved Peerless Heaven’s favorite.

However, he did not expect that the nameless sword demon would be the one who caused him to die tragically in the past.

Now that he was defeated so easily, he was furious from embarrassment.

He had to die!

“Don’t worry, young master. He must die today!”

The sect master of the Frost sect stared at Wang Xian with murderous eyes and said coldly.

On the stage, the king of the light dragon dynasty frowned slightly when he saw his eighth son’s hateful gaze.

“I really didn’t expect that Xiao Yun would be able to obtain such an opportunity. I also didn’t expect that Xiao Tian would meet such a powerful brother!”

He muttered to himself and then fell silent. He did not stop Xiao Yun.

The important ministers and generals of the Light Dragon dynasty also watched quietly.

No one had expected that the competition for the crown prince this time would reach such a stage.

“However, the one who will ultimately obtain the position of crown prince is still the eighth Prince!”

Everyone in the Light Dragon Dynasty thought to themselves.

Firstly, the eighth prince was too strong. He was at the third level of the Seethrough Void Tier. With his strength alone, the position of the Crown Prince would be his.

Not to mention the Frost sect.

It would be difficult for the nameless sword demon to deal with the entire Frost sect!

“Today, I will destroy your frost sect!”

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered. His gaze swept across everyone from the Frost sect and paused on a skinny old man.

Finally, he swept his gaze across Long Xiaoyun as a hint of coldness appeared on his face.

His body trembled as he opened his mouth slightly. The five elements millstone was slowly floating in front of him.

Buzz

The sect master of the cold sect stared at the five elements millstone in front of Wang Xian with a hint of vigilance in his eyes.

At that time, although he had a simple exchange with Wang Xian, the five elements millstone had left a deep impression on him.

He shook his hands and a long sword crossed with a staff, producing a dull sound.

“Who would have thought that the selection for the position of the Crown Prince of the Light Dragon Dynasty would trigger a battle between a fourth-level void interpretation stage powerhouse. This is too crazy!”

All the people who came to watch the ceremony and the two people who were preparing for the battle were in a daze.

“Today, I will kill you on behalf of the Young Master!”

The sect master of the frigid sect raised his long sword and staff with both hands. The entire world seemed to have frozen in an instant.

The temperature dropped by a few hundred degrees.

“Hehe!”

Wang Xian laughed coldly. With a wave of his arm, the five elements millstone was directly suspended in the sky.

Boom

In an instant, the five elements millstone became a radius of two kilometers.

The five elements millstone within a radius of two kilometers directly covered the entire sky.

Buzz

An invisible energy directly teleported long Xiaotian out to avoid accidental injuries.

Boom! Boom! Boom

The Moment Long Xiaotian was teleported out, the five divine dragons on the five elements millstone began to gallop slowly.

“Not good!”

The white-haired elder from the Light Dragon Empire’s expression changed slightly when he saw Wang Xian ignoring the other princes.

He moved his body and flew over directly. A wave of energy pulled long Xiaochen and the other princes out of the battle area.

“Damn it, this damn fellow!”

Long Xiaochen and the rest, who were in a state of shock and uncertainty, had ugly expressions on their faces. When they felt the energy of the five elements millstone in the sky, they felt a wave of fear in their hearts.

“Five elements Millstone, Crush!”

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

Wang Xian shouted loudly. The power of the Five Elements Millstone was truly activated.

The terrifying power directly crushed the area below.

“Ice Seal for ten thousand miles!”

“Ice God’s Domain!”

As he felt the terrifying power in the sky, the sect master of the frigid sect roared with a solemn expression.

A vast white space was formed around him. Countless ice seals were blasted towards the five elements millstone in the sky.

“Explode!”

Wang Xian shouted softly. His gaze focused as the five divine dragons on the five elements grinding mill revolved.

Below him, it was as though the world was about to be destroyed.

Boom! Boom! Boom

The sound of the explosion caused even the surrounding air to be destroyed.

Countless ice seals collapsed in this chaotic space.

“What? Your strength is much stronger than back then!”

Seeing the ice seal for thousands of miles and the ice god domain exploding in the chaotic space, sect master Han Zong’s expression changed slightly.

“Dharma Idol: The Ice Mountain has descended!”

He roared and a mountain peak of about 2,000 meters appeared in the sky.

He stared at the five elements millstone with a cold gaze and gritted his teeth. “Ram!”

The 2,000-meter-sized ice mountain crashed towards the 2,000-meter-sized five elements millstone.

“Humph, frigidsect, I will destroy all of you today!”

Wang Xian’s eyes were as sharp as a torch. With a leap, he instantly appeared below the five elements Millstone.

“Five elements millstone, the five elements are born together. Rotate, Ram!” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

He stood below the five elements millstone and raised both of his hands.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

Above the Five Elements Millstone, the divine dragon that was formed from the Five Elements Dragon Pearl let out a roar that shook the sky.

It ran clockwise, and the five elements interacted with each other. The five types of energy began to spin violently.

On the other side, the sect master of the frigid sect stood on top of the Dharma Idol Iceberg. He stared at Wang Xian with a dignified gaze.

A collision between a fourth-level void interpretation stage powerhouse!
