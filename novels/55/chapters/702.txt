“Ah, ah, ah, ah, I’m not reconciled. If I had known, I would have killed all of you even if I was seriously injured!”

Mournful voices came from the sky above the island.

“They’re dead, they’re dead. Lord Snow Monster and Lord Blood Arrow are both dead!”

“Under the siege of six immortal gods, the two lords can not escape at all. The enemies they provoked are too terrifying!”

“Let’s leave as well. Let’s leave this place as soon as possible!”

When the sorrowful and indignant voice resonated, the faces of the two million people who were escaping below were filled with fear. They turned around and took a glance before continuing to flee.

“HMPH!”

Wang Xian snorted coldly at them. With a wave of his arm, he threw the snow demon and Blood Arrow, the two celestials who were on the verge of death, onto the ground and stared at them coldly.

“Courting Death!”

With a wave of his arm, two water swords pierced through his head.

The two interspatial rings flew into Wang Xian’s hands. He opened them and looked at them with a satisfied expression on his face.

The two interspatial rings were much bigger than the ones he had on his hands.

There were many metal materials in the space with a radius of 2,000 meters.

Apart from that, there were four to five grade-8 spiritual herbs.

Grade-8 spiritual herbs were very useful to demigods.

In addition, there were six grade-13 spiritual weapons in their interspatial rings.

Two spiritual swords with water energy, three staffs, and one armor.

“Jade Hand Immortal sect’s combat technique, corpse chief sect’s combat technique!”

Wang Xian looked at the two pitch-black books and the combat technique’s projection. His eyes revealed a hint of surprise.

These battle techniques could allow the demon monkey to train for a while. To the members of the Dragon Palace, they would be of great use.

“Put the two corpses away. This immortal God has treasures all over his body!”

A smile appeared on Wang Xian’s face. The level-13 materials were already more than ten tons.

“Most of the treasures in the entire Ding Yu world might be among the two of them!”

Wang Xian raised his head and looked at the star guide disc in the sky.

His body moved and came to the side of the star guide disc.

Star Guide Disc: Extraordinaire

Function: set up a training ground in the starry sky.

Consumable item: can be used 0 times

When Wang Xian saw the information of the star guide disc, he was stunned.

“What’s going on? The level, the level has actually become extraordinaire. What is extraordinaire?”

Wang Xian’s face was filled with astonishment. extraordinary. This was the first time he had heard of such a level.

“Extraordinary. Could it be the realm of Immortals? or? It’s even higher than the realm of Immortals?” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“That’s not right. With my current strength, I haven’t even completed the first transformation of the Divine Dragon Transformation. The level of immortals is merely the title of Earth’s martial artists. In terms of the cultivation level in the universe, there might be another title!”

“As for transcendence, it is very likely to be the title of the existence after the Celestial Being!”

Wang Xian guessed in his heart.

Currently, although his realm was called the Celestial Being, he knew that compared to the legendary immortal beings, they could not be called gods.

The lifespan of the celestial beings on Earth was less than 500 years.

“Forget it, let’s not think about it. This transcendence realm is obviously not the division of realms on Earth!”

Wang Xian shook his head and stopped thinking about this distant problem.

“Search for any treasures in the mountain peak and take them all!”

Wang Xian stretched out his hand and took the star guiding disc in his hand.

The star guiding disc had already been activated. It would only dissipate automatically after it was used up.

“Dragon King, there are some spiritual herbs in the herb garden. I plan to take the entire herb garden with me!”

“Other than the herb garden, we found a large number of corpses inside. Many of them were the corpses of infant stage powerhouses. They were used to refine puppets. These can be used as nutrients for the Dragon Pond!”

Prime Minister Gui’s voice came from below.

“Alright, take them all away. Let’s go back!”

Wang Xian held the star ushers and said to them.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Prime Minister Gui nodded. With a wave of his arm, a medicinal garden with a radius of two kilometers flew into the air and was supported by his earthy yellow energy.

“Let’s Go!”

The group of people moved and flew towards the Dragon Palace at a terrifying speed.

At this point, the world of the cauldron of Yu disappeared from the world as soon as it appeared.

In the future, the martial arts world would become the legend of the world without the cauldron of Yu.

The cauldron of Yu was destined to become the only world in the Nine Cauldrons world where the Immortal God was destroyed, top-notch experts were killed, and a group of immortal sect disciples escaped.

A terrifying world expert had disappeared.

What replaced it was the even more powerful Dragon Palace.

“Huala!”

When Wang Xian came to the surroundings of the Dragon Palace, he looked around with a face full of astonishment.

Around him, a terrifying kun that was about 80 meters long was slowly wandering in the sky.

Other than this terrifying kun, there were all kinds of aquatic creatures that were cultivating around the Dragon Palace.

The turtles that were standing upright in the water had eyes that were filled with wisdom.

They were holding a book in their hands as they explained to the surrounding aquatic creatures.

Those aquatic creatures that had gained wisdom, especially those that looked like five or six-year-old children, were respectfully listening to the teachings of these turtles. 1

Wang Xian swept his gaze over and discovered that the strength of many aquatic creatures had already reached the level of a martial artist of level seven or eight. This surprised him slightly.

“Dragon King, the spiritual energy waterfall this time has greatly increased the strength of many aquatic creatures. It has also allowed more than 200 aquatic creatures to pass through the Dragon Gate!”

Prime Minister Gui looked at the situation around him and said to him with a smile.

“Okay!”

Wang Xian nodded his head and entered the Dragon Palace.

Some of the members of the Dragon Palace were learning some knowledge while others were cultivating. The entire Dragon Palace was in good order.

“Let’s place the star guiding disc at the top of the Dragon Palace first. The cultivation speed in the Dragon Palace should be able to increase tremendously!”

Wang Xian moved his body and arrived at the top of the ocean-pacifying needle. He placed the star guiding disc on it.

In an instant, the star guiding disc covered an area of five kilometers.

The dense spiritual energy instantly caused streams of white spiritual energy to appear in the entire Dragon Palace.

“The energy of the star guiding disc can actually stack with the spiritual energy of the Dragon Palace. In other words, the spiritual energy in the Dragon Palace is about twenty times more than the spiritual energy in the outside world!”

Wang Xian’s eyes revealed a hint of heat.

Ring, Ring, Ring

Suddenly, the sound of a zither from the soul entered his ears. He was slightly stunned and looked towards the location of the Dragon King’s bedroom.

His heart skipped a beat as he sensed the situation inside. A smile appeared on his face.

“It’s true. I didn’t realize that I Was Here!”

Wang Xian moved his body and came to the bedroom. He said with slight dissatisfaction.

“Shh!”

However, what he didn’t expect was that Xiao Yu and Lan Qingyue glared at him when they heard his voice. They sat quietly on the bed and looked at Tang Yinxuan who was playing the zither.

Wang Xian wasn’t in the mood to listen to the zither. He wanted to check on the development of the Dragon Palace and flew out of the bedroom.

As he felt the majestic spiritual energy in the Dragon Palace, Wang Xian decided that no matter how the outside world changed, he would cultivate in the Dragon Palace for a year first.
