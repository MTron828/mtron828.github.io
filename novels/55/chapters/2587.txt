2588 Under the fury of the 2588 Heavenly Mountain Sword sect

“Lord Sword King, it’s almost 100% certain that the video wasn’t tampered with. With grandmaster Fa Xuan’s confirmation, there’s no doubt about it!”

In front of the entrance of the Abyss, another elder said with a cold expression!

At the beginning, they had suspected that the ninth-grade heaven sect had deliberately set up a conflict between them and the Dragon Palace to take advantage of them or drag them into the water!

Now, they were almost certain!

“Dragon King of the Dragon Palace, how dare he!”

The Sword King looked like a brutal blood sword with a grim face!

“Get the disciples of the Sky Mountain Sword sect ready immediately. We will start a war with the Dragon Palace. We will make the blood of the Dragon Palace pay tribute to the disciples of the Sky Mountain Sword sect!”

He growled in a low voice!

“Yes!”

The experts of the Sky Mountain Sword sect nodded heavily!

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

However, at this moment, a vast figure streaked across a long river and flew toward them!

The leader of the ninth-grade sky sect, the leaders of the four major forces, and their eyes were filled with excitement and killing intent at this moment!

When they received the news, it was undoubtedly a great benefit to them!

“Sword King!”

The group of people flew over. The leader of the ninth-grade sky sect slightly curled his lips and shouted at them!

“Sect master Yu, you guys are very well-informed!”

The Sword King looked at the group of ninth-grade sky sect people and said indifferently!

“Hehe, our five great factions have been sending people to guard this place. We are also a little surprised that we have an ally like the Sky Mountain Sword sect!”

The ninth-grade sky sect master said with a smile on his face, his eyes sweeping over the experts of the Sky Mountain Sword sect!

“We didn’t expect that Dragon King of the Dragon Palace would be so reckless!”

The Sword King said coldly!

“Since they are reckless, we will make their lives worse than death. Sword King, how about it? When do we make our move?”

The ninth-grade sky sect master asked indifferently!

“Destroy all the forces related to the Dragon Palace immediately!”

The Sword King said with a murderous look!

“Okay, but the most important thing for us is the Dragon Star. As long as we can destroy the dragon star, we can completely destroy the Dragon Palace!”

“Last time, we were defeated. But if you guys from the Sky Mountain Sword sect join us, I’m 80% Sure!”

The sect master of the ninth-grade sky sect said with a face full of killing intent!

“Okay, go back immediately and destroy the Dragon Palace!”

“We’ll come to you later!”

The sword king immediately nodded and his figure slowly became illusory!

Behind him, a group of experts from the Sky Mountain Sword sect cupped their hands toward the sect master of the ninth-grade sky sect and left immediately!

“Hahaha, with the five major forces and the Sky Mountain Sword sect, such a force can completely sweep across the entire southern star system. Now, destroying a dragon palace is absolutely easy!”

Seeing the Sky Mountain Sword sect leave, the leader of the three seas sect couldn’t help but smile hideously!

“This time, I will make the Dragon Palace bleed like a river!”

His face was a bit crazy!

“Let’s go. Get Ready. This time, the Dragon Palace will pay a thousand times the price!”

The experts of the Jianhua Group and the Black Forest Group also roared in low voices!

It was time for revenge!

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

The group moved and immediately flew toward the center of the star South Galaxy!

This time, it was time for the Dragon Palace to be destroyed!

They had offended six of the top forces in the star South Galaxy!

Two of them were top forces!

“Immediately announce to the world that the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace killed the elders and disciples of the Sky Mountain Sword sect. We will make them pay with blood and let them bleed for hundreds of millions of miles!”

At the same time, in the Sky Mountain Sword sect, the sword king flew from the divine kingdom to the Star Hall of the Sky Mountain Sword sect and immediately ordered loudly!

His voice spread all around! Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

“What? The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace has killed an expert of our Sky Mountain Sword sect. How dare he kill a member of Our Sky Mountain Sword sect!”

“Is the Dragon King courting death? How dare he offend US after offending the Ninth-grade Sky Sect?”

“Kill! Blood shall be repaid in blood! This Dragon King of the Dragon Palace is simply too arrogant! Kill them all, not a single one shall be spared!”

Within the radius of the hall, all the Sky Mountain Sword sect warriors who heard the voice of the sword king were slightly stunned. Following which, anger appeared on their faces as they roared with killing intent!

...

One by one, the Sky Mountain Sword sect warriors swiftly flew towards the location of the Hall!

“Hiss, my God, look at the announcement of the Sky Mountain Sword sect! Look at the announcement of the Sky Mountain Sword sect!”

“The Sky Mountain Sword sect has announced that the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace has killed two elders of the Sky Mountain Sword sect and more than a hundred undying godly monarchs. The Sky Mountain Sword sect will make the Dragon Palace pay with blood, and blood will flow for thousands of miles!”

“Hiss, what’s going on? Why did the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace offend the Sky Mountain Sword sect all of a sudden? He actually killed so many powerful warriors of the Sky Mountain Sword sect!”

“The Sky Mountain Sword sect has announced that they will destroy the Dragon Palace. My God, the Dragon Palace is already enemies with the five big forces, and now there’s another Sky Mountain Sword sect!”

“Are the Dragon Palace courting death? How did they offend the Sky Mountain Sword sect again? It’s over!”

“This... this is simply too shocking. The Sky Mountain Sword sect has also joined in!”

When everyone saw the information about the Sky Mountain Sword sect, their faces were filled with incomparable shock!

The Dragon Palace had already offended the five major forces. Now, although they had blocked their attacks, they were still a sword hanging from a beam. Who knew when they would fall!

Now, the Sky Mountain Sword sect had announced that they were going to destroy the Dragon Palace. This...

How could the Dragon Palace resist the two major forces in the entire southern star system?

...

Even if they had the dragon star, they couldn’t resist the attack of so many forces!

The entire southern star system was in an uproar when they saw this news!

“Prime Minister Gui, it’s bad. The Dragon King and the others have provoked the Sky Mountain Sword sect. Now, the Sky Mountain Sword sect must have joined hands with the ninth-grade sky sect. What should we do then?”

When the Tiger Chaos Demon Country received the news, their faces were instantly covered in cold sweat. They entered the Dragon Palace and immediately said to Prime Minister Gui!

“I haven’t contacted the Dragon King yet!”

When Prime Minister Gui saw the news, his face also revealed a serious expression!

The Sky Mountain Sword Sect’s strength wasn’t any weaker than the ninth grade sky sect. In fact, in terms of reputation, the Sky Mountain Sword sect was even stronger!

The Sword King of the Sky Mountain Sword sect had once slashed a level 7 undying fighter and severely injured him, destroying his stars with a single sword!

Over a hundred thousand years ago, the sword king had destroyed more than a hundred stars with a single sword. His strength was extremely terrifying!

Similarly, it was extremely cold and cruel!

Now, the strength of the Dragon Palace had to rely on the array formation of the sky array when facing a ninth-grade sky sect. Now, with the addition of the Sky Mountain Sword sect, it was even more troublesome!

“Chaotic tiger country leader, bring all the core disciples of your chaotic Tiger Demon Country to Dragon Star. Give up on the other planets and scatter and hide!”

Prime Minister Gui said with an ugly expression!

“Prime Minister Gui, can dragon star withstand the attacks of two top powers? Can it withstand the attacks of seven or eight undying godly monarchs?”

Chaotic Tiger Country Leader asked with an ugly expression!

“No problem, let your sky demons enter First!”

Prime Minister Gui said solemnly!
