Chapter 156: Nine Dragons Royal Carriage

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

“Surrender or die!”

Wang Xian swayed his body and covered it with his dragon might while looking coldly at the nine venomous sea snakes.

The nine venomous sea snakes gathered together and looked at Wang Xian in horror.

As they had the bloodline of the divine dragon, Wang Xian had an innate advantage against them. However, Wang Xian’s level was too low and he was too weak. Therefore, the nine venomous sea snakes had wanted to devour Wang Xian initially.

After suffering grave injuries and in the face of a real dragon, they were shivering in fear.

“Surrender or die!”

Wang Xian lifted his dragon claws and repeated himself.

“We surrender!”

Under Wang Xian’s might, the venomous sea snakes lowered their heads and replied.

“Absorb these!”

Wang Xian threw out drops of divine dragon blood essence onto the heads of the nine venomous sea snakes.

The eyes of the nine venomous sea snakes lit up when they saw the blood essence. However, they were also hesitating.

Looking at the mighty Wang Xian, they chose to absorb the essence blood eventually.

Wang Xian revealed a satisfied smile.

These nine venomous sea snakes had the bloodline of the Wind Divine Dragon and could be considered as rare existences.

Only the venomous sea snakes had the bloodline of the Wind Divine Dragon and had preserved their evolution path. Their bloodlines were extremely pure.

However, it wouldn’t be easy for them to eventually evolve into the Wind Divine Dragon.

To evolve into a dragon, they required thousands of years of cultivation. If they did not have any great chance encounters, it would be hard for them to become Wind Divine Dragons.

However, the paths of these nine venomous sea snakes would undoubtedly be smoother after Wang Xian imparted them the cultivation arts of the Wind Divine Dragon.

As long as they cultivated diligently, there would be a day where they made the leap through the dragon gate and evolved into a divine dragon.

“Looking at the looks of these nine venomous sea snakes, they should be able to evolve into serpents soon!”

Wang Xian’s eyes lit up as he stared at these nine venomous sea snakes. From the first time he saw them, he had an idea in mind.

Nine dragons royal carriage!

That’s right. It would be to take the nine dragons royal carriage as he went on a supervision trip around the world!

The thought of nine divine dragons... No... Even if it was just nine serpents flying in the air pulling the throne, that would be an awe-inspiring moment.

Wang Xian’s eyes were burning with passion as he stared at these nine venomous sea snakes. As he waved his dragon claws, dense wood attribute energy entered their bodies, treating their wounds.

“Thank you, Dragon King!”

The injuries on the nine venomous sea snakes recovered gradually. They remained at the bottom of the lake and bowed down respectfully.

“Alright, rest well over the next few days. I’ll be bringing you to the seas after that.”

Wang Xian looked at them.

“Yes, Dragon King!”

The nine venomous sea snakes nodded their heads.

“Cultivate diligently!”

Wang Xian took another glance at them before swimming back into the lake.

Wang Xian was exceptionally satisfied to be able to subdue these nine subordinates from Lake Xianfeng for this trip.

These nine venomous sea snakes were even more important than a group of devil monkeys.

Within the entire group of devil monkeys, only Roving Heavens could possibly match the nine venomous sea snakes. The rest of them wouldn’t be a match.

Splash!

Flying out from the lake, Wang Xian put on his underwear before getting into his room quickly.

I’ve got to get some clothing equipment in the future. Otherwise, it will be too troublesome to remove my clothes when turning into a dragon. It would be best if I could get celestial equipment that could freely change its size, Wang Xian thought to himself. Seeing that it was 11 pm, he went to bed without thinking further.

“Brother, time to get up!”

The next day morning, Xiao Yu tried to wake Wang Xian up early in the morning.

“Brother, let’s go. Sister Li is holding a wedding banquet in a hotel in the city!”

“A hotel in the city? Are we going that far? Can’t they do it within the county?”

Wang Xian changed into his clothes quickly while looking at Xiao Yu with doubtful eyes.

“This is a decision by Sister Li’s husband. He said that it will look grandiose if it is done in the city and he wanted to marry Sister Li in a grand way. Uncle Zhang has the same view too. They have given a dowry of $580,000 and it should be enough,” Xiao Yu explained.

“Hmm. Alright then. Let’s head to Uncle Zhang’s house.

Wang Xian and Xiao Yu went over to Uncle Zhang’s house. There were quite a few people in the yard when they arrived.

They were all people who were managing different aspects of the county. For example, someone who held a role similar to the village chief and there was also someone responsible for collecting and managing their common funds.

“Hey, Xiao Xian and Xiao Yu! You guys are here!”

When the crowd saw them, they quickly greeted. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Wang Xian smiled and returned the greetings. He looked to Uncle Zhang and asked, “Uncle Zhang, is there anything I can help with?”

“Nothing, nothing! Oh right, I heard that you got a car. Can you send Sister Li and Aunt Zhang to the hotel in a while? I’ll inform the hotel about it.”

Uncle Zhang was going to be busy.

“Alright.” Wang Xian nodded his head.

9 am. Sister Li and Aunt Zhang followed Wang Xian and Xiao Yu to the yard. When she saw the pink Bentley, she was filled with shock.

“Xiao Yu, this Bentley cost at least $4 million, right?”

“Yeah, my brother got it for me. However, they didn’t charge my brother for it!”

Xiao Yu chuckled.

“No charge?” Sister Li was confused.

“$4 million! Oh my gosh!” Aunt Zhang looked at the car in disbelief.

Xiao Yu opened the door and ushered the group in.

Aunt Zhang looked at the internal decorations of the car inquisitively.

“Sister Li, which hotel are we going to? Let me get the GPS set up!”

“Sanwen International Hotel!”

“Alright!”

Wang Xian sat beside the driver and the car drove out slowly.

The crowd that was gathered at the doorstep of Uncle Zhang’s house was shocked by what they had seen.

No one had expected the Wang siblings to be doing so well.

The journey lasted 30 minutes and the car arrived at the city center.

Sanwen International Hotel was a good hotel. Pengzhou was just a small county and didn’t have a five-star hotel.

The car stopped by the side. Aunt Zhang and Sister Li alighted and headed into the hotel.

“Why don’t you follow Sister Li and Aunt Zhang? I’ll go get some money,” Wang Xian said to Xiao Yu.

“Alright, brother.”

It was Sister Li’s wedding and Wang Xian naturally wanted to give some monetary gift. He withdrew $660,000 as it was an auspicious number.

When he got back to the hotel, Aunt Zhang and Sister Li had settled the matters in the hotel.

The hotel was big and could accommodate more than one wedding. Another family was hosting a wedding besides Sister Li today.

The entrance to the other wedding was decorated in a grand manner.

As for Sister Li’s side, they didn’t put up much decoration as they were simply inviting relatives and friends over for a meal and weren’t having any other ceremony.

When Wang Xian arrived at a temporary room in the hotel lobby, he saw Sister Li had changed into her wedding costume.

“Xiao Li, give Xiao Wei a call again. Ask him if he’s coming!” Aunt Zhang told Sister Li grumpily.

“Alright, mom!”

Sister Li nodded her head, took out a phone and dialled a number.

“Tell me! He isn’t even going to show up at the wedding. How am I going to face our relatives and friends in the future?”

Aunt Zhang grumbled. “It isn’t that our daughter has to marry into a rich family. It’s all because of their child’s action...”

“Aunt Zhang, calm down. A wedding should be a joyous event. When Sister Li heads to Rivertown, my brother and I will accompany Sister Li!”
