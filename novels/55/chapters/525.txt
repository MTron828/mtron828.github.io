Chapter 526: Trapped Beasts? Killing The Dragon?

“What terrifying auras. Is this the full strength of the Dragon Sect?”

“So powerful! Devil clouds are even coalescing over the sky. It’s no surprise they could annihilate the Remains! The Dragon Sect is indeed not simple!”

When the terrifying clout of aura moved rapidly towards them with the devil clouds above them, the crowd of Dong Hua Sacred Sect was astonished.

“This strength could easily annihilate all of us!”

The bald middle-aged man felt a chill run down his spine when he saw the Dragon Sect within a thousand meters of them.

“They are indeed strong and aren’t something we can withstand. It’s no surprise that Nie Wuya and the other three weren’t confident in keeping them behind on the day of the alliance of the orthodox sects!”

Old Zhou looked plainly at the approaching experts of the Dragon Sect. When he saw them stopping before him, he revealed a chilling smirk and shouted, “How arrogant of the Dragon Sect to barge into our Dong Hua Spiritual Ore Mine at this moment!”

Wang Xian and the dragonians stopped in the air a thousand meters away from them. They extended their wings and resembled terrifying devils from hell.

“It doesn’t matter the time, nor do we need to resort to ambushing to kill the people from the Dong Hua Sacred Sect. We are killing you guys here to send out a warning. Moreover, this is just the beginning!”

Wang Xian looked at the disciples of the Dong Hua Sacred Sect before him and spoke plainly.

“Arrogant and presumptuous!” Old Zhou stared emotionlessly at Wang Xian as he remarked, “You must be the Dragon King! Since you dare to be here today, you can rest here forever. This is an auspicious land after all!”

“Alright, we have no time to chat with you here. In nine minutes, the reinforcements of the Dong Hua Sacred Sect will be here!”

Wang Xian looked across the disciples of Dong Hua Sacred Sect as he shouted, “Killing you guys will be a reminder to the Dong Hua Sacred Sect that our Dragon Sect isn’t just kidding when we say we won’t rest till one party perishes!”

“Go!” Wang Xian instructed the dragonians behind him.

“Kill!” all the dragonians behind Wang Xian shouted. With immense killing intent overflowing, they charged towards Dong Hua Sacred Sect.

Tsk!

Seeing the disciples of the Dragon Sect charging towards him, Old Zhou turned cold as ice. The Inborn experts behind him also gave cold grins.

“Who would have expected the Dragon Sect to be made up of a bunch of fools?”

“Perhaps they are in over their heads after annihilating the Remains!”

When the Inborn experts of Dong Hua Sacred Sect witnessed what had transpired, they weren’t worried at all. Instead, they were grinning with contempt.

“Annihilating a foolish sect with five thousand spiritual stones. What a bad deal!”

Old Zhou looked emotionlessly at the group of Dragon Sect’s disciples charging ahead. He moved his arm and shouted, “Move back!”

“Move back!” the group of Inborn experts shouted as they retreated rapidly.

Screech, screech, screech!

The moment they retreated, the space within a span of five kilometers seemed to be distorting.

An invisible shield fell from the sky suddenly and shrouded the entire region.

The group of dragonians that had charged ahead was surprised.

“Attack!”

Mo Yuan’s expression turned solemn as his palm underwent a terrifying transformation.

A terrifying dragon claw appeared.

Behind him, the dragonians’ palms also underwent terrifying changes.

Bam! Bam! Bam!

Dragon claws attacked the invisible shield before them and terrifying destructive force fell upon it.

Unmoveable!

Unshakeable!

There were no ripples or any signs of movement when the attacks of the dragonians fell on it. This greatly shocked the dragonians.

“The disciples of the dragonians are really strong!”

When an expert from Dong Hua Sacred Sect saw the attacks from the dragonians, fear flashed in his eyes as he commented solemnly.

“So what? They are still trapped beasts now!” a middle-aged man standing by the side said with a faint smile.

“That’s true!” The old man grinned and looked at the disciples of the Dragon Sect with contempt. He commented, “They are strong but aren’t very intelligent!”

“Haha, that’s right. They are nothing compared to the scheming followers of Diabolism. If Diabolism had the same intelligence level as them, it would be great for us!”

“Come, shall we celebrate? Haha!”

When the disciples of the Dong Hua Sacred Sect saw the Dragon Sect being trapped within the spirit array, they smiled confidently. They stood outside the shield and constantly ridiculed them.

“What’s this? A spirit array of the legends?”

Looking at the transparent shield before him, Mo Yuan looked bitter. He looked across and shouted, “Attack!”

“Kill!”

The dragonians flapped their wings rapidly and charged towards the spirit array shield.

Rumble!

Terrifying forces that could even kill an ordinary Inborn expert fell on the spirit array shield, causing dull clashing sounds.

However, the shield wasn’t moved. There wasn’t even any sign of movement.

“Hehe! They must be dreaming to think they can destroy the spirit array!”

Strong contempt gleamed in the eyes of Old Zhou as he looked at the dragonians attacking the shield.

He felt ridiculed by the arrogance and conceit of the Dragon Sect.

Just today, he had heard about Nie Wuya and the rest being a little surprised by the Dragon King and being a little wary of the Dragon Sect. Now, it would seem like they were nothing.

“When the experts of our Dong Hua Sacred Sect are here, it will also be the time they will be killed!” An Inborn expert chuckled.

“Supreme Elder, the people of the Dragon Sect are so presumptuous to announce they won’t rest till one side perishes. Can I broadcast what’s happening here to the Underworld so the rest will know the consequences of going against us?”

“That’s a good idea. Let the whole Underworld know how the foolish Dragon Sect has been annihilated by us. Haha!” a disciple shouted excitedly.

Old Zhou, who was standing in the middle, smiled faintly and nodded his head. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Hehe!

When that middle-aged man saw the approval given by the Supreme Elder, he was beaming with excitement. He took out his phone, took a few pictures and entered the Underworld website.

[The insignificant Dragon Sect is just a pile of trash. They aren’t qualified to stand toe-to-toe with us. Today, we will be killing them off. They are now trapped beasts waiting to be slaughtered. In the future, there will be no Dragon Sect or Dragon King!]

The middle-aged man grinned as he uploaded the pictures he had taken to the Underworld website and started the thread.

He could already foresee the forces and martial artists of the Underworld being shocked by the news.

Just a day ago, the Dragon Sect had annihilated the Remains. This had shocked the entire Underworld as everyone was astonished by the strength of the Dragon Sect.

And today, the Dragon Sect would be annihilated by their Dong Hua Sacred Sect.

From here onwards, the status of their Dong Hua Sacred Sect would be unshakeable and no one would dare to challenge them.

The outcome of the Dragon Sect would be a great example of those who dared to offend Dong Hua Sacred Sect!

“They are now just trapped beasts! In the future, there will be no arrogant Dragon Sect or Dragon King!” Old Zhou smiled with contempt at the dragonians who were still attacking the spirit array!
