Chapter 920: 0921 shook the holy sea

Translator: 549690339

“Dragon Spike... Dragon Assassin organization, you...”

Xiu Qianshan stared at the red piece of paper floating in front of him, his eyes filled with fear.

An assassin organization had intimidated the entire holy sea town in just three days. It had even made the families of holy sea town put down their grudges and weapons and settle their conflicts.

It made many people feel terrified and uneasy all day long.

In just three days, there was no one they couldn’t kill. Even if it was a transcendent level 6 Powerhouse, two to three people had died at the hands of Long Ci!

No one knew how strong long CI was. However, the strength he displayed was definitely not something that the mirage sea mercenary group could afford to provoke.

“You are from the Dragon Thorns assassin organization? You Are...”

Xiu Qianshan’s body was trembling slightly. More than 30 of his subordinates were killed in an instant. The Dragon Thorns assassin organization had already instilled fear in him. His voice was trembling slightly.

“I am... the founder of the Dragon Thorns assassin organization!”

Wang Xian stared at Xiu Qianshan as he spoke slowly.

“How did this...”

“PFFT!”

Before he could finish his sentence, a claw pierced through his chest. His face instantly turned extremely pale.

“How did he have such a terrifying concealing ability? How could it be so terrifying?”

He was so stiff that he wanted to turn his head around to see what creature had killed him. However, the life force in his body quickly disappeared.

Wang Xian walked over slowly and kept the red piece of paper on the ground.

“Your men wanted to kill me. I killed your men, and then you came back for revenge. Hehe!”

Wang Xian looked at his corpse and shook his head mockingly.

“Use it as nourishment for the Dragon Pond!”

Wang Xian moved his arm and took out the interspatial ring from his hand. Ao Jian and the rest also took out the interspatial rings from the other thirty or so Mirage Sea members.

“Eh? There are so many elixirs. There are also quite a number of middle-grade spirit stones!”

Wang Xian’s face was filled with astonishment. He took a rough look. There were millions of middle-grade spirit stones and dozens of elixirs.

“It’s not bad for a five-star silver mercenary group to have such assets!”

Wang Xian kept the interspatial ring and looked at the interspatial rings of the rest.

As one of the top mercenary groups in Shenghai town, everyone had quite a lot of resources in their hands.

This was especially so for their weapons. The weapons in Xiu Qianshan’s hands were at transcendent level six. Their value was much higher than the transcendent level six pills.

The combined value of the spirit stones, pills, and weapons was close to three million middle-grade spirit stones.

Wang Xian kept them unhurriedly. Ao Yao and the rest hid in the void again.

With the cover of the trees, no one could see what was happening inside.

Wang Xian was not afraid that the strange demon would be exposed.

He kept all the corpses into his interspatial ring. With a wave of his arm, the surrounding trees turned into green dragon energy and entered his body.

The trees slowly disappeared.

At this moment, everyone’s eyes were fixed on this place from the outside.

When the trees that blocked their vision disappeared and when Wang Xian and the rest stood there, everyone was in an uproar.

“What? Where are the people from the Mirage Sea mercenary group?”

“Could it be? No... it can’t be. Xiu Qianshan and the rest were killed. How is this possible? He is an extraordinary level six powerhouse!”

“Oh my God, the Immortal Phoenix mercenary group actually destroyed the Mirage Sea mercenary group!”

Everyone’s faces were filled with shock. They widened their eyes and could not help but exclaim.

This was the Mirage Sea mercenary group, one of the top five mercenary groups in holy sea town. It had actually been annihilated.

However, the one who annihilated them was a newly emerged three-star silver mercenary group. A young man was the leader.

“Could it be that the young man has the strength of a transcendent rank 6? That’s impossible, right?”

“No, definitely not a transcendent sixth rank. From his combat strength just now, he isn’t that strong. He must have used some kind of weapon or array formation to wipe out the mirage sea mercenaries!”

“That must be it. There was no sound of attack from the area that was surrounded just now. They must have fallen into the array formation and then been killed!”

Everyone could not help but guess.

At this moment, most of the goldfish had been killed. In the distance, Dao Hen was even more excited as he killed one after another of the extraordinary level six goldfish.

The first wave of attacks from the ferocious beasts was about to end.

Wang Xian ignored the discussions of the people around him. He swept his gaze across the surroundings and saw that there were not many goldfish left. He stood there with a smile on his face.

Some of the people around him looked over intentionally or unintentionally. Their eyes were filled with respect.

An expert who was able to destroy the mirage sea mercenary group was worthy of their respect.

The strength of the Fairy Phoenix mercenary group could be ranked in the top five in Shenghai town.

“The first wave of the city defense mission has been completed. Everyone, return to the city immediately to rest and reorganize. Soon, the second wave of the ferocious beasts siege will begin!”

Under normal circumstances, the ferocious beasts attacking the city were controlled by the sea demonic beast race.

As they were all ferocious beasts, their intelligence was not very high. Therefore, when attacking the city, it was impossible for all the ferocious beasts to rush over at once.

If that was the case, before they reached the city wall, all the ferocious beasts would start to kill each other.

Therefore, the monsters attacking the city were carried out wave by wave.

The further they went, the higher the level of the monsters would be.

The first wave would have level six transcendents, and the second wave would definitely have level seven transcendents.

Wang Xian’s figure moved and flew into the city.

“Eh? The Mirage Sea mercenary group was destroyed by that Kid?”

At the last position, a group of more than a hundred people were floating in the air as they slowly flew into the city.

In the middle of these 100 people, Dao Hen was covered in blood. His single eye was emitting a threatening luster as he looked at a figure in front of him.

“It’s the leader. It’s their immortal Phoenix mercenary group that destroyed more than 40 experts of the Mirage Sea mercenary group!”

An elder beside him nodded.

“Hehe, I didn’t expect them to have some strength!”

Dao Hen’s single eye flashed with an unknown luster. He then narrowed his eyes and didn’t say anything.

On the city wall, everyone looked at the group of mercenary group members flying over with respect.

These were all the strongest members of the mercenary group in Holy Sea Town, especially the last one, Blade Scar mercenary group.

However, today, a mercenary group rose up.

The Immortal Phoenix mercenary group stepped on the corpse of the Mirage Sea mercenary group and directly stepped onto the peak.

Everyone looked at the young man who was a bit too excessive with respect.

He was the leader of a powerful mercenary group with terrifying strength. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Oh right, it seems that the leader was accepted by the Demon Hunters Academy with the first place result in Shenghai Town!”

“That’s right, it’s him. I remember that he even killed the daughter of the vice leader of the squalid shark mercenary group back then!”

“That’s right, it’s this young master. He’s really the new wave that has surpassed the new wave. I can’t help but admire him!”

Wang Xian and the rest landed on the city wall. The people around him immediately cleared a space and were very respectful.

Some of them even addressed Wang Xian as the leader and young master.

The battle today, whether it was killing the ferocious beasts or destroying the mirage sea mercenary group, had shocked everyone.

In the future, there would be one more mercenary group that would shock the entire Shenghai town.

The Celestial Phoenix mercenary group!
