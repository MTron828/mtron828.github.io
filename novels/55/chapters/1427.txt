Chapter 1428: 1428

“HMM?”

In the Dragon King’s Palace of the Dragon Palace, the ancestral tree was trembling gently. The branches of the tree were swaying gently.

Terrifying Life Force energy and starlight-like sparks landed on the body of the multi-colored algae demon beast.

“This... This Is?”

Wang Xian looked at this scene in astonishment. His face was filled with shock.

The Sparks landed on the body of the multi-colored algae demon beast, making it even more resplendent.

Waves of special energy were emitted from their bodies.

“Weng!”

At this moment, the Changshu on the ancestral tree also slowly floated. Waves of energy were suspended in the air above the fifteen hundred multi-colored algae demon beasts.

“Roar Roar!”

A low roar came from the mouth of the multi-colored algae demon beasts. Waves of emerald green energy slowly condensed into a branch in their bodies.

Two arms slowly appeared on the branch.

One of the arms was emerald green while the other arm was glowing red.

“Evolution? And it’s a dual-attribute!”

Wang Xian’s eyes were glowing. At this moment, he realized that the information about the multi-colored algae demon beast had undergone a huge change.

Starwood Dragon Seed!

The name had changed!

“The light-pricking dragon seed and the dark and light attributes are the strongest assassination dragon seed of the Dragon Palace. The fire-gold dragon seed has dual attributes. It’s the strongest forged dragon seed of the Dragon Palace...”

“This Starwood Dragon Seed is a dragon seed that evolved from the mysterious ancestral tree. Perhaps, it will become another peak dragon seed in the Dragon Palace!”

Wang Xian mumbled as excitement appeared on his face.

This was a pleasant surprise!

Boom! Boom! Boom

At this moment, waves of aura burst out from the bodies of the Starwood Divine Dragons.

They had a breakthrough!

At this moment, at least seven to eight hundred Starwood Dragon Species had a breakthrough in their cultivation.

Among them, what made Wang Xian even more surprised was that the leader of the colorful algae demonic beasts in the past had also achieved a breakthrough.

The powerful aura caused him to float slowly.

Compared to the past, his colorful body was like condensed seaweed.

The current him had a human-like head, a mahogany-like body, and two arms.

However, they still didn’t have legs. Their legs were like branches.

The former leader of the gorgeous algae demonic beasts was filled with excitement.

He bowed to the ancestral tree and immediately went to Wang Xian and knelt down.

“Thank you, Dragon King, for giving us the colorful algae species an opportunity to evolve into Starwood Dragon Species!”

After he finished his sentence, the rest of the Starwood Dragon species quickly knelt down and bowed.

“Get Up!”

Wang Xian revealed a smile and looked at the leader of the Starwood Dragon species. “In the future, I will bestow you with the name Ao Xingmu and lead your Starwood Dragon species in the future!”

“Thank you, Dragon King, for the name! Thank you, Dragon King!”

Ao Xingmu thanked him excitedly.

“Now that you have achieved a breakthrough in your strength, how many levels above you can you fight?”

Wang Xian looked at him and asked curiously.

A peak combat dragon species could fight two levels above them. If AO xingmu could fight two levels above him, he would be able to fight against an eighth level void interpretation.

This was a little terrifying. Even he was not his match!

“Dragon King, we can only fight one level above him. The fire elemental energy in our bodies can only be fully integrated and utilized when we become gods!”

“However, I should be able to kill a level seven Demon Beast of the Seethrough Realm Now!”

Ao Xingmu said to Wang Xian.

“Kill a level seven Demon Beast of the Seethrough Realm? That’s strong enough!”

Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled. He didn’t expect that the colorful algae demon beasts that forced him to join the Dragon Palace would bring him such a big surprise.

Of course, this was also really fragrant to the colorful algae demon beasts! Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Oh right, are there any level seven demon beasts of the Seethrough realm in the human-demon graveyard?”

A Ray of light flashed across Wang Xian’s mind. He narrowed his eyes slightly and asked Ao Xingmu.

“No. The strongest demonic beasts in the demi-human cemetery are demonic qilin and blood savage beasts. During this time of turmoil, another bloodthirsty sea demonic beast appeared. Among these three demonic beast races, there is only one at level six of the Seethrough Realm!”

“When the turmoil broke out, all the demonic beast races used up all their treasures to increase their strength. Currently, there are about six to seven demonic beasts at level six of the Seethrough realm. At most, there are less than ten of them!”

Ao Xingmu said.

“Then, if you bring all your subordinates over, do you have the confidence to become the king of the demonic beasts in the human-demon graveyard?”

Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled with a fiery glow.

“Dragon King, if I bring my clansmen back, I will definitely be able to wipe out all the demonic beasts and become their King!”

Ao Xingmu said confidently.

“Haha, Good, Good!”

Wang Xian’s eyes were filled with excitement. “Then, I will give you a task today. When the demonic beasts establish their dynasty, you will take the throne!”

“Yes, Dragon King. I promise to complete the task!”

Ao Xingmu replied immediately.

“Lady AO, bring the new members of the Dragon Palace around the Dragon Palace and rest for a few days. Then, we will return to the human-demon graveyard!”

Wang Xian said with a smile on his face.

With the appearance of Ao Xingmu, Wang Xian could now set up the entire Liuhai region.

The demonic beasts were in turmoil and wanted to establish a dynasty.

If he could control this dynasty, coupled with the power of the Dragon Palace, he could totally be invincible in the LIUHAI region.

At that time, even if it was the bloody dynasty, he could destroy it with a single sentence.

“Prime Minister Gui, call the leaders over later to talk about the future development of our Dragon Palace!”

Wang Xian said to Prime Minister Gui with a smile on his face.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Prime Minister Gui nodded with a smile.

For the next few days, Wang Xian stayed at the position of the Dragon Palace.

...

“Blood Emperor, it’s been more than two months. When are we going to settle the matter that you promised us?”

In the sky above a thousand-meter-tall palace in a cluster of palaces.

The interior of the palace was resplendent and resplendent, exuding a thick and luxurious aura.

The two old men looked at an old man with his back facing them and spoke with slight displeasure.

“There’s no need to be anxious, the blood flow empire will do as we promised. If it wasn’t for the chaos on the Demonic Beasts’side, your matter would have been resolved long ago!”

The old man with his back facing them slowly turned his head. His tall figure and square face were filled with dignity.

“We also know about the matter on the Demon Beasts’side, but...”

“The Demon Beast clan has gradually calmed down. I will also summon all the dynasties and forces in the Liuhai region to fight against the Demon Beasts!”

An old man was interrupted by the blood emperor as he spoke indifferently.

“Then... eh? Blood Emperor, what do you mean? When we summon all the forces here...”

As the old man spoke, he suddenly raised his eyebrows and asked with a smile on his face.

“I will definitely do what I promised you. However, I hope that the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop will stand on our side in the upcoming battle!”

“Haha, of course there won’t be any problems!”
