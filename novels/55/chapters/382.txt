Chapter 383: Top Of The Outstanding Young Heroes Chart

“What happened? To think the piercing rays of the Metal Element have stretched over an area of twenty meters in radius!” one gasped.

“It’s too petrifying. Is this the combat prowess above the Inborn level?” another squeaked.

All around, the crowd quivered at the endless stream of spine-chilling cries. The area, which was now concealed by the metallic sheen, had made it impossible for them to check out the combat situation inside.

Suddenly, the crowd was taken by storm.

As the golden sheen disappeared gradually, they began to peer in its direction.

Slowly, a figure emerged. It was a young man with a long sword in his hands, while the weapon was rooted upright into the ground.

Countless scratch marks marred the surrounding ground’s surface.

Alongside lay the corpse of the Miracle Doctor and Elder from the Sacred Followers Guild, together with several bodies of the Nine Lotus Sect experts. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“To think that one person can take down four Inborn experts!”

“Such formidable capabilities. So that’s the prowess of Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown? Simply wicked!” the crowd murmured at the sight, and looked on in disbelief.

A young man in his twenties, who was also a Miracle Doctor ranked ninth amongst all within the underworld, had such formidable powers to add. Singlehandedly, the young man had defeated all experts within the Nine Lotus Sect as well as the Elder and Miracle Doctor from the Sacred Followers Guild.

“Such an extraordinary gift is unrivalled and unprecedented, be it in the past or future. Even the first on the Outstanding Young Heroes Chart would pale very much in comparison!” the two elders from the Liuyun Family commented as they exchanged glances. Both of them could sense the intense astonishment from the other party.

Such a character was deemed to have unparalleled achievements, as though a dragon had managed to ascend to the highest of skies.

“Phew, flamboyant moves which expended too much energy, especially with my serious injuries, are gaudy and impractical!” Wang Xian commented while raising his head, before he pulled the Zhan Lu Sword out from the ground and looked around.

Ahem, ahem!

Ahem, ahem!

Just then, sounds of two coughing could be heard, as two silhouettes began to pick themselves up off the ground. It was the Sect Leader of the Nine Lotus Sect along with Elder Feng.

“They’re dead, to think that they’re all dead!” the Nine Lotus’ Sect Leader exclaimed with a dazed look. Up till now, he remained clueless as to why the young man had annihilated the Nine Lotus Sect.

This made him shudder.

As he raised his head to look Wang Xian in the eye, the Nine Lotus’ Sect Leader pleaded with a tinge of misery, “Can you tell me what feud you have with my Nine Lotus Sect?”

Upon hearing his words, Wang Xian let out a brief smile before he proceeded over and stared at the Nine Lotus’ Sect Leader.

“The poison which my little sister’s been struck with is affiliated with your Nine Lotus Sect!” Wang Xian replied apathetically as he pointed to Xiao Yu in the wheelchair.

“What?” the Nine Lotus’ Sect Leader gasped with eyes wide, shocked by the sight of Xiao Yu, who was wheelchair-bound.

This young maiden, based on his knowledge, was a disciple of a Second-class Force; and also the younger sister of a Miracle Doctor.

Earlier, he had agreed to the decision of his good friend, Elder Feng, when the latter suggested that Nine Lotus’ young master inject a poison into the young lady’s body when they were exchanging blows.

How could a Second-class Force compete with them, the Nine Lotus Sect?

How could a Miracle Doctor match up against the Elder of the Sacred Followers Guild?

From what he had seen, it was nothing more than the death of one on the spot.

He had not expected the elder brother of this young lady to actually be this terrifying.

Those formidable powers were definitely not of the Inborn realm, but at least a Half-step to Dan Realm. He dared not imagine it as any level beyond.

“You... What do you want?” the Nine Lotus’ Sect Leader asked in trepidation. With an awful expression, he wiped the fresh blood off his face.

“Haha, what do I want? Haven’t you seen it for yourself? I want...,” Wang Xian responded before he raised his Zhan Lu Sword, “not one surviving soul from your Nine Lotus Sect!”

Pfft!

“You...,” the Nine Lotus’ Sect Leader uttered. But, the Zhan Lu Sword came down on him even before he could continue. As he paused, he felt a sharp pain searing at his chest. With widened eyes, he eventually fell to the ground.

After withdrawing his Zhan Lu Sword, Wang Xian looked over at Elder Feng who stood to the side.

Elder Feng watched as the Nine Lotus’ Sect Leader was killed, and narrowed his eyes at the sight of the latter’s death. He gazed over at Wang Xian with a contorted look.

“The antidote is kept within the Sacred Followers Guild. If you let me go, I’ll give you the antidote. Otherwise, the poison in your little sister’s body can never be neutralized!” Elder Feng spoke to Wang Xian in a lowered pitch as his eyes glistened.

“Fang Huazi said that this poison does not come with an antidote, and even the Sect Leader of your Sacred Followers Guild is unable to neutralize it!” Wang Xian spoke flatly as he eyed Elder Feng.

Upon hearing this, Elder Feng’s face flinched. Despite which, he continued with an awful expression, “This poison comes with an antidote!”

“Regardless of this, you’ll have to die!” Wang Xian retorted. As he shot Elder Feng a look of disregard, he raised the Zhan Lu sword in his hand.

“What, you...,” Elder Feng uttered.

Pfft!

Wang Xian did not bear the slightest hesitation. Regardless of the antidote’s existence, he and Fang Huazi would have to die.

Should there be an antidote, he would stomp over to the Sacred Followers Guild and ask their leader for it.

Should there be none, those close to Fang Huazi shall perish with him.

“He really killed him. To think he really killed the Sacred Followers Guild Elder right on the spot!” one shrieked.

“Slaying the Elder of the Sacred Followers Guild. This is no doubt a slap in the face to the Sacred Sect. Justified or otherwise, the Sacred Followers Guild will have to seek revenge for Elder Feng!” another added.

“This Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown is really menacing, having killed four Inborn experts from the Nine Lotus Sect, as well as the Elder of Sacred Followers Guild. No one knows how things will develop from here. In the face of such a powerful existence, even the Sacred Followers Guild will have to treat this matter seriously!” the third chimed in.

Everyone continued to look on in astonishment, having witnessed the killing of the Nine Lotus’ Sect Leader and the Sacred Followers Guild Elder by Wang Xian.

With his long sword in hand, Wang Xian came over to the sides of the Nine Lotus’ young master and Fang Huazi before bending down.

As of now, the two had been overwhelmed with despair. While they trembled, their eyes eyes with Wang Xian’s as though the Devil had descended upon them.

“Didn’t think of this, did you? That you would end up in such a state for staging an attack on my little sister!?” Wang Xian asked as he looked at the young master.

Eyes filled with tears, he sank his head as his face looked dead as dust.

“Isn’t it good to be well and alive? Why did you seek death?” Wang Xian concluded before standing up, and began to take aim with his sword.

“This is an ancient tomb, how apt. It’ll do as your burial ground!” Wang Xian added.

Upon hearing the comment, everyone around shuddered.

They looked at the young man, both in awe and trepidation.

Thereafter, they watched as the young man walked to the side of the wheelchair and smiled at his younger sister before the duo left with the former pushing the wheelchair.

The rest continued to watch, with no less trepidation than fear, even as the duo went further away.

Behind the crowd, Mo Qinglong and Mo Yuan approached the bodies of the Nine Lotus Sect members. They retrieved the long sword, also an Inborn Spiritual Weapon, along with the Secret Manual of the Ancient Spiritual Sword Technique, before following behind the sibling duo.

“Simply too powerful. How could such a formidable youth exist in this world!” one of the onlookers gasped.

“What do you guys reckon of his prowess...do you think he’s Half-step to Dan Realm?” another quizzed.

The forces left behind crowded around and began to buzz as they watched the figure disappear.

Several Inborn experts who were closely acquainted exchanged glances before frowning.

“I think he’s at Half-step to Dan Realm!” an Elder from the Liuyun Family murmured.

“Likely the Inborn Realm. I saw his last defining strike, where the long sword was rooted into the ground while he held it with both hands. It’s likely that the last stance was executed by the Inborn Spiritual Weapon in his hands!” another contested.

“One from the Inborn Realm killing four Inborn experts all at once, where the four are all very formidable Inborn experts, too?” the third argued.

“Half-step to Dan Realm’s too inconceivable. I reckon he’s a Pinnacle Inborn. So he can still achieve what he did, under the boost from an Inborn Spiritual Weapon,” the last suggested.

The interactions between the few Inborn experts continued, while they shuddered at the sight of the bodies which were sprawled all over the place.

The prowess of the Nine Lotus Sect had suppressed that of all other forces present. They were also the ones to have gained all the recovered treasures from this ancient tomb excavation while the rest showed zero signs of resistance.

Yet, this was also the powerful Ancestral Sect which had been annihilated by a young man, using one long sword.

The ancient tomb ended up as the cemetery of the Nine Lotus Sect members. Based on the young man’s tone, his gang had no intentions of letting the Nine Lotus Sect off.

This was an utter extermination of the Sect!

“The top of the Outstanding Young Heroes Chart goes to that young man. The underworld is, once again, experiencing an upheaval!” a voice declared.
