Chapter 224: One Month

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

One day, two days, three days...

Wang Xian didn’t know how long he had been cultivating. Only through constant cultivation practice could he barely keep up with the absorption of that damn sapling of the Progenitor Tree.

Guan Shuqing, Xiao Yu and Lan Qingyue would come over to take a look at Wang Xian, who was sitting with his legs crossed in his room, from time to time.

If it wasn’t for Wang Xian emitting dense vitality and reminders from Mo Qinglong who stayed beside Wang Xian, they would probably have sent Wang Xian to the hospital.

On the 25th day, Doctor Sun woke up.

When she opened her eyes, the image of a Light Divine Dragon flickered and a horrifying pressure emitted from her body.

Xiao Yu and Guan Shuqing asked Doctor Sun to go home first but were rejected by her.

She stayed within the villa and within Wang Xian’s room the entire day while looking blankly at Wang Xian.

From time to time, she would use a towel to clean his face. While doing so, she always wore a blissful expression which might have been due to having the same bloodline as Wang Xian.

Her body emitted a kind of holiness and nobility that made one feel that this woman shouldn’t exist in the mortal realm.

Doctor Sun’s persistence and gentleness made Guan Shuqing and Lan Qingyue feel a strong sense of danger. However, Doctor Sun was treating them very kindly.

This made them a little speechless.

In the room of Wang Xian a month later.

Doctor Sun stared at Wang Xian with a blissful smile while Mo Qinglong stood at his side deferentially.

When he looked at Doctor Sun, it was with respect and fear.

“Phew! It’s finally not absorbing anymore!”

At this moment, Wang Xian opened his eyes and heaved a sigh.

“Miracle Doctor Wang, you are awake!” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

A pleasant voice sounded beside his ears. Wang Xian was slightly stunned and looked over.

An exquisite and perfect face appeared in front of him. Her bright eyes were staring intensely at Wang Xian.

Wang Xian was taken aback. Sensing the dramatic change in her aura and the even more beautiful Doctor Sun, he revealed a faint smile and exclaimed, “Doctor Sun, you are awake!”

“Yeah, thank you, Miracle Doctor Wang. You can just call me Lingxiu. Don’t call me Doctor Sun!”

Sun Lingxiu had the smile of a goddess. When she saw Wang Xian getting up, she immediately reached over to help him up.

“It’s alright, I can do it myself!” Wang Xian immediately replied. However, Sun Lingxiu still kept a warm smile, looking intensely at him and helping him up.

An alluring scent floated by, making Wang Xian a little aroused.

“Miracle Doctor Wang, shoes!”

Sun Lingxiu picked up the shoes on the floor and wanted to put them on for him!

What the...!

Wang Xian looked blankly at Sun Lingxiu. She was holy like a goddess and wore a white shirt. Her perfect figure was much better than Guan Shuqing and Lan Qingyue.

It was especially so for the vibes from her body. Even Wang Xian felt inferior to her in this aspect.

Someone like her was going to put on shoes for him?

“It’s fine. Let me do it myself. I can do it myself!” Wang Xian interrupted immediately.

“It’s alright. Miracle Doctor Wang saved my life. This is something I should do!”

Sun Lingxiu shook her head and squatted down.

Wang Xian couldn’t take it. He grabbed his shoes quickly and put them on.

“Miracle Doctor Wang, let me make you some food. You have not eaten for a long time!” Sun Lingxiu replied with a smile before walking out of the room.

Wang Xian’s jaw dropped and he looked to Mo Qinglong who was beside him. He felt confused and asked, “Old Mo, what happened?”

Mo Qinglong shook his head and answered, “Young Master, I don’t know either. Since Miss Sun woke up, she has been staying by your side.”

“Moreover...” Mo Qinglong hesitated for a moment before continuing, “Miss Sun is really strong now. In fact, she’s even stronger than me. I can sense Young Master’s vibes from her. I believe that this is because of the bloodline.”

Bloodline!

Wang Xian sank into thought. There’s a saying that goes along with the idea that blood is thicker than water. [1]

The blood within Sun Lingxiu was from him and they shared a common root and source.

This was similar to Wang Xian’s future child who would inherit his bloodline. It was just that Sun Lingxiu had inherited it by a different method. Therefore, Sun Lingxiu would develop a unique affection for him.

This type of unique feelings together with her admiration and love for Wang Xian from previous occasions made these feelings even stronger than before.

“It seems like things have gone beyond my expectations!”

Wang Xian had initially thought of curing her and raising her to be a great Miracle Doctor. In that case, there would be someone helping him earn money, and he wouldn’t be that busy in the future.

Forget it. Let’s just take a step at a time. However, Sun Lingxiu still has to stay with me at this moment, Wang Xian thought to himself. After which, he looked to Mo Qinglong and asked, “How long have I been practicing behind closed doors?”

“A month, Young Master. Some things happened during the month!” answered Mo Qinglong.

“So long? Speak. What happened?” Wang Xian asked curiously.

“First, Young Master’s ranking on the Miracle Doctors Chart has increased to eighth. Many people have invited Young Master to take a look at their illnesses. Second, assassins from the Sneaky Thorn Organization were sent to assassinate Young Master recently. The Sneaky Thorn Organization has now been annihilated by seven dragonians. The seven of them have established the Abyss, an assassin organization, and returned to their previous occupations. The Abyss received news from the Sneaky Thorn Organization that the one who issued the mission was from the Gambling City. They are now assassinating the higher management of Gambling City. An Inborn expert has been assassinated by Abyss and the name of Abyss is now known throughout the Underworld!” Mo Qinglong smiled and explained to Wang Xian.

“Oh, is it? That’s great. Establishing an assassination organization in less than a month! However, inform them to only kill those who deserve it. We don’t have to be the embodiment of justice but we can’t be too evil!” replied Wang Xian with a smile.

Based on the cultivation pace of the fifty dragonians, they should be Martial Artist Level 9 by now. Those who were diligent might have even reached the stage of Half-step to Inborn.

Previously, the fifty dragonians could have reached the Inborn Realm if they practiced behind closed doors for a hundred days. However, they were now acting outside. Therefore, the time required to reach the Inborn Realm might have been extended a little.

Nonetheless, fifty dragonians were definitely able to cause a storm in the Underworld.

“Yes, Young Master. The fifty dragonians managed to earn 500 spiritual stones in a month!” Mo Qinglong answered.

“It seems like my previous decision was correct!”

Wang Xian smiled and stretched his body. “I haven’t been out for a month. It’s time to relax a little.

He had been behind closed doors for a while. Feeling the little sapling in his body, Wang Xian had the urge to spew blood.

The little sapling was known as the Progenitor Tree. The name sounded cool and the fact that it could merge with his body was impressive. However, it didn’t seem to have any effects at all.

The only information about the Progenitor Tree was [The Ancestor of All Wood]. As to its effects, he had no clues at all.

This made him speechless. A month of cultivation practice behind closed doors and all he got was a little sapling that he did not know the use of.

“Miracle Doctor Wang, have something to eat!”

At this moment, the voice of Sun Lingxiu sounded from outside the room. Her voice was as sweet as a bird and made one’s heart skipped a beat.

“Alright, thank you!”

Wang Xian walked out of the room. When he saw dishes of delicacies placed on the dining table, he quickened his pace down the stairs.

“You don’t have to thank me. I’m just repaying the debt of gratitude!” Sun Lingxiu said to Wang Xian with a smile.
