Chapter 449: Sacred Sect: Dragon Sect (9)

“Get decadent!”

“Into Blood!”

The ominous-looking young man and the Flower Monk gave a loud and malevolent cry before they charged towards that dragon claws with grayish decadence and bloodthirsty energies.

“Claws of the Devil Dragon!”

The two Dragonians bellowed coldly, raking their half-meter dragon claws forward.

Ka Ka Ka!

A shattering sound came with a huge change in the expressions of the ominous-looking young man and Flower Monk. With horror, they watched as the daunting claws broke through their defense, ripping their bodies.

Gasp!

Their eyes were full of trepidation as they blocked with their hands in front of them. The terrifying claws with dragon scales stifled them.

Fear of death loomed over them.

“Do you concede defeat?”

The two Dragonians fixed their cold eyes on them as they uttered their question.

“We lost!”

“We lost!”

The two of them trembled with fear as they stared at the two Dragonians.

Bloodline oppression. As Bloodline Martial Artists, the scariest thing was to meet same-level opponents with a more prestigious bloodline.

That would cause great oppression on them. Besides, higher grade bloodlines would be much more dominating than the lower grades.

The two Dragonians withdrew their dragon claws and threw them a faint smile.

Both the Flower Monk and the ominous-looking young man grimaced. But they could only take a deep breath and bow before making their exits.

This was a recognition of the Dragonians’ strength.

The Dragonians neither kill any innocent nor push anyone to the end.

“That ominous-looking young man and Flower Monk were defeated!”

“Defeated, they are defeated. The rest of the supreme talents were all defeated. Gosh, these dozen people just won against all the previous supreme talents. Horrifying!”

“Outstanding Five Devil Dragons. No doubt they are the Outstanding Five Devil Dragons!”

“These Outstanding Five Devil Dragons must be from a secluded family. Could it be the previous diabolism?”

“The others were also very powerful. Somehow, they do not seem to have revealed their full power yet.”

Seeing that even the ominous-looking young man and Flower Monk were defeated, horror filled the eyes of the surrounding crowd at the arena.

Those supreme talents who were questioning whether anyone was not convinced were all defeated in the arena.

The ranking was completely overturned.

They were unable to react in time in the various combats today.

As they looked at the young men who sprouted out in the arena, tinges of awe flashed in their eyes.

“Second Uncle, where are they from? How is it that they are so mighty?”

Qiao Fuzi swept his gaze across the group of young men with darkening expression below the arena.

“I’m not sure. But I know that ominous-looking young man and the Flower Monk definitely come from diabolism.”

The middle-aged man beside him shook his head with eyes looking grave.

“Diabolism? Could those young men come from diabolism too? Those two men could turn their hands into some beasts’ claws. I’m sure they are not simple!” said Qiao Fuzi with a stern-looking face. When he was fighting with one of the young men in the arena, he’d already sensed the frightening strength and his combat experience was far from his own.

“There are too many changes to this Outstanding Young Heroes Chart this time!” said the middle-aged man with flickering eyes. “Something big is going to happen in the Underworld!”

“Given my strength, I can’t even be ranked in the Outstanding Young Heroes Chart!”

Qiao Fuzi gritted his teeth.

“We need to investigate where these young men came from. But now, all the more we need to kill that Miracle Doctor Wang. The remuneration from Medical Saint Sect could greatly enhance the strength of Qiao Clan!”

“Kill!”

Bam!

Just then, a sudden crashing sound came from the arena.

When the crowd looked over again, it was incredible combat that they saw.

“Why are they giving it all their might?”

All of them were shocked when they saw the Frozen Sorrows of the Young Lord stabbing at the sister of Miracle Doctor Wang’s chest.

Using his experience, he got his opponent to stab into his shoulder.

As he battled, this was the only choice that the Young Lord could make. To exchange a strike with a strike! ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Trying to break my defense?”

Upon seeing the Frozen Sorrows sticking on her chest, Xiao Yu revealed a smile.

From the smile on her face, anyone could tell that she was not in pain, and nothing had happened to her.

“Sss, this...”

The Young Lord gasped with a twisted expression on his face. In disbelief, he stared at the dagger in his hand, which could not break the defense of his opponent.

Sensing the immense pain from his shoulder, the Young Lord could not take it lying down.

He turned out to be unmatched with her. He was no match for that lass.

“No...”

The Young Lord took his exit hurriedly out of the arena.

“Hur? Are you throwing in the towel? Do you have cold feet?”

Xiao Yu was astounded when she saw Young Lord flitting out of the arena. She pointed her bone sword at him!

The Young Lord was unusually embarrassed. The ice layer on his head disappeared as he glared at Xiao Yu with a frosty look. The hand holding the Frozen Sorrows was trembling.

“Darn you, darn you!” he murmured as his eyes filled with murderous intent.

“The Young Lord has exited the arena. Is he admitting his defeat?”

“I guess so. This... Dark horse. This girl is the biggest dark horse this round. She actually defeated the Young Lord of Sea Serpent Island!”

Everyone fixed their astonished gazes on the Young Lord of Sea Serpent Island.

“Heh heh, Now it looks like I’m the champion of the supreme talents!”

Xiao Yu looked at the Young Lord with her chin slightly lifted. “Are you thinking of challenging my elder brother? You’re not fit yet.”

“You’re not fit to be a champion of the supreme talents either. I’m the champion!”

Xiao Yu was elated as she overlooked everyone around her. She was holding her chin up, looking proud!

“You...”

Upon seeing the complacent Xiao Yu, killing intent filled the eyes of Young Lord of Sea Serpent Island. “All of you shall die. DIE!”

Bam!

As soon as he finished his sentence, two middle-aged men emerged by his side in a split second.

“What? What is the Young Lord of Sea Serpent Island trying to do?”

“This is...? What does he want to do?”

Seeing the abrupt appearance of the two middle-aged men, the surrounding crowd was taken aback.

“Miracle Doctor Wang, you and your men shall perish here!”

The Young Lord of Sea Serpent Island glowered coldly at Wang Xian and Xiao Yu with a bloodthirsty look.

His words stunned everyone once again.

“Gentlemen, do it now. Whoever kills him shall take the remuneration!” said the Young Lord of Sea Serpent Island as he ignored the astounding looks when he swept his gaze across the surrounding crowd.

His words stupefied many people, while some of them were looking confused.

“Fine, we’ll take the killing order of the Medical Saint Sect!”

“Haha, let’s make this clear in advance. Everyone can kill Miracle Doctor Wang and the people beside him, but we shall not hurt our friendship and compete with each other!”

“The Wu Family will take his life!”

“Gentlemen, we’ll go by meritocracy!”

As soon as Young Lord of Sea Serpent Island spoke, some of the families and experts hesitated before they stepped forward.

There were Sacred Clan, Qiao Clan, the renowned Wu Family in Eastern Province, and some of the first-class forces.

Among which, five supreme Inborn talents who had participated in the ranking of Outstanding Young Heroes Chart also walked out with their families.

Eight Sacred Clans, a supreme first-class force actually stepped forward.

Eight forces and twenty-seven Inborn Experts in total.

They laughed and chatted with each other as they stared at Wang Xian and the people beside him like their prey.

“Brother, are we going to take part too?” asked a young man hesitantly to Saint Qi and Saint Wen when he saw more than a score of Inborn Experts were about to strike.

“No, I have a bad feeling about this!”

Another young man peered at the group of daunting young men who had been forgotten on the stage as a premonition surged.

“Yinxuan, are we really not going to do it?” Elder Yang, who was tempted to move, asked Tang Yinxuan once again.

“Elder Yang!” Tang Yinxuan was looking grave. “Just you wait and see someone die!”

“What is going on? What exactly is happening here?”

“Why... why are they suddenly attacking Miracle Doctor Wang? This...”

“The killing order of Medical Saint Sect. Could it be such that some forces strike?”

“Most likely. This is the only possibility now!”

Everyone was astounded to see eight powerful forces, which consisted of one Sacred Clan and seven supreme first-class forces!

On top of that, the son of the second strongest in the Underworld took part too.

“Miracle Doctor Wang is completely finished this time!”

“It’ll be difficult for him to escape. Little did I expect he would perish here!”

“Hmph, perhaps he did not expect revenge to come this soon after killing a Medical Saint Sect’s disciple. He’s going to get killed now!”

“Any forces wish to take part now? If there is, please step out now. If you sneak an attack later, I’ll not take it lying down!” Young Lord of Sea Serpent Island warned as he swept his gaze around upon seeing some of the forces walking out.

“That’s right. If anyone wants to take part in the killing order of Medical Saint Sect, step out now. Anyone who tries to take advantage later will be deemed as having gone against Qiao Clan!”

Qiao Fuzi also cast his gaze around.

Xiao Clan, Medical Saint Sect, the Inborn Disciple, and the golden Spiritual Bird from Imperial Beast Sect did not make any moves.

“Fine, if that’s the case, we’ll do the killing!”

Young Lord of Sea Serpent Island widened his mouth as he stared with a ghastly look at Wang Xian.

The remaining eight forces also threw their cold gazes at the prey that they were going to hunt down.

“Haha, well, well. Medical Saint Sect’s killing order!”

Wang Xian looked at the group with a slight quirk at the corner of his lips. “Phew, thirty Inborn Experts. Thirty Inborn Experts want my life!”

He gazed at the Young Lord of Sea Serpent Island, Qiao Clan, and the rest. With a faint smile on his face, he said, “Let me make an announcement before you guys strike!”

“I’ll give the dying man ten more seconds to live!”

A middle-aged man from Qiao Clan slowly pulled out his sword.

“I hereby announce to the Underworld...” Wang Xian swept his gaze across the surrounding crowd. With a soft yell, he said, “I, Wang Xian, establish Dragon Sect, a Sacred Sect!”

“Where are the disciples of Dragon Sect?”

“Where are the disciples of Dragon Sect?

An announcement came as a surprise to everyone, including the eight forces.

Boom boom!

A bout of terrifying aura broke out from the arena and the surrounding spots.

The sky turned dark as an immense bout of demonic aura darted into the air.

“Disciples of the Dragon Sect hereby greet the Dragon King!”

“Disciples of the Dragon Sect hereby greet the Dragon King!”

All the Dragonians from the arena made their moves and appeared before Wang Xian with one knee on the floor!

More then dozens of figures showed up before Wang Xian, half-kneeling behind him.

“Greetings to the Dragon King!”
