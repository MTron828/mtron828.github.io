Chapter 1151: 1152 flew into a rage

Translator: 5496903

“Damn it, I can’t even get any information out of him. Why is this damn old man so stubborn? !”

At this moment, in the branch of the undercurrent assassin organization in Bright Moon City, an old man dressed in white looked at the old man in front of him who was covered in wounds with an unsightly expression.

His expression was extremely gloomy. He had originally wanted to get the spy on the dragon Spike to dig out information about the dragon spike from him, but this old man did not say anything.

Even if there was any information about the dragon spike, he didn’t say anything.

This made him extremely angry.

“Sir, what do we do now? Without information about the dragon spike, how are we going to deal with them?”

The middle-aged man at the side also asked with a gloomy face.

“Phew, let’s wait for tomorrow. When the leader comes tomorrow, we’ll have a solution!”

The white-clothed old man said with a gloomy face. When he talked about the leader, his face was slightly pale.

The middle-aged man at the side was slightly silent.

“AH, he killed someone!”

The next morning, a shrill voice sounded in bright moon city.

This voice didn’t come from one place, but from several places.

In the powerful mercenary group base, in the powerful clans.

The shouts attracted the attention of many people.

“It’s dragon Spike! The Dragon Assassin organization has assassinated Commander Gu! Oh My God, Commander Gu is a peak level 8 transcendent expert!”

“They’ve made their move. Yesterday, Dragon Spike had assassinated the son of the master of undercurrent and the Ace assassin of undercurrent. They’ve announced their arrival. Today, they’ll begin their mission!”

“It’s going to be chaotic. Bright Moon city is going to be chaotic. The price of the Dragon Assassin organization is twice the price of undercurrent. Many people will definitely look for dragon spike to make their move!”

“Once what happened today happens, the others will definitely panic. There might be more and more people who will hire the Dragon Assassin!”

Early in the morning, when the news of the assassinations by the dragon assassin spread, the entire Bright Moon City became lively.

Many people had solemn expressions on their faces.

The arrival of the dragon assassin was completely different from the undercurrent.

In the past, there were not many people who hired the undercurrent. The main reason was that the undercurrent’s fees were too high. Many people were not willing to pay such a high price.

But now, a dragon Spike had suddenly appeared, and the fee was half of the undercurrents’fee. This made many people’s hearts stir.

Last night, more than 20 people had been assassinated by the dragon spike in one night, which made some people apprehensive.

In the past, because the undercurrents’fees were too high, they might not have been too worried that their enemies would hire assassins.

But now that the dragon Spike had appeared and suddenly reduced the hiring fee by two times, would their enemies and opponents take action?

There was a very high possibility.

When they thought of the more than 20 people that the dragon Spike had assassinated last night, they became even more flustered.

Now, many people felt like they had no choice but to shoot an arrow at the bowstring.

“Do you guys think that the Zhao family will hire the dragon Spike?” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Father, I’m... not sure, but with old dog Zhao’s character, it’s hard to say!”

“It’s hard to say. Old Dog Zhao has always wanted to get rid of us, but by hiring undercurrents, the Zhao family will be severely injured. Now, they can barely afford the hiring fee!”

In the center of Bright Moon City, in a family that occupied an extremely large area and was well-known throughout Bright Moon City, an old man sat there with a frown as he slowly conversed with a few middle-aged men.

They were worried, worried that the opponent would hire the dragon spike.

They deeply understood that it was better to strike first!

In the entire Bright Moon City, many families and mercenary groups were weighing this problem.

Should they act or not!

...

“I really didn’t expect that the arrival of the dragon spike would actually shake the entire bright moon city. This is something that even the undercurrent assassin organization hasn’t been able to do!”

“The main reason is that this dragon spike is too fierce. It came to Bright Moon City and killed the son of the undercurrent master and the Ace assassin of the undercurrent. Moreover, the hiring price was twice as low. This caused the shock in Bright Moon City!”

“I originally thought that the undercurrent was stronger than the dragon spike. Now, it seems that this dragon spike is much more powerful than the undercurrent!”

“That’s right. The undercurrent obviously can’t compare to the dragon spike. The leader’s son and Ace assassin were killed without any reaction. This undercurrent is really useless!”

At the North Gate of Bright Moon City, several members of the mercenary group were talking.

At this moment, a middle-aged man with long hair slowly walked over from the north gate.

The middle-aged man’s long hair completely covered his eyes. He was wearing blue clothes with red stripes.

He heard the conversation of several members of the mercenary group. The red stripes on his blue clothes were rotating like blood.

Drops of blood-red liquid slowly flowed toward the three young men.

No one in the surroundings noticed that three tiny drops of liquid were flowing on the ground.

“Bang, Bang, Bang!”

When the middle-aged man walked past the three young men, the sound of three people falling to the ground was suddenly heard, causing the people around them to look stunned.

“What’s going on? What Happened?”

“Why did the three of them suddenly fall to the ground!”

A chaotic sound came from behind. The middle-aged man’s face did not have the slightest fluctuation as he walked forward in a cold and desolate manner.

His speed was very fast, so fast that many people around him did not notice him walking past them.

He came to the front of a medicinal pill shop and walked straight over.

In the medicinal pill shop, the white-clothed old man saw that he had arrived. His body trembled, and he hurriedly went up to greet him respectfully.

“Leader!”

The white-clothed old man called out in a low voice.

The middle-aged man did not speak. He directly walked towards the back, and the white-clothed old man followed behind.

“Ah!”

Just as he entered the back room, the old man suddenly let out a miserable cry. His body trembled, and he took a deep breath of cold air. He looked at the arm on the ground.

“It’s me who failed to take good care of the young master. Please punish me, Leader!”

The old man immediately knelt on the ground and didn’t even move his arm.

“Tell me the news about the dragon Spike!”

The cold voice came out of the middle-aged man’s mouth. He raised his head slightly and his long hair slowly spread to the back, revealing a pair of blood-red eyes.

The old man knelt on the ground, not daring to look directly at him.

“Leader... leader, we only caught a spy of the dragon spike, but we didn’t get any useful information from him!”

The white-clothed old man said with a trembling body.

“I’ll handle this matter personally!”

The middle-aged man said word by word, “Go to the city Lord’s Mansion!”

“Yes, it’s leader!”

The old man in white nodded quickly and led the middle-aged man towards the city Lord’s mansion.

...

At this moment, Wang Xian didn’t know that a powerful opponent had arrived at Bright Moon City.

He sat in the room of the restaurant and listened to the report of the DRAKONID with a smile on his face.

Yesterday, the dragon Spike had accepted 22 missions. However, today, they had accepted a total of 50 missions.

The highest mission was to assassinate a transcendent level 9 powerhouse.

After completing these missions, he would receive at least 2 billion mid-grade spirit stones!
