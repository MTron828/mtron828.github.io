Chapter 2965: Under the Supreme Treasure of the Chimei region

“Dragon King, there’s a special situation in the Chimei region.”

A short rest began. However, before fifteen days had passed, an lie received a piece of bad news.

He frowned when he saw the sudden message from an lie.

“Come back immediately!”

!!

Wang Xian moved and arrived at the Dragon King’s Hall.

“Dragon King!”

When he arrived at the Dragon King’s Hall, an lie had already teleported over.

“What happened in the chimei territory?”

Wang Xian frowned and asked him.

“Dragon King, there are more demon caves appearing in the glazed domain. There are three more of them!”

“I went into the demon caves to investigate. All of them are demonic level five celestial emperors. Furthermore, there are two demonic level five celestial emperors in the Demon Caves!”

An lie exclaimed in astonishment.

“Oh? There are three more demon caves?”

Wang Xian stood up from the dragon throne with a look of astonishment on his face.

“Dragon King, I was also very curious when I received this information. I have also read the information regarding the glazed domain and the chimei domain.”

“There were celestial thearchs in the glazed domain who came to the deepest part of the chimei domain in the past. However, they did not discover so many powerful demon caves.”

“These demon caves were transported back from other worlds. After the leaders of the three demon caves arrived, they immediately flew towards the deepest part of the chimei domain. Dragon King, Guess What I Found?”

An lie said mysteriously.

“Cough, cough!”

Seeing Wang Xian staring at him, an lie didn’t dare to keep him in suspense. “I found a continent in the deepest part of the glazed domain with a radius of 100 kilometers. In the center of the continent, there is a pond. In the pond, there is a bright flower that is like a lotus. It contains a majestic energy.”

“The energy is very huge. When the few new leaders of the demon lair arrived there, the leaders of the other two demon lairs also flew over in an instant. The few leaders of the demon lairs almost started fighting.”

As an lie spoke, his eyes emitted a fiery glow.

“Are you saying that these demon lairs were attracted by the treasure in the pond?” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and said.

“Yes, Dragon King. They were definitely attracted by the treasure. Otherwise, once the demonic dens appeared, the demonic leaders would fly in that direction.”

“According to my guess, this is definitely an extremely powerful treasure. Furthermore, that treasure might mature in the near future because the six level five celestial thearch demons are guarding the area!”

An lie nodded heavily.

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows slightly as his eyes sparkled.

To be able to summon the demonic beasts back and attract so many powerful demonic beasts, that treasure was definitely not simple.

With the level of the divine grass, it was impossible for it to be lower than a level six void celestial emperor.

That was because there was no need for so many level five celestial emperor Demonic Beasts to snatch the treasure.

“Dragon King, if you want to snatch the treasure, leave it to me. With my speed, I will pluck the flower the moment it ripens. Those rank five celestial thearch demonic leaders will definitely not be able to do anything to me!”

An lie spoke at this moment, his face filled with confidence.

With his current strength, a rank five celestial thearch expert could not even touch his shadow.

If they were to snatch the treasure, the group of demons could only watch helplessly.

“Okay!”

Wang Xian nodded his head slightly.

Although it was unexpected that the chimei territory had such a powerful treasure, it would not be a problem for them to snatch the treasure with an Lie’s teleportation.

However, after snatching the treasure, it would be best to eliminate the leader of the demons in order to prevent them from rebelling.

“Keep an eye on the chimei territory’s treasure for now. Once there’s any news, send it over immediately. If the treasure is mature, snatch it away immediately!”

Wang Xian ordered an lie.

“It’s the Dragon King. Don’t worry, the treasure is definitely ours!”

An lie said confidently.

“It’s going to be troublesome!”

Wang Xian sat on the dragon chair and knocked gently.

A group of evil leaders had flown out from the demon lair. There were three more demon leaders and four level-five celestial thearch evil leaders. There were a total of six level-five celestial thearch evil leaders.

It would be very troublesome to deal with all six of them at once!

“There are still five days before the members of the Dragon Palace can fully improve. However, even if they improve this time, they can not be teleported to the demon lairs and killed one by one like in the past.”

He thought to himself.

“Forget it. Let’s take it one step at a time. After the members of the Dragon Palace improve, the strength of the Dragon Palace will not be weaker than the five great demon lairs!”

Wang Xian thought to himself.

Although the high-end combat strength of the Demon Caverns was strong, the number of celestial thearchs in the Dragon Palace was huge.

There were more than 7,000 celestial thearchs among the members of the Dragon Palace.

More than 7,000 celestial thearchs. No one in the entire resplendent starry sky could believe it.

“Dragon King, Dragon King, I have good news and Bad News!”

However, two days later, an lie suddenly returned to the Dragon Palace and shouted loudly.

“Eh?”

Wang Xian moved and came in front of him. He stared at the huge flower in his hand.

The two-meter-long red flower was extremely bright and contained a majestic energy.

In just a breath, Wang Xian could feel that his dragon energy had increased by a lot!

“This is?”

His pupils constricted slightly as he asked an lie.

“It’s that Supreme Treasure. Just now, the six leaders of the demonic beasts suddenly flew towards it. All of their demonic beasts’subordinates started to riot and a terrifying battle broke out.”

“When I saw this situation, I naturally made my move immediately. I plucked this divine flower and disappeared instantly!”

“In the end, there was a bad thing. The demonic beasts stopped attacking each other and let out violent roars. They went berserk!”

“The worse news is that the six leaders of the demons have entered the Devil’s lair. They are flying out of the chimei territory towards the glazed area!”

An lie reported.

When Wang Xian heard his words, he immediately frowned.

“How fast is the group of demons?”

Wang Xian immediately asked.

“Because they are in the deepest part of the chimei territory. Based on their speed, it will take them three to four days to reach the glazed area.”

An lie immediately said.

“Three to four days? Fortunately, there’s still time!”

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered. With a wave of his arm, he took the divine flower from an Lie’s hand.

“This is?”

When he saw the flower in his hand, his eyes revealed an extremely excited expression.

Ghost Flower: Level Seven Void Celestial Emperor

“I didn’t expect it to be a level seven void celestial emperor flower. If I absorb this ghost flower, how much can I improve?”

“Can I break through to the Celestial Emperor Realm?”

Wang Xian’s eyes revealed an extremely heated expression.

If he could rely on this ghost flower to improve to the celestial emperor realm, he could easily kill all the demonic beasts in the five great demon caves.

“However, I can’t be too happy too soon. If I can’t break through to the Celestial Emperor Realm, I would at most have the combat strength of a level five celestial emperor.”

Wang Xian thought to himself as he returned to the Dragon Palace with the ghost flower.
