“Immortal King Level 2!”

Wang Xian looked at his own attributes, a smile on his face!

Immortal King Level 2, Immortal King Level 8 combat strength, the current Wang Xian, feel a wave of his hand, can destroy a star!

“Hsiao-hsien, you’ve been promoted!”

“Lao Wang, you’ve been promoted!”

At this time, sensing the movement in the Dragon King’s Palace, a group of girls and flowers color son walked in!

When Wang Xian saw them enter, his body moved and transformed into a human form. His face was filled with smiles!

With an outsider like the Empress Star, Wang Xian would not reveal himself!

“I’ve broken through!”

Wang Xian nodded at them and said with a smile!

“You’ve broken through? Doesn’t that mean you have the strength of an immortal king level eight? Are you the same as the senior of the Heaven Array? Are you the kind of old monster who died and retrained with blood?”

At the side, Emperor Star Lady looked up and down at Wang Xian. Her eyes were filled with disbelief!

How long has it been?

When I first met this guy, was his strength at level three or level two?

Now, he is at level eight of the Immortal King Level?

With this strength, even the imperial court would be able to control a region!

“You can’t compare yourself to others, Big Sister!”

Wang Xian looked at Di Xingnu and couldn’t help but tease her!

“You...”

Di Xingnu’s expression changed and revealed an annoyed expression!

She had been in the Dragon Palace for a few years and knew a little about Wang Xian and the rest. Although she wasn’t sure how old Wang Xian was, she knew from Tang Yinxuan and the rest that he was much younger than her!

She couldn’t believe it. However, when she saw the terrifying speed of improvement, she fell silent again!

She turned around and looked at Hua Er Cai’er. These two girls had just come to the Dragon Palace a year ago. When they came, they were only at level one eternal lord. Now, they were as strong as her!

“HMPH, you didn’t even give me some fruits!”

She looked at the fruits on the dragon throne with a burning passion. She knew that each of the fruits had an extremely terrifying effect!

“Hehe!”

Wang Xian smiled and did not reply. After all, the Imperial Star Lady was a member of the imperial court. Even if the fruits were to be given to her, she had to possess the strength of a celestial emperor before she could give them to her!

Otherwise, if the imperial court were to discover the effect of such a heaven-defying fruit, it might attract disaster!

“Let’s Go and celebrate!”

As Wang Xian spoke, he led the group of girls to the entertainment area of the Dragon Palace!

Time passed day by day. In the blink of an eye, it had been three months since Wang Xian’s upgrade!

“Heaven Formation, Jin Ming, how’s the construction going?”

Wang Xian came to a spot not far away from the starry sky of the Dragon Star. He looked at the towering and huge mountain peak and entered it while saying with a smile!

“Dragon King, it’s almost done. It will be completed in a few days!”

The formation replied while setting up formations!

A few months ago, after the formation broke through, he had been building this war machine!

For more than two months, he did not stop!

When he was building the Dragon Star, he did not spend so much time either!

It could be said that after the war machine was built, even if the defense of the Dragon Star was activated, a light bump could shatter the Dragon Star!

“Dragon King, we have almost finished building the large-scale war god equipment here. A part of them are specially made for the members of the Heavenly Eye Arrow Division to create arrow platforms!”

At the side, Duan Jinming said with a smile!

...

It took the entire fire hammer clan six to seven thousand people to build all kinds of war machines in three months!

And the arrow platforms were specially prepared for the members of the Heavenly Eye Arrow Division!

When the members of the Heavenly Eye Arrow Division stood on the arrow platform and pulled out their arrows, they were able to create a terrifying destructive force!

After all, the arrows of the Arrow Dragon were extremely terrifying!

“Very good!”

Wang Xian looked around with a satisfied expression on his face!

War machines were extremely terrifying, especially the war machines created by the Heaven Formation. Just the various formations laid out were enough to shock people!

However, if the weapons were to run at full speed, the consumption would be terrifying too!

According to the sky array, a day of opening all the arrays would require three days of Dragon Star’s income!

The amount of God stones that Dragon Star earned in a day was a huge amount!

Right now, one day of Dragon Star’s income could increase the strength of two to three undying fighters in the Dragon Palace, one could imagine how much it would cost!

...

Of course, this consumption was within the tolerance range of the Dragon Palace. If this war machine really operated for a day, just killing the opponent would be enough to make up for the loss. It could even be increased by a few hundred times!

This was also the reason why Wang Xian valued this war machine so much!

“Master!”

At this moment, a voice was heard. Following that, a figure flew over!

“Huh?”

“Bei Shuang, what’s the matter?”

Wang Xian looked at the figure flying over and asked!

Ever since bei Shuang had taken him as her master more than a year ago, Wang Xian had allowed her to cultivate in the Dragon Palace!

With sufficient resources and her strong foundation, her strength had risen to level four immortal King Realm in just over a year!

This strength was not bad!

“Master, something big has happened on the Demon Island!”

Bei Shuang flew over and said with a bad expression!

“Demon Island?”

Wang Xian looked at her with some doubt!

“Master, not long ago, the Abyss expanded crazily and swallowed up thousands of planets. Everyone on the planets were swallowed up by the Abyss Seed!”

“Now, the Abyss is still expanding at a terrifying speed. This is something that has not happened in the past tens of millions of years. All the forces on the Demon Island joined forces to fight against the abyss seed, but they still suffered heavy losses!”

“Our bei Chuan sect has also suffered heavy losses. Now, we are recruiting all the disciples to help!”

Bei Shuang looked at him and said!

“You want to go over?”

Wang Xian looked at her and asked!

Bei Shuang was slightly silent and said slowly, “Although the bei Chuan sect has given up on me, they have treated me well. I want to go over and help!”

“Hehe, if you want to go, go ahead!”

Wang Xian smiled and nodded at her. He didn’t think that there was anything wrong with bei Shuang going to the sect!

If he saw that the sect was in danger and didn’t care at all, he would have to consider the character of this disciple!

“It’s master. If anything happens to bei Shuang, she might not be able to repay master’s kindness!” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Bei Shuang said in a low voice and kowtowed to Wang Xian on the ground!
