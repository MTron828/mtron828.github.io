2853 All 2853 were under his command

“The attacking power of the trees is getting stronger and stronger!”

In the windless forest valley, Wang Xian’s expression turned slightly solemn after he had harvested one holy feather.

He had already ventured deep into the windless forest valley. After flying for two whole days, he could even see the end of the windless forest valley.

At the end of the valley was a towering mountain peak with densely packed trees on it.

However, when Wang Xian obtained the 26th Holy Feather, the attack power of the trees had already made it very difficult for Wang Xian to deal with them.

!!

“26. Including the one that I have already obtained, there is a total of 27. There are still 22 more to go!”

“However, this windless forest valley seems to be coming to an end. I can still make it there and there are still holy feathers, but there should be less than 22 of them. Could it be that there are missing holy feathers here?”

Wang Xian’s expression was a little ugly. The windless forest was about to come to an end, and there were still twenty-two holy feathers missing.

If there weren’t enough holy feathers here, it would be troublesome.

In the vast sea of stars, where could he find a single feather?

“Let’s continue to go deeper!”

Wang Xian frowned and continued to fly forward.

After flying for a few minutes, Wang Xian didn’t find a single wind jade or holy feather. This made his expression even uglier.

He was almost at the end.

“I’m almost there!”

In less than a minute, the mountain peak at the end was right in front of him. Wang Xian could sense the existence of the holy feather on the incipient holy wings.

However, even if he had one holy feather, he was still short of twenty-one!

“Huh?”

Suddenly, when Wang Xian’s gaze swept across his surroundings, he was completely stunned. He looked ahead in astonishment with a shocked expression on his face.

At the end of the windless forest valley, there was an incomparably huge tree.

This tree was ten times the size of the other trees in the surroundings. The tree branches were abnormally long with densely packed leaves on them.

However, in the middle of this tree, there was a wind jade.

This wind jade was in the shape of a bird. However, it was several times the size of a first level divine Emperor Wind Jade. It was about half a meter in size.

However, this was not what shocked Wang Xian. What shocked him was that there were holy feathers on the wings of this bird.

In other words, all the holy feathers of the incipient holy wings were here.

“I didn’t expect that. Haha, I really didn’t expect that all the holy feathers were here!”

Wang Xian’s eyes were burning with excitement.

He thought that there would be a shortage of holy feathers, but he didn’t expect that all the remaining holy feathers would be here.

What a pleasant surprise.

However, very soon, his expression turned solemn.

The last tree in the windless forest valley was the largest tree.

It was ten times larger than the other trees.

This also meant that the attack of this tree was abnormally terrifying.

Wang Xian stared at the tree, his expression changing constantly.

“I must get the Holy Feather. Even if my body collapses or even dies, I must get it.”

“The moment I get the Holy Feather, I will keep the holy feather and that Wind Jade into the Dragon Palace!”

Wang Xian gritted his teeth as a determined look appeared in his eyes.

He was determined to get the Holy Feather.

If he could not get these holy feathers during the windless days, he might have to raise his combat strength to the third or fourth stage of the void God realm before he could get these holy feathers after the windless days.

“I’ll give it my all.”

Wang Xian scanned his surroundings. The next moment, his body began to transform slowly.

A two-meter-long seven-colored divine dragon appeared. What was slightly strange was that there was a pair of bone wings on the body of the seven-colored divine dragon.

After transforming into a divine dragon, Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly. Earthen yellow energy surrounded his entire body.

He took a deep breath.

“I’ll be lucky if I don’t Die!”

Wang Xian clenched his dragon claws slightly and approached slowly.

Buzz

Chirp, chirp, chirp

The moment Wang Xian’s dragon claws grabbed onto the bird-type fengyu, a green glow burst out from the bird-type Fengyu’s pupils.

A sharp sound was emitted from its mouth. It was as if the bird-type Fengyu had survived.

An extremely terrifying aura was emitted from the bird-type wind jade. At this moment, Wang Xian’s face was extremely pale.

Its icy-cold eyes stared at Wang Xian as its wings trembled slightly.

“It’s psychic!”

Wang Xian’s face was filled with cold sweat. A hint of fear could be seen in his eyes. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

With the level-two divine emperor of the Void Wind Jade and the 22 holy feathers, how strong would these two powers be when combined?

It would be a piece of cake to kill Wang Xian instantly.

“Crash!”

The wings of the bird-type wind jade trembled slightly as if a great terror was about to descend.

“Buzz!”

Just as Wang Xian was about to flee for his life, the uninitiated holy wings behind him suddenly trembled. A wave of energy enveloped the bird-type wind jade.

The holy feathers on it trembled slightly.

“CHIRP CHIRP!”

A mournful cry came from the bird-type wind jade.

Crack

A glimmer of hope flashed across Wang Xian’s eyes. His Dragon Claw grabbed the bird-type wind jade and peeled it off the tree.

Buzz

The next moment, he kept the bird-type wind jade.

“I got it!”

An excited expression appeared on his face.

I got it. I got it all.

I got all 49 holy feathers.

Furthermore, there was also a large amount of wind jade.

“Haha!”

Wang Xian could not help but laugh out loud.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

However, perhaps it was due to the extreme joy that led to sorrow. When he touched the bird-type wind jade, the huge tree had yet to attack him.

When he had completely stored the bird-type wind jade, the tree moved.

It was at least ten times bigger than the other trees. There were tens of millions of leaves on it.

Furthermore, the branches were emitting a green glow. They looked like terrifying wind whips!

The wind whips and tens of millions of leaves instantly attacked Wang Xian.

“Oh no!”

Wang Xian felt the terrifying attack and his expression changed drastically. Thick and heavy earth elemental law defenses appeared in front of him instantly.

“Bang! Bang! Bang!”

However, the Earth elemental law defenses didn’t even last for 0.0001 seconds before they collapsed.

One after another, attacks landed on Wang Xian’s body.

“F * ck!”

Wang Xian was horrified. He felt that he would be destroyed by the leaves and branches in the next moment.

He would definitely not survive.

He had a sudden thought and wrapped his vital parts with the inceptive holy wings.

Head, Heart.

When the inceptive holy wings had just covered his head and heart, he realized that the rest of his body had disappeared.

Yes, all of them had disappeared. They had been obliterated by the terrifying attack!

However, at this moment, Wang Xian had an excited look in his eyes.

The incipient saint wings could withstand the attacks from the leaves and branches.

Just the head and heart were enough.

Even if it was just a recovery, it wouldn’t take long.

His eyes were glowing as he quickly fled outside. His head moved slightly and transformed into a human form.

The dissipating body was restored by his dragon energy.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

However, Wang Xian didn’t expect the tree behind him to launch a second round of attack.

The reason why he had the primaless holy wings was that he wouldn’t be attacked again as long as he dodged the first round of attack.

However, he didn’t expect the tree to launch a second round of attack.

This time, the attack was somewhat familiar.

The branches and leaves condensed into the shape of a fan and headed straight for him.
