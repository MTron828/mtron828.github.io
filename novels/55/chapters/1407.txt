Chapter 1408: 1408 terrifying harvest

“Bang, Bang, Bang!”

“Boom, Boom, Boom!”

Behind Xiaoyao City, the 10,000-meter-tall peak collapsed, as if it was a sign of the destruction of the entire Xiaoyao city.

Rocks rolled down, and the waterfall flowed in disorder.

Some sharp-eyed people saw a familiar corpse flowing down the waterfall.

Everyone in Xiaoyao city stared blankly at this scene, their eyes slightly widened.

The 10,000-meter-tall mountain collapsed.

Xiaoyao city collapsed as well.

Everyone raised their heads and looked at the 50-meter-tall terrifying creature in the sky. Their eyes were filled with deep respect.

This terrifying creature didn’t even have the slightest injury after killing the mayor of Xiaoyao City.

Other than the final attack, the rest of the time, he was controlling that terrifying gigantic millstone!

Wang Xian scanned the corpse of the mayor of Xiaoyao City and looked down at the entire Xiaoyao City.

“Roar!”

He let out a soft roar and the roar of a dragon resounded throughout the entire Xiaoyao city.

“In the future, there will be no more Xiaoyao city in this world!”

He let out a loud roar and swayed his body as he descended towards the ground.

“Buzz!”

Upon landing on the ground, Wang Xian immediately reverted to his dragon form!

“Master Wang is invincible!”

The moment he landed on the ground, the people from the bamboo mountain sect rushed forward and shouted loudly.

“My King is invincible!”

The members of the Fire Hammer clan walked forward with fiery faces and shouted respectfully.

My King is invincible!

After witnessing the strength of their Dragon King and the power of the members of the Dragon Palace, the faces of the members of the fire hammer clan were filled with pride.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian waved his hand, indicating that they didn’t need to say anything more.

He looked at the people from the bamboo mountain sect and said, “You can make a trip back to the sect first before heading to the Imperial Palace of the Dragon and Phoenix Dynasty!”

“Yes, sir. We will report to the sect master and head to the Dragon and Phoenix dynasty immediately!” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

The experts from the bamboo mountain sect nodded in pleasant surprise.

They knew that they had made the right choice in this battle.

They didn’t know the relationship between the Dragon Palace and the Dragon and Phoenix Empire, but they were sure that all the forces within a 100,000-kilometer radius were about to be shuffled!

And the Dragon and Phoenix Empire was likely to control all the cities within a 100,000-kilometer radius.

Looking at the 300 insightful emptiness realm experts, everyone from the Bamboo Mountain sect was very certain.

“Your empires should be very clear about what’s going to happen next. The Dragon and Phoenix Empire will take over all your cities and sweep through the six directions!”

Wang Xian looked at the dozens of insightful emptiness realm experts who were kneeling on the ground and said without a doubt.

“Yes, sir. We will definitely cooperate!”

The experts from the dynasties nodded their heads with bitter expressions. What was supposed to happen had finally come!

In this short period of time, they had already made up their minds.

The Dragon and Phoenix dynasty had three hundred insightful emptiness realm experts. It was not something they could resist at all.

In fact, no empire could resist such a terrifying force within a radius of 100,000 kilometers or 200,000 kilometers.

It was only a matter of time before they were subdued or conquered.

If they wanted to obtain a good position now, they could not be like the Jinliang Empire.

The Jinliang Empire was taken care of by the experts of the Dragon Palace previously. Now, not a single one of them was left alive!

“The gilded gold family!”

At this moment, Wang Xian suddenly looked at the members of the gilded gold family.

“My lord, I’m here. I’m Here!”

The members of the gilded gold family trembled slightly under the leadership of the gilded gold ancestor and a level three void interpretation stage powerhouse. They hurriedly took a few steps forward.

They knelt on the ground and were filled with respect.

“No need. Get Up!”

Wang Xian waved his arm and an imposing manner made them stand up. “You are guilty!”

“However, on account of the fact that the lady of the Gilded Gold family is marrying the future general of the Dragon Palace, Duan Jinming, you will be pardoned!”

“Now, you will lead the members of the Dragon Palace to collect all the valuable items in the entire Xiaoyao city. They will not be required to hand over the items belonging to the ordinary citizens!”

“In the future, your gilded gold family can go to the dragon-phoenix dynasty and become an official or just a family!”

Wang Xian said to them calmly.

“Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir. We will definitely atone for our sins!”

“Thank you, Dragon King!”

Everyone from the gilded gold family thanked him immediately.

Gilded Gold Yan was also full of gratitude.

The members of the Gilded Gold clan knew that what happened today was not a bad thing for their gilded gold clan. In fact, it was a great good thing.

With the importance that the king attached to Duan Jinming, Duan Jinming would definitely become a high-ranking official of the Dragon Palace in the future.

And their son-in-law was Duan Jinming. Just this reputation alone could make their gilded gold clan stand at the peak of this continent!

“It seems that we have to curry favor with Yanyan and this son-in-law in the future!”

All the members of the gilded gold family looked at each other.

However, the eldest sister and second brother who stood at the side looked at Duan Jinming and their third sister in a daze.

They never thought that a young Demon Beast, who was lowly in their eyes, would rise to the clouds and soar to the sky!

They had never expected that their third sister would become someone that the entire gilded gold clan had to curry favor with in the future.

This made them look a little embarrassed!

One had to know that they usually didn’t treat their third sister and Duan Jinming very well.

“Lords of the Dragon Palace, follow me. We are familiar with every clan in Xiaoyao city. We will take you there!”

The Gilded Gold family said to the members of the Dragon Palace.

The Golden Swordfish accompanied them to search for the treasures of the families in Xiaoyao City.

All the families in Xiaoyao City had participated in this mission to destroy them.

Now that they had been destroyed, the treasures had to be taken away.

These families controlled 95% of the resources in Xiaoyao City.

Not to mention the mayor of Xiaoyao City.

The mayor of Xiaoyao City had a few hundred longswords of the insightful void tier. One could imagine how wealthy he was.

According to Wang Xian’s estimation, the entire Xiaoyao city was worth at least 10 to 20 trillion middle-grade spirit stones!

This was not an exaggeration.

One had to know that the items auctioned off in a king’s auction were worth 10 to 20 trillion middle-grade spirit stones!

As for the 10 to 20 trillion middle-grade spirit stones, Xiaoyao City needed to withdraw 10% of them.

That was one to two trillion middle-grade spirit stones!

Just the Xiaoyao City Lord alone had more than 10 trillion resources.

Including all the families, it was definitely a terrifying amount of resources.

“After obtaining all the resources in Xiaoyao City, my strength can almost be raised by one level!”

As Wang Xian thought of this, a smile appeared on his face.

Furthermore, the corpses of the experts could increase the strength of the members of the Dragon Palace.

After helping Feng Luan sweep through the surrounding 30 dynasties, the strength of the Dragon Palace would receive a terrifying increase!

He moved and flew towards the residence of the mayor of Xiaoyao City, collecting all the items inside.

“Dragon King, collect all the items!”

Two hours later, the gilded gold family led the Dragon Palace to the king’s territory in the center and said loudly.
