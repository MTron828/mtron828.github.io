Chapter 424: Arrival Of The Dragon (2)

“What a majestic-looking Sacred Clan. Sui Huang lives in a huge Siheyuan while this is an ancient-looking mansion for the nobles!” exclaimed Wang Xian as his eyes were fixed on the exceptionally huge mansion before him.

There were over ten entrances to the mansion and they were standing before the main Eastern Gate.

Two young men stood on the sides of the gate while observing the surroundings attentively. When they saw Wang Xian and Xiao Ran, they exchanged glances.

“Who are you guys?” One of the young men squinted his eyes and shouted at Wang Xian.

“Seventh generation of Xiao Clan, Xiao Ran! I have not returned since a year ago. Today, I’m back!”

Xiao Ran stepped forward and looked at the incomparably huge mansion before him with complicated feelings.

Once, this was a place where his mother, sister and he had always looked forward to living. However, it was hell for them after they got in.

Not that he was finally back, he was coming for revenge and to announce to the entire Xiao Clan that he, Xiao Ran, was back!

He was still a teenager but was no longer the weak teenager who anyone could bully.

He looked respectfully towards his master before turning to the two young men.

“Oh? Xiao Ran? I have some impression of you. What are you here for?”

The eyes of one of the young men lit up as he asked with a faint smile.

“I’m here to seek grievances for myself. Please bring us to where the Elders of the clan are!” Xiao Ran said solemnly to the two young men.

“Looking for the Elders? Today’s the eighteenth birthday of Young Master Xiao Fan and most of the Elders are there currently. Let us bring you over!” The two young men smiled and answered Xiao Ran.

“Alright!”

Xiao Ran nodded his head emotionlessly and looked towards Wang Xian.

Wang Xian smiled in response and nodded his head before following the two young men in.

“Master, something isn’t right!” Xiao Ran leaned towards Wang Xian and commented solemnly.

“We will deal with it when the time comes. Let’s see what tricks they are up to!” replied Wang Xian plainly.

He had let the skinny old man off to tip off the clan. As such, this matter wouldn’t be as simple as it might seem.

Moreover, the two young men that led them in were too casual. Everything was so smooth that it felt a little strange.

Even the young Xiao Ran found it to be weird.

However, Wang Xian wasn’t too concerned. In the face of absolute strength, so what if they were a Sacred Clan?

The mansion of the Xiao Clan was huge. After bypassing a pavilion and crossing a river, they arrived at a place with raucous noises.

A vintage-looking building appeared before them and peals of joyous laughter reverberated constantly from the building.

“They are right inside!”

The two young men turned around, faced Wang Xian’s and his group and revealed eerie smiles.

Hmm!

Wang Xian nodded his head calmly.

Hehe!

Just as they were about to approach the Welcome Banquet Block, the two young men laughed out creepily.

“Don’t kill us! Don’t kill us! Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown, please don’t kill us!”

“What? Our Xiao Clan has offended you and you are here to annihilate the clan? You... You... How arrogant! You must be courting death to be thinking of annihilating our Xiao Clan!”

“How dare you kill the disciples of the Xiao Clan? Our Xiao Clan will never let you off! The Elders in our clan will slay you. Don’t assume you are the strongest in the world just because you topped the Outstanding Young Heroes Chart!”

“Help!”

Suddenly, the two young men turned their bodies around, staring at Wang Xian and the group while smiling sheepishly at them. At the same time, they were screaming for help in a horrified tone.

The voices of the two men were exceptionally loud and soon reverberated across the radius of a thousand meters.

Their voices even overwhelmed the laughter of the crowd in the Welcome Banquet Block.

Voices in the Welcome Banquet Block died down after the screams of the two young men erupted. Soon after, several figures emerged from the building rapidly.

“Who dares to barge into our Xiao Clan?”

“Who! Who’s the one interrupting my son’s birthday celebration?”

“You must be too eager to die! Who’s Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown? He dares to kill the people of our Xiao Clan?”

Angry roars erupted from several places. The first few to arrive at the scene were the experts from the Liang Family. At the front of the pack, there was a wealthy-looking woman, an old man and the skinny old man who had his arm severed and cultivation crippled.

At this juncture, the three of them were glowering at Wang Xian while wearing cunning smiles.

Argh!

At this moment, it was as if the two young men were possessed by the greatest actors on earth. They turned around and ran towards the experts from the Liang Family while pretending to be horrified.

“They barged into our Xiao Clan and even declared that he will be annihilating us!”

“Haha, this is interesting!”

Wang Xian looked at the two pretentious young men with deep contempt.

He finally realized the plot of the other party. They were trying to label Wang Xian’s group with crimes they didn’t commit so they could kill them with reasons!

“Both of you really deserve death!”

Wang Xian stared harshly at the two young men trying to escape. As he waved his hand, two sharp spikes made of metal dragon energy shot towards the two young men.

Huh?

The wealthy-looking lady, old man, and the skinny old man were shocked to see Wang Xian attacking. Their smiles deepened and they were even more excited to see what Wang Xian had done.

They didn’t attempt to intercept Wang Xian’s attacks at all.

Argh!

Two pitiful cries reverberated across the hall. The two young men, who were acting, instantly felt the immense pain cruising through them from their backs. Their faces had turned as white as chalk.

When they turned their heads around, they saw Wang Xian looking at them with ridicule.

The two young men held onto their chests that were pierced through as they looked in the direction of the wealthy-looking lady. They were confused and desperately hoped she would extend aid to them.

However, the wealthy-looking woman simply grinned wickedly while staring at them.

Their eyes widened and were soon overwhelmed with desperation. Soon, they fell to the ground with remorse, confusion, and helplessness!

“Hehe! Great, great! He’s indeed Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown. How brazen of him to kill the people of the Sacred Clan on their home ground!”

The old man was ecstatic. This had just been a plot initially. However, it had now become the reality and things would get much easier from here onwards.

After killing the people from the Sacred Clan, the feud could no longer be resolved!

“Han Qing! Han Gu!”

At this moment, the Elders of the Xiao Clan had arrived and happened to witness Wang Xian striking and killing the two disciples of the Xiao Clan. One of the Elders growled furiously.

“How dare you kill the disciples of our Xiao Clan! You deserve death for barging into our Xiao Clan!”

The Elder glowered at Wang Xian and the group with strong killing intent.

“Should we strike?”

When the wealthy-looking lady witnessed the developments, she asked her father who was standing beside her.

“Wait a minute. This Miracle Doctor Wang is really arrogant. Let’s take a step back and see how things develop. This matter isn’t as complicated as we thought. Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown is just a man with brawn and no brain!”

The old man squinted his eyes and replied with a faint smile.

The matter had turned out completely different from their expectations. They had concluded that Wang Xian would be looking for the Elders of the Xiao Clan directly, showing them Xiao Ran’s talents and demanding a fair explanation from them.

It would now seem like the arrogant Miracle Doctor Wang wasn’t prepared to do those things. Instead, he adopted a brazen attitude towards the Xiao Clan and even killed the disciples from the Xiao Clan.

As such, they wouldn’t have to rush into taking actions against a guy who didn’t know what was best for him.

“Deserves death? Some people in the Xiao Clan are indeed deserving of death! Today, I have brought my disciple here to seek revenge!” Wang Xian responded calmly. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

They would have never understood that the actions of the strong weren’t something they could predict with certainty!
