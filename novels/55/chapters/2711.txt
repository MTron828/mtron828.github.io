2712 Under the terrifying parasitism of 27

“The Order of the Abyss monarch!”

Just as the poison manufacturing department was preparing to take action under the lead of the eight-limbed demonic fiend, Wang Xian, who was standing at the edge of the Abyss, heard their words and raised his eyebrows slightly.

“It seems that the invasion this time is controlled by the abyss seeds of the void God realm. I wonder how many of them are there.”

Wang Xian muttered.

“Dragon King.”

Twenty minutes later, Ao Yao and the rest flew over and shouted at Wang Xian.

“Let’s go. Let’s find a place to wait.”

He said to Ao Yao and flew back.

He found a meteorite and built a temporary residence.

He did not go to the Empress Star. The main reason was that it would take more than two days to fly there.

Opening the AI to take a look, the abyss war seemed to be preparing for a long battle.

Within the Emperor Star Field, there were over 300,000 undying emperors, countless eternal god Lord level warriors had arrived and entered the abyss battlefield.

They formed a small team with the Emperor Court’s warriors and fought within the Abyss.

The heroes list was officially opened, ranking based on the amount of merit.

The Undying Emperor Level 1 abyss seed was one merit, Level 210 merit, and so on.

The current number one was heavenly sword emperor, with over 100 million merit points.

When everyone had just arrived at the Abyss battlefield, this meant that Heavenly Sword Emperor had killed an undying Emperor Level 9 abyss seed.

Of course, the current ranking wasn’t accurate, because many people might have killed the abyss seed, but they hadn’t exchanged it for merit points.

However, in this short half a month, many foreign powerhouses had fallen. The entire AI was extremely lively and everyone was discussing.

The Battle of the Abyss was not as simple as they had imagined. The merit points were not as easy as they had imagined.

Every day, many godly king powerhouses had fallen, including the powerhouses from the imperial court.

Wang Xian stayed at the temporary residence and looked at the AI every day. He would spend the rest of his time cultivating. It was not boring at all.

At this moment, in the Abyss, a group of Abyss races were scattered around a meteorite.

“Damn it, I’ve searched for five days and finally found a bone that I can chew on.”

Above a meteorite, Ba Qi stared coldly at a spot more than 100 million kilometers away.

There was an abyss race there. There were 100,000 of them and four level 8 undying Godly King Abyss race leaders.

“Brothers, we’ve checked the surroundings, there are no other races, we can act.”

At this time, Poison 9 flew over and reported to eight qi and Mo Sha.

“Very good, little ones, let’s go over, lock on to our targets when we get there. When I Say Act, attack immediately, give me some strength.”

Eight Qi said and flew straight ahead.

“Roar Roar!”

In front, a group of 100,000 abyss species looked over.

“Roar Roar!”

Demon Demon let out a light roar and wagged his tail, as though he was showing off.

“Roar Roar!”

The four undying emperor level 8 abyss species in the lead roared in response.

Living on the abyss species, eight Qi demon and the others used a few roars to convey some thoughts.

The message demon Sha sent was simple, many warriors of our race had been killed, they wanted to join your race, with you as their leader.

The 4 undying level 8 abyss species immediately agreed.

They responded.

“Howl Howl!”

The 8 Qi demon and the others flew over, their expressions friendly as they communicated with the 4 undying level 8 abyss species.

No, it should be flattery.

The two of them had already flown in front of the abyssal seeds and were still kissing up to them.

Beside them, poison nine was stunned at the scene.

“Alright, we can start now. Little Ones, kill them.”

Ba Qi, Mo Sha and the four abyssal seeds roared for a full 5 minutes before Ba Qi’s voice rang out.

“Peng!”

In the next moment, the abyss seeds they were living on exploded, revealing their true faces as they attacked the surrounding abyss seeds in front of them.

The 4 undying God King Abyss seeds a few hundred meters in front of them were still in a daze, 2 were immediately imprisoned while the other 2 were instantly killed.

The surrounding abyss seeds were also instantly killed by their sneak attacks.

After all, it was an undying level 9 killing level 8 and below, it was simply too easy.

The rest of the poison department members also suddenly attacked the group of Abyss species, easily destroying their opponents.

...

The entire battle only lasted for 5 seconds.

In 5 seconds, eight qi and the rest destroyed an entire group of Abyss species.

“Done, Hehe, this group of abyss species are really stupid. Now that they’ve discovered that the weaker ones are parasites, it’s pretty cool too, they can directly assassinate them, this group of stupid things didn’t even react.”

Mo Sha’s face was filled with excitement as he roared.

“Alright, immediately put away the corpses of these abyss species. Let’s continue fighting.”

“TSK TSK tsk, just this harvest alone can increase the strength of our subordinates by several times.”

Ba Qi also roared excitedly.

“Little ones, let’s continue moving.”

Their bodies moved and continued flying forward. They searched for a suitable abyss species and made a move to kill them.

Four days later, eight point demon and the others locked onto another race.

“The strongest undying level 7, a little more, 150,000, it’s barely enough, let’s go, kill them.”

...

“Pay attention, there’s a large race not far away, we can’t let them scream, we have to kill them within 5 seconds.”

This time, a 150,000 race, the leader level ones were only undying level 7.

Following the same pattern, the 8 Qi devil and 2,000 other abyss species flew towards that one.

Seeing their arrival, the group of Abyss species growled and warned.

The 8 qi and devil also responded.

The 7 or 8 undying emperor level 7 abyss species were stunned when they heard their roars. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

3 undying emperor level 8 abyss species were leading 2,000 underlings to join them.

And they were the boss?

This? What situation was this?

The group of Abyss species were dazed. However, when the eight point demon demon demon and the others arrived a few meters in front of them, the two of them moved.

Even at death, such an abyss species didn’t understand how they died.

“Keke Keke, what a group of pure and cute abyss species, I like it, Haha, quickly put away the corpse of the Abyss species, don’t let it be discovered.”

Mo sha cried out weirdly, his face full of excitement.

“Learn from them. You Don’t need to take any risks to be able to obtain such a harvest. Your boss Mo Sha and I are your role models.”

Ba Qi was teaching all his subordinates.

“The two big brothers are really amazing. They didn’t even waste a single soldier. They’re too amazing.”

Beside them, poison nine couldn’t help but flatter them.

The eight-headed spirit and the demonic fiend were indeed very powerful and shameless.
