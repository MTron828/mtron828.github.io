Chapter 451: Dragon Sect’s Killing Order (2)

Boom!

“No, don’t kill us. We surrender!”

When the remaining Dragonians charged over, the score of Inborn Experts from the eight forces screamed in horror.

Some of them even tried to flee with trepidation.

They ignored their dignity as a clan and as experts when they tried to flee far away.

However, the Dragonians were even faster than them as they flitted over and surrounded them.

“Kill!”

One of the Dragonians charged towards Qiao Clan and those Inborn Experts with a frosty and daunting demonic aura.

“It’s over, over!”

Upon seeing that Dragonian charging at him, fear filled Qiao Fuzi’s eyes.

That Dragonian was the one who had fought and defeated him within thirty moves in the arena just now. His strength was formidable.

“Kill!”

On the brink of life and death, Qiao Fuzi could only bite the bullet and explode all his might for his last fight.

“Trash!”

With a disdainful voice, that Dragonian’s palms slowly transformed into something horrifying.

As Qiao Fuzi witnessed the transformation, he was appalled. He wielded his sword directly at that Dragonian.

As the sword slashed at the dragon claws, it was caught by that Dragonian easily.

“Just you and you think you can kill our Dragon King? I was only playing with you just now in the arena!”

The Dragonian sneered as he raked his dragon claws across Qiao Fuzi’s body.

Argh!

With a huge change in his expression, Qiao Fuzi darted his sword at him.

Argh!

A petrifying shriek came from Qiao Fuzi when the dragon claws grabbed and crushed his body straightaway. Qiao Fuzi widened his eyes with fear.

Argh, argh!

At this time, he heard cries from the side. He tilted his head with the last trace of his vitality.

All he saw was the few elders of Qiao Clan and the various Inborn Experts getting killed.

Within less than one minute, more than ten Inborn Experts were struck down.

Cough, cough!

Qiao Fuzi spat out a mouthful of blood as his eyes were big and round, full of remorse.

As the most outstanding disciple of a Sacred Clan and the youngest Inborn Expert of the Qiao Clan, his bright future ended here.

“They are way too compelling. Fifty Dragon Sect disciples killed dozens of Inborn Experts in a split second. Gosh, all of them have strength that is close to Pinnacle Inborn, or are Pinnacle Inborns, themselves!”

“The Inborn Experts of Dragon Sect are way too domineering. All of them can transform their hands into daunting claws, which can actually resist the attacks of Inborn Spiritual Weapons. Their combat abilities are not those that any average Inborn can compare with!”

All the surrounding people twitched their eyebrows as they watched in fear as the Inborn Experts perished one by one.

The strength possessed by thirty Inborn Experts was almost equivalent to that of a Sacred Sect. Yet, all of them had been struck down one by one.

The Inborn Experts, who were striking awe just now, were being massacred.

Looking at those Dragonians who were exuding black demonic aura, all the surrounding crowd had awe in their eyes.

When they looked at that young man before the Dragonians, all they had was admiration and fear for him.

This is a new Sacred Sect and a terrifying one.

“They had mighty strength. They are even more compelling than the elder group of our Heavenly Sound Sect!”

When Elder Yang saw the group of Dragonians kneeling before that young man, he was already taken aback by horror.

Seeing those eight forces who had accepted the killing order from Medical Saint Sect getting massacred by them, his heart quivered.

If not for the strong opposition from Tang Yinxuan, they could be part of the group now.

Given the style of that Dragon Sect Master, so what if it was a Sacred Sect or Sacred Clan? Offend him, and all will die!

“They are really formidable!” Tang Yinxuan was astounded by the fifty Dragonians.

She knew Wang Xian was strong, but the last thing she could think of was him establishing a Sacred Sect of his own.

A strong ancestral sect that was on par with Heavenly Sound Sect.

Those forces and ancestral sects who knew about the mission counted themselves really lucky for not participating in it.

Fortunately, they did not do it.

“Young Lord, run now!”

Just then, another despairing scream was heard.

Everyone hurriedly spun around and saw two Dragonians besieging the Young Lord of Sea Serpent Island. He had lost his previous dashing aura and chillness now.

The person who proudly declared he was the champion of supreme talents in the arena just now had his hair spread out with a long wound on his arm. He looked awful as he fought with two disciples of Dragon Sect before him.

If the situation persisted, it would take no time for the Young Lord of Sea Serpent Island to be killed.

Seeing their Young Lord in danger, the two middle-aged men revealed desperate looks. They blocked the blows from Mo Qinglong and Mo Yuan with their maximum effort and struck at the two Dragonians before their Young Lord.

The two Dragonians had a slight change in their expressions and staggered back immediately. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“How dare you get distracted while fighting with me!”

Upon seeing that middle-aged man who got distracted, he snorted. A bout of demonic aura converged into a hideous dragon head that bit him on both his legs.

“Ah, scram now!”

That middle-aged man let out a cry as water on his body vibrated violently. With a malevolent look, he bellowed, “Old Bei, help me block this!”

“Got it!”

Relentlessness filled the face of another middle-aged man’s face as he struck Mo Qinglong and Mo Yuan. “I’ll fight it out with you guys. Our Lord will take revenge for us!”

“Go to hell!”

Seeing him charging alone at the duo, Mo Qinglong and Mo Yuan were looking bleak as they stretched out their Claws of the Devil Dragon and raked at him.

Argh, argh!

On the other side, another middle-aged man let out a deafening roar.

Immense blue energy flowed out and gushed towards the Ice Core round disc at the chest of the Young Lord of Sea Serpent Island.

A Half-Step to Dan Realm injected all of his energy into the Ice Core round disc.

The entire round disc was giving off a blue glow that solidified and surrounded them.

Within the blue glow, the Young Lord of Sea Serpent Island malevolently stared at Wang Xian with rage and hatred in his eyes.

“I’ll ask my father to kill you!”

The Young Lord of Sea Serpent Island let out a miserable cry when the blue Ice Core round disc enveloped him totally. Subsequently, he darted out into the sky at a terrifying speed.

His speed was almost ten times the speed of sound. Moving as though it was the speed of light, the blue glow flashed and disappeared with the Young Lord of Sea Serpent Island.

On the other hand, the middle-aged Half-Step to Dan Realm expert lost all the soul in his eyes as he collapsed on the ground.

Argh!

At this time, the other Half-step to Inborn who had blocked Mo Qinglong and Mo Yuan also let out a desperate shriek before he fell onto the ground with a thud.

“What’s that round disc? How was it able to spur such a crazy speed? That was fast. It felt like a teleport!”

“The two Half-Step to Dan Realm experts beside the Young Lord of Sea Serpent Island are dead!”

“In order to let the Young Lord of Sea Serpent Island escape, that... that Half-Step to Dan Realm actually sacrificed his life!”

“A Half-Step to Dan Realm sacrificed his life so that the Young Lord of Sea Serpent Island could escape through a piece of treasure. This price is simply too heavy to pay!”

“Gosh, the Young Lord of Sea Serpent Island managed to escape after paying such a price. The rest were unable to run away. Twenty-seven Inborns and two Half-Step to Dan Realm perished!”

The surrounding crowd was aghast in seeing this.

The newly established Dragon Sect issued a killing order, causing numerous casualties.

Wang Xian was unconcerned about the Young Lord of Sea Serpent Island making his escape.

The enemies from the sea were all trash in his eyes.

This was only the birth of the Dragon Sect. When the Dragon Palace emerged... Hiak, Hiak!
