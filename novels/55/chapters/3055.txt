Chapter 3056: 3055 who will kill who 2

Ice Soldier Corps, one of the three secret corps of the Ice Mountain race.

It was also the only corps hidden in the frozen continent.

In the ice mountain race, the people living on the frozen continent were usually ordinary people, and the surrounding icebergs were where the Ice Mountain Race’s powerhouses lived.

As the Secret Corps of the ice mountain race, they were hidden in a small town on the frozen continent.

The town had hundreds of thousands of residents. They lived here like ordinary people.

Each of them used an extremely special method to hide their strength.

“According to the information I received, there are only two ninth level divine emperor experts in the town today. The rest have left for the core area of the ice mountain race.”

“There’s a teleportation array in that room. Once there’s a problem, the experts of the ice mountain race can teleport here instantly.”

The ice continent was sealed day and night. However, the ice mountain race operated like a meteorite, causing the day and night to alternate.

As night came, the town was not very lively at night. Most of the people were in their own rooms.

Wang Xian leaned against a wall and looked at the surrounding buildings as he muttered.

“A level nine divine emperor is in a room beside the teleportation formation. I want to kill him instantly.”

His dragon eyes scanned the room and his figure slowly sank into the ice wall.

Wang Xian had eight attributes now. He could travel through objects with eight attributes. Naturally, the ice wall did not block him at all.

The process was smooth.

As the hidden army of the iceberg tribe, they did not involve any powerful formations or other protective measures.

This was because once they set up the formation, people would definitely notice the difference and suspect it.

As a secret army, it was necessary for everyone not to know about it.

Even Wang Xian learned about it from the son of an elder of the ice mountain tribe.

Only such a core figure could know about this place. It was obvious that there were less than a few hundred people in the entire ice mountain tribe who knew about the hiding place of the ice army.

“Let’s do it!”

When Wang Xian passed through the ice wall, he sensed that a figure was only about 5,000 meters away from him.

At such a distance, Wang Xian pushed his speed to the limit.

Buzz

The moment he rushed over, the old man who was sitting cross-legged in the room frowned.

The Futon that he was sitting on immediately emitted a glow.

“Die!”

Wang Xian’s expression changed slightly when he saw the futon below him forming an ice layer to protect the old man instantly.

“Realm-breaking!”

“Dragon Eye Lock on all corners!”

“Five Elemental Dragon Claw!”

He had a bad feeling when he saw the old man protected by the ice layer. He gritted his teeth and roared softly.

In an instant, Wang Xian unleashed all his supernatural powers.

Crack! Crack! Crack

The realm-breaking landed on the ice layer, and cracks appeared on it.

The Dragon Eye Lock on all corners struck the ice layer heavily, and the cracks grew bigger and bigger.

When Wang Xian’s dragon claw grabbed onto the surface of the Dragon Claw, a lot of the dragon scales were destroyed instantly. However, at this moment, he could only give it his all.

If he couldn’t kill this person, everything would be in vain.

A large amount of blood seeped out from the Dragon Claw and entered the Dragon Claw with great difficulty.

Gritting his teeth, he used all his strength to attack the old man inside.

“Who are you?”

Only then did the old man react. Looking at the Dragon Claw that was right in front of him, he roared sternly.

Layers of frost were sent towards Wang Xian’s Dragon Claw.

“Bam!”

Wang Xian felt a tremendous pain coming from the Dragon Claw. He clenched his teeth and clawed at the old man in the ice.

“PFFT!”

The Dragon Claw landed on the top of the old man’s head and quickly extinguished his life force.

“Cough, cough, cough.”

He was too close to the old man. Even with the protection of the Futon, he was still unable to escape. His life force was gone.

“Phew, I almost died here. This futon is at least a defensive treasure at the peak of the Divine Emperor Realm. Just its passive protection almost caused me to fail.”

Wang Xian looked at the futon below and his eyes sparkled.

The old man didn’t even have time to react before the FUTON he was sitting on automatically defended itself.

If the old man reacted and took the initiative to control the Futon, he would definitely not be able to kill the old man.

“As long as I kill one, the rest will be simple.”

He hesitated for a moment and didn’t take this futon away. He was afraid that he would trigger some traps.

His body moved and Wang Xian immediately flew towards the next target.

The next target was located on the other side of the town. He was disguised as an old man.

Perhaps they didn’t expect that someone would find out about their situation and attack them. This time, Wang Xian’s assassination went relatively smoothly.

Under his extreme speed, coupled with the power of light and darkness, he could easily kill an expert of the same level.

“There’s no need to worry too much from now on!” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Two experts of the ice troop of the level nine celestial thearch race were killed. There was nothing that could threaten him from now on.

He shuttled through the small town like a ghost.

The night was quiet. The lives of the experts of the ice troop were quickly harvested.

In the end, nearly 5,000 ice soldiers, all of whom were at least at the fourth level of the divine emperor realm, were all killed.

“Next, it’s the Icebound Army.”

Wang Xian muttered. He teleported and disappeared from this small town.

With his current understanding of the Ice Mountain race, he teleported to a very secret place.

“The icebound army is located on that Ice Mountain. There are hundreds of thousands of members of the icebound army and more than 10,000 of the Divine Emperor Realm.”

“The entire iceberg has a strong defense. However, I have figured out the way to enter over the past few days.”

A smile appeared on Wang Xian’s face as he flew towards the Icebound Legion immediately.

“Oh no, something has happened to the Icebound Legion!”

Just as Wang Xian was flying towards the icebound legion, he was on the largest iceberg beside the icebound continent.

An old man saw that the divine tokens in front of him were beginning to crack. His expression changed drastically as he stood up and shouted loudly.

He immediately passed this news to the clan leader and the other experts in the clan.

The icebound army was one of the secret armies of the icebound race. There weren’t many people in the entire army, but they were all elites.

It was one of the trump cards of the icebound race to deter other races.

Now, all their trump cards had been shattered. This meant that they had been killed.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

Very soon, terrifying figures flew out from the Ice Mountain and flew towards the frozen continent.

“Die!”

At this moment, Wang Xian, who had already entered the location of the frozen corps, didn’t launch a sneak attack this time. Instead, he launched an all-round attack.

Waves of terrifying destructive power swept across the surroundings in an instant.

At night, many experts of the icebound army were either resting or cultivating. As the energy swept past, they died rapidly.

“Who is it!”

“Not good, someone is attacking!”

The expression of the expert on the iceberg where the icebound army was located changed drastically as he shouted sternly.

“Explode!”

Wang Xian shouted angrily. The entire iceberg began to collapse. Only a level eight divine emperor or above could survive his attack.

“Let’s Go!”

After everything was done, his figure disappeared instantly and he returned to the Dragon Palace.
