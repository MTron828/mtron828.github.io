“Golden Stream!”

In the sky of the wilderness, Wang Xian waved his arm and a ray of Scarlet Golden Light shot towards Ling Zilin.

The Ray of light was extremely beautiful and didn’t seem to have any lethality.

“Awoo!”

However, Ling Zilin let out a miserable cry from the side. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

At this moment, Ling Zilin’s entire body was in an extremely miserable state. There wasn’t a single part of him that was fine.

He could neither escape nor defeat him. Ling Zilin had completely become a tempering stone for Wang Xian. A series of combination skills were launched at Ling Zilin.

“It’s about time!”

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered as a hint of killing intent appeared in his eyes.

“Roar!”

Ling Zilin was floating in the sky in front of him. He stared coldly at Wang Xian as he breathed heavily.

Even though it was heavily injured, the spirit Zilin still looked extremely ferocious.

“Oh? That’s right!”

Looking at the Spirit Zilin’s mighty appearance, Wang Xian suddenly had a thought. He was a little tempted when he thought of the heritage of the Hundred Beasts City’s Old Man Bai Xun as a Beast Tamer.

He stared at the Spirit Zilin. A fifty-meter-tall figure was circling around it. A powerful dragon’s might was pressing down on it.

“Roar! Roar!”

The Spirit Purple Qilin, who was lying in the air, kept roaring. Some of the beast taming techniques flashed across Wang Xian’s mind.

A Beast Tamer wanted to plant a seed in the mind of a ferocious beast. This seed was not like Wang Xian’s blood essence, which allowed him to have 100% control over it.

He wanted to plant the seed of ‘I am your king’. When the seed entered the mind of the ferocious beast, it would be like a group of people.

This beast would instinctively think that you are my king, and I have to obey your orders.

This needed to be suppressed using the method of bloodline.

The Hundred Patrol Elders’Beast Tamer had learned from the beasts controlling the Beast Group.

If you wanted to subdue a beast, you had to have a powerful bloodline and use it to suppress the other party’s bloodline.

If the other party’s bloodline was stronger than his, it was basically impossible to subdue him.

Beast Tamers were different from those warriors who had mounts and pets.

Those warriors who had mounts and pets were the ones who had cultivated their feelings from the time when their mounts and pets were young so that they could subdue them.

Beast Tamers were completely suppressing them.

Wang Xian circled around the spirit purple qilin and looked down at him with his head held high. The Aura that was originally filled with killing intent slowly became amiable.

A kind of gentle and lofty aura rushed into its mind.

Wang Xian waved his dragon claw and a Wisp of blood flew toward the Spirit Zilin Beast. It slowly floated above its head.

“Roar!”

The Spirit Zilin sensed the aura coming from Wang Xian. It let out a low roar and stared at him vigilantly.

Wang Xian didn’t make a move. According to the techniques inherited by the Beast Tamer, he subjugated the Spirit Zilin beast bit by bit.

As a divine dragon, it was easier for Wang Xian to tame ferocious beasts and demonic beasts than it was for the hundred patrol elders.

As a member of the Divine Dragon Clan, he possessed a top-notch bloodline. Any ferocious beast could feel the aura of a king from his bloodline.

“Awoo!”

Wang Xian stared coldly at Ling Zilin. The terrifying aura kept attacking it.

Ling Zilin let out two low growls and slowly lay down in the air.

After more than ten minutes, it raised its head and looked at Wang Xian in awe. Finally, its gaze landed on the drop of blood.

“Awoo!”

In the end, Ling Zilin lowered its head towards Wang Xian to show its submission.

“I’ve succeeded. It’s much easier than I thought!”

Wang Xian revealed a delighted expression.

“It must be because I gave it a good beating and almost killed it!”

Wang Xian thought to himself. If he wanted to tame a wild beast, he had to first subdue it with his strength and then suppress it with his soul.

Subjugating a void interpretation level beast made Wang Xian feel great.

Ling Zilin’s strength was still very strong. Even among the first level of the void interpretation level, it was still very strong.

After subjugating it, it would be a very powerful combat strength.

“Don’t move. I’ll test the power of that dual-attribute healing ability!”

Wang Xian stared at Ling Zilin. His body moved and a blue-green light appeared in front of him.

The light slowly condensed into a liquid state and covered an area of about 2,000 meters.

Wang Xian had a thought. The blue-green liquid slowly shrank and finally fell towards Ling Zilin.

“Awoo!”

The blue-green liquid fell into Ling Zilin’s body, causing his injuries to heal at a terrifying speed.

In less than ten seconds, almost all the injuries on Ling Zilin’s body were healed.

“Let’s take a break!”

Wang Xian moved his body and returned to his human form. He came to Ling Zilin’s side.

“Awoo!”

Ling Zilin lowered his head towards Wang Xian and was extremely respectful.

Wang Xian revealed a faint smile on his face. In the future, Ling Zilin would be his loyal subordinate.

As long as it didn’t encounter any special circumstances, it wouldn’t dare to disobey Wang Xian’s orders.

“Get Down!”

Wang Xian moved his body and rode directly on Ling Zilin’s body. A four-meter-long mount was just right for him to ride on.

After patting Ling Zilin’s body, it landed on the ground and started to recover.

Wang Xian was also sitting cross-legged at the side to recover the energy he had consumed and to sort out the combat techniques with various combinations of attributes.

“The combination of the two attributes is indeed very powerful. However, the downside is that it is too obvious. Others will be able to tell how many attributes you have used. It will cause a huge sensation and even bring danger!”

Wang Xian thought to himself. It would be fine if he had two attributes. If others saw it, they would only think that he was a Peerless Heaven’s favorite.

However, if he displayed five attributes, it would arouse other suspicions.

“I remember there is an item in the system’s Dragon Palace’s Treasure Trove. It can hide some of my attributes and even deceive me!”

Wang Xian thought to himself. With a thought, he checked the system store.

“Found it. Heaven-deceiving pearl. It can change the aura fluctuation of the attacks I release!”

Wang Xian revealed a faint smile. With this heaven-deceiving pearl, he could use all kinds of combinations of combat skills without restraint.

“10,000 dragon crystals. The price is really not cheap!”

Wang Xian looked at the exchange price and directly exchanged it.

A colorful pearl appeared in his hand. The Pearl was the size of a fist.

Wang Xian opened his mouth and swallowed it.

“Phew!”

He casually released a flame. Under the heaven-deceiving bead, he saw a water sword.

“This heaven-deceiving bead also has a surprise attack effect. It’s pretty good!”

Wang Xian thought to himself as he sat cross-legged to recover his energy.

Two hours later, Wang Xian stood up. Ling Zilin, who was lying on the ground, also stood up.

Standing next to the first level void interpretation beast, Wang Xian exuded a strong aura.

“Let’s go to the front!”

Wang Xian sat on Ling Zilin and patted its head before flying forward.

“Roar!”

Ling Zilin let out a roar and flew straight into the sky!

Its mighty body exuded a strong aura!
