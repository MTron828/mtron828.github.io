Chapter 334: Mission At The Yellow River

The three young men at the door looked blankly at this scene.

Sun Lingxiu was their goddess and was referred to as the Holy Goddess from Jiang Bei by the entire medical world. At this moment, she was acting so lovingly with a young man!

Even an idiot would be able to see in her eyes her love and interest for the young man.

Moreover, what Miracle Doctor Sun had said had crushed their hearts.

In their faces, she called them three good-for-nothings.

She even asked the young man if the three of them had offended him. If they had, would she throw them out?

On top of it, the response from the young man infuriated them further. The three door guards are pretty good?

Door guards?

The trio pulled a long face, stood there and were shivering a little from anger.

When they saw their dream goddess pouring tea for that young man enthusiastically while treating them coldly, they even had the thought of dying.

“Who’s that guy? Why is our Holy Goddess treating him so warmingly?” a young man growled in a low voice. He stared bitterly into the medical hall and clenched his fist tightly.

However, he didn’t dare to charge in or question.

The reputation of the Divine Dragon Medical Hall was known throughout the Underworld. The title of Holy Goddess and Miracle Doctor Sun wasn’t just approval for her medical skills. It was also a recognition of the strength she possessed.

Five days ago, an Elder of a First-class Force had come to seek treatment. The Elder agreed to pay six spiritual stone but refused to pay up after treatment.

The Elder from the First-class Force was then finished off by the Blood Man at ground floor.

The First-class Force was infuriated and sent two Inborn experts to take revenge on the Divine Dragon Medical Hall.

In the end, the two Inborn experts never left the place.

From that day onwards, everyone was shocked to realize that not only did the Holy Goddess, Miracle Doctor Sun, have incredible medical skills, but she also possessed horrifying strength.

She would at least be at the Inborn-level.

Since then, no one dared to kick up a ruckus in the Divine Dragon Medical Hall.

As for the Holy Goddess, Miracle Doctor Sun, she made it to the fifth rank on the Miracle Doctors Chart, an extremely high ranking, within ten days!

The expressions on the three young men changed rapidly. In the end, they walked out bitterly.

“The business is really good!” Wang Xian looked at Sun Lingxiu and commented with a smile.

“Yeah, it’s pretty good. We have patients from all over the world coming here to seek treatment each day.” Sun Lingxiu revealed a joyous smile. “However, we rarely get payments with spiritual stones!”

Wang Xian didn’t mind and shook his head as he replied, “It must have been tough on you.”

“Not at all. I’m really happy with the way I’m living now!” Sun Lingxiu replied contentedly. “Xiao Xian, wait a minute for me. Let me treat a patient in the medical hall first!”

Looking at Sun Lingxiu’s sincere expression, Wang Xian was taken aback and quickly looked around him.

There was an isolated space near the window. Wang Xian walked over and saw a pink bolster.

He smiled gently and switched on the computer by the side.

After entering the Underworld website, Wang Xian started browsing.

He had various types of elixir pills and wanted to sell them.

One couldn’t put things up for sale on the Underworld website. If one wished to sell something, he had to find the buyer himself.

Wang Xian did find people looking to purchase elixir pills. However, these buyers were only looking for a single pill. Therefore, he ignored the request.

When he clicked into the Miracle Doctors Chart, he was surprised to find Sun Lingxiu reaching the fifth rank on the Miracle Doctors Chart.

“Doctor Sun, this is our invitation letter. Our guys will be here to receive you two days from now!”

At this moment, the voice of a middle-aged man came from outside the medical hall.

“Alright, I’ll be there on time!”

“Thank you, Doctor Sun!”

The middle-aged man left quickly and Sun Lingxiu walked in with an invitation letter.

Wang Xian looked at it inquisitively.

“This is an invitation letter from our country. They discovered a strange creature and a virus on a plain beside Huangqi City near the Yellow River. If one were bitten by the creature, he would definitely be dead. Furthermore, they found strong venom within the river water!”

“Several hundreds of people had died and the place is now cordoned off. There’s a need to find the reason for it soon or the virus might spread to other places!”

“Three days ago, the representatives of our country came to invite me. Once this incident is settled, they will give me a Light Attribute Spiritual Ball,” Sun Lingxiu explained to Wang Xian.

“Oh? Strange creatures and viruses?”

Wang Xian was surprised.

“You can’t really call them strange creatures or viruses. Instead, the creatures there have undergone a horrifying mutation. Currently, the top mission in the Underworld is also regarding this. If one could help resolve this matter, he could enter the National Treasury and choose two items to his liking.

Sun Lingxiu looked at Wang Xian and continued, “Xiao Xian, are you interested in going to take a look?” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“I can enter the National Treasury and choose any two items?” Wang Xian was shocked to hear Sun Lingxiu.

If there was ever a place with lots of treasures, it was the National Treasury. Considering that the country had issued the mission on the Underworld website, it would mean that there were things useful for Martial Artists.

It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that there would be lots of Inborn level weapons in the National Treasury.

It was said that there were two to three of the ten famed swords kept within the National Museum.

Besides weapons, there should be other powerful artifacts. These artifacts would likely draw the fervent attention of Inborn experts.

Wang Xian was dumbfounded.

There should be alchemy furnaces in the National Treasury. Moreover, the level of the alchemy furnace I can find there should be pretty high! Wang Xian thought to himself. He immediately clicked into the thread of the mission on the Underworld website.

Just as Sun Lingxiu had explained, the country had issued a mission regarding an incident that happened at Huangqi City near the Yellow River.

Anyone who could identify the cause of the incident would be allowed to take one item from the National Treasury.

If one could resolve the incident, he could take any two items of his liking.

The reward for this mission could be considered really handsome. Wang Xian was almost certain that the reward for this mission would be an object at the level of an Inborn Spiritual Weapon.

Naturally, no one would stop you if you did not wish to take any of these priceless treasures after entering the National Treasury.

Even the experts in the Sacred Sects will likely be attracted by this mission. Moreover, the country even invited and promised various Miracle Doctors various items on top of issuing the mission to the Underworld. This mission is likely not as simple as it might seem, Wang Xian thought to himself. However, after pondering, he still decided to give it a try.

If he could succeed and get a powerful alchemy furnace, it would be much easier for him to refine higher level elixir pills.

“Alright! Let’s go together!” Wang Xian said to Sun Lingxiu.

“Alright, let’s go together. Xiao Xian, these are some pictures and information on the situation of the sealed village near the Yellow River. You can take a look first.

Sun Lingxiu took out a file by the side and handed it to Wang Xian.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded his head and opened up the file. When he saw the pictures in the file, he was taken aback.
