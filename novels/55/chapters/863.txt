“What a tough mouth. They can’t get any useful information out of us!”

“They’re not strong and tough-mouthed. They all committed suicide!”

Soon, everyone frowned. They looked a little embarrassed as they looked at the corpses of more than a dozen creatures.

“Let’s go. We’ll explore on our own. Be careful!”

The young man with a gloomy face raised his head and looked at the sky. “This place isn’t very deep. Let’s go out and take a look first!”

The group of people moved and flew into the sky.

...

However, at this moment, Wang Xian didn’t know that there were already people from the supernatural continent who had entered Earth by chance.

There were more than a dozen of them. Each of them had extraordinary strength. With their strength, they were able to set off a huge storm across the entire earth.

“Dragon King, more than a dozen yakshas patrolling the sea at the entrance to the supernatural continent have been killed!”

The next day, in the Dragon King’s Palace, Prime Minister Gui and ao Yaksha suddenly came to report.

“Huh? What Happened?”

Wang Xian was looking at the sketch of the underwater city. He raised his head in astonishment and asked.

“According to the injuries on the yakshas, they were subdued with one move. There are a lot of injuries on their bodies. They should be interrogated. More than a dozen yakshas were the same. The strength of the other party should have reached the supernatural realm!”

Prime Minister GUI said with a slight frown.

There should not be too many people on Earth who had reached the extraordinary realm.

Only two years had passed since the spiritual energy impact. There were absolutely no more than three people who had the opportunity to enter the extraordinary realm, except for the members of the Dragon Palace.

However, even now, there were only fourteen extraordinary people in the Dragon Palace.

This was even after including Guan Shuqing, Lan Qingyue, elder fan, Sun Lingxiu, and a Jiaya.

Other than them, Ao Yao, Prime Minister Gui, Ao Qitian, Ao Qi, ao nu, ao shrimp, ao crab, plus him, Ba Qi, and Kun, there were a total of 14 transcendents.

It was not so easy to reach the transcendence realm. It would take at least two to three years for more transcendents to flood into the Dragon Palace.

Currently, there were many celestial beings in the Dragon Palace. There were 600 of them.

“He was easily killed at the entrance of the transcendence continent and was even interrogated?”

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered as he slowly turned solemn. A faint sense of danger was transmitted to him.

Could it be?

He shook his head. It would be terrible if the experts from the transcendence continent really came to earth.

With his current strength, he should be able to fight against an existence at level three or four of the supernatural realm. If he was stronger, it would be difficult to deal with him.

Not to mention such a terrifying existence at the insightful void realm. He could kill him with one hand!

“Mobilize the forces of the Dragon Palace to investigate the ocean. Then, pay close attention to the matters on the continent!”

Wang Xian said with a solemn face.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Prime Minister Gui nodded his head. He knew the seriousness of this matter.

If it was really an expert from the supernatural continent, the small earth would not be enough for them to deal with!

“I hope nothing bad will happen!”

Wang Xian thought to himself.

As it was an expert from the supernatural continent who had come to Earth, Wang Xian felt a sense of urgency. In the next few days, he began to focus on his cultivation.

Now that he had gathered the five elemental dragon beads, the fire dragon bead, water dragon bead, and wood dragon bead had reached the level of level one of the supernatural realm.

He still needed 60 dragon crystals to reach level two of the supernatural realm.

Seven days later, Prime Minister Gui sent a piece of bad news.

The western divine realm had been unified!

“The ancient God has returned. He has subdued all the Divine Realms, unified the west, and established the Sacred Glory Empire!”

When Prime Minister Gui told Wang Xian about this news, he was stunned for a moment. A look of astonishment appeared on his face.

“The ancient gods have returned?”

“Yes!”

Prime Minister Gui nodded his head. “According to the news that the strange demon received from the west, more than ten ancient gods have returned. They have swept across the entire west with endless divine might. Just their imposing manner alone can not hold them back!”

“More than ten ancient gods have established the sacred glory empire to unify the entire Earth!”

Wang Xian was slightly taken aback.

More than ten ancient gods had established the sacred glory empire to unify the Earth!

Now, Wang Xian could basically confirm that these people were the powerhouses from the supernatural continent.

As for the ancient gods? F * ck, those powerhouses from the supernatural continent were really interesting. They called themselves the ancient gods.

This operation was really impressive!

“According to our analysis, the strength of this group of people is definitely not too strong. However, they have also reached the supernatural realm. We might not be their match!”

Prime Minister Gui analyzed.

“Is that so?”

Wang Xian revealed a contemplative look. If the strength of this group of people had reached the level of eight or nine supernatural realm, or even the level of insight void, there was no need for them to say that they were the ancient gods.

They had directly suppressed and swept across the entire earth!

Now, they were actually pretending to be the ancient gods. They were really good at it.

However, since they had not seen their true strength, they could not make a blind judgment. Even if they were not super powerhouses, their strength was not something that the Dragon Palace could easily deal with.

“Investigate their strength. After figuring out their strength, we will look for ways to deal with them!”

Wang Xian immediately said to Prime Minister Gui.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Prime Minister Gui nodded his head.

“An expert from the transcendental continent. This is the first time I have come into contact with someone from the transcendental continent!”

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered. Feng Luan was not considered an expert from the transcendental continent because she had been dead for many years.

If they were not very strong, they would be able to obtain a lot of information from this group of people.

Another three days passed. The Holy Glory Empire was established in the west. Its terrifying power made everyone tremble.

Buzz! Buzz

At this moment, a special sound came from the Dragon Palace. Following that, an extremely bright light flashed across the Dragon Palace.

Wang Xian was slightly stunned. A look of astonishment appeared on his face. With a move of his body, he instantly arrived at the location of the Dragon Pool.

“The cultivation is complete!”

Wang Xian’s eyes were fixed on the spot below him. His eyes were sparkling.

At the spot below, the body of the Ao Yao did not change much. However, its two arms had changed from the sharp claws to a claw and a Sickle!

The claws were like White Aurora while the sickle was like a condensed white light.

It did not look like a real life form.

In fact, even the entire body of the strange demon did not seem to be real. It was like an illusory light.

It seemed to be formed from a ball of white light.

Ao Yaoyao stood up slowly and looked at Wang Xian. “Dragon King!”

His voice rang out. Following that, Wang Xian saw his figure appearing in front of him.

Such terrifying speed!

It was as though he had penetrated through the rock wall of the Dragon Cave and appeared beside him.

His body penetrated through the rock wall?

Such incredible speed?

Wang Xian stared at Ao Yao and thought of something.

Light Spike: Divine Dragon Transformation of light (level one transcendence)

Walking in the light, the Light Walker, the assassin during the day.
