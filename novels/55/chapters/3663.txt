3664 3663, the old witch had a chance to achieve a breakthrough

Buzz

The old witch had absorbed Wang Xian’s blood essence and was sent to the Dragon Palace by Wang Xian. He then summoned his divine kingdom to the Dragon Palace!

This was equivalent to Wang Xian’s dragon palace suppressing the old witch’s divine kingdom!

Coupled with the control of the Divine Dragon’s blood essence, unless the old witch’s strength far exceeded Wang Xian’s, her life would always be in Wang Xian’s hands!

“Greetings, Dragon King!”

Summoning her again, the old witch bowed respectfully to Wang Xian!

Since her life was in Wang Xian’s hands, she naturally knew what she should do!

“I have some healing treasures here. Let Me Heal My Injuries First!”

Wang Xian moved his palm and a large amount of vitality fluid appeared in front of him!

“Vitality fluid, the vitality fluid of the elves!”

The old witch’s eyes lit up when she saw this. She quickly bowed and thanked him, “Thank you, Dragon King!”

“Dragon King, I can’t fully recover my strength now. I need to split another body to support my strength. Otherwise, once I recover to my peak, I will lose my mind and become a battle machine. It will be very troublesome to recover again!”

She raised her head and continued to speak to Wang Xian!

“Okay!”

Wang Xian nodded his head slightly. After hesitating for a moment, he moved his palm and took out many fruits of the eternal fetus.

“While you are recovering, use the fruits of the eternal fetus to strengthen your mind and see if you can solve the problem of becoming a lunatic!”

He instructed the old witch! Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Thank you, Dragon King! Thank you, Dragon King!”

The old witch looked at the over 100 fruits in front of her, her eyes burning with passion!

Over 100 Pinnacle Universe Knight Fruits were worth a lot!

The old witch moved her palm and the life force liquid poured into her body!

The life force liquid was a treasure of the ELF race, a healing treasure condensed from ancient Lake Moon Bay, a treasure of a pinnacle race, it was naturally powerful!

It was a piece of cake to heal the old witch’s injuries!

A large amount of the elixir of life surged into her body, causing her aura to increase crazily!

The speed of the increase in her strength surprised even Wang Xian!

When her strength had reached a certain level, the old witch’s expression started to distort and she started to look ferocious. Her body trembled violently and her energy started to go out of control!

She quickly consumed the fruits one by one!

After consuming the fruits one by one, her aura stabilized once again!

Her strength continued to increase!

Whenever she could not control herself, she would consume the fruits!

If she consumed too many of the fruits, the effects would be reduced by a lot!

However, the reduction was still useful!

As time went by, the old witch’s strength became stronger and stronger. She was much stronger than when Wang Xian was fighting her!

“Dragon King, if I want to recover to my peak and not lose control, I might need more than a hundred fruits of the womb. The effects of consuming the fruits of the womb will be minimal when I consume them later on!”

After more than ten hours, the old witch said to Wang Xian!

“It’s alright, continue to consume them!”

Wang Xian moved his palm and took out more than a hundred fruits of the womb!

Although the value of persuading the fruits of the womb was very high, he had too many of them in his hands!

Even if he had to consume 200 fruits in exchange for the old witch’s peak strength, it was still worth it!

If the old witch could maintain her rationality, coupled with her strongest strength, there wouldn’t be many who could match her in the entire invincible zone!

The old witch continued to improve while Wang Xian watched quietly from the side!

Following the consumption of another 100 fruits, the old witch’s strength gradually reached its strongest state!

In the past, she would lose her rationality in this State!

She would become a crazy demon!

But now, she was still able to maintain all her rationality!

“Hu, I feel that my mind is very clear. I feel that it won’t be long before I can break through to the universe ruler realm. I’m going to break through, I’m going to break through!”

At this moment, the old witch suddenly shouted with a face full of excitement and trembling!

She sized up her body and tears welled up in her eyes!

She saw the path of cultivation ahead and the way to break through the shackles of the present!

“HMM? Are you confident of breaking through?”

Wang Xian was slightly taken aback as he looked at the old witch in astonishment!

“It’s the Dragon King. Yes, my mind and mind are very clear now. I’m also very clear about my future cultivation. I feel that I have great confidence in breaking through the shackles of the present. Perhaps… Maybe I will be able to break through completely without much money!”

The old witch said excitedly!

“Oh? That’s a good thing.”

Wang Xian was also a little surprised. Once the old witch broke through, it would be equivalent to the Dragon Palace having one more master of the universe!

Moreover, once the old witch broke through, she would probably have the strength of a Master of the universe at level two!

It would definitely be a great help!

“My breakthrough should be considered as using strength to break through 10,000 techniques. My strength is already strong enough. In the past, I couldn’t find the path to a breakthrough because my mind couldn’t keep up with it. Now that my mind is stable, I can see the path of cultivation ahead. In addition to my strong strength, I can definitely break through with strength.”

The old witch said excitedly as she knelt in front of Wang Xian. “Thank you for your help, Dragon King. I am extremely grateful. I will definitely devote the rest of my life to serve you!”

“Hehe, get up. This is also your own good fortune!”

Wang Xian was in a good mood as he nodded his head with a twinkle in his eyes!

It was not so easy to give birth to an expert who was at the level of a universe master!

Even if the experts of the dragon palace had cultivated to the peak of the Universe Knight realm, they would still need to comprehend and look for an opportunity to break through!

Even if the dragon palace had such a powerful and heaven-defying treasure like the seed of advancement, it would only be produced once every million years!

A million years would allow an expert of the Dragon Palace to break through!

If the Dragon Palace wanted to be truly powerful, they would still need to cultivate on their own!

“Let’s go. Follow me and sweep across the Invincible Zone!”

Wang Xian said to the old witch with a smile on his face!

The old witch bowed and stood by his side!

It was a pleasant surprise to subdue the old witch!

Next, he was still prepared to continue selling the fruits of servility.

Wang Xian brought the old witch’s veil and flew towards the trading ground!

While Wang Xian was rushing over, the battle between him and the old witch in the trading ground and the Invincible Zone had already caused a huge commotion!

“The old witch has captured the Dragon King’s clone and wants to use a curse spell to make the Dragon King submit to her and hand over the fruits. I wonder if she will succeed!”

“The old witch is the strongest wizard in the invincible zone. If she were to use her witchcraft in her lair to deal with the Dragon King, the Dragon King would be in deep trouble. There would be no room for him to fight back. I think the Dragon King is in deep trouble. After all, the one who attacked him is the old witch!”

“That’s right. After all, it’s the old witch. Her strength is much stronger than the forbidden spell of madness. Under the circumstances of a long-range curse, who can withstand it?”
