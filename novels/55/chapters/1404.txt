Chapter 1405: 1405 Xiaoyao city was destroyed

Everyone else was also completely stunned!

The sudden appearance of the water steward, a terrifying fifth-level profound void martial artist.

In addition to the Invincible City Lord, there were two fifth-level profound void martial artists guarding the city.

They weren’t afraid even when facing a fifth-level profound void martial artist.

However, in just an instant, when everyone’s faces were filled with excitement and excitement, the water steward was suddenly covered in energy.

Evidently, there was a Type 5 void interpretation expert that they did not see, and he was holding the butler back.

As for the city lord, he was instantly turned into a 50-meter-long creature.

“Run, run!”

All of the families and experts in Xiaoyao City were terrified, and all of the forces of the 7-8 dynasties revealed expressions of fear.

Without the city Lord and the rest, how could they fight.

If they fought, they would die.

Therefore, they could only run!

They ran crazily without any desire to fight!

“Leave no one alive!”

Ao Qitian roared and completely reversed what they had just said.

Just now, they had shouted that they would kill everyone in the Dragon Palace and leave no one alive!

Now, the Dragon Palace also changed back.

Bang

The huge ocean-pacifying needle smashed down.

The terrifying power instantly created a huge pit 1,000 meters in front of them.

In the pit, a rank one profound void realm expert died instantly!

“Young City Lord, run, run!”

The current butler of Xiaoyao City, a rank four profound void realm expert, came to the young city Lord’s side when he saw the battle. He grabbed his body and shouted.

“Run, yes, quickly run, quickly run!”

At this moment, the young city Lord’s face was extremely pale.

He completely lost the arrogance and arrogance from before, and his face was filled with panic as he shouted loudly.

Run, quickly run!

“Want to run? Can you escape? Today, everyone can forget about escaping!”

Mou Zesen’s voice sounded out, and a terrifying arrow shot out. The surrounding arrow aura directly annihilated over a dozen people, and directly attacked the young city lord.

“Damn it, hold him back. I’ll bring the young city Lord Away!”

The Xiaoyao City Butler who was protecting the young city lord shouted loudly.

However, no one paid attention to him.

He looked around, and his eyes instantly looked like they were about to split open!

In Xiaoyao City, including him, there were a total of five insightful void fourth-level void martial artists. Currently, all the fourth-level void martial artists were trapped by at least twenty powerful insightful void martial artists.

As for the third-level profound void martial artist, he was also surrounded by many profound void martial artists.

As for the first-level profound void martial artist, he was killed quickly.

Those who hadn’t reached the profound void martial stage, let alone the fourth-level profound void martial artist, were like lambs waiting to be slaughtered.

“Run? Where to?”

In less than a minute after the battle broke out, more than ten first-level profound void martial artists were killed!

As for the elites of Xiaoyao city, thousands of them were killed!

“Young city lord, be careful, stay behind me!”

The butler of Xiaoyao city shouted at the young city lord with cold sweat all over his face, facing Mu Zesen’s attack directly.

“Young City Lord?”

A golden swordfish at the profound void tier held a golden longsword, his eyes revealing a cold expression.

The longsword in his hand directly attacked the young city lord.

“No... No, no!”

The young city Lord’s face was filled with terror as he stared at the Longsword that was attacking him, and he shouted loudly.

“Weng!”

When the longsword landed in front of him, the protective array that his father had placed on his body was activated.

The protective array of the profound void tier 3!

“Brother, hand him over to me, I’ll kill him!”

At this moment, an angry voice came from behind him.

The Golden Swordfish turned around and looked at him with a smile on his face.

“Okay, I’ll leave him to you!”

As he spoke, he moved and charged toward the enemies of Xiaoyao City.

“You, you... You Lowly Fellow, you actually want to kill...”

The young city lord stared at Duan Jinming with his eyes wide open and roared loudly.

“Haha, in a while, our Dragon King will kill your father. Without your father, who do you think you are? You Call Me Lowly, but who do you think you are in front of me!”

Duan Jinming roared furiously, and ten arms appeared behind him in an instant.

Each arm was emitting golden light and fiery red flames.

He was like a mythical creature. He raised a fiery red flame hammer and directly attacked the young city lord.

“No, no... You Bastard, get lost!”

The young city lord shouted in terror.

“Hong!”

With a loud sound, the flame hammer landed on the array in front of him.

Ripples appeared on the array.

“Hong Hong Hong!”

Another three terrifying attacks. A strong killing intent shot out from Duan Jinming’s eyes.

“Crack! Crack!”

Soon, the sound of the array formation breaking was heard.

“No, no, don’t kill me!”

Seeing the array formation in front of him breaking, the young city Lord cried out for help with a face full of fear.

However, all the people of Xiaoyao City were being massacred by the members of the Dragon Palace. How could they have time to care about the young city Lord Now?

“Bing ‘er!”

At this moment, the mayor of Xiaoyao City heard his son begging for mercy in the sky. He widened his eyes and shouted coldly.

“If you want to kill my son, die!”

His entire body trembled. He waved his arm and a dazzling wind radiance seemed to be able to tear space apart as it slashed toward Duan Jinming!

“You dare to be distracted while fighting with me?”

On the opposite side, Wang Xian opened his mouth and the Five Elements Millstone appeared.

A stream of destructive energy attacked the wind radiance.

Buzz

The energy collided and the wind radiance vanished instantly.

“Suppress! Today, you shall be destroyed along with Xiaoyao City!”

Wang Xian roared loudly. The five elements millstone spun and streams of terrifying energy attacked the mayor of Xiaoyao City.

There were even streams of energy shooting towards the fourth-level insightful emptiness realm experts of Xiaoyao city below.

They were standing at a height of 10,000 meters while the rest of the insightful emptiness realm experts were at a height of 4,000 to 5,000 meters.

The entire sky above Xiaoyao city was like the end of the world.

“Be careful, be careful!”

At this moment, the fourth-level insightful emptiness realm experts who were battling with dozens of dragon palace experts below were horrified when they saw the destructive energy that was suddenly shooting towards them from the sky!

They let out a terrified roar!

“Ah!”

“Ah!”

However, there were still two fourth-level insightful void martial artists who were unable to dodge Wang Xian’s attack despite being besieged by the members of the Dragon Palace.

Two miserable shrieks echoed in the sky.

“What? How is this possible?”

At this moment, in the sky, the mayor of Xiaoyao City, who had hundreds of longswords revolving around him, was shocked when he saw the scene below him! DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Hehe, I can easily distract myself from dealing with you!”

Wang Xian swayed his huge body and spoke to the mayor of Xiaoyao city calmly.

The mayor of Xiaoyao City’s expression changed slightly. He took a deep breath and his eyes were filled with fighting spirit.

“Ah!”

At this moment, the young mayor’s desperate screams could be heard from below!
