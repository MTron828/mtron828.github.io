2626 2626’s attitude changed greatly

With the undying emperor level 8 abyss species as the leader, he led 5 to 6 million Abyss species towards the Dragon Palace’s Dragon Peak!

Everyone from the Bei Chuan Clan thought that the Dragon Palace would have to pay a heavy price, or even wipe out the entire army!

However the results shocked them!

Everyone was shocked as they watched the powerful warriors of the Dragon Palace swiftly hunt down the abyss species!

They looked at the gigantic mountain!

At this moment, they realized that the dragon palace was not as simple as they had imagined!

“All Disciples, Retreat!”

At this moment, a loud voice came from the center!

Everyone from the Bei Chuan sect came back to their senses!

“Retreat to the planet immediately!”

The Patriarch of the Bei Chuan sect looked at the Dragon Mountain in front of him and said to all the disciples!

“HMM? is the battle over?”

At this moment, Wang Xian, who was standing on the command platform of Long Feng, frowned slightly!

He was still thinking of continuing to kill!

In just a few short hours, the Dragon Palace’s harvest was too great!

Just the Undying Godly monarch abyss seed corpses alone had reached more than 6,000!

More than 6,000 undying godly monarch abyss seed corpses, what kind of concept was that?

It could increase the number of immortal King Disciples in the Dragon Palace, and it could also increase the number of experts in the Dragon Palace!

Eighteen Immortal King Level Seven Abyss seed corpses, and one level eight abyss seed corpse!

These gains were too great!

“Dragon King, we can still kill here for a while!”

The sky array saw the Beichuan sect experts retreat and the rest of the experts leave. He looked at the red dot on the array and said to Wang Xian!

“Alright, let’s continue to kill!”

Wang Xian nodded his head. The rewards were too great. It was fine to take some risks!

Furthermore, the sky array had a detection formation. Once a powerful abyssal seed came over, Long Feng could leave immediately!

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

Long Feng continued to charge towards the abyssal seed tribe. Arrows were being shot at the lives of the abyssal seed!

All the corpses were collected by the strange demon!

“They haven’t left yet?”

The Warriors of the Bei Chuan Clan returned to the planet, seeing that Long Feng was still charging towards the abyss races, they frowned!

“Inform the leader and deputy leader of the bei Shuang clan about this!”

The leader hesitated for a moment before ordering a disciple! 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The strength of the Dragon Palace had completely exceeded their expectations!

That powerful Dragon Peak was able to destroy an immortal king level 8 abyssal seed. Such combat strength was already something that the bei Chuan sect valued!

“Everyone from the Dragon Palace, be careful. Currently, there are no experts from other places restraining the abyssal seed. There might be powerful abyssal seeds rushing over!”

He hesitated for a moment before giving a reminder to the Dragon Peak!

“Thank you for the warning. Our Dragon Palace knows our limits!”

Wang Xian smiled faintly when he heard the warning from the Beichuan sect!

He looked ahead. Wherever Dragon Peak went, the abyssal seeds were quickly harvested!

In order to speed up, the Sky Formation activated the formations on Dragon Peak and attacked the abyssal seeds!

“Roar!”

In less than ten minutes, a roar came from the center!

When the sky array heard the roar, it looked at the formation in front of it!

“Dragon King, it’s time to retreat. A black dot is rushing in our direction rapidly. There are seven to eight immortal king level eight abyss seeds following behind!”

At this moment, the sky array immediately spoke to Wang Xian and controlled the Dragon Peak to fly out!

Wang Xian nodded his head slightly at the side and looked ahead!

Waves of heart-palpitating aura were slowly transmitted over!

He smiled faintly!

“The resources obtained this time are enough for the members of the Dragon Palace to improve tremendously. This is just the beginning!”

He muttered to himself. Wang Xian was prepared to pile up two immortal king level eight battle prowess with these resources!

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

Just as the Dragon Peak was flying out of the Abyss, the leader of the bei Chuan sect, bei Shuang, and the two patriarchs were flying over!

When they saw the huge peak flying over, their eyes were filled with astonishment!

...

“Old Liang, did the Dragon Palace really destroy a level eight abyssal seed?”

An old man could not help but ask the Beichuan sect patriarch beside him!

“How could I lie to You? The Dragon Peak of the Dragon Palace is very terrifying. There are many powerful weapons and formations set up on it!”

Bei Chuan Clan Leader looked at him, his gaze once again landing on the Dragon Mountain, his face filled with shock, “These weapons are too powerful!”

“There aren’t many weapons that can destroy a level 8 god King in the entire resplendent greater world!”

Bei Chuan clan leader muttered!

“Shuang ER, is your master’s Dragon Palace guarded by an undying god King Level 8 warrior? and an array master?”

An ancestor couldn’t help but ask curiously!

“I don’t know, but the Dragon Palace has a powerful array master!”

Bei Shuang shook her head!

She didn’t know much about the Dragon Palace either!

...

Weng

At this time, Long Feng came out of the Abyss and flew towards the space beside him!

“Let’s go and thank some of the Dragon Kings!”

The bei Chuan sect leader hesitated for a moment before flying towards Long Feng!

“We should thank them!”

The bei Chuan Sect Patriarchs nodded!

The Dragon Palace’s actions had killed many abyss seeds, which also saved many people from dying in the Bei Chuan sect!

One had to know that in every battle right now, at least 50 undying godly monarchs would fall!

As for the other disciples, every battle did not have less than 2 million!

The entire war was much more intense than they had imagined!

And with the Dragon Palace making a move, it would reduce the deaths of hundreds of thousands of bei Chuan sect disciples, as well as the deaths of over 20 god Kings!

Before, they had thought that the Dragon Palace would only send a few warriors over to take advantage of the chance to get some abyss seeds, not bringing them any trouble was already good enough!

Now it looked like they had been greatly helped!

This, they needed to go and thank them!

Another point was that the Dragon Palace had the ability to kill an undying level 8 abyss seed. This was enough for the Bei Chuan sect to value and treat them as equals!

“Dragon King, thank you for your help today!”

Just as Dragon Mountain stopped in mid air, the Bei Chuan sect leader and the rest flew over and cupped their hands towards Wang Xian who was on the commanding platform!

“Haha, we are doing this to obtain more abyss seeds!”

Wang Xian laughed out loud when he saw them flying over. He replied in a good mood!

“Dragon King, your war machines are really powerful. You can even kill an immortal king level eight abyss seed!”

An old ancestor sized up the dragon peak in astonishment!

“Hehe, if it weren’t for you powerhouses restraining the powerful abyss seeds, we wouldn’t dare to kill the Abyss seeds unscrupulously!”

Wang Xian smiled!

“This is also the strength of Your Dragon Palace, Dragon King!”

The people from the Bei Chuan Sect exchanged pleasantries with Wang Xian!

He could also feel that the attitude of the people from the Bei Chuan sect had changed significantly!

If it was because of bei Shuang that they were courteous to him in the past, it was now because of the strength of the Dragon Palace!
