Chapter 2981: Becoming a Dragon Knight in 1981? 7

“Dragon King, we have received all the news from the eight barrens and six directions!”

In the Dragon King Palace, the leaders of the dragon palaces were waiting for the news.

One of the dragon palaces in the eight barrens and six directions had been destroyed and the members of the dragon palaces had been killed. The Dragon Palace immediately sent people to check out the news.

“There are experts from the center of the universe who have entered the eight barrens and six directions. They seem to be divided into two races. One is the four-armed race and the other is the three-eyed race!”

“Their arrival should be related to the eight barrens. There is a figure from the four-armed race that seems to be the creator.”

“The actual strength of the two races is not very clear, but it is definitely not something that a level two divine emperor can compare to. Furthermore, their target is our Dragon Palace!”

“They want to take over our Dragon Palace and our Divine Dragon. Some of them even said that they want to subdue us as their mounts!”

Prime Minister Gui frowned slightly after receiving the messages and reported them one by one.

While he was talking, pictures floated in front of all the leaders of the Dragon Palace.

“F * ck, they want to tame the members of the Dragon Palace? Let us be their mounts. Dragon King, let’s go and kill them now!”

“F * ck, let’s go and torture them to death right now!”

When the irascible Ba Qi and Mo Sha saw this information, their faces were filled with anger and their bodies were filled with killing intent.

The rest of the leaders of the Dragon Palace also narrowed their eyes slightly, revealing a cold killing intent.

“The race at the center of the Universe? It is indeed the center of the universe.”

Wang Xian frowned slightly.

“An lie!”

He looked at an lie and said.

“Dragon King, I’m Here!”

An lie immediately cupped his hands and said.

“Go and check the strength of the other party first. After that, come back immediately!”

Wang Xian instructed an lie.

“It’s the Dragon King. Leave it to me!”

An lie nodded and disappeared in an instant.

“Dragon King, according to the information we received, the people from the two races at the center of the universe are coming for the Divine Dragon. As the races at the center of the universe, their strength is probably not something we can contend against.”

Prime Minister Gui also frowned and said.

Their current strength was very strong in the resplendent starry sky. However, compared to the forces at the center of the universe, they were still far from being comparable.

“As the Divine Dragon Race, we will definitely ascend to the stage of the universe and encounter some dangers. It’s just that I didn’t expect it to be so fast.”

“However, the powers of the races at the center of the universe are not very strong.”

Wang Xian recalled the division of the powers in the center of the universe in the Divine Dragon’s inheritance.

A race was considered to be the weakest. There were no existences at the level of a venerable.

However, even if they were weak, it was relative.

A race had over 10,000 divine emperors. The peak existences had the strength of a sixth or seventh level divine emperor.

They were much stronger than the Dragon Palace.

If the armies of the two tribes arrived, the Dragon Palace would be in danger.

They had to make some preparations!

“We’ll talk about it after an lie has finished investigating the strength of these people!”

Wang Xian said faintly.

According to the strength of the other party, the Dragon Palace had to make some preparations.

The leaders of the Dragon Palace nodded and waited for the news quietly.

The eight-limbed demon was playing with a poisonous dagger in his hand. He was filled with coldness.

“Dragon King, we have received the News!”

An lie was very fast. The dragon palaces were on several planets in the eight desolation six harmonies, but the three-eyed race and the four-armed race didn’t destroy them.

An lie teleported over and began to investigate with his teleportation ability.

With an Lie’s teleportation speed, he could finish investigating the entire eight desolation six harmonies in five minutes.

Based on the information he had just seen, he had locked onto the four-armed race and the three-eyed race.

“Dragon King, they are just a bunch of trash. They even want to destroy our Dragon Palace. They are boasting shamelessly that they want to tame us. Dragon King, let’s go kill them!”

As an lie spoke, he waved his arm and the display on the stone plate appeared.

There were red dots and black dots on it.

“There are only two level five void God realm experts and they dare to be so arrogant?”

The leaders of the Dragon Palace looked over and a strong killing intent immediately shot out from their eyes.

“TSK TSK TSK!”

Ba Qi and the rest laughed sinisterly and licked their tongues.

“Dragon King, let the Heaven Array work together with our poisonous horned dragon species. Let’s Go and destroy this bunch of fellows. I want to let them know the price of being arrogant!”

Mo Sha immediately said coldly.

In the current Dragon Palace, there were close to 8,000 divine emperor-level powerhouses. There were a total of 14 divine emperor-level fifth-stage powerhouses and Wang Xian. There were more than 100 divine emperor-level fourth-stage powerhouses.

With such strength, it was simply suicidal for two divine emperor-level Void Realm Powerhouses to make the members of the Dragon Palace use the Divine Dragon as a mount.

“Sure!”

Wang Xian squinted his eyes when he saw this data and nodded immediately.

“Eight-limbed demonic fiend, this time, not only do you want to destroy them, you also want to get all the information from them.”

“Now that the experts at the center of the universe are able to pass through the eight desolates and six harmonies, we have to understand enough information and be fully prepared.”

He continued to instruct.

“Don’t worry, Dragon King. Leave it to us, poisonous horned dragon seed!”

Eight Points Fiend and the other two nodded confidently.

“Let’s go. Let’s meet the experts from the center of the universe.”

Heaven Array revealed a smile and said to eight points and the others with a smile.

“Those two divine emperor level five combat strength fellows are still in the sky above the nine annihilation planet. The other group is rushing in our direction. Those tens of thousands of people should have already reached the domain of the heaven punishment ancient Heaven Domain.”

An lie reminded from the side.

“We will bring their corpses back very soon!”

Ba Qi and the others nodded and said with confidence.

Very soon, the heaven array and the ten thousand poisonous horned dragon species used the teleportation array to teleport to a dragon palace at the boundary between the Holy Region and the heaven punishment ancient Sky Domain.

Currently, the heaven punishment ancient Sky Domain did not have too many changes compared to before, except that there were fewer wars.

With the communication, some people in the heaven punishment ancient heaven domain also had artificial intelligence. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Some people also knew about the eight desolates and six harmonies.

They were discussing on the artificial intelligence curiously.

“This starfield is so troublesome. It’s a waste of our time.”

In the starry sky of the Heaven Punishment Ancient Heaven Domain, the four-armed race and the three-eyed race were crossing the void.

The heaven punishment ancient Sky Domain was occupied by many God emperors, so the teleportation arrays were blocked.

Some places could only be traveled by flying, which would waste a lot of time.

“We’ll be able to cross this star domain soon. Don’t worry. The Lair of the Dragon Palace is here. We Can’t run away!”

Some experts in the four-armed race were discussing.

“The Dragon Palace and the divine dragon are in our hands. It’s just that those guys are a bit troublesome!”

The experts of the four-armed race coldly glanced at Yang Xiaohun and the other four wolf beasts and said.
