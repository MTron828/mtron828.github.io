Chapter 745: 0746 panic assassination (3/5)

Translator: 549690339

Close the city gate, no disciple is allowed to leave the city!

When the middle-aged immortal God’s voice resounded, all the surrounding disciples of the Chaos Origin Immortal sect were stunned and their faces turned black.

Close the city gate, an immortal sect was forced to close the city gate and was prohibited from leaving the city!

This was simply the humiliation of the immortal sect!

The faces of the three immortal gods of the Chaos Origin Immortal sect were also very ugly.

More than 60 infant realm and more than 60 infant realm experts were blocking the position at the city gate. With the strength of their chaos origin immortal sect, they were completely incomparable to them.

Even if all the experts of the Chaos Origin Immortal sect were to charge out, it would still not be enough for the other party to kill them.

Moreover, their city rules forbade the immortal gods from attacking. As long as they attacked, it would violate the immortal God Treaty.

Not to mention the immortal God Treaty, the immortal gods hidden in the surroundings would also find it difficult to allow them to break through.

Even Ling Xiao was hidden in a corner around them.

The three of them could not make a move, and the more than 60 infant realm experts outside the city had crushed the entire chaotic origin immortal sect. They could only close the city gates.

Wait for them to leave.

This was a very shameful thing to do, but there was no other way.

“Our chaotic origin immortal sect will remember this matter. In the future, you will definitely pay a terrible price for what you did today!”

The three immortal gods of the Chaos Origin immortal sect were not willing to stay here any longer. After saying those words filled with killing intent, they snorted coldly and left.

“Close the city gates. No disciples are allowed to leave. Return to the city!”

An elder of the chaos origin immortal sect shouted in a low voice with an unsightly expression. His cold gaze swept across the crowd in front of the city gates before he turned around and left.

“Coward, why are you closing the city gates!”

“Come out if you have the guts, Turtle Immortal Sect!”

“Trash, you dare to assassinate our crown prince and his friends. Now, you don’t even dare to come out!”

Outside the city, a group of Yellow Heaven Immortal Sect’s Dan stage experts saw that they were actually going to close the city gate and mocked loudly.

Hearing the voices coming from behind, the top-tier experts from the chaos origin immortal sect trembled slightly.

They gritted their teeth and flew towards the immortal sect.

Out of sight, out of mind. They did not dare to enter the city gate. As long as they did, the immortal gods would be able to kill them instantly!

“Aren’t you all powerful? Come in if you have the guts!”

“Just barking outside. If you have the guts, come in. You’re a bunch of trash!”

Seeing the immortal God and the top-tier experts of the immortal sect leave, the disciples of the immortal sect felt a little hopeless.

This time, their immortal sect’s face was going to be lost for sure!

Therefore, they simply opened their mouths and started cursing outside.

Damn it, they couldn’t hold it in any longer. If they couldn’t win, then they would curse. In any case, it was already very embarrassing. So what if they were to lose a little more face?

“You actually still closed the city gates. You Bunch of cowards, if you have the guts, you can cower for the rest of your lives. If you have the guts, you can never come out again!”

“If you have the guts, you can always stay outside. Motherf * cker, do you want us to send you some tents and food? You Bunch of bastards!”

“MOTHERF * cker! You Don’t even dare to come out of your own home, yet you dare to bark at your own home. Aren’t you ashamed? We are all from the same immortal sect, and we are all ashamed of you!”

The Chaos Origin Immortal Sect, who had given up their dignity, and the Yellow Heaven Immortal Sect’s group of Dan stage experts began to curse.

For a moment, the entire chaos origin city was filled with all sorts of curses.

This caused the elders and deacons of the Chaos Origin Immortal sect to tremble.

“They don’t dare to come in anyway, so let them curse!”

One of the Deacons said in slight silence.

Let them curse. At the very least, they could vent their anger. After all, this was chaos origin city, and they had the numbers.

If they were to curse, they would not lose out!

The corners of the elders and deacons’mouths twitched, and they directly dealt with their own matters with an embarrassed expression.

“Chaos Origin Immortal sect has lost a lot of face this time. After today, I believe that the entire jianghu will become famous!”

Elder Feng said happily when he saw this scene.

“Today is just the beginning!”

Mo Qinglong’s face revealed a faint smile, and his eyes flashed with coldness.

Elder Feng was slightly silent as he sighed.

It was too terrifying to offend such an enemy.

He was certain that if it wasn’t for the Immortal God Pact, the Chaos Origin Immortal sect would have already turned into a river of blood!

The fact that his sister was injured and sent two immortal gods meant that the Dragon King still had immortal gods under him. At the very least, the Dragon King was still around.

“Elder Feng, I’ve posted all the actions of the Chaos Origin Immortal sect on the Jianghu website. I’ve posted all the posts in the eight cauldrons. Haha, Let’s See How the Chaos Origin Immortal sect will continue to survive in the jianghu in the future!”

At this moment, the young man who had started cursing earlier walked to elder Feng’s side and said excitedly.

Elder Feng smiled and patted his shoulder. “Go back to the immortal sect and bring all the information about the elders, deacons, and heaven chosen disciples of the Chaos Origin Immortal Sect!”

“Yes, Elder.”

The young man nodded and immediately flew toward the immortal sect.

Time slowly passed, and five to six hours passed very quickly.

Mo Qinglong and the others were still standing outside the city gate. As infant realm experts, it would not be a problem for them to not eat or drink for one to two months.

A row of experts stood there, and no one in the entire chaos origin immortal sect was driven out of the city gate.

“Bang!”

“This is too f * cking depressing. Every area on the pugilistic world’s Internet now has news of our chaotic origin immortal sect being blocked. We have completely lost face!”

“Now, the disciples of the other immortal sects are also calling us turtle immortal sect. F * ck, I want to go out and kill those people outside and wash away our shame with their blood!”

“Sigh, this time, our chaos origin immortal sect is completely defeated. The elders and deacons of the immortal sect failed to kill Feng Lingtian. Instead, they made us provoke a powerful enemy!”

“I don’t know how long those terrifying experts outside will block the immortal sect. As time goes by, we will become the laughingstock of the Martial World!”

At night, in a restaurant in chaos origin city, two elders sat at a table on the top floor. They slammed the table angrily and shouted loudly with red faces.

Situations like theirs happened in many places in Hunyuan City.

“Come, come, drink more. Drink more today and forget about this unhappy matter!”

“Even immortals can get drunk when they are drunk. Hehe, drink more today!”

The two old men drank.

The Moon slowly rose, gradually silencing the irritable Hunyuan city.

One by one, the elders, deacons, and disciples of the chaotic origin immortal sect returned to their homes or the immortal sects.

Like many immortal sects, some infant realm experts lived in the city, and some lived in the immortal sects.

When night fell and most people fell asleep.

In the center of the city, in the luxurious courtyard of an immortal sect’s deacons.

A faint white light fell on the door of the room, and it quietly opened.

An old man was lying on the bed, snoring softly.

“Puchi!”

Suddenly, a strange white figure appeared, and blood splattered onto the bedsheets. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

The white light enveloped the old man, and he slowly disappeared.
