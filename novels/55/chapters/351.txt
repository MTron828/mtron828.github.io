Chapter 352: Killed In Ten Seconds

Within the poison fog, an emotionless voice emanated. Following which, traces of light shone out from it.

Sss sss sss!

The surrounding poisonous green fog was vanishing at a rapid pace.

Light gradually illuminated the surroundings.

“What?”

At this point, Bian Yaoquan and the other six men stood on a dilapidated house. Seeing the gradually strengthening light, they were shocked.

“Inborn Spiritual Weapon, It must be a defensive type Inborn Spiritual Object!” the emaciated old man stared at the two figures with his gloomy eyes and said in a definitive tone.

“That’s right. It must be defensive Inborn Spiritual Armor or something similar. Otherwise, they would definitely not be able to avoid the explosion of the Divine Lightning Column!” the middle-aged man seconded with a definitive tone.

“Inborn level defensive armor?”

Greed gleamed in Bian Yaoquan’s eyes. “First, it was Inborn Spiritual Weapon, Zhan Lu, and now an Inborn level defensive armor? There must be another Inborn level item with him. If I can get all of them...!”

As Bian Yaoquan spoke, he got enthusiastic and agitated.

If he had three Inborn Spiritual objects, he could kill an Inborn expert despite only being at the Half-step to Inborn Realm.

“If I can get three Inborn Spiritual objects, the position of the Sect Leader of the Medical Saint Sect in the future will definitely be mine!”

Ecstasy welled up in him. He looked below him and started laughing, “Haha! Great! You have not disappointed me! You have not disappointed me! It’s only interesting this way!”

“All the Inborn Spiritual objects you have are all mine. Miracle Doctor, Holy Goddess, I’ll dote on you dearly in the future.” Bian Yaoquan laughed hysterically.

“What gives you the courage to assassinate us here!”

Green poisonous fog slowly dissipated under the illumination of Sun Lingxiu’s dazzling rays. Wang Xian stood up, lifted his head and stared at the seven figures on the roof of a dilapidated house.

He focused on Bian Yaoquan, who was in the middle, and stared at him with murderous eyes.

If he had not reacted in time to the horrifying attack previously, Sun Lingxiu would likely have suffered grave injuries.

Moreover, even he had suffered some light injuries in the previous explosion.

Fixing his gaze on the seven figures he wanted to slay, Wang Xian slowly opened up his palms.

“That’s right! We are going to kill you!”

Bian Yaoquan looked down at Wang Xian from higher ground and revealed an eerie smile.

He looked across at the severely injured Miracle Doctor Blood Man, showed a bloodthirsty expression and shouted, “You shall die today! Kill them!”

The Inborn experts around him quickly exchanged glances.

“Let’s attack him together. He has three Inborn Spiritual objects with him!” the Poison Duo said to the other four men.

“Even if he has three Inborn Spiritual objects, he will still die by the hands of the six of us. The youngest Miracle Doctor and a powerful alchemist... What a shame! I just love to kill geniuses!”

Two identical fat old men squinted their eyes and moved in unison towards Wang Xian.

“Die!”

The other four Inborn experts also struck at the same time. From above, they shrouded Wang Xian in their powerful Inborn auras.

Wang Xian lifted his head slightly and saw six Inborn experts approaching him. Contempt was written over his face.

“Since you guys are interested in what I have, I guess I should show it to you guys!”

As he finished his words, Wang Xian opened his palm and the Dragon Ball that emitted violent lava-like heat slowly floated up.

“Spiritual Flame Ball! Haha, that’s a good one!”

When Bian Yaoquan, who was on the rooftop, noticed the Dragon Ball in Wang Xian’s palm, he was thrilled.

“Spiritual Flame Ball is highly useful in refining elixir pills. Great! I like this treasure!”

Tsk!

Wang Xian sneered upon hearing his laughter.

At this moment, the two fat old men drew large axes from their backs. The axes were entirely black and looked incomparably heavy.

They slashed them towards Wang Xian directly.

“Die!”

Roar!

The voices of the two old men sounded. However, what they received in return was a dragon roar.

A rampaging dragon roar.

“What?”

To the astonishment of the six Inborn experts, the Dragon Ball turned into an Inferno Divine Dragon that spanned close to ten meters.

In the instant the divine dragon appeared, the air in the atmosphere started becoming violent.

The surroundings were filled with violent molecules.

The Inferno Divine Dragon was as real as it could get. Its surface was like lava and flames were raging furiously on it.

The Dragon Ball had assimilated the attributes of the Barraging Blaze Ball.

Roar!

The Inferno Divine Dragon moved and swung its claws towards the two approaching fat old men.

The dragon claws were one meter long and emanated powerful energies.

The two fat old men could feel the powers of the dragon claws and turned solemn. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Die!”

Moving almost in sync, the two old men lifted the huge axes in their hands. A layer of metal glow shrouded the giant axes, doubling their size to two meters.

Boom!

The dragon claws clashed with the axes.

Ka Ka Ka!

However, the huge, two meter axes were easily pushed back and started breaking apart.

Boom!

As the Inferno Divine Dragon exerted some strength, the giant axes started melting rapidly.

The two fat old men were horrified.

However, the momentum of the dragon claws didn’t slow at all as they grabbed onto them.

Argh!

Two pitiful cries propagated. In less than a second, all cries had stopped.

“What?”

The four Inborn experts that were following closely behind were petrified. The Double-faced Heavenly Axe duo had been in the Inborn Realm for more than ten years. Moreover, their combination strike was widely known to be extremely powerful.

Yet, they were killed in an instant.

Fear gripped the four men’s hearts.

Before they could react, the Inferno Divine Dragon was already right before them.

“Kill!” the four men gritted their teeth and growled.

Poison Duo waved their hands and balls of poison were hurled towards the Inferno Divine Dragon directly.

However, these poison balls were reduced to dust before they could even reach the Inferno Divine Dragon.

A middle-aged man filled with electric energy held a metal hammer in his hand. He smashed his hammer heavily towards the void space.

Bolts of lightning fell onto the body of the Inferno Divine Dragon.

However, the attacks were still futile.

This petrified the four Inborn experts.

Boom!

The Inferno Divine Dragon swayed its huge tail towards them. The horrifying dragon tail brought with it a force of over ten thousand pounds.

Bam! Bam!

Poison Duo, who were at the forefront of the group, didn’t even have the time and space to react.

Their bodies were smashed towards one of the dilapidated houses by the side as though they were rubber balls.

After smashing through a dozen-plus houses, they finally landed heavily on a wall.

Roar!

The Inferno Divine Dragon stretched its head in a motion towards the other two Inborn experts.

The next moment, it spewed flames on them.

Argh!

Raging flames fell onto their bodies and the two Inborn experts felt as though they had landed through the opening of a volcano.

Their eyes were filled with desperation and fear. Looking at the young man standing before them, hatred welled up in them.

The whole process lasted less than ten seconds. Six Inborn experts were killed.
