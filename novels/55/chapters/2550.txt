2551 2551 was in a state of shock

“There’s something that made everyone rush here today!”

Just as Wang Xian was in the Dragon Palace and taming the dire beasts one by one, a warship was located in the void crack above Xing Hua Planet!

The experts from the Jianghua Group, the Black Forest Group, and the three seas gate were gathered together. The old man who was the leader of the Jianghua Group looked around and said faintly!

“Is there anything that requires all of us to come over?”

The Three Seas Gate’s leader sat in the front and asked directly with an ugly expression!

The three seas gate had suffered heavy losses a few months ago, which had put him under a lot of pressure recently!

Because of his decision, almost half of the elite disciples and experts of the three seas gate had been killed. Many experts were already dissatisfied behind the scenes!

If it wasn’t for his and his father’s strength, the sect leader of the three seas sect would have changed long ago!

Even so, he was still in a bad mood!

Right now, he only wanted revenge, but the Dragon Palace was in such a remote place and was so strong, how could he take revenge?

“It’s not a big matter, but it’s not small either, I’m not completely sure yet!”

The elder from the Jian hua organization looked at him, with a wave of his arm, a picture appeared in front of him!

“500 light years away from Xing Hua Planet, an undying level 5 warrior 5 to 6 hours away, 10 planets suddenly appeared!”

“9 planets guarding one of them, there are many sky demons from Tiger Chaos Demon Country on that planet, they are very close to Xing Hua planet, we don’t know what they are doing yet!”

The elder pointed at the image in front of him, saying indifferently!

“Oh? Why would the Tiger Riot Demon Nation put a planet there?”

An elder from the Black Forest Group asked with a frown!

“We don’t know at the moment. We need to send someone to investigate with Xing Hua planet’s identity!”

The elder from the Jian hua group said!

“They are so far away. What can happen? You can decide on this matter. Our Three Seas Gate agrees!”

The three seas gate master glanced at him and left impatiently!

The elder from the Jianhua Group and the elder from the Black Forest looked at him with a hint of displeasure!

“Let’s send someone to go over the line!”

The elder from the Jianhua group stood up and said!

“Okay!”

The other elder nodded!

“We can start the campaign now. Dragon City’s commercial planet will open its doors in one and a half months!”

“At that time, the star Goddess and Yin Xuan Goddess will hold a large scale concert with hundreds of millions of people, the concert will last for 2 hours!”

“After the concert, the Dragon Palace will hold the sale of the Dragon Palace battle pets, there will be over 100 undying Emperor Battle Pets and 500,000 eternal God battle pets, half of them will be sold on the first day, 1/30 of them will be sold every day, sold out in 30 days!”

At the same time, in the Ocean Dragon Palace on Dragon Star’s commercial planet, Guan Shuqing and the other girls, Prime Minister Gui and chaotic tiger demon country’s imperial advisor sat around the Dragon Emperor Palace and discussed!

“Our chaotic tiger demon country may not be able to bring out so many good things, but we will also bring out all our specialties to attract people!”

Chaotic Tiger Country Leader and the others were shocked within, saying from the side!

“Sure, chaotic tiger monarch. Now that you still have quite a bit of influence in the southern star system, you should immediately start recruiting businesses and see if there are any forces willing to move into the Dragon Star!”

Prime Minister Gui said to them!

“Alright, we will do our best for the next half a month!”

Chaotic Tiger Monarch and the others nodded heavily!

Now that the Dragon Palace was in charge of everything on the Dragon Star, they would not have any objections!

With the terrifying training ground on dragon star, they could predict that dragon star would become 100% popular!

It would become the most popular commercial planet in the southern star system!

“Let’s publicize it on the AI First!”

Prime Minister Gui nodded.

“Weng Weng!”

“HMM?”

At this moment, the AI of chaotic tiger nation trembled and he immediately opened it to take a look!

“Xing Hua planet’s representative has come to pay us a visit!”

Chaotic Tiger Nation’s leader slightly raised his eyebrows and said!

“Oh? Then directly tell them that we want to build a commercial planet!”

Prime Minister Gui slightly narrowed his eyes and said with a smile!

“Haha, good. As long as dragon star rises, Xing Hua planet’s days in the future will be difficult!”

Chaotic Tiger Nation’s leader nodded with a smile and immediately sent a message!

At the same time, in the sky above the planet, the experts from the Jianhua Corporation and the Black Forest were looking at the ten planets around them with sparkling eyes!

“Everyone, our nation’s leader has something to do. If you have something to say, please say it!”

Soon, a few heaven fey from the chaotic Tiger Demon Nation flew over and said to the group!

...

“Hehe, ten planets suddenly appeared here. We are a little curious and came to pay a visit!”

An expert from the Jianhua group asked with a smile! Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Oh, we are building our commercial planet. You should be able to see it on the AI very soon!”

The Heaven Fey expert replied with a smile!

“What?”

The words of the few heaven fey caused the faces of the Jianhua Group’s Black Forest Group to change slightly!

“A commercial planet?”

An expert asked again with a gloomy face!

“Everyone, just wait for the news on the AI. You should know soon!”

The few Sky Demons left immediately after saying that!

They were very clear about the relationship between the Dragon Palace and planet Xing Hua. Furthermore, after their commercial planet was established, planet Xing Hua had the greatest influence!

...

“The Tiger Demon Nation wants to build their own commercial planet. I think they are overconfident!”

Seeing the few Sky Demons leave, an elder could not help but growl in a low voice!

“That’s right. With the Tiger Demon Nation’s heritage, it’s wishful thinking for them to build a commercial planet. We don’t even need to do anything. The demon slaying sect will not let this planet be peaceful!”

The few elders beside them nodded!

“No matter what, let’s report this matter to the higher-ups first!”

Everyone’s expressions were somewhat unsightly!

No matter what, the establishment of a commercial planet here by the Tiger Riot Demon Kingdom would have some impact on planet Xing Hua!

However, just as they were rushing back, the Dragon Star commercial planet had already begun to make a commotion on the internet!

This commotion, in just a short half an hour, spread throughout the entire southern star system’s AI!

3 messages spread across the Internet, the 1 star Goddess and Yin Xuan Goddess immediately announced on the AI that they were going to hold a large scale concert with over 100 million people, a free concert!

The moment this news was announced, all the fans of the 2 star Goddess and Yin Xuan Goddess went into a frenzy, and the venue was on the Dragon Star Commercial Planet!

The second piece of information came from the Tiger Chaos Demon Country, and as the fifth organization to have an undying level 7 warrior, their influence was huge too!

The Tiger Chaos Demon Country immediately announced that they would work together with the Dragon Palace to build a commercial planet, Dragon Star!

The third piece of information came from the Dragon Palace, ever since they destroyed half of the three seas sect’s forces, they were extremely famous too!

And the Dragon Palace’s information was that in a month and a half, they would be holding a battle pet sale on the Commercial Planet Dragon Star!

There would be over 150 undyings and two level 5 undyings!

Next, 500,000 eternal God Lord Level Battle Pets!

The moment these three pieces of information came out, everyone was shocked!
