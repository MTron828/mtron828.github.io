Chapter 464: Pilgrimage (2)

“The people of the Xiao Clan and Sui Clan are here!”

“Has it ended? Has it ended?”

“It should have. Those incessant cries are really giving me goosebumps. Those were the cries of Inborn experts!”

At the beach, the crowd of martial artists stared in shock at the group from Xiao Clan and Sui Clan moving rapidly towards them.

A while ago, they had heard wretched cry after cry clearly from the island.

They had heard the angry and desperate roar from the skies.

And eventually, the cries gradually died down.

“Those angry and wretched screams from before seemed to be from the Supreme Elders of the Medical Saint Sect and the people from the Qiao Clan!”

“Could it be that these Sacred Sects have really been annihilated?”

“Sacred Sects are annihilated? Sss!”

The crowd gasped and stared fervently at the approaching people from the Sui Clan and Xiao Clan.

Forty to fifty of them got closer and closer.

One young man mustered his courage and asked loudly, “Seniors, may I ask about the situation of the island? What’s the outcome?”

“Medical Saint Sect, Qiao Clan and everyone else were annihilated. Get ready for the pilgrimage tomorrow!” An old man glanced at them plainly and replied solemnly.

“What?”

Everyone was dumbfounded and their eyes widened in disbelief.

However, the people from the Xiao Clan and Sui Clan did not elaborate and left immediately.

“Medical Saint Sect, Qiao Clan and the other seven forces were annihilated!”

“Could it be that the Xiao Clan and Sui Clan participated in the battle previously? However, from their appearances, there’s no signs of bloodstain on them!”

“From the moment I saw two figures falling to the ground and heard the loud scream, I knew that Medical Saint Sect and Qiao Clan might be finished. However, I couldn’t convince myself. Now that I have heard it with my own ears, it still feels a little impossible!”

“Three unparalleled experts! We are talking about three unparalleled experts! All of them have fallen by the hands of the Dragon Sect. How terrifying is the Dragon Sect?”

“Everyone! Take a look at the Underworld website. There’s an account that is most likely belonging to the Dragon Sect. They have made an announcement declaring that the Medical Saint Sect and the Qiao Clan have been annihilated. They also told everyone to get ready for the pilgrimage!”

“They were really annihilated! Two Sacred Sects have been erased from the Underworld! The Dragon Sect is insanely strong!”

“In the battle earlier, Sui Clan and Xiao Clan probably fought too. Otherwise, I couldn’t believe that the Dragon Sect could annihilate two Sacred Sects.”

At the beach, a crowd of astonished people were discussing fervently.

In the Underworld, this incident had also stirred a huge ruckus.

The annihilation of Sacred Sects. Moreover, two Sacred Sects were destroyed. This was something that could shake the entire Underworld!

Before the battle, everyone could see the terrifying strength of the coalition between Medical Saint Sect and the Qiao Clan.

Close to a hundred Inborn experts and three unparalleled experts. In the face of this strength, any force would have to kneel.

Even if that force was a Sacred Sect.

However, close to a hundred Inborn experts were all dead now.

“The Sui Clan and Xiao Clan definitely played a part. Otherwise, with the strength of the Medical Saint Sect and Qiao Clan, how could the Dragon Sect annihilate them so easily?”

“Two Sacred Sects against three... Although it is shocking that they were annihilated, it isn’t impossible!”

“A hundred Inborn experts have been killed. The strength of the Underworld has decreased substantially!”

“Two Sacred Sects have been erased from the Underworld and the Dragon Sect has risen. After this incident, the Dragon Sect has completely stabilized its footing in the Underworld.

The annihilation of the Medical Saint Sect and Qiao Clan was like an earthquake in the Underworld.

When the other Sacred Sects and Clans heard the news, they also couldn’t remain composed for a long time.

“The death of three unparalleled experts. At that time, although the Sui Clan and Xiao Clan were present, Sui Huang wasn’t there. In other words, only the Laozu of Xiao Clan was there. The Dragon Sect would at least have two Dan Realm experts. Based on the information gathered by the people at the beach, it’s beyond doubt that the Dragon Sect had at least two Dan Realm experts!”

Various Sacred Sects and Clans obtained reports from different places. All the higher management of these sects and clans had gathered to discuss the incident.

The annihilation of two Saint-class forces warrantied their closest attention.

After all, most of the Saint-class forces weren’t even as strong as the Medical Saint Sect.

They wanted to analyze the strength of the Dragon Sect to come out with an action plan.

“The Dragon Sect has risen. Send some gifts over tomorrow!”

“The Sacred Sect, Dragon Sect, has a strength that ranks among the top three or four Sacred Sects. Instruct our guys to send some gifts over tomorrow!”

“Don’t ever offend the disciples of the Dragon Sect in the future!”

“Sui Clan, Xiao Clan and the Dragon Sect are definitely on really good terms!”

Different messages came from various Sacred Sects.

The Dragon Sect had dominantly annihilated two Sacred Sects. Although this might be largely because of the aid from the Xiao Clan and Sui Clan, it was still enough to command fear and respect.

While the Sacred Sects were hesitating, they still sent their guys to bring gifts for the pilgrimage.

Within the Underworld, various families and sects were astonished to see this piece of news.

A Sacred Sect that shot to the peak by stepping on the corpses of a Sacred Sect, a Sacred Clan, and seven first-class forces was sufficient for them to hold in high regard.

As a newly crowned Sacred Sect, the Dragon Sect would require them to express goodwill and pay pilgrimage to them.

That was despite the fact that many families and ancestral sects didn’t have high opinions of Dragon Sect in the past. Some even believed that the Dragon Sect would be annihilated.

Regardless, they had to be respectful towards a fast-rising Dragon Sect.

All the powerful families and sects in the Underworld were mobilized as they prepared gifts and made their way to Rivertown.

It wasn’t that they would be targeted if they didn’t go for the pilgrimage. However, the birth of a Saint-class force and the rise of a powerful sect was worthwhile for them to head over and express goodwill.

If their disciples were to offend the Sacred Sect carelessly in the future, the Sacred Sect might let them off because of their current decision. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

The pilgrimage was dependent on the strength of a Sacred Sect.

When the Flame Palace had announced their ascension to be a Sacred Sect previously, only the sects and families in three to four provinces headed to the pilgrimage.

However, the Flame Palace was a far cry from the current Dragon Sect.

Dragon Sect could make it to the top five of all Saint-class forces just from the strength they displayed in the annihilation of Medical Saint Sect and the Qiao Clan.

Ten thousand sects paying pilgrimage!

Wang Xian wasn’t aware of the happenings in the Underworld. He summoned Mo Qinglong and Mo Yuan over and immediately headed to the old nests of the Medical Saint Sect and the Qiao Clan.

Since they had annihilated the Medical Saint Sect and the Qiao Clan, the treasures that belonged to them were naturally theirs for the taking.

“I should have sent the dragonians over in advance. Most of the treasures left behind were probably shifted away by others by now!”

Wang Xian shook his head in disappointment because of his miscalculation.

“Wahhh! Brother, there are lots of forces congratulating us on the establishment of the Dragon Sect. Among them, there were several Saint-class forces!”

Xiao Yu was scrolling through her phone in the villa and shouted loudly. However, she soon pouted. “Just a day ago, they were still saying we would be annihilated. Heh!”

“There will probably be lots of forces coming tomorrow. Hehe! At that time, I’ll participate as the Sect Leader of the Thistles and Thorns Sect!” Xiao Yu remarked loudly. Lan Qingyue, Guan Shuqing and Sun Lingxiu chuckled by her side.

They sat there demurely and looked like goddesses.
