Chapter 1655: In the 1655 Arena Battle of life and death

“Is it all settled?”

After Wang Xian left Huo Luo'er’s place, he came to the center.

Soon, many strange demons appeared around him.

“Reporting to Dragon King, all of them have been eliminated!”

Ao Yao said respectfully.

“Next, stop the assassination of the disciples of the life and Death Elixir Workshop and the holy item forging workshop. Focus on killing those mercenaries and those who received the mission!”

Wang Xian hesitated for a moment before giving an order to Ao Yao and the rest.

When he made his move just now, the other party was able to discover him in advance and gave Wang Xian a warning.

If he were to kill the disciples of the life and Death Elixir Workshop and the holy item forging workshop in a frenzy now, it would definitely attract the attention of the two major forces.

When that happened, there would be two scenarios. One would be for the other party to send experts over to investigate.

The second was to forbid the disciples from entering the battlefield.

This wasn’t a good thing for him.

Therefore, he planned to use a gentle method to boil frogs in warm water.

First, he would kill those mercenary groups and the people who accepted the mission. These unspecialized people, even after they died, wouldn’t attract the attention of the two major forces.

Even if they eventually found out that these unspecialized people were killed, it would still have a deterrent effect.

Those who still wanted to join the battlefield for pills, spirit stones, and weapons would have to consider their own lives.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

The group of strange monsters nodded immediately.

Wang Xian waved his arm and allowed them to move freely on the battlefield.

He hid in the surroundings and scanned the surroundings with his yin-yang and five elements dragon eyes. Once he encountered some powerful mercenary groups, he would take action immediately.

The battlefield with a radius of several thousand kilometers was already very large.

The entire battlefield was filled with silence and bloodshed. It was extremely quiet.

Assassinations and sneak attacks were constantly being carried out here.

However, the participation of the strange demon clan completely changed the entire situation.

“Haha, there are finally a few fish that have taken the bait. The harvest this time is not bad. I want to change to a third level void interpretation weapon, Haha!”

In a corner of the fire cloud forest, a group of over ten people looked at the corpses on the ground with grim expressions. Their faces were filled with excitement.

The path of cultivation did not lack people who dared to risk their lives.

And if one wanted to become stronger and stronger, there was only one way, and that was to fight.

The Life and Death Pill Workshop and the holy item forging workshop had attracted millions of people from the central continent with generous rewards. Many of them were experts.

The profound void tier was not uncommon.

For the sake of those incomparably generous pills and weapons.

As long as they killed a few profound void tier experts, it was equivalent to them killing dozens of profound void tier fierce beasts and demonic beasts.

“Cut off their heads!”

A burly middle-aged man ordered his subordinates with a smile on his face.

“Yes, leader!”

Everyone immediately walked over and prepared to cut off the heads of these people.

“PFFF! PFFF! PFFF!”

Suddenly, a piercing sound was heard.

There were no corpses on the ground, but these people had already disappeared.

In the air, a drop of fresh blood dripped slowly.

The assassination was ongoing.

Five Hundred Strange Demons could assassinate a powerhouse at level six of the void interpretation realm. Such strength was extremely terrifying in the battlefield.

“Come back!”

Ten hours later, Wang Xian recalled all the strange demons.

“How is it?”

Wang Xian looked at the five hundred strange demons with a smile on his face.

Ao Yao swept his gaze across all his clansmen and counted the number.

“Dragon King, you have killed more than 20,000 people. Among them, there are more than 700 above the Seethrough Realm!”

A few minutes later, ao Yao reported directly after he finished counting.

“That’s right. Let’s go back. We will come back a day later!” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Wang Xian said directly.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

After waiting for more people to appear on the battlefield, they would continue to kill.

This was like a storage pond. When there was too much water in the pond, the water would be pumped again.

His figure moved and he flew directly to the location of the Fire Cloud Mountain.

After entering the city with the token, Wang Xian returned to his residence.

“Young master Wang, sorry to disturb you!”

Just as Wang Xian entered the room, a voice was suddenly heard.

“Senior Fengyun, please come in!”

Wang Xian sensed the figure outside the door. A smile appeared on his face as he said immediately.

“Young master Wang, were the elixirs from the life and Death Elixir Workshop in Fengtian City taken away by you?”

Fengyun entered the room and asked directly.

“That’s right!”

Wang Xian nodded without hiding anything.

“Young master Wang is really skilled!”

Feng Yun sighed slightly.

When the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan learned about what happened in Fengtian city, they were also shocked.

They couldn’t rob the life and Death Elixir Workshop in Fengtian city unless Feng Yun personally took action.

Thinking of how Wang Xian had just arrived and something had happened in Fengtian city, the higher-ups of the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan were somewhat suspicious.

Feng Yun could not help but come over to confirm it directly.

“Oh right, senior Feng Yun, I have some weapons in my hands. Can you change the weapons into elixirs?”

Wang Xian thought of the weapons in his interspatial ring and asked.

All the weapons in his hands were obtained by assassinating those people.

There were more than 20,000 people, and there were more than 500 void interpretation weapons.

There were more than 20,000 weapons that were above transcendent level seven.

If these were converted into elixirs, it would be a substantial income.

Furthermore, he had obtained a substantial amount of elixirs from these people’s interspatial rings.

“Alright, leave this to our fire cloud sparrow clan!”

Feng Yun nodded.

As one of the top clans under the empire, they had their own channels.

Some of the weapons were very easy to handle.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded his head and threw over a dozen interspatial rings to her.

Looking at the weapons in the interspatial rings, Feng Yun was slightly surprised, especially the more than a dozen weapons of the ninth level of the Seethrough realm, which surprised her.

However, she didn’t ask any more questions and took her leave immediately.

“A golden belt for killing and arson. With this speed, I might be able to level up in a few months!”

Wang Xian watched Feng Yun leave and thought to himself.

“Brother Wang Xian, brother Wang Xian!”

Before Wang Xian could rest, Huo Luo'er’s voice came from outside half an hour later.

“Come in!”

Wang Xian smiled and waved his arm to open the door.

“Brother Wang Xian, I heard from my clansmen that you are here, so I came over to take a look!”

Huo Luo'er walked in and said with a smile.

“What’s the matter?”

Wang Xian asked with a smile.

“I’m asking about the Empress!”

Huo Luo'er came over and asked with a smile.

“Your Empress is doing very well now. In a year or two at most, the two of you will be able to meet again!”

Wang Xian said to her.

“Is that so? When Sister Empress returns, she will definitely be able to shake the world and destroy the trash like the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging Workshop!”

Huo Luo'er clenched her fists and continued, “Brother Wang Xian, it would be great if you came earlier. I can bring you to some fun places in the fire lark!”

“Now, we only have two cities. However, there are some fun places in the volcano city. Let me bring you there!”

Huo Luo'er said to him.
