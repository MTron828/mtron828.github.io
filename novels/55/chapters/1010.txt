Chapter 1011: Under the treasure of the 1012 wind-winged savage fish

Translator: 5496903

“Bang, Bang, Bang!”

Wang Xian used the lightning strike wood to break through the holes one by one. Then, he and the members of the Dragon Palace walked into the cave.

“Get Ready!”

After breaking through seven passages, Wang Xian said to Ao Yao and the rest behind him.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Ao Yao nodded.

He held the lightning strike wood in his hand and placed it gently on the wall of the passage.

The thick wall cracked open and a three-meter-wide hole slowly appeared.

He looked into the hole and saw a group of wind-winged savage fish. They had already noticed the commotion here and were staring at it intently.

Their bodies were lying on the ground and their eyes were filled with vigilance.

Bang

Wang Xian pushed his arm and the entire three-meter-wide hole appeared.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

At this moment, a wind sword that was like an aurora came straight at them.

Wang Xian moved his body and a huge earth shield instantly appeared in front of him.

Under any state, Wang Xian, who was at transcendent level seven, could easily deal with the attacks of a group of people who were at transcendent level six.

“Kill!”

The wind sword landed on the Earth Shield. Wang Xian let out a soft shout and the Golden Swordfish and strange demon instantly attacked them from behind.

“Damned humans, I’m going to tear you into pieces!”

An extraordinary level six wind-winged savage fish stared at Wang Xian and the rest viciously and roared loudly.

“Leave One Alive!”

“PFFT! PFFT! PFFT!”

Wang Xian said indifferently. Ao Jian and Ao Demon’s attacks had already landed on more than ten wind-winged savage fish.

One by one, the wind-winged savage fish were killed easily.

“Human, you actually killed our family members. You deserve to die. I’m going to kill all of you!”

The last survivor spoke the language of the humans from the supernatural continent. His expression was extremely ferocious.

“Soul Catcher!”

Wang Xian saw the bloodthirsty and hateful expression of the wind-winged savage fish. He frowned slightly and moved his body. He used the supernatural ability soul catcher.

Soul-absorbing ability. By absorbing the souls of other creatures, one could extract their memories.

Wang Xian rarely used this ability. This was because the memories of the other party were too huge and it would deplete his spirit.

A special energy entered Wang Xian’s mind. Instantly, he felt that something was forcefully stuffed into his mind.

A ferocious aura filled Wang Xian’s mind. Slowly, he frowned slightly.

“They actually relied on the smell and the direction of the wind to walk in the passageway. This is troublesome.”

Wang Xian sensed this information and shook his head.

From the memories in his mind, he learned that the wind-winged savage fish was a very greedy demonic beast.

They liked to plunder, especially humans. They treated humans as their food.

In addition, they liked to plunder all kinds of treasures to increase their strength.

“What a greedy race!”

Wang Xian thought to himself. He looked around and saw that Ao Jian and the rest had kept more than ten corpses into their interspatial rings.

He looked at the entire cave.

The cave that occupied a radius of two thousand meters was divided into small holes to live in.

In the middle of the cave, the hole was the largest. There were some things hidden inside.

Wang Xian immediately walked over and entered the cave. He saw many items placed inside.

“Weapons! Transcendent-level weapons! There are so many of them!”

“There’s even an interspatial ring. What is this?”

Wang Xian was astonished.

These weapons were obviously obtained by the winged howler fish after they hunted humans.

Other than these items, there were three other items.

Azure Stone: transcendent tier 6 material.

Wind chime flower: transcendent tier 5 material.

Wind chime liquid: transcendent tier 6 spirit liquid.

Of the three items, azure stone was used to refine arrays and weapons. One azure stone was worth 5,000 mid-grade spirit stones, and there were over 1,000 azure stones here.

The value of the wind chime flower was relatively low, a few hundred mid-grade spirit stones.

As for the wind chime liquid, a drop could reach several thousand mid-grade spirit stones, and there were at least several thousand drops here.

Excluding some extraordinary level five or six weapons and armor, the value of these three items alone had reached more than ten million.

“No wonder the mercenary group from Donghai City would come here one after another. The value of the items from a small family like the wind wing savage fish is so high. Then, wouldn’t the treasures of the entire demonic beast race be worth hundreds of millions or even dozens of medium-grade spirit stones?”

Wang Xian’s eyes were burning with passion.

After putting away all the treasures, Wang Xian scanned his surroundings and said, “Let’s Go!”

He moved his body and walked towards the location inside.

The Soul Catcher didn’t get any information. He could only search slowly.

As he walked deeper into the cave, he realized that at the fork in the road, he would often encounter the hidden brocade-scaled boa. It seemed to be guarding this place.

After driving for another half an hour, Wang Xian had no idea where he was. He swept his gaze around and found another cave.

It was about the same size as the cave earlier. There were less than ten wind-winged fish in it.

Wang Xian opened up the passage and killed them easily.

“Eh, this is the wind-clearing crossbow. It’s a special weapon of transcendent level six!”

After killing all the wind-winged fish in the cave, Wang Xian entered the cave and found more than ten special weapons.

Wind-clearing crossbow, transcendent level 6 weapon.

This weapon was similar to a bow and arrow, but it was completely different from a bow and arrow. It was similar to the Zhuge Crossbow.

The entire weapon looked very complicated.

This was the most complicated weapon that Wang Xian had seen since he came to the transcendence continent. Even the defensive weapons were not as complicated as this one.

“It should be worth a lot of spirit stones!”

Wang Xian looked at the one-meter-long wind clearing crossbows and continued his search.

At this moment, in the underground passage of the wind-winged Savage Fish, the amethyst void Beast and the rest of the mercenary groups from the demon hunters academy were carefully groping around in the passage.

There were more than a hundred people and they looked rather majestic.

However, three of them died within a short span of four to five hours.

What they didn’t know was that one by one, the Jinlin Boa had already passed this news to the Demon Beast Race of the wind-winged savage fish.

Compared to Wang Xian, they had only harvested some of the corpses of the ferocious beasts.

Even though they had found the cave, the wind-winged Savage Fish had already fled before they arrived. Not a single treasure was left behind.

“There are level six extraordinary wind-wing savage fish in ordinary caves. There must be an even stronger existence in the entire race!”

Wang Xian kept the corpses of the level six extraordinary wind-wing savage fish as he thought to himself.

However, regardless of whether there was a level seven or level eight extraordinary, Wang Xian was not worried at all.

With their strength, they could still fight if they encountered a level nine extraordinary wind-wing savage fish.

“Let’s continue!”

Wang Xian thought to himself as he continued to walk forward.

The Dragon’s eyes of light and dark fire scanned the surroundings. In at most a week, Wang Xian would be able to completely search this place!

By then, he didn’t know how much he would gain!
