Chapter 1622: 1622 was the family of the most ruthless emperor

“Father, ancestor!”

When Wu Qing Cheng came to the imperial study room, he saw his father and the two ancestors there. He was slightly shocked and immediately bowed.

“Qing Cheng, sit aside!”

Wu Ji King said to Wu Qing Cheng.

“It’s father!”

Wu Qing Cheng looked at the imperial study room curiously. The two ancestors came in person, and there were five important ministers of the dynasty.

What happened?

“What are the conditions offered by the life and Death School and the forging school?”

When he sat down, an old man sitting next to Patriarch Dark Eye asked Wu Ji King.

“Five Elixir Masters and five forging masters have served us for 100 years!”

“Fifty Rank-8 insightful void pills and fifty rank-8 weapons!”

“Five rank nine void interpretation pills and five rank nine void interpretation weapons!”

The king of Wuji Nation said directly with an expression of shock on his face.

Patriarch Dark Eye and the other patriarch also had an inexplicable expression in their eyes.

“This... Imperial father, what’s going on? The Life and Death Pill Workshop and the holy item forging workshop are going to...”

Wu Qing Cheng heard their conversation and immediately stood up with a shocked expression on his face.

“The two forces want us to destroy the dragon-phoenix Empire!”

Wu Ji King looked at his son and said.

“What? Destroy the dragon-phoenix Empire? Why do they want to destroy the dragon-phoenix Empire? Besides, don’t we have a good relationship with the dragon-phoenix Empire?”

Wu Qing Cheng was slightly surprised and asked loudly.

“Of course, the dragon-phoenix Empire blocked their way of making money. I don’t understand why the dragon-phoenix Empire has so many pill and weapon masters. They can actually monopolize the pills and weapons of their own empire!”

Wuji nation’s king said in deep thought.

“Father, aren’t we on good terms with the dragon-phoenix Empire? Why are we...”

Wu Qing Cheng said with a slightly unpleasant expression.

Priest Wang had expelled the darkness soul from his body. This was a huge favor.

And the relationship between the dragon-phoenix Empire and priest Wang was clearly a matter of opinion.

“As a king, as a king, you have to put the overall situation first. You have to put the Empire first. That’s what a good king is!”

“Qing Cheng, if you want to become the ruler of the Wuji Empire, you have to be ruthless. The emperor is ruthless, and the country is above everything else!”

The Wuji ruler stared at Wu Qing Cheng and said slowly.

“Hehe, if you want to take the position of your father, you have to put the overall situation above everything else. You have to put the interests above everything else. Back then, my strength was unrivalled in our Wuji Empire. At that time, my father still passed the position to my younger brother!”

“If you don’t have the courage, then don’t take this position. Qing Cheng, can you do it?”

Patriarch dark eye smiled and said indifferently.

As a powerhouse who had lived for thousands of years, would he be grateful to priest Wang for saving Wuqing City for the rest of his life?

Obviously, this was impossible. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Not to mention that priest Wang was already dead, even if he was still alive, they would still put the Wuji Empire first and put profit first.

Since ancient times, the ruthless king was not a joke.

If they were born in an imperial family, they could even kill each other, let alone others.

“I know!”

Wu Qing Cheng frowned. “However, we don’t have to directly attack the Dragon and Phoenix Empire. As long as the dragon and Phoenix Empire doesn’t lock down the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop, won’t everything be fine?”

“That’s right. Therefore, we can inform the dragon and Phoenix Empire in advance. It’s considered to be doing our best!”

Patriarch Dark Eye said.

“If it were another empire, what do you think they would choose?”? “The dragon-phoenix Empire and we are both empires. We are in a competitive relationship. If we destroy them, not only can we get all their territory, but we can also get the rewards of the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging Workshop!”

“In addition, I think this reward is too little. Dark Mark’s strength has already reached the peak of level 8 void interpretation. If we make a move at the end, the two big forces will raise dark mark to level 9 void interpretation!”

“I hope that the dragon-phoenix Empire will ignore our reminder!”

The old man next to dark eye ancestor said with a smile.

The other ancestor was once the previous king of the Wuji Empire. He naturally knew how to deal with the general situation of the Empire!

The king of the Wuji Empire and dark eye revealed expressions of interest.

Once they made a move, the rewards would reach an unimaginable level.

The Life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop were two forces on the continent. The rewards they could offer were definitely not limited to what they said.

They could completely raise an expert at the peak of the eighth rank of the profound void tier to the ninth rank of the profound void tier.

In addition, if they made their move, it would be equivalent to helping the lone sect and the southern royal family. At that time, they could make the dragon and Phoenix Empire’s territory belong to their Wuji Empire.

This would double the size of the entire Wuji Empire’s territory.

In the future, two-thirds of the entire territory would belong to the Wuji Empire!

The future of the Wuji Empire would definitely become stronger and stronger.

“Alright, since that’s the case, we’ll inform the Dragon and Phoenix Empire first. We’ve already done a great deed by doing this!”

The king of Wuji nodded.

In his opinion, reminding the dragon and Phoenix Empire to let their life and death and sacred objects enter the city was already a great deed.

This could be said to be a great deed!

Because if they did so, the rewards they would receive would be much lower, and they naturally wouldn’t receive territories and the like.

Of course, there was also a benefit to doing so. They didn’t have to offend the Dragon and Phoenix Empire, and they didn’t have to engage in a great battle.

Once they made their move, they would have to face the Dragon and Phoenix Empire’s ninth level profound void tier powerhouse.

“Imperial father, let me personally make a trip to the dragon and Phoenix Empire this time!”

Wu Qing Cheng hesitated for a moment and slowly said from the side.

“Alright, then you go, Qing Cheng. Remember, we also gave priest Wang a very high reward for saving you. You Don’t owe him too much!”

Wuji King looked at his son and said faintly.

“It’s father!”

Wu Qing Cheng nodded.

Wuji King ordered his men to summon the masters from the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop over for another discussion.

In the end, Wu Qing Cheng led a group of people on the Shadow Lion and flew towards the Dragon and Phoenix Empire.

“Your Highness, the Dragon and Phoenix Imperial City is right in front of us. It used to be the Ice Heart Imperial City!”

Three days later, a voice was heard in the sedan.

Wu Qingcheng opened his eyes and slowly picked up the wine flask at the side and walked out.

He looked at the city in front of him and slowly raised the wine flask in his hand!

“This cup of wine is for the priest King. Thank you for saving my life back then!”

He poured the wine into the cup and slowly poured it down.

“The second cup of wine is for a heavenly devil that even I am in awe of!”

He slowly poured it down and poured it onto the ground.

“The third cup of wine is for myself. The path of a ruler surpasses all living things!”

“My will is in the world. My will is in Wuji Imperial Court!”

“All living things are chess pieces. I Am A Go player!”

“This is the path of a ruler!”
