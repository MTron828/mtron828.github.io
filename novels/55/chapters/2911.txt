Chapter 2912: performance time

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

Large amounts of water elemental god stones were converted into energy, and the entire water droplet cannon let out a special sound.

The sound of rain appeared out of thin air.

In the next moment, countless resplendent raindrops headed straight for the army of demons and evildoers.

They met the attacks of the demons and evildoers.

“Pa Pa Pa Pa Pa!”

The densely packed raindrops covered an area of 500 million km. Very quickly, the raindrops met the attacks and pierced through.

Even the attacks of the two pinnacle undying demon kings were all melted.

The rest of the raindrops continued to fall forward.

“Howl Howl Howl!”

“Howl Howl Howl!”

Soon, the screams of countless demonic beasts could be heard.

“Sou Sou Sou!”

Before all the demonic beasts could react, the water droplet cannon in front of the draconic armament launched a second round of attacks.

The countless raindrops continued to fall.

This time, they only attacked the two peak god King Demonic Beasts.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

The two peak God King Demonic Beasts roared in fear. At this moment, dense wounds appeared on their bodies.

Each of the wounds had been hit by the Raindrops. Those with dense injuries would definitely faint if they saw them.

The two peak king God realm demonic beasts raised their heads and shot out streams of flames towards the raindrops.

“Sou Sou Sou!”

However, the dense and terrifying raindrops pierced through the flames and continued to cover the demonic beasts.

“Roar!”

“Roar!”

Miserable shrieks rang out. The two peak-stage godly monarch demonic beasts that were the focus of the water droplet cannon were pierced through by the raindrops and their life force quickly disappeared.

Within a radius of 500 million kilometers around the two peak-stage godly monarch demonic beasts, hundreds of millions of demonic beasts had all died.

“Hiss, what a terrifying weapon. That guy actually had such a treasure. Two peak-stage godly monarch abyssal beasts were killed instantly!”

“This… This war god weapon is so powerful. These two rounds of attacks have destroyed at least hundreds of millions of demonic beasts.”

“F * ck, this kid actually has such a treasure on him. Was it the vice regiment commander who protected his life for him?”

On the battle platform, when everyone saw this scene, shock appeared on their faces.

Such a weapon could be considered a great killing weapon.

Their Liu Li also had such a treasure, but they could only take it out at a critical moment.

Second senior sister also opened her mouth slightly, her eyes shining.

“This isn’t something master gave him. He must have gotten it from the Dragon Palace.”

She murmured.

“That kid is going to be unlucky. His two rounds of attacks have attracted Yaoxie’s attention. The Yaoxie army is going to change their target!”

“There are seven or eight peak-stage godly monarch-level yaoxie that have locked onto that kid. If he doesn’t escape, he will be finished!”

At this moment, exclamations could be heard from the battle platform.

Invincible took out his waterdrop cannon and killed two peak god-king demonic beasts. Hundreds of millions of other demonic beasts attracted the attention of the entire Demonic Beast Army.

Under the guidance of the seven or eight peak god-king demonic beasts, the entire Demonic Beast Army actually attacked invincible.

In other words, invincible had to face the demonic beast attacks of the entire 3rd Army.

“Oh my God, damn it, Dragon Weapon, continue to attack!”

“Sou Sou Sou!”

Countless raindrops attacked the army of Yaoxie.

After a round of attacks, hundreds of millions of Yaoxie were killed.

However, the eight peak god King Yaoxie saw the power of the Raindrops and was on guard. Hence, he was not injured.

“Continue!”

Invincible in battle techniques continued to roar loudly.

“Sou Sou Sou!”

“Don’t stop, keep attacking!”

He shouted loudly.

“Oh?”

“F * ck, it can’t be, so many water-type god stones are all gone!”

However, after only two rounds of attacks, all the god stones he had accumulated had been used up.

“This is too much, who can afford to use up so much!”

Unrivaled battle technique roared with a dark face. He waved his arm and put away the water drop cannon.

However, the four rounds of attacks from the water drop cannon had killed 500 million to 600 million Yao Xie. Its terrifying strength had already been displayed.

“The energy of the supreme treasure in that kid’s hand has been used up!”

On the fighting ring, a regiment commander said when he saw unrivaled battle technique put away the water drop cannon.

“Such a treasure, to be able to kill so many Yaoxie, is already very terrifying!”

A regiment commander beside him said.

“If he doesn’t escape, he will be drowned by the army of Yaoxie!”

Everyone on the battle platform said.

Invincible battle technique took out the water drop cannon and attracted Yaoxie’s firepower, making it much easier for them.

Everyone watched.

“F * ck, do you really think I’m Liu Li’s Trash?”

Invincible in battle was floating in the air. When he saw Yao Xie’s army charging over, he shouted loudly.

His voice was very loud, and all the Liu Li soldiers on the battle platform heard it clearly.

This made their eyes turn cold, and they were gnashing their teeth.

However, many people were also slightly surprised. Could it be that this guy had a treasure?

“Let me show you the Poison My Big Brother gave me. I’ll kill all of you bastards.”

As invincible battle technique spoke, Jade bottles appeared in his hands.

He grabbed a bunch of jade bottles and handed a few of them to long shou.

“Little baby, aim at those eight peak divine King Yao Xie. Aim a little and the jade bottles will explode in front of them!”

Invincible battle technique said as he held the jade bottles in his hands.

“Sigh, these are all the toxins that the two big brothers gave me. My Heart Aches!”

“After this, I Must Get Liu Li to reimburse me.”

Invincible battle technique said as he waved his arm and threw the jade bottles towards the demonic army in front of him.

The dragon weapons beneath him also aimed the jade bottles at the eight peak-stage godly monarch demonic beasts and threw them away forcefully.

“Senior sister, film it for me. You must film it in a cool way!”

After throwing the invincible battle technique, he immediately turned his head and said to his senior sister.

Second senior sister pursed her lips. After hesitating for a moment, she took out an AI and began to film.

“What is that? It makes that guy so confident?”

On the fighting ring, everyone looked over in surprise. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Roar Roar Roar!”

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

Yao Xie’s speed was very fast. In a short period of time, he was only about 2,000 kilometers away from invincible battle technique.

This distance was very close to an expert.

“Peng! Peng!”

However, at this moment, the jade bottle thrown by invincible battle technique and dragon weapon exploded in the air.

Inside, drops of black liquid shot toward Yao Xie’s army.

In particular, the Dragon Arms Thrown Jade Bottle, the bright liquid directly toward the eight god King Peak Evil attack and go.

The next moment, something happened that shocked everyone.

“OW, OW, ow!”

“OW, OW, ow!”

The voice that Shocks Heaven and earth rings out, that voice is filled with mournful expression.

Eight of the king’s most powerful abyssal species… were struck by the toxin… before they could even react.

They also let out miserable cries. Their bodies rolled in the void as if they were being tortured endlessly.

Soon, their bodies began to fester and melt.
