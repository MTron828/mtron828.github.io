3688 The seven crazed demons had broken through!

“Dragon Eye Chains!”

“Bang! Bang! Bang!”

One chain after another wrapped around Lei Shan. Wang Xian’s dragon claws disappeared and turned into an ordinary fist. He kept attacking Lei Shan!

Every attack carried the power of the Divine Dragon!

“Ahhhh!”

A series of miserable screams kept coming out of Lei Shan’s mouth!

As an old crazy demon, Lei Shan was naturally very strong.

However, there was a huge gap between him and Wang Xian!

“I’ll give you three seconds to choose. Surrender or Die!”

Wang Xian stretched out his palm and grabbed Lei Shan’s neck. He stared at Lei Shan calmly!

“Cough cough, cough cough, I surrender, I surrender!”

Lei Shan did not hesitate at all and shouted hurriedly.

He made the same choice as Ming Shaisheng and the rest not long ago!

“Swallow the dragon’s blood and summon the universe God Nation over!”

Wang Xian stared at him and ordered!

Lei Shan nodded his head quickly and stared at Wang Xian with a face full of fear. He did as he was told!

Wang Xian’s strength made him feel a little hopeless!

After dozens of seconds, after Lei Shan was suppressed by the Dragon Palace in the God nation, he completely surrendered!

He stood respectfully in front of Wang Xian!

“Hehe!”

Wang Xian nodded his head in satisfaction. His body moved and he flew to the side!

On the other side, Wu Sha, water demon, Ming shasheng, and demon wings were surrounding Shi Sen and sky-shrouding!

In a two-on-one situation, they were no match for them!

However, they could barely hold on!

“Cough cough, Shi Sen, sky-shrouding, surrender. The Dragon King is invincible!”

Lei Shan looked at Shi Sen and the others who were fighting against Wu Sha and said directly!

Shi Sen’s expression changed drastically when he heard Lei Shan’s voice. He immediately looked in their direction!

“You were suppressed by the Dragon King so quickly?”

Shi Sen widened his eyes and roared in disbelief!

“Yes, the Dragon King is not someone we can fight against. If you don’t want to die, surrender!”

Lei Shan nodded and tried to persuade them!

“I’ll give you ten seconds to consider. If you still resist after ten seconds, you will die. Don’t think about reviving with your life-saving treasure. Wu Sha can track your divine kingdom’s Location!”

Wang Xian looked at them and warned them!

He didn’t make a move either. There was no need to make a move now!

They should know what to do!

“I Surrender!”

Shi Sen’s expression changed drastically as he lowered his head slightly.

“I Surrender Too!”

Blotting out the sky was a tree with wood attributes. It had an incomparably huge body!

He transformed into a human and lowered his head as he spoke!

Surrender!

Even if he didn’t want to be a subordinate, the other party had a magus and an old witch. Even if they had a life-saving treasure, they would still be caught!

At that time, they would be completely finished!

“Very good!”

Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled!

If the two mad demons of heaven-shrouding stone forest submitted, he would be able to subdue the seven mad demons!

Each of the seven mad demons could fight against three level one masters of the universe alone!

They were the Top-notch Masters of the Invincible Zone!

In the invincible zone, there were only about ten mad demons.

And now, the crazy demon and the crazy demon prohibition were killed by Wang Xian.

The old witch, Ming Shisheng, water demon, demon wings, heaven shrouding, Shi Sen, and Lei Shan, the seven crazy demons had surrendered!

The strength beside Wang Xian was already very, very terrifying!

After completely subduing Shi Sen, Wang Xian brought them back to the inner part of the ancient Hengxu Divine Kingdom immediately!

“Consume all 200 ordinary embryo fruits. How long will it take for all of you to break through?”

Wang Xian stood in front of them. His gaze swept across the seven of them as he asked with a twinkle in his eyes!

“Dragon King, I will take a few years or a dozen years to achieve a breakthrough!”

Wu Sha was the first to speak!

Water Demon and the rest also made a rough guess!

If it was fast, it would take a few years. If it was slow, it would take more than a dozen years!

“Don’t be in a hurry to achieve a breakthrough. Wait for a dozen years, especially in the invincible zone. Don’t make a breakthrough!”

Wang Xian thought for a moment and said to them!

Experts at the first level of the universe dominator were prohibited from fighting here!

Therefore, they could not break through for the time being!

“In addition, the heaven-shrouding stone, Thunder Flash, bring all the divine fruits, herbs, medicinal pills, and other resources from your universe God country over!”

Wang Xian continued to give them orders.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Who Was Heaven Shrouding Stone Thunder Flash and the rest nodded their heads and replied immediately!

Very soon, a large amount of resources were piled up in front of him. Wang Xian swept his gaze over, and his gaze was a little fiery!

The resources needed for a breakthrough were sufficient!

After another upgrade, his strength would receive another terrifying increase!

“First, I’ll upgrade. Then, I’ll sell the longevity fruit in my hands. Finally, I’ll go hunt the desolate beast space behemoth!”

Wang Xian thought to himself. He waved his hand at Wu Sha and the rest and immediately began to devour the resources!

All sorts of resources and treasures entered his stomach and quickly turned into Dragon Qi!

The Aura on his body was also constantly rising!

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

“Ding! Congratulations to host for breaking through to the level 8 of a universe Knight.”

“Ding! Congratulations to host for breaking through to the level 8 of a universe knight. You have comprehended the law aspect: the Netherworld Dragon’s pursuit!”

Time passed day by day. Five days later, an incomparably terrifying dragon’s might and crisp sounds were emitted from Wang Xian’s dragon body!

At the same time, the system’s voice rang out!

Waves of terrifying aura surged out from his body. The Phantom image of a divine dragon was revolving around him!

“This… The Dragon King has achieved a breakthrough? What a terrifying aura. This aura is not weaker than an existence at the second level of the Universe Dominator.”

Around them, Wu Sha, Ming Sha, and the other crazy demons felt the might of Wang Xian. Their pupils contracted slightly and their faces were filled with shock!

“It’s not weaker than a level two universe overlord. However, the Dragon King has not broken through to the Universe Overlord realm. How is this possible? How can he have broken through so many levels?”

Ming Sha said with a face full of shock!

After reaching the universe ruler realm, one normally didn’t count combat power!

Normally, as long as one could break through to the universe ruler realm, compared to ordinary humans in the universe, one could jump three levels to fight!

If one could jump levels to fight, then there was no such thing as jumping levels to fight!

Hence, one would be classified according to their levels!

A Level 1 universe ruler was a level 1!

It was not the title of a level four universe dominator. This title was used to address those who had not broken through to the level of a universe dominator!

Wang Xian’s current strength was comparable to a level two universe dominator. If he was addressed as an expert who had not reached the level of a universe dominator, he would have the combat strength of a level five universe dominator!

To have such combat strength but not break through to the level of a universe dominator was a little abnormal!

One had to know, according to the terms used by the great beings below the ruler realm, a peak universe knight, even the disciples of a peak race, could only have the combat strength of a universe ruler at level three!

And the Dragon King was two levels higher than them?

What kind of concept was this? 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

This was completely abnormal!

“In the past, the Divine Dragon Clan also had such abnormal existences, the Five Elements Dragon King and the yin-yang Dragon King, but it seems that the five elements Dragon King and the yin-yang Dragon King only gave birth to one each, could it be that our Dragon King is also at this level?”

Wu Sha guessed!
