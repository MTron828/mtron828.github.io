Chapter 585: Famous Throughout Yong Chang (2)

The middle-aged men from Mt. Zhenliu were a little pissed off.

Without that young master’s shop, they would not think that they had lost out a great deal by having Saint Forge Workshop refine Spiritual Equipment and elixir pills for them.

However, it was a stark contrast between the two workshops with that young master around.

Saint Forge Workshop charged way too much.

The two of them could not be compared at all.

None of them were willing to pass their jobs to Saint Forge Workshop anymore.

Yet, the workshop disagreed about refunding the fees for the workmanship when they asked for their materials and fees back.

This infuriated the few middle-aged men from Mt. Zhenliu.

“Guys, I don’t know what you’re thinking, but this isn’t right. The Spiritual Stones that you have given to us were on the condition that we would speed up your job. This works the same as the workmanship fees. Now that you’ve changed your mind, it is natural that we recoup some losses. If you think this isn’t appropriate, you can continue with the job. We’ll deliver the items to you on time. Otherwise...”

Master Xuanhuo spoke with great awe as he swept his cold gaze across the few of them.

As a master, the number one blacksmith master in the largest workshop of Yong Chang City, and one of the bosses of Saint Forge Workshop, he had the right to be prideful.

He had the right to disregard Mt. Zhenliu.

Looking at the domineering and prideful Master Xuanhuo, the middle-aged men from Mt. Zhenliu grimaced as they darkened their faces, exchanging looks with one another.

“Continue our job in Saint Forge Workshop? Master Xuanhuo, we’re not that silly!” a middle-aged man remarked coldly.

“Hur? What do you mean by that? Watch your mouth, people!”

Upon hearing the furious tone from that middle-aged man, Master Xuanhuo’s blood boiled at the same time.

No one could ever challenge a master’s temper.

“What do we mean? Master Xuanhuo, if a workshop requires two sets of materials for a piece of Spiritual Equipment, three sets of materials for four elixir pills, no other Spiritual Stones charges, what would be our choice? Why, Master Xuanhuo? Saint Forge Workshop is overcharging us, and you don’t even allow us to switch to another shop?” said a middle-aged man from Mt. Zhenliu with cold eyes as he looked at the furious Master Xuanhuo.

“Hur? Excuse me? What did you say?”

Master Xuanhuo was slightly stunned by his words as he narrowed his eyes.

“What are they talking about? How can there be such a cheap workshop around?”

“Could... could such an affordable place be around? And it’s refined by a master?”

A few forces and customers around the area were keeping constant attention over here when they overheard the argument.

Upon hearing the middle-aged man, everyone was caught by surprise.

“We already made it clear. The Saint Forge Workshop charges too much as compared to another master’s workshop. It’s only common sense for us to choose the cheaper one. Thus, we’d like Master Xuanhuo to return our materials and refund our workmanship fees!” the middle-aged man said impassively once again.

“Refining a piece of equipment only needs two sets of materials and four elixir pills for three sets of materials. No other Spiritual Stones charges. Where can you find such a good deal?”

Master Xuanhuo’s expression slowly twisted.

“Haha, that’s the truth.” A middle-aged man revealed a cold smile. He raised his voice. “Master Xuanhuo, we would like to take back our materials and workmanship fees. Please return them to us. Otherwise, this will ruin our friendship!”

“You guys...”

Upon seeing the middle-aged men from Mt. Zhenliu standing firm against him, Xuanhuo darkened his expression as he stared at them with flickering radiance in his eyes.

The middle-aged men from Mt. Zhenliu had decided to confront Master Xuanhuo. This time, they did not give in at all.

“FIne. If you are taking back all your things this time, I, Xuanhuo, will not refine anything for you even if you kneel before Saint Forge Workshop next time!”

Master Xuanhuo grimaced and spoke in a low voice.

“Haha, Master Xuanhuo, rest assured that Mt. Zhenliu will never be back to Saint Forge Workshop for any items. We’ll not cross our paths in the future. Haha, goodbye!”

The middle-aged men from Mt. Zhenliu burst out a clap of laughter as they headed outside.

Their actions embarrassed Master Xuanhuo even more.

All the forces and customers fixed their quizzical eyes on the people from Mt. Zhenliu.

Why did they dare to fall out with Saint Forge Workshop?

“Refining a piece of equipment only needs two sets of materials and four elixir pills for three sets of materials. No other Spiritual Stones charges. Is this true?”

Radiance glistened in an elder’s eyes as he stared at the figures from Mt. Zhenliu. With a slight hesitation, he immediately chased after them.

The rest of the forces and customers hurriedly caught up with them.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

If what those people from Mt. Zhenliu said was true, they could save hundreds of thousands of Spiritual Stones when they refined equipment and elixir pills!

“This is impossible. How can there be such a low price. There’s not much profit at all!”

Master Xuanhuo clenched his fist with disbelief.

At such a rate, a workshop would not possibly earn many Spiritual Stones except for some materials.

This was hard for him to believe and he looked dreadful with a constant mix of expressions.

The surrounding workers, blacksmiths, and alchemists were full of surprise as a bad feeling suddenly shrouded over them.

In less than five minutes, those customers and forces who had just left returned to the workshop with a surprised look.

“Master Xuanhuo, we’re taking back our material. Sorry!” a force that had yet to make his payment announced frankly.

“Master Xuanhuo, I’m sorry. We’re going to another place. Look, we did not bring any damage to your business. Can you return our materials and Spiritual Stones?” another force who had paid asked Master Xuanhuo.

“Master Xuanhuo...”

One by one, the customers and forces requested that their Spiritual Stones and materials be returned, as they would not require the services of Saint Forge Workshop.

Seeing this, Master Xuanhuo was stupefied and his heart raced violently.

All the staff in Saint Forge Workshop were plunged into darkness.

The sky seemed to have fallen on them, but why did this happen? What was the reason?

In a shop not far away from Saint Forge Workshop, Wang Xian looked at the forces who were bringing him chests of materials. His eyes glistered.

Hearing that they had come over from Saint Forge Workshop, Wang Xian’s lips quirked slightly.

“Saint Forge Workshop, today’s just the beginning. It won’t take long before you guys fall. You’ll pay an unbelievable price for what you guys did the other time!

“And those young men... be patient. Wait for me!”

Wang Xian swept his gaze across the chests of material while he was filled with fighting spirit.

It won’t be long!

It won’t be long!

Soon, soon!

This world would not be able to contain him.

At that time, he would be fearless against immortals and gods!

Roaring through Yong Chang!
