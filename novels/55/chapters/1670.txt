Chapter 1671: The calm before the 1671 storm

“Let’s go, let’s go, let’s bring all the items!”

“Phew, we can finally leave this godforsaken place. What kind of F * cking assassin organization is this? How can it be so terrifying!”

“Let’s go, let’s go. We won’t come again. We definitely won’t make enemies with the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan in the future. They are simply too terrifying!”

“I wonder where the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan found this assassin organization. Hiss!”

Hearing the orders of the experts from the life and Death Pill Workshop and the holy item forging workshop, countless people in Fengtian city heaved a heavy sigh of relief.

They hurriedly flew out, wanting to leave this damned place as soon as possible.

Even the disciples of the two great factions had their hearts set at ease.

An assassin group had annihilated more than four thousand profound void realm experts of Fengtian city and more than two thousand profound void realm experts of the two major factions within a short day.

This was the first time they had heard of such a terrifying assassination method.

In history, only the underworld assassin group had such a terrifying assassination record.

But in their opinion, even the underworld was not as terrifying as this mysterious assassin group.

At the very least, the dark world’s assassination was carried out at night, and this group of assassins could make people disappear silently during the day.

After everyone packed up their things, they immediately flew in the opposite direction of the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan.

It was a vast and mighty force, five to six million people!

All the experts from the two major factions floated in the sky, their expressions unsightly as they swept their gaze over everyone below. They turned their heads to look behind them, and took a deep breath.

“Although we don’t know what assassin organization The Fire Lark Clan has invited, don’t be complacent!”

“The next time we come, it will be your time to die!”

The five half-step wanshou experts had gloomy expressions as they guarded the team of one million people.

The evacuation of five to six million people in the entire city caused a huge commotion within a radius of hundreds of thousands of kilometers.

In the central continent region, there were five invincible empires. Other than these five empires, there were only seven to eight second tier powers.

In the past one to two years, the battle between the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan and the life and Death Pill Workshop had attracted the attention of all the powers.

Even the five great empires were paying attention to this battle.

When these powers learned that the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Workshop had abandoned the city and left, all the powers were dumbfounded!

“What’s going on? Aren’t the two major forces in an advantageous position now? Why did they run away?”

“Go and find out what happened. Logically speaking, the war has already reached such a stage. The two major forces have paid so many resources. It’s impossible for them to leave just like that!”

The powerful forces immediately issued orders to find out why the two major forces had directly retreated!

“The Rufa Sect’s nine divisions city is up ahead. Let’s go, let’s go to the nine divisions city to rest for a few days!”

The Army of five to six million people arrived at the nearest city after traveling for five to six hours.

Some of the experts from the mercenary groups and family forces walked straight into the nine divisions city.

All the disciples of the two forces continued to move forward and didn’t stop there.

However, even if the people of the two forces did not stay, there were still three to four million people rushing into nine dispatch city.

This scared all the guards in nine dispatch city.

A few million people. They thought that some force had come to attack them.

After understanding the specific situation, the city guards of nine dispatch city let out a sigh of relief and opened the city gate.

“What’s going on? Why did you leave Fengtian city directly? Did they make peace?”

The city guards couldn’t help but ask curiously as they watched the mercenary groups and clans that were emitting murderous auras enter.

“Stop talking. If we stay in Fengtian city any longer, we’ll probably be finished!”

“It’s too F * cking terrifying. An assassin group infiltrated Fengtian City and actually assassinated over 4,000 insightful void realm experts. Don’t you think it’s terrifying?”

“There are more than ten million people in Fengtian city. Three to four million people were discovered within a day. We only knew that it was an assassin organization, but we didn’t even see the shadow of an assassin!”

“Now, even the people from the life and Death Pill Workshop and the holy item forging workshop have retreated. Many elders from the two major forces have been assassinated!”

The answers one by one were transmitted over, causing all the guards in nine dispatch city to be slightly stunned. Their faces revealed a shocked expression.

“What? Assassin organization? An assassin organization is so terrifying?”

“Even the people from the two major factions have retreated? Is... is this the work of the underworld assassin organization?”

The city guards asked in disbelief.

“It shouldn’t be the underworld assassin organization. It should be even more powerful than them. Alright, Alright, I’m going to enter the city to rest!”

The people from Fengtian city said as they walked into the city.

They left behind a group of shocked nine dispatch city guards.

However, very quickly, this news spread throughout the entire nine dispatch city.

The mysterious and terrifying assassin group!

The Life and Death Pill Workshop’s holy item forging workshop was forced to retreat!

Each and every piece of information stunned everyone!

“Could it be that the two major forces are going to admit defeat?”

Some people said.

“They must have been intimidated by that terrifying assassin organization. Right now, the two major forces are at an advantage. If they retreat, it’s possible that they really won’t attack. Moreover, in the current situation, it’s impossible for the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan to counterattack!”

“This war might end just like that!”

Some people replied.

As a clan that was close to the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan, once Fengtian City decided to retreat, it was equivalent to leaving the fire cloud sparrow clan more than 20,000 kilometers away.

With such a long distance, it was no longer a battle.

“This... Patriarch, according to the news sent by our people hiding in Fengtian City, a mysterious assassin organization assassinated over 4,000 insightful emptiness realm experts in one day!”

“Apart from that, at least three to four million people disappeared overnight. It was all done by that mysterious and terrifying assassin organization!”

At this moment, in Fire Cloud Mountain, the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan who had received the news hurriedly reported to Patriarch Feng Yun.

Their faces were filled with shock.

“What? They retreated? Assassin organization?”

Patriarch Feng Yun looked at the information in his hand, and his face was also filled with shock.

This made her think of the young man she had met three years ago, and the Strange Demonic Beast race following him.

“Patriarch, tell me, is this the assassin organization under Young Master Wang?”

Several elders of the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan asked in bewilderment.

“Besides young master Wang, there won’t be anyone else!”

Patriarch Fengyun said with a sigh. His eyes revealed a trace of excitement, and he heaved a heavy sigh of relief in his heart.

“In Fengtian City, which has a longevity-grade array formation, they can assassinate several million people in a day. It’s really hard to imagine that young master Wang’s assassin organization can almost compare to the underworld!”

An elder said in disbelief.

“If they are retreating, is this war already over? With young master Wang and his assassin subordinates, no matter how many people come, they will still be assassinated!”
