“The relatives and friends of this family are really impressive, let’s just go to our seats now!”

A rather esteemed elder saw that all the guests entering were reputable people from Pengzhou, and he sighed faintly.

“Let’s go in!” Some people made these comments indignantly.

The young chap earlier on had not only pointed at them and scolded them, he even said nasty words to them. This made them feel very helpless. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The other person had such strong connections, even Du Qingshan from the county had to fawn on him. To find fault with that young chap? It was akin to seeking trouble for oneself.

Not to mention that there were others who seemed to have extraordinary identities in the crowd.

“Let’s go in, Xiao Xian!” Uncle Zhang looked with unease as he spoke. His daughter had gotten married off, and things that went against his wishes kept happening!

“Wait a moment, let’s go over, Uncle Zhang.”

At this moment, Wang Xian saw the young chap walking alongside the bride and groom, showing respect as they walked towards the crowd. There was a slight smile on his face with a tinge of arrogance.

“Hmm?” Uncle Zhang looked at Wang Xian with bewilderment.

“Come with me, Uncle Zhang, I cannot take this lying down anymore!” Wang Xian gave a cold look as he turned his head towards Xiao Yu. “Xiao Yu, let’s go over!”

“Mm!”

At this moment, Xiao Yu nodded her head and gave a slight smile as she looked upon the young chap and the bride and groom receiving people with respect.

“Forget it, Xiao Xian, they are mighty, and that Du Qingshan is a renowned character in the county. We cannot afford to offend him.” Uncle Zhang looked on with discomfort as he tugged at Wang Xian’s arm.

“No worries, Uncle Zhang, leave it to me.” Wang Xian looked at Uncle Zhang and gave him a reassuring look.

Uncle Zhang frowned and shook his head. “Forget it, forget it!”

“Then I shall go over with Xiao Yu!”

Wang Xian smiled when he saw that Uncle Zhang disliked getting into trouble. Wang Xian and Xiao Yu then walked towards the direction where the young chap and the bride and groom were situated.

“Sigh, this kid, Xiao Xian!”

Uncle Zhang looked uneasily and went along, as he was afraid that Wang Xian might lose out.

As the young chap and the couple walked in, they immediately frowned and expressed displeasure as soon as Wang Xian and his company of two walked towards them.

“What are you guys here for? Are you trying to pick a fight?”

Just as Wang Xian and his company walked over, Feng Hai stared at them with aggression.

Maybe it was because he was apprehensive about the few people around, therefore he did not start yelling!

However, the few people, including a middle-aged couple, who were talking to the bride and groom were stunned. Some of them even threw curious looks over.

When they saw Wang Xian and Xiao Yu, they were visibly astonished.

“We are here to give you a slap!” Wang Xian looked at Feng Hai coldly and uttered.

“Such harsh words, what kind of upbringing did you have, hmph!”

Xiao Yu, who was also beside Wang Xian, spoke to Feng Hai.

“Xiao Xian and Xiao Yu...”

Standing behind them was Uncle Zhang, looking flustered. He immediately pulled Wang Xian and Xiao Yu back.

“What are Xiao Xian and Xiao Yu doing? Why are they trying to offend that young chap?”

“I think they are trying to dig their own graves. Even Du Qingshan has to be respectful towards that young chap. What exactly are they trying to do?”

“These two people are just fooling around, they think that just because they are rich, they are so great.”

“They had better not bring it upon us. This pair of Wang siblings are just too full of themselves. Just because they have that bit of money, they never realize there are people out there who are even richer and more powerful than they are!”

Just behind them, the people of Feng Lake County were showing signs of uneasiness, as they whispered amongst each other.

“Saint...”

“Damn it, are you trying to dig your own grave! Today, my brother is getting married here, and we have elders here. While I still have a good mood, you better get out of my sight immediately. Otherwise, don’t blame me for being nasty!” At this moment, Feng Hai expressed his anger after hearing what Wang Xian said.

He immediately pointed at Wang Xian and Xiao Yu, shouted angrily and threatened them boastfully. His voice interrupted an elderly man who was just beside and wanted to speak.

The elderly man was astonished, and the middle-aged man and a young man that stood beside the elder were equally astonished.

“Fu*k!”

The middle-aged man beside the elderly man directly spoke a vulgarity and expressed his discomfort and anger.

To everyone’s surprise, the middle-aged man swung his palm in full force and slapped Feng Hai hard in his face!

Smack!

Feng Hai could not even react in time, and even if he could dodge, he would not dare to do so.

The middle-aged man’s palm landed on Feng Hai’s face, and the sound of the slap echoed through the main hall.

This kind of force showed that the middle-aged man did not hold back his strength, and there was even a possibility that a few of Feng Hai’s teeth might have fallen out.

The crowd surrounding them were astonished.

The family of the bride and groom were utterly shocked as they looked at the middle-aged man beside them.

The middle-aged man and his family were notable figures that they had gone through painstaking efforts to invite. If it were not for the sake of their grandfather, the middle-aged man and his family would not even have come.

But they could not figure out why. Why would the middle-aged man directly slap their friend’s face?

However, what shocked the crowd more was the fact that the middle-aged man and the elder were going over to the side of Wang Xian and Xiao Yu immediately.

They bent their bodies, showing a great sign of respect on their faces.

“Saintess, Mr. Wang!”

These three people were not just any other people. They were the Song Family from Pengzhou. The young man was Song Aowen, a disciple from the Thistles and Thorns Sect. The middle-aged man and the elderly man were also participants of the selections conducted by the Thistles and Thorns Sect.

As they saw the future Sect leader of the Thistles and Thorns Sect, aka the honorable Saintess, as well as the Miracle Doctor Wang, even the Song family wanted to fawn over them, so they naturally did not dare to stir any more trouble.

They saluted respectfully.

As to how Feng Hai spoke towards the Saintess and Mr. Wang, they were also not going to relent.

If Mr. Wang said to slap your face, you had to do it.

“Mm!”

Xiao Yu nodded her head; she was the Saintess of the Thorns and Thistles Sect, so it would be more appropriate for her to handle the matter.

Xiao Yu looked at the astonished faces of the bride and groom’s families and gave a faint smile. “Why did you all spout a vulgarity earlier on? Apologize to my uncle now!”

The bride and groom were stunned as they looked at Xiao Yu.

“Apologize. I asked both of you to apologize, you hear me?” The elder from the Song family had a sullen expression as he gave the command to the bride and groom’s families.

“Director Song...we...we...”

The families of the bride and groom left their mouths open in disbelief.

“Do you need me to teach all of you? If this matter is not settled with a solution that we are satisfied with, I think the Lee family can cease to exist in Pengzhou!”

The elder of the Song family stared at the families of the bride and groom coldly. His warm expression had disappeared from his face.

The families of the bride and groom felt a shiver down their spines. When they saw how serious the face of the elder was, they were terrified.

“So...sorry, it was our fault just now.”

Wang Xian and Xiao Yu did not say a word but continued to stare at them coldly.

“I am sorry; it was my fault. Please, I beg of you to forgive us!”

As they felt the icy stares of the three members of the Song family, the silence of the young man and young woman, both of their voices quivered, as if they were about to cry.

“You should apologize to my uncle!” Wang Xian spoke coldly.

“I apologize, apologize...”

The bride and groom were thoroughly afraid. Who did they offend exactly?

Why, why is the Song family treating them with such respect and falling out with us?
