“There are the rules of the cursed spirit village ahead. We must abide by these rules here. Otherwise, we will be attacked by the cursed spirit village.”

The old lady spoke to Wang Xian and walked out slowly.

Wang Xian looked at him and looked ahead.

The rules of the cursed spirit village were as follows:

1: no fighting and display of power.

2: no shouting, disturb the curse spirit village.

3: no inquiring about anything from the curse spirit village villagers.

3 rules, every rule seemed extremely powerful.

But no one dared to disobey.

The curse spirit village cursed people, the terrifying thing was not only their curses.

There was also a very terrifying point, that was the karmic fire!

The so-called karmic fire was if someone chased away the desolate beasts or ordered his battle pet to kill these cursed people.

Then, the instigator would also be cursed.

In fact, if a large number of cursed people were killed, it might implicate other parts of one’s bloodline.

For example, if an expert of a race killed a cursed person, this expert might be killed by the curse. The descendants of this expert and the relatives of his lineage might also be killed.

A person who was cursed could not be killed.

However, such a person would not pose much of a threat to Wang Xian and the rest.

Wang Xian scanned his surroundings and flew into the air. He took out the map of the blessed land.

Looking at the information on the map, he raised his eyebrows slightly.

There was actually the existence of the cursed spirit village on this map.

It seemed that this village had a long history.

Wang Xian mumbled. His body moved and he flew straight in that direction.

There weren’t many experts from other races around. Wang Xian didn’t even see one.

The Cape of the sea was very big. Those who could reach here were all experts.

Very soon, Wang Xian arrived above the sea.

There were seabirds and dire beasts flying around. Some seabirds were covered with strange black tattoos.

These seabirds were also cursed existences.

“Some of the cursed creatures are inheritors of their parents. There are also some of them because of other reasons. It seems like there are some strange places here.”

Wang Xian muttered to himself as a look of vigilance appeared on his face.

He did not provoke these seabirds, so naturally, the seabirds did not dare to attack him.

Wang Xian did not fly in the sky. Instead, he entered the ocean.

The Divine Dragon belonged to the ocean!

After entering the ocean, Wang Xian immediately sensed the existence of powerful aquatic creatures around him.

He narrowed his eyes slightly and ignored them. He continued to fly forward.

Swimming in the corner of the ocean, Wang Xian flew deeper into the ocean. Soon, he sensed that there were some universe knight-level seaweed, sea trees, and other creatures growing below.

Wang Xian did not take them away and continued to fly deeper into the sea.

Some universe knight-level level 1 and 2 treasures were not worth his time.

According to the information on the map, Wang Xian arrived at the location of that area two days later.

On this day’s journey, he also encountered many desolate beasts.

They had the strength of desolate beasts and had the combat strength of a universe knight-level 6 or 7.

When he encountered such a desolate beast, Wang Xian killed it immediately.

“I have arrived at this area.”

When Wang Xian was shuttling through the seabed, he suddenly felt a huge change in the seabed in front of him.

The dark blue seawater turned black, as black as ink. In the extremely deep seabed, there were some strange underwater mountains.

Wang Xian looked at the area in front of him with a curious look in his eyes.

Could there be a paradise in this area?

However, the map given to him by the leader of the Deep Swamp tribe was indeed magical. Even with his strength, he could not destroy it.

To be able to create such a map, his strength was definitely terrifying. The credibility of this place was not small.

He entered this area and continued flying forward.

When he entered this area, he suddenly realized that there was something strange in the surroundings.

“There are no living things and no treasures. There are only these mountains at the bottom of the sea.”

Wang Xian mumbled as his eyes revealed a look of vigilance.

This was because the Cape of the sea belonged to the land of mountains and seas. It was normal for there to be existences at the Overlord level.

Therefore, he had to be careful.

He continued flying in. After flying for another day, he narrowed his eyes and stared ahead.

During this day’s flight, Wang Xian didn’t see anyone in this area.

At this moment, he sensed a special energy fluctuation ahead of him. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

As a member of the Divine Dragon Clan, Wang Xian had a very strong sense at the bottom of the sea.

He hesitated for a moment before he concealed his body and flew forward.

After flying for a minute, he suddenly saw the existence of human figures.

There were many human figures. There were at least a few million of them. They were standing in front of a basin at the bottom of the sea.

There was an extremely strange energy emitting from the basin. This energy even made Wang Xian’s heart palpitate.

“What is the energy in that basin? It feels so strange. Also, what are those human figures doing?”

Wang Xian mumbled as his eyes revealed a look of astonishment.

He concealed his figure and slowly approached the front.

Those millions of figures belonged to humans. Standing at the front were thousands of cursed people with dark tattoos on their naked upper bodies.

They were speaking strange languages. With a wave of their hands, the millions of figures in the surroundings immediately flew into the basin.

“Ahhhh!”

In an instant, screams of pain rang out, and the dark energy in the basin surged towards them. Their faces began to contort, and they began to look ferocious.

The screams of pain continued to echo in their ears.

Some people began to die rapidly and collapse.

However, the faces of the thousands of cursed people at the edge of the basin did not show any signs of change.

Time passed by minute by minute, and after a few hours, dozens of figures crawled out of the basin.

At this moment, their bodies were covered with dark tattoos.

They had transformed into cursed people.

“Huh?”

Wang Xian was extremely astonished when he saw this scene.

“They deliberately transformed into cursed people. Out of millions of people, only a few dozen people survived. This…”

Wang Xian’s expression changed slightly. The scene in front of him was definitely under the control of a powerful race.

Otherwise, he wouldn’t have traded the lives of millions of people for the lives of dozens of cursed people.

He pondered for a while and continued to watch from the side for a few hours. Then, he flew straight ahead.

That basin should be a naturally formed cursed pool in the heaven-opening and primal continent. One would be attacked by the curse if they entered it.

The probability of surviving and becoming a cursed person was very, very small.

Wang Xian did not continue to investigate and continued flying forward.

According to the information on the map of the grotto-heaven blessed land, the powerful grotto-heaven blessed land should still be in the depths.

He continued to fly deeper. A day later, he flew out of this silent area.

The scene at the bottom of the sea in front of him suddenly changed drastically.

An extremely beautiful bottom of the sea appeared in his line of sight.

All of a sudden, Wang Xian sensed the map in the mother nest and trembled.
