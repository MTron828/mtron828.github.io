Chapter 3163: 3162 willow deity venerable helped

“Dragon King, let me help you.”

When this voice rang out, when the Blood Dragon was defeated, and when the woman’s figure appeared under the countless willow branches, it instantly caused countless people to be shocked.

“Who is it?”

“Who dares to participate in our war with the Dragon Palace? They’re courting death!”

When the Patriarch of the bloodthirsty race saw that the blood dragon he had condensed was defeated, a ferocious expression appeared on his face. He raised his head and looked over.

“Damn it!”

The leader of the nine-blade race and the leader of the golden skeleton race both looked over immediately.

“What’s going on?”

The two universe knights from the ancient painting sect also looked over with a serious expression.

“What’s That?”

The woman’s attack instantly attracted everyone’s attention.

The surrounding universe knights also looked over, and their eyes were filled with shock.

At this time, who dared to participate in the war between the Five Great Powers?

Wasn’t this courting death?

“It’s the willow deity knight, the willow deity Knight actually helped the Dragon Palace.”

A Universe Knight looked at the Willow branch hanging down from the sky and exclaimed.

The Willow Deity Knight was a famous existence in the entire Milky Way.

According to what they knew, the willow deity Knight should be at the peak level 2 universe Knight Realm.

However, there were also people who guessed that he was a peak level 2 universe knight and could unleash the power of a Level 3 universe knight.

Willow deity Knight was a well-deserved peak level expert in the Milky Way.

Her reputation was higher than the head of the skeleton clan and the head of the Mist clan.

In the Milky Way, the most respected person was willow deity knight.

Because she established the willow deity dojo, because she was the most neutral expert in the Milky Way.

She did not participate in any racial conflicts.

Her powerful strength and neutral stance made all the races in the Milky Way not dare to provoke her.

But no one had expected that in today’s battle, under such circumstances, the venerable willow deity would actually make a move.

And it was to help the Dragon Palace resist the four great races.

This…

No one could understand.

“It’s our venerable willow deity!”

When the disciples of the Willow deity Daoist sect saw venerable willow deity making a move, they were shocked as well.

They were also very surprised. Why did their venerable deity suddenly make a move to help the Dragon Palace.

“Eh?”

Wang Xian looked at the venerable willow deity who suddenly appeared in the sky and revealed a stunned expression.

Compared to the venerable willow deity whom he met last time, he looked much younger.

“Thank you for your help, Venerable Willow God.”

Wang Xian thanked him immediately.

“No need. I will help you fend off the blood dragon and the dragon skeleton.”

The Venerable Willow God shook his head and said faintly.

“Huh?”

Upon hearing her words, Wang Xian was surprised again.

The Venerable Willow God helped the Dragon Palace fend off the dragon skeleton and the blood dragon?

It seemed that he was very confident in his own strength.

“After this battle, our Dragon Palace will definitely repay venerable willow deity.”

Wang Xian said sincerely.

If he could help the dragon palace at this time, the Dragon Palace would definitely repay him tenfold or a hundred times in the future.

“Hehe, there’s no need. Dragon King, you did me a favor last time.”

Venerable willow deity shook her head and waved the willow tree with her arm.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

In the next moment, countless willow branches in the sky attacked the dragon skeleton and the leader of the bloody clan.

She wanted to fight two of them alone.

“Venerable Willow Deity, do you know that you are playing with fire? !”

The Golden Skeleton Patriarch looked over and roared with an unsightly expression.

Venerable Willow Deity wanted to help the Dragon Palace.

With Venerable Willow Deity’s terrifying power, it was impossible to destroy the Dragon Palace.

Moreover, looking at venerable willow deity who was confident that he could fight two of them alone, he had a bad premonition.

“You dare to say that you want to take on the two of us by yourself? Kill them!”

The blood on the body of the ruthless blood race turned into a sea of blood as they attacked the willow branches.

“Pa! PA! Pa!”

However, the countless willow branches slashed through the sea of blood and continued to attack the blood dragon.

The other part of the willow branches attacked the dragon skeleton.

“Roar!”

“Die!”

When the dragon skeleton saw the terrifying willow branches, the flames in its pupils kept jumping. A flame of the Law of darkness attacked the willow branches.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

However, when the flame of the Law of darkness landed on the willow branches, the willow branches emitted a green glow. It passed through the willow branches and continued to attack the dragon skeleton.

One against two, he was not at a disadvantage at all.

“Kill, kill all of them. Leave No one alive!”

When Wang Xian saw the venerable willow deity taking action, he instantly restrained the dragon skeleton and the Blood Dragon. His eyes were also shining.

He turned his gaze to the side and roared with killing intent.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

As soon as he finished his sentence, a Level 1 universe knight from the skeleton race took a look.

Peng

The huge dragon claw scattered the skeleton, and the destroyed energy instantly killed it.

Roar! Roar! Roar

Thunder roared. Without the dragon skeleton and blood dragon to stop him, thunder exploded from his body and instantly appeared behind nine blade leader.

“Damn it!”

“Damn Willow God Knight, do you know what you’re doing?”

The nine swords clan leader’s heart tightened, and a panicked expression appeared on his face as he shouted sternly.

“Die, Thunder Dragon Punishment!”

Thunder’s voice exploded beside his ears, and thunder opened his huge dragon mouth, directly swallowing the nine swords clan leader.

The Thunder in his mouth landed around the nine swords clan leader, making it impossible for him to escape.

“No, no, no, save me!”

Nine Sword clan leader felt the threat of death, and he screamed in panic.

Roar

However, what greeted him was endless thunder and endless darkness.

He was swallowed by the Thunder, and the Thunder struck toward his body.

“What!”

“Clan leader, Clan Leader!”

“No! Clan leader!”

On Skeleton Island, the Great Beings of the nine sword clan heard the screams of their clan leader, and their bodies trembled violently.

They raised their heads and looked up, their faces filled with death.

Right now, their leader was the only universe knight in the entire nine-blade race.

If their leader died now, their entire nine-blade race would be completely finished.

They would be completely annihilated.

A great being named nine-blade race trembled as he stared fixedly at Thunder.

“Roar!”

However, they soon saw Lei Ming open his dragon head and spit out a corpse.

The corpse quickly fell downwards.

The nine swords race’s clan leader had fallen.

“Hiss!” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Seeing the entire situation change in an instant, the surrounding hundreds of thousands of spectators sucked in a breath of cold air.

In an instant, the experts from the ancient painting sect and Venerable Willow God had made their moves.

The fall of the nine sword race’s clan leader.

The attacks from the four great forces had completely eliminated the nine sword race.

The fall of the nine sword race’s clan leader meant that the Milky Way had lost another primary race of the universe.

“Venerable Willow God’s strength is too strong.”

Everyone sighed in their hearts.
