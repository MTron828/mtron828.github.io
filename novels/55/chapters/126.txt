Sacred Followers Guild!

Yan Family!

To the people of Rivertown, each of them represented a supreme existence.

In particular, one of the two medical sacred sects, Sacred Followers Guild. Any members from the Sacred Followers Guild possessed huge influence.

“Greetings to the senior!”

Those hospital directors in the medical hall revealed an appalled expression. They hesitated before they greeted him respectfully.

No choice, the Sacred Followers Guild was influential in the medical field. They were so strong that even directors had to treat members of Sacred Followers Guild with care.

This was the power of the Sacred Followers Guild.

“Yan Zhongyuan!”

Old Xue, Old Duan and the rest of the Ancient Martial Artists fixed their gazes at the sturdy middle-aged man beside the members of Sacred Followers Guild.

A burly figure with shoulder-length hair made him look a little out of this world, but none of the Ancient Martial Artists on the spot dared to underestimate him.

Yan Family, Yan Zhongyuan. Both names were good enough to hold Rivertown in awe.

Old Duan clenched his fist as he glared at Yan Zhongyuan with hatred in his eyes.

But helplessness took over what was in his eyes.

Yan Family was too strong!

Yan Zhongyuan’s reputation was domineering too.

Old Xue had mixed expressions. Eventually, he took a deep breath and spoke no more.

The group of ancient martial arts experts did not utter a word.

Upon seeing everyone’s shocked and respectful manner, the slim, middle-aged man made a prideful gesture.

“Yan Family, Sacred Followers Guild!”

Wang Xian gazed at Yan Zhongyuan and that middle-aged man with radiance flickering in his eyes.

Both Yan Zhongyuan and the middle-aged man from the Sacred Followers Guild were staring back at Wang Xian with disdainful looks in their eyes.

“How reputable, Sacred Followers Guild and the Yan Family. Hah!”

Wang Xian was composed as he stared at them scornfully.

“Yes, how reputable.” Old Qin swept his gaze across the directors and spoke slowly with a darkened expression.

Those hospital directors dreaded the influence of the Sacred Followers Guild.

The Ancient Martial Artist Families were afraid of the Yan Family.

But, not the Qin Family. No matter how formidable the Ancient Martial Artists were, they were still under the governance of the country. Even the Inborn Experts could not do anything they pleased.

Qin Family, the family that had a long history in Rivertown, was not afraid of the Ancient Martial Artist Family.

Of course, Qin Family would not provoke them since it would do them no good.

The middle-aged man from the Sacred Followers Guild and Yan Zhongyuan took a glance at Old Qin without saying anything. Both of them were not afraid of Qin Family either.

“I, Fang Huazi, heard that there’s a Little Miracle Doctor over here. So, I’m here to look around and spar with him at the same time.”

“When I saw the fascia board on the medical hall, I thought it was inappropriate. I think the medical hall should change its name to Little Worm medical hall. Hah! That would suit it the most!”

Fang Huazi of Sacred Followers Guild jeered as he looked at Wang Xian.

Upon hearing him, Wang Xian revealed a faint, cold smile. “Does that mean that if I think that Fang Huazi is a bad name, I can call you Jiao Huazi?” [1]

“Asshole, you better watch your mouth. Your medical hall just opened for business today, and we are here to challenge you. If you lose, you’ll have to smash your signboard and close down this place. In medical learnings, there’s no first or last. But don’t disgrace yourself when your skill is lousy!”

As soon as Wang Xian finished his sentence, a juvenile jumped out and pointed at him as he bellowed.

“Sacred Followers Guild is here to challenge. This is getting out of hand.”

“Sigh, I never thought that this young man would have provoked the Sacred Followers Guild. We can’t meddle in this anymore.”

“On account of Old Qin, let’s just stay and watch!”

The directors were exchanging conversations in whispers with awful looks.

If it were not on account of Old Qin, all of them would definitely support the Sacred Followers Guild.

It was all about the reputation. The reputation of the Sacred Followers Guild was like a towering mountain to them.

Hence, they were in favor of the Sacred Followers Guild.

If not for the relationship with Old Qin, they could have jumped out and reprimanded Old Qin just to fawn over the Sacred Followers Guild.

The discussion among the directors might have been soft, but Wang Xian heard everything clearly.

He frowned slightly and looked at Fang Huazi whose expression was cold. He had an idea. His eyes were smiling as he said, “Challenge? Ha, fine! Since you’re here to challenge, I’ll smash my own signboard and close down this place if I lose.” As Wang Xian spoke, he slowly strolled to Fang Huazi and looked at him impassively. “But that would be too boring.”

“What? You still want to raise the stakes?” Fang Huazi looked at Wang Xian with sarcasm on his face.

“Since you’re here to challenge me, I will set the rules. If I lose, I’ll close down this place. In addition, let’s put a pair of arms at stake. Whoever loses will cripple their arms!”

Wang Xian stretched out his arm at Fang Huazi with a smiling face while looking at him fervently.

Wang Xian would never lose. Even if it were a dying person, he could prolong his life with Dragon Energy. It would at most consume some of his Dragon Energy.

If consuming some Dragon Energy could impair Fang Huazi, it would be worth it.

Wang Xian stunned everyone with his words. Even Fang Huazi frowned.

“Even your life is not worth exchanging my master’s arms.” A juvenile by the side glared at Wang Xian coldly as he growled.

“Shut up.”

Wang Xian snapped at the juvenile impassively. He slowly sat back in a chair at the side, gazing at them leisurely. “Isn’t Sacred Followers Guild compelling? You don’t even dare to accept the challenge? Hehe, and don’t tell me how precious your arms are. Accept it if you dare. Since you’re here to challenge, you can’t be that chicken!”

“Do you know you’re asking for your own doom?!” Fang Huazi glared at Wang Xian coldly.

“Idiot, I don’t have time for you. Since you’re here to challenge, you might as well place a bigger bet. Get lost if you’re a chicken. You said I’m courting my own doom? Why do you have so much fuc*ing nonsense for a challenge?”

Wang Xian stood up immediately as he spoke to Fang Huazi coldly.

Sss...

The hospital directors around them drew a cold breath as they stared at Wang Xian in surprise.

Guts, he had guts!

If that man from the Sacred Followers Guild is here for a challenge, then Wang Xian is forcing the challenge to go on.

They were unsure if challenging a Sacred Followers Guild on medical skills was considered to be brave or capable.

No matter what, Wang Xian’s imposing demeanor overpowered that man from the Sacred Followers Guild.

Even Yan Zhongyuan knit his eyebrows, staring at Wang Xian doubtfully.

Old Xue and Old Qin clenched their fists as they watched quietly.

“Don’t blame me for it since you want to die so much. Nobody can save you today once you compete with me on medical skills.” Fang Huazi fixed his gaze on Wang Xian.

He was infuriated because of Wang Xian’s challenge.

He was confident that the lad before him would never be his match. But he was angry at Wang Xian’s dominating demeanor. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

He should be the one who dominated the situation.

“Fine, since you agreed, let’s begin now.”

Wang Xian chuckled. “Everyone here will be our witnesses for the competition. The one who loses will impair both arms. I think Sacred Followers Guild would not go back on their word. Otherwise, the entire Sacred Followers Guild will be shameful!”

“You’ll soon find out your outcome for offending me!”

Silver needles were flickering, giving off cold radiance when Fang Huazi rubbed his palms together. “Later, we’ll impair your arms personally!”
