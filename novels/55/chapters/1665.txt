Chapter 1666: 1666 real killers 4

The target was all the insightful emptiness realm experts!

According to Wang Xian’s investigation with his yin-yang five elemental dragon eyes, there were more than 7,000 insightful emptiness realm experts in Fengtian city.

Among them, there were only five experts who were half a step away from longevity.

Wang Xian walked out of the courtyard and scanned his surroundings.

“There are two experts at level nine of the insightful emptiness realm and 15 experts at level eight of the insightful emptiness realm within a radius of 10 Kilometers!”

Wang Xian scanned his surroundings with his dragon eyes of the Yin Yang and five elements. He immediately detected all the experts within the 10-kilometer radius.

“Ao Yao, I’ll leave level eight of the void interpretation stage to you. The rest will be assassinated within the 10-kilometer radius!”

Wang Xian’s voice was heard by Ao Yao and the rest. His body moved and he walked towards the two level nine of the void interpretation stage experts.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Upon hearing his command, the group of strange demons immediately spread out in all directions.

The entire city was their enemy. They could assassinate anyone.

However, Wang Xian would first focus on the insightful emptiness realm experts.

490 strange demons could assassinate experts below level six of the insightful emptiness realm. Nine Strange Demons could assassinate experts below level seven of the insightful emptiness realm.

In addition to Ao Yao, other than half a step to longevity, there was nothing in the entire city that they could not kill.

Moreover, in Fengtian city, there were only around 600 to 700 people above level six of the profound void tier and including experts at level six of the profound void tier. The rest were all below level six of the profound void tier.

Those below level six of the profound void tier could be easily killed by a group of strange demons.

“I wonder when our Lord Medicine master plans to completely exterminate the fire cloud sparrow clan?”

“I reckon it will be soon. After exterminating the fire cloud sparrow clan, we won’t have to stay in this damned place every day!”

The two old men who had just walked out from the center of the city returned to a luxurious courtyard, their faces carrying excited smiles.

Obviously, the scene they had seen just now made them extremely happy.

“Pu Pu!” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“It’s not certain who will exterminate who!”

A sudden sound was heard. The two experts who were walking happily a moment ago did not have any reaction and fell to the ground immediately.

With a wave of Wang Xian’s arm, the corpse disappeared immediately.

“Let’s go and see if there are any resources!”

Wang Xian thought to himself as he scanned the entire luxurious manor with the Dragon Eyes of the Yin-yang five elements.

“HMM? A few spiritual herbs, and they are all at the ninth level of the void interpretation realm. Not Bad, not bad!”

With a move, Wang Xian came to the back. Looking at the spiritual herbs planted, he took them away immediately.

Just now, he took a look at the interspatial rings of the two of them. In each of the Elder’s interspatial rings, there were dozens of pills at the ninth level of the void interpretation stage.

As the experts in the life and Death Pill Workshop, they were also Master Alchemists.

It was not strange for them to have dozens of pills at the ninth level of the void interpretation stage.

“If I can kill hundreds of level nine void interpretation masters, I have a chance of leveling up myself. It’s a pity that there aren’t so many level nine void interpretation masters in the entire life and Death Pill Workshop!”

“I wonder how many high-grade pills those longevity realm experts have in their interspatial rings. There must be quite a number of them!”

Wang Xian thought to himself.

At the same time, in this Fengtian city where the sun was shining brightly, five hundred strange demons were roaming around the city rapidly.

As long as they found someone alone, they would immediately assassinate anyone who was at the insightful void tier.

“Where are they? Where are the people on the third floor? Did they f * cking escape from the Window? They didn’t pay for their meals!”

When the waiter arrived on the third floor of a restaurant, there was no one on the third floor that was full just a moment ago.

The waiter’s face was filled with astonishment when he suddenly disappeared. He cursed.

The person was gone. He had definitely flown away from the window.

He rarely encountered such a thing.

The waiter hurriedly reported to the shopkeeper.

“Leader, we’re back!”

In the Sky Glory mercenary group, a huge plaque was hanging in front of a manor.

More than ten youths walked into the manor with smiles on their faces as they shouted loudly.

The Sky Glory mercenary group was a mercenary group that belonged to the holy item forging workshop. In the entire Fengtian City, it could be ranked in the top three.

There were more than thirty insightful void tier experts. The leader had the strength of a seventh level insightful void tier expert.

It was definitely a large-scale mercenary group.

“Eh? Where are the leader and the rest? Why is there not a single person in the entire mercenary group?”

When more than a dozen of them entered, they realized that there was no one in the entire manor.

This caused them to frown and their faces were filled with curiosity.

Where were the people?

“Dragon King, there are 530 insightful void stage powerhouses. Finish them all off. There are more than 2,000 transcendents!”

Twenty minutes later, all the strange demons gathered in the courtyard and reported to Wang Xian.

“Let’s go, continue!”

Wang Xian nodded his head in satisfaction. With a move, the group of strange demons entered the storage spiritual bag.

With a flash, he arrived at the top of a six-story building on the street.

An elder who was inside was slightly stunned.

“You Are...”

“PFFT!”

“You don’t need to know who I am. We are the ones who are going to kill you!”

Wang Xian mumbled as one by one, the strange demons came out from the storage bag.

“Take care of everyone within a ten-kilometer radius and return here!”

Wang Xian said to them as he flew out.

The group of strange demons hid themselves and spread out in all directions vigilantly.

They didn’t have the strength of Wang Xian. In the entire Fengtian City, no one was able to discover his figure.

“PFFT! PFFT! PFFT!”

With ease, Wang Xian casually killed all the experts at level nine of the Seethrough realm.

Around half an hour later, the strange demons returned one by one.

“Dragon King, over 700 experts of the Seethrough realm were assassinated!”

Ao Yao reported.

“Let’s go, let’s continue!”

“You must be careful during the assassination. It’s best not to be discovered!”

Wang Xian gave a reminder and continued flying to the next location.

With his teleportation, the entire city that was more than 200 kilometers was not considered to be very big.

They had assassinated more than 2,000 insightful emptiness realm experts at a distance of 10 kilometers and 10 kilometers. Before the sun set, they had assassinated more than 2,000 insightful emptiness realm experts.

More than 2,000 people. This was a huge number.

However, during this period of time, the place where Wang Xian and the rest had assassinated caused a commotion.

“What’s going on? Where’s the leader of the Tianwei mercenary group? Did We agree to go out tonight?”

“Where’s Jiang Beiyuan’s artifact master? He’s going to the artifact refining workshop tonight. where is he?”

“Where did the commander of the city guards go? Why haven’t we found him yet?”

In the whole afternoon, more than 10,000 people had disappeared from Fengtian city.

As more and more people disappeared, the commotion became bigger and bigger.

Some people didn’t pay attention to their disappearance at first, thinking that they might have gone to other places.

But as time passed and they saw that some people had also disappeared, they began to suspect.

Especially the disciples, deacons, and even elders of the forging workshop and the holy item forging workshop who had disappeared.

In the evening, when this matter was reported to the elders of the two major forces, all of them revealed astonished expressions.
