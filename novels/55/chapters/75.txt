Chapter 76: Whose Fireworks?

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

When the dinner ended, it was already around 11 pm. Wang Xian was surprised to see two beautiful girls still around after sending off Old Qin and Old Xue.

“Are you not going home too?” Wang Xian gave a gentle smile and asked Lan Qingyue.

Wang Xian wasn’t very familiar with Lan Qingyue. The number of times they had met and chat could be counted with a single hand.

Nonetheless, his impression of Lan Qingyue was still very good. It was especially so after the incident at the banquet. With regard to this cold-looking girl, he did have some good feelings for her.

However, such feelings hadn’t reached the level he had for Guan Shuqing.

“It’s late now. I’ll probably head back to the dormitory to sleep.” Lan Qingyue smiled, looking to Guan Shuqing before asking Wang Xian, “Are you heading back to the dormitory too?”

“Yeah, I can’t possibly be sleeping in the restaurant.” Wang Xian smiled and turned to Guan Shuqing. “Let’s go, it’s pretty late now. Let’s head back!”

“Alright! In that case, let’s walk back. Your motorcycle is unlikely to fit three people!” Guan Shuqing joked.

“That’s true!” Wang Xian replied with a smile. This darned heavy-duty motorcycle had problems fetching an additional person, let alone ferrying two people.

“Let’s walk back together!” suggested Wang Xian.

“Sure. I’m feeling so full from the dinner. Walking back can help in the digestion.” Guan Shuqing nodded her head.

Lan Qingyue felt a little uncomfortable listening to the conversation between the two of them from the side. Nonetheless, she squeezed out a smile on her face. “The night skies are really beautiful today. Let’s walk back together. I wonder if the people from the school would kill you with their gazes if they saw you walking with two beautiful girls!”

“Haha, that’s true. You two are well-known beauties of our school and considered as goddess-like existences! I’ll probably walk slower on our way back in a while!” Wang Xian chuckled.

Lan Qingyue was to his left in a black dress and had the disposition of a cold-looking goddess. Guan Shuqing was to his right and had a faint smile on her. She had the disposition of a cute and adorable goddess.

Both of them were very tall because of their fine family backgrounds and were considered by many as goddesses.

Guan Shuqing rolled her eyes at Wang Xian before commenting, “Let’s go, let’s go. Thank you, boss, for treating us to such a great dinner today!”

“Yeah, Xiao Xian. If there’s something so delicious in the future, don’t forget to call me along.” Lan Qingyue added in a hurry.

“Sure, that’s not a problem. If there’s anything delicious in the future, I’ll call you along.” Wang Xian walked between the two beautiful girls and could smell two different fragrances. This made his face light up with impish glee!

“Xiao Xian, I really have to thank you for this. Because of you, our Lan Family has gotten closer to Qin Family.” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Oh yeah! Xiao Xian, my father has been thinking of apologizing to you for that incident. He would like to ask you out for dinner but I told him that you aren’t free...”

Along the way, Wang Xian realized that Guan Shuqing and Lan Qingyue had many things to talk about. All he could do was to nod his head in approval while listening.

They started from their families to interesting incidents that happened in school. Throughout the journey, it was an enjoyable experience for all of them.

After sending the two girls to the girl’s dormitory, Wang Xian waved and bade goodbye to the two of them.

“See you tomorrow!” Guan Shuqing looked to Wang Xian and waved back.

“Sure!”

Wang Xian nodded his head and waved at them before heading back to his dormitory.

Looking at the back view of Wang Xian, Lan Qingyue and Guan Shuqing suddenly quietened down. A unique atmosphere started forming around them.

“Junior, I wouldn’t just give up.” Suddenly, Lan Qingyue broke the silence. She flicked her long and silky hair and exhibited a strong sense of confidence.

“I have more interactions with him and that’s an advantage!” Guan Shuqing smiled radiantly and said to Lan Qingyue. She was also exhibiting the same confident disposition.

“Fair competition!” Lan Qingyue looked at Guan Shuqing before walking up the stairs.

Looking at her back view, Guan Shuqing suddenly had a bitter feeling. She mumbled, “Although I’m confident, my mum said that all men would eat from their bowl but stare at what’s inside the pot. It is especially so when there’s such a tasty piece of meat in the pot...”

Wang Xian didn’t know about the conversation between the two girls after he left.

When he got back into the dormitory, he took a shower and stretched his back.

It had been extremely tiring for him over the last few days as he was actively looking for Chinese Bahaba fish and Atlantic Bluefin Marlin.

However, just as he was about to get into bed, his expression changed.

“Damn it. Disturbing my rest.”

Wang Xian immediately put on his clothes, walked out of his dormitory and ran quickly towards First-grade Restaurant.

In the wee hours of the day, he moved like a phantom. If one simply used his naked eyes, all he could see was a black figure flashing past him.

“Brother-in-law, would there be a problem if we burned down his restaurant!”

At the entrance of Old street, a luxurious Bentley was parked at the left side of the road.

Within the car, a young man was sitting in the driver seat. Director Xie was sitting beside the driver seat and a young man was sitting in the back of the car.

“Rest assured! A restaurant catching fire is just a small issue. Moreover, what can they possibly do even if they can find some traces?” the young man in the driver seat said with indifference as he smoked.

“Thank you, brother-in-law. If we didn’t have you, I really wouldn’t know what to do.” Director Xie was sitting beside and kept a very low profile.

“This is just a small issue. Look for me if you encounter any issues in Rivertown. I’ll settle it for you,” the young man said nonchalantly as though burning down a famous restaurant was nothing in his eyes.

“Brother-in-law is from one of the top Ancient Martial Arts Family in Rivertown. We weren’t intending to disturb you initially and wanted to invite you over for a meal. However, we encountered this troublesome incident.” Director Xie smiled.

“Hehe, it isn’t too late if you invite me a few days from now. Come, let us enjoy the fireworks!” The young man retracted the roof of the Bentley.

“Fireworks, fireworks!” The juvenile sitting in the backseat revealed an excited expression.

Director Xie’s lips curved slightly and gave a cold and faint smirk. He was already thinking of going to witness the despairing look on that brat the next day.

Mess with me? You aren’t qualified! Although Xie Family’s influence isn’t in Rivertown, I could still easily crush you!

Director Xie took out a cigarette leisurely and waited patiently for the fireworks to start.

Swoosh!

However, they hadn’t noticed a figure charging over from the side.

Them?

Wang Xian was still able to see the surroundings clearly while running. When his gaze swept passed the Bentley convertible at the road junction, he had a thought.

Swoosh!

In the blink of an eye, Wang Xian had appeared at the entrance of the restaurant.

There wasn’t anyone around Old Street in the wee hours of the day and all the shops were closed. At the location of First-grade Restaurant, two figures were lying down on the floor.

“Dragon King, these two people tried to burn down First-grade Restaurant.”

A burly old man stood at the entrance of First-grade Restaurant and he was none other than Mo Qinglong.

With goods worth several tens of millions in First-grade Restaurant currently, Wang Xian naturally wouldn’t feel safe. Therefore, he had arranged for Mo Qinglong to guard this place at night.

As Mo Qinglong was his bloodline descendant, he could contact Wang Xian through a unique method within a three kilometer radius.

“Martial Artists?” Wang Xian was surprised to see the two unconscious people on the ground.

“Yes, Dragon King. Both of them are Level Five Martial Artists and could be considered to be quite strong!” Mo Qinglong said.

“Two martial artists?” When Wang Xian recalled the luxurious Bentley convertible at the road junction previously, an image of a young man surfaced in his mind.

“Who would have expected you guys to employ such despicable means. In that case...”

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered and looked away from First-grade Restaurant.

“In that case, I’ll give you guys a firework show!”
