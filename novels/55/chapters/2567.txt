2568 2568 fled in panic

The ninth grade Sky sect leader’s furious roar resounded!

Everyone in the surroundings had extremely ugly expressions when they heard his words!

“What? There are 500 undying godly monarchs attacking our ninth grade sky sect’s commercial planet!”

The three ninth grade sky sect forefathers’breaths were somewhat hurried, their eyes shooting out incomparably violent killing intent!

“Not good, this terrifying attack is still going on!”

At this moment, a terrified voice came from the front. Everyone looked over, and saw countless leaves piercing through the battleship and continuing to attack them!

The battleship was already riddled with holes!

“Defend!”

The faces of the sect master and the three patriarchs of the ninth-grade sky sect changed drastically, and they immediately released a powerful defense!

“The Dragon Palace and the chaotic Tiger Demon Nation have an extremely terrifying array formation master!”

A patriarch couldn’t help but Roar!

“After the array formation master has set up the array formation, he alone can contend against several existences of the same level!”

Another patriarch roared in a deep voice!

Their expressions were extremely unsightly. Such an array formation master might have a slightly weaker offensive power, but it was too difficult to break through the place he was guarding!

Based on the current situation, the chances of their ninth grade sky sect breaking in and destroying the stars were extremely small!

Even if they were able to break in, who knew how many experts would die!

“Eternal god Lord Level Disciples Retreat First!”

A ninth grade Sky sect patriarch clenched his fist tightly and roared loudly!

“Yes, Patriarch!”

The five legions of disciples let out a low roar with an unsightly expression. Their faces were incomparably pale as they immediately returned to their eternal divine kingdom!

This time, they originally thought that even if they could not destroy the other party, they would still be able to turn the other party into a stray dog. However, they did not expect that the moment they entered the other party’s domain, the fifteen battleships would be destroyed!

These were extremely precious battleships!

Looking at the situation now, it was impossible to destroy the Dragon Star and defeat the Dragon Palace, Tiger, and Demon Kingdoms!

“Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!”

At this moment, the wisdom brain of the ninth-grade sky sect master trembled again. He opened it and looked at it, his face was so gloomy that it was about to bleed!

“The commercial planet of the ninth-grade sky sect can’t hold on any longer. Master, take a group of experts and go back immediately!”

The Ninth-grade Sky sect master roared in a low voice!

“Damn it! Damn it! The strength of the Dragon Palace and the tiger demon country is much stronger than we imagined!”

The group of experts took a deep breath. The experts from the demon slaying sect turned extremely pale!

Just now, they had detected that there were 800 undying godly monarchs on the other side. Including the ones attacking their commercial planet, there were more than 1,300 of them!

Now, the ninth-grade sky sect and the demon slaying sect’s godly monarchs were only so-so!

“Go back. Stop fighting. Go back immediately!”

A ninth-grade sky sect patriarch said!

The ninth-grade sky sect master opened his mouth, his expression changing constantly! Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“All of you have gone back, we can’t win, the other side still has two undying godly monarch level 7 experts!”

“Retreat!”

Another patriarch said directly!

“Go back immediately!”

The ninth-grade sky sect master gritted his teeth and growled in a sullen tone!

The group of Immortal Godly Kings looked at each other bitterly and slowly disappeared!

“Dragon King, they all escaped!”

The moment they disappeared, sky array looked at Wang Xian and said with a smile!

“Oh? They escaped just like that? I thought the ninth-grade sky sect was strong, but they are so useless!”

The corner of Wang Xian’s mouth curled up and a mocking expression appeared on his face!

“This... this...”

“Hiss...”

“Oh my God, is this the Dragon Palace?”

At the side, everyone from the chaotic tiger demon nation trembled as they looked at the scene in front of them in shock!

They thought that today would be a fierce battle. However, in reality, they didn’t even need to make a move!

Just that powerful formation grandmaster from the Dragon Palace alone was able to withstand the attacks of the entire ninth-grade heaven sect!

They stared at the fifteen warships in front of them in a Daze!

At this moment, they suddenly felt extremely fortunate!

They had such a comrade, so they had nothing to worry about!

...

Moreover, after today’s battle, who in the entire southern star system would dare to provoke them?

Who would dare to provoke the Dragon Star!

At the thought of this, the faces of everyone from the chaotic Tiger Demon Kingdom revealed extremely excited expressions!

“Am I seeing things? Am I seeing things? The people from the ninth-grade sky sect have escaped. They have returned in defeat!”

In the surrounding area, those who were prepared to watch the show revealed shocked expressions when they saw this scene!

They saw the undying godly monarch experts from the ninth-grade sky sect leave one after another and the fifteen warships that had been destroyed!

Who would have thought that it would end like this?

The Dragon Palace and chaotic tiger demon country had only relied on that terrifying array formation to destroy the entire ninth grade sky sect!

“This is too strong. Such a terrifying dragon star is practically invincible. It’s impossible to break through!”

“Hiss, the star South star system will have a new king in the future, a true king!”

Some undying godly monarchs were extremely shocked!

...

“Look at the AI, the ninth grade Sky sect’s commercial planet has suffered huge damage!”

At this time, an undying god King exclaimed!

Everyone immediately opened their AI to look!

“Boom Boom Boom!”

At this moment, the sounds of explosions, flames, and fleeing filled the ears of the ninth grade celestial business planet!

In the sky, battleships were fighting against the 500 undying God kings that had suddenly invaded!

However, these 500 undying God kings were on their planet, and the attacks from above had also indirectly caused a terrifying aftershock!

The 500 undyings that had suddenly appeared, in less than a minute, caused a large area of the 9th grade celestial trade planet to be destroyed!

The remaining 400 undyings were extremely anxious, they didn’t even dare to unleash their full strength in battle!

Because once they really started fighting, the entire 9th grade celestial trade planet would be destroyed!

Luckily their planet had a layer of defense system, able to withstand a few attacks from level 7 undyings!

However, this could only protect the entire planet, not the buildings above!

“These are the warriors of the Dragon Palace, what the hell is Grade 9 Sky clan doing? Aren’t they attacking the Dragon Palace and Tiger Chaos Demon Country? How did they get attacked Back!”

“Yeah, what’s going on, who’s attacking who, if this goes on, the entire planet will be finished!”

Many undying godly monarchs were guarding their businesses on the commercial planet, their expressions extremely ugly!

Just a moment ago, the AI was still discussing how long it would take for the ninth grade sky sect to completely destroy the Dragon Palace and the Tiger Chaos Fey Kingdom!

It was discussing whether the dragon star would be destroyed!

It was unknown if the dragon star would be destroyed, the ninth grade sky sect’s commercial planet was about to be destroyed!

“Damn it, everyone from the Dragon Palace, you deserve to die!”

In the sky, the sect master of the ninth grade Sky clan rushed toward their commercial planet as fast as he could!

Seeing the flames of war on the planet, his eyes were blood-red as he roared furiously!
