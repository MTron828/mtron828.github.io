Chapter 415: The Dragon Sect Assembly: Fifty Inborn (1)

A Level 5 Alchemy Furnace was able to support the refinement of Elixir Pills of Level 5 and below.

That made an Alchemy Furnace far more valuable than an Inborn Spiritual Weapon.

Although this was merely a Level 5 Alchemy Furnace, it would be no exaggeration to say that its worth was equivalent to an Inborn Spiritual Weapon.

Yet, in the hands of one who did not know how to refine Elixir Pills, an Alchemy Furnace would then be worth nothing more than an ordinary Level 9 weapon.

“An Alchemy Furnace?” Mogul Sun asked with a puzzled look, upon Wang Xian’s shriek of astonishment.

Obviously, he had no idea that this little Chinese cauldron had been an Alchemy Furnace, as they were very common throughout ancient Chinese history.

The Chinese cauldron had made up a huge proportion amongst the Chinese bronzeware. In ancient times, they had been used by people for cooking and storing meats, along with holding incense or joss sticks as a ritual offering to the gods, before it served as an Alchemy Furnace.

Had it not been for the heat which this little cauldron radiated, Mogul Sun would have deemed it to be like any other ordinary cauldron.

“That’s right, an Alchemy Furnace it is!” Wang Xian cheered in excitement, as he gave the side of the Alchemy Furnace a gentle pat.

Zing!

The Origin Source Flame for refining Elixir Pills was sent straight into the Alchemy Furnace.

Vroom!

The Alchemy Furnace came to life as if it had been revitalized. It emitted a gentle red glow while a flame was ignited and shot into the air.

But the heat was latent, and could not be felt from the exterior of the Alchemy Furnace.

With a swing of his arm, the entire Alchemy Furnace suspended mid-air, and he gave it a second pat.

Zing, zing!

The light and crisp tingle sounded once again before Wang Xian peeked into the Alchemy Furnace. As expected, twenty-five crimson bronze wares appeared inside.

All of which were emitting bouts of gentle glow.

The refinement of a Level 5 Elixir Pill would require twenty-five types of Spiritual Grasses which was why there were twenty-five bronze wares within the Alchemy Furnace to hold the individual Spiritual Grasses.

This also meant the maximum capacity of this Alchemy Furnace when it came to the refinement of Elixir Pills.

Sun Longxuan and the two Saints from the Dark Sect had just entered the room when they saw the Alchemy Furnace suspended in mid-air in front of Wang Xian. At the sight, the trio was in awe.

They could sense a formidable force of Flame Energy brewing from within the Alchemy Furnace.

Around them, the crowd looked on at the Alchemy Furnace as it remained suspended while glowing in red light. The miraculous sight had also taken these business magnates of the Southern Province, as well as the Family Heads of various Ancient Martial Artist Families, by utter surprise.

“Haha, not bad. Not bad indeed!” Wang Xian laughed. With a swerve of his arm, he had the Alchemy Furnace lowered onto the ground.

“Here’s ten Level 3 and ten Level 2 Elixir Pills. Should you want to refine Elixir Pills in the future, you can come to me. I’ll refine them for you free of charge!” Wang Xian exclaimed. With a huge wave, he tossed all the Elixir Pills in his hand over to Mogul Sun.

“What? Ten Level 3 and ten Level 2 Elixir Pills!” Mogul Sun shrieked. He had an inkling when it came to the worth of Elixir Pills and knew that those in his hands were worth several billion.

Furthermore, they could not even be bought with money.

Sun Longxuan stared at the multiple Elixir Pills with a burning gaze.

Elixir Pills were something that even he had not had the chance to consume prior. To think that Wang Xian could actually toss over twenty of them right now...

No doubt a wicked talent.

“This won’t do, this won’t do! I’m embarrassed to admit it, but I didn’t even know of the uses of this little cauldron. Since you have uncovered its purpose, this means that it has an affinity with you, Miracle Doctor Wang. Hence, this Alchemy Furnace shall be my gift to you!” Mogul Sun explained hurriedly.

“Take it, I won’t take advantage of you either. The value of a Level 5 Alchemy Furnace is worth far more than these!” Wang Xian dismissed with a wave, not the least bit concerned about the offer he had made.

Other than those Level 4 to 5 which would be very useful to him, these Elixir Pills of Level 2 to 3 served no purpose for him otherwise.

To the point where they were useless even to Xiao Yu, Guan Shuqing and the rest. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“This...,” Mogul Sun uttered in hesitation. But he declined to comment further upon seeing Wang Xian’s elated look.

“In that case, thank you, Miracle Doctor Wang. Take a look, and see if anything else catches your eye!” Mogul Sun exclaimed in all smiles as he gestured to the items on the counter.

Wang Xian shook his head leisurely after a sweeping glance.

It had been unexpected jubilation to have received an Alchemy Furnace from this place. He had no desire for anything else.

In the deals that followed, nothing else caught his eye, while the best items were merely the few which Mogul Sun had brought out.

However, Wang Xian had been very amazed by the items produced by Sun Longxuan.

There was a pair of wings, crafted using Grade 9 metallic. When worn, these metallic wings would allow a Martial Artist to fly in the air.

These wings were very helpful in the directing and honing of one’s internal energy. With extended cultivation, one might even be able to fly unaided simply by prodding their own body thereafter.

“Brother Xian, isn’t this really incredible? It caused me such great pains to come up with this!”

“Sis-in-law, take a look at this bangle. With a gentle press, it’ll transform into a glove!”

Sun Longxuan introduced it to Wang Xian and Lan Qingyue as he stood by the couple’s side. He beamed brightly upon seeing their interest in his creations.

As if a completely changed person, he turned from an arrogant and prideful Young Master to a flattering underling.

There were times when one would be jealous of others who were a little better than themselves.

Yet, when the abilities of others had reached a certain benchmark, even the jealousy of the weaker party would be replaced with admiration and respect.

Wang Xian nodded as he looked at the items and asked, “So you know Equipment Refining?”

“Equipment Refining? I don’t think it’s considered as such. The Lu Ban Technique terms this as Equipment Craftsmanship!”

With a puzzled look, Sun Longxuan replied while shaking his head.

As opposed to Equipment Refining, Sun Longxuan did not have the means to conjure up powerful weapons through refining. Yet, given a combination of metallic elements, he was able to create formidable weapons.

And the weapons created would be unique ones, such as wings and automobiles.

“Equipment Craftsmanship? That’s very befitting. It’s very similar to Equipment Refining, but more dependent on the use of metals,” Wang Xian remarked.

“While Equipment Craftsmanship is also about improving inferior things and making them better,” Sun Longxuan added.

“Nonetheless, this Equipment Craftsmanship is also very impressive!”

Be it Equipment Refining or Equipment Craftsmanship, it did not matter. What Wang Xian had most desired were Inborn Spiritual Weapons.

The ascension of the Dragon Field had required a thousand Inborn Spiritual Weapons.

It was ten at night by the time he arrived at Rivertown.

After two hours of activity on the bed, Wang Xian headed over to the floating island.

“Young Master!” Mo Qinglong and Mo Yuan greeted respectfully. They had been staying on the island but came out to receive Wang Xian upon sensing his arrival.

“Hmmm,” Wang Xian nodded. “How many amongst the Dragonians have attained Inborn status?” he continued to ask.

“There are already thirteen of them, Young Master. While the rest are also about to step into the Inborn Realm!” Mo Yuan answered.

“Given twenty days, can all of them achieve Inborn status?” Wang Xian asked overtly.

“Yes!” Mo Yuan responded without wavering in the slightest.

“Gather all of them, and call them over. We’re close to the New Year!” Wang Xian instructed before strolling over to the Spiritual Medicine Garden.

“It’s time for the Dragon Sect’s comeback,” Wang Xian commented, “and also time to compete within the underworld!”

He smiled, as the edges of his mouth arched upwards.

That day would be coming very soon!
