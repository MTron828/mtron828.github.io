3752 3751, the death of the Skyfire Patriarch

The Skyfire Patriarch hovered in the air, his expression constantly changing!

Especially when he heard the words of the two experts of the Phoenix clan, he had a bad premonition in his heart!

The situation in front of him was already very obvious!

The Phoenix clan would not let him off so easily.

As for why they would not let him off, why they would make such a big fuss about it, it was very obvious that it was because of his opportunity!

A tree that stands out in the forest will be destroyed by the wind!

He was still too high-profile!

The speed of his improvement was too fast!

It had even attracted the attention of the Fire Phoenix, the peak race!

Once he followed them, it was very obvious that he would either hand over all the good fortune or die.

In fact, the fire Phoenix race might even kill him to prevent him from taking revenge, even if he handed over the good fortune.

The world of the strong was just so tragic.

“Two fire Phoenix Lords, can you give this lowly one a chance to atone for my sins?”

Sky fire ancestor bowed and asked with an embarrassed expression.

The surrounding disciples pursed their lips when they saw this scene.

They could faintly guess the meaning of these two fire phoenixes.

They were trying to steal the treasure!

“You talk too much nonsense. I’ll give you two seconds to choose!”

The fire Phoenix’s face darkened when she saw his refusal. She said coldly!

Sky Fire Patriarch was stunned. His expression kept changing!

“This lowly one is guilty this time. Please punish me, Lord of the Phoenix Clan!”

Sky Fire Patriarch took a deep breath and bowed again!

It was impossible for him to go with them. With the strength of a peak race, he didn’t know what would happen.

In this place, under the gazes of the surrounding disciples, there was only one last glimmer of hope!

“You’re courting death!”

However, Patriarch Skyfire was somewhat frightened because one of the fire phoenixes didn’t hesitate at all. As soon as he finished speaking, his figure instantly appeared beside Patriarch Skyfire!

His phoenix claw instantly grabbed Patriarch Skyfire’s head!

“What! ?”

“No!”

Patriarch Skyfire’s face was filled with terror and despair when he saw this instant of destruction!

“Patriarch!”

The expressions of the surrounding disciples of the Skyfire sect changed drastically as they shouted!

However, no one dared to make a move at this moment!

And no one had the strength to make a move.

“Pu!”

The Phoenix Claw landed on the head of the heavenly fire patriarch and crushed it. The terrifying power of the Flaming Phoenix directly submerged the body of the heavenly fire patriarch!

The heavenly fire patriarch was instantly submerged!

His strength was only at the second stage of the ruler realm. Compared to the third stage of the ruler realm of the Flaming Phoenix, he was still far from it!

“Hiss, killed. The Phoenix clan actually killed the Skyfire Patriarch.”

“This… this… This is a direct attack to kill him!”

“This Skyfire Patriarch is too miserable. It wasn’t easy for him to rise up, but he was killed by the experts of the Phoenix clan. This…”

All the surrounding experts and disciples didn’t expect this scene.

They watched in shock.

As the first Skyfire Patriarch to break through, as the first high-level race expert to reach the second stage of the ruler realm, the Skyfire Patriarch was undoubtedly everyone’s hope and motivation.

Everyone hoped that they would be able to obtain a great opportunity like the Skyfire Patriarch.

But now, the Skyfire Patriarch, who had obtained a great opportunity, had actually been exterminated by the peak race, the Phoenix clan.

This? ?

“You don’t know what’s good for you. How dare you challenge the dignity of our Phoenix Clan!”

After killing the Skyfire Patriarch, the Phoenix’s eyes were filled with hostility. He sensed the corpse of the Skyfire Patriarch and waved his arm to put it away!

At the side, Wang Xian’s eyes flickered when he saw this scene.

This peak race was really unscrupulous.

The motives of the two fire phoenixes were too obvious.

It was so obvious that everyone could tell that they were here for the resources of the Skyfire Patriarch.

He swept his gaze across the two fire phoenixes and then looked at the fiery star occupied by the fire phoenixes not far away. The corners of his mouth curled up slightly.

All the strong disciples around watched this scene and didn’t dare to say anything wrong!

“Is this the Phoenix race? Sky Flame ancestor from a high-level race obtained a huge opportunity with great difficulty and broke through to the ruler realm with great difficulty, but he was killed by all of you. Hehe!”

“The resources of the nine-origin universe were originally occupied by your peak race. Now that the high-level race obtained a huge opportunity, they are still being coveted and killed by your Phoenix race. The disciples of other high-level races are truly ants to your Phoenix race!”

However, at this moment, a voice suddenly resonated in the surroundings and entered everyone’s ears.

When everyone heard this voice, they were slightly stunned. Their faces were filled with astonishment and shock.

They immediately looked towards the source of the voice!

Everyone’s gaze landed on that figure.

The one who said this was naturally Wang Xian.

Regarding the scene just now, if it were any other race, Wang Xian might not have opened his mouth and would not have provoked the other party for no reason.

However, it was different if the other party was from the Phoenix race!

He had a grudge with the Phoenix race!

“Huh?”

When the two fire phoenixes heard Wang Xian’s sarcastic words, their expressions darkened and their eyes were filled with coldness!

Their terrifying aura charged directly at Wang Xian!

“You dare to Talk About Our Fire Phoenix Race? You are courting death!”

One of the fire phoenixes growled in a low voice with a face full of killing intent!

That terrifying flame swept across. Even an expert at the first level of the Overlord realm would be incinerated instantly under this flame.

However, what shocked everyone was that the flame was completely useless.

That figure was still standing there indifferently!

“He… He seems to be the Dragon King. That’s right, he’s the Dragon King!”

“Dragon King? The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace. With that face, he should be the Dragon King.”

At this moment, someone recognized Wang Xian.

The Beast Skin created by Lin Wenluo was in the center of the heart of the fire treasure ground. Wang Xian’s appearance was no longer concealed!

In addition, he was able to resist the faint aura emitted by the flames. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Immediately, some experts recognized him.

The current Wang Xian was a very famous expert in the nine-origin universe.

He was the Dragon King who led the Dragon Palace and was about to step into the peak race again. He was an invincible existence that swept across the invincible zone.

“Hehe, as expected of the Phoenix race. They treat those below the peak race as ants. Back when I was in the invincible zone, the experts of your Phoenix race secretly sent their disciples to kill me. Now, because the Skyfire Patriarch obtained a powerful opportunity, he was killed by you with a simple reason. How Powerful!”

“Why? Do you still want to kill me now?”

Wang Xian stared at them and asked with a face full of mockery.

His words once again caused everyone around to be filled with shock.

At the same time, the eyes of the powerhouses’disciples flickered slightly.
