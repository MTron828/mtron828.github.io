Chapter 682: 0683 killing the immortals and slaughtering the gods (third update!)

Translator: 549690339

The giant snake went completely berserk, and the surrounding seawater rolled like a terrifying tsunami!

“If you want to kill me, I’ll make you pay a heavy price!”

The giant snake’s expression was ferocious. He stuck out his terrifying tongue, and when his tongue landed on the surface of the sea, it made a sizzling sound.

He wanted to kill over a hundred dolphins. This wasn’t F * cking killing your entire family, it was just over a hundred dolphins.

For the first time, he heard that he was going to fight an immortal God to the death for such a ridiculous reason.

Ao Jian and Ao Qitian’s eyes showed a hint of seriousness. The snake was going to fight with its life on the line.

Once an immortal god was going to fight with his life on the line, even if they were not careful, they might die together.

“Die!”

Ao Qitian held the metal rod tightly in his hand and attacked ferociously.

Ao qitian, who was filled with demonic energy, did not care whether he was going to risk his life or not.

“Shadowless, Shadowless!”

Ao Jian also shouted coldly. The air trembled as sharp swords that could not be seen or made any sound slashed towards the giant snake.

“We don’t care about this matter anymore!”

Boom

In the sky, the old man wearing a red mask was emitting a fiery red light. In the sky above him, balls of fiery red clouds were hurling terrifying fireballs towards Wang Xian!

A solemn look appeared in his eyes. Going against a terrifying force that had four celestials was definitely a terrifying thing.

If he knew that they had four celestials, he would definitely not take advantage of them and help the snake! Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Right now, they only wanted to escape as soon as possible.

“Since we are enemies, then we are enemies. The Flesh and blood of three celestials!”

A hint of coldness flashed across Wang Xian’s eyes. Since he had already made his move, he would not let go so easily.

With the flesh and blood of the three immortals, if it was absorbed by the Dragon Pool, the energy contained in it might be able to allow a member of the Dragon Palace to advance to the immortal realm.

Wang Xian’s body trembled. The entire ocean instantly calmed down. It was as calm as a mirror.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

However, at this moment, countless water swords shot out from the ocean and attacked the red-masked old man in the sky.

The collision of water and fire!

“HMPH!”

The masked old man looked extremely embarrassed. With a wave of his hands, the entire thousand-meter-wide fiery-red cloud fell into the ocean.

Boom! Boom! Boom

A terrifying explosion was heard. The blue light and fiery-red flames covered a radius of several thousand meters.

“I will remember what happened today!”

The old man moved his body and wanted to escape into the distance.

“Water Prison!”

Wang Xian shouted softly and chased after the old man with the terrifying seawater.

“Don’t go too far!”

When the old man saw Wang Xian chasing after him, his 10-meter-long body and his water-blue majestic face made him look extremely embarrassed.

What was this terrifying monster? Was it a divine dragon from China?

“Roar!”

Wang Xian swung his dragon tail and his entire body glowed with a brilliant blue light. Below him, the sea water within a 10-kilometer radius rose into the air and completely enveloped the old man!

“Waterfall Water Blast Wave!”

“Flaming giant body!”

The masked old man looked extremely embarrassed. With a jolt of his body, he turned into a 50-meter-tall figure. The fiery-red mask exuded a terrifying aura as drops of flaming liquid dripped towards his body.

“You forced me to do this!”

The terrifying flame giant turned the surrounding seawater into fog and spread over a radius of more than ten kilometers.

The water from the great waterfall clashed against the flame giant!

At the side, walls appeared out of thin air to block the Yanmei two-headed woman. Prime Minister Gui held the turtle shell in his hand and stared at her with a wise gaze.

“Damn it, do you think you can keep us here!”

The two-headed woman stared at Prime Minister Gui with a sinister look. Her two heads were extremely ferocious.

The terrifying battle between Immortals and gods erupted in an instant!

“Wang Xian... how could he turn into a divine dragon?”

Tang Yinxuan was standing on the Kun below. She raised her head in shock and looked at Wang Xian who had turned into a divine dragon in the distance. Her eyes were filled with disbelief.

“Bloodline!”

Lan qingyue smiled at Tang Yinxuan.

“Bloodline?”

Tang Yinxuan muttered to himself. He recalled the records about the European continent. There were cultivators in the European continent who could transform into werewolves, bats, and demons. This was also a bloodline.

“Immortal God, Immortal God. I didn’t expect his current strength to be so terrifying and powerful!”

Tang Yinxuan muttered as he scanned the surroundings.

Lan qingyue, a Jiaya, and Sun Lingxiu looked at each other and didn’t say anything.

Sun Lingxiu was the kind of girl who didn’t like to interfere in anything. If Tang Yinxuan really had anything to do with Wang Xian, she wouldn’t mind.

A Jiaya was an interloper to begin with, so she didn’t have the right to express her opinion.

Only Lan Qingyue sighed and pouted, then shook her head carelessly.

“Seven immortal gods attracted seven immortal gods!”

“That’s a divine dragon, the legendary Divine Dragon. I didn’t expect there to be a divine dragon in the ocean!”

“That Divine Dragon’s body is simply too perfect. If it could be refined into a slave, it would be the most perfect and powerful mount. Haha, that Divine Dragon, I must get it!”

“Seven immortal gods. I didn’t expect there to be so many immortal gods in the real world. We can only sit back and reap the benefits when both of them suffer heavy losses. Otherwise, we wouldn’t be a match for so many immortal gods!”

“No matter what, I’m definitely going to take that divine dragon as my mount. Hahaha, let’s fight, let’s fight. In the end, both sides suffer heavy losses!”

“What a pleasant surprise! What a pleasant surprise!”

The two pairs of blood-red eyes in the air were filled with excitement and madness. They were watching the battle below.

However, Wang Xian and the rest did not feel that someone was watching them.

“AH, damn monkey, get lost!”

At this moment, the giant snake let out a horrifying scream from below.

He used both hands to Block AO Qitian’s cudgel, but at this moment, five soundless metal swords pierced through his body, causing his expression to change.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

He opened his huge mouth, and his tongue suddenly grew crazily, piercing through AO Qitian’s chest in an instant!

“Roar!”

Ao Qitian roared, grabbed his tongue, and fiercely pulled it over.

“Ah!”The snake screamed again.

“If you want me to die, you won’t have it easy either!”

“Burn the immortal God’s blood and explode!”

The tongue in Ao Qitian’s hand instantly turned red and exploded.

“Boom!”

The entire sea area exploded at the same time like a million tons of bombs.

“Roar!”

Ao Qitian roared angrily, and his body was covered in wounds.

“Die!”

Ao Jian’s expression changed, and he instantly turned into a golden swordfish that was about ten meters long.

Using his body as a sword, he directly slashed at the snake.

However, at this moment, the expression of the snake, who was far more miserable than AO qitian, changed drastically.

“Extremely cold, extremely hot, explode!”

He stretched out his two arms, and fresh blood merged into the water energy, causing another terrifying explosion!
