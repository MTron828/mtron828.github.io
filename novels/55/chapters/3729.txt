3730 Opportunity and danger

The core of the entire vine contained a tremendous amount of energy.

Wang Xian kept it in his hand and sensed the energy. A smile appeared on his face.

The essence of the space beasts were all concentrated in his body. After absorbing it, it would be of great use to the cultivators in the nine-origin universe.

The harvest this time was no less than the last time.

After he put it away, he scanned his surroundings and flew in a certain direction!

Not long after, Wang Xian discovered another life planet. It had only been a few hours.

The life planet was emitting a surging flame energy.

He flew over and immediately discovered an incomparably huge volcano in the center of the entire planet.

There was a special type of metal around the entire volcano.

Wang Xian sensed it carefully. After finding no signs of life, he landed beside the volcano.

“This fire attribute divine stone is very suitable to be used to create spiritual treasures. It is also considered a precious treasure in the nine-origin universe.”

Wang Xian looked at the metal and his eyes sparkled.

In the starry universe, other than some special space beasts that fed on these metal ores, these metal ores were rarely consumed.

Unlike the nine-origin universe, weapons were also a part of one’s own strength. Basically, every powerhouse had several weapons.

However, the space beasts did not use weapons. This also resulted in many metal ores here.

The metal ores that needed to be fought over in the nine-origin universe could be seen everywhere here.

“TSK TSK, the resources in the universe are really rich!”

Wang Xian sighed slightly and stored all the metals.

Following that, he began to search the entire planet.

After storing a large number of divine herbs, pills, and metals, Wang Xian continued on to the next planet.

At this speed, it wouldn’t be long before he could gather all the resources that he needed to upgrade.

“Roar!”

While flying in the air, Wang Xian suddenly heard a roar.

He swept his gaze over and a solemn expression appeared on his face.

Without any hesitation, Wang Xian immediately changed his direction and flew toward another direction.

At this moment, there was no need to offend these space beasts.

After a while, a vibrant continent appeared in his line of sight.

The continent plate that was suspended in the void was covered with a lush forest.

Wang Xian entered and began to search for treasures.

For the next month, Wang Xian flew continuously in the starry universe.

Once he sensed the aura of the space beasts, he immediately hid.

For more than a month, Wang Xian also realized that there were quite a number of space behemoths in the starry universe.

While flying, he would encounter space behemoths every day. There were both strong and weak ones.

For the time being, Wang Xian did not provoke them.

In this short month, he had harvested a large number of treasures and found more than a hundred life planets.

Each life planet had a bountiful harvest.

“Even at this speed, I only need about a thousand years to gather all the resources needed for my breakthrough.”

Wang Xian smiled and continued flying forward.

“HMM? Another Life Planet!”

Soon, Wang Xian saw a planet. This planet was four to five times larger than the one he had encountered not long ago.

“That is?”

Before he could get close, a strong energy was transmitted over.

He stared at the location above the planet with a look of shock in his eyes.

It was a tree that looked extremely thick. The tree was not very tall, but it occupied an area of at least tens of thousands of kilometers.

On this tree, there was a fruit. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

The fruit was at least thousands of kilometers in size.

This was the largest fruit that Wang Xian had ever seen.

Most importantly, there was a strong attraction force coming from within this fruit.

“This… this is such a huge fruit. It contains a lot of energy.”

Wang Xian looked around in slight shock. He did not sense any other life force and was suspended in the air above the fruit!

Compared to the entire fruit, he looked extremely tiny.

“The energy contained in this fruit is extraordinary!”

Wang Xian’s eyes were burning with excitement.

This single fruit was ten times more than what he had gained in the past month!

“This starry universe is really full of treasures!”

As Wang Xian spoke, he slowly landed on the fruit!

Buzz

Just as his body landed on the fruit, he suddenly felt the sky turn dark.

A white light, which was like a cloud, instantly enveloped him.

The sudden change gave Wang Xian a slight shock.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

The next moment, he felt a great terror coming from below him.

A pair of gigantic eyes suddenly appeared on the left and right of the fruit.

This pair of eyes was utterly defeated and contained a strange energy.

“Oh no, this entire planet is a space beast!”

Wang Xian felt the terrifying power of this space beast and his expression changed drastically!

He did not hesitate and wanted to flee into the distance.

Buzz Buzz

However, at this moment, Wang Xian noticed strangely that the white clouds around him suddenly surged into his body. An extremely heavy force was transmitted to him.

He felt as though his body was being suppressed by an endless mountain. His speed had been reduced to the extreme.

“What is this Space Beast?”

Wang Xian’s expression changed drastically. Without any hesitation, a scroll appeared in his palm.

He opened the scroll and a surge of energy enveloped him.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

The space beast below seemed to have sensed something. A huge cloud of mist in its eyes enveloped him.

Fortunately, Wang Xian’s figure disappeared in the next instant!

The scene around him changed. Wang Xian realized that he was surrounded by fiery-red meteorites.

Each of the meteorites carried a powerful force as they flew in the void.

“Huff! Huff!”

Wang Xian heaved a sigh of relief and wiped the cold sweat off his forehead.

He looked at his body and still felt extremely heavy.

“What Kind of space beast is this? What a strange attack. If I were to run slower, I would probably be left there!”

Wang Xian mumbled with lingering fear.

The danger level was really high.

“There are many treasures in the universe, but it is indeed very dangerous.”

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered. If he didn’t have such an escape treasure like the space scroll, he would definitely die.

One had to know that his current strength was comparable to a level two universe overlord.

“Looks like I’ll have to let the ghost avatar explore next time. This way, my safety will be greatly improved.”

Wang Xian mumbled to himself. He was still a little careless.

Sweeping his gaze around, Wang Xian sent a message in the communication stone plate of the Dragon Palace, reminding all the disciples of the Dragon Palace to be on guard.

“Continue!”

After sending the message, Wang Xian cleaned up the strange energy in his body. He scanned his surroundings and flew in one direction.

It was a random teleportation from the spatial scroll. He had no idea how far away he was from before!
