“Chase them off. Chase these troublemakers away!” Director Xie turned and said to the security guard. He darkened his expression as soon as he heard the comments on the stage.

“I don’t need you to chase us off. We’ll walk out ourselves. In any case, the First-grade Restaurant is going to open soon!”

A middle-aged man spoke to Director Xie coldly as he walked towards the First-grade Restaurant.

“You’ll find out who is the best when you walk into the restaurant. How dare you claim yourself as the most generous and luxurious restaurant. Heh, you’re far from that!”

“Sigh, I can’t even bear to look anymore. The top-graded ingredients of the First-grade Restaurant were shared frantically on the Wechat feed. 50% off everything in the shop. Even the One-headed Abalone that is worth 2 million is selling at half price. They even have ten Two-headed Abalones.”

Some people commented while shaking their heads. They left the place and headed to the First-grade Restaurant.

About 80 people left the place with disdainful expressions on their faces as they commented.

Some of the people around were stunned as they had no idea about it. They knew nothing about the top-graded seafood of First-grade Restaurant and the half-priced promotion.

After all, someone had only spotted the top-graded seafood of First-grade Restaurant last night. Despite how fast it was propagated on the feed, many people remained unaware of it.

The surrounding people were somewhat stunned as they watched the group of people departing.

Just then, the door of the First-grade Restaurant was opened. Subsequently, they took out their advertising signboards and set them up in front of the door.

“50% off everything including One-headed Abalone, Two-headed Abalone, Atlantic Bluefin Marlin, Chinese Bahaba fish, and even the Wild Giant Yellow Croakers! 50% off everything!”

A simple advertising signboard with pictures of abalones, Atlantic Bluefin Marlin, Chinese Bahaba fish, and Wild Giant Yellow Croakers.

“Finally, they are opened. Let’s go. I heard they placed all the top-graded ingredients at the entrance. If we get them, the chef can cook it on the spot!”

“Let’s hurry. The first-grade Restaurant has a 50% off promotion, and the place will soon be fully booked. We should start to queue now. Otherwise, we can’t get to eat even if we want to!”

“Hurry, I heard that the boss has arowanas that are worth millions of dollars inside. Gosh! This is way too awesome!”

Those people who left were excited as they ran off hastily when the First-grade Restaurant opened their doors for business.

“Why don’t we check it out too?!” those people in front of the Longxuan Restaurant asked hesitantly when they saw the crowd streaming towards the First-grade Restaurant.

“I’ll check it out to see if what they said was real!”

“Me too. It should not be possible for the First-grade Restaurant to find about 90 people just to act as shills. If what they said was untrue, then they would be smearing their own brand name!”

“That’s right, I’ll check them out too!”

“We’ll wait and see if it is really as awesome as they claimed it would be!”

Some of the people popped over to the First-grade Restaurant while some people were prepared to sit around and observe.

For a moment, no one entered the Longxuan Restaurant. On the stage, Director Xie turned sulky as he held his microphone tightly with killing radiance flickering in his eyes.

“Don’t push, everyone. Line up orderly.”

Manager Huang was excited to see the influx of customers at the restaurant entrance.

“Sorry, we’re really sorry. We’re still in the midst of preparation. So, if you want to have your meals, you might need to wait for more than an hour. You can wait if you’re patient enough!”

Manager Huang yelled at the top of his lungs. His chin was slightly lifted as he was feeling proud.

“Let’s take a look at these displays in front of us. Check out the One-headed Abalone and the Chinese Bahaba fish.”

“Yes, let’s check these out first. Damm, I have never seen One-headed Abalone. Not even a Chinese Bahaba fish.”

“Manager Huang, even the One-headed Abalone that cost more than 2 million...it is also at half price? If someone buys this, won’t the shop be losing money?” the group of people asked curiously as they marched in.

“50% off for everything. This is not empty talk. But all our seafood has to be cooked in the restaurant after purchase to prevent people from reselling our One-headed Abalones,” Manager Huang answered in a loud voice.

“Gosh! It’s true. This is a god-like promotion. A One-headed Abalone at half price means we save over a million dollars!”

“Wow, they are really Chinese Bahaba fish, Wild Giant Yellow Croakers, two One-headed Abalone, and 10 Two-headed Abalone. This is simply amazing!”

“What a huge abalone. One of these costs more than 2 million. This is incredible. Too incredible.”

“What a sight. What a god-damned sight!” Everyone took out their phones to take photos as they exclaimed in disbelief.

“And these arowanas... Gosh, Manager Huang, where did your boss find so many precious arowanas that are worth a few million each?”

“You’re kidding me. Are they really that expensive?”

“Of course. My friend sells ornamental fish. So, I know something about it. These arowanas looked really impressive. They are worth at least a million!”

“Gosh! Then all this seafood and the ornamental fishes would add up to a value of 20 to 30 million. I heard that First-grade Restaurant is owned by someone else now. Is the current boss that wealthy?”

“People in front, please wait inside after viewing. Give the people at the back a chance!” the customers who were waiting behind said in anticipation as they heard the exclamations from the customers in front.

“No hurry, no hurry!” the people in the front answered.

“The people queuing behind are blocking the road. Can the people in front hurry up?!”

The crowd was overwhelming. Some of them entered slowly as they revealed shocked expressions while gazing at the top-graded seafood. All of them took out their phones to snap pictures and share on their WeChat feeds and the internet.

“How is it? Is it true what those people just said?” some of the ignorant people asked the people in front.

“It’s true. Damm. A huge One-headed Abalone, rare Chinese Bahaba fish, and a three-meters Atlantic Bluefin Marlin. This is simply incredible.” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Compared to the First-grade Restaurant, the Longxuan Restaurant is totally crap! The grouper is a joke in front of all these top-graded seafoods!”

“The people in the Longxuan Restaurant are idiots. How could they have the cheek to say the First-grade Restaurant is incomparable to them. It should be the other way around. The two of them are not of the same class. How dare they claim to be generous? They are a disgrace in front of the First-grade Restaurant!”

“Yes, I don’t understand how they have the guts to make such proclamations. They even invited a celebrity over. They are obviously not on par with them. What can they do, even if they get the top stars here?”

Many people were talking about it. Soon, the news spread outside.

Those people were not shills!

What they said was true!

The people outside were dumbfounded when they heard the description from the people inside.

Just like what the angry man had said.

Compared to the First-grade Restaurant, Longxuan Restaurant is crap!

The two of them are not of the same class!
