Translator: 549690339

Mayor Lin Xiao, who was dressed in military uniform, stood on a roof with his hair in a mess. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

He was in an extremely sorry state. There was a long bloody scar on his chest.

At this moment, he looked a little crazy. Compared to the usually arrogant mayor, he was a lot different.

He escaped from the black and white space. His eyes were filled with joy and anger.

That terrifying monster made his scalp go numb. Just now, he had almost been killed.

Strange divine abilities, terrifying concealment methods. He was simply a natural-born King of darkness.

No, that terrifying monster didn’t only have the darkness attribute, it also had the light attribute.

A variant, a terrifying variant.

However, when he escaped, he heaved a heavy sigh of relief.

When he heard the sounds coming from the surroundings, his face was full of fear. His mind moved slightly and his entire body felt a chill.

When did he arrive behind me?

Lin Xiao’s eyes widened as he felt the light and darkness behind him as one entity. His heart was filled with despair.

He lowered his head to look at his chest and discovered that it had been directly penetrated. A destructive attack landed on his body.

“Light and darkness are one? Is that a treasure? How can it be so terrifying!”

“Hiss, mayor Lin Xiao has been killed, oh my God!”

“Great, Haha, that Big Bastard Lin Xiao has been killed. This is great!”

“Well done by the Dragon Assassin organization. This is so cool. I will be a hardcore fan of the Dragon Assassin organization in the future!”

“They really dare to assassinate me. I Don’t care about your mayor. Awesome!”

Under everyone’s eyes, the black and white shadow killed the mayor of qiaoling town, Lin Xiao, with his own hands, which stunned everyone around him.

However, soon, some people showed wild smiles on their faces.

Lin Xiao, that bastard, was finally killed!

“Haha, you may not know this, but I also paid a portion of the spiritual stones for the crowdfunding to assassinate Lin Xiao!”

A rough middle-aged man was laughing excitedly.

But soon, his smile froze and he realized that he was getting carried away.

“Haha, Brother, you have guts. We will treat you to a meal today!”

“Awesome, brother. If I have the contact information of the dragon spike, I will also pay for it!”

“You are a man. We will treat you to a meal today!”

“Haha, come to Our Zephyr mercenary group, Bro. No one dares to mess with you in Qiao Lin Town!”

However, following that, the surrounding warriors looked at him and said loudly with respect.

This made the rough middle-aged man laugh foolishly.

“You, you actually assassinated the Mayor!”

“You are simply Lawless!”

The group of city guards saw the mayor’s body and trembled violently as they said with fear on their faces.

Ao Yao did not even look at them. With a slight movement, Lin Xiao’s body was directly put into his interspatial ring.

Immediately after, Ao Yao’s figure disappeared.

However, when he disappeared, ao Yao said, “The mayor of Bridge Forest Town is dead. There will be no order in the next few days. The dragon Spike warns everyone that order will follow in the past. If anyone is lawless, we will take the place of enforcing the law!”

The cold voice resounded in the entire sky of bridge forest town.

When everyone heard this, their eyes widened in shock.

It was especially so for those who were some distance away. They did not know that Mayor Lin Xiao was dead. Furthermore, he had been assassinated by assassins!

What made them even more shocked was that after the dragon Spike assassin organization killed the mayor, they warned everyone to behave themselves and not violate the order. Otherwise, they would take over the mayor’s law.

F * CK, did they have to be so F * cking awesome.

“The lawless one is the dragon assassin organization, and now they want to replace the law enforcement. How can it be described as a F * cking awesome one!”

“F * ck, this is too f * cking domineering. The Dragon Assassin organization assassinated the mayor without the mayor. Without the mayor in the town, it will definitely fall into chaos. At that time, the strong will rob the weak. Even before the new mayor arrives, Bridge Forest Town will be covered in rivers of blood. The dragon assassin obviously knows about this situation, so he directly replaced the law enforcement, 666!”

“To be able to cover the sky with one hand, this is the true ability to cover the sky with one hand. I can assassinate the mayor, and I can also maintain the peace and order of bridge forest town. With a flip of my hand, I can change the clouds and rain with a flip of my hand. I’m convinced!”

“Dragon Assassin Organization: I can kill people, but you can’t. I can be lawless, but you can’t!”

When the surrounding people heard this, the expressions on their faces were very interesting.

This F * ck... There was no way to describe it!

However, the things that had happened in the past two days had also given bridge forest town a better understanding of the dragon assassin organization.

The Dragon Assassin’s three-no-kill rule was very special and had a bottom line.

Later, the rule of rewarding good and punishing evil, crowdfunding assassinations, and half-price for the Great and evil made everyone feel that this was not an assassin organization.

It was more like a chivalrous hero who would draw his sword to help when he encountered injustice.

Many people were rather impressed by this assassin organization.

For an organization that focused on assassinations, this was definitely something unimaginable.

Wang Xian scanned his surroundings with a smile on his face and slowly walked towards the restaurant.

As for assassinating the mayor, although he was rather worried, he had no regrets since he had done it.

“I was prepared to let him live. You are the one who is courting death!”

Wang Xian mumbled. The amount of spirit stones needed to assassinate the mayor did not reach 50 million. It was only about 21 million middle-grade spirit stones.

However, to assassinate a mayor, an official of star-moon kingdom, and an extraordinary level eight powerhouse, it would cost at least 100 million spirit stones.

Even if he was an evil person, it would still cost 50 million middle-grade spirit stones!

The loss of more than 20 million spirit stones could be considered as Wang Xian’s own contribution.

As a mayor, Lin Xiao deserved to die!

He couldn’t be compared to Jin Qianyuan, the mayor of the Holy Sea Town.

“Complete the mission of the Lin family. However, after a few more missions, I have to leave the bridge forest town!”

“If the star Moon Kingdom sends a powerhouse over, I might be in some trouble!”

Wang Xian thought to himself. After all, Lin Xiao was assassinated when he was captured.

If he were to meet another unreasonable person, he would be in trouble!

He would be able to prepare himself by leaving two strange demons here to scout for information.

In Qiao Lin Town, everyone was discussing the assassination of mayor Lin Xiao.

Following that, they were discussing the dragon assassin organization.

The people of Qiao Lin Town never expected that it was actually an assassin organization, which made them live a much better life in the future.

The prestige of the dragon assassin organization was deeply rooted in the hearts of the people in Qiao Lin Town.

Two days passed slowly, and the dragon assassin organization completed more than 20 missions.

More than 10 of them were from the Lin family.

The assassination of the dragon assassin made everyone shocked and afraid. Everyone prayed that the assassination would not come to them.

An assassin organization that could even assassinate a mayor, who could escape their assassination?
