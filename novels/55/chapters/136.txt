Chapter 137: Descent of the King (2)

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

Within the group of 53 people, a young man was walking in the center with an elderly man following beside him.

The young man put on a smile and swept his gaze across everyone in front of him casually.

But when he saw the old man who was lying on the ground, his smile slowly disappeared.

The banquet in the training field was plunged into silence as they watched the incoming group of people.

“Who are you? How dare you make a scene in the Yan Family’s Mountain Villa!” a Martial Artist from Rivertown shouted at the top of his lungs.

He wanted to please the Yan Family!

“A bunch of small fries. How dare you even mess with the Yan Family!”

The leader of the Bi Family also did the same thing.

The ones who just arrived were Wang Xian and his Dragon Sect.

He swept his cold gaze across everyone and strolled to Old Xue.

“I didn’t think you’d dare to come. I thought you were a coward.”

When Yan Feng saw Wang Xian bring his men over, he gave a faint smile after looking at them.

Yan Feng did not take those people to heart. In fact, he felt that this was getting interesting.

“It’s only eight o’clock now. I thought I was punctual, but I didn’t expect the dinner to have been brought forward. You’re not sticking to the time!”

Wang Xian threw an impassive look at Yan Feng, the so-called Mr. Feng in school, before he came to Old Xue and squatted beside him!

“Wang Xian, you’re here. Be careful. The Yan Family... they are... just too strong!” said Old Xue with an ashen-looking face, in despair as he looked at Wang Xian.

“Don’t worry, Old Xue. Leave this to me!”

Wang Xian placed his palm on Old Xue and used his Dragon Energy to treat him.

The four limbs of Old Xue had been crippled, and his Elixir Field was destroyed. His life as a Martial Artist was completely ruined.

But to Wang Xian, this was nothing.

An immense Dragon Energy repaired all his injuries.

Old Xue recovered speedily, and his expression was slightly different when he stared blankly at Wang Xian.

Wang Xian smiled at him and lifted him up from the floor slowly.

Old Xue was injured because of him. However, he was not too late.

He could still treat the injuries, and for those who hurt his friends... he could...

“Well, well...what powerful medical skills you have. No wonder the Sacred Followers Guild was defeated by you!”

Yan Feng’s eyes brightened up when he saw Old Xue stand up suddenly. “I’ll give you a chance to atone for your mistake. Submit to the Yan Family, and I can forgive your rude and imprudent behavior. I can also let your friends off! ”

As he spoke, he was looking down his nose at Wang Xian, giving off immense confidence from within.

Yan Feng stared at him as though he was looking at his prey. As the one favored by the gods, he had never regarded Wang Xian as his match.

Wang Xian wore a smiling face and looked over. Yan Feng was overconfident such that he was arrogant.

Wang Xian ignored Yan Feng.

“Old Xue, who hurt you?”

“I sparred with a Martial Artist from the Yan Family, and I was crippled by him.”

Old Xue had a bitter look on his face. After all, it was his fault for being poor enough with his skills to get eliminated by a Martial Artist of the same level.

“Sparring?”

Wang Xian looked at the Yan Family. “Since all of you like sparring, then spar with my people. Show me what the Yan Family has got as the return of the King!”

“Haha, lad. I guess you want it the hard way. I’ve given you a chance. If you make me angry, you won’t be able to bear the consequences!”

Yan Feng looked at Wang Xian, who disregarded him with a ferocious look.

“Lad, with just these people of yours, we could destroy them without the Yan Family.”

“Old Yan, we’ll cripple these arrogant fellows on your order!”

One by one, the Martial Artists and the families sought permission from Old Yan as they raised their cold voices at Wang Xian.

Yan Gukong made a gesture, and all the Martial Artists went silent immediately. None of them dared to utter a word.

“You are the fellow who offended our distinguished guest from the Sacred Followers Guild, disregarding the Yan Family, aren’t you?!”

Yan Gukong glared at Wang Xian, questioning him.

“Your people injured my friend, right?!” Wang Xian did not answer him. He also stared at Yan Gukong and questioned him back.

“This is what happens when you go against the Yan Family!” Yan Gukong said without any emotions.

“Very well. Since you like it this way, I’ll do it your way.” Wang Xian nodded impassively. He swept his gazes around and bellowed in a cold voice, “Who was the one who injured my friend. Step out now!”

“It’s me, brat. I’ll cripple him every time after you heal him. This is the consequence of offending the Yan Family!”

The middle-aged man who fought with Old Xue spoke impassively to Wang Xian as he looked at Old Xue scornfully.

“Well then, let’s spar!”

Wang Xian beckoned, and a Dragonian walked out in wide steps.

“Level-seven Martial Artist, Mo Shisan!” The Dragonian stared at that middle-aged man.

“Haha, challenging the Yan Family? That’s interesting!”

Upon seeing Wang Xian sending his people to fight with the Yan Family, Yan Gukong laughed out. “If so, it’s only polite to accept the challenge. Let’s play with them!”

The middle-aged man let out a cold laugh. He bowed to Yan Gukong before he stared at Mo Shisan with his chin up. “I’ll destroy you!”

“Given Yan Beiyun and Old Xue’s combat skills, Yan Beiyun is at his peak as a Level-seven Martial Artist. He could be even a Level-eight Martial Artist. The art that he practiced was already formidable. Among the Martial Artists at Level Seven, and he’s almost invincible. Yet this juvenile actually challenged him. He’s obviously courting his own death.”

“Who’s that young guy who dares to provoke the Yan Family? He even shows himself at this dinner today. He’s asking for it!”

“This fellow wasn’t here just now, so he didn’t witness how formidable the Yan Family is. Now, he seems like a clown, copying the Yan Family by asking for a spar. Hehe, what a joke!”

Everyone stared at Wang Xian with disdainful looks. The less wit, the more courage. If he dared to provoke the mighty one, his outcome would be dreadful.

Wang Xian listened to the surrounding discussion. Seeing the arrogant expression on the middle-aged man’s face, Wang Xian revealed a playful look.

Boom!

Just when everyone was waiting for Mo Shisan to be abused by Yan Beiyun, Mo Shisan moved.

A faint black aura was exuded from his body as he charged rapidly at the middle-aged man like some savage beast.

“Some capability he has!”

The middle-aged man squinted his eyes. He curled his fingers into a fist tightly and darted out!

“Trash!”

Boom!

A faint voice sounded from the training ground, followed by a low groan.

The middle-aged man from the Yan Family flew out at a terrifying speed. His sunken chest could be seen in the air.

Bam!

The middle-aged man from the Yan Family landed on the table heavily and lay there without moving. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“How is this possible?!”

Everyone was taken aback. That middle-aged man was at the peak of Level Seven. But he was instantly killed by someone of the same level!

This was unbelievable!

“Brat, how dare you lie to us! Damm you!”

Seeing his clan mate being killed in a split second, Yan Zhongyuan was furious.

He would never believe that Mo Shisan was only a Level-seven Martial Artist. At his level, he could never achieve an instant kill.
