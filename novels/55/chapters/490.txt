Chapter 491: In The Name Of The Fire Goddess (1)

Yang Ze was staring blankly at the phone that was hung up while the female star was dumbfounded by the announcement on Weibo.

At this time, several other middle-aged men received various calls.

In less than ten seconds, they’d been plunged into despair.

“What kind of people did you provoke?”

Raging voices came bellowing one by one.

Back in distant China, middle-aged men and old men hung up their phones.

“Of so many people, why did they have to provoke the Dragon King of Dragon Sect? They’re obviously digging their own graves!”

“How dare a few insignificant beings provoke a powerful Sacred Sect?”

The current Dragon Sect had already ranked in the top five within the country. Such domineering force need not deal with these magnates themselves.

All they had to do was to release some news, and those magnates would be completely finished.

This was how scary their influence was and the imposing prestige they had for annihilating the Medical Saint Sect and Qiao Clan.

Messing with Dragon Sect was undoubtedly courting their own doom.

As a celebrity, the media company had announced the accidental death of Yang Ze straight away while a mourning session was held.

The cool breeze filled the night in Dubai while lights brightened the surroundings, bringing relaxing moments.

After exiting the business convention, Mu Xiaowan pulled Wang Xian and her mum to have some food outside.

“Let’s go to the supper restaurant operated by my family. You can have as much food as you want!”

Mu Xiaowan tugged Wang Xian by his arm as she spoke.

“Great, then I’ll eat to my heart’s content!”

Wang Xian chuckled.

“The business in the supper restaurant used to be good. But business declined after the Fire Spirit Volcano died down,” said Mu Xiaowan’s mum with an elated expression on her face. She looked at Wang Xian with her curiosity piqued.

It was beyond her expectations that her daughter would get to know such a big shot.

In the business convention tonight, the Prince came to her and had a cordial conversation. He even passed her several projects to handle.

All the people around her exhibited envious looks for every project she received.

All of them knew that it was because of her cute daughter, who had brought them closer to the royal family.

Their path in Dubai would have fewer obstacles in the future.

Mu Xiaowan’s mother was very grateful to this guy. Seeing her daughter bickering and chatting with him, she would want to bring both of them together, if not for the fact that he might be marrying the Princess and her daughter was underage. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“The Fire Spirit Volcano? The volcano flame will rise again, I guess. It would be nice to have dinner, and enjoy the volcano’s view from afar!”

Wang Xian chuckled as he spoke.

“It’s really awesome. A lot of couples like to have their dinner here and take photos!”

“Oh, Uncle. Later I’ll get my mum to take a few pictures for us!”

As the lass spoke, they took a car towards the Fire Spirit Volcano.

The restaurant was situated at the beach where the trio sat down and chatted.

With the girl livening up the atmosphere, the three of them enjoyed a laid back time.

After their dinner, the lass dragged her mother to the beach to take pictures for them.

“This posture, and this pose. Come on. One, two, three!”

The lass was screaming with excitement on the beach.

Even though it was already 10 pm, there were many people there. Among which, most of them were Martial Artists.

A lot of Martial Artists had not given up on the Fire God’s Graveyard. On the contrary, many Martial Artists rushed over after hearing the news.

But out of the eight denominations, five of them had already given up.

The remaining three denominations were waiting for their chances.

“Deity Lady, the entrance of the Fire God’s Graveyard is guarded by the Fire Demons, and they are the mighty Dan Realm Fire Demons!”

“There should be one Budding Realm Fire Demon which hasn’t struck yet. But it felt suffocating just looking at it from afar.”

When Wang Xian and the lass were taking pictures, they heard a voice.

Approximately fifty people were walking towards them from the front.

The outfits of these fifty people were even more unusual than the natives.

In the center was a lady who was holding a creepy skull, burning in black flames, in her hand.

Black runes were painted all over her face and parts of the body, which was revealed. Her profile, along with her outlook, looked malevolent under the dim lights.

“We suffered quite a huge loss this time. If we don’t get anything in return, it’s totally unacceptable for Nether Flame. This time, we will overturn the entire Fire God’s Graveyard to dig out the treasures in it!” said the lady in a hoarse voice. There was fiery heat coming out from her mouth every time she spoke.

“I heard that the Budding Realm experts from Fire God Denomination and Heavenly Flame Denomination are here too!” another old man by the side exclaimed without any expression.

“Lord Nether Spirit, only three denominations are left. They are not giving up on the Fire God’s Graveyard that easily. Even Budding Realm Experts have arrived today!” a voice continued to reply.

“It’s normal for the rest of the denominations to retreat. Fire God’s Graveyard was simply too dangerous for them. Even if they retrieve the weapons made by Fire God or some treasures, it’s of no use to them. Only the denominations of the fire lineage will fight for it at all costs.”

Another old man who was standing beside the lady looked even more daunting as compared to the lady and Nether Spirit.

His entire body was black. But it was not the tone of a black man, but rather, a carbon black.

It was as though the entire body of the old man had been charred by fire, striking chills to one’s spine.

“Uncle, that bunch of people are strange!”

Upon seeing the group of people walking towards her, Mu Xiaowan freaked out and hid behind Wang Xian.

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows as he watched the crowd.

The lady and the other two old men at the forefront were not any ordinary people, as they posed a slight danger to him.

Mu Xiaowan’s mother walked over immediately as she held Xiao Wan in her arms while pulling Wang Xian to one side. With astonishment, she watched the bunch of queer people.

“Are they filming a movie?” asked Mu Xiaowan in a whisper.

“Not much fuel is left in the Nether Skull, and we still have a battle later on!” the lady, holding the creepy skull in both hands, murmured softly.

As she carried the skull, the skull suddenly rotated by itself as it aimed at a spot on the right.

Over there sat a quartet of young men who were watching them with curiosity and discussing among themselves in whispers.

When they saw the skull aiming at them, they were horrified as they tried to flee.

Two balls of black flames suddenly darted out from the socket of the skull and hit the four young men.

Without any screams or shrieks, the quartet vanished into thin air.

The black Nether Flame brought the red-colored liquid back to the skull while the black skull exuded a devilish vibe.

Subsequently, the skull turned, aiming at Wang Xian and the rest.

After witnessing what had happened just now, Mu Xiaowan and her mother revealed petrified looks on their faces.

There was a change in Wang Xian’s expression too. He swung his arms over to shield them as they flitted away.

The black Nether Flame gave chase. With an arm swing, Wang Xian blocked it off with an immense flame.

“Hur?”

Seeing that the black Nether Flame was being countered, a strange look flickered in that lady’s eyes.
