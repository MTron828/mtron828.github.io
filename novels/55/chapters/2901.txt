Chapter 2902

The eight desolate six directions had always been considered an ancient race battlefield.

There were secret realms, divine artifacts, bones, inheritances, medicinal gardens, and so on.

Some people guessed that the other side of the eight desolate six directions was the center of the universe.

There were also experts who wanted to bypass the eight desolate six directions and enter the other side of the eight desolate six directions.

However, after flying for a few years, they realized that they had lost themselves in the vast starry sky.

In the starry sky, without a star map, many people would easily lose themselves.

The universe was so big that no one dared to fly at will.

“Desolate divine emperor, you said that you have seen the person across from you in the depths of the eight desolations and six directions?”

The emperor Lord looked at the desolate divine emperor with a face full of shock and asked him.

“The other party’s strength is very strong, giving me a deep and unfathomable feeling. He only took a glance at me, yet it caused my soul to tremble.”

“At that time, there was still an array barrier between us. I dare to confirm that it was the expert from the center of the opposite universe.”

“The other party seems to be very disdainful of our direction.”

The desolate god Emperor’s gaze flickered as he said.

With just a glance, the desolate god Emperor’s soul trembled. What kind of existence was this?

Everyone’s faces were filled with shock.

“Right now, we only have two paths. We can either stay here forever, or we can go to the other side and look for experts to help us.”

The Emperor Lord said with a gloomy face.

“Look for experts to help us? How is this possible!”

An eight desolation God Emperor said directly.

“It’s not impossible.”

The Emperor said faintly.

…

“This place in the eight barrens is also a treasure land. It’s much better than the imperial court’s Wizard Association.”

In the grotto-heaven blessed land in the eight barrens, Wang Xian had finished building the Dragon Palace. Some members of the Dragon Palace had teleported over.

Looking at the entire lair of the eight barrens, their faces were filled with astonishment.

“Little Xian, in the future, we will have the Imperial Star Field, the Heaven Wizard Field, and the eight barrens and six directions. The area of our territory can be said to be the largest in the resplendent starry sky!”

The group of girls flew in the sky and looked at the fairyland-like world. Their faces were filled with excitement.

The Dragon Palace’s territory was the largest in the entire resplendent starry sky with the two large territories and the eight desolations six directions.

Moreover, there were already people in the communication network of the eight desolations six directions saying that the Dragon Palace’s strength was the strongest in the entire resplendent starry sky.

There weren’t many people who refuted this.

Just the Dragon King with nine divine dragons was able to make all the celestial emperors in the eight barrens escape with their experts. Liuli was unable to achieve such power and intimidation.

In addition, the Dragon Palace had the legendary divine dragons. Currently, the Dragon Palace was known as the strongest force in the starry sky.

Wang Xian wasn’t too concerned about the ranking of the forces in the starry sky.

After a month, all the planets in the eight barrens had been taken over by the Dragon Palace.

This increased the daily income of the Dragon Palace by a lot.

In the following period of time, other than the Saint Lord of the Holy Region who came to visit, nothing major happened.

No Force dared to provoke the Dragon Palace, which had shaken the entire area.

The Dragon Palace entered a state of peace.

The members of the Dragon Palace also entered a rare period of leisure time. They walked out of the Dragon Palace and started to wander around the Imperial Star Field, the Heaven Wizard region, and the bhang six directions.

Later on, Prime Minister GUI organized some experts of the Dragon Palace to enter the bhang six directions to see if they could obtain some treasures.

As the days calmed down, Wang Xian was also very free.

He accompanied a group of girls to wander around.

“Dragon King, there’s a war in the glazed area.”

Eight months later, Prime Minister GUI reported a piece of news to Wang Xian.

Currently, the Dragon Palace had some spies in all the major starfields. They were mainly used to investigate some important matters.

When Wang Xian heard that there was a war in the glazed area, he was slightly taken aback.

“What’s going on? Why is there a war in such a big area like glazed area?”

Wang Xian looked at Prime Minister Gui in astonishment.

Glazed tile was the largest region. Glazed tile was once the largest force in the region. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

According to what he knew, glazed tile’s rules were very fair. Why would there be a war?

“Dragon King, it’s the problem of their two neighboring regions, Chimei territory and machine royal territory.”

Prime Minister Gui handed over two documents as he spoke.

One was from machine royal territory and the other was from Chimei territory.

“Those who are not of my race must have different intentions!”

Looking at the two documents, Wang Xian mumbled.

In the machine royal territory, the rulers of the chimei territory were not humans. One was a robot while the other was a desolate beast.

“Does the Dragon King of the chimei territory feel a little familiar? We used to call the creatures of the chimei territory demons and monsters.”

“According to the information we received, the demons and monsters of the Chimei territory live in the demon lair. They have a special ability to summon expeditions.”

“Through a special contract, they can summon their demon den over and use it for themselves. However, the demon den will infect the intelligence of other creatures and turn them into demons.”

“Once they become demons, they will become a part of the demons and be assimilated. They will invade a starry sky and strengthen themselves.”

“This time, I heard that the demons of the chimei domain have returned. They want to invade the glazed domain.”

Prime Minister Gui said from the side.

“So the demonic nest came from the chimei territory in the starry sky.”

Wang Xian read the information about the chimei territory and listened to Prime Minister Gui’s words.

“When the mechanical imperial territory saw the demonic nest attacking the glazed area, they also organized a mechanical army to attack the glazed area.”

“If the robots want to develop, they need a huge amount of resources. Now that the mechanical imperial territory has been fully exploited by them, they have to go to a new starry sky territory if they want to improve.”

“Secondly, in the glazed domain, there is a kind of glazed double-colored stone that contains the energy of the Earth and gold laws. This kind of glazed double-colored stone is very useful to the robots. They can use it to create an army of Earth and gold robots. They are extremely powerful.”

“Currently, the two major domains are constantly in conflict with the glazed domain. It seems that there are even battles at the level of the Divine Emperor.”

Prime Minister Gui continued to report to Wang Xian.

Be it the robots or Yao Xie, they were enemies with the humans.

However, their strength was also extremely terrifying. If the other party didn’t provoke the humans, the humans wouldn’t provoke them either.

In the past, the strength of the robots was ranked second in the resplendent starry sky, second only to glazed.

As for Yao Xie from the chimei domain, there had never been a large-scale battle in the past. No one knew how strong they were exactly.

This time around, there were more than ten celestial thearchs from Yaoxie’s side during the war in the glazed domain.

“Since the glazed domain is getting stronger and stronger under the threat of these two major domains, its strength should not be underestimated. Let’s continue to pay attention to it.”

Wang Xian nodded and said to Prime Minister Gui.

The glazed domain was relatively far away from the celestial wizard domain of the Emperor Star Domain. They were adjacent to the east of the Holy Domain.

He did not take the war there to heart.

The war would not reach their side.

Even if they reached their side, Wang Xian was not very worried.
