3551 3550 combined forces?

“Hello, Dragon King of the Dragon Palace!”

The 13 ancestral dragons looked at Wang Xian and greeted him once again!

“Dragon King, I heard from the two little guys, Green Dragon Beard Shadow and Green Dragon Moon, that if we combine forces, do you have the confidence to fight against the Holy Dragon Lineage?”

The Golden Dragon among them looked at Wang Xian and asked!

“That’s right. With everyone in the Dragon Palace, I have the confidence!”

Wang Xian looked at the Golden Dragon and nodded. He continued, “Dragon Kings of the ancestral dragon lineage, can you tell me how many level three universe masters and masters the Holy Dragon lineage has?”

“The number of level three universe masters and Masters of the Holy Dragon lineage should be at 19. The ancestral dragon lineage currently has 13. We can’t contact two of them. One of them was killed by the son of the Holy Dragon not long ago!”

A Devil Dragon in the center answered, “Besides that, the Holy Dragon Emperor of the Holy Dragon bloodline can’t be measured by the level 3 universe masters. According to a message from our leader, Holy Dragon Emperor has four or five connate true treasures. Most of them were given to him by the Angel Race!”

“In addition, there’s another piece of bad news. Our leader has two weapons that are at the level of innate supreme treasures. The Holy Dragon King should have obtained them as well!”

The berserk dragon replied!

“HMM? So many innate supreme treasures?”

Wang Xian was slightly stunned when he heard their news!

Damn it, there were six to seven innate supreme treasures?

The terror of innate supreme treasures was still fresh in Wang Xian’s memory!

This thing was full of strangeness!

Currently, there was only one innate supreme treasure in the entire Dragon Palace, and it was in the hands of the sky array!

That Devil’s corpse, the source of the curse, was extremely strange!

Now, the Holy Dragon King actually had so many of them?

This made him frown slightly, and a hint of solemnity appeared on his face!

“There are indeed quite a number of them. Currently, I don’t know if they have been taken away by the angel race. If they haven’t taken them away, the Holy Dragon King’s strength is very terrifying. However, it will be very difficult for a level three universe master to control three to four innate supreme treasures!”

The Green Dragon said!

“Dragon King, are you confident?”

The Golden Dragon emphasized again!

“Yes!”

Wang Xian nodded slightly. Although the Holy Dragon lineage had more innate true treasures, he still had this confidence!

After all, there were thirteen level three universe Dominators in the Dragon Palace.

There were also himself, the water touch king, and the Heaven Array, which were not ordinary powerhouses!

Wang Xian was still confident in his ability to fight against the Holy Dragon King.

“HMM?”

The eyes of the dragon kings from the ancestral dragon lineage flickered slightly!

“In addition, there’s a blessed land under the river of Eternity in our Dragon Palace. That blessed land can withstand the attacks of the real masters of the Universe!”

Wang Xian added on.

“Oh? It’s rare to see a blessed land that can withstand the attacks of a real master.”

The Fire Dragon King was slightly taken aback. Everyone looked at each other and said, “However, one of our ancestral dragon leader’s innate treasures can greatly weaken the power of the array formation in the grotto-heaven blessed land. Therefore…”

As the Fire Dragon King spoke, his expression turned ugly!

When Wang Xian heard their words, he was slightly speechless!

This could be done?

“I’m not worried about the Holy Dragon lineage. I’m worried about the other subsidiary races of the Angel Race. Will they help the Holy Dragon Lineage?”

Wang Xian spoke up!

The Dragon Kings of the ancestral dragon lineage were a little silent because they knew about such matters.

Wang Xian looked at them. From the looks of it, he couldn’t count on them too much!

“How about this, everyone? I think we can gather together and come to my Dragon Palace!”

He said directly, “Anyway, you guys don’t have any good ideas. If you are found one by one, you won’t be able to resist at all. If we gather together, we can still resist!”

“Gathering together will affect the life and death of our entire ancestral dragon lineage. Let’s think about it!”

The group of experts from the ancestral dragon lineage looked at each other. They couldn’t be sure immediately!

“Alright. If all of you are willing to join forces, let me know!”

Wang Xian nodded and left the chat!

“Is this Dragon King Trustworthy?”

Seeing Wang Xian’s figure disappear, the Water Dragon King looked at the Golden Dragon and asked.

“There shouldn’t be any problem. Their Dragon Palace killed a few divine light dragons and destroyed the alliance of the hundred cities. They shouldn’t have joined forces with the Holy Dragon Lineage!”

The Golden Dragon replied.

“I don’t think so. I’ve done some research on this dragon palace. They have always been on our side!”

The Wind God Dragon said!

“Should we gather together?”

The Lightning Dragon looked at them and asked again!

The experts of the ancestral dragon bloodline frowned slightly!

This was a decision that concerned the life and death of the entire ancestral dragon bloodline. They didn’t dare to make a blind decision!

If they made a wrong decision, they would have to pay the price of the entire ancestral dragon bloodline!

Now that the leader of the ancestral dragon lineage had died, they had lost their backbone!

No one wanted to be the sinner of the entire ancestral dragon lineage!

Wang Xian exited the chat space of the peak experts of the ancestral dragon lineage and shook his head slightly.

The death of the leader of the ancestral dragon lineage had indeed dealt a huge blow to them!

Furthermore, they had not gathered together for a long time, and none of them could take charge of the overall situation!

Although every peak expert of the ancestral dragon lineage could take charge of the overall situation, they did not dare to make a rash decision on such a matter!

Wang Xian did not say anything. This was up to them to decide!

He needed to be a strong and trustworthy ally!

Moreover, even if they did not have an ally like the ancestral dragon lineage, it did not matter to the Dragon Palace!

If War really broke out, the Dragon Palace wouldn’t be afraid!

“Prime Minister Gui, keep an eye on the various movements of the Holy Dragon lineage. If there are still peak experts of the ancestral dragon lineage who are killed, the experts of the ancestral dragon lineage might not be able to sit still!”

Wang Xian ordered Prime Minister Gui!

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Prime Minister Gui nodded.

“There’s a city ahead. Teleport through the city directly!”

Time passed day by day, and the Sacred Dragon’s group quickly headed towards the Dragon Palace.

They looked at the information on the universe AI and flew towards the city ahead.

With the Sacred Dragon’s group as the leader, the Sacred Dragon’s group headed straight towards the city.

Their bodies emitted a terrifying aura.

When they arrived above the city, the warriors within the city finally reacted.

“Welcome, My Lords of the Holy Dragon Lineage!”

They saw a group of human-shaped holy dragon sons with dragon horns on their heads and bowed respectfully!

“We want to use the teleportation array!”

An elder of the Holy Dragon lineage said faintly.

“My Lords, please use it!” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

The experts in this city didn’t dare to have any opinions and immediately brought them to the teleportation array respectfully!
