More than 100,000 people were kneeling by the sea.

In the sky, the western gods were kneeling.

Ten terrifying powerhouses were kneeling!

At this moment, the Dragon King could be crowned as king.

In the distance, some people who were not qualified to enter were watching from afar.

When they heard the voices, they were all shocked.

The western gods were kneeling down, while the eastern immortal sect was kneeling down.

The King of the world! The Dragon King!

“Disperse!”

Wang Xian swept his gaze across everyone around him. He waved his hand and flew directly toward the Dragon Palace.

The members of the Dragon Palace, Guan Shuqing, Lan Qingyue, and the rest followed closely behind.

The ten people from the supernatural realm did not have any thoughts as they followed behind and headed toward the Dragon Palace.

“The Dragon King has left!”

“He has left. Phew, I really didn’t expect this. I really didn’t expect this!”

“With the Dragon King’s strength, he alone can destroy the entire world. He is willing to submit!”

“The Dragon King is merciful. He doesn’t have the intention of the twelve experts to establish a dynasty. However, after Earth, the Dragon King will be respected!”

The gods and disciples from the western and eastern immortal sects slowly stood up. They looked at each other and said in a low voice.

From today onwards, the Dragon King was worthy of being the king.

The immortal sects quickly announced this news.

The Dragon King would be their king in the future.

Once this news was released, it shocked the entire world. However, no one dared to say anything against the Dragon King.

Even on the Internet, no one dared to say anything bad about the Dragon King.

Because all the immortal gods of the immortal sects had given the order that the Dragon King was the King of Earth. Anyone who dared to offend the Dragon King would be executed!

Even if it was just a slight offense, they would still be executed.

The Dragon King’s strength made all the immortal sects afraid. If someone really offended the dragon king, then their entire force would be finished.

Among the immortal sects, the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect was probably the happiest.

This was because the son of the sect leader of the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect was the boyfriend of the Dragon King’s sister. It wouldn’t be long before they got married.

This made the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect even more powerful. Even the Xuan Yuan clan would pay a visit and befriend them.

The current Yellow Heaven Immortal sect could be said to be a royal relative!

The entire Yellow Heaven Immortal sect was filled with joy.

However, at this moment, in the Dragon Palace, Wang Xian was standing in the Dragon King’s Hall. He slowly opened his eyes and swept his gaze across the ten people below.

At this moment, the ten people had already swallowed the Divine Dragon’s blood essence and were subdued into dragonmen.

The ten people stood there respectfully.

“Phew, the extraordinary continent is really a bizarre world!”

Wang Xian opened his eyes. After absorbing a person’s soul, he digested a little bit of information. He had a rough understanding of the supernatural continent.

There were powerful dragons there.

However, this dragon was different from Wang Xian’s figure. To be more precise, the dragons in that world were more like a giant lizard.

It was not a divine dragon with pure bloodline. Wang Xian estimated that it should be a creature with the bloodline of a divine dragon.

In the ocean, there were many powerful creatures that spoke human language. However, the most powerful ones were still the dragon race.

The dragon race was the master of the ocean in the supernatural continent.

The sea area of the supernatural continent was also extremely vast. It was seventy to eighty times the size of Earth.

The entire supernatural continent was about a hundred times the size of Earth.

That world was truly vast. There were many experts, and the extraordinary experts could only be said to have transcended mortals and become cultivators there.

Although it couldn’t be said that the extraordinary were trash, those below the fifth level of the extraordinary couldn’t be called experts.

Only those above the fifth level could be called experts.

And the ones who truly controlled a city and suppressed an area were the insightful emptiness realm experts.

The people from the Holy Glory mercenary group were just a small force in the supernatural continent.

“After settling the matters on earth, we will head to the supernatural realm. It will be much more convenient with them leading the way!”

Wang Xian subdued them in order to make preparations for entering the supernatural continent.

It would be much more convenient with a few people from the supernatural continent leading the way. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

To enter the extraordinary world, he first needed to improve his strength. Then, he needed to find a sea area to serve as the base of the Dragon Palace and transfer it over.

This way, he would be able to slowly develop and stand at the peak of the extraordinary world.

However, before entering the extraordinary world, Wang Xian had to make all the necessary preparations.

Firstly, he had to hide the passageway leading to the extraordinary world well. If a terrifying existence were to descend on Earth one day, Earth would be finished.

Secondly, he had to organize his sister’s wedding.

He also had to formulate some plans on how to quickly increase his strength and become a powerhouse after entering the extraordinary mainland.

Before he became stronger, he didn’t dare to rashly let Guan Shuqing and the rest enter.

Apart from that, he wanted to see if he could find Feng Luan.

The former empress.

Wang Xian smiled when he thought of Feng Luan. He didn’t know what the Empress was doing now.

Feng Luan was resurrected using dragon blood and endless wood. She could be considered half a member of the Dragon Palace.

He could sense that Feng Luan was still alive.

“How can I quickly increase my cultivation level after entering the extraordinary mainland?”

It took too long to digest the memories in his mind. Wang Xian asked them directly.

“Dragon King, there are two ways to increase your strength. There are elixirs and cultivation holy land. If you want to buy elixirs, you can buy them with spirit stones. We don’t have many spirit stones on us. We can do missions by earning spirit stones. There is an extraordinary mercenary association on the extraordinary mainland. We can accept missions from there. We are a mercenary group and have always been earning money through missions!”

“As for the Holy Land of cultivation, it is usually controlled by the dynasty, sects, academies, and powerful families. The effects of each holy land of cultivation are different, but compared to the outside world, it is definitely dozens or even hundreds of times better. Some Holy Land of cultivation specifically targets the only attribute, allowing one to comprehend supernatural powers inside and achieve a breakthrough!”

The ten of them said respectfully.

“Are elixirs and weapons scarce?”

Wang Xian thought as the corners of his mouth curled up slightly. Refining elixirs and weapons was the fastest way to earn spirit stones.

He could definitely earn a large amount of spirit stones through refining elixirs and weapons and accumulate a large amount of resources.

This was the strongest trump card and the most confident place he had when he stepped into the extraordinary continent.

“Weapons and elixirs?”

The Shady Youth in the middle was slightly stunned, and then he nodded. “Weapons and pills have always been essential items for cultivators.”

“However, in the past, the holy item forging workshop and the life and Death Pill Workshop occupied the pill and weapon market in many parts of the continent. In the past year, a Phoenix Immortal Pill and weapon workshop suddenly appeared!”

“Once this shop opened, it quickly swept across the entire continent and occupied the market of many important cities, competing with the holy item forging workshop and the life and Death Pill Workshop. At present, pill refining and weapon refining basically all went to the Phoenix Immortal Pill and Weapon Workshop!”

“The other small-scale shops have been completely destroyed!”

The shady-looking young man said while deep in thought.

“What? Fengxian pill and Weapon Workshop?”

Wang Xian was slightly stunned. Soon after, a look of astonishment appeared on his face.

Fengxian?

Fengluan?

Wang Xian?
