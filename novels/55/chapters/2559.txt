“Dragon King, the million soldiers of the tiger chaotic demon country have all arrived. 200 undyings, I’ll listen to your orders today!”

On a planet in the middle of the Dragon Star, the million soldiers and 200 undyings of the tiger chaotic demon country had arrived under the lead of the old country advisor!

Seeing the Dragon Palace warriors rushing over from the Dragon Star Ocean, his eyes gleamed with shock as he spoke!

“There are so many warriors from the Dragon Palace!” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

The 200 undyings of the tiger chaotic demon country looked to the side, their eyes filled with shock!

The strongest side of the Dragon Palace were the leaders and undyings of the Dragon Palace. With a glance, there were about 500 of them!

And these were only from the Dragon Palace!

There were only about 300 undyings in the entire tiger chaotic demon country!

From this, it could be seen that the dragon palace was much stronger than their tiger chaotic demon country!

The old National Advisor had also realized that the overall strength of the Dragon Palace was much stronger than theirs. This made him glad that he had a good relationship with the Dragon Palace back then!

“Alright, let’s set off immediately. After destroying Xing Hua planet today, I will destroy the three seas gate!”

Wang Xian said indifferently!

“Dragon King, you guys will be in charge today. We will be in charge of attacking!”

The old National Master said with a Smile!

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian shouted softly and everyone immediately flew towards Xing Hua Planet!

Boom! Boom! Boom

As soon as he said that, the million strong army of the Tiger Chaos Demon Kingdom and the 200,000 members of the Dragon Palace immediately flew towards the void in front of them!

On the left and right sides, the immortal god King and all the god Lord powerhouses increased their speed!

With their speed, they could reach Xing hua planet in 10 hours!

Within the Dragon Star, even though some people noticed movement, they didn’t pay too much attention to it!

“We’re almost there!”

After close to 10 hours, an incredibly prosperous planet appeared in their sight!

“Everyone get ready!”

Prime Minister Gui stared ahead and said indifferently!

“Clang! Clang! Clang!”

In the next moment, all the members took out their weapons one by one!

“Beep! Beep! Beep! Beep! Beep!”

At the same time, inside Xing Hua Planet!

Xing hua planet was a bit depressed today, but in comparison, it was also bustling and bustling!

Suddenly, an extremely urgent sound rang out!

The sound covered the entire planet directly, making everyone’s faces alarmed!

“What’s the situation?”

“This is an alarm bell, this is an alarm bell that will only sound when we encounter a huge threat!”

The deafening voice caused everyone on Xing Hua planet to have extremely grave expressions, and some experts immediately flew towards the sky!

“Not good, there’s a terrifying energy in the starry sky flying towards our direction. All disciples, make preparations immediately!”

“A powerful army is rushing towards our Xing Hua Planet. All disciples of the three major forces, make preparations!”

Urgent voices sounded from the battleship in the void crevice above Xing Hua Planet!

The experts of the three major forces who had been watching over Xing hua planet immediately sent an urgent notice!

“All Disciples of Xing Hua Planet, get ready!”

“All Disciples of Xing Hua Planet, get ready!”

In the next moment, another voice covered the entire planet Xing Hua!

Inside planet Xing Hua, the disciples and experts of the three major forces were greatly shocked!

“Fly into the void immediately!”

All the disciples and experts immediately flew into the void!

The experts from other places of the three major forces immediately teleported to planet Xing Hua!

As the three major forces that controlled the commercial planet, they each had three extremely powerful legions guarding this place!

Furthermore, it was an urgent notice that the experts from the three major forces were rushing over here one by one!

Three minutes. In just three minutes, there was an army of a few million people standing in the sky above Xing Hua Planet!

Among them, the leaders of the three major forces were at the forefront!

The leader of the Three Seas Gate, the president of the Jian Hua Group, and the chairman of the Black Forest Group!

The three great warriors had gathered around the top warriors of the three forces!

The undying god King warriors had gathered over 600 in a short period of time!

...

“Reporting to sect leader, according to our Xing Hua planet’s heavenly eye surveillance, a terrifying power has arrived here within three minutes!”

An old man flew over with a solemn expression and reported loudly!

The leaders of the three factions stared at the spot in front of them with a solemn expression. Their expressions were ugly!

“Have we detected any factions? Are they humans or large numbers of desolate beasts?”

The Black Forest Group’s chairman asked with a gloomy expression!

“Reporting to chairman, we have not detected anything for the time being. This subordinate has already sent people to investigate!”

The elder immediately replied!

“Damn it, in that direction?”

The three seas sect’s sect master looked forward, and his expression changed drastically!

That direction was in the direction of the Dragon Star!

However, the Dragon Star was currently flourishing, so they shouldn’t be coming over!

...

However, if it wasn’t them, who else could it be?

“All soldiers, get ready. Regardless of who or what the other party is, it would be fine if they were just passing by. However, if they are threatening our xing hua planet, kill them all!”

The Chairman of the Jianhua Group roared with a grim face!

“Yes!”

All the disciples of the three forces roared with cold faces!

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

Soon, they saw more than a million people flying in the sky!

At the front, two huge flags were fluttering in the air!

One was the image of a divine tiger, and the other was a divine dragon!

“It’s the tiger-infested demon kingdom, the tiger-infested demon kingdom, and the other could be the Dragon Palace!”

At this moment, an expert could not help but Roar!

Boom! Boom! Boom

“Dragon King, we have entered the enemy’s range!”

Prime Minister GUI stared ahead and whispered!

“Old National Advisor, give the order immediately. Tell everyone on Xing Hua Planet to scram. In five minutes, we will destroy the Planet!”

Wang Xian looked at the old national advisor beside him and said calmly!

“Alright!”

The old national advisor nodded his head. His face was filled with a sinister expression!

“Everyone on Xing Hua Planet, listen up. In five minutes, my tiger turmoil Demon Nation and Dragon Palace will destroy Xing Hua Planet. You have five minutes to escape immediately. Otherwise, you will have to bear the consequences!”

A violent and domineering roar resounded across the starry sky. A terrifying wind and waves surged forward with the naked eye!

The Roar turned into a hurricane and swept toward planet Xing Hua!

The warning came before the arrival of the person!

At that moment, everyone on planet Xing Hua, whose faces were already filled with bewilderment, raised their heads and looked into the void!

When a voice was heard, everyone was shocked!

“What? The Tiger Demon Empire and the Dragon Palace are attacking!”

“They... They are going to destroy planet Xing Hua. This... this...”

“They are going to destroy the stars in five minutes. Are they going to start a war with the three major forces on planet Xing Hua?”

The people on planet Xing Hua were overwhelmed with shock!

“What!”

In the Void, the three major forces’expressions changed drastically when they heard the old National Advisor’s Roar. In an instant, an extremely violent murderous aura surged out of their bodies!

“The Tiger Riot Demon Nation and the Dragon Palace, are you sure you want to be enemies with our Jianhua Group, the Black Forest Group, and the Three Seas Gate?”

Angry roars came out of their mouths!
