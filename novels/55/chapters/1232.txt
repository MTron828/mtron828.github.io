Chapter 1233: 1234’s strength had increased by leaps and bounds

Translator: 5496903

“Did you guys hear? Yesterday, he killed the nine Star Dynasty’s void interpretation expert and the youth who killed all the subordinates of the eighth Prince of the Dragon Dynasty. He actually killed a half-step void interpretation demonic beast cub in his grocery store!”

“What’s a half-step Void Interpretation Demonic Beast Cub? There’s a half-step void interpretation demonic beast bloodline in there!”

“Are there complete sets of transcendent level 9 and half-step void interpretation weapons and armor boots? But there are complete sets! There are more than ten sets!”

“How is that a grocery store? It’s practically a treasure trove. It’s practically a treasure trove. I heard that there are even void interpretation level items for sale on the second floor!”

“This is crazy. Today, I saw several major powers and diamond mercenary group leaders walking towards that store!”

“I heard that the young owner of that shop is also very powerful. He defeated Yin Xianfeng and even killed the sword sect’s heavenly sword star. He can be ranked on the prodigy roll now!”

The entire graveyard of demi-humans became lively. The reason was not that Wang Xian killed an expert at the Seethrough level, nor was it because he killed the eighth Prince’s subordinate.

The death of an expert at the SEETHROUGH level would not cause a commotion in the graveyard of demi-humans.

The reason for the commotion was because of the dragon-phoenix grocery store.

It was a store with the bloodline of a half-step void interpretation realm vicious beast, Demon Beast Cubs, complete sets of weapons, pet eggs, and array formations.

When he entered the dragon-phoenix grocery store yesterday with curiosity, he walked out with his eyes wide open and his face filled with shock.

Those precious items were items that many people would risk their lives for.

Even if blood dynasty held an auction once a month, many items could be used as the finale treasures.

Now, all of them were sold in this grocery store.

This instantly caused a lot of people to boil. At night, thousands of people entered the store with curiosity.

When they entered and saw the items, their eyes widened in shock.

In the next few days, more and more people went to the dragon and Phoenix grocery store.

A small grocery store was filled with people all day long.

In less than five days, there were only a few items left in the dragon and Phoenix grocery store. Only some weapons on the second floor were not sold.

The rest of the items were almost all sold out.

As there were two ferocious beasts at the first level of the profound void stage guarding the store, coupled with the fact that long Xiaotian had been staying in the store for the past few days, many people who harbored ill intentions dispelled their thoughts.

The fragrance of wine was not afraid of the depth of the alleyway!

Even though Wang Xian had expected that his grocery store would be very popular, he was still surprised that he was able to sell the items one by one so quickly.

After all, some items were worth 40 to 50 billion middle-grade spirit stones.

“It’s much faster than I expected. Long Xiaotian said to give the last few weapons of the Seethrough realm to him!”

Six days later, Wang Xian stood in the shop and smiled when he saw that there were not many items left in the entire grocery store.

The tomb of the demi-human was the center of the entire Liuhai region and the place with the most number of experts. The items that were worth 700 to 800 billion middle-grade spirit stones did not cause much of a stir.

There were simply too many wealthy families, kingdoms, and sects.

Wang Xian didn’t even have the slightest doubt that even if he had ten times more treasures, he would be able to sell all of them within one to two months.

“When I came out, I would never have thought that I would be able to raise my level again in less than two months!”

Wang Xian revealed a faint smile as he looked at the spiritual liquid in the porcelain bottle in his hand. A glint flashed across his eyes.

His body shook as he took out a formation to conceal his aura and placed it around him. Then, he took a deep breath.

Wang Xian opened the porcelain bottle and swallowed all the spiritual liquid in it into his stomach.

Under the transformation of the system, the spiritual liquid transformed into pure dragon energy and entered all four limbs of his body.

“Ding! Congratulations to host for upgrading to extraordinary level nine!”

“Ding! Congratulations to host for comprehending the three elemental abilities of metal, water, and wood: Metal Spirit Tree Demon!” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Ding! Congratulations to quality for comprehending the water, fire, and metal elemental ability: metal and fire cleansing!”

“Ding! Congratulations to quality for comprehending the four elemental abilities of Earth, water, wood, and Fire: Earth’s death!”

At this moment, the system’s voice rang out one after another. It caused Wang Xian’s arm to stiffen slightly as his eyes flashed with excitement.

Excitement did not come from the increase in level, but from the system’s divine ability.

Three divine abilities, just like the last time he upgraded. However, each of these three divine abilities was more terrifying than the last.

Three attribute divine abilities, four attribute divine abilities.

Wang Xian’s eyes were filled with excitement.

“My level has increased once again. The comprehension of supernatural powers is the real perverse part, Haha!”

Wang Xian couldn’t help but laugh out loud in excitement. Gold Spirit Tree Demon, gold fire cleansing, Earth’s death. These three supernatural powers had basically raised his strength to another level on the basis of the increase in his level.

As a level eight transcendent, he was able to kill a level one void interpretation when he was in his human form after mastering the combination of three attributes.

Now that he was a level nine transcendent, how strong would he be after mastering the three and four attributes?

Wang Xian was confident that he could crush a level two void interpretation when he was in his human form. He could fight against a level three void interpretation, but he should not be a match for him.

Under the divine dragon form, he could easily kill a level three void interpretation and escape when he faced a level four void interpretation.

This was not just an increase in his strength, but a huge increase in his strength!

A person at level nine of the supernatural realm was able to crush a person at level two of the Seethrough realm. Who would believe it?

No one dared to believe it.

Even Wang Xian himself in the past was not 100% sure that he could kill him.

However, the fusion of the attributes allowed him to fight against a person at a higher level than him on the basis of the Divine Dragon’s body.

The fusion of the four attributes and the divine dragon’s inheritance allowed him to kill a person at level three of the Seethrough realm at level nine of the supernatural realm.

“I understand now. All along, my cultivation has entered a misconception. It’s a deformity. I have relied too much on the divine dragon’s inheritance and not on myself!”

Wang Xian looked at the Golden Spirit Tree Demon and the golden fire cleansing. He had some thoughts.

When humans cultivate, they would cultivate their combat skills before they reached the insightful emptiness realm. They would convert their combat skills into divine abilities.

It was the same for transcendents. They would upgrade the battle techniques they cultivated to divine abilities so that they could make breakthroughs.

As for himself, he had never cultivated battle techniques. He had relied on the system to randomly obtain divine abilities.
