Chapter 1424: The 1,424 demoness graveyard incident

“Nameless chosen one! A supreme chosen one! With a flick of his finger, even the supreme elders of the blood stream sect had to go all out to deal with him. Just how strong is Lord Wang? !”

“Did you guys notice just now that Meng Wenbing’s chosen one was ranked seventh? His eyes were filled with worship as he looked at Lord Wang. He was almost going to kneel down!”

“Our Lord Wang is a Peerless Heaven’s favorite who can suppress the same generation. Not to mention the same generation, even the older generation can’t compare to our Lord Wang!”

“The champion prize of this Heaven’s favorite competition is the demon-free sword that Lord Wang once used. It would be great if I could get it!”

In the arena, the hundreds of thousands of spectators watched Wang Xian and their Queen’s departing figure as they spoke with faces full of shock.

What happened today was shocking to all of them.

The mysterious Lord Wang of their dynasty was actually the Supreme Heaven’s favorite on the Heaven’s favorite list in the tomb of the transvestite.

He even swept through everyone in the blood stream sect in a domineering manner.

Even the supreme elder of the blood stream sect bowed and submitted.

He was even more domineering when he said that whoever was the heaven’s favorite would be the Heaven’s favorite!

Such a monstrous appearance was imprinted in everyone’s mind.

The strength of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire had also exceeded everyone’s expectations.

...

“I didn’t expect you to make such a big name in the year that you left!”

In the mayor’s residence, Feng Luan looked at Wang Xian with a smile and said.

“Haha, it’s fine, it’s fine!”

Wang Xian smiled smugly.

“Your strength has broken through again?”

Feng Luan looked at him and thought of how she almost caught the grand elder of the blood stream sect with a flick of her finger. She asked with a twinkle in her eyes.

“I’m stronger than you!”

The corner of Wang Xian’s mouth curled up slightly.

“Look at you, you’re still acting arrogant. Lord Supreme Heaven’s pride, have you been fooling around in the tomb of the demi-human?”

Guan Shuqing and the other girls stared at him and asked with unfriendly gazes.

“No, how is that possible!”

Wang Xian shook his head immediately.

“Sister Fengying, you met him in the cemetery. You tell him!”

The girls obviously didn’t believe that a young man who was known as the Almighty Almighty wouldn’t be fooling around?

“There was a girl who was on good terms with him and even confessed to him!”

As Zhang Fengying spoke, Wang Xian instantly felt waves of murderous gazes.

“I’m so outstanding. It’s normal for someone to pursue me. I didn’t agree to it. If you don’t believe me, you can ask Fengying if I didn’t agree to it!”

Wang Xian was extremely eager to survive as he spoke hurriedly.

“HMPH!”

However, the few girls clearly didn’t believe in his character.

This was especially so for Sun Lingxiu, a Jiaya, and Tang Yinxuan. Speaking of which, the three of them were met by Wang Xian when he was away from home.

And that was how it ended...

The last time he left for more than a year, it was hard to say if he brought Zhang Fengying along with him.

“Your Majesty, Lord Wang, the five people from the blood stream sect are here to pay a visit!”

At this moment, it was fortunate that the city lord of Flaming Sun City walked in and changed the topic.

“Blood Stream sect? Let them come over!” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Feng Luan nodded her head with a slightly cold expression and spoke to flaming sun city.

“It’s Her Majesty the Queen!”

Flaming Sun City Lord nodded. Soon, the blood stream sect’s grand elder and the other five people walked in.

“Dragon Phoenix Queen, Lord Wang, sorry to disturb you!”

The five people led by the white-haired old man walked in and cupped their hands at them!

“Everyone from the Blood Stream sect, isn’t it a bit too much to snatch people from our Dragon Phoenix Dynasty’s competition grounds?”

Feng Luan sat in the middle and looked at the white-haired elder as she questioned him faintly.

“Dragon and Phoenix Queen, it’s our blood stream sect’s fault for being reckless this time. We have offended you!”

The white-haired elder bowed and looked at Wang Xian and Feng Luan as he apologized.

He lowered his stance very much.

He was filled with shock towards Wang Xian’s strength and the Dragon and Phoenix Empire.

The current situation of the demi-human cemetery was uncertain. If they were to offend the dragon-phoenix Empire, which possessed the combat strength of level six of the void interpretation stage, it would definitely be extremely bad news for their blood stream sect.

“Oh? Your Blood Stream sect is also a great sect. If you want to recruit disciples, you wouldn’t need the grand supreme elder to come and snatch them personally, right?”

Wang Xian looked at the white-haired old man’s sincere look and asked curiously.

The white-haired old man’s strength was considered top-notch even in the graveyard of demi-humans. The reason why he could only receive three moves with a flick of his finger was because he had just broken through and his arm had been modified.

After breaking through to the second level of the Void Interpretation Realm and comprehending the Dragon Kingdom in the aspect palm, his arm had received a huge improvement.

This was why he was able to make the white-haired old man fight with all his might with a single finger.

However, what made him curious was that such a powerful sect’s supreme elder, the strongest expert, actually came here to snatch people.

“The general trend is changing, and our blood stream sect has no choice but to make preparations in advance!”

The white-haired old man smiled bitterly and said with a somewhat solemn expression.

“The general trend is changing?”

Feng Luan revealed a surprised expression and gestured for them to sit down.

“The demonic beast race in the human-demon graveyard has undergone a huge change. There are demonic beast races that want to establish an empire!”

The white-haired elder said with a sullen face.

“Establish an empire?”

Feng Luan was slightly taken aback. “Once the demonic beasts unite and develop, their strength won’t be weaker than humans, or even stronger!”

“The Ten Thousand Demon Empire is a good example. Tens of millions of demonic beasts, when they fight, they can destroy cities and overturn seas!”

“It will be fine if they stabilize and grow up. It will be better if they are on good terms with humans. However, if they are evil to humans, it will be a bloodbath. It will be even bloodier than the current human-demon graveyard!”

The white-haired elder nodded slowly. A worried look appeared on his face. “Most importantly, the blood barbaric demonic beasts are the strongest now!”

“Blood Barbaric Demon Beasts?”

Wang Xian and Feng Luan frowned slightly.

The blood barbaric demon beasts had always fed on the fresh blood of humans and beasts. They were bloodthirsty as if their lives depended on it. If they were to unify the demon beasts in the human-demon graveyard, it would definitely not be good news for humans!

“What are the reactions of the few big countries in the human-demon Graveyard Now?”

Feng Luan asked with a frown.

“There’s no action yet. The blood flow empire is preparing to gather the strength of all the dynasties in the flowing sea region. We can’t let them establish an empire!”

The white-haired elder said.

Feng Luan slowly nodded, her eyes flickering.

“Dragon and Phoenix Queen, if the Demon Beast clan really establishes an empire, it will have a greater impact on the various dynasties. Naturally, it will also have a great impact on our sect. Why Don’t we form an alliance?”

The white-haired old man looked at her and said with a smile.

“An alliance? Of course, there’s no problem with that. As for how to form an alliance, we still need to discuss!”

Feng Luan nodded.

“Young master Wang Xian, is your strength now...”

The white-haired old man nodded with a smile on his face. He looked at Wang Xian and said. Before he could finish his sentence, he continued, “Young master Wang Xian, it would be even better if you can contact the Light Dragon Empire and Sky Sword sect!”

“Light Dragon Dynasty? Sky Sword Sect?”

Feng Luan looked at Wang Xian in confusion.

“Hehe, the Crown Prince of the Light Dragon Dynasty was supported by young master Wang. The only beloved daughter of the sect leader of Sky Sword sect has a close relationship with young master Wang. If we can pull these two forces together, the strength of our alliance will not be weaker than the blood flow empire!”

The white-haired old man said with a smile on his face.

However, very soon, he realized that the atmosphere around him had changed.

Wang Xian’s face turned black as he glared at the white-haired old man.

Damn it!
