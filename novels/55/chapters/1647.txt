Chapter 1648: 1548 what Heaven’s Pride? A dragon among men? Go

“Walk, Walk, walk out of the city. Yesterday, we killed more than ten members of the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan. Haha, This Is Awesome!”

“I heard that the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan has a helper, a member of the Sacred Fire clan. We have to be careful in the near future!”

“We have already received news that the Patriarch of the Sacred Fire clan did not come. The strongest one is at level nine of the profound void tier. However, experts at level nine of the profound void tier have experts from the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop to deal with them!”

“The peerless prodigy of the holy item forging workshop. Jiang Xinghuo, who is a dragon among men, heard that he has already killed more than two hundred members of the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan. He even killed more than ten void interpretation stage experts. He is simply too strong!”

“Shui Lianyi and Shui Lianhun from the life and Death Pill Workshop, the Twin Pearls, killed the prodigy of the fire cloud sparrow clan, Huo Mingyu, yesterday. He is one of the most outstanding prodigies of the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan in the current generation!”

As soon as he stepped into the city, voices of discussion could be heard. Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and scanned his surroundings.

All of them were young, middle-aged, and old men who were filled with killing intent.

Most of them had bloodthirsty excitement in their eyes.

The war between the life and Death Elixir Workshop and the Fire Cloud Sparrow tribe had thoroughly angered the two major factions.

They did not hesitate to pay a huge sum of money to issue missions. This had caused many people who loved to fight to rush over and join in the war to participate in the hunting of the fire lark tribe members.

Wang Xian looked over and a cold expression appeared in his eyes. A strange ray of light shot out from his eyes.

The Dragon Eyes of the yin-yang and five elements were opened instantly.

He scanned his surroundings and could sense the strength of the people around him.

In a city with a population of over ten million, the weakest among them was at least at transcendent level seven and above, and those at the profound void tier could be seen everywhere.

His gaze swept over the buildings on both sides, one on the left and one on the right. Both rows were filled with shops of the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop.

Each of these two shops was thousands of meters long.

High-level medicinal pills could be seen everywhere in the shops. If they were placed in the flowing sea area, it would make everyone go crazy.

War was what the life and Death Pill Workshop and the biological pill workshop wanted to see the most.

The reason why they dared to pay such a high price to hire various mercenary groups and assassins was because they needed elixirs and weapons for mercenary groups to fight.

If they bought elixirs and weapons from the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop, the income of the two forces would also increase.

In this way, they did not have to pay too much of a price.

“Every shop has a level five insightful void martial artist guarding it!”

“There are also level seven and eight insightful void martial artists among them!”

Wang Xian swept his gaze across the area and continued walking forward.

“HMM? There are level nine insightful void martial artists there, and there’s more than one of them!”

“That should be the center. There are five experts who are half a step away from longevity!”

“This entire city is terrifyingly powerful. If it wasn’t for the fire lark tribe holding them back, the Dragon Phoenix Empire would have been destroyed long ago!”

Wang Xian quickly walked to the center of the city. He was slightly shocked as he checked the strength of the entire city.

Once his identity was exposed, he would definitely not be able to walk out of this city.

Although there were no longevity experts around, there were at least five people who were half a step away from longevity.

“If I plunder the elixirs here and escape immediately...”

The corner of Wang Xian’s mouth curled up slightly.

As long as there were no longevity realm experts around, everything would be fine.

The current him could teleport twice without a break. One time would be 20 kilometers, and two times would be 40 kilometers.

If he escaped 40 kilometers, even a half-step longevity realm expert wouldn’t be able to catch him!

This was especially so since all the elixir stores were located near the city gates.

Wang Xian returned to the original route and arrived at the top floor of a restaurant near the city gates.

His gaze swept across the area below.

“There are a total of 50 elixir stores. Some are big and some are small. There is only one place with an expert at level eight of the Seethrough realm guarding it. There are 50 at level five of the Seethrough realm and two at level seven of the Seethrough Realm!”

“With 500 strange demons attacking at the same time, they can take away all the elixirs from the 50 elixir stores in an instant!”

“Then, they will fly over and enter the storage spiritual bag. They will leave in an instant.”

Wang Xian sipped his tea gently. He sat there quietly and watched as he pondered in his heart.

“It’s only a distance of 2,000 meters. There is absolutely no chance of failure!”

Wang Xian thought to himself.

“Hahaha, young master Jiang Xinghuo, please come in, please come in!”

“Young Master Jiang is simply too strong. He fought against more than a dozen experts of the fire Lark clan alone. Impressive, impressive!”

At this moment, more than a dozen young men walked over from the stairway. They were laughing and conversing with each other.

“Eh? Jiang Xinghuo, the peerless prodigy of the holy item forging workshop, the dragon among men, Jiang Xinghuo. Now, he has the strength of a fifth level void interpretation. He has shone brilliantly in this war!”

“Is He Jiang Xinghuo? I heard that he is an outstanding disciple of the current generation of the Jiang clan of the Holy Item Forging Workshop!”

In the restaurant, some people also looked over with curious faces.

“Haha, it’s the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan’s trash that is too weak. If it wasn’t for their fire cloud sparrow experts coming over, I would have been able to kill them all!”

The corners of Jiang Xinghuo’s mouth curled up slightly as he sat on the table with a face full of confidence.

“That’s not right. Young Master Jiang, your strength is too strong. In this war, Young Master Jiang, you have the demeanor of a great general. May I ask how many contemporary disciples have the demeanor of a great general like you?”

A few young men at the side fawned over him.

“Haha, serve the wine and dishes!”

His figure was tall and sturdy, the young man holding a heavy hammer in his hand waved his hand arrogantly. “Now that I’ve killed Nineteen Fire Cloud Sparrow Cave Void realm experts, I’m still lacking one more to be able to give a follow-up evaluation of Jiang Xingkong. I want to earn the title of the strongest heaven’s favorite in the Jiang family’s current generation!”

“Haha, that’s right, that’s right. The disciple who performed the best in this war will be able to obtain a huge reward. I think this reward belongs to young master Jiang Xinghuo!”

Voices of unbridled conversation rang out.

Some of the people around didn’t dare to say anything.

Jiang Xinghuo was the current Heaven’s favorite of the Jiang family in the holy item forging workshop. He was the disciple of the dragon among men.

A fifth level insightful emptiness realm expert. Each title could suppress many people.

Wang Xian swept his gaze across the group of people who were chatting freely and smiled faintly.

“Let’s move out!”

He looked out of the window and had a thought. In the storage spirit bag in his hand, illusory shadows flew directly towards the Elixir store below.

Five Hundred Strange Demons were moving out at the same time.

The weakest among them could assassinate an expert at level six of the Seethrough realm. There were a total of five hundred of them. This force was extremely terrifying even in this war.

A group of strange demons flew over at an extremely fast speed. Out of the 50 elixir stores, one out of ten strange demons entered. Five of them attempted to assassinate and the other five took all the elixirs away.

How Long would this take?

Just a few seconds!

At this moment, Wang Xian stood up slowly and walked towards the table of Jiang Xinghuo and the rest in the middle.

He was holding a wine cup in his hand with a smile on his face.

“I have long heard of young master Jiang’s great name. Let Me Toast You!”

Wang Xian walked over and raised his wine cup towards them.

“HMM?”

Jiang Xinghuo looked over and raised his eyebrows slightly.

“Who are you? What right do you have to Toast Young Master Jiang?” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

The group of young men on the table stared at Wang Xian and said in disdain.

“Hualala!”

However, the moment they finished speaking, they saw the young man in front of them pouring his wine onto the ground.

Everyone was stunned!
