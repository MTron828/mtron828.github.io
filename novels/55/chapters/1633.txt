Chapter 1634: Under the invincible stance of 1634

“All the powerhouses in the vast region, take this!”

The huge dragon’s voice spread across a radius of 100 kilometers.

With a body of nearly 10 kilometers, dazzling dragon scales under the sunlight, and gigantic dragon claws, it directly crushed the powerhouses in the vast region.

The war had only started for less than 10 minutes.

Just now, Wang Xian’s attack had killed seven to eight Seethrough Void Tier 8 experts and 7 to 8,000 other experts.

This caused the vast area to be at a complete disadvantage.

Now, Wang Xian once again relied on his powerful physical body to charge towards the remaining 110,000 troops.

“This... how the F * CK is he going to receive the attack? Where’s the patriarch? Block the Sky Demon. Otherwise, how are we going to fight!”

An expert at level seven of the Seethrough realm looked at the terrifying body within a ten-kilometer radius. He was so afraid that tears almost flowed down his face.

Receive this attack?

We are more than one meter in size. How can we receive an attack from a ten-thousand-meter-long creature?

Who can receive it!

Boom! Boom! Boom

However, even if they couldn’t receive it, they had to receive it. Wang Xian waved his dragon claws and swept them with his powerful physical body.

The air exploded as the dragon claws swept past. All the experts at the Seethrough realm and those at the half-step to the Seethrough realm were like ants in his eyes.

Under his terrifying strength, all the figures were sent flying and their bodies were completely deflated.

No one could withstand a single strike from Wang Xian.

Even the experts at the eighth level of the Seethrough level were sent flying for thousands of meters by the terrifying dragon claws. They were only left with half their lives.

The sounds of miserable shrieks could be heard continuously in an instant.

The army that was left with only 110,000 soldiers was defeated immediately.

“Oh my God, the Dragon King is too violent. He is a godly beast that descended from the sky. He is so powerful!”

“Haha, there are so many experts in the Dragon Palace. There are more than 10,000 insightful emptiness realm experts. This is too awesome!”

“Invincible, the Dragon King is invincible. He can fight against three people at the same time. He is so powerful!”

“The Dragon King is invincible, the Dragon Palace is invincible, and the experts in the high and mighty area are going to be defeated by us!”

“With the Dragon Palace and the Dragon King here, who dares to mess with the Dragon and Phoenix Empire?”

Behind them, tens of millions of people in the dragon and Phoenix Imperial City stared at the war with wide eyes.

The powerhouses in the high and mighty area had arrived, and their momentum alone was enough to defeat them.

However, the powerhouses in the high and mighty area were being slaughtered.

The battle in the sky was like a fight between immortals.

Especially the invincible posture of the Dragon King, it was deeply imprinted in everyone’s mind.

“Our Phoenix Emperor is also very strong. With the Phoenix Emperor and the Dragon King in the future, our dragon-phoenix dynasty might be able to establish a foundation for ten thousand years!”

“The relationship between the Phoenix Emperor and the Dragon King is so good, and it’s a man and a woman. Do you think that in the future...”

The balance of the war had been broken, and all the citizens of the dragon-phoenix imperial city heaved a heavy sigh of relief.

They were talking excitedly and excitedly. In fact, they were even discussing the private affairs between the Dragon King and the Empress.

“Stop the Sky Demon. We can’t let him continue killing. All the disciples in the vast area, run, run!”

Patriarch Dark Eye was suppressing the divine dark dragon in front of him.

However, he could not kill him quickly.

Seeing Wang Xian wreaking havoc on the battlefield, the vast area was completely defeated. His pitch-black pupils were bloodshot as he roared loudly.

“Run, Run Now!”

“This is too terrifying. Run, return to the vast area!”

Upon hearing Patriarch Dark Eye’s order, the experts from the vast area who were defeated by Wang Xian on the battlefield below did not hesitate at all. They immediately fled in the direction of the vast area.

“Let’s block the sky demon and the other two experts!”

Patriarch dark eye forcefully blocked the attack in front of him and attacked Wang Xian’s dragon body.

“All the disciples of the Dragon Palace, chase after them!”

“All the soldiers of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire, chase after them!”

Wang Xian ordered loudly while Feng Luan shouted as well.

The experts from the vast region had already charged into the flowing sea region. How could they let them escape with peace of mind.

“Kill!”

“Kill!”

All the members and experts of the Dragon Palace chased after the army from the vast region with excited faces.

All the experts in the vast area who thought that they were gods had never thought that they would be so miserable.

The appearance of the Dragon King and the experts of the Dragon Palace made them all feel terrified.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

The experts in the vast area fled, causing the heavenly eye arrow division to completely let go.

Each of their members rode on the Phoenix Dragon Seed and shot life-chasing arrows at the half-step void interpretation experts of the extraordinary ninth rank.

There was nothing they could do. The void interpretation experts were the fastest to escape, so they could only leave the weaker ones behind.

After rounds of attacks, the corpses fell down like raindrops.

Just a few rounds of attacks from the Heavenly Eye Arrow Division had killed more than 10,000 people.

“Why is it like this? !”

“Ahhhh, don’t kill me!”

The weaker ones looked at the experts of the Dragon Palace and the soldiers of the dragon-phoenix Empire with despair on their faces.

They gritted their teeth and tried their best to escape.

“Is there any use in escaping? We will reach the vast area!”

The two patriarchs from the Wuji Empire, the two patriarchs from the southern Royal Family, and the Supreme Sect Master were fighting against Wang Xian, Xiao Lan, and Feng Luan with all their might.

Looking at the army that was fleeing in the vast area, Wang Xian revealed a mocking expression.

“Sky Demon, it’s impossible for you to destroy us!”

Upon hearing Wang Xian’s words, Patriarch Dark Eye’s expression changed drastically.

The Sky Demon was actually going to attack their vast area.

To the three superpowers, this was a great humiliation.

“Even if we can’t destroy them, we can still cause the three superpowers to suffer heavy losses!”

Wang Xian revealed a cold smile.

Wang Xian, Xiao Lan, and Feng Luan could completely suppress the five strongest experts in the vast region.

However, it was a little difficult to kill them.

Just like when he was in the solitaire sect, after he consumed the violent blood pill, he could only use the method of mutual destruction if he wanted to kill Patriarch Fengchi.

With Wang Xian’s current strength, he could fight against four people at the ninth level of the Seethrough void tier.

Three of them were not his match.

As for one or two of them, he could kill them quickly with his full strength.

However, it was extremely difficult to kill the five of them.

If they were not careful, Xiao Lan and Feng Luan would be injured by both of them.

Boom! Boom! Boom

In the sky, their fight continued.

Even if the five top-notch experts in the vast region were injured, they could only hold on.

Because once they escaped, their vast region’s 120,000 strong army would all remain here.

If that was the case, the entire vast region would be completely crippled.

“Run!”

Ten minutes later, the five experts of the vast region gritted their teeth and directly fled towards the vast region with blackened faces. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Little Xian, should we let little lan chase after them?”

Seeing the five experts from the vast area fleeing, Feng Luan raised her eyebrows and asked.

“Chase them to the north stream sea. After that, we will gather our army and go to the vast area to have a good talk with them!”

Wang Xian stared at the five disappearing figures and said coldly.
