Chapter 792: The Battle of 0793 had begun

Translator: 549690339

The opening of the Dragon Gate forging workshop was a grand event for the entire jianghu.

At around nine o’clock, thousands of disciples of the immortal sects gathered around each shop.

Only in the real city next to the Xia Ding area, there were not many martial artists who came to buy.

The staff and members of the Dragon Gate were not too surprised by this situation. After all, there was hatred between the two sides, so it was impossible for them to come over to support the opening.

However, they also believed that it would not be long before the disciples of the two great immortal sects came.

Because the items in the shop and the price of refining weapons and pills were enough to tempt them.

At half past nine, the doors of all the shops were opened.

The moment the doors of the Dragon Gate forging workshop beside Xia Ding were opened, a special atmosphere condensed in the air.

The bustling street instantly became cold and quiet. One after another, ordinary people hurriedly left into the distance.

The expressions of the four Dragon Gate members standing on the second floor slightly changed, and they immediately stood up to look around, revealing embarrassed expressions.

“Not good!”

The expressions of the four people suddenly changed, and they directly broke out of the window and fled into the distance.

“Boom Boom Boom!”

Right at this moment, a terrifying attack directly covered over, and a thick pillar of fire directly blasted towards the Dragon Gate forging workshop.

There wasn’t the slightest bit of mercy, and there wasn’t the slightest bit of leniency.

Directly, over ten infant stage experts exploded out with terrifying attacks.

In an instant, the entire Dragon Gate forging workshop had turned into ruins, and even the traces had been completely wiped away.

No one would have thought that the flourishing Dragon Gate forging workshop that was just a moment ago would disappear in the next moment. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“The people of the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect, they want to completely start a war with us!”

The four Drakonids had a shocked expression on their faces.

They had directly dispatched dozens of top-tier experts to destroy their Dragon Gate Shop. This meant that the Holy Medicine Immortal sect was going to become their enemy!

They were going to start a war!

No, it was possible that the Holy Medicine Immortal sect was going to make a move to intimidate the Dragon Gate.

However...

The four Drakonids’eyes revealed a cold light. They looked at the infant realm and half-step immortal god experts who were surrounding them and roared, “Kill!”

They knew that they couldn’t escape this time, so they could only kill!

The four Drakonids didn’t fear death at all and directly attacked an infant realm expert.

“Haha, Dragon Gate, Today, my Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect will let you know the consequences of offending us. Today, I will make you have no place in the jianghu anymore!”

The experts of the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect shouted with excitement on their faces.

The four DRAKONIDS looked at each other and roared, “Die!”

“Stop them. Today, all of you will die here, Haha!”

The expert of the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect laughed loudly. When an infant stage expert saw that the DRAKONIDS wanted to break through from his side, his face revealed a trace of ridicule.

He waved his arm, and a terrifying pillar of fire directly shot out, blocking in front of him.

If they wanted to pierce through this pillar of fire, even an infant realm expert would be injured. Once they were injured, they would be dead for sure!

His eyes revealed an excited expression as he muttered, “A small dragon gate actually dares to embarrass our Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect. I wonder if you guys will be able to withstand our revenge!”

“HMM? What?”

Suddenly, the smile on his face froze.

The four Drakonids didn’t slow down and charged into the pillar of fire without any hesitation.

However, what shocked him even more was that these four Drakonids didn’t flee to the side. Instead, they stared at him with bloodthirsty eyes.

“Not good, they aren’t trying to flee. They are trying to kill me!”

The middle-aged man’s eyes revealed a terrified expression as he hurriedly fled to the side.

This time, their Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect dispatched over 20 infant realm experts and a half-step immortal god. Although there were many of them, they were all in an encirclement manner.

Each person was about 500 meters apart.

However, at this distance, only the two experts beside him could save him!

“Save me!”

He roared loudly, but he felt the terrifying demonic dragon claw clawing towards his body.

His face was filled with terror as he raised the scepter in his hand, forming a flame defense.

“Boom Boom Boom!”

However, the four Devil Dragon Claws directly pierced through the flame defense, tearing his body apart.

“Ah!”

A miserable scream rang out, causing the expressions of the surrounding experts from the Saint Medicine sect to change drastically.

Despite being besieged by so many people, one of them was actually killed. This caused their expressions to be somewhat unsightly.

“Kill!”

The four DRAKONIDS didn’t hesitate at all. They knew that they wouldn’t be able to escape this time. If they could kill one, then they would fight to the death.

Death, the drakonids weren’t afraid at all.

“Kill them all for me!”

Seeing that the four Drakonids didn’t show any signs of escaping at all and were fighting to the death instead, the experts of the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect were shocked and shouted loudly.

“Kill, Kill, Kill!”

Although the strength of the four drakonids far exceeded that of ordinary infant realm experts, they could only fight one of the twenty or so experts of the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect.

The gap was too big. Even though they were all equipped with grade-12 spiritual weapons, they were still killed one minute later.

The four Drakonids died, and the Dragon Gate forging workshop was directly turned into ruins.

Along with them were more than ten ordinary employees.

While the Dragon Gate forging workshop on Xia Ding’s side was being attacked by the experts from the Holy Doctor and Holy Medicine Immortal Sect, the other Dragon Gate forging workshops were also attacked at the same time.

There were a total of eight dragon gate forging workshops. One of them in Jiang City had Wang Xian and the others guarding it while the other seven were all attacked.

The Holy Doctor and Holy Medicine Immortal sect sent out more than 40 infant realm experts to attack the three Dragon Gate Forges.

In addition, a group of infant realm and even half-step immortal God realm assassins from the Sly Thorn clan directly charged into the Dragon Gate forges.

The moment the shop opened, it shocked all the disciples of the immortal sect who were waiting at the entrance.

“Haha, Dragon Gate, today is the end for provoking our holy doctor and Holy Medicine Immortal Sect!”

In front of a Dragon Gate forging workshop, a terrifying force directly caused the forging workshop to collapse. More than ten infant stage powerhouses floated in the air and stared at the four drakonids with cold faces.

“Dragon Gate!”A cold voice resounded throughout half of the city. They wanted to let everyone know that this was the fate of the Dragon Gate.

In front of another Dragon Gate forging workshop, seven to eight black shadows rushed into the shop, directly killing all the staff members, snatching all the medicinal pills, and completely destroying the forging workshop.

Apart from Jiang City, the other forging workshops were all attacked horribly.

In every place, there were at least seven or eight infant realm experts, and even more than ten infant realm experts.

The four Dragonmen guarding the workshop didn’t have the time to resist at all, and the Dragon Gate forging workshop was instantly destroyed.

This caused the eyes of the Dragonmen guarding the workshop to be filled with killing intent.

The battle instantly erupted. As long as it was a dragonman who hadn’t died once, they would directly fight it out with them.

Life and death, a real war, is about to start!
