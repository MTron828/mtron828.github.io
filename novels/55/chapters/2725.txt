2726 2726 was caught like a turtle in a jar

“Boom!”

The magnificent fireworks slowly condensed into a human figure covered in flames. Its face couldn’t be seen clearly, but one could feel its terrifying power.

The figure covered in flames slowly stretched out a palm. The palm turned into a claw and attacked Northern Frost.

Everything happened in an instant.

“What a terrifying flame!”

“Not good, someone is attacking!”

Imperial star Lady bei Shuang and the others were shocked when they sensed this terrifying flame.

Executive Ying, who was in the lead, immediately turned his head. When he saw the figure that was attacking them, his pupils constricted slightly.

“Not good!”

His heart trembled.

“His target is the frost goddess.”

However in the next moment, he felt the flame man’s target, his expression changed as he roared loudly.

“Howl, die.”

From within the flame man, an enraged howl resounded.

“What!”

In front, bei Shuang saw a flame man suddenly appear and attack her, her expression shocked.

She realized that she couldn’t dodge the attack at all, she didn’t even have time to return to her undying country.

“I’m going to die just like that?”

Bei Shuang suddenly became extremely calm, standing there dumbly.

She could imagine that in the next moment, she would be killed.

And the surrounding people had only just reacted.

Rumble

At this time, two terrifying energies attacked the flame man.

“Who!”

The flame man saw that his attack was about to land on the disciple of the Dragon King, however he suddenly felt this terrifying attack, his expression changed.

If he was hit by these two attacks, he would be heavily injured.

This made him roar with killing intent.

“Trying to kill our disciple, are you courting death?”

A cold voice resounded.

Weng

As the voice faded, an energy engulfed the entire area.

A strange black hole appeared in space.

“Dragon Palace!”

The flame man saw the changes around him, his eyes wide open, filled with shock.

There was a pinnacle god King of the Dragon Palace protecting his disciple?

How was that possible, a pinnacle god King protecting an undying level 8?

Hua La La

At this time, blood red chains wrapped around bei Shuang and the rest, protecting them!

Howl

The next moment, a huge ocean pacifying needle smashed towards the flame being. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Boom! Boom!”

Following that, a gigantic world end ruler appeared. On it stood eight-headed man and Company.

Terrifying attacks were released from the world end ruler as it similarly attacked the blazing man.

The Heaven Array stood on the world end ruler as well. With a wave of his arm, an embryonic formation slowly appeared.

“Dragon Palace, you know of our actions?”

At that moment, Blazing Man’s world end patriarch saw that the Dragon Palace’s peak godly monarch experts were present. He widened his eyes and roared furiously.

At the same time, he was shocked.

This was obviously a trap.

How did the Dragon Palace know that he was going to kill bei Shuang?

Seeing at least three pinnacle undying god King warriors of the Dragon Palace, his expression was extremely ugly.

He had fallen into a trap.

“Your operation? Who Are You, how Dare You Kill Our Dragon King’s Disciple?”

Ao Qitian stared at world elder and said coldly.

...

“Jie Jie Jie, if we didn’t find something nearby, our miss bei Shuang would have been killed by you. An Undying Pinnacle Emperor assassinating an undying level 8, how shameless is that?”

On the ruler, Ba Qi asked the same question.

They were talking to the Empress and warriors on purpose.

“You guys are nearby? By chance?”

World margin heard their words and didn’t believe it.

How could it be so coincidental?

How could it be so coincidental?

“This... There’s actually someone who wants to assassinate the Frost Goddess, and an undying Pinnacle Warrior!”

“Who is this warrior? Why would he want to assassinate bei Shuang?”

“Hiss, luckily a warrior from the Dragon Palace suddenly appeared. Look, did the Dragon Palace Use Three Pinnacle Undying Warriors? How terrifying, and the surrounding arrays, how strange.”

The group of emperors protected by the chains saw this scene and discussed in shock.

...

A pinnacle undying warrior actually tried to assassinate the Frost Goddess.

“Who is he, to actually dare to assassinate his own kind at this time, our imperial court has given an order, no one is allowed to kill anyone. Otherwise, the moment he is discovered, he will be killed, not even a pinnacle undying emperor, he is provoking our imperial court.”

Beside bei Shuang, an emperor from the same team stared coldly at the flame man in the sky.

The rules of the imperial court were not to be broken even by peak undying God kings.

“Leave him behind, water array, floating flood!”

At this time, the sound of the sky array came from the side, a terrifying flood rushed towards horizon elder.

“Damn it!”

When he saw this terrifying attack, his expression changed.

At this time, he knew that he couldn’t hide anymore. The moment he did, he would be left behind.

“Buzz!”

He waved his arm and a fire pagoda appeared in his hand. On the Fire Pagoda, a flood of flames met the flood!

“It’s you, the Patriarch of the World Margin Sect!”

“So it’s you, the Patriarch of the world margin sect. No wonder you wanted to assassinate the disciple of our Dragon King. It’s you.”

“However, the imperial court has decreed that humans are not allowed to fight. You, the world margin sect, have disregarded the rules of the imperial court and are courting death!”

When Ba Qi released the pagoda, the corners of his mouth curled up as he immediately roared.

“Forefather Tian Ya, I didn’t expect it to be the forefather of Tian Ya. He actually came to assassinate miss bei Shuang in such a despicable manner!”

“This is too shameless. The world margin sect is no match for the Dragon Palace. Now, he’s actually thinking of assassinating the Frost Goddess!”

“Most importantly, the world margin sect actually dares to violate the rules of our imperial court. Are they courting death?”

As expected, when Ba Qi’s voice rang out, the experts of the imperial court roared furiously.

Especially since they were in the same team as the northern Frost Celestial Maiden and the others, they could be said to be on the same team.

“Dragon Palace, you have killed so many members of our world margin sect. Our world margin sect swears that we will make you pay a heavy price. Just you wait, just you wait.”

Patriarch World Margin roared mournfully when he heard Ba Qi’s words.

He had actually failed in this operation. Most importantly, their world margin sect had broken the rules of the imperial court.

This made his heart burn with anger.

“Make our Dragon Palace pay the price. You must pay the price for attacking our Dragon King’s Disciple!”

Ao Qitian and the others roared and directly attacked patriarch world margin.
