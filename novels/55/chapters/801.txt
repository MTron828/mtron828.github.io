“The Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect and the treacherous Spike clan have thoroughly angered the Dragon King. Now, the disciples of the two immortal sects don’t dare to leave the city gates. The treacherous Spike clan was almost completely exterminated. The treacherous Spike clan’s immortal God announced that the mountain would be sealed for ten years!”

“Just how many immortal gods does the Dragon King have under his command? How many infant stage subordinates does he have? A hundred? A hundred and fifty? Or even more!”

“It’s very difficult for a single dragon gate to suppress the three great immortal sects, even for the Xuanyuan clan and the Yuwen clan!” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

On the Jianghu website, the battle between the Dragon Gate and the three great immortal sects had exceeded the expectations of all the disciples of the immortal sects. In particular, the strength that the Dragon Gate had displayed had shocked everyone even more.

At the moment, the disciples of the two great immortal sects did not dare to leave the city. Even if there were matters that needed to be dealt with, the immortal gods would personally lead a team to prevent the Dragon Gate powerhouses from attacking.

This made the disciples of the two immortal sects extremely aggrieved.

“We clearly have the strength to destroy the Dragon Gate, but because of the restrictions of the immortal God agreement, we are simply too aggrieved. If the immortal God can make a move, we will definitely teach the Dragon Gate a lesson!”

“That’s right, the damn immortal God Agreement has forced us into a corner. We, the Immortal God, disregard the agreement and still want to destroy the Dragon Gate!”

The disciples of the two great immortal sects were venting their anger on the pugilistic world.

However, many of the other disciples of the immortal sects were replying with a hint of mockery.

“Even without the immortal sect agreement, the Immortal Gods of your two great immortal sects might not necessarily be a match for the Dragon Gate. They have nearly ten immortal gods, and at least two gods. What about you? Only three gods. There’s not much of a suppression!”

“Right now, the disciples of the two immortal sects can only brag on the pugilistic world’s Internet. They don’t even dare to go out!”

The winner takes all. There was no shortage of people on the internet who would beat up a drowning dog.

When the disciples of the two immortal sects saw their replies, they almost vomited blood. Even the faces of the infant stage experts of the immortal sects turned black.

Time passed slowly, and half a month passed very quickly.

“Let’s give it a try. We can’t keep closing the city gate and see if there are any experts of the dragon gate guarding outside!”

“How great would it be if the immortals and gods could make a move!”

In the early morning, several elders of the Holy Medicine Immortal sect said to the ten or so young disciples in front of them.

The eyes of the ten or so elders were filled with fear. They gulped and said, “It’s the Elders!”

The elders were all white-haired. They were disciples of the immortal sect and did not have many years of lifespan.

Now, they could only send them out to see if the experts of the Dragon Gate were still lying in ambush.

Originally, the immortal God could scan the surroundings to see if there were any experts of the Dragon Gate lying in ambush.

However, the appearance of the strange demon race made the immortal God feel helpless. It was very difficult for the immortal God to find the members of the dragon gate who had terrifying concealment techniques.

Therefore, they could only use people to go out and investigate. This was also the most helpless choice of the two immortal sects.

“Let’s Go!”

More than ten elders walked out. They looked at their surroundings with fear and trepidation as they walked forward.

“WHOOSH WHOOSH WHOOSH!”

At this moment, figures flew over one by one. Terrifying sword rays directly slashed towards them.

“Boom!”

However, before the Golden Swordfish’s attack could reach them, a terrifying flame appeared in front of the dozen or so elders, forming a huge flaming hand.

The huge flaming hand wrapped around the dozen or so people, protecting them as they returned to the city gates.

Following that, terrifying figures flew towards the golden swordfish.

After flying for more than ten kilometers, they stared coldly at the twenty or so golden swordfish standing there.

“HMPH!”

The expressions of the three immortal gods changed drastically. They were very strong and wanted to kill them directly, but with the agreement between the immortal gods, their hearts were filled with fear.

They still did not dare to openly violate the agreement between the immortal gods.

“Hu!”

The three of them took a deep breath with ugly expressions and headed directly toward the Immortal Gate.

“Bang!”

“It’s been half a month, and the people from the Dragon Gate have actually been waiting here for half a month. Damn it, damn it!”

On the peak covered by plants, an immortal God could no longer hold back his anger and roared.

The other thirteen immortal gods also had ugly expressions on their faces.

They were not afraid of the Dragon Gate’s strength at all, but now they were actually forced to hide in the immortal gate.

Not to mention the disciples of the Immortal Gate, even the immortal gods had ugly expressions on their faces.

“If there’s no agreement between the immortal gods, I’ll kill them!”

The sect masters of the two immortal sects were extremely gloomy as they shouted coldly.

“Wait a little longer. If they dare to block US for a month or two, then we will take action no matter what!”

The facial muscles of the fat-faced old man in the middle twitched slightly as he said fiercely.

“If the disciples of the immortal sects can’t go out, then what should we do when we buy supplies? No one dares to enter our holy city now, and neither do we dare to go out, but we have to deal with some things!”

An immortal God said with a gloomy face.

“At the moment, we can only lead a team out personally!”

The sect master of the Holy Doctor Celestial sect said with a gloomy face.

The rest of the immortal gods nodded with a gloomy face. This was the only way. The Immortal God was leading a team out to purchase supplies.

It had to be said that this was a great irony.

“Dragon King, the Holy Doctor, Holy Medicine, and Immortal God have started to lead a team out of the city. There has always been the protection of the Immortal God. Our people don’t dare to make a move!”

Mo Qinglong came to Wang Xian’s side and reported.

It had been three days since the last test. In these three days, once someone from the Holy Doctor, Holy Medicine, and Immortal sect came out, there would definitely be an immortal God following them.

The DRAKONIDS and Golden Swordfish didn’t dare to make a move. This was because once they made a move, the immortal God would be able to make a move directly.

After all, the immortal God Agreement was an agreement between the immortal God and Immortal God. The power of the immortal God could not be violated!

“Do you know how many Immortals and gods are there?”

Wang Xian stood up slowly and said to Mo Qinglong while fiddling with the dagger in his hand.

“There’s only one lower immortal!”

Mo Qinglong replied.

“Lower Immortal? Where are you going?”

A cold look flashed across Wang Xian’s eyes as he asked with a smile.

“There are a total of two immortals and gods leading a team out. One of them is going to Xia city while the other is going to the Yuwen clan. They should be purchasing items!”

Mo Qinglong reported.

“The Yuwen clan!”

Wang Xian flicked the dagger in his hand lightly and let out a crisp sound.

The dagger was emitting a green color and was coated with a type of poison. It was a level-13 celestial artifact. With the full strength of a half-step celestial being, it could break the Celestial Being’s defense!

“The Yuwen clan is more than a thousand kilometers away from the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Celestial sect. If we make a move Midway, the other celestials won’t be able to rescue us in time!”

“Ao Jian, ao Yao!”

Wang Xian looked to the side and shouted directly.

“Dragon King!”

“Bring everyone. Let’s go and kill the God!”

A hint of excitement flashed across Wang Xian’s eyes.

Ambushing Immortals and assassinating Immortals. He had this thought when the holy medicine sect closed the city gates and did not come out.

Immortals were very powerful. Even a lower-level immortal would have terrifying power.

However, 20 half-step immortal gods holding immortal god weapons and over 200 infant realm experts were more than enough to kill an immortal God!
