Chapter 500: Equipment Refining And Backyard On Fire

Walking out from Sui Huang’s room, Wang Xian sent Adjaya to another room immediately before bringing Guan Shuqing to another room.

With time on her side, Guan Shuqing started examining Wang Xian and Adjaya.

Wang Xian had long thought of an explanation. He illustrated Adjaya as a patient that required him to treat her over a few days.

Moreover, he told Guan Shuqing that Adjaya was the princess of Dubai and the princess of Dubai wouldn’t marry a man from a foreign country.

Guan Shuqing accepted his explanation with doubts.

Tsk!

In the room a short distance away, Adjaya faced Wang Xian’s room and snorted.

“He’s bullying me because I don’t understand Mandarin. Learning a language is an easy task for me!”

As she mumbled to herself, she dialled a number and soon opened up a video conference.

Several professional Mandarin professors appeared before the screen and started teaching her Mandarin.

To the astonishment of these professors, Adjaya quickly mastered one after another phrase.

“Morning!”

The next day morning, Adjaya was at the door of her room when Wang Xian walked out of his room.

She was wearing an earpiece. When she saw Wang Xian, she greeted, “Morning!”

Huh?

Wang Xian was taken aback. “Good morning! How did you...”

“Xiao Xian, my luggage!”

At this moment, Guan Shuqing’s voice disrupted his words. Wang Xian looked at Adjaya, baffled. She had reverted her attention to her phone while he helped to carry Guan Shuqing’s luggage!

“It’s time to go. We will be heading back to Rivertown directly,” Wang Xian shouted at Adjaya who was looking at her phone screen and wearing an earpiece.

Adjaya nodded her head and followed behind them.

Guan Shuqing was curious as to why Adjaya was constantly looking at her phone. However, she did not ask her.

She still trusted Xiao Xian deeply. Moreover, Xiao Xian had explained a lot to her yesterday.

Wang Xian was glad to see Adjaya acting in this manner. They took the plane and left for Rivertown.

On the plane, Adjaya was still looking at her phone and didn’t say a word.

“Dragon King!”

When they arrived at Rivertown, Mo Yuan drove the car over and greeted him respectfully.

Since the Dragon Sect had been established, they had not been addressing Wang Xian as Young Master. Instead, they called him the Dragon King directly.

“Huh? Have all the things arrived?” Wang Xian asked Mo Yuan.

“They have arrived and all the treasures have been moved to the floating island!”

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded his head.

“Xiao Xian, today’s Saturday. Qingyue and the rest are waiting for you in the villa!” Guan Shuqing said to Wang Xian.

“Although we were only separated for a few days, it felt like three years!” Wang Xian smiled sheepishly.

“Look at how happy you are!”

Guan Shuqing rolled her eyes at him. Soon the car left the airport and drove rapidly towards the villa.

“We are getting out here!”

Seeing Lan Qingyue, Sun Lingxiu and Xiao Yu waiting by the doors, Wang Xian said this to Adjaya.

Mmm!

Adjaya nodded her head. She removed the earpiece and put her phone away. From her, a strong sense of confidence was exhibited instantly.

“Xiao Xian!”

“Brother!”

Lan Qingyue, Xiao Yu and the rest immediately shouted.

Wang Xian smiled upon seeing them and opened up his arms.

“Eh? This is...?”

Lan Qingyue noticed Adjaya, who was following behind Wang Xian, instantly. She frowned and asked about her curiously.

Any woman would feel a strong sense of danger from Adjaya.

“She is from Dubai...”

“I’m Hertha Mohakaben Cesid Al Adjaya. You guys can call me Adjaya. I’ll be Wang Xian’s future wife. You are calling Xiao Xian brother? One, two, three, four... Four is just right. In Dubai, a man can have at most four wives!”

Guan Shuqing was smiling and prepared to introduce her as the princess of Dubai and as a patient of Wang Xian.

However, before she could finish her words, Adjaya’s voice resounded.

She spoke in perfect Mandarin.

As Adjaya spoke, she stepped forward and held onto Wang Xian’s arm. She tilted her head and asked, “How’s my Mandarin, Xiao Xian? Aren’t I incredible? I’ve spent a night mastering Mandarin. Are you surprised? Are you happy?”

Are you surprised?

Are you happy?

When Wang Xian heard Adjaya speak Mandarin, his face stiffened.

Looking at Adjaya, who wrapped her arms around his with a smile, his body couldn’t help but shiver.

Guan Shuqing’s face instantly stiffened and sank.

Lan Qingyue’s smile had also disappeared.

Two furious glares fell on Wang Xian.

Wang Xian could feel dense killing intent and saw Guan Shuqing and Lan Qingyue clenching their fists tightly.

“Scumbag! Didn’t you tell me she’s your patient?”

Guan Shuqing glowered at Wang Xian and her eyes were a little red!

“This... This matter isn’t like you...”

“You are still trying to lie to me?”

Guan Shuqing gave him a harsh stare before storming into the villa furiously.

Lan Qingyue had also turned as cold as ice as she followed Guan Shuqing into the villa.

Xiao Yu was in shock over what had happened. Sun Lingxiu was also caught by surprise. She looked at Adjaya, smiled at her, and hesitated for a moment before returning to her room.

“Brother, you are doing things you shouldn’t. Everything’s on fire now!”

Xiao Yu stared at him before running into the villa.

Haiz!

Wang Xian heaved a long sigh.

“I can accept you having four wives. It wouldn’t do if you had more!”

At this moment, Adjaya, who was beside Wang Xian, remarked suddenly.

Wang Xian felt like his head almost exploded. “Hey, miss, can you tell me about the Art of Equipment Refining in the Fire God’s Secret Book first?”

“Miss? Xiao Xian, do you think I should get a Chinese name in the future?”

Adjaya was baffled, tilted her head and said, “Oh right! Those girls seemed a little angry a while ago. I’ll go comfort them in a while. I believe they will accept me!”

Wang Xian looked to the sky. His expression had changed greatly as he walked towards the villa.

“I had not expected him to have a mistress outside. He’s a scumbag! He’s the biggest scumbag! If she was sister Lingxiu, I still could accept it. But he brought a foreign girl back and lied to me, saying that she’s his patient...”

The moment he entered the house, he heard Guan Shuqing crying.

Wang Xian’s body stiffened, and he turned to glare at Adjaya before entering.

When Xiao Yu saw her walking in, she immediately gestured to Wang Xian and asked him not to come any closer.

Wang Xian rubbed his nose and went to Adjaya. “Tell me about the Art of Equipment Refining.”

“Sure. I have prepared it for you!”

Adjaya took out a few pieces of paper and handed them to him.

“Oh, right. I believe you have seen what happened a while ago. Please don’t give me any more troubles!” Wang Xian looked at Adjaya and said solemnly.

“Leave this to me. If they can accept me, I’ll stay by your side. If they can’t, I will leave. Will this do?” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Adjaya looked solemnly at him suddenly.

“Alright!”
