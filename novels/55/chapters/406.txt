Chapter 407: The Little Prince of Flow City (1)

Dashing young men and pretty babes were all dressed in prim and proper attire as they exchanged conservations with faces full of smiles.

“Gee, there are so many babes here!”

As he spoke, Wang Dahai put his arm around Wang Xian’s shoulder while he observed the babes around him with glistening eyes.

“I could work less hard for 20 or 30 years if I married any one of them!”

“Don’t you have Su Qian? Why? You want to get another lover?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrow as he asked Wang Dahai.

“Talking about that, you’re the fuc*ing awesome one. The two Goddesses in our school... Tell me, how did you do it? I’m just having my eye candy now. I don’t even look at other women when I’m with Su Qian!” said Wang Dahai with envy as he looked at Wang Xian.

“Here’s one finger for you to comprehend!” Wang Xian smiled and put up a finger.

“Taka Kato? Erect seven times in one night?” [1]

Wang Dahai stared at him with his wide-opened eyes.

“This is called ‘Continuously!’” [2]

Wang Xian smirked as Wang Dahai pointed his middle finger to him with contempt. Both of them began to evaluate the babes around them again.

When guys get together, that is what they do.

But Wang Dahai’s cousin and a few around them were full of ridicule and contempt when they saw what the duo was doing.

“Hur? Xiao Xiang?”

When Wang Xian was looking around, he suddenly saw a familiar figure walking in.

A boy walked in as he timidly looked at the crowd around him. Apparently, he was not used to such an environment. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Xiao Xiang, over here!”

Wang Xian smiled and reached out his arm, waving to that boy.

Upon seeing Wang Xian, Ji Xiang was stunned for a moment before he ran over with a beaming face.

“Elder Brother!”

Ji Xiang’s face was filled with happiness as he ran to Wang Xian.

“Why are you here alone? Where’s your father?” asked Wang Xian while stroking his hair. Ji Xiang was completely back to an ordinary person with a fair-looking skin tone on his face.

“I told my dad that I wanted to come here alone so that I can be independent. He came here early, but I don’t know where he is now!” Ji Xiang was a little shy as he spoke.

“Come, sit over here!” Wang Xian smiled as he patted an empty seat beside him. Seeing Wang Dahai’s doubtful look, he explained, “He’s a son of my friend.”

At this time, Maniac Ji was considered to be a friend, a loyal friend.

When the Sacred Followers Guild came to Rivertown for his life, Wang Xian had not informed Maniac Ji. Yet, Maniac Ji rushed to him immediately.

At that time, Maniac Ji killed several people from the Sacred Enforcer team.

When Maniac Ji came, Wang Xian was astounded. Wang Xian had not asked him to come but he came because of his promise. His promise had put him in a position that went against a Sacred Sect. Wang Xian was speechless about that.

In his heart, he already took him as his friend, and not someone who owed him a favor.

It was his honor to know someone like him in life.

“Okay, brother.” Ji Xiang smiled.

“I haven’t seen you for a while, and you’ve grown up!” said Wang Xian as he looked at Ji Xiang.

He chuckled as he replied, “Thanks to you!”

“Haha!” Wang Xian patted him on the shoulder.

“Hur? Another ill-mannered lad?”

“What the... Birds of a feather flock together!”

At this time, Wang Xian’s cousin and several young men had disdainful expressions on their faces when they saw another young lad walk to Wang Xian and Wang Dahai.

The shy-looking juvenile was about fourteen or fifteen. His feeble behavior exhibited a lack of confidence which made it evident that he was not someone from a noble family.

Besides, that boy was wearing an ordinary student outfit which was even more amusing.

Wang Dahai’s cousin felt embarrassed at once as she threw the trio a disdainful glance.

“Young Master Nan, Young Master Luan, Young Master Feng are here!”

“The top-notch young masters of Flow City are here!”

At this moment, those young men and babes beside Wang Dahai’s cousin were astounded when they saw those people who strolled in. All of them turned to those people with trepidation.

“Jingshan, who are they?” asked Wang Dahai’s cousin when she saw the aghast look on those people beside her.

“They’re the top-notch young masters of Flow City, the future successors of three families which nobody can afford to offend in Flow City.”

The young man reminded Wang Dahai’s cousin with a stern look.

“Young Master Feng and the rest are walking to us.”

Just then, all of them witnessed those few young men walking over.

The few people beside Wang Dahai’s cousin hurriedly stood up and greeted them with radiant smiles. “Young Master Feng, Young Master Luan, Young Master Luan!”

“Mm!”

They nodded their heads indifferently as they looked around. After which, they turned their attention to them again. “Are there any seats?”

“Yes, yes. Here!”

The young men beside Wang Dahai’s cousin smiled apologetically. “Young Master Feng, Young Master Luan, Young Master Nan, you can sit over here. Please take a seat!”

“Mm!”

The three young men went over and sat down without the slightest humility. Apparently, they did not regard these people highly.

“The three of you go over to the other side and give your seats to us!”

When the young men beside Wang Dahai’s cousin saw Young Master Feng and the rest take their seats, they looked at Wang Xian and Wang Dahai and frowned.

Wang Dahai froze for a moment, looking startled. “Why should we go? These are our seats.”

“Dahai, get lost now if we asked you to. Stop your whining. Go to another corner with your classmate!”

Wang Dahai’s cousin glowered at him with impatience.

“Cousin, why should we?”

Wang Dahai pulled his face, but he stood up eventually and tugged Wang Xian’s clothes with a sullen face.

“Ignore them. Let them find their own seats!”

Wang Xian glanced at Wang Dahai’s cousin and the rest with a touch of contempt on his face.

“Brat, I asked you to give up your seats, and you should do what I say. Are you unhappy about this?”

When a young man saw Wang Xian’s attitude, he stared daggers at him.

“Hurry up. Get lost now and stop being so ignorant!”

When those young men saw Young Master Feng and the rest walking over, they immediately pulled long faces at Wang Xian.

The smile disappeared from Wang Xian’s face as he swept his gaze across those young men. “You really treat this place like your house?”

“You, a country bumpkin! Do you think you are fit to sit here? Go to one corner and stay there. Look at both of you, don’t you feel embarrassed about yourselves?”

A young man stood up, looking over at Wang Xian and casting cold gazes at the trio.

“These are our seats!” said Ji Xiang weakly with slight blush on his cheek. He had confusion in his eyes when he saw the few young men staring daggers at him and Wang Xian with disgust.

“You, little brat, can jolly well scram to one corner with your bumpkin brother. Look at your attire! How dare you even attend this kind of gathering over here? I don’t even know how you guys got in!”

The young man beside Wang Dahai’s cousin sneered as he glared at Ji Xiang.
