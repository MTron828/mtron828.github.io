Chapter 1474: 1474 in the Heartless Sword Dao sect

“Be careful of the surroundings. Kill! All disciples, all experts, Listen Up! Kill!”

The sect master of the towering Sky Sword sect saw Ao Jian and the others attacking, and his face revealed a terrified expression.

He roared loudly and ordered all the disciples of the sect.

Even if it was an ordinary disciple, they had to make a move.

Life and death, life and death!

He knew that there was a terrifying seventh level profound void martial artist hiding in the surroundings!

“What?”

At the periphery of the battlefield, the disciples of the towering sky sword sect who were about to escape revealed shocked expressions when they heard the order of the sect master.

They want us to rush over too?

We haven’t reached the profound void martial stage yet. If we rush over, won’t we be instantly killed?

“All disciples attack? This? The towering Sky Sword sect is at the point of life and Death?”

“How is this possible? This is the most powerful force within a radius of thousands of kilometers. Now, they are actually at the point of life and Death!”

When the experts and disciples of the surrounding aristocratic families heard this order, they were also dumbstruck.

This war was clearly not something that those below the profound void realm could participate in.

Unless the towering sky sword sect was at the point of life and death, otherwise, disciples below the profound void realm would only be sending themselves to their deaths!

“We... We...”

Disciples below the profound void realm were also somewhat dumbstruck when they heard the sect leader’s order.

They all gulped and looked at the corpses on the sea, their faces filled with fear.

“Die!”

At this moment, a cold voice sounded from the center of the battlefield.

“No, no!”

A familiar voice suddenly came from the golden light. The voice was somewhat tragic.

Hearing these voices, the disciples of the towering sky sword sect trembled.

“First Elder, that’s the first Elder’s voice!”

“The voice of the towering sky law-enforcing elder, this... this...”

All the disciples of the towering Sky Sword sect had a look of panic on their faces.

This voice was the screams of the top-notch experts of the sword sect.

Ao Yaoyao moved!

The group of Strange Demons also moved!

After the two sword masters were blocked by Wang Xian, the towering sky sword sect didn’t have any ability to defend themselves.

“PFFT!”

At this moment, a pathetic figure flew out from the sky covered by Golden Light.

There was a long sword mark on his chest.

“Sect master!”

A middle-aged man saw that their sect master was heavily injured and shouted in fear.

“Deacon Liang, how did we provoke this terrifying force!”

The sect master of the Sky High Sword sect shouted at Deacon Liang with a pale face.

It was this Deacon Liang who had asked for help before the battle started.

“Sect master, yes, it was elder Qi and the others. A young man came here to take revenge on two families. The young man destroyed one family!”

“When he destroyed another family, a woman from that family had already been accepted as a disciple by Elder Qi. Then, then...”

“PFFT!”

Before Deacon Liang could speak, the sect master of the towering Sky Sword sect couldn’t help but spit out a mouthful of blood.

What the F * ck? Just for the sake of a new disciple, the towering sky sword sect actually suffered a catastrophe?

If the two sword masters could not withstand the other party, the towering sky sword sect would cease to exist from then on.

Just because of a single disciple?

At the thought of this, he could not help but spit out another mouthful of blood.

“B * Stard!”

He shouted with an extremely embarrassed expression. It was unknown whether he was scolding Wang Xian and the rest or elder qi and the rest.

Not far away from them, Ren Xingchen was holding a blood-stained longsword in his hand. He stared coldly at the song clan leader and Song Wan.

In the entire song clan, only a dozen people were standing there with despair on their faces.

When they saw the furious and terrified expression of the sect master of the towering sky sword sect, their bodies trembled violently.

They never expected things to turn out this way.

They had thought that they could kill Ren Xingchen with the help of the towering sky sword sect.

However, they had never thought that a terrifying force would directly help Ren Xingchen.

They were even on the verge of destroying the towering sky sword sect.

This was the towering sky sword sect!

The strongest force within a thousand kilometers.

In the vast region, it was not a weak existence.

“You guys helped the Wu clan to destroy our Ren clan. You would never have thought that this would happen!”

Ren Xingchen’s gaze swept across the center of the battlefield as he spoke indifferently to Song Wan and the Song Clan’s clan leader.

“Gulp!”

Song Wan and the others swallowed a mouthful of saliva as they closed their eyes in despair.

“Boom Boom Boom!”

At this moment, another terrifying sound came from the sky.

The sound spread to an area of a hundred kilometers. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Everyone raised their heads and looked towards the sky.

At a height of 10,000 meters, they could only see terrifying energy collisions, but they couldn’t see anything else.

It wasn’t just the area below. The battle at a height of 10,000 meters in the sky shook five or six nearby cities.

When the people and experts in the cities sensed the terrifying collision sounds, they all looked in the direction of the Sky High Sword sect.

“It’s at least a powerhouse at level seven of the Seethrough realm fighting. What happened to the Atlas Sword Sect?”

The powerhouses of the Seethrough realm looked up into the sky and thought to themselves with their hearts palpitating.

“What a terrifying physical body. What a terrifying energy. What kind of energy is he releasing?”

In the sky 10,000 meters high, the two swordmasters were standing in front of Wang Xian, one on the left and the other on the right. They were staring at Wang Xian with cold sweat on their foreheads.

“Phew, it’s going to be troublesome to deal with the two seventh-level insightful void stage swordmasters. Especially since their combined attack is quite strong!”

Wang Xian exhaled slightly and stood in the middle of the five elements grinding mill. “However, this is the end of it!”

He raised his head slightly!

“Roar!”

A dragon’s roar shook the area within 500 kilometers.

Under the shocked gazes of the two swordmasters, Wang Xian’s dragon head turned into a size of 4,000 meters.

It was an incomparably huge dragon horn. The dragon whiskers on both sides were at least a few hundred meters long. They were fiery red in color and were emitting flames.

The pair of dragon eyes was the size of a house and had a huge mouth.

Majestic and divine!

When the two swordmasters saw this dragon head, they had the urge to kneel down.

“What... What kind of divine creature is this!”

The two of them looked at each other and saw the fear in each other’s eyes.

“Run!”

The two didn’t hesitate at all and directly fled into the distance.

They were really afraid!

Just now, they had spent a lot of effort to fight against this creature. Now, in this state, it was obviously not something they could resist.

“Is the vast area about to undergo a huge change? Why are there so many terrifying creatures appearing?”

Both of their eyes were filled with fear.

A few months ago, an expert known as the desolate goddess had appeared out of nowhere.

At that time, an elite disciple of a first-rate family in the vast region, the Nanshan family, had provoked her. In the end, that elite disciple was killed on the spot.

The Nanshan family was furious and sent an expert to take revenge.

In the end, they did not expect that the end of the Nanshan family would come!

They heard from the Trembling Voice of a seventh rank profound void martial artist that the desolate goddess was standing on a terrifying beast that was 10,000 meters tall, rampaging through the Nanshan Castle.

The entire South Mountain Castle, as well as the South Mountain Heavenly Lake, had been razed to the ground.
