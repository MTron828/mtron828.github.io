Chapter 1679: 1678 was kneeling down at a terrifying speed

When Mo Sha led an old man and flew over like a demon god, Wang Xian recognized him.

In the vast area, the hunchbacked old man who asked Wang Xian to help him expel the dark soul in his body.

The old man with the strength of the ninth level of the Seethrough void tier with turbid eyes.

A fellow who could be called an old devil.

If it wasn’t for Wang Xian who was able to suppress him, Mo Sha would definitely not listen to him like that.

In fact, at the beginning, Mo Sha was prepared to kidnap him.

When he recognized Mo Sha, he suddenly sensed an extremely familiar aura.

This aura came from the heart of Light and darkness.

His body contained the blood and some energy of the heart of Light and darkness.

The heart of Light and darkness was the heart of the Divine Dragon King of Light and darkness. He was a powerhouse who stood at the peak of the universe.

In the heart of Light and darkness, there was the Great Dao of Light and darkness.

When Wang Xian injected the heart into Mo Sha’s body, he used the heart of Light and darkness to temper his bloodline.

It elevated his bloodline to a terrifying level.

In addition, from the heart of Light and darkness, he had learned a lot about the cultivation path of darkness. He had even learned the method to ignite the divine fire to build his divine kingdom and become a god.

As long as he had sufficient resources, he could continue to improve.

However, the heart of light and darkness had been completely fused by Wang Xian. The tempered blood of Mo Sha was completely under the control of the heart of Light and darkness.

Wang Xian could instantly strip the blood from Mo Sha’s body and make him die instantly.

He could also use the heart of light and darkness to suppress his will.

Wang Xian gently touched his heart and stared at the figure who stood up in the darkness with a smile on his face.

At this moment, Mo Sha’s body was trembling violently.

He could feel the motionless blood all over his body, and his expression changed drastically.

When he heard Wang Xian’s words, he had a bad premonition in his heart.

Now, it seemed that this was indeed the case.

He was still filled with fear towards Wang Xian, especially the heart of Light and darkness.

If not for the fear of the terror of the heart of Light and darkness, he would have killed his way to the vast area and snatched it away after he became the demon lord!

“Damn it, I have already stopped heading to the vast area. It’s just fear in my heart. Now, I still can’t escape from this fellow’s Palm!”

Mo Sha felt that he was about to cry. Looking at the smiling young man, the corner of his mouth twitched.

“I shouldn’t have come here. F * ck, why did I Come Here!”

Mo Sha wished he could slap his face a few times.

“Shut up. How dare you call us by our demonic God’s name. I will tear you into pieces and let you enjoy the pain of being bitten by evil spirits!”

The old man in Black Scales was stunned. He shouted at Wang Xian with a cold expression.

To dare to call them by their demonic God’s name was an unforgivable crime.

“Do it. Leave No one in there alive!”

The owner of the weapon raised the huge hammer in his hand and shouted loudly with a ferocious expression.

“Oh?”

Wang Xian looked at the black-scaled old man and the owner of the weapon and raised his eyebrows.

However, when Mo Sha heard the black-scaled old man’s words and saw Wang Xian’s gaze, his body trembled!

Damn it, he nearly peed his pants!

“Shut the F * ck up!”

Mo Sha hurriedly growled in a low voice. He glared fiercely at the black-scaled old man who was flattering him and flew towards Wang Xian.

“HMM, the demon god wants to do it himself?”

The black-scaled old man didn’t see Mo Sha’s gaze. When he saw him flying over, he was stunned.

“Humph, you dare to call our Lord Devil God by his name. You are courting death. It is your honor to be able to make our Lord Devil God kill him personally!”

The black-scaled old man slightly raised his head and coldly looked at the weapon master and Medicine Master by the side. He continued, “Today, it is your honor to be able to see our Lord Devil God Personally Attack!”

“Witness the power of our Lord Devil God!”

He continued to suck up to Mo Sha.

As the former Devil God of the Devil God tribe, he could be said to be shamelessly sucking up now.

There was nothing he could do. Ever since Mo Sha returned, he had crushed him time and time again. Now, he was completely subservient.

He did not have the slightest bit of disloyalty!

However, what he did not see was that his few bootlicking nearly caused Mo Sha, who was flying over, to stumble and fall to the ground.

His pitch-black face was filled with the desire to turn around and kill this talkative fellow!

“Alright, Alright. Then let’s see the strength of the Devil God!”

“Hehe, I thought that the Devil God wouldn’t have to personally act today. Now, I am truly honored!”

The weapon master and the medicine master smiled when they heard the black-scaled old man’s words and said in unison.

“I heard that this Lord Devil God is extremely terrifying. He has been training outside for more than a thousand years. Now, when he returns, he has directly defeated the Old Devil God!”

“That Lord black-scaled should be the old Devil God. For this lord to be so convinced, I’m afraid that Lord Devil God’s strength is extremely terrifying!”

“That’s only natural. This is the nine God Empire’s Devil God, one of the nine gods. He is one of the most powerful top-notch experts in the transcendental continent!”

“That Patriarch Fengyun is probably not a match for this demon God!”

Below, all the disciples of the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop were discussing.

Their eyes were fixed on the demon God’s imposing figure.

“Good, good. Kill him. Kill him. That guy is the leader of the mysterious assassin organization!”

“He dares to call the Demon God by his name. What mysterious assassin organization? What Young Master Wang? All of them must die!”

The disciples of the sacred flame clan who were watching the battle from dozens of kilometers away roared in excitement.

“It is said that this new demon god of the Demon God tribe is very terrifying. I wonder how strong He is. Watch him carefully and report to the higher-ups when we return!”

The scouts who were hiding within a radius of hundreds of kilometers stared at this scene closely.

Everyone was filled with curiosity towards this new demon god who controlled the demon God tribe.

“Young master Wang, Please Run!”

Feng Yun’s expression changed drastically when she saw this demon god rushing over. She quickly said to Wang Xian.

“He actually dared to rush over by himself. Doesn’t he think highly of the fire Lark Tribe?”

At the same time, she stared at Mo Sha and raised the staff in her hand with a face full of anger.

“Senior Feng Yun!”

Looking at Feng Yun who was about to make a move on Mo Sha, Wang Xian waved his arm and pressed the staff down.

Feng Yun was slightly stunned. She looked at Wang Xian in astonishment.

“Don’t make a move!”

Wang Xian said to Feng Yun with a smile. He looked at Mo Sha who was flying over with a smile.

Mo Sha’s speed was terrifying. He was extremely fast.

When he arrived in front of the firecloud mountain range to defend against the fireworks, he dashed over.

The fireworks, which could injure a person of the first level of longevity, did not leave any marks on his body.

Upon seeing this scene, everyone from the fire Lark clan was shocked.

“Young master Wang, quick...”

The fire Lark Clan Elders’faces changed drastically as they hurriedly stood in front of Wang Xian to block him.

However, what happened next shocked everyone.

“Putong!”

Mo Sha flew over at a terrifying speed and knelt down immediately!

That putong sound was crisp and crisp!Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels
