Chapter 1662: 1662 was killed in one move

“Life and Death Pill Workshop, Holy Item Workshop, Demon God tribe, all of you are courting death!”

Wang Xian, who was floating in the sky, looked at everyone around him. His calm voice fell into everyone’s ears.

Upon hearing this, the expressions of everyone in the life and Death Workshop and Holy Item Workshop changed completely.

Especially the elders of the two big forces, their faces changed dramatically, full of disbelief.

“Who are you? There is no one like you in the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan. Moreover, how could you escape the detection of the detection array?”

The elder of the holy item forging workshop gulped and asked with a terrified face.

“He is a member of the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan!”

“How can this young man be so terrifying and cover the entire sky? Is he an expert at the half-step longevity realm?”

The disciples from the two major factions also shouted in a low voice, their faces filled with fear.

They had already succeeded in ambushing the fire cloud sparrow race, but they had never expected such an expert to suddenly appear.

This...

“Senior, the people of our demonic God tribe have no enmity with you. We are willing to leave immediately!”

“Yes, yes, senior. We are willing to leave immediately. We apologize to you!”

At this moment, the five elders of the demon God tribe suddenly begged for mercy.

Everyone was shocked again.

The five experts of the demon god tribe actually surrendered so humbly?

This... They were people of the nine God Empire, elders of the Demon God tribe!

Even if they were to meet a half-step longevity expert, it shouldn’t be like this, right?

“So Your Demon God tribe is here to help the life and Death Elixir Workshop and the holy item forging workshop. If I had known earlier, I would have killed all of you the last time I met you!”

Wang Xian looked at the five of them and said faintly.

If he knew that they were enemies, Wang Xian would have killed them immediately.

“But it’s not too late now!”

As he spoke, the two five elemental millstones in the sky began to operate. A grayish destructive force of the five elements was directed downwards.

It covered the entire area of 40 kilometers!

“You... you killed us. If you dare to kill us, our demon God tribe will not let you off!”

The five elders of the demon God tribe had a drastic change in expression as they shouted in horror.

“Even the five elders of the demon God tribe are so afraid of him!”

“Last time, could it be that the flame soul was stolen by this person, and our five elders were injured by him?”

Below them, the faces of everyone from the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop, as well as the disciples of the Demon God tribe, changed drastically.

They felt the dusky power, and their bodies trembled slightly.

“Defend! Defend!”

“Run! Run Now!”

The elders of the two large factions immediately shouted.

The malevolence and excitement on their faces had completely turned into fear and despair.

“Run! Run!”

Under the orders of the two elders, everyone immediately fled into the distance in fear.

The absolute geniuses of the two large factions!

The elite disciples of the two large factions!

This was especially so for Jiang Xingkong and Shui Lian Yi. They were the peerless prodigies of the central continent.

In the future, they might become the forefathers of a region at the longevity level.

However, right now, they were fleeing with faces full of fear.

“Ahhhh!”

When the grayish attack landed, the sound of a miserable scream instantly rang out.

With Wang Xian’s current strength, he could fight against three to four half-step-to longevity level experts and kill more than 40,000 people around him with ease.

“Boom!”

A destructive sound rang out. Everyone, including more than a dozen experts at level nine of the Seethrough realm, widened their eyes in fear.

One move and they would all die!

One move and he would be killed instantly!

It didn’t matter if you were a powerful expert at level nine of the Seethrough realm!

It didn’t matter if you were a Peerless Heaven’s pride disciple with a strong background and powerful strength in the continent!

With one move, all of them turned into dust.

“Bang, Bang, Bang!”

One by one, the corpses fell to the ground and let out a muffled sound.

Everyone widened their eyes and stared at the figure in the sky in astonishment.

With just one move, he had killed all the people from the three major forces. Tens of thousands of people were no match for one move.

There were more than a thousand insightful void martial artists.

This...

“Brother Wang Xian, you are so powerful!”

Huo Luo'er looked at Wang Xian in a daze. Her face was filled with shock and excitement.

She held onto Wang Xian’s arm happily. Her little face was flushed with excitement.

She had already expected Wang Xian to be very strong, but she didn’t expect him to be so terrifying.

He killed tens of thousands of people in one move!

With such strength, she felt that even her mother was much weaker than him.

“My... My God... who... who is this young master?”

“My God, half-step longevity. He is definitely a half-step longevity. Moreover, he is not an ordinary half-step longevity!”

“He’s too strong. is he the hidden powerhouse of our fire Lark Clan?”

Below them, the 10,000 to 20,000 members of the fire Lark clan trembled as they stared at Wang Xian with a crazed expression.

The sudden attack of this mysterious powerhouse instantly killed everyone on the other side.

This was simply too shocking.

If not for him, they would have a narrow escape.

“Young master, thank you for your help!”

The two elders of the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan looked at each other with flushed faces. They immediately flew over and said respectfully.

In the past few days, they had also received news that a person of high status had come to their fire cloud sparrow clan.

The matriarch and the patriarch of the clan had personally welcomed him.

They were not qualified to know who the other party was. However, after seeing Wang Xian’s terrifying strength and his close relationship with Huo Luo'er, they could vaguely guess.

The honorable person might be the young man in front of them.

“We are on the same side!”

Wang Xian said to them calmly.

The words ‘We are on the same side’instantly warmed the hearts of the two elders and the people from the fire lark below.

This was what it meant to be on the same side!

“Next, you guys from the masked assassin organization should die too!”

At this moment, under everyone’s gaze, Wang Xian swept his gaze downwards and clawed with his arm.

One Gray Dragon Claw after another instantly grabbed the necks of the two hundred people below.

“Cough cough, cough cough. Sir, we are members of the fire lark tribe. We are not...”

The moment the Miniature Dragon Claw grabbed the two hundred people below, the pupils of the two hundred people contracted slightly. They hurriedly cried for help. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Crack

However, at this moment, Wang Xian clenched his palm gently.

Bang! Bang! Bang

More than 200 people were killed instantly. One by one, they fell to the ground.

Everyone in the surroundings was horrified. When they saw the changes in the faces of the people who fell to the ground, all of them inhaled a mouthful of cold air.

“This sir is so terrifying. He actually saw through everyone in the masked assassin organization with a single glance. Oh My God!”

“The masked assassin organization was killed with a wave of his hand. It’s too strong, too strong!”

“Sir, where did you come from? Why haven’t we seen you before?”

Everyone from the fire Lark clan looked at this scene in awe. They were all shocked and mumbled to themselves.

Everyone from the Holy Fire clan looked at Wang Xian in astonishment as they sized him up.

However, the faces of the young men from Lie Hanshan turned from white to red and from red to green!

They, but also look down on this young!
