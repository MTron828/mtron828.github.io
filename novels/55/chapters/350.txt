Chapter 351: Ambush

Wang Xian assessed the Progenitor Tree in his body with a heavy look. Yet, he had neither discovered the use of it, nor observed any physical changes to the tree after studying it for the day.

It remained rooted and swaying within Wang Xian’s body, completely indifferent about him.

“Forget it. If a young sapling of the Progenitor Tree, which is also regarded as the Origin of All Trees, is able to enter my body, then it should be pretty formidable!” Wang Xian consoled himself. Which was also all that he could do for now as he lay on the bed to rest.

At dawn, Wang Xian, Sun Lingxiu and Miracle Doctor Blood Man rushed for the airport in a rented car after having breakfast at the hotel.

As the airport was located in the suburbs, there were no neighborhoods within a radius of several kilometers.

“Dear guests, how many visits have you made to the Shangjing?” the middle-aged driver asked. As he spoke, he looked through the rearview mirror and smiled at Wang Xian and Sun Lingxiu, while they sat behind.

“Just a few!” Wang Xian replied with a smile.

“Oh!” the driver acknowledged with glee. Just then, his phone rang.

“Hey, Old Wang, what’s up?” the driver said as he answered the call.

“The bridge is congested due to a traffic incident? I’m in a rush to the airport. Aye, what rotten luck. Sure, I got it!” the driver replied to the caller before he looked at Miracle Doctor Blood Man who was sitting beside him.

“There’s been an accident on the road at the bridge. My coworker said a muck truck has been overturned and toppled on top of a smaller car. The entire car’s flattened. How terrible,” the driver informed.

“For now, it’ll be tough to drive over. I can only take you through a shortcut!” the driver continued, chatting conversationally with the Miracle Doctor Blood Man.

“We’re catching the morning flight at 10 am. So long as we don’t miss it, it’s fine!” the Miracle Doctor Blood Man replied to the driver nonchalantly.

“Relax, not to worry! I guarantee we won’t be late. Besides, it’s only an additional three to four kilometers of driving,” the driver assured with a laugh as he accelerated.

Wang Xian and Sun Lingxiu were not the least bit bothered either, as the two continued chatting softly in the backseat.

Holding onto Sun Lingxiu’s Illuminating Pearl, Wang Xian assisted in cultivating it using his Dragon Energy.

This Illuminating Pearl was a mere Level 9, which was a tad too low given Sun Lingxiu’s powers.

But, with her physical constitution and Light Divine Dragon Transformation, it would not be long before she could upgrade this Illuminating Pearl to Level 10.

“This Illuminating Pearl would make a piece of pretty good jewelry!” Sun Lingxiu joked gleefully, as she placed it on her neck and gestured to Wang Xian.

“That’s because you’re pretty!” Wang Xian smiled back.

Sun Lingxiu blushed.

Screech!

“Apologies! Sorry, I need to go relieve myself!” the driver apologized as he stopped the car.

The car was parked along a narrow pathway, where remnants of demolished houses remained on its sides.

There was not a soul around.

Excusing himself briefly, the driver got out of the car before running to the back, as if it was really urgent.

Wang Xian and others remained unbothered.

Pit, pat! Pit, pat!

Suddenly, at that moment, a sound came from underneath the car.

“Oh no!” the Miracle Doctor Blood Man shouted with a contorted expression upon hearing the noise. Wang Xian and Sun Lingxiu were taken by surprise.

Boom!

In the next moment, they felt a powerful wave of energy surging from beneath the car towards them.

With a shudder on his face, Wang Xian picked Sun Lingxiu up and dodged immediately, as the Earth Dragon Energy surrounded the air with the color of custard.

However, Miracle Doctor Blood Man was not as lucky.

Boom, boom, boom!

As the explosions continued, the entire rental car blew into pieces. To the point where more than half of the car turned into ashes due to the blasts.

These terrifying explosions were more powerful than a single all-kill strike by an Inborn expert.

Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh!

The explosions had just ended when a gush of thick, green smog came blowing in their direction.

Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk!

In the air, the green smog was sizzling, and as droplets of liquid fell to the ground, they began to corrode the land.

As the land eroded, it opened up many little holes the depth of a finger along the pathway.

If a drop of the liquid was this horrifying, imagine the terror of this poisonous green smog which now covered the area of a hundred meters in radius.

Death was almost guaranteed if one remained within.

“The Divine Lightning Column, how powerful. It’s almost as deadly as the attacks by one from the Dan Realm,” a voice commented.

“Haha! Young Master Bian, we, the Xiao Family, have made this Divine Lightning Column by enduring huge risks, while gathering lightning and thunder. Of course it’s very formidable,” another replied.

“The poisonous liquid from Old Du really kills without warning. Such potent poison can kill hundreds of thousands. Even an Inborn expert will surely die by coming into contact!” a third voice exclaimed.

“Ack ack! One must use their brains in order to lay an ambush to kill. With so many destructive weapons, slaying three Inborn experts would be such an easy feat!” the last voice boasted.

Right then, on the dilapidated buildings of houses which were soon to be demolished, several figures stood.

There was a total of seven of them.

There was a young man, watching emotionlessly with hands resting on his back. It was Bian Yaoquan. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

On his sides stood the Poison Duo.

Alongside the trio were four Inborn experts. Amongst them was a middle-aged man with specks of lightning zapping all over his body.

The second was a thin and frail old man with a dark stare.

And the remaining two were chubby Elders with striking resemblance.

The group of seven were watching the scene below with satisfied smiles.

Meanwhile, the area below was covered in green smog within a hundred-meter radius.

The sizzling noise kept coming, and the area looked like a living hell.

As drops of green liquid fell onto the ground, it gave form to numerous deep narrow holes.

A giant pothole was formed within a twenty-meter radius due to the explosion earlier.

The pothole was five meters deep, and looked absolutely horrendous.

“Seems like inviting you guys over was the right choice.” Bian Yaoquan smirked as he looked at the area below.

“Haha, why of course!” the ominous and feeble-looking Elder laughed with a wide grin, revealing his stained teeth.

“Sigh. It’s such a pity that the Holy Goddess should die just like this. Truly a pity!” Bian Yaoquan said dryly as he stared at the clouds of green gases which loomed over the area.

“Haha! Young Master Bian’s a true gentleman who treasures the ladies. I hope Young Master Bian will not forget to pay us for this mission after!” the two chubby Elders teased as they roared in laughter.

“That’s for sure. I, Bian Yaoquan, am a man of my word!” Bian Yaoquan replied conceitedly.

“Ah!” a voice shouted.

“You bunch of jerks!” the voice continued.

Just then, a figure flew out from the explosions and poisonous smog.

The Miracle Doctor Blood Man was drenched in blood. As the fresh coagulated blood soaked him thoroughly, it made him look really pathetic.

He flew out from the poisonous smog, before falling onto the ground in excruciating pain.

The cries from Miracle Doctor Blood Man attracted Bian Yaoquan, who raised an eyebrow.

“Oh? There’s a fellow who survived!” Bian Yaoquan exclaimed in excitement as he looked over.

“Haha! He’s shed a few layers of skin!” the Poison Duo added as they watched Miracle Doctor Blood Man, as though they were assessing a dead body.

“Tsk tsk, are the other two completely dead? How upsetting!” Bian Yaoquan commented. He was somewhat disappointed, upon seeing the Miracle Doctor Blood Man on the floor, crying in pain after flying out from the rubble.

“I even prepared to have some fun with them!” Bian Yaoquan continued, as he raised his brows in a face of discontentment. Whoever offended him shall die!

But, just as he ended his statement, a voice came from amidst the poisonous smog.

“You won’t be disappointed!” the voice assured.
