3294 3093 battle to the death

“HM? The Righteous God race gave up on the landing battle?”

“It seems that the righteous God race provoked the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace. In the end, the Dragon King killed a large number of their disciples. The Dragon Palace also has a universe Knight Level 7 great being, so they were afraid that the Dragon Palace would launch a sneak attack during the landing battle, so they gave up on the landing battle.”

There, the Giants of the primeval continent, a group of giants face excited look, they in the heart heavy sigh of relief.

The strength of the righteous race, in their eyes, is terrifying.

The Giants have a 30% chance of winning this battle.

Now that they’ve given up, it’s a huge blessing for them.

It could save them a lot of money.

…

“Huh?”

Just as the Giants breathed a sigh of relief,.

Located in the ancient Sea Race of the continent, Wang Xian from the ancient sea race auction house out of the Treasury.

This time the harvest, for him is very good.

But then, there’s a lot of information coming from the cosmic brain.

When he saw the message, he was a little surprised.

“The Righteous God race actually gave up on disembarking?”

“They are now flying towards the Dragon Palace together with the ancient sea race. They are preparing to destroy the Dragon Palace!”

“Hahaha!”

When Wang Xian saw these two messages, he couldn’t help but laugh out loud.

He really, really didn’t expect that the righteous God race would give up on the disembarking battle and join forces with the Ancient Sea Race to destroy the Dragon Palace.

Did they think that they could destroy the Dragon Palace?

“Aren’t they sending resources to our Dragon Palace? What a bunch of good people!”

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly.

Originally, he had already decided in his heart to destroy the ancient sea race. As for the Righteous God race, if they were to pay a price, Wang Xian wouldn’t make a move against them.

After all, those people were the only ones who provoked him.

With a good attitude, everything was negotiable.

However, he didn’t expect that the other party would be so crazy to destroy the Dragon Palace.

He looked at some information on the universe’s AI, and a mocking expression appeared on his face.

The Righteous God race had suffered a huge loss this time, and they wanted to make up for this loss. The only way was to destroy the Dragon Palace and obtain all the Divine Dragon Palace.

Obviously, they had the same idea.

“Since you are courting death and want to destroy our Dragon Palace from tens of thousands of light years away, we will naturally welcome you!”

Wang Xian smiled. His figure moved slightly and disappeared immediately.

In the next moment, his figure appeared in the Dragon Palace.

“Dragon King!”

Prime Minister Gui sensed Wang Xian’s arrival and immediately came forward to welcome him.

“Someone has sent us a gift. We are prepared to welcome them and get all the members of the Dragon Palace Ready. We must treat them well and not let one of them escape.”

Wang Xian said to Prime Minister Gui with a smile.

“It’s the Dragon King. This time, there are 17,000 to 18,000 universe knights from two different races. It is indeed a great gift for us.”

Prime Minister Gui was full of smiles.

17,000 to 18,000 universe knights and all the accumulated gifts from the number one and number two forces in the surrounding Lu Xing Kong were a great joyous occasion for the Dragon Palace.

“I’ll send someone to prepare.”

Prime Minister Gui said and immediately left.

Wang Xian smiled and nodded.

The Dragon Palace was currently lacking some top-notch combat strength. After they arrived, they wouldn’t be lacking anymore.

He thought to himself and took out the universal AI to watch.

At this moment, on the universal AI, all the forces in the surrounding Lu galaxy were paying attention to the actions of the righteous God race and the Ancient Sea Race.

Everyone was guessing the outcome of this battle.

Countless people were discussing it.

However, many people still trusted the righteous God race and the ancient sea race very much.

They believed that they could defeat the Dragon Palace. As for completely destroying the Dragon Palace, they couldn’t be sure.

That was because the Dragon Palace of the divine dragon lineage was very strong

“This time, I’ll let you see the strength of the Dragon Palace.”

Wang Xian looked at the various guesses on the universe’s AI and smiled.

Not long after, a message came from the Water Dragon Palace asking if he wanted to help.

Wang Xian rejected it immediately.

There was no need for them to waste their time running over.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

At the same time, there were about 90 space hum beasts flying in the void of the surrounding starry sky.

Each of them was extremely huge. On their bodies, there were countless experts.

The Army of the Ancient Sea Race met the army of the Righteous God race.

This time, the true God race had mobilized all their forces for the landing battle.

Sou! Sou! Sou

On the Space Hum Beast led by the ancient sea race, eight figures flew toward the center of the Army of the true God race.

They glanced at the huge true God body and were full of confidence in this battle.

“Senior!”

The eight universe knights of the ancient sea race flew over and called out respectfully.

“From now on, all you have to do is follow the orders. This time, completely destroy the Dragon Palace!”

A golden light enveloped them and pulled them into the palace.

At this moment, 22 universe Knight Level 6 warriors were sitting on the left and right of the palace. The two elders of the Zheng God race were looking at them solemnly.

“It’s senior, we naturally believe in the strength of the Zheng God Race!”

The eight ancient sea race members immediately replied.

“Seniors, the Dragon Palace of the Dragon God lineage has a terrifying defense, if they hide inside, then we…”

The ancient sea race leader hesitated for a moment and said. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“There’s always a way, I really don’t believe that we can’t break through that Dragon Palace, HMPH!”

The two ancestors of the true God race said coldly.

This time, they would do everything they could to break the Dragon Palace.

“Yes, with the righteous God race and our ancient sea race, we don’t believe that we can’t break the Dragon Palace!”

An elder of the Ancient Sea Race clenched his fist and roared in a low voice.

“Okay!”

The two elders of the righteous god race waved their hands coldly and said, “Go and prepare. The Eternal Dragon Palace won’t stop this time.”

“Yes!”

The eight people cupped their hands and returned to the Space Hum Beast.

The two forces flew quickly.

According to their flying speed, it would take them one month to reach the Dragon Palace.

However, they were not in a hurry. The Dragon Palace would not be able to escape.

They would destroy the Dragon Palace even if they had to flee to the ends of the Earth.

This time, the righteous God race was prepared to fight a protracted war. They could afford to waste hundreds of millions of years.

Time passed day by day. The news about the righteous god race, the Ancient Sea Race, was being updated every day.

One month was a lot of time.

The two races had also entered the starry sky of the galaxy. They were getting closer and closer to the Dragon Palace.

At this moment, Wang Xian was sitting in front of the Dragon Palace. There was a table placed in front of him.

A Bowl of tea was brewing on it.

“I’m finally here. It must have been tough for me to travel such a long distance!”

Wang Xian looked into the void and felt the immense power. A smile appeared on his face.

He was getting anxious from waiting.
