Chapter 3873: In 38.72 million years, little blue had broken through!

Translator: 549690339

The construction of the space city was extremely fast.

The entire Space Beast’s area was comparable to the size of ten stars!

Such an area, to the entire 9-origin universe, wasn’t very big.

In the future, when entering the city, the Divine Tiger clan, Black Tortoise clan, and Divine Dragon clan all had to enter in human form.

This was because the size of ten stars might seem very big, but it must be known that the thirteen peak races of this space behemoth allowed the powerful disciples of other high-level races to enter!

This was also a benefit to the powerful disciples of the high-level races!

The Space Behemoth was secretly built and it took several decades!

This speed could be said to be very fast!

The main reason was that the star beasts were built in the world passage, and there were wizards who were rulers of rank 8 and rank 9.

Of course, the formations they set up could only be controlled by a ruler of rank 7

They could set up a ruler of rank 9, but once they set it up, it would be useless if they couldn’t activate it.

But comparatively speaking, a level 9 ruler array formation was much stronger than a level 7 ruler array formation.

Just the power of the array formation was enough to resist three or four level 9 gods.

Adding in the power of other treasures, this vast starry city would be terrifying!

After the construction of the vast starry city was completed, it immediately headed into the starry universe.

At the same time, this news was transmitted to every great being disciple in the 9-origin universe.

When they received this news, all of their faces were filled with shock.

“Holy Sh * t, are you serious? A Space City built by 13 pinnacle races, this? ? ?

We can enter as we please?”

“Isn’t this too majestic and powerful? This space city was built to deal with the belief universe?”

“Hahaha, that’s great. In the future, when we enter this space city, it can be said to be 100% safe. This is a space city built by 13 peak races! ”

“The space city is still secondary. This time, the 12 peak races have joined hands to form a powerful battle team, preparing to fight against the belief universe! ”

“The first time our space universe won against the belief universe. Although we failed the last time, our counterattack has already begun this time. We will definitely succeed! ”

“That’s right. Eh, why didn’t the Dragon Palace participate?”

“I don’t know. Maybe the Dragon Palace is still a little weak. There is still a huge gap in top-tier combat power. ”

On the communication stone plate, countless great beings ‘disciples were discussing excitedly.

Not long ago, the nine-origin universe suffered a great defeat.

The precious lands belonging to the Great Beings ‘disciples of the nine-origin universe suffered attacks from the great beings of the belief universe.

A large number of great beings of the 9-origin universe had died tragically.

Although the great beings of the high-level races had suffered fewer attacks, they had always been terrified.

Now that they had this space city, they also had a safe place to rest.

And now, the counterattack of the Great Beings of the pinnacle races of the 9-origin universe had begun!

It didn’t take long for a large number of great beings ‘disciples to enter the Space City.

When they entered the city, their faces were filled with shock.

The Great Beings ‘disciples from the 9-origin universe had a safe place, and the counterattack of the 12 pinnacle races had begun.

The 12 pinnacle races joined hands to form a total of five battle teams to hunt

down the army of the belief universe.

It was impossible for the 10 or so armies of the belief universe to all gather

together. At the beginning, the five battle teams had achieved some results.

However, this effect was not very great.

After all, the Great Beings sent by the belief universe this time were too terrifying!

The Pinnacle Races of the 9-origin universe also understood that the power of the belief universe was too terrifying!

Therefore, they only needed to waste time with it.

It was a waste of time for the 10 or so legions of the belief universe to waste time with them.

If they withdrew a portion of the legions, the 9-origin universe could also counterattack!

The belief universe also understood this problem. After learning that the 9-source universe had built a huge city, they wanted to attack the huge city.

However, they didn’t have 100% confidence.

Therefore, they didn’t take action for the time being.

The war was at a stalemate again.

The 5 battle teams of the 9-source universe were fighting a guerilla war with the army of the belief universe.

Although the belief universe was strong, they didn’t dare to attack the 9-source universe’s huge city.

After all, if the nine-origin universe took out a treasure of the level of the Tianyuan destiny fragment, the belief universe might suffer heavy losses.

Time passed quickly in this stalemate.

Wang Xian was in that domain. Halfway through, he sensed a large amount of information about the experts of the belief universe. He left immediately and was not found!

More than ten million years passed quickly.

On this day, Wang Xian finally received some good news. When he received this news, he could not help but smile!

Xiao Lan had a breakthrough!

Xiao Lan’s breakthrough brought with it the power of feedback. It allowed Lan Qingyue to achieve a breakthrough.

The seventh level of the Universe Dominator!

Although Xiao Zhai and Xiao Bai had yet to achieve a breakthrough, Xiao Lan’s breakthrough was already sufficient!

“I’ve finally achieved a breakthrough. After the breakthrough, I can have a good fight with the gods who believe in the universe. I can even destroy all of them!”

Wang Xian’s eyes shone with excitement.

The power of the galactic fragment was at most comparable to the peak of the ruler realm.

Now that Xiao Lan and Lan Qingyue had achieved a breakthrough, the power of the two peak of the ruler realm was sufficient to defeat them and even destroy them!

Wang Xian immediately contacted an lie and ordered him to bring Lan Qingyue and the rest over!

A few minutes later, Xiao Lan and Lan Qingyue appeared beside Wang Xian.

“Xiao Xian! ”

Lan Qingyue looked at Wang Xian with a smile on her face!

Wang Xian smiled at her and nodded his head heavily. “Let’s find the gods in the starry universe first. Once we find them, we will attack and destroy them completely. ”

“Alright! ”

Lan qingyue nodded her head. “With Xiao Lan’s strength, she is able to fight against the fragment of the Starfield. I can easily kill the other gods as well. If I join forces with Xiao Lan, we will be able to defeat them.”

“Alright, that’s Enough! ”

Wang Xian nodded his head.

He let Xiao Lan and the rest hide for now. Wang Xian released his dragon might and flew forward.

If he were to search here wantonly, it wouldn’t be long before he would meet the group of gods who believed in the universe.

Just as Xiao Lan made a breakthrough and Wang Xian was about to make a move on the gods in the universe of belief, the army in the universe of belief and the universe of stars also carried out a plan!

The universe of belief was about to launch another attack on the nine-origin universe!
