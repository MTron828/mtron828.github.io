Chapter 1387: 1387 dragon and Phoenix dynasty’s reputation

“Eldest sister, second brother, I don’t want you to meddle in my affairs!”

When she heard her eldest sister and second brother berating her, her expression turned cold.

In the past, because she was afraid that her parents would stop her, her eldest sister and second brother often berated her not to get close to Duan Jinming.

But now, when she found out that Duan Jinming’s strength had reached the first level of the insightful void tier and that he was going to go to her house in a few days to propose a betrothal gift, she was incomparably happy.

With his current status, he was completely worthy of her!

This also gave her a lot more confidence to fight back.

“What’s going on?”

At that moment, a young man dressed in aqua blue walked over and asked with an expressionless face.

She glanced at the young man, pursed her lips, and did not speak.

“Young master Liu, it’s nothing. It’s just that this little sister of mine has a problem with her brain!”

Upon hearing her words, the eldest sister and second brother of gilded speech also revealed an angry expression.

Upon hearing the young man’s question, they hurriedly said with an embarrassed expression.

“Look at that lowly brat. Look at young master Liu. Although Young Master Liu doesn’t fancy you, even if you become young master Liu’s concubine, it’s still better than being with that lowly brat. Moreover, your parents won’t...”

“Big Sister and second brother, shut up. Jin Ming isn’t a lowly Brat!”

As the two continued to speak, gilded gold Yan interrupted them angrily.

“Let me tell you, I’m not a lowly brat. Watch your words!”

When Duan Jin Ming heard the two of them talking about him like that and saw gilded gold Yan’s aggrieved look, he stood up and said angrily.

“You...”

Jin Jin Yan’s eldest sister and second brother saw that Duan Jinming was staring at them with a cold and disdainful look.

The water-blue youth raised his eyebrows and a faint coldness flashed across his eyes.

He looked at Jin Jin Yan and then at Duan Jinming.

These few days, his mother had been blowing wind in his ear and asking how the third daughter of the Jin Jin family was doing!

He had a pretty good impression of Gilded Gold Yan, but he knew what his mother wanted. She wanted him to get married and have children.

He hadn’t had enough fun yet, so he naturally didn’t agree.

Now that he saw that Gilded Gold Yan had a deep relationship with a lowly demonic beast, he was slightly displeased!

“I didn’t expect Gilded Gold Yan to behave so atrociously. You Don’t know what’s Going On with a lowly demonic beast, Hehe!”

Liu Shao’s eyes were cold as he mocked.

“You are the one who is rude. I’m warning you, watch your words!”

When Duan Jinming heard that Liu Shao dared to say that he was rude to a lowly demonic beast, he glared at him angrily.

“A lowly demonic beast, you are the one who should watch your words!”

Liu Shao saw Duan Jinming, who was two meters tall, staring at him angrily with his eyes wide open. His face turned cold and a trace of killing intent was emitted without any concealment.

“If you say that I am a lowly demonic beast, then who do you think you are!”

Duan Jinming’s body instantly emitted a profound void level pressure, and a powerful aura directly charged toward young master Liu.

“What?”

The profound void level aura charged over!

Young Master Liu’s face instantly changed, and he stared at Duan Jinming with a face full of fear. Under his aura, his body slightly trembled.

“What? How is this possible?”

“This aura, an insightful emptiness realm expert!”

Liu Jinyan’s eldest sister and second brother were also shocked, and they stared at Duan Jinming in disbelief.

Duan Jinming had the strength of the first level of the insightful emptiness realm. Only his parents and a clansman knew about it, but the two of them did not know.

Looking at the terrifying aura that Duan Jinming suddenly erupted with, the two of them had faces full of disbelief.

This lowly race, this lowly fellow, how could he be an expert at the profound void tier?

Duan Jinming’s age was about the same as theirs, but now he had actually reached the profound void tier. He was simply a monster!

Entering the profound void tier meant entering the ranks of experts!

He was an expert that stood high above!

“First level of the profound void tier, you’re actually at the first level of the profound void tier. However, don’t think that you can be arrogant just because you’re an expert at the profound void tier. My Liu family, killing an expert at the first level of the profound void tier is a piece of cake!”

Liu Shao growled in a low voice with an extremely embarrassed expression.

“Do you believe that I can easily destroy your Liu Family?”

Wang Xian, who had been watching from the side, narrowed his eyes slightly when he heard Liu Shao’s words. He took a step forward and said indifferently!

Who Didn’t have a force? Duan Jinming had the entire dragon palace behind him.

“King!”

When Duan Jinming heard Wang Xian’s words, he immediately turned his head and shouted respectfully and gratefully.

“Annihilate my Liu family. Hehe, this is the first time I’ve heard of someone daring to annihilate my Liu family, Kid...”

“Young master, you annihilated the Liu family with just a single word. Do you really think that your dragon and Phoenix Empire is invincible? We belong to Xiaoyao City. Your Dragon and Phoenix Empire is nothing in front of the mayor of Xiaoyao City!”

At this moment, when Liu Shao heard Wang Xian’s words, he was interrupted by Yao Dingfeng who was standing beside him before he could even speak!

“The Dragon and Phoenix Empire!”

Liu Shao was slightly stunned when he heard his good brother’s words. He was shocked as he stared at Wang Xian.

Yesterday, they heard Yao Dingfeng and the rest talking about the dragon and Phoenix Empire. They knew a little about the power of this empire.

To destroy four empires at the same time, this empire had at least five experts at the fourth level of the Void Interpretation Stage!

Within a radius of 100,000 kilometers, it was definitely the strongest empire!

This empire was not something the Liu family could fight against.

His face was gloomy and his eyes were filled with astonishment.

“Hehe, Duan Jinming is my brother and my subordinate. If you dare to attack him, I dare to attack you!”

Wang Xian looked at them and said proudly.

“You... are arrogant. This is Xiaoyao City, not your dragon and Phoenix Empire!”

Liu Shao gritted his teeth in embarrassment when he heard his words.

“I have to say, this brother is really arrogant!”

Yao Dingfeng looked at Wang Xian coldly from the side and looked at Liu Shao. “Shaohua, let’s Go!”

Liu Shao glanced at Wang Xian, Duan Jinming, and the rest in a shady manner. He didn’t say anything else and turned around to walk inside.

A person who was even more powerful than them would only make them feel even more humiliated here!

“Gilded speech, you... you...”

The two eldest and second brothers of gilded speech wanted to scold her. However, when they felt Duan Jinming’s furious gaze and Wang Xian’s indifferent expression, they didn’t dare to say anything in the end.

The Dragon and Phoenix Empire was a newly rising and powerful empire. Their strength was many times stronger than the Liu clan.

A powerful empire that controlled more than sixty cities.

Even Duan Jinming was an expert at the first level of the profound void tier. He was not someone they could berate casually!

They clenched their fists and angrily turned around to chase after young master Liu and the others.

“Jinming, I... I’ll go over too. After all, they are my older brothers and sisters. I’ll explain it to them. Don’t be angry!”

Seeing Young Master Liu and the others leave in anger, Gilded Jinyan also knew that he had caused trouble, so he said to Duan Jinming.

“Yes, third miss, you can go. In a few days, we will go to your house to propose marriage!” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Duan Jinming promised.

This caused a smile to appear on gilded Jinyan’s face. He nodded his head at him and left with a smile.

“That’s right. A man should have the manliness of a man. Don’t be afraid. I’m here for Everything!”

Wang Xian saw Duan Jinming’s behavior and patted his shoulder. He smiled and said.

“Thank you, Dragon King. Sorry for the trouble!”

Duan Jinming grinned and said with a smile.

“Let’s go in!”

Wang Xian shook his head and walked straight in.

“This... a kid from the fire hammer clan has actually reached the insightful emptiness realm. How is this possible!”

“And that young man. He is actually from the Dragon and Phoenix Empire. Oh My God, this newly-risen dragon and Phoenix Empire is extremely powerful!”

At the rear, the clan that had mocked the fire hammer clan widened their eyes, their eyes filled with fear!
