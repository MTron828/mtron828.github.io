Chapter 2976: Becoming a Dragon Knight in 1976? 2

“Those are the powerhouses from the center of the Universe? Those two lords with vertical eyes, are they the powerhouses from the center of the Universe?”

“They must be, there aren’t such noble existences in our resplendent starry skies, they must be the powerhouses from the center of the universe, we’re saved now, we finally don’t have to hide in this small place anymore?”

“I can feel a powerful pressure from those two lords. Three Eyes? What Sacred Race Is This?”

“If the two lords are willing to help us, we can leave this place. Destroy the Dragon Palace, destroy the Dragon King, kill them, kill them!”

“Destroy the Dragon Palace, kill them all!”

In the place where all the experts and disciples of the eight barrens were hiding, when they saw the two three-eyed race enter their desolate divine empire, their faces were filled with excitement.

In the past few years, in order to avoid the pursuit of the Dragon Palace, they could only stay in this small space.

In order to leave this place and take revenge, their experts and disciples took a huge risk and lost hundreds of thousands of people. Now, they finally contacted the experts at the center of the universe.

If the two experts were willing to help them, it would be a great fortune for them.

Revenge!

Return to the resplendent starry sky!

Destroy the Dragon Palace!

There was hope for everything!

“This is?”

However, at the same time, in the divine kingdom of the desolate divine emperor, a group of divine emperors stood respectfully in the center of a palace.

Yang Feng and Yang Xiaohun sat in front of them with documents and a computer in their hands.

These documents were all about the Dragon Palace.

From the rise of the Dragon Palace to its dominance in the starry sky.

Looking at the information on them, they were shocked and looked at each other. They could see the craziness and passion in each other’s eyes.

They looked at the pictures of the Divine Dragon of the Dragon Palace on the AI and took a deep breath.

“The Dragon Palace has reached this level in less than ten years. The Dragon King must have obtained the Dragon God’s inheritance, and this inheritance might not be simple!”

“Brother Yang, the pictures of the nine dragon gods are similar to the wind god Dragons in the records. They are similar to the purebred wind god Dragons!”

“The Dragon God’s inheritance is most likely a purebred wind god Dragon. We are going to be rich. It’s a great opportunity!”

Yang Feng and Yang Xiao Hun couldn’t help but Roar in their hearts as they communicated through voice transmission.

If all the information was true, then the Dragon Palace would definitely have obtained a huge opportunity. Even the strongest of the nine great divine dragon clans in the universe didn’t have such a terrifying development speed.

If they could seize the opportunity of the Dragon Palace, then they…

The two looked at each other one last time, full of determination.

“We can help you solve your problem. Leave the Dragon Palace to us!”

Yang Feng slightly narrowed his eyes and suppressed the excitement in his heart as he said to the desolate divine emperor Lord and the others.

“Sir… Sir is willing to help us?”

The desolate divine emperor and the others revealed extremely excited expressions when they heard the two’s words.

“We are interested in the Dragon Palace and the Divine Dragon!”

The two of them said faintly.

“Thank you, Sirs. Thank you, Sirs. With your strength, you will definitely be able to easily sweep through the entire Dragon Palace and destroy the Dragon King.”

The group of divine emperors quickly knelt down and said excitedly.

“It’s a small matter. It’s very easy to destroy a Dragon King and a divine dragon with a strength of around level three divine emperor.”

Yang Feng slowly stood up and said proudly.

Although they were only the deacons of the weakest race in the center of the universe, with their strength of a divine emperor level five and a divine emperor level four, it was not a big problem for them to subdue all the Divine Dragons in the Dragon Palace.

Even in their opinion, the speed of the rise of the Dragon Palace was also very heaven-defying.

However, it was still too immature.

Furthermore, they were a race that lived in the center of the universe. Even if they were weak, they could not be compared to this remote place.

“Let’s set off now. You guys lead the way!”

The two of them could not help but say.

“Yes, Sir!”

The God emperors nodded excitedly.

They moved and flew out immediately.

“All Godly monarchs above rank three follow us to destroy the Dragon Palace!”

“Disciples, wait for the Good News!”

One of the godly monarchs shouted excitedly as he flew out of the Divine Kingdom.

His voice reached the ears of all the disciples.

“Destroy the Dragon Palace?”

“Hahaha, that’s great! Destroy the Dragon Palace and kill the Dragon King!”

Hearing the news, everyone was extremely excited and cheered.

Finally, they could get out of Here!

“Lord God Emperor!”

The experts above the third rank of the god King Realm flew over.

There were more than a million eight desolation god King experts, and there were about 500,000 of them above the third rank of the god King Realm. Some of them had died in the past few years, and there were still 300,000 left.

The eyes of the 300,000 divine kings were filled with killing intent. They immediately flew behind the divine emperors.

Yang Feng and Yang Xiaohun swept past them without saying anything.

In their three-eyed race, the Divine Kings’disciples were also the main combat members.

“Let’s Go, Sirs!” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

The Emperor Lord and the others said respectfully.

“En!”

The two of them nodded. The desolate divine emperor waved his arm and directly controlled his divine kingdom, carrying everyone out.

After passing through many strange and special terrains, they soon appeared at the periphery of the eight desolate six directions.

Yang Feng and Yang Xiaohun looked at the starry sky in front of them, their hearts filled with anticipation and excitement.

The opportunity was in front of them!

The Divine Dragon was in front of them!

However, not far away from them, a group of people also flew over.

There were also quite a number of people, more than 10,000 of them.

However, the aura emitted by these 10,000 people was not something that the experts of the eight desolates could compare to.

These 10,000 people all had four arms, except for the metal-like person in the middle.

The four-armed old man in the lead stared at the surrounding void with excitement.

“Hahaha, I didn’t expect that fifth deacon would have such an opportunity.”

A middle-aged man next to the four-armed old man stared at his surroundings and shouted excitedly.

A cold aura was emitted from his surroundings.

“Hehe, I didn’t expect that we would get such an opportunity when we brought our disciples here to train. The heavens are helping our four-armed race.”

“Creator, lead the way. After we help you destroy the Dragon Palace, our four-armed race will provide you with a lot of metal and technological knowledge!”

The four-armed old man said to the robot beside him.

The robot was the creator.
