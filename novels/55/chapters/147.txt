Hahaha, hahaha!

Suddenly, Vice Sect Leader Lei laughed raucously.

Without any premonition, his laughter resounded within the entire training field.

His laughter was just like that of a maniac or retarded person.

However, Vice Sect Leader Lei wasn’t bothered.

“Heaven is blessing our Thistles and Thorns Sect! Heaven is blessing our Thistles and Thorns Sect!” Vice Sect Leader Lei roared out in agitation.

“She really is! Inborn Constitution!”

The surrounding Elders’ eyes popped open and they were thrilled.

Inborn Constitution! Inborn Constitution! They knew clearly what this would mean.

This would mean that within five years, Thistles and Thorns Sect would have an Inborn expert as they advanced and became a first-class sect.

They would also become the strongest existence in the Southern Province.

For the entire Thistles and Thorns Sect, this was a blessing from the heavens. One could easily say that they were favored by the heavens.

“What just happened? Why would Vice Sect Leader Lei be so agitated?”

“That juvenile girl must have some incredible talents. Otherwise, Vice Sect Leader Lei wouldn’t lose his composure.”

“Inborn Constitution? Could it be a horrifyingly strong existence?”

The surrounding crowd was dumbfounded to see the maniac Vice Sect Leader Lei and agitated Elders.

“Inborn Constitution!”

Where the Song Family was, they understood Ancient Martial Arts a lot more than ordinary people because of Elder Song.

When they heard those words, everyone was shocked!

Song Aowen sank into a daze as he looked at the juvenile girl on the platform as though he was retarded.

As compared to the Inborn Constitution, his high-class talents could be considered as trash!

“Inborn Constitution really exists in the world.”

A few members of the Song Family were still in a daze. Inborn Constitution had been circulated as part of mythology. It had been a few hundred years since there was a human with Inborn Constitution.

“Master, is Inborn Constitution incredible?” Seeing the thrilled looks of the Elders and the Vice Sect Leader, Xiao Yu asked her master this curiosly. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Inborn Constitution! Xiao Yu, you might not know what this truly means!”

Elder Fang helped to comb Xiao Yu’s hair as she explained, “This would mean that you could reach the Inborn Realm quickly and become an expert stronger than even your Master and our Sect Leader!”

“So incredible?” Xiao Yu’s eyes popped open and her mouth opened slightly in awe.

“We can’t let others know about the Inborn Constitution.”

At this moment, Vice Sect Leader Lei turned solemn. He knew that he had been too agitated a while ago and had not controlled his emotions. As a result, everyone knew about it.

“We can’t let other sects know about this. Otherwise, we would attract lots of trouble!” Elder Song also added solemnly.

Vice Sect Leader Lei put on a stern face, turned around, looked at the crowd and announced, “Those who wish to join our Thistles and Thorns Sect today will be enrolled. Besides this, with regard to the Inborn Constitution, everyone has to forget about it and not mention it to others. Otherwise, kill!!”

Vice Sect Leader Lei’s stern voice reached the ears of everyone and everyone could sense the killing intent within it.

The surrounding crowd was shocked.

As for those juveniles who had been eliminated in the assessment, they were thrilled.

Thistles and Thorns Sect had allowed them to join because of her!

“It’s all because of that girl... that Thistles and Thorns Sect enrolled everyone.”

Some people felt it was unreal in thinking that the Thistles and Thorns Sect would be wasting their resources to groom those without talents because of this juvenile girl.

However, the families of these juveniles knew why Thistles and Thorns Sect would do so.

It was to silence them and prevent them from leaking information about Inborn Constitution.

Now that their kids had joined Thistles and Thorns Sect, they would enjoy both the fame or obscurity that would come with it in the future. Once Thistles and Thorns Sect got into trouble, their kids would too.

Besides that, Thistles and Thorns Sect probably had another intention in mind. That was if you dared to leak anything, your kid would be dead.

Although the actions of Thistles and Thorns Sect had the intention of threats, no one was opposed to it. Instead, they were thrilled.

They did not know how incredible Inborn Constitution was but they did hear Vice Sect Leader Lei commenting that the Heavens were blessing Thistles and Thorns Sect.

Inborn Constitution must be an incredibly horrifying existence to make the Vice Sect Leader of Thistles and Thorns Sect lose his composure.

Thistles and Thorns Sect would likely get stronger and stronger in the future.

In that case, their kids would also do better in the future.

“Thank you, Vice Sect Leader Lei. We don’t know anything that happened tonight. Even if others are to place a knife by our necks, we would not speak a word about today.”

“That’s right. We would die before we said anything about what happened today!”

Members of each family gave their promises one after another regarding not speaking of what had happened.

“Great, great!”

Vice Sect Leader Lei nodded his head in satisfaction. He turned to the other Elder and instructed, “Inform the Sect Leader right away and ask him to get here as soon as possible!”

“Yes!”

That Elder nodded his head immediately.

Under normal circumstances, they naturally wouldn’t request the Sect Leader to come over immediately. However, the Sect Leader had to rush over immediately this time.

Vice Sect Leader Lei stared at Xiao Yu intensely before heaving out a long sigh. With a friendly smile, she asked, “Is your name Xiao Yu? Hmm. Our Sect Leader will be here in a while. We will be letting the Sect Leader guide your cultivation in the future. Our Sect Leader is a half-step to inborn expert and we would provide you with the best resources. What do you think?”

Seeing how Vice Sect Leader Lei reacted, Xiao Yu pulled back. She felt a little like a big grey wolf asking a little rabbit to open the door.

Elder Fang wasn’t looking pleased. She knew what Vice Sect Leader Lei meant by asking Xiao Yu to go under the wing of the Sect Leader and providing her with the best resources.

Although she wasn’t comfortable, she did not speak a word. Xiao Yu had an Inborn Constitution after all.

If Xiao Yu announced she had an Inborn Constitution, even the Sacred Sects would fight over her.

She’s not qualified to become the master of Xiao Yu.

“Master!” Xiao Yu lifted her head and pulled Elder Fang’s arm.

Elder Fang had a bitter look. “Xiao Yu, I’m not qualified to become your master. Let our Sect Leader guide you!”

“Master, I have already seen you as my master. Moreover, it is you who brought me here. My brother also agrees to you being my master,” Xiao Yu looked at Elder Fang and said.

“Xiao Yu, your master would be our Sect Leader. He’s the strongest in our Sect. Elder Fang is not qualified to guide you.”

Elder Zhou glanced at Elder Fang in envy before saying this to Xiao Yu with a smile.

She called Xiao Yu a jynx previously but didn’t dare to do so now. Instead, she couldn’t wait to get on the good books of this future Inborn expert.

“This...” Xiao Yu looked at her master, feeling indecisive.

She had already taken Elder Fang as her master from the bottom of her heart. However, Elder Fang had also wanted the Sect Leader to guide her. This made her feel a little indecisive.

The crowd below the platform saw what had happened and almost fainted.

What the... Vice Sect Leader wants the Sect Leader to be your master and yet you are hesitating?

How infuriating!
