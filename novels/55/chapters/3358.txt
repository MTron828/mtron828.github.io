Support Elf: not yet born

When the green fruit was hanging on the main trunk of the ancestral tree, a message was transmitted to Wang Xian’s mind.

When he saw this message, he was slightly stunned.

“Elf, this fruit is actually an elf?”

His mouth was slightly agape and his face was filled with astonishment.

The Elf race was one of the top races in the universe. The ancient Lake, Moon Bay, was a treasure belonging to the elf race.

Compared to the ancient Lake Moon Bay, the Elves were undoubtedly a precious treasure.

There were two kinds of elves. One was born with maternal instinct, and the other was born with the tree of life.

Compared to maternal instinct, the elves born with the tree of life were nobles among the elves.

The Tree of life was an innate treasure belonging to the elves. It was said to be the treasure closest to the heavenly creation level.

The Tree of life of the elf race could not only give birth to powerful elves, but also had other mystical abilities. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

According to the records of the Dragon Palace, there was one among the few existences that were above the masters in the universe.

That person was the Heaven’s origin creation of the wood life, one of the strongest beings in the universe.

The elf race had cultivated the wood attribute to the peak.

What surprised Wang Xian was that he actually obtained a support elf.

Elves had both combat and support. There were very few support elites. Usually, only the royal family of the Elves had them.

Ordinary divine trees could not give birth to elves, but the ancestral tree was different.

Moreover, the potential of the elves nurtured by the ancestral tree was even stronger than the elites nurtured by the tree of life.

It was even more magical.

“The support elves are also known as the companion elves. Every support elf possesses powerful abilities. I wonder how strong they will be.”

Wang Xian mumbled.

Thump! Thump! Thump

At this moment, he felt his heart trembling. He felt something and some blood flowed into the ancestral tree.

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered as he looked at it. A smile appeared on his face.

After looking at it for a while, he looked at the other treasures.

There were many kinds of acquired spiritual treasures and many acquired Supreme Treasures.

Wang Xian placed the Tai Chi Dragon Plate on two acquired Supreme Treasures of darkness attribute for them to absorb.

He checked once and did not find any treasures in his eyes.

In the Dragon Palace, the rest of the disciples of the Dragon Palace were improving their strength in the dragon transformation pool.

The Devouring Dragon was devouring a large amount of metal.

The various battleships and spaceships of the steel union were able to improve significantly after being devoured by the devouring dragon.

This time around, Wang Xian was prepared to settle down at the edge of the heaven-opening primal continent.

At the very least, he had to understand the heaven-opening primal continent better before proceeding with the development.

Time passed day by day. This time, it took two months for all the members of the Dragon Palace to upgrade.

Two months later, the last batch of disciples had completed the upgrade.

Since then, over 1.9 million members of the Dragon Palace all had the combat strength of a universe knight.

Apart from Wang Xian, ao Xie, and the other five universe knights who had the combat strength of level 9,.

Xiao Lan, the other three, and the two devouring dragons had also advanced to level 9.

The rest of the leaders and the group of pure-bred dragons had the combat strength of Level 8 universe knights.

The number of Level 9 universe knights in the Dragon Palace had reached 10.

Two months later, the Five Elements Millstone underwent a transformation, and its strength rose by another level.

After all the members of the Dragon Palace Rose, Prime Minister Turtle ordered a group of civil officials to teach the members of the dragon palace all sorts of knowledge.

During this period, every day, other races from the heaven opening primal continent would come to visit the Dragon Palace and give them valuable treasures.

There were even a few races that weren’t weak, and they took out many treasures and bought the steel union, the wrapped corpse clan, and the grotto-heaven they occupied from the Dragon Palace.

These resources allowed the Dragon Palace to add two universe Knight Level 9 powerhouses.

Other grotto-heaven blessed lands aside, the steel union’s grotto-heaven blessed land was definitely a very powerful existence.

This was a pleasant surprise to the Dragon Palace.

Five years passed very quickly. During these five years, Wang Xian stayed in the Dragon Palace and played with a group of girls. He didn’t find it boring.

“Xiao Xian, look, the elf is about to be born!”

On this day, Hu Yan ‘er’s voice was heard.

“Huh?”

Wang Xian, who was in front of the Dragon Palace, was slightly stunned. His figure instantly arrived at the Dragon King’s Palace.

It had been five years since he obtained the support elf on the ancestral tree.

During these five years, he would occasionally suck some of Wang Xian’s dragon blood. From the shape of a fruit, he slowly transformed into a human shape.

However, the size of the support elf did not change at all. It was still only the size of two fists.

The female Elf had a fiery red dress and a purple hat on her head.

She was holding a gray branch in her hand. On the head of the branch, there was the flame of a fire Phoenix. It looked a little mystical.

In addition, she had wings made of leaves. She looked very cute.

However, today, the little elf opened her eyes and looked around curiously.

“Daddy!”

When she saw Wang Xian, her eyes lit up.

Crack! Crack

The part of the ancestral tree that was connected to the back was broken. She flapped her wings and flew toward Wang Xian immediately.

“Huh?”

Wang Xian smiled when he saw the palm-sized elf calling him Daddy.

“How cute. I’ll Call You Wang Lingling from now on!”

Wang Xian looked at her and reached out his palm to let her land on it. He said with a smile on his face.

“Sure, sure!”

Wang Lingling waved the magic wand in her hand.

“Wow, she’s so cute. Come, let mommy take a look!”

The girls who were attracted came over with shining eyes.

“Hehehe, Daddy, why do I have so many moms?”

Wang Lingling smiled and looked at the girls around her and asked in confusion.

“Because your father is a scumbag.”

Guan Shuqing and the others said with a smile.

“What is a Scumbag?”

Wang Lingling continued to ask curiously.

“Come here, Mommy will explain it to you!”

The group of girls stretched out their palms, their faces filled with love.

The group of girls was no longer young considering their age on Earth. They also wanted to have a child.

However, if the Dragon God wanted to have a child, it would require a long period of time.

Moreover, the purer the bloodline of both parents, the stronger the Dragon God would be.

After hesitating for a while, they still did not want to have a child for the time being.

Now that they saw such a cute little elf, the girls treated her like a child too.

“Initiation education is very important. You Can’t teach her like that!”

Wang Xian was at the side and said to them with a speechless expression.
