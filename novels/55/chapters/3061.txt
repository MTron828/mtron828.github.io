Chapter 3062: 3061 new disciple of the willow deity Daoist sect

“Brother Wang Xian, I’m going to participate in the entrance assessment of the Willow deity Daoist sect.”

Time passed day by day. Mi Xin Lu sent him a message and told him.

“Oh?”

After Wang Xian saw this message, he raised his eyebrows and said, “Strive to enter the Willow deity Daoist sect. Don’t follow me for the time being. I still have some matters to settle. For cultivation, I will first communicate with the other people of the willow deity Daoist sect.”

“When you enter the willow deity Daoist sect, don’t join any other races. When you choose the venerable Willow Deity’s treasure, choose the fallen leaves to return to.”

During the ambush last time, Wang Xian guessed that the other party might have locked onto the Mi Xin deer. Therefore, he didn’t bring the Mi Xin deer along for the time being before he destroyed the ice mountain race.

Moreover, as long as he joined the willow deity Daoist sect, the safety would increase by a lot.

“Alright, Brother Wang.”

When Mi Xinlu received Wang Xian’s reply, she nodded her head.

She looked outside and flew over.

At the same time, Wang Xian hesitated for a moment before he walked out of the room and flew towards the exit of the Willow deity Daoist sect.

At the lower part of the exit, there were a few hundred disciples of the Willow deity Daoist sect standing at the front. They were either hugging their arms or sitting there, looking at the front with a smile.

There were also quite a number of people gathered together to chat.

At the front of the Divine Willow Daoist sect, there were a total of 50 to 60 million middle-aged youths standing at the front. Their eyes were filled with anxiety.

Around them, there were also countless experts floating. The battleships, spaceships, and floating islands of the elementary and domain-level races in the universe were emitting a towering aura.

If one wanted to join the willow deity Daoist sect, the minimum requirement was to have the strength of a celestial thearch. There was no age limit. In other words, the 50 to 60 million members in front of them were all celestial thearch experts.

Their strength ranged from the first level of celestial thearch to the eighth or ninth level of celestial thearch.

Wang Xian came to a spot at the side and leaned on a willow branch as he watched indifferently.

At this moment, in the middle of the Willow deity Daoist sect, the willow branches condensed into a blurry human figure. A green light enveloped the 50 to 60 million people in front of them.

When they saw this light, everyone looked slightly nervous.

The test had already begun.

“WHOOSH WHOOSH WHOOSH WHOOSH!”

Soon, about ten thousand people were directly enveloped by the green light and pulled to the front.

“WHOOSH WHOOSH WHOOSH!”

Thousands of willow branches condensed into a dark road and pulled these ten thousand people into the depths of the road and disappeared quickly.

“Sigh, they were eliminated again.”

“Only ten thousand people passed the first round of assessment?”

“Hahaha, there are more than ten people in our clan who passed the first round of assessment. Hopefully, one of them will be able to enter the willow deity Daoist sect in the end.”

A disappointed and excited voice came from the front.

Out of more than fifty to sixty million people, only ten thousand people passed the first round of assessment.

Some were happy while others were sad.

Wang Xian swept his gaze over and saw that Mo Xin Lu had passed the first round.

According to his evaluation of Mo Xin Lu, it should be easy for her to enter the Willow deity Daoist sect.

After all, after Wang Xian’s enhancement, her bloodline was considered to be extremely pure. In the future, it would be easy for her to cultivate to the level of a universe knight.

If she couldn’t enter such a place again, then it shouldn’t be so.

The area in front of him was noisy. Wang Xian swept his gaze across and some race names appeared in his mind.

There were more than ten primary races in the Milky Way. When he saw a race with a skeleton flag, he narrowed his eyes slightly.

The skeleton race was also the race that destroyed the Mohan clan.

Time passed by slowly. From time to time, there would be people shaking their heads as they came out from the path formed by the willow branches. Their faces were filled with disappointment.

More and more people came out. The people in front of the Divine Willow Daoist sect were not too surprised.

Last time, not a single person had entered the Divine Willow Daoist sect.

Two hours later, most of the people had come out.

And at this time, the path formed by the willow branches had disappeared. Six willow branches carried six people floating in the air.

“HM? This time, six people have passed the assessment?”

“Wow, there are so many people joining this time. There are six of them at once!”

The disciples of the Willow deity Daoist sect looked over and revealed astonished expressions.

“There are actually six people joining this time. It’s really rare.” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

At the front, everyone looked at the six people on the willow branches with envious expressions.

Wang Xian looked at a figure and revealed a faint smile.

At this moment, his universal AI trembled. When he saw the information on it, Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly and immediately flew out.

“Welcome, Junior Brothers and sisters, to the Willow Deity sect.”

When the six new disciples, Mi Xin Lu and the others, had chosen their treasures, they walked towards them.

There were more than five thousand people. This time, nearly half of the disciples of the Willow Deity sect had come.

“Ha ha, greetings to all of you. I Am Long Zaitian.”

Among the six people, a young man with a horn on his head and a long sword in his hand looked at the disciples of the Divine Willow Daoist sect in front of him. The corners of his mouth curled up slightly.

“Ha Ha Ha, young master long, Congratulations. I told you, with your talent, young master long, you will definitely be able to enter the Divine Willow Daoist sect.”

As soon as he finished speaking, more than twenty middle-aged elders from the Divine Willow Daoist sect stepped forward with a trace of respect on their faces.

“Eh?”

When the surrounding people heard their words, astonishment appeared on their faces.

“Long Zaitian, the dragon descendant’s Long Zaitian, that dragon descendant genius with a powerful bloodline. I heard that he erupted with powerful strength and was able to fight against those of a higher level.”

“It’s actually him. How did he join our Willow deity Daoist sect?”

When some people heard this name, astonishment appeared on their faces.

The primary race of the universe of dragon descendants was a relatively stronger race in the Milky Way.

Long Zaitian was the most important person in the current generation of the dragon descendants. His bloodline had returned to its ancestor, and he had the strength to fight against those of a higher level.

It was rumored that he could break through to the Universe Knight realm with 100% certainty.

“So it’s young master long Zaitian. Hello, Hello!”

Many disciples of the willow deity Daoist sect immediately cupped their hands in greeting, without the slightest bit of senior brother or senior sister’s stance.

Even they had to take the test for a race like this, even if the other party had just joined the willow deity Daoist sect.

“Everyone, today, our dragon race is treating. Yu Hai Tavern.”

The powerhouse from the Dragon Race said with a smile.

“Haha, Thank You Very Much, senior brothers.”

Everyone around them said with a loud laugh.

“Eh, junior sister, are you with Wang Xian? I didn’t expect you to enter the Willow deity Daoist sect as well.”

At this moment, someone at the side noticed that Mo Xinlu looked familiar and asked.

“Eh?”

Some of the disciples of the Willow deity Daoist sect looked at Mo Xinlu with doubt in their eyes.

“Yes, it was brother Wang who brought me here.”

Mo Xinlu nodded with a smile.

Upon hearing her agreement, some people’s eyes flickered as they looked at the figures of Bing Ling and Hong Tu.
