Chapter 623: Return of the Dragon King (4)

High and mighty!

This was the first time the Martial Artists of the Underworld had seen such a terrifying scene. It was also the first time they saw such scary power from the Nine Cauldrons’ Worlds.

The thousand-meter fire pillars, daunting oppression, and the devastating scene.

All the momentum and the oppression from it were not something Nie Wushuang and Emperor Qi could compare to.

The difference was huge!

“What? Oh no, they actually have such a formidable figure here!”

The gang, including Xiao Yu, Elder Fang. Lan Qingyue and Adjaya, who were desperately resisting, lost the color in their faces. Seeing such a domineering aura, a tinge of despair welled up in their eyes.

“Hmph!”

Both Nie Wushuang and Emperor Qi snorted as they swept their cold gazes across all the people in Dragon Sect before they walked back.

Boom!

The eyes of the four elders were like torches with sparks skipping in their eyes when they looked at the battlefield.

Two hundred Dragon Sect disciples against more than four hundred Inborn Experts from their side.

However, more than sixty Inborn Experts had perished within a short period of time, leaving the total number to be less than four hundred.

“Hmph!”

There was dissatisfaction in the eyes of an elder as he swung his arm, hurling a ball of fire toward the Dragon Sect disciples.

“Oh no, get out of the way now!”

Upon seeing the attack, Mo Qinglong’s eyes were burning with fire.

The ball of fire that the old man hurled with ease struck a hundred meters away. A flaming waterfall-like ball of fire charged toward them directly.

All the members of Dragon Sect had a drastic change in their expressions.

“Block it down!”

They roared, raising golden sword defense and daunting dragon claws in front of them.

Bam, Bam, Bam!

But still, that fiery magma exploded like a waterfall in an instant, killing dozens of Golden Swordfish right at the front.

Painful looks crawled upon their faces while their bodies slowly changed from human to golden swordfish, burning under the intense flame as they turned a charcoal black.

A casual hit from that old man had brought down these forces of the Dragon Sect.

Seeing more than a dozen Dragon Sect members lose their lives instantly, Mo Qinglong was aghast as he spun his head around. Noticing the gray branch was still giving off radiance on the floating island, he heaved a sigh of relief.

“Go on! Dragon King will be back to avenge us!”

Mo Qinglong growled with a hideous look. At this point, none of them could escape.

Perhaps the Golden Swordfish clan could jump into the ocean for a way out, but they would not run.

They were with the Dragon King of Dragon Sect!

“Kill!”

The Dragonians and Golden Swordfish clan went berserk.

Instantly, all their aura and vitality erupted completely, darting straight into the sky!

“Follow me. Charge!”

A Level 11 Dan Realm expert from the Golden Swordfish Clan remained expressionless. In the face of death, his eyes only held golden coldness.

Sorrowless, joyless, selfless, invincible.

“Golden Swordfish. Pierce!”

Piercing through with their bodies was their natural instinct as Golden Swordfish clan.

When they used to be fish, their most potent attack was to sprint.

Even though they had learned swordsmanship, their piercing move remained their most potent attack.

Piercing with their bodies!

Buzz!

One by one, the bodies of the Golden Swordfish suspended themselves in the air. As though they were in the ocean, they brought along their daunting radiance, charging at the three-hundred odd Inborn Experts right before them.

They knew that attacking the four elders was utterly useless. Hence, they could only attack those at the same level as them.

“Hmph, how dare you even try to strike before us!”

Seeing the Golden Swordfish clan readying their attacking stance, there was contempt in his eyes as he waved, calling, “Kharma Flame!”

Boom boom!

As soon as the old man’s voice resounded, the ground below the Golden Swordfish exploded into cracks. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Scary flames sprouted out from underground, erupting into a blazing fire.

“This is crazy. Are they the legendary Gods? Just a simple wave, and they could bring destruction to the world.”

“It’s not too far-fetched to say that they are the legendary immortals. Just a wave and they brought destruction to Heaven and Earth. With a swing, they could annihilate anything. They are the legendary Immortals!”

“I have a strange feeling about those four people. Sect Leader Nie Wushuang and Emperor Qi have been respectful to them. The newly established Eternal Sacred Sect is also led by the four of them. All the Sect Leaders of Sacred Sects have been very respectful to them!”

“Could it be that they are from the other worlds? After Sect Leader Nie Wushuang and Emperor Qi entered into another world, the four of them suddenly showed up beside them.”

All the surrounding crowd watched the four people with horror, as they discussed among themselves.

An arm swing could change the world, and that impact was so scary, as though it was from the legendary immortal.

In the face of these four elders, they felt as insignificant as ants.

“Ss, that bunch of Dragon Sect members is really fearless. They actually continued to charge forward.”

“Gosh, the members of Dragon Sect have gone mad. But soon, they will be annihilated!”

All the people were horrified as they looked ahead in shock.

Over there, more than hundreds of Dragon Sect members exuded golden radiance with a blazing fire, charging ahead ferociously.

Their speed was so terrifying that even the experts of their same level were not able to resist.

“Oh no!”

Those Inborn Experts who felt relieved and were ready for a show were aghast upon seeing the dauntless Dragon Sect members.

“Take cover!” they yelled loudly.

However, the Golden Swordfish were bent on giving up their lives. Even when their bodies were shrouded with Kharma Flame, their attacks did not stop.

“Hur?”

The four elders slightly grimaced when they saw the dauntless Golden Swordfish.

Argh!

All it took was one second for the Golden Swordfish to rush into the group of Inborn Experts.

Despairing shrieks were heard instantly.

“Courting your own doom!”

Upon seeing their men being killed, coldness took over the faces of Nie Wushuang and Emperor Qi as they wielded their longswords at the Golden Swordfish.

“Trying to attack?”

Adjaya saw the two of them launching their strikes as she raised her truncheon in her hand with an awful look. A vast lotus surfaced in front of her.

With a size of a few hundred meters, the lotus was hurled at Nie Wushuang and Emperor Qi.

“Tsk tsk, Level 13 Spiritual Equipment. Spiritual Equipment used by an Immortal!”

The four elders stared at her truncheon when Adjaya launched her attack. A glimmer of passion flashed across their eyes.

“A lass is ultimately a lass!” an elder scorned as he wielded the staff in his hand.

The lotus that Adjaya released shook violently in the air. Subsequently, it vanished just like a firework.

“What?”

Adjaya paled immediately. She staggered back while Xiao Yu quickly held onto her.

Bam, Bam, Bam!

In that instant, Nie Wushuang and Emperor Qi rushed into the Golden Swordfish.

The long killing blade and the icy fist came smashing through the bodies of the Golden Swordfish!
