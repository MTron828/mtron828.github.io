Chapter 1345: 1,345 nations destroyed 6

“What?”

“Crazy, crazy! Is He F * cking crazy? He actually wants our Sky Island dynasty to compensate him with four trillion middle-grade spirit stones!”

“Is he here to cause trouble? Ten times the compensation? Who does he think he is?”

“Deep-sea spirit spring? I didn’t expect the royal family to actually find a deep-sea spirit spring. No wonder our Lord City Lord’s cultivation base directly broke through after entering the palace!”

“He dares to ask for ten times the compensation from our Sky Island Empire. Is he trying to start a war with our Sky Island Empire?”

In the surroundings, the expressions of the experts and forces of the Sky Island Empire instantly turned gloomy when they heard Wang Xian’s words. They stared at Wang Xian with some anger.

The expression of the King of Sky Island changed drastically when he heard Wang Xian’s words. Killing intent slowly appeared in his eyes.

“Master of the Dragon Palace, you are here to cause trouble, right?”

His eyes were filled with a bone-chilling coldness as he stared at Wang Xian.

“Deep-sea spiritual spring? King of Sky Island, I didn’t expect you guys to obtain a deep-sea spiritual spring. You guys are really lucky!”

At this moment, the old man from the one-leaf mainland dynasty on the stage moved and flew over. He stared at the King of Sky Island with a smile on his face.

“I’m just lucky!”

The Sky Island King’s heart sank when he saw the old man staring at him with fervent eyes, and he squeezed out a smile.

“Haha, it’s not just lucky, it’s a blessing from the heavens. Sky Island King, can our two families mine the deep sea spiritual spring in the future? With our combined strength, no one can touch it!”

“Today, our one leaf continent dynasty and the Sky Island dynasty are going to marry. Why don’t we cooperate more deeply and get closer!”

The old man from the one-leaf mainland dynasty looked at the Sky Island King with a smile and said with a smile.

The Sky Island King looked at the old man and his expression changed slightly. He pondered for a moment and nodded. “Alright, in the future, our Sky Island dynasty and the one-leaf mainland dynasty will mine the deep sea spiritual spring together!”

“However, some people might not agree!”

As he spoke, he looked at Wang Xian slowly with an extremely cold gaze.

“Haha, King of the Sky Island, I’m not saying this, but with our two empires working together, no one within a radius of a few thousand kilometers is our match. No one dares to touch our treasures!”

The elder from the one leaf continent empire said with confidence and dominance.

“Alright!”

The King of the Sky Island clenched his fists slightly. His eyes shone brightly.

With the appearance of Wang Xian, the spiritual stones in the deep sea spiritual spring would definitely be redistributed in the future. Currently, they only took up 70% .

If they were to form an alliance with the one-leaf mainland dynasty, they would lose 20% at most.

Moreover, this could deepen the relationship between the two countries. Why not.

As for the leader of the Dragon Palace in front of them, the king of the Sky Island would be afraid of him. However, with the one-leaf Mainland dynasty joining forces, it was just as the old man had said. They had nothing to fear within a radius of thousands of kilometers.

“It seems like you guys are going to choose the second one!”

Wang Xian saw that the king of the Sky Island dynasty did not put him in their eyes at all.

He even reached an agreement with the one leaf mainland dynasty. A faint sneer appeared on Wang Xian’s face.

“Haha, choose. Then I will give you two choices as well. First, get out of here immediately and withdraw all your subordinates from the deep sea spiritual spring!”

“Second, our Sky Island dynasty will join forces with the one leaf mainland dynasty to wipe out all the forces that dare to touch the deep sea spiritual spring!”

The King of Sky Island stared at Wang Xian with a strong expression as he spoke with a cold gaze.

The King of Sky Island’s words caused the expressions of all the harpoon demon Beasts to change drastically. They looked extremely embarrassed.

However, facing the Alliance of the Sky Island dynasty and the one leaf mainland dynasty, they were completely helpless.

“HMPH, this bunch of darned fellows. They actually stained my body with blood!”

“It’s alright, it’s alright. If this fellow doesn’t know what’s good for him, my father will teach him a lesson!”

Princess Ye and Prince Jiang glanced at Wang Xian and the rest with cold expressions. Their eyes were filled with killing intent.

“Haha, Alright, Alright. I like these two choices. Coincidentally, the second choice I gave you is the same!”

At this moment, Wang Xian laughed out loud when he heard the king of the sky island’s domineering words.

Boom!

“Anyone who dares to offend the Dragon Palace shall die!”

“I declare that the Sky Island dynasty shall be destroyed!”

“The one-leaf mainland dynasty shall be destroyed!”

“Kill!”

A voice filled with dignity and anger rang out. When the Sky Island dynasty and the one-leaf mainland dynasty were about to join forces arrogantly.

Wang Xian had already sentenced them to death. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

A terrifying aura was emitted from Wang Xian’s body. The five elements grinding mill instantly flew out from his body.

“Roar!”

Just as Wang Xian finished his sentence, a dragon’s roar came from his mouth.

Transform into a dragon!

Everything happened in an instant. Wang Xian transformed into a terrifying divine dragon that was 50 meters in size.

The five elements millstone transformed into a huge object with a radius of two kilometers. A terrifying pressure was directed downwards.

In an instant, the sky seemed to be taken over by Wang Xian and was under his control.

Stupefied!

Everyone around was stupefied!

Including the King of the Sky Island and the elder from the one-leaf mainland dynasty, their bodies began to tremble when they felt the terrifying pressure in the sky!

“This... this... how is this possible!”

“Oh my god, what kind of creature is this? How did the Master of the Dragon Palace turn into such a terrifying existence!”

“This terrifying pressure is definitely not something that a fourth-level profound void martial artist can release!”

Below them, everyone from the Sky Island Empire had terrified expressions on their faces.

They raised their heads to look at the 50-meter-tall creature and the huge millstone that covered them, their bodies trembling.

“You are all guilty!”

Floating in the sky, looking at the terrified expressions on everyone’s faces, the dragon’s eyes were extremely cold.

An even more terrifying pressure covered the ground below.

“Plop!”

“What a terrifying pressure, I can’t hold on anymore!”

“Plop Plop Plop!”

With a sentence of ‘you’re all guilty’, some of the people below, whose strength had not reached the profound void tier, felt as if the sky had collapsed. They could not help but directly kneel on the ground.

“This is impossible... he... he...”

Crown Prince Jiang and Princess Yi ye knelt on the ground with trembling bodies. They raised their heads and looked at the creature that seemed to have descended from the legends. They were extremely shocked.

“Fifth level of the insightful void tier. It is definitely fifth level of the insightful void tier. No, no...”

The King of the Sky Island Empire felt the terrifying power coming from Wang Xian. His face was filled with cold sweat.

He looked at Wang Xian’s cold dragon eyes and his heart trembled.

“Die!”

At this moment, Wang Xian waved his dragon claw in the sky and a grey dragon claw attacked the king of the Sky Island.

“No... Let’s have a good talk. We, the Sky Island Empire, are willing to submit!”

Seeing the Grey Dragon Claw, the King of the sky island fled into the distance with a face full of fear. He shouted in horror.

Buzz

However, Wang Xian did not hold back at all. The Dragon Claw that contained destruction and explosion clawed at the king of the Sky Island.

With his strength of the fourth level of the Seethrough Void Tier, he had no ability to resist.
