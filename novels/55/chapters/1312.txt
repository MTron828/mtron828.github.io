Chapter 1313: 1314 went into hibernation

Boom! Boom! Boom

The collision between the Dharma Idol and the supernatural power.

When Wang Xian’s attack clashed with the Dharma Idol, the two terrifying energies exploded at the entrance of the main hall.

The Dharma Idol and the supernatural power slowly collapsed under the collision!

“What?”

The two powerhouses at the second level of the Seethrough realm were horrified when they saw the dharma idol collapsing.

“Run!”

The two of them did not hesitate at all. They turned around and fled into the distance.

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows. When he saw the two of them fleeing directly into the main hall, his eyes were filled with coldness.

He looked at the arm of the first-level insightful void martial artist. With a wave of his arm, he kept it into his interspatial ring.

Looking at the interspatial ring on his body, Wang Xian’s eyes flickered. A hint of a smile appeared in his eyes.

Following that, Wang Xian went to the side and kept the formation compass. The demon souls trapped inside came out.

“This bunch of D * MNED fellows are too despicable!”

The demon souls that came out of the formation roared furiously.

“You enter the spirit storage bag first!”

Wang Xian kept the demon souls into the spirit storage bag. He looked at the first level of the main hall and narrowed his eyes. A cold glint flashed in his eyes.

He used the formation of the third level of the void interpretation stage to trap and kill.

If it was an ordinary powerhouse below the third level of the void interpretation stage, 80% of them would be killed immediately.

If it wasn’t for the fact that he could ignore the formation, he would have to use all his strength to break the formation.

“Nameless Sword Demon!”

When he entered the first level of the main hall, he sensed dozens of people looking at him.

Some of them were cultivating with their legs crossed while others were conversing with each other.

Everyone knew about the battle at the entrance. When they looked at Wang Xian, some of them had a glint in their eyes.

There was fear and surprise!

Wang Xian looked at the huge hall. There were about forty to fifty people on the first level of the main hall. The weakest among them was at the first level of the Seethrough void stage.

There was a group of demonic beasts more than four kilometers away from the main hall. There were about sixty to seventy of them.

The two parties did not interfere with each other.

The spiritual energy in the main hall was seven to eight times more than in the outside world. The density of the spiritual energy was so dense that even a seethrough realm expert would be sitting cross-legged and cultivating here.

“The three people from the Frost sect ambushed him and did not kill him. On the contrary, one of them was killed. His strength is really strong!”

“The three people from the Frost sect are really unlucky. However, this nameless sword demon is really not simple!”

Some insightful emptiness realm experts were discussing in a low voice.

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly and looked at the two people who ambushed him earlier.

The two of them stood in the middle of a level four formation of the insightful emptiness realm. They stared at Wang Xian in embarrassment.

In fact, in the main hall, everyone was standing inside the formation.

Even the demonic beasts on the opposite side were the same.

The formation was to protect themselves and prevent the surrounding people from launching an attack in an instant.

It was also to prevent any demonic beasts or human experts from charging over and killing them directly.

“HMPH!”

Seeing Wang Xian staring at them, the two experts from the cold sect snorted coldly with an embarrassed expression. They sat down cross-legged and began to recover.

They didn’t want to fight to the death with Wang Xian, nor did they want to create a bigger enmity with him.

In the main hall, it was the best choice to kill the other party.

If they couldn’t kill him, then they would end it here.

Wang Xian looked at the position opposite him. The demonic beasts didn’t even look in his direction.

Some of the demonic beasts looked at the stairs above, and their eyes were filled with passion.

“Stairway to heaven, Stairway to Heaven!”

He murmured. The first floor of the main hall was where the spiritual energy was the weakest. With each floor higher, the spiritual energy was much higher.

When one reached the twenty-first floor, the spiritual energy on it was like liquid.

Every floor higher was called the stairway to heaven.

Only by reaching the top could one obtain some treasures and inheritances left behind by the ancient blood stream sect.

However, if one wanted to reach a higher level, one had to possess at least the strength of the second level of the Seethrough realm. Even the second level of the Seethrough realm was very difficult to reach.

Wang Xian swept his gaze around and ignored them. He turned around and left.

“I’m still too weak here. Unless I can completely grasp the combination of four attributes, I even need to comprehend the combination of five attributes!”

Wang Xian thought to himself.

The two people who ambushed him earlier could definitely enter their formation and kill them with his strength.

However, he didn’t do so. He would only start to wreak havoc when he was strong enough.

For now, he had to keep a low profile. Otherwise, he might be targeted by the others.

With this thought in mind, he walked out of the main hall and headed towards the direction of the demonic beasts.

Although the light and dark fire dragon eyes were greatly restricted, it was still much more powerful than the other scouts.

“The demonic soul has entered the territory of your Demonic Beasts!”

After entering the ocean, Wang Xian looked at the seawater in front of him and released the demonic soul from his storage bag.

“Wang, I’ve been to this place before. I know where it is!”

The demonic soul looked around and said to Wang Xian.

“Alright, let’s Go!”

Wang Xian’s eyes were filled with joy as he quickly said to it.

“Yes!”

The demon soul nodded and flew straight to the bottom of the sea.

At the bottom of the sea, there were many huge buildings. Compared to the buildings of humans, the buildings at the bottom of the sea looked even bigger.

The black buildings exuded a wild aura!

“There’s a ferocious beast at the second level of the Seethrough Realm Ahead!”

After driving for five minutes, Wang Xian suddenly discovered a ferocious beast hiding beside a building at the bottom of the sea.

“My king, the number of ferocious beasts on the demonic beasts’side is much more than the humans’side. Last time, I was chased by a ferocious beast and accidentally entered that place!”

The Demon Soul said to Wang Xian.

“Okay!”

Wang Xian nodded his head. His eyes flickered. “Let’s Speed Up!”

As he said that, his body underwent a terrifying transformation.

A divine dragon that was 30 to 40 meters in size appeared directly at the bottom of the sea. The huge dragon aura was directed towards the lurking ferocious beast.

“Roar!”

When the ferocious beast saw that Wang Xian had suddenly turned into a terrifying monster, its eyes were filled with astonishment.

“Die!”

However, Wang Xian didn’t give it any chance. His huge body moved and his terrifying dragon claws clawed at the ferocious beast.

“Bang!”

The ferocious beast released a huge water cannon in anger. When it saw that it was useless, panic appeared in its eyes.

“Roar! Roar!”

A miserable scream was heard. Wang Xian opened his huge mouth and swallowed the beast.

Wang Xian, who was in the form of a divine dragon, could easily kill a powerhouse at level two of the Seethrough realm.

Even if he was at level three of the Seethrough realm, he could still kill him.

“Let’s Go!” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Wang Xian shouted softly and let the Demon Soul lead the way.

“It’s the King!”

The Demon Soul looked at Wang Xian’s true form with respect in his eyes and immediately led the way.

Wang Xian did not revert to his human form. The Divine Dragon was also known as the Demon Beast Clan in the past.

But because it was too powerful, it was called the Dragon God clan alone.
