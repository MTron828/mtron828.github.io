Chapter 610: He Is The Dragon King (1)

“Dragon King?” Xiaoxiao mumbled to herself upon hearing Ao Shuwen.

She had a strong impression of this name.

That brat that could be considered demon-like even when compared with those of his age in Yong Chang world also had the name “Dragon King.”

When she had first entered the real world, she had no regard for any forces in the Underworld, let alone any of the supreme talents of the Underworld.

Even Emperor Qi of Diabolism and the Sect Leader of Dong Hua Sacred Sect, Nie Wushuang, were average in her eyes.

However, that demon-like Dragon King had truly surprised and shocked her.

Upon hearing this name, she was a little doubtful.

The Sect Leader of the Sacred Followers Guild beside her was equally surprised and doubtful.

“That’s right. It was refined by the Dragon King!”

Piao Lingxue nodded her head plainly before continuing, “However, he’s just a blacksmith master. He probably couldn’t refine Level 12 spiritual equipment!”

“Dragon King?”

Several supreme talents of Yong Chang Immortal Sect and Immortal Slaying Sect exclaimed with curiosity. Over the recent period, they had been focusing on preparing for the grand contest and had not paid attention to other matters.

“He can refine Level 12 spiritual equipment now! He’s a blacksmith grand master!” said Ao Shuwen with a tinge of fear and respect.

That’s a grandmaster!

Over the recent period, the dozen-odd forces had been monitoring the Dragon King through various methods.

The moment he could refine Level 7 elixir pills and Level 12 spiritual equipment, they knew about it.

The greater the strength the Dragon King displayed, the more horrified they were.

They also knew about Roving Sword visiting the Dragon King a few days ago.

“What? Grandmaster?”

The crowd of supreme talents were taken aback as they revealed expressions of shock. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Ao Shuwen nodded his head, looked at Jin Jian and said, “His spiritual sword was forged by the Dragon King!”

“Dragon King? Grandmaster?”

Jin Jian looked bitter and a tinge of ruthlessness flashed across his eyes.

Ao Shuwen was secretly exhilarated. He knew that Jin Jian was a petty person who would definitely deal with those who went against him. As long as he could give the Dragon King some issues, Ao Shuwen wouldn’t let the opportunity slipped!

“Who would have expected that another grandmaster would appear in Yong Chang world?”

The handsome young man with long hair, Ge Wen, was surprised.

“Senior brother Hong probably referred to him when he talked about the one who would be first in the rankings of young disciples!” Ao Shuwen glanced at Ge Wen, smirked and added.

“Oh? Hong Tianda, is he the one you are talking about?” Before Hong Tianda said a word, Ge Wen squinted his eyes and asked him.

“Yeah. You wouldn’t be a match for him!” said Hong Tianda boldly and frankly.

“Hehe! Is that so? In that case. I would like to meet him if there’s an opportunity!” replied Ge Wen coldly.

Hong Tianda didn’t respond and simply sat there.

Seeing this, Ao Shuwen was pleasantly surprised.

“Junior sister Huo, it’s our battle next. Do you still want to compete?”

“It’s not necessary. I admit my defeat. Let’s bring on the battle between Senior brother Hong and Roving Sword from Immortal Slaying Sect!”

“Haha! Hong Tianda, I’ll defeat you easily in our upcoming battle. The title of the strongest disciple of the three Immortal Sects will definitely be mine!”

The contest continued.

After half an hour, the match between the strongest disciple of Da Hong Immortal Sect, Hong Tianda, and Roving Sword of Immortal Slaying Sect started.

Just as everyone thought that Hong Tianda would emerge victoriously, Roving Sword from Immortal Slaying Sect won once again.

This shocked everyone, including all the supreme talents.

“Senior brother Hong was defeated by Roving Sword! What a huge upset!”

“This is really shocking. Roving Sword defeated Senior brother Hong Tianda! It would seem that he has the strength to win it all!”

“He’s the greatest dark horse for this contest. However, it would likely be impossible for him to defeat Senior brother Ge Wen!”

“Senior brother Ge Wen is a level stronger than Senior brother Hong. He should be able to defeat Roving Sword!”

Around the arena, several tens of thousands of disciples were discussing fervently. Roving sword making it to the finals had exceeded the expectation of all the disciples.

However, none of these disciples felt that Roving Sword would be able to defeat Ge Wen.

Ge Wen was the strongest disciple of Yong Chang Immortal Sect. He was incredibly strong and had Heavenly Flame, a set of spiritual equipment and strength that triumphed over his peers and other supreme talents.

“Roving Sword making it to the finals was indeed unexpected. However, he’s still lacking the strength to defeat Ge Wen!”

An Elder on the mountain peak, where all Elders had gathered, commented plainly.

“Elder Wang, once their contest is over, head to the arena. At that time, the sect will announce the name list to enter Yong Chang Cauldron.” the Great Elder looked at Wang Xian and remarked.

Mmm!

Wang Xian nodded his head. He looked around him and smirked. No one here could defeat Roving Sword!

At this very moment, on the small mountain peak where the Elders of Immortal Slaying Sect were standing, the Elders’ eyebrows were knitted together and their eyes were fixed on Roving Sword.

“He defeated Hong Tianda! Do you guys think he will defeat Ge Wen?”

An old man frowned and asked this with a bitter face.

Although the Sect Leader had given his orders to disallow Roving Sword from entering the Yong Chang Cauldron, Roving Sword had now made it to the finals.

Based on the rules of the grand contest, the top ten would qualify to enter Yong Chang Cauldron.

On the rare chance that Roving Sword was to defeat Ge Wen, he would be the overall champion for this grand contest.

If they were to disallow the strongest disciple of the three Immortal Sects from entering Yong Chang Cauldron, they would find it hard to explain themselves.

Moreover, this wouldn’t do any good to the reputation of Immortal Slaying Sect.

Trying to put down their most talented disciple?

What would the disciples of other Immortal Sects think?

“The current situation is having some implications for the reputation of our Immortal Slaying Sect. This... He most likely couldn’t defeat Ge Wen from Yong Chang Immortal Sect!”

An Elder standing by the side spoke with a worried frown.

“What if? Why don’t we let him give up the match? This would save us from any potential implications!” another Elder hesitated for a moment before suggesting.

“Mm. That will work. At the end of the day, he will definitely have issues with not being able to enter the Yong Chang Cauldron. In that case, let’s just be more decisive!”

“What issues could this kid have? He’s just liked a machine!”

The Elders of Immortal Slaying Sect made their decisions and informed the referee immediately that Roving Sword from Immortal Slaying Sect had admitted his defeat.

“Admitted defeat? Roving Sword from Immortal Slaying Sect has admitted his defeat? Sigh! I thought we would be getting a thrilling contest. Who would have expected him to admit defeat?”

“It seems like Roving Sword knows where he stands. He probably has chosen to admit his defeat after learning how strong Senior brother Ge Wen is!”

“Indeed, Senior brother Ge Wen is undoubtedly the strongest disciple in the younger generation!”

When the hundreds of thousands of disciples around heard the news of Roving Sword admitting his defeat, they frowned initially and soon broke out into raucous discussion.

When Wang Xian heard the news, he was astonished.

Roving Sword admitted his defeat?

Roving Sword had told him that he was going to take first place. Since Roving Sword had promised him, Roving Sword would definitely ensure that it came to fruition.

“Roving Sword, you won’t have to fight the last match. We have admitted defeat on your behalf!”

Just as Roving Sword was frowning and feeling puzzled about the news, he heard the Great Elder of Immortal Slaying Sect.

He was taken aback. His expression turned solemn but he didn’t say a word.
