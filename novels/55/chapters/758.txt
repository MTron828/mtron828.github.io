Chapter 759: 0760 empress (2/5)

Translator: 549690339

The Divine Dragon crafting workshop was very important to Wang Xian and even to the entire Dragon Palace.

Especially after today’s cooperation with the natural born celestial sect.

They set up a crafting workshop to sell elixirs and spiritual artifacts. At the same time, they would undertake the refinement of elixirs and spiritual artifacts.

To Wang Xian, this was an important method to gather resources. It was far more profitable than opening a shop in Jiang City.

The spiritual herbs of the natural celestial sect were the most abundant among all the celestial sects. In fact, their spiritual herbs were comparable to the sum of more than ten celestial sects.

Using these spiritual herbs to refine elixirs to attract customers, he would establish the largest shop in the martial arts world to sell and refine elixirs.

In the future, almost 80% of the spiritual herbs and elixirs would be circulated from his shop. By then, he would not be in need of elixirs at all.

Just medicinal pills alone could increase his cultivation level.

Currently, the eight cauldrons were already open to the public. It was completely possible to set up shop in the cities of the immortal sects.

Wang Xian ordered Mo Qinglong to purchase the pill shops. He wanted to fill all the shops in the eight cauldrons within a month.

Naturally, the cities of the Holy Medicine Immortal sect and the Holy Doctor Immortal sect could not be occupied.

“I still have a lot of metal materials that I obtained from the Yu Ding world. I can totally forge and sell them one by one!”

“If the Divine Dragon crafting workshop can proceed smoothly, I will be able to advance to the strength of a superior immortal within two to three months at most. I can even complete the first transformation of the Divine Dragon Transformation!”

Wang Xian sat in front of the bed and pondered. “The only troublesome thing is that I have to forge all the spiritual weapons and elixirs myself!”

“HMM!”

At this moment, a weak voice was heard.

Wang Xian was stunned. Following that, an excited expression appeared on his face. He quickly raised his head and looked at the bed.

“Xiao Xian, Xiao Xian!”

“Shu Qing, I’m here, I’m Here!”

Wang Xian revealed an excited expression. When he saw that her arms were trembling slightly and she was shouting unconsciously, he revealed an excited expression.

Boom

At this moment, a terrifying flame was emitted from her body.

The flame was extremely terrifying. Every strand of flame seemed to be formed from lava and was emitting a suffocating temperature.

Wang Xian’s expression changed slightly. With a wave of his arm, he suppressed it.

However, Guan Shuqing’s clothes were instantly burned, revealing her delicate body that was emitting a faint red glow.

“This flame can already threaten a middle-level immortal!”

Wang Xian’s eyes revealed a hint of shock as he shouted softly, “Shuqing, Shuqing!”

“Okay!”

The wood spirit fruit seemed to be of great use to her. Guan Shuqing’s eyelashes were trembling non-stop.

Wang Xian held her hands nervously, waiting for her to wake up.

“Xiao... Xiao Xian!”

A few minutes later, Guan Shuqing slowly woke up. A terrifying flame flashed across her eyes.

“Shuqing, you’re finally awake!”

Seeing that Guan Shuqing had woken up, Wang Xian heaved a sigh of relief. “How are you feeling now? Are you feeling unwell?”

“Have I slept for a long time?”

Guan Shuqing looked at Wang Xian. Her eyes were filled with confusion as she muttered to herself.

“You’ve been asleep for more than a year. Do you feel unwell?”

Wang Xian asked immediately.

The wood spirit fruit was a grade-8 spiritual herb. With six wood spirit fruits, it would be of great use even if an immortal were to consume them!

“No, I feel that my body is filled with strength!”

Guan Shuqing shook her head and extended her arms lovingly. “Xiao Xian, give me a hug!”

“Hehe!”

When Wang Xian saw that Guan Shuqing had completely recovered, a happy expression appeared on his face. He looked at her body and smiled perversely.

Guan Shuqing seemed to have sensed something. She looked at her body, rolled her eyes at him, and put her arms down.

“Shuqing, come and hug me!”

Wang Xian quickly stretched out his arms and hugged her immediately. His heart was filled with excitement.

“You’re so annoying!”

Guan Shuqing rolled her eyes at him and didn’t reject him. Her strong love turned into soft water.

The Awakening of Shuqing made him excited. He jumped onto the bed and threw his clothes away with a wave of his arm.

What followed was naturally a great battle.

Guan Shuqing closed her eyes and cooperated with him with a smile on her face.

However, half an hour later, the excited Guan Shuqing’s eyes moved. At the center of her brows, there was a faint image of a vermilion bird flickering with light.

...

Feng Luan was the empress of the extraordinary continent’s Feng dynasty, and also the number one empress of the extraordinary continent.

The Feng family of the Phoenix Dynasty had a trace of the Vermillion Bird’s bloodline, and their powerful fire control ability allowed their ancestors to create the powerful Phoenix dynasty.

In the 2120 years of the Phoenix dynasty, the dynasty was plagued by internal and external problems, and it was on the verge of collapse.

This year, Feng Luan was born.

The Feng Luan that was born was not in human form, but in the form of a Vermillion Bird.

Feng Luan was known as the Vermilion Bird Reincarnation. She possessed terrifying cultivation talent.

Fifteen years later, the Feng dynasty was plagued with internal problems. The fan kings revolted, and a million super experts attempted to invade the palace.

That year, Feng Luan was fifteen years old. At the age of fifteen, she swept through a million experts with the appearance of an expert!

Feng Luan appeared out of nowhere and killed all the people in the Feng dynasty who were uneasy. She stabilized the rule of the Feng dynasty.

This year, the 15-year-old Feng Luan became the Emperor and became the first empress of the Feng dynasty. All the officials submitted to her and all the people worshipped her!

At the age of 18, Feng Luan led her troops and swept across a radius of 10,000 li. Many dynasties submitted to her.

The number one empress of the Continent was born!

Her strength was monstrous and Her Majesty was overwhelming!

At the age of 35, Feng Luan’s cultivation technique had reached the peak and she needed to undergo nirvana.

During the period of the Phoenix’s nirvana, they were at their weakest.

However, during this period of time, they were betrayed by their clan. Feng Luan risked her life to escape with a drop of her blood essence. In the end, she fainted and her soul fell into a deep sleep.

With her injuries from before, it would require an extremely terrifying amount of energy to wake up.

However, some time ago, her soul woke up and found that she was occupying a body.

Her powerful physical body and her weak soul simply couldn’t support it.

According to her estimation, she would need more than ten years to repair herself to be able to support this body.

However, today, she suddenly felt a rich soul nourishment enter her body, greatly shortening the time for her to wake up.

However, at this time, he discovered that there was another soul in this body, which made her heart sink slightly.

The soul was already abnormally mysterious. If it was her in the past, she could have directly occupied this body with powerful soul power. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

But now, her soul was on par with the other soul, and they might even be together.

This made her face slightly embarrassed.

Secondly, because of the weakness of her soul, there were uncertain factors when two souls controlled the body. It was possible that the body would be controlled by the other body, or it was possible that the body would be controlled by her.

When she sensed that the other soul had gone out and that something had happened with a man on the bed, her soul immediately trembled.

Fortunately, she only watched from the perspective of a bystander and did not feel anything. In the future, when her cultivation level increased, she could just find another body.

However, just as she was shielding her soul, that uncertain factor appeared!
