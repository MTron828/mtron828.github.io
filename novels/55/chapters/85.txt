“You don’t have to inform us. We have overheard everything.”

Wang Xian frowned upon hearing their conversation and walked over slowly.

Director Cui was slightly shocked and looked at Wang Xian in surprise. However, he quickly recovered and maintained a smile on his face. “I’m really sorry about this, brother, but this pink Bentley has been ordered by someone. If you would still like to have it, you could wait a month and I’ll get the Bentley Headquarters to custom-make one for you.”

“There should be a sequence in buying a car. When we want to buy it, this car hasn’t been sold. Now that we are about to buy it, you’re telling me that it has already been booked? Isn’t this out of line? Are you fooling with me?”

Wang Xian looked at Director Cui and spoke indifferently.

When Director Cui heard his words, his eyebrows knitted together. He was also wary of offending Wang Xian as one who could afford a car over $4 million definitely wouldn’t be a simple man. However, he was more wary of offending the young man beside him.

“Let’s do it this way, brother. Why don’t you take a look at other models of car or perhaps you could wait for a month? I’ll get one made for you from the headquarters,” Director Cui looked at him and said.

“You can say this to the young man beside you,” Wang Xian replied.

Wang Xian’s reply made Director Cui’s face sink. His eyebrows were closely knitted together.

“In that case, I’m sorry, brother. There’s nothing I can do. This car has already been booked by another customer.”

“You haven’t even paid for it. He’s free to sell it to whoever he wants. What’s there to quarrel about!”

The beautiful girl beside the young man looked at Wang Xian and said, clearly annoyed.

That pink Bentley was for her and she naturally wouldn’t allow anyone to snatch it away from her.

The young man looked on nonchalantly and didn’t say a word.

“That’s not wrong but I’m not happy about it!”

Wang Xian smiled and said slowly, “I’m a consumer and I’m not here looking to suffer such unjust feelings!”

“There are many unjust things in the world. What can you do about it? Hehe. Brat! It’s good for you to go through these experiences.”

The young man sneered when he saw how Wang Xian reacted.

Wang Xian shrugged his shoulders and looked to the manager and Director Cui. “We are here to buy a car and not for this. After trying out for so long and being just about to buy, you’re telling me it has been booked? Moreover, it’s clear that the other party hasn’t bought it yet.”

“Hey, brother, we are the seller!” When Director Cui heard his words, his expression got even heavier. “We are free to choose who we would like to sell to.”

“Don’t you hear them? They are free to choose who they want to sell to! What are you blabbering about? Annoying! They have already said that they aren’t selling it to you!”

The beautiful girl at the side crossed her arms and remarked sarcastically.

“Great, great!” A cold look surfaced on Wang Xian’s face as the anger in him had built up.

He was angry over what Director Cui had said. After trying the car for half an hour and being just about to pay for the car, he was told that the car had been sold to another person. Moreover, they weren’t the slightest bit apologetic about it. Saying that they were free to sell to whoever they chose was the final straw.

Whoever encountered such an incident naturally wouldn’t feel good about it.

“In that case, I’ll let you pay a price for it!” Wang Xian remarked coldly.

Since they had made him unhappy, he would also make them unhappy.

“Price? Hehe!” When Director Cui heard him, he smirked coldly and stared at Wang Xian with contempt. “I would like to see what price you could make us pay. Tsk. Get out of my shop immediately.”

“So arrogant? I wonder where he was from.” Young Master Lin looked at Wang Xian from the side. “Don’t be so arrogant in Rivertown. Otherwise, you might not even know how you will die.”

“I sure would like to know how I would die in Rivertown!”

The vibes of a divine dragon started spreading from his body gradually.

“Brother, let’s just let it go... I’m not interested in this car anymore.”

Xiao Yu looked at the crowd around her. She started feeling a little worried and pulled Wang Xian’s arm.

Hehe.

When Wang Xian heard her sister, he released his aura and joked, “Xiao Yu, just stand aside and watch. I’ll let you see what your brother is capable of today. There’s no one we need to be afraid of in Rivertown.”

“Brother~”

Wang Xian caressed her head before turning his attention to Director Cui, Young Master Lin and the girl.

“Didn’t you hear me? This is my territory. Get out of here, you brazen brat.” Director Cui met Wang Xian’s gaze.

“‘A newborn calf isn’t afraid of a tiger.’ An arrogant brat like you would suffer a terrible death.” Young Master Lin lit a cigarette and looked at Wang Xian as though he was watching a show.

“In that case, let’s see if I will have a terrible death.”

Wang Xian smirked and noticed a large hammer used for repairs at one side. He walked towards it directly.

“Brat, what do you think you are trying to do?” When Director Cui saw Wang Xian go and pick up the hammer, his expression changed as he roared loudly.

Young Master Lin also raised his eyebrows and stared coldly at Wang Xian.

“What am I trying to do? Since you made me unhappy, I’ll just have to vent it out a little.”

Wang Xian’s lips curved into a smile and he turned his attention to within the shop.

There were approximately 10 Bentleys in the shop. He carried the hammer and walked to the nearest one to him.

Bang!

The hammer smashed heavily on the Bentley, forming a huge dent from the ginormous impact.

“YOU...” Director Cui’s expression turned ghastly upon seeing Wang Xian smash the Bentley. “Bastard, stop it right now. Otherwise, I won’t hold back.”

“I’m going to smash this shop and would like to see what will happen to me!”

Wang Xian glanced at him with murderous intent. The hammer in his hand smashed down on the Bentley once again.

A huge dent appeared after a single smash. After smashing the Bentley 4-5times, the Bentley looked completely wrecked.

However, Wang Xian didn’t stop and simply walked to the next Bentley to continue smashing.

“STOP! Call security. Get the security over here and kill him...”

Seeing that Wang Xian had smashed two Bentleys, Director Cui’s eyes had turned red in anger as he roared loudly.

The young man by the side threw the cigarette on the floor and stared at Wang Xian callously.

Wang Xian smiled plainly and said, “After I’ve smashed all the cars, do show me what will happen to me.”

Currently, Wang Xian wasn’t afraid of anyone in Rivertown. Qin Family’s influence could help him settle anything in the society.

As for the underworld, he was even less wary of anyone.

Bam bam bam!

Incessant thumping pierced through the atmosphere. Wang Xian had already smashed five Bentleys when the security guards arrived one after another.

“Stop! You better stop!”

When the four security guards saw Wang Xian smashing the Bentley, they were shocked. These are Bentleys that cost over $3 million each!

Yet, he dared to just smash!

And he had already smashed five of them!

Wang Xian saw the group of security guards and smiled. He threw the hammer in his hand on the floor and stared at the red-eyed Director Cui.

“Come, I have just smashed five cars. Let me see what will happen to me!”

“Bastard, you are dead! You are as good as dead.”

Seeing the fearless look on Wang Xian, he pulled out a phone directly. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

He didn’t call for the police but dialed another number.

The young master of the Ren Family was here and it seemed that young master Ren wasn’t in a good mood. If he knew that there was someone causing trouble here, he would definitely cripple the troublemaker.

The Ren Family was strong and had interests in half of the 4s showrooms. This place was just one of them.

It’s over. This brat is as good as dead.
