Chapter 3224: The 3223 treasure was in his hands

One person could hold the fort and no one could open it!

Wang Xian stood there calmly. The experts from the Gemini race, the snake princess race, the Saint Armor Venerable, and the other forces looked at him with an awkward expression.

The elementary races in the starry sky didn’t dare to make a move.

The strength displayed by the Dragon Palace made them feel fearful.

“Dragon King of the Dragon Palace, are you going to make an enemy out of us?”

“The Dragon Palace must think of the price to pay for making an enemy out of us!”

In the sky, the experts of the horned seal race, who were completely restrained by the Heaven Formation Willow God and the rest, roared furiously.

“Today, you can either defeat US and fight for the resources, or get lost. As for making an enemy out of you, our Dragon Palace is not afraid at all.”

Wang Xian looked at the venerable Golden Dragon of the Horned Seal race in the sky and said faintly.

“Roar!”

“Good, good, good. Just you wait!”

When the Golden Dragon Knight heard Wang Xian’s words, a cold killing intent appeared on his face.

He moved and retreated to the back immediately.

Now, there was no longer a need to continue the battle.

They could not fight against the Dragon Palace. They could only watch helplessly as they plundered a large number of treasures.

“This… the experts of the horned seal race are completely unable to fight against the experts of the Dragon Palace.”

“The strength of the Dragon Palace is simply too strong. I really did not expect that their strength would be so terrifying.”

“Another faction of the divine dragon lineage has risen.”

The experts of the other races who were not participating in the battle in the starry sky of the surrounding galaxy were filled with shock when they saw this scene.

The Dragon Palace had single-handedly blocked the experts from the three races and the terrifying mecha.

“If they split the spoils of war like the Dragon Palace said at the beginning, they can still get a lot of treasures. Now…”

Some people pursed their lips and glanced at the venerable Golden Dragon and the others.

Maybe it wasn’t because they were greedy, but they didn’t expect the Dragon Palace’s strength to be so terrifying.

“Venerable Golden Dragon!”

The two women of the Serpentine clan moved and flew toward the Venerable Golden Dragon.

“Yes!”

The Venerable Golden Dragon nodded with a gloomy face and looked down.

The experts of the Dragon Palace were looting all kinds of treasures.

The starriver clan was not weak. The treasures that their clan had were very tempting to even the horned seal clan.

Now, seeing that the treasures that originally belonged to them had been taken away by others, his heart was burning with anger.

“The people of the Dragon Palace are too arrogant. They don’t put us in their eyes at all.”

A woman said with a changing expression.

“It will take a few days for our people to reach here. During this time, they will be able to take away all the treasures here.”

The other snake lady’s expression was not good either.

They thought it would be a huge harvest, but they did not expect it to be like this.

“Everyone, Goodbye!”

From the side, the Sacred Armor Knight shook his head when he saw this. He moved and left immediately.

The Sacred Armor Knight was a lone wolf in the universe. He did not have his own race.

He was not going to participate in this situation.

It might not be beneficial for him to continue participating.

As he spoke, his body flashed and he left.

“Sir Golden Dragon Knight, we…”

The two elders of the twin species flew over and said with an ugly expression.

“The Tianhai Dragon King’s Dragon Palace is a huge treasure, and with the Xingjiang clan’s treasure…”

The Golden Dragon Venerable’s expression also changed slightly.

A former Divine Dragon, a former Dragon King. Even if the Sky Sea Dragon Palace didn’t have any treasures, the Sky Sea Dragon Palace’s value alone was extremely terrifying.

With the entire Star River clan’s treasure, this resource was too terrifying.

“That Dragon Palace’s rate of improvement is very fast. Their Dragon Palace definitely has a powerful divine dragon inheritance.”

The two women of the Snake Princess Clan said.

Now, they were considering whether or not to attack the Dragon Palace.

Once they did, they had to destroy the Dragon Palace. Otherwise, the revenge of a faction of the Divine Dragon bloodline would be very terrifying.

Especially since the Dragon Palace had a purebred divine dragon.

With a purebred divine dragon, their potential in the future was much greater than theirs.

“Let’s investigate the situation of the Dragon Palace first before making a decision!”

After seeing the terrifying power of the Dragon Palace, the Golden Dragon Knight didn’t dare to start a war rashly.

Even though their horned seal race was a mid level race in the universe, they weren’t too strong.

Compared to the powerful races in the surrounding starry skies, there was still a huge gap.

There weren’t many universe Knight Level 5 Great Beings in their race.

They wouldn’t make a move rashly before they had the confidence to destroy the Dragon Palace.

The Gemini race and the Sheji race were slightly silent.

If the horned seal race didn’t make a move, it would be very difficult for them to destroy the Dragon Palace with their Race’s strength.

“Damn the Dragon Palace!”

The sheji race’s two women looked around with dark expressions.

This time, they came for the Dragon Blood and the Dragon Palace. In the end, they only obtained the corpse of a Yilong.

The Venerable Golden Dragon and the rest did not continue to attack. Wang Xian and the rest were floating in the void and locked onto them.

Time passed little by little. The members of the Dragon Palace had obtained a large number of treasures.

None of the Cosmos God kingdoms could find them.

“Dragon King, we have basically obtained everything that we can gather.”

Ten hours later, the leaders of the Dragon Palace walked over excitedly.

“Very good. Let’s go back.”

Wang Xian smiled and waved at them.

“Let’s go back!”

The leaders of the dragon palace shouted softly and slowly disappeared.

They left behind the Golden Dragon Venerable and the rest, who looked a little embarrassed and gloomy.

“Dragon King, there are a lot of treasures in the Starriver clan’s treasury. Most importantly, there are a large number of treasures in the Sky Sea Dragon Palace. They should have been given to the Sky Sea Dragon King by the great demons and the Starriver clan.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“These resources would not pose a problem for the Dragon Palace to increase the number of universe knights by more than 100.”

“There are also the resources in the Cosmos God Nation and the Cosmos God nation, which could increase the number of universe knights by around 200.”

Prime Minister Gui and the rest finished counting the resources and revealed an excited expression.

“There are around 550 corpses of universe knights here. Among them, there is one level four universe knight and seven or eight level three universe knights.”

Wang Xian waved his arm and took out all the corpses. He was smiling.

This time, the Dragon Palace had gained more than the three races.

The Starriver clan had lost more than 300 universe knights this time, along with the great demons and the ones he killed later.

There was a total of more than 500.

These corpses could increase the combat strength of the Dragon Palace by at least 500 universe knights.

“After this, the Dragon Palace will have the strength of an intermediate race in the universe.”

Wang Xian’s eyes were shining.
