Chapter 3149: 3148 hongmen banquet

“Buzz!”

The disc flew around everyone, but the drop of blood on it didn’t move at all.

The two venerables of the ancient painting sect frowned slightly.

“Maybe venerable Lou Shan encountered danger when he entered the Milky Way.”

Venerable Lou Shan saw it and said indifferently.

“Maybe.”

The two venerables of the ancient painting sect were also somewhat uncertain.

With the strength of their ancient painting sect, the Milky Way’s forces shouldn’t dare to kill Venerable Lou Shan.

Maybe they really did have an accident.

The two thought in their hearts.

“I’m really sorry, everyone, and thank you for your cooperation.” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

The two cupped their hands and waved their arms, and fine food flew to the tables one after another.

“This is some food we brought, we apologize to everyone.”

The two venerables from the ancient art sect said with a smile.

The so-called delicacies were all high-grade spiritual herbs and fruits.

They could indeed be considered treasures if they were placed outside.

The group of universe venerables smiled faintly.

Wang Xian sat at the side and smiled faintly. He picked up a few food casually.

“This must be the Dragon King. I’ve heard a lot about you.”

The two from the ancient art sect didn’t find any problems, and the atmosphere eased up a lot.

Venerable Red Mist looked at Wang Xian and walked over with a smile. He cupped his hands.

“Venerable Red Mist, I’ve heard a lot about you.”

Wang Xian cupped his hands politely at Venerable Red Mist.

The two venerable from the ancient art sect looked at Wang Xian with a hint of curiosity in their eyes.

They were also curious about the force that had just destroyed an elementary race in the universe and scared away an elementary race in the universe.

Especially since it was a force with the bloodline of the Divine Dragon.

However, the two of them did not go forward to chat. The Dragon King was obviously dissatisfied with their actions.

There was no need for them to go over and curry favor with them.

After a brief conversation, the entire banquet ended.

“Goodbye, everyone. Come to the Dragon Palace as a guest when you are free.”

Wang Xian did not stay here for long. Other than getting to know the primary race of the universe, he did not gain anything else.

“Roar!”

At the side, Lei Ming’s body moved and immediately transformed into a ten-meter-long thunder dragon.

The Thunder was restrained and suspended in the air like a holy object.

Wang Xian’s body moved and flew directly to Lei Ming. He cupped his hands at them.

“Huh?”

“This is?”

When the Venerable Red Mist, the skeleton race, and the ancient art sect saw Lei Ming, their pupils contracted slightly and they revealed a shocked expression.

This was especially so for the three figures from the skeleton clan. They stared at Lei Ming’s pupils, which were throbbing non-stop.

Wang Xian swept his gaze across them and smiled. Lei Ming immediately flew towards the Dragon Palace.

“Is this a purebred divine dragon?”

A venerable from the ancient painting sect asked with a twinkle in his eyes.

“It has been rumored that there is a purebred divine dragon in the Dragon Palace. From the looks of it… is that the legendary lightning dragon?”

“It’s exactly the same as the legendary Lightning Dragon.”

Venerable Red Mist and the others whispered in shock.

Just by looking at the appearance of the Lightning Dragon, it was definitely not an ordinary sub-dragon.

“It feels even purer than the bloodline of the Heavenly Dragon Clan.”

A venerable from the ancient painting sect said indifferently.

“Let’s report this matter. Pure-blooded Dragon? It seems that the Dragon Palace has obtained a very powerful inheritance of the Dragon God.”

The two old men from the ancient painting sect said as they took out the universe’s AI and sent a message.

The three old men from the skeleton clan looked at each other from the side. They could see the fervor in each other’s eyes.

“Pure-blooded divine dragon. It’s definitely the legendary pure-blooded divine dragon.”

The voice of a machine came from the middle figure of the skeleton clan.

They had killed many sub-dragons, so they were very clear about the situation of the Divine Dragon’s bloodline.

At the beginning, they had noticed the thunder, but they weren’t sure.

But now, seeing it transform into a thunder dragon, the bloodline power in its body was definitely not an ordinary sub-dragon.

They were 80% sure that it was a purebred divine dragon.

How many more were there in the universe?

“If we baptize them with the pure-blooded dragon God’s bloodline, we…”

The skeleton knight on the right trembled, his eyes burning.

“The Dragon Palace is very powerful, it will be difficult for us to destroy them.”

The figure on the left said.

“If we knew, we would have joined forces with nine swords and the dragon descendants to destroy the Dragon Palace.”

The figure on the right shook his head regretfully.

“We must obtain the pure-blooded dragon God’s bloodline.”

The figure in the middle said firmly.

If they could obtain the pure-blooded dragon God’s bloodline, it would be a terrifying upgrade for them.

They would be able to turn into real dragon God skeletons.

“Contact the Patriarch of the nine swords race, and then contact the bloodthirsty race in the Milky Way.”

The figure in the middle said slowly.

“Bloodthirsty Race?”

The two figures of the skeleton race on the left and right paused slightly, their eyes flashing with a luster.

The bloodthirsty race didn’t originally belong to the Milky Way. Even now, they didn’t have any activities in the Milky Way.

But the skeleton race knew where the bloodthirsty race was.

They were hiding in a corner of the Milky Way.

The blood ruthless race and the ancient painting divine sect belonged to the same starry sky.

The blood ruthless race had once hunted the quasi-dragon crazily, but they met an opponent later.

The Heavenly Dragon Race.

The blood ruthless race was almost exterminated by the Heavenly Dragon Race. Then, they fled to the Milky Way to recuperate.

However, the blood ruthless race’s strength was still not to be underestimated.

The skeleton race, the blood ruthless race, and the nine swords race would definitely be able to destroy the Dragon Palace.

“Let’s go, we’ll discuss the details. With the current power of the Dragon Palace, as long as we can persuade the blood evil race, we can totally destroy them.”

The figure in the middle of the skeleton race said and slowly disappeared.

They were very clear about the power of the Dragon Palace. There were more than 20 universe knights and five or six level 2 knights.

This power was very strong, not much weaker than the skeleton race.

However, they were still confident that they could destroy the Dragon Palace.

…

“Dragon King, I can sense some malicious gazes from the skeleton clan. I can sense that they have the bloodline of the Divine Dragon.”

In the sky above the Milky Way, Lei Ming spoke to Wang Xian.

“I can sense it too. The skeleton clan. HMPH, let’s get ready to destroy them.”

Wang Xian’s eyes flashed with a cold look.

The skeleton race exuded some aura. Wang Xian and the rest could sense it.

It was a body made of Divine Dragon’s blood.

God knows how many Asian Dragons had died at their hands.

With the strength of the skeleton race, the Dragon Palace could completely destroy them.

However, what Wang Xian didn’t know was that when he was about to attack the skeleton race, the skeleton race was also preparing to destroy the Dragon Palace.

The storm rose again.
