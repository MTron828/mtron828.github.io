Translator: 549690339

Continuous attacks.

100 infant realm experts released their strongest long-range attack.

Following closely behind, the six half-step immortal God level strange demons released their sharpest attacks!

Terrifying attacks came one after another, especially when the strange demons held immortal God level daggers in their hands.

The terrifying penetration tore through the immortal God’s defense.

After the six half-step immortal God level strange demons were repelled, four white figures appeared once again.

They were still terrifying daggers and sharp attacks.

This time, the middle-aged immortal God’s defense had just been broken through.

“Do you think you can kill me just like that?”

The middle-aged immortal God’s expression changed slightly. The surrounding flames instantly entered his body, and his entire body turned dark red. He contained a terrifying power, like a human-shaped nuclear bomb.

“Bang! Bang! Bang!”

The four daggers landed on the middle-aged immortal God’s body, and they emitted a sound like colliding rocks. However, the immortal God’s weapon grade daggers still entered the middle-aged immortal God’s body.

However, they only entered half an inch, and didn’t cause any harm.

However, even so, the middle-aged immortal god was already bleeding. What was even more terrifying was that the daggers were coated with poison.

Although it was only a grade seven poison medicinal pill, it was still equivalent to receiving a full-strength attack from an infant stage expert!

The middle-aged immortal God’s expression changed slightly.

In a short instant, in less than ten seconds, everyone around was stunned.

The terrifying power and attack caused all the surrounding disciples of the immortal sect to roll and crawl far away.

When they saw the attacks landing on the middle-aged immortal God’s body, their faces revealed shocked expressions.

Especially when the immortal god was bleeding and injured, they were even more shocked.

“That White Shadow, every one of them has the strength of a half-step immortal god, and that terrifying dagger, they are all immortal God artifacts!”

An immortal sect expert widened his eyes and looked at the scene in front of him in shock.

Besieging and killing an immortal God!

This was besieging and killing an immortal God!

“Scram! Scram!”

The middle-aged immortal God became irritable, and his face was extremely ferocious. He waved his arm, and like an unerupted volcano, he swung his body toward the four strange demons.

“Peng Peng Peng Peng!”

Even though the middle-aged immortal god specialized in long-range attacks, his immortal God level fleshly body still caused the four strange monsters to fly backwards.

The might of an immortal god was so terrifying!

“Sou Sou Sou!”

However, what shocked everyone was that when the four white figures flew backwards, another five white figures appeared.

They were still terrifying daggers as they attacked the middle-aged immortal God’s wide open body.

The middle-aged immortal God’s expression changed. His eyes revealed a trace of fear and anxiety!

“Peng Peng Peng!”

Another five daggers landed on the middle-aged immortal God’s arms, chest, back, waist, legs, chest, and back.

This time, the daggers were directly embedded into his body!

The middle-aged immortal God could not help but take two steps back.

“Die!”

He roared with a ferocious expression. Waves of blood accompanied by terrifying flames charged towards the strange monster.

The powerful force instantly caused the five strange monsters to be heavily injured as they flew backwards.

At the same time, his face was deathly pale!

“Stab!”

“Stab!”

The attack was still not over.

In the sky, a metallic cold sound rang out as rays of extreme metallic cold light shot out.

From the front, back, left, right, and in the sky.

The five half-step immortal god Golden Swordfish unleashed their strongest attack.

Stab!

They transformed into the Golden Swordfish’s true form. From the outside, they looked like metal longswords.

The golden light of the longswords was restrained, and the terrifying energy contained within them condensed together.

“No!”

The five continuous waves of attacks finally caused the middle-aged immortal God’s expression to change completely, and fear appeared on his face.

Feeling the last five terrifying metal longswords, his body trembled slightly as he let out a sound of despair.

The Flames burned his body, leaving only a sliver of defense.

“Boom Boom Boom!”

The Golden Swordfish’s attack arrived, causing the ground to explode, and cracks that were thousands of meters wide appeared.

And at the middle-aged immortal God’s original location, a deep pit that was a hundred meters deep appeared.

At this moment, the entire world seemed to have fallen silent.

The disciples of the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect were shocked.

All the surrounding disciples of the immortal sect were also shocked.

They stared blankly at the location of the deep pit, and their hearts chilled.

Those terrifying attacks seemed to be able to destroy the world.

A dignified immortal God had no ability to resist at all.

“Weng Weng!”

At this moment, five figures emitting golden light flew out from the deep pit, and burn marks appeared on their bodies.

However, these burn marks weren’t fatal.

“Boom Boom!”

At this moment, more than a hundred infant realm experts surrounded them, and each of their bodies emitted an icy cold aura.

“DEAD!”

The golden swordfish that flew out said coldly.

Dead!

The two words entered the ears of the surrounding people, and in an instant, everyone’s eyes widened, revealing an expression of disbelief.

Dead, an immortal God actually died.

He was directly killed by the experts of the Dragon Gate.

This was simply too f * cking crazy.

“No... No!”

The bodies of all the disciples of the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect trembled slightly.

They couldn’t believe that an immortal God had been killed. This was an immortal God, an invincible existence in the world.

But now, he had been killed!

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

Terrifying figures flew over from the sky.

The battle between Immortal Gods had attracted many immortal gods.

There were ten immortal gods in total, and ten immortal gods had come from the three great immortal sects in the Yongchang region.

They flew in the air and looked at the immortal gods that had been killed in the deep pit. Each and every one of them sucked in a breath of cold air. Their gazes swept over the hundred or so infant realm experts and the strange demon who was hiding and unstable due to his injuries.

This middle-aged immortal God could be considered as the first immortal God to be killed since the immortal sect had appeared.

In the past, even if there were immortal gods that fought, no immortal gods had died. He was the first.

He didn’t die at the hands of an immortal god, but was attacked and killed by a group of Dragon Gate experts!

“Do you think that with an immortal God following us, we can’t Kill You?”

At this moment, Mo Qinglong turned around and looked at the disciples of the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect with a smile on his face.

“Why did this happen? !”

The disciples of the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect were completely in despair. Some of them even collapsed to the ground, their eyes lifeless and their faces ashen!

“Kill!” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Mo Qinglong did not show any mercy as he waved his arm.

The group of Dragon Gate members instantly took action and were instantly killed!

They could even kill an immortal God, let alone a group of two ordinary disciples of the immortal sect. There were only four infant stage powerhouses.

“Put away the corpses and let’s Go!”

At this moment, Wang Xian and Ao Jian appeared in the sky. They looked down with a smile and said to the group of disciples.

“Yes, Dragon King!”

Mo Qinglong kept the immortal God’s body into his interspatial ring as more than a hundred infant stage experts flew into the sky!

“Today, I can kill the Holy Doctor, Holy Medicine, and Immortal God. In the future, I will be able to completely exterminate them!”
