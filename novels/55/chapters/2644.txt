2645 2645 ultimate treasure

“Grandmaster Di, there’s a young master outside who has delivered a treasure. He said that the effect of this treasure is heaven-defying. As long as a drop of blood is placed on its liquid, the original body will be completely destroyed and it will be able to be resurrected!”

“I can see that it possesses an unbelievable amount of energy. I will come and ask Grandmaster di to appraise it immediately!”

Just as Wang Xian and di Xingnu were conversing outside, the staff member brought the soul-returning liquid to a room at the back and spoke softly!

“Oh? It can be reborn from a drop of blood?”

The room door opened automatically and the staff hurriedly walked in!

In the room, an old man stood up and looked at the staff!

“Grandmaster Di, I don’t understand this treasure. Please appraise it!”

The old man was an appraisal grandmaster of the imperial court. At the same time, he was also the strongest person in the imperial court auction house!

With the strength of an immortal king level 9 and his ability to appraise thousands of items, his position in the imperial court was relatively high!

“So Strange! So Strong!”

Grandmaster di took the soul returning liquid, his eyes gleaming! Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Weng

His arm moved and he took out a book. There were no words on it, however when he placed the soul returning liquid on the tree, words slowly appeared on the book!

“Soul returning liquid, soul returning liquid, such a treasure is rare, it’s equivalent to a Life!”

“Unfortunately, this soul-returning liquid is too little. At most, it can support the revival of experts below the god Emperor Realm!”

“But even so, it’s still a life-saving treasure!”

Grandmaster di muttered as he looked at the soul-returning liquid with burning eyes!

“Such a treasure can be used as the final item. Ask that young master if he still has such a treasure. As long as he has such a treasure, it will definitely be crazily competed for!”

“Forget it, I’ll go over!”

He said immediately!

“Huh?”

“It’s Grandmaster di!”

The staff member at the side was slightly shocked and nodded immediately!

“Young master, this soul-returning liquid was sent by you, right?”

Grandmaster di walked into the hall and looked at Wang Xian and di Xingnu. He asked immediately!

“Grandmaster di!”

Di Xingnu was slightly shocked when she saw the old man and immediately shouted respectfully!

“Yes!”

Grandmaster di nodded his head. His gaze landed on Wang Xian!

“Yes, I wonder if the old man has appraised it?”

Wang Xian nodded his head and asked!

“It’s a life-saving treasure. It’s an ultimate treasure. I wonder if young master doesn’t have such a treasure!”

“Such an ultimate treasure will definitely be auctioned off crazily!”

Grandmaster di said with a smile!

“I only got a drop of the soul-returning liquid back then!”

Wang Xian shook his head and showed a hesitant expression!

“Oh?”

Grandmaster di saw his hesitant expression and his heart skipped a beat. “Young master, don’t worry. The Imperial Court Will Not Covet Young Master Mo’s Treasures. Hehe!”

“When I got this liquid back then, I got a few more types. I don’t know the effects of some of them!”

Wang Xian heard what he said and hesitated for a moment before saying it on purpose!

He took out the Chang ye liquid, eternal flame, Nirvana Lightning liquid, and life force liquid!

“Oh?”

Grandmaster di’s expression changed slightly as he immediately took them out!

“Good, good, good. Such pure flames can change a human’s physique. Such pure lightning can also change a human’s physique. Such spiritual energy can completely awaken the spiritual intelligence of desolate beasts and plants. Such a huge amount of life force. Just a single drop of it can instantly restore a peak immortal king to his peak!”

Grandmaster di’s face was filled with astonishment as his eyes widened!

“These are all Supreme Treasures!”

He exclaimed softly!

When Wang Xian heard his exclamation, his eyes sparkled but he didn’t say a word!

“Young master, if these supreme treasures are auctioned off in our imperial court auction house, other than the soul-returning liquid, we can auction the rest for free! What do you think?”

Grandmaster di said to Wang Xian immediately!

“Sure, but I have a request. I want to use the equivalent amount of abyssal seed corpses or elixirs to settle the account!”

Wang Xian nodded and said!

“There’s no problem with that!”

...

Grandmaster di nodded immediately and waved his arm. “This is your item voucher. This is the box slot for the auction the day after Tomorrow!”

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded and took the box with a smile!

“If young master has any more of these treasures, you can come to our imperial court auction house to auction them off!”

Grandmaster di spoke again!

“Sure, this is all I have!”

Wang Xian smiled and shook his head!

Grandmaster di looked into his eyes and confirmed that what he said was true. He nodded his head slightly as well!

“Wow, Wang Xian, you sure have a lot of good stuff!”

Bei Shuang couldn’t help but exclaim when the two of them came out!

“It’s a pity that I’m not an old man. Otherwise, I would consider keeping you as my mistress!”

...

Wang Xian said with a smile!

“Scram, I’ve recorded your words. I’ll send it to Yinxuan later!”

The Celestial Maiden glared at him!

Wang Xian was speechless!

Wang Xian didn’t go out to take a stroll as he followed bei Shuang back to the Plains!

The next day, he spent the entire day reading the information on his AI!

“That imperial star lady is really so powerful. How is this possible? How can she be so strong?”

While Wang Xian was staying at bei Shuang’s place, a group of women gathered in a side hall in the Majestic Palace of the imperial court and exclaimed in astonishment!

Compared to the central island, the entrance to the Majestic Palace was much stricter!

Staying here required undying level 5 and above strength. As for the women, only the wives and children of undying level 5 and above could stay here!

Of course, when the women reached undying level 5 and above, the imperial court would also have a side hall!

As the saying goes, the imperial court had an outer island with an inner island, and the inner island was divided into a vast palace and an outer island!

This could be said to be a staircase, a circle!

The vast palace was naturally the core layer!

The children of the core younger generation naturally formed a circle and looked down on the disciples outside!

In the side hall, three women sat there with extremely ugly expressions, and the surrounding women were all shocked!

The strength of the three women was not considered weak among them, but they had been defeated by the Imperial Star Lady in one move, causing many people to be shocked!

“That actress seems to have hooked up with the leader of a pretty good force. She must have exchanged some treasures from there!”

The three women said with a gloomy face!

“Green Mountain seems to have paid attention to some information about the imperial star lady in the past. He should know more. I have already asked Green Mountain to come over!”

A woman said with a frown!

“Well, so what if he knows? The competition will be held in two days. When the time comes, the Phoenix will call the nine heavens. No one can stop it!”

In the middle, a woman in snow-white clothes said indifferently. She stood up and walked out, feeling bored!

“Sister Suzhuang, we just want to know how powerful that Imperial Star Lady is. However, the imperial star Lady of our generation will definitely belong to you, Sister Suzhuang!”

Some of the women immediately said when they saw the woman in snow-white clothes leave!

“Of course!”

The snow-white dress woman body paused, indifferently said!
