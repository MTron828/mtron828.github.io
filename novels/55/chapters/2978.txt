Chapter 2979: Becoming a Dragon Knight in 1979? 5

The four-armed race!

When the two members of the three-eyed race saw them, their expressions were abnormally ugly.

The four-armed race and the three-eyed race belonged to the weaker races. The distance between the two races wasn’t too far.

Although they were both large human races and didn’t have any conflicts, seeing the four-armed race arrive at this time was undoubtedly the worst thing for them.

Yang Feng and Yang Xiaohun stared at the four-armed race with gloomy faces, their eyes shining.

“A deacon of the four-armed race!”

Sensing the power of the four-armed old man in the middle, their hearts sank.

If the other party was weaker than them, they would not hesitate to kill him directly.

But now, it was obvious that they did not have the strength.

This made their expressions even more awkward.

They kept changing.

“That is? A member of the three-eyed race. Why is there a member of the three-eyed race here?”

At this moment, when the four-armed race saw the two members of the three-eyed race, their expressions changed.

The leader, Deacon Qian, stared at Yang Feng, his eyes shining.

The atmosphere instantly became strange.

“What… What’s going on? Why are there suddenly so many four-armed humans? When did such humans appear in our resplendent starry sky?”

“They have such powerful auras. The weakest ones are at the peak of the godly monarch realm. There are also the dozen or so elders in front. Their auras are even more terrifying!”

“Look at the two people on the other side who make the eight desolates and the godly monarchs respect them. They have three eyes!”

“Where did this group of people come from? They look so terrifying!”

On the nine destruction planet, all the experts looked over and were shocked when they saw the two special humans.

“Look at the three-eyed human. The expert from the Dragon Palace is completely trapped and can’t move!”

“The Lord from the Dragon Palace seems to have the strength of a god-emperor. He can’t resist the three-eyed human at all. What realm are they at? How can they be so powerful?”

“Hiss, I’m afraid something bad is going to happen!”

Everyone’s hearts were beating violently. The group of people in front of them gave them a bad premonition.

“Four-armed race, why are you all here?”

At this moment, Yang Feng’s voice sounded. He stared coldly at everyone from the four-armed race and said with a gloomy expression.

“We also want to ask, how did your three-eyed race come here?”

Deacon Qian of the four-armed race asked with a solemn expression.

“This is an opportunity that belongs to our three-eyed race!”

Yang Xiaohun said while gritting his teeth.

“Don’t you find it ridiculous to say this?”

Deacon Qian of the four-armed race said coldly.

His words made the two of them from the three-eyed race clench their fists tightly.

“They are the same? Experts from the center of the Universe?”

Desolate god Emperor Lord and the others watched as the hearts of everyone from the four-armed race pounded violently. Cold sweat appeared on their faces.

They could feel a stifling pressure from the other party.

From what they could sense, the weakest among the tens of thousands of people was a Type 8 divine king expert. What kind of concept was that?

“That Dragon Palace belongs to us!”

Yang Feng said coldly.

“Hahaha, three-eyed race, you’re thinking too much. I was going to say that the divine dragon is our Mount!”

Deacon Qian of the four-armed race laughed sinisterly as he swept his gaze across all of them. “With your strength, you don’t have the qualifications to contend against us. Get out of here as soon as possible.”

“What? Four-armed race? The experts of our race are rushing over here. It’s impossible for you to chase us away!”

Yang Feng spoke on purpose.

As his words fell, both parties stared at each other.

“Hong!”

Slowly, waves of incomparably terrifying aura shot out from their bodies.

The Aura that belonged to a rank five void God emperor carried the wind and clouds as it charged forward.

A soundless explosion sounded in the middle of them.

Sensing the collision of their auras, the expressions of the eight desolate god Emperors changed drastically as they hurriedly hid to the side.

“Fourth Level God-emperor? or fifth level?”

“The resplendent starry sky has never produced such a terrifying expert!”

Cold sweat appeared on the foreheads of the desolate god-emperor lord and the others, and they felt their hearts palpitate.

“Hiss!”

On the nine annihilation planet, everyone felt the collision of these terrifying auras. Hearing their words, their faces revealed an extremely shocked expression.

That terrifying aura made everyone feel extremely small.

Even the godly monarch experts paled.

This Aura was invincible in their eyes.

And what they said.

The Dragon Palace belonged to them?

The Godly Dragon was their mount?

They came for the Dragon Palace?

Where did they come from?

Could it be the other side of the eight desolate six directions?

Their arrogant words didn’t put the Dragon Palace in their eyes at all.

In addition, a rank one divine emperor of the Dragon Palace was easily restrained. This scene shocked them to the extreme.

When their auras collided, both Deacon Qian of the four-armed race and Yang Feng of the three-eyed race had ugly expressions on their faces.

This was because they knew that they couldn’t take down the other party with his strength.

In that case, they could either rely on their own abilities to snatch him, or…

“We have to report this matter to the clan leader and the others. Tell them to hurry over.”

Yang Feng’s face was gloomy as he transmitted his voice to Yang Xiaohun.

At this moment, they could no longer monopolize this opportunity.

Yang Xiaohun nodded. He understood in his heart and immediately sent out a message.

Deacon Qian noticed their actions and his expression changed slightly.

“Everyone from the three-eyed race, let’s rely on our own abilities!”

Deacon Qian narrowed his eyes and said.

“Since we rely on our own abilities… then let’s rely on our own abilities!”

Yang Feng replied coldly and waved his arm.

“Ka Ka Ka!”

Four Wolf Beasts with four heads appeared in front of him.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

“Roar Roar Roar!”

The moment the four-headed wolf beast appeared, it immediately raised its head and let out a roar. A terrifying aura rushed out!

“Fortunately, I brought the four ferocious wolves from my race here in order to search for treasures. Otherwise, I would be in trouble!”

Yang Feng secretly rejoiced in his heart when the fourth level Divine Emperor Wolf Beast appeared in the Void.

“If you follow us, our three-eyed race will not mistreat you!”

Yang Xiao Hun said to the eight desolate divine emperors.

The expressions of the desolate divine emperor Lord and the others changed. They did not dare to reject him at this moment. They gritted their teeth and nodded.

The atmosphere became even more solemn as the two sides faced off.

Deacon Qian of the four-armed race’s expression changed slightly when he saw the three-eyed race bringing four rank four divine emperor Wolf Beasts.

The difference in strength between the two sides was not that great!

Neither side would win if they were to fight.

“We’ll rely on our own abilities.”

“Take down the dragon palace and subdue all the divine dragons. Let’s Move!”

Deacon Qian narrowed his eyes and ordered his subordinate beside him. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Xiao Hun, lead the four Wolf Beasts and the people from the eight desolate to subdue all the divine dragons and occupy the Dragon Palace!”

Yang Feng immediately ordered Yang Xiao Hun.

“Yes!”

“Yes!”

Yang Xiao Hun and the people on the other side answered at the same time.

Yang Feng and deacon Qian hovered in the air and didn’t move.

They were waiting for the experts of their race to arrive.

The two of them restrained each other.

The rest of the people went to hunt the Dragon Palace, occupy it, and subdue the divine dragons.

“Roar!”

At this moment, the restrained mad dragon let out an angry roar and started to resist desperately.

“Noisy!”

Yang Feng waved his arm and killed the MAD Dragon and the other members of the Dragon Palace.

“Attack!”

Yang Xiaohun growled and flew toward the Dragon Palace, followed by the four Wolf Beasts and all the experts of the desolate land.

“Do it!”

The experts of the four-armed race also started to fly toward the Dragon Palace.

Then, they started to fight for treasures!

Fight for the Dragon Palace!

Fight for the Divine Dragon!
