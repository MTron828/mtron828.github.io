Chapter 1647: 1547 went in alone

“Thank you, young master Wang, for coming to help us this time. Let me bring you to the front of the battlefield. The information you need is there!”

“If you still need anything, just tell me, this old woman!”

Feng Yun looked at Wang Xian and thanked him from the bottom of her heart.

“Alright, let’s Go Now!”

Wang Xian nodded.

“Let’s Go!”

Feng Yun nodded his head and gestured to them. Then, he waved his arm.

The scene changed and they were in the sky above the fiery cloud mountain range. Feng Yun waved his arm again and brought them forward.

After teleporting for five consecutive times, Wang Xian and the rest appeared in front of a mountain peak at the front of the fiery cloud mountain range.

In front of the mountain peak, there was an incomparably huge city. There were over ten million people in the city.

Currently, the entire city was surrounded by a formation. Only the huge city gate in front of them was open. People with a murderous aura were coming in and out of the city.

“These are the two sects that are attached to our fire cloud sparrow. They are not weak either!”

Feng Yun explained to Wang Xian. Following that, she moved and brought him into the last fire cloud mountain.

Flames enveloped the area. They stepped across a river of lava and entered the foot of the mountain.

“There’s an information department in front. All the information regarding the life and Death Pill Workshop, the forging workshop for holy items, and the war will be sent here!”

“These information are real-time. Basically, they can be guaranteed to be accurate. If young master Wang wants to see any information, just tell the person inside!”

Feng Yun and the rest brought Wang Xian inside!

“Patriarch, Queen, Clan Elder!”

After they entered, the firecloud Sparrow’s clansmen hurriedly shouted respectfully.

“Do Your Thing!”

The firecloud Queen waved at them.

“Young master Wang, let Huoguduo follow you for the next period of time. If you need anything, just tell her directly!”

Feng Yun brought him to the information department to take a look before instructing a woman behind him.

“Young master Wang!”

The woman at level nine of the Seethrough realm shouted at Wang Xian.

“Alright, I’ll take a look at the information here first. You guys go ahead and do what you need to do!”

Wang Xian nodded and said to them.

“Alright!”

Feng Yun nodded.

Wang Xian didn’t stand on ceremony and walked straight in. He asked for all the information about the war, the life and Death Pill Workshop, and the holy item forging workshop.

The woman called Huo Guduo stood at the side.

Feng Yun and the rest took a look at Wang Xian before leaving.

“Young master Wang is here. I wonder if you can alleviate the plight of our fire cloud sparrow!”

All the higher-ups of the fire cloud sparrow came to a room and the Queen of Fire Cloud said slowly.

“As long as nothing happens to young master Wang, it’s fine. We don’t ask for anything else. The empress still needs him!”

Feng Yun waved her hand and said.

All the higher-ups of the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan nodded their heads. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

They didn’t expect young master Wang to be able to help them too much. All they wanted was to be safe.

Their empress still needed young master Wang’s help.

Wang Xian wasn’t too surprised by the attitude of the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan towards him.

He sat at the position of the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan’s information department and checked all the resources. Information was imprinted into his mind one by one.

This gave him a detailed understanding of this war.

This war was no longer an ordinary battle. It involved a radius of tens of thousands of kilometers and involved billions of people.

After all, this was a battle between the top forces under the transcendent continent Empire.

The Life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop had deep financial resources. At present, the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan had always been at a disadvantage.

With the addition of the Holy Fire clan, the situation had eased up a lot.

The Life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop didn’t want to become mortal enemies with the Holy Fire clan.

The Holy Fire clan didn’t want to bear the name of being ungrateful, so they only sent a few people to brush it off.

As the situation eased up, it turned into sneak attacks and assassinations, which were no more harmful than large-scale direct collisions.

This also caused the major factions to treat this place as a training ground for their disciples.

The Life and Death Pill Workshop and the holy item forging workshop even evaluated and rewarded their disciples based on the number of fire lark disciples they had killed.

After reading through these basic information, Wang Xian went through all the information on the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop again.

In his heart, he had a detailed understanding of the following actions.

“Young master Wang, you’ve been watching for more than ten hours. Do you want to eat something?”

When Wang Xian got up and walked out, elder Huoguduo walked over and asked.

“There’s no need. I’ll make a trip to the city. Oh right, Elder Huoguduo, find me a place to stay. After I come back, I’ll go straight to my place!”

Wang Xian said to her.

“Alright, Young Master Wang. The third cave on the mountain peak is where you’ll be staying. There’s a maid at the entrance while I’m next door. If you need anything, just let the maid call me!”

Elder Huo Guduo pointed to a spot and said to Wang Xian.

“Okay!”

Wang Xian nodded and flew straight into the city.

Looking at the entire huge city, most of the people inside were filled with killing intent.

Wang Xian walked towards the exit. At the entrance of the city, some people were forming teams while others were looking for teammates.

There were dozens of people who went out of the city to hunt for enemies.

Outside the city, there was a hunting battlefield with a radius of a few thousand kilometers.

The members of the fire lark tribe and the forces that were affiliated with the fire lark could also obtain huge rewards for killing enemies.

“Let’s improve my strength first!”

Wang Xian walked out of the city gate and looked ahead. A forest appeared in his line of sight.

The forest was a fiery-red tree. It was known as the fire cloud forest.

The fire cloud forest covered an area of 3,000 kilometers. There were fiery beasts living in it.

This place was originally the Backyard Garden of the Fire Cloud Sparrow tribe. There were many spiritual herbs planted in it.

Now that the life and Death Elixir Workshop and the holy item forging workshop had attacked this place, this place had become the main battlefield.

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian moved his body and flew straight to the front.

He flew straight to the void that was tens of thousands of meters away. He concealed himself and dashed forward at a fast speed.

For the time being, Wang Xian didn’t plan to mobilize all the strange beasts. He wanted to enter the city of the life and Death Elixir Workshop and the holy item forging workshop to obtain some information.

According to the information of the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan, the city more than 3,000 kilometers away was a base of the two major forces.

If the people from the two major forces wanted to attack the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan, they would have to stop here.

Now, that place had become their supply station.

As a supply station on the battlefield, the number of elixirs there had definitely reached an extremely high level.

Wang Xian wanted to get his hands on those resources.

He would plunder the resources in the early stages to increase his and the strange demon’s strength. After that, he would have a good time playing with them.

Wang Xian looked down at the front with a hint of coldness on his face.

“Are we almost there?”

Looking at the huge city in front of him, the corner of Wang Xian’s mouth curled up slightly.

Issuing missions and recruiting mercenary groups to hunt members of the fire lark tribe could reduce the loss of his own personnel. However, there was also a disadvantage.

That was that it was difficult to manage.

There were many people entering and exiting the city gates. Wang Xian walked in without any scruples.

He went in alone!
