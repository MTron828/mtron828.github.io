Chapter 2922: 2,922 Dragon Palace’s Shocking Decision 2

The existence of the machine royal territory had always been a threat to mankind.

When they were weak, they had been developing in seclusion. Later on, they gradually became stronger and wanted to invade the glazed domain.

However, the glazed domain was the largest domain in the resplendent void space. They had an extremely deep foundation and many experts. The machine royal territory had never been able to succeed.

Furthermore, as the surroundings of the mechanical imperial region were vast and boundless void space, they could only enter the other great regions in the resplendent starry space by breaking through the glass region.

This also resulted in the mechanical imperial region wanting to destroy the glass region.

This was especially so since the glass region was rich in resources. It had the glass dual-colored stones and five-colored stones that the mechanical imperial region coveted.

As long as there were sufficient glass dual-colored stones, the creator could create powerful god Emperor level robots.

With the colored stones, they would be able to create even stronger robots.

At the first opportunity, the mechanical imperial region wanted to attack the colored glass region.

“Dragon King, this way please!”

Following the domain Lord and the rest to a large hall, the domain lord gestured toward the center.

Wang Xian nodded and sat down. The domain Lord sat beside him while the rest of the celestial thearch sat around him.

“Dragon King, we have no choice but to ask the Dragon Palace for help this time around. I believe that you have some understanding of the situation in our colored glass region now.”

“We are grateful that the Dragon Palace is willing to help. We can give you a portion of the reward in advance.”

The governor sat down and said to Wang Xian directly.

“Hehe, I still believe in your glazed domain. I didn’t bring any subordinates this time. I’ll have to trouble the governor to give me a planet with an ocean. I’ll build a teleportation formation on the planet.”

“According to the situation in the Liu Li region, our dragon palace can send more experts over at any time to help Liu Li get through this crisis.”

Wang Xian said with a smile.

“Oh? The Dragon Palace’s array formation is really powerful. They can build a teleportation formation even from such a long distance. The planet is a small matter. I’ll send someone to send the order immediately and bring it over quickly.”

The governor nodded in surprise.

“I wonder if the governor wants us to help deal with the chimei territory or help defend against the machine royal territory?”

Wang Xian asked the governor.

“Dragon King, this is all the information on the Chimei territory and machine royal territory. You can take a look at it yourself. When the time comes, you can make your own choice, Dragon Palace.”

The governor said with a smile and passed the artificial intelligence to him.

Wang Xian took it and opened the artificial intelligence. The first thing he did was to look at the information regarding the chimei territory.

This time around, he was more inclined to hunt down the demons of the chimei territory.

The more members of the Dragon Palace were killed, the more rewards the Dragon Palace would obtain.

“Eh? I didn’t expect the chimei territory to be so strong!”

When Wang Xian saw the information regarding the chimei territory, he was astonished.

The information on the AI was much more detailed than the information obtained by the Dragon Palace.

The Dragon Palace only got a rough idea of the information. As the glazed domain, they had detailed information. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

They had countless scouts entering the chimei territory to investigate the situation.

According to the information, the glazed domain had detected more than twenty celestial thearch-level demonic beasts.

This was only what they had discovered. There were still many things that they had not discovered.

However, the evil god Emperor of the chimei domain did not mean that all of them had invaded the veluriyam domain.

Currently, only a dozen or so evil god emperors and their races had invaded the veluriyam domain.

However, ever since the Great War, more and more evil god Emperors had brought the Devil Den to participate. The veluriyam domain had become increasingly worried.

“The evil demons of the glazed domain can be summoned to another void. Not long ago, we discovered that the summoned evil demons had returned one by one. Furthermore, many of them have terrifying strength.”

“In just a short period of time, the chimei domain has added more than ten evil demon god emperors and their races. This is a huge threat to our glazed domain.”

“Furthermore, according to the information we received, there is a demon cave in the center of the Chimei region. There is a terrifying demonic being in that demon cave. Its strength should be at the third level void God Emperor Realm.”

“That demonic god Emperor has no signs of invading our glazed region at the moment. After considering everything, we have decided to request for reinforcements from the Dragon Palace’s holy region.”

The domain Lord said directly.

Wang Xian nodded slightly. The glazed domain was naturally more worried about a terrifying existence appearing next door to his house.

After looking at the information on the chimei domain, Wang Xian flipped through the information on the Machine Emperor Domain.

Liu Li was also very familiar with the machine emperor domain.

The greatest threat to the Machine Emperor Domain was the creator. He was the ruler of the entire machine emperor domain.

The mechanical imperial region’s robots were upgraded through various materials and treasures. They could not cultivate.

However, they were very powerful. Their army had absolute rational combat strength and terrifying calculation ability.

They also had countless battleships and fighter jets.

Their battleships and fighter jets were like a special life form because their essence was the same as the robots. They had their own intelligence.

The automatons did not have any weaknesses. They were very strong.

According to the governor’s guess, the creator’s strength was only slightly weaker than his.

However, they did not know exactly how strong he was. They had not fought for tens of millions of years.

The glazed domain guessed that the automatons’strength was a level lower than theirs. There were also about twenty divine emperor-level existences.

From the information, the strength of the mechanical imperial region and the chimei domain were not much different.

The difference was that the chimei territory had yet to invade completely.

“Dragon King, you can consider it. Regardless of which one you are going up against, our glazed domain will be the main force. The Dragon Palace only needs to provide support.”

The governor said.

“Alright.”

Wang Xian nodded. He was not in a hurry. He would make a decision after the experts from the Dragon Palace arrived and understood the situation.

However, in fact, Wang Xian already had a choice in his heart.

“Dragon King, a planet has been prepared!”

After chatting with the domain Lord for dozens of minutes, a celestial emperor walked in. He nodded at the domain Lord and said to Wang Xian.

“Alright, I’ll head over now. Lead the way!”

Wang Xian stood up immediately and said.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

The celestial emperor nodded and everyone flew out.

The Life Planet was moved to a location not far away from this war continent by the glazed experts. Wang Xian looked over and immediately flew over.

This was a relatively backward planet. There were some animals living on it and they were very weak.

Wang Xian’s body moved and landed in the ocean.

The domain Lord and the rest were floating in the sky and waiting quietly.

“Build a Dragon Palace!”

Wang Xian entered the ocean and immediately built a dragon palace.

He entered the teleportation formation and returned to the Dragon Palace in an instant.

“Prime Minister Gui, bring out the 20 celestial emperors from the Dragon Palace and get ready.”

Wang Xian immediately ordered.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Prime Minister Gui nodded immediately. Soon, AO qitian, Ao Qi, ao chi, Ao Qi, ao hai, Ba Qi, Mo Sha, and the other three who were more active among the wind god Dragons followed him.

“Let’s go and check out the situation.”

Wang Xian said to them. Prime Minister Gui followed them into the teleportation formation.
