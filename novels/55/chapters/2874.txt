Chapter 2875: imperial court’s Shamans Association and Bhang’s warning

“We’re also afraid that we’ll have a conflict with the holy region in the future.”

Bhang’s divine emperor also spoke indifferently to the Holy Master and the others.

Their words made the Holy Master and the other Divine Emperors’expressions turn a little ugly.

They looked coldly at divine emperor Shenwu and Bhang’s divine emperor.

If it wasn’t for the fact that they represented three forces that weren’t weaker than them, or even much stronger than them, they would have already been enraged.

“The matter between me and the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace has nothing to do with the Holy Region.”

Hong Fengyan stared at the two of them and said expressionlessly.

“Oh? Xiaoyan, let’s not get involved in their matters.”

The Holy Master said to Hong Fengyan after hearing her words.

“Holy Master, the reason why I was able to break through this time was all thanks to the help of the Dragon King.”

Hong Fengyan said to the Holy Master.

“So, does that mean that God Emperor Hong Feng is going to participate in the matters between us and the Dragon Palace?”

God Emperor Shenwu slightly narrowed his eyes and asked Hong Fengyan.

“What’s going on? Why did the divine emperor of the imperial court, the eight barrens god Emperor, suddenly come over? How did it involve God Emperor Hong Feng?”

“What are they doing here? Are they warning us of the Holy Region?”

“What happened to God Emperor Hong Feng at the eight Barrens and six directions? Today is the great ceremony of God Emperor Hong Feng’s ascension. are the imperial court and the eight barrens god Emperor here to deliberately look for trouble? Outrageous!”

Today, the ceremony of God Emperor Hong Feng’s ascension had gathered hundreds of millions of people. All the experts of the entire holy region had come to worship him.

However, the scene in front of them caused the expressions of everyone in the Holy Region to change.

The already joyous day made them feel that the atmosphere was somewhat heavy.

Some people were discussing in low voices, and their expressions were somewhat ugly.

“If the Dragon Palace needs it, I will naturally participate.”

Hong Fengyan stared at them and said indifferently.

The moment she finished speaking, the expressions of everyone around her changed slightly. Even the sacred Lord’s expression sank.

“Haha, God Emperor Hong Feng, you have to think carefully. Now that the Dragon Palace is enemies with the three great factions, you have just become a god Emperor. Today is also the day of your coronation. If you want to stand together with the Dragon Palace, even if you become a god Emperor, your days will be numbered.”

“It’s not good to have good news and loss next to each other. Isn’t it good to be your divine emperor in the sacred region?”

When divine emperor Shen Wu heard her words, his expression instantly turned cold. He spoke without concealing the threat in his words.

“Both of you, watch your words!”

When the sacred master heard their words, an unhappy expression appeared on her face. She indifferently raised the scepter in her hand and knocked it.

“Sacred master, we didn’t mean to offend you. I’m sure the sacred region understands the situation between us and the Dragon Palace. Whoever gets involved will be our enemy.”

“Our imperial court, the Magus Union, and eight desolates don’t want to be enemies with the sacred region. That’s why we’re here today and are sending you a congratulatory gift!”

Eight desolates’divine emperor cupped his hands towards the sacred master and said sincerely.

“I can make it clear in advance that the Holy Region will definitely not participate in the matter between the Dragon Palace and the three major forces.”

The sacred master said indifferently and looked at Hong Fengyan, “I will also try my best not to let people from the holy region participate in it.”

“We are relieved with your words, sacred master. The three major forces also want to become friends with the Holy Region!”

Shenwu divine emperor and bhang divine emperor cupped their hands and smiled.

“Hehe, the two of you are guests. Let’s have some fun here for a few days.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

The holy master said politely.

“Haha, Alright, Alright. Then we’ll stay here for two days before leaving. We’ll also report to the emperor and wizard Lord Desolate.”

The two laughed.

“Holy Master, I…”

“Alright!”

Hong Fengyan wanted to say something, but was interrupted by the Saint Lord.

“The ceremony, continue!”

The Saint Lord said lightly.

The Divine Emperor Wu and the divine emperor of the eight barrens looked at each other and sat to the side.

“Divine Emperor Shangshui, I think you won’t be involved in the matters between us and the Dragon Palace, right?”

The two walked to the side and looked at the Divine Emperor Shangshui who was sitting next to them. They asked with a smile.

“Hehe, I, Shangshui, have not joined any faction. Naturally, I will not participate in any faction’s matters.”

The god Emperor of Shangshui replied indifferently.

“That’s good, that’s good. However, please take good care of your disciple, God Emperor of Shangshui.”

The God Emperor of the eight desolates nodded, glanced at invincible battle technique and said.

When invincible battle technique heard this, he immediately lowered his head and mouthed!

F * ck!

However, he did not dare to speak at this time.

They even dared to warn the red wind divine emperor, let alone him.

The Red Wind Divine Emperor had a great force like the Holy Region, and he only had one master.

“Don’t worry, I will teach this stubborn disciple a good lesson.”

The shangshui divine emperor nodded.

He did not dare to argue with the two people who represented the three great forces.

“This… This seems to be the Dragon King whom our red wind divine emperor got to know in the eight barrens and six directions. However, that Dragon King actually offended eight barrens and even killed a divine emperor of eight barrens!”

“How did the Dragon Palace Offend Eight Barrens again? Eight Barrens’divine emperor is very powerful. He has more than ten divine emperors. Most importantly, they are already mortal enemies with the imperial court. Now that they have offended a huge force, are they courting death?”

“They actually dragged our divine emperor red wind into this. The imperial court and eight Desolation’s divine emperor are clearly here to warn us.”

“The three major factions in the resplendent starry skies. From the looks of it, these three major factions might have already joined forces to deal with the Dragon Palace. The Dragon Palace is going to be finished!”

“Damn it. What a joyous day. The imperial court’s Magus Union and eight desolation have messed it up.”

Below, the saint realm experts and disciples who had come to participate in the celebration were discussing in low voices.

The celebration continued. Five hours later, the group of God Emperors left. What followed was a carnival for the saint realm disciples.

However, this carnival had greatly reduced the atmosphere because of the arrival of the imperial court and Bhang God Emperor.

“Xiao Yan, don’t get involved in the matter between the Dragon Palace and the imperial court, the Magus Union, and bhang. It’s obvious that the three major factions have already joined forces. It’s very likely that the Dragon Palace will be destroyed!”

In a large hall behind them, the five divine emperors of the Holy Region and Hong Fengyan were sitting inside.

The Sacred Master looked at Hong Fengyan and reminded her.

“Sacred Master, the reason why I was able to advance to the divine emperor realm was all because of the Dragon King’s guidance.”

Hong Fengyan lowered her head slightly and said.

“Then will I have to pay the price with my life? If these three factions join forces, how will the Dragon Palace defend against them?”

“In the end, even if the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace doesn’t die, you will be doomed if you join in!”

The Sacred Master Glared at him and reprimanded him sternly.

Hong Fengyan lowered her head and clenched her fists slightly.

“You can not participate in this matter. It was not easy for our sacred region to give birth to a divine emperor like you. I do not wish for anything to happen. Our sacred region will not participate in any disputes.”

“You must consider everything clearly!”

The Holy Master reminded Hong Fengyan as his figure disappeared.
