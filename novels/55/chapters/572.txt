Chapter 573: Unparalleled In Refining Elixir Pills And Equipment (2)

The crowd of female disciples from Mt. Xue were utterly bewildered upon hearing the words from the two disciples of Yong Chang Immortal Sect.

In fact, they would have just lashed out saying that this was an errant shop had it not been for their Great Senior Sister.

But even then, the disciples began to talk amongst themselves with some even wanting out! ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Just give it another ten minutes, and you’ll see!”

Piao Lingxue chided, which shushed the crowd of Mt. Xue disciples immediately.

After all, Piao Lingxue remained a highly prestigious figure back at Mt. Xue!

“I wonder if he’ll actually chomp the sword down, should we really refine a piece of Spiritual Equipment by waiting for just another ten minutes!” Mu Wanbai uttered in a hushed tone. She had lost all good impressions of this Senior Brother Ye Feng during their interaction within an hour.

“Hehe, Junior Sister Wanbai. Let’s put it this way. Even if he’s a deity, it’s impossible for him to refine and come up with Spiritual Equipment of Level 11 in ten minutes!”

With a cold laugh, Ye Feng sneered at Mu Wanbai with certainty after hearing her comments.

“Then we shall wait and see!” Mu Wanbai rebuked as she eyed Ye Feng.

“I’m more interested in this so-called blacksmith master, and what tricks he has up his sleeve!” Ye Feng replied.

He was somewhat convinced by Piao Lingxue by the latter’s mention of the presence of a blacksmith master where they were right now.

But, he was now in complete disbelief after seeing the humble shop for himself, along with the young man inside. All the more so as the young man boasted of being able to refine Level 11 Spiritual Equipment in ten minutes.

With arms akimbo, Ye Feng stood watching nonchalantly.

The atmosphere was somewhat tense right then as silence filled the crowd.

Ten minutes was an extremely short period to speak of!

Meanwhile, Wang Xian was located on the second floor as he looked at the remaining metal with pleasant surprise.

“These metals are enough to construct a long sword along with another dagger! Such a bonus!” Wang Xian chirped excitedly.

A piece of Level 11 Spiritual Equipment could fetch up to fifteen thousand Spiritual Stones, given the market rates.

Meaning to say, upon completion of this sword, he would then have gained twenty thousand Spiritual Stones which would allow him to purchase a Level 6 Elixir Pill.

A Level 6 Elixir Pill could help Wang Xian gain more than a hundred thousand Dragon Energy.

These were but the benefits from a mere business deal.

“Upon ascension to Level 9, my future is bright!” Wang Xian exclaimed with glistening eyes.

“Form!” he commanded while eyeing the Spiritual Equipment in front of him.

Swoosh!

The long sword let out a crisp clang while Wang Xian beamed with satisfaction.

“Exactly ten minutes!” he chimed.

Zing!

With a swing of his arm, the long sword before him went flying downstairs.

Zoom!

A swishing sound descended from the second floor.

“What’s that?” the crowd asked in confusion as they remained standing within the shop. With the utmost vigilance, some of the disciples even braced themselves by clutching onto their long swords as they saw the flying sword approaching.

As it neared, the long sword spun in a circle before it halted right in front of Bei Ling.

Everyone was stunned. They stared at the long sword which hung in suspension before Bei Ling in utter astonishment.

“The Level 11 Spiritual Equipment for this lady is ready!”

Just then, a faint call could be heard coming from the level above.

“It’s...It’s ready?” Bei Ling stuttered with a look of disbelief as she gazed intently at the long sword before her.

Everyone all around focused their gaze on this long sword.

The long sword shimmered. Its entire body boasted a dazzling shine and appeared incredibly sharp.

Bei Ling looked on with euphoria. With a swing of her arm, she grabbed onto the sword handle.

Zing!

Blinding blue rays gushed up the sword as she held onto it.

With a slight shift of her energy focus, it led to a series of ripples from the blue energy of the sword.

“Level 11 Spiritual Equipment! A piece of Level 11 Spiritual Equipment indeed!”

Bei Ling cried out at the top of her lungs while her eyes became fired up with rhapsody. “What’s more, this long sword fits my exact description, in length, width and weight. Good sword, a good sword indeed!”

“What?”

Everyone questioned with looks of disbelief upon hearing Bei Ling’s words.

“How’s this possible? How long has it been? To think... a piece of Level 11 Spiritual Equipment has since been refined and ready?”

“Goodness, such blinding Aqua Rays. No doubt a Level 11 Spiritual Equipment!”

“A blacksmith master indeed!”

The crowd of disciples gushed in cries of awe and astonishment.

“It’s only natural. Should I be deceiving you otherwise?” Wang Xian smiled to the crowd as he descended from the level above.

Meanwhile, Ye Feng and several youths from the Yong Chang Immortal Sect were absolutely stunned.

“This, this...,” they uttered while gazing at the Spiritual Sword in disbelief.

“Ten minutes, it can’t be. This is absolutely impossible!”

Ye Feng let out a low growl in utter skepticism. To refine and create Spiritual Equipment in ten minutes was something he found to be impossible regardless of who it was.

“Hehe, it’s impossible for you guys. But that doesn’t mean it’s impossible for me!” Wang Xian said to Ye Feng rather indifferently.

Ye Feng stood dazed for a moment while staring at Wang Xian intently. He had a burning desire to rebuke the latter.

Yet, he had no idea how to go about with his rebuttal given that the length, width, and weight of the long sword fit the exact descriptions set forth by Bei Ling.

“Could it be that he’s really able to refine Level 11 Spiritual Equipment in ten minutes?” Ye Feng muttered with a gloomy expression. He gazed at the long sword and let out a deep sigh.

At the sight, Mu Wanbai was slightly tickled.

“See what I mean. This shop may be very miserly, but it really does house a blacksmith master!” She chuckled as if to say that she had really been honest with them.

A faint grin stretched across Piao Lingxue’s face.

Upon the sight, Wang Xian broke into a brief smile.

“Should any of you still wish to refine more Spiritual Equipment, just pass me the materials and state your requirements!” he said to the rest of the crowd.

“Me, I want to refine Spiritual Equipment!”

“Me too, me too!”

“I’d like to have a sword refined as well, handsome Master!”

In an instant, the crowd of Mt. Xue disciples was driven into a craze upon the sight of the Level 11 Spiritual Equipment which Bei Ling was holding.

To have a customized weapon made by a Master Blacksmith free of charge.

Such a great deal was one in a million within the entire Yong Chang fraternity.

“Huh? That’s quite a few!”

Wang Xian gasped with a glow in his eyes when he saw the group of girls closing in with various materials in hand.

But, rather than the materials, Wang Xian was more interested in Spiritual Grasses.

“There are too many of you. Can you all find paper and pen and write your requirements down before passing the materials to me? In addition, is there anyone who wants to refine Elixir Pills? If so, that’ll take three portions of materials, and I’ll give you four Elixir Pills!” Wang Xian called out to the crowd.

“Are you also an alchemist master, handsome Master?”

Upon hearing Wang Xian’s words, one of the girls could not help but blurt her question out.

In an instant, the girl’s question also caught the attention of the rest as Piao Lingxue and Mu Wanbai gazed intently at Wang Xian.

“Yes!” Wang Xian answered without the slightest hesitation.

“I’m able to refine all Elixir Pills below Level 12, and the price I offer is much more affordable than the other Elixir stores!” he added.

Tsk!

The crowd gasped and took one deep breath right after Wang Xian had finished his line.

“How ... How’s this possible! Are you really a wicked genius? How can one be both a Master Alchemist and a Master Blacksmith all at once!?” the same girl from earlier exclaimed with a shaking voice while the rest of the girls stared at Wang Xian in both shock and awe.

In response, Wang Xian only smiled briefly. “Perhaps, an unprecedented genius who’s unparalleled in refining elixir pills and equipment really does exist in this world!”
