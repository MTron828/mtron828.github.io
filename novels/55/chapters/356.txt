Chapter 357: Immortal Jellyfish (1)

Boom, boom, boom!

Pat, pat, pat!

The sky above the seas was capricious. As a thunderstorm raged without the slightest warning, it poured rain water on the entire ocean.

Within the ocean somewhere along the Eastern Sea, Wang Xian was maneuvering his huge body underwater, while staring coldly at the world before him.

As the rain continued to rage, it sent crashing waves while throwing the world above into darkness. Yet, underwater, all was still and calm.

The waves had not been tidal, hence they did not give rise to any ripples underwater.

Somewhere ahead, the entire sea had been brightly lit by the jellyfish, which came in colors of all sorts and appeared very dreamy.

Alongside were numerous seamounts, looking all vast and imposing.

Wang Xian looked on with narrowed eyes as he swept his gaze back. “Occupy this place, and build the palace!” he ordered.

“Yes, Dragon King!” the group of Dragon Palace members replied as they gazed off in preparation.

“Let’s go!” Wang Xian gestured. With quick reflexes, he shifted himself and charged forward, oozing a dignified air of the Divine Dragon as he did.

Following behind, Prime Minister Turtle and other members displayed a menacing stance as they charged like an imposing army troop.

Pat, pat, pat!

Before Wang Xian and gang could approach, sounds of gushing water emerged. Jellyfishes began to rise above the more than twenty seamounts, swaying their countless tentacles along.

Their pace was somewhat slow, but visually aesthetic, as each tentacle shimmered with lights.

The sloshing of water had come from the largest jellyfish located in the center, and as it swayed, all remaining jellyfish followed in tandem.

As they ascended, their countless tentacles began to reach out towards Wang Xian and gang.

Besides these twenty-over Aurora Jellyfishes, another jellyfish with a tentacle of over ten meters slowly emerged from the back of other seamounts.

Within a radius of tens of kilometers, all the jellyfish began to ascend and fill the sea like a star-studded sky.

However, while the jellyfish had come in astonishing numbers, their fighting abilities were relatively weak.

Their movements were slow, especially the smaller jellyfish, and did not pose the slightest threat to Wang Xian and gang.

Howl, howl!

Together with the rest, Wang Xian, Prime Minister Turtle, Roving Heavens made low growls before they gradually approached.

Zoom, zoom, zoom!

When the gang was about a thousand meters away from the swarm of jellyfish, 23 of them shot their tentacles out. From which, countless Aqua-needles darted towards the gang.

Each jellyfish had more than a hundred thousand tentacles to say the least. With twenty three of such terrifying creatures, there were more than a million Aqua-needles shooting past the waters and coming for the gang at once.

Howl, howl!

Behind the gang, the Yaksha clan from the Dragon Guard Division hollered in unison. As they raised their weapon-like arms, all the Yakshas filed out in a single line and charged ahead towards the opponents.

Waters began to tumble, as they crashed towards the flood of Aqua-needles.

Howl!

Prime Minister Turtle glided gracefully to the seabed, before pieces of the seabed floor were uprooted and thrust in the direction of the Aqua-needles.

“Dragon Journeys the Four Seas!” Wang Xian shouted as he swished his tail. To which, the surrounding waters began to tumble violently.

Boom, boom, boom!

The sea waters began to surge and crash at each other. The battle could break out at any moment.

“Kill!” Wang Xian commanded with no hesitation. With quick shifts, he charged forth at the largest and centermost jellyfish.

The rest of the Dragon Palace members swooped over towards the remaining giant jellyfish.

When they saw Wang Xian and gang coming at them after intercepting their Aqua-needles, the swarm of jellyfish began to wiggle their tentacles.

They stormed up front to meet Wang Xian and gang face-to-face.

[Aurora Jellyfish: Level 12]

[Extractable Dragon Energy: 1,322,321]

Wang Xian took in the information as he narrowed his eyes. They were Level 12 Jellyfish, just as he had expected.

Shoo, shoo, shoo!

The tentacles lashed at Wang Xian like Aqua-whips.

Grr!

Wang Xian let out a dragon’s roar, which opened up a vacuum area of around a hundred meters ahead, where the surrounding seawater had repelled beyond.

Wang Xian stared at the tens of thousands of tentacles coming at him, before widening his mouth.

Boom!

A streak of flames appeared within the ocean.

The flames scorched furiously as they lit the underwater into a sea of red.

Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk!

Tentacles by the tens of thousands sizzled in torching flames.

Zing!

Just then, blue light flickered atop the heads of the Aurora Jellyfishes, which was then dispersed into the tentacles.

Shoo, shoo, shoo!

Sounds of the tentacles sizzling in flames disappeared in a flash, as they began to glow in blue before lashing out at Wang Xian once more.

Pat, pat, pat!

Wang Xian’s face cringed when he heard the sound. It resembled droplets dripping onto a stone, eventually hollowing it.

It was petrifying to think that these tentacles, thin as needle thread, could actually cause lacerations on Wang Xian’s body.

“No doubt a Level 12 creature,” Wang Xian commented. With quick reflexes, he raised his Dragon Claws and tore at the tentacles.

The Dragon Claws flashed with a metallic shine, as they emitted the Energy of the Gold Summit which cut straight ahead, slaying the tentacles along their path.

Tsk, tsk, tsk!

Sounds of sizzling could be heard once again, as the blue light in the tentacles disappeared in the blink of an eye.

Wang Xian soon discovered that the tentacles of these Aurora Jellyfishes were highly resilient, and could not be sliced off easily. Once the blue lights were gone, the tentacles drifted motionlessly as though all energy had been depleted from them.

However, the thousands of tentacles were literally just a drop in the ocean to the mammoth jellyfish, completely negligible; given its physical size, which was comparable to a mountain.

“Be gone, die!” Wang Xian hollered as he looked at the giant Aurora Jellyfish with icy stares, while his own body began to change.

“Roar!” Wang Xian growled. As he swayed to and fro, his body began to emit greyish bouts of the Earth Dragon Energy.

In the Five Elements, Earth repels Water!

As a Dragon of the Earth Element, he was able to repel all creatures of the Water Element.

As he swung his Dragon Claws, greyish bouts of Earth Dragon Energy transformed into smaller, individual Earth Dragons.

Zing, zing, zing!

Within the waters, splashes of mud attached themselves onto the small dragons before wrapping them up. This eventually transformed them into physical Earth Dragons, each measuring up to two meters.

With mouths gaping open, the dragons lunged at the Aurora Jellyfishes, ready to attack. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Shoo, shoo, shoo!

Countless tentacles of the Aurora Jellyfishes shot back at the greyish Earth Dragons in retaliation.

“Dragon’s Crunch!” Wang Xian ordered as his eyes looked on in slits. In response, the transmogrified Earth Dragons opened their mouths wide and sank their teeth into the tentacles.

The tentacles withered away, as though devoid of life.

In an instant, several hundred transmogrified Earth Dragons had drained all vigor from the tens of thousands of tentacles.

Zing, zing, zing!

From its gigantic head, the jellyfish let out a soft spurt before shooting blue rays in Wang Xian’s direction.

Shoo, shoo, shoo!

“That’s ... the Sapphire Aurora Jet!” Wang Xian gasped at the sight of the blue rays cutting straight at him. As he flinched his face, Wang Xian bared his teeth.

Boom!

A bout of energy the color of custard surged forth, thrusting and coagulating to form a gigantic shield. Measuring ten meters in length, the shield looked substantial and heavy.

Shoo!

A streak of the Sapphire Aurora Jet pierced through the shield, and took Wang Xian by surprise.

“Roar!” Wang Xian growled, this time emitting yet another bout of the Earth Dragon Energy which landed right in front of the shield. In an instant, the shield thickened to tens of meters.

The most formidable defense by an Earth Dragon!
