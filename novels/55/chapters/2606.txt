2607 2607. In just one day, the entire southern star was shaken

Not only the Sky Mountain Sword sect, but the planet of the ninth-grade heaven sect was also reduced to ruins!

All the ninth-grade heaven sect disciples on the planet were killed!

In the sky above the ninth-grade heaven sect, a group of experts from the Dragon Palace floated above and looked at the planet below without any emotion!

The location of the ninth-grade Heaven Sect’s commercial planet was completely destroyed. Similarly, all the ninth-grade heaven sect disciples here were destroyed!

The headquarters of the Jianhua Group and the Black Forest Group were also directly destroyed!

The Flames of war spread across half of the southern star system. The Dragon Palace’s swift and decisive attack this time also caught everyone from the six major forces by surprise!

From the start of the battle to the end, less than half an hour had passed!

“Dragon King, all six major forces have been dealt with. The Immortal King and level five and level six immortal king powerhouses have been wiped out. Not a single one is left alive!”

In the Dragon Palace, Wang Xian received the report from Prime Minister Gui very quickly!

Seeing this result, he was not surprised at all!

The Dragon Palace had sent out a total of 30 level seven immortal king level experts this time. It was too easy to kill nine level seven immortal king level experts!

“The six major forces have disappeared from this starry sky. Hehe, this is the consequence of provoking the Dragon Palace!”

Wang Xian mumbled as a cold expression appeared in his eyes!

“Immediately order all the disciples of the Dragon Palace to occupy all the planets belonging to the six major forces!”

He stood up slowly and gave an order to Prime Minister Gui!

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Prime Minister GUI nodded immediately!

Soon, the powerhouses of the Dragon Palace led the disciples of the Dragon Palace and flew out!

When the disciples of the Dragon Palace arrived at a nearby planet, the powerhouses of the entire planet were stunned, shocked, and fearful!

“The Dragon Palace is invading the commercial planets of the ninth-grade Sky sect and the Sky Mountain Sword sect. What’s going on?”

“I don’t know. The result should be out soon!”

Seeing the disciples of the Dragon Palace leave, all the people on the planet asked in shock!

“Look at the information on the artificial intelligence. Hiss, Look!”

At this moment, a scream came from the side, full of shock!

“Eh? How is this possible!”

“This is impossible. The Dragon Palace destroyed the commercial planet of Tianshan, all the experts of the ninth-grade celestial sect’s commercial planet. Hiss, this...”

“This... This is simply unbelievable. The Dragon Palace killed all the experts of the ninth-grade celestial sect’s Tianshan Sword Sect!”

“Someone on the AI said that the Dragon Palace destroyed the planets of the Tianshan Sword sect and the ninth-grade celestial sect. My God, this is too unbelievable!”

The shocked voice sounded, and everyone looked at the information on the brain in disbelief!

A month ago, the Dragon Palace was besieged by the six forces, but now they said that they destroyed the Sky Mountain Sword sect and the ninth-grade sky sect. Who could believe it?

If they really had the strength, would the six forces dare to offend the Dragon Palace?

They couldn’t believe the information on the brain, but the clear images on the brain shocked their souls again!

“Hiss, look at the Dragon Palace’s announcement, look quickly!”

At this time, another unbelievable roar sounded!

“The Dragon Palace really destroyed the 6 powers, and almost all 3,000 undyings from the 6 powers were killed!” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“The 9 undying level 7 warriors from the 2 powers were all killed, not even the 5 or 6 emperors were able to escape, this... who would believe that this was something the Dragon Palace could do?”

“Just how much power does the dragon palace have now, from the Tian Shan business planet incident to now, it’s only been 2 hours? And now there’s news of the 6 powers being destroyed?”

Everyone was shocked, the Dragon Palace immediately announced on the Ai, the Tian Shan Sword sect, level 9 Sky sect, three seas sect, Jian hua group, Black Forest Group, Demon Slayer sect, the 6 powers wanted to destroy the Dragon Palace, now, the Dragon Palace had killed all the experts of the six forces and was taking over all the planets of the six forces!

From the siege on the dragon planet a month ago to the sneak attack on the Sky Mountain Business Planet two hours ago, and now, the Dragon Palace had announced the destruction of the six forces!

The news shocked them!

This change was too fast, so fast that they couldn’t accept it!

Some of the powerful forces in the southern star system were shocked when they heard the news!

“Immediately go to the commercial planet of Tianshan, the planet where the Tianshan Sword sect is located, the commercial planet of the ninth-grade sky sect, and the planet where the ninth-grade sky sect is located!”

The forces immediately gave the order!

If the six forces were really destroyed, it would be a huge matter!

It would mean that the dragon palace had the power to sweep across the entire southern star system!

It meant that no force in the southern star system could compete with the Dragon Palace!

If that was the case, they would immediately go to the Dragon Palace with their specialties and treasures to congratulate the Dragon Palace for wiping out the six forces!

Just as everyone on the AI was in shock!

“Congratulations to the Dragon Palace on destroying the six powers, the six powers have committed grave sins, congratulations to the Dragon Palace, Congratulations to the Dragon King, the star South Galaxy will have the Dragon Palace as their king in the future!”

“Congratulations to the Dragon Palace on destroying the Sky Mountain Sword Sect’s grade 9 Sky sect and the other six powers, our North Gate Immortal dynasty will have the Dragon King as our king in the future!”

An hour later, the two messages on the AI caused everyone to be shocked!

The North Gate Immortal Dynasty and Sky Eagle Cloud Group were one of the top four forces in the entire star South Galaxy!

...

Their strength was no weaker than the Sky Mountain Sword sect and the ninth grade sky sect!

When the information came from the AI, the Warriors from the two forces went to the Sky Mountain Sword sect and the ninth grade sky sect to investigate!

With their abilities, the speed of investigation was much faster!

Within an hour, they received a few pieces of news!

On the Sky Mountain Business Planet, the Dragon Palace sent six undying godly king level 7 warriors to kill two Sky Mountain Sword sect patriarchs!

On the ninth grade Sky sect business planet, the Dragon Palace sent three Undying Godly Kings to kill a ninth grade sky sect patriarch!

These two pieces of news were very clear!

And there were two pieces of news, the Sky Mountain Sword Sect’s sect lands and the ninth grade sky sect’s planet were all covered by powerful arrays!

When the arrays disappeared, all their disciples on the planet were killed!

It was suspected that all the level 7 undying godly monarchs of the Sky Mountain Sword sect and the ninth grade sky sect had died!

When the Sky Eagle Cloud Group and the North Gate Undying Godly dynasty heard about these two pieces of news, their faces were filled with shock!

...

In at most an hour, the Dragon Palace had wiped out the Sky Mountain Sword sect and the ninth grade sky sect!

As for the other four powers, they had sent people to investigate and they had all been wiped out!

What kind of power was this?

Just two commercial planets, in order to kill three undying level 7 warriors, they had sent out nine undying level 7 warriors!

Then how many undying level 7 warriors did the entire Dragon Palace have?

They didn’t know this number, but they knew that this power could sweep through all the other powers in their star South Galaxy!

The Dragon Palace was already the strongest existence in this region!
