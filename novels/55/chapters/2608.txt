“This is the dragon star, its spiritual energy is higher than the other planets, there are so many people!”

“Those are the people from the Sky Eagle Cloud Group, hiss, the upper echelons of the Sky Eagle Cloud Group seem to be here!”

“Pay attention to your surroundings, undying god King warriors can be seen everywhere, there are at least a few hundred around!”

“Today, it can be said that all the big and small powers are here, I estimate that the undying god King warriors can reach 4 to 5,000!”

The next day, when the Dragon Star opened again, the disciples and fighters from the other planets all rushed over!

A huge battle that shocked everyone, a true king was born!

As the Dragon Star created by the Dragon Palace, the planet with the strongest defense in the entire star South Galaxy, it naturally attracted the attention of countless people!

Not to mention, the various powers of the star South Galaxy were here today to visit the Dragon Palace and the Dragon King!

Almost half of the godly king experts of the southern star system had come today!

“Behave yourselves here and don’t cause any trouble!”

The senior executives of the Sky Eagle Cloud group led themselves and the core disciples of the group to the Dragon Star through the teleportation array. An old man in front of them reminded them indifferently!

“It’s the general manager!”

The rest of the people nodded. They naturally didn’t dare to cause trouble here. Otherwise, the Sky Eagle Cloud Group wouldn’t be able to protect them!

This was also their first time on Dragon Star, they looked around curiously as they walked towards the place where the Dragon Palace received them!

At the teleportation formation, more and more powers were arriving, they walked in, God kings could be seen everywhere!

“Wow, this dragon star looks pretty good, it’s even better than our North Gate Commercial Planet!”

At the teleportation formation, a group of 500 to 600 people came out, the leader was the North Gate Undying Emperor, along with the rest of the emperor’s warriors!

Behind them were some of the most outstanding divine sons and Goddesses of the North Gate Undying Dynasty!

“Sister bei Shuang, do you think this planet is better than the one on Demon Island?”

At the back, a girl asked the short haired girl beside her, her eyes curiously looking around!

“It’s better than some of the planets on Demon Island!”

The short-haired woman, bei Shuang, looked around and said indifferently!

Compared to before, she was in a much better mood now. Although she had been sent here by the sect because she had used some abyssal seed crystals without permission, she was very excited after taking that step, this was also the reason why she was willing to come here with girls to relax!

“Is that so?”? This is a planet created by the dragon palace, sister bei Shuang, you don’t know, this Dragon Palace is simply too powerful, within a short period of time they rose up and destroyed two powers that were equivalent to our East Gate Undying Dynasty, this planet is also incredibly powerful, I heard that the Dragon Palace looks very young, it’s a beautiful man, Hehe!”

The girl said excitedly, “We should be able to meet the Dragon King in a while!”

Bei Shuang smiled at her words, she was close to 40,000 years old this year, she was already past the age of a flower addict!

“Follow behind!”

A warrior in front said, the group immediately followed, walking forward!

“North Gate Emperor!”

“Emperor!”

The group came to a palace, some of the Warriors within saw them enter and immediately shouted respectfully!

“HM!”

The north gate undying emperor nodded slightly!

“Director Tian, you guys are early!”

The North Gate Emperor looked ahead and said to the Warriors!

“Haha, we just arrived too!”

The Sky Eagle Cloud Group CEO laughed loudly!

The North Gate Undying Dynasty and the Sky Eagle Cloud Group were relatively familiar with each other. In truth, before this, the relationship between the four powers in the star South Galaxy was normal, they knew each other well too!

Both sides knew each other well, hence they were able to chat!

When the North Gate Undying Dynasty and the rest arrived, there were already 7 to 8 thousand people gathered in the palace!

They were all the warriors and core disciples of the various powers!

With a glance, there were 3 to 4 thousand undying emperors!

Before long, the Warriors from the tiger chaotic demon country also arrived!

Seeing the warriors from the tiger chaotic demon country, they immediately went over to chat!

Even the immortal dynasty of the north gate and Tian Yingyun went over to chat enthusiastically. This made the experts from the chaotic Tiger Demon Kingdom Blush with pride!

“Dragon King, it’s Time!”

At noon, Prime Minister Gui whispered to Wang Xian!

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded his head and gestured to the members of the Dragon Palace beside him. Then, he flew towards the palace that was welcoming the guests!

“The Dragon King Is Here!”

At this moment, the old national advisor of the Chaotic Tiger Demon Nation, who had sensed something, looked outside and said softly!

“HMM?”

The voice in the palace immediately quieted down as the experts looked outside one by one!

...

Looking over, a group of more than a dozen people walked into the palace!

The leader, Wang Xian, was dressed in a seven-colored dragon robe. He exuded a majestic aura as a faint dragon aura spread out in the surroundings. This caused all the experts present to be slightly shocked!

Behind him, Prime Minister Gui, Ao Jian, Ao Qitian and the rest followed behind. All of them were level seven immortal king experts. Their bodies contained a violent aura!

When everyone saw Wang Xian and the rest, their hearts trembled slightly!

“Greetings, Dragon King!”

The experts from the North Gate Immortal Dynasty and Sky Eagle Cloud Group immediately bowed and greeted him!

“Greetings, Dragon King!”

Everyone from the other factions quickly cupped their hands and greeted him!

However, in the north gate immortal dynasty, bei Shuang, who was at the back, trembled when she saw Wang Xian’s face. An excited expression appeared on her face!

She stared at Wang Xian while trembling slightly!

“Sister bei Shuang, this Dragon King is very handsome. However, you can’t keep staring at him. It’s impolite!”

...

When the girl saw bei Shuang’s expression, she immediately sent a voice transmission!

“Okay!”

“Everyone, you’re welcome!”

Wang Xian’s gaze swept across the crowd and suddenly noticed a gaze. He looked over and raised his eyebrows slightly!

“Congratulations, Dragon King, for eliminating the six major forces. Congratulations, Congratulations. If you have any orders from the Dragon King in the southern star system in the future, our Sky Eagle Cloud Group will definitely do our best!”

The President of the Sky Eagle Cloud Group looked at the group of experts behind Wang Xian and felt awe in his heart. He walked over and pledged his loyalty!

“Our immortal dynasty of the North Gate also regards the Dragon Palace as its king and the Dragon King as its leader. We hope that we can live in peace with the Dragon Palace!”

The Emperor of the north gate also walked over with a smile and spoke immediately!

“Hehe, our dragon palace has always adhered to the principle of not provoking others. If we can be friends, we will not be enemies!”

Wang Xian smiled and walked to a chair at the front and sat down!

“Everyone, please take a seat!”

He waved his hand at everyone!

“Alright, Alright!”

The group of forces heaved a sigh of relief when they heard Wang Xian’s words. They smiled and sat at the seats beside them!

“Sister bei Shuang, please take a seat!”

At the front seat, the girl saw bei Shuang staring blankly at the spot and pulled her arm! Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Bei Shuang bit her lip and walked forward under the girl’s shocked gaze, kneeling on the ground!

“Dragon King, Senior... i... I want to acknowledge you as my master!”
