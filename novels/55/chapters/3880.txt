Chapter 3881: 3880 and over 200 rank seven gods

Translator: 549690339

“Not good!”

“Damn it, we… We Aren’t their match. How could they suddenly be so terrifying? How could this happen?”

When over 200 rank seven gods were sent flying by the shockwave from Little Blue’s collision with the Starfield fragment.

In the next instant, they saw the ancient god kun-master attacking them again.

They knew about the ancient god kun-feeding Lord!

They knew about the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace!

They knew everything.

They even knew that the three kun-feeding lords of the ancient god kun -feeding Lord were extremely terrifying.

But this was only a space beast that was comparable to a level six ruler!

They could still fight and even kill it!

But Now? ? ?

Everything was out of their expectations!

The ancient god Feeding Kun master and a Kun suddenly broke through!

Was it that easy to break through?

If it was that easy, the level 6 ruler space beast they had tamed with the power of faith had also been nurtured into a level 7 ruler!

How could it be so easy to break through!

From the first level 6 ruler Kun being tamed by the palaces they believed in the universe, it wasn’t that these palaces didn’t want to make a breakthrough!

But it wasn’t that easy.

Especially since the cultivation systems of both sides were different.

Even if they had some energy that the space behemoths could absorb, it wasn’t as if they could break through just like that!

Until now, it would take at least a hundred million years for a sixth stage to break through to the seventh stage! Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Even the nine origin universe was the same.

In the records, there weren’t any experts that said that they used just a few tens of millions of years to break through from the sixth stage to the Seventh Stage!

However, the ancient god Feeding Kun master had broken through!

This was completely beyond their expectations.

Sensing the power of the peak of the Pantheon realm that was attacking them, the 200 rank seven pantheon gods revealed terrified expressions.

This move could instantly kill all of them!

The Gap was too big!

They were only at rank seven, and there was still a huge gap between them and the peak of the Pantheon realm.

Even those with precious treasures would not be able to withstand it.

Over 200 Type 7 gods came from the strength of 2 palaces.

Each palace had a strength that was comparable to a Type 9 god.

With 2 Type 9 gods added together, there was still a huge gap between them and the peak gods! “Save us!”

“Quick, save us! ”

The 200-over Type 7 gods roared out at the 8 Type 7 gods who were controlling the starfield fragments!

Star River Guardian! ”

When the 8 Type 7 gods saw this, their expressions turned ugly. They gritted their teeth and sent out another wave of energy.

A Star River appeared in the surroundings, sweeping towards them.

The galaxy covered over 200 tier 7 gods!

“Save us!”

“Quick, save us!”

The eight tier 7 gods followed up with a loud roar!

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

The 200-plus tier 7 gods immediately flew towards the eight tier 7 gods with bloodshot eyes.

However, Lan Qingyue’s attack landed on the Galaxy Guardian!

As an attack that was comparable to a peak pantheon, the entire galaxy guardian trembled violently.

The more than 200 level seven gods in the center could not help but spit out mouthfuls of blood!

“Hehe, none of you will be able to escape today! ”

Wang Xian sneered and looked at Lan Qingyue. “Qingyue, you and Xiao Lan suppress those eight guys. Leave the rest to me, Xiao Bai, and the rest! ”

“Alright! ”

Lan qingyue nodded. In the next second, she appeared directly on Xiao Lan’s body!

Little blue directly charged at the Starfield fragment!

That terrifying power was not afraid of the Starfield fragment at all!

The Starfield fragment was very powerful, but it was only controlled by a Tier 7 pantheon.

If it was a high-level pantheon, it would be able to erupt with even more power!

But they were still too weak!

Lan Qingyue stood on Little Blue’s body, and with a wave of her arm, the surroundings instantly turned into a gray ocean!

Little Blue was in the gray ocean, making its power even more terrifying and vast!

“Oh no, we’re no match for them when they join forces! ”

“With the help of the star field fragment, we can only fight one peak-tier space beast at most. They’re already equivalent to two! ”

“Damn it, how can this be? How can the Dragon Palace be so strong? !”

A terrified voice came from the eight level seven pantheon gods. When they saw Xiao Lan and Lan Qingyue, who carried an invincible aura, their hearts pounded violently!

However, at this moment, they could no longer dodge. Gritting their teeth, they started to defend with all their might!

At the back, Wang Xian waved his arm and the five elements Millstone attacked the more than two hundred level seven pantheon gods!

At the same time, the Taiji Dragon Disc transformed into a light and dark divine dragon and flew out from his surroundings to attack them! He stood on the soul warship and threw out the soul spear in his hand!

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

Two Soul Spears were thrown out one by one.

“woo! woo!”

“woo! woo!”

Xiao Zhai, Xiao Bai, and the rest let out a low growl and attacked the level-seven pantheon gods on the other side!

Back then, when Wang Xian and Lan Qingyue joined forces, they could deal with the army of ten palaces.

But now, they were only dealing with the strength of two palaces.

It was completely overwhelming!

They could even suppress them with just one of the five elements grinding.

Not to mention, they now had two to three times the strength of the Taiji Dragon Plate!

“The attack of the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace is Coming!”

“We can’t defend against it. The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace is not someone we can deal with! ”

“It’s over, it’s over, it’s all over. How did it turn out like this! ”

When the two level seven pantheon of the palace saw Wang Xian charging over, despair appeared on their faces.

They never expected this outcome!

They never expected their opponent to be so terrifying!

More than 200 level seven pantheons saw Wang Xian, Xiao Bai, and the rest and unleashed their strongest attack in unison to resist!

“Ahhhh!”

However, the moment the energy collided, it began to collapse!

Waves of terrifying five elements and yin-yang energy surged into their bodies, depleting their vitality!

Wang Xian stood on the soul warship and charged straight at the level seven pantheons!

The Soul Spears easily penetrated the bodies of the level seven pantheon.

One soul spear easily penetrated more than ten level seven pantheon and killed them instantly.

Two soul spears and nearly thirty level seven pantheon were killed instantly!

It was a complete instant kill!

Similarly, under the attack of the five elements grinding mill and the Tai Chi Dragon Disc, more than a hundred level seven pantheon died instantly.

Beside them, little white and little house also instantly killed dozens of rank seven pantheon gods.

In an instant, more than 200 rank seven pantheon gods knew that there were only 30 to 40 left!

The Gap, the huge gap!

This was a battle on a completely different level!
