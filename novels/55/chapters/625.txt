Chapter 626: Massacre Of The Underworld (2)

Only two Level 11 swordfish remained from the golden swordfish race.

As for dragonians, thirty-one survived.

Catastrophic losses. Out of two hundred members of the Dragon Sect, less than one-fifth remained.

Wang Xian took a deep breath, looked across everyone and said emotionlessly, “I’m back!”

I’m back!

The four cold words entered the ears of the five to six thousand people present.

“You are just in time to be buried with your Dragon Sect and the rest!”

Nie Wushuang stared harshly at Wang Xian upon hearing him.

The Dragon King had killed over ten Inborn experts from his Dong Hua Sacred Sect and overwhelmed the Dong Hua Sacred Sect with strength. He had long wanted to kill him!

“Haha! Dragon King! You are just in time! Today, my Crimson Bug can finally have its revenge!”

“Let me tell you this. After your death, I will ruthlessly torture your girls. I’ll let my bugs crawl into their bodies. I’ll let them experience something worse than death! Hahaha!”

The two leaders of Crimson Bug laughed hysterically and their eyes were beaming with bloodlust.

“Haha! Dragon King, you have killed the Attendants and Elders of my Dong Hua Sacred Sect. Today will be the day you die!”

Nie Wuya also stared at Wang Xian with ecstasy. His face was contorted as he laughed hysterically.

“Slay the dragon!”

“Slay the dragon!”

“So what if you are back? Haha! We are going to slay the dragon!”

At this moment, the surrounding crowd of martial artists faced Wang Xian without fear.

At this moment, they were completely fearless towards the Dragon King that had once instilled complete fear in them.

They were unusually excited about torturing and killing a supreme expert.

“All of you will die. All those families and forces that participated today will never have another day of peace!”

Wang Xian looked at the crowd before him. Gradually, the anger in his eyes dissipated and was replaced with apathy. Cold and nonchalant apathy.

“Haha! The Dragon King still isn’t aware of what the situation is!”

“He’s still not aware of what kinds of existences he is facing!”

“That’s right! If the Dragon King knew about the terrifying strength of the four old men, I wonder if he would dare to be so arrogant and brazen!”

“I would love to see how the Dragon King is crushed easily onto the ground!”

When the martial artists heard Wang Xian, their faces were filled with contempt.

“Brat, I really hate your arrogance!”

Among the four old men, the old man standing in the middle extended his arm.

“It’s going to start. That terrifying old man is going to strike!”

When the surrounding crowd saw the actions of the old man, they were instantly exhilarated.

“Fire Grip Strangulation!”

The old man lifted his arm and was wearing a fiery-red glove. The next instant, a palm that spanned a dozen-odd meters grabbed towards Wang Xian.

“You guys must be from Yong Chang Immortal Sect. If Shuqing is in any form of danger, I’ll send your entire Yong Chang Immortal Sect to hell to accompany her!”

Wang Xian stared at the four old men and commented plainly as though he was saying something ordinary.

Huh?

The four old men were astonished to hear what Wang Xian said. Their faces turned solemn instantly as they remarked, “Arrogant brat! This old man here will slaughter you!”

The old man lowered his arm and that huge ten-meter palm, that was seemingly made of lava, pressed towards Wang Xian!

“Haha! When I, the Dragon King, slaughtered a hundred men in Yong Chang Immortal Sect, your Hong Yan Excellency didn’t even dare to say a word. What are you guys?”

Bloodthirst gleamed in Wang Xian’s eyes as he lifted his arm slightly.

Boom!

That giant flaming palm that was pressing down towards Wang Xian collapsed instantly into streams of water.

“I have made up my mind to massacre this Underworld!”

Wang Xian lifted both of his arms.

“What?”

When the four old men saw the flaming palm collapsing, their expressions changed drastically. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Their hearts had already skipped a beat when they heard Wang Xian mentioning Hong Yan.

“How can this be possible? Brat, how dare you call our Sect Leader by his name and make such brazen claims...!”

An old man was infuriated and dense flames rose from his body.

At this moment, he was just like a terrifying volcano.

However, before he could finish his words, sounds of water flowing could be heard.

“What? Gosh! What is that?”

Suddenly, to the horror of the martial artists around, they noticed that the surrounding seawater was rising.

They were in the middle of the sea initially. At this moment, the surrounding seawater was raised.

It reached a height of over a thousand meters rapidly and surrounded everyone.

“From today onwards, my Dragon Sect will massacre the Underworld. Everyone and anyone who participated in this matter will never have another day of peace!”

Wang Xian looked plainly across the astonished five to six thousand people. Horrifying seawater swept towards them like a giant waterfall.

“What? No... No... How can this be possible...? This attack! How can this be possible!”

With Wang Xian at the center, the radius of several thousands of meters was surrounded by a wall of water that was several thousand meters tall. The terrifying scene was just like what an Immortal was capable of.

No... He’s even stronger than Immortals. Just a while ago, they thought that the might the four old men had displayed was sufficiently shocking.

At this moment, compared to the might the Dragon King displayed, it was like comparing a drizzle to a downpour.

The terrifying scene shrouded a radius of five to six kilometers.

What was the meaning of this?

“Shit. He... How could he have such terrifying destructive forces?”

The four old men were astonished and weren’t showing any traces of the composure they had previously. Feeling the terrifying water energy around them, their minds and hearts were shaken to the core!

“This can’t be real! What he said can’t be real. This is impossible! An Immortal-level attack! This definitely cannot be possible!”

The four old men roared. They flexed their bodies and terrifying flames shot through the clouds.

Boom!

However, a terrifying stream of water smashed onto them directly.

Everyone was staring at the four old men anxiously and watching them resisting the streams of water. Their foreheads were filled with perspiration and eyes were filled with fear.

Dang!

The water streams coalesced into water swords that were over a thousand meters in size before falling from the sky.

They clashed with the flames, making sizzling sounds. However, the water energy in the atmosphere was too overwhelming. The flames were rapidly extinguished!

Boom!

“NO! NO!”

The four old men were flabbergasted as they struggled to keep the flames around them to resist the water swords.

“I won’t let you guys die so easily!”

Wang Xian stared at them before looking across the crowd. His voice was that of a devil to the crowd.

When the surrounding martial artists saw the four old men incapable of withstanding a single strike from Wang Xian, the despair on their faces was magnified countless times.

The seemingly immortal-like four old men in their eyes couldn’t even withstand a strike from the Dragon King!

Not even a single strike!

How great were the differences in strength?

Boom!

At this moment, they felt like they were shrouded in seawater instantly. They didn’t even have the strength to put up any resistance.

The seawater had even shrouded Nie Wushuang and Emperor Qi.

Both of them widened their eyes which were filled with utter disbelief.

“Argh! The seawater is heating up! Argh! I can’t take this!”

Screams of horrors resounded as the gate to hell was opened!
