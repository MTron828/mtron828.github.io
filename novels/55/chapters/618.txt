Chapter 619: Return (2)

“Along with his Dragon Sect, he has struck fear into all the families and clans in the entire Underworld.”

“The entire alliance of the orthodox sects and Diabolism did not dare to offend him. He even went up against the strongest sect in the Underworld, Donghua Sacred Sect, and killed dozens of their experts.”

“According to what I know, his way of doing things is overbearing. He will not let anyone off for offending him. Moreover, his strength is powerful!”

“During the fighting between the orthodox sect and Diabolism, the Dragon King brought a troop that was almost on par with orthodox sects and Diabolism. He even fought with the supreme experts from the orthodox sects and Diabolism, and entered Yong Chang by chance!”

“The two middle-aged men that my father saved not long ago were the supreme experts from the orthodox sects and Diabolism!” said Xiaoxiao to the rest of Immortals. Recalling the Dragon King of Dragon Sect’s doings in the Underworld, she was very shocked.

Especially the Immortal-class strength that he had displayed just now struck horror into her.

His talent was really unparalleled.

“Twenty-one!” an Immortal cried out as he widened his eyes with disbelief.

Twenty-one-year-old Immortal? What concept is this?

Most of them had lived for centuries before they stumbled on opportunities to advance to the Immortal Realm. Yet, the Dragon King was only twenty-one years old!

Such talent was beyond description.

“Yes, twenty-one years old. No one in the real world dared to offend him. Both orthodox sects and Diabolism are wary and fearful of him!”

Xiaoxiao nodded her head with force.

“Greetings to Sect Leader and your Excellencies!”

At this time, the elders of three Immortal Sects flew over and bowed to him with respect.

“Sect Leader, that Dragon King was already promoted to blacksmith and alchemy Grand Master just a few days ago,” the Great Elder of Da Hong Immortal Sect said to one of the Immortals in astonishment.

“Blacksmith and alchemy Grand Master!”

That Immortal’s eyes gleamed and he exchanged a glance with an Immortal beside him with eyes filled with disbelief.

“I didn’t think that there would be such a wicked existence in the real world...the Dragon King of Dragon Sect!” said Hong Yan slowly.

“No matter how stunning he is, they only had two Immortals. Given the strength of Yong Chang, they would have surely perished here if they had not fled!” said Eclipse with a darkened expression, recalling the overbearing nature and arrogance of Wang Xian.

“Forget it. Having two people from the real world who could advance to the Immortal Realm was already terrifying enough. It looks like we have to be careful when we meet Dragon Sect!”

“After Yong Chang descends into the real world, let’s stay low profile. The moment all the Nine Cauldrons’ Worlds descend into the real world, there will be conflicts and combat is inevitable!”

“Let’s wait for Yong Chang to descend into the real world!”

The immortals remarked one by one as they looked down at the hundreds of thousands of disciples below. With a quick change of stance, they took turns and disappeared.

Upon hearing the conversations between the Immortals, the disciples of the three major Immortal Sects below were dumbfounded and horrified.

Twenty-one-year-old Immortal!

He set up a Sacred Sect in the real world to go up against the entire Underworld!

A Grand Master in blacksmith and alchemy!

On top of that, the terrifying Roving Sword was known as the rare swordsmanship genius in Immortal Slaying Sect for the last ten thousand years!

Everything added up to their disbelief.

Such a domineering figure actually existed in the Age of Dharma Decline, a world with trashy combat power.

For a moment, everyone darkened their expressions.

“It looks like even when Yong Chang descends to the real world, into the Age of Dharma Decline, we should not act overly brazen!”

Those disciples who were ready to enter the real world and make their names suddenly lost motivation.

The grand contest of three major Immortal Sects was still ongoing, but all the supreme talents were filled with bitterness.

“Cough, this injury will take at least a few days to recover!”

At this moment, Wang Xian could not help but spit out a mouthful of fresh blood. He wiped it off from his pale-looking face, tens of thousands of meters in the air.

Roving Sword, beside him, was also covered by injuries.

However, their injuries were not serious since they had prepared for it.

Upon tearing the array apart, Wang Xian turned into a Divine Dragon straightaway to block off the majority of the array damage.

“Finally, we’re out! It’s been almost two months!”

Sensing the sparse Spiritual Energy in the surroundings, Wang Xian felt a sense of belonging instead.

He looked down with a smile.

The concrete buildings in the city and the bustling roads.

Even though it was no different compared to Yong Chang world, it felt very familiar to him.

“I don’t know where we are now, but it must be a city below. Let’s go down, confirm our location, and get ready to go back!”

Wang Xian was beaming. With a quick movement, the two of them appeared on a road as if they had teleported.

The cars were passing by around them, and Wang Xian spotted a sign.

“Wen City is not that far from Donghua Sacred Sect. It’s about an eight-hour journey, and it would be faster if we fly over!”

Wang Xian looked at the time, and it was noon.

“I wonder if Shuqing, Qingyue, Xiao Yu, and Adjaya missed me. After all, they might have been worried about me while I wasn’t around!”

Wang Xian smiled.

Xiao Yu, Shuqing, and the rest might have been worried after he entered Yong Chang world, but they would not be too sad about it.

With the dragonians and Adjaya around, they would know that he was still alive. This could make them less worried.

“Let’s buy a phone and take a flight back!” Wang Xian told Roving Sword and walked into a shop that collected gold.

They sold some gold left in the space ring and bought a phone.

“Let’s give them a call!”

Wang Xian revealed a broad smile and dialed Xiao Yu on her phone.

“Hur? How come no one is answering?”

Wang Xian slightly frowned and called Guan Shuqing, then Lan Qingyue one after another. But no one was picking up their phones.

“What are they doing?”

Wang Xian was doubtful as he headed to a less populated street, ready to fly back to Rivertown.

“Haha, today, our Sect Leader and Emperor Qi of Diabolism will be leading the Sacred Sects to Rivertown. This time, Dragon Sect is going to be annihilated!”

“Yes, that’s great. Remember the time when the Dragon King and his gang were so arrogant a month ago. Now that Dragon King is dead, and the Sect Leader is back. He is going to work with Emperor Qi to annihilate the Dragon Sect!”

“I wanted to go over today. Unfortunately, my cultivation level is too low, and we can only read the news on the Underworld forum.” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“I heard that all the confidantes of the Dragon King are very beautiful. Tsk tsk. Diabolism has already said it. They want all the people who are related to the Dragon King to suffer big time. Haha, I guess the confidants of his will be tortured by the people of Diabolism!”

“Brother Liu, do you think they are more beautiful than me?”

“How can they be prettier than Nannan? Haha, don’t bother comparing yourself with those people who are ruined!”

Just as Wang Xian arrived on a remote street, several young guys and girls were sitting in a convertible car, laughing and exchanging conversations.

They were gloating at the misfortune of others!
