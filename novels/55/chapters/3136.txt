Chapter 3137: The two races lowered their heads

“Damn it, damn it!”

“Does the Dragon Palace really think that we are easy to bully?”

In the main hall of the nine swords race, the chief of the nine swords race looked at the information on the AI with an extremely angry expression.

In a short period of time, he first ordered them to release the ya long, and now he directly declared war on them.

Did he really think that the two races were easy to bully?

The nine sword clan leader’s expression changed, and his eyes revealed a cold expression.

But he slowly revealed a trace of helplessness.

Their nine sword clan had a deep foundation and countless disciples, and they didn’t even know how many disciples the Dragon Palace had.

If the Dragon Palace really killed their disciples, then the entire nine sword clan would be in a panic.

He opened the universe AI and chatted with the leader of the Dragon Race for a while.

“Announce on the AI that we will release all the Yalong.”

A few minutes later, the leader of the nine swords race announced.

The other experts of the nine swords race were silent for a moment and nodded.

With the current direction of the Universe AI, once the nine swords race announced this, they would obviously lower their heads and be afraid.

However, if they didn’t release the Dragons and the Dragon Palace killed their disciples, how could they defend?

They had so many disciples and planets, with their current strength, they couldn’t take care of them.

A Universe Knight from the Dragon Palace attacked and instantly destroyed a planet.

They couldn’t defend at all.

The warriors of the nine blade race looked at each other and immediately went to announce.

“The nine-sword race will immediately release all the sub-dragons, hoping to develop peacefully with the Dragon Palace.”

A message was released, confusing everyone.

What was going on?

“The dragon-descendant race will immediately release all the sub-dragons, hoping to develop peacefully with the Dragon Palace.”

However, soon, the dragon-descendant race also released a message, causing everyone to be completely excited.

Especially the ordinary disciples of the nine-sword race and the dragon-descendant race.

They had just mocked the news that the Dragon Palace was seeking death and was about to be exterminated, but now their race had released such a message.

Everyone was very clear about the message in the statement.

“What on Earth is going on? What on Earth happened?”

“My God, the dragon-descendant race and the nine-sword race have released such a message. Are they bowing to the Dragon Palace?”

“It’s obvious that they are bowing to the Dragon Palace by releasing this message. So the previous message, the Dragon Race and the nine swords race joined forces not to attack the Dragon Palace but to protect themselves?”

Everyone in the AI was discussing animatedly.

The change this time was too big.

It was so big that no one could react in time.

Then how powerful was the Dragon Palace? It could actually make the dragon descendants and nine swords bow their heads?

A fierce dragon crossing the river?

At the same time, in front of the Wangyin continent, dozens of sub-dragons were directly released by the experts of the nine swords race.

Dozens of sub-dragons looked at each other in surprise.

“What happened? The people of the nine swords race actually let us go. What… What Happened?”

A middle-aged man looked at the experts of the nine-sword race in disbelief and asked. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“No… I don’t know.”

A woman shook her head.

“Look, the nine-sword race really let all the inferior dragons go. Hiss, how much pressure did they bear? A statement from the Dragon Palace actually made them let the inferior dragons go.”

“The strength of the Dragon Palace is absolutely terrifying. Otherwise, with the strength of the dragon descendants and the nine-sword race, they wouldn’t be so afraid to join forces.”

At this moment, some discussions could be heard around them.

The inferior dragons widened their eyes when they heard the voices coming from nearby. They were shocked.

“The Dragon Palace is actually the Dragon Palace?”

They were extremely excited when they heard these discussions.

“Let’s… Let’s go to the Dragon Palace. Let’s go to the Dragon Palace.”

The Yalong’s eyes were filled with excitement.

They had been captured by nine swords and released by the Dragon Palace with just a word. One could imagine how powerful the Dragon Palace was.

With such a powerful dragon palace as their backer in the future, they would no longer have to be afraid.

The Yalong immediately flew towards the Dragon Palace.

This time, no one dared to stop them.

There were also a group of Asian Dragons flying towards the Dragon Palace with excited expressions.

“Dragon King, the two races have announced the release of all the Asian Dragons. They have surrendered.”

In the Dragon Palace, Prime Minister Gui came to the Dragon King’s palace and reported to Wang Xian.

“Okay.”

Wang Xian nodded slightly. He squinted his eyes and asked, “When will ao he and the others be able to complete their breakthrough?”

“I contacted them a few days ago. According to ao crab’s guess, they will be able to complete their advancement in about a month.”

Prime Minister Gui replied.

Ao crab and the others were currently devouring the Crescent Moon Venerable’s divine kingdom. A third-level divine kingdom in the universe could allow ao crab and the other three devouring dragons to advance to the second-level universe venerable realm.

After ao crab and the others advanced, there would be six second-level existences of the Dragon Palace Venerable realm.

“One month. Perfect. This time, they have obtained a large number of corpses from the sky array. This will allow our members of the Dragon Palace to receive a huge upgrade.”

“After one month, after ao crab and the others advance, we will attack nine swords and the dragon descendants directly!”

Wang Xian’s eyes revealed a cold expression.

According to the information left behind by the Crescent Moon Venerable, both the nine swords race and the dragon descendants had level two universe knights.

Furthermore, they had been established in the Milky Way for billions of years. There was definitely a strong defense in the headquarters.

With their current strength, it would be very difficult for them to attack the two races.

They could only wait for Ao crab and the others to break through.

And this time, they killed the core army of the nine swords and dragon descendants, killing hundreds of thousands of God emperor experts.

As the elites and core army of the two great races, none of them were weaker than a fourth rank void God Emperor.

These corpses could greatly increase the strength of the members of the Dragon Palace.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Prime Minister Gui nodded. His eyes flashed with a luster as he left.

This was the first battle for the Dragon Palace since they entered the Milky Way.

It was also the first battle for the Dragon Palace in the center of the Roaring Universe.

In the next few days, all the members of the Dragon Palace started to enter the dragon transformation pool to improve.

On the third day, one by one, the sub-dragons came to the front of the Dragon Palace, passed through the Dragon Gate and joined the Dragon Palace.

In the next few days, more and more sub-dragons went to the Dragon Palace.

The two races bowed their heads, making the Dragon Palace famous.

At this time, no one dared to offend the Dragon Palace.

Time passed day by day. Half a month later, the members of the Dragon Palace finished their promotion. The number of Dragon Palace Divine Emperor rank five and above members reached a terrifying 200,000.

The other members of the Dragon Palace had already broken through to the divine emperor realm.

One Million Dragon Palace Divine Emperors.
