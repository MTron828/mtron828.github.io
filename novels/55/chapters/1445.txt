Chapter 1446: 1446 Demon Beast Dynasty’s grand ceremony

A blood-red flag that was more than ten meters long was floating in the sky.

At the very front, the blood emperor and three emperors were riding on Dragon Horses, flying in this direction with a dignified look on their faces.

Behind them, there were six to seven hundred insightful void realm experts following them.

And behind these six to seven hundred insightful void realm experts, there were battle teams wearing different armors.

Uniform blood-red armor, uniform black armor.

Some rode on uniform fierce beasts, emitting a powerful murderous aura!

This was the blood flow empire’s famous battle division, and also the blood flow empire’s seven to eight thousand years of foundation.

Each battle division possessed terrifying strength. Under the leadership of an insightful void martial artist, they could easily break through one city after another.

“In terms of overall strength, the blood flow empire is still slightly stronger than the Flowing Emperor Alliance!”

“That’s only natural. After all, they are the overlords of the human race in the flowing sea region, the only emperor in the past!”

When some people saw the blood flow empire’s formation, their faces revealed expressions of astonishment.

“It’s the blood flow empire!”

The members of the Flowing Emperor Alliance also saw the blood flow empire on the right. Sect leader Ling slightly narrowed his eyes and swept his gaze over.

“A faction formed by a bunch of dead fish and rotten prawns will be destroyed soon. HMPH!”

The people from the flowing blood empire also saw Wang Xian, Feng Luan and the rest. An emperor’s eyes flashed with killing intent as he shouted coldly.

“However, all of you have to admit that we, as a faction, can fight against you. We will make it so that you won’t be able to sleep well!”

When chief Yi heard the words of the emperor, his face turned cold as he replied directly.

“Before long, I will kill all of you. I will make your alliance turn into a river of blood and a mountain of corpses!”

The Blood Emperor’s eyes were filled with a crazed killing intent. He stared at Wang Xian and spoke in a cold tone.

“You have a glib tongue. We shall see step by step!”

When Feng Luan heard that the blood emperor wanted to destroy their factions and all their citizens, her face turned cold as she spoke.

After she finished speaking, she did not pay any more attention and flew towards the island of the Light Dragon dynasty in the demi-human graveyard.

“This step will be very fast!”

The blood emperor smiled malevolently and flew towards the direction of the blood flow empire.

“Hiss, they are competing against each other. The two factions have already reached the point where they can not tolerate each other. One day, they will erupt!”

“A war is inevitable, but from what I see, it will take at least a few decades or even a few hundred years!”

“Do you think we should join one of the factions now? In the future, the flowing sea region will definitely be controlled by these two factions. The other factions will only be able to survive in the cracks!”

Some of the dynasty sects that had rushed over saw this scene and discussed in low voices.

Currently, the humans in the flowing sea region and nearly twenty dynasties and sects were neutral.

They didn’t join the Flowing Emperor Alliance, nor did they belong to the blood flow empire.

Some looked at the situation of the two factions, while others wanted to maintain the center and not participate in their battle.

Some were just waiting for the situation to change.

“After tomorrow, in the entire flowing sea region, the humans will only have the blood flow empire!”

When the blood emperor heard some discussions, he swept his gaze down and revealed a smile.

Perhaps this time, it wasn’t a bad thing for the blood flow empire.

“Your Majesty, at the Heaven’s pride stage in the demi-human graveyard, the monster race has already set up the venue. One afternoon, the Monster Race Empire will be established and the ceremony will be held!”

“At that time, the monster race will say that their king of the monster race will board the throne and become the first king of the monster race in the flowing sea region. At the same time, they will sign a peace treaty with the human race!”

“The demon beasts have found the world’s third trading company, the life and Death Pill Workshop, and the holy item forging workshop to testify!”

When Wang Xian, Feng Luan, and the rest arrived at the island of the Guanglong Empire, an elder walked over and reported the information here.

“Are all the factions in the Liuhai region here?”

The King of the Guanglong Empire asked.

“All of them are here. No faction will miss such a grand event!”

The old man reported.

“Yes!”

The king of the Kingdom of light dragon nodded. He looked at Wang Xian and the rest and said, “Let’s Rest for a day first. We will head over the day after Tomorrow!”

“Alright!”

Everyone nodded and settled down on the island of the Kingdom of Light Dragon.

As time passed, the human-demon graveyard became more and more lively.

In the past two days, the number of people in the human-demon graveyard had more than doubled.

With the establishment of the Demon Beast Empire and the gathering of all the factions, the originally bustling place became even more bustling.

In every restaurant and teahouse, there were discussions about the establishment of the Demon Beast Empire, the blood flow empire, and the Flowing Emperor Alliance.

This made many people certain that after this, the situation of the three factions could be completely formed.

Many people analyzed the strength of the three factions, their future possibilities, and so on.

“We, the Demon Beast Empire, have established and invited the human race to participate in the Grand Hall!”

“We, the Demon Beast Empire, have established and invited the human race to participate in the Grand Hall!”

A day later, when the sky lit up, voices suddenly resounded throughout the entire sky.

The voices were like thunder, deafening, and came from far, far away.

“Is it about to begin?”

“The Demon Beast Clan’s level 6 insightful void realm expert personally sent a voice invitation. Go, go, let’s hurry over!”

“This is a historic moment. The Demon Beasts established their dynasty and signed a peace treaty with the humans. Let’s hurry over!”

In the human-demon graveyard, the gazes of the humans turned towards the human-demon graveyard, and they immediately rushed over.

The mercenary groups, the forces of the dynasties and sects.

Boom

Not long after the sound ended, on the island of the bloodshed empire, a group of experts flew towards the Heaven’s pride stage with a terrifying aura.

“There are so many people!”

Everyone from the Liuhuang Alliance naturally rushed towards the Heaven’s pride stage.

Wang Xian looked around and realized that there were at least tens of millions of humans in the sky.

What kind of concept was this? All that could be seen at a glance were human heads. Those with poor eyesight could not see the end.

Each and every powerful force was exceptionally eye-catching in the crowd.

The Liuhuang Alliance flew forward quickly. Everyone in the surroundings hurriedly made way for them. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

When they arrived at the front of the Heaven’s pride stage, they saw a huge empty space beside the heaven’s pride stage. There was a strange arena placed there.

Hundreds of statues of demon beasts were standing in the center.

Each of the demon beast statues was 100 meters in size. They were lifelike.

The statues formed a circle. In the center of the statue, there was a huge high stage.

On the high stage, there was a dragon chair that was 10 meters in size!

The dragon chair looked extremely domineering.

A huge flag was placed next to the Dragon Chair. The blood-red demon beast flag was dozens of meters in size. It was floating in the air around 500 meters away!

The entire area was covered with blood-red plants.

On the right side, there were already hundreds of thousands of demon beasts and all kinds of demon beast races.

They sat on the stone chairs and there were more than a hundred demon beast races.

At the front was their king.

The founding ceremony of the Demon Beast Empire!

The day the emperor of Demon Beasts was established!
