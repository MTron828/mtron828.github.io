Chapter 53: We Fight (2)

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

“Lad, you’re quite arrogant. But I’m not sure if you’re fit to talk big.”

With a cigarette in his hand, a young man in the center was staring at Wang Xian impassively upon seeing Wang Xian’s attitude.

“A poor schoolboy is such an arrogance. What a courageous fool. Guan Shuqing, what a good boyfriend you’ve got.”

The young man beside Su Mei’er jeered as he looked at Guan Shuqing.

“Shuqing, is this your taste?” Wu Chen, who was sitting beside Guan Shuqing was staring coldly at Wang Xian with a ferocious look in his eyes.

“I...” Guan Shuqing was looking pale.

She thought it was only her and Wu Chen today, and she was not expecting him to call his friends. That ruined her plan completely.

In particular, those friends of Wu Chen were all from affluent families in the Rivertown. The young man sitting in the center, especially, had an even more daunting background and status.

Any one of them in the room was not someone Wang Xian could mess around with. Suddenly, she regretted. What if this bunch of people decided to hurt Wang Xian because of her...

Guan Shuqing stretched out her hand and tugged at Wang Xian’s arm.

Sensing the palm under the table, Wang Xian held her hand and gave her an assuring smile.

Guan Shuqing went stiff as she felt touched, and at the same time, worried too.

“She has great taste!” Wang Xian smiled and turned around to look at Wu Chen. He observed him from head to toe, “At least, I’m more handsome than you!”

“Hmph!”

On hearing his words, Wu Chen banged the table with his hand. He stared at Wang Xian. “Lad, I’m telling you to leave Shuqing now. Otherwise, there will be a corpse found in the Bohai Sea.”

“You’re in way over your head. You can’t even estimate your capability.” Su Mei’er jeered at Wang Xian on hearing what he said to Wu Chen.

“Haha, you guys are awesome since you’re asking for my life without any reason. What a great society. Since you’re a well-known figure in society, why don’t you introduce yourself.”

Wang Xian turned cold as he heard Wu Chen. Subsequently, he laughed.

“Remember, my name is Wu Chen, the heir to the Wu’s Group.” Wu Chen answered Wang Xian emotionlessly.

“Gong Family in Rivertown,” the young man next to Su Mei’er said with a smile.

“Song Family in Rivertown.” Another young man spoke smilingly.

The young man in the middle chuckled, “I’m Bi Xiuming, you can find out about me yourself.”

“Wu’s Group, Gong Family, Song Family, another one gave me a name to find out myself. You guys are awesome!”

Wang Xian placed his hand slowly on the table while staring at the four of them with a beaming face.

“Xiao Xian, don’t... don’t act recklessly!” Upon seeing Wang Xian’s action, Guan Shuqing hurriedly whispered in his ears.

She was afraid that Wang Xian would get into conflict with the rest of the people whom she treated with care even before her family went bankrupt.

“I told you to look for me when you have any difficulties. Don’t worry. I’ll be fine.” Wang Xian consoled her softly and looked at the rest.

“I don’t seem to have any conflicts with anyone of you, right? Oh, if there is, it would only be with you,” said Wang Xian, looking at Wu Chen.

“Are you having cold feet? We don’t need conflicts. We just hate you.”

Sitting in the middle of the room, Bi Xiuming looked at Wang Xian mockingly. “To be honest, thrashing people like you is not fun at all. But, you’re too arrogant. Here, drink these two bottles of liquor up and get lost!”

“Lad, get out of this city. If I see you again, you’ll bear the consequences,” said Wu Chen while glaring at Wang Xian. He then turned to Guan Shuqing. “Your father asked you to marry me, so don’t try to be funny with me. If I find out you have other boyfriends, your father will teach you a lesson. Hmph!”

“What a brag. Don’t you even look at yourself in the mirror?” said Su Mei’er disdainfully to Wang Xian. Her eyes were beaming with joy from the misfortunes of others.

“You guys can’t do this!” When Guan Shuqing looked at them, she was full of regret. If only she knew, she would not have asked Xiao Xian to come... It was all her fault.

“Guan Shuqing, if you want to find someone to annoy me, you should at least get someone capable of doing so.” Wu Chen looked at Guan Shuqing coldly.

“Hehe, you guys are indeed from the wealthy families. So stylish!”

Wang Xian looked at them and drew his lips slowly. This situation seemed to have happened before.

In particular, the two bottles of liquor in front of him.

Wang Xian took out his phone and stood up slowly as he was calling Xue Jing.

“Hey, Big Brother, what’s the matter?” At this moment, Xue Jing was in a kitchen not far away.

He was asking the chefs to whip up some signature dishes for Wang Xian.

“Someone asked me to find out about him. His name is Bi Xiuming,” Wang Xian asked with a smile.

“Bi Xiuming?” Xue Jing paused slightly, “He should be from the Bi Family, one of the Ancient Martial Artist Families in the Rivertown. According to the ranking, they should be in sixth place, slightly weaker than us, but not too bad.”

“Oh, got it. I may break a few things. You’ve got to come and settle it later.”

Wang Xian hung up the phone after he finished his words.

On the other side, Xue Jing froze before he screamed, “Gosh, Big brother is having a fight. Who the hell dares to provoke my Big Brother...”

“Haha, you’re not that stupid since you know how to find out about me from someone else.” Bi Xiuming was slightly taken aback when Wang Xian picked up his phone. When he overheard what he said, he chuckled.

“Okay, I got your information.” Wang Xian revealed a smile on his face as he reached for a bottle of liquor. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Well, so now you know who you’re messing with?” Wu Chen was showing a face full of sarcasm as Wang Xian picked up the bottle of liquor.

“Xiao Xian!” Guan Shuqing grabbed on Wang Xian’s arm hastily.

Wang Xian shook his head and said, “It’s all right. I haven’t experienced this for very long. Last time, it was for my sister.”

A smile surfaced on Wang Xian’s face. Two years ago, he was busy with his school work during the last year of high school. His younger sister was afraid that his studies might get affected, so she went to work in a pub to make some money.

When he found out that someone bullied his sister, he ran over.

The situation was similar to this. The other party wanted him to finish a box of wine before he could take his sister away. In the end...

He reached out his hand. In the past, it was for his sister. Today, it was for another girl.

In the past, he had nothing except his enthusiasm and boldness. Now...

Everyone watched in horror when Wang Xian grabbed the bottle of liquor and slammed hard on Bi Xiuming.

His strength was so mighty that no one could dodge the blow unless they were Level-seven Martial Artists.

Not to mention, it was a sudden attack.

Bi Xiuming, the young generation of Bi Family, was not any better than Xue Jing.

Bam!

Upon seeing the bottle coming at him, Bi Xiuming could only react out of his instinct by blocking it with his arm.

“Ah!” Bi Xiuming let out a devastating scream as his arm was shaking from the sharp pain.

“Wu Group, Gong Family, Song Family, Bi Xiuming? Speak no more and just fight the hell out!”

Wang Xian flipped the table with his hand and sent his kick towards Wu Chen.

If we can’t talk it out, we fight!
