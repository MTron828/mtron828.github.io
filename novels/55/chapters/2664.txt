“Howl Howl Howl Howl!”

In the depths of the abyss, trillions of Abyss species let out roars, their terrifying energy rushing towards the northern side.

“Howl Howl.”

In the northern side, all the abyss species that were fighting with the humans let out excited responses.

Each and every one of them became crazier and crazier.

“Howl Howl!”

In front of the inviting Moon Planet, the 4 undying level 9 abyss species showed excitement and craziness in their eyes as they charged forward.

“They’ve made their move, let’s kill them!”

Last month, when the leader and 4 others saw this scene, they let out a solemn howl and charged forward.

The battle had completely erupted.

“Sou Sou Sou!”

However at this time, in the center of the Abyss species, 4 extremely violent and powerful undying level 9 abyss species stared ahead.

Their gazes swept past the planets in the north, their eyes filled with excitement and greed.

Suddenly, a terrifying arrow with powerful energy shot towards the 4 undying level 9 abyss species.

“Ga Ga Ga!”

“Howl Howl Howl!”

One of them had a few thousand meter long bone wings and the other was like a dark snake, looking at the incoming arrow, rage appeared in its eyes.

Rumble

A terrifying energy landed on the arrow, destroying it.

Sou

However at this time, another arrow came.

“Ga Ga!”

Howl Howl

The bone wings and the dark snake were enraged, they roared at the other two and rushed towards the direction of the arrow.

“Roar!”

“Quack! Quack! Quack!”

Behind them were the two abyssal species. There were about 40 to 50 million abyssal species flying towards this direction.

“Dragon King, only two of them have been attracted.”

When Mou Zesen saw this scene, he immediately reported to Wang Xian.

“Two. That’s enough. Let’s finish off the abyssal species here first.”

Wang Xian swept his gaze over and revealed a faint smile on his face.

Two? That’s fine too!

“Kill! The powerhouses from the Dragon Palace are here to assist. There are abyssal seeds coming from the depths. Let’s kill all the abyssal seeds here first.”

At the front, a level 8 powerhouse from the Dragon Python group swept his gaze over and immediately commanded loudly.

“Hurry up and kill!”

“Kill!”

The disciples in this area immediately roared loudly.

“Sou Sou Sou!”

Before they could charge over, the arrows had already begun to harvest.

Many abyss species were swiftly killed.

Even two of the undying level 8 abyss species were targeted by over 100 arrows, instantly killing them.

“So Strong!”

“The Warriors the Dragon Palace sent this time are much stronger than before.”

The expert from the Dragon Python group was also excited when he saw this.

“The Dragon Palace is invincible!”

“The Dragon Palace is awesome!”

“Hahaha, with the Dragon King and the others here, we can kill these beasts.”

Some disciples from the Dragon Python Group, the Beichuan sect, and the ancient God dynasty were excited when they saw this.

They trusted the strength of the Dragon Palace very much.

“Roar!”

“Ga Ga Ga!”

At this moment, a terrifying roar was heard. The excited crowd was slightly startled.

“Not good, that group of powerful abyssal seeds is charging toward us.”

...

“Hiss, what a terrifying sound. What level are the two abyssal seeds at the front?”

“Oh no, what’s That?”

Hearing these two roars, everyone looked towards the depths of the abyss, they suddenly realized that there was a group of terrifying beings flying towards them.

Especially the two in front, they could feel a powerful aura from afar.

Everyone’s expression changed.

The Dragon Python group’s undying level 8 warrior’s pupils contracted!

“Requesting reinforcements, immediately get the sect leader Pinnacle Warrior from last month to come over. We have an undying level 9 abyss species here.”

He opened his eyes wide and roared at the back.

“What?”

The middle aged man who was connected was shocked when he heard the words of the Dragon Python group Warrior.

On the battlefield, the expressions of the disciples changed too.

...

“It can’t be... it can’t really be coming our way right?”

“This...”

In an instant, everyone’s forehead was covered in cold sweat as they stared ahead.

The tens of millions of abyss seeds led by the two undying level 9 abyss seeds rushed over undefeatable.

Feeling the power, they could already predict that they would become food for the abyss seeds.

“This... can the Dragon Palace defend against this group of Abyss Seeds?”

An eternal God Lord Disciple couldn’t help but ask.

The surroundings were quiet, their foreheads covered in cold sweat.

Could the Dragon Palace?

With the power the Dragon Palace displayed, they could fight against an undying level 8, but now there were two undying level 9 abyss seeds.

They could sense at least 15 or 16 level 8 abyss species.

How could they defend?

“Father, are we going to die?”

In the space of the Abyss, a youth looked at his father beside him, muttering.

Rumble

The middle aged man beside him gulped, his arm holding his weapon trembling.

He didn’t reply!

“Get Ready!”

“Rumble Rumble Rumble!”

The sky array saw tens of millions of abyss races rushing over, of which 15,000 were undying emperors. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

His eyes were filled with excitement.

Dragon Mountain let out a rumble and changed its direction, facing the group of Abyss seeds!

In front of the holes in Dragon Mountain, Ao Feng Huang, ao Xing Mu and Mu Ze Sen stood there, as for Ao Yao, he was already hidden in space.

Their gazes were fixed on the two undying god King Level 9 abyss species.

Weng

At the same time, the entire abyss species was slowly covered in thorns, the three thorn monsters slowly formed.

The huge Dragon Mountain faced the entire abyss species.

“Kill!”

When tens of millions of abyss species entered the attack range, an order sounded.

“Sou Sou Sou.”

Countless arrows instantly shot towards the densely packed abyss species.

“Howl Howl Howl!”

“Ga Ga Ga!”

In the next moment, the two undying level 9 abyss species in the lead let out a howl.

One flapped its huge bone wings, two bone spikes formed from darkness laws carrying terrifying power shot towards Dragon Mountain.

The other Abyss species was like an abyss snake, and it had a black horn on its head!

A black light surged out from the horn and charged towards Dragon Peak as well.

Behind them, the tens of millions of abyss species were also launching long-range attacks.

Vast amounts of energy charged towards the Dragon Palace.

“It’s quite strong!”

Wang Xian looked at the vast amount of energy in front of him and was slightly shocked.

Even two to three immortal king level 9 existences might not be able to block such an energy.

“This... this energy...”

Behind him, everyone’s faces turned pale!
