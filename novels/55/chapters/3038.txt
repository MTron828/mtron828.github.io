Chapter 3039: 3038 Asian Dragon

“People in front, please step aside. We, nine swords, are doing our job. It’s best that we don’t interfere!”

A cold voice was heard.

In the air, the group of people chasing after the Asian dragon saw Wang Xian’s figure. Their pupils contracted slightly and they immediately warned him loudly.

“Roar!”

“Save me!”

The Asian dragon with a head like a deer shouted at Wang Xian with a face full of fear.

The human in front of him was his last hope.

She wasn’t sure if he was a good person or a bad person.

Should she be captured as well.

“Nine swords?”

Wang Xian heard the cry from the other side and heard the pleading of the Asian Dragon. He frowned slightly.

“Come here!”

He waved his arm and a surge of energy pulled the Asian Dragon, causing it to speed up abruptly.

The Yalong who was pulled over was slightly shocked. He looked at Wang Xian timidly.

“You’re courting death. Hand over that Molong deer to us immediately. Otherwise, don’t blame us for being impolite.”

Upon seeing Wang Xian interfering, the expressions of the thirty over people from nine swords changed slightly. The old man in the lead shouted sternly.

“She belongs to me now.”

Wang Xian swept his gaze across the group and said faintly.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

When the group of 35 heard his words, their expressions changed slightly. They looked at each other and immediately surrounded Wang Xian.

“Brother, we are the disciples of the nine swords race of the Milky Way. We have been hunting this mollusk for a long time. If you interfere, you will be making an enemy out of the nine swords race of the Milky Way.”

“You have to consider it carefully. Is it worth it for a mollusk?”

The old man in the lead frowned and said to Wang Xian with a gloomy face.

“Save me. They want to capture me as a mount and war pet. Save Me.”

While the old man was speaking, the mollusc deer at the side pleaded.

“In the universe, demons are considered intelligent beings. She is not a desolate beast. It is not good for you to capture her directly!”

Wang Xian looked at the mollusk deer beside him and frowned as he spoke to the people from the nine swords race.

“In that case, are you going to be our enemy?”

Upon hearing Wang Xian’s words, the eyes of the thirty-five people from the nine swords race turned cold. They held the longswords in their hands tightly and were filled with awe.

“Is this the current situation with the Divine Dragon Bloodline?”

Wang Xian mumbled as his gaze swept across the thirty-odd people.

“Attack!”

At this moment, the 30-odd people on the opposite side did not hesitate. They moved and attacked Wang Xian directly.

Out of the 35 people, five of them were at the eighth level of the divine emperor.

“Die!”

“Dragon Eyes Lock All Corners!”

When Wang Xian saw them attacking, his eyes were filled with killing intent.

Hualala

Boom

Laws and supernatural powers were unleashed instantly. The entire world changed.

Dragon Shadows pulled on the chains and appeared around them instantly, sealing them off instantly.

“What!”

“Not good. He is very strong. We are not his match!”

“Run!”

The faces of the thirty-five people changed drastically when they sensed the terrifying strength that Wang Xian unleashed instantly.

They wanted to escape.

However, Wang Xian would not let them escape. Once they escaped, they might be in trouble.

“Die!”

“No, no, no!”

“Stop! If you kill us, we nine swords will not let you off!”

A terrified voice rang out. Wang Xian’s eyes did not have the slightest fluctuation.

Chains penetrated their bodies in an instant. Under his laws and Abhijna, the thirty-five people could not resist at all.

Even they were very strong.

“What is this?”

When the mollusk saw Wang Xian’s attack, he widened his eyes and revealed a hint of shock.

“Hualala!”

The dragon eye chains dragged over the corpses one by one. Wang Xian waved his arm and placed the corpses into the Dragon Palace of the Divine Kingdom.

These corpses could be turned into resources for the Dragon Palace.

“You… you have the bloodline of the Divine Dragon?”

At the side, the mollusk widened its eyes and stared at Wang Xian in disbelief. It asked in shock.

Boom

Wang Xian looked at her and his aura trembled slightly. A wave of dragon’s might enveloped her.

Bang

Sensing this wave of dragon’s might, the mollusk’s body trembled. It laid down in the air and trembled slightly.

However, her eyes were filled with excitement.

What a pure aura of the dragon. What a powerful aura of the Divine Dragon. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Are all the inferior dragons so miserable now?”

Wang Xian looked at the injuries on his body. With a wave of his arm, drops of life force liquid landed on her body.

The injuries on her body healed at a terrifying speed.

“Thank you, thank you, sir.”

The mollusk deer thanked Wang Xian with a face full of gratitude.

“Bang!”

Wang Xian waved his hand and crushed the confinement ring above her head. He sized her up and said, “The Divine Dragon bloodline in your body is very thin!”

“Sir, our mollusk deer clan doesn’t belong to the Divine Dragon Bloodline. Under normal circumstances, we aren’t even ranked as a sub-dragon. However… I accidentally regressed my bloodline and obtained a trace of the Divine Dragon Bloodline.”

“After my godly dragon bloodline was discovered, there were humans who immediately tried to capture me. They even killed my parents and the rest of the race.”

The mollusk’s eyes were filled with tears as he said sadly.

“My lord, I can sense the godly dragon bloodline from your body. You have to be careful too. They are very powerful!”

“The nine sword race that are chasing after them. They are a primary race in the universe and have a powerful existence with a universe knight.”

The mollusk continued to speak to him.

“HMM, if you don’t have any clansmen, follow me.”

Wang Xian said to her.

“Thank you, sir. Thank you, benefactor!”

The mollusk hesitated for a moment before replying immediately.

The next moment, her body moved slightly and transformed into a human form. There was a pair of antlers on her head.

She was about 1.6 meters tall and looked soft and weak. Her eyes were red.

“Don’t you know how to hide the power of your bloodline? That’s right. If you know how to hide, you won’t be hunted down.”

Wang Xian looked at her and asked with a smile on his face. Then, he shook his head and pointed with his finger. A Ray of light entered her mind.

“This is a method to hide your bloodline. Unless you fight in your original form, you won’t be able to sense your Yalong bloodline.”

Wang Xian said to her.

“Thank you, thank you, my Lord!”

Mo Long Lu lowered his head and thanked him again.

“Alright, no need to thank me. You have the Divine Dragon Bloodline. We can be considered a family. What’s Your Name?”

Wang Xian waved his hand at her. He flapped his incipient saint wings and a wave of energy enveloped her as she continued to fly forward.

“Benefactor, my name is Mo Xin Lu.”

Sensing the speed of her surroundings, Mi Xin Lu widened her eyes slightly and said hurriedly.

“Are there many Yalong in the Milky Way? Are they all in such a miserable state?”

Wang Xian continued to ask her.

He had just arrived at the Milky Way when he encountered a Yalong who was being hunted down. This caused Wang Xian to frown slightly.

Mi Xin Lu was already an intelligent creature in the universe. She was not a dire beast.

However, even so, she was still being pursued without restraint. The Asian Dragon, who had the bloodline of the Divine Dragon, seemed to be having a hard time.
