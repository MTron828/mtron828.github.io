Chapter 393: Cover-Shame

[Demise of the Sacred!]

When everyone saw the post uploaded by user All-Knowing, the entire Underworld was thrown into upheaval. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Demise of the Sacred, this was the Demise of the Sacred!

Seven Inborn experts along with twenty Half-Step Inborns.

These forces could easily have made up one-fifth to one-sixth of the entire Sacred Followers Guild, given such prowess.

Yet, they were also the same forces that had been completely wiped out.

[Without a doubt, they must have been killed by Miracle Doctor Wang of Rivertown. This is really unimaginable!]

[Just how powerful is this Miracle Doctor Wang of Rivertown? Those were experts from the mighty Sacred Followers Guild, seven of them to add to it!]

[First, he killed the Elder from the Sacred Followers Guild. Next, he slew seven Inborns from the same sect. He’s out to pit himself against the Sacred Sect!]

[How tough is this Miracle Doctor Wang of Rivertown? And how mighty are his forces?]

Within the Underworld, the Martial Artists had spiraled into a heated discussion. The news was simply too shocking for all of them.

Meanwhile, within the Palace of the Sacred Followers Guild, all the Elders sat in the Palace Hall with darkened expressions.

“Five Elders, two Sacred Enforcer Leaders, and twenty Half-step Inborns have been killed. This Miracle Doctor Wang of Rivertown, he’s bent on pitting himself against us Sacred Followers Guild!” an Elder chided with a looming look.

“We’ve lost seven Inborn experts in one shot, eight including Elder Feng. The Sacred Followers Guild’s incurred such major losses within a short few days. We have to seek revenge for this!”

“Right now, this concerns the pride of our Sacred Followers Guild, along with our foothold as to how we establish ourselves in the future. Hence, we have to wipe this humiliation clean!”

The Elders chimed in furiously.

This was a grave matter. It was no longer a matter of right or wrong, given the murder of seven Inborns and twenty other experts. As a Sacred Sect, they would have to get rid of the murderer by all means!

“We’ll have to kill Miracle Doctor Wang of Rivertown!”

“Yes, we’ll have to, otherwise our Sacred Followers Guild won’t ever have to think of gaining a foothold within the underworld from now on!”

All the elders snapped in aggression. Even Yan She, who had been sitting by the side, sighed as he knit his brows.

Seven Inborn experts had been slain. This was no longer a matter which could be forgiven out of kindness!

“Hmph, kill? Sending yourselves to your graves?”

At that moment, a holler could be heard across the entire Palace.

“Who’s that?”

Upon hearing those words, all senior management of the Sacred Followers Guild in the Palace Hall stood up with an ominous expression.

“Who’s that? Show yourself!”

“How dare you trespass into our Sacred Followers Guild, asking for doom!”

A frightening aura surged from the Sect’s senior management which stifled the surrounding air.

“Alright, why so snobbish?” a voice replied in annoyance. Thereafter an Elder soon appeared within the hall at lightning speed.

“Sui... Sui Huang!”

All the Elders of the Sacred Followers Guild gasped before they stepped up immediately and bowed.

“Sui Huang, what brings you here?” they greeted.

“Had I not arrived, the entire Sacred Followers Guild could have been wiped out by the time Old Huang gets back!” Sui Huang replied with displeasure as he glanced across the crowd of Elders.

“Sui Huang, you...,” the Elders began in bewilderment. Slightly irritated, they looked at him with frowns.

The Sui Huang in front of them had been a close friend of their Guild Leader. He was also the Laozu of a Sacred Clan, which made Sui Huang a legendary existence, one who they could not afford to disrespect.

“Just the few of you punks, and you want to go kill that behemoth of Rivertown? From what I see, I think it’s best that you guys just stay here and behave yourselves,” Sui Huang chided.

“Dammit, you guys are also asking for it. I just told that lad yesterday not to come and create trouble at the Sacred Followers Guild. In the end, you guys went over to seek death by harassing him!” Sui Huang reprimanded them with displeasure. As he spoke, he sat flopped onto a seat by the side and sipped some tea.

“What?” the crowd asked. They were puzzled and shocked by the comment.

“Regarding this matter, you guys should just stay out of it. Wait till I’ve contacted your guild leader and discussed this with him. To sum it up, just don’t go looking for trouble with that Little Demon of Rivertown. Just you guys alone would be sending yourselves to your graves should you go over!” Sui Huang warned the rest.

“Just stay here and behave yourselves. As for Old Huang, that old fogey... I couldn’t reach him. Yet he’s made me so worried!”

Pat!

As Sui Huang ranted incessantly, he flung his cup onto the table in a display of his discontent. With a change of stance, he vanished from the Palace Hall, leaving behind the crowd of Sacred Followers Guild Elders who looked on in surprise.

“What does Sui Huang mean?” one of the Elders asked in a lowered tone as his face contorted in bewilderment.

“Sui Huang has instructed that we leave that Little Demon alone. Seems like Sui Huang knows that Miracle Doctor Wang of Rivertown!”

“Furthermore, that Miracle Doctor Wang of Rivertown is no simpleton. Either he really possesses formidable powers, or he’s from a very prominent background; such that even Sui Huang senior has to treat him as someone with equal standing!”

“That young man. Don’t tell me he possesses the same prowess as Sui Huang. Otherwise... Otherwise, why is it that even Sui Huang would refer to him as Little Demon?”

Shock gradually revealed itself on the faces of the Sacred Followers Guild Elders. The message within Sui Huang’s statements earlier had brought more surprises than they could handle.

Especially these sentences in particular.

I just told that lad yesterday not to come and create trouble at the Sacred Followers Guild. In the end, you guys went over to seek death by harassing him!

Don’t go looking for trouble with that Little Demon of Rivertown. Just you guys alone would be sending yourselves to your graves should you go over!

The messages hidden within had astonished them.

“Should that young lad really possess the same prowess as Sui Huang or Guild Leader, or come from an equal force, then Elder Feng really had it coming for using poison to attack his little sister. If that’s the case, it’s because of Sui Huang’s intervention that the other party hasn’t made his way here. Otherwise, to think that we’d go seek revenge without even knowing the situation? Haha!” Yan She laughed at the irony of the matter.

Such was the pride of a powerful Ancestral Clan. Should others have killed one of theirs, a powerful Ancestral Clan would seek revenge with neither a care for the cause nor a concern about the consequences.

Yet, the Sacred Followers Guild had obviously compromised themselves by underestimating their opponent this time around!

“What do we do about the discussion that’s spreading within the underworld? Surely we can’t just sit back and do nothing?” an Elder asked with an awful look. After all, their reputation still mattered.

“Just come up with a random excuse, and we’ll discuss this again when Guild Leader is back!” another Elder replied with a darkened expression.

Silence filled the entire Palace Hall of the Sacred Followers Guild as the Elders pondered in a daze.

At night, the entire Underworld was still discussing the massacre of the Sacred Followers Guild experts and disciples of various clans who had tagged along to Rivertown.

Suddenly, the Sacred Followers Guild made an announcement.

[A group of experts from the Sacred Followers Guild have been attacked by ferocious sea monsters. Of which, only three of them have survived. As for other matters, they will be dealt with upon the return of the Guild Leader!]

Everyone within the underworld was dumbfounded by the news.

What is the situation? The group of Elders and Sacred Enforcers of the Sacred Followers Guild had not been massacred by Miracle Doctor Wang of Rivertown, but instead had been marred to death by ferocious sea monsters?

While the news had been beyond everyone’s expectation, most chose to believe in it after a brief moment of bewilderment.

After all, this was an announcement made by a Sacred Sect, so they could not have made the story up in order to lie and conceal the truth.

But what they did not know was that this was the final cover-shame by the Sacred Sect!
