Chapter 1065: 1066 was impressed

Translator: 5496903

“How did so many people die? Where are the five mentors?”

Xia Hou Ming and the rest saw that so many students and the injuries on their bodies were gone. They walked over with a face full of astonishment.

“Mentors... The mentors are defending the back against the beasts that are at transcendent level seven or eight!”

A young man saw Wang Xian, Xia Hou Ming, and the rest walking over. He heaved a heavy sigh and looked at Wang Xian. He said respectfully, “Thank you, Captain Wang Xian, for saving us. Otherwise, we would be finished!”

“Thank you, Captain Wang Xian!”

“Thank you, Captain Wang Xian, for saving us!”

When the rest of the students saw Wang Xian, they quickly thanked him as well.

If it wasn’t for Wang Xian’s help this time, it would be considered pretty good if one-tenth of them could survive.

This reminded them of the beginning when Wang Xian was determined not to continue walking forward but to walk to the left.

Now, it seemed that he knew that there would be danger ahead.

However, they chose to follow their mentor instead.

Some of the students recalled how they mocked Wang Xian after they left with their mentor. Their faces turned red again!

“Don’t shed tears until you see the coffin. Those who are injured should rest for a while!”

Wang Xian didn’t show any expression towards their gratitude.

He even mocked them back then. Now, he knew how to express his gratitude.

“Wang... Wang Xian, the five mentors are fighting against the ferocious beasts at the back. Send someone to support them quickly. Otherwise, the mentors might be in danger!”

Qian Hu, who was at the side, looked at Wang Xian. His expression changed as he braced himself and walked over to him.

“The five mentors are helping us to fend off those powerful ferocious beasts. However, those ferocious beasts are too strong. The mentors might...”

“Hehe!”

Another young man hesitated for a moment. He looked at the eleven Golden Swordfish and said.

However, Wang Xian interrupted him with a sneer.

He swept his gaze across everyone and finally landed on Qian Hu. He said mockingly, “The path is their choice. They are the mentors. They are here to protect you. The mentors are very strong. Why do you need my help?”

“If you are worried about the safety of the teachers, you can go and save them!”

“You...”

Qian Hu’s face alternated between green and white as he stared at Wang Xian in embarrassment.

“You are courting death. Are you willing to let others do the same? Seventy to eighty students have died because of you. I wonder if the five teachers will be responsible for this!”

Wang Xian revealed a look of disdain. If it wasn’t for director Qian, how would the seventy to eighty students have died?

Wang Xian was extremely disdainful of such people. How was it possible for him to support them!

Wang Xian’s words made all the students fall silent.

Seventy to eighty of their comrades had died. If it weren’t for captain Wang Xian’s help, only a few of them would have survived.

And all of this was because of director Qian.

If they had followed captain Wang Xian, 70 to 80 of them would not have died.

“Captain Qian Hu ran pretty fast just now. Hehe!”

At this moment, Xia houming’s mocking voice rang out, causing everyone to be slightly stunned.

Following that, the way they looked at Qian Hu changed slightly.

Director Qian had asked Qian Hu to be their captain temporarily. In the end, he ran at the front when he encountered danger and did not bother about the others.

If not for the appearance of team leader Wang Xian, the consequences would be unimaginable.

Looking at Qian Hu and then at team leader Wang Xian, the difference was simply too great.

In fact, there was a huge gap between the five mentors and Wang Xian.

Qian Hu sensed the expressions of the people around him. His expression changed and he walked to the side with a solemn face. He didn’t say another word.

Everyone was resting here while Wang Xian stood by the side to guard.

“One is missing!”

After about ten minutes, Wang Xian saw a few pathetic figures flying over.

He looked over and shook his head slowly.

“The instructors are here!”

“It’s director Qian and the rest!”

Some students who were not injured shouted loudly when they saw the figures flying over.

Everyone looked over.

“Huh? Why are there only four instructors!” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

However, everyone’s expression changed very quickly. They were bewildered.

Qian Hu’s expression changed slightly as well. He quickly went up to welcome them. All the students also stood up and looked over.

Director Qian and the three instructors who flew over looked extremely embarrassed. They were more or less injured.

Their eyes swept across everyone present. They could sense that there were about seventy to eighty people missing. Their expressions became even more embarrassed.

“Is everyone alright?”

Director Qian asked with a gloomy face.

“74 students died under the attack of the crocodile king. It’s all thanks to Captain Wang Xian. If it wasn’t for captain Wang Xian saving us, I’m afraid...”

A student reported in a low voice.

Five instructors made a mistake and caused the deaths of more than 70 students. However, they couldn’t say anything.

After all, the instructors had protected them and one of them had died because of it.

However... sigh...

When the four instructors heard this, they looked extremely embarrassed. Three of them lowered their heads.

This time, it was indeed their problem.

“If you have rested well, let’s set off. We have already wasted a lot of time. How about it, director Qian? Without your order, they might not know where to go!”

At this moment, Wang Xian crossed his arms and glanced at them as he said indifferently.

Director Qian’s expression twisted for a moment. He took a deep breath and said, “Captain Wang Xian will lead the team next!”

“It’s alright. If you want to lead them, I have no objections. I have also done what the Academy asked me to do!”

Wang Xian spoke as though he was sprinkling salt on his wounds as he flew straight ahead.

Ao Jian and the rest immediately flew to his side. Xia houming and the rest followed him. The rest of the students also followed behind Wang Xian.

They continued flying to the left. There was a carrion crow in front of them. There were more than a thousand of them. However, all of them were at the third or fourth stage of the extraordinary realm. The strongest one was only at the fifth stage.

A few golden swordfish shot out two or three sword rays and split open a path.

Seeing this scene, the students looked a little dazed.

If they had passed through this place, they would have already passed through the Blackwater Swamp by now, right?

After passing through the Carrion crows, they sped up and drove out of the Blackwater swamp in less than half an hour.

There was basically no danger for the rest of the journey. With their speed, they would be able to reach holy sea town in more than two hours.

As time passed, they were getting closer and closer to holy sea town.

This made everyone heave a sigh of relief. At the same time, they looked at the youth at the front. This time, they had been completely conquered.

This new captain was even more reliable than their academy’s teacher.

“Next, I’d better listen to the Captain!”

The city walls of holy sea town had already appeared in their line of sight. Some of the students looked at each other and thought to themselves.

“Hey, why are the elites of our demon Hunter Academy only here now? We thought you guys were in some kind of danger!”

“Eh, look, they really seem to be in some kind of danger. There are only four out of five instructors, and there are seventy to eighty students missing!”

Just as they were approaching the holy sea town, two mocking voices were heard.
