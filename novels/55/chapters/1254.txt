Too Careless! Too Careless!

Ling Jian ‘ER and Ren Xingchen stood at the bottom of the sealing formation, their eyes filled with a solemn expression.

They were so close to the heaven’s pride stage, and if they encountered any danger, they could enter their respective Heaven’s pride stage.

As long as they entered, no one in the Liuhai region would be able to do anything to them.

However, they did not expect that the Hanhai dynasty would actually bring over the Hanhai dynasty’s national protection array in order to kill them.

This was a top-grade array that was at the fifth rank of the profound void tier, and even a fifth rank profound void tier expert would find it difficult to destroy it.

Everyone in the surroundings looked towards Ling Jian ‘er and Ren Xingchen. Some of the people who were closer hurriedly pulled away from them.

This caused Ling Jian ‘er and Ren Xingchen to be extremely eye-catching within the grand array.

“Demoness, you killed the Prince of My Hanhai dynasty. Today, no matter what your identity is, we will kill you. No one can stop us!”

“In addition, your accomplice, our Hanhai dynasty will also kill him. Anyone who dares to invade our Hanhai dynasty, no matter who he is, will have to pay a huge price!”

In the sky, at the center of the thirteen profound void spaces, an old man coldly stared at Ling Jian ‘Er and Ren Xingchen as he spoke in a deep voice.

“Hiss, looks like the Hanhai dynasty will definitely kill Ling Jian ‘er!”

“And that Ren Xingchen will also be unlucky. Now that Qian Ye is dead, they are the second and third ranked Heaven’s favorites!”

“Do you think they will also kill the Nameless Sword Demon?”

“The Nameless Sword Devil is in the Prodigy stage. Unless the Boundless Sea Empire has set up a formation here and is waiting for the nameless sword devil to come out, it is obvious that the boundless sea empire can not afford to waste time!”

Within the formation, everyone’s eyes flickered when they heard the voice of the boundless sea empire’s top experts.

The boundless sea empire’s revenge was within everyone’s expectations. However, they did not expect it to come so quickly and so fiercely!

Inside the formation, Ling Jian ‘Er and Ren Xingchen scanned their surroundings.

“Huh?”

“What’s going on?”

In the arena below, Wang Xian walked out of his room. His expression changed slightly as he sensed the fluctuations of the powerful formation outside.

When he saw the 13 insightful void stage powerhouses in the sky, his pupils constricted slightly.

“The Hanhai Empire, they are here to...”

Wang Xian’s eyes revealed a serious expression. However, he suddenly looked to the left and saw a group of 20 terrifying figures flying towards him.

“Whoever dares to hurt our young miss, Our Heavenly Sword sect will not rest until one of us dies!”

A furious roar swept across a radius of dozens of kilometers.

When they heard this voice, the hundreds of thousands of people around the heaven’s pride stage were shocked.

Even the thirteen insightful emptiness realm experts from the Hanhai Empire were moved.

“The experts from the heaven’s sword sect are here. The elder at the front is at level five of the insightful emptiness realm. It seems that Ling Jian ‘er and Ren Xingchen should be safe!”

Wang Xian looked over and heaved a sigh of relief.

If the heaven’s sword sect didn’t come, it would be a very troublesome matter for him.

At this moment, the array compass on his body vibrated. He looked at the message on it. It was from Long Xiaotian!

“Help me tame the ferocious beasts?”

Wang Xian looked at the message and flew out of the Heaven’s pride stage.

At this moment, everyone’s gaze was stunned by the experts from the Heavenly Sword sect who were flying over from the sky. They didn’t realize that Wang Xian had already left the heaven’s pride stage.

He didn’t stay here to watch the subsequent developments. However, since so many people from the Heavenly Sword sect had come to save Ling Jian ‘er, it was likely that Ling Jian ‘ER’s position in the Heavenly Sword sect was still very important.

It was possible that her father had gotten over it and wanted to bring her back.

He wasn’t too interested in such matters. He quickly flew towards the island of the Radiant Dragon Empire.

When Wang Xian arrived at the island, he saw Long Xiaotian leading more than 200 subordinates who were waiting at the front.

“Brother Wang Xian!”

Long Xiaotian was excited when he saw Wang Xian flying over. He quickly went up to him.

“Are we setting off now?”

Wang Xian nodded at him and asked directly.

“Why? If brother Wang Xian has something to do, I can wait a little longer!”

Long Xiaotian said with a smile.

“If there’s nothing else, we can set off anytime!”

Wang Xian shook his head and looked at the group of subordinates behind him. He realized that there were dozens more than the previous time.

“TSK TSK, there are more and more experts under you!”

He said with a smile.

“Haha, this is all thanks to brother Wang Xian. In that case, let’s set off now!”

Long Xiaotian patted Wang Xian’s shoulder and said in a familiar manner.

“Where are we going?”

Wang Xian asked directly.

“The training ground?”

Wang Xian was slightly stunned as the news about the training ground of the Blood Stream sect appeared in his mind.

The training ground of the blood stream sect was another well-preserved ancient ruins of the blood stream sect apart from the Heaven’s pride stage.

As the name implied, the training ground was the training ground for the blood stream sect’s disciples in the past.

Similar to the Heaven’s pride stage, as a training ground for disciples, it was bound to be a place with relatively weaker strength. The stipulated age was also below 50 years old.

It was said that in the original training ground of the blood stream sect, the strongest fierce beast was a half-step void interpretation realm. However, after thousands of years, no one had entered the training ground for a period of time.

This caused the fierce beasts to flood in. In fact, because of the crossbreeding between the fierce beasts, an even higher bloodline fierce beast was unexpectedly born.

Currently, in the training ground, there were all kinds of void interpretation level ferocious beasts.

Most importantly, there were demonic beasts there.

The training ground was not like The Prodigy stage, which was divided into two places, humans and demonic beasts. There was only one training ground.

Demonic Beasts were generally stronger than humans. If it was not for the fact that there were more humans, they would not be their match at all.

In addition, in the training ground, one could obtain spiritual liquid and blood essence.

In the training ground, there was a spirit storage pool and a blood refinement pool.

If one placed the spiritual herbs in the spirit storage pool, they would be able to condense spiritual liquid. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

If one placed the carcasses of the beasts in the blood refinement pool, they would be able to obtain blood essence.

“I have already sent people to find the target in the training ground. When the time comes, I will bring people to trap it. The matter of taming it will be up to brother Wang Xian!”

Long Xiaotian said to Wang Xian.

“It’s alright. Just leave it to me when the time comes!”

Wang Xian nodded his head faintly and patted his shoulder.

“Haha, good brother! Let’s Go!”

Long Xiaotian shouted loudly. A group of more than 200 people flew directly towards the center of the cemetery.

“Huh?”

However, after flying for a few thousand meters, long Xiaotian raised his eyebrows slightly and looked ahead.

Wang Xian looked over and realized that the person in front of him looked familiar.

“Second brother, where are you guys going?”

The four young men in front of him flew over. These four young men looked similar to Long Xiaotian.

Among them, there was the eighth prince who was killed by Wang Xian. The other one was a young man whom Wang Xian defeated on the Heaven’s pride stage yesterday.
