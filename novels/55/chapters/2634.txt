2635 2635 Dragon Palace Prestige

“Kill!”

A cold roar came out from Wang Xian’s mouth. The heavily injured immortal king level 8 abyssal seed was instantly struck by Wang Xian and the rest!

“Ao!”

A miserable and desperate cry came out from his mouth. Ao Yao’s figure appeared behind him once again!

“Pu!”

Death’s scythe landed and instantly killed him!

“So powerful. The Dragon Palace actually managed to kill three level 8 undying godly monarch abyss seeds in such a short period of time!”

“This dragon palace is stronger than us!”

The Beichuan sect leader and the few patriarchs looked at each other. Their eyes were filled with shock!

Three Level 8 undying godly monarch abyss seeds were all killed within five minutes!

Their Beichuan sect could not do it with such strength!

“Leave these four level eight abyssal seeds behind as well!”

Wang Xian smiled when he saw the three abyssal seeds being killed. He looked at the four level eight abyssal seeds that were held back by bei Shuang and the rest in the sky and said in a deep voice!

“Alright, Dragon King!”

“Our bei Chuan sect will definitely not forget today’s kindness!”

The Eyes of the Bei Chuan sect leader and the rest sparkled as they immediately shouted!

“Surround them!”

A Beichuan sect leader shouted softly. The five of them immediately surrounded the four level eight abyssal seeds!

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

The four level eight abyssal seeds glanced at Wang Xian and revealed an anxious expression!

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

They pounced on an old man at the side in unison, trying to clear a path!

“Ice Wall!” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Bei Shuang waved his frost claws and pointed at the abyssal seeds!

Endless snow-white Frost immediately formed an incomparably huge ice wall!

The ice wall was incomparably thick, and only when the attacks of the four abyssal seeds landed on it did it collapse!

“Four beasts, don’t even think about escaping!”

Bei Chuan Clan Master roared angrily, and a long spear appeared in his hand, directly stabbing towards the abyssal seeds!

“Seal!”

At this moment, the sound of the Sky Formation on Dragon Peak rang out. The terrifying monsters formed by three thorns were divided into three corners. Numerous dense thorns formed a line of Defense!

“Kill!”

Wang Xian rushed over. Mu Zesen stood on the arrow platform and drew the bowstring fully. Arrows were shot towards the four level 8 immortal king level abyssal seeds!

The battle continued!

However, this time, bei Chuan sect and bei Shuang had a total of five level 8 immortal king powerhouses. Wang Xian, Mu Zesen, and Ao Yao Tian Array had four of them. However, their combat strength could not be counted as four. The powerful array formation was even more terrifying!

Facing the four level 8 immortal king abyss seeds, after trapping them, they were quickly killed one by one!

Every time ao Yao attacked, a level 8 abyss seed would either fall or be heavily injured!

The mysterious attacks, even Bei Chuan Leader and the others couldn’t sense ao Yao’s existence!

This made Bei Chuan leader and the others shocked and fearful!

Very quickly, level 8 abyss seeds were killed one after another!

“Hahaha!”

“Good, good, good!”

When the last level 8 abyss seed was killed by Ao Yao, Bei Chuan Leader and the others couldn’t help but laugh, their faces filled with excitement!

“Thank you, Dragon King. Thank you, Dragon Palace, for your help. Our Beichuan sect will definitely repay you for today’s kindness!”

The Beichuan sect master and the rest thanked Wang Xian and the rest once again!

“You don’t have to be so polite. We will take these abyssal seed crystals!”

Wang Xian smiled and said to the Beichuan sect master and the rest!

“Haha, of course, of course. These abyssal seed crystals will naturally belong to the Dragon Palace!”

Bei Chuan leader immediately nodded and said!

Wang Xian smiled and asked Mou Ze Sen and the rest to put away the corpses. He was excited too!

Eight Level 8 undying God level abyss seeds corpses were a huge resource to the entire Dragon Palace!

Furthermore, there were many other level abyss seeds corpses around!

“Our leader and the rest of the powerful warriors of the Dragon Palace actually managed to destroy those seven Level 8 undying God level abyss seeds. They are too powerful!”

“Hahaha, the warriors of the Dragon Palace are too powerful, they’re simply invincible!”

...

“Look at the Archers of the Dragon Mountain, these abyssal seeds were easily slaughtered!”

Behind them, the disciples of the Bei Chuan sect watched this scene excitedly!

With 7 level 8 abyssal seeds killed, their bei Chuan sect was no longer a threat!

With the help of the experts from the Dragon Palace, the Beichuan faction suffered the least loss in this war!

“The Dragon Python group can’t hold on much longer. Which faction’s friend has an expert? Please ask for Help!”

“The Dragon Python group is willing to give a certain amount of shares. If they come to help, they will be the benefactor of the Dragon Python Group!”

Just as the Beichuan sect was rejoicing and celebrating, and the Dragon Palace was crazily hunting and collecting the abyssal seed corpses, a voice suddenly came from the right!

“Eh? Something happened to the Dragon Python Group?”

The Beichuan sect master and the others were slightly shocked, and their faces were filled with a solemn expression!

The Dragon Python group had directly requested for support, and was even willing to pay such a price. It must have reached a very tragic state!

It must have reached a point where they could not resist. Otherwise, they would not have asked for help in such a manner!

...

“The Dragon Python group’s request for help?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows as his eyes sparkled!

“Sky Formation, can the formation detect the situation on the Dragon Python group’s side?”

He immediately asked the sky formation beside him!

“Yes, Dragon King. There are eight level eight immortal king abyssal seeds over there!”

Tian Cheng looked at the formation and nodded his head in reply!

“Eight? We can deal with them!”

Wang Xian squinted his eyes and nodded his head!

“Everyone from the Dragon Python Group, hang in there. We will come over immediately!”

He shouted softly and immediately came to the command post of Dragon Peak!

“Bei Shuang!”

Wang Xian looked at bei Shuang and shouted at her!

On the Dragon Palace’s side, they could kill five immortal king level eight abyss seeds. Five was the limit. There were eight of them over there. He had to bring bei Shuang along!

“Yes, Master!”

Bei Shuang nodded and immediately flew towards the Dragon Peak Command platform

“Leader Bei Chuan, you guys take care of this. We will go to the Dragon Python group to hunt the abyssal seed!”

Wang Xian said to leader Bei Chuan and the rest. The sky array controlled the Dragon Peak and flew towards the right at a terrifying speed!

“Alright!”

When leader Bei Chuan and the rest saw Wang Xian replying to the Dragon Python group, their eyes flashed and they nodded!

On their side, seven Level 8 immortal king level abyss seeds were killed, and most of the immortal king level abyss seeds were also killed!

There was no longer any danger on this side. As long as they made a few moves, they would be able to finish off the rest of the abyss seeds!

“With the strength of the Dragon Palace, we can obtain quite a number of abyss seeds crystals!”

An elder said as he looked at the leaving Dragon Mountain!

“The Dragon Palace deserves it. They are so powerful and dare to take risks. It’s only right for them to get some abyss seeds!”

Another forefather said calmly!

The abyss seeds were far less important than having the support of the Dragon Palace!

They were even willing to take out all the abyss seeds and ask the Dragon Palace for help!
