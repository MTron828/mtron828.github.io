Chapter 368: Levelling Up And Revival (2)

“Ahh... I’m finally feeling better after exhausting a million points of dragon energy!”

Wang Xian returned to his human form and stood up gradually on the seabed.

“Dragon King!”

The Nine Venomous Sea Snakes turned around and greeted him deferentially.

Hmm!

Wang Xian looked around him. When he realized only the Nine Venomous Sea Snakes were still alive, he couldn’t help but feel sorrow welling up inside him.

He looked further and was shocked to see the surrounding seawater to be in a beautiful shade of blue. There weren’t any corpses around or the scent of blood. It was as though the brutal battle previously had not happened at all. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Wang Xian’s eyebrows knitted together as he asked, “What happened? Where are Prime Minister Turtle, Roving Girl, Roving Lobster and the others?”

“Dragon King, they have all disappeared. All their corpses fused into the seabed and all the blood flowed in the direction of the Dragon Palace!” one of the Nine Venomous Sea Snakes answered.

“Huh? They disappeared? All the blood flowed towards the Dragon Palace?”

Wang Xian was puzzled and looked in the direction of the Dragon Palace.

“Let’s go back!”

Wang Xian headed in the direction of the Dragon Palace. His injuries made him feel extremely weak. Although his level had increased to Level 8, his strength level was similar to where he was before. In fact, he might just be a little weaker than before.

He would require a month of recuperation in order to slowly recover his strength.

“There are still other living creatures?”

When Wang Xian arrived at the Eastern Gate of the Dragon Palace, he was surprised to see two other races of creatures.

He squinted his eyes and a cold light flashed in his eyes.

“Huh? The swordfish race and the Anomalocaris race have entered the Dragon Palace?”

Wang Xian was surprised.

It wasn’t easy for a marine creature to leap through the dragon gate. Based on Wang Xian’s conjecture, those who could make it past the dragon gate would likely possess tremendous potential.

Divine dragons were creatures with the most elite tier of bloodlines. Their criteria for choosing the members of the Dragon Palace would be highly stringent. Talent, bloodline, intelligence and willpower. None of this could be missing.

Without exaggeration, those who could make it past the dragon gate would all have a high chance of becoming an existence that ranked among the most elite echelons of the universe.

It was beyond Wang Xian’s expectation that almost half of the Anomalocaris and Swordfish races had made it into the Dragon Palace.

Wang Xian’s eyes beamed. After entering the Dragon Palace and looking across the Anomalocaris and Swordfish race, he waved his arm. Dense streams of dragon energy entered the Nine Venomous Sea Snakes, completely healing their injuries.

“When all of them are in, control them!” Wang Xian ordered the Nine Venomous Sea Snakes. After which, he looked in the direction of the Dragon King Hall.

He moved and headed towards it at a speed half as fast as before.

When he arrived at the Dragon King Hall, he looked curiously at the Progenitor Tree behind the Dragon Throne.

At this point, the Soul Returning Branch on the Progenitor Tree was glowing in an eerie greyish light. On this branch, grey flowers had grown.

The grey flowers were extremely small and covered the entire branch.

Agitation welled up in Wang Xian. He immediately jumped onto the Dragon Throne and looked at the grey flowers in anticipation.

[Soul Returning Flower: Level 12

Each petal represents a soul. Reforge the body and one shall be revived! ]

A message surfaced in Wang Xian’s mind. Wang Xian was taken aback but soon got excited.

Reforge the body and one shall be revived... This... Prime Minister Turtle, Roving Girl, Roving Lobster and the others can still be revived!

Wang Xian was shivering in excitement.

“Soul Returning is indeed an insane ability! Who would have thought it could revive the dead?”

“I must definitely revive the Prime Minister Turtle, Roving Girl, Roving Lobster and the others as soon as possible!”

At the thought that Roving Girl, Roving Lobster and the others had died for him, Wang Xian became overwhelmed with guilt. They were his subordinates, his most loyal subordinates!

Whoosh!

At this instant, Wang Xian could vaguely hear the sounds of flowing water.

He looked across and realized that a small pool of dragon blood had filled the Dragon Transformation Pool.

The blood red dragon blood was giving off a faint aroma. Wang Xian jumped and arrived at the edge of the Dragon Transformation Pool.

“This is...?”

Wang Xian opened his eyes widely and stared at the Dragon Transformation Pool.

The Dragon Transformation Pool spanned twenty meters and reached a depth of thirty meters.

At this point, the Dragon Transformation Pool was approximately 5% full. Within this pool of dragon blood, there were drops of highly distinguishable golden blood.

These drops of golden blood were in the shape of a turtle, lobster, Devil Monkeys and others.

There were roughly seven hundred of these drops of golden blood. They were immersed in the blood pool and seemed to be in a state of suspension.

“This is the essence blood I injected into Prime Minister Turtle, Roving Girl, Roving Lobster and others. Now that they have been absorbed by the Dragon Transformation Pool, they were not dissolved. Instead, they are feeding off of the other dragon blood!”

Wang Xian’s eyes lit up and he was ecstatic. He went over to the Progenitor Tree and plucked out all the flowers on the Soul Returning Branch.

Based on the soul on the Soul Returning Flowers, he placed them onto the corresponding drop of golden blood.

Bzz bzz!

The dragon essence blood emitted light of all colors. From the essence blood of Prime Minister Turtle, it gave off a dullish yellow glow and an image of a turtle flashed past quickly.

From the essence blood of the clam girl, it gave off a blue light and, similarly, the image of a blue clam girl flashed across.

Roving Lobster’s essence blood...

[Would you like to grow and nurture the dragon species?]

At this moment, the voice of the system sounded.

“Grow and nurture!” Wang Xian agreed immediately.

[Growing and nurturing the dragon species would require twenty days!]

The voice of the system responded again. Wang Xian revealed a faint smile. After twenty days, Prime Minister Turtle and the rest would be revived!

Wang Xian looked at the Dragon Pool and the nine divine dragon statues around the pool.

Luckily, he’d gotten his hands on the Progenitor Tree and Soul Returning Branch previously. It was also luck that there was something like the Dragon Transformation Pool.

Otherwise, Prime Minister Turtle and the rest would have really died.

“Although it was a brutal battle, the outcome was still acceptable!”

Wang Xian heaved a sigh of relief.

He dragged his fatigued body towards the bedroom of the Dragon King. He was too tired and exhausted.

When he lay on the incomparably huge bed, Wang Xian instantly fell asleep.

At this very moment, he wasn’t aware how anxious Guan Shuqing, Lan Qingyue and Sun Lingxiu were above the sea surface. In fact, they were a little petrified as they stood on the deck of the yacht and looked into the sea.

There was a storm on the surface. As the raindrops fell onto the yacht, large sounds that resembled ripened nuts falling on a metal sheet resounded.

The three girls didn’t care about their safety as they attempted to stare into the depths of the sea.

“No. I want to take a look down there. I want to take a look down there!”

Guan Shuqing shook her head and spoke with a flustered expression. She wasn’t concerned about getting drenched by the rain. Her eyes were red but filled with resolve.

“Shuqing, I’ll go with you. Xiao Xian will be fine. He will definitely be fine!”

Lan Qingyue gritted her teeth and held tightly to the arm of Guan Shuqing.

“Young ladies, young master isn’t in any danger now. Please wait here!”

Behind them, Mo Qinglong, who was steering yacht, tried to dissuade them.
