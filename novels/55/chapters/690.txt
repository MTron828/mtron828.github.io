Translator: 549690339

“Dead puppet?”

Wang Xian looked at Ao Yao in astonishment and asked.

“Yes, Dragon King. They can control and refine corpses, making them their subordinates and weapons!”

Ao Yao replied.

“In that case, the two demonic middle-aged men are from the Jade Hand Immortal sect and Corpse Chief Dao!”

Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled as he asked.

“Yes, there are six immortals in this world. Each immortal sect has three!”

Ao Yao said solemnly.

“Six!”

A hint of solemnity flashed across Wang Xian’s eyes. If all six immortals were to attack, they would be able to kill them.

However, they were in the dark while the enemy was in the light.

“How many islands are there?”

Wang Xian looked into the distance and asked in a deep voice.

“There are a total of eight islands with humans living on them. The two largest islands in the middle are the ones inhabited by the Jade Hand Immortal sect and the immortal God Corpse Chief Dao!”

Ao Yao reported to Wang Xian.

“In that case, the rest of the people are living on the other six islands!”

The corner of Wang Xian’s mouth curled up slightly. “Let’s go and take a look!”

“Dragon King, these are the clothes of their world. Regardless of gender, they have protected themselves very well!”

Ao Yaoyao took out a few pieces of black and blood-red clothes. They were similar to the clothes of the devilish middle-aged man.

“The blood-red clothes represent the jade hand sect while the black clothes represent the corpse chief path!”

“Perfect!”

Wang Xian looked at the clothes and draped them over his body. Ao qitian also wrapped a piece of clothes around himself, revealing only two eyes.

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian moved his body and flew towards an island in front of him.

Ao Jian and AO qitian were on either side of him. As for the strange demons, they completely concealed themselves.

“It’s similar to the ancient times!”

Wang Xian and the rest came to the edge of an island and looked ahead. There were many ancient buildings.

The entire island was about 30 to 40 miles in circumference. In the middle was a street with shops around it.

There were not many people on the street. Most of them were wearing blood-red and black clothes. Only a few of them were wearing white clothes.

White meant that they had not joined the two immortal sects.

When he came to the street, he realized that it was very quiet inside. The people around him seldom spoke.

Stepping on the black bricks gave him an uncomfortable feeling.

Wang Xian looked at the shops around him and saw a weapons shop. He gestured to Ao Qitian and Ao Jian before walking inside.

As soon as he entered the shop, Wang Xian saw a woman dressed in revealing and cold clothes standing by the door.

The woman’s face was extremely pale and had a pretty face. However, Wang Xian could not sense any signs of life from her.

His expression changed slightly. This was a puppet, a dead person.

“Take a look at what you want!”

At this moment, a cold voice came from inside.

“Veteran, have you finished forging my spiritual weapon?”

At this moment, a haughty voice came from outside. A young man dressed in blood-red clothes walked in with his head slightly raised. Behind him were two middle-aged men who were exuding a strong murderous aura.

He was only dressed in a blood-red robe. His face was not concealed at all, revealing his uniqueness.

“Young Master Xue, the spiritual weapon has been forged for you!”

An old man stood up from inside. With a smile on his face, he took out an exquisite box and placed it on the table.

“HMM?”

Wang Xian looked at the box and narrowed his eyes slightly. A grade-12 material. It was actually a grade-12 material.

The young man walked over and opened the box. A black longsword was held in his hand.

“Not bad, not bad!”

The young man looked satisfied. “As expected of the hands of a grandmaster. Here, one hundred blood coagulation pills for the Dan Stage!”

A jade bottle was thrown over. The old man opened it and looked at it. He looked delighted. “Young Master Xue, after the last day of business, we won’t be doing it anymore!”

“Oh? Why Not? The cauldron of Yu is about to appear. High-quality weapons are in short supply!”

The young man looked at the old man curiously.

“Young Master Xue, after the cauldron of Yu appears, this blood coagulation pill won’t be worth much anymore. Moreover, the materials I have will be worth a lot!”

The old man said with a smile.

“That’s true!”

“When our nine cauldrons appear, it will be the time for us to wreak havoc in the world. Young Master mingxue, who was established by the immortal God, should have the strength to join us, right?”

“Of course. When the cauldron of Yu appears, Mingsha will shock the heavens. Keke, when the time comes, the heavens will allow us to fly freely!” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

The young man and the Old Man conversed without any scruples, especially the young man in blood-red clothes. His face was filled with arrogance.

When Wang Xian heard their conversation, the red and blue light in his eyes swept across the surroundings.

A trace of shock and killing intent flashed past.

The spiritual artifacts on the surrounding walls were all forged using crude methods.

A level-12 material to forge a level-11 weapon.

This was not a weapon forging technique, but a forging technique.

There were more than a dozen level-12 spiritual weapons in this weapon shop.

These were all level-13 materials. If one knew about formations, they could definitely forge immortal spiritual weapons.

What filled Wang Xian with killing intent was the blood clotting pill in the jade bottle.

The so-called blood clotting pill was not a medicinal pill.

Instead, it was a kind of medicinal pill that was formed by condensing the flesh and blood of living beings or even humans using a special method.

Consuming this blood clotting pill would naturally increase the energy.

“No wonder there aren’t any living beings in the ocean of the island. It turns out that all of them have been refined into blood clotting pills!”

“What a crazy world!”

Wang Xian’s eyes were cold. With a wave of his arm, the door of the shop was shut.

“Huh?”

The old man and the young man were stunned. They immediately looked at Wang Xian.

“Who told you to close the door!”

The young man shouted coldly and slowly pulled out his spiritual sword. “An ordinary disciple, whose subordinate!”

Wang Xian slowly took off his hat and waved his arm at the two middle-aged men behind the young man.

Boom

A flame landed on the two of them, rendering them silent.

When the young man and the old man saw Wang Xian’s attack, their expressions changed drastically. “Flame, fire attribute. Who Are You?”

“Ah!”

At this moment, the puppet lady who had been standing at the door suddenly pulled out a dagger and stabbed at them ferociously.

The puppet had an attack power at the Dan Stage. This puppet was an expert at the Dan stage.

Ao jian pointed with his finger and a metal longsword smashed her head into pieces.

“Metal attribute. You guys are not from our world!”

The old man was shocked when he saw Ao Jian’s attack.

In the world of the cauldron of Yu, there were no fire and metal attribute cultivators. There were only demon and water attributes!

“Do you guys know these two people?”

Wang Xian stared at them coldly. With a wave of his arm, the images of the two demonic middle-aged men appeared in the Void!

“This is!”

The two of them swept their gaze over and their faces turned gloomy immediately. They stared at them with flickering eyes.

“Who is this?”

Ao Qitian waved his arm and his hairy palm grabbed the necks of the young man and the old man as he asked in a stern tone.
