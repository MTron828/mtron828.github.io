“What should we do? What should we do?”

“The ferocious beasts have already arrived at the city gates. The kingdom has already given up on us. We are doomed. Our holy sea town is about to be invaded by the ferocious beasts!”

“Run, quickly run!”

For a moment, the people of Holy Sea Town at the east gate were in a mess. All the ordinary people who were waiting on the streets to defend the city heard this news and their faces turned pale. They even staggered.

“How could this be? How could this be? !”

“Mom, can we still survive?”

“I don’t want to die, but we can’t escape at all. We’re too weak!”

Everyone at the East Gate was in despair.

Some of the mercenary groups from East Sea city saw the ocean cultivator corps and the people from the three academies escape, and their faces changed dramatically. They hurriedly followed behind and fled toward East Sea city.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

At this moment, an excited roar sounded. The group of mercenaries who had just flown out of the city saw in horror that tens of thousands of wandering sea monsters were attacking them.

“These demonic beasts are going to kill us all!”

One of the mercenary group leaders had an extremely ugly expression on his face. He gritted his teeth and shouted, “Run! Run!”

“Run, run!”

Not only the mercenary group from East Sea City, but also some people from holy sea town wanted to run away. However, most of them went back to their families in despair.

“Son, wife, wife!”

“Father, come here. Father, let’s go. I’ll take you away!”

The entire east side of holy sea town was in chaos.

Some people could run away, but some people couldn’t because this was their home and their family.

If they ran away, what would happen to their family?

Moreover, even if they ran out of the city, would they be able to escape?

Where to?

If they ran to East Sea city, with their strength, they would definitely die on the road.

Everyone was in despair. Hundreds of thousands of people in the entire East region were screaming and screaming in fear.

The Cries of children, the sobs of women, and the helpless sighs of the old man seemed to indicate death!

Death was coming!

“Buzz Buzz!”

The trembling sound of the array formation was heard. According to the attack of the beasts below, the entire holy sea town would fall in less than ten minutes.

In fact, if the group of blood savage beasts were to attack, the protective formation of the entire Shenghai town might be broken in one to two minutes.

At that time, 1.7 to 800,000 people would be like lambs waiting to be slaughtered in front of this group of ferocious beasts.

...

...

“Huh?”

At this moment, Wang Xian, who was fighting against three extraordinary level nine blood savage beasts at the north gate, felt the vibration coming from Shenghai town. He was slightly stunned and a look of astonishment appeared on his face.

“This is bad. The Army of ocean cultivators and the people from the three major academies have abandoned the city and escaped. The East Gate has been lost and is about to be breached!”

At this moment, a terrified voice of a middle-aged man came from the position of the city wall.

Wang Xian’s pupils constricted slightly. The Army of ocean cultivators had actually abandoned the city and escaped?

Why didn’t the star-moon kingdom send any insightful emptiness realm experts over? Why did they abandon the holy sea town and 1.7 to 1.8 million people just like that!

This caused him to be astonished.

“Do it!”

With a wave of Wang Xian’s arm, the entire space turned into darkness!

“Ahhhh!”

The strange demon made its move. Three blood-red Savage Beasts’miserable cries could be heard.

Wang Xian moved his body and flew directly towards the city wall. When he passed by, he saw Ao Jian 11 and the rest were still fighting. He casually killed the Blood Shadow Walker who was at transcendent level 8. There were only about 10,000 savage beasts at the city gate, he immediately charged over!

“Commander Wang, this is bad. The kingdom has given up on the holy sea town. The holy sea town is finished!”

At this moment, Jin Qianyuan flew over. His eyes were slightly red as he growled at Wang Xian.

“Run. Commander Wang, you should run. The holy sea town can no longer be defended. At the East Gate, there are more than 30 blood savage beasts standing in the void like kings. Among them, there are five half-step void interpretation level existences!”

Jin Qianyuan continued with a face full of despair.

“What?”

Wang Xian’s expression changed slightly. A solemn expression appeared on his face. There were five half-step void interpretation level demonic beasts.

“Abandon the city and run? They have already left?”

Wang Xian frowned and asked.

“Yes, the east gate is no longer guarded. The formation can only hold for a few minutes. The holy sea can’t hold anymore!”

Jin Qianyuan heaved a heavy sigh. “Commander Wang, thank you so much. I want to...”

As he spoke, he shook his head and flew toward the city wall.

Wang Xian hesitated for a moment before flying toward the city wall.

“Mayor!”

“Mayor!”

When Wang Xian was standing on the city wall, he heard the voices of people shouting for Jin Qianyuan.

The hundreds of thousands of people on the city wall and in the vicinity had already received the news from the East Gate.

Compared to the chaos at the East Gate, there was no chaos because the place was already guarded.

However, everyone’s faces were extremely pale and their eyes were filled with despair.

One by one, the city guards of Shenghai town shouted for Jin Qianyuan. Below, everyone looked at the mayor. Some of them had already cried out in despair.

Jin Qianyuan stood on the city wall and looked at the hundreds of thousands of people below. When he saw their despair, his eyes turned slightly red.

“Mayor, can we defend our home?”

At this moment, a crisp voice came from below. A woman was holding a boy, and the Little Boy’s bright eyes were looking at him.

When the woman heard her child speak, she quickly covered his mouth.

“Father, if we leave... What will happen to them!” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Beside Jin Qianyuan, Jin Liuyan tugged at her father’s sleeve and looked down, tears could not help but flow down her face. “Mother was killed by a ferocious beast back then. It’s fine if we don’t leave. Maybe... maybe we can hold on!”

Jin Qianyuan’s body trembled slightly when he heard his daughter’s words. He raised his head, afraid that tears would flow down his face.

“Mayor, run as many people as you can. You are strong. Bring the young lady and run first. We Don’t blame you. We have no way of turning back this matter!”

An elder beside him sighed and looked down.

There were more than ten people there. They were all his family. With his transcendent rank 6 strength, he could run, but he couldn’t!

He flew over and hugged his grandson with a smile on his face.

“Hu!”

Jin Qianyuan took a deep breath, and a determined look slowly appeared on his face. He opened his mouth and roared loudly, “Fight!”

“Fight, the north gate has been guarded. Let’s go guard the east gate. As long as there is a glimmer of hope, I, Jin Qianyuan, will never give up!”

“Even if I die in the battle in the Holy Sea Town, I will not abandon the city... and run away!”

He roared with all his strength, “If someone wants to leave, I don’t blame you. If someone wants to fight, follow me to the East Gate and defend the city!”

With that, he flew directly to the east gate.

Looking at her father, Jin Liuyan smiled with tears in her eyes and followed behind him.

“Fight!”

“Kill! Even if we die, we have to kill a ferocious beast!”

“Follow the mayor and protect our home!”

After three seconds of silence, the north gate was suddenly in an uproar. One by one, the middle-aged youths with bloodshot eyes shouted loudly and immediately caught up with the mayor.

“Grandson, wait here for Grandpa. Grandpa will go and conquer a piece of Pure Land for You!”

The old man who flew down touched his grandson gently and flew over.

“There are no cowards in our holy sea town. Fight, even if it means death!”

“Our West arrival town has been defeated. Let’s end this once and for all!”

The people of Holy Sea town flew over one by one. Even those who were at the first level of transcendence followed behind.

Faced with a desperate situation, they chose to fight with their lives on the line, even if they already knew that death was right in front of them!

“Sigh!”

Wang Xian looked at Jin Qianyuan who had lost his wrist. He could have escaped, but he chose to fight instead.

Looking at the warriors of Shenghai Town who were fighting bloody battles for their families and children, Wang Xian was slightly touched.

“I originally wanted to leave after earning a wave of ferocious beast corpses. Now, it seems like I have to fight with them. I hope there are no void interpretation experts. Otherwise, I will die and have to go to the Dragon Palace to wait for My Resurrection!”

Wang Xian smiled and threw the storage spiritual bag to a golden swordfish. He then asked him to put the ferocious beast carcasses in it.

After that, he flew towards the east gate.

This was the first irrational choice he made when he came to the supernatural continent.

However, he should not regret it!
