Chapter 1247: The top five on the 1248 prodigy roll

Translator: 5496903

Wang Xian looked at Ren Xingchen and then at Ling Jian ‘ER.

Both of them had saved them before, but they were not the kind of people who would pull out their swords to help out when they saw injustice.

He would not have made a move if he did not have some connections.

However, Wang Xian was not interested in letting them follow him.

Both of them were very strong. They were ranked third and fourth on the prodigy roll.

However, that was all. He would be a burden if he brought the two of them along. Furthermore, they could not be like the members of the Dragon Palace who had unlimited potential to improve themselves.

Especially in the tomb of the demi-human. It was even more impossible for him to bring them along.

“You guys should stop causing trouble for me. You have provoked the Hanhai dynasty. Now, you should think about how to escape from their pursuit!”

Wang Xian looked at Ling Jian ‘er, shook his head, and said in a speechless manner.

After he finished speaking, he looked at Ren Xingchen and shrugged. “If you guys are stronger than me, I would be happy to follow you. However, it’s better to forget about it now!” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

After Wang Xian finished speaking, he waved his hand at them. With a move, he entered the heaven’s pride stage that belonged to him!

Ling Jian ‘er and Ren Xingchen frowned slightly as they watched him enter.

“I will definitely catch up to senior as soon as possible. Definitely!”

After a long silence, Ren Xingchen revealed a determined expression and clenched his fists tightly.

After he finished speaking, he flew towards the Heaven’s pride stage that belonged to him.

Ling Jian ‘er stood there in a daze as she looked ahead. Her cold expression seemed to have melted.

“AO AO!”

Xiao Ha, who was at the side, licked her face and cried out.

She slowly lowered her head and flew towards her heaven’s pride stage.

The Heaven’s pride stage was extremely safe. Even the top experts of the Hanhai Empire would not be able to break through it.

Moreover, the entire Heaven’s pride stage occupied a five kilometer radius. If the experts of the Hanhai Empire really came here to kill them, they could completely hide inside.

Therefore, it was very safe to stay in the Heaven’s pride stage.

The Liuhai region was very, very large, and the entire area was at least two to three times the size of earth.

About ten thousand kilometers away from the ladyboy graveyard, there was a huge mountain range.

In this mountain range, a mountain peak that pierced straight into the clouds was exceptionally eye-catching.

The entire mountain peak emitted golden light, and its shape was like a sharp sword.

At the top of the Golden Sword Mountain, a white-haired middle-aged man stood there.

The white clouds passed through his waist, making him look like an immortal god.

In front of him, there was a golden longsword.

“Natural disasters, earthly calamities, and human lives. You brought this upon yourself. You Can’t Live!”

The white-haired middle-aged man seemed to have stood there for a very, very long time.

He murmured, but his voice was like thunder.

“No matter how sharp a sword is, there is still something that can not be broken. The Sword of gold, the Sword of slaughter!”

He raised his head slightly, his eyes still closed. Each word came out of his mouth one by one.

When each word came out of his mouth, an incomparably sharp golden longsword of a hundred meters appeared in the sky.

The longsword was filled with endless killing intent, as if it wanted to cut through everything.

“It’s the sect leader’s voice, it’s the sect leader’s voice. It’s been seven years, a whole seven years!”

“Clang Clang Clang Clang!”

“What’s going on, why is my sword trembling!”

“Mine too, I can’t control it any longer. Heavens, quickly look at the sky!”

The entire sword mountain seemed to have awoken. On the Sword Mountain, over 10,000 disciples raised their heads and looked towards the sky.

Experts flew out from the cave abodes of the Sword Mountain and looked up into the sky.

“Sect master, it’s been seven years. Sect master has been standing there for seven years!”

“Sect master, this is... This is going to happen!”

The elders looked up at the peak of the mountain with excitement on their faces.

“Sword of gold...”

At this moment, the thunderous voice sounded again.

The Golden Sword.

After saying these three words, the voice seemed to be deep in thought, as if it was comprehending something.

“Sword of protection, all the killing is because of... Protection!”

When the last sentence was said, hundreds of terrifying longswords in the sky began to revolve around the peak of the mountain.

The terrifying longswords carried a dazzling golden light.

Below, the metal longswords in everyone’s hands were all trembling.

“Sect master... sect master, this is... Haha, The Heavenly Sword Sect is fortunate!”

An old man raised his head and looked up. His body was trembling, and tears flowed down his face.

“All killing is because of protection!”

An old man holding a sword staff muttered, and then his expression changed slightly.

“Quickly send someone to welcome the young Miss Back!”

“Old Ling, you go personally and lead ten insightful void martial artists, no, twenty. You must escort the young miss back safely. You Must Be Quick!”

The pale-faced elder with the sword staff ordered loudly.

“Yes!”

Around them, an elder hurriedly responded, his eyes flickering with a luster.

The sect master who had been silent for seven years had awoken. Moreover, he had broken through the demonic barrier seven years ago and comprehended a dharma idol.

Guardian!

Just these two words, they knew what this meant.

Especially when it was coupled with the words ‘the natural disaster, the earthly calamity, and the human life that had just begun, they had brought their own sins upon themselves, and could not live’!

He knew that the sect leader had already completely walked out.

However, after walking out, he would be protected. Everyone knew who he was protecting.

...

The other places did not know what had happened in the Heaven’s sword sect.

On The Prodigy stage, the Nameless Heaven’s pride expert began his journey of breaking through.

According to the words he had once said in front of the Prodigy stage, he wanted to break through the prodigy roll.

Among them, 80% of them thought that the Nameless Heaven’s pride expert had such strength because the strength that he displayed was simply too terrifying!

The Heaven’s pride battle began. The next few battles were as expected.

Tang Ling ‘er, who was ranked 13th among the heaven’s pride experts, immediately admitted defeat.

Those ranked 12th, 11th, 10th, and 9th all admitted defeat.

The moment Wang Xian issued the challenge, they immediately admitted defeat.

There was no need for them to accept the challenge.

Although they were all heaven’s favorites and it was against their will to be strong if they didn’t fight, they didn’t have the qualifications to fight against a heaven’s favorite who had defeated them in an instant.

All the way to the 9th place, all of them surrendered. All the way to the 8th place, they wanted to fight back.

In the end, they were defeated within five moves.

The 7th place, they were defeated within five moves.

The 6th place, Tang Yuan, directly surrendered and did not fight with them.

The 5th place, Luo Shihua, directly surrendered and did not fight with them.

All the way to the 5th place, it only took a short day.

However, in this one day, there were two battles that attracted the attention of everyone, causing everyone to be extremely shocked.

One was Ren Xingchen challenging Tang Feng, who was ranked second, and Tang Feng was defeated.

Following that, Ling Jian ‘er challenged Tang Feng, who was ranked third, and Tang Feng was defeated once again.

Now, The Prodigy roll had completely changed. Qian Ye, who was ranked first, Ren Xingchen, who was ranked second, Ling Jian ‘ER, who was ranked third, and Tang Feng, who was ranked fourth.

As well as the nameless person who was ranked fifth.

Only the top five on the Prodigy roll were truly peerless prodigies!
