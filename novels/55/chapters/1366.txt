Chapter 1367: Blood flowed like a river

“Boom!”

“King of Southern Cloud, let me play with you!”

Hovering above the city wall, a faint smile appeared on Wang Xian’s face. His voice was transmitted directly into the ears of the king of Southern Cloud, whose expression was constantly changing.

He opened his mouth slightly and the five elements grinding mill slowly appeared above his head. Gradually, it became a radius of a thousand meters.

“Fourth level of the Void Interpretation!”

Sensing the threat from Wang Xian, the king of Southern Cloud looked a little embarrassed.

He agreed to attack the Dragon and Phoenix Empire. Initially, he thought that the dragon and Phoenix Empire was a lamb waiting to be slaughtered.

He did not need to expend much energy to take them down.

However, he did not expect that two terrifying powerhouses at the fourth level of the void interpretation would suddenly appear. Furthermore, there were more than 3,000 terrifying creatures.

This time, the strength that they brought along was only seven people at the third level of the void interpretation realm.

Initially, he thought that seven people at the third level of the void interpretation realm was considered too many. However, there were nine terrifying creatures at the third level of the void interpretation realm.

This gave the king of southern cloud a bad premonition.

“Today, your 400,000-strong army shall stay here!”

Wang Xian was floating above the city. He did not rush out. After he finished speaking, he waved his arm and the five elements millstone directly attacked the king of Southern Cloud.

“Are you courting death? You want to leave us here? You Don’t have the ability to do so!”

The King of Southern Cloud held the Golden Greatsword in his hand and raised both of his hands. He attacked the five elements millstone directly.

A thousand-meter-long golden sword ray seemed to have opened up the world as it slashed towards the five elements millstone.

The terrifying golden sword Ray vowed to split the five elements millstone into two.

“Weng!”

However, the five elements millstone slowly rotated and a flame burned towards the sword light.

The five elements rotated and fire countered metal!

The sword light dissipated before it reached the front of the five elements millstone.

However, the five elements millstone rotated again and a destructive energy covered the southern cloud king.

“What?”

The Southern Cloud King was shocked and stared at the five elements millstone in disbelief.

This was an attack released by that young man, but the opponent’s figure had yet to get close!

“Sword without trace, Break!”

Seeing the grey energy attack, the Southern Cloud King’s face was filled with golden light as his body emitted a resplendent radiance.

His entire figure became 100 meters in size as he slashed towards the grey energy.

“Boom!”

The terrifying collision sounded again. The collision of the two powerful energies released a powerful airwave.

“Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!”

The miserable shrieks sounded from the surroundings. The Southern Cloud King’s expression changed drastically.

He looked at his subordinates around him and took a deep breath. He stared at the five elements millstone and said, “I’m going to break you!”

His body moved and he flew thousands of meters into the sky. He stared at the five divine dragons on the five elements millstone, and a bright light flashed in his eyes.

“Golden rain, descend!”

He roared, and numerous golden needles appeared behind him. Each needle was about a meter long.

The golden needles gathered together and attacked the five divine dragons on the five elements millstone.

The Five Elements Millstone spun, and the Fire Divine Dragon faced the golden needles, emitting fireballs.

Once again, the Southern Cloud King’s attack was blocked by the five elements millstone.

“My God, Lord Wang is so strong. He can easily fight against the Southern Cloud King with just a magical treasure. He’s too powerful!”

“Haha, Lord Wang Is Invincible. Look, look over there. Our Queen is not at a disadvantage in the battle with the Star Moon King. She’s even able to move with ease!”

“That fourth-level insightful emptiness realm expert from the Howling Wind dynasty was also blocked by Lord Heaven’s Eye Demon Beast. Haha!”

“Look at the battle below. Lord Wang’s subordinates are so strong. Those nine gigantic creatures have already killed two insightful emptiness realm experts. Oh My God, the 400,000-strong army below is being massacred!”

In the dragon-phoenix royal city, when all the citizens saw Wang Xian floating in the sky calmly and controlling a treasure to fight against the King of Southern Cloud Kingdom with ease, they almost knelt down and worshipped him.

This was simply too awesome!

In other locations, their queen, the leader of the Heaven’s Eye Demonic Beast, was suppressing the powerhouses of the Star Moon King and the Howling Wind dynasty.

Not to mention the other places, where the nine flood dragons were wreaking havoc and the demon monkey thunder prawns were massacring crazily!

“This is our dynasty, our queen, our King!”

The people who had been following the dragon-phoenix dynasty since its establishment were so excited that tears welled up in their eyes.

If they didn’t give up on this dynasty, the dynasty wouldn’t give up on them either.

“Kill, kill ruthlessly, Hahaha!”

On the battlefield, all the generals of the dragon-phoenix dynasty had excited expressions on their faces.

They felt that their bodies were filled with endless fighting spirit.

With the appearance of Lord King’s subordinates from the Dragon Palace, those powerful creatures were able to suppress the 400,000 strong army. They could even follow behind and attack.

400,000 soldiers, the elites of the three dynasties, how many half-step void interpretation experts could there be? 100 was more than enough, right?

However, the group of creatures from the Dragon Palace had at least 1,000 half-step void interpretation experts.

If you wanted to kill these 900 half-step void interpretation experts, you had to bring out 3,000 to 4,000 transcendent-level rank-9 experts.

Were there 3,000 to 4,000 transcendent-level rank-9 experts in the 400,000-strong army? Obviously not.

Not to mention, the lowest rank 9 transcendents from the other factions!

The dragon-phoenix Dynasty’s soldiers were filled with excitement.

“The battle has only just begun!”

However, at this moment, at the rear of the heavenly eye arrow, the only void interpretation expert of the Dolphin clan muttered.

“Weng!”

A special sound wave directly covered the entire battlefield.

Streams of water condensed in the sky.

The black clouds slowly condensed, and some poisonous snakes at the back stuck out their tongues. Their mouths moved slightly, and the pitch-black liquid directly entered the dark clouds in the sky.

Blue Raindrops and black raindrops covered the entire battlefield.

“Roar Roar!”

When the sound wave’s assistance entered the entire battlefield, the demon monkey and the thunder shrimp let out an excited roar.

Their minds were clear, and their bodies were filled with power.

With the Dolphins’support, they could increase their combat power by at least 30% .

One should not underestimate a small 30% . This 30% could turn the tide of the battle.

Moreover, when the sound waves entered the ears of the 400,000 soldiers, they were stunned.

They had been feeling that an invisible energy was disturbing their thoughts, and their combat power was greatly reduced.

“Why do I feel that my body is filled with power, and my mind is much clearer!”

A dragon and Phoenix dynasty soldier suddenly felt the change in his body, and his face was filled with excitement as he shouted loudly.

“Me too, it’s that special sound wave. This must be Lord Wang’s special talent. Haha, it’s simply too strong, Kill, Kill, Kill!”

Another soldier shouted excitedly.

“Crash!”

At this moment, Raindrops fell from the sky.

Black Raindrops fell on the soldiers of the three dynasties.

Blue Raindrops fell on the members of the Dragon Palace and the soldiers of the Dragon and Phoenix dynasties.

The Slaughter had just begun!
