Chapter 1539: 1539 suppressing all geniuses 2

At the age of 35, he had the strength of a third level void interpretation, breaking the record of an outstanding disciple of the Wuji Empire.

Wuqing city was made an exception to become the crown prince. In the entire Wuji Empire, it was in the limelight and was called Wuqing City by everyone in the vast region.

The title of Wuji Imperial City was made by him.

After he broke through to rank three of the void interpretation realm, he challenged all the rank three void interpretation realm experts in the Wuji Imperial City.

He challenged more than 20 experts of the same rank without a single defeat, so he was called the Wuji Imperial City, Wu Qing city.

He was close to 50 years old now, and he wanted to break through to rank four of the void interpretation realm before that, breaking the record of the entire vast region!

Wu Qing City walked toward the mansion, walking like a dragon and striding like a tiger. His body emitted the aura of an emperor.

Even he Yuan’s aura was quite different from Wu Qing Cheng’s.

“This must be the crown prince of Wu Qing Cheng!”

Wang Xian looked at Wu Qing Cheng and walked over with a smile on his face. He called out lightly.

“Who are you?”

Many pairs of eyes looked over. Before Wu Qing Cheng could speak, the middle-aged man at the side stared at Wang Xian and shouted coldly.

“I am Wang Xian, a radiant priest. I heard that the Crown Prince of Wu Qing Cheng will be holding a banquet in two days. I wonder if the Crown Prince of Wu Qing Cheng can send me another invitation letter!”

Wang Xian looked at Wuqing City and continued.

“You want an invitation letter from me? interesting. The invitation letter will only be sent to the heaven’s favorites of the major forces in the vast region. Those who are qualified will be invited!”

When Wuqing City saw a young man actually asking for an invitation letter from him in front of his mansion, a hint of interest appeared on his face as he said faintly.

“What kind of qualifications do you need?”

Wang Xian asked faintly.

“I need influence and strength!”

Wu Qing Cheng glanced at him before turning his head and continued walking forward. “If you have influence and strength, someone will send you an invitation letter!”

“Oh, your people might not be able to find me. It’s better to give it to me now!”

Wang Xian looked at Wu Qing Cheng walking towards his mansion and smiled. His figure moved and instantly appeared in front of Wu Qing Cheng.

Wu Qing Cheng’s pupils contracted slightly when he saw Wang Xian suddenly appearing in front of him.

The middle-aged man beside him was also slightly shocked. Darkness surged around him.

“I don’t have any other intentions. I just want an invitation letter. If I get the black curtain heart fruit in the future, I’ll give it to You Then!”

Wang Xian stretched out his hand and said with a smile.

“Kid...”

The middle-aged man was about to speak but was stopped by Wu Qingcheng. He waved his hand.

“Do you have the ability?”

Wu Qingcheng stretched out his hand and patted Wang Xian’s shoulder.

Wang Xian didn’t Dodge and said with a smile, “I think I do!”

The arm that was patting his shoulder had obviously stiffened. Wu Qingcheng’s eyes revealed a look of surprise and his expression changed slightly.

“Give this young master an invitation letter!”

Wu Qingcheng retracted his arm without batting an eyelid and said to the middle-aged man at the side.

“Yes!”

The middle-aged man at the side was slightly shocked. He immediately took out an invitation letter and handed it to Wang Xian.

“Thank you!”

Wang Xian smiled and nodded at him. He took the invitation letter and walked towards Ling Jian ‘er.

Before he left, he looked at the seat beside him and smiled.

Wu Qingcheng turned around and watched as Wang Xian’s figure gradually disappeared into the darkness. He slowly raised his arm.

“Your Highness the Crown Prince, your palm!”

When the old man saw Wu Qingcheng’s palm, he was slightly shocked and quickly exclaimed.

“He is very strong, much stronger than me. Uncle Ming, did you see his strength clearly?”

Wu Qingcheng stared at his palm in astonishment. Just now, he had placed his palm on the young man’s body, wanting to test his strength.

However, what he didn’t expect was that the other party’s light energy directly charged over.

He used the power of darkness to resist, but his palm was still corroded in an instant.

In just an instant, he felt that the other party’s strength was much stronger than his.

“He discovered me. This young man isn’t simple!”

A voice came from the darkness behind him.

“When did such a monstrous existence appear in the vast region? Even the southern royal family of the only sect doesn’t have such an outstanding young man!”

“Immediately investigate all information about this young man. I want to know everything about them!”

Wu Qing Cheng said with a grave expression as he slowly frowned.

“In this vast area, is there another young man who is more outstanding than me?”

He mumbled as he walked towards the mansion. His eyes were sparkling.

“That’s true. It was so effortless!”

Wang Xian held the invitation letter in his hand with a smile on his face.

What he needed to do next was to gain Ling Jian ‘ER’s good impression and make Ling Jian ‘er fall in love with him.

“I’m not very good at chasing girls. I’ve never chased girls before. Sigh, the river flows east for thirty years, but the river flows west for thirty years. Back then, Ling Jian ‘ER was pursuing me. Now, it’s my turn to pursue her!”

Wang Xian smiled and looked at Ling Jian ‘er who was sitting cross-legged in the room cultivating. Then, he began to study the blending of light and darkness. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Time passed slowly. The next day, Ling Jian ‘ER’s life was still very dull.

Wang Xian continued to play the role of a peeping devil and hid in the surroundings.

“Sister Bing Jian ‘er, let’s go. We are heading to the residence of the Crown Prince of Wuqing City. The banquet is about to begin!”

On the evening of the third day, the ninth prince, Bing Jinghuan, came to Ling Jian ‘ER’s courtyard and shouted at her.

“Alright, senior brother. Let’s Go!”

Ling Jian ‘er nodded. The group of them rode the carriage and headed towards the direction of Wuji Empire.

Wang Xian followed them all the way. He watched Ling Jian ‘er and the rest enter the residence of the Crown Prince of Wuqing City.

At this moment, luxurious cars were parked around the residence.

Most of the cars were pulled by void interpretation level ferocious beasts. It could be seen how noble the identity of the visitors was.

However, this was the territory of Wuji Empire. The people around were not too surprised.

Wang Xian appeared and looked at his clothes. He was dressed in white. With a move of his arm, a staff of light appeared in his hand.

He was dressed like a radiant priest.

Wang Xian walked straight to the residence.

“Please Take Out Your Invitation Card, Young Master!”

When he reached the entrance, the two beauties said softly.

Wang Xian passed the invitation card to them.

“Please follow me!”

A girl nodded and led Wang Xian inside.

The entire courtyard was planted with spiritual herbs of level eight or nine. The rich spiritual energy filled the entire courtyard, making the entire mansion look extremely luxurious.

The girl brought him to the left. After walking for about a kilometer, a man-made lake appeared in their sight. In the lake, there were black lotus flowers growing!

Each black lotus flower was emitting a strong power of darkness.

It was a spiritual herb of the void interpretation level!

Wang Xian looked at his surroundings in astonishment.

“Young master, in front of the Black Lotus Lake is the location where our crown prince is holding a banquet. There are already many young masters and Young Ladies Here!”

The girl pointed to the front and said to Wang Xian.
