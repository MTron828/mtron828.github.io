Chapter 1398: The 1398 members of the Dragon Palace came to pick up the brothers and bring them home

“Who do you think you are? Let’s go. I want to see who dares to stop us!”

When Wang Xian’s voice rang out, the entire area was silent.

Everyone held their weapons in their hands and walked straight into the distance.

The people from the Liu family and the gilded gold family felt the cold aura and did not dare to go forward to stop them.

Among the people present, the strongest one was only at level three of the Seethrough void tier. With such strength, it was impossible to stop him.

Furthermore, it was forbidden to use force in Xiao Yao City!

However, everyone was extremely shocked by Wang Xian’s words.

“Hiss, who do you think the Young City Lord is? This... This young man from the Dragon and Phoenix Empire is so arrogant!”

“He’s more than arrogant. I heard that he didn’t give the young city lord any face during the king’s auction. Now, he’s even saying who the young city Lord is. He’s extremely arrogant!”

“After being humiliated like this, the young castellan will definitely not let that young man off!”

“Unless the castellan makes a move, no one within a radius of 100,000 kilometers is a match for the Dragon and Phoenix Empire. Not to mention the addition of the Bamboo Mountain sect!”

Everyone around was shocked as they watched Wang Xian lead a group of people to take away the third young miss of the gilded gold family. All of them were discussing with their eyes wide open.

“Who do I think I am? Good, good!”

The young castellan’s face was extremely ferocious when he heard Wang Xian’s words. His body was trembling slightly as he said, “If I don’t Destroy Your Dragon and Phoenix Empire, My Carefree Army will not be able to live up to my expectations!”

As he spoke, his face turned ferocious as he stared at the backs of Wang Xian and the rest.

At this moment, a resplendent token appeared in front of him.

The token was completely black, and two carefree characters were written on it.

“Carefree token!”

“It’s the carefree token!”

When everyone saw the carefree token on the chest of the young city lord, their faces were filled with shock.

Everyone from the Liu residence and the Gilded Gold clan all bowed towards the token.

Carefree City, carefree token. This token was like an imperial edict.

The carefree token was given by the city lord to his core subordinates. In the entire carefree city, only four people possessed it.

One was the subordinate of the city lord of Carefree City who had followed him for more than a hundred years. The current head of carefree city, Xiao Qianhong!

The other was the Yao family patriarch of the Pill Medicine District.

The other two were in the hands of the wife of the city lord of Carefree City and the young city Lord respectively.

The carefree token could only be used once. It could mobilize all the forces and families of carefree city. Once the carefree token was used, no one dared to disobey!

A few decades ago, when the Yao family was in danger, they used the carefree token once. Now, the Yao family was one of the top four clans in carefree city.

As for the other three carefree tokens, they had yet to be used!

This carefree token was a gift from the city lord to the young city lord on his eighteenth birthday.

Thirty years had passed, and this was the first time it appeared in front of everyone’s eyes.

“Pa!”

The young city Lord grabbed the carefree token on his chest, and his face was filled with endless frost!

“Gather all the forces of the carefree city. I want to kill that group of families from the dragon-phoenix Dynasty!”

The young city Lord’s cold voice came out of his mouth and entered everyone’s ears. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“What? The young city Lord actually wants to kill that group of people from the dragon-phoenix Dynasty!”

“It seems that the young city lord is really angry. He actually asked him to use the carefree token. This carefree token can only be used once!”

“Those people from the dragon-phoenix dynasty are going to be finished. Once the carefree token is used, all the families and aristocratic families in the entire carefree city can be mobilized!”

Everyone took a deep breath, their eyes shining.

“Kill that arrogant guy. Kill everyone from the dragon-phoenix Dynasty!”

Liu Shaohua’s face was slightly malevolent as he roared loudly.

“I want to kill that fellow with my own hands!”

The young city Lord’s entire body was filled with a terrifying killing intent as he raised the carefree token in his hand.

“Pass down my order, all experts and aristocratic families of Xiaoyao city, come to the Weapons District!”

“The carefree token is out. All experts and aristocratic families of Xiaoyao city, come to the Weapons District!”

An expert from the Liu residence shouted and immediately informed all the experts of the aristocratic families of the carefree city.

The carefree city was the most neutral city. The carefree city lord could be said to be the king of the carefree city.

All the aristocratic families and families had to obey the orders of the Carefree City Lord.

The carefree token represented the carefree city. Once the token was out, no one dared to disobey!

In an instant, the entire carefree city moved.

“Carefree token, what’s going on? The young city lord actually used the carefree token. All the experts from the aristocratic families have gathered at the weapon area!”

“Oh my God, the young city Lord actually took out the carefree token. What is the young city lord trying to do?”

“I heard that the people from the dragon and Phoenix Empire insulted the young city lord. In a fit of rage, the young city Lord took out the carefree token and wanted to exterminate those people from the dragon and Phoenix Empire!”

“They are courting death. They actually dared to provoke the young city lord. I think that the Dragon and Phoenix Empire is tired of living!”

“That Dragon and Phoenix Empire has just risen. They are like a newborn calf that is not afraid of tigers. Now, they are going to be finished!”

The news of the young city lord using the carefree token immediately spread throughout the entire carefree city.

All the experts from the aristocratic families in the carefree city started to move and head towards the weapons district.

Xiaoyao city’s strength was not weaker than the dynasty. Even if the city lord was not included, it was still an extremely terrifying force.

In the entire city, there were five insightful void Tier 4 experts, and more than ten insightful void Tier 3 experts.

As for the rest of the insightful void tier experts, there were 50 to 60 of them!

This was definitely an extremely terrifying force.

“Yi, the dragon-phoenix dynasty has offended the young city lord. Let’s go and take a look!”

“Alright, Alright. It’s best if the dragon-phoenix dynasty can be destroyed!”

In Xiaoyao City, some experts from other dynasties and sects smiled when they heard the news.

They were extremely fearful of the dragon-phoenix dynasty that had risen after destroying four dynasties.

Now that the other party had provoked the young city lord, it would be even better if they could be destroyed!

Very quickly, experts from other dynasties also rushed over to watch the show.

This group of people added up to 50 to 60 insightful emptiness realm experts.

“Master, the young city Lord has used the carefree order!”

However, at this moment, at the back of the carefree city, on a 10,000 meter high peak.

Halfway up the peak, there was a cave.

The inside of the cave was extremely luxurious, covering an area of two to three kilometers.

In a luxuriously decorated room, an old man respectfully walked to the side of a middle-aged man and reported.

The middle-aged man wore black and white clothes, and the word carefree was written on his chest.

He stared at the chessboard in front of him.

The middle-aged man was the mayor of Xiaoyao City!

Hearing the old servant’s report, the mayor of Xiaoyao city slightly raised his eyebrows.

“Soldiers used the carefree token. What’s the matter?”

“Master, a few people from the dragon-phoenix dynasty provoked the young master. The young master took out the carefree order out of anger.”

The old man immediately said.

“This matter is not the young master’s fault!”

As the old man spoke, he told him about the two incidents between the young mayor and the dragon-phoenix dynasty.

“Oh? Has Our Xiaoyao city been neutral for a long time? A random dynasty won’t give face to our Xiaoyao Mountain’s son?”

Suddenly, the middle-aged man slowly stood up and said coldly.
