Chapter 1197: Under the rage of Prince No. 11

Translator: 5496903

He, Long Xiaotian, held this banquet mainly for the purpose of roping in some heaven’s favored sons and some powerful subordinates.

However, if he offended Wang Xian because of this banquet, then this banquet wouldn’t be worth it at all.

In his opinion, even if all the people present surrendered to his subordinates, they wouldn’t be as important as Wang Xian.

Putting aside the powerful alchemy master, his unbelievable beast taming ability was simply heaven-defying.

Long Xiaotian had already fantasized about it for the past two days. When he got to know Wang Xian better, he would ask him to train a batch of ferocious beasts for him.

When the time came, he would build a strong cavalry battle team which could almost rival the top battle team of the Guanglong Kingdom.

When he thought of this, he couldn’t help but grin while he was sleeping.

Now, Yin Xianfeng and the people of the six element sect wanted to keep him here?

Long Xiaotian didn’t need to think to know the meaning of staying.

He looked at Yin Xianfeng with a gloomy face!

Yin Xianfeng was slightly stunned when he saw long Xiaotian’s expression, but he didn’t think too much about it.

“Second prince, we must give an explanation for his contempt for our six element sect today!”

As he spoke, he looked at the middle-aged elder at the side.

“He dared to seriously injure our disciple in our six element sect’s territory. If we don’t kill him, he really thinks that our six element sect is easy to bully!”

The elder of the six element sect said slowly with an expressionless face.

“Brother, today, this is the banquet venue of Our Light Dragon Dynasty’s second Prince!”

As soon as the middle-aged elder of the six elements sect finished speaking, Bai Qingshan, who was wearing a white robe, slowly walked out and stared at him as he said faintly.

“Huh?”

The middle-aged elder of the six elements sect was slightly stunned as he looked at Bai Qingshan in surprise.

“Yin Xianfeng, do you know that he is a friend that I personally invited to the banquet that I’m holding here today?”

“You want to F * cking keep the person that I invited? Are you courting death? !”

At this moment, Long Xiaotian’s mouth suddenly burst out words that stunned everyone.

“Bang!”

However, what shocked everyone even more was that his figure moved and his fist landed heavily on Yin Xianfeng’s face.

In an instant, Yin Xianfeng was completely dumbfounded.

He did not expect that the second prince would actually attack him.

He was the target that all the princes of the Light Dragon Dynasty had been fighting to recruit, but now, the second prince had directly attacked him without giving him any face.

The powerful force caused his face to twist slightly, and his head to be in a daze.

This force was not small at all.

His arm had already been chopped off, and he was even sent flying backward, flying more than ten meters away.

“Bang!”

His body landed heavily on the ground.

Everyone was stunned!

The second prince actually beat up Yin Xianfeng?

This...

“You don’t know whether you’re Dead or alive. If I find out that you’re secretly dealing with brother Wang Xian in the future, be careful of Your Dog Life!”

Long Xiaotian didn’t give him any face and said directly.

Yin Xianfeng, who was knocked to the ground, spat out a mouthful of blood when he heard his words.

“This...”

Everyone from the six element sect gulped and looked at the Elder.

The middle-aged elder from the six element sect slowly frowned.

He looked at the white-robed void interpretation expert who was staring at him with a smile on his face, and then at the second prince who had an icy expression on his face. His expression was somewhat awkward.

He knew that the disciples of Yin Xianfeng had provoked the wrong person this time!

That young man was obviously highly valued by the second prince. He didn’t even give the six element sect any face.

“Phew!”

The middle-aged elder of the six element sect took a deep breath and said, “Second prince, it’s our six element sect’s fault for this matter. I’m here to apologize to you. I hope you won’t be angry!”

As he spoke, he cupped his hands slightly.

The six element sect couldn’t afford to offend the Light Dragon Empire. There was a high chance that the second prince in front of them would become the king of the Light Dragon Empire.

They could not afford to offend him.

Therefore, they could only apologize.

The people who were invited by the second Prince also took a deep breath. Their eyes landed on Wang Xian.

“Who is he exactly? How could he make the second prince want to help him vent his anger by offending the six element sect?”

Some people thought to themselves.

“Please take the people of your six element sect away!”

Long Xiaotian looked at the elders of the six element sect with a sullen face and said directly.

“Yes, our six element sect will waive the expenses for this banquet. Consider it as an apology to the second Prince!”

The middle-aged elder of the six element sect squeezed out a smile and said.

Long Xiaotian ignored him and walked directly to Wang Xian’s side. A hint of bitterness appeared on his face. “Brother Wang Xian, did I disturb your mood?”

“No, it’s fine. I might have disturbed your business!”

Wang Xian looked at the disciples of the six elements sect who were carried away and shook his head.

“How can that be? It’s my fault for not entertaining them properly. Come, come!”

Long Xiaotian heaved a sigh of relief and gestured for Wang Xian to take a seat at the side.

He looked around and cupped his hands. “Everyone, I’m really sorry for not entertaining them properly!”

“I didn’t expect some unpleasant things to happen in the short period of time that I was away. Everyone, I’m sorry. Let me introduce to everyone. These 56 people are my brothers who followed me...”

Long Xiaotian was obviously very good at dealing with situations. In just a few short sentences, he skipped over the previous incident and introduced his subordinates.

He didn’t introduce Wang Xian because he had his own selfish motives.

He didn’t want his brothers to know that if they knew that Wang Xian was a powerful Beast Tamer, they might invite him with a huge sum of money.

His relationship with Wang Xian wasn’t that deep yet. He was afraid that the man whom he had finally met would run away.

Wang Xian didn’t mind either. He sat at the side and watched with a smile.

However, at this moment, everyone paid a lot of attention to the young man who caused the second prince to fall out with the six elements sect.

“How can a bloodline cultivator be so important to the second prince? How is this possible? !” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Sitting opposite him, Xu Wenling looked at Wang Xian, who was sitting next to the second prince, with a gloomy face.

After seeing the second prince’s strength, Xu Wenling had already decided to join him and take a gamble.

Just now, the second prince was sitting next to him and spoke with great sincerity to rope him in.

But now, the second prince was sitting next to a bloodline cultivator, and he even whispered to him from time to time. Obviously, he didn’t want to be ignored.

What kind of treatment did this young man have.

Xu Wenling was extremely depressed, and sat there without saying a word with an embarrassed expression.

“The second prince, Long Xiaotian, and that Kid!”

At this moment, in a room in the villa, Yin Xianfeng was sitting on the bed with a ferocious expression, holding his arm and growling.

“Don’t do stupid things. Long Xiaotian is not someone you can provoke!”

The short-haired young man saw his expression and reminded him coldly.

“I’m not reconciled. No matter what, I, Yin Xianfeng, am a favored son of heaven. Long Xiaotian is not giving me face!”

Yin Xianfeng’s expression changed drastically, and then he narrowed his eyes like a poisonous snake. “The eighth Prince and the second prince have never been on good terms. Today’s humiliation, I’ll make sure you never get the throne!”

“With the eighth prince around, even if I find an opportunity to kill that kid, the second prince can’t do anything to me!”
