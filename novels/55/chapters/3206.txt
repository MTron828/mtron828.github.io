Chapter 3207: 3206 golden dragon and charming dragon

“Oh? This sculpture has a great attraction to you?”

Wang Xian looked at the female snake and raised his eyebrows slightly.

“Yes, Dragon King. This sculpture has a great attraction and pressure to me. The image of this sculpture is very similar to… to our Creator.”

The female snake’s expression changed as she spoke.

“Creator?”

Wang Xian was astonished when he heard her words.

Creator? He had heard such a powerful title before.

What kind of existence dared to call himself a creator?

“Yes. According to the records of our Sheji race, we were created by the Creator. The Creator is an omnipotent existence.”

“She has a human body and a dragon tail. She is the supreme existence and a powerful ancestral witch in the universe. She created our Sheji race and gave us life.”

The female snake said with slight respect.

“Ancestral Wizard?”

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly when he heard her words.

The wizard lineage was a very powerful and heaven-defying lineage. They were a different kind of scientists.

They studied formations, studied sorcery, and studied bloodlines and constitutions.

However, the wizard lineage could be divided into two directions.

One was the direction of the formation.

The other was the direction of the bloodline constitution.

The formation was the current direction of the Sky Formation.

As for the bloodline constitution, it was more inclined towards close combat.

They used powerful and strange witchcraft to modify their bloodlines and even modify their bodies.

They transferred the limbs of powerful existences onto their own bodies.

They could transform themselves into terrifying monsters.

In order to pursue extreme combat strength, there were even wizards who joined the limbs of various powerful creatures onto their own bodies.

The Ancestral Wizard was the pinnacle of the Wizards, and the Ancestral Wizard’s strength was the corresponding ruler of the universe.

If one were to say that the Snake Belle tribe was created by an ancestral wizard, it was really possible.

It was not impossible for a powerful ancestral wizard to build a tribe that could fight above their level through their powerful abilities.

“A statue shouldn’t be so strange. Now that I have the combat strength of a level four universe knight, it is very difficult for a statue to kill a level four universe knight unwittingly.”

Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled.

A statue of the creator of the Snake Princess clan. Although an ancestral wizard was extremely terrifying, a statue of him wouldn’t have such a strange ability.

“Sky Formation.”

Wang Xian hesitated for a moment and transmitted his voice to the sky formation.

“Dragon King!”

Soon, the Sky Formation flew over and bowed to Wang Xian.

“Take a look and see if this thing is a powerful magic tool.”

As Wang Xian spoke, he raised the statue in his hand and said to him.

“HMM?”

The heaven’s formation looked over and his pupils narrowed slightly. His eyes sparkled.

His body moved and came in front of Wang Xian. He touched it with his hand.

“Dragon King, this… This might not be a statue or a magic tool.”

The Heaven’s formation spoke with a grave tone.

“HMM? Then what is this?”

Wang Xian looked at him in astonishment.

“This might be a corpse.”

Tian Chen said with a contemplative look on his face, “According to the information I’ve read about wizards, I’ve seen something similar.”

“Bloodline and physique wizards, their path of cultivation is to transform and strengthen themselves, turning their bodies into the most powerful and bizarre existence.”

“After the death of bloodline and physique wizards, their bodies will become the most powerful wizard tools. This sculpture should be a corpse.”

As Tian Chen spoke, his face was filled with affirmation.

“It’s actually a corpse.”

“No Wonder, no wonder it’s So Bizarre.”

Wang Xian was slightly surprised as he sized it up carefully.

A surge of energy entered the sculpture. He could sense the dragon’s blood and other energies inside.

“Is this the body that the ancestral wizard modified himself? Even if he’s dead, the energy inside didn’t disappear.”

Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled as he spoke.

Moreover, was this ancestral wizard completely dead?

It was really extremely strange.

Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled. Suddenly, he looked at the black branch on the ancestral tree behind him.

That Black Branch was formed from the forbidden art, the heaven-pilfering pulse changing technique.

Now, this branch also possessed the ability to do the same.

Suddenly, he had an idea. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Why don’t I let the members of the Dolphin clan try it out?”

Wang Xian hesitated for a moment and decided to give it a try. Even if the members of the Dolphin clan died, they could still be revived.

However, if he succeeded, perhaps the dragon palace would be able to give birth to a powerful dragon seed.

After all, this was the bloodline and physique of the ancestral wizard.

“Prime Minister Gui, go and call a member of the Dolphin clan to conduct an experiment. Get Her to come to the dragon transformation pool.”

As Wang Xian spoke, he waved his arm and brought the female snake to the front of the dragon transformation pool in an instant.

The Heaven Formation also moved and followed behind.

Soon, the leader of the Dolphin clan and a member of the Dolphin clan flew over.

Wang Xian placed the branch filled with symbols on the ancestral witch’s corpse and placed the other end of the branch on the member of the Dolphin clan.

“Enter the dragon transformation pool and see if there are any changes.”

He instructed.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

The member of the Dolphin clan replied immediately and flew into the pool.

Buzz

When she entered the dragon transformation pool, Wang Xian instantly felt the black symbols on the branch start to move.

Waves of energy slowly surged into the member of the Dolphin clan.

Wang Xian squinted his eyes slightly as he watched. After confirming that there was no danger, he waited quietly for the news.

“Ding! A new dragon species has been born in the Dragon Palace, the charming dragon species. Congratulations, host!”

“Ding! Due to energy reasons, the dragon palace can only nurture 1,000 charming dragon species!”

An hour later, the system’s voice rang out suddenly.

When Wang Xian heard the notification, a glint flashed across his eyes.

“Success!”

A smile appeared on his face.

What was the grade of the charming dragons?

They could only nurture 1,000 species of charming dragons, so the level of the charming dragons should not be low.

“It might also be a peak dragon species. It’s a pity that the number is a little low.”

Wang Xian mumbled as he looked at the dragon transformation pool expectantly.

Time flew by quickly. Wang Xian stood at the dragon transformation pool for more than ten hours.

“Huala!”

After more than ten hours, Wang Xian realized that the Dolphins inside had undergone a huge change.

They had a human body and a dragon tail. There was also a hint of a strange aura on their bodies.

Their long wavy hair was exceptionally beautiful. Every move they made was soul-stirring.

She had dark red eyes. When she looked into his eyes, she felt that it was extremely strange.

“This… This Is?”

At the side, the female snake looked at the figure in the dragon transformation pool with a shocked expression on her face.

“Dragon King!”

The newly promoted charming dragon flew over and greeted Wang Xian with a smile.

“How many levels higher can you fight?”

Wang Xian squinted his eyes and asked expectantly.

“Level three, a peak dragon species.”

The Mei Long replied with excitement in its eyes.
