Chapter 2950: 2,950 easily swept across the veluriyam domain’s tremor 8

“Hiss, suppression, complete suppression!”

“In just a few seconds of attack, more than ten God emperors and Yao Xie were killed!”

“Are those experts from the Dragon Palace? How can they be so strong? Our Domain Lord and the others didn’t even make a move, but the experts from the Dragon Palace completely suppressed the two demon caves!”

“Is this the power of the Dragon Palace? How can it be so terrifying!”

!!

Shock, shock, and disbelief!

All the citizens of the glazed domain and the godly monarchs in the sky who were closest all stared ahead with wide eyes.

Their throats squirmed, and even the godly monarchs swallowed a mouthful of saliva.

The strength of the experts from the Dragon Palace shocked them.

They didn’t even need to make a move in this war.

The citizens below felt even more incredulous.

They knew that the experts of the Dragon Palace had come to help them and help them tide over this crisis.

But when the demon cave rushed over, they still felt some fear and fear.

In their eyes, the Dragon Palace was very strong, but how strong could it be?

Stronger Than Liu Li?

But in the face of the demon cave and the demons of the chimei territory who had broken through them, they had to take it seriously.

However, the six members of the Dragon Palace had charged over and suppressed the two demon caves.

More than ten evil god Emperors had been killed in an instant.

What kind of strength was this?

The six experts of the Dragon Palace didn’t even need their domain lords to attack!

The two demon caves, which could destroy their veluriyam devil caves, had been suppressed by the six members of the Dragon Palace.

Looking at the battle ahead, Yao Xie from the two demon dens was probably going to be destroyed!

“The Dragon Palace is too powerful. Haha, That’s Great! We don’t have to be in a hurry to escape. We can just watch Yao Xie being killed here!”

“Crazy! The strength of the Dragon Palace is simply heaven-defying. are the six experts of the Dragon Palace all at the third level of the Divine Emperor Realm?”

Everyone shouted excitedly.

There were also experts from the glazed domain who shouted excitedly to the people who were quite far away, “The six experts of the dragon palace have easily suppressed the two demon dens. Those two demon dens are about to be destroyed by the Dragon Palace. The Dragon Palace is invincible. We don’t have to run anymore!”!

Excitement, excitement!

Not long ago, they were worried about their lives and that the demonic beast lair would attack them.

Now, the experts of the Dragon Palace had come out and suppressed the two great demon lairs, saving all of them.

They felt as though they had survived a calamity.

They were boiling and cheering!

The people who were far away looked over excitedly, even though they could not see everything here.

“Is this the strength of the Dragon Palace?”

The domain Lord Sacred Master and the others muttered as they looked at the scene in front of them in shock.

Six existences at the third level of the divine emperor realm were able to completely suppress the four great devil dens and the Four Great Demonic Beast leaders.

If the glazed domain had the strength of the Dragon Palace, it would not have been conquered and it would not have fled.

“Roar Roar Roar, it’s too simple. These beasts, one attack at a Time!”

At this moment, the voice of a devouring dragon came from the battlefield ahead.

Four Devouring Dragons were attacking the bewitching evil leader and bewitching evil sprite leader. The other two devouring dragons were wreaking havoc in the bewitching evil army.

They rushed in front of the bewitching evil god-emperors. Under the terrifying claws, they could not resist at all.

One claw killed a bewitching evil god-emperor.

In a short period of time, more than half of the fifty god-emperors and bewitching evil were killed.

The gap was too big. Even a level two god-emperor Yao Xie could not withstand their attacks for more than 30 seconds.

The Devouring Dragon was not among the top dragon species in the Dragon Palace, but its combat power was still terrifying.

They were a powerful race formed by the fusion of the bug race and the Divine Dragon.

They inherited the rapid reproduction of the bug race and the powerful attacks of the Divine Dragon.

They also inherited the attacks of the bug race and the Divine Dragon.

One by one, the demonic god Emperors were slaughtered by them. The rest of the demonic beasts were killed by their auras.

Those demonic beasts below the god Emperor level did not dare to approach them.

The weaker demonic beasts were trembling in the void.

The Devouring Dragon that unleashed its full strength made demonic beasts feel terrified.

“Awooooo!”

The two leaders of Yao Xie who were besieged by the devouring dragon cried out in fear.

Facing the attack of the devouring dragon, they were completely suppressed.

Yao Xie’s concealing ability was completely useless in front of the two devouring dragons.

It was very difficult to break through the defense of the devouring dragon with an attack, and their speed was not faster than the devouring dragon.

In a one-on-two situation, the two leaders of Yao Xie could only take a beating.

“Die!”They roared in fear as they retreated to the demonic cave.

The two leaders were scared!

“The demonic god Emperor attacked one by one. The two leaders didn’t even have the strength to fight back. The Dragon Palace easily swept them away!”

Seeing the demonic god Emperor being easily slaughtered, the glazed domain and the sacred domain’s God emperors were in a daze.

The demonic god Emperor, who had conquered the glazed domain, was easily swept away by the Dragon Palace.

The Gap was too big!

The Dragon Palace was too strong!

Especially after hearing the words of the experts from the Dragon Palace, this group of beasts attacked one by one…

That Beast was the demonic god Emperor!

“The strength of the Dragon Palace really scares us. Many thanks to the Dragon Palace for destroying this group of Yao Xie!”

The governor looked forward and sighed slightly. He bowed to Prime Minister Gui and the others to express his respect.

“Thank you, Dragon Palace!”

At this moment, the other godly monarchs of the glazed domain also bowed and thanked him respectfully.

Now, they had realized that the glazed domain was on a completely different level compared to the Dragon Palace.

Moreover, they had a thought when they saw how strong the Dragon Palace was.

If the Dragon Palace was willing to help them take back the glazed domain, they were willing to submit to the Dragon Palace and respect the Dragon King.

“Hehe, no need to be so polite. It’s just a small matter!”

Prime Minister Gui waved his hand lightly and said indifferently. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Hehe, right, just give us the demonic corpse you killed later. Our Dragon Palace needs these resources!”

Mo Sha said.

“Of course, of course!”

The domain Lord immediately said, putting his status very low.

The sacred lord beside him took a deep breath and looked at the almost invincible Dragon Palace. His mind was full of thoughts.

Maybe soon, a king would be born in the starry sky!

Dragon Palace! Dragon King!

“The two evil leaders are escaping!”

At this moment, a god emperor exclaimed.

Some wounds appeared on the bodies of the two rank three God emperor evil leaders, and they flew into the demon cave in fear.

“HMPH, if you want to escape, I’ll devour your entire Demon Cave!”

The four devouring dragons saw them escape into the demon cave, and their eyes turned cold as they chased after them.

“I’ll go over and help quickly kill those two Yao Xie. I’ll leave this place to you!”

A devouring dragon saw them chasing after them and said. It also charged over.

“Then leave this place to me. Roar Roar Roar, die!”

The Devouring Dragon that was finally left outside the starry sky let out a roar. Its enormous body was slaughtering Yaoxie at a terrifying speed!
