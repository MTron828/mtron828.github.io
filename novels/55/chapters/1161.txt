Chapter 1162: 1163, kill the prince

Translator: 5496903

Let’s see who’s crazier!

In terms of craziness, Wang Xian had never been afraid of anyone!

“What do you want?”

Feng Luan looked at Wang Xian and stared at him with a twinkle in her eyes.

Wang Xian smiled. “Since you want to play, let’s play a bigger game!”

The Master of undercurrent was crazy. Since the Castellan’s residence wanted to destroy the dragon spike, he didn’t have to worry about anything else.

Since star-moon kingdom did not allow him to use the dragon spike, there was no need to be polite with the dragon spike.

He would take it. The third Prince would kill him!

Star-moon kingdom was very strong and had more than 20 insightful void martial artists. However, his dragon Spike had more than 170 dragon spikes.

Even if he were to play along with them, it would give star-moon kingdom a headache and even cause them heavy losses.

They could not afford to play, but Wang Xian could.

This time, he was going to assassinate a prince and warn star-moon kingdom. If they dared to deal with the dragon Spike, the dragon Spike would dare to deal with them as well.

Now that the dragon spike was in the dark, no one knew where their lair was. As long as they avoided powerhouses above the second level of the void interpretation stage, they would be unafraid of anyone.

“That’s good too. Let’s not stay in that place. Let’s go somewhere else!”

Feng Luan had already guessed what Wang Xian wanted to do. She nodded her head slowly and smiled at him.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded his head. Next, it was time for Bright Moon City to shake. It was not only bright moon city that was shaken. Soon after, the entire star-moon kingdom would be shaken as well.

The two of them changed their appearance and found a new restaurant.

“Dragon King!”

“Dragon King!”

Half an hour later, Long Yi and ao Yao rushed over and greeted Wang Xian respectfully.

“Long Yi, inform all the employers that the dragon Spike will not carry out today’s mission for the time being!”

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Long Yi was slightly puzzled but he still nodded his head.

“Ao Yao, Summon all the strange demons and assassinate the third Prince of Star Moon Kingdom tonight. Go and check the residence of the third prince and all the information!”

Wang Xian looked at Ao Yao and said slowly. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Ao Yao nodded, and her eyes revealed a cold glint.

The dragon Spike had been targeted twice, and one strange demon had been killed. As the leader of the Strange Demons, Ao Yao’s heart was already burning with anger.

“Tell all the spies to be careful. We will not accept the mission until the matter is over!”

Wang Xian told Long Yi again.

Now that the mayor’s mansion and the undercurrent assassin organization were going all out to deal with the dragon spike, it was extremely difficult for the dragon spike to gain a foothold in bright moon city.

Furthermore, there was a possibility of encountering a trap every time he received a commission.

Therefore, Wang Xian could only suspend the assassination mission of the dragon spike. He had to defeat Bright Moon City and star-moon kingdom first!

“It’s the Dragon King. Let’s send out our orders immediately!”

Long Yi nodded and left the restaurant carefully. He began to deal with the matter of the dragon spike.

Now, four spies had been killed directly. Including the previous one, there were only three spies of the dragon spike.

He needed to find some more spies.

In addition, he needed to inform the clients who had issued the mission that the completion of the mission would be delayed.

Wang Xian watched Long Yi leave with a contemplative look on his face.

This was a risky move. Once the assassination of the third prince was successful, it was very likely that the star-moon kingdom would be enraged. As long as he could withstand the attacks of the star-moon kingdom, the dragon spike could be considered to have truly established a foothold in the star-moon kingdom.

“Ao Yao, split 20 of the strange demons in Bright Moon City and transfer 80 of them from the Dragon Palace to the towns below the star-moon kingdom. Wait for my orders!”

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered as he spoke to Ao Yao.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Ao Yao nodded.

“The third prince has the protection of the void interpretation level armor. I have the poison developed by the eight-limbed dragon. It should be able to be used. Also, go and check out the residence of the third prince. Bring his body back tonight!”

“Yes!”

Watching Ao Yao leave, Wang Xian revealed a contemplative look on his face. Then, he smiled.

It All depended on tonight!

...

“What? Dragon Spike announced the suspension of tonight’s mission? What’s going on? What the F * ck!”

“D * MN. Two days ago, Dragon Spike said that he wouldn’t be late for the next mission. If he were to do this today, he would be slapping himself in the face!”

“It should be because the undercurrent master has put too much pressure on dragon spike. Today, the undercurrent master killed four people from Dragon Spike!”

“Now, the two major assassin organizations are going back and forth. If you slap me in the face, I’ll slap you in the face!”

When it was almost night time, suddenly, in the Bright Moon City Forum, the news of dragon Spike announcing the suspension of the mission was exposed.

This news caused everyone’s faces to reveal a stunned expression, and it quickly spread.

Countless people in Bright Moon City were discussing this matter.

Originally, two days ago, Dragon Spike had ruthlessly slapped the master of undercurrent, causing the undercurrent assassin organization to be unable to do anything to dragon spike.

But today, the master of undercurrent had once again forcefully counterattacked, slapping dragon spike in the face.

Long Ci had no choice but to announce the suspension of the mission.

The exchange of attacks made everyone who was watching the show feel very satisfied.

If it could be said that two days ago, everyone thought that undercurrent was inferior to long CI, then today, the situation had once again developed, and long CI was completely at a disadvantage.

Even the mission had been suspended. One could imagine how big a blow this was to long CI.

...

“This dragon Spike knows how to advance and retreat. It’s a tough opponent!”

In the city Lord’s mansion, City Lord Liu looked at the message sent from the Forum. He frowned slightly and looked at the master of undercurrent.

Today, they had prepared two methods to deal with the dragon spike. One was to target the hidden lines of the dragon Spike and use the city protection array to monitor and search for the hidden lines of the dragon spike.

The second was to issue a mission. When the time came, the master of undercurrent would directly hide around the assassinated person and wait for the arrival of the dragon Spike Assassin. They would then directly wait for the arrival of the dragon Spike Assassin.

Now that the dragon Spike had canceled the mission, they could no longer carry out the second mission!

“Then we’ll accompany them slowly. The power of the indestructible dragon spike. I, the Master of Undercurrent, am a man in vain. Haha!”

The Master of undercurrent sat there, drank a mouthful of wine, and laughed loudly.

He seemed to be talking about a very ordinary matter.

“Madman!”

City Lord Liu glanced at him and thought to himself. However, a smile appeared on his face.

“If we work together, it’ll be easy for us to destroy the dragon Spike!”

He gently raised the wine cup beside him and gestured to the Master of Undercurrent.

...

“Have you found out the information about those two?”

In Bright Moon City, in an extremely luxurious manor, guards were patrolling around the manor.

In the hall of the manor, the third prince sat in the middle and asked the middle-aged man beside him with a solemn face.

Beside him, two half-step void interpretation experts were sitting around him, guarding his safety.

“Your Highness, the third prince, we’re still investigating. We’re still investigating. I’ve already asked the city guards to investigate, but those two people seem to be afraid of your revenge after they found out your identity, so they’ve hidden themselves!”

“But you don’t have to worry, third prince. We’ll find you very soon. Very soon!”

The middle-aged man hurriedly said!
