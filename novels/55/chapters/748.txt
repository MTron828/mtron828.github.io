“I can easily meet an immortal god. He should be an immortal god from the true Martial Immortal House!”

Wang Xian walked through the main road of the special wooden house and pondered in his heart.

The true martial immortal house was very powerful. It was rumored that there were four to five immortal God powerhouses and two intermediate immortals.

However, his purpose of coming here was not the true martial immortal house. He did not have the intention to chat with other immortal gods. The problem with Shu Qing had to be solved as soon as possible!

Wang Xian’s footsteps were very fast, giving off an illusory feeling. After more than an hour, he arrived at the entrance of the natural born celestial sect.

“Natural born celestial sect!”

Two gigantic trees stood tall. Each tree was at least ten meters in diameter and a hundred meters in height. Their lush leaves blocked off a huge area.

The two trees intersected and formed a door-shaped entrance. Inside, rows of unknown trees blocked off a subordinate’s path. It looked very spectacular.

“The Hundred Flowers Garden is blooming today. We just need to get a drop of the hundred flowers liquid today!”

“The Hundred Flowers Garden, one of the three gardens of the natural born celestial sect, is Blooming. The hundred flowers liquid can calm one’s mind and mind. It is extremely beneficial for cultivation. I hope I have something that the natural born celestial sect needs to exchange for it!”

“Haha, even if I Can’t get it, I would be satisfied just to take a look at Fairy Fang’s beauty!”

At this moment, Wang Xian suddenly heard a group of people conversing behind him.

“Focus your mind and calm your heart. Hundred Flower Liquid?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows. A contemplative look appeared on his face as he looked behind him.

A group of more than 30 people, including young and middle-aged men, walked towards them.

They were all wearing the same uniform. The words “Zhenwu”were written on their chests.

When the crowd saw Wang Xian standing at the entrance with a coffin-like coffin on his back, they glanced at him curiously. Then, they ignored him and walked straight in.

When Wang Xian saw them walking in, he followed behind them.

“50 spirit stones for each person entering the Hundred Flowers Garden!”

At the end of the path blocked by trees, two young men stood there and spoke to the crowd.

It was obvious that this group of people from the true martial university knew the rules as well. They immediately handed over fifty spirit stones.

Wang Xian did not hesitate and took out fifty spirit stones directly.

Currently, he did not have many spirit stones in his hands. However, he still had a few hundred thousand spirit stones.

As he was unfamiliar with the natural born immortal sect, this hundred-flower garden was an opportunity for him.

With his current strength, although he could fly directly into the natural born immortal sect to talk to the immortals, he did not know the rules here.

He was here to ask for medicine. It would be troublesome if the natural born immortal sect disliked him.

After all, the natural born immortal sect was not weak.

The entire natural born immortal sect was a sea of plants. Even some buildings in the distance were built on huge trees.

It looked like the elves in novels!

He followed the students of the true martial immortal academy to the left. Soon, a colorful sea of flowers appeared in his line of sight.

“It’s too beautiful. Every time I come here, I don’t want to leave!”

A girl’s voice came from the front.

There were all kinds of flowers in front of them. Colorful butterflies were dancing on them.

The entire sea of flowers didn’t look like the mortal world or the immortal world!

When they came to the center of the Sea of flowers, there was an empty space. There were many seats placed on it, surrounding the seats in an arc.

There were more than a hundred seats, and there were already many people sitting there. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Wang Xian swept his gaze across and realized that everyone was waiting for something.

He found a remote seat and sat down.

“Hey Brother, what are you carrying on your back?”

Wang Xian was sitting in a seat when a young man suddenly asked curiously.

Wang Xian turned his head and looked at the thin and weak young man sitting beside him. He said faintly, “The one I love!”

“Eh... you are a Weirdo!”

The skinny young man shook his head speechlessly when he heard his words.

Wang Xian ignored him and looked at the cup of tea on the table.

“Brother, you don’t look familiar. You are not a student of the true martial immortal college and don’t seem to be from the ice god Celestial sect. Where did you come from?”

The skinny young man looked at Wang Xian’s attire curiously and asked enthusiastically.

“It’s from Jiang City. What kind of tea is this?”

Wang Xian picked up the Teacup and took a sip. Instantly, he felt refreshed. It was as though he had taken a sip of herbal tea in summer and it had entered his heart!

“Jiang City? This is the hundred flowers tea. It collects the fragrance of the Hundred Flowers and covers it. When the tea is boiled, take a sip to calm your mind!”

The skinny young man explained to Wang Xian and looked at him curiously. “Why? You Don’t Know?”

Wang Xian shook his head. “Is the effect of the hundred flowers liquid much stronger than this tea?”

“Of course. This is just the fragrance of the hundred flowers while the hundred flowers liquid is the liquid of the hundred flowers. The two are naturally not on the same level. The hundred flowers liquid is equivalent to a top-grade grade-6 elixir. It is extremely precious. I wonder if I can exchange it for a drop this time!”

The skinny young man’s eyes lit up as he spoke.

“Bingchuan Yun is here. Sigh, there are so many big shots here today. My hope is a little slim!”

Suddenly, the skinny young man saw the group of people who walked in and said helplessly.

Wang Xian swept his gaze across the group. It was a young man who was wearing white clothes. He was handsome and there was a hint of confidence between his brows.

The group of young men sat not far from them!

“There are many people here!”

“Senior sister Baihua, what do you want to exchange for this time?”

“Hehe, it’s the harvest season again!”

At this moment, in the Hundred Flowers Garden, a few girls were walking over with smiles on their faces.

There were more than ten girls dressed in clothes with a hundred flowers pattern. In the middle of them was an exceptionally stunning girl. On her shoulders, there were two seven-colored butterflies the size of a palm!

The butterflies were not decorations, but living creatures.

Beside this girl, a girl with a slightly inferior appearance was on her left. She had a proud expression on her face.

The two of them were clearly one step ahead of the girls around them, revealing their identities.

“Look, flower fairy. This is your first time seeing her, right? The beauty ranked third in the world of martial arts is ranked third among the twenty immortal sects. Even if you can’t get the hundred flower liquid this time, it’s worth it to look at Flower Fairy!”

The skinny boy next to him smacked his lips and muttered to himself.

“Chuan Yun!”

A group of more than ten girls came to a platform in the center. When the girl next to flower fairy saw the handsome young man, surprise appeared in her arrogant eyes, and she immediately walked over.

The young man smiled at the girls, and a hint of admiration flashed in his eyes as he looked at flower fairy.

“Thank you all for coming today. This year, there are a total of ten drops of hundred flower liquid in the hundred flower garden. Just like in previous years, you can barter with your items. If you are satisfied, you can directly exchange them!”

Flower fairy stood in the middle and took out ten jade bottles. The jade bottles were very small, and one could see a drop of colorful liquid inside.
