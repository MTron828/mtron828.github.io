Chapter 1259: 1260 descent technique

Translator: 5496903

The changes in the training grounds attracted the attention of the entire human-demon graveyard.

The importance of the training grounds, as well as the number of participants, was many times greater than the heaven’s pride stage.

For some youths below the age of 50, the best training grounds and the places where they killed fierce beasts were the training grounds.

However, the training grounds were being ravaged by demonic beasts. It could be said to be a great humiliation to the humans.

“F * ck, the demon beasts inside are wantonly killing us humans. Those who haven’t come out yet are probably killed by the Demon Beasts!”

“It’s a demon beast at the insightful void level. It’s the King of Heaven Beast, the strongest expert among the younger generation of the Demon Beast clan. If we want to deal with it, the only way is for US human geniuses to appear!”

“The strength of our batch of geniuses is extremely terrifying. If the nameless sword demon leads a group of geniuses, they will definitely be able to contend against the demon beasts inside!”

“Damn the Heaven’s favorites King Beast. It actually announced that it would block the entrance of our trial ground. This is simply a blatant humiliation to us!”

“The Mercenary Association has already issued a mission, a five-star Diamond Mission. Kill the Heaven’s favorites King Beast and you will receive 100,000 spirit liquid!”

At the entrance of the trial ground, the number of people gradually increased from the initial 10,000 to 70,000 to 80,000.

All of them were young men and mercenary groups.

The demon beasts wreaking havoc in the trial ground was a huge humiliation to the humans.

The mercenary group would issue a mission to kill the King Beast of Heaven’s pride. As long as they killed it, they would receive 100,000 spirit liquid.

The reward of 100,000 spirit liquid was definitely a huge fortune. Even the powerful factions were extremely tempted.

However, it was definitely not that easy to kill a demonic beast at least at the first level of the Seethrough realm in the training ground.

Right now, the most popular claim was that the nameless sword demon had made his move and entered the training ground to kill it.

However, after more than ten hours, the nameless sword demon did not appear. The rest of the people did not dare to enter the training ground in fear.

“Killing the Demonic Beast King Beast can get me 100,000 spiritual liquid. It’s a pity that I can’t do it with my strength.”

Long Xiaotian stood in Wang Xian’s shadow and shook his head slightly. “My Luck is really bad. Brother Wang Xian, I’m going back now. I might have to trouble you again in the near future!”

“It’s no trouble. You guys can go back first. I still have some matters to attend to!”

Wang Xian shook his head and said to him.

“Alright, take care of your safety!”

Long Xiaotian nodded his head. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Right now, his priority was to compete for the position of crown prince. He didn’t want to get involved in anything else.

Even if it was the heaven’s pride stage or the trial grounds, he wouldn’t waste any time.

Long Xiaotian led his men and left. Wang Xian’s eyes were sparkling as he stared at the entrance of the trial grounds.

“100,000 spiritual liquid and 70,000,000 Dragon Crystals!”

Wang Xian revealed a faint smile as he slowly walked towards the entrance of the trial grounds.

“Make way, make way!”

At this moment, a voice was suddenly heard, causing everyone in the training ground to be slightly stunned.

“It’s the people from the bloody flow empire!”

“The people from the bloody flow empire are here. Could it be that they are going to make a move?”

“Haha, the people from the bloody flow empire are making a move. I knew it. There will definitely be a big faction making a move!”

“Get rid of that demon king beast. Get Rid of that D * MN Guy. How dare he block the entrance of our training ground!”

When everyone turned around, they saw a group of people dressed in blood-red clothes with a huge imperial character written on their chests.

Everyone around them looked excited as they cheered loudly.

The blood flow empire had made their move!

The strongest faction in the blood flow region!

“Everyone, make way for an empty space!”

A middle-aged man swept his gaze across everyone around him and his voice resounded in their ears.

Everyone who was at the entrance of the training ground hurriedly retreated.

Wang Xian looked over and revealed an astonished expression.

More than a dozen people from the blood flow empire came over. The leader was a middle-aged man. Beside him were two princes, Tang Feng and Tang Yuan, who were on the prodigy roll.

Behind them, there were all young men who were at transcendent level nine. There were a total of around fifteen of them.

From this, one could see the foundation of the bloodshed empire.

“That seems to be Tang Lingwen, a powerhouse at the peak of the first level of the Seethrough realm. Why is he here too?”

A curious voice of a young man came from the side. Wang Xian looked at the middle-aged man in the middle.

The middle-aged man was obviously over fifty years old, or even over a hundred years old. He was not allowed to enter the training ground.

The group arrived at the entrance of the training grounds. Under the curious gazes of the surrounding people, everyone held a formation compass in their hands.

“It’s a formation. Tang Feng and the others from the blood flow empire want to use a formation to deal with that Demon King Beast!”

“Other than powerful weapons, there’s only a formation. And look, the energy contained within that formation is a killing formation of the second rank of the insightful void realm. It can definitely kill a demon beast of the first rank of the insightful void realm!”

“Haha, That’s Great! How dare you block the entrance of our human training grounds, wait for your death!”

The surrounding tens of thousands of people saw the array formation in the hands of the youths from the blood flow empire, and their faces revealed an excited expression.

“En? What is that great profound void tier expert going to do?”

Right at this moment, everyone’s gazes turned towards the profound void tier expert standing at the very front, and their faces revealed an astonished expression.

They saw that in front of that profound void martial expert, there were bottles of spiritual liquid. The spiritual liquid contained at least tens of thousands of spiritual liquid.

Besides that spiritual liquid, there were also drops of essence blood. The rich essence blood was exuding vigorous vitality.

The value of that essence blood was not the slightest bit inferior to that of the spiritual liquid.

Everyone looked over with curious faces.

“The demon race’s demon beasts wreaked havoc and killed many of our human race’s lives. This time, our blood flow empire will use the descending technique to forcefully break the age restriction of the training ground and kill the Demon Race’s King Beast. Moreover, we will make them pay back tenfold!”

As the middle-aged insightful emptiness realm expert spoke, the spiritual liquid and blood essence in front of him emitted a dazzling luster.

With a move of his palm, a special white ball appeared in his hand. The spiritual liquid and blood essence entered the white ball.

Following that, the white ball slowly entered his body.

“Success!”

When Tang Feng and Tang Yuan saw this scene, a smile appeared on his face. “Unfortunately, the higher the level of the descending technique, the greater the restriction. It can only allow an insightful emptiness realm first level expert to descend. Otherwise...”

“Hehe, it’s enough for me to go over. I’ll take advantage of this opportunity to give the Demon Beast clan a heavy blow!”

“HMPH, you actually dare to block the entrance of our training grounds. You’re simply courting death. I’ll kill a Puny Demon Beast King within ten moves!”

The middle-aged profound void martial artist absorbed the white ball. His eyes revealed a cold expression as he spoke in a deep voice.

“Hiss!”

When the surrounding people heard the middle-aged insightful emptiness realm expert’s words, all of them had shocked expressions on their faces.

“The descending technique? It can actually allow people over the age of fifty to enter the training grounds. This is too terrifying!”

“Using at least ten thousand drops of spirit liquid and ten thousand drops of blood essence, senior Tang Lingwen has descended. Haha, it can absolutely cause the entire demon beast clan to tremble!”

“What Bullsh * t Demon King Beast? Die, Haha!”
