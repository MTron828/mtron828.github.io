3570 2,569 had a complete victory!

“PFFT!”

Wang Xian flew at high speed and continued his hunt!

The Dragon Claw once again took the life of a level three Master of the Universe!

No one of the same level could withstand his attack!

“Oh no, the two clan elders are dead. The clan elders are dead!”

“The opponent’s strength is so strong and terrifying!”

The urgent alarm resounded throughout the Sky Plant Demon Beast Race, countless experts flew over, preparing to destroy the invading enemy!

However, they hadn’t rushed over yet, their clan elders!

Their Sky Plant Demon Beast Universe ruler Level 3 experts were instantly killed!

And it was two of them!

Facing such a terrifying enemy, how could they resist?

The group of powerful disciples who were supported by the sky plant demonic beasts looked at the corpse of their clan elder. Their eyes were about to pop out of their sockets!

At the same time, they were shocked!

They were terrified!

It was the Dragon Palace that invaded them. How could their strength be so terrifying?

“Destroy the entire Sky Plant Demonic Beast clan. If they want to kill us, we will make them disappear from the universe!”

Wang Xian instantly killed the two level three masters of the universe who came to support him. Then, he shouted at his surroundings!

“It’s the Dragon King!”

The eight-limbed demonic fiend and the rest who had been standing around roared!

“Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!”

At the same time, at the huge tree where Wang Xian and the rest had rushed over, many masters of the Dragon Palace appeared one after another!

There were a total of 500 masters of the Dragon Palace!

These 500 powerhouses were all at least at the level of a universe overlord! ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Currently, there were more than 700 powerhouses from the Dragon Palace who were at the level of a universe overlord!

This time, there were 500 of them!

“Kill, exterminate the Sky Plant Demon Beast Clan!”

After they were brought over by an lie, a group of purebred divine dragons and a group of peak dragon species instantly attacked all the powerful disciples of the Sky Plant Demon Beast!

One by one, the Dragon Wizards began to set up arrays in the surroundings to prevent them from escaping!

Or perhaps they used a special method to lock onto their auras so that they could pursue and kill them after they escaped!

The pure-bred divine dragons roared and transformed into their divine dragon bodies, charging towards the army of Sky Plant Demon Beasts!

The strange-looking thorned dragon species, the arrow dragon species with terrifying killing ability!

There were also the unpredictable charming dragon species as well as the berserk dragon species, and so on!

One by one, the peak dragon species began to wreak havoc in the Sky Plant Demonic Beast clan!

The five elements grinding did not require Wang Xian’s control. Instead, they swiftly hunted down the level 2 masters who were masters of the universe!

A long river of destruction of the five elements could clear out a space at a terrifying speed!

In this space, all the Sky Plant Demon Beast Great Beings died instantly!

Even universe masters with level-two combat power couldn’t resist it!

The power of the five elements grinding was enough to resist three universe masters with level-three combat power!

“Their Dragon Palace is so powerful, run!”

“Where are the clan leader and the others? Where are our ancestor and the others?”

“Dragon Palace is so powerful, we are no match for them. Run!”

A group of universe master level warriors fled into the distance, their faces filled with fear!

Two elders of the Zhen clan were instantly killed, and a terrifying millstone was slaughtering them!

And now, another 500 universe master level warriors had appeared!

Without the help of the clan leader and the others, without the help of the pinnacle warriors of the clan, they were completely slaughtered!

They wouldn’t even have the strength to resist!

“Don’t let them escape. Kill!”

The experts of the Dragon Palace unleashed their terrifying strength. The nine divine wind dragons unleashed their maximum speed and charged straight towards the Sky Plant Demonic Beast Army!

Wang Xian scanned his surroundings and a cold look appeared in his eyes. His gaze once again landed on the battlefield beside the waterfall!

There were ten masters of the universe with level three combat strength who were desperately resisting!

When they were going all out, it would be difficult for the experts of the Dragon Palace to destroy them!

However, the level-three Master of the universe who was attacked by the king of water touch was severely injured and was about to be killed!

Wang Xian flapped his divine wings and joined the battle once again!

“That Dragon King is here again!”

When they saw Wang Xian charging over again, their faces were filled with despair!

Two experts who came to support him were instantly killed by him!

What else could they use to defend themselves!

In their eyes, the Dragon King’s strength was almost as terrifying as a real ruler of the universe!

“I’ll Kill You First!”

Wang Xian flew to the front of the nearest expert who was at the peak of the Sky Plant Demonic Beast Race and charged over at a terrifying speed!

He ignored the overwhelming attacks and rushed over directly!

When the expert at the peak of the Sky-plant demonic beast race saw Wang Xian rushing towards him, he was instantly filled with despair!

“Dragon King of the Dragon Palace, the Lords of our Angel race will not let you off. We will not let you off!”

He roared with a face full of unwillingness!

“PFFT!”

His roar ended and so did his life!

“Angel clan! HMPH!”

Wang Xian snorted coldly. If one day, he had the ability to do so, he would definitely destroy the Angel clan!

“Die! You want to destroy our Dragon Palace? This is the price you have to pay!”

Wang Xian charged toward the other peak experts of the Sky Plant Demonic Beast clan!

There were no changes in the following battle.

Wang Xian charged over and killed one of them instantly!

The last ten peak experts of the Sky Plant Demonic Beast clan were easily killed.

After the group of Dragon Palace experts was freed, they immediately flew towards their surroundings.

They began to hunt down the experts and disciples of the Sky Plant Demonic Beast clan wantonly!

Under the attacks of the 500 experts of the Dragon Palace, the Sky Plant Demonic Beast clan, which had been defeated under the attack of the Five Elements Millstone, became even more tragic!

They fled frantically in all directions!

After killing the last master of the universe with a level three combat strength, Wang Xian hovered in the air above the sky plant demonic beasts and scanned his surroundings!

“Hehe!”

A smile appeared on his face!

This battle was very perfect. He had killed 17 master of the universe with a level three combat strength.

Of course, one of them escaped. However, his corpse and all his energy were left behind!

He only managed to escape through a secret technique. He should have escaped back to his divine kingdom!

Next, the Heaven Array could definitely kill him!

As for the other 16 masters of the universe with level three combat strength, they did not really die!

When he sensed a trace of energy from the leader of the Sky Plant Demonic Beast appearing at the location of the waterfall, Wang Xian had a guess in his heart!

He looked at the location of the waterfall, and his eyes were sparkling!

Without saying anything unexpected, the powerhouses of the sky plant demonic beasts had all been resurrected there!

Of course, their resurrection must have been done with the help of the grotto-heaven blessed land.

There were many types of grotto-heaven blessed land with various powerful abilities.

Wang Xian had seen the grotto-heaven blessed land that could be resurrected before. Furthermore, it was occupied by the Dragon Palace.
