Chapter 408: The Little Prince of Flow City (2)

“Old Wang, forget it. Let’s not be calculative with them!”

Wang Dahai looked at his cousin and the group of young men and felt exceptionally embarrassed. He pulled Wang Xian on the arm softly and wanted to leave.

Wang Xian raised an eyebrow but didn’t say a word.

Huh?

At this instant, Young Master Feng, Young Master Luan and Young Master Nan, who were sitting to the side, heard the commotion from the direction where Wang Xian was at. They turned around with radiant smiles, waiting to watch the show.

Boom!

Suddenly, their faces stiffened when they looked across Wang Xian’s group and stood up instantly.

“Little young master!”

The three of them exchanged glances before taking a second look to verify. They were shocked and surprised.

“Can you hear us? Bring this little brat along and get out of here!”

At this moment, a young man’s voice reverberated. This made the three of them shiver as their faces sank.

“Little brat?”

The three of them looked at the group of young men who were looking down at Wang Xian, Wang Dahai and Ji Xiang. When they heard the group of young men mocking them, their eyelids twitched violently.

The three of them forced a faint smile and walked forward immediately.

“Who’s pushing...”

A young man frowned and chided loudly after feeling a huge force pushing him aside. However, when he saw that it was Young Master Feng and his friends, he immediately swallowed back his words.

“Young Master Feng, Young Master Luan, Young Master Nan!” the group of young men instantly greeted deferentially.

However, the three of them didn’t pay any attention to the group. The trio forced a smile and walked directly towards Ji Xiang.

It was as though they had noticed it wasn’t polite for them to look down. Therefore, the three of them squatted.

The group of young men behind him looked on in disbelief.

They had to be courteous and respectful before Young Master Feng, Young Master Luan and Young Master Nan. Yet, the three of them were currently squatting deferentially before the little boy in the school uniform and greeting him as “Little Young Master!”

Ji Xiang was initially taken aback. However, he showed a smile soon after and said, “Big brother Feng, big brother Luan, big brother Nan!”

“Hehe! Greetings, little young master! Greetings, little young master!”

The three of them responded immediately with smiles. From their expressions, one could easily tell that they were both respectful and fearful.

Others might not know but they knew clearly who this little boy in the school uniform was.

He’s the son of Maniac Ji! The only son!

In the entire Flow City, Maniac Ji was the only Inborn expert and the de facto ruler. All the families like theirs could only look up in fear.

The little boy before them was his only son. In other words, one could also consider him to be the little prince of Flow City.

It was just a short time ago that this little young master had appeared before the eyes of the crowd.

Young little master was sent to the third year of high school directly. Also, it was said that several classmates bullied him because of the seating arrangement.

In the end, Maniac Ji headed to the school the next day after learning about his son being bullied and demanded to meet the parents of these kids.

The parents of these kids were arrogant, accusing Maniac Ji of interfering and nagging about matters that should be settled between their kids. They even said that his son deserved to be bullied if his son couldn’t do anything about it himself.

The outcome was easily predictable.

The parents of those kids were killed.

There weren’t many who knew about this matter. However, as three second-class forces in Flow City, they were well informed about this incident.

In the past, Maniac Ji was daring enough to kill a miracle doctor for his son. For now, there was no way he was going to let the people who bullied his son off.

Yet, these ignorant and brazen parents were chiding and reprimanding his little prince.

“Little young master, is there anyone who is bullying you? If there is, tell us and leave them to us!” said the three young men with radiant smiles.

Ji Xiang smiled at them and didn’t say a word.

The three young masters were puzzled to see Wang Xian being so close to this little young master. From it, they deduced that he likely had deep connections with Maniac Ji.

“Greetings, big brother!”

The three young men disregarded Wang Xian’s age as they greeted him sincerely.

“Hmm! Get the few of them away!” Wang Xian nodded his head emotionlessly and responded to the three young men.

“Yes, yes!”

Seeing how composed and calm Wang Xian was, Young Master Feng, Young Master Luan and Young Master Nan were even more certain that Wang Xian couldn’t be a simple person. They immediately nodded their heads and stood up.

At this very moment, Wang Dahai’s cousin and the group of young men completely froze up.

Their eyes were filled with disbelief and horror.

The thee most elite young masters of Flow City were actually squatting down and acting deferentially towards a young boy who they had called a brat.

This... This...

This can’t be!

This can’t be!

Seeing the three young masters standing up, all of them were breaking out in a cold sweat.

Wang Dahai’s cousin stood by the side and watched blankly.

“This is a banquet by Mogul Sun and we won’t do anything ourselves here. Get out of our sight and wait for your deaths!”

The smiles on the three young masters disappeared as they looked coldly across the group of young men.

“Young Master Feng, Young Master Luan, Young Master Nan... We... We...”

When the group of young men heard the three young masters, cold sweat broke out from all parts of their bodies. Their faces turned pale as they swallowed their saliva, and their eyes were filled with horror.

“Don’t let us repeat ourselves for the second time!” said the three young masters plainly. Their gazes were cold and made the group of young men feel as though they had fallen into an ice cellar.

The group of young men were dumbfounded. Their bodies were shivering and they appeared to be thinking of begging for mercy.

“Scram! Otherwise, I’ll erase all your families from Flow City!”

Seeing that they weren’t leaving, the three young masters issued their last warning.

“We will get lost right away! We will get lost right away!”

The group of young men were desolated as they walked away like distraught zombies.

Wang Xian looked at their back views with contempt before smiling and patting the shoulders of Ji Xiang. He was also checking his strength at the same time.

Level 2 Martial Artist. Pretty good!

“Ji Xiang, these are some gifts from big brother!”

As Wang Xian finished his words, he took out several pills. Three Level 2 and Level 3 elixir pills each. All of these pills were greatly beneficial for cultivation.

“Your father will know when to let you consume them!” Wang Xian explained and handed the pills into Ji Xiang’s hands after seeing his puzzled face.

These elixir pills were made from the spiritual medicine Qing Bi Sect had given him. He had made thirteen Level 2 and Level 3 elixir pills each and had intended to exchange them for treasures, if there were any.

“These are... Elixir pills! Level 2 and Level 3 elixir pills!”

Just as the three young masters turned around, they saw the gifts Wang Xian had for Ji Xiang. Their pupils couldn’t help but constrict as they looked on with disbelief.

Elixir pills! These were elixir pills!

Level 2 and Level 3 elixir pills were equivalent to Level 3 and Level 4 spiritual medicine.

If one were to use cash to purchase a Level 4 spiritual medicine, he would require $700-$800 million.

Level 3 elixir pills were even more valuable and couldn’t be measured in monetary terms.

“Giving out gifts that are worth hundreds of millions casually... This... This...”

The three young masters could feel the edges of their mouths twitching as they witnessed this astonishing incident.

A person like this would never be simple. In fact, his relationship with Maniac Ji might not be that between a senior and a junior.

“Big brother, my father told me to not accept gifts from others casually!” Ji Xiang looked hesitant as he replied to Wang Xian.

“It will be fine. Just tell them it was from me. Your father won’t say a thing!”

Wang Xian waved his hand.

It was just a few elixir pills. Although they were valuable, Level 2 and Level 3 elixir pills weren’t really precious items to him at this juncture.

Giving them as gifts to the son of Maniac Ji could also be a recognition of Maniac Ji as a friend.
