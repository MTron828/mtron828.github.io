Chapter 483: Playing Dirty?

“Xiao Wan gets along with him very well. Even though they met only a few times, they were already bickering with each other. On their first encounter, Xiao Wan even asked him to call her Mother.”

“Perhaps it’s because both of them were playing like nobody’s business, Xiao Wan was more friendly to him!” said Tang Lingling to the few people beside her with a smile as she watched Mu Xiaowan sitting on the surfboard.

“Hmph!”

The young man with a crew cut snorted as he cast a cold gaze over with a darkened expression.

The rest of the youth chuckled with a curl of their lips. “Let’s go over with them. It’ll be fun when the waves are here.”

The other two youths chuckled as they looked far out with their lips drawn.

“Let’s go and have some fun today!”

The young man with a crew cut revealed a sneer as he stepped on his surfboard gently and glided ahead.

“Wow, let’s go over there! Over there!” said Mu Xiaowan, pointing ahead. She sat on the deck with excitement as she placed her arms in the water.

“Sure, hold on to my thigh!”

Wang Xian laughed and made a dash.

Surfing is an extreme sport that is considered to be dangerous.

But it is alright if one does not go to the areas with deep waters and tumbling waves.

As they tilted their board slightly, Wang Xian and Mu Xiaowan charged straight ahead.

The waves over there could reach more than four meters high, sometimes even taller than five or six meters.

Only the members of the Surf Club would dare to come to this location at the Dubai Beach. Usual surfers would not dare to come to a place with such tall waves!

Surfing is, indeed, an exciting sport. With a simple Art of Water Manoeuvre, Wang Xian could control the stability of the surfboard.

With the help of the waves, they charged forward directly.

“Go! Let’s go over there!”

Seeing the two huge waves ahead, he made a slight movement and dived under the huge waves.

He had to move faster than the waves. If the waves were faster than them, they would be slapped by the waves.

Ah!

Upon seeing the huge waves above her head, Mu Xiaowan exclaimed with excitement. She used her hands to flap at the water in an attempt to speed up the surfboard.

Wang Xian looked down at her and found her funny. If there was a chance next time, he wanted to bring Xiao Yu and the rest here for some fun.

Boom!

“Yeah, yeah!”

The huge wave splashed down while they passed through it, and the lass was screaming in thrills.

Wang Xian chuckled.

At this moment, however, he sensed a ball of seawater aiming at his face.

He was taken aback a little as he lowered his body slightly. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Hur? Well done, you lad. You are a good surfer!”

A doubtful voice was heard as Wang Xian whirled around to see Tang Lingling, her boyfriend, and the rest of them heading toward them.

The one who spoke was the young man with a crew cut. He was staring at Wang Xian with astonishment.

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows.

“Of course. He may be ugly, but his surfing skills are still okay!”

Before Wang Xian could say anything, Mu Xiaowan craned up her head on the surfboard as she spoke to the young man with a crew cut.

As she spoke, she sized up the four young men.

The four young men, including Tang Lingling’s boyfriend and that young star, were obviously worse than Wang Xian in terms of appearance and disposition.

When she said Wang Xian was ugly, her real intended meaning was that they were uglier.

“Heh heh.”

Without any mercy, Wang Xian placed his palm on top of her head and made an abrupt leap with the surfboard.

“Ouch, do you want to die!?”

Mu Xiaowan was startled as she hugged Wang Xian’s thigh out of panic. Subsequently, she was so fuming that she bit his leg.

“Is your Chinese Zodiac sign a dog?”

Wang Xian quickly pressed her head and glared at her.

“If you dare to scare me, my Zodiac would not be a dog, but a tiger!”

Mu Xiaowan bared her teeth as she stared daggers at him.

“Fine, don’t bite me. I will not scare you if you say something nice!” said Wang Xian.

The face of the young man with a crew cut grew darker when he saw this.

“There’s another wave ahead. Let’s go over!”

Seeing another huge wave rushing in, the young man with a crew cut curled the corner of his lips. With flickering radiance in his eyes, he suggested this to Wang Xian.

“Sure!”

Wang Xian lifted his chin at the young man.

“Then let’s go!”

The young man with a crew cut spun his head around and looked at the other two young men.

The duo nodded to him with a smile.

“Charge!”

Mu Xiaowan let out an exciting scream.

Tang Lingling’s boyfriend exhibited a smile as he took Tang Lingling forward, putting some distance between them.

Wang Xian controlled his direction. Following the waves, he watched the huge incoming wave.

Behind him, the young man with a crew cut revealed a creepy smile. He steered to the side of Wang Xian easily.

“You must protect Xiao Wan. Otherwise, I’ll take you over!” he said to Wang Xian.

Wang Xian smiled and said nothing. Seeing the incoming five-meter wave was just right ahead, he steered and headed for it.

“Let’s go!” the other two young men said in a relaxed tone from behind.

“Charge!”

Mu Xiaowan cheered as she looked at the waves on top of their heads.

Whoo!

After the young man with a crew cut exchanged gazes with the other young men behind Wang Xian, he swung his arm, bringing about a gust of strong wind, aiming at Wang Xian’s surfboard.

The sudden wind was propelling Wang Xian towards the wave.

Sensing the energy, Wang Xian arched the corner of his lips as he suddenly bent down and shouted to Mu Xiaowan, “We’re accelerating!”

Boom!

Just then, the wave, which was estimated to fall in another two seconds, suddenly slammed downward.

With a thought, Wang Xian’s surfboard accelerated and sped out as if he was stepping on the gas pedal in the car.

“Oh no!”

“Damm!”

Before the three young men behind could spot Wang Xian, they felt the wave slamming down at them.

They had a slight change in their expressions. With exploding momentum, they tried to flee.

Given their strength, the wave would not knock them down.

Boom!

However, when the waves came down on them, it was as though a great force had hit them.

The three of them were aghast as they were being thrown off into the sea just when they were about to flee.

Seawater gushed into their mouths.

Wang Xian drew his lips slightly as he continued to rush ahead.

When that wave was over, Wang Xian halted and acted surprised as he looked behind.

“Hur? Where are they?”

“Hur? Where did that trio go?”

Mu Xiaowan was also stunned as she checked behind.

Tang Lingling and her boyfriend also spun around in shock.

“There they are. They are climbing up the boards. Those three fellows were thrown off by the waves. Haha!”

As soon as Mu Xiaowan caught three figures climbing onto their surfboards, she exclaimed loudly with an amused look.

“Let’s check them out!”

Wang Xian adjusted his direction and came to them while riding on the waves.

“What? Don’t follow us if your surfing skills suck. It would be embarrassing if you lost your life over here!”

“Yes, yes. Such trash!”

Upon hearing the two scornful voices, the trio who had just climbed onto their boards were totally embarrassed.

They spat out mouthfuls of blood with purplish faces.
