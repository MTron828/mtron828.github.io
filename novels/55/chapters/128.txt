“Two days. I can cure him in two days!”

“Unbelievable. Absolutely unbelievable! The Black Rain Palm is the famous poisonous palm art. Yet, Miracle Doctor Fang could treat this in two days!”

“Is this the Sacred Followers Guild? They are really skillful!”

“Miracle Doctor Fang, I have an internal illness. Can you take a look later on?”

What Fang Huazi said evoked emotions within those Martial Artists who were suffering from severe illnesses.

If injuries sustained from Black Rain Palm can be healed within two days, that means their injuries could be treated easily.

As for Wang Xian, they did not think Wang Xian was as capable as Miracle Doctor Fang.

They were almost certain he would win the competition.

“Wang Xian, are you... are you confident?!” asked Old Qin and Old Xue with worry and mixed expressions.

Wang Xian peered over his shoulder and gave them an assuring look. He beamed at the haughty Fang Huazi and said, “I love your arms though!”

After speaking, he turned back to the middle-aged man who suffered injuries from the Black Rain Palm, “Sir, please follow me. Five minutes. Five minutes at most.”

Wang Xian threw a smiley glance at the middle-aged man before he walked up the stairs.

The middle-aged man was stunned as he revealed a shocked expression when he looked at Wang Xian.

“Five minutes!”

When Old Xue heard Wang Xian, his eyes were glowing, “Gao Cheng, follow him!”

“Yes, Old Xue! “The middle-aged man’s expression changed before he followed behind Wang Xian.

“What’s going on? Can he really treat Gao Cheng in five minutes?”

“No way, Black Rain Palm is a vicious palm art. To survive under the attack of this palm art is considered lucky.”

“What can he do in five minutes?”

Everyone was in disbelief.

Everyone knew how formidable the Black Rain Palm was. Hence, no one believed that injuries could heal in five minutes.

“He’s playing tricks!” Fang Huazi stared coldly at Wang Xian.

He would never believe Wang Xian when he said he could treat the Black Rain Palm in five minutes.

Even if it were Fang Huazi, he would need to consume some precious herbs before the injuries could heal.

“If he dares to play any tricks, we can just simply break his arms!” Yan Zhongyuan said impassively, disregarding everyone in the room.

Fang Huazi smiled and nodded as he waited quietly.

Thump!

Five minutes passed very fast.

Everyone looked over as soon as they heard the footsteps coming down the stairs.

Wang Xian put on a smiling face as he walked down. Gao Cheng was following behind him with thrill and disbelief on his face.

Incredible. It was incredible.

Fang Huazi knit his eyebrow slightly as he stared at Gao Cheng.

“What’s going on?”a hospital director whispered and asked puzzledly.

“Fang Huazi of the Sacred Followers Guild, come over. Let me break your arms!”

Wang Xian widened his lips with a taunting look.

“Hur?”

Everyone was caught by surprise as they looked suspiciously at Wang Xian and Gao Cheng.

Seeing that everyone’s attention was gathered on him, Gao Cheng could not hide his excitement and exclaimed loudly, “I’ve recovered. I’m fully recovered!”

“This is impossible!”

Fang Huazi glared at Gao Cheng and gritted his teeth. “This is totally impossible. If both of you dare to play any trick on me, don’t blame me for being ruthless.”

“It’s somewhat impossible to recover in five minutes.”

“Did they collude? Even so, they can’t deceive the Sacred Followers Guild and Yan Zhongyuan!”

Not only did Fang Huazi find it hard to believe, but the rest of the people did too.

“This is great! I really recovered!” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Gao Cheng lifted his shirt up, revealing his belly where the trace of Black Rain Palm had disappeared.

“How did it happen? It really disappeared!”

“Gone. It’s gone. Five minutes. Five minutes was all it took to treat the Black Rain Palm!”

Everyone was looking at Gao Cheng’s belly in disbelief.

It was healed! Too fascinating.

“Haha, look. I really recovered. I finally recovered from the injury that has been torturing me for three years!”

As Gao Cheng exclaimed, he patted his stomach with excitement.

“There’s no such thing as impossible. You’re just a piece of trash. You still have the cheek to challenge with that petty skill of yours?”

Wang Xian sneered at Fang Huazi, “Now, can we fulfill our bet?!”

“Impossible. I don’t believe you can treat the Black Rain Palm within five minutes. No way!” he exclaimed in disbelief. Seeing that Gao Cheng had fully recovered, Fang Huazi was looking dreadful.

Absolutely impossible. No way!

“Why not? Miracle Doctor Wang deserves his name. He purged the toxic of the Black Rain Palm with his hand in five minutes. Look! Look!”

Gao Cheng rebuked in a loud voice as if he was a loyal fan of Wang Xian. His body jerked as he released an imposing vibe of a Martial Artist.

“Haha, my cultivation is restoring rapidly after I recovered. Within days, I will be able to return to my peak condition!”

“He really recovered!”

“It’s confirmed! He’s recovered!”

“Five minutes. He used only five minutes to treat Gao Cheng. He’s more formidable than the Sacred Followers Guild!”

“Where did this mysterious young man learn his medical skills from? He is highly proficient in it!”

The crowd was witnessing the entire incident with shocked faces. Some were surprised, some were exclaiming in disbelief. The rest had respect for Wang Xian from the bottoms of their hearts.

The hospital directors were looking at Wang Xian with great admiration in their eyes.

In medical learning, there is no first nor last. Whoever possesses the skill will win. Wang Xian, with a skill that surpassed the Sacred Followers Guild, was worthy of their respect.

“Let’s materialize the bet now!”

Wang Xian looked at Fang Huazi and said coldly, “Given the reputation of the Sacred Followers Guild, I’m sure you will not go back on your word!”

Fang Huazi had a mixed expression with a slight tinge of fear in his eyes.

The bet was to cripple both arms.

He trembled, as he did not expect he would lose to a miserable extent.

But, Fang Huazi dared not go back on his word because of the reputation of the Sacred Followers Guild.

He believed the other party would spread the word once he broke his promise. By then, the Sacred Followers Guild would cripple him without any helping hands.

No one can humiliate the Sacred Followers Guild!

Yan Zhongyuan darkened his expression gradually. It was beyond his expectations that Fang Huazi would lose to a nobody.

He had followed Fang Huazi here because Fang Huazi saved the old man in his family.

He did not anticipate such a situation now.

“Give me face and let this matter rest.”

Yan Zhongyuan lifted his chin and looked at Wang Xian, “I can forgive your ill manners just now. Give the Yan Family face.”

As Yan Zhongyuan spoke, he exuded a powerful vibe from his body.

Everyone around him took a deep breath.

Yan Zhongyuan spoke for the Yan Family. He was protecting Fang Huazi.

In Rivertown, the Yan Family could not be stopped!

“Scram!”
