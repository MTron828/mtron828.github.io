Translator: 549690339

“Boom!”

A crisp sound rang out. Not a single one of the two million people in the surroundings dared to speak, even their breathing was very weak.

Everyone stared at the two blue jade plates in the hands of the immortal God.

The moment the two crescent jade plates closed, a ray of blue light was directly emitted from within.

The light expanded slowly and gradually surrounded an area of five kilometers.

Gradually, a white aura appeared in this space.

“This is? Spiritual Energy? What a rich spiritual energy. This star guiding plate is real!”

A hint of heat flashed in Wang Xian’s eyes as he stared at the space of five kilometers.

“Today, we will open the star guiding plate and help the disciples of the Jade Hand Immortal sect and corpse Chief Dao to cultivate. All the disciples, cultivate well!”

Blood Arrow slowly took a step forward. As he stood in the air, he swept his gaze across the surroundings and said while looking down.

“Thank you, Lord Immortal God, thank you for your Grace!”

The disciples of the Jade Hand Immortal sect and corpse Chief Dao stared at the four immortal gods in the sky with burning eyes. They immediately knelt on the surface of the sea and on the ship and called out respectfully.

More than two million people gathered together and knelt down at the same time. What kind of scene was this? It was extremely shocking!

This was the dignity of an immortal god.

A satisfied expression appeared on the faces of the four immortal gods, but soon after, their eyes were filled with a terrifying killing intent.

Snow Demon, blood arrow, and the two elders stared at the outermost position.

There, six figures stood there. They did not kneel down. Instead, they raised their heads and stared at them with cold smiles.

“You finally appeared? Damn you guys!”

Blood Arrow’s eyes were filled with a crazed killing intent. With a move of his arm, a blood-red longbow appeared in his hand.

“It was you who killed young demon and Hong Ying. It was you who killed the members of my immortal sect!”

The blood-red light in the Snow Demon’s eyes flickered crazily. The violent killing intent instantly filled the entire sky with demonic aura.

Beside them, two old men were holding blue magic staffs in their hands. Their eyes were flickering as they stared at Wang Xian and the rest.

The sudden murderous aura and terrifying power shocked the two million people who were kneeling down. Their bodies were instantly covered in cold sweat and their faces were filled with terror.

“Snow Demon, Blood Arrow, do you still remember us?”

Wang Xian stared at the snow demon and blood arrow in the sky with a smile on his face. Then, he moved his body.

“Roar!”

Wang Xian’s body instantly transformed into a terrifying divine dragon that was 13 meters long. With a roar, his voice reverberated within a radius of tens of kilometers. A pair of majestic eyes stared at them.

“Roar!”

Following that, Ao Qitian, who was beside him, also roared loudly. His body instantly transformed into about eight meters. His entire body emitted a terrifying demonic aura as he stood beside Wang Xian.

“We are here for Revenge!”

Prime Minister Gui’s eyes revealed a cold expression. His body moved slightly and a turtle shell appeared in his hand. He stared at them with a murderous aura.

Clang

The sound of a sharp sword was heard. A dazzling golden glow instantly transformed the entire world into a golden peak world.

A terrifying ten-meter long sword appeared beside him.

Crack! Crack

The terrifying power did not stop. The sound of thunder and lightning instantly exploded throughout the world. A terrifying bolt of lightning struck a strange two-meter-tall creature in the sky.

“You dare to hurt our Dragon King, die!”

“Die!”

Ao Yao did not hide his body. His white, bright body stood in the void, flickering as if he could disappear at any time.

Although his power was the smallest, it made everyone’s hair stand on end, giving people a fatal feeling.

The Majestic Divine Dragon that gave off endless majesty.

The chaotic demonic monkey that gave off monstrous demonic qi!

The old man with the unfathomable turtle shell that could not be ignored.

A golden sharp sword that seemed to be able to pierce through the void.

A creature that controlled heavenly lightning and had terrifying lightning on its body.

There was also a white demon that seemed to be able to escape into space at any time.

Six terrifying auras were staring at him coldly. They were filled with killing intent.

“It’s you, Divine Dragon. How is this possible? Are you still alive?”

When the snow demon and Blood Arrow saw the six immortals that were emitting terrifying auras, their expressions changed drastically. They stared at Wang Xian intently.

“Are you surprised? I told you that I will come for revenge. I will kill my way into your world!”

Wang Xian’s gaze was cold as he swayed his majestic body. “All of you will die today!”

When he finished speaking, Ao Jian, Prime Minister Gui, and the rest flew to the surroundings in an instant and surrounded him.

“Six Immortals, six Immortals!”

The snow demon and the blood arrow growled, “Six immortals want to kill us? Dream On!”

They had never expected that the enemy had six immortals. There were six of them.

In particular, none of them were human. Each of them was exuding a wild and violent aura.

Especially the divine dragon in the middle. It was even more powerful than when they had launched a sneak attack not long ago. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

They had originally wanted to use the star attraction disc to lure them out and then kill them.

In the end, just as they had hoped, the person was drawn out. However, it was actually the six damn immortal gods.

In a battle, it was not certain who would win or lose!

“Hiss!”

Beside them, the two old men also sucked in a breath of cold air.

Their gazes swept over the six strange-looking immortal gods with terrifying auras. Their eyes were filled with fear.

The two of them exchanged a glance. An inexplicable luster flashed in their eyes.

“We are enough to kill all of you!”

Wang Xian’s eyes flashed with a cold expression as he slowly raised his dragon claw.

Prime Minister Gui held the turtle shell in his hand tightly while ao Yao disappeared into the void.

Ao Qitian’s sea-pacifying divine needle was held in his hand as it slowly grew longer.

The crackling sound of thunder could be heard. Thunder rumbled in the sky from time to time.

“Kill! Kill the two immortal gods of My Yu Ding world! All the experts, even if you are seriously injured, I will kill all of you today!”

The Snow Demon’s eyes were blood-red as it raised its head and roared.

Its voice spread across hundreds of kilometers!

“Kill! I will make your corpses into my slaves and make you suffer for Eternity!”

The Blood Arrow instantly drew the blood-red longbow.

The battle between the ten immortals was about to start!

“Wait, Sir Dragon God!”

At this moment, the voices of the two old men were heard.

Wang Xian was slightly stunned as he stared at the two old men.

The snow demon and the blood arrow stared at the two old men.

The expressions of the two old men didn’t change at all. They cupped their hands at Wang Xian and said, “Sir Dragon God, we don’t have any enmity with you. We don’t want to participate in this!”

Wang Xian was completely stunned when he heard the old man’s words.

Don’t want to get involved? Are you trying to stay out of this?

“Wind demon, what are you guys talking about?”

The Snow Demon glared at the two old men with her blood-red eyes and roared furiously.

“Sect leader of the Snow Demon sect and sect leader of the Blood Arrow Sect, you guys are the ones who provoked us. Young demon and Hong Ying died because of you. We don’t want to be your scapegoats!”

The two elders’faces were cold as they looked at Wang Xian. There was a hint of nervousness in their eyes as they waited for his reply.

“Alright, you guys leave this place!”

Wang Xian laughed and stared at the snow demon and the blood arrow with a mocking expression!
