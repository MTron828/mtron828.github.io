3557 The 3556 Holy Dragon lineage was trash! Go

Whoosh

The wings of light flapped on both sides of the Holy Peak. It was unaffected by Wang Xian’s suppression.

It flew into the distance at a terrifying speed!

Wang Xian frowned slightly when he saw this scene!

He shook his head helplessly!

The Twin Dragon Eyes was an innate treasure of the Holy Dragon lineage. This innate treasure was merely a restriction set up by the Holy Dragon King!

And this sacred peak was obviously an innate supreme treasure of the Angel clan.

It wasn’t easy to obtain an innate supreme treasure of the Angel clan!

It was obviously set by an archangel, and this Archangel’s level wasn’t low!

“Eh?”

At this moment, he sensed something and looked in a direction, and his dragon eyes were shining!

“F * CK, F * CK, F * CK, F * ck!”

At the same time, in an extremely far place on the Dragon Palace’s side.

A group of more courageous powerhouses were watching the scene on the Dragon Palace’s side through various treasures and props!

When the war began and the terrifying energy swept over the sky of the Dragon Palace, they could no longer see anything clearly!

They vaguely saw the holy dragon son rush down and then nothing!

Because they were too far away, they didn’t hear any sound.

However, this war ended faster than they expected!

In less than a few minutes, everything was calm.

Then, they saw only the experts of the dragon palace floating there.

The experts of the Sacred Dragon Clan turned into corpses one after another!

“How is this possible? How is this possible? The Holy Dragon lineage was defeated? In less than a few minutes, all of them were fleeing for their lives?”

“This time, the Holy Dragon lineage sent out 11 universe masters with level-three Combat Power, right? More than 20 universe masters with level-two Combat Power? How could they be defeated so quickly?”

“Did you see the side of the Dragon Palace? There are more than 20 corpses of the Holy Dragon. Damn, how is this possible?”

How was this possible?

They had thought that a fierce battle would break out when they saw the Holy Dragon attacking the Dragon Palace.

They had thought that the Dragon Palace would be defeated and flee!

But they had never thought that this would be the result!

The Holy Dragon bloodline had been defeated, and a group of great beings had been killed!

How… How was this possible?

According to the power displayed by the Dragon Palace, how strong were they?

At most three or four universe masters with level 3 combat strength?

And Now?

To be able to defeat 11 universe masters with level 3 combat strength so quickly, how terrifying would their strength be?

This battle was completely out of everyone’s expectations!

“A great being from the Dragon Palace is looking at us? No Way, how strong is he? We can sense him from such a far distance?”

“There can’t be a terrifying existence at the level of a universe overlord in the Dragon Palace, right? That should be the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace. Has He sensed us?”

At this moment, they saw Wang Xian looking in their direction.

Everyone felt their scalps turn numb!

They were already far enough!

How could they be discovered?

“That figure has disappeared!”

At this moment, an expert spoke up!

According to their detection of the treasure, Wang Xian’s figure had already disappeared!

“He shouldn’t have discovered us. We are already very far away from the Dragon Palace. Even if he is a level three master of the universe, it would take at least a minute for him to fly over, right?”

An elder spoke up! ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The others nodded slightly!

They felt very safe from here.

In order to prevent accidents, they set up a perimeter!

Even a universe ruler level 3 warrior would need a minute to fly here.

This minute was enough for them to leave!

Not to mention a minute, even a second was enough for them to leave!

“I didn’t expect the Dragon Palace to be so powerful!”

“I think the Dragon Palace is as powerful as the Sacred Dragon Clan. Although the Sacred Dragon Clan didn’t use their full strength this time, the Dragon Palace defeated them too quickly!”

“Yeah, I think the Dragon Palace is even more powerful than the ancestral Dragon Clan Now!”

The experts were discussing in shock, and their eyes were shining!

“However, it’s good that the Dragon Palace is powerful. If the Sacred Dragon Clan wins, the Divine Dragon Clan will be completely defeated!”

A middle-aged man said with a smile!

As an outsider, they hoped that the Dragon Palace could win!

After all, no normal creature would want a dog-like force to win!

“If there’s nothing else, stay away from here!”

Just as the middle-aged man finished speaking, a voice suddenly sounded in the minds of everyone around them!

The sudden voice exploded in their minds, causing their expressions to freeze slightly!

They opened their mouths slightly and raised their heads to look at the sky!

They saw a young, towering figure with dragon horns floating there.

The young man glanced at them and then disappeared!

At this moment, cold sweat broke out on their backs.

“Hiss!”

They gasped and looked at each other in shock!

“He… even if he’s not a universe ruler, he must be a half-step ruler, right?”

An expert growled in a low voice!

Just now, all of them felt extremely horrified!

If this expert from the Dragon Palace had attacked them, all of them would have died!

How terrifying!

“No wonder he could easily defeat the Holy Dragon lineage!”

Everyone thought to themselves!

…

Wang Xian only sensed that someone was looking at the Dragon Palace. He did not see the group of living beings who had come to watch the battle.

However, just in case, he flew over to investigate!

Wang Xian did not say much to them and did not bother with them!

It did not affect the Dragon Palace.

After returning to the Dragon Palace, Wang Xian immediately came to the front of the Heaven Formation!

At this moment, the Heaven Formation had already started its first curse!

However, at the same time, it was located in the Divine Mountain of light, the lair of the Holy Dragons!

When the Six Light Godly Dragons escaped from Dragon Palace and returned to their God country, they did not immediately recover from their injuries.

Instead, they immediately flew toward the Holy Dragon Palace!

The death of the Holy Dragon Son and the terrifying power displayed by dragon palace shocked them beyond words!

Most importantly, this time, they had actually lost five universe masters with level-three combat power.

There were five of them!

They had been fighting with the ancestral dragon bloodline for more than 1,000 years, but none of them had lost five Pinnacle Great Beings!

Five of them had died in the Dragon Palace.

They had even tried their best to escape!

The power of the Dragon Palace was too terrifying!

They wanted to report the death of the Sacred Dragon Son and all the Great Beings to the Sacred Dragon Emperor!
