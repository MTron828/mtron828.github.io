Chapter 378: Bloodbath (4)

Fang Huazi was laughing hysterically without reservation, as he felt he’d gotten his revenge.

He used to have a bright future but had to sever both of his arms to undergo long term treatment.

Over this period, he had been living in anger and fear. Now that the kin of his enemy had to suffer the same misery or be thrown into even greater despair, Fang Huazi was exhilarated.

A distorted sense of excitement.

“Miracle Doctor Fang Huazi, your arms could still grow out gradually. However, she can forget about standing up in the future!” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The young master of the Nine Lotus Sect revealed a faint smile as he looked at Miracle Doctor Fang Huazi laughing hysterically.

“Haha, you are right! This is the price for messing with me!”

Fang Huazi stared at Wang Xian with a hideous expression. He licked his lips and resumed his laughter.

“It’s my mistake for not killing you the last time!” said Wang Xian emotionlessly.

“A factionless doctor dares to kill one from the Sacred Followers Guild? Hehe! How brazen are you?” the young master of the Nine Lotus Sect chuckled in disdain. He scrutinized Wang Xian from head to toe before continuing, “Now that I have seen the youngest Miracle Doctor, you don’t look that special to me!”

Subsequently, he lifted his head proudly and turned to Xiao Yu. “What’s the matter, wild brat? Why are you here in a wheelchair? Were you missing me already? Hahaha!”

“YOU...”

Upon hearing the young master of the Nine Lotus Sect, Xiao Yu was furious and glowered at him.

“For hurting my sister, you shall die. Everyone in the Nine Lotus Sect will follow you shortly!”

Wang Xian released his grip on the wheelchair, stared at the young master of the Nine Lotus Sect and Miracle Doctor Fang Huazi and walked towards them.

“Oh? You are going to kill all of us?”

When the young master of the Nine Lotus Sect heard Wang Xian, he squinted his eyes and observed the group of six. “With this group? Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown? Hehe! Are you under the perception that we are just an ordinary First-class Force?”

“What are they here for? Courting their own deaths?”

“Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown is indeed famous. A factionless doctor that is said to be able to call upon three to four Inborn experts. However, he’s still a far cry from the Nine Lotus Sect and the Sacred Followers Guild. He wants to get revenge? That’s courting his death!”

“How full of himself is he? Is the Nine Lotus Sect something that a factionless doctor could go against? Moreover, there’s still the Sacred Followers Guild!”

Around them, the crowd saw Wang Xian but were discussing loudly without reservation.

A factionless doctor would just be a meager factionless doctor even if he possessed extraordinary medical techniques. When compared with the Nine Lotus Sect or the Sacred Followers Guild, it wouldn’t even be a meaningful comparison at all.

The young master of the Nine Lotus Sect stared at Wang Xian nonchalantly. No matter how incredible a Miracle Doctor was, he couldn’t be stronger than him.

Wanting to kill him? What a joke!

Pa!

Wang Xian stretched out his hand emotionlessly. From his side, Mo Qinglong threw Zhan Lu into his hand.

“Today, I’m going to start a bloodbath with the Nine Lotus Sect!” Wang Xian wasn’t paying attention to the discussion of the crowd as he remarked coldly.

“He’s going to do it on his own? Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown must be dumb. The young master of the Nine Lotus Sect is ranked fifth on the Outstanding Young Heroes Chart and is an Inborn expert. This isn’t a contest of medical techniques. What a dumbass!”

From the crowd, a young man spoke loudly in contempt as he saw Wang Xian receiving the longsword.

Wang Xian revealed a chilling smile and glanced at the young man.

“Hehe, since you are courting death, kill him!”

The young master of the Nine Lotus Sect looked at Wang Xian with ridicule. He picked up the cup of tea beside him, took a sip and ordered the disciples of the Nine Lotus Sect around him.

“Yes, young master!”

A middle-aged man nodded his head before turning to Wang Xian. He said, “You are just a meager factionless doctor and yet you dare to mess with our Nine Lotus Sect? Today, I’ll let you be like your sister forever!”

Just as he finished his words, Wang Xian moved.

Although Wang Xian was nursing grave injuries at this instant, he still could match a Dan Realm expert.

His speed was incomparably fast. Just as the middle-aged man finished his words, he suddenly sensed a shadow appearing before him.

His expression changed greatly. Turning his palm, water circulated around it as he shouted loudly, “Now die!”

He slapped his palm forward directly.

Pfft!

“Too weak!”

At this instant, a cold and emotionless voice propagated.

The middle-aged man stared in disbelief as he turned his head over stiffly.

He saw that the young man had his back facing him. It was as though he had not struck previously.

However, when the middle-aged man looked down, he saw a longsword being pulled out of his chest gradually. Instantly, he was filled with shock.

Cough cough! “You...”

The middle-aged man was dumbfounded. Before he could complete his words, he fell to the ground.

Wang Xian pulled the longsword out of the middle-aged man’s chest. Without taking a second look, Wang Xian continued walking towards the young master of the Nine Lotus Sect and Miracle Doctor Fang Huazi.

He wasn’t walking quickly but brought with him stifling pressure.

“What?”

“What incredible speed and sword!”

“How can this be possible? That middle-aged man from the Nine Lotus Sect is a Half-step to Inborn expert!”

“How could a factionless doctor be so insanely strong?”

That single strike had shocked the crowd as they stared at Wang Xian with disbelief.

The young man who called Wang Xian a dumbass was in a daze. His expression changed constantly as fear gleamed in his eyes.

Huh?

The young master of the Nine Lotus Sect and Miracle Doctor Fang Huazi were taken aback as their mood turned solemn.

“How dare you kill our people from the Nine Lotus Sect!”

When the surrounding disciples from the Nine Lotus Sect saw the middle-aged man killed, they quickly surrounded Wang Xian without waiting for the orders of their young master.

“Kill him!” instructed the young master of the Nine Lotus Sect coldly.

Poof poof poof!

The instant the young master of the Nine Lotus Sect finished his words, Wang Xian struck. It was still that insanely quick speed.

The move was simple as Wang Xian simply slashed across the bodies of the eight disciples from the Nine Lotus Sect.

This time, none of them had reacted to Wang Xian again. Their eyes opened wider and their bodies shivered as they saw their waists.

“So... So strong!”

“Sss! What incredible strength. He’s definitely an Inborn expert! He’s definitely...”

The crowd gasped and was shocked by what they had just witnessed.

In the previous instant, he had killed a Half-step to Inborn expert. The next instant, he killed another eight Level 9 to Half-step to Inborn disciples from the Nine Lotus Sect. This strength was completely beyond their expectations.

Wang Xian turned to the young master of the Nine Lotus Sect and Fang Huazi as he remarked, “As I’ve said, I’m going to slaughter every single one of you!”

Bam! Bam! Bam!

Wang Xian finished his remarks as the eight disciples of the Nine Lotus Sect fell to the ground. The eyes of the surrounding crowd had all constricted upon witnessing the development.

The young master of the Nine Lotus Sect pulled a long face and glowered at Wang Xian. He gritted his teeth and said, “Great... Great... I did not expect you to be an Inborn expert. What a surprise! However, even if you are an Inborn level expert, you will still pay the price for messing with us!”

The young master of the Nine Lotus Sect no longer had the same composure as before. He stood up and put on a set of blue gloves beside him.

Fang Huazi sat to the side, eyes shimmering, watching Wang Xian cautiously.

Wang Xian held Zhan Lu and continued walking towards them.
