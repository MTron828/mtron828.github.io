“The six of us will each send out 70% of our forces!”

“With this planet as the command planet, gather our forces and prepare to attack!”

Within the hall, grade 9 Sky sect leader and Sky Mountain Sword sect sword Emperor’s orders rang out!

Each force sending out 70% of their forces, with the current strength of the six forces, they could gather about 2,000 undying godly monarchs!

These were only undying godly monarchs, and there were even eternal god Lord Level Warriors. As for the numbers, they could already reach over a million!

After the plan was made, the Warriors from the six forces immediately gathered their subordinates!

The first thing they had to do now was to destroy all their planets and bases apart from Dragon Star!

When the six forces moved together, the entire star South Galaxy could feel it!

After all, the ninth grade Sky sect and the Sky Mountain Sword sect were the two major powers with deep foundations. In addition to the four major powers that were previously ranked in the top ten, if they acted together, all the powers would be able to sense it!

These six major powers could be said to be one-third or one-fourth of the entire southern star system’s power!

Moreover, the number of life planets they controlled had reached several thousand. It was impossible to conceal such a large operation!

Everyone in the outside world was filled with shock at the alliance of the six major forces!

From their point of view, the Dragon Palace and the Tiger Demon Empire were on the verge of being destroyed!

“This is bad. The alliance of these six forces can gather 2,000 immortal godly monarchs. If they were to invade, how are they going to defend themselves? Where did Wang Xian go?”

At the same time, in the Dragon Palace on Dragon Star, Emperor Star Lady sat beside the Dragon King Palace and read the information on the AI. She pouted and said!

“The Dragon King and the rest should be in the abyss right now. We can’t contact them in the Abyss!”

Prime Minister Gui frowned. They couldn’t contact the Dragon King. Most importantly, most of the powerful warriors of the Dragon Palace had been taken away!

Right now, only sky array was in charge of the Dragon Palace. There were only a few level 6 undying godly monarchs left!

Facing the attacks of the 6 powers, they could only defend passively!

“Prime Minister Gui, Dragon Queens, we have to think of a way to contact the Dragon King and the rest, otherwise, it’ll be hard for us to defend against the attacks of the 6 Powers!”

The Warriors from the Tiger Chaos Demon Country said anxiously!

“The Dragon King and the rest aren’t here, they’re currently guarding the area around Dragon Star, if they dare attack, we’ll just Sneak Attack!”

Tian Chen looked at them and said indifferently!

“Senior, if they all attack, will the dragon star be able to withstand them?”

Celestial Maiden asked Tian Chen worriedly!

“No problem. Unless another force similar to the Sky Mountain Sword sect comes, they won’t be able to break through the defense of the Dragon Star!”

Tian Chen said indifferently!

“That’s good, at least the Dragon Star’s surroundings are safe!”

Emperor star lady nodded, she still firmly believed in Tian Chen’s words!

After all, this was the legendary God Emperor, the god Emperor of Tian Chen who swept through the lands!

He was once the number one array master in this resplendent greater world!

“Right now we can only passively defend, but we can still play with them!”

Prime Minister Gui said coldly from the side!

Even though the Dragon Palace wasn’t around right now, there were still 1,500 undying fighters!

Out of these 1,500, there were still over 100 piercing dragon species!

Over 100 undying emperor level piercing dragon species, if they really stepped into their territory and started killing, they wouldn’t be able to afford it!

“Ah, someone in the AI said that the six powers have already made their move!”

At that moment, Emperor Star Lady looked at the AI and said with her mouth slightly agape!

“All members of the Dragon Palace, let’s Get Ready Too!”

Prime Minister Gui stood up and his voice immediately resounded throughout the entire Dragon Palace!

“Let’s go, ahead of us is a planet from the Tiger Chaos Demon Country, destroy it!”

Above a planet, hundreds of thousands of people rushed over through the teleportation formation. Star piercing sword immediately brought them into the void!

The two experts of the Sky Mountain Sword sect and the ninth-grade heaven sect were in the lead. They stared coldly ahead and said in a deep voice!

“Destroy all their planets directly. Leave none alive!”

The sect master of the three seas sect said in an extremely ferocious manner from the side!

“Let’s Go!”

The elder in the lead of the Sky Mountain Sword sect nodded and said immediately!

“Whoosh!”

Star-piercing sword immediately drew a snow-white, cold luster and sped forward!

“I heard that those cowardly beasts from the tiger demon country have all entered the nine planets around Dragon Star. I wonder if it’s true or not!”

An elder from the demon-slaying sect said in a deep voice as his eyes flickered!

“It’s the planet in front of you. HMPH, a bunch of beasts. You have such a day too!”

Everyone from the demon-slaying sect growled with hatred on their faces!

...

Half an hour later, a life planet appeared in everyone’s line of sight. The entire planet was slightly silent, with only a few uncivilized beasts galloping on it! Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“I’ll let you all experience the power of Star Piercing Sword!”

The Sky Mountain Sword sect members smiled and said to everyone!

“Clang Clang Clang!”

The next moment, the entire star piercing sword let out a metallic sound, waves of sharpness coming from above!

The Cold Aura made all the undying godly monarchs shudder, immediately flying down from the star piercing sword!

“One sword, Piercing Star!”

A Level 6 undying godly monarch from the Sky Mountain Sword sect shouted!

“Clang Clang Clang Clang!”

Terrifying metal gleams appeared around the piercing star sword, revolving around it!

“Sou!”

...

In the next moment, everyone saw the huge piercing star sword flash through a beam of light, instantly entering a planet in the Tiger Chaos Demon Country!

“Boom! Boom!”

After the star-piercing sword entered, it directly penetrated the planet in less than ten seconds!

Following that, waves of extremely terrifying explosions sounded. It was as if the entire planet was filled with extremely terrifying explosives!

“Boom!”

The incomparably huge planet was like an exploding rubber ball as it directly shot out in all directions!

The planet that was still intact a moment ago had instantly turned into a star fragment!

All the life forms on it had been annihilated!

This was even more terrifying than the extinction of the planet’s species!

“Hiss, what a powerful star piercing sword, this terrifying attack is comparable to a full strength attack from an undying god King Level 7 warrior!”

The God kings from the ninth grade sky sect watched this scene in shock!

“Hahaha, the attack from star piercing sword is indeed comparable to the destructive power of an undying god King Level 7 warrior. It’s a pity that there aren’t many Heaven Fey on this planet, let’s go to the next location!”

The Sky Mountain Sword sect warrior laughed out loud and said coldly!

“Let’s go to the main planet of the tiger chaotic demon country and destroy their main planet. Let’s make them homeless dogs!”

The demon slaying sect leader saw this scene and roared excitedly!

“Take it slow, there’s no rush. What we want is to make the Dragon Palace and tiger chaotic demon country fear and despair!”

“Perish in panic and despair!”
