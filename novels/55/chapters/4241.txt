Translator: 549690339

Wang Xian stood in the sky above a huge mountain and scanned his surroundings.

Finally, he looked at huming mountain and nodded at him.

“Let’s have a breakthrough here! ” He opened his mouth and said!

“It’s the Dragon King! ”

Huming mountain nodded his head in excitement.

“Roar Roar!”

He growled and transformed into the body of a godly tiger, floating in the void.

Wang Xian looked over and revealed a smile on his face.

This mountain range universe was mainly made up of metal, wood, water, fire, Earth, wind, lightning, and darkness. Similar to the nine-origin universe, the Humming Tiger Mountain belonged to the metal attribute and could be used to make a breakthrough here.

The Humming Tiger Mountain was suspended in the air and waves of majestic energy began to gather!

“Huh?”

However, when the humming Tiger Mountain began to gather energy…

Wang Xian could feel waves of energy rapidly flying towards him.

This energy was very special and did not belong to the power of this universe.

Furthermore, this energy was rapidly approaching him!

Wang Xian stood there and looked over quietly.

“There’s a powerful energy over there. Could there be treasures?”

“Treasures. All the treasures in the mountain range and universe belong to us.

Let’s kill our way over. hahaha! ”

Charge! ”

At the same time, in the distance, many strange-shaped terrifying creatures were running in the void space.

Among them, some were emitting the stench of blood, emitting an earthy yellow luster.

Their bodies seemed to be rotting.

Some were bathed in the lightning, possessing incomparably sharp pupils and savage mouths.

Some of them were pitch-black and their bodies were filled with terrifying sharp thorns!

There were more than ten thousand of these creatures flying towards them at a rapid speed.

Most of them were at the level of a venerable while some were at the level of a ruler.

They flew over at a rapid speed.

Wang Xian sensed something before they got close and narrowed his eyes slightly.

Boom

When he saw a group of monsters flying over quickly, he waved his arm and a wave of energy enveloped them.

More than 10,000 creatures were caught in front of him.

“Who are you?”

“Oh no, you are a powerhouse in the Heaven’s origin realm.”

When the group of monsters suddenly sensed the change in the scene in front of them and saw Wang Xian staring at them coldly, their faces changed drastically. They shouted in horror!

Buzz

Soul absorbing power! ”

Wang Xian ignored them. With a wave of his arm, a wave of soul absorbing power enveloped them completely.

Following that, waves of information were transmitted into Wang Xian’s mind.

When Wang Xian sensed the information in their minds, he was slightly stunned. His face was filled with astonishment. “Intruders? From the evil sequence faction. ” “The mountain universe has been invaded! ”

“The central area is suffering from a powerful attack! ”

“The Intruders from the evil faction are more than twice as powerful as the mountain universe!”

When Wang Xian received the information one by one, his gaze froze slightly!

He did not expect that this universe was being attacked.

Furthermore, the universe that initiated the attack was so powerful.

This was not a good thing for Wang Xian and the rest!

“Humming Tiger Mountain, stop the breakthrough for now! ”

Without any hesitation, Wang Xian immediately instructed Humming Tiger Mountain!

“What?”Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Humming Tiger Mountain, who had already started to prepare for the breakthrough, had a slight change in expression as he looked at Wang Xian.

“Sir Dragon King, did something happen?”

Humming Tiger Mountain asked Wang Xian with an awkward expression.

He glanced at the group of monsters in front of Wang Xian and focused his gaze.

He could immediately tell that these monsters were not living beings from the mountain range universe!

“I received a message from his mind. Currently, the mountain range universe is suffering from a powerful invasion. The intruders are very strong and have already reached the Central Region! ”

“This group of intruders belongs to the evil sequence universe. Their strength is more than twice that of the mountain range universe! ”

Wang Xian opened his mouth and said. His face turned gloomy as well. “This group of intruders might not only be here for the blood and food, but also for the resources. They might also be here for the quota to make a breakthrough in this universe. That’s why you can’t make a breakthrough now! ”

“Intruders from the evil sequence?”

Hu Mingshan’s expression changed drastically. “This… I’ve only left this universe for a few decades. How did I get invaded into the Central Region?”

There were at least four heaven origin creation realm powerhouses in the mountain range universe.

However, they were attacked in the central region within a few decades.

The strength of the intruders was definitely extremely powerful.

It far surpassed the mountain range universe.

The evil sequence intruders invaded a universe for the sake of obtaining blood, food, and resources!

Now that he had broken through here, he was undoubtedly competing with the intruders of the evil sequence.

The intruders could sense that they would definitely charge over.

The intruders were able to invade the center of the mountain range universe.

That meant that they were extremely powerful.

The number of heaven origin creation realm powerhouses was definitely not small.

If they really charged over, the Dragon King might not be able to resist them.

Moreover, even if he could resist them, the group of intruders and a large number of experts would still be able to stop him from breaking through!

Then, this would be a disaster for him!

“Lord Dragon King, what… What should we do now?” Hu Ming Shan didn’t know what to do at this moment.

He felt a little helpless.

It was too difficult and dangerous to break through at the peak of the universe ruler realm!

Now that he had found a universe, an accident happened.

If there was no Dragon King, it would be suicidal to let him break through by himself!

“Let’s go to the center of this universe to see the specific situation. Let’s see if there’s still a chance!”

Wang Xian hesitated for a moment and said!

“Thank you, Dragon King. I’ll listen to your arrangements! ”

Huming mountain thanked him immediately. “If I can make a breakthrough, I will definitely repay your kindness in the future. ”

He thought that the Dragon King would give up and let him find a new place.

He didn’t expect that he would help him solve this problem. This made him very grateful!

“Let’s go and take a look! ”

Wang Xian waved his hand and instantly killed tens of thousands of creatures from the evil sequence faction.

These invaders deserved to die.

After invading this universe, the number of creatures that died in their mouths was countless!

They used the creatures from the mountain range universe as their blood food and directly devoured them to increase their strength.

This kind of fellow deserved to be killed!

After Wang Xian killed them, he brought huming mountain and immediately flew towards the center of the mountain range universe.

According to the information that Wang Xian received from the creatures of the evil sequence camp,.

The number of strong disciples who invaded the mountain range universe this time had reached more than 100 million.

It was almost as if their universe had come out in full force!

They were determined to completely destroy the mountain range universe.

Furthermore, the strength of their universe was also very powerful.

There were seven strong cultivators in the heaven origin creation realm.

This number, is already a lot!
