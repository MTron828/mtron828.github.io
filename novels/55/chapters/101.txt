Chapter 102: A Man Stopping 10 Thousand Men

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

Argh!

A blood-curdling scream propagated throughout the bar and even overwhelmed the deafening music.

Tragic, really tragic!

The whole bottle of alcohol smashed into the head of a man, making him bleed profusely immediately.

The other three young men and girls were stunned. They looked at their companion, whose head was bleeding profusely, in disbelief.

“Damn it. How dare you start the fight!”

That young man with tattoos behind his back looked viciously at Wang Xian and growled angrily.

“Start the fight?”

Wang Xian looked emotionlessly at this young man and grabbed another bottle of beer from the table.

He did not make use of his great strength and did not bother to talk to them.

This was because this group of people wouldn’t require him to use his full strength. Moreover, he did not like to talk while fighting.

“Scumbags! You guys are too much!”

Seeing that Wang Xian had started the fight, Wang Dahai, who was standing behind Wang Xian, was initially hesitant. He clenched his fist tightly before grabbing another bottle of beer.

His brother had already started the fight for his sake. How could he possibly just stand there and watch?

What kind of brother would he be if he just stood by?

The other few young men found it hard to accept, as they had never expected these two young men to start the fight the moment they couldn’t agree on things. Furthermore, they were so ruthless!

The moment Wang Xian saw Wang Dahai readying himself, he revealed a smile.

That’s how a brother should be. They should fight together, carry guns together, sleep together and visit prostitutes together. [1]

“Fuck! Bastards! Don’t think I’m afraid of you!”

The other three young men were looking hideous and immediately charged towards Wang Dahai and Wang Xian!

However, there was no way their power and strength could be compared with Wang Xian.

Bam bam!

The two bottles of beer landed on two other people. As for Wang Dahai, he was 1.8 meters tall and weighed over 190 catties.

Most people wouldn’t be a match for him. Therefore, the three young men were put to the ground easily.

“They must be eager to die! How dare they touch us!”

A young man held onto his head and looked menacing.

“You guys... How dare you guys cause trouble here...” Rongrong shrieked and pointed to Wang Xian and Wang Dahai. Her face had turned as white as a sheet.

“Grrr. Fight, don’t stop!”

“Can’t even defeat two when there’re four of you? Trash! Get up and fight!”

The crowd in the bar noticed the fight and started cheering loudly.

They were here for fun and it was better for them when the bar was livelier.

“Weak and fragile!”

Wang Xian looked coldly at the four young men struggling to get up. He grabbed another bottle and taunted, “Come, let’s continue!”

“How dare you... You’re going to die...”

The tattooed young men, whose head was covered in blood, stared at Wang Xian. He was seething with anger. “If you can walk out of Love Bar tonight, I wouldn’t be able to show myself here in the future!”

“What’s the matter? Who’s fighting? Who’s fighting? Get out if you want to fight!”

At this moment, 5-6 security guards of the bar rushed over and shouted loudly.

“Fuck! Wait here if you dare!”

Although the tattooed young men saw the security guards rushing over, he showed no fear and roared loudly.

“What’s the matter? Still want to fight?” When the middle-aged security guard heard him, he frowned and walked over.

“If I don’t cripple these two brats, my name wouldn’t be Fifth Master Gong!”

The young man with the tattoo took our his phone, ignored the security guard and dialed a number.

The group of security guards frowned as they turned their attention to this young man with tattoos.

“Boss, it’s me, Fifth Master Gong!”

One of the security guards was shocked and murmured to the middle-aged man beside him.

“Fifth Master Gong, if you are causing trouble, please get out. Don’t do it in the Love Bar!” the middle-aged security said to the young man with tattoos.

“I’ll leave after crippling these two brats. They dare to touch me? I’ll kill them!”

Fifth Master Gong’s face sank and he roared loudly.

“Wang Xian... What should we do now?” Wang Dahai could sense the savage vibes from Fifth Master Gong. He wasn’t even afraid of the security guards! At this moment, Wang Dahai felt a little flustered.

The reason why he joined the fight was also because he was in the heat of the moment. However, the other party was clearly calling for reinforcements and had threatened to cripple them. This made him a little scared!

“What should we do? It’s obvious to continue whacking them before their reinforcement arrives. We couldn’t be waiting for them to be here to beat us up, right?”

Wang Xian smiled at Wang Dahai. To Wang Dahai’s astonishment, Wang Xian charged towards Fifth Master Gong directly.

Everyone was shocked!

They had not seen anyone who fought in such a manner.

Under normal circumstances, when the other parties were all put to the ground and were calling for reinforcements, the one who started the fight would typically run or just wait. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

However, this young man started the fight once again!

When Wang Xian charged over, he saw that Fifth Master Gong was filled with shock and disbelief.

He smiled at him, “Aren’t you calling people over? In that case, I shall see if I can kill you before your guys arrive!”

The moment he finished his sentence, he smashed the bottle in his hand on Fifth Master Gong’s arm.

Argh! Fifth Master Gong let out a horrifying shriek. His arm had already been deformed.

His face was filled with horror.

He isn’t playing by the rules!

“Continue!”

Wang Xian smiled again at Fifth Master Gong. Under his horrified gaze, he smashed towards the other arm!

Bam! Crack crack!

The sound of bottles and bones cracking propagated once again. The crowd was all shock by the development.

That young man really wants to kill Fifth Master Gong!

The expressions on the other three injured young men were as white as sheets as they looked towards Wang Xian.

As for the other three girls, they were lost and flustered. They cuddled together and were filled with fear as they looked at Wang Xian.

“Your guys are a little slow!”

Wang Xian smiled sarcastically as he spoke to Fifth Master Gong and grabbed another bottle.

“No.. No... No... Please...”

Fifth Master Gong was completely petrified. He was truly afraid this time.

“Who the fuck dared to touch my brother!”

At this moment, an angry growl sounded.

Fifth Master Gong was thrilled and stared at Wang Xian menacingly.

“You are finished! You are finished! Haha!”

Over 10 people rushed over. Everyone in the group was burly, and a middle-aged man in front of the group looked coldly over.

Bam!

Wang Xian still smashed the bottle over as the shriek of pain sounded once again.

“Fuck, you dare to continue!”

The group that charged over saw Wang Xian smashing the bottle down and heard the wail of Fifth Master Gong. Among them, one burly young men dashed towards Wang Xian directly.

Bam!

With a simple sweeping kick, the young man that was dashing over was sent flying back and landed heavily on the sofa by the side.

Instantly, everyone was stunned.

Expert!

This young man isn’t simple!

No wonder he wasn’t afraid of anything!

Wang Xian looked emotionlessly at them before revealing a faint smile. “Just a dozen people? I’m afraid this might not be enough!”

The group that arrived with momentum frowned when they saw how calm Wang Xian was.

This young man had just sent one of them flying away with a single kick. Moreover, the man that was sent flying didn’t get up after the kick. It was clear that the young man was strong!

The bar quietened down suddenly as everyone looked to the young man standing in the middle.

He had the vibes of being able to stop 10 thousand men!
