Chapter 992: 0993, get out of the way. I’ll kill them first

Translator: 5496903

Wang Xian was their savior. If Wang Xian didn’t save them earlier, they would be dead by now.

As for their savior, they couldn’t possibly watch the members of the young master’s mercenary group kill him.

The group of girls from the amethyst mercenary group stared at Yun Hanhai and the rest with hostility. They didn’t show any signs of weakness.

Yun Hanhai’s face instantly darkened when he saw them pull out their weapons.

“You guys don’t have a grudge against this kid, right? Now, for his sake, you guys are actually going against us!”

He clenched his fists tightly and said in a cold voice.

“Give our amethyst mercenary group some face!”

Deputy Commander Xiao said with a gloomy face.

They also didn’t want to become enemies with young master’s mercenary group.

All the members of young master’s mercenary group had extraordinary backgrounds. It was definitely not a wise choice to make an enemy out of them.

Even though they were the third-ranked mercenary group in the Demon Hunter College, they didn’t dare to provoke them easily.

“I’ll give you face, but this kid won’t give us face!”

Yun Hanhai sneered. With a move of his arm, a long sword appeared in his hand.

His gaze swept over vice commander Xiao and the others, carrying a trace of killing intent. “You are already injured. You are no match for us now. Don’t force us into a corner!”

“Clang, Clang, Clang!”

Behind him, the group of young master’s mercenary group members directly pulled out their weapons.

Especially those middle-aged men. Their bodies were filled with killing intent as they coldly stared at the amethyst mercenary group members.

“We will not take a step back!”

Vice Commander Xiao said with a resolute expression.

“Good, good!”

Yun Hanhai’s expression changed slightly as he looked to the side. “Lu Zishi, kill this brat for me. In the future, there will be benefits for all of you!”

“Oh?”

The group of youths from the Zhan Hai mercenary group who were standing at the side and watching the situation suddenly froze when they heard Yun Hanhai’s words.

The expression of the youth in the lead changed slightly.

“Vice Commander Yun...”

“Are we in or out?”

Yun Hanhai’s sharp gaze looked over.

That Youth’s leader revealed a hesitant expression.

“You Dare? Zhan Hai mercenary group, if you dare to make a move, you’ll be making an enemy out of our amethyst mercenary group!”

Vice Commander Xiao looked over and coldly said.

“I will take care of the financial mercenary group for You!”

Yun Hanhai revealed a smile as he stared at vice commander Xiao and the others. “As long as one of you dares to protect that Brat, my young master’s mercenary group will kill anyone. I, Yun Hanhai, will definitely do what I say!”

Hearing his words, the faces of the amethyst mercenary group instantly turned ugly.

The young leader of the Zhan Hai mercenary group had a drastic change of expression as he looked at his companions.

“Alright, vice leader Yun, we will listen to your orders!”

In the end, the young man gritted his teeth and said loudly.

“Alright, don’t worry. I will definitely reward all of you in the future!”

Yun Hanhai revealed a smile and laughed out loud.

“Yes, yes, it’s vice-captain Yun!”

The group of young men nodded with smiles on their faces. They looked at Wang Xian who was behind the amethyst mercenary group with a hint of killing intent in their eyes.

“Kid, if you want to blame someone, blame yourself for offending the young master’s mercenary group and vice-captain Yun and the rest. You’re the one who’s courting death. You Can’t blame anyone else!”

As they spoke, they slowly walked towards Wang Xian.

The amethyst mercenary group stared at them coldly.

However, they were not afraid. Although the amethyst mercenary group was ranked higher than the young master’s mercenary group, the young master’s mercenary group was even more terrifying. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Between these two mercenary groups, they knew what to choose.

“Alright, Alright. Just you wait and see, Zhan Hai’s mercenary group!”

A girl stared at them angrily.

“Whoever dares to stop Zhan Hai’s friends will be killed!”

Yun Hanhai glanced at the girl and ordered the people beside him.

“Yes, vice leader!”

A dozen middle-aged men nodded heavily. They held their weapons and glared at the members of the amethyst mercenary group with killing intent.

They had no doubt that these people would attack them!

The members of the amethyst mercenary group, who were already severely injured, were no match for them.

This made the girls bite their lips tightly and stare at the Zhan Hai mercenary group with murderous intent.

The young men of the Zhan Hai mercenary group ignored them and walked towards Wang Xian, who was sitting cross-legged on the ground, with their weapons in hand.

“Deputy leader, what... What should we do?”

Qin Qing looked worried when she saw them walking towards Wang Xian. She asked anxiously.

Deputy leader Xiao was also extremely embarrassed. His expression kept changing.

“Hehe!”

A smile appeared on Yun Hanhai’s face. He stood there arrogantly and said loudly, “How dare you offend our young master’s mercenary group? Forget about the purple crystal, even if the tigerlion mercenary group wanted to protect him, they wouldn’t be able to do so!”

“Hurry up and make your move!”

He snorted coldly and the young men from the Zhan Hai mercenary group quickened their pace.

The faces of the amethyst mercenary group turned pale. They held their weapons tightly and were ready to make their move at any time.

“Phew, get out of the way!”

At this moment, Wang Xian opened his eyes slowly and said to the group of girls from the amethyst mercenary group in front of him.

“HMM? You’re awake!”

All the girls turned their heads immediately. When they saw Wang Xian standing up, they were pleasantly surprised.

“Student Wang, the injuries on your body...”

Qin Qing walked over hurriedly and wanted to reach out to help him up. However, when she saw that Wang Xian had already stood up, she said helplessly.

“It will take a few more days for you to recover. However, you can make your move now!”

While they were confronting each other, Wang Xian had already recovered a little of his energy.

He smiled and said again, “Get out of the way first. I’ll kill them first!”

The members of the amethyst mercenary group felt a chill in their hearts. One by one, the girls quickly made way for them.

“Kill us? Kid, are you out of your mind?”

When Yun Hanhai saw the members of the amethyst mercenary group making way for them, he raised his head slightly and said with a smile on his face

“The members of your young master’s mercenary group are really courting death!”

Wang Xian slowly picked up the lightning strike wood. There was a bluish-green glow on it as he gently placed it on the ground.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

“What?”

“If you dare to attack, kill him!”

When the lightning strike wood landed on the ground, numerous thorns that were accompanied by lightning instantly emerged from the ground and attacked the members of the young master’s mercenary group.

When Yun Hanhai saw that Wang Xian still dared to attack, his eyes were filled with killing intent.

“Ah!”

However, at this moment, a thorn pierced through the body of the middle-aged man who was a level 6 transcendent.

This stunned Yun Hanhai instantly.

“Ahhhhh!”

The screams of the level 6 transcendent were just the beginning. Later on, the members of the young master’s mercenary group were killed instantly without any strength to resist!

Yun Hanhai’s face was filled with shock. His body trembled and the armor on his body emitted a blazing flame!

Everyone in the young master’s mercenary group and the Zhan Hai mercenary group were stunned!
