2643 Auction House 26

“Wang Xian, sister bei Shuang, you guys can stay in this courtyard!”

The Immortal Crane brought them to a courtyard in the middle of the mountains, rivers, and grasslands. Di Xingnu said to Wang Xian and the rest with a smile on her face!

“Master, I won’t be staying here for the next few days. I have some matters to take care of!”

Bei Shuang looked at Wang Xian and said!

“Okay, go ahead. Let me know if there’s anything!”

Wang Xian looked at bei Shuang and nodded!

Bei Shuang obviously had her own matters to take care of when she came to the imperial court this time!

Wang Xian didn’t ask too much!

“Sister bei Shuang doesn’t live here!”

A hint of curiosity appeared on the Imperial Star Lady’s face!

Auntie Ying also told her that bei Shuang had some grudges with the previous Emperor of the imperial court!

And this time, she was obviously here to settle some grudges!

“Someone’s probably going to be unlucky!”

She thought!

Even though the emperor was stronger, especially the emperor from 30,000 years ago, who was at least undying emperor level now, he was obviously much weaker than bei Shuang!

According to the rules of the emperor, even if bei Shuang beat him up, he wouldn’t say anything!

Even if the disciples of the imperial court lost terribly, the imperial court wouldn’t interfere in the sparring matches of the same generation!

“Young master Wang Xian, thank you for taking care of Stargirl during this period of time. Come and taste the tea leaves that I personally planted!”

The woman at the side watched bei Shuang leave and said to Wang Xian with a smile! Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Yes, Aunty!”

Wang Xian nodded and followed her to a room at the side!

“Wang Xian, the competition of the current generation disciples of the imperial court will be held the day after tomorrow. You should rest here for the next two days!”

Di Xingnu whispered to Wang Xian!

“It’s two days later. That’s great. I have some matters to settle too!”

Wang Xian nodded his head with a smile!

“What matters?”

Di Xingnu glared at him and asked!

“I’m selling some things. There’s an auction in your imperial court. It would be best if it’s a large-scale auction!”

Wang Xian looked at her and said!

To come here and sell the soul-returning liquid was the most important thing. This was related to whether or not he could improve his strength!

“Of course there’s an auction. The biggest auction at the center of the imperial court is the imperial court auction house. I’ll Bring You There Tomorrow!”

Di Xing ‘er said to him!

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded his head!

“Young master Wang Xian, come and taste my river of forgetfulness tea!”

The Empress Star Lady’s mother quickly brought over a cup of tea and placed it beside Wang Xian!

“Thank you!”

Wang Xian thanked her politely and took the cup with both hands!

After that, Wang Xian chatted with the Empress Star Lady’s mother for a while before he came to the courtyard next to them!

“Star Lady, this young master Wang Xian is not bad. Cherish him well!”

The woman watched Wang Xian leave and said to Di Xing nu with a smile on her face!

“What? Mom, what are you talking about!”

Di Xing Nu’s face turned red and she lowered her head shyly!

“Hehe, he doesn’t look big and he’s strong. The young men of the imperial court can’t compare to the leader of a faction. Seize the opportunity!”

The woman continued to look at her and said!

“Mom, what nonsense are you talking about? How can it be between him and me? I have a good relationship with his girlfriend, and how can I like such a Playboy? Humph! Humph!”

The Imperial Star Lady Shook Her head and snorted!

“Good, good. Star Lady, you should think it over carefully. Your achievements today have made mom very proud!”

The woman patted her head and said proudly!

“Imperial court auction house!”

Wang Xian took out his artificial intelligence and did a search!

“The war is about to start. The imperial court auction house will be holding a huge auction. All powerhouses and Young Masters are welcome!”

When he was searching, a piece of information immediately appeared on the artificial intelligence!

...

“Eh? There will be a large-scale auction the day after Tomorrow!”

Wang Xian looked at the information on the AI and revealed a smile on his face!

“The competition for the current generation disciples of the imperial court will be held in two days’time. This auction might also be trying to attract the current generation youths of the imperial court before the competition!”

“Other than that, there will be the upcoming Abyss War. There should be a lot of treasures!”

Wang Xian mumbled to himself. However, he didn’t buy anything this time. The main reason was to sell the items!

He took out his AI and sent a message to Di Xingnu!

“Wang Xian, what’s the matter?”

An hour later, Di Xingnu walked over and asked him!

“Bring me to your imperial court auction. I want to auction some treasures!”

Wang Xian said directly to Di Xingnu!

“You Rascal, it seems like you came along with me on the way!”

...

She said unhappily!

“Why would I? I’m just selling some items along the way!”

Wang Xian smiled. He didn’t want to anger her on purpose!

“At least you still have some conscience. Let’s go. I’ll Bring You There!”

Di Xingnu smiled in satisfaction and brought Wang Xian out!

“Let’s ride on the Crane!”

After walking out of the courtyard, Di Xingnu touched the head of a crane and stood on it!

Wang Xian stood beside her!

“Let’s go to the Central Market!”

She patted the crane and said!

“Hualala!”

The crane flapped its wings and flew toward the direction of the palace!

The speed of the crane was not fast in Wang Xian’s eyes. In the surrounding starry sky, he could see people riding on various war pets, flying in extremely cool flying cars, riding on swords, and riding on clouds.

On this prosperous and huge island, it was like a Fairyland!

Not long after, an extremely lively market appeared in his sight. Wang Xian could see all kinds of shops!

Technological weapons, technological robots, technological equipment!

Array puppets, war pets, and God equipment!

There were all kinds of things!

Moreover, every shop had a powerful aura!

This was after all the Inner Island, an area that only undying and emperor disciples could enter!

“We’re here, let’s go down!”

Half an hour later, Emperor Star Lady pointed at a huge building below and said!

The building was like an ancient Roman Colosseum, however it looked incredibly sci-fi!

An auction that combined technology and training!

The entire auction house could accommodate at least a million people. They could land directly from the sky!

Wang Xian and celestial maiden flew down directly!

“Welcome to the imperial court auction house. Our auction will be held the day after tomorrow. Are you here to determine the location or to send in the items?”

A staff member walked over and asked politely after landing in a hall below the auction house!

“Send the items for auction!”

Wang Xian scanned his surroundings and said directly!

“TSK TSK, isn’t this the famous star goddess?”

All of a sudden, a voice came from behind!

Wang Xian was slightly stunned. Di Xingnu, who was standing at the side, had a grim expression!

“HMPH, what? You want my autograph? Hehe!”

Di Xingnu turned her head and looked at the few girls behind her as she said coldly!
