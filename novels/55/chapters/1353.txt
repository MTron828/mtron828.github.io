Chapter 1354: In the 1354 kingdom war

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

Strange rain began to fall from the sky within a five-kilometer radius.

Many sharp siege weapons that were more than ten meters long shot toward everyone in the Dragon Palace.

“Roar! Roar!”

The nine flood dragons looked at the four to five thousand sharp weapons with disdain in their eyes.

One of the flood dragons on the left slightly flapped its not very large wings, and streams of green wind light directly wrapped around the siege weapons.

Those siege weapons were instantly bound.

The flood dragon’s body shook once again, and huge arrows shot towards the direction of the attack.

“Activate the formation. All ranged attackers, cover them!”

One of the generals saw that the arrow was easily blocked by a flood dragon and his expression changed slightly. He hurriedly shouted.

“Weng!”

An earthen yellow city protection formation was activated. A powerful formation protected the entire imperial city.

“Kill them!”

“Kill them all!”

Within the city protection formation, the soldiers on the city walls roared loudly!

“Kill! Kill!”

Behind them, a million people from the imperial city of the one leaf continent roared loudly.

The word ‘kill’rushed into the clouds and shook the surrounding 100 kilometers.

“Ao Qitian, break through the city!”

Prime Minister Gui saw countless attacks of various attributes coming at them and said indifferently to the Demon War Department behind them.

“Yes, Roar!”

Ao Qitian’s 15-meter-large body roared loudly, and a golden ocean-pacifying needle appeared in his hand.

“Big!”

With a light roar, the ocean-pacifying needle in his hand became 1,000 meters long.

This was the ocean-pacifying needle in a level-four dragon palace, and it had consumed several tons of hollow-level materials.

The 1,000-meter-long and 10-meter-wide ocean-pacifying needle instantly stood between heaven and earth. Even ao Qitian looked tiny in front of the needle.

“Destroy the city!”

Ao qitian held the ocean-pacifying needle in his arms and smashed it toward the city wall.

“What? What is this thing?”

“What kind of weapon is this? Attack! Attack!”

When Ao Qitian held the thousand-meter-long ocean-pacifying needle and smashed it toward the city wall, everyone’s expressions changed.

Even one leaf king and the generals’expressions changed drastically.

“Crack! Crack! Crack!”

The ocean-pacifying needle landed, and the rank 2 defensive array shattered like glass.

“Get lost!”

A rank 3 void interpretation expert from the one leaf continent waved his arm, and a hundred-meter-long fist landed on the ocean-pacifying needle.

“Charge!”

Prime Minister Gui waved his arm!

“Kill!”

“Heavenly Lightning Destruction!”

“Dragon Scales, Arrows!”

“Heavenly Sword, demon vanquishing!”

With an order, Ao Qi raised his hammer-like arm and pointed at the sky.

Within the dark clouds, terrifying lightning bolts descended and attacked the city wall of the one leaf continent empire.

Mou Zesen pulled the bowstring to its maximum, and an arrow covered in dragon scales shot forward.

The arrow came to the city wall and exploded into sharp dragon scales.

Ao Jian held a golden longsword in his hand, and a two-thousand-meter long sword appeared out of thin air and charged forward.

Behind him, Demon Monkeys, thunder prawns, golden swords, and fish charged forward.

All the members of the Heavenly Eye Arrow Division floated in the sky, and their bows and arrows were aimed at the enemy.

“All the insightful emptiness realm experts, kill, kill them all for me!”

The one leaf king’s expression changed slightly when he saw the terrifying attacks unleashed by the members of the Dragon Palace one by one. He roared and immediately ordered.

“Kill!”

The city defense array had been broken, and the real battle was about to begin.

On the city wall, the insightful emptiness realm experts of the one leaf continent dynasty directly attacked the leaders of the Dragon Palace.

The old man next to the one leaf king fixed his gaze on Mou Zesen.

He could sense a force of the same level from his body.

The one leaf king did not move either. He stared at Wang Xian coldly.

“Tell me your name. I will kill you later!”

He stared at Wang Xian coldly. His eyes were filled with endless coldness.

“Hehe!”

When Wang Xian saw the king of one leaf staring at him coldly, a look of contempt appeared on his face.

He stood up slowly and looked at the king of one leaf. He said faintly, “You are not qualified!”

You are not qualified!

Wang Xian was not prepared to make a move in today’s battle. In fact, he did not even need to make a move.

“Arrogant, arrogant fellow!”

When the one leaf king heard Wang Xian’s words, his face turned extremely gloomy.

They said that he was not qualified? How dare they say that he was not qualified.

He was the king of a country. Among the surrounding dynasties, he was the strongest.

Now, he was completely ignored!

“Be careful, be careful of the rain in the sky and that voice. Be careful!”

“Ah Ah, his strength is not at level one of the Seethrough realm. He is at level two of the Seethrough Realm!”

“What a terrifying defense. Their strength is above the ninth level of the extraordinary realm. Those who are not strong enough will switch to long-range attacks. Do not engage in close combat!”

“Oh my God, a person beside him was killed for no reason. There are killers, there are killers!”

At this moment, screams suddenly came from the front of the city wall.

Panic. The war had already broken out, but in less than a minute, panicked roars came from the one leaf continent dynasty. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Over 10,000 soldiers rushed out of the city walls to meet the members of the Dragon Palace.

In an instant of collision, a profound void martial artist versus a profound void martial artist.

Transcendents versus transcendents.

However, when one by one, a profound void martial artist went up against a profound void martial artist of the Dragon Palace, they were caught off guard and were almost instantly killed.

Several profound void martial artists instantly joined forces to fight against one.

And those transcendent realm warriors were even more miserable!

More than a thousand warriors of the Dragon Palace, with the lowest combat strength being at the ninth rank of the transcendent realm, collided in an instant. Tens of thousands of soldiers, ten of them besieging one, also instantly killed several thousand people.

What made them even more terrified was that the black raindrops in the sky fell on their bodies and actually corroded their spiritual qi.

Some of the weaker ones even died directly under the black rain.

There were also those special sound wave attacks that disturbed their minds.

“Surround and Attack!”

“Thousand leaves battle team, Charge!”

“All the experts of the families in the city, charge out and kill the enemy!”

Seeing that the soldiers and generals who charged out had instantly suffered a great loss, the one leaf king’s expression changed slightly as he ordered in a low voice.

“Boom Boom Boom!”

Behind them, battle teams riding on fierce beasts and Demon Beasts charged out to meet the experts of the Dragon Palace.

The eyes of some experts of families and powerful mercenary groups in the Imperial City of the one leaf continent flickered when they heard the king’s order.

“Charge! The enemy only has more than a thousand people. No matter how strong they are, we can kill them with numbers!”

“Kill! One person and one attack can kill them all!”

The powerful battle teams of the one leaf continent rushed out, and the powerful families in the imperial city also rushed out.

In an instant, a few more insightful void martial artists and more than 100,000 martial artists joined the battle.

The total number of people was tens of times, or even tens of times, or even hundreds of times more!

“Nine flood dragons, Attack!”

“Ao Yao, let’s Move!”

Wang Xian saw more than 100,000 people rushing out directly and said directly with a calm expression.
