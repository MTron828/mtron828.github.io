Chapter 656: Get Out Of The Territory Of China (2)

The current Underworld was too weak. Ever since the various Sacred Sects and clans were annihilated by Dragon Sect, their strength was weakened by more than half as compared to before.

At present, there were no orthodox sects or Diabolism, as the two leaders were dead.

The Underworld was back to their peaceful days. After the catastrophe of Dragon Sect annihilating most of the Underworld’s clans and sects, the remaining Martial Artists lived in peace together.

Even in the face of international factions, they had come together to fend off their common enemies.

However, the difference between both parties was too huge. The international factions were totally overkilling!

However, all the local Martial Artists were unwilling to leave this place and give up this golden opportunity.

“Sui Huang, Old Xiao, did you two inform Dragon King? What’s his reply?” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

A Sect Leader from a first-class force could not help but ask Sui Huang and Xiao Quanshan in the middle.

As soon as he finished his question, the surroundings were plunged into silence.

Dragon King had become the unspeakable person of the entire Underworld after he annihilated so many people, dealing a massive blow to the Underworld.

They had reverence and fear for the Dragon King and Dragon Sect.

“I contacted him two days ago. He said he’ll come as soon as possible!”

Sui Huang looked at the surrounding crowd and spoke in a low voice.

“I guess even the Dragon King is no match for them!”

An Inborn Expert sighed as he spoke with a complicated look.

The Dragon King was indeed compelling, and Dragon Sect was invincible in the Underworld.

But when they spun around and looked at the dozens of peaks at the side, they had only fear in their eyes.

More than a dozen mountains around them were shaved in half. They could not help but quiver at the sight of the horrifying scene.

That was what happened after experts from two international factions fought.

Back then, there were eight experts in combat. The sky was darkened. The whole world lost its color while the mountain peaks broke in half with a slash from the experts.

They used to think that the imposing aura displayed by the four elders in the pictures posted on the forum was stunning enough. However, that battle was even more ghastly to them.

Looking at the pictures and witnessing with their own eyes were two different things.

When they sensed the mightiness, they almost went down on their knees.

“Yes, those four elders were on par with them. However, there are about thirteen such people on their side. From what I heard, they aren’t the most powerful ones in the group.”

Another Inborn Expert nodded in agreement. This bunch of international factions who occupied their blessed ground by force was much stronger than they had imagined.

They were multiple times more powerful than the Underworld before the massacre.

“Those above Dan Realm are known as Budding Realm. The group of people who fought two days ago were all Budding Realm experts. The powerful experts that they mentioned are not here. They have been intercepted and stopped by the Guardian Divine Beasts of China,” said Xiao Quanshan slowly.

The Underworld might be weak, but relics were often discovered at this place. To all the factions in Asia, the Underworld was an excellent treasure ground.

However, their entry to the Underworld was restricted by the presence of Guardian Divine Beasts all the while.

Without the Guardian Divine Beasts, the Underworld would belong to other factions of the world.

Even so, the top forces of Asia had not stopped sending their experts over!

Even though the most supreme-class experts were not here, the entire Underworld could still not put up a resistance.

“Does that mean that nothing can be done even if Dragon King were here?” a middle-aged man could not help but ask.

“Perhaps, we can claim back one mountain. But apparently, it has nothing to do with us!” a Dan Realm expert from Reeds Spirits replied in a stern voice.

Everyone was dejected by his words and their faces formed dreadful expressions.

In their opinion, Dragon Sect’s strength was at most equivalent to six flaming elders.

Six of them were already terrifying!

But compared to those experts occupying the mountains here, it was still far off from them.

Boom!

At this time, a horrible-looking palm was coming their way.

The palm was a hundred meters in size, exuding a daunting yellow glow.

It swept directly in their location.

“Oh no, get out of the way now!”

Seeing the incoming palm, Sui Huang was aghast as he hurriedly screamed.

Thousands of people had a change in their expressions as they quickly dodged to the side.

Ah!

However, there were hundreds of people who did not manage to escape from the gigantic palm and were smashed into flat meat.

“Haha, I advanced! I advanced! Awesome!”

At this time, an old man from Mt. Taibai let out hysterical laughter as he exclaimed. His voice traveled over ten kilometers.

“He actually...”

The group of Martial Artists from the Underworld grimaced upon hearing his untamed laughter. Their eyes were filled with trepidation when they saw the hundred-meter palm mark and the blood on the ground.

Just a casual swing and a palm of a hundred meters landed beside them. From their perspective, this daunting strength was like the work of an immortal!

“Trashy Martial Artists from China, get lost now!”

The arrogant voice from the old man was heard again while another hundred-meter palm came sweeping in from two thousand meters away.

“Run!” Sui Huang shouted out as he ran to the foot of the mountain swiftly.

“Haha, poor doggies. Useless bunch of sickening dogs, stay out of our way. Otherwise, we’ll kill you anytime!”

Seeing them scampering off, the old man on the mountain let out a burst of arrogant laughter.

His excitement could not be contained after he leveled up in his cultivation.

“They actually drove us out!”

Having been chased out from their own land, the bunch of Martial Artists in the Underworld were extremely embarrassed.

“Let’s go over there!”

Suddenly, hundreds of members from the first-class force in the Underworld stopped. They exchanged a look before they headed to one of the mountains.

“Song Qingtian, what are you guys doing?”

“Song Family, have you all become the lackeys of the overseas factions?”

Just then, the hundred people heard raging voices yelling at them.

“We just want the Song Family to grow stronger. What’s wrong with that? If we can cultivate under the Spiritual Energy for a while, it’s possible for all of us to become Inborn Experts!”

An old man turned his head and spoke with a stern look.

“So, this is the reason for being a lackey?”

An Inborn Expert returned a dreadful look.

“The entire Underworld has fallen into such a state. What more do you want?”

The old man scoffed at the remaining crowd and walked off.

Becoming a lackey of Asia’s factions would earn the right to cultivate at the foot of the mountains.

That was the condition of the overseas factions.

China had too many relics, and the Immortals would not dare to set foot here because of the Guardian Divine Beasts.

However, the international factions were setting the Chinese up. They intended to recruit some Chinese Martial Artists as their subordinates to gain better control of the Underworld.

It seemed like the strategy was working!
