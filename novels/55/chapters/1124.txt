“What Wind Eye Illusionary Arrow?”

Xing Guang heard Tian Yue Xing Hua’s words and frowned as he looked at him.

“You still remember...”

Tian Yue Xing hua recalled as a hint of shock flashed in his eyes.

Just as he was speaking, the elder from the Wind Eye clan looked ahead with a calm expression.

“Let them witness our wind eye clan’s new divine ability and let them know that the wind eye illusion Arrow has returned!”

As the elder spoke, he slowly drew the longbow in his hand. There was nostalgia, coldness, and a trace of killing intent.

“Yes!”

All the members of the Wind Eye clan nodded, their eyes revealing a cold green light.

“Wind Eye Illusion Arrow, Wind Dragon!”

“Wind eye illusionary arrow, Wind Dragon!”

The old man shouted, and all the members of the two rows shouted.

Wind Eye illusionary arrow, Wind Dragon, was the first divine ability they had comprehended after possessing the Divine Dragon Bloodline.

It was also the most powerful divine ability they had mastered.

“Attack!”

More than 300 members of the Wind Eye clan lined up neatly, their bodies emitting a dense green light.

“Roar!”

The moment the bow was fully drawn, a dragon’s roar was heard from above.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

The moment it was released, an inviolable pressure was emitted from the arrow. This pressure carried traces of pressure.

“Not good!”

Just as he was introducing the wind eye illusion Arrow to Xing Guang Hun, he heard the roar and hurriedly looked over. A frightened expression appeared on his face as he hurriedly looked down.

He moved and wanted to attack, but at this moment, cold sweat appeared on his forehead.

He looked over and found that the Maozesen Arrow was aimed at him.

On his bow, a one-meter-long wind dragon was circling above it, as if it could launch a fatal attack at any time.

Tian Yue Xing Hua’s pupils contracted slightly, and he quickly shouted to the group of Tian Yue soul chasers below, “Hurry up and Dodge!”

“Eh?”

The Tian Yue Soul Chasers who had their bowstrings fully drawn were already prepared to face the Wind Eye clan’s incoming arrows. They were momentarily stunned!

“Attack!”

At this moment, Yu Chengzi, who held a feather fan in his hand, swept his gaze across the Wind Eye clan. When he saw this situation, he directly said.

“Haha, Kill!”

Mang Hong heard Yu Chengzi’s words and roared loudly. His entire person was like a prehistoric ferocious beast as he directly attacked Xing Guang Hun.

Yan Wenshan, who was at the side, slightly moved the red staff in his hand. A terrifying chain directly attacked the vice commander of the Star Moon Army.

A battle at the profound void tier was about to erupt at any moment.

“Boom!”

In an instant, a terrifying explosion sound came from the sky.

The vice sect master and elders of the Heavenly Moon sect did not have the time to bother about the Heavenly Moon Soul Chaser below. They hurriedly faced the battle.

“HMPH, break for me!”

One of the elders of the Heavenly Moon Soul Chaser snorted coldly when he saw the Green Arrow coming at them. The arrow in his hand directly shot out.

“Bang!”

The specially made metal arrow, which was accompanied by the sharpness of various attributes, collided with the green attribute arrow, producing an intense sound.

“Roar!”

However, just when everyone of the Heavenly Moon Soul Chaser thought that they could easily cancel out the arrows of the members of the Wind Eye clan, a roar suddenly came from the Green Arrow.

The ordinary arrow directly turned into a terrifying dragon head. The three to four meter long dragon head directly attacked Tian Yue Soul Chaser.

“What?”

When Tian Yue Soul Chaser and the others saw this scene, their faces revealed a shocked expression.

“Dodge, quickly Dodge!”

The old man in the middle hurriedly shouted with a face full of fear.

Everyone from Tian Yue Soul Chaser hurriedly dodged to the side.

Their speed was incomparably fast. As archers who specialized in long-range attacks, their close combat strength was very poor. However, their speed had always been something that they were proud of!

“Roar Roar!”

However, what caused them to be frightened was that the enormous dragon head suddenly opened its eyes. Its green eyes seemed to have come to life completely.

The dragon head followed their bodies and chased after them at an even faster speed.

“What?”

This time, everyone from the Heavenly Moon Chasing Soul clan had terrified expressions on their faces. Even the half-step-to profound void martial experts were shocked.

They glanced at the people from the Wind Eye clan in the distance and were shocked to find that their eyes were glowing.

Their eyes were controlling the attack through the eyes of the dragon head.

“What Kind of Demonic Beast Race Is This?”

Everyone’s faces were filled with shock.

“Roar!”

“Ah!”

Right at this moment, a scream came from the side of their ears.

“Ah Ah Ah!”

Following that, the screams continued without end.

“What?”

At the center of the battlefield, the Star Moon Army’s soldiers looked over, their faces filled with shock.

Just Now, that demonic beast race had killed thousands of their comrades with one arrow. Now, they were actually separated by more than 3,000 meters, directly killing the experts of the Skymoon Soul Chaser.

That was the Heavenly Moon Soul Chaser. The threat of the Heavenly Moon Soul Chaser had even caused their star moon army to be extremely fearful.

Especially that archery technique, it was impossible to guard against!

“That’s right, it’s definitely a wind eye illusion arrow. Wherever the arrow reaches, there will be a myriad of changes. Killing is the first priority!”

The Heavenly Moon Starlight’s gaze swept downwards as he roared loudly.

The first sentence, where the gaze reaches, the arrow will reach!

This was the most powerful aspect of the Wind Eye clan. They could use their eyes to control the arrow. As long as it was within their sight, the arrow would be able to attack.

As for the second sentence, there were countless variations, killing first!

This was another terrifying aspect of the Wind Eye clan. They were able to transform the arrow that they attacked into other forms. They could defend and attack, but killing the enemy first was the priority.

Miserable screams rang out one after another.

Soon, half of the 500 Heavenly Moon Soul Pursuers were killed.

This caused the Heavenly Moon Soul Pursuers who had dodged this disaster to be filled with fear.

“F * ck, they’re so strong! They’re so strong!”

“Heavens, what is this? The Arrows can transform into a fierce beast and can be controlled at will!” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Haha, it’s Too Powerful. With them around, we will definitely win this battle!”

In Dragon and Phoenix city, when the crowd saw this scene, their faces revealed a shocked expression.

Although they didn’t see many people die from the distance, they could clearly hear the miserable screams.

Their gazes looked towards the wind eye clan that was lined up in the sky, and their eyes were filled with shock.

“Whoosh!”

At this moment, Mou Zesen’s eyes were filled with fighting spirit. He pointed with his arm and shot an arrow at Lei Feihu.

Lei Feihu, who was besieging Yu Chengzi with the deputy commander of the Star Moon Army, felt the sharpness of the arrow. His expression changed drastically and he quickly dodged to the side!
