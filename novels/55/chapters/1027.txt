Translator: 5496903

“Young master Wang, Young Master Wang!”

Just as Wang Xian was walking towards the life and Death Elixir store, an anxious voice sounded.

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows when he heard the voice and looked over.

He paused on the young man who was walking over from behind and revealed a mocking expression on his face.

When the young man saw Wang Xian looking at him, his face turned gloomy and he glared at him without showing any signs of weakness.

However, soon, the middle-aged man beside him looked over with a frown.

The young man immediately lowered his head.

“Young master Wang, what happened the day before yesterday was our fault. We apologize. How can you forgive us? We will try our best to make it up to you!”

Supervisor Yi walked over and said apologetically to Wang Xian.

Wang Xian looked at supervisor Yi who was full of sincerity and nodded.

Supervisor Yi and the shopkeeper saw his expression and were delighted. “Young master Wang, you are our distinguished guest. It was our fault last time. Tell me, as long as...”

“Alright, Supervisor Yi, this is not your fault. It’s his fault!”

Wang Xian interrupted supervisor Yi and pointed at the young man.

“He is also a member of Fengxian. If you want me to forgive him, it’s simple. Make him kneel here. However, this time, it’s different from what I said last time. He needs to kneel for five minutes!” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Wang Xian revealed a smile.

His words caused manager Yi and manager Yi’s expressions to change slightly. Meanwhile, the young man revealed an even more furious expression. “Don’t even think about it. Do you think you are...”

“Shut up!”

The middle-aged man interrupted him coldly and looked at Wang Xian, he took a deep breath and said, “Young master, change your condition. You are our distinguished guest. What happened the day before yesterday was our fault. We are willing to compensate you. Pills, weapons, you name it!”

“Yes, level seven pills and level seven weapons. As long as you can forgive us and continue to work with us, we will agree unconditionally!”

A woman at the side immediately said to Wang Xian.

Wang Xian looked at the two of them and smiled. “Do you know why I have been helping you, Fengxian?”

“It’s because Fengxian has a friend of mine, a very good friend!”

“However, this doesn’t mean that any random person from Fengxian can chase me away?”

“Do I lack spirit stones? Do I lack a seventh-grade elixir and weapon?”

As Wang Xian spoke, he looked at them mockingly.

This made them feel a little embarrassed. The young man stared at Wang Xian furiously.

Do I lack spirit stones?

How Rich is he to dare to say such words? F * ck, even they didn’t dare to say such words.

One had to know that the four of them were experts at transcendent level nine.

“Arrogant fellow, our Feng Xian’s higher-ups have personally apologized to you. You even dared to be so arrogant. Do you really think that we, Feng Xian, can not continue the business after losing a guest like you?”

The young man gritted his teeth and spoke to Wang Xian.

This time, the middle-aged man didn’t interrupt him.

This was because they could tell that unless the source of fire knelt down and apologized, the other party wouldn’t forgive them.

Asking the source of fire to apologize was like slapping his own face!

“What’s wrong? What’s wrong? Why did your Feng Xian’s people come to our shop to invite customers?”

At this moment, a sharp voice was heard.

Everyone looked in the direction of the voice and saw a woman walking over. There were three to four people following beside the woman.

The woman swayed her body and scanned manager Yi and manager Yi with her sharp eyes.

“It’s not to the extent that we can’t open the shop. However, you will suffer a lot of losses!”

Wang Xian looked at the young man with a smile and said with a smile.

When the shopkeeper of the life and Death Elixir Workshop heard Wang Xian’s words, his eyes lit up. “It seems that young master is dissatisfied with the Fengxian Elixir and Weapons Workshop!”

Wang Xian smiled faintly at the woman. He raised his leg and was about to walk towards the life and Death Elixir Workshop.

“A lot of losses? HMPH, do you think you have the right to make our Fengxian Elixir and weapons workshop suffer losses?”

The young man growled at Wang Xian with an embarrassed expression. Looking at Wang Xian’s expression and hearing his words, he really couldn’t take it anymore!

Even the middle-aged men at the side didn’t look too good.

They were from the fire Lark clan. They might not be famous in the fire Lark clan, but they still had some weight.

Now, they came to beg a kid, yet they were being treated with such disrespect. This made them feel uncomfortable.

“Hehe, is that so?”

Wang Xian smiled. He looked at the shopkeeper of the life and death elixir workshop and asked, “If I buy pills from you for 100 million middle-grade spirit stones, will you give me a discount?”

“HMM? Of course I will. If you give me 100 million, I will give you a 10% discount. If you buy too much, I will give you a discount. How about it, young master? Our Life and Death Elixir workshop is definitely not something that Feng Xian can compare to, especially in terms of service!”

The woman had been listening to their conversation from the side. She had already gained some insight.

Obviously, this young man in front of them was definitely a big customer of Fengxian in the past. Otherwise, they would not have come over personally to apologize.

And the reason for everything was that the young man had offended him.

That was why this young man had fallen out with them!

When an old man standing beside the woman saw this scene, he also narrowed his eyes and rubbed his hands. His face was filled with excitement.

This was a gift from Feng Xian to them!

“Here!”

Wang Xian threw an interspatial ring in his hand directly to the old man who was rubbing his hands. “The discount can not be lower than 20% !”

The old man was slightly stunned. He immediately took out the interspatial ring and said, “If it’s 20% , it might be...”

However, when he saw the spirit stones in the interspatial ring, he stopped before he could finish his sentence.

His hands couldn’t help but tremble, and a shocked expression appeared on his face.

“20... 20% discount... can... can...”

His face flushed red as he asked excitedly.

“How many Spirit Stones?”

The woman manager’s expression changed slightly, and she stared at the old man as she hurriedly asked.

“At least 800 million middle-grade spirit stones. Young... young master... how many middle-grade spirit stones are there... Here?”

The old man’s face was filled with excitement and his voice was trembling slightly.

This was the first time he had seen so many spirit stones. The huge interspatial ring that was more than 100 square meters was almost filled up.

“What?”

The sharp voice of the lady manager rang out.

“One billion middle-grade spirit stones. I want all the elixirs that can improve my cultivation. I hope that your life and Death Elixir Workshop can prepare them for me as soon as possible!”

Wang Xian said calmly from the side.

“Alright, Alright. Alright, Young Master. We will definitely prepare as soon as possible. Definitely!”

The woman snatched the interspatial ring hurriedly. When she saw the middle-grade spirit stones inside, she was so excited that her face was flushed red as she shouted loudly.

“One billion!”

When manager Yi and manager Yi heard this number, their vision turned black.

One billion! That was a total of one billion middle-grade spirit stones!

How much could they earn this time?

The young man’s face froze, and even the four middle-aged men were shocked.

Dumbfounded!
