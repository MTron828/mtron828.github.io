3468 3467 to offer sacrifices and destroy a city

Did they really think that the hundred cities alliance could be easily destroyed by the Dragon Palace?

Did they really think that they could completely disregard the Dragon Palace?

Now, they really thought so.

They casually destroyed more than half of Haotian City to intimidate the other neutral races and not allow the disciples of the Dragon Palace to enter.

He didn’t care about the dragon palace at all.

Perhaps they had done so much to deal with some people with the Divine Dragon Bloodline.

Wang Xian’s eyes were filled with intense killing intent. He flew out quickly.

Information was being transmitted to him from the eight-limbed demonic fiend.

Wang Xian wasn’t sure if scholar Fang of Haotian City was dead or not.

However, based on the situation in Haotian City, at least a few million innocent people had died because of the Dragon Palace!

As the members of the Dragon Palace were located in Heavenly City, the Hundred Cities Alliance had directly destroyed more than half of the city and destroyed the members of the Dragon Palace.

They did not have any scruples at all.

Perhaps, it was also because heavenly city was too weak.

Compared to the Hundred Cities Alliance, Heavenly City was easily crushed to death.

“Phew, since you have destroyed more than half of heavenly city, I will destroy a city of Your Hundred Cities Alliance and make you pay the price!”

Wang Xian’s heart was filled with killing intent.

Last time, even if they were the ones who destroyed great Marquis City of Tianheng City, they did not harm the ordinary citizens.

They merely destroyed the strong ones of the other party.

However, the Hundred Cities Alliance did not care at all. More than half of the people of Haotian City were directly destroyed.

In that case, Wang Xian had nothing to worry about!

In his plan, he only needed to wait for the eight-limbed demonic fiend and the others to slowly corrode the interior of the Hundred Cities Alliance’s cities.

They could destroy two to three cities in a few years. How long could the hundred-city alliance last?

They could not hold on for long at all.

However, more than half of heavenly city had been destroyed. Fang Wensheng’s life and death were unknown. This had thoroughly infuriated him.

Since he wanted to kill them, he would kill them!

Let’s see if you can still be so arrogant.

Whoosh

Five days later, Wang Xian entered the city. He opened the message sent by the eight-limbed demonic fiend.

The eight-limbed demonic fiend was now living with a top-tier universe knight in a city.

The eight-limbed demonic fiend was located in star Old City of the hundred-city alliance, and the Demonic Fiend was located in Tianyi City of the hundred-city Alliance!

Star Old City was mainly inhabited by a type of demon beast. They were called Star Old Demon Beasts.

They were bloodthirsty and had a strong desire to kill. They could be ranked in the top 15 in the hundred-city alliance.

Old Star City had three masters of the universe with level one combat strength.

The reason why the Ba Qi chose this city was because the entire population of this race was soldiers. This was because their race had many bounty hunters.

Wang Xian arrived at Old Star City very quickly through the teleportation formation.

A murderous and bloodthirsty aura was emitted. Wang Xian scanned his surroundings.

This was a blood-red world. The buildings on the ground were all blood-red in color.

Even the clouds in the sky were blood-red in color.

The entire city was huge. There were experts and disciples from various races in the city.

Naturally, there were quite a number of humans.

Many dark attribute cultivators would cultivate here.

Wang Xian walked out of the teleportation formation and headed straight for the center of the city.

On the other hand, Ba Qi was already making preparations.

Half an hour later, he arrived at the front of the city Lord’s mansion.

At the entrance of the city Lord’s mansion in Old Star City was the skull of an incomparably huge beast.

This skull was at least a hundred thousand meters in size. From Afar, it looked majestic and exuded a powerful pressure.

The skull at the entrance of the city Lord’s mansion belonged to a level one battle-strength desolate beast, a universe ruler.

“Dragon King, Star Old City’s grotto-heaven blessed land is inside. However, the three level 1 universe rulers in Star Old City are there. We haven’t received any news yet. Their grotto-heaven blessed land is defensive.”

Ba Qi walked out. At this moment, he was parasitizing a great being in star Old City. He had a lot of power and knew a lot of things.

“Alright, send someone to shut down the teleportation formation now. We will attack immediately!”

Wang Xian said with a face full of killing intent.

“It’s the Dragon King. In front of us is the location of an army from Old Star City. These are the elites of Old Star City.”

As Ba Qi spoke, he slowly disappeared and left. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

He did not participate in the following battle.

With Wang Xian’s strength alone, he could destroy an entire city.

“Boom!”

The moment the octahedron disappeared, Wang Xian took action and flew towards the sky in front of him.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

“True Dragon Body!”

“Mighty Heavenly Dragon!”

“Divine Dragon playing with Pearl!”

“Ghost Clone!”

“Destroy!”

At this moment, Wang Xian instantly arrived at the sky above the city Lord’s mansion. He rapidly transformed into a dark dragon with terrifying energy.

It was the strongest attack form of the law, the clone of the Netherworld Ghost. Other than the five elemental grindstone, which he did not use, this was Wang Xian’s strongest attack.

In an instant, the entire space was covered by the terrifying dragon’s might!

That terrifying energy swept across the surroundings.

Ring ring ring

When Wang Xian’s energy rose, the defense formation of Old Star City was activated automatically.

The entire Old Star City was on high alert.

Two old star demonic beasts immediately opened their eyes at the bottom of the city Lord’s mansion.

Their bodies were blood-red in color. They were about the size of a human and had sharp arms.

They raised their heads and revealed a hint of fear in their eyes.

“This is the power of a level two master of the Universe!”

They let out a low growl and a surge of energy gushed into the area below.

They were going to activate the defense of the grotto-heaven blessed land!

“Oh no, someone is attacking our old Star City!”

“What a terrifying power. We are done for!”

At this moment, all the experts who were in the area where Wang Xian’s attack was coming from raised their heads and roared in horror.

Boom

The next moment, the terrifying energy landed on the ground. The entire Old Star City seemed to be trembling violently!

Whoosh

Wang Xian transformed into the back of the Dragon of darkness. The incipient Saint Wings appeared and flew towards the surroundings.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

He opened his dragon mouth and countless flames of obliteration descended.

“It’s the Divine Dragon! There’s a divine dragon attacking our old Star City!”

“Run! Run! Run!”

The sudden attack caught all the experts of old Star City unprepared. All of them roared crazily.

Their figures started to turn illusory as they tried to escape!

Boom

However, the experts and disciples of Old Star City within a radius of a few billion kilometers from Wang Xian could not escape at all.

When the extinguished flames fell, all of them died.

No one in Old Star City could withstand Wang Xian’s attack.

Roar

He roared crazily and came to another place. The extinguished flames were destroying everything.

At this moment, Wang Xian seemed to have transformed into a world-destroying divine dragon. He was mercilessly attacking and slaughtering.

“You are courting death. You actually dared to kill the disciples and citizens of Old Star City. Our Hundred Cities Alliance will not let you off!”

At the city Lord’s mansion, the defenses of the grotto-heaven blessed land were activated. A Level 1 universe dominator with combat strength flew out from Old Star City. When he saw what was happening outside, his expression changed drastically as he roared in horror.
