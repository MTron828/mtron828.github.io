“Boss, prepare to receive guests.”

“With my current speed, I’ll reach my destination in 20 minutes and 21 seconds.”

“90 degrees to the right, 80 million km, there’s a team, 2,500 people.”

“90 degrees to the left, 80 million km, there’s a team, 2,500 people.”

“150 million km to the right, there’s a team, 2,500 people.”

“All Undying Level 9 warriors lead the team, take care of them.”

In front of the Abyss, the group of warriors flew along the edge of the abyss. At the very front, an elder sent a message with a relaxed expression.

“Sky Array, this is the message.”

At the same time, at the front, Ba Qi looked at the message on the AI, smiling as he passed it to the sky array.

“Alright.”

The sky array looked at the information and nodded. He immediately went forward and prepared to set up the array.

With the other party’s precise location, it was easy for him to set up the array.

Especially since the other party didn’t have an undying pinnacle warrior, it wasn’t easy to find out about the array he set up.

Also, the most important thing was that the venomous dragon, elder Tian Ya led the way, the other elders instinctively lowered their guard.

In that case, it would be easier to capture all of them in one go.

“The setup has been completed. As long as your information is not too far off, we can capture all of them in one go.”

Six minutes later, the Heaven Formation flew over and reported to Wang Xian.

“Ao Qitian, Ao Jian, Ao Yao, go hide in the formation over there.”

Wang Xian said to Ao Qitian and the rest.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Everyone nodded immediately.

“I have to say that the poisonous horned dragon is too sinister and terrifying.”

At the side, Tian Cheng’s eyes flickered as he spoke.

He was also filled with fear towards such a dragon. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

This was because he didn’t know if the person closest to him had been parasitized.

“Keke, old man Tian Cheng, if you are a little more polite to me, it will be enough for you to hand over your revenge to our poison making department in the future. I guarantee that they will perish in fear.”

“If you acknowledge me and Mo Sha as your boss, Jie Jie, we will protect you in the future.”

Eight points said with a smile from the side.

Tian Chen glanced at him but did not say anything.

He thought back to the time when he, the void God Emperor, died because of his disciple’s betrayal.

He, a god Emperor, could not escape the plot of his own family.

How could the current world margin great sect escape the plot of eight points and the others.

It was a piece of cake to destroy a sect.

“Dragon King, they are about to arrive. Let’s hide first.”

At this moment, Ba Qi’s voice rang out.

Wang Xian and the rest immediately went to the concealment array at the side and looked ahead quietly.

They were waiting for Yu’er to arrive.

“Elder an, we have already flown for ten hours. There aren’t many people around. Should we continue?”

The people of the world margin sect had been flying for about ten hours. An elder on the right looked around and couldn’t help but ask the elder of the world margin sect.

“We’ll fly for another ten hours or so. If there’s no news, we’ll go back.”

Elder an said.

The elder didn’t say anything and continued to look around.

“Elder, I say we don’t need to look for it. So many of our disciples disappeared at the same time. It’s very likely that the Dragon Palace did it. We can just kill them directly. Do you really think that the world margin sect is afraid of them?”

A deacon said to the elder beside him from the right rear, his face full of anger.

“We still have to figure things out. You have to understand that if we fight directly, at least half of the godly king experts of our world margin sect will die. This is not what our world margin sect wants to see.”

“But the people of our world margin sect are not cowards. If it was really done by the Dragon Palace, then we have to make them pay the price even at the cost of heavy losses.”

The world margin elder said indifferently.

In their hearts, their elders and even the sect master did not want to fight to the death with the Dragon Palace because the losses would be too great.

They might even fall.

However, they also had a bottom line.

If the Dragon Palace really did this and had been secretly assassinating their experts, they wouldn’t be afraid. They would just die slowly.

They might as well fight to the death.

This was also the reason why five or six thousand experts from the world margin were missing. They wanted to find out the result.

...

There was really no need. They didn’t want to fight to the death with the Dragon Palace even though they knew the losses would be too great.

“Let me say it. We’ll fight with them. At most, we’ll die. Who’s Afraid of Who?”

The deacon next to them was a loyal disciple of the world margin sect. He said with a murderous look on his face.

“It’s going to take a long time. In the future, the Dragon Palace will be destroyed by us.”

The elder also said with a cold look on his face.

“Destroy Our Dragon Palace? Hehe, with just you?”

However, at this moment, an extremely cold voice suddenly sounded.

“Buzz!”

The next moment, a strange space appeared around them.

“This is...”

The sudden voice suddenly changed.

...

When they saw the familiar strange space around them, the expressions of everyone from the horizon great sect changed.

“It’s the Dragon Palace! It’s the Dragon Palace!”

A fierce roar came from a deacon’s mouth.

Rumble

However at this time, a vast and unstoppable attack attacked them.

The world margin sect elder felt the terrifying pressure and his expression changed.

“Not good, we’ve been ambushed by the Dragon Palace, there’s an undying Pinnacle Warrior.”

He shouted in shock.

They had actually been ambushed!

There was an array trap here!

However, they had just been scouted by an elder.

Logically speaking, at such a close distance, even an undying pinnacle warrior’s array should be able to sense it.

After all, the distance was too close, 10 million km was only a short distance to a warrior like them.

Rumble

They didn’t have time to think, the destructive energy landed on their bodies.

“No!”

Elder Tianya’s face was filled with horror as he roared in fear.

“It’s really the Dragon Palace! It’s really the Dragon Palace! Ah, I’ll fight it out with you!”

The Deacon’s eyes were bloodshot as he roared furiously.

However, in the face of absolute power, they had no way of resisting.

The more than two thousand godly monarch experts behind them were instantly killed the moment the nomological energy struck them.

They were powerless to resist.

“Dragon King, our world margin great sect will not let you off!”

The elder’s body slowly collapsed as he let out a final cry of despair.

His life force slowly dissipated.

“Ah!”

The deacon beside him also let out a cry of despair.

However, just as his life force was about to dissipate, a red light suddenly flew out of his body.

The next moment, the red light strangely disappeared directly.

“Eh?”

At this moment, ao Qitian’s surprised voice came from the side. He frowned slightly.

“Dragon King, something seems to have happened.”

He glanced around, broke the array, and said to the outside with a frown.
