Chapter 1364: 1364. Under the siege of the Three Kingdoms

Three confident and cold voices came from the mouths of three fourth-rank void interpretation experts.

Two of them were the kings of the dynasty.

Their voices were filled with disdain and disdain.

The Three Kingdoms joining forces to fight against the dragon-phoenix dynasty did have the qualifications.

“You want to destroy us? Do you really think that the dragon-phoenix dynasty is easy to bully?”

Feng Luan heard their arrogant words and looked at them coldly.

“Haha, if you can ally with the Dongyuan dynasty, we will have to consider if we want to deal with you, but now...”

The star-moon king looked at the experts of the dragon-phoenix dynasty on the city wall with a smile. “Now, it won’t be long before the Dongyuan Dynasty’s army comes to destroy you!”

“However, there’s no need to wait for the Dongyuan Empire to arrive. We’ll destroy you all very soon, Haha!”

He laughed loudly, and a ferocious expression slowly appeared on his face.

The sudden rise of the dragon-phoenix Empire had long caused the star Moon Empire to be apprehensive for a long time.

Especially the rapid development of the dragon-phoenix Empire in the past year, which finally caused the star Moon Empire to be unable to sit still.

In just a short year’s time, this empire had increased from the initial five void interpretation experts to fourteen to fifteen now. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

The speed of its development was too terrifying.

This caused the star Moon dynasty to have no choice but to ally with the Wind Howl dynasty and the Southern Cloud dynasty to destroy it.

The Wind Howl dynasty and the Southern Cloud dynasty were also very concerned about the dragon-phoenix dynasty. After all, a sudden rise in power would definitely threaten their surroundings in the future.

After the star Moon dynasty promised some benefits, the Three Kingdoms Allied and directly attacked.

The Alliance of the three countries made them not put the dragon and Phoenix dynasty in their eyes at all.

This was especially true after they heard that the Dongyuan dynasty had turned against them.

However, they needed to quickly destroy the dragon and Phoenix dynasty to prevent the Dongyuan dynasty from sharing the spoils of war.

“Star Moon dynasty soldiers, Get Ready!”

“Wind Howl dynasty soldiers, Get Ready!”

“Southern Cloud Dynasty soldiers, Get Ready!”

Shouts immediately sounded out from their mouths.

“Yes!”

“Yes!”

“Yes!”

The 400,000 soldiers replied loudly, and their killing intent instantly condensed and shot into the sky.

The sky was clear, and even the clouds were scattered.

“I’ll give the Dragon and Phoenix Empire a final warning. Surrender immediately, and we won’t kill you. However, if you don’t surrender, kill all the men, and the women will become slaves. Haha!”

The star-moon king laughed and announced the verdict to the dragon-phoenix Empire.

“Roar! Roar!”

His words made the eyes of the soldiers at the back light up. They looked excited and roared like wild beasts!

“These damn guys!”

“What? All the men will be killed and the women will become slaves? This, this...”

“There are so many of them. How can we resist them!”

Sensing the killing intent and roars coming from the front, some of the citizens in dragon-phoenix city turned extremely pale.

The men were killed, and the women were turned into slaves!

Just thinking about it made them feel terrified.

Behind the East Gate, there was another commotion.

“I finally know why General Wei suddenly left yesterday!”

Behind them, a middle-aged man muttered in fear.

General Wei’s departure yesterday had caused quite a bit of panic. At that time, some people had left the dragon and Phoenix dynasty.

However, there were still some people who were somewhat shaken, but they didn’t leave. But now...

Looking at the enemy’s terrifying strength and hearing the other party’s judgement, their bodies trembled.

“Your Majesty, we are not the enemy’s strength. Surrender!”

Suddenly, the middle-aged man spoke to Feng Luan on the city wall.

The middle-aged man’s words caused many people around to look over angrily, but there were also some whose eyes flickered.

“Oh?”

Feng Luan, who was standing at the back, suddenly heard a voice from behind. She frowned slightly and turned her head to look.

“Your Majesty, the opponent is so strong. We don’t want to die, and I don’t want my lover to become a slave!”

Another middle-aged man suddenly said.

“Yes, yes. If we are really no match for the enemy, let’s surrender!”

More and more people chimed in.

Not everyone had the momentum to face death without fear.

Not everyone was the citizen of holy sea town who firmly believed in Lord Wang and the Queen.

“Believe me, the dragon-phoenix dynasty will not be destroyed!”

“Believe me, we will win this battle!”

Feng Luan turned toward the Imperial City and spoke with a serious face.

Her voice covered the entire imperial city and entered everyone’s ears.

Such a loud voice was clearly heard by the 400,000 soldiers outside.

Star Moon King, Wind Howl King, and Southern Cloud King looked at each other, their faces filled with mockery.

“Haha, the war hasn’t even started yet, and the other side is already in Chaos!”

The Star Moon King laughed heartily.

“Because there are people who don’t want to die and become enemies with us, only death awaits them. I do hope that they don’t surrender, Hehe!”

The Southern Cloud King said with a smile.

“The Dragon and Phoenix Empire has quite a few experts. If we can recruit them, it would be pretty good!”

The star-moon Dynasty rolled its eyes, and the corners of its mouth curled up slightly. It was full of cunningness as it muttered softly, “The development of the dragon-phoenix dynasty in this year has become our wedding dress. This is pretty good!”

As it spoke softly, it slowly raised its head and roared loudly, “Citizens of the dragon-phoenix dynasty, listen up. As long as you surrender, I can spare your lives and pardon your crimes!”

“I’ll give you thirty seconds to consider. After thirty seconds, Attack!”

The Star Moon King’s voice was heard within the Dragon and Phoenix Empire.

“What? As long as you surrender, we’ll be absolved of our crimes!”

“This... this... surrender, I surrender!”

This voice caused the citizens of the dragon and Phoenix Empire to waver once again. Some of them even shouted loudly.

“Open the city gates!”

Feng Luan saw some of the scenes in the city and her expression turned cold as she spoke directly.

“Oh? Queen, are we going to... ?”

A general was slightly shocked and hurriedly asked.

“Open!”

Feng Luan glanced at him indifferently. This general didn’t dare to ask any further and immediately opened the city gates!

“Our Dragon and Phoenix Dynasty will not lose this battle, nor will we lose. But if you don’t believe me, go out and surrender now!”

“Once we walk out, we will no longer be citizens of the dragon-phoenix Empire. Do not even think about stepping into our territory!”

A cold voice rang out as she stood on the city wall, watching quietly.

“With Lord Wang and the queen here, we firmly believe that we will not lose!”

“Yes, yes, I will not leave. Even if I die, we will not leave. I believe in Her Majesty!”

“Let’s go, let’s leave quickly!”

“Get out of the way. Everyone in front, get out of the way. Don’t Block My Way Out!”

Some people stood there firmly while others ran out of the city with all their might!

This was a choice. To believe in the Queen or Not!

“It’s really troublesome to manage a country. The Dragon Palace is better. All the members of the Dragon Palace will submit 100% !”

Wang Xian looked down at the chaotic scene. He squinted his burning eyes and looked ahead as he muttered.

“I can’t wait any longer!”
