Chapter 443: Sacred Sect: Dragon Sect (3)

“Aren’t you going to admit your defeat? If the Tranquil Blue Heavenly Flame landed on your body, you wouldn’t be able to withstand it!”

Xiao Ran drew his lips with a cold smile as he stared at Qiao Fuzi.

Qiao Fuzi had a huge change in his expression. His body trembled while the palm that was gripping the Despondent Sword grew pale.

An elder below said with a gloomy face, “We lost! Fuzi!”

“Fine!”

Qiao Fuzi gritted his teeth as he inserted his sword back into the scabbard with an awful look. He threw a death stare before he hurled the sword to Xiao Ran.

“Thank you!”

Xiao Ran took over the Despondent Sword with thrills.

Inborn Spiritual Weapons were precious treasures, even in the Sacred Clans.

“The Inborn Spiritual Weapon coupled with the Heavenly Flame has pushed the strength of Xiao Ran close to a Pinnacle Inborn! That’s the suppression of equipment. Just like a cannon matched against a gun!”

“Weapons are just part of the strength, so is luck. We’ve got to admit that!”

Some of the surrounding crowd remarked with envy. The world is unfair. Some people are born to be at the peak, but some people will never reach the summit.

“Looks like there are many experts today!”

Just when a soft voice cut the air, an ominous and pale-looking young man stalked to the front with a smiling face.

The grin was somewhat creepy and cold, which struck an uneasiness into everyone.

He was holding onto a grey umbrella with pictures painted on it.

Those were extremely spooky corpses and coffins.

“Who is that mysterious young man going to challenge?”

“He was sitting in an ancient sedan carried by four Half-step to Inborn Experts. He is a mystery. I wonder which force he came from!”

“He gives off a creepy feeling. I wonder how strong he is!”

All eyes were on that mysterious young man. He opened his umbrella and gently leaped into the arena. The fair and ominous face was looking in the direction of Shi Ming from Imperial Beast Sect.

“Get over here and receive your death!”

“Hur?” He’s challenging Shi Ming from Imperial Beast Sect!”

“How courageous is he! He actually asked Shi Ming out to receive his death!”

“He’s...challenging the disciple from Imperial Beast Sect. A human and a beast from Imperial Beast Sect are equivalent to two Inborn Experts. With the combination of the two, their combat power is recognized as the strongest existence among the same level!”

“What kind of strength does this mysterious young man possess such that he dares to challenge Shi Ming?”

The people below the arena froze as they looked at the ominous-looking young man who was holding the umbrella with bewilderment. All of them were looking surprised.

Roar!

The one who replied to that ominous-looking young man was not Shi Ming, but the roar from the King of the Forest.

“Haha, Imperial Gale, are you hungry? Let’s go, I’ll find you a piece of meat!”

Shi Ming stroked the Roaring Lion and laughed loudly as he sat on him.

Roar!

Shi Ming let out a low bellow and made a leap into the arena that was twenty meters away.

Boom!

With the release of immense oppression, Roaring Lion stared at the ominous-looking young man with bloodthirsty eyes while revealing his ghastly teeth.

“Haha, I thought it was a lady in the sedan. I didn’t expect it to be a man. What a disappointment!”

The coarse voice of Shi Ming was heard as he sat on the Roaring Lion, looking down at that ominous-looking young man.

“Heh heh!”

That ominous-looking young man giggled, revealing his sparkling white teeth. Without a word, he made a swift movement in an attempt to attack Shi Ming.

“Hmph!”

Upon seeing his offense, Shi Ming swung his arm and assembled a few rods that were found on the Roaring Lion, forming a two-meter long halberd.

Phew!

He swept the halberd forward.

Whoo-hoo!

At this time, dark and cold radiance flickered in the ominous-looking young man’s eyes. He pointed the tip of the grey umbrella ahead while looking at the Roaring Lion below.

Roar!

The Roaring Lion lifted his chin as a frightening windstorm made its way to encompass that ominous-looking young man.

The most powerful thing about Imperial Beast Sect was they could launch an assault together with their Inborn Spiritual Beasts.

The strength exploded by the combination of a human and a beast way surpassed two Inborn Experts.

Bam!

Despite the grey umbrella tip having blocked the sword, the ominous-looking young man remained unmoved with the windstorm generated by the Roaring Lion.

He pulled the grey umbrella upwards, releasing a greyish mist that slayed the head of the Roaring Lion.

Poof!

A shriek was heard as the ominous-looking young man twisted his umbrella, floating more than ten meters away.

Boom! ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

A loud thud was heard as the lion head rolled down the floor!

“What!”

“This...this... ”

All the surrounding people were aghast when they saw the lion head rolling out of the arena. Everyone found it hard to believe.

“Single strike. A single strike was all it took to slay the Inborn Spiritual Beast of Shi Ming from Imperial Beast Sect!”

“How is this possible!”

“Imperial Gale!”

All the people watched the scene before them with disbelief while Shi Ming let out a sorrowful cry.

He was so startled to see his Roaring Lion beneath him beheaded. His body shook slightly.

He had actually chopped off his head in a single strike!

“How dare you kill my Imperial Gale!”

Shi Ming was infuriated as he clutched his halberd with bloodshot eyes. With a malevolent expression, he turned to look at that ominous-looking young man.

“Next is you!”

The ominous-looking young man revealed a smirk as he twisted the grey umbrella in his hand for a direct kill at Shi Ming.

“We lost!”

Just then, the golden bird on a young man’s shoulder was rotating his watery eyes with a mouth that spoke in a human voice.

Subsequently, that golden Spiritual Bird moved like a bolt of lightning above Shi Ming, grabbed his clothes, and flew down from the arena.

“This!”

That young man from Imperial Beast Sect immediately lowered down his head and greeted, “Elder Feng Ling!”

The golden Spiritual Bird did not pay attention to that young man. Instead, he stared at that ominous-looking young man with golden eyes gleamed with wisdom. “You won!”

“Hur?” The ominous-looking young man looked at that golden Spiritual Bird with wariness in his eyes.

He swung his arm, and he floated down the arena with his grey umbrella.

An empty space was immediately opened up around him as everyone stared at him with an appalled look.

“Invincible. He’s simply too powerful with that daunting umbrella!”

“That umbrella is at least an Inborn Spiritual Weapon. But what’s that grey mist about?”

“With such a strength, he should be crowned as the champion!”

“What’s that golden Spiritual Bird? It speaks human language, and it possesses such domineering wisdom!”

“That golden Spiritual Bird was fast. That disciple of Imperial Beast Sect even addressed it as Elder!”

Everything, including the mighty ominous-looking young man and the mystical golden Spiritual Bird, was incredible.

The Outstanding Young Heroes Competition this time had widened their horizons.

“That greyish mist must be some bloodline that is similar to Kun, which is also a decadent creature. He must be a Pinnacle Inborn!”

“That golden Spiritual Bird has a very high IQ. The Imperial Beast Sect has lived up to their name. The golden Spiritual Bird should be at least a Half-Step to Dan Realm Expert!”

Wang Xian watched in astonishment. He looked around those flabbergasted Martial Artists with an arching of his lips.

You guys can carry on showing off. After you’re done, it’s my turn!
