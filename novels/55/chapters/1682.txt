Chapter 1683: 1683 life-and-death pill workshop and Holy Item Forging Workshop 3

“Kill! We can’t let them escape! Chase after them!”

The disciples of the two major forces fled frantically into the distance. Behind them, the Queen of Fire Cloud and the clan elders shouted out their orders excitedly.

“CHIRP CHIRP!”

In the sky, the Fire Cloud Sparrow flew and the fiery rain fell towards the ground.

“You two major forces still want to escape?”

Wang Xian looked at the two half-step Wanshou Masters who were trying to escape as well as everyone from the two factions. A cold expression appeared on his face.

“10,000-mile Dragon Body!”

“Divine Dragon Tail Swing!”

The last two dharma images that were used to strengthen the body were unleashed.

In an instant, Wang Xian’s body size had reached a terrifying size of 15 kilometers.

A radius of 15 kilometers was equivalent to 15,000 meters.

The tallest mountain on Earth was less than 9,000 meters. If Wang Xian were to return to Earth, he could easily crash into Mount Qomolangma with just his physical body.

That was how terrifying it was!

His gigantic body swept across the sky, causing everyone in the surroundings to reveal shocked expressions.

15,000 meters. What kind of monster was this? What Dharma Idol?

However, what made everyone from the two forces even more terrified was that this terrifying creature that was 15,000 meters suddenly appeared 10 kilometers in front of them.

The gigantic dragon head stared at them with its cold and majestic eyes.

It made all the experts and disciples from the two forces feel a chill in their hearts.

“What? Teleportation? How... How is this possible? Isn’t he an expert that’s half a step away from longevity?”

“Teleportation? This creature can actually teleport. This is too terrifying!”

“Don’t be afraid, everyone. He only has the strength of a half-step wanshou. Kill! Everyone, use all your strength to kill!”

With Wang Xian’s teleportation, a terrifying body of 15,000 meters appeared in front of the disciples of the two major forces. This shocked everyone.

Following that, a group of half-step Wanshou and the elders of the two major forces gritted their teeth and shouted at everyone.

The remaining 100,000 people had a desperate look in their eyes.

“Attack!”

“Kill Our Way Out!”

Everyone let out a loud roar. Nearly 100,000 divine arts and Dharma idols flew towards Wang Xian.

That terrifying energy completely drowned him.

“Not good. Kill, Kill, support young master Wang!”

All the experts from the fire lark tribe behind roared loudly.

One after another, attacks were launched at the two major forces that were escaping.

“Let’s try our strongest defense. It’s the Dharma Idol that we haven’t used yet, the Yin-yang five elements alms bowl!”

Wang Xian didn’t panic at all when he saw all the attacks coming at him. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

His body shook and the Yin-yang tai chi pattern appeared in front of him. It was different from the yin-yang pattern.

The black and white spots were replaced by the dark and light divine dragons.

Around the picture, the five elemental divine dragons were entrenched.

The strongest defense, the yin-yang five elements alms bowl, appeared around Wang Xian and completely blocked him.

Boom! Boom! Boom

Dense attacks landed on Wang Xian’s body, and the sea of energy directly covered him.

Sensing the fluctuations of the Yin-yang five elements alms bowl, Wang Xian revealed a smile.

“Young master Wang!”

From behind, the worried figure of the fire lark tribe could be heard.

“Roar!”

Wang Xian raised his head. With a deafening dragon roar, the surrounding energy was directly dispersed.

His undamaged body appeared in front of everyone.

“What?”

“How is this possible?”

“Is he an expert of the longevity level?”

Seeing that Wang Xian did not have any injuries on his body, the disciples of the two major forces revealed an extremely embarrassed expression.

“Boom!”

At this moment, Wang Xian swung his gigantic tail and swept towards the nearly 100,000 people in front of him.

“Dodge, Dodge!”

A panicked voice was heard. The disciples of the two major forces quickly scattered in all directions.

“Kill, young master Wang has stopped them. Let’s Kill!”

However, at this moment, all the experts of the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan had already chased after them.

The attacks landed on them one after another. In an instant, the 100,000 people had dispersed completely.

Among them, one-third of them died under the attacks of the fire Lark clan’s experts.

On the ground, the corpses fell down like dumplings.

Wang Xian revealed a cold smile as he hunted down the half-step longevity experts one after another.

“PFFT, I can’t accept this. I’m the Master of the Holy Item Forging workshop. I’m the Master of the artifact forging workshop. I can’t accept this. Demon God, you are a despicable person who goes back on his words. I curse you to die a horrible death!”

At this moment, a miserable sound covered all the sounds.

Everyone was slightly shocked as they looked towards the sky hurriedly.

“TSK TSK, you are a dead person. You curse me to die a horrible death. I’m really scared!”

Mo Sha’s mocking laughter rang out.

“Pu Pu Pu!”

The sound of spitting out fresh blood rang out once again. However, this time, it was the pale-faced medicine master.

He instantly took out a crystal that seemed to contain an entire world from his mouth. The crystal emitted a faint aura.

He directly placed it into his mouth.

“Space, teleport!”

He roared loudly. His face was incomparably red as he tore apart the suppression of the domains and disappeared.

“Eh? The medicine master actually escaped?”

Mo Sha’s dissatisfied voice sounded.

At the same time, a corpse fell from the sky.

“That’s...”

“The corpse is... is...”

A trembling voice came from the disciples of the two forces, especially the disciples of the holy item forging workshop.

They looked at the familiar figure who was slowly falling from tens of thousands of meters in the sky without any signs of life. They were all shocked.

He had fallen. There was actually a ten-thousand-year-old expert who had fallen.

This was the strongest expert on the continent, an existence known as a demigod.

A terrifying expert with a ten-thousand-year lifespan!

And now, he had actually fallen!

“Bang!”

The corpse fell heavily onto the ground, smashing into everyone’s hearts.

Everyone in the holy item forging workshop trembled violently.

It’s over, it’s over!

Their holy item forging workshop was completely finished this time.

The weapon master was killed, and what awaited them was destruction.

All the experts and disciples of the holy item forging workshop were in despair.

“Boom!”

All the disciples of the life and Death Pill Workshop had blood-red eyes. They burned all their strength and even their lives as they scattered and fled in all directions.

They had collapsed.

The two forces that were second only to the empires had completely collapsed.

“The weapon master is dead. Run, run, run!”

Everyone in the holy item forging workshop fled in all directions in a daze.

However, there were only a few who could escape!

“Haha, we’ve won! We’ve won!”

“The old ancestor is mighty, young master Wang is mighty. Quick, quick, don’t let them go. Don’t let them all escape!”

The death of the weapon master was extremely exciting for everyone in the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan.

Once a longevity expert died, it meant that they had won this war completely.

This made all the members of the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan, who had been suppressed for more than a year, full of smiles and joy!
