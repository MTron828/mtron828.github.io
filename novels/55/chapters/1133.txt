Chapter 1134: 1135 ferocious beast pet egg

Translator: 5496903

“Kill this ferocious beast, hurry up, Hurry Up!”

Angry Voices came from afar as the group attacked the transcendent level 7 ferocious beast.

“There might be ferocious beasts in the nest. The weakest one should be at transcendent level 7. Everyone, be careful. Don’t open the array formation and see if there are any spiritual herbs!”

Some of the weaker ones looked over and warned loudly in fear.

Any random array formation would be a transcendent seventh rank. Among the ten thousand people present, there weren’t many that could be dealt with!

“Haha, Pet Egg, the pet egg of a transcendent seventh rank ferocious beast. We’re Rich!”

However, at this moment, an excited roar suddenly sounded, causing everyone in hundred Beast City to be slightly stunned.

“What? A pet egg? There’s a pet egg in the nest?”

“A pet egg, a transcendent seventh grade pet egg. This is worth ten million middle grade spirit stones, oh my God!”

The news of a pet egg in the nest caused everyone to go crazy.

Everyone knew the value of a pet egg. Even a transcendent seventh grade pet egg was worth tens of millions of middle grade spirit stones.

Tens of millions of mid-grade spirit stones was a huge amount of money to a powerful family.

To those mercenary groups, it was even more precious.

“Break the nest’s array formation, everyone get ready!”

“Anyone who wants to join forces, let’s Open the array formation together and request for a seventh rank transcendent expert!”

The eyes of the martial artists began to heat up. Everyone looked at the surrounding nests, their eyes filled with greed.

“Pet Egg?”

Feng Luan’s eyes flickered when she heard the voices of the people around her. The value of a pet egg was also of great use to her.

“A pet egg?”

Wang Xian revealed a smile as he scanned his surroundings.

At this moment, a group of people in front were trying to crack the array formation. The level of the array formation of the ferocious beast nest was not very high, and it was not a defensive or protective array formation. Therefore, it was not difficult to crack it.

However, no one knew whether the interior of the Lair was a violent ferocious beast or a pet egg.

The probability of a violent ferocious beast was higher.

“Can you investigate the situation inside?”

Wang Xian looked at Feng Luan and asked her directly.

“No, but even if it’s a ferocious beast in the lair, it’s easy to deal with it!”

A faint smile appeared on Feng Luan’s face.

“Should we split up?”

Wang Xian looked at her and said with a smile.

“Alright, you won’t get anything by my side either!” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Feng Luan said confidently.

Her strength had already reached level one of the Seethrough realm. Furthermore, with her experience, she could fight against a powerhouse at level two of the Seethrough realm. Even a powerhouse at level three of the Seethrough realm would find it difficult to kill her.

If she wanted to break the formation of the surrounding lairs, it would be a piece of cake. Even if there were ferocious beasts inside, she could easily kill them.

She also knew Wang Xian’s strength. He had yet to reach the Seethrough realm.

There was a huge gap between him and her if he had yet to reach the Seethrough realm.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian smiled faintly. After shrugging his shoulders, he walked to the side.

Feng Luan smiled and walked in the opposite direction.

“Hehe, this place is a treasure trove to me!”

Wang Xian’s eyes flashed with a demonic glow. His body moved and he floated in the air for ten meters.

His demonic eyes scanned through the nests.

Some of the nests were made of wood and some were made of stone. The bigger ones were more than ten meters in size while the smaller ones were three to four meters in size.

Before the formation was broken, the ferocious beasts inside could not be seen at all. They could only rely on their own luck.

However, this was only for others. The level of the formation was not high. Wang Xian’s light-dark fire dragon eyes could completely penetrate it.

He looked at the seven insightful emptiness realm experts in the sky outside.

At this moment, the seven of them were frowning as they looked down. Clearly, the pet eggs were quite attractive to them.

However, their attention was placed at the center of the hall.

There, there was a majestic hall. The corner that was exposed not too long ago was a corner of the hall.

This hall was extremely fast. It was different from the ordinary human halls. The hall there was more like a huge nest.

“Ao Yao, be careful. Stay away from those insightful emptiness realm experts!”

Wang Xian retracted his gaze and his voice was transmitted into the minds of the surrounding strange demons.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

The group of strange demons immediately responded.

“There’s a pet egg in that black wooden nest!”

“There’s one in the white jade nest as well!”

“There’s a pet egg three hundred meters ahead!”

“There’s one in the nest that the twenty people on the right are preparing to break open!”

As Wang Xian spoke, the corner of his mouth curled up slightly. He had seen all the lairs within a radius of a thousand meters.

Ao Yao and the rest immediately accepted the order. They entered the lairs silently.

That’s right, they entered directly!

The Light Thorn’s ability had no formation. It could ignore the formation.

The group of strange demon gods entered without anyone noticing. They easily took out the pet eggs one by one.

The formation was not damaged and there were no fluctuations.

“Fourteen. The harvest is not bad!”

Wang Xian moved his body and immediately flew to another location at a rapid speed.

More than ten thousand people entered the hundred beasts city, causing the surroundings to be filled with people.

Wang Xian flew in the sky and did not stand out at all.

After flying for a thousand meters to the left at a rapid speed, Wang Xian’s dragon eyes of light and dark fire scanned his surroundings again.

“One, two, three, four...”

Wang Xian scanned all the places and transmitted his voice to Ao Yao and the rest.

His speed was so fast that it could almost be described as sweeping.

One by one, the pet eggs were easily discovered. Then, they quickly shifted their positions.

The Hundred Beasts city was only a radius of ten kilometers. With his speed, Wang Xian had already swept around five kilometers in a short five minutes.

“F * ck, I’ve broken through more than 10 nests, but I didn’t find any pet eggs!”

“Yeah, my luck is really bad. Come, let’s go to the central area to take a look!”

Wang Xian was floating in the sky. A Level 9 supernatural realm expert and his subordinates around him roared with an embarrassed look on their faces.

“Roar Roar!”

At this moment, an even more majestic beast roar was heard. Everyone looked over at the same time.

“It’s near the central area. This roar is at least at transcendent-level 9!”

“Someone is near the central area. Should we go and Fight!”

“The beasts inside the nest are no longer something we can deal with!”

“Compared to the outside, there are more than a thousand nests inside. It’s very likely that they are all at transcendent-level 9 or higher. However, if we can get a transcendent-level 9 pet egg, we will be rich!”

Many people looked forward. There was fear and desire on their faces.

Danger and opportunity coexisted!

Wang Xian’s figure moved. Without any hesitation, he flew straight towards the center.

The powerhouses who were at half-step void interpretation also gave up on the lairs outside and rushed forward.
