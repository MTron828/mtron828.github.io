“Be careful!”

Qin Qing couldn’t help but remind Wang Xian loudly when she saw the thunderfish attacking him.

Although this freshman had crippled her younger brother’s limbs, he had saved her life just now.

She couldn’t help but remind him loudly.

Wang Xian couldn’t help but twitch his lips when he saw a one-meter-thick thunderbolt heading straight for him.

He raised the Thunderbolt Wood in his hand and met the bolt of lightning.

“It’s Over!”

Seeing Wang Xian holding a wooden stick to meet the bolt of lightning released by an extraordinary level-six thunderfish, some of the girls in the amethyst mercenary group even closed their eyes.

“PFFT!”

“F * ck, my injuries are really serious!”

When the bolt of lightning entered the Thunderbolt Wood, Wang Xian couldn’t help but spit out a mouthful of blood.

His injuries were too severe. He had to spit out a mouthful of fresh blood to receive an attack from an extraordinary level-six ferocious beast.

Moreover, this was under the circumstances where he had the Thunderbolt Wood as a natural treasure. If he didn’t have it, this attack would take half of his life.

“He... He caught it!”

“This...”

The female students of the amethyst mercenary group widened their eyes when they saw that Wang Xian had actually caught this thunderbolt.

This was an attack released by a transcendent level six. He could actually receive it so easily!

Even their deputy leader didn’t dare to receive the attack from a transcendent level six thunderfish head-on.

However, what shocked them even more was that the new student was actually walking slowly towards the group of thunderfish.

This...

Was he crazy?

“Roar!”

The group of thunderfish was enraged when they saw Wang Xian catching the lightning bolt and walking towards them.

Two extraordinary level five Thunderfish moved and attacked him. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“You’re courting death!”

Wang Xian looked at the group of thunderfish and the Lightning Wood in his hand fell heavily onto the ground.

At this moment, numerous blue-green vines drilled out from the ground.

The vines covered all the thunderfish within.

The vines were like poisonous snakes as they pierced through the thunderfish one by one.

“Pu Pu Pu!”

“Gugugugugugugu!”

The two thunderfish that were attacking him were pierced through by the vines and were killed instantly.

The sound of the thunderfish being pierced and their screams could be heard from the back.

“Hiss!”

Wang Xian mobilized the energy in his body and blood flowed out from his mouth again.

“Bang, Bang, Bang!”

Everyone in the amethyst mercenary group was stunned.

This included vice-leader Xiao and the two team leaders who were at transcendent level six.

What did they see?

One move?

He easily placed a wooden stick on the ground with his arm, and a large number of thunderfish were killed or injured.

How could his strength be so terrifying?

“COO, COO!”

At this moment, a series of angry voices were heard. Everyone looked over hurriedly with an embarrassed expression on their faces.

Three level six extraordinary thunderfish were not hit in their vitals.

When the three thunderfish saw that their comrades were killed and that there was a long wound on their body, their eyes turned red.

“Coo-coo!”

The three level six extraordinary thunderfish roared loudly. Their voices reverberated within a radius of a few thousand meters. Their bodies were emitting blue lightning rays!

“This is really troublesome!”

Wang Xian’s face turned a little black. He pointed at the thunderstruck wood with his hand.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

Before the Lightning was released, three wooden spears that were ten meters long attacked them.

On the wooden spears, the glow of lightning was flickering.

Wang Xian did not have the Lightning attribute. Everything was due to the powerful effect of the thunderstruck wood.

“PFFT! PFFT! PFFT!”

The wooden spear was extremely terrifying. The members of the amethyst mercenary group saw a shadow closely.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

In less than a second, they heard the screams of the last three thunderfish.

Everyone widened their eyes.

Wang Xian staggered and almost fell to the ground. He quickly used the lightning wood to support himself.

Some of the wounds on his body were bleeding.

When the members of the amethyst mercenary group saw that Wang Xian almost fell to the ground, they were alarmed.

“He... he is so strong. With such serious injuries on his body, he was actually able to kill a level six extraordinary thunderfish in one hit!”

A female student mumbled as her eyes were filled with disbelief.

The rest of the female students were also in a daze.

The person in front of them was a freshman from the Demon Hunters Academy. Furthermore, he was an extremely arrogant freshman in their eyes.

Furthermore, when he first came to the Thunder Island, a few girls were prepared to teach him a lesson.

Now that they saw this scene...

Teach him a lesson?

They finally knew that he had told them that this was their wise choice back then!

If they had really wanted to teach him a lesson back then, they would have been killed instantly.

“He was the one who saved us. His strength is at least at transcendent level seven. He isn’t arrogant at all. With his strength, if he were to be arrogant...”

A girl mumbled. She looked at Wang Xian who was heavily injured. Instead, a hint of admiration appeared in her eyes!

“Thank you for saving us!”

Deputy captain Xiao endured the pain in her body and stood up slowly. She thanked Wang Xian.

Her expression was complicated.

She was a little dazed when she saw a freshman who had killed more than a dozen ferocious beasts that almost killed them in an instant despite his serious injuries.

Wang Xian waved his hand and sat cross-legged on the ground. He placed the lightning strike wood on his leg and began to heal his injuries quickly.

“Thank you for saving us!”

The rest of the girls also spoke to Wang Xian respectfully with complicated expressions.

Some of the girls sized up Wang Xian and a hint of admiration gradually appeared in their eyes.

“He’s so strong. It’s unbelievable that a new student could be so strong. It’s all thanks to him today!”

“Yeah, he saved us even when he was heavily injured. I’m touched. He’s such a good man!”

“Sigh, I even mocked him not long ago. I’m really blind. I regret it so much. I’ll apologize to him later!”

“Yeah, we even said that he was arrogant. With his strength, there’s no need for him to be arrogant at all. He can be considered very low-key!”

“Look at him. Did you notice that he’s very handsome? I don’t know how he got injured so badly!”

The group of girls looked at Wang Xian without concealing their eyes. Their faces were filled with regret, admiration, and admiration.

Qin Qing also looked at Wang Xian in a daze.

She didn’t expect that the person who crippled her younger brother’s limbs was actually a terrifying powerhouse who was at least at transcendent level seven.

Recalling her younger brother’s provocation back then, she smiled bitterly.

It was already good enough that she didn’t kill her younger brother after offending such a situation!

“When he recovers, we have to thank him properly!”

Deputy Captain Tang whispered to the group of girls beside him.

Everyone in the amethyst mercenary group nodded and began to treat their wounds.

Their eyes would occasionally look at Wang Xian, who was sitting cross-legged on the ground.

“Deputy leader Xiao, do you still need help if you encounter any danger?”

At this moment, a voice was heard. Following that, they saw the group from the young master’s mercenary group arriving.
