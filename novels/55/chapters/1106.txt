“Cough, cough, cough...”

Tsunami Sky’s eyes widened when he saw this scene.

There was actually a void interpretation level demon beast hiding in the sky!

And this void interpretation level demon beast was easily trapped by the middle-aged man holding the staff.

He looked at the burly man who was staring at him mockingly, and then looked down.

At the very least, there were over a thousand experts at the seventh level of the extraordinary realm. They were slaughtering his subordinates at a terrifying speed.

They were slaughtering the soldiers of the ocean cultivator army.

They didn’t have the ability to resist at all. They were easily killed in an instant. None of them could resist.

Finally, he looked at the woman who hadn’t taken action yet, the old woman beside the woman, and the middle-aged man who was holding a feather fan.

“Who are they?”

Tsunami Sky’s face was filled with fear as a thought flashed through his mind.

“You can die now!”

The burly man with the large saber in his hand looked at tsunami sky and coldly said.

“No, don’t kill me. If you kill me, star-moon kingdom won’t let you off!”

Tsunami Sky saw the killing intent in the burly man’s eyes and hurriedly shouted in fear.

“Die!”

The burly man did not hesitate at all. His body moved, and the large saber in his hand directly slashed towards tsunami sky.

“No!”

Feeling the thick and heavy saber light of the burly man, Tsunami Sky’s face was filled with despair as he shouted out loudly.

Layers of water currents on his body blocked, but the difference was too great.

“He is at least a third level profound void martial artist!”

Tsunami Sky Thought in terror.

“Boom!”

With a slash, tsunami sky’s body was split into two!

“Roar, Roar, I can’t accept this!”

At this time, the Blood Savage Demonic Beast’s desperate scream came from the sky.

The leader of the Blood Savage Demonic Beast died under the attack of the chains.

The corpses fell to the ground.

On the ground, there were already corpses. The thousands of experts who attacked didn’t shout or make any sound.

They could only kill!

In less than a minute, tens of thousands of soldiers of the ocean cultivator corps were killed.

Blood flowed like a river!

At this moment, in the sacred sea town, screams, the red chains in the sky, the terrified roars of the tsunami sky, and the terrified pleas of the blood barbaric demon beasts.

All over the sacred sea town.

The people who stood on the city wall and witnessed this scene widened their eyes and gaped.

“This, this, this...”

A young man’s body trembled as he rubbed his eyes with all his strength. “Heavens, the ocean cultivator army, an expert at the profound void realm, was actually killed so easily!”

“So powerful, so terrifying. They actually killed the general of the ocean cultivator army at the profound void realm in an instant, and killed the leader of the blood barbaric demon beasts that were hiding in the sky!”

“Powerhouses. All of them are top-notch powerhouses. Among the over a thousand of them, none of them are lower than transcendent level seven. Oh My God!”

Everyone was shocked. They looked at the group of people outside the city and their faces were filled with astonishment.

This group of people were simply godkillers!

Wang Xian was not too surprised when he saw this scene.

After all, he had already witnessed the terrifying existence of the old lady who could teleport. It was within his expectations that Feng Luan could build up such strength.

His body moved and he flew out directly.

“Not bad!”

Wang Xian came to Feng Luan’s side. He looked at her and said with a smile.

“Is this the town that you want to give me?”

Feng Luan looked at her with a smile.

“HMM? How is it? This gift is not bad, right?”

Wang Xian said with a smile. He looked at the corpses around him and waved at Ao Jian who was behind him!

“Give these corpses to me as a return gift!”

Wang Xian said with a smile. He threw the storage bag to ao Jian and asked him to put away the corpses.

It was another huge harvest.

Feng Luan rolled her eyes at him. “Open the formation. Let’s go in!”

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded. “Follow me. I’ll bring you to take a look!”

As he spoke, he walked side by side with Feng Luan into Shenghai Town.

Feng Luan’s eyes were sparkling as she looked at the town.

Behind her, the middle-aged man who was holding a feather fan, a large saber and a staff as well as more than a thousand people behind him looked at the young man who was walking shoulder to shoulder with their king in shock.

Their eyes were filled with disbelief.

As die-hard loyalists, they naturally knew the identity of their king.

The empress from a thousand years ago, the noble and aloof empress.

Now, she was actually so close to a young man.

Even the powerful and terrifying old man had to take a small step back in front of their empress. However, this young man was walking together with the empress.

“Lord Wang!”

“Lord Wang!”

“Lord Wang!”

Wang Xian brought them into holy sea town. The people of Holy Sea town looked at them and greeted them respectfully.

They looked at Feng Luan and the group of people who followed him in with curiosity and respect.

“Who is that beauty? Could she be Lord Wang’s wife? With such strength, Lord Wang must have a powerful background. Don’t you think so?”

“It’s possible. However, this group of people is so terrifying. They killed two insightful emptiness realm experts directly. They are too invincible!”

“It should be someone called by Lord Wang to help us solve the predicament of Shenghai Town!”

The surrounding citizens whispered.

Along the way, all the citizens who met Wang Xian greeted him respectfully. Some children even bowed to him in admiration.

Feng Luan saw all of this and was slightly surprised. At the same time, she was very happy.

“Looks like you have quite a reputation in Shenghai Town!”

When they were about to arrive at the mayor’s residence, Feng Luan said to Wang Xian with a smile.

“Of course. Now that Shenghai town has left star-moon kingdom, everyone here will listen to my orders. Otherwise, how can I give Shenghai Town to you?”

Wang Xian said with a smile.

“The People’s hearts are united. This is better than taking down a city directly. Although the town is smaller, the most important thing is the people’s Hearts!”

The old lady saw the entire Shenghai town in her eyes.

After experiencing despair, Shenghai town had undoubtedly experienced nirvana. Everyone’s spirit and energy were more vigorous!

Such a new town had immense potential.

Moreover, with the People’s Hearts United, the future development would be very easy.

The old lady said to Feng Luan with a smile on her face.

“That’s right. This place can save one to two years of development!”

Feng Luan also nodded happily.

“Then you have to thank me properly!”

Wang Xian said with a smile on his face.

“Sir Wang Xian!”

At this moment, Jin Qianyuan came up to the entrance of the mayor’s residence. He had already learned about what had happened outside the city.

When he saw Wang Xian leading a group of terrifying powerhouses, he had a faint feeling that something big was about to happen.

“Mayor Jin, please call all the powerhouses in Shenghai town over. I have something to announce!”

Wang Xian said to Jin Qianyuan.

“Yes!”

Jin Qianyuan nodded his head!
