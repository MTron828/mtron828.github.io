3393 3392 innate thunder bell. It was a pleasant surprise

Boom

In the lake of thunder, Wang Xian’s body trembled. A powerful pressure enveloped the purple thunder snake king.

Since he wanted to suppress it, he had to tame it completely.

Hiss! Hiss! Hiss

The Purple Thunder Snake King lay on the ground with its head lowered.

It didn’t take long to tame and suppress it. It was done within half an hour.

“Hiss! Hiss!”

The Purple Lightning Snake King was lying in front of Wang Xian as it swayed its body.

“Let’s go. Bring me to your lair and see if there are any treasures!”

Wang Xian patted its head and gave an order.

“Hiss! Hiss!”

The purple lightning snake king nodded its head and brought it to the entrance of the cave.

He kept the large number of corpses that had died due to their battle.

“Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!”

Wang Xian entered the cave and immediately felt a majestic force of lightning.

This was a place that could allow lightning practitioners to improve rapidly.

Deep inside the cave, the nest of the Purple Lightning Snake King was inside.

“Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!”

The purple lightning snake king brought him inside and stuck out its tongue.

“HMM? There aren’t any treasures inside?”

Wang Xian looked inside and frowned slightly. He communicated with it.

“Hiss! Hiss!”

The Purple Thunder Snake King shook its head, indicating that all its treasures had been absorbed by it.

“Hiss! Hiss!”

At this moment, the Purple Thunder Snake King suddenly stuck out its tongue at him. A message was transmitted into his mind.

It transmitted an image. The image was of the thundermale ape.

The thundermale ape was lying on top of a mountain, emitting a powerful aura.

“Are you saying that you know the lair of the Thundermale Ape?”

Wang Xian asked the purple thundersnake king in surprise.

The purple thundersnake king nodded and replied immediately.

“Oh, bring me there immediately!”

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered slightly. He immediately ordered it.

“Hiss! Hiss!”

The purple lightning snake king immediately responded. It lowered its head and ordered Wang Xian to stand on it.

Wang Xian moved his body and jumped on it.

“Roar! Roar!”

It let out a low roar and dashed out quickly.

Wang Xian took out the vitality fluid and sprinkled it on its wounds. It healed the wounds on its body quickly.

“Hiss! Hiss!”

This made the purple lightning snake king let out a joyous cheer and increased its speed.

Wang Xian stood on top of its head and shuttled across the land quickly.

When the surrounding dire beasts saw the Purple Thunder Snake King, they immediately hid far away.

“Hehe, to have such a powerful battle pet, it’s quite domineering.”

Wang Xian smiled gently. With a move of his palm, the bell-shaped innate spiritual treasure appeared in his hand.

The innate spiritual treasure was also of great use to the current Wang Xian. It could increase his attack power by quite a lot.

As the energy was transferred into it, waves of information were transmitted immediately.

The bell was called the innate Thunder Bell. It was a powerful attack Numinous Treasure.

It could release the innate thunder sound, Thunder Bell Explosion, and other powerful attack methods.

To Wang Xian, it was considered a rather powerful weapon.

“I’ll refine it for the time being. When I have the chance, I’ll sell it and exchange it for resources to increase my strength.”

Wang Xian thought to himself as he stood on top of the Purple Thundersnake King and began to refine it.

The Purple Thundersnake king brought him along as they shuttled through the thunderclouds.

The thundermale Ape’s lair was not close. They flew for half a month.

There was a reason why the Purple Thundersnake King was much slower than Wang Xian.

“Hiss, hiss, hiss!”

Half a month later, the Purple Lightning Snake King stuck out its tongue at Wang Xian and sent him a message.

“Are we here?”

Wang Xian squinted his eyes slightly and looked at the innate lightning bell in front of him.

He had already refined a portion of the Lightning Bell. It would take another one to two months for him to completely refine it.

He raised his head and scanned his surroundings.

Here, there were mountain peaks that were bathed in the lightning.

At a glance, the mountain peaks were endless.

“Hiss Hiss!”

The Purple Lightning Snake King’s gaze was fixed in one direction, transmitting a message.

Wang Xian looked in the direction it was looking at, and his dragon eyes flickered.

That mountain peak was obviously very different from the surrounding mountain peaks.

The entire mountain peak was even more purple. Bathed in the Lightning, it emitted a purple glow.

Wang Xian could vaguely see a huge body lying at the top of the mountain peak.

“You can go there later.”

Wang Xian’s body moved and appeared behind him with the uninitiated holy wings. The five elements millstone was suspended in the air.

In a flash, he disappeared immediately.

Buzz

In the next moment, he arrived at the spot above the thundermale ape that was lying on the mountain peak.

“A healing-type blessed land!”

Sensing the energy from the mountain peak below, Wang Xian made a judgment in his heart.

“Dragon Eyes Lock All Corners!” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

In the next moment, without any hesitation, he transformed into a divine dragon instantly. Numerous chains charged towards the thundermale ape.

“Roar!”

The moment Wang Xian made his move, the thundermale ape, who was lying on top of the mountain and bathing in the Lightning, opened its eyes. With a move of its palm, a lightning pillar appeared in its palm and smashed towards him.

“Purple Thundersnake King, make your move!”

Wang Xian shouted softly and the five elemental grindstone met the attack of the Lightning pillar directly.

“Bang!”

The Lightning pillar collided with the five elemental grindstone and collapsed instantly. The power of the five elemental grindstone was still sweeping towards the thundermale ape.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

The thundermale ape went berserk instantly when he saw this scene. It was as though blood was seeping out from his eyes.

“Bang! Bang! Bang!”

He patted his chest forcefully. It was as though he was beating a drum. Bolts of lightning struck the surroundings.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

At this moment, the Purple Thundersnake King rushed over. A huge bolt of lightning shot out from his thunder horn and struck at him.

The Purple Thundersnake King wasn’t weak. In fact, he could even suppress the thundermale ape by himself.

Under such circumstances, coupled with Wang Xian and the five elements grindstone, the thundermale ape did not have any strength left to resist.

“Five elements annihilating Dragon Claw!”

Wang Xian growled and charged forward.

The five elements grindstone was accompanied by the roars of the five divine dragons. Streams of elemental energy blasted towards it.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

When the thundermale ape saw these attacks, its face was filled with shock and anger.

Boom

He waved his arm and a thunder mountain flew over from the surrounding area. He hugged the Thunder Mountain and smashed it towards Wang Xian and the rest.

Bang! Bang

The Thunder Mountain was extremely sturdy. However, it was still easily shattered into pieces when faced with the attacks from Wang Xian and the rest.

“Kill him immediately!”

Wang Xian did not show any mercy and ordered the Purple Thunder Snake King.

“Roar Roar!”

The Purple Thundersnake king immediately responded. After being subdued, it attacked the thundermale ape with all its might.

Wang Xian and the five elements Millstone’s attacks also arrived at the same time.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

The thundermale ape waved its arms again and smashed the Thunder Mountains towards them.

“Bang Bang Bang!”

However, very soon, a continuous stream of energy landed on its body.

The Thunder Male Ape’s nest was here, so it could not escape even if it wanted to.

The battle against the Thunder Male Ape was very easy.
