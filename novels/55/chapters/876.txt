The black passageway was like a black hole. The moment Wang Xian stepped into it, he immediately felt that he had entered an endless darkness. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The entire world and space were not the kind of place where one could break through the void and enter another world after reaching a certain level of cultivation.

Instead, they existed in the form of the universe.

The extraordinary continent might be very, very far away from Earth, or it might be located in a corner of the universe.

However, some experts could use special methods to establish a teleportation array between the planets and they could directly enter another world.

The wormhole of the insect race!

The array formation of the human race!

The divine patterns of the celestial race!

The Dragon Lair of the Dragon Race!

And so on and so forth. All of them could connect two planets. The passageway between the supernatural continent and Earth might have been formed due to a certain reason.

When Wang Xian felt that there was light in front of him, he realized that he was in the depths of the sea.

A strong attractive force came over, causing him to feel slightly uncomfortable.

“The gravitational force of the supernatural continent is more than ten times that of Earth. It is extremely difficult for those below the supernatural realm to fly!”

“The sea here is so deep. It is actually 50,000 to 60,000 meters deep!”

Wang Xian revealed a shocked expression as he looked around.

The surroundings were filled with furry water plants. This passageway leading to Earth was very secretive.

Furthermore, the passageway on Earth was sealed by the Dragon Palace. After entering this passageway, one could not launch an attack. Under such circumstances, only the members of the Dragon Palace could enter and exit freely.

Therefore, in the future, even if this passage was discovered by others, it would still not be able to enter Earth.

It would be directly blocked by the Dragon Palace.

“Dragon King!”

At this time, the voices of Gu Qingwen and the others came from behind. They were the ten members of the Sacred Glory mercenary group.

“Dragon King, this is the Dongwen Sea area. The Dongwen Sea area is a chaotic area. This place is relatively barren. There are many giant squid living here. These sea creatures are extremely brutal. When they are hungry, they attack any creature!”

Gu Qingwen was the shady young man. At this moment, he looked around vigilantly and said.

“Go to the Shenghai town that you mentioned!”

Wang Xian immediately said to them.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Everyone nodded and swam upwards vigilantly.

“Oh no, there are four giant squid!”

At this moment, a cry of surprise came from the side. Wang Xian turned his head and looked over.

Instantly, he saw a monster that was more than 20 meters in size but had four heads.

Two of its heads were covered with densely packed teeth while the other two were sharp objects that looked extremely disgusting.

The four-headed giant squid had the strength of a transcendent-level four according to their levels.

Four-headed giant squid: transcendent-level four.

Extractable Dragon Crystal: 20

“I can extract 20 dragon crystals?”

Wang Xian was slightly stunned. A hint of surprise appeared in his eyes.

Name: Wang Xian

Race: Five Elements Divine Dragon (able to transform into a human)

Level: extraordinary first level (first change of divine dragon)

Dragon Crystal: 70/100

Supernatural ability: rule the water tribe (rule the water tribe that is lower than your own level)

Devour living things (devour living things to extract dragon crystals)

Control of the five elements

Cultivation Method: Divine Dragon Transformation

Supernatural ability: burning the river and boiling the sea, gold splitting the void, descending of the wood realm, water crisis city, wrath of the Earth, soul capture, endless sight, spirit possession!

Currently, Wang Xian was still short of 30 dragon crystals to reach transcendent-level 2. If he were to devour this four-headed giant squid, it wouldn’t be long before he could break through to transcendent-level 2.

“Dragon King, leave quickly. If you get entangled with this four-headed giant squid, you will attract other sea creatures. In the chaotic sea area, creatures have no intelligence and are considered ferocious beasts. They are bloodthirsty!”

The ten people who had become DRAKONIDS immediately shouted.

“Ao Yao, can you kill it in an instant?”

Wang Xian felt a little indignant as he spoke to the person beside him.

Apart from the ten people from the Holy Glory mercenary group, the only one who came with him this time was Ao Yao.

Ao Yao, who had evolved into a light thorn, was only slightly weaker than Wang Xian in terms of strength. In a battle, he was even much stronger than the ten people from the Holy Glory mercenary group.

“No, it has ten heads. I can destroy two of them in an instant at most!”

Ao Yao shook his head.

“Let’s go. Let’s settle down First!”

Wang Xian hesitated for a moment. His body moved and he flew quickly toward the sky.

Due to the strong gravitational force, Wang Xian’s flying speed was about ten times slower than before.

However, in the ocean, his speed was still not something that ordinary creatures could match.

“PFFT!”

As he rushed out of the water, another world appeared in front of his eyes.

“CHIRP CHIRP!”

A huge seabird was circling in the sky and making ear-piercing chirps. The wings of the seabird were about five meters wide.

“Dragon King, let’s fly into the sky. Be careful of the birds around us. The powerful birds are enough to eat us. We have to fly 100 kilometers east!”

Gu Qingwen roared loudly and stared at his surroundings nervously.

Wang Xian scanned his surroundings. In the sea, he saw a 20 to 30-meter-long black shadow flash past.

In the sky, there were seabirds that were more than 10 meters in size flying. Some seabirds had a pair of blood-red eyes and looked extremely ferocious.

“Let’s Go!”

From their expressions, Wang Xian knew that this was not a safe place. If he came to the extraordinary mainland by himself, he might become the food of these ferocious beasts.

“This world is really brutal. Luckily, I didn’t bring Shu Qing Qing Yue and the rest here!”

Wang Xian clicked his tongue slightly. With a move of his body, a cloud of mist appeared around them.

The so-called cloud riding mist was an application of the water attribute.

Wang Xian used the water attribute to create a cloud of mist that enveloped them and flew towards the east.

“Shenghai town is a small town that belongs to the Blue Moon Kingdom’s Donghai City. There are ten empires, fifty small countries, and some duchies in the entire extraordinaire continent. Other than the dynasty, there is also a large family, sect, and academy that is independent of the dynasty!”

“The Blue Moon Kingdom has a population of over three billion people. The Blue Moon royal family is the king of this territory!”

Along the way, Gu Qingwen kept introducing some basic information about the transcendental continent to Wang Xian.

After flying for three hours, they finally saw the coast, Shenghai town. It was a town that was close to the sea.

“We actually flew for three hours for more than 100 kilometers. I feel like our strength is being restrained after entering the transcendental continent!”

Due to the gravitational force, their flying speed had decreased by more than ten times.

“Flying is prohibited in the town. Moreover, one has to pay spirit stones to enter the town!”

Gu Qingwen said to Wang Xian.

Humans were not respected in the transcendence continent.

On the transcendence continent, there were dragons and demonic beasts. Humans were not the masters of the entire continent.

Just like the Dragons, the masters of the ocean, the absolute overlords. Even humans had to fear them.

There were also great demons in the other wilderness, and the demon beasts were no less intelligent than humans.

Humans ate demon beasts, and Demon Beasts also ate humans.

As long as it wasn’t in the town or in the city, it wasn’t safe.
