Chapter 550: Too Weak

“Hey, Junior brother! Since you have joined our Mt. Fengyu, tell us your name!” The young man with a sky blue longsword looked at Wang Xian, lifted his head slightly and spoke.

“Wang Xian!”

Wang Xian looked across the twenty-odd young men and girls. He was a little impressed.

All of them were Inborn experts!

A twenty-year-old Inborn expert would have caused a huge ruckus in the Underworld. Yet, all of them here were Inborn experts.

If elite disciples are Inborn experts, wouldn’t the core disciples be Dan Realm experts? Wouldn’t Elders and Attendants be Budding Realm and the Sect Leader be Immortal Realm? This force is too insane! [1]

Wang Xian had decided that he definitely had to enhance the strength of Dragon Sect and Dragon Palace once he got out of this place.

Otherwise, the Dragon Sect would be nothing when the Immortal Sects of Yong Chang world were to descend upon the real world.

“Wang Xian?”

When the group of youths heard Wang Xian’s simple introduction, they raised an eyebrow.

“How rude!”

Yu Ling’er pouted, picked up her sword and was on her way to practice her swordsmanship.

“Since Junior brother has joined our Mt. Fengyu, I will have to guide you well in the future as your senior. Come, let your Senior brothers and sisters see what you are capable of!”

A young man with hair that reached his waist raised an eyebrow. He lifted the longsword in his hand and gestured to Wang Xian with a smile.

Wang Xian looked at the young man in a traditional outfit, shook his head and said, “It’s alright!”

An Inborn-level existence couldn’t pique his interest at all.

“Oh? Senior brother Huayu wants to get a sense of your strength. Don’t you know what to do?”

“You are new here and yet you dare to be so proud?”

Beside them, two young men chided Wang Xian coldly upon hearing Wang Xian rejecting the guidance of Senior brother Hua Yu.

“Junior brother, you are being a little rude here! Draw your sword!”

Hua Yu was a little surprised to be rejected by Wang Xian. The next moment, he waved the longsword in his hand as the glow of the sword swished passed Wang Xian.

The surrounding disciples simply watched with smiles. They held their swords in their embrace, smirked and watched with enthusiasm.

Senior brother Hua Yu was the strongest among them. Whenever there was a new disciple, he would want to get a sense of his strength.

The so-called sense was, in fact, showing the new disciple who was in charge here.

In the entire Mt Fengyu, everyone was convinced of Senior brother Hua Yu other than Yu Ling’er.

Moreover, Senior brother Hua Yu had been wooing Yu Ling’er. Seeing how Yu Ling’er was displeased with Wang Xian a while ago, he naturally wouldn’t let this opportunity slip by.

When the crowd saw how nonchalant Wang Xian was acting, they were a little unhappy too.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded his head. He would have crippled a person like him, who courted his death, in the Underworld.

“Take this sword technique!” Wang Xian smiled faintly and swung his longsword across.

Instantly, dense illusory swords formed all around him.

“Huh? You aren’t too bad!”

Hua Yu focused his attention a little, moved his arms and gathered ten water swords, which began circling around him.

“Slash!” Wang Xian shouted plainly. Mist started forming around him as the illusory longswords shot towards the young man.

“Illusory swords? Hehe!”

The young man’s eyes were filled with contempt. He squinted and shouted, “Ten Tiers Blade!”

“Illusory Swords against Ten Tiers Blade. This kid is a far cry from Senior brother Hua Yu!”

“I wonder how many strikes from Senior brother Hua Yu he could withstand!”

When the surrounding disciples saw Wang Xian attack, they chuckled with contempt.

Illusory Swords was a sword technique that disciples below the Inborn Realm could practice. At their level, they had started learning Tiers Sword and Water Sword. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Bam!

Huh?

Sounds of metal clashing reverberated. Everyone could see Wang Xian’s longsword being deflected away.

However, the longswords that were deflected continued their attack by making a beautiful arc the next instant.

The thousands of Illusory Swords around him were all heading towards Senior brother Hua Yu.

“What? He... He’s there!”

At this moment, a young man pointed to the back with a horrified expression.

Everyone was taken aback and turned around. To their astonishment, they found Wang Xian standing more than ten meters away.

As for the Illusory Swords, they were being controlled to attack from a distance.

“Who would have expected our Junior brother to be this good with the battle techniques of Illusory Swords!”

Hua Yu completed his Ten Tiers Blade after knocking the longswords away time after time. In the end, the other swords came to attack him instantly. At this moment, his expression turned solemn.

Before him, there were over a thousand longswords hidden within the thin mist.

He realized that the attack of every Illusory Sword was extremely forceful. Moreover, as they were Illusory Swords, they couldn’t be crushed other than by deploying water energy to erase them.

“Great! Great! You are actually able to push me to this point.”

Hua Yu was looking a little embarrassed. He flexed his muscles and shouted, “Descent of the Sword of Boundless!”

Swish swish swish!

The next instant, ten razor-sharp water swords were formed from water energy.

“Go!” he shouted loudly and the longswords flew towards the core of Wang Xian’s attack.

“If you don’t wish to get injured, you better admit your defeat now!” he reminded in a cold and arrogant tone.

Yet, the crowd was completely stunned at this moment.

They stared blankly at Senior brother Hua Yu before turning to Wang Xian, who was more than ten meters away. They couldn’t help but gasp.

Even Yu Ling’er was dumbfounded and in disbelief.

Senior brother Hua Yu had been fighting with his illusion that used a metal longsword all along!

As for Wang Xian, he was controlling the water energy from ten meters away.

This... This was totally toying with him!

Complete domination!

Senior brother Hua Yu still wasn’t aware that his real opponent was watching him from ten meters away when he was making those bold statements.

“Since you aren’t admitting defeat, don’t curse me for not showing mercy!” Hua Yu shouted. He waved the longsword in his hand as he crushed illusory sword after illusory sword.

Towards the middle of the sea of illusory swords, the razor-sharp water sword instantly erased the Illusory Swords.

“Too weak!”

After his attack, a voice filled with contempt resounded.

“What?”

When Hua Yu sensed that there wasn’t anyone in the center of the sea of Illusory Swords, he had a bad premonition.

When the dense mist dissipated, six razor-sharp water swords hovered around him and had him completely stunned.

Wang Xian shook his head nonchalantly, waved his arms and the longswords before Hua Yu returned to him.

“This... This...”

None of the disciples of Mt. Fengyu knew how to describe this battle.

The strongest among them all, Senior brother Hua Yu, had been shouting and screaming before. Yet, he was made a clown by Wang Xian.

Countless Illusory Swords and a metal sword were enough to toy with Senior brother Hua Yu.

This Junior brother of theirs was really strong. It was especially so in the control of Illusory Swords.

Da Hong Sword Technique focuses on the technique and not the sword! Illusory Swords focus on the illusions and not the sword!

Wang Xian gained a little understanding as he revealed a smile.

The reason why Da Hong Immortal Sect wasn’t a sect of sword cultivators was because their cultivation wasn’t in the sword, but the techniques and tactics behind the sword!
