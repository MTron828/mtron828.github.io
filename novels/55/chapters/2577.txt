“Damn it!”

“What is this thing, how can they hide in space!”

“Not good, there are too many warriors from the Dragon Palace!”

At this time, when the members of the Dragon Palace surrounded the warriors from the 5 powers, when the Dragonspine Dragons attacked, instantly killing 40 undyings!

Everyone from the 5 powers felt their scalps go numb, their eyes filled with fear and fear!

In an instant, 40 undyings were assassinated, of which 1 was at level 6 and 2 were at level 5!

What shocked them the most was that after the assassination, the 40 strange silhouettes vanished once again!

What was even more shocking was that they actually couldn’t discover their presence!

This...

The 5 forces all had cold sweat on their foreheads!

“Kill, don’t let any of them escape!” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Ao Qitian let out a furious roar and directly attacked them!

“Kill!”

Ao Qi followed closely behind!

“Oh no, we’re not their match!”

The Jian Hua Group’s Tier 6 divine king expert’s expression changed drastically. He immediately raised the shield in his hand to block as he shouted loudly!

“The other party’s strength is double ours. We can’t fight them!”

“There are still those strange creatures surrounding us. We Aren’t their match!”

Everyone from the five major factions roared with extremely ugly expressions!

They were panicking!

In the abyss, they could not escape immediately. Once they died, they would truly be finished!

“Patriarch, save us!”

At that moment, the ninth grade heaven sect experts could not help but shout at the Patriarch in the sky!

“What?”

The Patriarch of the ninth-grade heaven sect was slightly shocked when he heard the cry for help. He immediately looked down!

When he saw that they were surrounded and there were still forty corpses in the air, his expression changed drastically!

“Damn it, Dragon King, you’re setting us up!”

The Patriarch of the ninth-grade Heaven Sect’s expression changed drastically. He stared at Wang Xian with blood-red eyes and shouted!

“Hahaha, do you really think that our Dragon Palace is defenseless? What a bunch of idiots!”

Wang Xian said with a face full of mockery. He waved his dragon claws and attacked him directly!

“Damn it!”

The heart of the ninth-grade celestial sect’s patriarch sank. He threw out the lightning hammer in his hand and attacked!

At the same time, he wanted to fly down and rescue them!

“I’m afraid you’re not strong enough to save them!”

Wang Xian waved his arm and the five elements millstone met the Lightning Hammer directly!

At the same time, Wang Xian’s dragon claw clawed at the ninth-grade celestial sect’s patriarch!

“Get lost!”

The ninth-grade celestial sect’s patriarch shouted furiously!

“Hahaha, are you thinking too much if you want to get rid of Me Now?”

Wang Xian’s face was full of mockery as he stopped him directly!

“Kill everyone else!”

At this moment, he ordered the members of the Dragon Palace!

“Roar Roar Roar!”

More than 500 devouring dragons roared and their huge bodies attacked everyone from the five major factions!

“Breakthrough!”

At this moment, all the experts from the five major factions no longer wanted to kill the members of the Dragon Palace!

It was good that they could escape now!

“Breakthrough Breakthrough!”

The undyings roared madly, even the 5 undying level 6 warriors broke through separately!

“We’ll stop them and try to stay here!”

Duan Jin Ming roared, immediately locking onto an undying level 6 warrior!

Ao he and the others locked onto one too!

“Kill, Kill, Kill!”

...

All the warriors of the five forces fought with their lives on the line, their faces blood red as they tried to break through!

However, to escape, the encirclement of the Dragon Palace warriors wasn’t that simple!

Very quickly, two members of the Dragon Palace, and even three of them surrounded and attacked one of the other!

The Warriors of the five forces were completely tied down!

“Ah Ah Ah!”

The moment they were entangled, the next stage would be the Thorn Dragon’s stage!

The 5 forces were already having a hard time defending against 2 or 3 members of the same level, against the Thorn Dragon’s assassination, no matter how lucky they were, they would be heavily injured!

However, if they couldn’t Dodge in time, they would be met with death!

Another round of attacks, over 20 undying emperors fell!

Some of the Warriors from the 5 powers looked over, their faces even paler!

Over 20 undyings had fallen, it meant that 40 to 50 warriors of the same level as the Dragon Palace would surround and attack them!

...

If this continued, they would all be finished very quickly!

“The 3 of us break through here, quickly, even if we are heavily injured, we have to break through!”

The leader of the 3 seas sect saw this scene and his heart tightened, he hurriedly shouted at the level 6 warriors of the Jian Hua Group and Black Forest Group!

“Good!”

The other two experts also gritted their teeth. The three of them saw an opportunity and forcefully tried to break through even if they had to suffer heavy injuries!

“Stop them!”

The weapons in AO Qitian and Ao Qi’s hands heavily covered the three of them!

“It’s over!”

The heart of the tier 6 godly kings of the Jianhua group sank when they saw the attack behind them!

They could not withstand this attack. However, if they stopped to resist, they would not be able to escape completely!

“I will take revenge for you!”

At this moment, a voice entered their ears!

Following that, the two experts from the Jianghua Group and the Black Forest Group sensed a huge force landing on their bodies!

They widened their eyes and looked at the Three Seas Gate’s Gate Master in disbelief, their eyes filled with anger!

“Jihuang Yuan!”

“Peng!”

The Jianghua Group’s Tier 6 Godly King roared in rage, but in the next moment, a terrifying attack landed on the two of them!

The three seas sect leader gritted his teeth and tried his best to escape!

“Damn it!”

Behind them, Ao Qi Tian and Ao Qi saw the three seas sect leader using two level 6 warriors as shields, swiftly breaking through their defenses, their expressions changed!

“Ah!”

At this time, a scream came from behind!

They turned to look, Ao Yao had once again assassinated an undying level 6 warrior!

“No need to chase, it’s hard to catch up, kill the rest!”

Ao Qitian pondered for a while and said!

Four undying level 6 warriors were killed, one was escaping, the rest of the Undying Warriors didn’t have the ability to fight back!

One undying warrior after another was quickly killed!

“No, Dragon Palace, just you wait, one day, we will destroy you!”

In the sky, the ninth-grade celestial sect’s patriarch shouted with an embarrassed expression when he saw the experts dying one by one!

“Hehe, not bad. One of your people escaped!”

Wang Xian smiled contemptuously and said to the ninth-grade celestial sect’s patriarch!

“Scram!”

The Thunderbolts on the ninth-grade celestial sect’s patriarch’s body were violent as he attacked Wang Xian!

However, after he released his attack, his entire body flew into the distance!

Wang Xian was stunned for a moment when he blocked his attack!

“So, the one who got lost is you guys!”

He smiled and did not pursue. Even if he could not return to his divine kingdom, it would be extremely difficult for Wang Xian to keep him!
