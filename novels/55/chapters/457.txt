Chapter 458: The Battle Of The Ages (4)

“What did Xiao Ran mean when he said they must be courting death to want to kill his master?”

“There are five saint-class forces! Five saint-class forces are heading to that island right now! That’s the strength of about one-fifth of the Underworld! This is insane!”

“Xiao Ran’s master definitely isn’t from the Medical Saint Sect or the Qiao Clan. If he had said that, could it be...?”

“That old man must be the Laozu of the Xiao Clan. Oh gosh! Another unparalleled expert has appeared. I wonder if the Laozu of Sui Clan is around!”

The appearance of Sui Clan and Xiao Clan in quick succession had shocked the spectating crowd.

It was especially so for the clan leader of the Xiao Clan to make the statement that they must be courting death to kill his master. As a result, many people had an idea in mind.

The Dragon King of the Dragon Sect was the master of Xiao Ran.

This wasn’t a baseless conjecture but one of reasoning and probabilities.

First, the Dragon King had reached a higher realm than the Inborn Realm at just the age of twenty.

Second, the sister of the Dragon King had reached Inborn level and even defeated the young lord of Sea Serpent Island before the age of twenty.

Third, there were many young experts in the Dragon Sect.

Combining all three reasons, all the young Inborn experts seemed to be related to the Dragon King.

In that case, the reason why Xiao Ran from the Xiao Clan could reach the Inborn Realm might very well be because of the Dragon King.

If he was the disciple of the Dragon King, one could also foresee the relationship between the Dragon Sect and the Xiao Clan.

As for the Sui Clan, no one really knew the reason. Nonetheless, they must be here to aid the Dragon King.

Two Sacred Clans had come to reinforce them.

“Gulp! Two Sacred Clans are here to aid the Dragon Sect. This...”

“It’s hard to tell now who will emerge victorious!”

“Medical Saint Sect, Qiao Clan and seven other forces against the Dragon Sect, Xiao Clan and the Sui Clan! That’s a battle of the ages!”

“In that case, it’s still hard to tell who will be annihilated!”

At the beach, the spectating crowd looked towards the faraway island with conflicting emotions.

With five Saint-class forces gathered there, that was almost equivalent to one-fifth of the strength of the entire Underworld.

The battle of the ages would be beginning soon!

The appearance of the Sui Clan and the Xiao Clan had caused an incomparably huge ruckus in the Underworld.

...

At this very moment, on the island above the sea, the Supreme Elders of the Medical Saint Sect and the Laozu of the Qiao Clan hovered in the air. The disciples of the Medical Saint Sect, Qiao Clan and the experts from the seven other forces stood below them and were staring ahead with smiles.

Before them, Wang Xian sat in a chair with a faint smile. Xiao Yu, Elder Fang, Lan Qingyue, Guan Shuqing, Sun Lingxiu and the others stood by his side.

The fifty dragonians stood behind him and stared at the group of people with intense killing intent.

“That’s the Dragon King of the Dragon Sect?”

In the air, the Laozu of Quiao Clan looked down on Wang Xian and asked coldly.

“Qiao Clan? Medical Saint Sect? Hehe!”

Wang Xian stood up and looked towards the three Dan Realm experts in the air. His lips curved into a smile as he asked, “Is everyone here now?”

“I admire your fearless bravery!”

An old man from the Medical Saint Sect descended to the ground gradually and looked across Wang Xian’s group before continuing. “Fifty Inborn experts! Not too shabby. You are incredible to establish this powerful sect at just the age of twenty.

“However, what a shame! Flippant and insolent, ignorant and dauntless! Those who do not know fear are those who are dead!

“I’ll burn you to ashes!”

As the Supreme Elder of the Medical Saint Sect spoke, purplish flames started emitting from his body.

“Hehe. A floating island. It seems like you have inherited the legacy of the ancestral sect. It’s no surprise that you have risen so rapidly!”

Another Supreme Elder of the Medical Saint Sect looked around him and eventually focused on the island a short distance away. He squinted his eyes and excitement flashed in them.

A floating island was something that existed in the legends. It was extremely rare.

Huh?

The Laozu of Qiao Clan looked over and greed beamed in his eyes. He turned to Wang Xian and said, “You have enjoyed a meteoric rise but you will fall as rapidly. I’ll definitely annihilate you and your Dragon Sect after you offended the Qiao Clan and killed the disciple of our Qiao Clan!”

“Kill!”

All the disciples of the Qiao Clan shouted and released their stifling aura.

The experts from the other seven forces also shrouded their aura forward.

The terrifying aura and intense killing intent from the fifty Inborn experts even caused the rain to stop falling!

“All your fifty Inborn disciples and you are responsible for the death of my son and the disciples of our Medical Saint Sect. Today, all of you will die. I’m not going to let your Dragon Sect have a day of peace!” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Kill!”

The Sect Leader of the Medical Saint Sect glowered at Wang Xian. “It is impossible for us to live under the same sky after you killed my son!”

“Kill!” all the experts and disciples of the Medical Saint Sect shouted loudly. The aura of the experts shrouded towards Wang Xian.

The air above the entire island solidified.

It was as though there was a separate space. As rain fell on it, it dripped down towards the end.

“Haha! There’s no way you can go against us with just fifty Inborn experts! Today will be the day you die!”

The family head of the Wu Family pulled out his longsword with a hideous expression and stared harshly at Wang Xian.

“With just a meager fifty Inborn experts, you dare to announce you are going to annihilate us!”

A Half-Step to Dan Realm old man from the Qiao Clan shouted, “Leave no one alive!”

“Everyone, any feud can be resolved!” At this moment, a voice resounded from behind them.

Everyone was taken aback and immediately turned around.

Twenty people flew over. The one leading the group was an old man in the Sui Clan outfit.

The oldest son of Sui Huang, a Half-Step to Dan Realm expert.

The twenty experts from Sui Clan arrived and headed towards Wang Xian to the astonishment of the Qiao Clan and Medical Saint Sect.

They took a glance at Guan Shuqing and gave a friendly smile before turning to Wang Xian. “Dragon King, my father has asked us to come over. Keke!” the old man chuckled and summarized simply.

Huh?

Wang Xian was surprised. He had not expected Sui Huang to send twenty Inborn experts from the Sui Clan over.

For them to come here under such circumstances, it was equivalent to announcing to the world they were with the Dragon Sect.

A standoff between Sacred Sects like this was scarce.

A part of the reason is because of Shuqing. Nonetheless, this old man is pretty good!

Wang Xian chuckled, “When everything ends, I’ll head over personally to thank Sui Huang!”

The old man smiled and turned to face the Supreme Elders of the Medical Saint Sect and the Laozu of Qiao Clan. He bowed slightly and said, “Seniors, there’s no feud that can’t be resolved. Why do we have to resort to violence?”

“Sui Clan?”

The two Supreme Elders of the Medical Saint Sect and the Laozu of the Qiao Clan frowned. They glowered at them and replied, “This has nothing to do with your Sui Clan. Could it be that you want to be involved in this conflict?”

“I’m here on my father’s order and I’m really sorry about what happened. However, I feel that we could still sit down and talk about it!”

“Tsk! Sit down and talk about it? He dared to kill the disciples of our Medical Saint Sect. We have to take revenge for them. The Dragon Sect must be annihilated today. If the Sui Clan would like to be involved in this mess, don’t blame me when things turn ugly!”

The Sect Leader of the Medical Saint Sect stared at the group from the Sui Clan and continued, “Your Laozu isn’t here. With just you guys here, we just have more to kill!”

The group from the Sui Clan frowned and looked bitter. “In that case, we have no option but to offend you!”

“Seventy Inborn experts? Great! We just have to kill seventy Inborn experts!” exclaimed the Laozu of Qiao Clan coldly.

“What if you count our Xiao Clan in?”
