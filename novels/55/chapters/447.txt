Chapter 448: Sacred Sect: Dragon Sect (8)

The greyish mist from the tip of the umbrella had decadent vibes. They had originated from the decadent powers.

An attack that was from one’s bloodline.

The greyish decadent energy could substantially negate the opponent’s defense.

When the dragonian noticed the energy, contempt beamed in his eyes.

A stream of black aura was emitted from his hand and the dense black mist withstood the greyish decadent energy.

Bloodline? Hehe!

Dragonians had the strongest bloodline in the universe. The corpse-like bloodline wouldn’t be a match at all.

“What?” The ominous-looking young man was astonished. Even when facing the Young lord of Sea Serpent Island, he was calm and composed.

However, he was truly shocked by the young man who emitted black energy. Fear flashed in his eyes.

“Burst! Burst!”

At this juncture, an angry roar resounded.

The Flower Monk’s expression was filled with bloodlust. At the top of his head where there was a scar, a hideous image of an evil ghost could be vaguely seen.

His pale white face was covered in blood and he looked exceptionally terrifying.

A buddha bead flew towards the dragonian before him and exploded violently.

Creepy fresh blood was released from the exploded buddha beads and flew towards the dragonian like maggots which clung to corpses.

“Ominous spirits infiltration?”

The dragonian wasn’t alarmed at all as he charged forward.

The bloodthirsty aura penetrated into the body of the dragonian. However, the noble bloodline of the divine dragon was instantly triggered.

Weng!

The bloodthirsty aura was erased instantly.

“Shit!”

The Flower Monk, whose face was immersed in bloodthirsty aura, was astonished.

“I admit defeat. I admit defeat!”

“I admit defeat!”

“I admit defeat!”

At this moment, several people admitted defeat.

When the crowd around the arena looked to the stage, they were in awe.

The sixteen Inborn experts that had just appeared were all exceptionally powerful. With their immense physical body strength, they had forced these supreme talents to admit defeat.

The supreme talents that were previously standing on the arena with poise were now easily defeated.

This type of attack...!

Tang Yinxuan played her Hao Zhong. Each musical note and stream of water flow restricted the attacks of the dragonian before her. However, her expression was turning more and more solemn.

She was very familiar with this type of attack.

Her vision shifted to below the stage and she saw that young man smiling faintly. At this point, she couldn’t help but be surprised.

Weng!

As she waved her fingers, all the musical notes disappeared. Tang Yinxuan clasped her right fist with her left palm, facing the dragonian in front of her before jumping down from the arena.

Sss~

“This... How can this be possible?”

“Those young men that have appeared suddenly are too strong and terrifying!”

“Overwhelming... They were completely overwhelming. This group of people is too powerful!”

When the crowd looked across and saw one after another supreme talent admitting defeat, they were astonished.

“Look! The young lord of Sea Serpent Island, Flower Monk and the ominous-looking young man are all being overwhelmed!” At this moment, a teenager couldn’t help but exclaim. His eyes were wide open as he stared at the developments with disbelief.

“What? How can this be possible? Complete domination! How can they be completely dominated!”

“Putting Flower Monk and the ominous-looking young man aside, why would even the young lord of Sea Serpent Island be overwhelmed?”

“The sister of Miracle Doctor Wang is so strong. Look! Every time they clash, the young lord of Sea Serpent Island is knocked back several steps. The thick layer of ice has no effect on her at all!”

The crowd was shocked to witness this.

What incredible strength and tough weapon! How can this be possible? If she wasn’t lacking in battle experience...

The young lord of Sea Serpent Island looked extremely hideous. He gritted his teeth and the Ice Core round disc at his chest started spinning. A stream of chilling energy was transmitted to the Frozen Sorrows in his hands.

Swish!

The cold aura almost froze the air. Carrying chilling aura that could even freeze the earth, the young lord of Sea Serpent Island swung out his Frozen Sorrows.

“How can this be possible!”

As the chilling aura swept across Xiao Yu, cracks appeared on the tough arena structure and the air became stale.

However, she wasn’t affected at all. It was as though the chilling aura didn’t deal any damage to her at all.

Could it be the armor she’s wearing?

The young lord of Sea Serpent Island pulled a long face and his eyelids were twitching violently. His eyes were fixed on Xiao Yu’s bone sword and the black armor she was wearing.

Puff!

He took a deep breath and the Ice Core round disc at his chest started to spin once again.

Crack crack crack!

A layer of ice was gradually extended over his entire body.

From his arms to his legs, and eventually his head.

In the next instant, the young lord of Sea Serpent Island had turned into a statue of ice. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

The Frozen Sorrows in his hand seemed to have merged with his palm. The ice-cold seal had turned his body into a weapon.

“How insane! I can feel a deathly chill even when I’m so far away. The current young lord of Sea Serpent Island is probably peerless among the Pinnacle Inborn experts!”

“That’s too insane. Look! The ominous-looking young man and the Flower Monk have also undergone huge transformations!”

Below the stage, the crowd exclaimed in shock. The viewers over the Underworld website were also entirely attracted. Their eyes were opened wide as they stared at their screens, afraid of missing out on anything.

What they were seeing was too shocking.

“I can’t believe you have pushed me to this extent!”

The ominous-looking young man started turning white. His skin had lost its glow and was emitting decadent vibes.

The current ominous-looking young man was just like a ten thousand-year-old corpse. Deathly silent, decadent and creepily horrifying!

As for the Flower Monk, a stream of blood tears flowed to his chin. The hideous ghost on the scar at the top of his head stood up and emitted terrifying perversity.

Bloody red mist was being ejected from all parts of his body, making him look incomparably bloody.

The ominous-looking young man looked coldly towards the Flower Monk. From the vengeance he was emitting, no one knew how many people he had killed previously.

The two dragonians smiled faintly and dense dark aura emitted from their bodies. At the same time, their arms were undergoing a tremendous transformation.

Their palms grew over three to four times their initial size and turned into the claws of a beast.

“Interesting! A clash of bloodlines!”

The two dragonians purse their lips as they grabbed forward with their dragon claws.

This was the dragonians in their human form. With their current strength, they could dragonify their claws.

After dragonification, their palms would resemble the claws of the dragon and would be incomparably sharp.

As they grabbed forward, it felt as though they could rip the space apart.

“Bloodline! They are bloodline martial artists!”

“There are extremely few bloodline cultivators. However, they are common in Euramerica. They can even turn into beasts to launch their attacks!”

“Why do that ominous-looking young man and Flower Monk feel so evil?”

“Could it be...”

Some elders who had accompanied the disciples of their families and sects seemed to have recalled something. They became serious and some even felt fear creeping up on them.

“What a high-level bloodline? What kind of bloodlines are those?”

Feeling the energies from the dragon claws, the ominous-looking young man and Flower Monk shivered. They gritted their teeth and launched their decadent energies and bloodthirsty aura towards the dragon claws.

“Just admit your defeat!”

Two chilling calls resounded as the two dragonians grabbed towards the body of the ominous-looking young man and the Flower Monk respectively.
