Chapter 413: Get Over Here, All Of You

“Those who’ve received the round beads are all qualified to join the Mechanic Sect. Now, get over here, all of you who wish to join the Mechanic Sect. The Ancestral Sect is about to teach a fellow a lesson for humiliating us. We’ll give him a taste of our prowess!” Sun Longxuan said conceitedly.

His voice lingered throughout the entire banquet hall.

At his side, the two Saints from the Dark Sect watched with a faint smile.

They followed closely behind Sun Longxuan, an explicit display that they had his back.

As he lifted his head, Sun Longxuan took a glance at Wang Xian before placing his hands behind his back.

Given his father’s status as the richest man of the Southern Province, along with his cultivation status as a Half-step Inborn, as well as the support of two Inborn experts who were also the Saints of the Dark Sect, Sun Longxuan was convinced that many would join his Mechanic Sect.

This was no doubt a window of opportunity to many present.

Sun Longxuan’s words rang in everyone’s ears as every single person in the hall responded with a peculiar look on their faces.

Join the Mechanic Sect, and punish this Miracle Doctor Wang of Rivertown?

This... Was this seeking death, or insanity at play?

The crowd who received the Spherical Pearl were stunned and speechless before they threw it onto the table before them.

Given its comprehensive legacy for cultivation, strong support backing and ample Ancestral Sect resources, there were many who had wanted to join the Mechanic Sect. In particular, the Second-class families who were especially piqued.

However, the first thing to do now after joining the Mechanic Sect would be to form an enmity with Miracle Doctor Wang of Rivertown and teach him a lesson.

This sent everyone palpitating as if millions of horses had galloped on their hearts.

This was not the joining of Mechanic Sect, this was seeking death.

While you may have the support of two Saints from a Sacred Sect, this Miracle Doctor Wang of Rivertown was one who had even dared to kill an Elder of a Sacred Sect; hence what would it matter, even if you were a Saint...

Deafening silence filled the banquet hall, as no one dared to comment, much less stand up to join the Mechanic Sect.

The atmosphere was rather tense.

Sun Longxuan was dumbfounded. He cast a doubtful look across the banquet hall before lifting his brow in a frown.

What happened? Was it not just earlier when many were interested in joining my Mechanic Sect? How come no one has stepped forward?

“Haha!” Wang Xian laughed at the sight before turning to Sun Longxuan and throwing him a sarcastic remark. “There’s nothing wrong with referring to your Mechanic Sect as trash. Establishing grounds and founding Ancestral Sects, when not even one person wishes to join? If a person alone would suffice as an Ancestral Sect, then that’s pretty interesting!”

“You...,” Sun Longxuan uttered with a contorted look. With clenched fists, he stared coldly at Wang Xian before making a sweeping glance at everyone in the banquet hall. “This is your final chance. If you don’t grab hold of it, you can forget about joining my Mechanic Sect in the future, for good!” Sun Longxuan warned.

Everyone present was made speechless by his statement, which came with threatening intent.

Who would dare join the Mechanic Sect when you want to get rid of Miracle Doctor Wang of Rivertown even though you were just established? Would you not be after Sacred Sects in the future then?

Moreover, it remained to be seen if the Mechanic Sect could still exist in the future.

“Fine, alright then!” Sun Longxuan snapped with an overly bleak expression as he clenched his fists.

He had thought of many scenarios but did not expect this one in front of him now, where not even one person was willing to join.

He gritted his teeth and glared at Wang Xian with bloodshot eyes. “Do you know that you’re courting doom right now!” he snarled.

The two Saints from the Dark Sect arched their brows along with the comment as they stood beside Sun Longxuan before casting a look at Wang Xian.

“I’m also a relentless one when it comes to chasing answers. Hence I’d like to know, in what ways am I courting doom?” Wang Xian chuckled as he asked Sun Longxuan tauntingly.

“It’s rather interesting how you go about coercing people when they don’t wish to join your sect.” Lan Qingyue shot Sun Longxuan a dismissive look.

“Fine, alright then!” Sun Longxuan conceded with tight fists. “You’ve completely provoked me today!” he declared as veins began to protrude from his cheeks.

“Where’s Miracle Doctor Wang right now, Old Qin? Little did I expect him to really turn up! It’s such an honor for me. Please, introduce me to him!”

“I bet he’s in the banquet hall right now, haha! Let’s get going!”

Right then, a voice could be heard from the banquet hall reception.

Everyone heard it loud and clear, given the silence which filled the area.

Within the banquet hall, the crowd looked on with twisted expressions. Based on the voice, many had come to know that Mogul Sun was here and responded with odd looks on their faces.

To think that the father had asked to be introduced, to the one his son was about to challenge to a duel!

A group of more than a dozen men emerged from another room, and each and every one of them was a mogul of the cities they hailed from.

At the center was a rotund middle-aged man with very small eyes, who looked very shrewd.

With an air of prestige, this was none other than Mogul Sun of the Southern Province.

Along with him were Old Qin and members of the Lan Family.

“Huh?” Mogul Sun uttered. As he came into the banquet hall, he sensed the peculiarity in the atmosphere and swept his gaze across the floor with a slight frown.

When he saw that his son was livid, with a tinge of bloodthirst in his eyes, Mogul Sun hurried over with a puzzled expression.

“What’s wrong, Longxuan?” Mogul Sun asked, slanting his brow. “What’s wrong?” he nudged a second time, this time taking another look at his son.

“It’s nothing, Father!” Sun Longxuan replied with locked brows as he saw his father approaching. “I was just about to teach a reckless fellow a lesson!” he explained.

Behind Mogul Sun, Old Qin and the rest looked on with astonishment as well. They peered at Sun Longxuan before turning to face Wang Xian who was sitting in the forefront and had a bad premonition.

The group headed straight towards Wang Xian. “What’s wrong, Wang Xian?” they asked.

“It’s nothing!” Wang Xian excused himself without much concern. “There’s a hare-brained fellow here, saying he wants to teach me a lesson!” he added.

“This...,” Old Qin and the rest trailed off with an astounded look before turning over immediately to face the son of Mogul Sun.

Upon hearing the conversation, Mogul Sun returned with a startled expression and turned to look at his son with an intense glare.

The two Saints, who had been by Sun Longxuan’s side all this time, frowned upon hearing the conversation. They exchanged glances with a tinge of shock in their eyes.

“Father, wait till I maim that impudent fellow,” Sun Longxuan muttered softly to his father with a bleak expression.

“Shut up!”

Yet, Sun Longxuan had just ended his words when a low growl came from Mogul Sun, as he shushed his son with a burning glare.

“Father, you...,” Sun Longxuan began in confusion.

Smack!

Sun Longxuan was stunned. He had yet to finish his words when the slap from his father struck across his face.

“Dammit, are you blind?” Mogul Sun snapped, before jerking his head right back. As he looked at Wang Xian who stood beside Old Qin, he inhaled a deep breath.

“Miracle Doctor Wang, pardon my poor discipline that caused you this inconvenience!”

Mogul Sun walked over and bowed respectfully as he apologized with a tinge of fear in his eyes.

Based on his knowledge of this Miracle Doctor Wang of Rivertown, he knew that he was no kind soul.

Miracle Doctor Wang had become famous for his killings.

The wipeout of a First-Class force, the battle with Flame Palace, as well as the slaughtering of Sacred Sect Elders.

Along with numerous other titles, such as the top of the Outstanding Young Heroes Chart, Ninth on the Miracle Doctors Chart, Master Alchemist.

He was still most renowned for his barbarity and fearlessness.

Hence Mogul Sun, the richest man in the Southern Province, knew he meant nothing much in front of such a man.
