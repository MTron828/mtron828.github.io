“Sure!”

Wang Xian naturally didn’t have any objections to the Great Elder’s words. After all, he was going to gift it to the Lightning race. Since the great elder had made such a decision, he wouldn’t reject it.

“Hehe, alright. Take out the rest of the desolate beasts and reward me.”

The great elder nodded his head and looked at all the disciples in front of him who had heated eyes. A smile appeared on his face.

“Today, your eldest senior brother has taken out so many desolate beasts. The Thundercloud Vulture tribe will keep them and form a team of Thundercloud Vultures. At that time, the tribe will undergo an assessment. Those who succeed in the assessment can join and be rewarded with a thundercloud vulture mount.”

“As for the rest of the desolate beasts, all the disciples can go to the lightning refinement tower to undergo the assessment. As long as they can reach a certain rank, they will be rewarded with a desolate beast as a battle pet.”

“All of you have to thank eldest senior brother for his generosity. With so many desolate beasts, it is also a huge resource for our Thunder Ray Tribe.”

He said to all the disciples with a smile.

“It’s the Great Elder!”

“Thank you, eldest senior brother!”

Although the Thunder Cloud Vulture was arranged by the tribe, the disciples still had a chance to obtain it. As for the rest of the desolate beasts, their chances of obtaining them were even higher.

This caused all the disciples to look at Wang Xian with shock and respect.

Who in the Thunderlight clan could produce so many desolate beasts as mounts for their disciples?

Even the elders couldn’t do it.

However, their eldest senior brother had done it.

Especially that Thundercloud vulture desolate beast. It could allow their thunderlight clan to build a strong team of Thundercloud vultures.

There were more than 800 Thundercloud vultures. After taming them, there would be more and more thundercloud vultures in the future.

In the future, these Thundercloud vultures would be able to produce a few thousand of them.

This was not a small improvement for their Thundercloud tribe.

“Everyone, feel free. In the next half a month, I will be staying in the sparring grounds for a month. If anyone has any cultivation problems, you can come and look for me!”

Wang Xian said.

“It’s eldest senior brother!”

The group of disciples replied excitedly.

Following that, the group of disciples gathered for a meal. There were also some disciples who came up to perform some performances. It was a joyous occasion.

Wang Xian sat with the group of elders as they chatted and ate some food.

After the banquet that lasted for four hours, the group of elders waved goodbye to Wang Xian.

Next, they had to discuss the matter of the Thundercloud Vulture with the clan leader and the rest.

Wang Xian went straight to the place where the group of disciples were competing. He sat in the middle and gave pointers to the disciples on their cultivation problems.

“Eldest senior brother is so handsome. No matter what cultivation problems he has, he can’t be defeated. He’s Too Amazing!”

“Yeah, there are even disciples who broke through under his guidance. He’s too powerful. Why do I feel that he’s even more powerful than my grandfather!”

“That’s right. My great-grandfather is an elder. He guided me once. I feel that he’s not as clear as eldest senior brother!”

In the surrounding area, a group of thunder race disciples were discussing in a low voice. They looked at the figure in the arena with admiration. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

The eyes of some female disciples lit up. They were burning with passion.

“We can’t find out anything. He should have powerful concealment techniques of the Divine Dragon Race. However, I think that after obtaining the fire dragon bead, his strength should have increased significantly.”

At this moment, they were in the main hall of the Lightning race.

The chief of the Lightning race and the elders looked at the scene in front of them and locked onto Wang Xian, who was instructing his disciples.

Wang Xian took out more than a thousand desolate beasts and more than 800 Thundercloud vultures, which shocked all the experts of the Lightning race.

Even the chief was extremely curious.

Even he had no chance of obtaining so many Thundercloud vultures.

In the Thundercloud region, the talent of the Thundercloud vultures was not as good as their lightning race. They occupied a powerful grotto-heaven blessed land.

With the protection of the grotto-heaven blessed land, even a peak universe knight could forget about hunting them.

However, Wang Xian did it.

“From the looks of it, this disciple of Wang Xian is someone who knows how to repay kindness.”

The great elder opened his mouth and said with a smile.

The rest of the elders nodded their heads.

“I hope he can reach a higher level!”

The tribe leader also smiled with a look of anticipation in his eyes.

“Oh right, there’s a large-scale auction in the Divine Thunder city two months later. They invited US and many other cities and races to participate. The Second Great Elder is planning to send some items over for auction. Which one of you is going?”

The Lightning Race’s patriarch suddenly asked.

“Oh? Let’s go. Every auction in the Divine Thunder City will have many treasures. I wonder what treasures there will be this time!”

The first elder looked at the two elders beside him and said.

The patriarch nodded.

Every auction in the Divine Thunder City, in the Thunder Cloud Domain and even in the surroundings, was a very grand event.

In the past, there were even innate spiritual treasures in the auction held in the Divine Thunder City.

…

Time passed day by day. Wang Xian guided his disciples for a month.

A month later, he returned to his palace.

He turned on the universal AI to check the situation around him.

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz

Not long after, his fourth senior sister, Lei Yunzi, and the rest sent him a message.

When he saw this message, he was slightly taken aback.

“The auction in the Divine Thunder City?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows.

The messages that the girls sent him asked him if he was going to the auction in the Divine Thunder City.

Naturally, he wasn’t clear about this auction.

After opening the AI to search for it, he raised his eyebrows.

The Divine Thunder City was the strongest faction in the Thunder Cloud Domain other than the Thunder Ray race.

Divine Thunder City was a neutral force established by a few thunder attribute experts.

In the Thunder Cloud Domain, there was only one race, the Thunder Lightning race.

However, there were more than ten cities, and Divine Thunder City was the strongest.

Divine Thunder City was located at the edge of the Thunder Cloud Domain.

And the most famous place in Divine Thunder City was the Divine Thunder City auction.

As a neutral city, they used their advantage to invite the surrounding races to hold an auction.

Every time there was an auction, many races would come. There were also a lot of items being auctioned.

Every time there was an auction, the lightning race would send their experts over to send items and bid for them.

There were also a large number of disciples who went there to see if there were any treasures that they needed.

Among them, there were also disciples who liked to join in the fun.

“Divine Thunder City Auction? Can I eat the Connate Numinous Treasure in my hands?”

Wang Xian looked at the information of the auction with a contemplative look on his face.

If he could eat the innate numinous treasure in this auction, the resources obtained from selling the innate thunder bell would allow him to achieve a breakthrough.

“Let’s go and take a look. Even if I can’t eat it, I still have some desolate beasts and some acquired supreme treasures to sell in exchange for some resources.”

Wang Xian made up his mind and replied to them immediately.

After that, he searched for some other information to prepare for his next breakthrough.
