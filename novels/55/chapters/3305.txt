3306 3305. The strong preyed on the weak

Scorpion imperial city was a city shrouded in a poisonous fog. In this city, if there was no poison fog antibody or antidote, even a first level void God realm expert would not be able to survive here.

The entire Scorpion Imperial City’s air was filled with corrosive power.

“TSK tsk, some places in this heaven opening primal continent are indeed mystical.”

Wang Xian mumbled.

Such a place was not suitable for ordinary creatures to live in. Even if ordinary members of the Dragon Clan were to come here, their combat strength would drop a little.

“According to the records in the universe’s AI, every city in the Lich Kingdom is built on a small paradise. is the paradise here related to poison?”

He mumbled and continued to fly forward.

Half an hour later, he noticed signs of biological activity in the surroundings.

“Huh?”

All of a sudden, he sensed a blood trail spreading towards him.

This made him squint his eyes slightly and continue to walk forward.

“Catch him!”

When the blood trail came to Wang Xian’s feet, three voices suddenly sounded. He sensed three figures covered in a bloody poisonous fog attacking him.

The blood veins under his body rose up directly and formed a poisonous net that enveloped Wang Xian completely.

“A direct ambush?”

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly and swept his gaze over.

There were three liches. One of them had a human head and a lizard-like body.

His body was completely integrated with the surrounding environment.

One of them had a pair of wings. On his head, there were dozens of pairs of eyes.

The last one was like a giant python. It was over 10,000 meters long and was sweeping towards him.

Wang Xian stared at the creature that was attacking him. His eyes revealed a cold look.

Buzz

“Huh? Not Good!”

The Lich with dozens of pairs of eyes had a slight change in expression. He immediately roared in a low voice.

“You’re courting death!” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Wang Xian saw his strong alertness and revealed a surprised expression.

He waved his arm and the energy of the five elements directly restrained him.

“My Lord, spare my life! Spare my life!”

The three liches who were subdued in an instant saw this scene and their expressions changed drastically. They begged for mercy in horror.

“Soul capture!”

Wang Xian’s gaze focused as the three liches trembled.

Waves of information were transmitted into his mind.

As he absorbed this information, his eyes were sparkling.

“This heaven-splitting and primal continent is even crueler than the outside world!”

After more than ten minutes, he opened his eyes slowly and mumbled.

According to his understanding, these three fellows wanted to ambush and kill him.

And the reason was because the lich with the human head wanted his head.

It was that simple.

He wanted his head.

In the Lich Kingdom, the Lich clan had two ways of training.

One was to walk the path of pure witchcraft, in terms of magic.

But the Lich clan had more of the other.

They hunted powerful creatures and transferred the creature’s head, wings, tail, and eyes to their own bodies.

Through this method, they could strengthen themselves.

This was another way to strengthen one’s witchcraft. It was also the second path for Wizards.

This path was as powerful as pure witchcraft.

However, in order to reach the level of ancestral wizard, one’s physical body and witchcraft had to reach a terrifying level.

“They actually want my head.”

Wang Xian shook his head.

They realized that their heads were a little special, so they wanted to transfer their heads.

From their memories, Wang Xian also understood another point. In the wilderness of the heaven-splitting primordial lands, it was exceptionally dangerous.

Even the strong disciples of the Lich Kingdom would kill each other and plunder each other.

As long as they became stronger, they would be able to obtain more resources and a better place to cultivate.

In the Scorpion Imperial City, there was indeed a blessed land. One could cultivate a powerful poison body there.

However, one would have to pay a huge amount of resources to enter and cultivate there.

Wang Xian had some understanding of the information in the Scorpion Imperial City in his mind. He moved his body and continued to fly forward.

Not long after, a huge city within the poisonous fog appeared in his sight.

The entire city was huge. It used the mountain peaks as the city walls and looked mysterious from afar.

The poisonous fog in the surroundings was seeping out from here.

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly and continued flying in.

Scorpion Imperial City was an open city. Even outsiders could enter it.

Of course, if a large number of strangers entered, they would also be monitored.

Wang Xian entered alone and did not attract much attention.

When he entered the Scorpion King City, Wang Xian saw a large number of citizens of the Lich Kingdom.

All of them were powerful liches.

The entire Scorpion King City was like a zoo for different species.

All kinds of liches were put together and emitted all kinds of strange and evil auras.

Most of them were mainly dark and poisonous.

As Wang Xian flew above the city, he could smell the strong smell of blood.

“No wonder witches are called evil, mysterious, strange, and powerful. Some of the witches in the Scorpion Imperial City are indeed strange and Evil!”

Wang Xian mumbled to himself. This was because the way he trained was destined to be cruel and evil.

Whoosh

After flying for half an hour, he began to speed up.

The buildings in the entire scorpion imperial city were oddly shaped. Some of them were living in a nest.

Some of them were living in a strange wormhole.

There were very few buildings like humans.

“Let’s go to the center of the Scorpion Imperial City and take a look at the blessed land. Then, we will destroy this place!”

Wang Xian’s eyes revealed a sinister look.

This time around, he was here to destroy the Lich Kingdom. He would kill as many as he could.

Wang Xian did not show any mercy to these strange-looking creatures.

What they were after was the survival of the fittest. In that case, they would perish under the law of the Jungle!

Buzz

Near the center of the Scorpion Imperial City, a gigantic ball stood there.

The diameter of the ball was more than 100 million kilometers. On the ball, there were numerous holes of varying sizes.

There were experts entering and exiting these holes from time to time.

“Is this the poison nest of the Scorpion Imperial City? It’s a paradise that is connected to the heaven-opening and primal continent. All the poison barriers are overflowing from here.”

Wang Xian mumbled. With a movement, the Yin-yang dragon disk appeared around him.

The Yin and yang swirled and his figure slowly disappeared.

Wang Xian’s figure moved and flew straight into the cave.

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz

Just as he arrived in front of a cave entrance, a corrosive force suddenly attacked him.

“Huh?”

Wang Xian was slightly shocked when he saw this.

He was able to be discovered even though he was hiding in the yin-yang Dragon Plate!

This…
