Looking at Wang Xian walking out of the learning field and ignoring his words, Duan Qingwen looked extremely embarrassed.

In the Demon Hunter College, there was a team leader in each class. The team leader was the strongest person in the class and had a lot of authority.

Similarly, as a team leader, there were many benefits. For example, it was easy to recruit members when establishing a mercenary group.

Seeing that Wang Xianniao didn’t even care about him, Duan Qingwen’s expression was extremely ugly.

“Captain, don’t bother about that fellow. He’s probably preparing to hide. Hehe, he offended the young master’s mercenary group. He won’t be able to stay in the demon Hunter Academy for Long!”

“That’s right. I bet that he will leave the Demon Hunter Academy within a week at most. This fellow is too arrogant. Now that the young master’s mercenary group has already posted the news on the Academy’s Forum, this fellow is finished!”

A few young men in the class saw Duan Qingwen’s ugly expression and quickly spoke up.

“HMPH, let’s ignore this fellow!”

Duan Qingwen said coldly with a gloomy face.

Wang Xian walked out of the learning field and headed straight out of the academy.

He came to the demon hunters academy mainly because he could obtain some missions and news that he couldn’t obtain outside the academy. This would be very beneficial to the development of the Celestial Phoenix mercenary group.

As for learning, there were some things that he could learn, but most of them were useless to him.

Therefore, it was impossible for Wang Xian to stay in the academy all the time.

Walking out of the academy, Wang Xian looked around. There were students from the demon hunters academy who were holding weapons. Some of them were walking out of the academy, while others came back from the academy.

Some of them were riding powerful ferocious beasts and were wearing armor. They looked extraordinary.

There were also more than a dozen people, both male and female. They were all senior students.

Wang Xian quickened his pace and walked outside. When he reached the entrance of the academy, he saw Father Zhou waiting by the door.

“Commander Wang, all your resources have been sold. All the spirit stones are in the interspatial ring!”

Father Zhou also saw Wang Xian and walked over immediately. He said respectfully.

“Alright, Thank You!”

Wang Xian nodded his head.

“No need, no need. Captain Wang, if you have time, I’ll treat you to a meal!”

Father Zhou said politely.

“No need. I still have some matters to attend to. Let’s have a meal together sometime!”

Wang Xian shook his head.

“Alright, Alright!”

Father Zhou nodded his head hurriedly and waved his hand at Wang Xian.

Wang Xian nodded his head with a smile and took out the key given by teacher Ma.

He looked at the address on the key and said, “The distance is very close. Not Bad, not bad!”

Wang Xian looked at the street in front of him and walked along the wall of the demon hunters academy towards the right.

After walking for about a thousand meters, Wang Xian entered an alley. There were many houses inside.

The houses had their own courtyards and looked very luxurious.

“Houses that can be built near the demon Hunters Academy are not cheap. This house is worth at least 10,000,000 middle-grade spirit stones!”

Wang Xian walked to a green wooden door. Looking at the door number in front of him, he opened the door directly.

A courtyard was at least 100 square meters.

It was a three-story small building. He pushed the door open and entered. It was extremely luxurious inside.

Wang Xian looked around with a satisfied expression. He took out his communication stone plate and called Ao Jian and the rest over.

Looking at the time, it was already noon. Wang Xian walked out directly.

Not far away was the main street of the Eastern District. Wang Xian found a random restaurant and sat down.

After dinner, Ao Jian and the rest arrived. Wang Xian asked them to find a house to live in next to their house.

After settling everything, Wang Xian walked into the demon Hunters Academy.

“Eh, that’s the freshman who didn’t give young master any face by hiring a gang!”

“It’s really him. He’s really bold. He doesn’t know how to hide!”

“Where can he hide? TSK TSK, beating him up is equivalent to 10,000 middle-grade spirit stones. If I can beat him up, I will beat him up more than a dozen times!”

“He’s at least at transcendent level three. He can be ranked in the top ten among the freshmen!”

Just as he passed through the area under the shade of the trees, Wang Xian saw three to four young men pointing at him.

Wang Xian looked over and raised his eyebrows slightly. He ignored them and continued walking inside.

The Demon Hunter College was very big. Wang Xian quickened his pace.

“In the afternoon, the instructor asked us to familiarize ourselves with the Demon Hunter College. Everyone can take a look around!”

“Hey, Hey, look, it’s him!”

“It’s really him. A new student who just entered the academy has already become popular in our academy. TSK TSK, I’m really envious!”

“What’s there to be envious about? This kid is going to be unlucky soon!”

At this moment, a hundred students walked out from a learning field beside them. A young man who was standing at the front spoke to the students.

At this moment, the students who saw Wang Xian suddenly spoke in surprise.

The young man who was standing at the front was slightly taken aback. He looked at Wang Xian and narrowed his eyes slightly.

Although it was only a day since the new students entered the academy, more than half of the students of the Demon Hunters Academy knew about Wang Xian’s reputation.

This was especially so for the mission issued by the young master’s mercenary group on the Communication Stone Forum.

“Not only will I get 10,000 middle-grade spirit stones if I defeat this guy, I will also gain a great reputation!”

The eyes of the young man who was standing at the front flickered. His body suddenly moved and appeared in front of Wang Xian in an instant.

“Huh?”

Wang Xian frowned slightly when he saw a young man suddenly blocking in front of him.

“Eh, what is the captain doing?”

“Could it be? is the captain going to beat him up?”

“Haha, I support the Captain. If we beat him up, not only will we get a reward of 10,000 middle-grade spirit stones, we will also be able to make a name for ourselves in the first grade!”

“That’s right, class eight is the strongest. Captain, teach him a lesson!”

When the students behind saw their captain making a move, they were excited and shouted loudly.

The young man smiled and looked at the students behind him. He raised his hand indifferently and said, “Wait for me to earn 10,000 middle-grade spirit stones. I’ll treat everyone to a good meal!”

“Haha, I Support Our Leader. beat him up!”

“Our leader’s strength is definitely one of the best among our peers. He has a transcendent tier 3 weapon, a transcendent Tier 3 armor, and a supporting weapon!”

“Captain, he has also made our grade one class three famous!”

At the back, a group of students surrounded him excitedly.

“Hehe!”

Upon hearing the students’words, the young man raised his head slightly. The corner of his mouth curled up as he looked at Wang Xian who was in front of him. “Kid, your strength is not bad. Come, let’s Spar!”

“There’s no time. Move aside!”

Wang Xian looked at the young man’s provocation. There was a hint of impatience in his eyes as he said directly.

“Get out of the way. If you defeat me, then get out of the way. What’s the matter? You Dare to fight with a senior and you don’t dare to accept my challenge? Are you scared? This is so boring. Why Don’t you let me beat you up and I’ll Let You Leave?”

The young man said mockingly with a face full of strong confidence.

“Scram!” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

A hint of impatience flashed past Wang Xian’s eyes as he dashed forward.

“Hehe, I want 10,000 middle-grade spirit stones!”

The young man smiled when he saw Wang Xian making a move. He clenched his fist and dashed forward.

Boom

Wang Xian also stretched out his fist to meet the young man’s attack. The powerful force collided violently!
