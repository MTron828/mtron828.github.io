Chapter 769: The outcome of 0770’s finger-pointing

Translator: 549690339

“Bang!”

A gigantic creature suddenly appeared on the surface of the sea in front of Wang Xian.

Everyone was slightly stunned as they looked at the creature that had been killed.

“This, this...”

All of a sudden, the pupils of Cheng Qingcheng, the young chief of the Thunder clan, and the people from the Fengyan Celestial sect could not help but constrict. A look of horror appeared on their faces.

“Water-traced horned beast, it’s a water-traced horned beast!”

The scalps of the two people from the immortal sect turned numb as they stared at this gigantic creature with shock on their faces.

“Roar!”

The Thunder Beast that the young clan leader of the Thunder clan sat on lay on the ground and growled in fear.

Even though this creature had already been killed, its terrifying pressure still caused the Thunder Beast to tremble, and its eyes were filled with fear.

“Huala!”

Soon after, under everyone’s shocked gazes, a red-clothed woman drilled out from the bottom of the sea.

A flame danced between the woman’s brows, and a faint flame flashed past her body.

She had a perfect appearance, and her body had an imposing aura that seemed to rule the world.

This aura was extremely dense, as if a goddess from the nine heavens had descended upon the mortal world.

Especially the flame between her eyebrows. It was filled with majesty, as if it was her third eye.

It was completely incomparable to the red dot that was placed between her eyebrows with an item.

The flame between the eyebrows of the lady flickered and gradually disappeared.

“Phew!”

Guan Shuqing controlled her physical body once again. She looked at Wang Xian with a smile on her face.

The instant pressure turned into an instant smile. This change in temperament made everyone’s heart flutter.

“Xiao Xian!”

Guan Shuqing looked at Wang Xian and walked over with a smile. She held his arm and glanced at the newly appeared Piao linxue.

“HMM, are you alright?”

Wang Xian looked at Guan Shuqing and asked her.

“I’m fine. Look, I even killed a creature in the water. Its strength has reached the level of an immortal God!”

Guan Shuqing pointed at the monster’s corpse and said with a smile.

“Okay!”

Wang Xian nodded his head. When Feng Luan possessed a physical body, she could unleash the terrifying strength of a superior immortal. Killing an ordinary immortal god was a piece of cake.

“Hiss!”

However, Guan Shuqing and Wang Xian’s words made everyone around them gasp.

This was especially so for the people from the Fengyan Celestial sect and the Thunder clan. Initially, they were still uncertain. Now that they heard it with their own ears, they widened their eyes.

They knew that the lowest water-traced horned beast had the terrifying strength of a half-step immortal God.

From the terrifying pressure of this water-traced horned beast, they guessed that it was most likely an immortal God level existence.

However, they didn’t dare to be certain, nor did they dare to believe it.

Now that they heard it with their own ears, they couldn’t help but swallow a mouthful of saliva.

To be able to kill an immortal-level water-traced horned beast, he must be at least a middle-level immortal! A middle-level immortal!

This was a middle-level immortal!

That Girl was a middle-level immortal?

This made everyone dumbfounded!

However, what was the strength of the young man who was being held by that girl.

“An immortal-level creature!”

In the surroundings, the other disciples of the immortal sect let out low roars. Their eyes were filled with fear and fear.

Wang Xian looked at the water-striped horned beast. With a wave of his arm, he stored it directly into his interspatial ring.

He slowly raised his head and looked at the young man on the Thunder Beast.

In an instant, the young chief of the Thunder clan felt his scalp tingling. He looked at Wang Xian with an embarrassed expression and felt a little nervous.

The surrounding people also looked over hurriedly.

Just now, this mysterious young man asked the young chief of the Thunder clan not to pester the girl beside him. In the end, the young chief of the Thunder Clan said that he didn’t have the right to criticize him!

And now, a goddess who was a middle-level immortal was leaning against the young man’s side.

In addition to the group of Heaven’s favorites and beauties who looked respectful, there was a high possibility that he was an immortal god.

Talking to an immortal God like that was simply courting death!

Under everyone’s gaze, the young clan leader of the Thunder clan was a little nervous. Especially under the gaze of Wang Xian, his heart was beating violently.

“It’s forbidden for an immortal-level Powerhouse to make a move. Furthermore, this is Ji Ding’s territory!”

He gritted his teeth and stared at Wang Xian as he said in embarrassment.

When the surrounding people saw the young clan leader of the Thunder clan holding on, they also silently thought that he had a backbone.

Just as he said, it was forbidden for an immortal-level Powerhouse to make a move, especially since this was the Thunder clan’s territory, Ji Ding’s territory.

The young clan leader of the Thunder clan was the most outstanding disciple of the current generation of the Thunder clan. Even if he didn’t provoke the immortal, the immortal wouldn’t be able to do anything to him!

Wang Xian looked at him and smiled. Ripples appeared under his feet.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

At this moment, a group of DRAKONIDS who had been at the bottom of the sea moved and emerged from the bottom of the sea.

There were ten DRAKONIDS and ten infant stage powerhouses.

The moment they appeared, the young clan leader of the Thunder clan’s expression changed drastically.

“What are you trying to do?”

He stared at Wang Xian and shouted loudly.

“Are you trying to tell me what to do? Then let’s kill them all!”

Wang Xian looked at the young clan leader of the Thunder clan and said coldly.

When everyone around heard Wang Xian’s words, their expressions changed slightly.

Even though the immortals forbade them from making a move, it didn’t mean that his subordinates couldn’t make a move. These ten infant stage powerhouses were enough to put the Thunder clan in a desperate situation.

“Ahhhh!”

However, at this moment, just as everyone thought that the ten experts who had crawled out from the bottom of the sea were about to make a move...

A figure emitting white light suddenly appeared behind the young clan leader of the Thunder clan.

Four rays of white light flashed across the figure’s body, and a terrifying force heavily landed on the Thunder Beast.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

The Thunder Beast let out a miserable cry, its huge body slowly lying on the surface of the water, sinking downwards.

The Thunder clan’s young clan leader, who was on the Thunder Beast, also fell towards the bottom of the sea with a face full of fear. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Young clan leader!”

The expressions of the surrounding thunder clan disciples changed drastically, and they hurriedly picked up the Thunder clan’s young clan leader’s body.

“This, this... If you don’t seek death, you won’t Die!”

“It’s true. You Dare to be so arrogant to an immortal god, and you even said that you don’t have the right to criticize him. After that, you didn’t apologize. Now that your limbs have been chopped off, your life is over!”

“You have guts, but you provoked an immortal God first. If you don’t apologize, you’re courting death!”

“Having your limbs chopped off, I reckon that the Thunder clan wouldn’t care about this matter. Hehe, I’ve always heard that the young clan leader of the Thunder clan is extremely arrogant. Today, he knows the consequences of being arrogant!”

When the surrounding crowd saw young clan leader Lei’s four limbs being chopped off, they revealed gloating expressions.

Riding on the Thunder Beast, they looked down on everyone with an air of superiority.

In the beginning, they had said that the Lord Immortal God did not have the qualifications to compete with him. Now, with a flick of his finger, he could cripple your four limbs.

This was the consequence of being arrogant!

When the Thunder clan disciples saw the dumbstruck and despairing young clan leader Lei’s expression, they were also extremely embarrassed.

However, they didn’t dare to say anything. They didn’t even dare to say that they wanted revenge. In fact, after the Thunder clan found out about this matter, there was a very high chance that they would just let it go.

This was because the girl beside him was a middle-level immortal, and that young man was very likely a middle-level immortal, or even higher!
