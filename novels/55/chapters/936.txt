Chapter 937: 0938, this is our territory

Translator: 549690339

In the dark and gloomy Qiulin Beast Park, four middle-aged men stared at Wang Xian with a slightly embarrassed expression.

After entering the Qiulin Beast Park, the Celestial Phoenix mercenary group still didn’t put up any alert around them. They couldn’t sit still anymore.

This concerned their lives.

Wang Xian saw their expressions and frowned slightly. He stood up from the carriage and said, “Don’t worry, everyone. We have our own alert method. There won’t be any problems!”

“Surveillance method? What kind of surveillance method can you guys have while sitting on the horses?” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

A few middle-aged men glanced at Wang Xian and the rest with a displeased expression.

All of them were sitting on the carriage. What kind of surveillance method could there be?

“HMM? What’s Wrong?”

At this moment, the young man from the central carriage came out from the carriage and looked at the four middle-aged men with a puzzled expression.

“Young master, we entered the Beast Park of the bridge forest and hoped that they would hire a team to send people to guard the surroundings. However, they said that they have a way to do so. We are a little worried!”

The four middle-aged men said hurriedly.

“Commander Wang, we are going to cross the Beast Park of the bridge forest. We are not joking. If we are not on guard, what if a ferocious beast suddenly appears in front of us? What if it eats us and destroys our spiritual herbs?”

The Young Man’s face turned ugly instantly. He spoke directly to Wang Xian with great dissatisfaction.

“Since we, the Celestial Phoenix mercenary group, have accepted your mission, we can guarantee that we will complete it. We have already set up a perimeter around the area. Everyone, just leave in peace!”

Wang Xian assured them once again.

With Ao Yao and the rest around, their safety was definitely beyond their imagination.

However, he couldn’t let ao Yao and the rest be exposed.

“Don’t worry, how can we be at ease? This is the Bridge Forest Beast Park, and it concerns the lives of all of us. How can we be at ease? As a golden mercenary group, don’t you know how to carry out missions in the wild?”

The young man scanned his surroundings with an unpleasant expression.

“Hey, our lives are precious. Your mercenary group better be more serious. Otherwise, we will file a complaint against you when we arrive!”

A girl’s head popped out from the carriage and said to Wang Xian angrily.

Wang Xian frowned and gestured to Ao Jian and the rest. “Two in the front, two in the back!”

“Yes!”

The four Golden Swordfish immediately got down from the carriage and spread out.

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian said to the four middle-aged men expressionlessly.

“What attitude?”

The young man was a little dissatisfied with Wang Xian’s attitude as he said coldly.

“Let’s Go!”

The four middle-aged men looked at each other and nodded. They didn’t want to get into a conflict with the mercenary group.

If they really got into a conflict, it wouldn’t be beneficial to them.

The carriage continued to move forward. Soon, night arrived. The entire area turned dark and was filled with moisture.

However, the darkness did not affect the extraordinaires much. They continued to move forward.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

All of a sudden, roars came from the front.

The expressions of the four middle-aged men changed drastically. “Oh no, it’s the roar of a powerful ferocious beast. Stop it now!”

Wang Xian swept his gaze over. A strange glint flashed in his eyes. “Proceed forward. There won’t be any problems!”

“Captain Wang, it’s better to be safe than sorry. I’ll have to trouble you to send your men to investigate!”

A few middle-aged men said to Wang Xian with an unpleasant expression.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded his head faintly. He sat on the carriage and did not move.

“This...”

When the middle-aged men saw that Wang Xian was unmoved, they looked at each other with a hint of coldness in their eyes.

However, the roars of the ferocious beasts soon disappeared. After a few minutes of stagnation, the carriage continued to move forward.

On the way, there were no obstructions and no ferocious beasts came to disturb them.

This made the four middle-aged men let out a sigh of relief. They thought to themselves that they were really lucky.

Following that, they glanced at Wang Xian and the rest with displeasure.

“We are about to cross the Bridge Forest Beast Park. We are very lucky!”

A middle-aged man said loudly with a smile on his face.

In less than ten minutes, they drove out of the huge forest. Outside was a stretch of yellow soil.

They were basically safe after arriving here.

The carriage rested for more than ten minutes before continuing forward. Four hours later, a city wall appeared in everyone’s sight.

Bridge Forest Town was similar to holy sea town, and both were important towns.

“We’re here, we’re finally here, Haha!”

“Let’s go, I’ll treat you all to a good meal tonight!”

Everyone’s faces were filled with excitement. The young man also came out of the carriage and stood on it, laughing loudly.

“Young master, the President is waiting for us at the East Gate. Our harvest this time is huge!”

A middle-aged man said excitedly.

“Haha! That’s right!”

The young man was also full of pride. This time, his father would definitely reward him well.

“Let’s go into the city!”

It was already around seven o’clock in the evening. Some mercenary groups were returning from the outside.

When they saw the horse carriage of the Wang Xian Bridge Forest Chamber of Commerce, they immediately made way.

Wang Xian was also full of smiles. Although the journey was a little unpleasant, they arrived successfully.

With seven million middle-grade spirit stones in hand, this escort was totally worth it.

Moreover, Ao Yao and the rest had also killed an extraordinary seventh-grade ferocious beast midway.

“Haha, Feng ‘Er, not bad, not bad at all. You’ve done well!”

At this moment, a carefree voice was heard. A burly middle-aged man dressed in a white long robe walked up with a smile on his face.

Behind him were more than ten middle-aged elders.

“Father, Hehe, our luck isn’t bad this time!”

The youth walked down from the carriage with a face full of smiles and said with a smile.

“Haha, Luck is also a part of strength!”

The middle-aged man said with a loud laugh.

“Young master Feng, let’s move the raging flame flower to prevent them from dying!”

An elder said with a smile and waved at the people behind him.

“Okay, take a look and see if there are any dead!”

The young man said with a smile.

“Okay, young master Feng!”

The old man walked to the carriage and opened one box after another.

“Huh?”

However, soon, the old man’s face darkened.

“Old Hong, what’s going on?”

The middle-aged man saw that the old man’s face was not good, so he frowned and asked, “Is there a problem with the flame flower?”

“Pa!”

The old man slowly nodded and opened another box. “More than half of them died!”

“What? More than half of them died?”

When the young man heard the old man’s words, his face immediately turned ugly, and he hurriedly ran over.

“How... how did so many of them die?”

The young man saw that many of the flame flowers that had been preserved in the box no longer had any flames on them, which meant that they were dead.

The flame flowers were worth around fifteen million middle-grade spirit stones, and the remaining sixty million middle-grade spirit stones were already considered good enough.

Moreover, the commission for this mission was seven million middle-grade spirit stones.

This caused the young man’s expression to change drastically.

“The flame flowers themselves are very difficult to preserve. It’s inevitable that more than half of them will die!”
