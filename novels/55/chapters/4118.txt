Chapter 4119 - 4119: 4118 was injured

Translator: 549690339

In the sky above the water source.

A space weapon that looked like a war machine slowly appeared!

Void Tower.

The war weapon of the Void Royal Family of the Void Universe!

The void tower was the strongest weapon in the Void universe.

It was able to give the powerhouses of the Void universe a huge boost in the power of space!

Duke Xining summoned the Void Pagoda and they entered the Void Pagoda directly.

The huge power of space caused the surrounding water flow to stop.

The Void Pagoda erupted with a terrifying energy.

As the sovereign of the Void Royal Family, their Void Pagoda was second only to the void royal family’s King!

Duke Tianmen and Duke Xining entered the Void Pagoda. They stared at the direction where Wang Xian escaped and injected energy into it.ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The void pagoda trembled and disappeared instantly!

The energy in the Void Pagoda was extremely powerful. It would be very obvious in the six paths universe.

However, at this moment, Duke of Heaven’s Gate and Duke of Xining clearly had the intention to kill Wang Xian.

They did not hesitate to get rid of Wang Xian by the powerhouses of the six paths universe.

Furthermore, they were also betting.

They were betting that the powerhouses of the six paths universe would not be able to discover them.

They were betting that they would be able to kill Wang Xian before the fate of the six paths universe discovered them!

They had the same confidence.

With the help of the powerful Void Pagoda, the distance that they could teleport was twice the distance that they could teleport on their own!

Wang Xian was flying rapidly in front of them.

However, this time, in just over ten minutes, the information of the powerhouses of the Void universe was displayed on the empty text compass!

This gave Wang Xian a slight shock.

“Eh? How is this possible? How did they rush over so quickly this time? How is this possible?”

Wang Xian’s expression changed slightly when he saw this information!

Buzz

At this very second, he realized that the void universe’s powerhouses were very close to them.

“They used a powerful treasure! ”

Wang Xian’s heart sank when he saw this. His expression changed slightly as he quickly performed the transformation of the Netherworld Dragon!

After the transformation, Wang Xian swept his gaze behind him. He unleashed his full strength and flew rapidly towards the bottom of the water source.

The three Netherworld Ghost Avatars flew towards the surroundings separately!

Boom! Boom! Boom

At the back, Duke of Heaven’s Gate saw that Wang Xian had changed his direction again. He sneered and immediately changed his direction to continue his pursuit!

The gigantic void pagoda was like a terrifying monster that was wreaking havoc in the water domain.

Even an expert at the peak of the Universe Overlord realm would feel terrified when he saw it!

“What is that? What is that? Why is it so terrifying?”

(‘I don’t know. That thing looks so terrifying and the energy it is emitting is also very peculiar. Are they invaders from other universes?”

“Absolutely. They actually dare to be so arrogant in our six paths universe! ”

Void Pagoda was teleporting, and when it tore through the sky and appeared in another area.

At a location not far away, a group of Great Beings’ disciples from the six paths universe looked at Void Pagoda with shocked expressions.

They were all shocked and angry as they spoke loudly!

It had been tens of millions of years since the birth of the ultimate treasure of Tianyuan in the six paths universe!

Many powerful tribal disciples from the six paths universe also knew about this news.

Now that they saw this terrifying void pagoda, they naturally thought that it was an intruder from outside.

They were naturally filled with anger towards the intruder.

They immediately sent this news to the tribal experts and leaders!

Buzz! Buzz

“It’s happening again! ”

Ten minutes later, Wang Xian’s expression sank again. Another message was sent from the empty text compass!

The experts from the Void universe were still chasing after him at a terrifying speed.

After all, the transformation of the Netherworld Dragon was not an ordinary ability. It could not be used without restrictions.

Just now, it was very easy to use it once every hour.

However, using it once every ten minutes now consumed a lot of energy!

In the end, it would require some recovery and could not be used!

“This void universe has used a powerful treasure. I have to reach a tribe as soon as possible. However, according to the information in my mind, the nearest tribe will also require half a month! ” Wang Xian’s expression was a little ugly.

“Lin Niu, you take the resources and leave First! ”

He immediately transmitted his voice to Lin Niu.

With the increase in his strength, the ancestral tree had also received a significant increase after absorbing the energy from his body.

The soul-returning wood on the ancestral tree now had an ability.

That was, after he was killed, it could bring his corpse back to the Dragon Palace!

Even if Wang Xian was in another universe.

This was the power of the Heaven’s origin treasure of Destiny!

However, there was also a prerequisite that Wang Xian’s corpse could not be suppressed instantly.

In other words, if Wang Xian was killed and his corpse was suppressed by the energy, this ability would lose its effect.

However, even if it lost its effect, Wang Xian’s soul could still be pulled into the ancestral tree.

It was just that he would lose a body!

However, the loss of a body was extremely huge for Wang Xian.

At the very least, the Dragon Palace did not have any energy at the moment. Hence, they were able to regain their current strength.

Fortunately, Wang Xian had killed a strong person with the darkness attribute who was in the Heaven’s origin creation stage.

This was a huge amount of energy.

Therefore, Wang Xian ordered Lin Niu to take the corpse and leave first.

Lin Niu should not have been locked on!

“It’s boss!”

Lin Niu hesitated for a moment before gritting his teeth and nodding his head.

He knew that this was the best choice at the moment.

Staying behind would not be of much help.

Lin Niu flew out from the mother nest and flew in another direction at a rapid speed!

Wang Xian continued flying forward!

“It won’t be that easy to kill me!”

He mumbled and took out a communication device with a flick of his palm!

This communication device was the communication device of an expert from the water source of the six paths universe. It was obtained by him.

The communication device of the six paths universe was similar to that of the nine paths universe.

Through this communication device, one could communicate and even upload images.

It wasn’t difficult when it came to technology. As long as an expert from the Heaven’s origin realm studied it, he would be able to create it.

It was just like how a weak Earth could create the Internet!

In addition, the communicator in his hand was obtained from a universe master level great being.

He took the communicator and immediately sent out information one by one!

Ten minutes later, when the spatial compass once again sensed a void space universe great being, his body stopped there!

Buzz

In less than ten seconds, a piece of void space behind him was torn apart.

Space was torn apart!

The surrounding seawater surged towards the surroundings!

An incomparably huge void pagoda appeared in his line of sight.

When Wang Xian saw this void pagoda, his gaze was slightly focused.

“So it’s directly using the Void Pagoda of the Void Universe. This is a powerful war weapon. ”

Wang Xian mumbled as he took out his communication device and recorded the entire scene!

In the next instant, he transformed into the Netherworld Dragon again and left!
