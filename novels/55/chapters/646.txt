Chapter 647: A Sweep

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Illusory Dragons Explosive Crunch!”

Wang Xian flexed his muscles and over a hundred Water Divine Dragons appeared around him.

Each and every Water Divine Dragon charged towards and attacked the Manta Ray King.

Bam! Bam! Bam!

The Manta Ray King stared intensely at the overwhelming number of Water Divine Dragons around him. Swinging its tail across, countless Devil’s Whips appeared and slapped towards the Water Divine Dragons.

The illusory figures that were formed from water energy were destroyed instantly.

“This guy is too strong!”

Wang Xian’s expression changed drastically.

“Edgeless Blade!”

At this moment, Wang Xian could hear Roving Sword’s roar. A huge sword smashed towards the Manta Ray King directly.

“F*ck! You guys deserve to die!”

The Manta Ray King growled furiously once again and was sent smashing downwards after being hit by the Edgeless Blade.

At this very moment, the vast sea that was below the Manta Ray King previously was now blasted to a patch of pitch-black sea bed. There were also countless fish that were tumbling on the seabed.

The majority of them were now dead!

“Surrender!”

Wang Xian pulled a long face as he spoke. The sea region that was in the air and which spanned ten kilometers changed drastically. A water sword that was over a hundred meters smashed towards the Manta Ray King at the bottom of the sea!

It was as though a terrifying rain of swords was falling down.

“Grr... Grr... Just you wait!”

The Manta Ray King extended its wings and revealed the countless wounds on it. It used its wings to shield its head, and its blood-red eyes were locked on Wang Xian. The next instant, it flew towards the faraway sea region.

Wang Xian’s eyebrows knitted together instantly as the seawater in the sky smashed towards the ground.

Rumble!

Roving Sword turned back into his human form from his golden swordfish form and moved towards Wang Xian with a solemn look.

“Dragon King, that Manta Ray is really strong. I’m not a match for it. If we based it on the classification of Yong Chang world, it should be a middle-class Immortal!”

“It’s really strong and highly intelligent!”

Wang Xian’s eyebrows knit together. When fighting together with Roving Sword, they were barely able to suppress the Manta Ray King. If Roving Sword was to fight along, all he could do was flee.

“The creatures in the open sea are truly terrifying. If it flew to shore, it would be able to destroy an entire city easily!”

Wang Xian heaved a sigh while looking below him.

The seawater fell back into the sea and was tumbling constantly.

From a far distance away, Roving Heavens, Roving Lobster and the rest were swimming towards Wang Xian rapidly.

“What’s the situation here?” Wang Xian asked Roving Sword.

“Dragon King, this is truly a treasure ground. There are a large number of pure blood corals in this place. Other than that, there’s a type of spiritual medicine known as Devil Cloud Bead. The Devil Cloud Bead would be greatly useful for devil attribute cultivators!”

Roving Sword gave Wang Xian an introduction. “For races in the sea, the largest race would be the Manta Ray. This species of fish is extremely violent and will attack any living creature. The Manta Ray King was acting as such a while ago. Once it saw us, it attacked us the next instant!

“Other than the Manta Ray race, there’s another small race. They were a type of mystical sea demons and exceptionally cunning!”

“Oh? Sea demons? There are other races in this region where there is an Immortal-class creature?”

Wang Xian felt a little curious.

“That group of sea demons is extremely cunning. They could even avoid my pursuit and the Manta Ray King might not be able to catch them either!” Roving Sword explained to Wang Xian.

“Is that right?”

Wang Xian nodded his head and his eyebrows soon knitted together. “It’s getting a little troublesome now. If that Manta Ray King wishes to flee, we have no way of killing it at all. Moreover, with its intelligence, it is clear that it wouldn’t surrender!”

“It would be a little difficult to occupy this place!” Roving Sword seconded.

Although Roving Sword had just entered the Immortal Realm, his strength, and especially his attacking prowess, wasn’t something that lower-class Immortals could match.

It was the same for Wang Xian. After transforming into his divine dragon form, his strength would also be a lot stronger than a lower-class Immortal.

They were barely able to suppress the Manta Ray King when they fought together. It would be impossible for them to kill it.

“If we can’t occupy this place, let’s sweep through this place!”

The edge of Wang Xian’s lips curved upwards as he remarked, “Take all the treasures of this place along!”

“Dragon King!”

“Dragon King!”

Roving Heavens and the remaining members of the Dragon Palace arrived and greeted Wang Xian respectfully.

“Let’s go! Follow me!”

Wang Xian saw many Devil Monkeys holding pure blood corals in their hands with many others holding black beads the size of a fist. The next instant, he flew towards the island in the disordered region!

“Yes!”

The group of Dragon Palace members followed closely behind.

“Those two darned fellows! How dare they barge into my territory! What the hell is the Dragon Palace? I hope they will leave as soon as possible!”

At this very moment, several tens of kilometers away, the Manta Ray King wiggled its Devil’s Whip violently while letting out a creepy voice.

He was surrounded by approximately forty-five huge Manta Rays. Each one was at least fifteen to sixteen meters long with terrifying auras surrounding them.

All of them were Level 12 Budding Realm existences.

The Manta Ray King wiggled its body and entered a mountain peak on the seabed.

The remaining Manta Rays swam around it.

“Dragon King! Dragon King!”

On the disordered island, the dragonians called out respectfully as soon as they saw Wang Xian arriving.

“Lead me to the edge of the disordered region!” Wang Xian ordered the newly accepted dragonians.

“Dragon King, we will be closest to the edge if we head in that direction!”

The leader of Devil Kid pointed to his right while speaking.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded his head, looked across them and said, “In the future, your name will be Dragon Kid, yours will be Dragon Spirit, yours will be Dragon Wolf...”

Wang Xian gave each dragonian who had reached the Budding Realm a name, making reference to the Wandering Groups they were once from.

“Thank you, Dragon King, for bestowing upon us new names!”

The newly accepted dragonians thanked Wang Xian respectfully.

“Let’s go!”

Wang Xian led the way and the group moved ahead at a terrifying speed.

“From this place, start sweeping ahead and kill all creatures at the Inborn-level and above. Sweep away all the treasures within this region and put them in the space ring!”

Wang Xian instructed them and threw a space ring towards Mo Qinglong, Roving Lobster, Roving Heavens and the rest of the group.

These space rings were from the fifteen people from the Devil Sealing Immortal Sect from Xia Cauldron world. There was a total of ten space rings and each had a rather large storage space that allowed one to store a huge number of corpses and treasures!

“Yes, Dragon King!”

The dragonians and members of the Dragon Palace caught the space rings and looked across the piece of sea region.

“Since we can’t dominate this region, we can only take a step back and sweep this place.”

Wang Xian dived into the sea and transformed into his divine dragon form while observing the surroundings. After which, he swam rapidly forward. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

The best option for him would be to occupy this region. However, the shame was that there was a terrifying Immortal-class Manta Ray around this region.

Unless there are two more Immortal-class creatures from the Dragon Palace, it will be difficult to occupy this region!

Wang Xian thought deeply about it. For him to complete the First Transformation of the Divine Dragon, he would require a billion units of dragon energy.

A billion units of dragon energy was astronomical!

It would require him to devour several thousand Level 12 marine creatures for him to gather the necessary amount.

A billion units of dragon energy would also allow him to raise roughly twenty Immortal-class Dragon Palace subordinates.

I’ve got to raise two more Immortal-class Dragon Palace members as soon as possible!
