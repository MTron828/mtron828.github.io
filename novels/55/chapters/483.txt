Chapter 484: Be My Husband?

“He’s throwing up blood! His body is a little weak!” Seeing them throwing up blood, Wang Xian spoke sarcastically.

Mu Xiaowan was surprised to see them throwing up blood and was taken aback slightly.

“Will they be fine?”

“They will be fine. Why would they not be? I’m an incredible doctor and can tell from a single glance. Other than their bodies being a little too weak, there’s nothing wrong with them!”

Wang Xian shook his head.

Mu Xiaowan nodded her head, convinced. She had heard from the doctor after the accident previously. The young doctor that saved them was incredibly good.

“That’s great! That’s great!”

The three young men in the sea looked extremely gloomy. All of them glowered at Wang Xian in fury.

“What’s the matter? Qing Wen, Gao Yang, are you guys alright? Why did you guys fall into the sea?” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Tang Lingling’s boyfriend was a little shocked and asked them curiously.

“We are fine!”

The three of them were shivering a little in anger as they climbed back onto the surfboards and wiped the seawater away from their faces.

“It’s great that you guys are fine. Why would you guys fall into the water?”

The young man looked at the three of them, puzzled.

“Perhaps they are too trashy!” Wang Xian chuckled, patted the girl’s head and said. “Let’s go. We are going back soon!”

As he spoke, he moved ahead and away while glancing at the three of them with contempt.

“Let’s play for a little longer!” Mu Xiaowan said unwillingly.

“Count me out. If you want, you can ask the three of them to bring you along. Perhaps you could catch a few large sharks for dinner when you fall into the water!”

“I don’t want to go with them. Luckily, I did not agree previously. Otherwise, I’d be the one spewing blood. I don’t want to do so. That’s too gruesome!”

The two of them conversed as they moved away quickly.

The three young men behind them were all martial artists. They could hear Wang Xian and Mu Xiaowan clearly as their bodies shook a little in anger.

The three of them clenched their fists tightly.

When Tang Lingling’s boyfriend witnessed what happened, he frowned and said, “Let’s go back and get some rest!”

“Let’s go back!”

“When are we coming out to play again?”

“Leave it to fate. I’ll be returning home in two days!”

“Huh? So fast?”

Mu Xiaowan lifted her head, stared at Wang Xian and spoke unwillingly as she walked out of the water with Wang Xian.

“I don’t live here after all and am here for a short trip. I can’t be staying here for a long time!”

“Why not? Why don’t you just stay behind? You can be my sugar baby. When I want to go surfing, you just have to bring me along!”

“I’m not a man you could afford to keep!”

Wang Xian patted the girl’s head, feeling a little speechless. “Alright, go look for your Sister Lingling. I have something to do!”

“Huh? Where are you going? Bring me along?”

The girl pulled his hand as she asked.

“You can’t go since you haven’t reached the legal age,” Wang Xian smiled and said to her.

“Tsk! Guys like you...” Mu Xiaowan looked at him with contempt.

Wang Xian was speechless. After passing the surfboard to her, he said goodbye.

The girl pouted and walked towards Tang Lingling, clearly looking disgruntled.

Wang Xian returned to the hotel and changed into a new set of clothes. After which, he moved and headed towards the direction of the Fire Spirit Island rapidly.

When he arrived at the beach he was at the previous day, he realized that there were still lots of martial artists discussing.

Nonetheless, a large portion of the people had left as compared to the previous day.

With all the people from the Nether Flame perishing, all the other denominations were wary. They hesitated for a while before deciding to retreat for the moment.

If they were to return, their gods would definitely be involved.

These denominations were created by gods of their sects, or they still had existing gods.

As to which denomination still had gods alive, no one really knew.

Some might have passed away or some might have aged. In modern times, there were few occasions where gods surfaced to the public eye.

The only known god around was also the number one existence on the International Miracle Doctors Chart.

Hand of God.

The one who was rumored to be able to revive a dead person.

When Wang Xian arrived at the Fire Spirit Island, he realized the area had been surrounded by the soldiers of Dubai.

He jumped and headed towards the main hall directly.

Along the way, there were countless people in white robes. Wang Xian was able to avoid them easily.

Among these people, there were still several experts.

When Wang Xian entered the main hall, he immediately spotted a girl in a red dress on the throne in the main hall.

Although the girl was sitting, one could still tell that she was tall and slender. On her red dress, flames vaguely flickered.

The entirely red dress fully traced out her perfect figures.

It looked a little like an evening gown but looked more exquisite than one.

On her head, she was wearing a flaming crown.

She was like a goddess and a queen.

“What a huge transformation. That’s like the ugly duckling turning into a beautiful swan!”

Wang Xian looked at the girl on the throne in shock. She was completely different from the girl he met yesterday.

The previous night, she was totally covered and even wore a veil. No matter how stunning she was, no one could really tell.

And today, her charm was fully on display. One had to admit that some girls would look extremely breath-taking with a little makeup.

As for this girl, she was like a goddess with just a small change.

He looked across the main hall and found various Inborn Spiritual Weapons and treasures placed in the middle. Wang Xian couldn’t help but feel satisfied.

He looked towards the fiery-red hammer in the middle. Beside it, there was a forging table.

A forging table was a little similar to a blacksmith’s station.

Only through continuous hammering would a piece of equipment be refined. Refining elixir pills and blacksmithing were completely different.

[Wan Forging Table: Level 13]

[Wan Forging Hammer: Level 13]

Sss!

When the information on the Wan Forging Table and Wan Forging Hammer appeared in Wang Xian’s head, Wang Xian gasped.

Level 13! Those are Level 13 Inborn Spiritual items.

“Fire God Hephaestus was really incredible and insanely rich. There are probably few gods who were like him!”

Wang Xian sighed emotionally.

“Did you see the book I sent over in the morning?”

Adjaya lifted her head, placed the Fire God’s Secret Book aside, looked to Wang Xian and revealed a faint smile.

“What?”

Wang Xian was taken aback.

“You are a man with a sense of responsibility.”

Adjaya walked down from her throne gradually with a strong aura around her. It wasn’t just the aura of an expert but also the disposition of the Royal Family.

“What do you mean?” Wang Xian raised an eyebrow and continued, “The random book I got in the morning was from you? And the long string of words is your name?”

“You can just call me Adjaya!”

Adjaya stared at him and continued, “Our country is extremely traditional. It is especially so for my family. Moreover, my life is now in your hands. Therefore...!”

“Therefore...?”

Wang Xian looked curiously at her as she approached him. In her heels, she was a notch taller than him and this made him feel a little embarrassed.

Her lips were bright red. However, they weren’t red because of lipstick but simply because this was their natural color.

Even the pupils in her eyes seemed a little red.

Fire Goddess!

“Be my husband and that way you can be responsible for my life!”
