Chapter 1135: 1136 pups of the Void Interpretation Demonic Beast

Translator: 5496903

“Transcendent level 8, transcendent level 9, half-step void interpretation!”

When Wang Xian walked forward, his gaze swept across the lair in front of him.

When he saw the level of the ferocious beasts inside, his face revealed a look of surprise.

This was not the most central location. The most central location was the main hall.

On the left and right of the main hall, there were two lion-shaped lairs. The two lairs were twenty meters in size and were golden in color. Compared to the other lairs, they looked extremely majestic.

That was the most central area in the entire Beast City. Wang Xian had a hunch that there were at least void interpretation level ferocious beasts inside.

“Let’s get the pet eggs here first!”

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered as he started to scan his surroundings.

There were only over a thousand lairs in this area. The formations in the lairs were more powerful. It was slightly strenuous for Wang Xian to use his light and dark fire dragon eyes to check.

Fortunately, these formations were only at transcendent level seven or so.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

At this moment, Wang Xian felt a powerful aura flying towards him.

He turned his head and saw a young man in a yellow robe flying towards him with his subordinates.

The young man scanned his surroundings coldly. His gaze landed on Wang Xian before he turned to the side.

“Level eight of transcendence, two half-step void interpretation and four level nine of transcendence. This young man’s identity is not simple!”

Wang Xian took a look and thought to himself.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

At this moment, an even faster and more terrifying aura descended, causing Wang Xian’s expression to change slightly.

“Not good, the void interpretation experts are here!”

Wang Xian looked over and saw seven void interpretation experts flying over.

“It seems that the void interpretation experts could no longer sit still after realizing that there was no danger!”

Wang Xian thought to himself. Even Feng Luan thought that there would be danger here. However, after such a long time, there wouldn’t be any danger unless they broke the formation of the lair.

Facing the pet eggs one by one, they immediately took action.

“Quick, Quick!”

Wang Xian turned his gaze to the side. His eyes flickered with a demonic luster as he looked into the lairs one by one.

“Ao Yao, tell him to stay away from the insightful emptiness realm experts. He must not be discovered!”

Wang Xian said hurriedly. With a move of his body, he flew into one of the nests.

Under the circumstances where no one was paying attention to him, he entered the nest directly and put the pet eggs into the storage spirit bag.

As the pet eggs were alive, the interspatial ring could not store pet eggs.

A small pet egg was about half a meter in size and was very eye-catching.

However, Wang Xian, who possessed the storage spirit bag, did not have such concerns.

“Huh?”

When Wang Xian came out of the nest, the yellow-robed young man frowned slightly and looked in his direction.

Wang Xian sensed his gaze and stood there without moving. He scanned his surroundings and ordered the AO Yaoyao to enter the nest.

“Everyone, evacuate from here. Otherwise, die!”

At this moment, a terrifying aura came directly towards them, causing Wang Xian’s expression to change drastically.

The transcendent level 9 and half-step void interpretation experts who had rushed over also had a slight change in expression.

Only the young man in yellow robes and the other experts who were dressed in the Skymoon sect’s attire remained unperturbed!

“This...”

Everyone’s faces revealed a trace of bitterness when they saw the cold and murderous gazes of the seven insightful void martial experts.

These seven insightful void martial experts clearly wanted to monopolize this area and prohibit anyone from entering.

“Scram!”

The two insightful void martial experts from the howling wind kingdom saw that they had yet to leave. They slightly raised their brows and roared in a low voice.

A terrifying aura swept down like a tornado.

Cold Sweat broke out on the foreheads of everyone who entered this area, and they retreated in fear.

“Who is it? It’s disturbing our master’s Slumber!”

However, suddenly, a muffled voice sounded.

This voice caused everyone’s hair to stand on end, and their pupils constricted slightly as they looked towards the great hall a thousand meters away.

“Ka Ka, Ka Ka!”

On the left and right side of the Great Hall, there were two enormous metal lions. At this moment, the eyes of these two lions actually slowly opened, and they looked towards the seven insightful emptiness realm experts in the sky without the slightest reaction.

“What?”

When the surrounding people saw the two golden lions that were twenty meters in size a thousand meters away, their faces revealed a stunned expression.

Everyone thought that the two golden lions were a nest.

That was because they could not see any signs of life on the Golden Lions. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Their mouths were wide open on the ground and there was a deep hole. Everyone thought that this was a nest of ferocious beasts.

Even Wang Xian thought so.

However, he did not expect that this was a void interpretation level ferocious beast that possessed life.

Moreover, these two beasts could even speak human language.

“It’s a burst-mouthed golden lion. It’s actually a burst-mouthed golden lion. Moreover, it was trained by the hundred patrol elders to be able to speak human language. Oh My God!”

A half-step void interpretation expert revealed a shocked expression.

Burst-mouthed golden lion was a metal type beast. Its strength was incomparably terrifying!

And these two burst-mouthed golden lions did not seem to have any life force on their bodies. One could not tell the depth of their strength.

“Hiss, not good, our aura has disturbed them!”

The Heavenly Moon sect’s insightful emptiness realm expert’s expression changed slightly, and he stared at the two 20-meter-large golden lions with a grave expression.

The Howling Wind Kingdom’s insightful emptiness realm level 3 expert also slightly frowned.

“You Dare Disturb Master’s Slumber, you deserve to die!”

“Ka Ka Ka Ka!”

The two Golden Lions slowly stood up, their bodies emitting mechanical sounds, and the coldness in their eyes slowly turned into savagery.

“Not good, their strength is at the third level of the profound void tier!”

“Two third level of the profound void tier, we’re in big trouble. No, the aura on their bodies is a little weak, perhaps it’s because they haven’t eaten for a long time!”

The seven profound void tier experts in the sky revealed an embarrassed expression. Looking at the golden lions that were gradually becoming savagery, they held the weapons in their hands with vigilance.

“Clang, Clang, Clang!”

At this time, the two explosive golden lions suddenly raised their heads. Their mouths that were seven to eight meters in size slowly revealed their golden teeth.

Two huge fangs that were ten meters long extended out, looking incomparably violent.

“Bang!”

A terrifying aura was emitted from their bodies. They bent down and directly slashed towards the seven profound void martial experts in the sky.

The expressions of the seven profound void martial artists changed drastically.

“Their bodies are weak. Let’s kill them first!”

An expert from star-moon kingdom shouted loudly.

“Kill!”

The seven people did not hesitate in the slightest as they directly charged towards the two explosive golden lions.

“What a good opportunity!”

The nine profound void martial experts launched a great battle in the sky, causing the expressions of the people below to reveal excitement.

Earlier, the seven insightful void tier experts had wanted to chase them out, but now that the insightful void tier experts were being held back by two ferocious beasts, it was actually an opportunity for them.

As for the group of martial artists at the edge of the Hundred Beast City, when they saw the might of the insightful void tier experts, their expressions changed drastically, but they still gritted their teeth and continued to break through the array to search for the pet eggs.

“Ka Ka Ka!”

However, at this moment, something that no one had expected happened!
