Chapter 7: An Accident

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

Not too bad to gain twenty points of Dragon Energy after one night of cultivation.

The next morning, Wang Xian stared at the level of Dragon Energy he gained over the night with a flash of radiance in his eyes.

Given his speed, it would take him fifty days to up his level to Level Two.

According to the Divine Dragon Transformation, one can only reach the First Transformation after Level Nine.

The First Transformation of Divine Dragon Transformation could allow Wang Xian to roam the ocean and dive into the clouds.

He would be a dragon, a baby dragon, after the First Transformation.

“It’s still far. After earning some money, I’ll head out to the sea.”

As Wang Xian wondered to himself, he washed himself up swiftly.

“I’ll ride Dahai’s scooter over.” After some thought, he picked up the keys that Dahai had passed to him before the summer break.

Wang Dahai was the best friend of Wang Xian. They were quite close, likely because they shared the same last name.

Wang Dahai was a local. Knowing that Wang Xian was poor, he often took care of him. The funniest thing was that Wang Dahai offered to bring Wang Xian to one of those sauna cover brothels after knowing he was still a virgin.

Eventually, Wang Xian turned him down speechlessly. Wang Dahai was slightly plump and lazy. Other students bought bicycles for themselves, but he said he was too lazy to paddle. So, he bought a scooter.

Wang Xian hugged the fish bowl down the stairs.

The rain had already stopped with the sun shining brightly. The summer air after the storm was refreshing.

Wang Xian came to the carpark and started the engine of Wang Dahai’s scooter.

His scooter was slightly more massive as compared to the AIMA scooters. A stout person like Wang Dahai could ride this scooter comfortably.

Wang Xian placed the fishbowl on the leg rest and drove to the Flowers and Birds Market.

I hope I can sell all of them.

Wang Xian grinned.

Throughout the 30-minute journey from his school to the Flowers and Birds Market, his ride was smooth and steady as he was trying to prevent the fishbowl from toppling.

Almost there. Wang Xian checked the location in front of him and noticed the massive crowd at the Flowers and Birds Market. He also spotted a lot of cars with non-local car plates driving in slowly.

“Looks like many people are coming for the Goldfish Fair.”

Wang Xian sped up a little as he drove towards the carpark of the Flowers and Birds Market through a side lane.

Vroom!

Vroom!

Suddenly, he heard a vroom coming from behind. Soon after, Wang Xian saw a few heavy-duty motorcycles dashing in from the junction at a speed not less than 80 km per hour.

Wang Xian then noticed four heavy-duty motorcycles were charging towards him at a fast speed.

Vroom!

“Haha. Sorry, I’m first!”

At this time, a heavy-duty motorcycle at the forefront braked swiftly, and the bike stopped steadily. The cyclist laughed out loud as he took off his helmet.

The rest of the motorcycles behind braked and stopped quickly too.

“Oh no.”

One of the bikes did not manage to brake and skidded suddenly.

The road was still wet after a day of rain. Hence, the bike hurtled in Wang Xian’s direction.

Wang Xian was slightly appalled. He quickly dodged to the side when the bike came crashing in.

Bang!

The scooter that he was sitting on was sent flying back for three to four meters. After the motorcycle hit the scooter, it stopped.

“Damm, the bike actually skidded!”

A young man on the bike took off his helmet and spoke embarrassed.

He got down off his motorcycle and checked out the front of his bike. Upon seeing there was not much damage, he heaved a sigh of relief. “Luckily, the bike is intact!”

Wang Xian pulled a long face when the young man ignored the scooter that he hit and examined his own motorcycle the moment he got down from his bike. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

If Wang Xian was not strengthened by the Dragon Energy, he might not have dodged the hit in time.

“Oh no, my goldfish.”

Wang Xian hurried over, and his face was even longer when he saw the broken fish bowl.

The fishbowl was shattered, and all eight of the Redcap Brown Orandas were struggling on the ground.

Two of them were crushed under the wheels and had died immediately.

Another four of them were half-dead. Seeing the shedding fish scales, the fish must have fallen and knocked themselves.

Wang Xian sulked as he looked at the young man who behaved as if nothing had happened. With a darkened expression, he walked over, “How could you drive like that? And don’t you have to check my scooter after knocking it down?”

“Hur?” The young man turned to the scooter that was lying on the floor as soon as he heard Wang Xian.

“Okay, lad. I’m sorry. How much is your scooter? Tell me. I’ll compensate you,” said the young man with a smile as he paid no serious attention to the scooter.

“What’s wrong? You didn’t knock someone down, did you?” At the same time, those juveniles who were also on motorcycles came from behind and checked on the young man.

“Nothing. Just a scooter. Heh, seriously...the quality of this custom-made Harley-Davidson was no joke.” The young man replied laughingly as he turned around.

Wang Xian stared coldly at the young man who did not care about anything. He went straight to the young man,

“Hey, aren’t you going to compensate me for the things you damaged?”

“Hur?” The young man looked at Wang Xian and smiled, “Of course, I will. It’s just a scooter, isn’t it? Tell me how much it is.”

“Heh, not only the scooter. My goldfish, too.” Wang Xian replied nonchalantly.

“Goldfish? Haha, there were goldfish, too? Just name the price.”

Upon hearing it, the young man laughed and took out about five to six bills from his wallet.

As he spoke, he dug all his money out from it, “Here’s about six thousand dollars. This should be enough. Get going.”

“Six thousand?” Wang Xian looked at the money in his hands with a mocking expression, “You can’t even buy a fishtail with that amount.”

“Lad, are you trying to extort?” The young man asked coldly as he turned and glared at him.

“What? Are you trying to put the bite on us?” The three juveniles walked over at this time as they glared at Wang Xian scornfully.

Some of the people at the entrance of the Flowers and Birds Market crowded over with curiosity when they saw the accident.

“Lad, you don’t need to stare at me. Six thousand dollars is more than enough to cover that rundown scooter of yours and those pathetic goldfish,” the young man said as he peered at Wang Xian who was staring at him. He pointed at him with much displeasure. “Take the money while you can. Otherwise, you’ll not get a single cent.”

“Seems like the young man who rode the heavy-duty motorcycle accidentally knocked into the young lad on scooter.”

“Is he alright? If he is alright, six thousand is not a small sum.”

“Yes, he’s alright. But, that fellow seems discontented. Those few people who were riding the motorcycles were going too fast. The engines were roaring loudly just now.”

“It’s a Harley-Davidson. That motorcycle is so cool. It must have cost a bomb.”

At this time, the surrounding spectators were whispering as they watched the group.

“Trying to send me off with a mere six thousand dollars?” Wang Xian sneered at the young man. He turned to his scooter and picked up the Redcap Brown Orandas.
