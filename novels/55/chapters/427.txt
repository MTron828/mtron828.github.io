Chapter 428: His Last Name Is “Xiao” Too

Boom!

In the field, streams of devilish aura were emitted from Mo Qinglong’s body. The devilish aura rotated slowly and eventually formed a black shield.

On the shield, there was a vicious looking devil dragon which enveloped Xiao Ran and him completely.

“Attack!” Mo Qinglong looked plainly at the clan leader of Liang Family and remarked.

The clan leader of the Liang Family could feel his eyes twitching violently. His body which was emitting terrifying aura started shaking violently.

Breaking down... He was on the verge of tearing.

He had ignited his life force in preparation to kill this kid. In the end, an existence who was clearly above the Inborn Realm protected him and gestured for him to attack.

This feeling was insufferable.

Argh!

The clan leader of the Liang Family attacked Mo Qinglong desperately.

Rumble!

Horrifying strikes brought upon a strong gale that shook the surrounding. Huge explosions reverberated across the entire Xiao Clan.

However, the attacks of the clan leader from the Liang Family couldn’t put a dent in Mo Qinglong’s defense. He couldn’t break his defense at all.

“Hehe. If I move a little, it’s my loss!” Mo Qinglong looked at the clan leader of the Liang Family and commented with ridicule.

“Sss! What a strong defense. That middle-aged man is definitely a Half-Step to Dan Realm expert!”

“He’s isn’t just an ordinary Half-Step to Dan Realm expert!”

“The clan leader of the Liang Family must be feeling miserable. He ignited his life force to increase his strength temporarily and yet the other party was making fun of his attacks!”

“Liang Family has a good relationship with our Xiao Clan. We...”

When the surrounding Xiao Clan disciples saw what was happening and heard the highly offensive words from Mo Qinglong, they were shocked, feeling complicated and bitter.

Liang Family and the Xiao Clan had been friends for generations. It wasn’t the first time that they had a political marriage.

In fact, the most talented disciple in the Xiao Clan currently was the grandson of the clan leader of the Liang Family.

Pfft!

Ten seconds quickly passed and the clan leader of the Liang Family spewed a mouthful of blood. His eyes were fixed on Mo Qinglong and Xiao Ran while he was feeling wretched.

“Continue!”

Mo Qinglong moved his arm and retracted his defense. After which, he said something to Xiao Ran before returning to the side of Wang Xian.

“Let me ask you this. Are you guys responsible for the annihilation of my grandfather’s family?” Xiao Ran pulled a long face, held his Ancient Spiritual Sword tightly and stared at the clan leader of the Liang Family, brimming with killing intent.

“Cough cough! So what if we are!”

The clan leader of the Liang Family could sense vitality leaking from his body rapidly. However, he still mustered the strength to glower at Xiao Ran.

“All I wanted was an answer! No matter what, I’m definitely going to annihilate your Liang Family!”

Xiao Ran nodded his head before piercing the Ancient Spiritual Sword into his waist.

“Grandpa! Grandma!”

Xiao Ran mumbled softly to himself. Soon after, he turned his attention towards the wealthy-looking lady and Xiao Fan.

“Father! Father!”

At this point, the wealthy-looking lady had completely collapsed. Seeing the corpses of her father and the members of the Liang Family around her, her body was shivering.

“When you killed my mother and my grandparents, were you ever expecting this?”

Xiao Ran stared coldly at the wealthy-looking lady. With the Ancient Spiritual Sword tightly in his grip, he walked towards her, overwhelmed by killing intent.

“You... Don’t you come over! Don’t come over!”

Xiao Fan was horrified to see Xiao Ran walking towards him.

A teenager that was even younger than him had the strength of an Inborn expert. This caused the prideful young man to feel completely defeated.

Xiao Ran was truly the most talented and powerful teenager.

Seeing this teenager approaching him, fear slowly crept up.

Xiao Ran lifted his head and looked at this brother of his. With condemning eyes, he remarked, “After killing your mother, I’ll kill you.”

“Don’t you dare! Don’t you dare!”

The wealthy-looking lady screamed wretchedly upon hearing Xiao Ran. She looked hideous and glowered at Xiao Ran as though she were a female ghost.

“Great nanny!”

“Great nanny!”

Xiao Fan turned around and called out to the old lady with the truncheon pitifully.

The old lady tightened her grip on the truncheon, turned to Wang Xian and said, “Xiao Fan is the most gifted disciple of our Xiao Clan and the future successor. If you kill him, our Xiao Clan will not rest until one of us has perished!”

“Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown, you have killed so many people for your disciple. No matter how deep the feud is, it should be over now. Let the most outstanding disciple of Xiao Clan off as a form of goodwill. Let’s end this here right now!” the old men in the air shouted solemnly at Wang Xian.

The threat of the old lady and the reconciliatory tone of the old man were clearly a display of their attitude.

Those who had died previously weren’t experts of the Xiao Clan after all. However, if Xiao Ran or Wang Xian were to kill the most outstanding disciple of the Xiao Clan in this generation, they wouldn’t just stand back.

“If you guys dare to make a move, I’ll annihilate your entire Xiao Clan!” Wang Xian looked at the old lady and declared coldly.

“YOU...”

The old lady was flushed and her body was shivering as she stared at Wang Xian.

The surrounding members of the Xiao Clan were completely silent. That young man clearly wasn’t just threatening them. He had the capacity to put his words into action.

Hehe!

Xiao Ran smirked and looked at the old lady before turning to Xiao Fan. “Asking for help? How ironic!”

“Can you still remember? Two years ago, father asked us to spar after I arrived at the Xiao Clan for the very first time. He asked you to guide me in the Flame Duel but you torched me till my entire body was burnt red. When I asked our father for help, what did you say? ‘Xiao Clan has no cowardly disciple and wouldn’t need a cowardly disciple who begs for help.’ You even asked me to scram!

“Can you still remember the times you bullied me under the pretense of sparring?” Xiao Ran illustrated slowly. His eyes were turning red and his body was shivering. “Have you forgotten me after not seeing me for just a year? Xiao Fan, I’m Xiao Ran!”

“What?” Xiao Fan’s eyes widened in disbelief. He pointed at Xiao Ran and stammered, “You... You are Xiao Ran...? You are that little trash...?”

Boom!

When Xiao Ran completed his words, the entire Xiao Clan was shaken. They were dumbfounded and stared at Xiao Ran in disbelief.

“He said... He said he is Xiao Ran... His last name is ‘Xiao’!”

“Xiao Ran! Xiao Ran! His last name is ‘Xiao’! Oh gosh!”

“Xiao Ran... Xiao Ran... If I recall correctly, third brother once brought back a lady with two kids. The boy’s name seemed to be Xiao Ran!”

The surrounding Xiao Clan members stared at Xiao Ran. Some of them seemed to have recalled something as they mumbled within themselves.

“What?”

The old lady’s eyes widened and she couldn’t hold back her exclamations. Xiao Ran... Xiao Ran... She didn’t have an impression of him.

However, from the words of Xiao Ran, she knew that this teenager was the descendant of her grandson, and her great-grandson.

A direct blood relationship!

“How can this be...? It feels like Heaven is playing a joke on us!”

The crowd of Xiao Clan exchanged glances. They were stunned and felt complicated.

This teenager’s surname was “Xiao”! He was a disciple of the Xiao Clan.

A fifteen-year-old Xiao Clan’s disciple had barged into the Xiao Clan and started a killing spree.

He was returning in such a manner to face the Xiao Clan.

This embarrassed every member of the Xiao Clan. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

The first person to have ever killed his way into the Xiao Clan happened to be their junior!
