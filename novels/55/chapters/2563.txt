2564 2564 clashed head-on

“Something big has happened. The Commercial Planet of the Ninth Grade Heaven sect has been attacked. Thousands of disciples of the Ninth Grade Heaven sect have been killed!”

“Someone actually dared to attack the disciples of the Ninth Grade Heaven sect on their commercial planet. This is the first time in tens of thousands of years!”

“The Commercial Planet of the Ninth Grade Heaven sect has been attacked. Thousands of people have been killed or injured. The murderer has not been found. It seems that the commercial planet of the Ninth Grade Heaven sect is not as safe as the Dragon Planet!”

“Who did it? Nothing has happened on the commercial planet of the ninth-grade celestial sect for tens of thousands of years. Could it be the Dragon Planet? You have to know that only the dragon planet has been in conflict with them recently!”

“It seems that the ninth-grade celestial sect has not found any clues at all. I wonder how they will handle this matter!”

The commercial planet of the ninth-grade celestial sect had been attacked. Thousands of people had died and thousands of people had been injured. This was a very important matter for the southern star system!

Commercial planets represented safety. If it was not safe, no one would dare to go to that planet!

As a faction with the deepest heritage, grade nine celestial sect’s commercial planet rarely had any incidents on it!

However, the deaths and injuries of thousands of people had attracted everyone’s attention and discussion!

In addition to the recent rise of the Dragon Star, the destruction of planet Xing Hua, and the enmity between the grade nine celestial sect and the Dragon Star!

This made the matter more than ten times bigger!

Countless people were discussing it. Some people guessed that the matter might have been done by the Dragon Palace and the chaotic Tiger Demon Nation!

“Peng!”

“This is a provocation to our ninth-grade sky sect!”

Just as the AI was discussing it, hundreds of undying godly monarchs sat in front of the ninth-grade sky sect!

In the lead, there were two level 7 undying godly monarchs sitting there. They were the sect master of the ninth-grade sky sect and the Patriarch of the ninth-grade sky sect!

The two of them sat there with dark expressions!

“90% of this is the doing of the Dragon Palace and the chaotic tiger demon country. Do they think that with two level 7 immortal king experts, they can provoke our ninth-grade sky sect?”

The sect master of the ninth-grade sky sect had a face full of killing intent as he swept his gaze around coldly. “Since he dares to provoke us, let them pay the price!”

“Sect master, we need to calm down on this matter. I don’t think that the Dragon Palace and the Tiger Chaos Fey Kingdom have the guts to do so, even if they have two undying godking level seven experts guarding them!”

“Should we investigate and discuss?”

A white-bearded elder held a cattail leaf fan and said with a frown!

“Directly question the dragon palace and see what their attitude is!”

The Patriarch of the ninth-grade heaven sect said after a moment of silence!

“Master, let me say it. We will send people to kill them. If they can explain it clearly, it will be fine. If they can’t, we will start a war!”

The Patriarch of the ninth-grade heaven sect said with a gloomy face!

“You are already the patriarch, but you are still so rash!”

The Patriarch of the ninth-grade heaven sect glanced at him and then looked at the white-bearded elder. “Now, we will directly question the wisdom brain and see what attitude the Dragon Palace and the Tiger Demon Nation have. We will make a decision according to their attitude!”

“Yes, ancestor. Leave it to me!”

The white-bearded elder nodded his head!

Ten minutes later, the ninth-grade celestial sect issued a statement, which was also a question!

“For thousands of years, nobody has dared to provoke the ninth-grade celestial sect or cause trouble on the commercial planet of the ninth-grade celestial sect. Now, the Dragon Palace of the chaotic Tiger Demon Nation will give us a perfect explanation for what happened just now

“Based on this explanation, we will decide your future!”

There was a notice and a question!

Although the ninth-grade heaven’s sect did not have any evidence to prove that the Dragon Palace and the Tiger Riot Demon Kingdom were the culprits, they dared to send such a message!

If the Dragon Palace and the Tiger Riot Demon Kingdom were not satisfied with the explanation, and if they did not prove that they were not the culprits, the ninth-grade heaven’s sect would make them pay a heavy price!

“The ninth-grade heaven sect is so powerful. Even if they don’t have any evidence, they still have to make the Dragon Palace and the chaotic Tiger Demon Kingdom prove their innocence!”

“This is the dignity of a powerhouse. It can not be violated!”

The announcement of the ninth-grade heaven sect made many people slightly shocked. Everyone and the forces were quietly waiting for the reply from the Dragon Palace and the chaotic Tiger Demon Kingdom!

“Dragon King, the ninth-grade heaven sect sent an announcement and a question. The chaotic Tiger Demon Kingdom asked us how to reply. They will follow our reply!”

At this moment, in the Dragon Star, Wang Xian was leisurely sitting in the Dragon Palace and drinking tea with a group of girls!

Prime Minister Gui walked over and presented the information on the AI!

“Let me publish it!”

Wang Xian looked at the notice of the ninth-grade heaven sect and the corner of his mouth curled up slightly!

Since he dared to send the deviant demon to attack, he was not afraid that the other party would know!

He opened the AI and directly replied to a message! Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Alright, just get the tiger turmoil demon nation to reply as well. Prepare for the next step!”

Wang Xian said to Prime Minister Gui directly!

Arrogant? Arrogant? This ninth-grade heaven sect had been the Overlord for too long. It was so long that they had become arrogant!

The current Dragon Planet wasn’t a force like Xing Hua Planet!

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Prime Minister Gui nodded his head!

“Damn, the Dragon Palace has responded. It’s rude not to reciprocate. The Commercial Planet of the ninth grade Sky clan is only SO-SO, and its security is so low. I suggest that everyone come to the commercial planet!”! “Are they teasing and provoking the ninth grade Sky Clan?”

...

“The Dragon Palace is completely rigid. They are admitting that the attack of the commercial planet of the ninth grade Sky clan was their doing. What is the Dragon King doing? is he going to start a war?”

“They are not afraid at all. It seems that the Dragon Palace and the chaotic tiger demon country are not afraid of the ninth grade heaven sect because they have two undying god King Level 7 experts!”

“Regardless of whether it is wise for the Dragon Palace to directly make the ninth grade heaven sect steel, I’m afraid a storm is about to erupt!”

When everyone saw the Dragon Palace’s mocking reply, they had a feeling that a storm was about to come!

The Dragon Palace was blatantly provoking them!

However, after the Dragon Palace and the chaotic Tiger Demon Kingdom destroyed planet Xing Hua, all the forces knew that the Dragon Palace was not as weak as they had imagined!

If they were to really fight, it would definitely be a long war!

Not long after the Dragon Palace’s announcement, the chaotic Tiger Demon Kingdom followed closely behind, and the statement that represented the Dragon Star was also issued!

The three identical words directly responded to the ninth-grade heaven sect!

“Boom!”

On the ninth-grade Heaven Sect’s planet, a towering baleful aura dispersed the white clouds in the sky as a terrifying killing intent spread throughout the entire planet!

...

“All ninth-grade heaven sect disciples above the immortal god King level have returned!”

“Also, summon all the demon Slayer sect’s experts over!”

A summoning order spread throughout all the ninth-grade Heaven Sect’s planets!

This time, the ninth grade Sky sect was really furious!

For tens of thousands of years, no one had dared to provoke them. Now that the Dragon Palace and the tiger demon country had provoked them, the entire ninth grade Sky sect was furious!

All of a sudden, the entire southern star system was in turmoil!

A war was about to break out!
