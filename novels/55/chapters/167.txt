What?

When Wang Xian saw the information about these two tufts of grass, he was shocked.

He was actually able to see the level of these medicinal grasses. Moreover, dragon energy could be extracted from them.

Nope, they should be referred to as “Spiritual Medicine!”

100-year Blood Nurturing Grass! Could it be that this medicinal grass has been living for a hundred years and has evolved into a spiritual grass? Wang Xian thought to himself.

“Our Thistles and Thorns Sect had a hard time getting these two tufts of grass. This is the Blood Nurturing Grass. Consuming it would strengthen one’s breathing and blood flow and strengthen one’s body. This is the Spiritual Beads Grass. Consuming the spiritual beads on it could increase one’s spiritual strength. However, the spiritual beads on it haven’t matured and would require an additional month. Spiritual grasses like these are few even in the entire Thistles and Thorns Sect.”

Elder Fang explained as she held onto the two tufts of spiritual grass.

“Master, are those stones with spiritual strength and spiritual grasses expensive?”

Xiao Yu looked at the white and translucent stones around her and asked inquisitively.

“They are naturally precious. Now that we are at the Age of Dharma Decline where spiritual energy is scarce, cultivation is extremely difficult. Not everyone has the Inborn Constitution like Xiao Yu. A small stone like this will be enough for an ordinary Ancient Martial Artist to absorb. However, each one of these is worth several hundreds of thousands.” [1]

“The value of these two tufts of grass is even higher. You can’t get it without four to five million. Moreover, many would see these as priceless. Even if you have the money, you might not be able to get them,” Elder Fang explained to Xiao Yu patiently.

“Wouldn’t that mean that the stones with spiritual energy and these spiritual grasses are worth forty to fifty million?” Xiao Yu remarked in astonishment.

There were over a hundred stones with spiritual energy that her master had brought over this time. Together with these precious spiritual grasses, the value was extraordinary.

“These resources are for your training use for the next half a year. There will be an auction in the Southern Province tomorrow. At that time, there would be spiritual grasses up for auction. I’ll bring you along to get some items,” Elder Fang continued.

Xiao Yu’s eyes lit up as she nodded her head slightly.

The Thistles and Thorns Sect had highly valued Xiao Yu’s Inborn Constitution. They weren’t stingy at all when it came to various cultivation resources.

“Let me place the remaining spiritual grass in a place with ample sunlight. Xiao Yu, bring these spiritual stones into your room. I’ll teach you how to absorb the energy in a while!” Elder Fang said to Xiao Yu.

“Alright, Master,” answered Xiao Yu.

“Miracle Doctor Wang, I’ll be troubling you for the near future,” Elder Fang said to Wang Xian.

“It’s alright. You are Xiao Yu’s master. I should be thanking you for guiding her.”

Wang Xian shook his head.

Although Elder Fang wore loose clothing, her perfect body was just like a mature peach. Looking at her was pleasing to the eyes.

Elder Fang nodded her head and smiled. After which, she took the tufts of medicinal grasses to the front yard. With the assistance of a middle-aged man, she planted them.

After watering them and placing some broken spiritual stones around them, Elder Fang finally nodded her head in satisfaction before heading back to the villa.

As for the driver, after helping Elder Fang, he left immediately.

After seeing them leaving, Wang Xian hesitated for a moment before appearing in front of the medicinal grass Elder Fang had planted.

Wang Xian knew relatively little about medicinal grasses.

Medicinal grasses and medical techniques were often highly related. However, the shame was that Wang Xian was just a pseudo Miracle Doctor.

It seems like only medicinal grasses that are over a hundred years could be considered as Level 1 spiritual medicine. Only then can I see their information and extract dragon energy.

Wang Xian confirmed the thought in his mind. From another perspective, the Devil Flowers that he met in the seas previously could also be considered as a form of spiritual medicine.

Level 1 spiritual medicine is worth four to five million. This is similar to the value of a 100-year-old ginseng. Can I breed my own spiritual grass?

Wang Xian pondered.

When he knew how precious spiritual medicine was, as well as its effects, he had a thought in mind.

As a divine dragon, coupled with the fact that he could turn into an Azure Dragon of Wood attributes, he could control all types of plants.

The most common ability and what he was most apt at in this moment was controlling plants. Using wood-attribute energy, he could make the plants grow at a rapid pace and control them for attacking.

Does this mean that I can breed spiritual medicine rapidly?

For example, making a 100-year spiritual grass grow into a 500-year spiritual grass in a short amount of time?

If Wang Xian could do it, he would be a “bug” like existence in the future. All the experts in the Ancient Martial Arts circle would be requesting spiritual medicine from him.

At that time, he wouldn’t have to worry about the resources required for the Dragon Palace!

Wang Xian had spent a total of $120 million to buy the villa and the yacht today. This left him with only thirty million. How poor was he!

Wang Xian walked in front of the medicinal grass that Elder Fang had planted.

There was a total of ten tufts of them.

These medicinal grass were all around thirty to forty years old and weren’t cheap at all.

“This is the Spiritual Beads medicinal grass. However, it has not borne the spiritual beads yet!”

Wang Xian looked at the medicinal grass. It was different from those that Elder Fang had placed in his own room. This was just a seedling in comparison.

It still had some effects if consumed now. However, the effects were a far cry from those 100-year-old Spiritual Beads Grasses.

Those that were below a hundred years were classified as medicinal grass. As for those above a hundred years, they were classified as spiritual medicine.

Wang Xian bowed down and dug out the Spiritual Beads grass.

Sss!

Moving his finger slightly, a dense aura of the Azure Dragon surrounded the grass and prevented it from dying.

“Let’s experiment on it!”

Wang Xian returned to the villa. When he walked past the second floor, he noticed that Elder Fang was guiding Xiao Yu with her cultivation. He headed for the third floor directly and closed the door.

“I hope it will work!”

The Spiritual Beads Grass was only about twenty centimeters tall and had the thickness of a thumb. It was of a bright green color, just like bamboo which had grown out of the earth.

It was much smaller than the one in Elder Fang’s hands a while ago, which was half a meter tall.

Wang Xian held it and emitted an intense aura of the Azure Dragon. Gradually, he injected them into the Spiritual Beads Grass.

The Spiritual Beads Grass glowed in a faint green color.

Wang Xian noticed that spiritual beads were growing at a very slow pace.

“It really works!”

Wang Xian’s eyes lit up as he continued injecting the aura of the Azure Dragon into it.

“This is it.”

However, after ten minutes, Wang Xian could feel that all the energy in his body had been depleted. The Spiritual Beads Grass had only grown by ten centimeters.

“Indeed, it isn’t that easy to create a spiritual medicine!”

Wang Xian’s complexion was pale and he felt fatigued.

He hesitated for a moment before going to the top floor of the villa. After removing his clothes, he slid into the seas from that slide.

Dragon Transformation!

Wang Xian dived into the seas. He noticed that the waters directly below were only about 1.5 meters deep. Swaying his body, he swam towards the seas rapidly. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Splash!

The giant body of the divine dragon appeared. Wang Xian held that Spiritual Beads Grass between his lips and swam to the region where the waters were seven to eight meters deep. After which, he created a space that was free of water.

Wang Xian in human form was a lot weaker than when he was in the dragon form. The energy in his body in human form was also a lot lower.

With a change in thought, lights of five colors were emitted from his body and he turned into an Azure Dragon with Wood-attribute energy.

I don’t believe I can’t create a spiritual medicine!

Wang Xian stared at that Spiritual Beads Grass as a dense aura of the Azure Dragon was injected into it gradually.
