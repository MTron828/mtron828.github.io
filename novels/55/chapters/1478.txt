Chapter 1479: 1479

Wang Xian looked over and saw dozens of young men and women walking towards him. Each of them had an excited expression on their faces.

The group of people walked towards Wang Xian. Apparently, they were also riding on an airship.

“This time, young master he has proposed to the family to establish a mount battle team and establish an independent army of his own. This time, he will only recruit young talents with potential. I wonder if there’s a chance!”

“I hope that I can be chosen. Once I’m chosen, young master he will reward me with a void interpretation level beast mount. This is a void interpretation level beast mount!”

“Moreover, young master he has a 50% chance of inheriting the position of clan leader of the He clan. Once we are able to join young master he’s army, we will definitely soar to great heights in the future!”

“Heavens, even if young master he is unable to inherit the position of clan leader of the He clan, with young master he’s talent and the army he has established, he will be the pillar of the He clan in the future!”

A group of young men and women walked over and chatted excitedly with each other.

Some of the young men looked like they had extraordinary statuses, but they still could not suppress the excitement in their eyes.

“The airship will take off in ten minutes. Let’s wait here!”

A young man asked and said to all the young men and women.

Dozens of young men stood there and waited, chatting as they waited.

“Dui Gongzi is here!”

“I didn’t expect Dui Gongzi to be here as well. If Dui Gongzi were to be there, he would definitely be one of the hundred spots!”

“Although the DUI clan is very strong and Dui Gongzi has the chance to inherit the position of Clan Head, there is still a huge gap between him and young master he’s army and the He clan!”

“Miss Xin ‘ER is here as well. It seems like all of the outstanding young men in Southern Ridge City are here!”

A few minutes later, a few more young men and women arrived. The status of these young men and women was obviously very high in this city.

Wang Xian sat at the side and listened quietly. After listening for a while, he finally understood a little.

Young master he, also known as he yuan, would be holding a birthday party in half a month’s time.

Furthermore, he was prepared to build an army and select a hundred elite young men. Each of them would be given a void interpretation level ferocious beast.

He announced this news to the vast region. As long as there were capable youths, they were welcome to come.

This was a great opportunity for the subordinate forces of the He clan, as well as the youths within the forces of the He clan.

With he Yuan’s current status in the He clan, even some elders couldn’t compare to him.

In just a few short years, he had tamed over a hundred profound void tier demonic beasts. In the future, he had a 50% chance of inheriting the position of clan leader of the He clan.

Even if he could not inherit the position, his position in the He clan would not be lower than a clan leader in the future.

The He clan was a first-rate clan. Basically, all the forces within a radius of 100,000 kilometers belonged to their subordinate forces.

In a first-rate clan, it was also the best.

Now that he yuan was on his birthday, the establishment of an army was a huge opportunity for every young man.

“Looks like this guy is doing quite well!”

Wang Xian sat there with a faint smile on his face.

“The airship is about to take off and head to the forest of the He clan in the ancient wood forest. Please board the airship as soon as possible!”

At this moment, a middle-aged voice was heard from the airship. Everyone immediately walked into the airship.

It was much bigger than the airship that Wang Xian saw at the heartless sword path sect. It was at least 100 meters in size and could seat 300 to 400 people inside.

An airship was different from an airplane. It was like a ship. There was an open space on the periphery that looked like the deck of a ship. One could observe the area below while the airship was flying.

Wang Xian entered and bought a fixed seat for the airship ticket.

When he entered, he realized that there were already people sitting beside him.

Wang Xian sat down and looked around. Three to four hundred seats were basically filled.

“Brother, are you going to celebrate young master he’s birthday as well? Do you want to join Young Master He’s Army?”

At this moment, a voice suddenly came from the side.

Wang Xian turned his head and saw a slightly chubby young man with a slit in his eyes looking at him with his head tilted.

“Let’s go and take a look!”

Wang Xian nodded his head faintly and closed his eyes slowly.

“Brother, you don’t seem to be from Nanling City, right? Where are you from? Look at your impressive appearance. You are a strong competitor of mine!”

Seeing that Wang Xian closed his eyes and didn’t want to speak, the fatty didn’t mind and said with a smile.

“Hey, brother, you have quite a personality. Those who have a personality have a high chance of joining young master he’s army. It seems that we are fated to join young master he’s army this time. My name is Dui Dazhuang. I’m a core member of the He clan from the previous fifteen generations!”

When Dui Dazhuang saw that Wang Xian was still ignoring him, he did not mind and continued to spout.

“Damn fatty, shut up. You, a level seven extraordinary, still want to join Young Master He’s Army? Dream On!”

“If you continue to spout nonsense here, I’ll seal your mouth!”

At this moment, a young man in the front seat turned his head and glared at him.

“Shut up, shut up!”

Dui Dazhuang retracted his head and smiled awkwardly.

“My Name Is Wang Xian!”

Wang Xian didn’t want to bother with the fatty who was nagging beside him. When he heard the young man’s shout, he raised his eyebrows slightly and opened his eyes to look at DUI Dazhuang.

“Brother Wang Xian, what a good name!” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Dui Dazhuang raised his thumb in a low voice and said with a smile.

“Tell me, what should he yuan give for his birthday?”

Wang Xian asked Dui Mu Dazhuang.

Wang Xian had come all the way here for he Yuan’s birthday. Furthermore, he was asking for his help. Naturally, he couldn’t leave empty-handed.

He shouldn’t be lacking in weapons and elixirs.

“Gao, Gao, I’m prepared to give a gift to young master he for his birthday. If young master he is satisfied with my gift, he might be able to let me join his army!”

“With young master he’s status, he doesn’t lack any gifts. What he lacks the most is sincerity. Let me show you something secretly!”

As Dui Dazhuang spoke, he took out an item carefully.

Wang Xian looked over and was slightly stunned.

It was a wooden sculpture, about half a meter in size. The wooden sculpture was clearly the image of he yuan. Beside it were two mighty ferocious beasts.

It was lifelike. This gift was very exquisite and thoughtful!

“How is it? Is it lifelike? I finally managed to find a portrait of young master he to carve it into. Young master he will definitely like it very much when he sees it!”

Dui Dazhuang squinted his eyes and smiled.

He squinted his eyes and couldn’t see it anymore!

“It’s pretty good!”

Wang Xian nodded his head faintly. His heart skipped a beat. After hesitating for a moment, he thought of what to gift.

Buzz

At this moment, the airship took off and flew towards the sky at a very fast speed.

The speed of this airship was no less than the full speed of a powerhouse at the first level of the profound void stage.

Wang Xian stood up and walked towards the location outside.

“Brother Wang Xian, shall we go and take a look at the scenery? Let’s go, let’s go together!”

Wang Dazhuang’s voice came from behind.
