Chapter 931: 0932, the King of the Holy Sea Town’s mercenary group

Translator: 549690339

In the transcendence continent, those who dared to cultivate two attributes were definitely geniuses among millions of people.

However, after Dao Hen saw that Wang Xian had displayed at least four attributes, his expression turned even uglier.

As everyone knew, the more attributes one had, the stronger one’s ability to surpass one’s level would be.

At the same time, the difficulty level of dual-attribute cultivators was twice that of single-attribute cultivators.

And if one cultivated four or five attributes, what kind of concept would that be.

Four or five times that of an ordinary cultivator.

In other words, a single-attribute cultivator might have reached rank 5 transcendence, while that multi-attribute cultivator might not have broken through to rank 1 transcendence.

In battle, a rank 5 transcendent would naturally be able to easily kill a rank 1 transcendent.

Although quantitative changes could trigger qualitative changes, it was useless if the quality was too different.

Even ten rank 1 extraordinary divine abilities could not break the defense of a rank 5 extraordinary expert.

However, the young man in front of him had transformed into a monster with four to five attributes, and his strength had even reached rank 4 extraordinary.

What kind of concept was this.

He was certain that even those powerful empires would not have such a monstrous fellow.

“Golden Light Explosion!”

Dao Hen gritted his teeth and roared. He could only use his supernatural ability to resist.

Golden Light Explosion. One beam, ten thousand beams of golden light exploded when it came into contact with the wood world.

In an instant, all the trees were turned into dust.

“Continue, Fire Dragon’s Flame!”

He used his supernatural ability again!

From the start of the battle, Wang Xian had unleashed four supernatural abilities, one after another.

From metal to water, water to wood, wood to fire!

The flame of the Fire Dragon was a divine ability evolved from the burning river and boiling sea.

Under the enhancement of the wood chips, the power of the flame was even more terrifying!

“Roar!”

Wang Xian opened his dragon mouth and spat out the dragon flames!

“Scram! I, Dao Hen, have experienced life and death. How can I Die Here!”

Dao Hen roared loudly. His entire body was emitting golden light as he charged through the flames that filled the sky and slashed at Wang Xian!

“Boom!”

Wang Xian’s eyes were flashing with a mixture of white and black red light. The two flames landed on Dao Hen’s body.

“Boom!”

The Dragon Eyes of light and dark fire was still able to retain its original attack after the fusion of several ocular arts into one. It was even more terrifying.

The red, white, and Black Flames landed on Dao Hen’s body. The Golden Light was quickly dissolved.

“Ah!”

The special flames landed on Dao Hen’s body, causing his expression to change drastically. His eyes revealed a look of horror.

His body was sent flying into the distance.

“Bang!”

The powerful force collided with the formation, causing Dao Hen to spit out a large mouthful of blood.

“This is your strength!”

Wang Xian’s red, black, and white eyes emitted a strange luster as he said coldly.

“Cough Cough!”

Dao Hen coughed violently as a hint of fear flashed across his eyes.

“Leader, save us! All our brothers have been killed!”

At this moment, a miserable voice came from below again.

His face was pale as he looked down. There were more than 70 corpses on the ground.

Out of all the experts in Dao Hen’s mercenary group, only two or three of them were still standing there. However, they would be killed soon!

“As long as I’m still alive, I can do everything again!”

Slowly, Knife Scar’s eyes turned blood-red. His desire to survive caused a terrifying aura to erupt from his body once again.

“Eh? As expected of Knife Scar, the legend of the Holy Sea Town’s mercenary group and the King of the mercenary group!”

“However, from today onwards, the holy sea town will have no knife scar mercenary group!”

“The Celestial Phoenix mercenary group will be the King of the Holy Sea Town’s mercenary group!”

Wang Xian swayed his huge body and attacked knife marks directly.

“Haha, Dream On. I, knife marks, will not die!”

Knife marks roared loudly. His two-meter-long broadsword turned completely dark gold. His body flew into the air and slashed towards Wang Xian.

“I will kill you with this attack!”

Wang Xian’s gaze was cold. His dragon claws were emitting terrifying flames.

“Ah, die!”

Dao Hen used all the strength in his body to slash at Wang Xian.

“Void!”

The moment the long blade was about to land on Wang Xian, he unleashed his supernatural ability, void.

“How is this possible?”

The long blade passed through Wang Xian’s body. Dao Hen widened his eyes and revealed an incredulous expression.

“PFFT!”

At this moment, Wang Xian’s dragon claws grabbed Dao Hen’s body.

“No!”

Dao Hen, who was grabbed by the Dragon Claw, revealed a look of despair. His ugly face looked at Wang Xian ferociously.

“How can a small mercenary group stop my footsteps?”

Wang Xian clenched his Dragon Claw. One of Dao Hen’s eyeballs almost popped out. The life force in his body slowly disappeared.

“Peng!”

Wang Xian threw it casually and threw it on the ground.

His gaze swept across the area. The members of the knife scar mercenary group and more than ten other experts were all killed!

“Dragon King!”

Ao Yaoao Jian and the rest bowed and shouted.

“Search their interspatial rings and put away their corpses!”

Wang Xian ordered.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

The members of the Dragon Palace replied.

Wang Xian had a thought. He transformed back into his human form. He lifted his head slightly and heaved a sigh of relief.

“In the future, the Celestial Phoenix mercenary group will be considered to be in the top spot in Shenghai Town!”

Wang Xian revealed a confident expression. In less than half a month, his strength and Ao Jian and AO Yaoyao’s strength had improved tremendously.

“Dragon King, it has been taken care of!”

Ao Jian reported to him very quickly.

“Then, let’s go out!”

Wang Xian moved and came to the position where the formation was placed.

It was a light and shadow barrier. It was an extraordinary level eight formation. The activation of the formation required spirit stones to maintain.

“The formation is not under attack. The spirit stones are not consumed at all!”

Wang Xian took a glance and smiled. He picked it up slowly.

Retract!

The formation was retracted and the black curtain covering a radius of 3,000 meters disappeared.

However, at this moment, outside the city, a group of city guards were cleaning up the corpses of ferocious beasts.

They occasionally looked at the position of the formation, their eyes filled with curiosity

On the city wall, all the mercenary groups didn’t leave either.

Even the mayor, Jin Qianyuan, didn’t leave either, his gaze was fixed on the position of the formation. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

They were also waiting for the disappearance of the formation, waiting for the final result.

“It disappeared, the formation disappeared!”

At this moment, when the formation disappeared, everyone on the city wall was in an uproar. Their eyes were fixed on it.

The experts of the blade scar mercenary group wanted to destroy the Immortal Phoenix mercenary group, but they were surrounded by the formation.

They couldn’t see the situation inside clearly.

Was it the Immortal Phoenix mercenary group that was destroyed, or something else?

“Eh? Where are the members of the Sword Scar Mercenary Group?”

As soon as the array disappeared, everyone looked over with surprise on their faces.

“Only... Only the members of the Immortal Phoenix mercenary group? Could it be... could it be...”

Everyone was stunned. Below them, there were only twelve members of the Immortal Phoenix mercenary group.

A handsome young man stood proudly in the center.

Beside him, eleven subordinates stood respectfully on both sides.

Looking down on Saint Sea Town!
