“Dragon King, it might be a little difficult for us to kill these eight beasts with our strength!”

In the Abyss, the four elders of the Dragon Python group felt that Wang Xian’s words were unbelievable and immediately spoke up!

“The four of you from the Dragon Python Group, you guys will be able to pin down the three immortal king level eight Abyss species. Is that Alright?”

Upon hearing their words, Wang Xian’s body moved and flew straight towards them!

“Of course there’s no problem with three of them. With our strength, we can’t kill three of them, but we can trap them to death!”

The chairman of the Dragon Python Group replied immediately!

They had the dragon Python divine shield, so their attacks might not be the best among the level eight immortal king abyssal seeds. However, their defense was definitely incomparable to the other level eight immortal king abyssal seeds!

“Alright, you guys trap three of them!”

Wang Xian nodded immediately!

Whoosh

As soon as he finished his sentence, bei Shuang’s figure appeared beside Wang Xian!

“Leave the other five to us!”

Wang Xian shouted softly. He stretched out his arm, and an incomparably huge dragon claw attacked the abyssal seed in front of him!

Whoosh

Bei Shuang, who was at the side, also stretched out her frost claws. Two incomparably huge claws attacked!

“Whoosh! Whoosh!”

On the arrow platform, Mou Zesen drew his bow and arrow fully. He directly locked onto an immortal king level 8 abyssal seed. The arrow instantly shot out!

“Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!”

At this moment, dragon peak trembled slightly. Three thorny monsters that were formed from the entanglement of thorns flew directly towards Wang Xian. One by one, the thorny monsters attacked the immortal king level 8 abyssal seed!

In an instant, five undying godly monarch abyss species were attacked by Wang Xian and the rest!

“This... Dragon Palace was able to kill five level 8 undying godly monarch abyss species?”

Everyone from the Dragon Python group looked over with a look of surprise!

“Old Fang, look, there are so many powerful warriors from the Dragon Palace in Dragon Mountain!”

However, at this moment, a level 8 powerhouse from the Dragon Python group looked towards Dragon Mountain with a look of surprise!

On the Dragon Mountain, powerful archers were slaughtering the abyss species in large numbers!

Some undying level 7 abyss species couldn’t even withstand the attacks of the abyss species!

The arrows were like the scythe of death!

Other than the arrows, there was also the fiery golden sword, each of which had the strength of an undying god King!

“Good, good, good. From now on, our disciples will have fewer deaths. The Dragon Palace is very strong, and the Dragon Peak is also very heaven-defying!”

The four level 8 powerhouses of the dragon Python group heaved a sigh of relief!

No matter what, they had overcome the crisis this time!

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom

At this moment, the battle between Wang Xian and the other abyss species had completely erupted!

Wang Xian, bei Shuang, Mu Zesen, and the three thorny monsters that could kill an immortal king level eight formation. Six level eight monsters versus five level eight monsters!

Most importantly, Ao Yao was still waiting for an opportunity to make a move. Once he made a move, it would be the moment when an immortal King Abyss seed fell!

The battle erupted. The thorny monsters were suppressing the three abyss seeds while Wang Xian and Mu Zesen were attacking one abyss seed while bei Shuang was dealing with one alone!

Violent attacks and chaotic energy!

The situation at the dragon Python group stabilized immediately. On the contrary, they were slaughtering the abyssal seeds on the ground!

“Hiss, the Dragon Palace is so strong. They can actually suppress five level eight abyssal seeds!”

“The frost goddess was also called over by the Dragon King. The Frost Goddess is also very strong. Be it in terms of defense or attack, she is very powerful!”

“The Dragon Palace is much stronger than us. Furthermore, this might not even be the full strength of the Dragon Palace!”

“We owe the Dragon Palace a huge favor this time!” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

One minute after the battle erupted, the four level 8 powerhouses from the Dragon Python group looked over and spoke!

Their tone was filled with relief!

“Even if the Dragon Palace can’t destroy the level 8 abyssal seed this time, they are strong enough to withstand it!”

A smile appeared on the face of the chairman of the Dragon Python Group!

“PFFT!”

Just as the chairman of the Dragon Python Group finished his sentence, a pitch-black sharp claw pierced through the body of the abyssal seed that Wang Xian and Mou Zesen were attacking!

Following that, the scythe-like arm went straight for the abyssal seed’s body!

In the next moment, ao Yao’s two-meter-long body penetrated through the abyssal seed’s body directly!

“Die!”

Wang Xian shouted softly. His dragon claws clawed at the level eight abyssal seed from top to bottom!

Whoosh

...

When Mou Zesen saw that the level eight abyssal seed was severely injured, an arrow instantly shot toward the top of its head!

The level eight abyssal seed was not in a hurry to Dodge and was directly hit!

The destructive power of the laws was strangling the life force in its body!

The corner of Wang Xian’s mouth curled up slightly. He moved his body and rushed over to collect the corpse!

“Once I get rid of one, it will be easy!”

He muttered as his gaze landed on the abyssal seed that bei Shuang was fighting against!

Mu Zesen also shot his arrow at the abyssal seed!

After that, it would be four against one. It would be even easier to get rid of it!

“What! The Dragon Palace destroyed an immortal king level eight abyssal seed!”

At this time, without noticing, the group of warriors from the Dragon Python group looked over again, suddenly discovering that one level 8 abyss seed had been destroyed, their faces filled with shock!

“The Dragon Palace actually had the power to destroy those 5 level 8 abyss seeds?”

...

The 4 level 8 warriors from the Dragon Python group looked at each other, their faces filled with shock!

Under normal circumstances, in the Abyss, Undying Emperors couldn’t escape in an instant. To kill someone of the same level, at least 2 against 1 would give them a chance!

In fact, if they were like the Dragon Python group, with the Treasure Dragon Python Divine Shield, one person could block 2 attacks of the same level!

However right now, the Dragon Palace was actually able to kill a level 8 abyss seed so quickly!

The power the Dragon Palace displayed was only 6 undying level 8 warriors!

It was very, very hard to kill 5 out of 6!

However, what happened next shocked them all!

In less than a minute, another undying level 8 abyssal seed was killed!

This time, they noticed that there was another mysterious warrior hiding in the void!

That mysterious warrior, even they didn’t notice his existence!

“We’ve already killed two, the other three should be easy to kill!”

Two undying level 8s had been killed, the remaining three were only a matter of time!

The four warriors of the Dragon Python group were all shocked!

“Howl Howl Howl!”

The other three undying level 8s felt a sense of threat, they couldn’t help but become restless, attacking the Thorn Formation even more violently!

However, it was even more difficult for them to break through the brambles’defenses!

“There are still three left, finish them as soon as possible!”
