2702 2702 heroes gathered

“Let’s go to the imperial court.”

On the ancient Sky Planet, Wang Xian led ao Qitian and the three dragon guards to the teleportation formation.

There were only people from the Dragon Palace on the ancient Sky Planet and no one else.

On this planet, there was a teleportation formation leading to the imperial court.

The five of them entered the formation and disappeared instantly.

When they reappeared, they were already on a planet of the imperial court.

“Welcome, heroes, to the imperial court.”

Just as they walked out, a mechanical voice sounded.

This voice stunned Wang Xian slightly as he looked around.

In front of him, there was a huge and eye-catching sign. On it, it said, “Welcome, heroes of the Imperial Star Field to the imperial court and make a name for themselves.”.

“It seems that the imperial court attaches great importance to the experts from other places in the Imperial Star Field.”

Wang Xian mumbled.

“My Lords, are you from the Abyss Battlefield?”

At this moment, a beautiful lady walked over and asked them respectfully.

“Yes!”

Wang Xian nodded his head.

“My Lords, we have a special teleportation formation here to the Abyss battlefield. You can reach it directly. Please follow me.”

The beautiful lady led Wang Xian and the rest to a spot at the side.

“It seems like the imperial court has made sufficient preparations!”

Wang Xian said faintly.

This planet was only a subordinate planet among the many vital planets of the imperial court. This subordinate planet had a teleportation formation that could teleport them directly to the battlefield, one could imagine that the imperial court had made sufficient preparations to welcome the arrival of the experts from the imperial star field.

“Yes, my lords. Those who came to the Abyss battlefield are the heroes of our Imperial Star Field. Naturally, our imperial court will do the logistical work well.”

“The teleportation formation is right in front of us. I wish all of you to make a name for yourselves in the Abyss battlefield and achieve meritorious deeds.”

The beautiful lady bowed and gestured respectfully.

“This is much more convenient.”

Wang Xian walked straight towards the teleportation formation. Initially, he thought that he would need a few days to obtain it.

This would only take a few minutes, which was very convenient.

After stepping into the teleportation formation, he did not even need to pay for the god Stones to teleport directly.

“There are so many people. Looks like there are quite a number of powerhouses coming to the Abyss battlefield this time!”

“The treasures that the imperial court took out this time are too attractive. Even quite a number of immortal godly monarchs who are in seclusion have rushed over.”

“Everyone knows that they have become famous after a battle. I heard that the Imperial Court has established a heroes ranking board, which is based on merit points. This has attracted many powerhouses who want to rise to the top.”

“As long as you accumulate enough merit points, you can join the imperial court. This is something that many people want to achieve.”

“I heard that the Heavenly Sword King from Pingyi Island is here too. I wonder if it’s true or not. This is an existence at the peak of the Immortal King Realm.”

Very soon, the bustling voices entered their ears. Wang Xian and the rest appeared on a huge square.

This square was so huge that it had no boundaries. The entire planet must have been used as a teleportation formation.

In the sky, there were four big words. Heroes were gathered.

In the surrounding area, there were also some more eye-catching buildings. The names of the buildings were all exactly the same. It was the Merit Exchange Place.

“There are really quite a number of powerhouses.”

Wang Xian swept his gaze across the surroundings. A hint of surprise appeared on his face.

With a glance, there were at least 4,000 to 5,000 immortal king realm experts.

“It seems that this hero gathering might have more than 100,000 or even more immortal King realm experts.”

He mumbled. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The Emperor Star Field was huge. The crisis in the abyss this time mainly came from the imperial court and the three big islands. The other places were not affected.

The Imperial Star Field had a vast territory. No one knew how many powerhouses were hidden in it.

Putting everything else aside, there were at least millions of powerhouses above King God level.

The items that the imperial court took out this time were indeed very attractive.

“Let’s go to the planet in front.”

Wang Xian looked at the position on the AI. His body moved and he immediately flew towards the planet in front.

There were hundreds of planets in front of him. These planets were arranged in a row and one could see experts flying on them.

In front of these hundreds of planets were meteorites of all shapes and sizes.

Roars could be heard from the depths of the meteorites.

It was the Abyss!

...

There were experts entering and exiting the abyss from time to time.

“On this planet.”

Wang Xian came to the top of a planet. Sensing the location of the members of the Dragon Palace, he flew over immediately.

Not long ago, Wang Xian sent an immortal king level eight and three immortal king level seven powerhouses to follow di Xing nu under her command.

Wang Xian came to the top of a palace. His yin-yang five elements dragon eyes swept across and landed in a large hall.

There were more than a dozen figures in the hall. Among them, there was di Xing Nu.

He did not greet her. His body moved and landed directly in front of the hall.

He swept his gaze across the surroundings and immediately walked into the hall.

“Eh?”

In the hall, more than a dozen young and middle-aged men were sitting there. They were slightly stunned when they saw Wang Xian who came in suddenly.

Di Xing nu immediately stood up. Her face was filled with surprise and joy.

...

“Who are you?”

A young man looked at Wang Xian and asked with a slight frown.

“Wang Xian!”

However, at this moment, di Xingnu stood up directly. Her face was filled with surprise and joy. She immediately walked towards Wang Xian.

“Why did you rush over so quickly?”

Di Xingnu walked to his side and said while grabbing his arm.

“Your imperial court’s teleportation formation is quite convenient. We’ll be there in a few minutes.”

Wang Xian said faintly.

“Xingnu, who is he?”

In the main hall, everyone was astonished when they saw Wang Xian.

This was especially so for the young man who spoke just now. When he saw di Xingnu holding onto the arm of a young man intimately, his expression was a little ugly. He sized up Wang Xian and asked with a dark expression.

“Him?”

When di Xingnu saw the dark expression on the young man’s face, the corner of her lips curled up slightly. “My friend, I’m sorry. My Friend is here. I need to entertain him.”

“Brother Fa, Brother Ma, I’m sorry. We’ll talk again tomorrow.”

As she spoke, she waved at the middle-aged men beside her and pulled Wang Xian’s arm. “Let’s go. I need to entertain you properly.”

Wang Xian looked at her with a smile and followed behind her.

At the back, the young man’s expression changed as he watched this scene.

The other middle-aged men looked at Wang Xian with a contemplative look on their faces. They exchanged a glance and left immediately.

“Go and check out the identity of that young man.”

The young man clenched his fists tightly as he watched the disappearing figures of di Xing Nu, Wang Xian, and the rest. He shouted at the two middle-aged men beside him.

“It’s young master.”

The two middle-aged men nodded immediately.

“I just arrived and you’re using me as a shield. That’s not good, is it?”

Following di Xingnu to a courtyard, Wang Xian looked at her and said with a smile.

“That guy is too disgusting. He’s not even as handsome as you, yet he wants a toad to eat swan meat. HMPH.”

Di Xingnu raised her head slightly and said with a light snort.
