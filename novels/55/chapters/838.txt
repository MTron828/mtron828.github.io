Translator: 549690339

“Hahaha, I am the Thunder Immortal, the immortal god of the Ji Clan. All beings come to worship me!”

“I am Ling Tian Xian, the immortal god of the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect!”

“I am Xuan Yuan, a sword that breaks mountains, Xuan Yuan Broken Mountains, the Xuan Yuan clan!”

“I am the supreme of the boundless four directions, the Yuwen clan!”

...

Time slowly passed. In a month’s time, the spiritual energy had calmed down, and the spiritual energy on Earth had reached a terrifying level.

Fifty times the amount of spiritual energy on Earth, fifty times the amount on Earth in the past. To those cultivators, this was simply a great opportunity that had fallen from the heavens.

Two months. In just two months, the Huaxia Immortal sect had increased by ten immortal gods.

Those half-step immortal gods with powerful and deep foundations finally obtained an opportunity under this terrifying spiritual energy. They took the final step and stepped into the immortal God realm.

It was not only the Huaxia Immortal sect, but also the divine realm. It didn’t take long for some experts to become gods and obtain divine seats.

This was the best ERA for Warriors!

“We can hear the voices of immortal gods every day. They are really high-profile!”

“Yes, yes. Each of them is extremely arrogant. Humph, they don’t know how to be low-profile at all!”

Inside the Dragon Palace, a group of girls pouted and said disdainfully when they heard the faint immortal voice.

“The human world is very interesting now. In the past, we used to call each other brother Tai, but now we call each other fellow Daoists. How interesting!”

“In the past, we practiced martial arts, but now we call ourselves immortal cultivators. Because in this era, everyone has the chance to become immortal, so we call each other fellow Daoists directly. Haha!”

“That voice just now belonged to that guy, Feng Lingtian. Xiao Yu, Hehe, I haven’t seen you for two months. Do You Miss Him?”

Guan Shuqing, Lan Qingyue, and the other girls teased.

Even Tang Yinxuan joined in.

Regardless of how the girls were like in the past, they gathered together every day now. Everyone was more lively.

“Alright, sisters-in-law, Big Brother is about to break through!”

Xiao Yu’s face was slightly red. She quickly spoke to them and looked at Wang Xian, who was in the middle of the Dragon King Palace.

Apart from them, all the members of the entire Dragon Palace were gathered around. The eighty immortal gods in the Dragon King Palace were standing there respectfully.

In the outside world, the group of people from the Immortal Sect’s divine realm had broken through to the immortal God realm. In the Dragon Palace, the speed of their breakthrough was even more terrifying.

Now in the outside world, the spirit gathering array was basically useless because of the rich spiritual energy. With the low-level spirit gathering array on Earth, it was no longer enough to gather spiritual energy. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

But the Dragon Palace was different. The spiritual energy density in the Dragon King Palace was still twelve times that in the outside world, and the Dragon Cave was eight times that in the outside world.

Under this terrifying increase, the Dragon Palace had dozens of immortal gods in just two months.

With time, the number of immortals in the Dragon Palace could reach hundreds or even thousands.

Therefore, when the group of girls heard the news of him being a god, they found it a little funny.

“Finally, I’m going to break through!”

Wang Xian looked at the dragon energy that was only a few hundred away and his eyes were filled with excitement.

He had finally completed the first change of the Divine Dragon. He was finally going to take the first step into the Divine Dragon, which was also the most important step.

Originally, a divine dragon would possess the strength of the first transformation when he was born. However, due to the system, he needed to cultivate on his own.

In other words, entering the first transformation of the divine dragon was equivalent to becoming a newborn divine dragon.

“Roar! Breakthrough!”

The moment the dragon energy reached one billion, Wang Xian’s body turned into 15 meters in size.

“Ding! The spiritual energy has reached one billion. The first transformation of the divine dragon has been completed. Your level has increased and you have advanced to transcendence!”

“Ding! Congratulations to the host for completing the first transformation of the Divine Dragon. The system has been upgraded!”

“Ding! Congratulations to the host for completing the first transformation of the Divine Dragon and comprehending the supernatural powers!”

“Ding! The host is the divine dragon of the five elements and has comprehended the supernatural powers of the five elements!”!

“Ding! The system has all been upgraded. Upgrading in progress...”

At this moment, a series of system notifications rang out. It was the first time Wang Xian had heard the system talk so much. It was also the first time he felt that this was a freaking system!

At this very moment, Wang Xian’s body underwent a huge transformation.

His body grew from 15 meters to 25 meters. His body was emitting a five-colored glow.

Metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. Finally, the five-colored glow slowly blended together and formed a circular shape.

Boom

A terrifying energy burst out from Wang Xian’s body. It was a suppressive and endless suppressive force.

His golden head was extremely sacred. Six fiery red dragon whiskers were emitting a dazzling luster.

His golden claws were emitting a terrifying sharpness, as though they could tear apart the starry sky.

The earthen yellow dragon scales were emitting a thick and heavy aura, giving off an indestructible feeling.

At his abdomen, the green radiance was extremely dazzling. A rich vitality was spreading throughout his body.

Her aqua-blue tail was filled with intelligence.

The five Elemental Divine Dragon!

This terrifying aura was several times stronger than when the empress, Feng Luan, had advanced.

If she were still here, she would probably be filled with shock.

“Five elemental divine abilities: burning the river and boiling the sea, shattering the void with gold, descending of the wood world, water crisis and the wrath of the Earth!”

Wang Xian slowly opened his eyes. The golden glow flickered with an icy-cold sharpness.

“Ding, the system upgrade is completed. The ancestor of all trees, ancestral tree, has comprehended the supernatural ability soul capture, endless vision, and spirit possession!”

“Ding, system mission activated, Main Mission: Rule the ocean of Worlds, build the Dragon Palace of Worlds, and restore the glory of the Divine Dragon!”

“Ding, the system has issued a mission to unify the Earth’s ocean. Reward: thorned dragon species!”

“Ding, the system shopping mall has been activated!”

“Boom!”

At this moment, Wang Xian’s mind seemed to have exploded.

A terrifying scene appeared in his mind. A huge battle, a terrifying battle. Thousands of divine dragons and countless members of the Dragon Palace were engaged in a battle against the densely packed and endless bug race.

A Sea of bugs, an endless sea of bugs.

Blood flowed like a river, and the battle erupted. There was no sky, no earth, and only an endless void.

This battle could no longer be described as tragic.

“Hong!”

In the end, the endless sea of bugs was destroyed, and thousands of divine dragons and members of the Dragon Palace were also killed and injured.

“My Divine Dragon Clan, exterminating the world bug clan is a great merit. One day, the Invincible Divine Dragon, the invincible clan, will rule the ocean and become the master of the oceans!”

A voice rang in his mind. Soon after, he saw a drop of blood condensed from the blood on the battlefield. It traveled through time and space and disappeared! “Oh?”

At this moment, Wang Xian slowly regained his senses. His face was filled with shock and joy.
