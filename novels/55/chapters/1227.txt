Chapter 1228: 1229 dragon and Phoenix grocery store

Translator: 5496903

Aspect: Purple Thunder striding through the air!

The supernatural ability of the Spirit Zilin!

Wang Xian had a deep understanding of the supernatural ability of the Spirit Zilin. Even when facing the territory of fire, it was able to stomp it to pieces.

“Dong Dong Dong!”

A dull sound rang out. It was as deafening as spring thunder. Purple Thunderbolts gathered under the front hooves of the Spirit Zilin.

Terrifying energy filled the surroundings. If they were not in the sky, if they were not surrounded by the earth sealing aspect, they would have been able to destroy everything within a five to six kilometer radius.

“Ah, die!”

The Nine Star Dynasty’s insightful void martial artist revealed a desperate expression. Around him, more than ten meter long crimson-gold blades revolved around him, directly attacking Ling Zilin and the blood evil turtle.

When the two beasts saw his attack, their eyes were still filled with ferocity and violence.

“Roar!”

“Roar!”

Ling Zilin charged forward. His front hooves stepped in the air, and lightning tore through the air. From Afar, it seemed as if space had split apart.

The blood evil turtle also roared, and the surrounding earth sealing aspect rapidly pressed over.

Earth sealing not only had the ability to seal space, but it could also unleash terrifying attacks.

Otherwise, it could not be called a divine ability.

“Weng!”

Three Dharma images and three terrifying attacks charged forward at a terrifying speed.

Everyone in the surroundings watched this scene with shocked expressions.

Even on those large buildings, many experts at the profound void tier were standing on them, coldly watching the battle over here.

A battle at the profound void tier, and one that required one to fight to the death, was not something that could be seen frequently in the LADYBOY graveyard.

Every profound void tier expert cherished their lives very much. Without absolute confidence, two profound void tier experts rarely faced each other in life and death.

Moreover, it was somewhat difficult to kill a profound void tier expert.

If the other expert were to escape with his life, it would be very difficult to kill a profound void tier expert.

But here, there was clearly some surprise.

Two level one profound void tier dire beasts against an ordinary profound void tier expert. Most importantly, the Blood Fiend Turtle’s Earth sealing divine ability.

This ability was most powerful in terms of defense and sealing.

“Die, die, die, die!”

Boom! Boom! Boom

Purple Lightning stepped into the air, earth sealing, Golden Blade Huan Yu!

Purple Lightning stepped into the air and clashed with Golden Blade Huan Yu, emitting a terrifying aura of destruction.

The Nine Star dynasty void interpretation expert revealed a crazed expression.

If he couldn’t block this attack, he would die.

The Golden Blade Huan Yu and the purple lightning stomp collided, and the two terrifying energies quickly dissipated.

More than ten golden blades quickly dissipated.

“It’s over!”

At this moment, what made the nine Star Dynasty’s void interpretation expert despair was that the Earth Seal’s attack had arrived. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

The earth seal used four thousand meter thick earth walls to press towards the enemy.

As it pressed down, the earth seal became smaller and smaller, finally forming a thick yellow earth stone.

Under the control of the blood evil turtle, the earth stone passed through the side of the spirit purple qilin and directly pressed down on the insightful emptiness realm expert.

The nine Star dynasty insightful emptiness realm expert, who was already at a disadvantage, was once again struck by the Earth Seal.

The golden blade quickly collapsed.

“Ah!”

An unwilling scream sounded out, but it quickly stopped.

The Nine Star Dynasty’s insightful void tier powerhouse directly collapsed.

Dead!

The death of the insightful void tier powerhouse caused the fat youth, Jiuquan Liang, who was standing at the side, to look ashen.

Behind him, the five young men and women who were still alive also had expressions of despair.

Since the insightful void tier powerhouse was dead, what strength did they have to resist?

None at all!

They looked at Jiuquan Liang, who was standing in front of them, with a savage expression.

If it weren’t for this damned fellow, if they had killed this damned fat pig just now, how could they have faced such a situation.

They hated him!

“Crackle crackle!”

Just as Jiuquan Liang and the other three were filled with despair, the lightning of death had already arrived.

Ling Zilin flicked his tail disdainfully, and a bolt of purple lightning landed directly on the six of them. However, there were seven or eight extraordinary realm cultivators and even six realm cultivators who died under Ling Zilin’s lightning.

It was as if they had never been to this world before.

“It’s over!”

When the surrounding people saw this scene, they were slightly shocked.

They saw two incomparably savage beasts come to the side of the young man, and their eyes flickered.

Some of them looked at the unimpressive grocery store behind them. The name of the Dragon and Phoenix grocery store also caught the attention of many people.

“Haha, Good, good. Brother Wang Xian, these two ferocious beasts of yours are really powerful!”

Long Xiaotian’s eyes were slightly shocked when he saw an insightful void martial artist being killed on the spot. He said loudly with a face full of joy.

“They are the ones who are courting death. They came to my shop to collect fees and even wanted to take my things!”

Wang Xian shook his head lightly and said.

“They deserve to die. However, other than them, there are also some people who deserve to die!”

As Long Xiaotian spoke, he turned his head and looked at Yin Xianfeng and the rest behind the eighth prince. His eyes were filled with mockery.

Wang Xian also turned his head and looked over with a smile.

“HMPH!”

Yin Xianfeng’s expression was extremely awkward. He turned his head and looked to the side.

“Hehe, impressive, impressive. This brother Wang Xian’s strength is really impressive. I’m sorry for offending you just now!”

When the eighth prince saw Long Xiaotian with his head held high and a cold smile on his face, his expression was also extremely awkward. He took a deep breath and cupped his hands at Wang Xian.

“Let’s Go!”

As he spoke, he shouted with a solemn face. He turned around and was about to leave.

When Long Xiaotian saw the eighth prince leaving with an embarrassed expression, he was in a great mood and felt extremely happy.

“Eighth prince, did I ask you to leave?”

At this moment, a voice suddenly sounded.

Long Xiaotian who was at the side was slightly stunned. He looked at Wang Xian who was beside him in astonishment.

Even the eighth prince, who had just taken two steps, froze.

“What? You’re such a brother? Do you still want to keep me here?”

The eighth Prince turned his head slowly with a gloomy face. His eyes were staring at Wang Xian as he said coldly.

“Are you here to kill me and still want to return safely?”

Wang Xian looked at the eighth Prince’s cold gaze and smiled.

He walked forward slowly until he was about 100 meters away from the eighth prince.

Beside him, Ling Zilin and the blood evil turtle were following him. Their bloodthirsty and brutal eyes were staring at the eighth Prince and the rest.

“Haha, Hahaha!”

When the eighth prince heard Wang Xian’s words, he suddenly burst into laughter.

He stared at Wang Xian and his smile slowly disappeared. His eyes turned cold.

“You won’t let me return safely? Do you have the ability to do so? Do you have the ability to touch me? Do you have the right to touch me?”

The eighth Prince pointed at Wang Xian with disdain in his eyes.

So what if he had two beasts at the insightful void tier?
