Translator: 549690339

In the central area of bridge forest town, tens of thousands of people gathered around.

In the sky, the mayor and a group of city guards were floating in the sky, looking down at everyone.

But at this moment, the atmosphere around them became strange.

In the sky, a red piece of paper appeared out of thin air and floated in the direction of the mayor, Lin Xiao.

It was a piece of paper congratulating death.

Everyone around widened their eyes in disbelief.

Lin Xiao was also stunned. He looked at the red piece of paper floating towards him with a trace of fear in his eyes. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

An assassin organization that could assassinate the strongest person in the Lin family. If they wanted to assassinate him, the success rate could reach 80% .

He was transferred to Qiao Lin Town. When he arrived, the Lin family was already the strongest family in Qiao Lin Town.

The resources of the Lin family were not something that he, the mayor, could compare to.

His strength was also a little weaker than the strongest person in the Lin family.

The red paper seemed to have eyes. At least a hundred pieces of paper landed on Lin Xiao’s body.

Lin Xiao’s face was extremely gloomy. He raised his head and scanned the surroundings.

“Hiss!”

The city guards behind Lin Xiao looked at the red paper on the mayor’s body with fear. Their faces kept changing.

Right now, the dragon Spike’s congratulatory death was as terrifying as a life-threatening talisman.

“All of it landed on the mayor. Could it be... could it be that the dragon Spike wants to assassinate the Mayor?”

“Isn’t this too crazy? is he going against star-moon kingdom?”

When the surrounding people saw this scene, they gulped, their faces filled with shock.

“Dragon Spike, do you know what you’re doing? You’re making an enemy out of star-moon kingdom. If you dare to assassinate me, star-moon kingdom will not let you off!”

Lin Xiao slowly turned around in the air and growled in a low voice with a gloomy face.

“Dragon Spike, reward good and punish evil. Bridge Forest Town’s mayor, Lin Xiao, has raised 50 million middle-grade spiritual stones from a hundred people. For those who are evil, the number of assassins hired will be halved. He meets the criteria!”

“Protect the Lin family and fight against our dragon Spike assassin organization. Congratulations on your death. You are now the one who must be killed by the dragon Spike!”

At this moment, a voice came from the sky and everyone was shocked.

Lin Xiao suddenly turned his head and stared at the east.

The surrounding people also sucked in a breath of cold air.

“Awesome, an assassin organization rewards good and punishes evil. F * ck, the most unexpected thing is that there are a hundred people supporting the assassination of the mayor. They have already raised 50 million middle-grade spirit stones!”

“This is too crazy, this dragon assassin organization is simply too awesome. I’m completely convinced!”

“They actually raised 50 million middle-grade spirit stones, and only raised 10 million middle-grade spirit stones at noon. Looks like there are really quite a number of people who want the mayor dead!”

“Where did they raise the money? What’s the contact information of the Dragon Assassin organization? How come we don’t Know?”

The surrounding people discussed in hushed tones, and shock appeared on their faces.

Those who didn’t know about the crowdfunding were filled with astonishment as they asked in hushed tones.

“Crowdfunding?”

Lin Xiao’s expression instantly darkened. Crowdfunding? There was actually someone who wanted to kill him, and they had already raised fifty million middle-grade spirit stones.

This caused his expression to be incomparably unsightly, and a trace of fear flashed through his eyes.

“If you dare to kill me, star-moon kingdom will uproot all of you, turning you into street rats!”

Lin Xiao’s expression darkened as he roared loudly.

“Weng!”

Right at this moment, the space trembled slightly.

Lin Xiao’s expression changed, and his face was filled with terror as he scanned his surroundings.

A black and white figure suddenly appeared behind him. His expression changed drastically, and his entire body emitted violent water currents.

“Boom!”

At this moment, a black and white space instantly appeared in the sky.

Half of the black and white space instantly covered an area of 2,000 meters.

The entire space was filled with dense light and deep darkness. It looked extremely terrifying.

“F * ck, what’s Going On?”

“The dragon Spike is making a move!”

“What is this? An Array Formation?”

Everyone was shocked when they saw the black-and-white space.

The city guards who were standing beside the mayor almost wet their pants in fear as they fled in fear.

Their eyes were filled with fear as they looked at the space.

On the streets, everyone was staring at the black-and-white space.

The black-and-white space was a divine ability ao Yao had obtained after breaking through to the type 5 transcendence realm.

The name of the divine ability was light and darkness.

It was a support-type body, and to the dragonspine, it was a powerful support-type ability.

It could use the light and darkness energy in its body to create a space that was beneficial for their battle.

Within this space, its speed and strength could reach 150% of its normal speed.

This space could last for five minutes.

However, five minutes was enough.

“How Dare You Assassinate Me? You Dragon Thorns deserve to die!”

Lin Xiao’s furious voice came from the black-and-white space.

“Pu!”

“What?”

However, soon, Lin Xiao’s terrified voice was heard, followed by a violent current. Blue seawater appeared in the black-and-white space.

“Die!”

Obviously, the power of the supernatural power was wreaking havoc in this space. The violent flow of water rolled, as if there was an ocean in it.

“This... They are fighting!”

“They are really assassinating Mayor Lin Xiao. This... The dragon spike is too powerful!”

“Is mayor Lin Xiao going to be killed?”

“The powerful warrior of the Lin family has been assassinated. Lin Xiao probably won’t be able to escape the assassination of the dragon Spike!”

Shocked voices came one after another. Everyone looked at the area in the sky with shocked faces.

To assassinate the mayor of a town openly in a town, only an assassin organization like long CI would dare to do so!

“How could this be? How could this be?”

On the street, a group of people from the Lin family raised their heads in fear, their bodies trembling.

The dragon Spike dared to assassinate the mayor. What was the Lin family worth then?

“It’s over, the Lin family is finished!”

Lin Feng mumbled. Regardless of whether the dragon spike succeeded in assassinating the mayor or not, the Lin family was finished.

The mayor could not intimidate the dragon spike. The only outcome waiting for them was death.

Lin Feng was in a daze. At this moment, he felt a gaze looking at him.

He raised his head and saw Wang Xian’s smiling face. He gritted his teeth and his eyes were bloodshot.

If it wasn’t for him, if it wasn’t for this Celestial Phoenix mercenary group, he would still be the young master of the Lin family. No one would dare to offend him.

“You Want to kill me? Wishful Thinking!”

Suddenly, a roar was heard. Following that, everyone noticed a black shadow flying out from the black and white space.

His hair was messy, and his eyes were full of ferocity. He stared at the black-and-white space coldly.

“What? The mayor escaped?”

“No, look behind Lin Xiao!”
