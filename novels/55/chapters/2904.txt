Chapter 2905: relied on the magical power of the Dragon Palace

“Bang, Bang, Bang!”

The sound of knocking could be heard from the place where the sky array lived.

“Hehehe, since you’re older than me, it’s not a disadvantage to call you grandpa. It’s not a disadvantage to kowtow either. It seems that I’ll have to cling tightly to the old master of the sky array from now on.”

Not long after, invincible battle technique walked out of the room with a smile on his face.

“The treasure in my hand is simply heaven-defying. Killing a first level God emperor like a dog, GA Ga Ga!” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“No, I want to go to Big Brother Fiend Eight Qi’s place to see if there are any treasures!”

Invincible battle technique’s eyes lit up as he immediately flew towards the eight Qi Fiend.

“Ah Ah Ah!”

“Kill me, kill me!”

When they had just arrived in front of the dragon cave where the eight Qi Fiend lived, they heard an incomparably painful scream.

“This won’t do, Demon Fiend. The poison is a little weak. It Won’t have much of an effect on the god Emperor!”

“Sigh, it’s indeed a little difficult to deal with. The poison we produced won’t be able to threaten the god Emperor.”

The eight-limbed demon fiend duo’s helpless voices sounded.

“These two big brothers are indeed abnormal!”

Invincible battle technique stood at the entrance and muttered.

He was still aware of the agonizing scream from inside.

Five months ago, a divine emperor had suddenly appeared in the Heaven Magus region.

This divine emperor was an old fellow who had been in seclusion for hundreds of thousands of years. According to him, he had been in seclusion for 500,000 years.

He had not come out for 500,000 years precisely because he wanted to break through to the divine emperor realm.

Finally, the heavens did not disappoint those who had a heart. After 500,000 years, he had finally broken through.

After breaking through, this fellow was arrogant. After he came out, he suppressed the entire planet.

Many weak people died under his suppression.

However, he did not care about the death of ordinary people.

In the end, this fellow was unlucky.

The news immediately spread to the dragon-phoenix divine dynasty. In the end, it happened to be known by the eight-limbed demon duo. They said that they lacked people to experiment on, so they brought a wind god Dragon and charged over.

In the end, the divine emperor had just broken through and was punished.

That fellow was taken to the Dragon Palace in a daze and was treated as the eight-limbed demon Fiend’s poison tester.

“Cough cough, Big Brother eight-limbed demon fiend, this little brother, invincible of battle techniques, is here to visit.”

Invincible of battle techniques shouted at the door.

“Hey, Little Brother is here. Come in, come in.”

Demon Fiend’s enthusiastic voice came from inside.

“Good, good!”

Invincible of battle techniques walked in and saw an extremely miserable old man tied inside. His body trembled.

However, his heart was alive.

In the Dragon Palace, the most shameless and cunning people were the two big brothers in front of him.

It was absolutely practical to get some life-saving battle items from these two big brothers.

“Big Brothers, I, invincible battle technique, have something to ask of you!”

Invincible battle technique immediately began to cry.

He kept calling them big brothers, Snot and tears.

“Kid, don’t play tricks on us. It’s useless. If you have something to say, just say it!”

Eight-headed swept him a glance and said directly.

“Hehe, the two big brothers are straightforward. They are handsome and handsome.”

“Big Brothers, I’m going to the glazed domain. Do you know the current situation of the glazed domain? Five God emperors have died. I’m afraid that I’ll lose my life if I go with master this time!”

“Big Brothers, take a look and see if there’s anything that can protect my life, be it defense or attack.”

“As the younger brother of the two big brothers and the younger brother of the Dragon King, I Can’t lose the people of our Dragon Palace when I go out, right?”

…

“Alright, we got it!”

Invincible battle technique wanted to continue crying, but he was interrupted by Mo Sha.

“We know what you’re thinking. You Can’t embarrass the Dragon Palace when you’re out. We have some newly researched toxins here. We can’t kill the Emperor God, but peak-stage king God experts will die if they touch it. Be careful when you use it yourself.”

“Also, give us feedback on the effects after you use it. See if there’s any need to improve!”

Mo Sha patted his shoulder and said.

“Hehe, the two big brothers are the most straightforward.”

Invincible raised his eyebrows and said with a smile.

“That’s right. Take it away. It’s no problem to kill more than ten peak godly monarchs.”

Mo Sha waved his arm and threw a jade bottle to him.

“Hehe, two big brothers, do you have any slightly more ordinary toxins, such as those to deal with eighth or ninth level godly monarchs?”

Invincible battle technique rubbed his hands together.

“Here!”

Ba Qi waved his hand casually and threw over a dozen jade bottles to him.

“Thank you, two Big Brothers. In the future, with just a word from you, I will go through fire and water at any cost!”

Invincible battle technique raised his head and roared loudly.

“Alright, Alright. If you have nothing else to do, Scram!”

The two of them waved their hands.

“Hehehe, the Dragon Palace is really rich and overbearing these days. They just casually throw out such treasures.”

Invincible in battle walked out with his eyeballs rolling.

Soon, he flew towards another mountain peak.

In less than ten minutes, he walked out with an interspatial ring in his hand excitedly.

“Brother Duan Jinming is so honest. In the entire Dragon Palace, only brother Jin Ming is a good person!”

He sighed slightly.

They got a water drop cannon from the fire hammer clan.

It had an ordinary name, but its power was very strong. It was a new war god weapon developed by the Fire Hammer clan.

The water droplet cannon was about a thousand meters in size. When injected with water elemental laws or water elemental god stones, it could kill a peak godly king expert.

“The current Dragon Palace is really invincible.”

Invincible in battle techniques sighed slightly.

Although he did not know how strong the Dragon Palace was, after controlling three territories, all kinds of resources were transported to the Dragon Palace every day.

This also made the Dragon Palace develop abnormally fast.

When he entered the place where the fire hammer clan lived, he almost drooled.

With enough resources, the Fire Hammer clan began to show their terrifying talent.

Especially after combining it with the Dragon Wizard’s spell formation and sorcery.

“Damn it, if I can still encounter danger in the glazed domain, then I really deserve to die.”

Invincible battle technique touched his waist bag, raised his head, and walked away.

It was no exaggeration to say that the weapon on his body could kill two or three god Emperors by catching them off guard.

“Master, Senior Brothers and sisters, let’s go. We’ll rush there through the teleportation array of the Dragon Palace. It’s much faster.”

Invincible battle technique said with a smile when he returned to his master.

“Okay.”

The God Emperor of Shangshui, his two senior brothers and one senior sister who was invincible in combat technique nodded.

The strongest senior brothers and sisters who were invincible in combat technique were only at the ninth level of the godly monarch realm.

It had only been a few hundred thousand years since the god Emperor of Shangshui broke through to the throne, and he had only taught his disciples for a few hundred thousand years.

Not every disciple was as freakish as invincible combat technique.

“On this trip to the glazed domain, you can just stay by my side. Don’t talk too much, especially you, Invincible.”

The god Emperor of Shangshui warned towards the invincible of the war.
