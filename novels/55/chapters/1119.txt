Chapter 1120: The 1121 Army had arrived

Translator: 5496903

On the transcendental continent, not only were there powerful kingdoms and empires, but there were also powerful sects, divine sects, and divine sects!

The Heavenly Moon sect was a powerful sect within the territory of star-moon kingdom.

The sect was located on the Heavenly Moon Island next to star-moon kingdom, and there were four to five experts at the profound void tier within the sect.

The sect master of the sect had the strength of a third-level profound void tier expert.

In the past, although the Heavenly Moon sect was located within the star-moon kingdom, because it was located on an island, the star-moon kingdom wasn’t able to restrict it at all.

Because the star-moon kingdom was afraid of the strength of the sect master of the Heavenly Moon sect, the two sides had always treated each other as equals.

The Heavenly Moon sect had over 20,000 disciples, and most of them were talented disciples recruited from the star-moon Kingdom’s major cities.

However, now that the Star Moon Kingdom’s King had broken through, it was obvious that he had suppressed the entire heavenly moon sect.

“The vice commander of the Star Moon Army also has the strength of a level two profound void martial artist, and in addition to the East Sea city’s city lord, a level one profound void martial artist. However, as far as I know, these people are definitely not the only ones who have arrived!”

Feng Luan said as she slightly frowned.

Currently, in dragon-phoenix City, there were only four profound void martial artists in addition to her.

However, she could not make a move because she wanted to act as a deterrent.

Generals versus generals, Kings versus Kings!

If even a king like her came out to fight, her strength would be exposed instantly. Star-moon kingdom would also understand that the strongest person in this Dragon-phoenix kingdom was a powerhouse at level three of the insightful void level!

If that was the case, the king of star-moon kingdom might fly over directly and destroy this place!

“Have you thought of a solution?”

Wang Xian looked at her frowning face and asked worriedly.

“We still don’t know the strength of our opponents. Star-moon kingdom doesn’t know our full strength either, so they will come over to test us!”

“War Against War!”

“War against Generals!”

“If star-moon kingdom has a crushing victory, star-moon kingdom will basically be able to test out the strength of dragon and Phoenix City!”

Feng Luan spoke one by one.

Although holy sea town was only a town, it was not that easy to take it down.

If he had chosen East Sea city back then, all the top-notch experts of star-moon kingdom would have gathered here by now.

There was still room for maneuver after taking down a town.

“Will the strength of the star-moon army be stronger than your subordinates?”

Wang Xian looked at Feng Luan. Her army of more than 1,000 people was at least a level seven supernatural realm expert. Although there were fewer people in this army, it was definitely very terrifying!

“Unless all the Elite Forces of the Star Moon Kingdom are mobilized, there really aren’t any experts with the strength of the Dragon and Phoenix Army!”

A smile appeared on Feng Luan’s face. She was very proud of building a powerful army within two years.

One had to know that a rank seven transcendent expert could build a pretty good family in a town.

A rank nine transcendent expert would be a peak expert in East Sea city.

“We’ll deal with it when the time comes.”

Feng Luan shook her head and looked at Guan Shuqing and the others. “Sisters, dragon-phoenix city is still under construction. There’s nothing fun about it, but I can bring you to try the delicacies here!”

“Sure, we haven’t tried the dishes here yet!”

The few girls nodded their heads excitedly.

“Oh right, Xiao Xian, what’s up with that beauty, Zhang Fengying?”

A Jiaya suddenly asked Wang Xian. She really wanted to see what that beauty who was even more popular than her looked like.

“This...”

Wang Xian revealed a bitter expression and told her everything helplessly.

A few girls glared at him but didn’t say anything. They walked out together with Feng Luan.

Feng Luan changed her appearance so that the citizens of Dragon Phoenix city wouldn’t be able to recognize her.

After staying in Dragon Phoenix city for two days in a row, Wang Xian accompanied Shu Qing and the rest out for a stroll during the day. In the afternoon, he went to visit Zhang Fengying and felt a lot more relaxed.

“Reporting to your majesty, there’s news from the front. There’s a large group of people heading towards our Dragon Phoenix City!”

On the morning of the third day, Jin Qianyuan anxiously came to the hall and reported loudly.

“Are they here?”

Feng Luan directly stood up with a solemn expression on her face.

“Have you estimated the strength of the other party?”

Feng Luan directly walked toward the East Gate and said with a gloomy face and cold eyes.

“The flag of the Star Moon Army has a total of 10,000 people. There are also over 10,000 people in East Sea City, a total of 20,000 people. We don’t know exactly how many experts there are, but the Black Fiend Battle Team of the Star Moon Army is here. We don’t know who is the void interpretation expert!”

“Mang Hong and the other two lords have already left the city to welcome them!”

Jin Qianyuan reported with an embarrassed expression.

“Has the Black Fiend Battle team made their move?”

Feng Luan’s face revealed a trace of solemnity. The Star Moon Army had five great battle teams, and the strongest one was the black fiend battle team.

The Black Fiend Battle team’s Mount, the Black Fiend Beast, was a type of extremely powerful fierce beast. The weakest one was at least at rank six extraordinary, and it was the Star Moon Army’s trump card.

This time, the Black Fiend Battle team was sent out directly. It seemed that the star Moon Kingdom paid more attention to this Dragon-phoenix kingdom that had suddenly appeared.

“Xiao Xian, sister Feng Luan seems to be in trouble!”

Guan Shuqing and the rest saw Feng Luan walking out anxiously. They frowned and said to Wang Xian.

Wang Xian revealed a contemplative look. “Ao Jian, send someone to call the Wind Eye clan over. Also, call the strange demon clan over. Let the strange demon clan hide first so that they won’t be discovered by void interpretation experts!”

He said to Ao Jian who was outside. He looked at the few girls and said, “Let’s go and take a look too!” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Alright, if we can help sister Feng Luan, then help her more. We are her only family!”

Guan Shuqing and the rest nodded and said to Wang Xian.

“Don’t worry. I will help her become the Empress Again!”

Wang Xian revealed a hint of confidence in his eyes.

“What’s going on?”

“The army of star-moon Kingdom is attacking us. These damn bastards!”

“Bastards, kill them all. They didn’t come to rescue us. In such a short period of time, so many soldiers have come!”

“Kill them all! Kill those bastards of star-moon Kingdom!”

In dragon-phoenix city, when the citizens heard that the army of star-moon kingdom was attacking them, their faces were filled with rage. One by one, the citizens walked toward the east gate with furious faces.

When Wang Xian and the group of women arrived at the East Gate, they saw an army rushing towards them from a distance of three to four kilometers away.

In the sky, five people were flying in the sky.

An old man dressed in yellow armor and holding a long spear was in the middle.

On the left and right sides, there were two middle-aged men and two old men.

Each of their eyes were like torches. Their terrifying aura was not concealed at all.

A group of five people, with thousands of troops and horses, rushed over with an aura that could ride the wind and break the waves.

When the people who came to the east gate saw this scene, their faces changed drastically.

Feng Luan did not leave the city. She stared ahead with an expressionless face.
