3810 3809 was shaken! The thirteen peak races were meeting!

“Chase after them and destroy them all!”

When the experts in the center of the Celestial Nation saw this, their eyes shone and they roared with killing intent.

Since the other party was the first to attack them, they naturally wouldn’t let the other party off.

Their bodies moved, and within the illusory palace above their heads, terrifying attacks attacked the experts from the belief universe.

“Ah Ah Ah, no no!”

“No!”

Very quickly, screams of pain rang out. The few gods from the belief universe at the back were hit by the experts from the immortal empire, and they let out screams of pain.

“Damn it, just you wait for us in the belief universe.”

The fastest middle-aged man felt that his companion had been killed, and his face was filled with killing intent as he roared.

He moved his palm and crushed an item that was emitting light. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Following that, he continued to flee forward.

“The belief universe, so it’s the belief universe. I really didn’t expect that you guys would actually step into the starry universe. However, you dare to attack us, Die!”

The Immortal Nation’s expert roared with a face full of killing intent.

On the illusory palace above his head, one after another, corporeal figures slowly appeared.

These figures were like generals from the ancient era of Earth. They wore armor and charged straight at them.

“Ahhhhh!”

Following that, a scream sounded again.

More than twenty experts who believed in the gods were killed by him!

“The one who’s going to die is you!”

Suddenly, the eyes of the fleeing expert shone.

“Ma Li Ma Li, Hong Li, Too Ma Li!”

At this moment, a voice that sounded like chanting suddenly sounded from the front.

When the powerhouses from the immortal nation heard it, their eyes focused and revealed a vigilant look.

“There are actually creatures from other universes in the starry universe. If that’s the case, then die!”

“Faith, Judgment!”

At this moment, a voice came from the front. Following that, a light enveloped them.

The ray of light slowly condensed into many special runes that covered the group of experts from the Immortal Empire.

“Don’t touch these runes. Leave, we’ll leave immediately!”

When the middle-aged expert from the Immortal Empire saw that the other party actually had reinforcements, he made a prompt decision and immediately ordered loudly, fleeing into the distance.

“Can you escape? Why Don’t you become my loyal follower?”

That calm voice sounded once again.

The strange special rune suddenly accelerated and directly entered the body of an expert from the celestial nation.

“Ah!”

The rune entered his body and drilled towards the top of his head!

He desperately wanted to resist, but his resistance was getting weaker and weaker!

“Become my loyal follower, worship me, offer your life, and live for your God. Are You Willing?”

The rune came to the top of the immortal nation’s expert’s head, and a voice washed over his mind, washing away his memories and everything else.

A terrifying brainwashing and memory washing began!

“Oh no, the belief universe has the means to control people. Run!”

The middle-aged man from the Immortal Nation, who was the strongest in the center, clearly understood some of the means of the belief universe, and shouted loudly.

He desperately fled into the distance.

“Become my believer!”

However, at this moment, a rune appeared behind him and directly surged into his body.

The experts from the immortal empire faintly saw countless people appearing around him, singing and assimilating him.

“Scram!”

He roared wildly, and his body instantly exploded.

He directly committed suicide.

In this way, he could escape the fate of being domesticated.

The reason why he dared to commit suicide was because he had the means to resurrect himself.

Once he was domesticated, he would be truly finished.

Before he died, he also understood that even he couldn’t fight against the Great Beings of the belief universe, and the rest of his companions would also die.

Or they would be domesticated and become slaves of the belief universe!

Slaves without thoughts!

After the death of the middle-aged great being, he was rapidly reborn in the immortal nation of the 9-origin universe.

The first thing he did was to spread the news to the Great Beings of the immortal nation.

There were other pinnacle races in the starry universe, and they had already clashed and engaged in a great battle.

This was not good news for the 9-origin universe.

The two universes had met before the Apocalypse was born, so it was bound to be a collision.

When the news reached the Great Beings of the immortal empire, all the Great Beings had shocked expressions on their faces.

There were actually living beings from other universes in the starry universe.

This was a serious problem.

The Great Beings of the immortal empire talked for a while and immediately passed this news to the other peak races.

The appearance of another universe was not a small matter.

This was already a matter between universes.

A war between universes was not just a matter between their immortal empire.

It was a matter of the entire nine-origin universe.

If there was a conflict with the belief universe, then this was a war between universes.

All the peak races and all living beings in the nine-origin universe were united.

Just like the arrival of the great calamity, all the universes were connected.

A universe was a force.

Of course, there were also situations where there was no unity in a universe and there were even fights.

However, at least in the past, all the living beings in the nine-origin universe were united.

When the news was spread to the other peak races, all the experts from the peak races were also shocked.

“Eh?”

At the same time, Wang Xian, who was flying in the starry universe and was about to head deeper, suddenly received news from the elf race.

Furthermore, it was news from a great elf who was at the level of a ruler at level seven.

This made him look at it with slight confusion. When he saw the contents, he was slightly stunned!

“Belief universe. The creatures that appeared in the belief universe in the starry universe are suspected to have entered the starry universe as well? What does the belief universe look like?”

Wang Xian mumbled in astonishment.

This message from the Elf tribe was an invitation to head to the passageway of their nine-origin universe for a discussion.

At that time, the thirteen peak races would participate.

It was related to the entire nine-origin universe.

Wang Xian replied immediately and immediately flew towards the world passageway.

An invitation from the Elf tribe and a new disciple of a universe master had also entered the starry universe. This was a huge matter.

Naturally, he had to go there to understand the situation.

In addition, this could be considered a meeting between the Dragon Palace and the other twelve peak races after they had established their footing!

He had no choice but to go.

As for the consolation, Wang Xian wasn’t worried.

Firstly, it was an invitation from the Elf clan. Naturally, they wouldn’t say that the powerhouses from the Angel clan and Phoenix clan would attack him.

Second, the Dragon Palace had already made peace with the Angel clan and the Phoenix clan. Now that a new disciple of a universe warrior had appeared, this was not the time for civil war.
