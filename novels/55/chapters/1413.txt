Chapter 1414: 1414 disguised as a private visitor

“Wind frost city, City Lord, get your ass over here!”

An angry shout came from Mang Hong’s mouth, and his voice instantly resounded throughout the entire wind frost city!

The group of middle-aged elders standing in front of Feng Luan were stunned. When they felt the loud and clear voice from Mang Hong’s mouth, they felt a bad premonition.

Especially when the burly man behind the veiled woman actually shouted for the city lord to get his ass out.

In wind frost city, this was a matter of treason and courting death.

If one didn’t have the strength, they definitely wouldn’t dare to be so arrogant!

“Oh?”

At this moment, in a warm room, the city lord of wind frost city who was watching a group of beautiful women dancing heard this shout and his expression changed slightly.

“Insightful Void Realm Expert?”

The eyes of the city lord of wind frost city flickered.

“Who dares to cause trouble in Wind Frost City!”

His figure moved and he directly appeared in the sky above the city Lord’s mansion. He coldly shouted.

In an instant, everyone in wind frost city was stunned by these two shouts.

The citizens of wind frost city raised their heads with stunned expressions and looked at the city lord above the city Lord’s mansion.

Everyone in Wind Frost Lake also looked at the position of the carriage with stunned expressions.

“Who... Who Are you people?”

The dozen or so people in front of the carriage stared at them with their eyes wide open.

“City Lord of wind and Frost City, come here immediately. I have something to ask you!”

Feng Luan raised her head and looked at the sky above the city Lord’s mansion as she said with a twinkle in her eyes.

Her clear and cold voice once again resounded throughout the entire wind and Frost City.

“This voice...”

When the city lord of wind frost city heard Feng Luan’s voice, his eyes widened slightly and his pupils couldn’t help but shrink.

His body trembled and he hurriedly flew over.

From Afar, when he saw Feng Luan’s figure, the old woman behind her, Mang Hong, and a few familiar figures in the surroundings, he felt his vision go black.

“Her Majesty, Her Majesty!”

His voice trembled as he hurriedly flew over and directly knelt on the ice-cold surface of the lake.

“What? Your Majesty?”

“The Dragon and Phoenix Queen? That’s our Queen?”

“My God, the Queen...”

When everyone around saw the city lord kneeling on the surface of the lake in fear and trepidation, their faces revealed shock.

It had already been a year since the snow wind dynasty was subdued by the Dragon and Phoenix dynasty.

However, this was the first time they had met Her Majesty the Queen.

Moreover, it was done in this way.

“Your Majesty the Queen, Please Spare my life! Your Majesty the Queen, Please Spare My Life!”

The dozens of middle-aged elders in front of the carriage instantly had their foreheads filled with cold sweat. They knelt on the ground and shouted in fear.

“Your Majesty the Queen!”

Everyone in the surroundings was prepared to kneel on the ground.

“You don’t have to kneel!”

Feng Luan waved her arm, causing the surrounding people to be unable to kneel down.

This method caused the surrounding people to widen their eyes and be filled with shock.

“Half a year ago, I gave an order that the children of my dragon and Phoenix dynasty can enjoy the transcendent rank one clear spirit grass for free to wash their bodies and become the foundation of an expert!”

“Why? When I came here, some of the children can’t receive it for free. Why must there be conditions?”

“The dynasty takes out trillions of middle-grade spirit stones every year just to lay a solid foundation for the children. When the youth is strong, the dynasty is strong. City Lord Feng Shuang, you are plotting against the future of the dynasty!”

Feng Luan’s face was ice-cold as she stared at the city lord of Feng Shuang City!

When city Lord Feng Shuang heard Feng Luan’s words, his face was extremely pale as he said in fear, “Your Majesty, I don’t know about this matter. It has nothing to do with me, I...”

“No matter what, you have already derelict your duty. I think you don’t need to be the city lord anymore. I will thoroughly investigate this matter. If it has something to do with you, if you have done other things that harmed the people, then you will be punished according to the laws of the dragon and Phoenix Dynasty!”

Feng Luan waved her arm, and a ring of fire flew directly toward the city lord of wind frost city.

“No, your majesty, no...”

The city lord of wind frost city’s expression changed greatly, and he shouted out in terror.

“Xiuqing, inform the prime minister to send a profound void martial artist to take over the position of the city lord of Wind Frost City!”

“Mang Hong, go investigate the matter between the spirit grass and the city lord of Wind Frost City!”

Feng Luan ordered the old woman and Mang Hong beside her.

“It’s Your Majesty!”

The two nodded respectfully.

“I am the ruler of the Dragon-phoenix dynasty, and you are the citizens of the dragon-phoenix dynasty. As citizens of the dragon-phoenix Dynasty, you will enjoy all the benefits and policies of the dragon-phoenix Dynasty!”

“As officials, you must love the people, and as citizens, you must own the country. The dynasty will ensure the safety of everyone’s lives and allow everyone to live as happily as possible!”

“I hope that the people of the dragon and Phoenix Dynasty will become stronger. The Dragon and Phoenix Dynasty has a complete promotion system, especially the young people. The future Dragon and Phoenix dynasty will belong to your era!”

Feng Luan’s gaze swept across everyone as she spoke in a deep voice.

“Thank You, Your Majesty. Our life this year is already much better than before!”

“That’s right. Be it the education of our children or the free distribution of goods, this is something that we didn’t dare to imagine in the past. Thank you, Your Majesty!”

The citizens shouted at Feng Luan excitedly.

“I am the people. Only the people can be for me. Water can carry a boat and it can also overturn it. Among you, there might be a pillar of the dragon and Phoenix dynasty in the future. Do your best!”

As Feng Luan spoke, she gestured to Wang Xian and the group of girls before flying directly towards the city Lord’s mansion.

“I didn’t expect that a queen would actually say that I serve the people. Only the people can serve me. Water can carry a boat and it can capsize a boat!”

In the lake, a teacher who was teaching students looked at the figure in the sky with a face full of respect.

“Compared to a year ago, our lives are much better. I didn’t expect that the Queen would personally come today and even imprison the city lord. This is a powerhouse at the profound void tier!” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“According to the decree that has been issued for many years, if it is fully implemented, then our lives in the future will be even better!”

“The Queen is secretly visiting us in disguise. She came to our city and directly crippled the city lord. This is a good king!”

“In the future, I want to cultivate well. I want to become an expert. I want to fight for our dynasty!”

The appearance of the Queen made everyone in wind and frost city look excited.

Especially those few words of the queen. They had the urge to die for those who were close to them.

I serve the people. Only the people can serve me!

Compared to the reign of the Snow Wind Dynasty, the current Dragon and Phoenix Queen was simply too good!

Four days later, when the new city Lord arrived, all the items that were confiscated by the previous city Lord were distributed to the people.

Four days later, Feng Luan, Wang Xian, and the rest left wind and frost city.

On the wind and Frost Lake, an ice sculpture that was 200 meters tall was erected.

The ice sculpture was a woman wearing a veil. It was lifelike and full of majesty.

This was the dean of the wind and Frost Academy. He personally carved it for the Queen of Dragons and phoenixes.

This was to express his respect and respect for the queen.

This is also one of the most important landscape of wind and frost city in the future.

It is also the first stop of the history of the Queen in private!
