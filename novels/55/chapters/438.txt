Chapter 439: The Champion Of The Younger Generation (4)

“Great! How domineering! Let me tell you this! No matter who you are and whatever reasons you have, you will die for killing the disciple of our Medical Saint Sect!”

Hua Mingshan’s exasperated voice resounded as he stood there, watching Wang Xian with a pair of murderous eyes.

Everyone was taken aback, and at the same time, they were impressed. Miracle Doctor Wang was impressive, and he had guts. But even so, the Medical Saint Sect would not let him off!

Medical Saint Sect was a dominant Sacred Sect that had a long history. Such an existence with a deep foundation was definitely daunting.

Besides, they had powerful alchemists who could cultivate experts that were beyond any imagination!

“You will die!”

Hua Mingshan glowered at Wang Xian as he spat out the words.

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows with a faint smile on his face.

Behind him, Mo Qinglong and Mo Yuan exhibited a frosty look as they came forward, fixing their deadly eyes on the old man and the middle-aged man beside Hua Mingshan.

“In this case, we shall see!”

Wang Xian grinned at Hua Mingshan.

Boom!

Mo Qinglong and Mo Yuan released their aura instantly as they locked their domineering vibe on the old man and the middle-aged man.

“Brother, let me protect you. Hehe, I’ll handle this fellow!” said Xiao Yu to Wang Xian with a smile. A tinge of coldness flashed in her eyes when she noticed Hua Mingshan staring at Wang Xian with killing intent.

At present, she already possessed a strong power, which allowed her to resolve some matters for her elder brother.

She was no longer the younger sister who needed protection from her brother.

As Xiao Yu spoke, she stepped forward with the bone sword in her hand, giving off a faint demonic aura. She fixed her deadly eyes on Hua Mingshan.

The crowd froze as everyone was shocked.

They struck! The few people beside Miracle Doctor Wang struck instantly.

“Damm, what is this going on? Are they trying to exterminate the people from Medical Saint Sect?”

“They...They are going to fight! It’s an obvious life-or-death battle!”

“Impressive. Hua Mingshan has been rattling away for such a long time without making any moves. As a result, Miracle Doctor Wang of Rivertown is going to strike!”

“They’re completely in the bad books of Medical Saint Sect!”

When the crowd saw Xiao Yu, Mo Qinglong, and Mo Yuan, they were appalled!

“Sure!”

Wang Xian nodded in reply to Xiao Yu as he looked at Hua Mingshan with a sneer on his face.

Since they are enemies, just kill them off. What’s the point of talking so much!

“Fine!”

Hua Mingshan had mixed expression as he clenched his fist while glaring at Wang Xian. He swept his gaze slowly towards Xiao Yu. “Today, we’ll slaughter all of you!”

Initially, he had wanted to kill Miracle Doctor Wang off at the Outstanding Young Heroes Competition. But he did not expect the other party to be so arrogant.

“You talk too much!”

Xiao Yu scoffed as she moved, lunging at Hua Mingshan.

Hmph!

Mo Qinglong and Mo Yuan scorned and made a swift movement towards the old man and the middle-aged man beside Hua Mingshan.

The domineering vibe struck fear into everyone around them, who quickly receded.

“Who’s that young lady? She looks so young. How did she explode such daunting power?”

“That’s Miracle Doctor Wang’s younger sister. It’s a surprise that she has also advanced to the Inborn Realm!”

“Another demon-like talent. Damn, why are there so many young Inborns now!”

Everyone was appalled by the vibe exhibited by Xiao Yu. All of them staggered back.

Upon seeing Xiao Yu assaulting him, Hua Mingshan revealed a bloodthirsty and malevolent look. He swung his arm and stuck the emerald twig on the floor.

Ka Ka Ka!

With a single move of his arm, the twig penetrated the hard and durable ground, rooted, and multiplied.

Soon, a two-meter weird tree grew up, bearing twigs with sharp thorns that looked extremely prickly.

“This is the combat style of Hua Family, Medical Saint Sect. The Art of Cultivation they practiced is of wood attributes. If they were in the woods, their strength would be more powerful!”

“This kind of cultivation has a weak combat power at the preliminary stage. But when they advance to the Inborn Realm, they are able to control the plants around them, which makes them a difficult opponent.”

“This twig must come from a Spiritual Tree that can be used for controlling combat.”

The crowd erupted into discussions when they witnessed Hua Mingshan’s way of attacking.

While not many people had seen how the Hua Family struck, they had mostly heard about it.

Even the people from other Saint-class forces were curious to find out. After all, Medical Saint Sect was considered a semi-secluded Sacred Sect, which was rarely involved in any combat.

“I’ll slaughter you first, then the other fellow who is tired of living!”

Hua Mingshan stood before the Spiritual Tree as he glared at Xiao Yu with an icy face. With a swing, he injected green energy into the Spiritual Tree.

He raised his arm and brought it down, sending twigs with sharp thorns towards Xiao Yu.

“Hur?”

Xiao Yu hesitated when she saw the twigs attack. She wielded her bone sword at it straight away.

“Oh, ignorance!”

Upon seeing her move, Hua Mingshan’s eyes were filled with contempt.

How could any weapon counter the Spiritual Scale Tree? Not only could weapons not counter the twigs, but the twig could also wrap itself around weapons.

Hua Mingshan raised his arm, bringing about dozens of sharp twigs dancing in the air. They darted out towards Xiao Yu, just like flexible snakes.

Hmph!

Xiao Yu snorted as the bone sword gave off black radiance with an edge, slashing all the twigs.

Bang, bang, bang!

“What? How is this possible?”

When the bone sword and the twigs collided, the twigs of Spiritual Scale Tree broke off easily.

Disbelief filled Hua Mingshan’s face as he was astounded.

“Hmph, it only has the looks!”

Upon seeing the frail twigs, Xiao Yu was full of disdain. Moving in a quick stance, she lunged with her sword at Hua Mingshan.

“No, it can’t be. This is impossible!”

Hua Mingshan could not believe this. The stem of Spiritual Scale Tree stretched forward from behind as the two-meter sharp thorn extended towards Xiao Yu.

“Counter, Point, Slay!”

Xiao Yu maintained a consistent look while shaking an afterimage out from the bone sword.

Bang, bang, bang!

All the twigs from Spiritual Scale Tree broke off easily and fell to the ground. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“This... this Hua Mingshan is so weak!”

“Thrashing! That’s so weak. I don’t feel that he’s as strong as a Half-step to Inborn!”

“Yes, I agree. Medical Saint Sect is well-known for their medical skills and Art of Refining. For their combat skills, eh... They feel so weak!”

“He’s inadequate, and yet, he actually declared that he wants to kill other people. Isn’t this digging his own grave?”

Everyone was stunned and slightly at a loss of words when they witnessed how easily Xiao Yu defeated Hua Mingshan.

From what they saw, the battle between Xiao Yu and Hua Mingshan was simple.

Her sword cut the twigs easily, and it was a done deal. This Hua Mingshan was a noob!

Argh!

At this time, there were two devastating cries from the side. The old man and middle-aged man from Medical Saint Sect had fallen to the ground with eyes full of desperation!
