Chapter 1379: 1379 was a destitute race

The entire weapon region was filled with a sharp aura.

Duan Jinming brought Wang Xian along as they continued to walk inside. They took a carriage in the middle and arrived at the last position.

It was the place where the 10,000-meter-tall mountain peak was located.

Beside it was the gigantic waterfall. The water from the waterfall was flowing downwards.

“Clang, Clang, Clang!”

After passing through a man-made corridor, Duan Jinming brought him to the side of the waterfall.

The continuous sounds of forging could be heard.

Wang Xian looked inside and realized that it was actually a weapons forging factory.

Burly young men, middle-aged men, and even old men who were emitting flames were forging weapons on the weapon forging platforms.

Beside them, there were also some women who were handling the weapons one by one.

There were more than two thousand people in the entire site.

Behind their forging site, there were houses. The houses looked a little simple and crude!

“This...”

When Wang Xian’s gaze swept across each and every one of them, a stunned expression appeared on his face.

They were not considered humans. They belonged to the humanoid demonic beast race because they had four arms.

What surprised Wang Xian even more was that their strength was generally at level five or six. The strongest of them was an elder who was at level eight!

Fire Hammer clan: they had the rare bloodline of the fire gold dragon species!

“So not everyone is as bright as a broken metal. He should have a bloodline returning to his ancestors. The rest of the Fire Hammer clan only have a bloodline!”

Wang Xian looked at the four-armed fire hammer clan and a thoughtful look appeared on his face.

He looked at the weapons forged by the fire hammer clan and was slightly surprised.

As expected of the fire gold dragon species that possessed the best weapon forging talent in the universe. Even if it was just some of its bloodline, it was still extremely powerful.

However, its strength was really too weak!

The strongest one was only at level eight extraordinary. This should belong to the top of the bloodline.

“Jin Ming, the matter has been settled. Quick, quick, there are more weapons that need to be forged in the next few days!”

At this moment, the elder who was at extraordinary level eight in the middle wiped the sweat off his forehead and spoke to Duan Jinming.

“Yes, Chief!”

Duan Jinming replied hurriedly. He looked at Wang Xian and said, “If there’s nothing else, you can go back!”

After he finished speaking, he ran straight towards the elder.

“Jin Ming, who is that human?”

“I met him on the way here. I wanted to take a look. I saw that he didn’t have any ill intentions, so I brought him here. Hehe!”

The voices of Duan Jin Ming and the old man could be heard from the front.

“A race with the bloodline of the fire-gold dragon is a little down and out!”

Wang Xian’s eyes were sparkling as he looked at this race of more than two thousand people.

“Clang! Clang! Clang!”

At this moment, Wang Xian suddenly looked at Duan Jin Ming. He saw that he, who originally only had two arms, had grown four more arms.

When he forged the weapon, it emitted a golden-red glow.

“According to the breeding method of a peak-level dragon seed, after the fire hammer clan cultivates the fire god Dragon transformation and integrates with the metal heart, they will be able to become a fire-gold dragon seed!”

“Even if they can’t become a fire-gold dragon seed now, the Fire Hammer clan is still considered a top-level dragon seed. We must subdue them!”

Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled.

“Miss, master has already told you not to come here!”

“I’m here to see if my weapon is ready. Xiao Yan, shut up!”

At this moment, two female voices were heard. Wang Xian looked over curiously.

“Eh? Who Is This?” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

One of the pretty voices looked at Wang Xian with a hint of surprise on her face. “Wow, Miss, this person is so handsome. He has such a temperament!”

“Alright, Pervert!”

Beside the pretty girl with two braids, a dignified-looking woman glanced at Wang Xian and walked straight to Duan Jinming’s position.

“Jin Ming, the third miss is Here!”

“Xiao Ming, the third miss is Here!”

At the smithy, some members of the Fire Hammer clan looked at the woman and called out to Duan Jinming in a low voice.

Some old men looked over and frowned. They shook their heads helplessly.

“The third miss is here. Pay attention to your status!”

Seeing the woman coming over, the clan leader of the Fire Hammer clan reminded Duan Jinming lightly.

“Okay!”

Hearing the old man’s words, Duan Jinming smiled bitterly. He looked at the woman with a hint of admiration in his eyes.

“Jinming, have you finished the hairpin I asked you to make?”

The dignified woman stared at Duan Jinming with a smile and a hint of emotion in her eyes!

“Okay, third miss, I’ll take it for You Now!”

Duan Jinming said hurriedly and ran into the room at the side.

The dignified woman looked at his figure with a smile on her face.

“Third miss, here you are, the hairpin you want!”

Duan Jinming quickly ran out with an exquisite hairpin wrapped in cloth. He didn’t dare to look at the woman’s eyes. He ran over with a twinkle in his eyes and reached out to pass it to her.

“It’s so beautiful. Thank you, Jinming. I’ll take good care of it!”

The dignified woman shyly hugged him in her arms and said happily.

Around her, some of the middle-aged elders of the fire hammer clan slowly shook their heads.

“Third sister, you let this lowly bastard forge an item for You Again!”

At this moment, a mocking and disdainful voice suddenly sounded from the front.

The faces of all the members of the Fire Hammer clan changed slightly.

The dignified woman’s face slowly turned ugly as she looked forward.

The entire forging factory was divided into two areas.

About five to six hundred meters in front of this open-air area, there were also exquisite forging workshops. The two were obviously not on the same level.

Obviously, that place was used to refine more advanced weapons.

Two women and a young man walked over. Beside them were a few middle-aged men.

“Big Sister, you... Don’t tell Father!”

The dignified woman slightly lowered her head and said in a low voice.

“Humph, I don’t have the mood to complain. But you must remember your identity. Don’t disgrace our Gilded Gold Family!”

One of the women snorted and looked at Duan Jinming with disdain.

“Third sister, don’t end things with such a lowly guy in the future. Pay attention to your identity. I want to tell mother about this!”

The young man next to him coldly berated the dignified woman.

“Second brother, don’t...”

The dignified woman’s face slightly changed and she hurriedly said.

“Come back with us!”

The young man said coldly as his gaze swept towards Duan Jinming and the members of the Fire Hammer clan. “You Bunch of lowly fellows, you must know your status and status. Don’t be like a toad trying to eat swan meat!”

“You must think about who gave you a chance to survive. If you don’t know what’s good for you, Don’t blame me for being impolite. Hurry up and work!”

As he spoke coldly, he glared at the dignified lady and the group walked out.

The dignified lady followed behind with slightly red eyes and walked out.

Wang Xian stood at the side and looked at the group of young men who had left. He raised his eyebrows.

“A lowly race?”
