Even though they did not manage to enter the inner core of the huge mountain, the rewards were beyond their expectations!

There were five to six Abyss races in the caves of the huge mountain. There were more than 20 level 7 immortal king Abyss species!

Wang Xian and the rest swiftly hunted down the races one by one in the huge mountain. When they destroyed the third race, it was a pity that the rest of the abyss species had already escaped!

“Dragon King, we have harvested a total of 15 level seven immortal king abyssal seeds, 40 level six immortal king abyssal seeds, and more than 1,000 abyssal seeds of varying strength!”

In the huge mountain, Wang Xian and the rest cleared the abyssal seeds. Ao crab and the rest came over to report with smiles on their faces!

“The harvest this time is really huge!”

Wang Xian’s eyes were also filled with excitement. With these abyssal seeds, the strength of the Dragon Palace could be improved qualitatively!

“Let’s go back!”

He smiled and said to the members of the Dragon Palace!

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Everyone immediately flew towards the entrance of the abyss. From the moment they entered to the moment they exited, they had only stayed here for five to six days!

During these five to six days, their harvest was extremely terrifying!

This was mainly due to Wang Xian and the rest’s good luck in encountering such a unique nest of abyssal seeds!

Just as Wang Xian was flying towards the abyss, in the domain of the ninth-grade heaven sect, an incomparably huge army was suspended in a secret void!

In the middle of the entire army was an incomparably huge star-piercing sword. On both sides of the star-piercing sword, there were ten incomparably huge war pets!

Each war pet was about five to six thousand meters in size. When they spread their wings, they could reach more than 10,000 meters!

Star Vulture, a group of undying god King Level 4 war pets that roamed the starry skies, each of them exuded a powerful savage aura, their sharp eyes staring coldly ahead!

On star Vulture’s body stood tens of thousands of warriors, their hands holding bows and arrows as they stood there coldly!

This was the Ninth Grade Heaven sect ninth grade army, also known as the Sky Hunting Arrow Army!

With the sky hunting arrow in their hands, the entire army attacked together, easily piercing through a star!

At the back, there were many warriors standing on sharp swords, their clothes fluttering even though there was no wind, every one of them was like a lifeless divine sword!

Sky Mountain Sword Sect’s divine sword battle team!

As for the back, the disciples of the six powers!

At the center of the Star Piercing Sword stood a group of Undying Godly King warriors, 2,000 of them standing in the sky coldly!

“Spread out and set out for the Dragon Star!”

The leader of the Ninth Grade Sky sect roared with killing intent!

This time, the six powers had sent out almost all of their experts, the Sky Mountain Sword sect and the ninth grade sky sect, and the nine level 7 undying godly monarchs were all sent out!

Their army could sweep through any power in the southern star system!

“Kill, Kill, Kill!”

All the disciples immediately roared. Their killing intent shot into the starry sky for billions of Miles, and the entire void seemed to have frozen!

“In two days, the dragon star will gather and seal off all information to prevent them from escaping!”

The Sword King said coldly!

“Yes!”

All the experts and disciples immediately responded. The entire army immediately spread out and flew into the void!

They couldn’t attack the Dragon Star openly! Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

If all the people of the Dragon Palace escaped, they wouldn’t be able to reach the Dragon Star!

Therefore, all the disciples could reach the void around the dragon star in two days!

They wanted to seal the entire void and make it impossible for anyone on the Dragon Star to escape!

The six forces had moved out, but there was no news about the six forces on the AI!

Occasionally, someone would announce that the armies of the six major forces had started to gather. It was suspected that they were preparing to attack the Dragon Star recently!

However, what they didn’t know was that the armies of the six major forces had already spread out and were flying towards the starry sky of the Dragon Star!

This time, the six major forces wanted to destroy everyone in the Dragon Palace completely!

Otherwise, with their usual style, they would just gather their armies and fly over with great fanfare!

Their might would shake the entire star Southern Galaxy!

“Phew!”

“They’re out!”

A day later, Wang Xian came out of the Abyss with a smile on his face. A smile appeared on his face!

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz

However, when he just came out, information was sent to him crazily from the AI!

Information from a group of girls, information from the Imperial Star Lady, and information from Prime Minister Gui!

When he opened the information one by one, he raised his eyebrows slightly!

“The Tianshan Sword sect and the ninth-grade heaven sect have joined hands. Furthermore, they have destroyed all the planets in the chaotic tiger demon country and one of the planets in the Iron Blood Alliance!”

Looking at the messages, his eyes flashed with a cold glint!

...

“Let’s go back immediately!”

Wang Xian said to Ao Qitian and the rest before he disappeared slowly!

Buzz

In an instant, he returned to the Dragon King’s Hall of the Dragon Palace!

“Call Prime Minister GUI over!”

Upon returning to the Dragon Palace, Wang Xian sensed that Prime Minister Gui was not here. He immediately instructed Ao nv beside him!

“Dragon King, you are finally back. I will inform Prime Minister Gui!”

When Ao nv saw that Wang Xian had returned, her face was filled with joy!

“Little Xian!”

At this moment, a group of girls sensed his arrival and immediately flew towards the Dragon King’s Hall. They shouted in surprise!

“Wow, Wang Xian, you’ve only just returned. Do you know what’s Happening Now?”

...

Lady di Xing looked at Wang Xian and said unhappily!

“It’s nothing!”

Wang Xian smiled faintly and shook his head!

“Greetings, Dragon King!”

At this moment, Prime Minister Gui received the message and rushed over from the Dragon Palace on Dragon Star. He bowed to Wang Xian!

“Tell me about the situation!”

Wang Xian asked Prime Minister Gui!

“Dragon King, not long after you left, the Sky Mountain Sword sect said that you killed a group of their experts and wanted to destroy us!”

“Following that, they joined forces with the five forces of the ninth-grade sky sect and sent people to destroy all the planets in the chaotic tiger demon country. They even sent people to destroy the planets and bases where our Dragon Palace is located!”

“I sent all the strange demons to the planets where the ninth-grade heaven sect and the Tianshan Sword sect are located to take revenge. About a thousand strange demons died!”

“There is still no news from the six forces. I guess they are preparing to attack!”

Prime Minister GUI reported immediately!

“Okay!”

As Wang Xian listened, a hint of killing intent flashed in his eyes!

He wasn’t being arrogant when he killed the people from the Tianshan Sword sect. In his opinion, the Tianshan Sword sect needed some preparation to deal with the Dragon Palace. Besides, the dragon star could withstand the opponent’s attack!

The Dragon Palace could also withstand their attacks. Therefore, he didn’t put the Sky Mountain Sword sect in his eyes!

However, what he didn’t expect was that the other party had destroyed their planets and even went to the Sky Lake Continent to destroy the planets!

“Call the leaders of the Dragon Palace over!”

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered as he spoke to Prime Minister Gui!

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Prime Minister Gui nodded his head!

“Reporting to the Dragon King, there are many powerful legions approaching us from the surroundings of Dragon Star!”

At this moment, an anxious voice was heard!
