Chapter 55: Dragon Ball

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

“I heard you just punched a few ignorant lads who offended your companion out of anger.”

Wang Xian and Guan Shuqing were sitting at a table in the room, chatting when Old Xue and Old Qin walked in. Following behind them were Xue Jiahua, the son of Old Qin and Little Kite.

Old Xue spoke with a smile as he swept his glance across Guan Shuqing.

“Hehe, those few guys were too braggy. They said they were from the Gong, Song, Bi Family, and they even threatened me. I can’t hold my fists,” Wang Xian said with a smile.

“Those affluent younger generations... It’s good for you to teach them a lesson on behalf of their families,” Old Xue said with no importance.

“Yes, I didn’t manage to hold back in time.” Wang Xian chuckled.

“So good to be young!” Old Qin said with a little envy.

“Haha, come, take a seat.” Old Xue laughed, “Wang Xian, aren’t you going to introduce your confidante?”

Wang Xian smiled and looked at Guan Shuqing, “This is my classmate, Guan Shuqing,”

Then he turned to Guan Shuqing and continued, “This is Old Qin and Old Xue!”

“Hello, Old Qin and Old Xue!” Guan Shuqing hurriedly greeted them as she was slightly taken aback by surprise when she saw Wang Xian having conversations with two extraordinary elders.

“Well, well... she’s quite pretty.” Old Qin smiled.

“Guan Shuqing? Do you know Guan Shicheng?” the middle-aged man who was carrying Little Kite asked suddenly.

“He’s my father. Do you know him?” Guan Shuqing looked puzzled at the middle-aged man.

“I heard about him.” The middle-aged man smiled.

“Oh?” Old Qin looked at his son with question marks on his face.

“Dad, we’ll talk about it after dinner!” the middle-aged man smiled and said.

“Alright.” Old Qin did not probe into it and continued his chat with Wang Xian and Old Xue.

The lunch took over an hour. Wang Xian and Guan Shuqing left the place after making a promise to attend the dinner event that night.

“Dad.” Gazing at the back view of Guan Shuqing, the middle-aged man slightly frowned and continued, “Guan Shuqing’s father went bankrupt.”

“What exactly is going on?” asked Old Qin with his eyebrows slightly raised.

“Guan Shicheng was in the medical equipment business. This year, his vendor encountered some problems and landed him in hot soup. Eventually, he went bankrupt because of this. Her father came to me for help some time ago, but I turned him down,” said the middle-aged man.

“Oh, really?” Old Qin pondered. “Invite Guan Shicheng to the dinner tonight.”

“Yes, father.” The middle-aged man nodded as he understood his father’s intention.

Guan Shicheng really has a good daughter.

The middle-aged man pondered to himself.

“Tonight, three of us are going to disturb Old Qin.” Old Xue was wearing smiles on his face.

He had a small family with only three of them practicing martial arts. During the early days, it was Xue Liangren who supported the family.

Luckily, his son and his grandson did not disappoint him. They had great talents in martial arts. Hence, they could make a name in the Rivertown.

A while ago, some of the people were ready for some trouble when he was injured. This time, he was going to announce the return of Xue Family along with his son and grandson. They were still the old Xue Family and could only be stronger than ever.

“Where are we going? Should we stay here?”

After coming out of the room, Wang Xian looked and asked Guan Shuqing, who was next to him

“No.” Guan Shuqing shook her head and gazed at him.

Wang Xian beamed and looked at Guan Shuqing. When they exchanged gazes, Guan Shuqing turned her head away.

“Xiao Xian, will they be okay after you beat them up?”

“Don’t worry. Didn’t you meet Old Xue just now? It’s his property here. Those Bi and Gong Family, and Wu’s Group didn’t even dare to provoke them. Besides, the one who broke the arm of that young man was Old Xue’s grandson,” Wang Xian said confidently. “You can’t underestimate me. I also know one or two formidable people. But, I’m not afraid of them even if I’m alone.”

Guan Shuqing was stunned as she looked blankly at Wang Xian. He had brought too much surprise to her such that she was getting mystified by him.

But soon, Guan Shuqing smiled and said, “Yesterday’s agreement is still valid.”

Wang Xian drew his lips slightly and looked at Guan Shuqing, “You said it.”

“Uh-huh, I said it.”

“Heh, then you will have to prepare yourself for it!”

Wang Xian was on cloud nine as he fixed his gaze on the girl before him quietly.

She was almost 1.7 meters tall, with long hair down to her shoulders. Her center parting hairstyle was only suitable for a Goddess like her.

The simplistic and monochrome dressing made her look cool and fit her innocent and good figure.

Sensing Wang Xian staring at her, Guan Shuqing chuckled and spun her body around, “Let’s go back to the restaurant. I need to work so that I’m not taking the salary for granted.”

“Sure, the boss will send you over.”

Wang Xian laughed cheekily. They came to the entrance, and Wang Xian drove her back to the First-grade Restaurant.

Guan Shuqing hugged Wang Xian at his waist as she sat on the backseat. With a smiling face, she sniffed the fragrance from his body and leaned gently on his back.

“Boss!”

Manager Huang greeted them as soon as he saw Wang Xian and Guan Shuqing walking into the restaurant.

Wang Xian nodded and returned to his office with Guan Shuqing.

Manager Huang was sensible to walk out of the office.

“I will continue with my data.” Guan Shuqing sat down and continued to analyze her data after finishing her sentence.

Wang Xian nodded and returned to his seat. He fished out a ball of flesh that was about a thumb size from his pocket.

It was the crystal-clear, red, glossy flesh, which had been growing in Little Kite’s kidney.

Glazed Inferno Crystal: Level Six

Extractable Dragon Energy: 48,338

Superpower: Glazed Inferno

Wang Xian toyed the Glazed Inferno Crystal in his palm as he was deep in his thoughts.

The Glazed Inferno Crystal was growing in the Little Kite’s body. Once the heat broke out in his body, it would burn him. As time went by, the blazing temperature would get higher and eventually burnt Little Kite to death.

In order to suppress the Glazed Inferno, the Qin Family had been looking for Martial Artists to suppress it with their Internal Energy.

However, Old Qin was unaware that, while Internal Energy might have suppressed the Glazed Inferno, it also provided nourishment to the fire and catalyzed its evolution.

Hence, Old Qin looked for a Level-two Martial Artist to suppress it in the beginning. Subsequently, he noticed that the Internal Energy of Level-two Martial Artist was insufficient. Then he continued to Level three, four, five and six. Lastly, he found Old Xue, who was a Level-seven Martial Artist today.

This Glazed Inferno Crystal was upgraded to Level Six through those Internal Energy from the Martial Artists.

Once the Qin Family was unable to find a more advanced Martial Artist to suppress it. Little Kite would turn to ash immediately when the next relapse happened.

Luckily, they met him.

“I can increase over 40,000 points of Dragon Energy, but it would be more practical if I can refine it into a Dragon Ball.”

Wang Xian did not devour it immediately because he wanted to build a weapon.

Basically, Divine Dragons did not have to use weapons, as their physical bodies were the most formidable weapon of all.

However, there was a refining technique of Divine Dragon Weapons in the Divine Dragon Transformation for Dragon Ball.
