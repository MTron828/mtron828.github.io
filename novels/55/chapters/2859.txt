2860 2860 starry sky, Dragon Emperor 1

A green gourd floated above Hong Feng Yan.

The green gourd was almost solid, the engravings on it were clear, containing the Great Dao.

In front of them, the three barrens looked at the green gourd above Hong Feng Yan, their expressions didn’t change at all.

At the same time, the Undying Pinnacle Warriors, in a 3 vs 1 situation, they didn’t care about Hong Feng Yan at all.

Weng

!!

At this time, the gourd aimed at the three guardians, opening the gourd.

In the next moment, three sharp blades shot out at a terrifying speed.

This speed was 10 times faster than the flying speed of the three elders.

“What!”

When the three elders saw the three blades coming towards them, their expressions changed.

They hurriedly raised their weapons.

However, when they raised their weapons, their expressions froze.

The three sharp swords had already pierced through their arms.

The expressions of the three guardians froze, and their eyes were filled with shock.

In front of them, Hong Fengyan saw this scene and smiled faintly.

“What? !”

“How is this possible? One versus three, instantly injuring the three guardians of the eight desolate region. From the looks of it, it was done on purpose by that guardian of the sacred region. If he struck a vital point, the three guardians of the eight desolate region would be severely injured!”

“Hiss, the strength of this guardian of the sacred region is so terrifying. Isn’t she a peak-stage king God realm expert?”

The surrounding experts of the eight desolate region, as well as the surrounding experts, watched this scene with shocked expressions.

“Weng!”

At this moment, in the sky above Hong Fengyan, the cyan-colored calabash flickered with a cyan-colored luster as waves of divine charm surrounded it.

It served as a foil to Hong Fengyan’s magnificent appearance.

“You, you, you…”

“You have half a foot in the divine emperor realm!”

After a few seconds, the horsetail whisk in his hand spat out a few words.

Half a foot into the god Emperor Realm!

This meant that he had already comprehended the god Emperor technique, the only thing lacking was the improvement of his undying God country.

Raising his undying God country to the void God country.

This was also a threshold, this improvement required a large amount of treasures.

For ordinary experts, they needed to find treasures to build their own divine kingdom.

However, for a saint realm expert, once a protector reached such a realm, the Saint Realm would open the treasury and use the saint realm’s might to build a void divine kingdom for him.

This would only take a very short time.

In other words, Hong Fengyan had already half a foot in the divine emperor realm. The other half was very easy to reach.

With half a foot in the divine emperor realm, her strength was far from what a peak divine king could compare to.

“I’ll take her away. In the future, if you want to find her, you can come find me, Hong Fengyan!”

Hong Fengyan looked at them and said indifferently.

“Our Master is about to advance to the Divine Emperor Realm!”

“Great, Great, Great!”

Behind Hong Fengyan, the Ye siblings saw this scene and revealed extremely excited expressions.

When their master advanced to the Celestial Thearch, their status would also rise.

After all, there were dozens of protectors in the holy region, but there were only a few celestial thearch.

As the disciple of the celestial thearch, who would dare to provoke him in the Holy Region?

“Awesome, brother Wang Xian, you actually have such a powerful thigh, hahaha!”

Invincible in battle techniques also revealed an excited look in his eyes when he saw Hong Fengyan displaying her prowess. He laughed loudly at Wang Xian.

Wang Xian stood at the side and smiled faintly.

It seemed that her comprehension ability was not bad. She had taken such a step so quickly.

“Cough Cough!”

The three guardians of the eight desolates and the group of strong disciples looked extremely embarrassed.

They could not keep a quasi-celestial thearch at all.

Once he really stepped into the celestial thearch realm in the future, the eight desolates would have to see if it was worth it to make trouble for him.

This was especially so when he returned to the holy region. It was such a long distance. At most, the holy region would compensate them with some treasures and leave it at that.

“Let’s Go!”

Hong Fengyan swept her gaze across them and turned to Wang Xian and the rest.

A surge of energy enveloped all of them and flew out of the windless forest.

“Bring away the enemy who killed our disciples. You are our enemy. Think carefully about the price you will have to pay!”

The three guardians of the eight desolates and the rest of the strong disciples looked embarrassed as they growled in a low voice!

All they could do was to watch and make some harmless threats.

They couldn’t defeat them even if they were to fight!

Hong Fengyan ignored them. As long as they left, this matter would be easy to handle. The strong ones of the eight desolates understood and so did she.

Boom

Before Hong Fengyan led Wang Xian and the rest out of the area, a terrifying aura came towards them.

It was a vast aura. A green figure and an old man with a dignified expression swept his gaze across the surroundings.

When he saw the figure flying out from the depths of the windless forest valley, he immediately chased after him.

Unfortunately, he was attacked by the trees in the windless forest, which greatly reduced his speed.

It was only now that he arrived. However, after such a long time, he had already lost his target.

This caused his expression to become extremely ugly.

“Lord Feng, stop them! Stop Them!”

The sudden appearance of a god emperor caused the eyes of the eight desolates’three protectors to light up. Immediately, they shouted loudly.

This vast figure was their eight desolates’God Emperor. It was simply too coincidental!

“Oh no! Beautiful sister, run! It’s the eight desolates’God Emperor!”

When invincible battle technique saw that figure, his brows twitched violently as he shouted loudly. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Eh?”

Hong Fengyan’s expression changed drastically as well. The gourd above her head dispersed and a terrifying energy covered her entire body. She was prepared to fly at full speed!

“Eh?”

The eight Desolation Celestial Emperor, who was being called for help, was slightly stunned when he heard the voice that came from below. He immediately swept his gaze toward Wang Xian and the rest.

The next moment, his eyes emitted a glow as he stared fixedly at Wang Xian.

This figure was the figure that flew out from the depths of the windless forest valley.

This time, there wasn’t a single wind jade in the windless forest valley. There was something strange about it. Perhaps the secret was with this person.

“Boom!”

At the next moment, he didn’t hesitate at all as a wind wall blocked his surroundings.

As a veteran divine emperor, he only cast the wind wall for an instant.

“Hong!”

Hong Fengyan’s expression changed drastically when she saw this scene. The wind attribute laws condensed into a wind drill and attacked the wind wall.

“Ka Ka!”

In an instant, a hole appeared in the wind wall.

“Oh?”

The eight desolate god Emperor’s expression changed slightly when he saw that his defense had been broken through.

“Heaven and Earth Wind Prison!”

He let out an embarrassed growl as the wind in the world changed drastically. A cage appeared and sealed off an area of more than a thousand kilometers around them.

Seeing this scene, Hong Fengyan’s pupils constricted slightly, and her face slowly turned ugly.

“Lord Feng, one of them killed our disciples from the eight Barrens!”

Seeing that the wind prison had sealed them off, the three guardians from the eight barrens looked excited and immediately shouted loudly.
