2594 Inside the 2594 mountain peak

“It’s the Dragon King!”

In the Abyss, in front of the mountain peak, Ao Qitian, Ao Qi, and the rest took out their dragon blood and placed it in the void in front of them!

After Wang Xian had set up the concealment formation, AO Qitian and the rest immediately went into hiding!

“This time, even if there are five or six of them, or even six or seven of them, we can still leave them here!”

Wang Xian mumbled. Last time, when they encountered four level seven immortal King Abyss seeds, they wanted to escape!

This time, unless there were seven or eight of them, they could kill them quickly!

“Roar!”

“Ga Ga Ga!”

In less than ten minutes, roars were heard. Wang Xian squinted his eyes slightly and stared at the location of the huge mountain!

“One, two, three level seven immortal king level abyssal seeds. I killed them instantly!”

Wang Xian stared at the abyssal seeds that were flying towards him. His eyes were sparkling!

There were three level 7 abyssal seeds. There were ten of them on Wang Xian’s side. Among them, there was a dragon-stinger, Ao Yao, and another one whose combat strength had increased to level 7!

Killing three of them in an instant was not a big problem!

“We’re Here!”

The speed of the abyssal seeds was very fast. In an instant, they were within the attack range of Wang Xian and the rest!

“COO COO!”

At this moment, among the three immortal King Level 7 abyssal seeds at the front, an abyssal seed with huge spectacles suddenly stopped. Its huge eyes were scanning the position of Wang Xian and the rest warily!

It let out a low roar!

“Attack!”

Wang Xian did not hesitate and ordered immediately!

“Boom Boom Boom!”

In the next moment, a terrifying attack enveloped all the abyssal seeds!

Thousands of abyssal seeds and three level 7 immortal king abyssal seeds were instantly covered!

“Coo Coo Coo!”

“Roar Roar Roar!”

The three level 7 immortal king abyssal seeds let out a series of terrified roars. Sensing Wang Xian and the rest, they turned around and wanted to escape!

“Sou Sou Sou!”

In the next moment, Ao Yao and a strange demon appeared beside an undying godly monarch level 7 abyss seed and attacked it!

That abyss seed had terrifying hair. Instantly, its hair stood on end as it attacked ao Yao!

“Pu!”

When he was defending against Ao Yao’s attack, at the back, another dragon pierced through his body!

The two of them froze!

“PFFT!”

In front, ao Yao broke through the defense and similarly, the light and dark powers entered his body!

“Alright!”

Wang Xian laughed out loud when he saw Ao Yao and the rest killing one in an instant!

On their side, the four of them surrounded and attacked an abyssal seed of the same level and completely trapped it!

“Ao Yao, come over here and kill it as soon as possible!”

Wang Xian shouted!

To kill it quickly, they still had to look at the thorned dragon seed!

With the help of Wang Xian and the rest, Ao Yao and the rest could almost kill it in one hit!

“Pu Pu!”

Two Immortal King Level 7 abyss seeds were easily killed within 20 seconds!

As for the rest of the abyss seeds, they were all easily killed!

“Dragon King, there are 13 level 6 abyss seeds, the harvest is not bad!”

Ao he and the rest kept the corpses and said with a smile!

“Very good, change positions, continue!”

Wang Xian smiled. Just these corpses alone could increase the combat strength of the Dragon Palace’s Level 7 undying god King members!

Sou

Everyone moved and immediately flew in another direction!

“Continue!”

After setting up the formation, the dragon blood was placed to the side!

Then, they waited quietly!

...

This time, more than ten minutes later, two level 7 immortal king level abyssal seeds flew over!

Wang Xian smiled and easily killed them!

Within a short period of time, the five level 7 immortal king level abyssal seeds’corpses were harvested!

“Continue!”

However, their luck was not so good after this!

After changing to another place, the dragon blood did not attract the abyssal seeds to continue coming. This caused him to frown slightly!

“What’s going on? Could it be that all the abyssal seeds in this huge mountain have been attracted out? Is there nothing left?”

“It shouldn’t be!”

He looked at the incomparably huge abyssal mountain in front of him and raised his eyebrows slightly!

The entire huge mountain was comparable to a huge planet. Wang Xian had killed about ten thousand abyssal seeds. According to his speculation, there shouldn’t be so few of them!

“Should we go in and check it out?”

...

Wang Xian hesitated for a moment and looked at Ao Yaoyao, Ao Qitian, and the rest!

“Let’s go. Let’s get close to this mountain peak. Be careful and pay attention to the surroundings!”

Wang Xian said!

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Ao Yaoyao and the rest nodded their heads!

Buzz

Wang Xian and the rest concealed themselves and approached the mountain peak carefully!

The closer they got, the more they could feel the towering and majestic mountain. They felt extremely tiny in front of it!

“Yin-yang five Elemental Dragon Eyes!”

As they got closer, Wang Xian immediately opened his dragon eyes and scanned ahead!

“This huge mountain is extremely sturdy. Even a level 7 immortal king would need one to two years to destroy this huge mountain!”

Sensing that the huge mountain was blocking his vision, he muttered to himself!

He looked at a cave entrance and landed in front of it immediately!

The entire cave passage was dozens of kilometers long. Looking in from the cave entrance, one could see that it was hollow after dozens of kilometers!

Looking in, he didn’t see anything!

Wang Xian moved his arm and the Five Elements Millstone appeared in front of him. Slowly, the five elements millstone concealed itself and flew straight in!

When the five elements Millstone entered, the scene inside appeared in his sight!

“This is?”

He looked down and a hint of surprise appeared on his face!

Inside the giant peak, the top was hollow and there was nothing. However, there was a sea of fire below. No, it was lava. It was red to the point of blackening! L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

The lava was viscous and looked like a swamp. However, one could sense the terrifying temperature inside!

Wang Xian’s entire internal space of the giant mountain was about 100 million kilometers in radius. On top of the magma, he could see many abyssal seeds!

Seeing that his surroundings were safe, he entered the cave and kept the five elements millstone. Then, he looked down at the magma below!

“Roar Roar Roar!”

All of a sudden, there was a roar coming from the entrance of a cave below!

He looked over and saw 5 to 6 undying level 7 abyss species flying out from the cave!

And behind them, there were 7 to 8,000 underlings, they were flying above the lava, staring coldly into the lava!

“Howl Howl Howl!”

As they flew, they roared. Finally, one of the abyss species couldn’t help but fly straight into the lava below!

The rest of the abyssal seeds immediately followed behind!

Boom! Boom! Boom

Soon, the sounds of battle came from within the lava. Wang Xian revealed an astonished expression!

“What is this? There are still many abyssal seeds in the lava. They are fighting each other. No, they are snatching treasures!”

Wang Xian’s dragon eyes of Yin Yang and five elements looked over and revealed an astonished expression!

The Abyss species that had rushed down clearly wanted to fly toward the bottom, and around them, there was a dark red abyss species that stopped them!
