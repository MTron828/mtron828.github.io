Translator: 549690339

“Suppression, this suppression is a little obvious!”

“This disciple of the Dragon Gate’s attacks are so terrifying. The golden longswords are endless, and they can accurately strike in every direction. It’s too terrifying!”

“The young swordsman in the battle is like an ice-cold machine. His attacks are simply too sharp. When he was suppressing the Holy Doctor Holy Medicine Immortal sect just now, he couldn’t see anything. Now, he’s simply too strong!”

“Fortunately, Yu Wenhua didn’t agree to the life-and-death battle just now. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have had a chance to win at all!”

The group of immortal sect disciples looked at the battle on the arena below.

This battle was somewhat out of many people’s expectations. Yu Wenhua was originally a heaven’s pride expert who was qualified to fight for the first place this time, but now, he was completely powerless against a young swordsman.

He could only use his strong earth attribute defense to block the attacks time and time again.

As disciples of the immortal sect with such a status, each of them also had their own trump cards. Yu Wenhua’s trump card was a type of defense, an extremely terrifying defense.

But under the attacks of the Golden Swordfish, there was no chance of winning.

All the disciples of the immortal sect could see it, let alone the immortal gods!

On the arena, Yu Wenhua’s face was extremely pale. His arms trembled slightly from the repeated attacks. On the contrary, the Golden Swordfish standing in the air launched powerful attacks without any expression on its face.

On the surrounding platforms, the heaven’s chosen of the immortal sects standing at the front watched the Golden Swordfish’s attacks with extremely grave expressions.

Even Xuanyuan Fengyi of the Xuanyuan clan and a burly young man of the Wild Beast Immortal sect watched with flickering eyes.

Even if it was them, they didn’t have absolute confidence in winning against this terrifying young swordsman. In fact, they might even lose!

This caused the expressions of all the heaven’s favorites from the immortal sects to turn ugly.

“Ka Ka!”

At this moment, a crack appeared on Yu Wenhua’s defense from below, causing his face to turn pale.

“You’re not my match!”

The golden swordfish glanced at the cracked defense and didn’t continue to attack. Its body moved and it directly flew towards the Dragon Gate platform.

“Hu hu!”

Yu Wenhua panted heavily and his pale face slowly recovered.

He did not say anything, nor did he say anything fierce. His body moved and he flew towards the Yu Wen clan’s platform.

He could feel that the gap between him and the young swordsman of Dragon Gate was very big.

He was not a match for him. He was completely not a match for him. This was a complete suppression of his strength!

“The disciples of the Dragon Gate are truly outstanding talents. Our Yuwen clan has admitted defeat. Level two formation, ming-qing Formation!”

The supreme elder of the Yuwen clan had no expression on his face. He waved his arm and four formation compasses flew towards Wang Xian.

“Thank you for letting me win!”

Wang Xian smiled faintly. His gaze swept across the formation compasses and a faint smile appeared on his face.

Ming Qing Array Compass: level two array formation

Clear Mind, clear mind.

This was a relatively unorthodox auxiliary array formation. Its effect was somewhat similar to the dragon field which could enhance one’s comprehension ability.

However, in terms of effect, it was dozens of times weaker than the Dragon Field’s ability.

However, it was still a level two array formation.

Wang Xian’s face was full of smiles. He sat there and swept his gaze across all the immortal sects. He continued to speak indifferently, “The disciples of the Dragon sect are not participating in this prodigy tournament!”

“Since the Dragon Gate is not participating, let’s continue!” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

The grand elder of the Xuan Yuan clan took a glance at Wang Xian and spoke to all the immortal sects.

The competition continued. Forty-one Heaven’s favorites were competing for twenty-one spots.

However, the following competition made many disciples of the immortal sects feel that there was too much exaggeration in this heaven’s favorites competition.

That was because the Dragon Gate was not participating.

The powerful five young disciples of the Dragon Gate who were half-step immortal gods would definitely occupy five seats.

And according to the young swordsmen of half-step immortal gods, the strength of those swordsmen of the infant realm would definitely not be weak.

There were even many disciples who guessed that the strength of those young disciples of the infant realm should be able to reach the top 21.

However, the Dragon King did not let the disciples of the Dragon Gate participate!

The first Heaven’s pride competition was held for three days.

When the last day was over, the Heaven’s pride ranking came out.

First Place: Xuanyuan Fengyi!

Second Place: Shou Tian!

Third place: Yu Wenhua!

Fourth place: Wan Qingyun!

...

The rankings came out one by one. The Xuan Yuan clan was first, the Mad Beast Immortal sect disciples were second, the Yu Wen clan was third, and the True Martial Immortal Academy was fourth...

As soon as this information was released, it immediately blew up the entire jianghu.

In the past two days, the matter of the Prodigy competition had caused a huge sensation on the jianghu internet.

The ten prodigies of the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect had all been killed by the disciples of the Dragon Gate!

Yuwen Hua had been defeated by the disciples of the Dragon Gate!

These two pieces of news caused a sensation on the jianghu internet the next day, and also shocked all the disciples of the immortal sect.

When the news spread on the Internet that the two terrifying immortal gods of the Dragon Gate had brought twenty young disciples, it shocked all the martial artists.

This was especially true for the disciples and family members of the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect, as well as those who supported the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect.

On the third day, after the Prodigy tournament ended, the rankings were determined, and it shocked the entire jianghu.

“The first prodigy tournament has ended. Looking at the rankings, I really have mixed feelings. If all the disciples of the Dragon Gate were to go on stage, I wonder what the situation would be like!”

“This year’s prodigy tournament is too exaggerated. Xuanyuan Fengyi’s swordsmanship is very strong, but if that young swordsman from the Dragon Gate goes up, I wonder who will win first place!”

“No one would have thought that under the pressure of the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect, the Dragon Gate would be able to bring out such a terrifying foundation. This time, the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect was too miserable. All The Prodigy disciples were completely killed!”

“There were three pitiful people in this heaven’s chosen tournament. The Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect, Yuwen Yue, and Fairy Hua were all courting death. Now, they’ve been taught a good lesson by the Dragon Gate. They deserve it!”

One by one, the topics were trending on the jianghu internet. The performance of the Dragon Gate caused all the disciples of the immortal sect to be shocked.

And the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect became the laughing stock of this year’s Heaven’s chosen tournament. They became the target of ridicule.

Initially, they were provoking others, but in the end, they were completely crushed. In this competition, the Holy Medicine and Holy Medicine Immortal sect became the biggest loser.

As for the Dragon sect, their reputation soared.

Powerful Disciples, at least five immortals, and terrifying foundations.

Even without the existence of ordinary disciples, the Dragon Sect’s strength could rank around the fifth among all the immortal sects.

However, on the jianghu internet, many disciples of the Holy Medicine and Holy Medicine Immortal sect clamored that they would make the Dragon sect pay a heavy price.

When everyone saw the comments made by the disciples of the two great immortal sects, they also became slightly solemn.

The strength displayed by the holy medicine and holy medicine sects was much stronger than the strength displayed by the Dragon Gate.

Moreover, in the disciple competition of the immortal sects, the sect leaders of the two great immortal sects had clearly stated that the Dragon Gate would wait.

It was possible that the two great immortal sects would take revenge at any time.

And after the disciple competition, there was another matter that attracted more attention in jianghu.

The Dragon Gate would hold an auction!
