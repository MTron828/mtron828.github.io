Chapter 914: 0915 diamond grade monsters were attacking the city

Translator: 549690339

The mission to defend the city was about to begin!

The rest of the missions had been eliminated. During the special time, the main mission was to defend the city.

Wang Xian and the rest rushed towards the east gate. There were also many mercenary groups rushing towards the East Gate.

The entire street was filled with cultivators holding weapons. Their faces were filled with fighting spirit.

When they arrived at the city gate, the city wall was filled with city guards.

They were standing on top with bows and arrows in their hands, and weapons in their hands.

In the middle of the city wall stood a middle-aged man.

The strongest person in holy sea town, the mayor of a town, Jin Qianyuan!

At this moment, beside Jin Qianyuan was an old man dressed in the uniform of a member of the demon-hunting mercenary association.

The words “Demon-hunting”were written on the old man’s clothes.

This was the president of the demon-hunting Mercenary Association of Holy Sea Town, a transcendent level 8 powerhouse.

At this moment, there were many mercenary groups gathered in front of the city gate. Each of them held a weapon in their hands, waiting for the mission to be activated and the mayor’s order.

“According to our investigation, this should be the first wave of attack. There are even more powerful aquatic creatures behind!”

In the middle of the city wall, Jin Qianyuan stared ahead with a serious expression.

In the ocean ahead, groups of creatures swam towards them. At a glance, they were densely packed, almost endless.

At the front was a very strange monster.

A white shell was on both sides of its body. It had four limbs, and one of its arms was as long as a knife.

The knife was emitting a golden light.

This monster was not very big. Most of them were about one meter in size, and the biggest one was only three meters in size.

This was a golden scalpel fish, an aquatic creature with the lowest transcendence level one.

Other than the ground, there was also a strange aquatic creature in the sky. Its entire body was pitch-black, like a bat, and it had a sharp mouthpart and a black whip-like tail.

Every time this creature stirred, it would bring with it a dense black aura. Its aura seemed to far surpass that of the golden machete fish below.

This was a demonic winged beast. Its strength was at least at the second rank of the extraordinary realm.

Apart from these two aquatic creatures, there were other creatures behind it. However, they were still very far away from holy sea town.

“Kill the first wave of aquatic creatures as soon as possible. Let the mercenary group take action first. The few experts in the city are ready to deal with the leader of the fierce beasts at any time!”

The President of the mercenary group stared at the front with an expressionless face and said slowly.

“Well, apart from the west gate, the East Gate, the north gate, and the south gate will be attacked. The East Gate is in the center!”

Jin Qianyuan’s eyes flickered. Seeing that the aquatic creatures were about to arrive, he ordered, “The city defense mission is activated!”

“It’s the Mayor!”

The old man next to him nodded, then slowly turned his head and looked at the city gate.

There were tens of thousands of mercenary group members gathered here, each of them holding a weapon in their hands, waiting for the mission to start.

“City defense mission begins!”

The old man waved his arm, and an image appeared above him.

City defense mission begins!

First mission:

1:5-star silver mission: battle outside the city, kill fierce beasts, according to the number of fierce beasts killed, obtain additional corresponding points, the fierce beast corpse belongs to the Slayer!

2:1-star bronze mission: stand on the city wall and attack from afar. Based on the number of berserk beasts killed, you will receive additional points. The corpse of the berserk beast will belong to the Slayer!

Additional points: 1 point for a Tier 1 berserk beast, 10 points for a Tier 2 berserk beast, 100 points for a Tier 3 berserk beast, and 1,000 points for a Tier 4 berserk beast. The points will be increased one by one!

When a mercenary group participates in a mission, more than half of them must complete it!

There were two missions, and they were vastly different.

The first mission was to leave the city and fight. As long as they survived, they would be considered to have completed the 5-star silver mission.

While fighting on the city wall, the 1-star bronze mission was mainly because there was no danger on the city wall.

Apart from these two missions, killing a beast could obtain points and the corpse of the Beast!

The first mission was relatively dangerous, while the second mission was 100% safe. Obviously, the demon hunters would encourage mercenary groups to leave the city to fight.

The first wave of attacks could be easily defended by the guards on the city wall.

“You can accept missions through the mission stone plate, or you can accept missions through registration!”

“Mission begins!”

“Boom Boom Boom!”

When the old man finished speaking, the city gate immediately opened.

“Haha, if you want to kill, then go out and kill. Brother, follow me and Charge!”

“F * ck, although it’s dangerous, as long as we can survive, we can definitely make a fortune. Haha, Charge!”

Very quickly, a mercenary group chose a mission and directly charged out of the city.

The first wave of missions was not very dangerous. For cultivators whose strength had reached transcendent level 3 or 4, the danger of leaving the city to battle was not very high.

However, the rewards would definitely not be low.

The mercenary groups flew out with fighting spirit.

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian did not hesitate at all. His body moved and he flew straight into the sky towards the outside of the city.

During the period of defending the city, he could fly in the city.

A group of members from the Dragon Palace followed behind while the strange demon was hidden in the void.

Wang Xian and the rest were floating in the sky outside the city. They stared ahead with cold eyes.

There were about seven to eight thousand cultivators around them. Each of them was at least at level two of the extraordinary realm.

There were at least hundreds of thousands of goldfish in front of them. There were also thousands of demonic winged beasts in the sky.

The battle to defend the city was about to begin.

The real battle was about to erupt!

“It’s all of you!”

At this moment, a cold voice came from the side.

Wang Xian frowned and looked to the side. He saw four to five young men staring at him coldly.

“What’s wrong? Who Is He?”

In the middle of the young men, a young man with long hair tied up and a golden longsword under his feet looked at the four to five of them curiously.

Beside them, Jin Liuyan also looked over curiously.

“Leader, this kid called our mercenary group Trash and even mocked us!”

A young man stared at Wang Xian coldly and said to the long-haired young man beside him.

“Is that so?”

A cold glint flashed across the eyes of the long-haired young man. Jin Liuyan frowned and looked at Wang Xian and the rest.

“He is only one level higher than US and he said that we are trash. Kid, you are really arrogant!”

The long-haired young man moved his palm and another golden longsword appeared in his hand.

“Hehe, trash, it’s time to fight!”

Wang Xian swept his gaze across the few of them with a hint of disdain in his eyes. He stared ahead and charged forward.

“Kill!”

“Kill, Kill, Kill!”

An earth-shattering sound of killing rang out as seven to eight thousand people charged towards the hundreds of thousands of golden mackerel.

When the long-haired young man and the rest heard Wang Xian’s words, their faces turned ugly instantly.

“What an arrogant fellow who is courting death!”

The long-haired young man’s face was gloomy. His eyes flickered as he swept his gaze across Wang Xian’s figure.

“Let’s kill the ferocious beasts first!” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Jin Liuyan, who was at the side, also frowned. She shouted softly and charged over.
