Translator: 549690339

The smile on Ling Xiao’s face froze, and his expression changed drastically.

He had never thought that a bride would treat a guest like this.

And the person she treated was actually the Dragon King. This was a blatant humiliation.

No matter what, a guest was a guest. You had to at least be polite. Even if there was enmity between the two parties, you couldn’t show it on this occasion.

This was under the gaze of more than a hundred immortals and under the gaze of all the powers on Earth.

This was simply a slap in the face.

The surrounding people who were paying attention to this place were also stunned and revealed expressions of shock.

This was especially so for the people from the Huaxia Immortal sect. Their faces revealed expressions of shock.

“Peng, What do you mean? Do you know how to be polite? Do you have any upbringing?”

When Xiao Yu saw this scene, an angry expression immediately appeared on her face. She heavily placed the wine glass on the table, making a loud noise.

This time, everyone at the wedding banquet was attracted by the commotion.

“What’s going on? What Happened?”

All the immortals, gods, and experts who hadn’t noticed the situation just now looked at this scene in shock.

“It seems that Princess Philomena directly ignored the Dragon King when she was toasting!”

“No Way! What’s going on? How could she not give face to the Dragon King?”

“Could it be that the Nordic Celestial Realm wants to kill the Dragon King’s spirit? I just heard that the Dragon King cut off the arms of two divine sons and daughters and a group of celestial realm disciples a few days ago!”

“She’s not giving face to the Dragon King? This is a blatant slap in the face!”

Some of the immortal gods from the Huaxia immortal sects were shocked when they saw this scene.

The immortal gods’disciples, who had yet to arrive, widened their eyes in shock. They were filled with disbelief.

He’s not giving the Dragon King any face?

“Haha, Good, good. Princess Philomena is not giving the Dragon King any face. He’s embarrassing himself. Haha, this is so satisfying!”

“This is interesting. Isn’t Your Dragon King arrogant? You still dare to be arrogant in front of our Princess Philomena?”

“HMPH, now the Dragon King has lost a lot of face. He came to attend the wedding, but the bride didn’t give him face at all. Haha, this is Great!”

The western domain of gods and divine sons and daughters watched this scene with smiles on their faces.

Especially the gods from the Garden of Eden, Ancient Greece, and Rome, they all looked at this scene with smiles on their faces.

Your Dragon King is extremely arrogant, yet you still dare to be arrogant in front of the daughter of the god King?

“Is that the Dragon King’s sister? HMPH, you actually dare to say that Princess Philomena has no upbringing, you’re really courting death!”

“Now that the Yuwen clan and the Scandinavian God’s domain are connected by marriage, they have become the most powerful force on Earth in a single leap. This Dragon King’s sister is still spouting nonsense like an idiot, she really thinks that her brother is invincible, Hehe!”

When some people heard little feather’s words, their faces revealed mocking expressions.

Sitting in the center, the gods of the Scandinavian god realm saw this scene and smiled without saying a word.

With the god King’s love for this princess, so what if he didn’t give the Dragon King Face?

They didn’t take the Dragon Palace seriously at all. In the entire world, they didn’t take it seriously at all.

The grand elder of the Yuwen clan and the surrounding immortals frowned slightly, their faces slightly unsightly.

“If Philomena won’t give face to the Dragon King, then so be it. The Dragon King killed my daughter-in-law. Are We Afraid of them?”

At this moment, a middle-aged man among the immortals of the Yuwen clan said coldly.

The surrounding immortals of the Yuwen clan heard the middle-aged man’s words and fell silent.

Fairy Hua was the daughter-in-law of this middle-aged immortal God, but she was killed by a disciple of the Dragon Palace.

Now that his eldest son had married the daughter of the godly king, the middle-aged man’s strength had also reached that of a superior immortal, so his position in the Yuwen clan was very high.

Moreover, it was Philomena’s action this time, so they couldn’t stop her.

Now, they weren’t afraid of the Dragon King anymore. If they didn’t give him face, they wouldn’t give him face!

“Shut up!”

Yu Wenhua heard Xiao Yu’s words and stared at her coldly.

“What’s wrong, Yu Wenhua? Do you still think I’m afraid of You?” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Xiao Yu saw Yu Wenhua staring at him coldly and her aura was instantly released. A strong pressure of a mid-level immortal rushed towards Yu Wenhua.

Wang Xian waved his hand and dispersed Xiao Yu’s aura. A hint of killing intent flashed in his eyes as he raised his wine glass indifferently!

“Oh, this is?”

Everyone was slightly shocked. When they saw Wang Xian raising his wine glass, they were stunned.

“Haha, this Dragon King is cowardly. He doesn’t dare to be arrogant anymore?”

An immortal from the western celestial domain laughed out loud. His face was filled with ridicule.

“It seems that even the Dragon King has no choice but to bow his head. The Northern European celestial domain and the Yuwen clan are too powerful. They are not something the Dragon Palace can contend against.”

“Yeah, I didn’t expect the Dragon King to admit defeat. It’s really rare. This time, the Northern European God realm really killed the Dragon King’s spirit!”

“I have no choice but to bow my head. The Alliance of the two forces is invincible on Earth!”

The Immortals and gods of Huaxia immortal sects sighed slightly when they saw this scene.

They didn’t expect that the Dragon King would actually admit defeat one day. He drank the wine himself when the other party didn’t give him any face.

However, it was also true. The Dragon King’s participation in this wedding represented his goodwill towards the Yuwen clan and the Nordic divine territory.

However, the effect was somewhat counter-productive.

“Hehe!”

Philomena raised her head slightly when she saw Wang Xian raising his wine glass. A hint of an arrogant sneer appeared on her face.

Yu Wenhua was stunned for a moment before a faint smile appeared on his face.

The Dragon King had also given in in front of them.

“Pa Pa Pa!”

However, just when everyone thought that the Dragon King would drink the wine...

Wang Xian slowly poured the wine cup over. The wine slowly dripped onto the ground.

The wine dripped onto the array formation and made a clicking sound.

All of them fell to the ground.

Everyone was stunned before a look of shock appeared on their faces.

“Dragon King, how could he... how could he pour wine on the ground...”

An immortal God looked shocked and stammered.

Pour wine on the ground. This was a toast to the dead.

This was a toast to the dead.

The Dragon King actually poured wine on the ground in front of them during their wedding.

This was simply... simply...

The wine falling to the ground was not only the custom of the Easterners, the West also knew what this meant.

In an instant, many people stood up with embarrassed expressions on their faces.

In particular, all the immortals and gods of the Nordic divine realm and the Yuwen clan had angry expressions on their faces.

The Dragon King poured the wine on the ground. What did this mean? was he going to...

Kill them!

In an instant, the atmosphere at the wedding banquet turned solemn.

Philomena and Yu Wenhua’s faces turned gloomy immediately. They stared at Wang Xian coldly.
