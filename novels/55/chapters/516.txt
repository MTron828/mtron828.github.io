Chapter 517: Remains Annihilated

“Every tail bone of Lord Ossein has destructive power that can bring down the world. Each of them was made from the secret art of the Remains, after consuming a large number of worldly treasures. According to the elders, Lord Ossein alone could fight against five Dan Realm Experts!”

“Lord Ossein is considered the invincible existence among Dan Realm Experts. That person used an unknown method to turn into a Divine Dragon, but he’s a far cry from our Lord Ossein!”

“In the myths, Divine Dragons can rise to the sky, travel in the clouds, tumble the water. Every one of them is a few hundred meters in size. From what I see, this Divine Dragon is practicing Bloodline Cultivation, which is similar to those in Europe!”

The group of Remains disciples watched with smiles on their faces.

Twenty-seven Dragonians were already fully suppressed by eighty Inborn Experts from the Remains, and they could passively defend themselves.

If it were not for the Nether Skull, there might have been casualties.

It would not be long before they were killed!

“The Dragon Sect is simply providing materials. Twenty-seven Inborn Experts will make powerful bone puppets!”

“After Lord Ossein makes his tail bone from this Divine Dragon, his strength will be enhanced greatly again. Then, Emperor Qi might not be his match!”

“With so many materials before our war, our strength will be greatly enhanced!”

A group of Remains disciples revealed malevolent smiles as they watched the battle.

Both the elderly and young were exhibiting bloodthirsty looks on their faces.

“Heh!”

Seeing the tail bone sweeping at him, Wang Xian displayed a contemptuous look.

When the tail bone was a hundred meters away from him, Wang Xian shook his body.

“Hmph!”

He let out a soft snort. With a jerk, solid mustard shields appeared around Wang Xian.

His body was giving off a bright yellow glow. Every single dragon scale on him looked extremely solid.

Boom boom!

Nine tail bones slammed onto the mustard shields surrounding Wang Xian, causing all the shields to vibrate.

Yet, there was no trace of cracks on them at all.

“Is this all you’ve got? Didn’t you want me to try to see how many tail bones I could block?”

Wang Xian craned up his dragon head with disdainful eyes, staring at Lord Ossein, who was in shock.

“No, this can’t be it. Damm it, it should crack!”

Disbelief took over the expression on Lord Ossein’s face with five tail bones straightened up.

Poof!

A bone piercing sound was heard when sharp bones went through the top part of the tail bone.

Five tail bones spun with violent movement as they drilled into the Earth Shields!

Bam, Bam, Bam!

A hair-raising sound came from the sky, where five tail bones could only drill half a meter into the shield with their full forces.

In the face of the few-meters-thick shields, it was to no avail.

In particular, Lord Ossein’s heart was slamming against his rib cage when he saw the taunting look on Wang Xian.

“It’s my turn!”

With a contemptuous look in Wang Xian’s eyes, thick thistles and thorns suddenly grew out from the shields.

The strips of thistles and thorns went straight to the five tail bones and clung to them.

“What? What kind of attack is this?”

Upon seeing the thistles and thorns winding up at the tail bone, there was a drastic change in Lord Ossein’s expression.

From the flame just now, to the Earth Shield and thistles and thorns, he did not understand how he managed to have so many attacking means.

“The so-called Lord Ossein is a piece of trash in my eyes. Let me try to see how many tail bones I can withstand? Hehe, what irony!”

Wang Xian slowly reached out his dragon claws. From the Earth Shields, a strip of thistles and thorns came under his claws.

Wang Xian grabbed it and said, “Let me see if you can survive for ten seconds under my attack!”

As he spoke, he made a move and struck at Lord Ossein. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

With an appalling look, five of Lord Ossein’s tail bones were trembling. To his horror, the power that he was proud of could not even shake off Wang Xian’s shackles.

“A Dan Realm Expert couldn’t be that strong!”

Lord Ossein appeared a little like a stone as he quickly exclaimed, “You’re a Budding Realm Expert! A Budding Realm!”

Coldness spread on Wang Xian’s face as he raked his dragon claws at him.

“No, I’m the leader of the Remains. I’m immortal!”

There was a huge change in the expression of Lord Ossein, and the easiness and calmness from earlier on went missing. He malevolently controlled the remaining five tail bones and hurled them at Wang Xian.

With a swing, the thistles and thorns in Wang Xian’s hand were growing at a frenzied speed. Strips of thistles and thorns instantly grew to over ten meters long.

Dozens of thistles and thorns knocked themselves against five tail bones.

Bam, Bam, Bam!

Some of them broke away, but there were more that wrapped themselves onto the tail bones.

“Do you still have other means of attack?”

Wang Xian stared at Lord Ossein with sarcasm as he grabbed Lord Ossein’s body with the dragon claws that were emitting golden radiance.

“No... no...”

Lord Ossein was appalled and despaired.

The dragon claw of Wang Xian reached Lord Ossein and gripped his body.

“An ant that I can crush anytime!”

Wang Xian clenched his dragon claw, and a bone-cracking sound could be heard. The Energy of the Gold Summit on the dragon claws were crushing everything in his body.

“No...”

A desperate voice resonated through the place of the Remains.

“No, how can our Lord Ossein be killed? This is impossible. I don’t believe it. This is not true!”

At this moment, the group of disciples of the Remains who were waiting for their Lord Ossein to display his mightiness were staring with disbelieving eyes. What they had witnessed was the easy defeat of Lord Ossein.

It was all too easy. The other party did not even exert much strength, and he could slay their invincible Lord Ossein!

All their beliefs were toppled instantly.

This was totally different from what they had anticipated.

“Today, I’ll annihilate the Remains!”

Wang Xian swept his cold gaze at all the Remains disciples below him. He opened his mouth and spewed out a ball of daunting flames.

Flames fell on them like magma washing down from the sky.

“Run for your life!”

Frightening screams came from below as the Remains disciples let out their desperate growls with terrified faces.

They fled in panic, but the flames in the sky pouring down seemed to be endless.

This was the true-blue destructive power that could wipe out Heaven and Earth.

Wang Xian stood in the sky, a hundred meters above the ground, while all the Remains disciples were shrouded by the flame wherever it passed.

Those who were not even Inborns yet perished in the fire.

Wang Xian was merciless, as he would not let them off because of how they worked and how cruel they were.

“Oh no, Lord Ossein is dead. He’s been killed!”

“Flee for your life!”

The Inborn Experts from the Remains who were besieging the Dragonians sensed the formidable strength from behind. All of them were horrified.

With terror, they gave up on the siege of the Dragonians and fled desperately away.

“Do you think you can escape?”

However, it was impossible for Inborn Experts to get away from a Budding Realm Expert, not to mention Wang Xian, who was close to the Immortal Realm.

Roar!

After a bellow, a ball of flames landed on the last Inborn Expert of the Remains who was enveloped by the daunting flame even before he could display his ‘Golden Cicada sheds its shell.’

After that, the Remains were annihilated!

No one had expected the Remains, one of the four main devil sects, to be annihilated within a night.
