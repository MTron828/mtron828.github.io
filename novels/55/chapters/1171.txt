Boom

In the Dragon Palace, when Wang Xian was looking through some information about the Dragon Palace, a powerful aura came from a mountain peak in front of the Dragon King’s palace.

“What a fast speed. It has only been half a day and he has already made a breakthrough!”

Wang Xian was slightly stunned. He looked over and saw that the blazing flames were emitting a terrifying temperature. It dyed half of the sky in the Dragon Palace Red.

“The indestructible wood has the ability to double the cultivation speed of fire element cultivators. This is also the reason why Feng Luan is able to improve so quickly!”

Wang Xian thought to himself. He saw a noble figure walking out from a mountain peak.

He moved his feet slightly and exuded an imposing aura.

“You broke through so quickly?”

Wang Xian looked at Feng Luan and asked with a smile.

“It’s all thanks to my training in Your Dragon Palace. Otherwise, I would need at least two years to break through to the second level of the Seethrough Realm!”

Feng luan smiled and said, “The auction of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire will be held in four days. At that time, many experts from the Liuhai region will be here. You should hide well in the Dragon Palace!”

“Many experts from the Liuhai region? Did you publicize the auction to so many countries?”

Wang Xian asked in slight surprise.

“There’s no need to publicize it to every country. We just need to publicize it at the place of the tomb of the human demon!”

Feng Luan smiled and looked at him. In a good mood, she walked to Wang Xian and placed a fruit into her mouth.

“The tomb of the human demon?”

Wang Xian was slightly taken aback. “What kind of place is the tomb of the human demon?”

“Don’t you know? It seems like you still don’t know much about the transcendence continent!”

Feng Luan shook her head. “The human-demon graveyard is also a battlefield between humans and beasts. On the transcendence continent, some demonic beasts coexist peacefully with humans while some demonic beasts fight to the death with humans!”

“Demonic beasts are extremely smart. Powerful Demonic Beast races have established groups of tribes and control billions of ferocious beasts. The human-demon graveyard is a special place!”

“In the middle of the flowing sea region is called the blood flow sea. It is an area covered by forests and oceans. There used to be an ancient sect called the blood flow sect in the blood flow sea!”

“Blood flow sect?”

When Wang Xian heard Feng Luan mention these three words, he seemed to have some impression of it. He seemed to have seen it somewhere before.

“Blood flow sect is a very special ancient sect. It used to be the overlord of the flowing sea region. Blood flow sect is an ancient sect that was founded by demonic beasts and humans. Their cultivation method is a little special. They gather fresh blood and spiritual energy to increase their strength.”

“At that time, the blood stream sect had millions of disciples. Their strength was extremely terrifying. It was said that even the dragon clan did not dare to provoke the blood stream sect. Later, a shocking war broke out between the human clan and the Demon Beast clan within the Blood Stream sect. Since then, the blood stream sect was annihilated

“However, although the blood stream sect was annihilated, it still left behind the Blood Stream Holy Land. This blood stream holy land was a paradise for humans and Demon Beasts. It was even located at the core of the Blood Stream Holy Land. The level of spiritual energy here was not inferior to that of Your Dragon Palace

“Therefore, this place became a place where humans and Demon Beasts fought for. Countless demon beast experts, humans, and even ferocious beasts flocked to this place

“There used to be descendants of the Demon Beast Race of the Blood Stream sect. Therefore, the demon beasts and humans there were in a hostile state. Whenever they met, they would kill each other

“In that place, humans and Demon Beasts fought for five to six hundred years. Hundreds of thousands of human experts died

“Later, some human experts withdrew from the fight for this place, and the rest of the human experts also withdrew!”

“But after 500 years, a group of terrifying demonic beasts entered the human kingdoms and directly massacred four to five kingdoms. Only then did all the humans in the Liuhai region realize the danger!”

“Those demonic beasts that occupied the blood stream sect had their strength increased by five to six times over the course of 500 years. Letting the demonic beasts occupy that place was undoubtedly a slow death for the humans.”

“Therefore, all the dynasties in the Liuhai region gathered their strength and set up a large-scale mercenary group there. They issued many missions there

“From then on, humans once again fought with the demon beasts for the spiritual liquid and the blood essence. After thousands of years, the members of the mercenary group and the experts who died there numbered in the hundreds of millions. After that, they were known as the graveyard of the transvestites

“Nowadays, the graveyard of the demi-humans is known as the training ground for the weak, the glorious battlefield for the strong mercenary group, and the famous place for the strong and the Heaven’s favorites!”

“I’ve publicized the auction house of the Dragon and Phoenix dynasty there. Naturally, it will be spread to all the dynasties in the Liuhai Region!”

Feng Luan told Wang Xian about one in detail. This made him nod his head slightly.

He didn’t expect there to be such a place in the flowing sea region.

“The training ground for the weak, the glorious battlefield for the powerful mercenary groups, and the famous place for the Strong Heaven’s favorites?”

Wang Xian was deep in thought.

“Alright, I have to head to the dragon-phoenix royal city to make some preparations. There might be a terrifying powerhouse at the fourth level of the void interpretation stage at the auction in four days. I have to be prepared!”

As Feng Luan spoke, she moved her body and prepared to fly out.

“Feng Luan, wait for a moment. Send me the detailed information regarding the human-demon graveyard!”

Wang Xian quickly said to Feng Luan.

“HMM? Alright, why? Do you want to go there and take a look?”

Feng Luan looked at him in surprise.

“Let me take a look first!”

Wang Xian didn’t give a clear answer.

“Get Someone to go to my place to get it!”

Feng Luan said to Wang Xian.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded and immediately sent a golden swordfish over to get the information.

In less than half an hour, the Golden Swordfish sent the information over. Wang Xian then started to read through it.

The graveyard of humans and demons was an area where the humans and demons fought to the death. It must be extraordinary.

The resources there must be far beyond Wang Xian’s imagination.

Now that he wanted to improve further, the resources he needed were too huge. Wang Xian had to think of a way to obtain more resources.

After experiencing the hundred beasts city, Wang Xian had great confidence in the light and dark fire dragon eyes.

He believed that as long as he entered a treasure ground, he would not return empty-handed.

If this cemetery was suitable, Wang Xian could go there and take a look. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Flipping through the information of the cemetery, Wang Xian read through it bit by bit. Very soon, he had a clear understanding of the cemetery.

A hesitant look appeared on his face as he considered whether he should head there.

Just as he thought, the resources there were huge. Many top-notch experts in the Liuhai region had risen to prominence here.

But that place was also very dangerous. There was only one way to obtain resources, and that was to kill.

Only by killing could one obtain resources.

Between humans and beasts, between humans and humans.

Here, the number of insightful emptiness realm experts was no less than fifty. This was a Holy Land, and at the same time, it was also a bloody land!
