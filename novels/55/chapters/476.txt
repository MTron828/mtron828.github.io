Chapter 477: Legacy of Fire God

Boom!

Wang Xian swung his arm and shut the heavy door of the main hall tight.

Within the main hall, the Fire Demon stared at them with a pair of cold eyes.

Argh!

Once the door of the main hall was closed, a suppressing agonizing groan burst out from his arms.

“Sister!”

The young man was flustered as he ran to Wang Xian upon hearing the devastating cry in the side hall. Worriedly, he looked at the girl.

“Ice crystal, hurry, take the ice crystal!”

The young man hurriedly took out blocks of transparent ice that were giving off energy from the girl’s pocket and inserted them in between the brows of the girl.

As soon as the ice crystals touched her glabella, they turned into crystal-clear water drops.

Argh!

However, steam was coming out, and the droplets were seething at the boiling temperature.

“What’s going on? How did this happen?”

The young man was appalled, with a film of cold sweat breaking out on his forehead as he repeated himself.

“The suppressed fire seed has been activated. Water and fire can’t coexist!”

Wang Xian looked at the girl and knit his eyebrow slightly. He placed his palm on her body, sensing the energy flowing through it.

On her left, it felt like water, while the right side of her body felt like fire.

The water and fire were not ordinary.

What made it worse was that the fire and water were not external factors, but they had already integrated with the body as one.

That was the most horrible situation.

Just like Xiao Yu and Elder Fang previously when the black venom had merged together as one.

“What? Activated? No, no. How did this happen?”

Apparently, the young man knew the consequence of activating the fire seed. Terror crawled onto his face as he shook his head in disbelief.

“Brother, I can’t... I can’t take it anymore!”

The girl suddenly opened her eyes, filled with despair.

She reached out her hand to grab the young man by his arm while shaking her head.

Just then, her body began to switch between water and fire.

As the fire and water alternated, the difference was huge.

“Why did this happen? We shouldn’t have come here. How could this happen?”

The young man revealed an indignant look while his body trembled out of guilt.

Upon seeing the girl’s condition, Wang Xian frowned and laid her slowly on the floor.

With his hands on the sides of her body, he instilled the Water Dragon Energy and Inferno Dragon Energy into her body.

The messy water and fire energies were repelling each other without any order, resulting in her inner body being shattered by this energy.

Om!

“Don’t resist and try accepting my energy that is entering your body!” said Wang Xian to the girl when he sensed the fire and water energy in her body.

“Hur?”

The young man was stunned as he fixed his eyes on Wang Xian.

The girl was perspiring profusely as she looked at Wang Xian. Sensing the immense energy in her body, she relaxed immediately.

The Water Dragon Energy and Inferno Dragon Energy took over the messy energies in her body while Wang Xian tried to calm them down.

“Her water-attributed and fire-attributed energies are not strong, but it cannot be eradicated!”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows. As fire seed had originated from the bloodline, he was unable to resolve it, given his current strength.

Not until his strength surpassed the Fire God and Water God.

“Hur?”

Sensing the recovery of energies in her body, the girl stared blankly at Wang Xian with twinkling eyes.

She parted her lips slightly. “Did you just calm the energies in my body?”

“I can only calm them down, but I can’t remove them.” Wang Xian looked at the girl. “Unless both of my hands are kept by your side. Otherwise, the water and fire seed will wreak havoc again. Just now, that Fire Demon launched an attack, targeting something in your body. It’s a bit queer!”

Recalling the previous assault of that Fire Demon, Wang Xian was surprised by that domineering attacking means which he needed to beware.

Upon hearing his words, that girl was stunned and felt the touch of the big hands on her body.

One was scorching hot while the other one was extremely cooling.

The pair of hands were placed on her abdomen area, which caused her expression to change immediately. A flush of redness slowly crawled onto her face and neck.

“This... Senior, can you really calm the energies in my sister’s body?”

The young man stared at Wang Xian fervently.

Wang Xian did not answer him as he looked at the girl and knit his brows slightly.

That Fire Demon gazed at that girl for a moment. But he spat out the word ‘taint’ after sensing the water energy inside her. Did he sense her bloodline or not?

Wang Xian pondered with hesitation.

“Let’s go in and give it a try again!” said Wang Xian to the girl on the floor after some consideration.

“Hur?”

For a moment, the girl froze with a pondering look in her eyes.

She gazed at Wang Xian before she nodded slowly. “I sensed the Fire Demon’s attention on me just now. It must have been my water attribution that caused him to attack me!”

“I guessed so too. Given your fire seed and your Fire God bloodline, the Fire Demon should not be attacking you,” Wang Xian said with affirmation.

A servant for the Fire God should not be killing his offspring. This was for sure.

“But... the water energy inside me!”

“Leave it to me!”

Wang Xian laughed and carried the girl up.

The girl was wearing thick, silicon-material clothes. He could not feel or tell her figure when he picked her up.

Half of her face was hidden behind the blue veil, concealing her appearance.

“Mm!”

The girl let out a soft moan with a face flushed with redness!

“Let’s go!”

Without any further comments, Wang Xian walked towards the door of the main hall.

A bout of flames rose from his body, wrapping the two of them together.

“Fire attribution. This...”

The four young men were shocked when they witnessed the flame rising out from Wang Xian’s body.

Rumble!

Once again, Wang Xian pushed open the door of the main hall.

“Damm you, insignificant thing. Don’t interrupt my master’s sleep!”

As soon as the door was opened, a fireball that contained immense daunting energy was hurled at them.

With a change in Wang Xian’s expression, a fire shield emerged in front of him.

“I am the offspring of the Fire God. I have the fire seed of the Fire God inside me!” said the girl hurriedly as she hid her face in the chest of Wang Xian when she saw the fireball darting towards her.

“Sir Fire Demon, she is the descendant of the Fire God!”

Wang Xian spoke immediately.

“She has an irking aura with her!” the Fire Demon bellowed.

“I am... I am indeed a descendant of the Fire God!”

The girl turned to the Fire Demon and stretched out her fair arm and shot a drop of blood at the Fire Demon.

The massive Fire Demon stared at the blood droplet that was flying toward him. He sensed a familiar vibe and twitched his entire large face. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“You’re really the descendant of my master. Your fire seed has been activated. My master once said that his descendants would obtain his legacy only after the fire seed has been triggered. Otherwise, anyone who comes in here shall die!”

As he stared at the girl, fiery-red radiance was glowing within the pitch-black eyes of Fire Demon.

“Please accept the legacy, descendant of my master!”

The Fire Demon slightly bowed down as he spoke to the girl.
