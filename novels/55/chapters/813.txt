Chapter 814: The aftermath of 0815

Translator: 549690339

“From today onwards, there will be no holy medicine celestial sect and no Holy Medicine Celestial sect in Jianghu!”

In the holy city, tens of millions of people were kneeling on the streets. Wang Xian, who was hovering in the air, announced with a cold face.

All the disciples and family members of the two great celestial sects trembled. At this moment, no one dared to speak.

If they dared to resist, they would be killed immediately. The Dragon King would not show any mercy.

In fact, both parties were hostile forces to begin with. It was reasonable to kill them.

Therefore, they did not want to die. They could only kneel in the sacred city and did not dare to move.

“Search for all the treasures in the two immortal sects. Take everything that is of value and make up for the loss of the Dragon Gate Forging Workshop!”

Wang Xian ordered Prime Minister Gui and the other members of the Dragon Palace.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

The group of Immortals moved and flew towards the mountain gates of the two immortal sects.

As the two immortal sects with deep foundations, their resources would definitely exceed Wang Xian’s imagination.

The number of herbs they planted might not be as much as that of the natural born immortal sects, but it would definitely not be much less.

Their resources were sufficient to make up for the losses they had suffered previously.

Wang Xian floated in the sky and waited for the members of the Dragon Palace to search.

Ten minutes later, Prime Minister Gui and the rest flew out from the gate of immortality. Prime Minister Gui even controlled a herbal field within a radius of ten kilometers.

In the sacred city, everyone knelt on the ground without daring to get up. They didn’t even dare to breathe heavily as they waited quietly.

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian moved his body and flew towards the Dragon Palace.

The group of celestial beings from the Dragon Palace immediately followed behind and flew towards the Dragon Palace.

Only after Wang Xian and the rest left did some people in the entire sacred city dare to stand up slowly.

They looked at the figures that had disappeared and heaved a heavy sigh of relief. At the same time, there was a look of worry on their faces.

“In the future, the world will be at the selfless Holy Doctor and Holy Medicine Immortal sect. Where should we go from here?”

An old man looked up to the sky and said with a face full of worry.

Some other people also stood up silently and walked into the room.

They were the losers of the battle. They had provoked an existence that they shouldn’t have provoked.

A powerful immortal sect instantly declined.

They had brought this upon themselves.

The distant immortal God also watched this scene quietly. His gaze looked towards the sacred city as his gaze flickered.

“Let’s accept the disciples of the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal Sect!”

The Xuan Yuan clan and the Yuwen clan looked at each other and slowly nodded.

Although the experts of the two immortal sects had all died, there were still many experts at the Dan stage.

Moreover, there were only benefits and no disadvantages in accepting them.

At the same time, this was considered a pretty good home for a disciple of an immortal sect who had been exterminated.

However, at the same time, the battle on the Jianghu website had shocked everyone.

The battle between the thirty immortals and gods resounded throughout the two jianghu websites.

Even in the sky, most people could see this shocking scene.

The attacks were as shocking as meteors hitting the earth.

The terrifying flames and the screams of the immortals and gods caused people’s scalps to go numb.

“Luckily, they were fighting in the sky. If they were on the ground, their battle could destroy several provinces!” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Several provinces are a bit exaggerated. The most important thing is that the Dragon Palace is too powerful. They are completely overpowered. If they were evenly matched, the destructive power would be great. However, the Dragon Palace is too powerful!”

“For the past two days, the disciples of the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine immortal sect have been clamoring that they would destroy the dragon sect. However, the Dragon King has led the experts of the Dragon Palace to directly destroy them. They can’t be arrogant now!”

“The two disciples of the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect knelt in the city for half an hour without daring to move. It is already a blessing that the Dragon King did not kill them. They have humiliated the Dragon King on the Jianghu Internet!”

“There is no longer the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect in the world. The Dragon Palace will rise to the top of the immortal sect!”

“No one would have thought that the most powerful sect in the world was not the immortal sect that came from the secular world, but the Dragon Palace, which used to be a force in the jianghu. The strongest person in the jianghu is undoubtedly the Dragon King!”

“The Dragon King is able to transform into a divine dragon, which is somewhat similar to the bloodline cultivation in the west. It must be because the Dragon King got a great opportunity and obtained the divine dragon bloodline that his cultivation speed is so fast!”

On the Jianghu website, the disciples of the immortal sects were discussing on the internet in amazement.

The impact of this great battle on the Jianghu was too great.

The death of twelve immortal gods, including one Upper Immortal and three middle immortals, shocked everyone.

After the end of the war.

The Dragon Palace had become the most powerful force in the pugilistic world.

And the Dragon King was the most powerful force in the pugilistic world.

“Dragon King, we have obtained a lot of good things this time, especially the spiritual herbs and elixirs. There are a lot of them. There are even grade-9 spiritual herbs!”

Prime Minister Gui came to the Dragon King’s Hall in the Dragon Palace and reported to Wang Xian with a smile on his face.

“Move all of them to the herb garden. In addition, place the corpses of the immortal gods from the two immortal sects at the Dragon Pond and absorb them. Try your best to nurture a few more immortal gods!”

Wang Xian sat on the dragon throne with a smile on his face and said to Prime Minister Gui.

“It’s the Dragon King. He should be able to nurture five to six immortal gods!”

Prime Minister Gui said with a smile on his face.

“Okay.”

Wang Xian nodded and swept his gaze across the surrounding members of the Dragon Palace.

Currently, there were sixteen immortal-level members. It wouldn’t be long before there would be more of them.

“Mo Qinglong!”

“The Old Devil Is Here!”

“Continue to build the Dragon Gate forging workshop. The workshop will continue to open for business within three days!”

Wang Xian ordered Mo Qinglong.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Mo Qinglong replied respectfully.

The Dragon Gate forging workshop still needed to continue to be built. With this forging workshop, the resources obtained would be able to increase the number of immortals in the Dragon Palace by at least a dozen.

“This is Your Dragon Palace?”

At this moment, a surprised voice was heard.

Wang Xian turned his head and looked at Feng Luan.

At this moment, he was looking at his surroundings with a face full of surprise. His eyes were burning as he stared at the ancestral tree.

Currently, there were three branches on the ancestral tree — the soul-returning wood, the eternal wood, and the tree of servitude.

Each of the branches was extremely mystical and exuded a powerful energy.

“The eternal wood, the legendary divine wood of the Vermilion Bird tribe. The Eternal Wood. Phew!”

Feng Luan took a deep breath and looked around. “This Dragon Palace of yours is similar to the legendary Dragon Palace on the supernatural continent. Could it be that you have obtained the inheritance of the dragon tribe on the supernatural continent?”

Wang Xian smiled gently and did not speak.

He did not know how strong the dragon tribe on the supernatural continent was. However, he had obtained the Invincible Divine Dragon System. It was definitely not something that the dragon tribe on the supernatural continent could compare to.

“So many incredible abilities!”

Feng Luan was shocked. She raised her head and looked at the huge Kun in the sky. She frowned slightly.

This Dragon Palace was simply too mysterious.

Wang Xian did not disturb her. He called Prime Minister Gui over and began to settle some matters.
