Kill them!

When Wang Xian’s voice rang out, the two ferocious beasts beside him immediately moved.

At this moment, a terrifying aura was emitted from the bodies of the two ferocious beasts.

That was the terrifying aura of an insightful emptiness realm expert.

Exploding Purple Lightning!

The terrifying bloody aura!

“Roar Roar!”

“Roar Roar!”

Ling Zilin and the blood evil turtle roared in a deep voice, and their figures instantly disappeared. Their icy cold eyes stared intently at the profound void tier expert from the nine Star dynasty.

“Boom Boom!”

The figures of the two beasts disappeared, and they charged over with terrifying pressure.

The instant they charged towards the profound void tier expert, the purple lightning from Ling Zilin’s purple lightning struck everyone from the nine Star Dynasty.

“Crackle!”

The purple lightning contained a terrifying killing intent.

In an instant, the people surrounding them, including the half-step void interpretation expert, were charred black.

They didn’t even have the time to resist. They didn’t even let out a scream and were instantly killed.

This was the terror of the Void Interpretation Beasts.

“What?”

The moment the two beasts attacked, the nine Star Dynasty’s void interpretation expert revealed a terrifying expression. His expression changed, and his forehead was covered in cold sweat.

Two insightful void tier one beasts, he actually had two insightful void tier one beasts! Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“This, this...”

Standing behind the insightful void tier expert, Jiuquan Liang’s body instantly became incomparably cold, as if he had entered an ice cellar.

He widened his eyes, staring at the two beasts in front of him in disbelief.

“No... no... how could this be, how could...”

He shook his head, his body trembling.

“Two rank one void interpretation beasts, two rank one void interpretation beasts!”

The other five young men and women were also filled with fear.

“Ah!”

The Nine Star dynasty void interpretation expert who was locked onto by the two void interpretation beasts gritted his teeth and a golden blade appeared in his hand and slashed at them.

“Boom!”

A terrifying sound of collision sounded. However, the attacks of the nine Star dynasty void interpretation expert didn’t stop the attacks of the two beasts.

Ling Zilin’s strength was already at the peak of the first level of the insightful void stage.

As for the other blood evil turtle, it had lived in the Blood Spirit Cave for two to three thousand years.

When Wang Xian encountered it, it was extremely weak. However, after a few days of recovery, it had already returned to its peak.

Just by relying on the accumulation of time, the blood evil turtle was already at the peak of its bloodline.

Two ferocious beasts at the peak of the first level of the insightful void stage could definitely suppress an ordinary expert at the first level of the insightful void stage.

“Oh no, escape! Otherwise, I’ll die here!”

The void interpretation stage expert from the nine Star dynasty was filled with fear as his eyes flashed. He wanted to think of a way to escape.

“Roar!”

However, at this moment, earthen yellow walls that were 1,000 meters wide suddenly appeared in all directions.

These earthen yellow walls completely sealed the surroundings.

“F * ck, quickly, quickly retreat!”

“It’s the blood evil turtle’s avatar. The Earth is sealed, and it used its avatar the moment it appeared. It wants to kill the nine Star Dynasty’s void interpretation realm experts!”

“Two level 1 void interpretation realm beasts. My God, that youth actually has two level 1 void interpretation realm pets. This is too terrifying!”

“F * ck, the reversal is too fast. That youth already has extremely terrifying strength. Just now, this group of people actually decided this person’s life and death. What a joke!”

“This nine Star dynasty didn’t just kick an iron plate, it kicked an iron plate. It might as well directly kill that fatty young man and get it over with. Now, it’s going to be even worse!”

When the surrounding crowd saw the earthen yellow wall that was suspended in a radius of two kilometers, a shocked expression appeared on their faces.

Some people hurriedly fled into the distance, while others flew into the sky to watch the battle inside.

“Not good!”

The nine Star Dynasty’s insightful emptiness realm expert’s expression was extremely gloomy, and a trace of panic appeared in his eyes.

“How, how could it be...”

Yin Xianfeng, who was at the eighth Prince’s and the others’position, saw this scene. His eyes widened, and his expression was filled with disbelief.

He clenched his teeth tightly, and his fists were clenched tightly.

How could that fellow, who was certain to die, have two first level insightful emptiness realm beasts as pets.

He could not believe it. He could not believe it at all!

The eighth Prince, who was standing at the front, was also in a daze. He stared at the two ferocious beasts in a daze.

“Haha, Haha. Eighth brother, do you think that brother Wang Xian is my subordinate? Do you think that you have won this game?”

At this moment, Long Xiaotian could not help but burst into laughter when he saw the eighth prince and the expressions of the people behind him.

When the eighth Prince heard his laughter, he turned his head around with a gloomy face.

“Eighth brother, brother Wang Xian is not my subordinate. I don’t have the qualifications to take in such a subordinate. His strength is not inferior to yours or mine!”

Long Xiaotian stared at him and revealed a smile on his face. “With brother Wang Xian’s strength, he doesn’t need my help at all. You are simply courting death by using him to gamble with me!”

When the eighth Prince Heard Long Xiaotian’s words, his expression changed constantly.

“Damn it, damn it, damn it!”

From behind, Yin Xianfeng’s continuous low growls made him extremely frustrated.

He clenched his fists tightly and watched the battle in the sky with a gloomy face.

Crackle! Crackle

The terrifying lightning struck toward the nine star Empire’s insightful void martial artist. In the sky, an area of two kilometers was completely covered by the purple lightning.

In the midst of the Lightning, there were also terrifying earth spikes and earth mountains that attacked him from time to time.

He was trapped in the virtual image land and could not escape at all. Now that he was facing the attacks of two top-grade insightful emptiness realm level one ferocious beasts, he was completely suppressed.

In fact, he did not even have the strength to resist. He could only resist and resist.

“Eighth prince, he won’t be able to hold on for long. He will die!”

The middle-aged man standing next to the eighth prince frowned and said to Wang Xian.

“Phew, I didn’t expect that. I didn’t expect that he would befriend such a young man!”

The eighth Prince felt a lump in his chest.

The second prince was stronger than him to begin with. Now that he had befriended such a young man, even though he wasn’t his subordinate, he could still be of great help.

Under such circumstances, the second Prince’s strength would be even stronger.

“Ah!”

Right at this moment, the sound of that insightful void martial artist screaming in pain came from the sky.

His chest had been struck by the Purple Lightning, and it had turned completely black. His hair had spread out, and half of it had been struck by the Lightning.

His entire person looked incomparably miserable.

Within a short period of time, he had already suffered heavy injuries.

“I’ll fight it out with you!”

His eyes were filled with a trace of despair as he struggled. The long saber in his hand shook, and a ten meter long golden saber appeared around him.

Dharma Idol: Golden Saber Huan Yu!

“Roar Roar!”

When Ling Zilin saw his dharma idol, his front hooves slightly raised as he lightly stepped in the air, emitting a terrifying sound.
