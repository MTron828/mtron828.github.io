Translator: 5496903

“F * ck, give me some strength. Didn’t you eat?”

In the pavilion, the third Prince felt the strength coming from his shoulder and shouted angrily.

“Yes, yes, it’s young master!”

Qing Lian, who had a perfect figure standing behind him, quickly nodded and replied.

“Young master, what do you want to eat?”

The middle-aged man beside him asked softly.

“Ask them to bring all the delicious food here!”

The third Prince said impatiently.

“Yes, yes, I’ll ask them to bring the food here immediately!”

The middle-aged man behind him quickly walked to the back.

The surrounding people glanced at the third prince with a surprised expression.

What kind of identity did this young man have to make Qinglian fawn over him so much?

Even a powerhouse was following him so carefully?

In less than two minutes, all kinds of dishes were served. The third prince sat there and looked at the table full of dishes. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Young master, let me feed you!”

Qinglian said in a very humble and gentle voice. She picked up a piece of meat with her chopsticks and handed it to the third prince.

“Did I say I want to eat this? Get out of my sight!”

The third prince looked at the food in front of him and felt a wave of impatience. He stretched out his leg and kicked Qing Lian.

“Ah!”

How could a woman like Qing Lian withstand a kick from a transcendent-level 8 powerhouse.

Even if he did not exert any strength, Qing Lian still fell backward. Her right leg made a cracking sound.

Obviously, one of her legs was broken.

“What!”

When the surrounding young men saw this scene, their faces were filled with anger.

This guy actually hit the goddess of Bright Moon City!

Even some of the girls around were filled with anger. A man hitting a woman made all the girls extremely angry.

However, after witnessing the strength of the middle-aged man beside the young man and their unbridled behavior, no one dared to speak.

Buzz Buzz

Wang Xian and Feng Luan looked at this scene coldly and didn’t speak. At this moment, a message suddenly came from his communication stone plate.

When Wang Xian took it out and read the message, his face instantly turned cold.

Something happened!

Just as Feng Luan expected, something happened at Dragon Spike!

Even though Wang Xian had already prepared the Dragonmen and the rest, something still happened.

“Dragon Spike, let’s see how long you can hide. You guys aren’t going to play until the end, right? Haha, Alright, Alright. I, the Master of Undercurrent, will play until the end. Even if it’s a year, two years, five years, or even ten years, I will play with you guys. Haha!”

Boom! Boom! Boom

At this moment, a cold roar suddenly sounded in the sky. This roar came from at least tens of kilometers away.

When Wang Xian heard this voice, his expression changed slightly and slowly sank.

At this moment, at the eastern area of Bright Moon City, the long-haired master of undercurrent stood up. His eyes were suffused with a blood-red glow. Around him, a blood fog pervaded the air.

That was the body of the four dragon thorns. Now, under the terrifying attacks of the insightful void martial artist, it had turned into a blood fog.

He floated in the air, his body emitting a crazy aura.

At this moment, the citizens of Bright Moon city below were completely stunned. They looked at the figure of the master of undercurrent with a face full of shock.

“Madman, he is indeed a madman. Some people said that the master of undercurrent is a madman who is as bloodthirsty as his life. Now, it seems that this is indeed the case!”

“I didn’t expect, I really didn’t expect that after two days of silence, the master of undercurrent would once again make such a crazy move!”

“The master of undercurrent is simply too crazy. This is the result of him wanting to fight the dragon Spike assassination organization to the death. This time, he killed five people from the dragon spike. If this goes on for a long time, the dragon Spike won’t be able to withstand it!”

“The dragon spike probably wouldn’t have thought that they would actually provoke such a troublesome and terrifying enemy!”

“A long time ago, someone said that the master of undercurrent is a complete lunatic. It seems that the rumors are true. I’ll accompany him to the end. Even if it’s five or ten years, this time, even if the dragon spike isn’t weak, it will still be much more troublesome!”

All the citizens of Bright Moon City looked at this scene in shock.

Compared to dragon Spike’s face slapping on the forum, the master of Undercurrent’s actions were even more violent. He directly caught the person who dragon spike was, and in front of everyone, he exploded on the spot.

This cruel, bloody, and bloodthirsty action was undoubtedly much crazier than dragon Spike’s face slapping.

Even if dragon spike was very strong, with such an enemy, he would still be unable to sleep or eat in peace.

This was too crazy!

With the disappearance of the leader of undercurrent, everyone in Bright Moon City knew that the battle between the dragon Spike and the undercurrent wasn’t over yet.

“It’s very difficult for the dragon spike to win against a madman. At most, both parties would suffer heavy losses!”

“It’s the unwise choice to make an enemy out of such a crazy person. The dragon Spike is going to be unlucky!”

Some people thought to themselves.

...

In Tingxie Lake, Feng Luan heard this voice and frowned slightly. She looked at Wang Xian, who had a gloomy expression.

“Meow!”

The ice fire civet cat sensed Wang Xian’s gloomy mood and let out a meow. It jumped from Feng Luan’s body to his side and stuck out its tongue to lick him!

“Huh?”

At this moment, the third prince, who was eating, frowned when he heard a meow.

He immediately turned around and stared at the ice fire civet cat in front of Wang Xian.

However, the ice fire civet cat was exactly the same as an ordinary cat. It was impossible to tell that it was a powerful demonic beast cub.

“Meow!”

The fire and ice civet cat saw that he was staring at him with an unfriendly gaze and glared at him fiercely.

“Beast!”

When the third prince saw the fire and ice civet cat’s appearance and thought of the missing fire and ice civet cub, he roared with a slightly malevolent expression.

His call of “Beast”caused everyone around him to be slightly stunned.

“Xing Yi, bring this little beast to the kitchen and serve it as a dish!”

The third prince pointed at the fire and ice civet cat and said to the middle-aged man beside him.

“Yes, yes, yes, Young Master!”

The middle-aged man was stunned for a moment. He sighed in his heart. He knew that the fire and ice civet cat had lost its rationality after missing its cub.

Now, it was extremely furious when it saw the cat.

“You actually want to eat such a cute kitten!”

Before Wang Xian and Feng Luan could react, a girl sitting at the side said with a furious expression.

She hit a woman and ate such a cute kitten. This girl couldn’t take it anymore.

“Shut up!”

The third Prince looked at her with his cold eyes.

“Peng, don’t be too arrogant. I know you’re strong, but this is bright moon city. You Can’t be so unbridled!”

The young man sitting across from the girl saw his lover being berated and stood up angrily.

“That’s right, this is bright moon city. It’s not a place where you can be arrogant. Don’t think that just because you have some strength, you dare to be unbridled here. You have no respect for the law!”

“That’s right. Bright Moon City isn’t a place where you can do whatever you want!”

After the young man finished speaking, a few more people spoke up.

They had offended the crowd!

They had beaten and scolded the beauty who ranked first on the beauty list of Bright Moon City!

And now, they were going to eat another cute kitten!

They directly scolded the others when they spoke rudely!

His actions had undoubtedly angered everyone around him. No one who could come to Tingxie Lake had a weak status.

If it weren’t for the powerful middle-aged man beside him, they wouldn’t have been able to hold themselves back from attacking long ago!

However, his actions had infuriated everyone around him. They stood up and criticized him.

Wang Xian looked at the third prince with a cold glint in his eyes.

Back in the city of beasts, the third prince had wanted to snatch the frost fire civet cubs and was even injured under his attack.

Now, he was so arrogant and even wanted to turn the frost fire civet cubs into vegetables!

Wang Xian lowered his head slowly. A hint of madness flashed in his eyes.

The undercurrent master is crazy?

Let’s see who is crazier!
