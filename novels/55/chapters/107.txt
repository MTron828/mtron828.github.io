Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

Hehe!

Wang Xian looked at the young man and shook his head. He found it a little hilarious and commented, “Love in school is simpler!”

“Simpler? Brother, I wouldn’t call that simpler. It’s brainless! Tell me, if we confessed at the same time to the same girl, who do you think the girl would accept?”

The young man replied in contempt, “You are still a far cry from me. However, there’s nothing you could do about it as you were born with it. Your looks are still alright and you are still better than ordinary students.”

He added this with a faint sense of superiority. He took out his phone to play and no longer paid attention to Wang Xian.

Wang Xian looked at the young man and wasn’t fond of him. However, he did not take his words to heart and simply waited there.

11.50 am, the bell that signaled the end of the lesson rang. Students walked out of the classrooms one after another.

Some students who had just walked out immediately saw the Audi R8 sports car by the classroom block.

“Wow, a sports car! It’s an Audi R8!”

“What a stunning sports car. It would be great if I could get a sports car in my lifetime!”

“That guy has a bouquet of flowers in his hand. It seems like he’s here to make a confession!”

“Isn’t he the third-year Senior, Liu Feng? I’ve heard that his family is filthy rich and that he always drives his sports car to school. I wonder who he is confessing to today!”

“That girl would be so lucky. If only I was her.”

Some students looked at the young man beside the sports car and started commenting. Many students looked towards him with eyes of envy.

A rich family, drives a sports car, and good-looking!

A guy like him is the envy of all men and the dream guy for all girls.

Hearing the comments from the surrounding students, Liu Feng revealed a satisfied smile.

He took a glance at Wang Xian, lifted his head proudly and kept one of his hands in his pocket.

More and more students walked out of their classrooms.

Some students had no intention to leave the area, as they would like to see who that lucky girl would be.

“She’s here!”

At this moment, Liu Feng took out his hand from his pocket and had his eyes locked in front of him. His eyes sparkled with joy.

Guan Shuqing’s lesson had ended and she was carrying a bag. She tip-toed as she looked around her.

When she saw Wang Xian, she walked over excitedly.

Wang Xian also spotted Guan Shuqing as he extended his hand and waved at her.

“Shuqing!”

Just as Wang Xian was about to walk over, he suddenly saw the young man walk directly towards Guan Shuqing.

Guan Shuqing was clearly taken aback as she looked at the young man in shock. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Shuqing, from the very first time I saw you, I’ve fallen in love with you. Today, I’ve finally mustered the courage to confess to you!”

Liu Feng suddenly went down on one knee. He handed the fresh flowers towards Guan Shuqing and spoke with sincerity.

“Wow, who would have expected that the one he is confessing to would be Guan Shuqing!”

“Oh, Guan Shuqing! She’s one of the five goddesses of our University of Rivertown. She has a great disposition, a good figure and a great character.”

“Liu Feng isn’t bad either, and is pretty handsome. I believe Guan Shuqing might accept him!”

“Liu Feng is so rich and even drives a sports car. I guess Guan Shuqing will most likely accept him. Oh my goodness. Could it be that a beautiful girl like her is going to be attached?”

There were over a hundred students that had gathered. Some of them even took out their mobile phones to take pictures and videos.

“Shuqing, would you be my girlfriend? In front of over a hundred students, I promise that I will treat you well forever. I’ll love you and protect you!”

Liu Feng said loudly, “I’ll get you whatever you want. If you want a sports car, I’ll give one to you. If you want a bag, I’ll get you the best out there!”

Extravagant! And a confession fully associated with materialism.

A sports car that costs over $2 million by the side, a handsome Liu Feng and a sincere confession.

Many girls around them were looking on in anticipation. If only they were the female protagonist, how great would it be! What a shame!

“A matching couple! Say yes!”

At this moment, a girl shouted loudly.

“Say yes, say yes!”

Following this, seven to eight other students joined in with the chanting.

Guan Shuqing, who was in the midst of this, looked at Liu Feng in shock. She had not expected him to confess to her all of a sudden. Moreover, he did it under Wang Xian’s attention.

This made Guan Shuqing frown, and she replied directly, “I don’t like you. Please don’t disturb me.”

After completing her sentence, she walked directly towards Wang Xian.

“I’m sorry, Xiao Xian. I don’t know him well and had not expected him to confess to me all of a sudden. Please don’t take it the wrong way!” Guan Shuqing quickly explained to Wang Xian.

“It’s alright. Let’s go get lunch!”

Wang Xian smiled and didn’t take it to heart. Considering that Guan Shuqing was so beautiful, having people confessing to her wouldn’t be uncommon.

What was different was that this young man did it in a more high-profile manner.

And at this moment, Liu Feng, who was still on his knee, was completely shocked. His eyes opened wide in disbelief as he turned his head around.

He saw that the girl he just confessed to was walking towards the school canteen with that teenager he saw previously.

The surrounding students were also shocked by the development.

“What the... Guan Shuqing just went for lunch with another guy.”

“Is that Guan Shuqing’s boyfriend? Why didn’t I hear about it previously?”

“Liu Feng was rejected. He was actually rejected! He drives a sports car and had a bouquet of fresh flowers in his hand. Yet, Guan Shuqing didn’t even take a further look at him and even went for lunch with another guy!”

“Shocking news! It looks like Guan Shuqing likes that guy. What the... WHY? Who’s that guy?”

“It must be really embarrassing for Liu Feng. It isn’t embarrassing to be rejected by Guan Shuqing but to see Guan Shuqing go to the canteen with another guy for lunch must be heart-breaking!”

The surrounding students were discussing fervently. No one had expected this to end in such a way.

Listening to the comments of the crowd and seeing Guan Shuqing’s back view, his face was red from embarrassment.

Recalling what he’d said to the young man previously, a surge of heat flooded to his face.

“Damn!”

Liu Feng stood up angrily and threw the bouquet of flowers in his hand into the rubbish bin by the side.

Under the mocking eyes of the surrounding students, he drove off.

This time, he had really embarrassed himself badly.

“If this incident is posted to the school forum, it will definitely cause a huge hoo-haa!” some students who were filming previously exclaimed.

“Haha, I’ve already uploaded it to the school forum. Things are going to get interesting.”

Wang Xian didn’t know that he was about to get really famous.

A simple love while in University and having lunch with Guan Shuqing alone at the school canteen made him feel really comfortable.

The lunch lasted for half an hour and the couple walked around the school campus for another half an hour.

What they didn’t know was that within the school forum, the incident that had happened in the afternoon had been spreading like wildfire.

Afternoon. Just as Wang Xian entered the dormitory room, three pairs of eyes that were filled with jealousy stared fervently at him.

“Old Wang, you are finally here. There’s no wonder why they called you Old Wang!”

Wang Xian looked at them in shock and joked, “What are you guys doing?”

“Old Wang. No, it should be Brother Xian! Take a look at the school forum quickly! You are famous now!”
