Chapter 387: Center Of Attention (1)

Boom!

When the thread appeared, the entire Underworld was overwhelmed by the sanction coming from the Sacred Enforcer and the response from the Sacred Followers Guild.

Every Sacred Sect had a law enforcement department to deal with some external underworld matters.

In another way, to exhibit the mightiness of a Sacred Sect.

Sacred Enforcer was the law enforcement department of the Sacred Followers Guild, targeting any clans and families who were going against the Sacred Followers Guild.

As the only law enforcement team of the Sacred Followers Guild, they had extreme powers.

The entire team was comprised of four Inborn Experts. If they faced stronger opponents, they could send out the elders of the Sacred Followers Guild.

Among all the Sacred Sects, the Sacred Followers Guild was the only sect that was formed by allying ties. Their Guild Leader was the number one most powerful existence on the Miracle Doctors Chart.

The rest who joined were either formidable Miracle Doctors or experts who received kindness from some of the Miracle Doctors.

The elder team of the Sacred Followers Guild had a strong presence as well. Each of them possessed a strength that was Inborn and above. On top of that, they had impressive connections.

The Sacred Sect that was formed by the various Miracle Doctors was ranked at number six among nine other Sacred Sects. They were just short of some foundations.

But even so, a Sacred Sect is, after all, a Sacred Sect.

Not many people could withstand a killing order or a sanction from a Sacred Sect.

Even as mighty as the assassin organization, the Dark Conjurers, was, they could only hole up when the Sacred Sect issued a killing order to get rid of them.

Not to mention, it was an assassin organization that was good at hiding. Now, it was only a factionless doctor, regardless of the fact that he was known as the demon-like genius now.

Everyone hurriedly clicked on the thread. Under the thread title, there were a few words: The dead body shall be revealed.

Everyone in the Underworld was stunned and shocked.

[Looks like the Sacred Followers Guild is utterly outraged. They gave a response immediately on the Underworld website that night, announcing that they would be revealing the dead body. That was an explicit announcement, telling everyone that they are going to kill Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown.]

[Now that the Sacred Enforcer team has made their move, I bet they are rushing down to Rivertown tomorrow. This time, there should be six to seven Inborn Experts or even more!]

[He’s doomed. Not many people can survive the killing order from Sacred Sects unless Miracle Doctor Wang of Rivertown decides to go on hiding without Sacred Followers Guild finding out!]

[Could this rare demon-like genius get punished by the Sacred Followers Guild? But thinking of it, that’s the price he needs to pay for killing an elder of the Sacred Followers Guild!]

Some of them from the Underworld website sighed after they saw the thread published by the Sacred Followers Guild in which their response did not come as a surprise to them. As a Sacred Sect, it was normal for them to take revenge for killing one of their elders.

Despite the fact that the other party was equally strong with demon-like talents.

Compared to those who analyzed objectively, there were more people who were gloating at the misfortune or even beginning to sneer at Wang Xian.

[Sacred Enforcers fight anyone brazen. After Wang Xian, there will be others!]

[Who asked you to be insolent. I bet you’re shocked now. Haha. What demon-like genius? How dare you play punk. Now, you’re getting punished!]

[Anyone going to Rivertown tomorrow? Let’s watch the demon-like genius getting himself killed, and we can take a photo too. Haha!]

[All the geniuses in the world who have not grown up are all trash! Only when you’re a grown-up can you call yourself a genius. So what if you’re a demon-like genius? You’re getting punished anyway!]

Many Martial Artists in the Underworld jeered at it. A 20-year-old demon-like existence had attracted much jealousy. Now that he was going to be punished, they were all excited.

Rejoicing in other people’s misfortune.

Many people were getting ready to make a trip to Rivertown to watch how the demon-like genius get himself killed.

It was more exciting to watch with their own eyes.

So what if you’re a demon-like genius? You’re going to get killed.

The entire Underworld was bustling at night.

At the break of dawn, the weather was gloomy. With Rivertown in the rainy season, the sky was grey, and the rain was going to fall.

“Young Master, here’s the announcement from Underworld.”

Mo Qinglong was looking cold as he walked over when Wang Xian was carrying Xiao Yu and Elder Fang to the roof in the morning.

“What did it say?”

When Wang Xian saw him, he poured himself a cup of tea and walked towards the yard, gazing at Xiao Ran who was cultivating.

“Sacred Followers Guild announced on the website that they will be punishing you to avenge the elder of Sacred Followers Guild,” said Mo Qinglong.

“Hur?”

Wang Xian froze for a moment and looked at Mo Qinglong. He raised his eyebrow and squinted his eyes. “Are they going to punish me?”

“Young Master, this was the announcement released by Sacred Followers Guild yesterday!”

As Mo Qinglong spoke, he handed his phone over.

“Sacred Enforcer is the department in Sacred Followers Guild that deals with external affairs. They are formidable and represent the entire Sacred Sect.”

“Hehe!” Wang Xian read the message on the phone with a smile on his face. “I was going to look for them. I did not expect they would come looking for me!”

“Now the four Inborn-levels Dragonians are at the villa by the side. So is Mo Yuan.”

A trace of murderous intent flashed in Mo Qinglong’s eyes.

“No matter the number of people who turn up or who they are...”

“Leave no one alive!”

Wang Xian handed the phone back to Mo Qinglong with coldness in his eyes as he watched Xiao Ran practicing.

Currently Xiao Ran was already in Martial Artist Level 9. It would be slightly challenging to attain a breakthrough to Half-step to Inborn.

Perhaps he would take a few years and probably another ten or so for the Inborn level. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Of course, that was under the circumstance that he did not take any Spiritual Grass or elixir pills. If he had sufficient elixir pills as supplements, he could make a breakthrough to Inborn Realm within a short time.

As for the killing order of Sacred Followers Guild, Wang Xian did not take it to heart at all. He was resting in his villa, enjoying his leisure time. While doing so, a group of strangers stormed into Rivertown.

About seven or eight luxurious black Audi cars drove in from another province with middle-aged men and some elders sitting inside.

Beside them were all the razor-sharp weapons, exuding formidable mightiness.

All of them were in black uniforms with “Sacred Followers Guild” words in the middle of their shirts.

The two cars that were driving at the forefront held all the elders.

Each one of them gave off a vibe of a supreme leader.

As the eight cars steered towards the sea, their target was the Supreme Seas Development Zone.

Apart from the eight unified Audi cars, there were also dozens of cars driving towards the Supreme Seas Development Zone too.

All the young men were sitting within the luxurious sports cars, driving at an extreme speed.

Vroom!

As the vrooming sound was heard, all the sports cars were already parked at the entrance of the Supreme Seas Development Zone.

Apart from those sports cars, there were some SUVs, totaling to more than thirty luxurious vehicles.

All the dashing young men stepped out from those cars one by one.

Some of them had babes in their arms as they smiled from ear to ear, while some of them were simply thrilled.
