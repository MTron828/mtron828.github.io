Chapter 1528: Son of Light 1528? Go

“The art of saving the world, benevolence and benevolence!”

On the afternoon of the eighth day, Wang Xian looked at the plaque hanging in the room and smiled.

“Pastor Wang, this is a gift from the people who have been healed by you!”

Old Hu pointed at the items under the plaque and said to him.

“Okay!”

Wang Xian nodded his head and walked over to pick up a box on the table.

“Eh?”

When he opened the box, he saw a bright pearl inside and was astonished.

A bright pearl of the third level of the void interpretation stage was not cheap. Those people were really thoughtful.

“Don’t let them send gifts in the future. I’ll accept these items!”

Wang Xian said to Old Hu.

“Alright!”

Old Hu nodded.

“Sir, I’m Here!”

At this moment, a young man walked in respectfully and shouted.

“Come over, I’ll Show You Again!”

Wang Xian said to the young man. The young man walked up to him and sized up the darkness soul in the young man’s body.

For eight days, Wang Xian hadn’t thought of a way to get rid of this darkness soul.

Once a powerful light force entered his body, it would cause the darkness soul to resist. If things went wrong, the young man’s life would be lost.

Under the corrosion of the darkness soul, if he could suppress it, no one else could save him.

Even the old ancestor of the Divine Light Empire could only deal with the extremely weak darkness soul. He couldn’t even deal with the Young Man’s darkness soul.

One could imagine how terrifying the Darkness Soul was.

The young man stood there respectfully. He wasn’t the least bit dissatisfied with priest Wang’s unmoving gaze. On the contrary, he was extremely grateful.

It was already an honor for a powerful priest of light to be willing to waste his time on him.

He also knew how terrifying the Darkness Soul was.

Suddenly, Wang Xian looked at the luminous pearl in his hand. His eyes flickered and emitted a faint luster.

He narrowed his eyes slightly. Suddenly, he had a faint idea.

The Soul of darkness was similar to the Dragon Pearl.

The nurtured Dragon Pearl could transform into a divine dragon to fight.

The Dragon Pearl didn’t need to be controlled to be able to fight. In essence, it was similar to the soul of darkness.

“Using the Dragon Pearl to destroy the Soul of Darkness?”

“This method shouldn’t be a problem!”

Wang Xian stood up slowly. A faint smile appeared on his face. “Go back first. Look for me in ten days. By then, I have 80% confidence!”

“It’s Reverend Wang!”

The young man raised his head. His eyes were filled with hope and excitement. He nodded immediately.

“Reverend Wang, you... you really have the confidence to solve it?”

Old Hu asked with a shocked expression.

“There is no darkness that can’t be solved. I should be able to solve it in ten days!”

Wang Xian revealed a confident expression.

This made Old Hu’s expression change.

Wang Xian opened his interspatial ring and searched around. He found a luminous pearl.

It was a luminous pearl of the eighth level of the void interpretation stage. Its level was much higher than the ones given by the patients.

Wang Xian looked at the pearl of light and placed it into his mouth slowly. He walked to the balcony and began to nurture it with all his might.

After ten days, the pearl of light would be able to transform into the pearl of light and give birth to a sliver of intelligence.

Time passed slowly. During the day, Wang Xian was still treating all kinds of patients every day and nurturing the pearl of light at night. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

As the number of people he treated increased, his reputation also became more and more famous.

He treated patients for free for more than ten days in a row!

He treated more than ten thousand people in total!

This selfless act touched many people.

At first, everyone thought that this was just the Holy Medicine Clinic’s publicity for the sake of reputation.

But what they didn’t expect was that it actually lasted for more than ten days.

This was definitely not for the sake of reputation, but because that Reverend Wang really treated patients selflessly.

Another ten days slowly passed, but the number of patients in front of the Holy Medicine Clinic did not decrease.

Many people who had heard of this from other places rushed over from thousands of miles away.

There were still seven to eight thousand people gathered at the entrance to treat patients.

In the surroundings, passersby looked over curiously and discussed animatedly.

“Oh? When we came, this holy medicine clinic was treating patients for free. Now, it’s actually still free. Moreover, there are so many people lining up?”

A luxurious carriage slowly drove on the road. A woman in the carriage looked outside in surprise.

“It’s true, and there are so many people outside!”

Another woman in the carriage also looked over in surprise.

“Your Highness, when you came here, it should be the first day. A young man was treated in the sacred medicine clinic for free, and more than a thousand patients are treated every day!”

“This priest Wang is very powerful. He is now known as the hanging urn salvation, benevolence, and benevolence. His evaluation is very high. He is quite famous among the priests of light!”

A woman said to the woman beside her.

“Hanging urn salvation, benevolence and benevolence? What a high evaluation!”

The woman in the middle showed a surprised expression. “I would like to meet this priest Wang. Aunt Feng, send him an invitation and say that I invited him to visit the Radiant Villa!”

“Eh? Sister Qingyan, could it be that you have taken a fancy to that priest Wang?”

“What nonsense are you talking about? Shut up immediately. I’m just curious who has such a broad mind!”

“Hehe, if this is an old man, would sister still invite him over for a visit? It’s all because he’s a young man. He might be a handsome guy!”

The two women were playing around inside.

In the Holy Medicine Clinic, Wang Xian stood in the room and stared at the young man with his eyes closed.

In front of Wang Xian, the Luminous Dragon Pearl was emitting an extremely strong light energy.

The entire room seemed to be in the midst of a dazzling white light.

Old Hu was guarding outside. Wang Xian stared at the Luminous Dragon Pearl and his mind moved slightly.

Buzz

In an instant, the white light that enveloped the surroundings dissipated instantly and was absorbed into the Dragon Pearl.

Wang Xian held the Dragon Pearl and exerted force with his arm. The entire Dragon Pearl turned into a stream of energy.

The energy slowly condensed into the form of the Divine Light Dragon and swayed its body.

He moved his palm gently and sliced open the young man’s stomach. The Divine Light Dragon entered his body directly.

The Divine Light Dragon belonged to a stream of energy that carried a trace of spiritual intelligence.

It was the same for the soul of darkness. There was no difference between the two.

“Since it possesses spiritual intelligence, it will know fear and know how to avoid danger!”

Wang Xian mumbled as he stared at the Divine Dragon of light.

The Divine Dragon of light swayed its body and charged directly at the soul of darkness.

Roar

At the same time, a wave of dragon’s might was emitted and suppressed the soul of darkness.

“Darkness!”

At this moment, Wang Xian, who was standing outside, extended his hand slowly.

At this moment, his palm had turned pitch-black. There were faint scales of the demonic dragon on it.

In an instant, a black shadow escaped toward his palm.

Wang Xian clenched his fist tightly and grabbed the soul of darkness into his hand.

Success!
