Chapter 513: Annihilating The Remains

“That place heads in the direction of the Fateless Forest. What’s the Dragon King intending to do, heading over with a group of Dragon Sect disciples?”

“The base of the Remains is located within the Fateless Forest. Don’t tell me he’s intending to form an alliance with the Remains?”

“That’s a tricky question. As of now, the Dragon Sect are enemies with the Donghua Sacred Sect. Who knows, the Dragon Sect might really just form an alliance with Diabolism!”

“What the...are you for real!”

As Ling City was really small, news of what happened in Ling Yue Bar soon spread across the entire city.

Many appeared shocked and suspicious at the sight of the Dragon King, as he followed three members from the Remains and headed for the Fateless Forest.

“Should the Dragon Sect really form an alliance with Diabolism, it’ll spell a huge disaster!”

Several Martial Artists shrieked with burdened expressions. They frowned at the sight of the group, whose silhouettes had disappeared into the darkness of the night.

Currently, the prowess of the Dragon Sect had been acknowledged by the Underworld as second amongst all forces.

The prowess of the Dragon King was known to be second amongst all individuals within the Underworld.

Should such an expert, from such powerful Sacred Sect, form an alliance with Diabolism, they would no doubt stand as a formidable opponent to the alliance of the orthodox sects!

I must disseminate this message! a Martial Artist thought to himself with his mobile phone in hand. As he looked at the photographs taken on his phone, he proceeded immediately to post it for the Underworld to see.

[The Dragon King of the Dragon Sect is in a suspected alliance with the Remains. Three experts from the Remains have led the Dragon King into the Fateless Forest. We, the alliance of the orthodox sects, will have to exercise caution!]

Upon the dissemination of the news, the entire Underworld was sent into a frenzy.

Today, the alliance of the orthodox sects had been officially formed, which the Dragon Sect had not joined. This had already caused the utter displeasure of many Martial Artists within the Underworld.

It only infuriated more, given that the Dragon King was also at extreme odds with the Donghua Sacred Sect.

The Dragon Sect was thus slapped with terms like “hindrance” and “evil sect.”

Yet, the entire Underworld was sent into an uproar following the release of this news.

An alliance between the Dragon Sect and the Remains? So the Dragon Sect has come together with Diabolism?

[To think that the Dragon Sect’s really combining forces with Diabolism!]

[What in the world...this damned Dragon Sect, and its darned Dragon King. To think they’re really forming an alliance with Diabolism!]

[Dammit, the power of the Dragon Sect is amongst the top within the Underworld. Should they form an alliance with Diabolism, it’ll spell a huge damn disaster!]

[It’s probably due to the enmity forged between Dragon Sect and Donghua Sacred Sect today, hence the former’s admission into Diabolism in order to stand against the Donghua Sacred Sect!]

[The Dragon Sect annihilated the Medical Saint Sect and Qiao Clan. Such a Sacred Sect is no different from Diabolism, hence they should be wiped out the soonest possible!]

After the post was uploaded, it sent the entire Underworld chiding and cursing away at the Dragon Sect.

Many Martial Artists were infuriated, as they boasted blatantly of wiping out the Dragon Sect being the priority.

Meanwhile, more than a dozen had gathered in a grand hall within the sacred grounds of the Donghua Sacred Sect which was located amidst the central regions of the country. Those who had gathered looked on with deep frowns and awful expressions.

Seated in the middle of those gathered was an Elder, as he glistened with a metallic sheen. It was especially so with his arms, which shone like titanium.

His hair was somewhat long, as it hung loosely scattered behind his head, while he exuded a unique aura that boasted no less dominance.

“The Dragon Sect and Dragon King. With regards to this, you guys have not handled this properly!” the Elder snapped with a low growl which resembled the impact made as one struck with a heavy weapon.

“Yes, indeed Sect Leader, this Dragon King’s too obnoxious. He wants to slay the Lord of Sea Serpent Island while remaining at loggerheads with Donghua Sacred Sect. We can’t do anything about it,” Nie Wuya replied in awe and fear while standing by the side. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Since we’re already nemeses with each other, then let’s just battle it out until either side perishes!” the Elder conceded with a flat tone as he raised his head.

He too was aware that the other party would never let things slide since they had become enemies. Not unless they, Donghua Sacred Sect, decided to bow down and admit their faults.

But to make the Donghua Sect bow their heads down was clearly not an easy feat. Hence, the only way out was to battle it out until one party perished.

“Now that the Dragon Sect is going to form an alliance with Diabolism, the entire alliance of the orthodox sects shall wait before removing those evils altogether when the day arrives!” Nie Wuya proclaimed indifferently at a side.

“Mm!” the Elder nodded in agreement before standing up and flying off towards the deeper ends of the mountains.

Nie Wuya watched as his Sect Leader took his leave before heaving a sigh of relief. His face was plastered with a grimace almost immediately thereafter.

“Darn this Dragon Sect and its Dragon King!” he cursed.

Five minutes later, across the online forum of the Underworld, the Donghua Sacred Sect made an announcement.

[The Dragon Sect and its Dragon King have pledged allegiance to Diabolism and become demons. The alliance of the orthodox sects shall annihilate them in the times to come!]

With the announcement of the Donghua Sacred Sect, it meant that the Dragon Sect had since been recognized as a part of Diabolism.

[Support Donghua Sacred Sect. Annihilate Diabolism and Dragon Sect!]

[Annihilate the Dragon Sect, for they’re traitors of the Underworld. And hopefully, slay the Dragon King the soonest possible!]

Countless Martial Artists commented below the announcement thread.

Experts of various Sacred Sects looked on with burdened expressions at the sight of the situation.

With the addition of the Dragon Sect onto the current task of eliminating Diabolism, it seemed likely that many were going to die.

The chat forum for the Underworld continued to buzz as everyone was busy discussing away about the admission of the Dragon King and his Dragon Sect into Diabolism.

In the meantime, Wang Xian had already arrived at a ghastly burial ground along with three experts from the Remains.

Fifty kilometers in front of the Fateless Forest, all trees had turned black. With their withering trunks, there was not a single leaf growing on their dry and bare branches.

Caw, caw!

A crow called out while resting atop a branch. With its jet-black body, it looked on with eyes that glistened in red.

At the sight of the quartet, the crow turned its crimson eyes upon them.

On the ground just up ahead, numerous broken bones were strewn all over, which consisted of both human and animal carcasses.

The entire area up front appeared eerie and harrowing.

“So, up ahead lies the hideout of you Remains?” Wang Xian asked as he squinted briefly, surveying the area ahead.

“Yes, that’s right, It’s just up ahead!”

The trio from the Remains nodded instantaneously as they gazed at the Remains’ base with a tinge of vigor in their eyes.

“If that’s the case, then you all can perish now!” Wang Xian said indifferently as he looked at them.

“What?” the trio uttered in bewilderment. Soon after, they noticed that the flames which had been surrounding them had begun to ascend.

The horrendous blazing flames raged on, lighting up everything which stood in their way.

“Ah... no! Didn’t you say...” the trio from the Remains uttered.

“In handling Diabolism, it’s only natural that I adopt the diabolical way!” Wang Xian sniggered without the least concern. With a swing of his arm, the blazing flames dived into the trio’s mouths and muted all their screams.

Bam, bam, bam!

The trio struggled with all their might, while Wang Xian retrieved an item from his pocket.

It was a skull, a black skull.

Although it was only the size of a fist, the skull brimmed in vitality.

[Nether Skull: Level 12]

The Nether Skull was a Spiritual Weapon which Wang Xian had obtained from Deity Lady of the Nether Flame Denomination.

Back then, this Nether Skull had released such formidable powers that even the Fire Demon had feared the trio.

This made the Nether Skull worthy as a Demonic Weapon, as they increase their powers by absorbing will-o-wisp.

What were will-o-wisps then? These were flames emitted from human bones after one died.

Hence, one can imagine the number of lives it had cost to refine this Nether Skull.

Even more so, as it ascended in levels, it would exhaust even larger amounts of will-o-wisp.

And while will-o-wisps were not categorized under the Heavenly Flame, they appeared more terrifying otherwise.

To subdue the Demons using the Demons!

Wang Xian smiled before thrusting the Nether Skull into the air above the three Remains disciples!
