Chapter 115: Known Throughout University of Rivertown (6)

[Nobody was expecting such an end. Xu Qingcheng bowed and apologized to Wang Xian, who was invited for sparring, even though they did not fight.]

[Even Coach Yan Hu said he was not a match for Wang Xian. He even made a respectful apology to him. How strong is Wang Xian?]

[How domineering is he! Did you see how Wang Xian leaped two meters high when he left the Taekwondo Club? He smashed the signboard with just a kick. That was an outright slap to their faces!]

[Xu Qingcheng shamed himself much this time. He and the entire Taekwondo Club’s members mocked Wang Xian just now. Now, they couldn’t even make a sound when Wang Xian smashed their signboard. What a shame!]

[Xu Qingcheng will have to avoid Wang Xian at all costs in the future.]

[Breaking opening with a dramatic ending. Naughty Xu Qingcheng challenged Wang Xian, but his father-like Coach Yan Hu slapped him awake and got him to apologize. How interesting!]

[I wonder how formidable Wang Xian is such that even Coach Yan Hu admitted that he was not a match. Moreover, from the way Wang Xian smashed the signboard when he left, I could tell that he’s superb!]

The school forum erupted into commotion again. Incidents involving Wang Xian had become more captivating in the last two days.

The thread that was posted by the member of the Taekwondo Club had more than ten thousand replies.

Since this incident involved Wang Xian and Xu Qingcheng, the Prince Charming, it was expected to draw all the students’ attention in the school.

“Power, Old Wang. You’re simply too domineering!” Wang Dahai said to Wang Xian with a face full of admiration when they were on their way.

Wang Xian had arrived at the Taekwondo Club and confronted everyone with composure. Even when he smashed the signboard with a kick, he looked incredibly cool.

“No wonder both Guan Shuqing and Lan Qingyue goddesses fancy you. I’m also beginning to like you, Old Wang.”

“Get lost, I have no interest in you!”

Wang Xian peered at him, “Continue to look for your Sister, Su Qian.”

“Hehe, there’s no need to since we’ve been keeping contact for the past two days. Now, you stirred such a commotion, I’m sure Su Qian will be curious and find out things from me.”

Wang Dahai spoke with some pride. He could sense love on its way.

Wang Xian shook his head without any words, “I will be busy for the next few days. Apply for leave from the counselor on my behalf. If you send beverages to Su Qian everyday, remember to give one to my sister too!”

“Leave? Old Wang, what are you busy with?” Wang Dahai was slightly stunned as he asked doubtfully.

“I have something to attend to. It should take about one or two weeks,” Wang Xian replied.

He was going to use these few days to search the entire Bohai Sea for any resources that could be tapped, like a sinking ship.

In addition, he also needed to proceed with the medical hall.

Wang Xian did not mind if this delayed his studies now.

The school was not important to him anymore. He would have dropped out of school if his sister did not report to school. So he had to keep her company for a while.

All he wanted to pursue was the starry sky and the ocean.

“All right, Old Wang. Don’t worry about your sister. Leave her in my hands.” Wang Dahai patted his chest. He understood that Wang Xian was now undergoing tremendous changes.

As a buddy, he did not probe further as long as his buddy was doing well.

“Get lost. What do you mean by leaving her in your hands? I’m just going away for a few days.”

Wang Dahai patted hard on Wang Dahai’s shoulder.

“Stop it, Old Wang. Stop it. You’re so formidable now. All my fault. My fault!”

Wang Dahai screamed immediately and briskly walked to the dormitory.

Wang Xian chuckled and followed behind him.

After four to five hours of propagation, almost all the students knew about the incident on the school forum.

When Wang Xian walked along the path in school in the afternoon, many people continued to point and gossip about him.

What made the difference was the curiosity and respect in the eyes of many. The sarcasm, disdain, and even jealousy in the looks was not as much as before.

Wang Xian came to the office to apply for a week’s leave from the counselor.

Wang Xian managed to do so after answering all the curious questions from the counselor.

He paused and took out his phone to send a message to Guan Shuqing and Lan Qingyue after he walked out of the office. He told both of them that he would be away for two days and he might be uncontactable.

“Guan Shuqing, Lan Qingyue!”

Wang Xian mumbled the two names and shook his head. If he had to choose either one of them now, he probably will pick Guan Shuqing.

These past few days, Guan Shuqing had been using her free time to settle some of the accounts of the First-grade Restaurant.

She was a girl who had no complaints about her work, and she was poor in expressing herself.

Wang Xian liked her because he felt comfortable with her.

Guan Shuqing was listening attentively to the teacher in her class.

When the phone buzzed, she froze slightly when she read Wang Xian’s message.

She knew what had happened during the past few days just like she knew that Wang Xian and Lan Qingyue went out for dinner.

Yet, she did not comment on anything, nor did she question him either.

Guan Shuqing felt that her silent effort would eventually pay off. That was her character, and she believed Wang Xian liked her.

[Take care, and let me know once you’re back] Guan Shuqing replied.

[Sure.]

Wang Xian felt a heart-warming feeling when he saw Guan Shuqing’s reply.

Buzz!

At the same time, his phone buzzed again with the arrival of Lan Qingyue’s message.

[Is there anything I can do to help? I’ve brought you enough troubles for the past two days.]

[No, I’m just gonna be busy for the next two days. Just letting you know beforehand as there might be no signal then.]

Lan Qingyue’s reply was totally different from Guan Shuqing’s. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Back at the office building in the city center, Lan Qingyue was sitting in front of her computer in her formal attire. She was frowning when she looked at Wang Xian’s message.

She knew what had happened during these two days in school.

“Was it me who made him feel irritated, hence he...”

Lan Qingyue was thinking a little too much. She bit her lips. “Blame it on those people who love to gossip in school.”

She took a deep breath and logged in to the school forum.

Since she was the vice-chairman of the student council, all the students knew her forum ID.

Create post:

[1. I hope everyone will stop discussing Xiao Xian and me.]

[2. Whatever that happened between Xiao Xian, Guan Shuqing and I is only between us. I hope no one will make any wild guesses or even slanderings.]

[3. Fair competition.]

After Lan Qingyue wrote three lines, she posted out immediately.

She was in a daze when she looked at the thread that was posted out.

She thought she should not have brought troubles to Wang Xian.

At the same time, she would not give up. Even though she might get hurt in the end, all she wanted was a fair competition!
