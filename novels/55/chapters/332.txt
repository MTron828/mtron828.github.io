Chapter 333: Holy Goddess

Wang Xian was now rich; in fact he was now a parvenu.

He was in a great mood, as he hugged onto the porcelain vase which held more than twenty billion dollars’ worth of Elixir Pills.

“In the next couple of days, I’ll have some rest, and cultivate my Spiritual Grasses.” Wang Xian grinned with satisfaction.

He took a look at the time and realized that it was past nine at night. In quick moves, he dashed for the villa.

As he arrived at the villa, Wang Xian saw Guan Shuqing, Xiao Yu, Elder Fang, Xiao Ran and his younger sister practicing swordplay together in the courtyard.

Sui Huang was lying at a side while giving guidance to those at practice.

Currently, Guan Shuqing and Xiao Yu had attained status as Half-step Inborns, which meant Elder Fang was no longer qualified to mentor Xiao Yu. While she may have been Sect Leader of the Thistles and Thorns Sect, Elder Fang’s prowess was still below a Half-step Inborn.

Rather than letting Elder Fang take her leave, Xiao Yu decided that she should stay on with her to practice cultivation.

Naturally, Wang Xian did not treat Elder Fang shabbily either, but gifted her with a continual supply of Spiritual Grasses and Spiritual Medicine.

Which had eventually helped Elder Fang to attain the status of Half-step Inborn that she was today.

As for Xiao Ran, his abilities were only that of a Level 8 Martial Artist. Nonetheless, it was a formidable feat considering that he was only in his early teens. Meanwhile, he was accompanied by his little sister, Liu Mengxin, who practiced with him. Having been accepted by Sun Lingxiu as an apprentice, Mengxin not only cultivated herself by practicing the Divine Dragon Transformation, but also the Art of Cultivation by Miracle Doctor Shenghua. Both of which were attributed to the Light Element.

“Brother!” Xiao Yu cheered.

“Xiao Xian!” Guan Shuqing called out.

“Master!” Xiao Ran greeted.

The group did not stop their practice even as they saw Wang Xian and gang approaching, but continued as they welcomed them with a beam. Wang Xian reciprocated with a smile while he stood in the courtyard and watched briefly.

“You guys continue practicing!” Sui Huang ordered while he continued to lie down on the bench, eyeing Wang Xian with slit eyes as he spoke.

“I’ve only taken in one disciple, yet I’m here guiding an entire group through their cultivation!” Sui Huang resigned himself to his fate, with his sighs obviously meant for Wang Xian.

“Formidable Sui Huang, a good master who’s so rare even in ten thousand years!” Wang Xian laughed as he headed towards his bedroom.

“Not the slightest sincerity in your compliment!” Sui Huang nagged before he continued to guide Guan Shuqing and the group.

Inside the villa, Sun Lingxiu was busy working away in the kitchen. Upon seeing her from the back, Wang Xian smiled as he passed by.

The current Sun Lingxiu was truly impeccable.

When dawn broke the following day, Wang Xian gazed at Guan Shuqing who was still in bed. She had gone back to sleep smirking after she managed to apply for leave.

As Wang Xian walked down the villa, a thought came to mind. I’ll take a look at the Divine Dragon Medical Hall! Wang Xian decided, before he hastened his pace over.

He had not been to the Divine Dragon Medical Hall even once since placing it under the care of Sun Lingxiu. But the latter had given him a card just the day before.

The card had held a value of more than two hundred million dollars, which were the takings of the Medical Hall for the past ten days.

This translates to more than twenty million dollars in daily takings, which was much higher than what he had seen during his days over there.

As Wang Xian arrived at the main entrance of the Divine Dragon Medical Hall, he was astonished by the sight before him.

It was just around ten in the morning, but more than twenty people had gathered at the main entrance.

It was a group clad in ordinary wear, consisting of both young and old, many of whom looked like villagers.

They were standing at the main entrance and queuing quietly, no one daring to create a ruckus.

Wang Xian was rather surprised but continued to head inside.

As he walked past the main entrance, he discovered that the interior had been flooded by people. The Miracle Doctor Blood Man was also inside, treating patients and giving consultations.

Several elderly people were lying on the sickbeds. With their shabby attire, it was clear that their conditions back home were less than ideal.

Wang Xian turned to look at the surrounding walls, only to discover that they were covered in all sorts of pennant flags.

On some of them were messages thanking Doctor Sun for her selfless dedication to helping and saving lives.

While others complimented her as “Female Miracle Doctor of Great Chinese,” as an expression of gratitude for her contributions.

Pennant flags of all varieties hung on the walls, covering them almost to the brim.

Wang Xian continued to look at the sides and realized that the rules which he had set previously had all been changed.

“To save the dying and aid the injured: Kind-hearted but poor patients shall receive treatment free-of-charge!” one of the rules read.

“Martial Artists of rich families will be charged no less than five million dollars for treatment!” another said.

“This is no doubt befitting of Sun Lingxiu’s character!” Wang Xian exclaimed as he saw the amended rules by the doors. He was not the least bit angry over the amendments but instead admired Sun Lingxiu for her benevolent nature.

Having witnessed many life and death situations, and getting accustomed to such partings in the hospital, she had seen for herself countless patients who were unable to afford treatment due to poverty.

Therefore, she chose to treat for free.

Which, of course, was meant solely for the impoverished, the kind but poor people.

All of whom would be placed under the care of Miracle Doctor Blood Man.

While he appeared to be a middle-aged man, Miracle Doctor Blood Man was in fact in his eighties and was able to determine people’s character through certain means, which meant no one could go undetermined.

That said, no one had dared to visit in disguise as a poor person, for the Miracle Doctor Blood Man was not a kind soul himself.

After some who had dared to risk it suffered as a result, none had made further attempts.

The first level was meant for treatment of the ordinary folks, while the second level was set aside by Sun Lingxiu for the treatment of the affluent Martial Artists.

With this, Wang Xian made his way up to the second floor.

Just as Wang Xian arrived at the second floor and was about to walk further inside, he was hauled to a stop.

“Hold it right there. Queue up if you’re here to seek treatment. Wait at the side,” the voice ordered him.

“Huh?” Wang Xian said in shock, as he looked to the side.

It was a young man who had called out to Wang Xian coldly, as he sat at the side with his head tilted slightly skywards.

Beside him were two other middle-aged men.

Aside from the trio, there were two other young men, each with a sword in hand. It was clear that they were from the underworld.

In spite of their air of arrogance, the three young men were very handsome-looking.

There were also two fresh flowers which lay beside side the young duo, looking really gorgeous.

“This? What’s with this situation?” Wang Xian questioned, slightly confused. He continued to walk inwards while brushing the young men aside.

“Don’t you know the rules here? Access is strictly prohibited when Miracle Doctor Sun’s attending to patients!” the young man who had called out to Wang Xian earlier scolded again when he saw that he was being ignored.

“Who are you?” Wang Xian asked indifferently as he eyed the young man.

“You’re not qualified to know who I am. Wait here if you’re seeking treatment. Otherwise, if you have designs on Doctor Sun, then scram!” the young man hollered at Wang Xian, taking a domineering stance.

“Here to court the Holy Goddess? Identify yourself, and we’ll decide. If you’re not qualified, then get out at once!” one from the young duo chipped in snobbishly as he raised his head.

Wang Xian found it a tad amusing as he looked at the three obnoxious young men.

Holy Goddess, huh? That must be the title meant for Sun Lingxiu.

“Given Sun Lingxiu’s beauty and elegance, ninety-nine out of a hundred men would be attracted. It’s only natural that she has suitors!” Wang Xian laughed as he continued making his way inside.

“Stop there. Didn’t you hear? Are you courting death?” the three young men threatened as their faces darkened when they saw Wang Xian’s dismissal.

As they stood up composedly, they fixed their focus on Wang Xian.

The two middle-aged men glared at Wang Xian with icy stares.

“Eh?” Sun Lingxiu frowned. She was treating a patient inside the consultation room when she heard the commotion outside. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Turning her head over, she looked on in surprise but walked over to Wang Xian with all smiles immediately after.

“Xiao Xian, what brings you here at this hour?” Sun Lingxiu beamed like a blooming flower, which was enough to make hearts flutter.

“I’m here to take a look!” Wang Xian smiled back in response.

“The three wastrel disciples outside haven’t been rude to you, have they?” Sun Lingxiu asked blatantly. As she walked to Wang Xian’s side, she swept her glance past the three young men.

“No, they haven’t. These three look rather professional, they’re pretty good!” Wang Xian evaluated with a laugh.

“Haha! I’ll make you tea!” Sun Lingxiu giggled. She hurried back into the room to retrieve the teacups and started brewing Wang Xian’s favorite Longjing Tea. [1]

“This ... This ...,” the three young men outside the room uttered as they stared at their goddess in astonishment.

“This ... How is this possible ... This can’t be, my goddess ...” Their voices trailed off.
