“If my father doesn’t recover after going through so many troubles, don’t blame me for being violent!”

A middle-aged man looked furiously at Doctor Sun and roared.

Doctor Sun frowned. “Sir, you have agreed to our sending him here.”

“If it wasn’t because of your recommendation, why would I send my father here? No matter what, let’s cure my father before speaking!” the middle-aged man said impatiently.

Doctor Sun did not pay attention to the middle-aged man and said to the group of nurses, “Come, carry the patient into the medical hall.”

“Alright, Doctor Sun!”

Four nurses placed an old man on a stretcher before walking into the medical hall.

“Place him on the bed!” Wang Xian said to the nurses, seeing them carrying a patient in.

He knew that this was a referral from the hospital.

“Where’re the attendants of the medical hall? Where’s the doctor? Why isn’t there any equipment around? Give my father the treatment right away!”

The middle-aged man followed into the medical hall, looking around and growling.

“Calm down. Since the hospital has sent the patient here, I’ll be able to cure him!”

Wang Xian frowned slightly as he spoke to the middle-aged man.

“Hurry over and start the treatment for my father then. We can’t afford any delay!”

“Hurry up! My father’s treatment has been delayed by over 10 hours. Even if he was fine previously, he won’t be now!”

The middle-aged and 30-plus-year-old man demanded impatiently.

Wang Xian frowned and walked slowly to the patient.

Doctor Sun walked to Wang Xian and asked with eyes of admiration, “Miracle Doctor Wang, the patient’s heart is failing and his situation is dire. What our hospital could do for such dire state patient is simply extending his life by a few days, but we are not able to cure him completely. Therefore, we have sought the intentions of his family members and sent him here. Do you have any solutions?”

“Let me take a look!” Wang Xian nodded his head as he stretched his hand over and placed it on the chest of the old man.

“You are the doctor? So young?”

At this moment, a few middle-aged and young men looked at Wang Xian in shock.

They had not expected the doctor of this medical hall to be a juvenile. Is he even reliable?

Wang Xian ignored them and did a sensing of the old man’s body. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Treatment wouldn’t be difficult.

“I can cure him.”

Wang Xian lifted his head as he spoke to Doctor Sun.

“Miracle Doctor Wang, you are so incredible!” Doctor Sun said in admiration.

Wang Xian smiled and looked to the middle-aged man. His lips curved into a smile and he said, “Your father’s illness is curable!”

“Really!” The middle-aged man was taken aback and a little shocked.

“Curable!” Wang Xian nodded his head.

“Can we kindly ask Doctor Wang to start treatment?”

The middle-aged man kept his temperament in check and squeezed out a smile.

“Hmm. Payment before treatment!” Wang Xian said plainly.

“I wouldn’t pay you any less. Hurry up and treat my father before we talk about this!” the middle-aged man replied unhappily.

Hehe!

Wang Xian looked at the middle-aged man and revealed a faint smile. He walked to the chair beside him and said, “$8 million for treatment. Once you’ve paid up, I can guarantee his recovery. If you don’t pay or not have the money, just bring him out!”

Wang Xian sat on the chair and poured himself a cup of tea.

“What? $8 million? Why don’t you just go and rob?” The middle-aged man was shocked by Wang Xian. He flared up and pointed his fingers furiously at Wang Xian.

“Initially, $2 million was enough for your father’s treatment. However, you have a bad attitude. It’s $8 million now. Pay up if you want treatment. Otherwise, scram!”

Wang Xian spoke coldly to the middle-aged man and the crowd.

“YOU...”

The middle-aged man and the few young men were enraged. They stared hideously at Wang Xian, “Brat, do you know who I am. I am giving you a warning right now. Treat my father immediately or I won’t be courteous with you!”

“Oh, hehe.”

Wang Xian looked at them with mocking eyes. “The price is $10 million now!”

“Brat, you must be courting death!”

Green veins lifted out of the middle-aged man’s arms as he walked towards Wang Xian.

“Sir, please calm down!” Seeing the enraged middle-aged man and crowd, Director Sun quickly interrupted.

“Scram. Your hospital must be thinking of robbing us!”

A young man shouted coldly at Director Sun.

“Brat, treat my father right away. Once he recovers, I’ll give you $2 million. Don’t test my patience!”

The middle-aged man walked to Wang Xian and looked down at him as he spoke solemnly.

He rolled up his sleeves and revealed his tattoos.

Wang Xian looked mockingly at the middle-aged man and said, “$15 million!”

“F*ck you...”

“Tsk. How dare you kick up a fuss in Divine Dragon Medical Hall!”

Just as the middle-aged man extended his arm and was grabbing towards Wang Xian’s arm, a cold shout sounded from outside the medical hall.

The middle-aged man paused and stared angrily at the entrance. However, when he saw the group of people at the entrance, his face stiffened up gradually.

The middle-aged man stared at the six people, dumbfounded. His body couldn’t help but shiver.

The head of the Ren Family, Hu Fei of the Hu Family, Old Xue, Xue Jing and Old Duan!

When his gaze met the head of the Ren Family, fear crept upon him.

Ren Family used to be the Number 1 Ancient Martial Artist Family in Rivertown before the Yan Family announced their return. The Ren Family had great strength and influence in the entire Rivertown.

Moreover, the head of the Ren Family was also the Director of an organization.

The middle-aged man had met him once when his father brought him to a banquet.

His father had warned him solemnly that the family head of the Ren Family could not be offended as he could annihilate them with just a wave of his hand.

His father had also briefed him a little about the situation of the Ancient Martial Arts circle in Rivertown. This petrified him.

He had never expected that there was such a horrifying group of people that still existed in the current era.

Why would the family head of Ren Family come to this medical hall? He’s the leader of the Number 2 Ancient Martial Artist Family in Rivertown! Fear crept up to the middle-aged man.

“You must be courting death!”

At this moment, the family head of the Ren Family moved his palm and two silverish beads shot towards the middle-aged man.

Argh.

All the middle-aged man could feel was intense pain on his knees as though they were broken. He couldn’t resist the pain and landed on his knees directly. Cold sweat broke out on his head!

“Big Brother!”

“Big Brother!”

The few young men ran towards the middle-aged man instinctively when they saw him going on his knees suddenly.

“I’m sorry, Ren Family Head, I’m sorry. If there’s something that I’ve done badly, I’ll definitely change!”

The middle-aged man ignored his brothers’ exclamations. He immediately begged for forgiveness from the Ren Family Head while enduring the intense pain of his legs.

He didn’t dare to have any sense of resistance of unhappiness.

“You must be looking for death to kick up a fuss in the Divine Dragon Medical Hall!”

Ren Family Head shouted coldly at the middle-aged man.

“I’m sorry, I’m sorry. Miracle Doctor, please forgive me this time!” The middle-aged man turned to face Wang Xian, kowtowed in a hurry and begged for Wang Xian’s forgiveness.

Wang Xian looked at the middle-aged man on his knees and shook his head in contempt. He was completely different from his arrogant self just a while ago!

“To cure your crippled legs, $5 million!”
