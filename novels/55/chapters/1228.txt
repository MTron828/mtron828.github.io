Chapter 1229: In terms of killing and humiliation

Translator: 5496903

The Light Dragon Dynasty was the strongest force in the entire Liuhai region apart from the blood flow empire.

There were only a handful of forces that could be compared to them.

As one of the princes that the king valued the most, if they wanted to touch him, it would undoubtedly be a slap to the face of the entire light dragon dynasty.

Especially during the selection of the crown prince, even long Xiaotian, who was the prince, didn’t dare to touch him.

Let alone others.

He did not know about Wang Xian’s background, but he firmly believed in the strength of his background.

Faced with Wang Xian’s words, his face was filled with disdain and a cold smile.

“What is that young man trying to do? Could he be targeting the eighth Prince?”

“I don’t think so. After all, he is the Prince of the Radiant Dragon Empire. If he dares to touch the eighth prince, the entire Radiant Dragon Empire will not let him off. No matter how strong he is, it’s useless!”

“He must be dissatisfied with the eighth Prince’s actions just now and wants to vent his anger!”

When the surrounding people saw what Wang Xian said, they were astonished. All of them stared at Wang Xian with flickering eyes.

“Brother Wang Xian, although my eighth brother is annoying, I really can’t touch him!”

Long Xiaotian frowned slightly and said to Wang Xian.

He was really afraid that Wang Xian would act on impulse.

Wang Xian took a glance at long Xiaotian and smiled. He turned his head to look at the eighth Prince again and patted the two ferocious beasts beside him.

His gaze turned cold as he said, “The Prince of the Guanglong dynasty is very powerful. Hehe, I can’t do anything to You!”

“But...”

As Wang Xian spoke, his eyes were filled with killing intent. He stared at Yin Xianfeng and the rest of the six elements sect and said, “Today, I want them to die!”

“Eighth Prince, let me tell you today. If you kill Yin Xianfeng and the rest before me, today’s matter will be over!”

“If not...”

“Haha, if not, if not, what do you dare to do? Arrogant, what an arrogant fellow!”

When the eighth prince heard Wang Xian’s words, he was extremely furious. He revealed a ferocious expression and shouted loudly.

“If not, all your subordinates will die except for you!”

Wang Xian stared at him indifferently as he spoke.

“Roar! Roar!”

When he finished speaking, the two ferocious beasts beside him didn’t hesitate at all. One bolt of lightning and one earth spike after another attacked the subordinates behind the eighth prince.

Without any warning, they attacked directly.

The middle-aged man standing beside the eighth Prince’s face changed, and the majestic power on his body shook. He waved his arm, and a golden screen directly blocked in front of him, blocking the attacks of the spirit purple qilin and the blood evil turtle.

“Roar Roar!”

The blood evil turtle’s body moved, and it directly flew into the sky. Its pair of bloodshot eyes stared below, ready to attack at any time.

The eighth Prince’s face changed greatly, and the expressions of the subordinates behind him also changed drastically.

Yin Xianfeng and the others widened their eyes.

“This... Damn, is he threatening the eighth prince? How dare he...”

“This is too violent. He wants to directly deal with the eighth Prince’s subordinates. Isn’t he afraid that the eighth prince will take revenge on him after he inherits the throne?”

The pupils of the surrounding people shrank slightly when they saw this scene, and their faces revealed shock.

He had directly confronted the eighth prince. This was too violent.

If the eighth Prince really had a chance to ascend to the throne in the future, he would definitely suffer his revenge.

No one dared to offend the Prince of the Light Dragon dynasty to such an extent. They didn’t show any mercy at all.

Long Xiaotian, who was at the side, was also slightly stunned. His eyes flickered.

“You... How dare you!”

When the eighth prince heard Wang Xian’s words, his expression changed drastically. His eyes were filled with killing intent as he stared at Wang Xian and roared furiously.

“You Dare?”

“Hehe, I’ll give you ten seconds. Either you kill Yin Xianfeng and the rest immediately and throw them to my side!”

“Or, it’ll depend on the luck of all your subordinates. Let’s see how many of them can walk out of this place alive!”

Wang Xian stared at the eighth prince with a cold gaze. His face was filled with disdain.

“Ten, nine, eight, seven...”

After Wang Xian finished speaking, without any hesitation, he started the countdown of ten seconds.

When the countdown started, the eighth Prince’s face was filled with horror. When he heard Wang Xian’s voice, he gritted his teeth.

However, looking at his cold expression, he could feel the killing intent in the eyes of the two ferocious beasts.

He didn’t doubt what Wang Xian said at all.

“Eighth Prince!”

The expression of the insightful void martial artist who was standing beside the eighth Prince changed slightly. He had witnessed the battle prowess of the two beasts with his own eyes.

Even if they couldn’t use their dharma idol after the battle, if the two demonic beasts wanted to deal with them.

If one of the beasts could restrain him, the remaining people would be slaughtered by the other beast.

Without him around, the subordinates behind the eighth Prince would be slaughtered easily.

When the eighth Prince heard the words of the middle-aged man beside him, he turned his head stiffly with an uncertain expression on his face.

“Haha, Eighth Brother, you don’t have to be afraid. If this brother of mine really makes a move, I’m afraid of hurting you by accident. Come to me and I will protect you!”

At this moment, Long Xiaotian’s gloating voice was heard.

He didn’t expect Wang Xian to dare to be so tough on his younger brother. However, when he saw this scene, he was in a great mood.

No matter what happened today, his younger brother was going to suffer a heavy loss today!

When the eighth Prince heard the mocking voice, he clenched his fists tightly.

“Five, four, three...”

Wang Xian’s voice was still ringing in his ears.

“Eighth prince...”

Behind the eighth prince, Yin Xianfeng’s face was filled with fear. He shouted softly and stared at Wang Xian with bloodshot eyes.

“Let me tell you, if you dare to kill me, the people of our six element sect will definitely not let you off...”

“One!”

“PFFT PFFT PFFT PFFT!”

When Yin Xianfeng’s face was filled with malevolence as he roared loudly!

When Wang Xian’s last word fell!

When the two ferocious beasts were about to attack!

The insightful void martial artist who was standing beside the eighth Prince moved. A huge axe appeared in his hand. He waved it gently and landed directly on Yin Xianfeng’s body.

The terrifying golden light directly submerged him.

Following closely, the Golden Light covered the group behind him.

The group of senior and junior brothers who followed Yin Xianfeng died immediately.

When the surrounding people saw this scene, their hearts trembled violently. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

The eighth prince actually killed his subordinates, Yin Xianfeng and the others who had pledged allegiance to him.

One had to know that Yin Xianfeng was a heaven’s chosen!

If he killed a heaven’s favorite who had pledged allegiance to him, who would dare to pledge allegiance to him in the future?

Who would dare to be his subordinate?

Although everyone understood that this was something the eighth prince had no choice but to do, killing him was still killing him. This had already become a huge stain.

The eighth Prince’s subordinates were slightly silent.

The eighth Prince’s body was slightly trembling. He lowered his head, and his eyes were extremely red.

The discussions around him entered his ears once again. He could feel the mocking smile on his second brother’s face.

He was unwilling to accept this!

“Brother Yin Xianfeng, don’t worry. I, Long Xiaoyun, will definitely pay you back tenfold for today’s grudge!”

He raised his head abruptly and looked at the corpses behind him as he growled in a low voice.

He looked at Wang Xian once again and grinned.

“Are you satisfied now?”
