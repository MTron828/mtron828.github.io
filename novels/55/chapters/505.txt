Chapter 506: What Has Diabolism Got To Do With Me?

“I have a question. For this alliance of the orthodox sects to eliminate Diabolism, how are we going to act? Who will be issuing instructions, or will it be based on the consensus of a group of Dan Realm experts?” Wang Xian looked at Nie Wuya and asked plainly.

“I wonder if this brother has heard of the saying, ‘Dong Hua rules supreme in China’s Underworld.’ This elimination of Diabolism would naturally be under the leadership of our Dong Hua Sacred Sect. Moreover, considering the strength that our Dong Hua Sacred Sect is mobilizing, it shouldn’t be an absurd demand for us to lead, right?” Nie Wuya answered as though it was just a natural order to expect.

“Why are you asking my Dragon Sect to mobilize all our strength then?” Wang Xian looked at Nie Wuya and questioned him coldly.

Nie Wuya raised an eyebrow at Wang Xian and said with a smile, “This is mainly in consideration of the suppression the experts from the Dragon Sect could have on Diabolism. Next, if the Medical Saint Sect was still around, our battle with Diabolism would be a lot easier. Now that the Dragon Sect has annihilated the Medical Saint Sect, it’s only reasonable that you guys make up for it. Moreover, the Dragon Sect has no ordinary disciples. Other sects and families will be mobilizing five to six hundred of them and maybe even a thousand. Asking you guys to send fifty people isn’t unreasonable at all!”

Hehe!

Upon hearing Nie Wuya’s explanation, Wang Xian chuckled in contempt. He stood up and spoke loudly. “You should know about this too. Our Dragon Sect has no ordinary disciples and has just fifty Inborn experts. In that case, why should I join the alliance of the orthodox sects and accept the commands of your Dong Hua Sacred Sect?”

As Wang Xian spoke, he looked across everyone on the elevated stage.”With the fifty Inborn experts of the Dragon Sect, who dares to offend us in the Underworld? Would Diabolism dare? Even if they did, so what? Is my Dragon Sect afraid?

“In the Underworld, regardless of whether the orthodox sects rule or Diabolism rules, what has it got to do with my Dragon Sect?

“Regardless of whether it’s Diabolism or the orthodox sects, none of you could affect our Dragon Sect. You want our Dragon Sect to mobilize all our strength and listen to your orders? What gives you the guts to even think of it?” Wang Xian chuckled and stared at Nie Wuya. As he spoke, he ensured that every word was clear to everyone.

Ordering his Dragon Sect? How dare he!

“This... This...”

When the surrounding forces heard Wang Xian, they were all stunned.

Everyone looked at Wang Xian and frowned.

“I hate people ordering me around. Give me a reason for my Dragon Sect to join the alliance of the orthodox sects!”

Wang Xian smiled and issued the last question to Nie Wuya. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

When Nie Wuya heard Wang Xian, his expression turned solemn.

He would have never expected Wang Xian to make such remarks.

Wang Xian’s lips curved into a smile as he stared at Nie Wuya.

His original intention was to not join the so-called alliance of the orthodox sects. Yet, Nie Wuya wanted him to send the entire Dragon Sect in. This made him even more against the idea.

What rights do you guys have to order my Dragon Sect?

“Now that all the sects in the Underworld are in, is your Dragon Sect thinking of isolating yourselves away from us?” Nie Wuya stared at Wang Xian and asked solemnly.

“In that case, our Dragon Sect chooses to go our own way!”

Wang Xian met Nie Wuya’s gaze.

“Brat! I had thought about killing you but Brother Nie stopped me and asked me to think of the bigger picture. Now that you are not joining the alliance of the orthodox sects...”

Suddenly, a voice that was filled with killing intent resounded.

Boom!

A terrifying aura shot through to the sky. A roar that resembled the fury of water seemed to have come from the sky.

Hai Jiao stood up from his seat emotionlessly and stared at Wang Xian.

“Haha, kill me? If this wasn’t the territory of Dong Hua Sacred Sect, you would have become a corpse by now!”

Wang Xian laughed heartily. He looked harshly at Hai Jiao before looking across the crowd from Dong Hua Sacred Sect.

Nie Wuya stared at Wang Xian as his face sank. “I have long heard that the Dragon King of the Dragon Sect is exceptionally brazen. Today, this old man has finally witnessed it. Crippling a disciple of our Dong Hua Sacred Sect and now with your brazen claims. You really are young and impulsive!”

“Hehe! What’s with it? I’m already giving Dong Hua Sacred Sect face by not killing the disciple. If you guys want to make us an enemy, I wouldn’t mind either!”

Wang Xian licked his lips and stared at all the people from Dong Hua Sacred Sect.

“Arrogance! Really arrogant!”

“That’s a hundred Inborn experts and four Dan Realm experts. Yet, he dared to make such claims!”

“How ignorant and fearless for him to openly challenge Dong Hua Sacred Sect!”

“Now that I have seen it today, he’s really arrogant. Too arrogant, in fact, to have the guts to make Dong Hua Sacred Sect his enemy!”

The surrounding sects and families from the Underworld looked at Wang Xian and commented.

Rumble!

Just as Wang Xian completed his words, the hundred-plus experts from Dong Hua Sacred Sect stood up. Terrifying auras shot to the sky as they stared harshly at Wang Xian.

As long as the old man before them gave his instructions, they would definitely kill this arrogant brat.

Sui Huang and Xiao Quanshan sighed upon seeing how confrontational Wang Xian was.

“Now that Diabolism is on the rise, could it be that you guys still want to start a battle of Sacred Sects?”

“Since Dragon Sect isn’t willing to join, why do we have to force him? If we push him to the opposite side, it will be greatly harmful to us!”

Sui Huang and Xiao Quanshan spoke solemnly.

At the same time, they were clearly expressing where they stood.

The surrounding Sacred Sects frowned.

A Sacred Sect not joining wasn’t an outcome they wished to see.

“Since the Dragon King is so arrogant to say that Diabolism has nothing to do with him, what else can I, Nie Wuya, say? For now, my only advice is to watch your own actions!”

Nie Wuya saw that Sui Huang and Xiao Quanshan interrupted and knew that this wasn’t the time for internal conflict. Therefore, he remarked coldly.

“I have a feud with this brat. Today, I’m going to kill him here. Does anyone here have an opinion on that?” Hai Jiao shouted across.

His eyes were fixed on Wang Xian and brimming with killing intent. “I thought of killing you after settling this matter. Since you are looking for death, I will fulfil your wish right now!”

As he spoke, he moved.

Rumble!

The sounds of seawater tumbling reverberated across instantly. Hundreds of meters of seawater instantly formed behind Hai Jiao.

The depth of the seawater reached over ten meters and it was suspended in the air.

“In that case, I shall see who’s going to die today!”

Seeing Hai Jiao attacking, killing intent beamed from Wang Xian’s eyes. He moved and met his attacks.

Boom! Scorching hot flames blazed the sky. Several hundreds of meters of space around Wang Xian was shrouded in flames.

Fire and water instantly filled the sky above the Dong Hua Ritual Ground.

“They... They are going to fight!”

“They really are going to fight. The second strongest expert of the Underworld versus the Dragon King from the Dragon Sect!”

“The people from Dong Hua Sacred Sect didn’t say a word. It would seem that they won’t be interfering!”

“Doesn’t the Dragon King use metal attribute? How did he release fire attribute energy suddenly?”

“What a terrifying aura! The battle between unparalleled experts could really destroy heaven and earth!”

When Hai Jiao charged across and Wang Xian met his attack, the color of the sky changed instantly.

Flames and seawater occupied the entire sky.

Nie Wuya and the experts from Dong Hua Sacred Sect looked at Wang Xian, who was emitting endless flames, solemnly.

That’s definitely the strength of a Dan Realm unparalleled expert.

Hai Jiao definitely lives up to his name as the second strongest expert in the Underworld. Even I am no match for him. That arrogant brat will definitely die! Nie Wuya thought to himself while staring grudgingly at the two men in the air!

It would be best if the Lord of Sea Serpent Island could kill this arrogant brat. This will save us from further troubles! Experts from some Sacred Sects thought to themselves.

With regard to Hai Jiao being the second strongest expert in the Underworld, they had absolute confidence. Killing a brat shouldn’t be a tough issue!
