Chapter 1192: Ancient Blood Stream sect, 11

Translator: 5496903

The area in front of them was extremely huge. It was densely packed with all kinds of buildings.

Although the place looked extremely messy, the area was huge. It was at least several times bigger than Bright Moon City, which was the largest city that Wang Xian had ever seen.

As for the number of humans, Wang Xian estimated that there were at least 40 to 50 million people.

“Let’s go, brother Wang Xian. Let’s fly. On the small island by the sea in front of us, it’s an island built by our Guanglong dynasty. It’s specially inhabited by the Royal Family!”

Long Xiaotian pointed at the location by the sea and said to him.

Wang Xian rode on the spirit purple qilin and flew into the sky to take a look. By the sea, there were many man-made islands. Each island was not small, and the larger ones were about ten kilometers in circumference.

These islands looked extremely prosperous. Powerful formations covered the islands.

“Eh? where is that?”

Wang Xian suddenly looked ahead. In the distance, he could vaguely see dilapidated palaces and dilapidated buildings.

Some of these buildings extended into the sea, while others extended into the forest. They stretched as far as the eye could see.

Wang Xian recalled the records that Long Xiaotian had given him over the past two days.

This place was originally the territory of a powerful sect, the blood stream sect, a few thousand years ago.

At that time, the blood stream sect was the undisputed overlord of the flowing sea region. It was said that there were more than a dozen experts at level six or seven of the Seethrough realm.

There were more than a thousand experts above the Seethrough realm. It was said that this was the most glorious period in the flowing sea region.

In the blood flow sect, experts at the profound void realm would have their own mansions and blessed lands.

Moreover, they had their own disciples.

The entire blood flow sect was only weaker than those empires, but its strength was definitely much higher than those empires.

At that time, the blood flow sect had more than a hundred thousand disciples. It was undoubtedly a huge force.

However, the blood stream sect was a force established by humans and demonic beasts. In the internal conflicts, 80-90% of the thousands of insightful emptiness realm experts were lost.

Since then, the human experts of the Blood Stream sect and the demonic beasts were at loggerheads, fighting to the death.

After thousands of years of struggle, there was still no victor.

The dilapidated buildings were the mansions and paradises of the insightful emptiness realm experts in the past.

The blood flow sect used to be a large sect built on a spirit stone lode. It was a true paradise.

The residences of many insightful emptiness realm experts were also treasured lands.

After the war broke out, the insightful emptiness realm experts died, but their residences remained.

Every expert’s residence was protected by a formation. There might be treasures or inheritances hidden inside.

Even after thousands of years, a large portion of these experts’residences had yet to be explored.

If one was lucky, they might be able to obtain the inheritances of rank 7 or even rank 8 profound void martial experts.

Apart from these residences, there were four other treasure grounds in the demoness graveyard.

The blood stream sect’s training grounds.

The blood stream sect’s training grounds.

The Blood Stream sect’s main hall.

The Heaven’s pride stage of the Blood Stream sect.

These four places were the treasure grounds that made many people go crazy.

The training grounds for the weak, the glorious battlefield for the powerful mercenary groups, and the famous grounds for the Strong Heaven’s pride. These words were the best explanation for the graveyard of the demi-humans!

“That island is the island of the royal family of the Radiant Empire!”

Long Xiaotian’s voice sounded from the side. The island below said to Wang Xian.

Wang Xian looked over. It was an island with a circumference of ten kilometers. The environment above was very beautiful.

The group flew over and arrived at the entrance.

“Greetings, Your Highness, second prince. Your Highness, the Princess!”

The island was protected by a formation. Once someone barged in, they would be discovered immediately. Therefore, they had to enter through the entrance.

Long Xiaotian and long Luo walked to the front. The guards at the entrance immediately bowed respectfully.

“Yes!”

Long Xiaotian nodded his head faintly and led his men into the island.

Wang Xian followed by the side. Riding on the Spirit Purple Unicorn, he was exceptionally eye-catching among the group of Black Shadow Leopards.

The four guards looked at the second Prince’s group in astonishment. Their eyes were filled with astonishment.

“Brother Wang Xian, you can stay beside us. Also, we will send someone to deliver the spiritual herbs and pill formulas to you later!”

“Also, this spiritual liquid is the reward for brother Wang Xian for taming the ferocious beasts!”

Long Xiaotian brought Wang Xian to a courtyard on the island. He pointed to a separate courtyard and said to him.

Usually, only the distinguished guests of the royal family were qualified to stay in such a solitary courtyard.

“Alright, I will start refining pills later. If there’s nothing important, I won’t come out!”

Wang Xian nodded and said to him.

“Alright, brother Wang Xian. There are a few handmaidens in the courtyard. You can instruct them on anything!”

Long Xiaotian sent Wang Xian to the front of the house before leaving.

Wang Xian looked at the spiritual liquid bottle in his hand with a satisfied expression on his face.

There was a total of 10,000 drops of spiritual liquid. According to the second prince, this was all his belongings.

10,000 drops of spiritual liquid was equivalent to 7 million dragon crystals of dragon energy. Even if Wang Xian needed 100 million dragon crystals to level up, this 7 million was not a small amount.

“The conversion of spiritual liquid to dragon crystals is obviously much more cost-effective than spiritual stones!”

Wang Xian thought to himself. He swallowed all the spiritual liquid directly. Then, he looked at the spiritual herbs at the side and the smile on his face grew wider.

After these spiritual herbs were refined into elixirs, Wang Xian would be able to obtain over a million dragon crystals for his revenge.

This long Xiaotian is also a Lucky Star for me

As he thought to himself, Wang Xian immediately started to refine the elixirs one by one.

“Prince, the King has sent a message. He is full of praise for your performance in Wind Salt City. You are the most outstanding person in this assessment!”

In the neighboring courtyard, the old man who had been following long Xiaotian reported with a smile on his face.

“Yes!”

Feng Xiaotian nodded with a smile on his face. He was also very happy.

“Prince, the first prince, the eighth prince, and the others have already rushed here two days ago. They have invited many people to hold a banquet. They want to find some followers. Should we also hold a banquet?”

The old man looked at Feng Xiaotian and suggested.

“Sure. Elder Liang will send invitations to some disciples of the Divine Wind Academy, some powerful mercenary groups that are close to our light dragon dynasty, and some other suitable people. Invite them over. The time is set for the day after Tomorrow!” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Long Xiaotian thought for a moment and said.

“Yes, Prince. Leave it to this old subject!”

Elder Liang bowed and nodded, and immediately walked out.

“This time, let everyone witness the strength of Long Xiaotian!”

Long Xiaotian looked in the direction of the neighboring room with a strong look of confidence on his face.

In the past, he had some experts from wind salt city following him. Coupled with his previous strength, he could be ranked in the top three among the princes.

However, now that he had met Wang Xian, he had obtained more than 50 powerful ferocious beasts.

His strength, he dared to guarantee, was definitely the strongest among the many princes!
