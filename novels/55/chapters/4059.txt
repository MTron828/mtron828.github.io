Translator: 549690339

Everything that happened next became simple!

After the Asgardian demon god was killed, the crisis in the sword and Magic Universe was completely resolved!

After witnessing Wang Xian’s strength, Liu Lan and Wang Xian invited Wang Xian to their territory!

Wang Xian didn’t reject them!

Following that, the undeserved forbidden ground and the flowing water forbidden ground held a grand celebration banquet in the universe! It was to celebrate their destruction of the Aga Heavenly Demon God.

It was to celebrate their revenge!

And after they left, the entire sword and Magic Universe knew that their universe’s Lord Tianyuan creation had joined forces with the Dragon Palace Dragon King of the nine-origin universe to destroy a Tianyuan creation.

An enemy that had invaded their universe during the last calamity!

When this news was released, it caused countless tremors!

“Two of us, the Masters of the Heaven’s origin destiny realm, actually destroyed a heaven’s origin destiny realm? A terrifying demonic god, or is he working together with the Masters of the other universe? Who is that master?”

“Hiss, he actually destroyed a heaven’s origin destiny realm. Isn’t this too terrifying?”? “I heard that the Master of that universe is the sage Wang Xian from the dragon roar forbidden ground. His main body is a super powerhouse from another universe. This is just one of his clones!”

“No Way? That sage Wang Xian who is like a dark horse? That sage Wang Xian’s breakthrough speed is extremely terrifying. So it turns out that he is actually a clone of a heaven origin creator?”

“You guys don’t know. That Lord Wang Xian directly transformed into a terrifying divine dragon. It was a million kilometers in size and was as big as some of the magical kingdoms in our universe. With a wave of his hand, the world turned upside down. That battle was too terrifying. Even a powerhouse who was at the peak of the Dominator realm was extremely tiny in that battle.

He couldn’t even get close to it! ”

“This time, the two of us have eliminated the most powerful enemy of our sword and Magic Universe. In the future, when the calamity of our sword and Magic Universe arrives, we will be able to have one less powerful enemy. This is a fortunate thing for our sword and Magic Universe. ”

“If not for Lord Wang Xian’s help this time, according to the experts from the unfettered forbidden land and flowing water forbidden land, at least 30% of the living beings in our sword and magic universe would have died at the hands of the Demon God. ”

“It’s all thanks to Lord Wang Xian’s help this time! ”

In the sword and magic universe, countless of the strong disciples were discussing.

The Battle of the Demon God who was at the Heaven destroying destiny level was transmitted to every corner of the sword and Magic Universe.

The legend of Wang Xian had also spread to every corner!

During this celebration ceremony, the entire forbidden land of the dragon roar forbidden land had joined the flowing water forbidden land.

This was a huge opportunity for the dragon roar forbidden land.

The founder of the Dragon Roar forbidden land was also very excited.

Even though the forbidden land they created was disbanded.

However, after they joined the flowing water forbidden land, they had more and more resources.

After the Flowing Blue Sky Yuan creation realm powerhouse took care of long yinhao, he would naturally become a top-tier powerhouse in the flowing water forbidden land in the future.

Breaking through to the peak of the Overlord realm was almost 100% certain.

As for long yinyin, that was even more so.

It could be said that with Wang Xian’s background, Long Yinhao had a high possibility of becoming the leader of the flowing water forbidden ground in the future.

This was because flowing blue paid more attention to the comfort of their entire sword and magic universe.

She paid more attention to the living beings in the entire sword and magic universe.

The flowing water forbidden land was just a force that she had casually built up to nurture experts.

If she could obtain the help of two heavenly yuan destiny realm experts because of the Dragon Roar and Dragon Roar, then why not?

Therefore, Liu Lan did not hide anything during the celebration. She directly gave Long Yinhao and the flowing moon Saintess a lot of treasures and authority.

As for long yinyin, she did not need to say anything. The entire sword and magic universe’s experts and disciples knew what to do.

Even the powerful disciples from the undeserved forbidden ground and other sacred lands and sacred academies had sent many precious gifts during this celebration.

There were all kinds of treasures at the level of innate treasures and all kinds of huge resources. There were countless of them.

When Wang Xian saw Liu Lan and Hopeless Heaven’s goodwill, he didn’t bother too much with them.

He directly gave Liu Lan and hopeless heaven the space bottle in the space forbidden ground.

The experts of the forbidden space were still very important to the sword and magic universe.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

He was not a heartless person.

As long as he did not perish in the future, there would not be any problems with long yinyin and long yinyin.

Liu Lan and the rest would not let long Yinhao and long yinyin have any problems either.

In fact, after the experts of the forbidden space were released, they were extremely grateful to Wang Xian after surviving the calamity.

After all, the experts and disciples of the forbidden space had offended an existence at the level of the Heaven’s origin creation. The fact that the other party did not kill all of them was already showing mercy to them.

An existence at the level of the Heaven’s origin creation was not someone they could hold a grudge against.

Therefore, the forbidden space did not blame Wang Xian at all. Instead, they blamed the bunch of reckless people who provoked Wang Xian.

After learning that Wang Xian had a space attribute clone, he sent a large number of treasures related to the space attribute to seek forgiveness.

These resources were enough to elevate Wang Xian ‘s void dragon body to the peak of the universe’s ruler.

As for breaking through to the Heaven’s origin realm, that would depend on luck.

Time passed day by day. Wang Xian followed the dragon’s Roar and toured the sword and Magic Universe!

He cultivated and played at the same time.

Occasionally, he would return to the Dragon Palace in the nine-origin universe.

Hundreds of millions of years passed very quickly.

On this day, in the sky above the flowing water forbidden ground.

An extremely vast and mighty aura soared into the sky.

A terrifying energy pillar soared into the sky.

There were dozens of energy pillars, and each of them emitted an incomparably violent energy.

Terrifying and vast.

It was as if the heavens and earth had been split apart! All sorts of booming sounds came from the entire sky.

“Roar Roar Roar! ”

“Roar Roar Roar! ”

“Boss, I’ve broken through, I’ve broken through! ”

Following that, an extremely excited voice sounded and spread far, far away.

The flowing water forbidden ground’s old nest wasn’t very far from the undeserved forbidden ground and Tian Yuan city.

However, the size of the lair of the flowing water forbidden ground was still very large.

However, this power and this voice had spread to Tianyuan city and the undeserved forbidden ground.

The terrifying energy pillar could be seen from extremely far away.

Everyone’s faces were filled with shock.

“This is? That Lin Niu has broken through! ”

When this power soared into the sky, Liu Lan and Wangtian immediately sensed it and immediately flew over.

Their faces were filled with shock.

The Dragon King’s mount had broken through.

The Dragon King now had an existence at the Heavenly Yuan creation level..
