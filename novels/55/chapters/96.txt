Chapter 97: Prime Minister Turtle (2)

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

“I am the Dragon King, the world’s only true Dragon.”

Wang Xian slightly lifted his head and stared at the spiritual turtle. “Succumb to me, or you’ll get devoured by me!”

“Succumb? I’m the Turtle Ancestor. You’re just a mere Dragon King, and you have the cheek to ask me to succumb to you? Ignorant!”

The spiritual turtle had a high intelligence as he stared coldly at Wang Xian with a tilting head. His eyes had a disdainful look in them.

Even though he could sense the domineering strength from the odd creature in front of him, he was not afraid as his physical size was larger than it.

Besides, he had lived for thousands of years. As the ancestor of the turtles, how could he succumb to anyone?

“Turtle ancestor?”

Wang Xian was a little stunned when he heard the spiritual turtle calling himself the Turtle Ancestor. It was unexpected for him to encounter a cocky spiritual turtle.

“If that’s the case, you’re choosing the second alternative.”

Wang Xian swung his tail gently as he gazed at the gigantic spiritual turtle.

“Courting your own death. Since you interrupted my sleep, I’ll eat you up.”

The spiritual turtle opened his mouth wide as he attacked Wang Xian without any fear.

He shook his body, and the mud around the area spread out. The entire region turned murky, and the visibility dropped.

“Earth Control?”

Once again, Wang Xian displayed a surprised look when he saw the fluctuation in the surrounding earth.

This was the most formidable marine animal that he had ever encountered. Not only did the creature have intelligence, it even had Superpower.

“I know Earth Control too!”

Wang Xian displayed a cold smile on his face. He slightly wriggled his body, and the soil in the murky sea was filtered from the water. The soil then gathered and formed into a ball of dirt.

When the surrounding water was cleared, Wang Xian saw the spiritual turtle, which had swum to a location within five meters away from him. A smirk surfaced on his face.

“Earthy Thorn!”

Earthy Thorn was a simple technique in his Earth Control Arts. The current Wang Xian was still too weak, and he had yet to master his control of the Five Elements.

If he grew stronger, he could control all the surrounding earth and bury everything around it.

“You can control the earth too.”

The Spiritual Turtle was taken aback when he saw the incoming Earthy Thorn. However, there was no fear in him as he lowered his head slowly.

Bam!

The Earthy Thorn landed on the durable shell of the Spiritual Turtle, leaving no trace on it.

“Go to hell!”

The Spiritual Turtle suddenly accelerated as he opened his enormous mouth to bite Wang Xian.

Upon seeing the dense and sharp teeth in his mouth, Wang Xian knew that he could bite off a piece of meat from him if he were caught in it.

“Go and die!”

Wang Xian looked at the Spiritual Turtle with a disdainful look in his eyes. Even though he was only Level Six, he had no fear when confronted by creatures who were of Inborn levels.

As a Five Elements Divine Dragon, Level-ten marine animals could not pose any threat to him.

“Metal counters Wood, Wood counters Earth, Earth counters Fire and Fire counters Metal!”

The five elements reinforce and counteract each other. The colors on Wang Xian’s body changed and turned green eventually.

The Azure Dragon with Wood attribution can counteract all Earth in the world!

Wang Xian stretched out his dragon claws with thistles and thorns slithering and twining themselves around the mouth of the Spiritual Turtle.

Roar!

Wang Xian let out a dragon roar while exhaling a gush of green breath.

As the green breath hit the aquatic plants in the surrounding area, the plants began to shoot up frantically.

The water plants entangled themselves to form ropes. They slid towards the Spiritual Turtle and entwined the Spiritual Turtle.

In an instant, the Spiritual Turtle was trapped within the woody field which spanned across a radius of 20 meters.

“Such a powerful Five-elements reinforcement!”

Looking at the woody field that he created, Wang Xian was rather surprised. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

When he was in the human form, he was five times weaker than he was in dragon form. Hence, he was unable to create such a powerful woody field.

Moreover, he was unable to interchange the five elements when he was in human form. Hence, he was even weaker, and his combat skill would be weaker by 10 folds.

“Let me go, let me go!”

The Spiritual Turtle struggled violently, but he realized that the seaweed around him was not giving way except to tighten its grip on him.

Besides, the counteract of the five elements made it even more difficult for the Spiritual Turtle, with a heavy body, to break free.

“Turtle meat makes a great tonic. Heh heh, I’ll chop off your limbs and barbecue them. Then, I’ll cook your head for the soup. Hehe!”

“Oh...no. The head cannot be used for the soup. I’ll throw it away. Heh heh!”

Wang Xian revealed his creepy teeth as he observed the turtle with a thought in his mind.

“I’ll surrender to you. Don’t kill me. Spare my life, Great King!”

The Spiritual Turtle hid his head in his gigantic shell with eyes full of fear as he pleaded.

“Just now, I asked you to surrender to me. You refused. Now, you’re surrendering to me because you can’t win against me?”

Wang Xian stared coldly.

“Great King, I’ll give all the treasures that I’ve collected to you. Please spare my life!” said the Spiritual Turtle hurriedly.

“Treasures? What treasures? “Wang Xian quickly asked with eyes brightened up.

“I’ll get them for you. But please, don’t kill me!”

“Fine, don’t think of running away. I can easily kill you.”

Wang Xian nodded. He was not afraid that the Spiritual Turtle would escape. With a thought, the surrounding seaweed retracted rapidly and turned into ordinary seaweed again.

With a pair of wary eyes, the Spiritual Turtle looked at Wang Xian before he swam to the back.

Wang Xian followed him and came to the place where he’d been just now.

Ka Ka Ka!

The Spiritual Turtle came to the place where he’d been and manipulated the earth below him. As he did that, individual items began to surface and float up.

“Hur? What are all these things?”

Wang Xian looked at the floating things that resembled turtle shells with shock.

“Trophies, King. These are my trophies. Those little turtles who fought with me were all killed by me. These are their shells.”

The Spiritual Turtle shifted his gigantic body as he spoke.

“Pervert!”

Wang Xian looked at the pile of turtle shells beside him and blew his dragon beard.

Among these turtle shells, there was one that was about five meters in size. It must have been a formidable one before it was slaughtered by this Spiritual Turtle, unfortunately.

“King, I’m formidable!” the Spiritual Turtle said proudly.

“Fine. I have no interest in your trophies. Swallow this blood essence and do not think of resisting!”

Wang Xian moved his claw, and a drop of Dragon Blood entered the Spiritual Turtle’s mouth.

The Dragon Blood was no longer gold in color. Instead, it was five different colors.

The Spiritual Turtle closed his eyes without putting up any resistance.

“It’s done. From now on, you’ll be the Prime Minister Turtle of the Dragon Palace!”

The moment Wang Xian spotted such an enormous Spiritual Turtle, he had already made up his mind.

The Dragon Palace needed a Prime Minister Turtle!

Ding.

“You’ve subdued three marine animals and fulfilled the criteria for constructing the Dragon Palace.”

“Level-one Dragon Palace can be established deep in the seabed with resistance to floods and fires. It will form a region of its own. The required materials to build one: 100 tons of gold, 100,000 tons of silver, 1 million of brass, 10,000 of refined iron, 1 million of coral reef, one ton each for gemstones with five different colors and one ton of spiritual stones.”

At this moment, the system notification sounded off, which made him freeze.

He seldom heard the system notification apart from the beginning where he had just become a dragon. Now, the system actually prompted him about the Dragon Palace.

Initially, Wang Xian thought he needed to build his Dragon Palace by mastering the Divine Dragon Transformation. Never did he expect that the system was building it for him.

Surprise!
