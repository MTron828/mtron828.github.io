3512 The counterattack of the 3511 Dragon Palace had officially begun

Boom! Boom! Boom

The sound of destruction reverberated in the sky above the city of Daming. The entire city of Daming was reduced to ruins at a terrifying speed.

A few seconds later, Wang Xian was floating in the sky above the city of Daming. He looked coldly at the city that looked like ruins.

“Is there no one to come and support us?”

Wang Xian mumbled and chuckled.

“Dragon King, there are treasures here. I will go and get them.”

King Aqua Touch’s eyes lit up as he stared at the ruins of Daming city below and shouted at Wang Xian.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded and hovered above daming city.

He didn’t run away immediately. With his current strength, even if the alliance leader of the Hundred Cities Alliance was here?

So what!

With his strength, he could totally fight against him!

As for whether he could kill him, it would depend on the foundation of the Alliance leader of the Hundred Cities Alliance!

King water touch quickly collected the treasures of Daming City. Some water-elemental treasures were directly swallowed into his stomach.

Wang Xian sensed it and did not say anything!

King Water Touch’s current use was higher than the Heaven Array in the Dragon Palace.

After all, he did not have any restrictions when he reached the realm of the universe’s ruler.

It was extremely difficult for the Heaven Array to break through to the realm of the universe’s ruler.

At this stage, it was not a matter of resources, but one’s talent and luck.

Just as the Daming city was destroyed, the 14 cities closest to the Daming city also suffered a terrifying attack!

The attacks of the eight-headed fiend ao crab and the others caused the cities to be destroyed one by one.

Screams of pain spread to the 14 cities!

“Weng Weng Weng!”

Just as the 15 cities of Daming City were being attacked, the 108 mountains near the headquarters of the 100 Cities Alliance started to tremble. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

This was a new warning method of the 100 cities alliance.

Once a city experienced a ripple of power at the universe ruler level, the mountains would tremble!

Now, 15 mountains were trembling. This meant that 15 cities were under attack!

Sou Sou Sou

In an instant, figures appeared above the 15 mountains.

The alliance leader of the 100 City Alliance stared at the 15 cities, his eyes shining with a terrifying light.

“15 cities have been attacked. Immediately send reinforcements and kill all the intruders!”

The alliance leader of the Hundred Cities Alliance roared with a dense expression!

“Sou!”

As the sound of his voice faded, he flew towards a mountain peak below.

On that mountain peak, there was a teleportation formation. He landed on the teleportation formation and immediately disappeared.

“Two people in a group, go and assist!”

Around them, there were 20 great beings of the Hundred City Alliance. They looked at each other and growled.

These 20 members were the trusted aides of the alliance leader of the Hundred City Alliance. They were all Level 2 universe masters.

They moved and headed toward the teleportation arrays on the mountain peaks.

As for some cities without support, they couldn’t care less!

Black Cloud City was one of the cities that had been attacked by the experts of the Dragon Palace!

A terrifying energy came from below one of the ruins.

Boom

The surrounding ruins immediately turned into ashes, and the Alliance Master of the Hundred Cities Alliance appeared there.

He sensed his surroundings with a gloomy expression.

At this moment, half of the city had turned into ruins, and two figures were still wreaking havoc in the sky ahead.

That enormous body and terrifying claws. Every time they waved, a large area would turn into ruins.

“A terrifying existence has descended. Let’s Escape!”

At this moment, the two devouring dragons sensed the power of the alliance leader of the Hundred City Alliance. Their expressions changed greatly, and they immediately roared.

Dragon Emperor had warned them to immediately flee the moment they encountered a universe ruler level 3 warrior.

They did not hesitate.

The two devouring dragons began to turn illusory.

“Courting Death!”

The alliance leader of the Hundred Cities Alliance saw the two devouring dragons turn illusory, and his face was filled with rage and blood.

His body shook, and his blood-red eyes on his chest shone with a red light.

A red light fell into the body of a devouring dragon.

However, the red light didn’t seem to have any offensive power, and it didn’t stop the devouring dragon from disappearing.

“Die!”

However, the Alliance Master of the Hundred Cities Alliance didn’t care and roared.

He stretched out an arm, and the red eye on his chest condensed into a ferocious blood eye.

The blood eye disappeared in an instant!

At the same time, the two devouring dragons in the Dragon Palace came back and let out a heavy sigh of relief.

“Ah!”

Suddenly, one of the devouring dragons let out a blood-red cry, and a blood-red eye suddenly appeared in front of him.

The Devouring Dragon’s body began to crumble, turning into blood and instantly dying.

This was the strange ability of Magi!

* Buzz! *

The soul-returning wood on the ancestral tree trembled, and the Devouring Dragon’s soul was absorbed, slowly bearing fruit.

…

“Who are you? How dare you attack the cities of Our Hundred City Alliance? You are courting death!”

At the same time, in another 10 cities.

20 universe rulers and level-two warriors of the Hundred City Alliance rushed over through the teleportation array.

When they saw the two universe rulers and level-two warriors wreaking havoc in the city, their expressions changed drastically, and they roared coldly!

“Hahaha, the Hundred City Alliance doesn’t recognize your grandfather, Dragon Palace? Are the two of you the only ones who came to support us?”

Ba Qi looked at them and sneered coldly.

“Dragon Palace!”

When they heard these two words, their eyes were filled with killing intent.

“Dragon Palace, you are courting death!”

The two great beings of the Hundred City Alliance roared furiously and charged toward Ba Qi and a Devouring Dragon.

“We are courting death! Haha! You are the ones who are courting death! This time, all 15 of your cities will be destroyed!”

Ba Qi laughed maniacally and started to fight with them.

Facing opponents of the same level, they were not afraid at all!

“Roar!”

The Devouring Dragon also roared maniacally and charged over, attacking with its claws.

A city couldn’t withstand the rampage of four universe masters with level-two Combat Power.

Their battle caused the buildings in the city to collapse!

“Run, run!”

“We can’t get close to this level of battle. All disciples, run!”

In the city, some of the surviving disciples and City Masters roared in fear when they saw the battle.

The same thing happened in the other nine cities!

Would the experts of the Dragon Palace be afraid of them if they met someone on the same level as them?

They would fight directly!

Soon, the color of the sky and earth changed in the sky above the cities.

Following that, the cities turned into ruins!

This was a disaster for the experts and disciples in the cities!

As for the city without the support of the Hundred Cities Alliance, it had already turned into ruins.

It was completely wiped out!
