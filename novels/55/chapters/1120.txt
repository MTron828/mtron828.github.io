Translator: 5496903

Yu Chengzi, Yan Wenshan, and Mang Hong floated in the sky. Below them were more than a thousand soldiers of the Dragon and Phoenix Legion.

The three of them stared coldly at the five people three kilometers away.

The more than a thousand soldiers of the Dragon and Phoenix Legion also stared fixedly at the people of star-moon kingdom. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“I, Xing Guang, am the general of the star-moon Legion!”

“I, Ju Xiu Wei, am the vice-general of the star-moon Army!”

“I am the vice-sect Master of the Heavenly Moon sect, the heavenly moon star brilliance!”

“I am the Heavenly Moon Sect’s elder, the Heavenly Moon Sun!”

“I am the city Lord, Lei Feihu!”

At this moment, five people who were floating in the sky and emitting a terrifying aura three kilometers away suddenly spoke.

Their voices covered the entire dragon and Phoenix City, and everyone could hear them clearly!

“What? The general of the star-moon Army!”

“Oh my God, it’s the general of the star-moon kingdom, the star-moon army, and the experts of the Heavenly Moon sect!”

“It’s Xing Guang! It’s him! It’s actually Xing Guang! A top-notch expert of the star-moon Kingdom who once slaughtered 100,000 ferocious beasts by himself! He’s incomparably powerful!”

“It can’t be! The star-moon kingdom actually produced such a terrifying expert! That’s an existence at the third level of the profound void tier!”

“The Heavenly Moon sect actually interfered, this...”

When their voices spread throughout the entire Dragon-phoenix city, everyone’s bodies stiffened.

The names of these few people were like thunder that resounded in everyone’s ears.

In comparison, their former city Lord, Lei Feihu, had the lowest status amongst this group of people.

Especially the name Xing Guanghun. Everyone in star-moon kingdom knew of him.

He was the general of the star-moon Army, and he controlled the most powerful army in star-moon kingdom.

They were also very familiar with the heavenly moon sect, the most powerful sect in star-moon kingdom. There were tens of thousands of elite disciples in the sect, and they were extremely powerful.

Each and every name caused everyone in dragon-phoenix city to reveal frightened expressions, and they discussed in fear.

This time, all the people were on tenterhooks. After all, the group of people in front of them were a group of legendary figures.

In the past, they had only heard of names!

Just the name alone was enough to cause them to feel incomparable reverence.

Now that they were actually here to attack them, how could they not feel fear and fear?

“The dragon-phoenix dynasty dares to occupy the towns of our star-moon kingdom and establish a dynasty. They really don’t put us in their eyes!”

Xing Guanghong, who was floating in the middle, revealed a cold expression. His gaze stared at Mang Hong, and his eyes flickered with a cold killing intent.

“Your Star Moon Kingdom’s territory? No, no!”

Yu Chengzi, who held a feather fan in his hand, waved the fan in his hand. “When the ferocious beasts and demon beasts attacked the city, you gave up on this town. After that, this town also gave up on your star Moon Kingdom. What about your territory?”

“That’s right. When holy sea town was once subjected to a destructive attack, what about Star Moon Kingdom’s rescue? “What about star-moon kingdom’s insightful emptiness realm experts? “Now that we’ve defended the town and broken away from star-moon kingdom, instead, insightful emptiness realm experts have come to invade us one after another. Haha, what a Joke!”

At the rear, Jin Qianyuan roared loudly.

“Where were you when we were in despair? Now, you’re even f * cking attacking us!”

“Everyone from star-moon kingdom, Scram! Get Out of our place! This is the dragon-phoenix city that we’ve defended!”

“Scram! We’re not from your star-moon kingdom! Scram!”

Jin Qianyuan’s words also stirred up the anger of some of the citizens, and they roared loudly from behind.

“HMPH, you’re too stubborn!”

Xing guanghun heard the voice coming from ahead, and his eyes were filled with killing intent. He snorted coldly and said, “I’d like to see what kind of strength you have to dare establish a dynasty in our territory!”

“Soldiers of the Star Moon Army, Get Ready!”

He raised the long spear in his hand and roared.

“Yes!”

It was the soldiers of the Star Moon Army who responded to him.

“Yes!”A cold killing intent resounded in the sky.

It could be heard clearly even within a radius of dozens of miles.

“I’m warning you. Remove the formation and surrender immediately. Otherwise, kill everyone without mercy!”

Xing guanghun roared and warned them.

“Prepare to face the enemy!”

However, Mang Hong’s cold voice responded to his warning.

“Good, good. It seems that all of you have become enemies of star-moon Kingdom!”

Xing guanghun stared at Mang Hong and gripped the spear in his hand tightly.

“You dare to kill the general of star-moon kingdom and occupy the cities and towns of star-moon kingdom. All of you will die!”

Lei Feihu’s eyes similarly flickered with a cold glint as he roared in a low voice.

“Get out of our dragon-phoenix Empire’s territory. Otherwise, kill!”

Mang Hong did not show any signs of weakness as he glared at them and roared with killing intent.

“Kill!”

Below, the dragon-phoenix Army’s 1,000-plus people did not show any signs of weakness in the face of 20,000 enemies as they roared loudly.

At this instant, the 1,000-plus people instantly unleashed their full strength.

At the lowest level of transcendent-level 7, there were more than 20 half-step void interpretation experts, and more than 100 transcendent-level 9 experts.

The moment this aura burst out, it slightly shocked the star Moon Army.

Even the pupils of Xing Guang and the five powerful void interpretation experts in the sky slightly constricted.

“There are more than 20 half-step void interpretation experts, and there are more than 100 transcendent-level 9 experts!”

Lei Feihu’s eyes widened, revealing a hint of shock. “Where did they come from? How can there be so many top-notch experts!”

Xing Guangheng’s expression slowly sank. “More than twenty half-step void interpretation experts, and more than a hundred rank nine transcendents. Fortunately, the Heavenly Moon Sect’s core force came this time. Otherwise, they wouldn’t be their match!”

As he spoke, he looked at the two elders on the left.

“I also didn’t expect that we, the Heavenly Moon Soul Chaser, would be needed!”

The two elders frowned slightly. The Heavenly Moon sect had been forcefully taken over by the star-moon kingdom a few months ago and became a subsidiary sect.

In fact, the Heavenly Moon sect had existed for a longer time than the star-moon kingdom.

The Heavenly Moon sect had existed for more than three thousand years. At that time, the sect master of the Heavenly Moon sect had the terrifying strength of a rank six profound void martial artist. However, after the death of the old sect master, the Heavenly Moon sect had declined somewhat.

Today, it had actually been taken over by the Star Moon Kingdom.

However, they had no other way. The current star Moon Kingdom was not something their heavenly moon sect could contend against.

This time, they followed the orders of the Star Moon King and brought the core strength of the Star Moon sect, the Heavenly Moon Soul Chaser.

The Heavenly Moon Soul Chaser had a total of five hundred people. The strongest people in the entire heavenly moon sect had all joined the Heavenly Moon Soul Chaser.

Of the 500 people, the weakest was at rank 6 transcendent, the strongest was at half-step profound void stage, and there were 11 people at half-step profound void stage.

Although there weren’t more than 100 rank 9 transcendents, there were still more than 40 people.

This was all the power that the Heavenly Moon sect possessed back then, when they weren’t restricted by the star-moon kingdom!

It was also the heritage left behind by the Heavenly Moon sect after 3,000 years of inheritance! !
