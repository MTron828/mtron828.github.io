Chapter 844: 0845 grand wedding

Translator: 549690339

For the first time, the immortal gods of the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect had the illusion that even the immortal gods were inferior to them.

It was absolutely impossible for a dignified immortal god to serve tea and pour water at the side.

The Immortal Gods were high and mighty, revered by tens of thousands of people, and worshipped by everyone.

Now, they didn’t even have the right to sit down.

They glanced at the few immortal gods.

In the entire room, there were six immortal gods. One stood by the door, one served tea and poured water, and four sword-wielding immortal gods stood on both sides of the sofa.

This sort of casual display was not something their yellow heaven immortal sect could compare to.

The three immortal gods looked at each other, and a bitter smile appeared in their eyes.

According to the Dragon Palace’s original strength, the number of immortal gods in the Dragon Palace now would not be less than thirty.

There was a possibility of approaching forty to fifty immortal gods.

Forty to fifty was already very terrifying when one thought about it. Now, the number of immortal gods in the Xuan Yuan clan was only twenty-five on the surface.

“Dragon King, these are some small gifts. Consider them gifts for our first meeting!”

There had to be a proper process. The first time they came, they had to prepare a gift.

Wang Xian was not too domineering. After a simple discussion, they sat down and had a meal together.

This was not considered a marriage engagement, nor was there any talk about marriage between a man and a woman. Perhaps Ling Xiao felt that he was not qualified to talk about this matter, so he did not say much.

Wang Xian did not talk about this matter either. This was left to his sister to decide.

The meal was considered to be a feast for both guests and hosts. In the afternoon, Wang Xian called Xiao ran to the courtyard at the back.

“Phew!”

Seeing Wang Xian leave, Feng Lingtian heaved a heavy sigh of relief.

“Hehe!”

Ling Xiao also felt relieved instantly. His gaze swept across Ao Jian and the rest who had left, and a bitter look appeared on his face.

“Sect master, why do I feel so much pressure in front of the Dragon King? Even if he didn’t release any aura, he still gives off a feeling of superiority!”

An immortal God said softly.

Ling Xiao shook his head slowly. “Of the four immortal gods of swordsmen just now, the one in the middle has the strength of a superior immortal, and the other three are middle immortals!”

“This...”

The three immortal gods beside him widened their eyes in shock.

In other words, just the four subordinates of the Dragon King could destroy their Yellow Heaven Immortal sect.

“Alright, let’s not lose our manners here. Tomorrow, we’ll go to the Yuwen clan with the Dragon King!”

Ling Xiao said with a smile.

He learned more from his son. For example, there were more than a dozen immortal gods on the floating island who listened to Xiao Yu’s orders. Those immortal gods were once experts of the Dragon Gate.

The strength of the Dragon Palace was definitely unfathomable.

According to his estimation, there were at least sixty immortals.

“Your strength is not bad, but don’t be arrogant. The so-called realm of immortals is not the peak. I will teach you a set of martial arts that can be cultivated to a higher realm!”

In the backyard, Wang Xian stood beside Xiao ran and said to him.

Xiao Ran’s heart skipped a beat. He nodded his head heavily and asked, “Master, what is above Immortals?”

“Above immortals are transcendents. Sit on the ground with your legs crossed!”

Wang Xian didn’t say much. If he said too much, it would be bad for him and would affect his faith.

There was no limit to cultivation.

Xiao ran immediately sat on the ground with his legs crossed. Wang Xian opened his mouth and the fire dragon bead appeared.

It was a fire dragon pearl of the extraordinary level.

In the past year, he had cultivated the fire dragon Pearl and the Wood Dragon Pearl to the first level of the extraordinary level. The water spirit Pearl was only at the level of a superior immortal.

The consumption of cultivating the Dragon Pearl was still very high.

He obtained the cultivation method from Feng Luan. A fire attribute cultivation method was also considered a top-notch cultivation method in the extraordinary continent.

In the system treasury, there were also fire attribute attacks, but the exchange price was too high.

After imparting the cultivation method to Xiao ran, the Fire Dragon Pearl’s majestic flames began to refine his body.

Now, Wang Xian’s strength was much higher than his. He could completely refine his body.

After some refinement, Xiao ran’s strength had faintly reached the level of a middle-level immortal. It might not take long for him to achieve a breakthrough.

For a person who had just entered the immortal God realm, it was as if he had eaten a divine medicine.

When the immortals from the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect saw Xiao ran, their eyes widened in disbelief.

This made them feel that the Dragon King was simply unfathomable and had probably reached an even higher realm.

“Dragon King, this marriage between the Yuwen clan and the daughter of the Scandinavian god Realm’s god King can be said to involve all the powerful forces in the east and west. The Scandinavian God realm is the most powerful god realm in the west, and the Yuwen clan is one of the top existences in the east. Therefore, this marriage has formed a terrifying alliance!”

“In the past, the Yuwen clan and the Scandinavian God realm had some cooperation. After the marriage, in the entire east, no one dared to provoke the Yuwen clan. In the west, the Scandinavian God realm is an invincible existence. They will be the largest joint force on Earth!”

“Therefore, for this wedding, all the immortal sects and Immortal Gods will come to congratulate us. Even all the God realms in the western God realm will have immortal gods come to hold the wedding for the bride!” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

The next afternoon, everyone flew toward the Yuwen clan.

Wang Xian initially did not want to go, but Xiao Yu wanted to drag him over.

She made it sound like she wanted to get married in the future and that she could learn from the experiences of others when she wanted to get married.

Wang Xian could not persuade her, so he followed her over.

The relationship between the Yuwen clan and the Dragon Palace had some conflicts in the past. However, after exchanging the artifact of the Celestials for the array formation, their relationship eased up a little.

It could be considered as an ordinary relationship.

“Does such a force still need a marriage alliance?”

Wang Xian smiled.

“It can’t be considered a marriage alliance. Yuwen Hua of the Yuwen clan is in love with the daughter of the god King of the Northern European divine territory. This has further increased the concern between them. Currently, they are the strongest in the entire earth!”

Ling Xiao continued to speak to Wang Xian.

Wang Xian smiled and nodded slowly.

This time, he came with the idea of learning experience. He might need it in the near future.

“It’s just ahead!”

Half an hour later, Ling Xiao pointed in front of him.

Wang Xian looked over. There were huge balloons floating in the sky. The mountains and trees below were decorated with festive streamers.

In the ancient city beside them, there were even lanterns and streamers.

Groups of Yuwen clan’s disciples were flying in the sky to organize the order. Flying was prohibited.

The entire scene was extremely huge. Western faces could be seen everywhere.

There were even some cute and festive looking Swiss.

It was known as the grandest wedding of the century. It would be held today.

“Everyone from the Yellow Heaven Immortal Sect, please follow me!”

A celestial being from the Yuwen clan noticed their arrival and immediately came to welcome them.

When he saw Wang Xian, he was stunned for a moment. Then, he quickly greeted the Dragon King respectfully.

“Dragon King, sect leader Ling, please come in, please come in!”

The attitude of this celestial being from the Yuwen clan had obviously changed a lot. He respectfully brought them to the wedding venue.
