Chapter 885: 0886 draconic aura

Translator: 549690339

On the Mermaid Island, craggy rocks and densely packed seaweed covered the island. Within the cracks between the grass and the island, terrifying piranhas were hiding within.

Piranhas belonged to the category of fierce beasts and did not have intelligence.

On the transcendental continent, there were four types of creatures.

Humans, dragons, fierce beasts, and Demon Beasts!

The difference between fierce beasts and Demon Beasts was their intelligence. Demon Beasts had powerful intelligence, while fierce beasts, just based on their beast-like instincts, were targets of hunting in the entire transcendental continent.

However, ferocious beasts that had lost their intelligence were very strong in terms of reproduction ability. They were also the most common existences in the transcendence continent.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

“COO! Coo! Coo! Coo! Coo!” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The sound of vines could be heard. A Dragon Claw grabbed the head of a large-mouthed piranha. The Dragon Claw sank into the head and swallowed the Piranha.

“The twenty-first one. I’m still two more dragon crystals away from breaking through to the second level of transcendence!”

Wang Xian’s eyes lit up. He reverted back to his dragon form and scanned his surroundings.

Although it was very troublesome to change his form back and forth, his dragon form was at least 20 meters in size. It was too eye-catching.

He could only release his dragon form when he attacked.

Wang Xian stood on a protruding rock and scanned his surroundings.

“HMM? There’s a formation there!”

Wang Xian frowned when he looked ahead. At this moment, he had already entered deep into the island. There was an energy blocking his vision.

“After all, the eye of penetration was obtained from a creature at the bottom of the sea. Its ability is limited. It would be great if I could really obtain an eye technique!”

Wang Xian thought to himself. He looked over there and turned around to search in another direction.

The eight DRAKONIDS did not need them at all. Wang Xian decided to let them act on their own while he acted alone.

After all, the potential of the DRAKONIDS was not as good as the members of the Dragon Palace. After this assessment, he would call some strange demons and golden swordfish over.

“Second level of transcendence!”

After searching for more than ten minutes, Wang Xian’s eyes lit up. A smile appeared in his eyes.

As long as he swallowed this piranha, he would be able to achieve a breakthrough.

With a leap, Wang Xian easily controlled the surrounding seaweed to trap it. Then, he transformed into a dragon and devoured it.

Wang Xian’s current combat strength was comparable to a level four or level two extraordinary creature. He could easily kill it.

“Ding! Devour a level two extraordinary piranha with a big mouth. Extract 2 dragon crystals of Dragon Qi!”

“Ding, level up. Level up to the first change of the Divine Dragon Transformation, level two of the supernatural!”

“Ding, level up. Comprehension of the divine ability, eye of the Heavenly Dragon!”

“Level up. And I even obtained a divine ability!”

Wang Xian’s eyes lit up as his heart skipped a beat.

Eye of the Heavenly Dragon: peering up into the Nine Heavens, peering down into the nine Netherworlds.

“Peering up into the nine heavens, peering down into the nine Netherworlds. What a domineering introduction!”

Wang Xian’s eyes were like torches as his pupils began to change slowly.

The Heavenly Dragon was one of the dragon species in the Dragon Palace. Their most powerful means was to investigate.

The Eye of the Heavenly Dragon was accidentally comprehended because of Wang Xian’s penetrating eye.

Buzz

In an instant, Wang Xian’s eyes became deep. One of his eyes was the starry sky while the other was the pitch-black netherworld. It looked extremely strange.

He looked to the left. There was someone setting up a formation there.

Now that he looked over with the eye of the Heavenly Dragon, the formation gradually disappeared, revealing the scene inside.

Two young men were fighting with five big-mouthed piranhas. The formation blocked off all sounds to prevent attracting the enemy.

“Gugugugugugugu!”

Suddenly, at this moment, a big-mouthed piranha with an extraordinary first level flew out from the bushes and attacked him with a furious face.

Wang Xian quickly turned around. The seaweed around him was undergoing a terrifying transformation.

“COO COO!”

All of a sudden, the big-mouthed Piranha’s eyes were filled with fear. It laid on the ground and looked at Wang Xian in worship.

“This is?”

Wang Xian was slightly stunned. The seaweed around him stopped attacking.

“This is dragon’s might. It can suppress aquatic creatures that are of a lower level than itself!”

Wang Xian revealed a smile. Dragon’s might was a talent that he had always neglected.

It could suppress and control aquatic creatures that were lower in level than him.

“Now, it’s even more convenient!”

Wang Xian’s heart skipped a beat as he continued walking inside.

“AH, help!”

Suddenly, a scream came from not far away.

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes. His eyes changed again and the scene before him appeared in his sight.

More than 20 big-mouthed piranhas were chasing after an eight-man team.

The eight people in the team had pale faces as they cried out for help.

“15 of them are at transcendent level one and nine of them are at transcendent level two!”

Wang Xian didn’t hesitate at all and flew directly in their direction.

“Brother, Help!”

The nine people who were running away saw Wang Xian flying over and hurriedly shouted.

However, when they saw that Wang Xian was alone, their expressions instantly turned ugly.

What was the use of one person?

“Swoosh!”

Wang Xian ignored the nine people who were escaping and brushed past them directly.

“Are you crazy? You actually dare to charge over?”

A girl widened her eyes and shouted loudly with a face full of shock.

“Go, let’s run!”

The nine heads didn’t dare to turn back and continued to flee for their lives!

“Dragon’s might!”

Wang Xian flew over and the dragon’s might covered the area. In an instant, there were more than twenty piranhas with big mouths chasing after the nine people. Fifteen of them immediately fell to the ground.

The other nine level 2 transcendents were trembling as well. Their eyes were filled with fear.

“Attack!”

Wang Xian’s body shook as he ordered the level 1 transcendents directly.

“Coo Coo Coo Coo!”

“Crack Crack Crack!”

The nine level two extraordinary piranhas were caught off guard. Fifteen level one piranhas attacked them directly.

Their huge mouths bit them directly.

However, the huge difference in strength only caused some blood to flow out.

“WHOOSH WHOOSH WHOOSH!”

However, Wang Xian’s attack had arrived at this moment and trapped the nine piranhas in an instant.

This time, Wang Xian did not devour them. Instead, he directly placed the corpses of the nine piranhas at transcendent level 2 into his interspatial ring.

Currently, he needed 1,000 dragon crystals to advance to transcendent level 3.

Only by killing 500 piranhas at transcendent level 2 would he be able to advance.

500 piranhas was not a small number. After the assessment, he could consider coming here to grind his level.

“Let’s continue. With my strength of level 5 transcendence, I can basically do whatever I want on the island!”

Wang Xian revealed a faint smile. He flew up to a hundred meters in the air and scanned his surroundings with the eye of the Heavenly Dragon.

“Kill, Kill, Kill!”

With the help of the eye of the Heavenly Dragon, it was much easier for Wang Xian to kill the piranhas after he had leveled up.

Furthermore, the piranhas at level 1 transcendence were under his direct control.

In just half a day, the number of big-mouthed piranhas that followed behind Wang Xian had reached more than 300. There were also more than 50 corpses that were at transcendent level two.

However, Wang Xian did not encounter any mermaids that were at transcendent level three.
