Chapter 1451: 1451 paid his respects to the Dragon King

“Ah!”

The Great War suddenly broke out, the appearance of the colorful algae demon beasts, and the massacre ordered by the leader of the blood barbaric demon beasts.

Everything happened in an instant.

However, in less than ten seconds, screams of despair made all the humans and demon beasts widen their eyes, full of disbelief.

However, when this scream sounded again, all the humans and demon beasts opened their mouths slightly.

“How is this possible? How is this possible? Aren’t you multi-colored algae demon beasts from the fifth level of the profound void tier? How can you be so strong! ?”

In the sky that was surrounded by countless roots, every phantom image of the leader of the Blood Savage Demon Beast was pierced through by the roots.

Even its main body was penetrated by the roots.

Its entire body was exuding a monstrous blood qi. It cut off the roots in front of its body and roared in fear.

Around it, there were countless densely packed roots. The roots completely covered it.

The danger of death hung above its head.

Its gaze swept across its surroundings, and its expression was somewhat panicked.

“Weaklings don’t have the right to say so much nonsense!”

As Ao Xingmu spoke, he waved his arm, and the roots that filled the sky covered the leader of the Blood Barbaric Demon Beast.

“Oh my God!”

“This attack... This attack that filled the sky is simply too terrifying!”

“That Emperor of the wildlands is going to be killed. No, the leader of the Blood Barbaric Demon Beast is going to be finished!”

“How can this demon beast race that suddenly appeared be so terrifying? In less than a minute, it easily killed two level 6 insightful void martial artists. What level is it?”

“Level 7 insightful void martial artists?”

In the surroundings, all the humans and Demon Beasts looked at the battle between the colorful algae demon beast race and the Blood Barbaric Demon Beast Race in shock.

Especially when they saw the leader of the Blood Barbaric Demon Beast Race and the level 6 insightful void martial artist Blood Barbaric Demon Beast being easily killed, their faces were filled with shock.

Especially the Demon Beast clan. The Royal Demon Beast Clan had already chosen a clan, and now, a clan had suddenly appeared, directly crushing the Blood Barbaric Demon Beast clan.

This...

On the sculpture, the leaders of the various clans raised their heads and stared blankly, their hearts incomparably shocked.

How could such a terrifying clan suddenly appear.

“This, this...”

The Blood Emperor, the life and Death Pill Workshop, and the others were all filled with astonishment.

They had already made an agreement with the Blood Savage Demonic Beast. Now that a demonic beast race had suddenly appeared and removed the leader of the Blood Savage Demonic Beast from the throne, what was going to happen to their agreement?

This was especially true for the blood flow empire. They had specially prepared a crown for the leader of the Blood Savage Demonic Beast.

Before they could put it on, he had already been killed!

What frightened them the most was that this leader of the demonic beast race who had suddenly appeared was actually so terrifying.

“This is... This is, seventh level of the profound void tier!”

At the center of the third trading company in the world, that old man suddenly stood up, his gaze fixed on AO xingmu who was calmly standing there in the sky.

“What?”

The surrounding middle-aged man’s face trembled, and he stood there with his eyes wide open.

“Sou Sou Sou!”

“Peng!”

At this moment, in the sky, the roots covering the sky were retracted, and the corpse of the leader of the Blood Savage Demonic Beast fell to the ground below.

“Leader!”

“Roar, Emperor!”

When the tens of thousands of blood savage beasts saw their leader and a rank 6 profound void martial expert being killed, they all roared in fear.

When the remaining rank 6 profound void martial expert saw his leader and companion being killed, his pupils constricted, filled with fear.

He stared at the colorful algae demon beast in front of him, whose expression changed.

“Run!”

As greedy and bloody bloody bloody Savage Demon Beasts, they cherished their lives very much.

“Do you still want to run? Can you escape?”

Ao Xingmu looked at the blood-red shadow running out desperately with a cold expression on his face.

“Run!”

The rest of the bloody savage demon beasts were shocked and angry when they saw the last top-tier expert of their clan running away.

The rest of the blood savage beasts desperately fled in all directions.

Ao Xingmu swept a glance, his pair of emerald green eyes staring at the surroundings, and the lower half of his body’s vines directly fell into the soil below.

“Hong!”

Under everyone’s shocked gazes, a huge tree demon directly drilled out from the ground below the level 6 insightful void demonic beast that had already fled 2,000 meters away.

The tree demon was 1,000 meters in size, and it gave off a terrifying aura as it attacked.

“Boom! Boom!”

At this moment, many terrifying tree demons also appeared below the other fleeing blood savage beasts.

“Ahhhh!”

“Roar Roar Roar, don’t kill me, don’t kill me!”

A miserable scream sounded out. The leader of the rank 6 insightful void Demonic Beast was killed by the tree demon at a distance of 2,000 meters.

The other 10,000 blood savage beasts had all suffered a devastating blow.

Within the colorful algae clan, another clansman with the strength of a rank 6 insightful void realm expert attacked the remaining blood savage beasts.

For a time, endless roars could be heard from the surroundings.

All the humans and beasts swallowed their saliva and looked at this scene in shock.

Two kilometers away, they killed a rank 6 insightful void martial artist who was trying to escape.

A Blood Savage Demonic Beast clan that was just a moment ago.

A demonic beast clan that had 500 to 600 insightful void martial artists was easily exterminated.

They didn’t have the strength to resist.

“Greetings, my Emperor!”

On the statue, the leaders of the demonic beast clans had respectful expressions.

The expression of the demonic Lin leader changed as he lowered his body and roared.

“Paying respects to our Emperor!”

The other leaders of the demonic beast races also quickly lowered their bodies and paid their respects.

This colorful algae demonic beast leader that suddenly appeared was definitely an existence that surpassed rank six of the profound void martial stage.

A rank seven of the profound void martial stage was an invincible existence in the entire flowing sea region!

“Paying respects to our Emperor!”

The hundreds of thousands of demonic beasts in the surroundings quickly knelt down and said.

In the Demonic Beast clan, the strong were the emperor!

The strength displayed by the leader of the multicolored algae demonic beasts was enough to make all the demonic beasts submit.

It was even more respectful than the leader of the Blood Savage Demonic Beasts.

“Hehe!”

Ao Xingmu’s gaze swept over all the demonic beasts in the surroundings, and a faint smile appeared on his face.

He floated above the dragon throne, and a faint pressure enveloped the entire demon beast race. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“From today onwards, listen to my orders!”

Ao Xingmu’s voice resounded in every Demon Beast’s mind.

“We obey the emperor’s orders!”

“We obey the emperor’s orders!”

The Demon Beast leaders responded loudly, and all the Demon Beasts roared respectfully.

Ao Xingmu’s face revealed a smile.

“This...”

The blood emperor’s expression kept changing when he saw that the emperor of the demon beasts had changed.

“Emperor of the Demon Beasts, can we continue the agreement between us and the Demon Beast Dynasty?”

The blood emperor frowned and asked ao Xingmu.

“The peace agreement?”

Ao Xingmu looked at the blood emperor with a smile and asked indifferently.
