3685 3684 subdued him

“You want me to submit? Dream on. If it was before, I might not be your match. But now, I have consumed the eternal embryo fruit. I can maintain my state of mind. You can forget about suppressing me!”

“Dragon King, you are too arrogant! Too arrogant!”

Ming shisheng looked extremely embarrassed when he saw Wang Xian chasing after him at such a terrifying speed!

However, at this moment, Ming Shaisheng had confidence and confidence in his heart!

“Roar Roar, Hundred Ghost Life, Run!”

In the next moment, his body immediately turned into more than 200 ghost avatars. Each of them flew in one direction!

“Hehe, Ming Shaisheng, I said you can’t run away, so you can’t run away!”

When Wang Xian saw that he had more than 200 ghost avatars, he was also a little shocked.

He sneered and flapped his incipient saint wings. Countless thunderbolts and tornadoes shot toward the more than 200 netherspirit avatars!

“I want to escape. No One Can Catch Me!” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The Netherspirit let out a low growl. A dark force surged out from the more than 200 netherspirit avatars and blocked Wang Xian’s attack!

Crash

However, at this moment, Wang Xian focused his gaze and locked onto the Netherspirit’s main body. In an instant, he was above his head!

The strength of Ming Sha Sheng was due to the joint attack of Wang Xian and Ming Sha Sheng’s doppelganger!

Now that both of them were running away, his main body was very weak!

Wang Xian could easily kill Ming Sha Sheng in an instant!

Boom

The Dragon Claw swept past. It was filled with the power of destruction as it swept across Ming Sha Sheng’s body!

However, his dragon claw attack instantly passed through Ming Sha Sheng’s body. A black flame remained in the void!

His original body had disappeared!

“You have transformed with your clone, right? Then, I want to see how many times you can use this life-saving technique!”

Wang Xian snorted coldly!

Ming Shasheng’s move was very powerful. He had even transferred his body to his clone. It was a powerful life-saving technique!

However, in the next moment, Wang Xian flapped his incorporeal holy wings and instantly locked onto one of Ming Shasheng’s clones and attacked him directly!

The speed of Ming Shisheng’s avatars was only slightly faster than an ordinary level three master of the universe.

However, Wang Xian’s speed was ten times faster than his!

Under such terrifying speed, unless he was given enough time, he wouldn’t be able to escape in a short period of time!

“How is this possible? How can you tell the location of my main body!”

Ming Shasheng’s expression changed drastically when he saw Wang Xian attacking his main body once again!

He could switch positions in his netherspirit’s clone, but this was not unlimited!

Furthermore, the distance between the main body and the clone was not unlimited!

Although this separation was far enough, there was still a limit!

Once he could be locked onto by the Dragon King, it would be difficult for him to escape with the Dragon King’s speed!

“I don’t believe that you can lock onto me forever!”

Ming shasheng gritted his teeth and more than 200 clones escaped in all directions at the fastest speed!

Bam

Wang Xian came to the position of his main body and swept his dragon claws once again!

However, this time, Ming Shasheng’s main body still disappeared instantly!

This ability was similar to teleportation. His clones were the medium for teleportation!

“HMPH!”

Wang Xian snorted softly. Through the lock-on of the primaless saint wings, he locked onto another Netherworld ghost doppelganger and attacked him.

I still have eight more chances. The possibility of me escaping is still very high

When Ming Shisheng saw Wang Xian locking onto his main body again, he thought to himself and calculated the distance between each of his Netherworld Ghost Doppelganger!

Whoosh

At this moment, his body was locked onto as a chain swept towards him.

Without any hesitation, Ming Shasheng used the energy conversion again and his avatars dissipated!

Buzz

Wang Xian moved his palm and the five elements millstone appeared in his hand. He flew towards the dozens of Netherspirit avatars!

His body moved and he flew towards Ming Shasheng’s main body once again!

“I’m locked on again. How far is his lock on? Damn it, the treasure in his hand is so terrifying. I Can’t teleport in that direction anymore. I have to retrieve the Netherspirit Avatars!”

Ming Shaisheng’s expression was extremely ugly. He could feel the terrifying energy and pressure from the five elements Millstone!

This was not something that his dozens of netherspirit avatars could contend against!

In order to kill his avatars, he could only retrieve them!

Once he reaped the rewards, there would be one less direction for him to escape to!

“Huala!”

“Ming Shasheng, I’ve said it before. You can’t escape unless you can transfer your main body without any restrictions!”

Wang Xian chased after his main body once again and said indifferently!

“Damn it!”

Ming Shisheng’s face was gloomy. He could only teleport again!

However, Wang Xian’s figure locked onto him again very quickly. He teleported again!

“I don’t think I can lock onto him, right? My two clones are already at the limit of their distance. Even if I fly by myself, I still need two minutes!”

Ming shisheng roared in a low voice with blood-red eyes as he teleported for the last time!

This shift was two minutes away from his original position!

This two minutes required him to fly at the fastest speed possible!

If he could still be locked on, then he would be finished!

“This Dragon King is simply too abnormal. Be it speed or treasures, no wonder the old witch and water demon were subdued by him. He’s too strong!”

He flew with all his might as he thought to himself!

“Can I still teleport?”

However, after more than ten seconds, a voice that terrified him sounded behind him. This caused his body to tremble violently, and the dark power in his body shook for a moment!

It’s over!

“I. . . Dragon King, I surrender, I surrender!”

Ming Shasheng was on the verge of collapse as he roared.

His transfer ability had been pushed to the limit. He could not continue to transfer anymore. If he was killed by the Dragon King, he would really die!

He had already found a way to break through. It would not be long before he could break through!

Should he let him die now?

How could he be willing to do so!

He had waited for billions of years to break through to the ruler realm. Should he let him die now?

It was better to submit!

“Hehe, what are you doing earlier?”

Wang Xian smiled faintly. With a move of his palm, a drop of blood essence landed in front of him.

“Consume it and summon the universe God Nation over!”

Wang Xian ordered him!

“Yes, yes, Dragon King. I have completely submitted to you. I have decided to treat you as my king in the future!”

Ming Shasheng was helpless. He had no other choice but to say that!

If I submit, so be it. Fortunately, I can make a breakthrough!

Ming Shasheng’s submission made Wang Xian smile.

“Let’s go. Follow me back. There’s still an old crazy demon over there!”

Wang Xian said indifferently. He brought Ming Shasheng and flew quickly toward the ancient Hengxu divine kingdom!

When he arrived at the ancient Hengxu Divine Kingdom, the demonic wings were constantly defending against the attacks of the water demon old witch and Wang Xian’s four netherspirit avatars!

However, he was completely suppressed!

Even if he was killed, it was only a matter of time!
