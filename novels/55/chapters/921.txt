Chapter 922: 0923 made another strong enemy

Translator: 549690339

There were more than ten members of the Knife Scar mercenary group. The strongest one was at level six, while the remaining two were at level five and ten were at level four.

This force could be ranked in the top three in Shenghai town. However, this was only a part of the strength of the knife scar mercenary group.

The more than ten members of the Knife Scar mercenary group clearly recognized Wang Xian and the rest.

The leader of the powerful mercenary group was in the limelight. He was a peerless genius with dual attributes.

It could be said that in today’s battle, Wang Xian would be the brightest star among the younger generation in the entire holy sea town.

However, they didn’t have Wang Xian and the rest.

Peerless Genius?

Destroy the Mirage Sea mercenary group?

So what?

In front of their knife scar mercenary group, what was he?

For a mercenary group like Mirage Sea, their knife scar could destroy ten of them.

Even if the young man in front of them was in the limelight and was the most dazzling young man, they were not afraid of him at all.

A threat, a blatant threat.

More than ten members of the knife marks mercenary group threatened him without hiding anything.

Wang Xian paused for a moment and looked at the dozen of people standing beside the Phoenix Immortal Shop. The corners of his mouth curled up slightly.

“What I want to do is none of your business.”

Wang Xian stared at the dozen of people coldly and said with slight disdain.

Boom

In an instant, the expressions of the dozen of people from the knife scar mercenary group turned cold. Their eyes were filled with killing intent as they stared at Wang Xian.

“Hehe!”

Wang Xian glanced at them indifferently and continued to walk towards the shop.

“Have you heard of the saying, ‘kill the chicken to warn the monkeys’?”

A middle-aged man from the knife scar mercenary group threatened Wang Xian coldly, “Don’t think that you are strong just because you have some ability. Don’t think that you are strong in Shenghai town just because the people around you respect you. Hehe!”

“Do I need to report what I want to Do to you? Do I need your approval?”

Wang Xian glanced at them with disdain.

“Young Master!”

Shopkeeper Liu was slightly stunned when he saw Wang Xian walking towards them and the conversation with the knife scar mercenary group. He quickly shouted.

The woman beside him was also sizing up Wang Xian with a face full of astonishment.

He had an imposing manner and had a unique aura of a superior.

The people around also saw this scene. They looked at Wang Xian and the dozen of knife scar mercenaries with astonishment.

“Why? Why did the Celestial Phoenix mercenary group have a conflict with the knife scar mercenary group? This... this...”

An old man was stunned. Why would a rising star like the Celestial Phoenix mercenary group have a conflict with the knife scar mercenary group.

This was an unwise thing to do. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that they were courting death.

Moreover, the knife scar mercenary group wasn’t something the Mirage sea mercenary group could compare to. The difference in strength between the two was huge.

“The leader of the Immortal Phoenix mercenary group has such a violent temper. He directly retorted back when faced with the threat of blade scar and the other experts. Isn’t he afraid that blade scar will attack them?”

“It’s irrational. It’s simply too irrational. As a genius, he must first ensure that he can survive before he can become an expert. It’s clearly courting death to make enemies everywhere!”

“This is too arrogant. For the knife scar mercenary group to become the number one mercenary group in Holy Sea Town, their strength is definitely not something that a newly emerged mercenary group can afford to provoke. Even if they are a Peerless Heaven’s pride or a monster, they can’t do it!”

Discussions could be heard from the surroundings.

The members of the knife scar mercenary group and shopkeeper Qing from the life and Death Pill workshop beside the Knife Scar also stared at Wang Xian coldly.

Last time, he took out eight million spiritual stones and directly slapped the faces of the life and Death Elixir Workshop and the holy item forging workshop. Now that he had provoked them again, they were filled with killing intent.

“Shopkeeper Liu, do you guys want to buy some weapons? Also, I want to buy some elixirs!”

Wang Xian directly told shopkeeper Liu All the spiritual stones.

“Weapons?”

Shopkeeper Liu glanced at the woman beside him and nodded immediately after she nodded.

“Yes, young master. Thank you for choosing a small shop under such circumstances. In the future, you will get a 20% discount for all items you buy from Fengxian!”

Shopkeeper Liu said hurriedly, “These are some elixirs that we brought from Donghai city overnight. I will help you choose them now. The price of weapons will be the market price!”

“Okay!”

Wang Xian nodded and passed an interspatial ring to shopkeeper Liu.

“Little brother, May I know what is the relationship between you and our Fengxian?”

The woman beside him was surprised when she saw Wang Xian taking out a minimum of two million spirit stones. She couldn’t help but ask.

He had spent 11 million middle-grade spirit stones for three purchases. Such a huge sum of money and he was being threatened. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

If she said that he had no relationship with their Fengxian, she wouldn’t believe it.

Moreover, the name of the other party’s mercenary group was the exact opposite of the name of Feng Xian.

“There is some connection. If there is a chance in the future, you will know about it!”

Wang Xian smiled mysteriously. He did not say that he knew your master, Feng Luan.

Compared to Feng Luan, Wang Xian was still too weak. He thought that when his strength was on par with her, he would call her over and compare their strengths.

The woman was slightly stunned and felt very surprised.

However, she could feel a trace of goodwill from Wang Xian.

“Captain Dao Hen, that kid has repeatedly refused to give you guys face. Is It...”

Meanwhile, at the side.

When shopkeeper Qing saw Wang Xian taking out a large amount of resources again, a hint of heat flashed in her eyes.

However, when she saw Wang Xian’s face, her expression turned cold again. She said to Dao Hen who was beside her with a murderous aura.

“This kid is playing with fire and setting himself on fire!”

Dao Hen glanced at Wang Xian with one eye. There was no fluctuation in his eyes as he declared coldly.

“I’m relieved with Captain Dao Hen’s words!”

Shopkeeper Qing nodded with a smile on his face. He swept his gaze across Wang Xian and snorted coldly, “HMPH, there are some disputes that a kid like you can not participate in. Even if it’s a kid with monstrous talent!”

“The second wave of the city defense mission begins. The weakest ones are the thousand-legged fish and the raging sea crab with level two extraordinary strength!”

At this moment, Jin Qianyuan’s voice came from the city wall.

“Mission begins.”

1:5-star gold mission: exit the city to battle and kill the ferocious beasts. Based on the number of ferocious beasts killed, you will obtain additional points. The carcass of the ferocious beast will belong to the Slayer!

[2: silver 1-star mission: stand on the city wall and attack from afar. Based on the number of berserk beasts killed, additional points will be awarded. The corpse of the berserk beast will belong to the Slayer! ]!

[ additional points: 1 point for a Tier 1 berserk beast, 10 points for a tier 2,100 points for a Tier 3, and 1,000 points for a Tier 4. ]!

The voice of the President of the Mercenary Association sounded. At the same time, the second wave of the city defense mission began.

Everyone immediately flew into the air and looked at the ferocious beasts in the distance.

There were two types of ferocious beasts, the thousand-legged fish. The lowest level was transcendent-2, and there were around 70,000 to 80,000 of them.

The Inferno Sea Crab was at transcendent-2, and there were around 40,000 to 50,000 of them.

Although there were fewer of them, their strength was dozens of times greater than before.

The danger of this mission was ten times greater than before!
