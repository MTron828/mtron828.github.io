“Peng!”

As soon as the old man finished speaking, a loud sound was heard.

The old man’s seven orifices started to bleed.

“He committed suicide?”

“I didn’t expect him to commit suicide directly. This dragon assassin organization is not simple!”

“This old man should be a spy, a spy who collects commission. He is not an assassin. An ordinary spy should not know what is inside the dragon spike, but he still committed suicide. It seems that the training of this dragon spike is very strict!”

“No matter how strict it is, when the city Lord’s mansion makes a move, they will use the city’s great formation to watch every corner. No matter how deep the dragon Spike is hidden, it will still be discovered!”

“That’s right. The city Lord’s mansion has the city lord who is at the profound void realm. With the addition of the formation, no one will be able to hide!”

When the surrounding people saw that the old man actually committed suicide, surprise appeared on their faces, and they discussed among themselves.

The surrounding city guards frowned slightly and looked a little embarrassed. The city guard in the center immediately took out his communication stone plate and sent a message.

He wanted to remind the other team of people who were in contact with the secret agent of the dragon Spike to stop them from committing suicide.

When Wang Xian saw this scene, he walked toward his residence with an embarrassed expression.

The mayor’s residence actually interfered. A powerhouse at the insightful void tier actually wanted to deal with them.

To them, this was bad news that couldn’t be any worse.

The mayor was the mayor of a city. He possessed power that exceeded everyone’s imagination.

The mayor could mobilize all the formations and city guards of the entire East Sea city to monitor the entire East Sea city.

His authority was even greater than that of the commander who was in charge of the Marine Corps.

The number of city guards in the East Sea city was as high as 10,000 people. Coupled with the surveillance of the formations, as well as the people who pretended to give out missions on purpose today, they were here to Exchange Commission with the spy.

In the future, it would be much more difficult for the dragon spike to stay in the East Sea city.

“However, the dragon Spike has the ability to ignore formations. It is a very powerful supernatural ability. It is easy for them to evade the surveillance of the formations. However, if they pretend to be their employer and issue an assassination mission, they can easily pull out the spy!”

Wang Xian’s face was solemn as he walked towards his residence.

“Dragon King!”

The group of Drakonids saw him and greeted him immediately.

“Yes!”

Wang Xian nodded and looked at them. “A spy has been captured by the city guards. Be careful!”

“What?”

The group of Drakonids was slightly shocked as their faces turned solemn.

“Dragon King, the Mayor’s residence has interfered. What should we do?”

Long Yi asked with a slightly embarrassed expression.

“Ao Yao, if there are experts at the insightful void level, can they discover you?”

Wang Xian hesitated for a moment and didn’t answer him. Instead, he asked Ao Yao.

“If it’s me, unless the insightful void level experts search carefully, it won’t be easy for them to discover me. If it’s another strange demon, the insightful void level experts might sense me.”

Ao Yao answered directly.

“Is that so?”

Wang Xian nodded slowly and pondered for a moment. “If your strength improves a little, can the insightful emptiness realm experts discover you?”

“Dragon King, in Donghai City, the two insightful emptiness realm experts are at the first level of the insightful emptiness realm. If my strength can improve, I can completely deceive them!”

Ao Yao said confidently.

“Alright. In that case, it will be tough on you alone for the next few days!”

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered. He swallowed all the pills and turned them into dragon crystals to increase ao Yao’s strength.

Crack! Crack! Crack

Half an hour later, the body of the strange demon became longer and longer. The Light and darkness on its body became purer.

It was like sunlight, like black ink.

The first level ao Yao comprehended the divine ability, light and darkness.

The second level comprehended the divine ability, light and darkness.

The third level comprehended the divine ability, piercing eyes.

The fourth level comprehended the divine ability, light and darkness interweaved.

The fifth level comprehended the divine ability, light and darkness.

The sixth level comprehended the divine ability, light and darkness burst.

And now that he had broken through to the seventh level of transcendence, Ao Yao had comprehended another divine ability.

Light and shadow escape.

Light and shadow escape. As long as there was light and darkness, he could teleport within a 2,000-meter radius.

He could teleport to any place within a 2,000-meter radius in the blink of an eye.

It was definitely a very powerful supernatural ability.

Regardless of whether it was an assassination or escape, it was very abnormal.

“Thank you, Dragon King!”

Ao Yao knelt respectfully beside Wang Xian and thanked him.

“Get up. I’ll be counting on you for the next few days!”

Wang Xian waved his hand.

Initially, Wang Xian didn’t plan to expend so many resources to increase ao Yao’s strength. However, the actions of the Castellan’s residence had interrupted his plan.

“However, don’t think that the Castellan’s residence can stop the assassination attempt by dragon Spike!”

“If you offend dragon spike, even if it’s the castellan’s residence or a powerhouse at the level of the Void interpretation stage, you have to submit obediently!”

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered. He looked at Ao Yao with a ruthless expression.

“Ao Yao, later on, you will assassinate ten city guards in the busy city and place a few pieces of paper beside them!”

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Ao Yao nodded.

“Since the city Lord’s mansion wants to get rid of us, we will bring them panic and despair!”

Wang Xian’s face turned cold.

“Dragon King, we have just contacted the spies. We have lost contact with one of them!”

At this moment, Long Yi walked over and said with an awkward expression.

“He should be dead or captured by the city guards!”

When Wang Xian heard this news, his expression turned ugly as well. He wasn’t worried that the spies would leak anything if they were captured.

These spies were already controlled. Even if they were to die, they wouldn’t leak anything.

However, the actions of the city Lord’s mansion made him very angry.

This brought him great trouble.

“Very soon, very soon, I’ll let you know what regret is!”

...

Behind the city Lord’s mansion, there was a cell. Inside the cell were all sorts of people who had committed crimes. Once they broke the city rules, they were all sent to the cell.

East Sea city had five cells. Only the cell behind the city Lord’s mansion was full of people who had committed serious crimes.

At this moment, in the interrogation room of the prison cell, an old man was hanging there miserably.

The torture instruments around him looked shocking. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Captain, this old man’s teeth are too tight. All the torture instruments and all the punishments have been changed. It’s as if his soul has been controlled!”

A young man walked out with an ugly expression and reported to a middle-aged man.

“Oh? All the torture devices have been used, and you still refuse to admit it?”

The middle-aged man frowned, and a serious expression appeared on his face.

The city guards had captured two spies of the dragon spike. One had committed suicide on the spot, and the other had been controlled in time.

However, what they didn’t expect was that the spy’s mouth was actually so hard!

They were very clear about the torture devices here, not to mention an old man who hadn’t reached the transcendence realm.

Even if a transcendent level 9 powerhouse came here, he would have to spit out what underwear he wore.

How did an old man do it?
