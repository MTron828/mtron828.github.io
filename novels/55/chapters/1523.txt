Chapter 1524: 1,524 voices spread far and wide

“It’s done, it’s completely done. That Bastard Jiang Han, he actually used such a heavy hand when sparring with me. Let’s go, this time I want to go back and take revenge!”

Rays of light fell on the big man’s arm, and in less than a minute, his arm had completely recovered.

He moved his arm, and a smile appeared on his face as he cursed.

“Awesome, so handsome!”

The two girls who received him at the back looked at each other and whispered to each other.

“Thank you, master priest. You have reached the insightful emptiness realm at such a young age. You are truly the pride of the Heavens!”

A few burly men cupped their hands at Wang Xian and handed over the spiritual stones to Lao Hu before leaving.

“No, no, 800,000 high-grade spiritual stones is too expensive. Let’s go, Let’s Go!”

“No, we have enough money. We have enough money to sell the place where we live. It’s enough, it’s enough. Treat it, we’ll treat it!”

“Father, hurry up and treat it. The black water poison will enter the body through the blood circulation if we don’t treat it for a long time. We have to treat it!”

“It’s fine, it’s fine. Just cut off your arm!”

“Your Arm is broken? How are we going to live in the future?”

The sounds of debate rang out. Wang Xian sat inside and looked at the three people standing outside.

When he saw the middle-aged man’s last words, the middle-aged man sighed helplessly.

“If the black water poison is serious, it might cost at least 1.5 million upper-grade spirit stones!”

At this moment, Old Hu, who was standing at the side, looked at the middle-aged man’s rotten arm and said faintly.

He had seen too many of such things in the medical center.

There were many people who didn’t have any spirit stones to treat them. Some even died because of it.

However, the medical center wasn’t a charitable place. Without Spirit Stones, which priest of light would be willing to expend energy to treat you.

“What? 1.5 million upper-grade spirit stones? No... No...”

When the three of them heard Old Hu’s words, their bodies couldn’t help but tremble. They felt as though their bodies had collapsed.

“How much do you have in your hands now?”

Wang Xian sat there and asked them calmly.

“We... We only have 100,000 upper-grade spirit stones. If we were to sell some of the things in the house, we can only gather 800,000 at most!”

The woman lowered her head and said in despair.

“Give me half of the Spirit Stones in your hands!”

As Wang Xian spoke, he waved his arm gently.

“Puchi!”

Before the middle-aged man could react, both of his arms were cut off by Wang Xian.

Following that, he felt a ray of light enveloping his body.

Under his disbelief, both of his arms grew out slowly.

Old Hu who was at the side was stunned. Even the female receptionist behind him was stunned.

“Leave half of the spiritual stones behind. Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian waved his arm and the two arms that were completely corroded by the black water poison flew in front of him.

He sized them up silently.

“Thank you, thank you, sir. Thank you!”

“Thank you, priest. Thank you, thank you!”

The woman, the woman, and the middle-aged man were completely stunned. When they saw that the arms had completely grown out, they were excited.

The three of them quickly knelt on the ground and thanked him loudly.

Wang Xian smiled and didn’t say anything.

Old Hu’s eyes flickered as he looked at the three of them. “Alright, Reverend Wang, you guys look pitiful. Give me 50,000 high-grade spirit stones. Let’s Go!”

“Thank you, thank you, Reverend Wang. Here, we’ll give all the Spirit Stones to you, Reverend Wang!”

“Only 50,000. Leave immediately and don’t disturb us!”

Old Hu said coldly.

“Yes, yes. Thank you, thank you!”

The three of them said gratefully. With bloodshot eyes, they stood up and bowed. They left in tears of joy.

“He is so caring. Not only is he strong and handsome, he is also so caring. He is just like Prince Charming!”

The receptionist girl who brought the three of them looked at Wang Xian, who was sitting there, and her eyes lit up.

Wang Xian did not look outside. Instead, he stared quietly at the arm that was corroded by the dark energy in front of him.

Wang Xian was not bothered by the fact that he was treating them for free.

He was not in need of spirit stones. He did not care about a hundred million or even one billion upper-grade spirit stones.

After destroying the ancient demon city, the amount of resources, treasures, and spirit stones in his interspatial ring was a terrifying number.

The most important thing for him now was the balance between light and darkness.

Buzz! Buzz

Wang Xian waved his arm and the light energy landed on it, emitting a melting sound.

“That middle-aged man is a cultivator of the light attribute. He was eroded by the darkness and 99% of his entire arm has been crippled. However, there are still a few interesting aspects!”

Wang Xian observed and observed.

He realized that under the condition of equal light and darkness, the darkness could not extinguish the light and neither could the light extinguish the darkness. Under such a stalemate, it would form a rotation. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

It was just like Tai Chi!

“The five elements can be fused together due to the fact that they are mutually compatible. However, in essence, the five elements are also mutually exclusive. Light and darkness are not mutually exclusive and can only be mutually exclusive. It is not that they can not be merged. It is just like Tai Chi!”

Wang Xian mumbled. He waved his arm and rays of light landed on his arms.

He wanted to try to use the power of light to completely restore his two arms.

“Pastor Wang, there are more patients!”

In the afternoon, Wang Xian received two more patients and healed them very quickly.

He spent the rest of his time studying the two arms.

In the evening, the news of Wang Xian’s selfless treatment of a middle-aged man spread in the clinic. The girls chatted excitedly.

However, Wang Xian stayed on the fourth floor and didn’t go out. Many people didn’t see his real face.

This made many girls look regretful. They wondered if they should go up and take a look.

However, they didn’t dare to.

For two consecutive days, Wang Xian received a total of more than ten patients. Some of them had the dark energy of powerful demonic beasts in their bodies.

Some of them needed to regrow their severed limbs.

In short, these were all questions that Wang Xian thought were very simple.

“Pastor Wang, this is the Brocade banner that the middle-aged man that you treated sent over on the first day. They said that we can not repay your kindness and can only send a small brocade banner!”

On this afternoon, Old Hu walked over with a banner in his hand and said with a smile on his face.

“Uncle Hu, help me put it there!”

Wang Xian looked at the banner and said with a smile.

“Eh? You actually completely recovered that rotten arm!”

At this moment, old Hu looked in front of Wang Xian with a shocked expression.

On the other side, the rotten arm that he had cut off from the middle-aged man looked just like an ordinary arm today. It was still emitting a faint vitality.

This was simply unbelievable!

“HMM!”

Wang Xian looked at the arm in front of him and sensed the location of his heart. After a few days of understanding and tempering of light, the light in the heart of Light and darkness had reached about 25% .

It wouldn’t take long for him to achieve a balance between light and darkness.
