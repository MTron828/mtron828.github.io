Chapter 611: He Is The Dragon King (2)

“This ends our Grand Disciple Tournament of Yong Chang Immortal Sect. Disciples in the top thirty, please make your way up Talent Peak!”

“Default disciples within the three major Immortal Sects to enter the Yong Chang Cauldron, please make your way up Talent Peak!”

The voice of the referee echoed within an area with a radius of more than a dozen kilometers as he remained on the sparring stage, once all the placings had been finalized.

All the disciples heard the announcement loud and clear.

“Disciples in the top thirty...they are the thirty strongest disciples within all of Yong Chang. How I envy them!”

“It’s all glory and achievement for these thirty most outstanding ones within the entire Yong Chang!”

“The top 10 are qualified to enter the Yong Chang Cauldron. This is a massive resource we’re talking about. In addition, there’re three default disciples appointed within the three Immortal Sects. I wonder who they are!”

“The default disciple within the Yong Chang Immortal Sect is Junior Sister Xiaoxiao, without a doubt. As for Immortal Slaying Sect, it should be Lu Qianfeng. At the mere age of twenty, he already possesses Dan Realm prowess. Such an incredible natural gift. Rumor has it that he’s the default disciple!”

“While the one for Da Hong Immortal Sect remains unknown.”

The discussion began to fire up amongst the crowd which was made up of hundreds of thousands of disciples. The entire area was sent into utter chaos.

“Let’s go!”

“Congrats, Senior Brother Ge Wen. To think that Roving Sword still knows his limits. In knowing that he is no match for you, he chose to concede defeat immediately!”

“Haha, as I said, Senior Brother Ge Wen will definitely emerge as the top in this tournament as the Lead Disciple of the three major Immortal Sects!”

Several disciples congratulated Ge Wen as they stood atop the summit where all the outstanding young heroes had gathered.

“Haha, I intended to spar against that Roving Sword. Little did I expect him to throw in the towel. He sure knows his limits, haha!”

Ge Wen roared with laughter with his head held high. He was wearing gloves the color of crimson while holding onto the Flaming Spear.

There he was, as though he was the Flaming God of War.

With a face full of self-conceit, he scanned his surroundings while revealing a faint smile.

He would emerge as the Lead Disciple of the three major Immortal Sects after today, which was an unparalleled honor.

“Let’s go, Grand Senior Brother!”

One of the disciples gestured with a smile. In one swift shuffle, he leaped onto a long sword and flew towards another summit which stood beside the current sparring stage.

“Let’s go!”

The crowd of outstanding young heroes flew off. In an instant, their movement attracted the stares of the hundreds of thousands of disciples as they looked at the group with the utmost envy and respect.

“Be on your way now, Xiaoxiao!”

The Guild Leader of the Sacred Followers Guild laughed as he spoke when he saw that the former had yet to take her leave as they remained on the summit.

“Father, you said you had a set of Spiritual Equipment and armor refined for me. I’m going to put them on today, haha!”

Xiaoxiao grinned from ear to ear before flying in another direction.

“Elder Wang, please get going!” the Great Elder said to Wang Xian with a smile, as the duo stood atop the elders’ summit that belonged to Da Hong Immortal Sect.

“Alright, Elders. I’ll head over then!” Wang Xian replied pleasantly. With a change of stance, he took off in the direction of the mountain which stood at the center.

“Haha!”

Several elders from Da Hong Immortal Sect watched from behind Wang Xian with a tinge of envy.

That said, one of the elders frowned as he watched Wang Xian making his way over. He looked on with an even darker expression.

Whizz!

“Dragon King!”

As Wang Xian flew over to the centermost mountain, he was greeted by the voice of Roving Sword.

“Eh? Roving Sword, why did you concede defeat at the last minute?” Wang Xian asked in utter confusion as he looked at Roving Sword with furrowed brows.

“It’s the several Elders from Immortal Slaying Sect. They threw in the towel directly, and only informed me after conceding defeat!” Roving Sword replied emotionlessly. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“They got you to concede defeat?”

Wang Xian was taken by surprise. To which, he continued, “It’s alright, so long as you can make it into the Yong Chang Cauldron!”

“Yes, Dragon King!”

Roving Sword nodded in response.

As the two shifted, they arrived at the peak of the centermost mountain.

As they stood on the platform of the summit, they could see the hundreds of thousands of disciples at a glance. As the platform was relatively small, the crowd of disciples below could also make out the outline of those atop the platform.

“Congratulations, Senior Brother Ge Wen, for becoming the Lead Disciple of the three major Immortal Sects. The strongest contender amongst all current disciples!”

“Truly deserving of the title, Senior Brother Ge Wen!”

As they reached the stage, Wang Xian could see the crowd who had gathered to extend their best wishes to Ge Wen.

“Haha!”

At the sight, Wang Xian snorted in dismissal as he stood by the side.

“Junior Brother Hong, which is the Dragon King whom you were talking about? The one who made you think he was one we couldn’t match up to? Show him to me!”

Just then, Ge Wen spoke in a standoffish tone.

Amongst the disciples of the three major Immortal Sects, one’s position would not be based on age, but rather capabilities alone. The one to emerge as the strongest would ascend to become the Senior disciple.

Ge Wen had asked the question indifferently while surveying his surroundings where his gaze eventually landed on Roving Sword and Wang Xian.

“That’s right, which of them is it? Is it that young chap beside Roving Sword? That’s him? Dragon King of the Da Hong Immortal Sect?”

Another young man spoke with a faint smirk while standing beside Ge Wen as he turned over to look at Wang Xian as well.

The stage was relatively small, hence one could see everyone around with a brief glance.

Amongst which, Wang Xian stood out as the only stranger, one whom they had never met before.

“Ge Wen, you are no match for him!” Hong Tianda said to Ge Wen in a flat tone as he watched Ge Wen, locking his brows.

“Oh, is that so? I’ll see for myself then. During the matches this time around, Junior Sister Huo conceded defeat at the last minute. While Roving Heavens, who defeated you, had to concede defeat towards me. How upsetting! If possible, I wouldn’t mind having someone to practice with!”

Ge Wen rebutted with his head held high while he placed his spear on his back.

The title of the Lead Disciple of the three major Immortal Sects, along with the concession of defeat from Roving Sword, had built up his self-conceit and ego.

But then again, he had the means to.

He smirked as he looked at Wang Xian before making his way over with a smile. “Hi, Junior, I’m Ge Wen. Junior Brother Hong has been speaking highly of you, so I decided to come over and take a look!”

“Oh, hello there!”

Wang Xian nodded briefly as he looked at Ge Wen.

“He said that your prowess is above mine. So I’ve come to test it out myself and to help Junior Brother Hong correct his mistake,” Ge Wen continued. “That I, Ge Wen, am actually the most powerful!”

Ge Wen enunciated every word of his last sentence with extra emphasis while looking at Wang Xian with the utmost dominance.

Meanwhile, the crowd of disciples looked upon the domineering Ge Wen, who was surging with pride, in complete admiration.

“This should be the dominance expected from the Lead Disciple of the three major Immortal Sects!”

“That’s right, Senior Brother Ge Wen’s truly formidable. Just based on this thought of his, that he’s unrivaled, it’s already something which no one can compare to alone!”

“Truly admirable!”

The crowd of disciples from the three Immortal Sects heaved a sigh of envy and self-resignation.

During his last two matches in the Grand Disciple Tournament amongst the three Immortal Sects this time, the opponents proceeded to concede defeat without Senior Brother Ge Wen even having to lift a finger.

For they knew that they were not his match.

And yet, Hong Tianda was now saying that Senior Brother Ge Wen was no match for the Dragon King.

Hence, Ge Wen decided to challenge Wang Xian. Such was the dominance and aura from the strongest contender of the current times!

“If you say you’re the most powerful, then so be it!”

Wang Xian replied to Ge Wen flatly. He had intended to leave right after entering the Yong Chang Cauldron this time and wanted no trouble.

He had even less interest in pitting himself against a chap who he could crush as easily as the pinching of his fingers!

“Huh?”

Upon seeing the attitude coming from Wang Xian, Ge Wen frowned. “I never admit to being the most powerful through words, but prove it through action. You can test it out yourself if you are unconvinced, junior!”

Thereafter, he continued indifferently. “And let us see for ourselves what prowess you possess, which gave you the right to be appointed as the default disciple by the Da Hong Immortal Sect to enter the Yong Chang Cauldron!”

The crowd laughed in jest as they watched the spectacle while eyeing Wang Xian with the utmost curiosity.

“Just you alone have no right to challenge the Dragon King!” Roving Sword retorted coldly upon seeing how snobbish Ge Wen was while speaking to his beloved Dragon King.
