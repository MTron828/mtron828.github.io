“Lord Sword Emperor, there’s news from the Sky Mountain Business Planet, there are over 100 undying godly monarchs, of which there’s A Level 6 undying, the rest are on par with the Guardian Elder and the rest, requesting quick reinforcements!” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Within the Sky Mountain Sword sect grounds, an elder reported with an ugly expression!

“Immediately inform the forefathers to take action, bring all the restraints of the sect, this time we’ll make sure they never return, if they dare to cause trouble on Our Sky Mountain Business Planet, we’ll make sure they all die!”

The Sword King’s face was filled with rage as he roared. His body moved, and he immediately flew out!

“Whoosh!”

However, just as he flew into the sky, a resplendent arrow shot toward him!

The arrow shattered the void, leaving a long mark in the void as it instantly landed beside the sword King!

“Who’s courting death!”

The sword light waved his arm, and a blood-red sword appeared in his hand. He thrust it forward!

“Peng!”

In an instant, the arrows clashed with the tip of the sword, resulting in a loud clash!

“Weng!”

Sword Emperor’s body flew back over 10,000 meters!

“Undying Level 7 warrior, Archer!”

Sword Emperor’s expression changed, his gaze fixed on the space ahead!

“Sou Sou Sou!”

In the next moment, another 3 arrows shot towards him, the 3 arrows flew in space, gradually turning into 3 terrifying wind dragons!

The three wind dragons intertwined together and roared!

“Kill!”

“No one has dared to challenge my sword king for hundreds of thousands of years. Today, I will kill you!”

The blood-red sword slashed forward as the sword king roared with murderous intent!

“Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!”

However, at this moment, countless arrows flew toward the Sky Mountain Sword sect. Each arrow carried a terrifying power of Law!

“Someone dares to invade our Sky Mountain Sword sect, is it the Dragon Palace?”

“All Disciples of the Sky Mountain Sword sect, prepare to fight!”

Within the Sky Mountain Sword sect, arrows attacked sword emperor, the sky was filled with arrows attacking, causing the entire sky mountain sword sect to move!

Countless warriors immediately flew into the sky, staring coldly ahead!

“Who dares to attack our Sky Mountain Sword sect, are you courting death?”

Behind them, two undying level 7 ancestors roared angrily. At the same time, an overwhelming killing intent rushed up to Ling Xiao!

“Hahaha, the one attacking is your Sky Mountain Sword sect!”

At this time, Ao Qi, Mu Ze Sen and Ao Xing Mu flew towards them and said coldly!

“Who are you?”

Seeing the three undying level 7 warriors, sword Emperor and the Rest’s pupils shrank, their faces dark as they roared!

“They attacked our Dragon Palace not long ago, and now they’re asking us who we are?”

Mu Ze Sen held his bow, his gaze locked on the three of them, filled with coldness!

“What? Dragon Palace Warrior!”

“Dragon Palace! There are so many undying level 7 warriors in the Dragon Palace?”

When the Sky Mountain Sword sect members heard Mu Ze Sen’s words, their expressions changed as they exclaimed!

“Dragon Palace? You guys are actually from the Dragon Palace, good, good, good. If you don’t hide within the array and still dare to come out, die for this sword Emperor!”

“Devil punishing sword!”

A cold roar came out of Sword Emperor’s mouth as he stared coldly at Mu Ze Sen and the other two!

“Kill, you dare to cause trouble in Our Sky Mountain Sword sect!”

The other two forefathers’eyes were filled with killing intent as they attacked Ao qi and ao Xing Mu!

“Attack, let the Sky Mountain Sword sect know the consequences of offending our Dragon Palace Today!”

Mu Zesen roared, following behind him were the members of the Sky Eye Arrow Division and the berserk dragon seed!

“Howl Howl Howl!”

The roars came from the members of the Dragon Palace, Ao Qi and the others immediately went to meet them!

“THE ENEMY HAS 3 undying level 7 warriors attacking us, we can hold them off here, let’s inform the other 2 ancestors to head to Tian Shan business planet to save us!”

Sword Emperor scanned his surroundings, seeing that there were only so many warriors in the Dragon Palace, he immediately ordered an elder!

“It’s Lord Sword Emperor!”

The elder immediately nodded and began to inform the other 2 ancestors!

At the same time, in an extremely hidden space crack in space, two majestic God countries were right next to each other!

“What? That person from the dragon palace actually dares to attack our sky mountain business planet, he’s courting death, Boss, kill him immediately!”

...

Within an undying God country, an elder flew out from his own God Country and roared at the Undying God country beside him!

“Kill!”

In the next moment, a Sky Mountain Sword sect elder flew out and roared with killing intent!

The two of them moved and swiftly flew towards the Sky Mountain Business Planet!

War broke out between the Sky Mountain Sword sect and the business planet, and in the star South Star System’s grade 9 Sky sect, their sect was also under attack!

Compared to them, the planet where the Jian Hua Group and the Black Forest Group were located was completely sealed!

A strange space covered the entire planet, everyone on the planet looked around in shock!

What exactly happened?

“What’s going on? This space, this space is the Dragon Palace’s strange space, it’s the people from the Dragon Palace who sealed our planet!”

It was on the Sky Mountain Sword Sect’s territory, the temporary base of the Alliance of the six powers!

Demon Slayer sect, three seas sect, Jian hua group, Black Forest Group, Sky Mountain Sword sect and grade 9 Sky sect all had many undying emperor warriors here!

...

Especially the demon Slayer sect and three seas sect, they had become stray dogs, there were 300 of them here!

Including the other four powers, there were a total of 600 undying Emperor Warriors!

Amongst them, there were even undying level 6 emperors!

However just now, the entire planet had suddenly become a strange space!

Seeing this space, the three seas sect leader and Demon Slayer sect leader’s pupils shrank, their faces filled with shock as they roared!

“All warriors and disciples get ready, it’s the Dragon Palace, it’s them!”

The Demon Slayer sect leader roared with killing intent!

It was this strange space that caused them to suffer heavy losses!

“The Dragon Palace? Are they seeking death? They actually dare to attack us!”

A Sky Mountain Sword sect warrior said coldly!

“Be careful, grade 9 Sky Sect, Sky Mountain Sword Sect, immediately inform the Undying Level 7 lords of the sect, the Dragon Palace has an undying level 7 warrior, if they attack us, we’ll be in Big Trouble!”

An expert couldn’t help but say!

“This strange space can’t transmit any news, I have a bad feeling!”

Demon Slayer sect’s sect master frowned and said with an embarrassed expression!

“Hahaha, don’t worry, the Dragon Palace has at most two or three level 7 undying godly monarchs, and they also need someone to guard the Dragon Planet. Our ninth grade sky sect has an ancestor on this planet!”

An elder of the ninth grade heaven sect said with a smile, his eyes scanning the surroundings with killing intent!

“Let’s go, I want to see how many experts the Dragon Palace has sent over, is it enough for us to kill!”
