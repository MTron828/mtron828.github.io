For the next ten million years, Wang Xian and the rest of the strong practitioners at the Heaven’s origin level would guide the cultivation of the water element disciples.

However, more than nine million years later.

A figure was floating in the air. His eyes flickered slightly.

Following that, Wang Xian and the rest could feel an extremely powerful force gushing out from his body.

Wang Xian looked over and his gaze landed on the body of the Fallen Shadow Demon Emperor. A look of astonishment appeared on his face.

At this moment, the energy in the body of the Fallen Shadow Demon Emperor was abnormally terrifying.

Even Wang Xian felt goosebumps all over his body!

“Senior Fallen Shadow, you’re back?”

The Unity Saint looked at the Fallen Shadow Demon Emperor and asked with a look of astonishment!

Although the fallen Shadow Demon Emperor had always been here, it was just an avatar of his.

This avatar had always been silent. Even in the past nine million years, he had only spoken a dozen words.

He did not give much guidance to the floating queen and the rest!

Wang Xian and the rest also knew that the main body of the fallen Shadow Demon Emperor was not here.

It was just an avatar.

Although it was an avatar, it had the strength of someone who had just entered the Heaven’s origin creation level.

The Fallen Shadow Demon Emperor was the strongest existence in the nine-origin universe.

He was an expert at the Great Dao level.

“Yes, I’m back. I’ve received some news from the outside.”

The Fallen Shadow Demon Emperor nodded and swept his gaze across the group. “It’s a rather big news. In a universe in the chaos, a treasure of the Heaven’s origin creation level is about to be born! ”

“What?”

Just as he finished his sentence, the emperor of angels, the Emperor of Phoenix, the Hetian saint, and even Wang Xian, who were seated at the side, revealed shocked expressions.

A supreme treasure of the Heaven’s origin creation?

A universe was about to give birth to a supreme treasure of this level?

This supreme treasure of the Heaven’s origin creation level was an existence that was much rarer than the powerhouses of the Heaven’s origin creation level.

In the nine-origin universe, Wang Xian also learned about it from the elven empress.

On the surface, the universe’s artificial intelligence was an ultimate treasure of the Heaven’s origin creation level. However, this ultimate treasure was too supportive and could not be tamed.

Currently, only the Hetian Sage had obtained its approval.

Even so, with the help of the power of the universe’s artificial intelligence, the Hetian Sage was able to erupt with power comparable to a powerhouse of the Heaven’s origin creation level in the nine-origin universe.

In addition, the elven empress also told him that the twelve ancestors of the Wizard clan should have a heavenly creation-level treasure in their hands.

Other than that, there was nothing else.

Even the fallen Shadow Demon Emperor did not have a heavenly creation-level treasure.

One could imagine how precious a heavenly creation-level treasure was!

It was a treasure that could make a heavenly creation-level powerhouse go all out.

The Divine Dragon clan and the insect clan had died together for a seedling of a

Heavenly Yuan creation treasure!

“Senior Shadow, have you entered that universe to explore?”

The Heavenly Yuan creation realm powerhouse from the royal clan asked Shadow Devil Emperor.

“I went in, but I was expelled from that universe and almost killed by that universe! ”

The Shadow Devil Emperor shook his head and said!

“What’s the situation?”

The Black Tortoise clan’s heavenly fate realm expert was slightly shocked. “Every universe has a protective mechanism, and there is a rule. ”

The shadow devil emperor replied, “If we want to enter another universe, our strength will be suppressed, and we will be suppressed by three levels. This is a rule. If we have special treasures, we can also avoid this rule. However, once we use a power that doesn’t belong to this universe in this universe, we will be sensed by this universe! ”

“Once I sense it, I will not only be suppressed by three levels, but I will also be attacked by this universe’s Heavenly Punishment!”

“A universe’s attack, a great dao level heavenly yuan creation, will not be able to withstand it. After I was attacked, my body was instantly destroyed. Fortunately, I have a treasure, so I was directly resurrected! ” The Fallen Shadow Demon Emperor said.

He was attacked not long ago and his body was directly destroyed!

This caused him to have some lingering fear.

Even if he had a trump card, he was still a little afraid of being directly destroyed by the Heaven ‘s punishment from the universe!

When Wang Xian heard the fallen Shadow Demon Emperor’s words, his eyes flickered slightly and a hint of astonishment appeared on his face!

“This must be the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace. His strength is not bad.

To be able to possess such strength at this level.”

When the Fallen Shadow Demon Emperor heard Wang Xian’s astonishment, he looked at him and sized him up with his three eyes.

The Fallen Shadow Demon Emperor was in the form of a human. However, his entire body was pitch-black and covered in scales.

A pair of demon horns and three blood-red eyes.

At this moment, it was sizing up Wang Xian with its eyes. Clearly, it could sense Wang Xian’s true realm!

The seventh level of the Universe Dominator!

With this realm, it would be able to possess the strength of someone who had just entered the destiny realm of the Heaven’s origin.

In that case, the eighth level of the universe dominator might be able to possess the power to control it.

The ninth level possessed the power of the Great Dao.

As for the peak… The Fallen Shadow Demon Emperor felt that it was considered an expert in the Great Dao.

However, he had yet to reach the level of chaos.

The Fallen Shadow Demon Emperor was somewhat certain of this.

The Heavenly Yuan creation realm powerhouses did not have a detailed division of their realms.

Everything was still being groped!

“Senior, you are too humble. I have a question. In another universe, there are treasures that can avoid the suppression of the universe. Why would they erupt into battle and be attacked by the Heavenly Punishment of the Universe?”

“I also unleashed my full strength in the other universe. I didn’t suffer any

attacks!”

Wang Xian asked with some doubt.

What the Fallen Shadow Demon Emperor said was completely different from what Wang Xian had encountered!

“Dragon King, did you achieve a breakthrough in your strength in that universe? Only in this situation would you not be punished by the Heavenly

Punishment of the other universe! ”

The Fallen Shadow Demon Emperor said.

“In fact, if there are treasures that can avoid the suppression of the universe, it is not a big problem to use the power of the Heaven’s origin creation. However, there is a prerequisite. You can not use it all the time. If you use it for a long time, it will be sensed. Also, the power you use can not exceed the power of the strongest person in this universe. ”

“Otherwise, you will be sensed by this universe. You are not a creature of this universe. ”

The Fallen Shadow Demon Emperor explained to him!

The Universe had rules. There was a limit to how many heaven origin manifestation powerhouses could be born in a universe.

Moreover, the birth of a heaven origin manifestation powerhouse would be recorded in this universe.

Originally, there were two heaven origin manifestation powerhouses in this universe and they were recorded by the universe’s rules. Later, when one suddenly appeared, it would naturally be discovered and detected.

There were treasures that could temporarily hide, but if you directly attacked the other two heaven origin destiny realm powerhouses, then the laws of the universe would be triggered and a heavenly punishment would descend!
