“Okay, thank you, Uncle!”

Wang Xian and Xiao Yu took a look at the stuff that the middle-aged uncle passed over. Both of them smiled and took some when they saw the fried brown sugar inside.

“We don’t have much at home. So, I got my daughter to bring some of the hometown specialty for her classmates. Here, try it!”

The middle-aged uncle gave a good-natured smile and passed on the food to the other two families.

Another two girls came with their parents. One of them was slightly plump, and so were her parents. Given their dressing, their family must not have been too poor.

The family closer to the balcony was obviously a wealthier family.

The girl was tall and slender with a good-looking face. She wore a large white tee with hot pants, revealing her fair thighs with a tattoo on her leg.

Her lips were brightly colored with lipstick.

Her mother’s dressing was trendy and she maintained her figure well.

Her father had a slight beer belly with a lavish dress sense, just like the way bosses would dress.

“Thank you.” The family members of the slightly plump girl nodded to the middle-aged uncle with a friendly look as they took some of the food.

“It’s okay for us.”

The mother of the tall and slender girl gestured, “You guys have it. We’ll skip.”

“Try them. Don’t stand a ceremony. They are tasty.” The middle-aged uncle raised his voice as he laughed.

“The taste is really good.” Wang Xian tasted some and nodded his head smilingly.

“I told you. This is our hometown specialty. But we’ve got a secret recipe, so they taste better than the rest.” When the middle-aged uncle heard what Wang Xian said, he beamed as he explained happily.

He raised the bag to the family who had declined earlier on.

“No, really.” The plump middle-aged man took a look at the cheap and unrefined plastic bag, frowning as he gestured his rejection.

“It’s okay, try it. I’ll pour you some for you to taste it.”

The middle-aged uncle stood up to share some of the food with them.

“I told you not to...” However, an impatient voice sounded off at this time. The middle-aged uncle froze with an unnatural expression on his face.

“You kid...” The lady spoke as she glared at her daughter. She laughed and said, “Fengya is not someone good with words.”

“Uncle, give it to me. It’s delicious, hehe.” Wang Xian chuckled as he stood up when he saw the middle-aged uncle was somewhat embarrassed.

“Great, go ahead. It’s nothing. Hehe.” The middle-aged uncle squeezed out a smile on his face, pretending that he did not hear what that girl had said.

He rubbed his palms together when he saw Wang Xian was eating. Feeling embarrassed, he said, “My daughter, Yuanyuan, is a little shy. I hope her classmates will take care of her and that they’ll get along well with each other. If you wish to have more sweets, let me know. I’ll get Yuanyuan to bring you some.”

“Yes, my daughter is Su Qian. She has a sweet tooth. Next time, you and Yuanyuan must get along with each other, along with other roommates,” Su Qian’s mother said with a smile.

“Yes, let’s get along with each other!” The middle-aged uncle chuckled and nodded.

“My sister and I are studying in this university. But I’m a Year Two student now. If you need any help in Rivertown, you can look for me.” Wang Xian smiled.

“Young lad, you’re also from the same school? You must be incredible since both of you made it to the University of Rivertown together!” Su Qian’s father exclaimed in surprise.

“Yes.” Wang Xian chuckled.

“That’s good then.” The middle-aged uncle agreed with a beaming face.

“We’re local people over here. Fengya knows nothing. I hope the rest of the roommates can help her out,” the mother of the tall and slender girl said smilingly.

“Who said I know nothing?” The girl pouted in dissatisfaction.

“What do you know, kid? Do you know how to do your laundry, wash the toilet?” The lady stared at her.

The girl was slightly displeased as she took out a box of ladies’ cigarettes and lit one.

“Cut the smoking and get along well with your roommates.” The plump middle-aged man looked at his daughter before he turned to look at the rest. “My kid is pampered. I hope the rest of the roommates can help out in things like cleaning. Thank you!”

What he said caused the parents of Su Qian to frown, but they did not make any remarks.

The middle-aged uncle said nothing either.

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and looked at the girl who was smoking. He then turned to her father and asked, “Since you are a local, why doesn’t she just stay at home so that it is convenient to take care of her?”

Wang Xian was hinting.

“Our house is far from the school. It would take about an hour to come here from home,” the middle-aged man smiled and said.

“Oh.” Wang Xian nodded and continued, “I think the four ladies should be responsible for the things in their room. They should do their own cleaning and keep their own things. The room is not big. It won’t be tiresome to do these. And...” Wang Xian looked at the girl who was smoking and said, “It would be best not to smoke in the dormitory for girls. That will affect other people.”

The atmosphere suddenly froze after Wang Xian spoke. The middle-aged lady frowned immediately.

The girl who was smoking was staring unhappily at Wang Xian.

“You’re right. My daughter is too pampered.”

“What has my smoking got to do with you? You’re such a busybody!”

At this time, the girl who was smoking suddenly glared at Wang Xian and rolled her eyes at him.

“Fengya, how can you say such things? I told you to get along with other roommates.” The lady told her daughter off hurriedly.

But when she turned to them, she said, “It’s just a lady cigarette. It won’t stink.”

The middle-aged man darkened his expression. He looked at the time and stood up suddenly, “It’s going to be noon. I’ll treat all of you to lunch. It’s also a kind of destiny for the kids to be sharing a room together. Let’s have lunch together.”

“Yes, let’s have lunch together so that the kids can get to know each other,” the lady by the side agreed.

“Well...” the parents of Su Qian hesitated as they looked at the middle-aged Uncle and Wang Xian.

“Let’s go and have something outside,” the middle-aged man stood up again and said.

“Okay, then let’s have lunch together.” After much consideration, Su Qian’s parents agreed to it.

“Sure.” The middle-aged uncle also agreed.

But apparently, they had a bad impression of that family and that girl.

Wang Xian shrugged his shoulders and stood up with Xiao Yu.

“Hmph!”

The middle-aged man and the lady took the lead and walked out first. Their daughter followed behind. When she walked past Wang Xian, she stared and snorted at him. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Wang Xian looked at her as he raised his eyebrow.

“Brother, this girl is not easy to get along with.” Xiao Yu stuck her tongue out to Wang Xian as she whispered.

“Let’s go. We can talk over lunch. I also want to see what they want by treating us to lunch.”

Wang Xian sneered.
