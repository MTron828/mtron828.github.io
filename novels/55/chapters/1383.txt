Chapter 1384: 1384

“Spirit Pearls! I didn’t expect there to be so many spirit pearls! There are hundreds of these rare spirit pearls in our dynasty!”

“Wow, as expected of Xiaoyao City. I came to the right place this time. These spirit pearls are so beautiful!”

“Spirit pearls are very beneficial to cultivation. If cultivated with energy, they can also increase the level of the Spirit Pearls!”

In the Spirit Pearl Shop, the young men and women looked at the spirit pearls in the shop with pleasant surprise, their eyes shining.

Spirit pearls were condensed from elemental energy. They could be made into staffs or pendants.

With such a high-level spirit pearl, it could also increase one’s cultivation speed.

Such an item was rare in any place.

Even though these young men and women had extraordinary statuses and came from powerful dynasties and sects, they were still extremely surprised when they saw so many spirit pearls.

“This is the most special shop in our Xiaoyao City. The owner is a third level void interpretation expert, and he specially bought it from the five elements sea in the boundless sea region!”

“It takes a year for the owner to come and go, and there are many dangers along the way. However, everyone knows how precious spirit pearls are!”

In the middle of the group of young men, a young man wearing dark red clothes and holding a feather fan said with a smile.

“So they are spirit pearls from the Hanhai region. No wonder they are so good!”

The young men and women nodded slightly and looked at the spirit pearls eagerly.

“Ladies and gentlemen, see if there are any spirit pearls that you like. Mark the price clearly!”

When the shopkeeper saw so many young men and women with extraordinary statuses coming over, he immediately asked with a smile.

“Shopkeeper, bring that fire spiritual pearl over for me to have a look!”

“That fire spiritual pearl of the first level of the void interpretation is so expensive. It’s even more expensive than the weapons of the second level of the void interpretation. I don’t have enough spiritual stones!”

The group of young men and women spoke.

“Shopkeeper, how many spiritual pearls do you have here? I want all of them. How many spiritual stones?”

Wang Xian glanced at the young men and women around him. He ignored them and asked the shopkeeper directly.

“HMM?”

Wang Xian’s voice rang out in the hall, causing everyone in the shop to look over.

“Ha, buy all of them. Although the shop of the spirit pearls shop is small, the value of the items in it is more than a hundred billion middle-grade spirit stones. Buy all of them? Ha Ha!”

The young man who was holding the feather fan glanced at Wang Xian with a hint of disdain in his eyes.

“HMPH, you sure are arrogant. I can’t even afford a spirit pearl of the first level of the void interpretation realm. How can you...”

A lady who was dressed like a princess curled her lips and said with a hint of disdain.

Just like how she was dressed, she was a princess of a dynasty. Furthermore, she was the princess that the king of a dynasty doted on the most.

What was the concept of hundreds of billions of middle-grade spirit stones? F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Even if a dynasty’s king had to fork out hundreds of billions of spirit stones, he had to think about it!

A young man casually said that he would fork out hundreds of billions of spirit stones to buy spirit pearls. This was simply arrogant!

“Young master, the spirit pearls here are worth more than 130 billion middle-grade spirit stones. Please take a look at what kind of spirit pearls you need. I will get them for you!”

The shopkeeper looked at Wang Xian and smiled. He didn’t think that he could buy all of them.

“Store them all!”

Wang Xian moved his arm and threw the interspatial rings to the shopkeeper one by one.

“Huh?”

The shopkeeper was slightly stunned. A look of astonishment appeared on his face. Then, when he saw the pile of spirit stones in the interspatial ring, he widened his eyes and was filled with shock.

“This... this... young master, please wait for a moment. I will pack all the spiritual pearls for you!”

The shopkeeper’s arm trembled as he said hurriedly.

“Yes, just put them in your interspatial ring. There’s no need to go through so much trouble!”

Wang Xian said directly.

He had seven to eight trillion middle-grade spiritual stones in his hands. A large portion of them came from the Sky Island Empire and the one-leaf mainland empire.

After all, Wang Xian had completely robbed all the families and forces of the two empires.

The other portion came from the spirit stones dug out from the deep sea spiritual spring.

The deep sea spiritual spring had yet to be dug out. There were at least a few trillion middle-grade spirit stones in it.

More than a hundred billion spirit stones was nothing in Wang Xian’s eyes.

“What?”

Wang Xian acted like a tycoon, causing all the young men and women around him to be slightly stunned!

He really had so many spirit stones?

And he even bought all the spirit pearls here?

“I’m sorry, Young Masters and Young Ladies. All the spirit pearls in our shop have been bought by this young master!”

The shopkeeper looked at the crowd around him and said with a smile.

The shopkeeper gestured to the young men who were looking at the spirit pearls.

“Brother, you’ve bought all the Spirit Pearls. What else do we need to buy? I want the Spirit Pearl in my hand. I’ll give you the Spirit Stones!”

A young man frowned slightly and said directly to Wang Xian.

“I’m sorry. I want all the Spirit Pearls!”

Wang Xian took a glance at him and sat down at the side.

“Brother, can you give face to the Northern Spirit Empire and show some love? My sister likes this water spirit pearl very much!”

A young man raised his eyebrows and looked at Wang Xian when he saw that Wang Xian rejected him directly.

“Either you buy it all or don’t say a word!”

Wang Xian glanced at them indifferently and said in a slightly disrespectful manner.

He even revealed his background?

Wang Xian didn’t give any face to this kind of royal family. He even directly ignored them in a provocative manner!

He wanted all the spirit pearls. If anyone was unhappy, he would be unhappy!

If he met one or two people who were blind, Wang Xian wouldn’t mind destroying them.

Destroying an empire was Wang Xian’s favorite thing.

“You...”

The young man’s expression changed slightly. He stared at Wang Xian coldly.

“Brother, May I know where you are from?”

The young man holding the feather fan waved his hand, indicating for the others to stop talking. He looked at Wang Xian and asked with a twinkle in his eyes.

“The Dragon and Phoenix Empire!”

Wang Xian crossed his legs and said plainly.

His appearance was no different from a good-for-nothing.

“The Dragon and Phoenix Empire!”

When the young men and women around heard Wang Xian’s words, their pupils contracted slightly.

“Is it the newly rising dragon and Phoenix Empire?”

“The Dragon and Phoenix Empire? It’s actually the dragon and Phoenix Empire. This empire destroyed four empires in one go. Moreover, there’s the Dongyuan Empire which is very strong. No wonder...”

The expressions of the young men and women changed. The way they looked at Wang Xian also changed a lot.

“Dragon-phoenix Empire. So You’re from the dragon-phoenix Empire. I’m Yao Dingfeng from the Yao clan of Xiaoyao City. Young Master Xiaoyao is holding a banquet for the elites and aristocrats tonight. This brother can come over and make friends!”

The youth with the feather fan looked at Wang Xian in surprise and invited him.

“I’m not interested!”

Wang Xian waved his hand and shook his head in disdain.
