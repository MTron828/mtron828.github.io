“Dragon Gate!”

A faint voice resonated throughout the immortal spiritual pedestal. Wang Xian flew over with Guan Shuqing and Ao Jian.

“Dragon Gate!”

At this moment, all the immortals from the major immortal sects who had arrived at the immortal spiritual pedestal looked over.

Dragon Gate and Dragon King were a very special force to all the immortal sects.

They were not from the eight cauldrons world, nor were they from an immortal sect that had been passed down for a long time. Instead, they were an overlord of the jianghu in the past.

However, this overlord that they had overlooked at the beginning possessed terrifying strength.

There were at least three immortal gods. Two of them might be middle immortals, and there were 50 to 60 infant stage powerhouses.

Just this top-notch combat strength alone was enough to suppress most of the immortal sects. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Dozens of gazes were fixed on him. Wang Xian swept his gaze across everyone on the stage and revealed a faint smile.

“Ling Xiao from the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect. Nice to meet you!”

A middle-aged man swept his gaze across the three of them and finally landed on Wang Xian. He cupped his hands with a smile on his face.

“Nice to meet you, Wang Xian!”

Wang Xian cupped his hands with a smile. Ling Xiao was Feng Lingtian’s father. However, what puzzled him was why Feng Lingtian and Ling Xiao didn’t share the same surname. Naturally, he didn’t ask about it out of curiosity.

“Dragon King!”

Elder Mu and the Queen of flowers from the innate immortal sect walked to Wang Xian’s side with smiles on their faces. They greeted him with a smile.

“Dragon King!”

Three Immortals from the puppet immortal sect and the Mingwang Immortal sect came over to greet him with smiles on their faces.

“Elder Mu, queen of Flowers, everyone!”

Wang Xian nodded his head in a friendly manner. These few immortal sects were on the friendly side.

This was especially so for the natural born immortal sect and the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect.

“It’s better to meet than to be famous. The Dragon King became an immortal god in his twenties. He is as dazzling as the bright sun in the sky!”

An old man from the Xuan Yuan clan, who was dressed in yellow, walked over slowly. His eyes were filled with curiosity as he looked at Wang Xian.

“Haha, Liao Zan. Speaking of which, I would like to thank the Xuan Yuan clan for their invitation to the Dragon sect this time!”

Wang Xian laughed out loud and looked at the old man. His heart skipped a beat.

His strength should be the strength of the supreme elder of the Xuanyuan clan that Xuanyuan Fenghua had mentioned, a superior immortal.

“The Dragon Gate has the strength and the qualifications to do so!”

The old man smiled with a face full of smiles.

“Hehe, Young Hero!”

At this moment, a faint mocking voice came from the side.

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and looked around.

In the arena, all the immortal sects had basically arrived. The Natural Born Immortal Sect, Yellow Heaven Immortal sect, Puppet Immortal Sect, and Ming Wang Immortal sect had basically maintained a friendly relationship.

However, there were also some people whose eyes were slightly cold.

Among the six immortals from the Saint Medicine Immortal sect and the Saint Doctor Immortal sect who came this time, the green-robed elder whom they met last time was also among them.

Apart from that, an elder from the chaos origin immortal sect’s eyes were filled with killing intent.

As for the Ice God clan that was emitting an icy intent, the Thunder clan’s eyes that were filled with terrifying lightning rays were not very friendly.

The Immortal Gods from the Yongchang Immortal sect, the immortal slaying path, and the Great Flood Immortal sect looked at him with a slightly complicated expression.

The other immortal sects were filled with curiosity.

In the arena, there were a few factions that were clearly in a hostile state.

The one who spoke was the green-robed elder from the Holy Medicine Immortal sect. He narrowed his eyes slightly and stared at him.

Wang Xian looked at the green-robed elder with a cold expression on his face. The corner of his mouth curled up slightly. “Naturally, you can’t compare to him!”

“Haha, Good, good. You have guts!”

When the green-robed elder heard Wang Xian’s words, he smiled coldly with an emerald-green glow flickering on his body.

“Of course you have guts!”

Guan Shuqing, who was at the side, smiled as she held onto Wang Xian’s arm. She stared at the green-robed elder with fire in her eyes.

The green-robed elder turned his gaze to Guan Shuqing. The corners of his eyes twitched slightly.

“Dragon King, you blocked the city gate of our Hunyuan Immortal sect and killed the elders and disciples of our Hunyuan Immortal sect. We will remember this!”

At this moment, the supreme elder of the Hunyuan Immortal sect stared at Wang Xian with murderous intent in his eyes.

“So what if I block your immortal sect and kill your elders and disciples? Closing the city gate for four days is just a joke among all the immortal sects!”

Before Wang Xian could speak, Ling Xiao stared at the supreme elder of the Hunyuan Immortal sect and said directly.

“Alright, everyone. Today is the day of the grand competition of the immortal sects. Let’s put aside our grudges for now!”

Seeing the frozen atmosphere around them, the old man from the Xuan Yuan clan chuckled and slowly charged forward with his aura.

Just now, with the aura of the entire immortal stage, even a half-step immortal god expert would feel his breathing freeze when he stood there.

The old man’s strength was incomparably terrifying. With just a single charge, all of his aura vanished into thin air.

“The disciple competition is about to begin. Everyone, hand over the rewards to US first. Grudges, hand them over to me. As immortal gods, we are forbidden to act. Dragon King, you should know about the immortal god agreement, right?”

An elder from the Yuwen clan walked to the side of the elder from the Xuan Yuan clan and echoed his words.

He did not want to say the last sentence. However, seeing that the Dragon King was full of energy and was going against the few great immortal sects, he had no choice but to remind him based on the previous information.

“Of course I know!”

Wang Xian smiled faintly. With a wave of his arm, a grade-13 spirit sword appeared in his hand. “First, place a grade-13 spirit weapon here. Finally, tailor-made!”

“Dragon King, your reward is considered the most precious among the twenty-one immortal sects!”

The elder from the Yuwen clan took the spirit sword and said with a smile.

Wang Xian smiled nonchalantly. He looked at the puppet immortal sect and the Mingwang immortal sect and said, “Brother Fengmo and Fengsha, if you want to forge a grade-13 spirit weapon, you can look for me!”

“Alright, Dragon King. We will relay the message!”

The few immortal gods nodded and looked at Guan Shuqing who was at the side. They were slightly surprised in their hearts.

According to the introduction of the two brothers Fengmo and Fengsha, there were no female immortal gods who had charged into Yu Ding.

Now, there was another female immortal God who was at the middle immortal level beside the Dragon King.

This dragon gate was even stronger than they had imagined. They could not help but feel lucky that it did not turn into a fight back then.

“Since that’s the case, let’s go to the competition grounds!”

The elder of the Xuanyuan clan held all the rewards in his hands. He scanned the surroundings and said faintly.

“Let’s go then!”

The group of immortals nodded. Their bodies moved and carried the might of Immortals. They flew toward the competition grounds like immortals descending from the heavens.

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian said to Guan Shuqing and Ao Jian. The three of them flew through the air.

At this moment, in the Xuan Yuan clan’s arena, the arena was circular. There were a total of 22 platforms.

Apart from one platform that represented the scattered sects, the rest of the platforms were filled with disciples from the immortal sects.

On the 22 platforms, there were already densely packed with disciples from the immortal sects.

Each immortal sect had at least 400 to 500 people, and there were at least thousands of people.

In the middle of the 22 platforms, there were huge arenas. Each of the arenas had a radius of 1,000 meters. They were enveloped by a blue energy.

This arena seemed to only have a radius of one kilometer, but it actually had a radius of four to five kilometers. It was just that the Yuwen clan had used a formation to make it appear to only have a radius of one kilometer.
