“There are twenty Inborn Spiritual Weapons! It’s no surprise that he’s a Fire God known for his blacksmith skills.”

“This box is full of Inborn-level metal! There’s over a hundred catties of metal!”

“These are... Level 11 weapons! A bow isn’t bad either!”

“Eh! This is a bloodline! The bloodline of the Blazing Flame Bird! Some cultivators in Europe can devour bloodline and this would greatly enhance his fire attribute energy.”

“This is... Fire Spiritual Liquid! It’s greatly beneficial for fire attribute cultivators!”

In the side hall, Wang Xian was searching through the treasures enthusiastically.

Inborn Spiritual Weapons were the most common objects here. As for weapons which were a grade higher, unique bloodline or spiritual objects, every single item would be a treasure which many would fight and compete for.

...

“Why aren’t there any sounds now?”

At this very moment, the group of five was looking into the side hall curiously from the outside.

A while ago, those terrifying roars and auras had completely petrified them.

However, those sounds were gone after just a few minutes.

This made them extremely bitter.

“He might be dead...,” the young man commented helplessly.

The girl in the middle also shook her head bitterly and said, “The fire demons in there are too strong. There’s no way an ordinary Dan Realm expert could stand up against them. In fact, the fire demons are so strong that even four or five Dan Realm experts might not be able to do anything about them!”

“However, we weren’t placing all our hopes on him when we first decided to come. Let’s use our plan,” the young man said with a heavy expression.

“Brother, I guess we should... We should...” The girl was hesitant.

“Prince, take a look... Take a look...”

Suddenly, the other young man standing by the side exclaimed loudly as he pointed to the side hall.

Huh?

The others were taken aback and turned over. At this moment, the raging flames that had dyed the atmosphere red were gradually dissipating.

Once again, peace returned to the side hall.

In the peaceful hall, all of them could see a figure. That figure was none other than Wang Xian who was still busy looking through the treasures.

The group of young men and that girl looked at that figure in shock and surprise.

“How can this be possible... Those are fire demons that instantly killed the Dan Realm experts in our clan. He... He...”

When the young man saw the two gigantic corpses, his body was shivering.

“He managed to kill them! This... His strength...”

That girl exchanged glances with the young man and said, “How can he be so powerful when he’s so young?”

The five of them hesitated for a moment before entering the side hall.

At this point, the side hall was in wretched shape. In the center, there was a huge pothole.

Around them, there were countless potholes that had been smashed by the Flaming Sledge Hammer.

Wang Xian lifted his head, took a glance at them and nodded his head with a smile.

“This..”

The group of five stared at Wang Xian blankly. The young man looked around and his attention eventually fell on a location to his left.

At that place, there was an incomparably huge metal door. The door was over a dozen meters tall and seven to eight meters in width.

“That must be the entrance to the main hall!” the young man whispered. He walked to Wang Xian and lowered his head respectfully. “Senior, we were blind to have misjudged your strength!”

Wang Xian chuckled nonchalantly. He looked to them before turning his head to the entrance of the main hall.

“You guy would like to go in there?”

“We have to. Senior, please help us. If we can really get in there successfully, all we want would be the Holy Water and the Holy Water Scripture. As for the rest, those things are all for your keeping!” the young man said in a solemn tone.

“Oh?”

Wang Xian was slightly surprised by his promise. He had not expected the two fire demons to be so strong. If there was a stronger existence in the main hall, he might not be able to deal with it.

“If there are stronger fire demons in there, all we can do is to retreat immediately!” Wang Xian hesitated for a moment before answering.

“If our plans do not work out, we could only retreat,” the young man said with a heavy expression.

“I would like to go take a look at the main hall of the god!”

Wang Xian’s lips curved into a smile as he turned his gaze towards the entrance of the main hall. “It’s better if the four of you just stay behind. You can follow me in!” Wang Xian said to the girl.

“This..”

The young man was stunned and appeared hesitant.

“Alright!” The girl nodded her head and continued, “Brother, it’s alright. I can just go over with this senior.”

Hmm!

The young man nodded his head and gripped the girl’s arm more tightly.

“Let go take a look!”

Wang Xian walked towards the main door leading to the main hall together with the girl.

At the entrance, Wang Xian realized that this was an incomparably huge metal door. He took a deep breath and placed both of his hands on it.

The eyes of the girl were flickering as she stared into it agitatedly. She felt a little relieved.

Ka ka ka!

The large metal door was opened gradually and an incomparably huge hall appeared before them.

At the center of the hall, a ball of flames was still raging.

At the very front, there was a golden throne and a burning branch on it.

“Who’s the one disturbing the slumber of my master?”

A low growl immediately attracted Wang Xian and the girl’s attention.

Wang Xian and the girl immediately looked over and saw a ten-meter-tall figure getting up gradually.

Around him, there was a spiritual cabinet that was approximately three meters long and glowing faintly.

A ten-meter fire demon!

Wang Xian instantly turned solemn. This fire demon was completely different from those he met previously. There weren’t any raging flames on him.

Instead, he wore red fire armor and appeared more like a terrifying giant.

He held a Flaming Sledge Hammer in each hand and had countless fire crystals embedded in his body.

His aura was totally well-kept and one couldn’t sense how terrifying he really was.

The fire demon looked at Wang Xian and the girl and eventually stopped on the girl. His eyes flickered and a tinge of hesitation flashed in his eyes.

“I’m...” the girl mustered all her courage and attempted to say something.

“Annoying water energy. Don’t taint the divine hall of my master!”

Before the girl could complete her words, the fire demon had picked up the water energy in them. A ray of light shot towards them immediately.

Huh?

Wang Xian was shocked. He waved his hand instantly and a thick water shield appeared before him.

Bam! Bam!

“This is bad!”

The ray of light penetrated the water shield instantly. Wang Xian was caught by surprise and could only retreat with the girl in his arms.

However, a ray of light shot into his body directly.

Wang Xian was shocked. He adjusted his constitution and the fire dragon energy in him instantly erased the ray of light.

What the hell is that attack? How did it penetrate the water shield!

The ray of light wasn’t a scorching hot flame and disappeared in the blink of an eye into one’s body with a stream of warmth.

Wang Xian was able to erase it only by changing the attributes of his body.

Argh!

However, the girl in his embrace screamed out in pain at this moment.

Wang Xian could feel the chill and heat swapping rapidly in her body.

“Shit! The fire seed that was being suppressed is triggered! Fire and water can’t coexist!”
