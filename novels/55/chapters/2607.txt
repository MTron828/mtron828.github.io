2608 2608 within a day, the entire southern star system was shocked

“Si... the announcement of the Sky Eagle Cloud Group and the North Gate Undying Dynasty, this... This is simply submission!”

“The Sky Eagle Cloud Group and the North Gate Undying Dynasty must have received some news, otherwise why would they issue such an announcement, such congratulations!”

“Looks like the Dragon Palace really wiped out the 6 powers in just a few hours, Si, I can’t imagine how strong the Dragon Palace is!”

“Even the Sky Eagle Cloud Group and the Beichuan Undying Shrine have submitted, in the entire star South Galaxy, the Dragon Palace will be the true king!”

The Sky Eagle Cloud Group and the North Gate Undying Shrine immediately congratulated the Dragon Palace on the AI, with the Dragon Palace as the king and the Dragon King as the leader!

This news shocked everyone!

What kind of power could cause the 2 powers to submit?

However, one thing was certain, the Dragon Palace had really destroyed the Sky Mountain Sword Sect’s level 9 sky sect and the other six forces!

Just as everyone was discussing in shock, the information on the AI was announced one by one!

All the warriors of the Black Forest Group of the Jian hua group had been killed, and many undying godly monarchs had fallen!

The Sky Mountain Sword Sect’s planet was almost in ruins, and none of the Sky Mountain Sword sect’s warriors had survived!

According to reliable information, all the experts and disciples of the ninth-grade sky sect had been exterminated by the Dragon Palace!

When the news came one by one, the entire southern star system was in an uproar!

Even though they could basically imagine that the dragon palace had exterminated the six major forces, the exact news still shocked everyone! Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Is... is all of this true?”

At the same time, on the nine planets above the dragon star, all the experts and disciples of the chaotic Tiger Demon Nation were looking at the information on the AI in shock!

They opened their mouths slightly!

They didn’t know about the actions of the Dragon Palace, but they couldn’t react in time when they suddenly saw the news!

“Is this true? Has... The Dragon Palace already destroyed the six major forces?”

In a palace on Dragon Star, all the high-level officials of the chaotic tiger demon kingdom gathered together and looked at the information in shock!

“I’ve asked Prime Minister Gui. The experts of the Dragon Palace have already destroyed all the six major forces and are taking over the planets of the six major forces. The Dragon King asked us to pick some planets!”

The king of the chaotic Tiger Demon Kingdom pursed his lips and said!

The surroundings were silent!

They had some opinions about the dragon palace provoking the Sky Mountain Sword sect. However, the Dragon Palace had treated them well, and they were not ungrateful people!

Therefore, they didn’t say anything and were willing to bear the responsibility with the Dragon Palace!

They were even prepared to fight the six forces for a long time in the future!

However, in just one month, the Dragon Palace had suddenly exterminated them, and the other two major forces declared that the Dragon Palace was their king!

This made them feel dazed!

Once the Dragon Palace became the king of the southern star system, the status of the Tiger Riot Demon Kingdom would definitely rise along with it!

After all, they were in danger together with the Dragon Palace. In the future, as long as the Dragon Palace was around, who wouldn’t give the Tiger Riot Demon Kingdom face?

The people from the chaotic tiger demon kingdom were filled with joy!

Outside, the disciples from the chaotic Tiger Demon Kingdom were roaring in excitement!

Very soon, their chaotic tiger demon kingdom would rise up completely!

In the next few days, the experts from the Dragon Palace led their disciples into the planets of the six major forces and occupied all the oceans!

As for the citizens of the previous six major forces on the planets, they were all extremely terrified. Some of them were powerful, and some of them had divine stones. They all went to the Dragon Palace to send gifts and treasures!

After the thousands of planets were settled, Wang Xian entered one planet after another to establish the Dragon Palace!

Meanwhile, the chaotic Tiger Demon Nation chose a hundred planets from the thousands of planets as their living place and territory!

This made all the heaven demons in the entire chaotic tiger demon nation extremely excited!

“Let’s reopen the Dragon Star!”

On the fourth day, Wang Xian spoke to Prime Minister Gui and the rest!

The Dragon Palace was opened once again. This time, the Dragon Star was connected to all the major planets in the southern star system!

Even the Heavenly Eagle Cloud commercial planet and the northern gate commercial planet had teleportation arrays!

This could be said to be the only planet with the most teleportation arrays in the southern star system!

Naturally, no one doubted the defense and safety of the Dragon Star!

“Dragon King, the Heavenly Eagle Cloud Group, the northern gate immortal dynasty and some other factions want to pay a visit to you, Dragon King!”

Prime Minister Gui said to Wang Xian with a smile on his face!

“Oh, is that so? Then let’s meet the major factions when the Dragon Star Opens!”

Wang Xian smiled and said indifferently!

With the current strength of the Dragon Palace, there was no need for them to put the other factions in the star South Galaxy in their eyes!

There were 31 level 7 immortal king powerhouses in the Dragon Palace, including him, a total of 32!

With such strength, not to mention that the six major factions had already been destroyed, even if they were not destroyed, the entire star South Galaxy would not be a match for them even if they were to join forces!

However, Wang Xian would not reject them even if they came to express their goodwill!

The development principle of the Dragon Palace had always been to not provoke others. If others took the initiative to provoke the Dragon Palace, the Dragon Palace would not be afraid at all!

...

“The Dragon Star will open again tomorrow. At that time, the Heavenly Eagle Cloud Group’s North Gate Immortal Dynasty and a group of factions will pay a visit to the Dragon King!”

“As the safest planet in the southern star system, the Dragon Palace’s commercial planet will open again tomorrow, I must go and take a look!”

“Wu Wu Wu, I once had a house of my own on the Dragon Star, but I returned it, now the price of the house on the dragon star has increased by dozens of times? Or even hundreds of times?”

“Don’t say anymore, I’m about to vomit blood, I bought a shop on the dragon star back then and also returned it, if I knew this would end up like this, I would have gone through life and death with the Dragon Palace!”

The news of the opening of the dragon star caused quite a stir!

After all, the defense of the Dragon Star was too terrifying!

Along with the Warriors from the various powers visiting the dragon palace, it naturally caused quite a stir!

The opening of the Dragon Star attracted the attention of everyone. After all, the defense of the Dragon Star and the power of the Dragon Palace were too strong!

The Dragon Star was the center of the star South Galaxy!

Almost all the powers of the star South Galaxy were coming!

“Sister bei Shuang, you’ve been in your room for more than half a month, Tomorrow Our North Gate Undying Dynasty will head to the Dragon Star, do you want to go?”

...

At the same time, in a palace within the North Gate Undying Dynasty, a girl came to a courtyard and shouted into the room!

“I’m not going!”

A cold voice resounded!

“Sister bei Shuang, let’s go together, our star South Galaxy has a powerful and invincible organization, WE NORTH GATE undying dynasty need to go and pay our respects, I heard the leader is very young and handsome!”

The girl said and walked into the room!

On the bed, a short haired girl sat crossed legged, seeing the girl enter, she opened her eyes!

“Xiao Yun, don’t disturb my cultivation!”

The short-haired woman said!

“Let’s go, sister bei Shuang. You’ll be suffocated if you stay in the room. You’ve been here for more than a month, and you haven’t left the house yet. It’s good to go out for a walk!”

The girl walked over and held her arm as she said!

The short-haired woman hesitated for a moment. She looked at the abyssal seed crystal that was almost completely absorbed in her hand, hesitated for a moment, and nodded!
