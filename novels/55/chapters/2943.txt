Chapter 2944: easily swept through the glazed domain’s tremor 2

“The domain Lord and the Grand Supreme Elder have sent news. Once the Devil Den comes to us, report immediately!”

At a place in the starry sky between the glazed domain and the Holy Domain, a planet with buildings on it suddenly floated in the starry sky.

At this moment, the four people who had just teleported over from the planet at the border met up with the four godly monarch powerhouses on this planet.

The eight people’s expressions were very grave when they saw the message sent by the domain Lord, Grand Supreme Elder, and the others.

!!

Once the demon nest reached their side, it meant that the demonic beasts had attacked. At that time, they had to prepare for the worst.

“I hope we don’t come over. I hope we don’t come over.”

“There are still a large number of people in our glazed domain who haven’t reached the saint realm. There are too many people. If the demon nest comes after us, we will definitely be caught up by them.”

The eight people gathered together, mumbling and praying non-stop.

They focused on the void in front of them, their faces filled with nervousness. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Time passed day by day. In front of the battle line of the Saint Realm, everyone in the glazed domain was also nervously looking at the deep void from time to time in the direction of their glazed domain.

The people of the glazed domain were sent here bit by bit.

However, the number of people was too large. It would take half a year for all of them to arrive here.

In the center of the battle line, the governor, the Grand Supreme Elder, the Holy Region’s Saint Lord, and the others who had rushed over were sitting in the center, staring at the void in front of them.

They had been like this for a few days.

“Things are a little big now.”

As the days passed, invincible in battle also began to panic.

The glazed domain was no match for Yaoxie, and they could not contact boss Wang. It was torture!

The surrounding citizens of the glazed domain were also slightly silent. At this moment, they could only wait for news.

“Disaster is coming, disaster is coming!”

Half a month later, in the void between the glazed domain and the saint domain, on the planet that had been transported to be guarded, eight godly monarch experts stood in the sky above a building in a daze.

At this moment, their gazes were fixed on the void in front of them, and their bodies were trembling slightly.

Half a month had passed. They had been on guard here for half a month, and the last thing they wanted to encounter had happened.

Two incomparably huge demon caves were flying over at a terrifying speed.

That Deep Demon Cave was like hell, enveloping them.

“The worst has happened. Let’s inform the god Emperor and get the Lords to prepare!”

The eight of them looked at each other bitterly. They did not dare to stay here for long.

They immediately entered the teleportation array and left for the next alert planet.

The news was transmitted to all the celestial thearchs as quickly as possible.

At this moment, not only was the celestial thearch who was moving the planet and bringing the people to the sacred region, but the celestial thearch who had already reached the sacred region and was standing on the battle platform trembled when he received the news.

“Get all the soldiers to prepare for battle!”

At the center of the battle line, the domain Lord said in a low voice with an extremely gloomy expression.

“It’s the domain Lord!”

A few divine emperors by the side clenched their fists and nodded heavily.

“Domain Lord, I don’t know if you have calculated how fast the disciples who rushed over are and how fast the Devil Den is!”

At this moment, the sacred Lord suddenly raised his head and asked the domain Lord.

The domain Lord’s eyebrows jumped, and he immediately looked at the first Supreme Elder and the others.

“The first warning planet we set up was set up in the starry sky one month after we traveled through the glazed domain. From the moment we learned that the Devil Den had entered the Void to the first warning planet, it took half a month. In other words, the speed of the devil den is twice as fast as ours.”

The Grand Supreme First Elder immediately calculated. As he spoke, his expression became more and more awkward.

“That means that it won’t be long before the Devil Den catches up to the rest of our glazed domain. At that time, our glazed domain’s people will be finished?”

A god Emperor said with his eyes wide open.

At the side, the governor suddenly stood up. His expression was abnormally awkward.

“Immediately send all the god Emperors to use the divine kingdom to receive the citizens of the glazed domain. If you can get some more, that’s fine. Sacred Master, I’ll have to trouble you to help!”

The governor’s expression was grave as he spoke to the god Emperors. He then asked the sacred master and the others for help.

“Alright, we’ll send the strongest battleship and send a group of powerful god Emperors to bring the divine kingdom over.”

The sacred master nodded and frowned as he continued, “However, domain Lord, you also know how many people there are in the glazed domain. It is impossible to save all of them.”

“Furthermore, we do not only have to consider saving those people. If we do not have a way to deal with them, we will only delay the time of Death!”

As the sacred master spoke, he sighed slightly.

“Two devil dens. If we go all out, there might be Hope!”

The domain Lord’s body trembled slightly as he said.

“Let’s Go and save them first!”

The Sacred Master was silent for a moment before saying.

The God emperors nodded slightly.

In the next few days, the glazed domain sent out all the god emperors and started to quickly move the people from the planets over.

However, as the days passed, all the citizens of the glazed domain received the news that the two great demon dens had attacked.

When everyone received this news, their faces turned pale.

“The two great demon dens have actually attacked. They have actually attacked. It’s over, it’s over!”

“The demon dens are flying much faster than our glazed domain. We still have more than half of the citizens who haven’t flown over. If they catch up…”

“Heavens, what should we do next? What can we do?”

The entire veluriyam domain’s citizens began to panic, especially the citizens of the veluriyam domain who were still rushing towards the holy region in the void. Their faces were extremely pale.

They looked at the void behind them in fear, afraid that the terrifying demon lair would chase after them.

Once they caught up, they would be unable to resist. They could only become the food of the demonic beasts.

They were competing with death.

Time passed day by day. On the tenth day, the god Emperors of the glazed domain received another piece of bad news.

The Devil Den had arrived at the second warning planet.

A large number of citizens of the glazed domain had just left the second warning planet for ten days.

According to the speed of the devil den, they would only need five days to catch up with the large number of citizens of the glazed domain.

When they received this news, the domain Lord and the other god Emperors instantly turned pale.

They clenched their fists and stood quietly on the battle line, waiting helplessly.

They were at the end of their path!

“Roar!”

Just as the experts of the glazed domain were pale and in despair, an extremely excited roar came from a spatial crack in the Machine Emperor Domain.

A powerful pressure spread out in all directions.
