Chapter 1366: 1366 killed until blood flowed like a river

“Brothers, leave the Howling Wind dynasty to us. Kill!”

A cold voice resounded in the sky above the east gate of the dragon-phoenix Dynasty!

At the back of the 400,000 strong army, 400 heaven’s eye demonic beasts, led by Mou Zesen, flew over with cold faces.

Around them were dolphins of various colors and colorful vipers.

On the left and right sides of the 400,000 strong army, nine flood dragons that were 30 meters long swayed their huge bodies as they stared coldly at everyone from the three dynasties.

Behind the flood dragons, there were demon monkeys that were five to six meters in size and lightning prawns that were three to four meters in size!

Their bodies emitted a violent aura as they charged over.

Along with the creatures at the back, there were only about 3,000 people.

However, these 3,000 people caused the 400,000 strong army to stop!

This was especially so for everyone from the Howling Wind dynasty. They were completely stunned by Mou Zesen’s Attack!

He, who was comparable to a rank 4 void interpretation expert, landed in the middle of the 400,000 strong army with his full strength.

That terrifying attack instantly killed 30,000 to 40,000 people. Even a half-step void interpretation general was instantly killed!

“Alright, leave the Star Moon dynasty army to the Demon Combat Division!”

“Leave the Southern Cloud Dynasty army to the Thunder Division!”

Ao qitian held the ocean-pacifying needle in his hand, Ao Qi held the Lightning Spear in one hand, and the Lightning Hammer in the other. The two of them led their subordinates and responded to Mou Zesen.

“Kill!”

“Kill!”

“Kill!”

Immediately after, they did not stop. Mou Zesen roared and glared at everyone from the Howling Wind dynasty with hatred. Then, he pulled the bowstring again!

“Today, we, the Wind Eye Demon Beasts, will take revenge for what we did to you. We will exterminate you and Your Wind Howl dynasty. From now on, there will be no wind eye demon beasts, only the Heavenly Eye Arrow Division of the Dragon Palace!”

His cold gaze locked onto the Duke of the Phoenix Eye Dynasty. His cold aura caused everyone’s expression to change slightly.

“What?”

“The leader of the Wind Eye Demon Beasts is a rank four void interpretation expert!”

“Other than the leader of the wind-eyed Demon Beast, the nine huge demon beasts and the other two demon beast leaders are all third-level void interpretation experts!”

When the three dynasties saw the powerful creatures that suddenly appeared behind them and on both sides, their expressions changed drastically.

Especially the Duke of the Wind Howl dynasty, when he saw the 30,000 to 40,000 warriors that were killed in an instant, his heart bled.

He stared at the leader of the Wind Eye clan with Bloodshot Eyes and clenched his fists tightly.

“How is this possible? Mou Zesen, Your Wind Eye clan clearly only has a level 2 profound void bloodline. Your current strength...”

He stared fixedly at Mou Zesen!

“WHOOSH WHOOSH WHOOSH!”

However, what greeted him was the densely packed arrows of the Wind Eye clan.

“Roar!”

On both sides, the demon monkeys and thunder shrimps roared. Monstrous demonic qi and violent lightning were only five or six hundred meters away from the 400,000-strong army.

More than three thousand people against 400,000 people, a difference of more than a hundred times.

However, no one from the Dragon Palace was afraid at all.

“Buzz!”

“Heavenly Wind Shield!”

Seeing the arrows from the wind-eyed demon beast clan flying toward the Army of the Wind Howl dynasty again, the Lord of the Wind Howl dynasty waved his arm. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

A staff appeared in his hand, and in an instant, it was as if a curtain of Sky had appeared.

The green curtain of sky blocked all the arrows.

“Wind-eyed Demon Beast Traitors, you are courting death. Today, I will definitely exterminate you!”

As he spoke, his body moved and directly attacked Mou Zesen who was behind him.

“Kill them. There is only a fourth-level profound void martial artist and over 3,000 beasts. You are courting death. You think you can help the dragon-phoenix dynasty? Kill them all!”

The star-moon King’s expression changed drastically when he saw this scene. Flames surged from his body as he stared at the nine flood dragons!

“No one can save you today!”

The Southern Cloud King’s expression changed slightly, but soon, a three-meter-long greatsword appeared in his hand.

The greatsword emitted a dazzling golden light.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

The nine flood dragons hovered in the sky, staring at all the profound void martial artists from the three empires from afar.

“Is... is this Lord Wang’s power? It seems like he killed 30,000 to 40,000 enemies in one move!”

“Those nine 30-plus long creatures are so huge and terrifying. Oh My God, are We Saved?”

“Haha, I believe that Lord Wang can protect us. I have always believed it!”

In the dragon-phoenix royal city, the people floating in the sky looked excited and excited when they saw the powerful members of the Dragon Palace descending like divine might.

Their bodies trembled as they clenched their fists tightly.

“So strong, so strong. Even though there are only three thousand creatures, the aura they released is not weaker than the four hundred thousand strong army!”

The dragon-phoenix Empire’s insightful Void Realm Expert’s eyes shot out an excited light as he muttered.

“All the soldiers of the dragon-phoenix Empire listen up. We can not let our comrades fight outside. We, the dragon-phoenix sons, must show our strength and kill!”

Feng Luan moved her arm, and a blazing Phoenix staff appeared. A clear and cold voice rang out, pointing directly at the battlefield!

“Kill! Follow me and kill!”

Mang Hong was the first to rush out, and he roared loudly.

Following closely behind, the dragon-phoenix Empire’s more than ten void interpretation experts immediately followed closely behind!

“Die for me!”

The star-moon king saw the dragon-phoenix Empire’s experts and soldiers rush out, and his expression changed slightly. He waved the staff in his hand, and meteors appeared out of thin air.

Each meteor was about ten meters in size, and they attacked the dragon-phoenix Empire’s insightful emptiness realm experts.

“Fire Elves!”

When Feng Luan saw the star-moon king attack, she waved the phoenix scepter in her hand, and one after another, fairy-like flames attacked the meteors.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

The meteors exploded, and instantly dissipated.

Feng Luan’s body slowly floated up, and her gaze locked onto the star-moon king.

“If you dare to invade our dragon-phoenix Empire, I will kill you today!”

A fire phoenix dot slowly appeared between her brows as a one meter long fire phoenix slowly rotated around her body.

At this moment, the dragon-phoenix Queen seemed to have a phoenix goddess descending!

The Star Moon King’s aura was locked onto by Feng Luan as his expression changed slightly.

“I said I will destroy your dragon-phoenix Empire. Today, you will definitely be destroyed!”

He growled in a low voice and a sun-like ball appeared above his head!

They were facing each other from afar!

“TSK tsk, if that’s the case, let me warm up too!”

Wang Xian saw that two fourth-level insightful void martial artists were locked onto, as well as the king of Southern Cloud.

He floated in the air indifferently and looked at the king of southern cloud with an indifferent gaze.

This time, he was not prepared to let the strange demon clan make a move. He had to hide the fact that the strange demon was the dragon Spike for a while!

Moreover, he only used a little bit of his strength when he was in his human form.

However, that was enough!

“Boom!”
