Chapter 586: Famous Throughout Yong Chang (3)

On fire. On fire.

A small shop in Yong Chang City was the focus of all attention.

There was an alchemist master and a blacksmith master in the smallest shop within the city center.

The master only required two sets of materials for refining spiritual equipment. For refining elixir pills, he would give you four pills for three sets of materials. Moreover, he wouldn’t charge any spiritual stones. News of his exceptionally low pricing for refining had spread throughout Yong Chang City within three days.

All the forces and customers were in a frenzy.

During this period, when various forces were converting their resources into strength, they swarmed the shop.

“Master, these are our materials. We would like to ask the master to refine them as soon as possible. We would be truly grateful!”

At this moment, forces after forces carried boxes of materials into the shop. They were making requests to Wang Xian while still being a little bewildered by the pricing.

“Just leave it there. Come back in half a month to collect!” Wang Xian said plainly to them.

After which, he went to the second floor to continue his refining of elixir pills.

Although the master was acting a little nonchalantly, they didn’t say another word. Instead, they were respectful and headed for the exit.

“This master is truly terrifyingly young!” an old man exclaimed in shock.

“Yeah! Rumor has it that this master is only twenty-something years old. Moreover, there isn’t a second person in the small shop. Some bold guesses are saying that this master is unparalleled in refining elixir pills and equipment!”

“Unparalleled in refining elixir pills and equipment? Would there really be such an incredibly talented person in this world?” Several people sighed emotionally as they returned to their families.

It wasn’t just this small shop that became the craze. At the same time, the news of a young alchemist master and blacksmith master that was unparalleled in refining elixir pills and equipment had attracted equal attention.

Although many people weren’t certain, the news had started circulating within Yong Chang City. A twenty-plus-year-old young man was both an alchemist master and a blacksmith master.

This inevitably made many feel that the world was a little crazy.

“Together with this batch of materials, I will be able to increase my dragon energy by sixty million points. I’m lacking approximately ten million more before my level will increase to Level 9!”

Wang Xian’s eyes beamed as he looked at the boxes of materials. He smiled faintly and started refining rapidly.

While increasing a terrifying amount of dragon energy, he was also forging various kinds of spiritual equipment.

Based on his rough estimate, the materials in the shop would allow him to forge more than one thousand four hundred pieces of spiritual equipment.

Among which, there would be a hundred and fifty pieces of Level 11 spiritual equipment.

This was an insane number.

At this very moment, within Saint Forge Workshop a short distance away, Master Xuanhuo, Master Qingming and a group of alchemists and blacksmiths were gathered in a resting room.

The atmosphere of the room was extremely heavy. Two masters sat there solemnly without moving an inch.

“Master!”

At this moment, the door to the room was pushed open. An employee wiped away the perspiration on his forehead anxiously.

“Master, the people from the Zhou Family have just brought their materials to that small shop!” the employee said with great care.

Puff puff!

Master Xuanhuo breathed deeply and his face was incomparably gloomy.

Master Qingming, who was beside him, was equally bitter. He looked at Master Xuanhuo and asked, “Our Saint Forge Workshop has zero business left. Could it be... Could it be we are just going to sit here?”

Not a single business partner was left! Not a single one!

For the Saint Forge Workshop, this felt a little unbelievable.

As the largest equipment refining workshop and elixir refining shop in Yong Chang City, they had never expected this to happen.

Yet, they truly had no business left.

it was all because of that small shop and it had started three days ago.

Since three days ago, their business had experienced a meteoric dive.

And now, the Saint Forge Workshop had zero business left.

“Who’s the one behind that small shop? How could he possibly set such a low price for refining elixir pills and spiritual equipment? Who the hell is he?”

Xuanhuo growled and his voice reverberated across the room.

“We have not seen him previously either. All we know is that he’s an extremely young master. Some say that he is only in his twenties and is unparalleled in refining elixir pills and equipment!” that employee stammered while answering.

“We can’t let this continue. Let’s go! Let’s go take a look at what this shop is trying to do!”

Master Qingming stood up and spoke with a gloomy expression.

During the period where various large forces wanted to refine elixir pills and spiritual equipment, a shop popped up from nowhere. Not only did it now maintain the market price, but it also charged extremely low prices for refining elixir pills and spiritual equipment.

This was a huge blow to the entire market and the Saint Forge Workshop!

Initially, the Saint Forge Workshop was still considering whether they should increase their pricing.

Now, it would be great if they even had business.

“No, we shouldn’t go there on our own temporarily!”

“Now isn’t the right time!”

A ruthless look flashed in the eyes of Master Xuanhuo. He said, “That small shop is going against all the forge workshop in Yong Chang world. Let’s contact all the other shops and the forces behind them. I don’t believe that the small shop would dare to go against the entire Yong Chang. At that time, with our strength...”

“We will slaughter that brat!”

Master Qingming squinted his eyes upon hearing Master Xuanhuo. He replied, “Alright. We will spare his life for a few more days. He has now encroached upon the interests of all the elixir pill shops and weapon shops in Yong Chang City. Unless he is an Immortal. Otherwise, he will definitely be dead!”

The words of the two masters sent a chill down the spines of all alchemists and blacksmiths in the room. Yong Chang City strongly restricted killing. However, the restriction was on the open front.

If you could assassinate someone in the dark without alarming the Enforcers, it wouldn’t be a problem!

However, their faces turned hideous soon after.

The appearance of that small shop had broken their rice bowls! As the saying goes, to cut off one’s wealth is to kill one’s father. He had to die!

At this very moment, it wasn’t just the Saint Forge Workshop. Other elixir pill shops and equipment forge workshops were also thinking hard about a countermeasure.

In the end, they came up with a uniform solution. To erase that small shop’s existence!

Wang Xian wasn’t aware that his low pricing for refining elixir pills and spiritual equipment had completely encroached upon the interests of some people in the entire Yong Chang City.

Even if he knew, he would be fearless.

Soon, he was going to level up.

Puff!

Another day had passed. Wang Xian took a deep breath and rubbed his eyes softly.

He had been refining elixir pills for four days and nights straight and had converted all the spiritual medicine brought by various forces into elixir pills.

“Just ten-plus million more. Just ten-plus million more!”

After consuming all the elixir pills, Wang Xian took a glance at his attributes and was clearly excited.

“Oh right! Mentor Yu asked me to return once a week. I should be heading back today to take a look!”
