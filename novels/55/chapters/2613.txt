Wang Xian watched bei Shuang leave and didn’t give any further instructions!

He had to choose his own path!

“It’s really troublesome to be a Master!”

Wang Xian shook his head!

“Dragon King!”

At this moment, Prime Minister Gui flew over!

“Dragon King, something big has happened on the Demon Island!”

Prime Minister Gui came over and said directly!

“Let me see!”

Wang Xian said to him!

The content of the AI was divided according to the region!

In other words, as long as you didn’t set it up yourself, the information that you could see was only the situation in the southern star system. You wouldn’t be able to see what happened at the Demon Island!

“According to some reports from the Demon Island, the Abyss has expanded and countless planets have been devoured. A large number of abyss species have invaded. There are even groups of abyss species that have come to the outside of the Abyss and are wantonly hunting humans in the starry sky

“In a short period of time, the Abyss has devoured one-fifth of the Demon Island. The entire Demon Island has fallen into war!”

“According to the news from the other side, an immortal king level 9 powerhouse from a large sect has fallen!”

Prime Minister GUI said with a slightly solemn tone!

Wang Xian’s eyes revealed a look of surprise as he looked at the information on the information!

“A small island in the universe has actually encountered such a disaster!”

Wang Xian’s eyes revealed a hint of shock as he looked at the information on it!

On the Demon Island, all the forces had gone all out to resist and kill the abyssal seed. Countless experts had fallen!

Even a top-notch expert from a large sect had fallen. One could imagine how tragic it was!

According to the information on the artificial intelligence, the forces were ready to build a large-scale defensive formation to prevent the invasion of the abyssal seed!

“Prime Minister Gui, send someone to check it out!”

Wang Xian hesitated for a moment before instructing Prime Minister Gui!

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Prime Minister Gui nodded his head!

The expansion and invasion of the Abyss did not affect the star south star system. However, the abyssal seeds were a rare resource for the Dragon Palace!

If the Dragon Palace could hunt enough abyssal seeds, the Dragon Palace’s strength would be greatly enhanced!

Of course, Wang Xian would not take the risk to lead the experts of the Dragon Palace to hunt down the abyssal seeds. After all, even an immortal king level 9 powerhouse from a large sect could die. If things went wrong, they would suffer heavy losses!

Prime Minister Gui immediately sent strange demon and the rest to investigate the situation while Wang Xian took a look inside the huge mountain!

“Dragon King, the war equipment is completed!”

Four days later, a piece of good news came!

“Is it done?”

His body moved and immediately flew towards the huge mountain!

In the distant void, an incomparably huge mountain stood in the universe. At the top of the huge mountain, there was a divine dragon that was tens of thousands of meters in size. The Divine Dragon was a noble golden color, lifelike and full of majesty!

The Divine Dragon opened its head and made a dragon’s roar. It had an imposing manner that seemed to be able to rule the world!

“Dragon King, the dragon head is where the commander is. From there, you can see everything around you!”

Duan Jinming introduced from the side!

Wang Xian nodded his head and flew to the position of the dragon head. Then, he entered from the mouth of the Dragon!

It was located in the interior of the huge mountain. It contained the terrifying power of formations. All kinds of formations intersected and were extremely powerful!

There were powerful war god weapons placed at the entrance of the caves. The weakest of these weapons could even kill a Level 1 immortal King!

There were over a thousand of these weapons. However, the consumption of the god stones was extremely terrifying when these weapons attacked at the same time!

Apart from that, there were another 5,000 arrow platforms. Each arrow platform could support a member of the Heavenly Eye Arrow Division!

“This war machine is much more powerful than the battleships of the ninth-grade sky sect of the Sky Mountain Sword sect. They are on a completely different level!”

Wang Xian smiled!

“Dragon King, this war machine doesn’t have a name yet. Please give it a name, Dragon King!”

Tian Chen said with a smile from the side!

“Let’s call it Dragon Peak. It roams the starry sky and stands on the Nine Peaks!”

Wang Xian said directly!

“Alright, let’s call it Dragon Peak then!”

Tian Chen nodded his head. With a wave of his arm, a huge finger appeared outside of Dragon Peak and wrote down the words ‘Dragon Peak’!

Every word was glowing and could be seen from afar!

“Let the members of the Heaven’s Eye Arrow Division and the Dragon Palace familiarize themselves with this dragon peak. It might be used soon!”

...

Wang Xian said to them!

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Tian Cheng and the rest nodded!

“Dragon King, Ao Yao has sent us a message!”

Prime Minister Gui came over and reported to Wang Xian!

“The Demon Island is extremely tragic. The Abyss continent that Ao Yao and Dragon King went to last time has already been devoured by the Abyss. All the forces on the Demon Island are fighting against the abyss species. Ao Yao and the rest even heard that there are more than a dozen abyss species that want to invade the demon island and devour humans!”

“These powerful abyss species possess the Abyss species that is at the peak of the Immortal King Realm. If they were not in the outside world and the human powerhouses could return to their divine kingdoms in an instant, I’m afraid the Demon Island would not be able to hold on much longer!”

Prime Minister Gui said to Wang Xian!

“Is it that serious?”

Wang Xian revealed a surprised expression!

“Yes, this is the most serious abyss invasion of the Demon Island in the past tens of millions of years. However, Dragon King, Ao Yao suggested that we head to the Demon Island. Many factions have their own people and their own planets need to be defended. We don’t need them!”

...

“When the time comes, we can focus on hunting the abyss seeds. If we can’t beat them, we can leave immediately. This is a chance for the Dragon Palace!”

Prime Minister Gui continued!

“That’s true!”

Wang Xian nodded his head slightly! Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Let me go over there and check out the situation first!”

He hesitated for a moment before continuing!

Even the great sects had to put up a desperate resistance. Even if the Dragon Palace really wanted to go over, they had to be fully prepared and understand the situation!

It was still a little dangerous to go recklessly!

“Then be careful, Dragon King!”

Prime Minister Gui said!

Wang Xian nodded and took out his AI to send a message to bei Shuang!

Bei Shuang had left four days ago. Based on her speed, she should have reached the Bei Chuan sect!

“Master’s Message?”

At this moment, in a planet’s hall on the demon island, bei Shuang was delighted when she saw the message on the AI!

Around her, there were over 10,000 people gathered, the weakest was only undying Emperor 1!

The group stood there with heavy faces!

Looking at the contents of the information, she was shocked!

“Master is coming over?”

She muttered, immediately sending a location!

“HM? Bei Shuang, your master is coming over?”

A lady beside her raised her eyebrows and asked in shock!

“HM, master said to come over, I don’t know what exactly happened!”

Bei Shuang shook her head!

Bei Shuang’s return this time, with her undying level 4 strength, shocked the entire bei Chuan sect!

A year ago, she was still a pinnacle god Lord, to reach Undying Level 4 within a year, what did that mean?
