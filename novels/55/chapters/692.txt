Chapter 693: 0694 turn the world upside down 2(fourth watch!)

Translator: 549690339

In a luxurious ancient building, four to five middle-aged elders sat in the center of the hall.

There was wine, meat, and wine on the table.

Around them, there were guards, these guards were not living people, they were puppets.

During the ten years of Yu Ding nurturing gu, brothers had turned against each other, father and son were enemies.

The guards were not the most loyal, only the puppets were the most loyal subordinates.

Thus, the puppets around them listened to their commands.

“Yu Ding will appear in half a month at most, as the leader of Underworld assassination team, we need to make some progress as soon as possible!”

“Haha, with our strength and our ten years of killing experience, when we enter the real world, even the other experts of the nine cauldrons world will not be able to stop us, underworld killer, from showing off our abilities. At that time, we will make the entire jianghu jittery!”

“We can’t look down on the heroes of the world. I heard that Lord Snow Demon and Lord Blood Arrow were seriously injured not long ago!”

“Yes, we don’t know the exact reason for the serious injuries. However, I heard that Lord Snow Demon’s maidservant said that an immortal god in the real world used up his life to launch an attack that heavily injured the two Lords!”

“Our world is too small. After we get out, we will become the kings of the Darkness!”

The five middle-aged elders spoke with confidence.

The appearance of the cauldron of Yu made them excited by the slaughter and bloodshed. They wanted to become the kings of the darkness, making everyone fear them.

“Pu Pu Pu Pu!”

The five of them raised the wine cups in their hands. However, at this moment, sharp claws entered their heads and pierced through them.

“Take away all the treasures!”

A low roar sounded as all the spirit tools were taken away one by one.

In the surroundings, the puppets fell to the ground after their master died.

There was a clap of thunder outside, as if a prelude had been drawn.

“Hu, I will fuse into the darkness and become the King of Darkness!”

In a sturdy basement, an old man slowly walked in.

His figure slowly melted into the darkness.

The entire basement was pitch-black, so dark that one couldn’t even see their fingers.

This darkness wasn’t night, but was covered by demonic qi. Only existences stronger than him could see him.

But only immortals and gods were stronger than him!

There were more than ten beds around him, and he had no idea where the old man was lying.

“You guys are really vigilant!”

At this moment, a sound suddenly came from the basement, making the old man who was lying on the bed feel a chill down his spine.

“Pu!” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

However, just as he was about to stand up, a water sword directly pierced through his body.

“How... how...”

The Old Man’s face was full of disbelief. He was an expert who had fought his way out from the mountain of corpses, yet he was actually assassinated!

“There are more than 60 infant realm experts on this island. In less than an hour, we will be able to finish them all off. The six islands are at the exact moment of daybreak. It will be the moment when the people of this world will feel the world turning upside down!”

Wang Xian mumbled and disappeared into the rainy night. His body moved and he arrived at another place.

At the same time, Ao Jian and Ao Qitian’s bodies were also moving rapidly across the entire island.

Even though AO Qitian’s physique was not good at assassination, it was a piece of cake for an immortal to assassinate an infant realm expert.

They would never have imagined that the enemies that their two immortal masters had provoked in the real world would bring them such a terrifying disaster.

“This is the medicinal garden on the island. There are five infant realm experts guarding it. This group of infant realm experts also has ten infant realm puppets!”

Wang Xian came to the location of the herb garden at the center of the island.

There were six islands, and each island had a herb garden.

A large number of herbs were planted in the herb garden. Among them, the demonic attribute pills and water attribute pills were the main ones.

With a thought, Wang Xian used his water swords to kill the five infant stage powerhouses easily. Then, he kept the spiritual herbs into his interspatial ring.

“There are quite a number of grade 7 spiritual herbs!”

A glint flashed across Wang Xian’s eyes. Although grade seven spiritual herbs were precious, they were not of much use to immortals.

Only grade eight spiritual herbs were useful to immortals.

Wang Xian moved his body and disappeared.

When he arrived at the ocean, Ao Jian and AO qitian had already arrived.

“Dragon King!”

The two of them shouted. At this moment, Wang Xian sensed the energy coming from behind him. The Strange Demon clan had arrived.

“Is there anything wrong?”

Wang Xian asked directly.

“No!”

The strange demon shook his head. “Although the people in this world are very vigilant, they return to their homes every day because of their vigilance. Not a single one of them is left behind!”

“Alright, let’s Go!”

Wang Xian nodded his head. He looked at the other island and moved forward rapidly.

With the three of them at the immortal God level, it was easy for the strange demon clan to deal with the other elixir realm experts.

If the immortal God wasn’t careful, he wouldn’t be able to discover Wang Xian and the rest, let alone the existence of the elixir realm experts.

The slaughter was going on at a terrifying speed.

The core experts of the two immortal sects of the Jade Hand Immortal sect, Corpse Chief Dao, were decreasing at a terrifying speed.

One island after another passed by, and Wang Xian’s five to six interspatial rings were filled up.

There was a large amount of metal materials and spiritual herbs.

This was especially so for metal materials. There were many spiritual artifacts in this world because more than eight million people were killed.

Many of the Dan stage experts even had level-12 spiritual artifacts in their hands.

Moreover, a large portion of the spiritual artifacts were made from level-13 materials.

This made Wang Xian extremely excited. With these materials, he could forge many spirit weapons.

In the future, when he could inscribe formations on the spirit weapons, he could definitely forge immortal-level weapons.

“Pu, Pu, Pu!”

Wang Xian waved his arm, and the last three infant stage powerhouses fell to the ground. The few puppets around them fell at the same time.

After putting away the grade-12 spirit weapons, Wang Xian waved his arm and left a few words on the ground. Then, he moved and flew directly toward the beach.

“Dragon King, Dragon King!”

When he arrived, Ao Jian, Ao Qitian, and the strange demon clan were already waiting for him.

“Let’s Go!”

Excitement flashed across Wang Xian’s eyes. The group entered the water and came to a remote depth of the sea.

“Dragon King, these are the spiritual artifacts and spiritual herbs in the interspatial ring!”

Ao Yao passed more than a hundred interspatial rings to Wang Xian.

Most of these interspatial rings belonged to the people they assassinated. All of them were filled with treasures.

“The sun will be up in two hours. Ao Yao, let me raise your strength to the Immortal Realm First!”

A glint flashed across Wang Xian’s eyes as he took out spiritual herbs from the interspatial ring.

He took out all the spiritual herbs that could not be combined to refine pills and turned them into dragon energy directly.

Following that, Wang Xian poured majestic dragon qi into Ao Yao’s body.

The Immortal God, who was good at assassination, was crucial to their revenge. Whether they could kill the two demonic young men depended entirely on Ao Yao!

The dragon spike was used to assassinate the immortal God!
