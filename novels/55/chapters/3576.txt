3577 3576, an all-out war

“Baili, you have crossed the line!”

A terrifying aura flew towards the Dragon Palace. In the Dragon Palace, more than 50 masters of the universe with level-three combat strength were already prepared!

Wang Xian stared at the Archangel Baili, his eyes flashing with fighting spirit.

However, just when Wang Xian thought that there would be a big battle today, a voice was suddenly heard!

“Eh?”

When he heard this voice, he was slightly stunned and looked up!

In the sky above the Dragon Palace, a figure had appeared out of nowhere!

When Wang Xian saw this voice, he was a little stunned!

The Elf tribe, the Sonic Arrow of life!

This was the second time Wang Xian had met them!

As for the Elf tribe, he was still filled with gratitude!

However, what he didn’t expect was that the Sonic Arrow of life would appear!

She was obviously in the vicinity of the Dragon Palace to prevent the arrival of the experts from the angel race!

This filled Wang Xian with gratitude!

The favor from the elves was getting bigger and bigger!

The arrival of the sonic arrow of life also meant that the Great Angel Baili couldn’t make a move!

“HMM?”

Seeing the sudden appearance of the Sonic Arrow of life, the Great Angel Baili frowned slightly!

“If you dare to violate the rules, you will die!”

The Voice of life arrow stared at the Archangel Baili and continued speaking calmly!

If you violate the rules set by the peak races, no one would pursue it if no one pursued it!

But if the peak races pursued it, then you would have to pay the price!

If the Archangel Baili dared to slaughter the experts of other races for no reason, then he would have to pay the price!

This price was his life!

The angel race could not protect him!

This was because when the peak races set the rules, it was already set!

“Voiceover of life, isn’t your elf race interfering too much?”

Archangel Baili stared at voiceover of life with a slightly ugly expression!

Voiceover of life stared at him with a hint of a cold smile on his face. He just looked at him like that!

“If you break the rules, you will be judged. After all, you are an Archangel. Don’t you feel ashamed to attack the Divine Dragon clan that hasn’t recovered yet? “If this gets out, the other races will think that your Angel clan is trash!”

She said lightly!

Life Voice Arrow’s words made Baili’s archangel look a little embarrassed.

“Haha, I’m just bored. I don’t need to do anything to destroy a high-level race!”

Angel Baili laughed coldly and looked at the Holy Dragon King and the rest behind him!

“Hehe, you can’t destroy our Dragon Palace with just a bunch of dogs behind you!” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Wang Xian heard his words and said coldly, “If you give me another thousand years, I can kill you, Angel Baili!”

“Huh?”

When Angel Baili heard Wang Xian’s provocation, his expression darkened and he looked at him coldly!

“Look at me? Hehe, Angel Baili, do you dare to make a bet? A thousand years later, we will have a one-on-one life-and-death battle. Do You Dare?”

Wang Xian stared at Angel Baili and said with a cold expression!

“Hahaha, arrogant, what an arrogant thing. How dare a small divine dragon be so arrogant in front of me?”

When Baili the Great Angel heard Wang Xian’s words, he couldn’t help but burst into laughter. He stared at Wang Xian with contempt and said, “If it weren’t for the strong warriors of the Elf clan, I could have killed you with one finger!”

“In the next thousand years, if your Angel clan doesn’t interfere in the war between the Dragon Palace and the six races of the Holy Dragon, I can exterminate all of them!”

“If you dare to challenge me in the next thousand years, I will be able to kill you as well. I dare to say this sentence here. You can call me arrogant or arrogant, but I will say it!”

Wang Xian looked at him and said expressionlessly!

The smile on Baili Archangel’s face faded a little. He stared at Wang Xian with a cold gaze and said, “You dare to challenge me in the next thousand years?”

“If you have the guts, we can have a one-on-one battle.”

Wang Xian smiled faintly as he stared at him!

“Hahaha, it’s a pity that you won’t live past a thousand years.”

Baili laughed maniacally as he looked at the six great races of the Holy Dragon lineage behind him. His eyes were filled with coldness. “Kill him and bring me his head. If you can’t do it, I’ll Test You Out!”

“Don’t worry, Angel Baili. We will definitely take his head and offer it to you!”

The Holy Dragon King and the rest felt a chill in their hearts as they immediately replied loudly!

“Alright!”

Angel Baili stared at Wang Xian as his gaze swept across the life sound arrow. With a cold snort, his figure slowly disappeared!

“Coward!”

Wang Xian watched Angel Baili leave and spoke directly!

Of course, he also knew that it wasn’t Angel Baili who was being cowardly. It was because she didn’t put him in her eyes.

In her eyes, he would definitely be killed!

“Hehe, Holy Dragon King, the five great races, should we have a fight now? There are more than 60 masters of the universe with level three combat strength!”

He looked at the Holy Dragon King and the rest and spoke with a face full of mockery!

“Dragon King, no matter which corner of the universe you escape to, we will destroy you and cut off your head!”

The clan leader of the god-herding clan stared at Wang Xian and said coldly!

“Hehe, I will escape? I will attack one by one and destroy all your races!”

Wang Xian sneered and said without a doubt!

“Is that so? Let’s wait and see then!”

The clan leader of the god-herding clan stared at Wang Xian with murderous intent. His figure also slowly disappeared!

They did not choose to attack!

Since the Dragon Palace was able to annihilate the sky-plant demonic beast clan, they must have at least forty to fifty level-three masters who were masters of the universe.

With the strength they had today, the chances of them annihilating them were very small!

Therefore, they would gather all their strength and attack the Dragon Palace!

After the experts from the five major races, the Holy Dragon King and the rest left, Wang Xian’s eyes flickered.

“Thank you for your help, Sir Sound of life arrow from the Elf tribe. I, Wang Xian, am extremely grateful!”

Wang Xian looked at sound of life arrow and thanked him!

“Hehe, you have guts. How dare you challenge Bai Lie!”

The Voice of life looked at Wang Xian with a look of admiration!

“This is also because you are here, master voice of life.”

Wang Xian smiled and said!

“Although the top races can not participate in the war between you, you have to be careful of the Holy Dragon pastors. I can guarantee that the powerhouses of the angel race will not make a move, but I can not guarantee anything else. However, if the Holy Dragon Race wants to regain their glory, it will inevitably cause some waves. Work Hard, Little Fella!”

The Voice of life spoke to Wang Xian with a smile. The next moment, she left as well!

Wang Xian watched her leave with a smile on his face!

As long as the angel race did not participate in their war, Wang Xian was confident that he could wipe out the six major races of the Holy Dragon lineage!

After wiping out the six major races, he wanted to achieve a breakthrough in his strength!

He wanted to achieve a breakthrough in the Five Elements Millstone and the Tai Chi Dragon Plate!

When the time comes, he has the confidence to kill Baili Archangel!
