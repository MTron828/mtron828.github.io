Chapter 1268: Under the opening of the bridge of Heaven’s pride

Translator: 5496903

In the flowing sea region, because of the cemetery of humans and demons, humans and demon beasts were mortal enemies.

There was constant fighting and endless fighting. It had been going on for thousands of years.

In fact, in other areas, there were places where humans and demon beasts were not mortal enemies. In fact, in the vast region, there were demon beast experts who established Demon Beast cities.

Demon beasts interacted with humans, and humans interacted with demon beasts.

The Third Chamber of Commerce in the world had just entered the flowing sea region not long ago. Now, they had opened the door to the Demon Beasts’area and interacted with them.

Transactions were mutually beneficial. In addition to the strength of the Third Chamber of Commerce in the world, it could be said that the third chamber of Commerce in the world was the only human who interacted with the demon beast race in the human-demon graveyard.

As the person-in-charge of the Liuhai region of the Third Chamber of Commerce in the world, manager Qian had entered the interior of the Demon Beast race in the human-demon graveyard and learned some information.

“Manager Qian, are the chosen ones of the Demon Beast race really so powerful?”

Long Xiaotian looked at the slightly plump middle-aged man in surprise and asked.

“The Demon Beast Race has a powerful advantage. As long as they have enough resources, they can raise their strength to the peak!”

Manager Qian smiled. “This time, humans have used a special method to descend to the land of trials. They have already angered the rulers of the various demonic beasts. Naturally, they will seek revenge!” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Wang Xian had killed more than 400 demonic beasts when he entered the land of trials.

The number of 400 was very little to humans. Even if 400 people were placed in the human-demon graveyard, it could only be counted as tens of thousands or one in a hundred thousand.

However, when placed in the Demon Beast clan, it was considered a relatively large number.

The Demon Beasts didn’t have such a strong reproductive ability and their numbers were much smaller than humans. More than 400 demon beasts were killed and in their opinion, they were killed in a despicable manner.

They had thoroughly angered the Demon Beast clan.

Therefore, after the Heaven’s Pride Bridge was opened this time, they wanted to teach humans a harsh lesson.

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and said indifferently, “With the strength of the Human Heaven’s pride, they might not necessarily lose!”

“Haha, you are thinking too well, brother. The Heaven’s pride on the human side can not be compared to the demon beasts. Even that sword demon is much weaker. If he dares to fight for the supremacy of the Heaven’s pride, he might be killed directly!”

Manager Qian said indifferently.

“That might not be the case!”

Wang Xian smiled and poured himself a cup of tea.

That might not be the case. That might not be the case. It was not only his own strength, but also the strength of Ling Jian ‘Er and Ren Xingchen.

Needless to say, Ren Xingchen had both metal and fire attributes. If he could master more combination combat techniques, he could definitely fight against demonic beasts at the first level of the Seethrough realm.

As for Ling Jian ‘er, Wang Xian had sensed her extraordinariness the last time.

The strong killing power of the metal attribute was definitely not simple. This made him think of a type of constitution, the constitution of the origin metal attribute.

Ling Jian ‘ER had obviously obtained an incredible item and changed her own constitution.

Her current attack power could definitely threaten and even kill an existence of the first level of the Seethrough realm.

“Haha, Brother, don’t doubt my words!”

Shopkeeper Qian looked at Wang Xian and smiled at him.

Wang Xian didn’t reply and drank his tea calmly.

Long Xiaotian and shopkeeper Qian started to chat. They talked about many matters regarding the demonic beast clan.

About half an hour later, shopkeeper Qian left with his men.

Only Wang Xian, Long Xiaotian, and the Heaven’s Pride Xiao Shi Kong were left on the table.

“This shopkeeper Qian looks down on the humans in the human-demon graveyard!”

Xiao Shikong saw them leave and said to long Xiaotian with a frown.

“This shopkeeper Qian is arrogant, but most of his words are true!”

Long Xiaotian looked at Xiao Shikong with a slight frown. “Shikong, don’t participate in the Battle of the Bridge of Heaven’s pride this time!”

Xiao Shikong frowned slightly when he heard long Xiaotian’s reminder. He then nodded slowly and said, “Yes, second Prince!”

“Is the third trading company in the world very strong?”

Wang Xian asked Long Xiaotian curiously.

“It’s very, very strong. It’s one of the top trading companies in the supernatural continent. This manager Qian is a disciple of the third trading company in the world. Their business is not limited to humans. They are also cooperating with the Demon Beast Clan. In addition, they are selling some information!”

Long Xiaotian nodded and said solemnly.

He had invited manager Qian over today in an attempt to rope him in. In the end, the other party had no intention of talking to him at all. He merely used some matters regarding the demonic beasts to get rid of him.

“I see!”

Wang Xian nodded and began to chat with him.

After a simple meal, long Xiaotian brought Wang Xian around the surroundings.

They found a place to massage and relax.

Along the way, Wang Xian heard the most about the battle to open the Heaven’s Pride Bridge two days later.

The opening of the Heaven’s pride bridge connected the humans and demonic beasts. The Top Ten Heaven’s pride experts of the two races would fight each other.

The winner would receive a reward. Furthermore, the humans and demonic beasts would choose a Supreme Heaven’s pride expert.

However, the human race no longer had any hope of getting the supreme genius position.

The news of what happened in the trial grounds had already spread throughout the entire human-demon graveyard.

Even the peak-stage insightful void stage powerhouse from the blood flow empire was killed by the Demonic Beast Race’s supreme genius Wang Shou. The second-level insightful void stage array couldn’t do anything to him. How could he still have the strength to obtain the title of Supreme Genius.

When Wang Xian heard the noises around him as he passed by, a faint smile appeared in his eyes.

At night, Wang Xian did not return to his residence. Instead, he flew directly towards the Heaven’s pride stage.

He entered the arena at the top of the Heaven’s pride stage directly. He entered the cultivation room and continued to study the combined attacks of the four attributes.

“The Heaven’s Pride Bridge has been opened. The top ten disciples of the Heaven’s Pride Roll have the qualifications to step into the Heaven’s Pride Bridge!”

“This time, the Heaven’s Pride Bridge will be selected. The Blood Stream sect’s supreme prodigy!”

A mechanical voice suddenly sounded in the room. Wang Xian let out a soft sigh and a faint smile appeared on his face.

He stood up and walked out with a smile on his face.

As soon as he walked out of the arena, he saw a formation rising in the void in front of him.

In the sky five kilometers in front of him, golden rays of light enveloped an area of dozens of kilometers in radius.

Inside, there was a huge arena.

A bridge made of metal extended dozens of kilometers from the heaven’s pride stage.

And that huge arena was in the center of the Golden Bridge.

This golden bridge turned into ten paths, and the path in the center shone even brighter.

The rest of the paths gradually weakened.

At this moment, when the Heaven’s Pride Bridge opened, the hundreds of thousands of people who had been waiting here flew directly towards the arena in the middle of the bridge.

“Heaven’s Pride Supreme Stage!”

Wang Xian looked at the supreme stage in the sky above the arena. A faint smile appeared on his face.
