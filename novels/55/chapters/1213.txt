Chapter 1214: Sword Demon No.

Translator: 5496903

“Haha, Do You Think I, Ren Xingchen, am afraid of You? If you want to kill me, you will have to pay a terrible price!”

Ren Xingchen saw the rest of the Meng clan staring at him, and his face was full of fighting spirit.

Even if there were five or six half-step void interpretation experts among them, he was not afraid at all.

“Kill!”

More than 30 people of the Meng clan emitted a cold aura and directly attacked Ren Xingchen.

The thirty plus people were extremely aggressive.

Even though the Meng clan had lost more than two hundred people, the most elite and most powerful thirty people had survived.

“The Meng clan’s people have attacked again. That mysterious person has been restrained by two void interpretation experts. I reckon that young man is still in danger!”

The surrounding people watched from afar. When they saw the Meng clan’s thirty plus experts charge over once again, they whispered.

“I’ve said it before. I’ll protect his life. Since you all want to die early, I’ll fulfill your wish!”

Just when the Meng clan’s people below had yet to rush over, a cold voice came from above.

The bodies of the Meng clan’s people who were rushing over stiffened slightly. A trace of fear appeared on their faces as they hurriedly looked towards the sky.

“You still want to save that Brat in the battle with us. Let me tell you. With your strength, you can’t protect him. The Meng Clan has declared his death. No one can protect him!”

One of the elders of the Meng clan shouted angrily when he heard Wang Xian’s arrogant words.

“Hehe, with just the two of you!”

Wang Xian held the demon-free sword in his hand and waved it. The Earth Dragon Shield blocked their attacks directly.

“Light and darkness!”

At the instant he blocked the attacks of the two of them, Wang Xian’s body shook.

Darkness suddenly spread out from his body into the surrounding space.

He was like a demon. Even the Sun in the sky could not shine into his darkness.

The Abhijna of Light and darkness.

At this moment, the light and darkness abhijna that he had comprehended through the heart of Light and darkness was also a combined ABHIJNA.

Wang Xian had never used this Abhijna before.

Now that he had the heaven-deceiving pearl, he could use it without restraint.

Buzz

The darkness spread out rapidly and covered an area of two kilometers.

In this space, everyone’s speed, perception, and attacks were reduced except for him.

However, in this space, Wang Xian’s attack and speed could be more than doubled.

Whoosh

The moment the darkness enveloped him, Wang Xian’s eyes were fixed on the ground and his body started to move.

“Be careful!”

Everyone from the Meng clan who was enveloped by the darkness had a drastic change in expression. They hurriedly shouted.

“Die!”

In this space, this group of martial artists who had yet to reach the insightful void tier were nothing but ants in his eyes.

Wang Xian was so fast that even the two old men from the Meng clan could not react in time.

“Pu, Pu, Pu!”

In the light and darkness, Wang Xian seemed to have turned into a phantom demon.

The demon-free sword in his hand was like the scythe of the grim reaper who reaped lives.

In this area, the members of the Meng clan didn’t have the strength to resist at all.

One after another, they were pierced through. They didn’t even have the chance to scream before they died under Wang Xian’s sword.

“Damn it, damn it, you mysterious thing, go to hell!”

In the sky, the two elders of the Meng clan felt the vitality of the people below disappearing rapidly. Their faces were furious as they roared loudly.

Wang Xian raised his head and revealed a cold expression.

The real battle had just begun. Now, he was going to unleash his full strength!

“Kill one of them first!”

Wang Xian’s eyes were extremely cold. With a move of his body, he charged towards the two insightful emptiness realm experts in the sky.

“Aspect: Heavenly Wind Sword!”

One of the insightful emptiness realm experts could no longer hold it in and unleashed his strongest attack.

Dharma Idol, heavenly wind sword.

The strongest attack of the dimension sundering realm was aimed at Wang Xian.

A dark green longsword that was surrounded by a green hurricane was gradually reduced to two meters in size.

However, the hurricane around the longsword engulfed all living beings within a radius of one thousand meters.

Even the dark and light supernatural powers were trembling violently under the dharma idol of an expert of the dimension sundering realm.

The power of a dharma idol was different from that of a dharma idol. After the power of a Dharma Idol was unleashed, it would dissipate rapidly.

On the other hand, the dharma idol could last for dozens of seconds or even a few minutes. During these few minutes, the attacks of the insightful emptiness realm expert would be multiplied by several times.

This was the strongest part of the Dharma Idol.

“Wind shield, trap him. Damn you, go to Hell!”

The eyes of another insightful emptiness realm expert of the Meng clan were extremely red. His entire body trembled and the invisible wind energy in the entire area surged towards Wang Xian.

A huge restriction appeared around Wang Xian.

“If you want to trap me, water will flood the Golden Mountain!” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Wang Xian’s figure moved and a protective shield formed around him.

“Fire Territory!”

A cold expression appeared in his eyes. A huge flaming mountain appeared in front of him and attacked the two elders of the Meng clan head-on.

“Hiss, what a powerful attack. However, heavenly wind sword, Slash!”

The heavenly wind sword that was surrounded by tornadoes slashed directly at the fire territory. The terrifying energy caused the fire territory to explode.

“Die!”

The fire territory was defeated, but the heavenly wind sword was not completely defeated.

The tornadoes around the Dharma Idol heavenly wind sword dissipated under the collision of the fire territory, leaving behind a resplendent green longsword that attacked Wang Xian.

“Haha, Die!”

The Meng Clan’s elder who was controlling the heavenly wind sword revealed a ferocious expression.

The Meng Clan’s elder waved his arm and a wind shield flew towards him rapidly.

“This is the time!”

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes. His speed did not slow down at all. Instead, he increased his speed and met the resplendent green wind sword head-on.

“Die!”

Just as Wang Xian was about to collide with the heavenly wind sword, the two elders of the Meng clan roared loudly.

“Light and dark void!”

Wang Xian’s figure trembled as he displayed the most heaven-defying talent of the strange demon clan, void.

Buzz

The wind shield surrounded him as the resplendent heavenly wind sword pierced into his chest.

Just as the two of them were smiling, Wang Xian’s figure became illusory.

“Star Explosion!”

A cold voice was heard, causing the faces of the two elders of the Meng clan to turn stiff.

The moment they saw this mysterious fellow being killed by him, the other party suddenly unleashed an even more terrifying attack. This caused the smiles of the two elders to stiffen and their pupils to dilate.

Star explosion!

A three-elemental fusion battle skill.

The target of Wang Xian’s attack was not the Voidwalker who had released his Dharma Idol, but the other elder of the Meng clan.

“Explode!”

Under the defense of the two Meng clan elders who were terrified, the starburst erupted.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

A terrifying sound reverberated within a radius of dozens of kilometers.

Even though it was a long distance away, there were still people who were looking in their direction. Their faces were filled with astonishment.

“What a terrifying aftershock of the attack. It must be a battle between at least a level two insightful emptiness realm expert, right?”

Some people stopped and looked towards the direction of the sword mansion, their eyes flashing.
