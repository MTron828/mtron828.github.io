Chapter 1492: Birthday Party 1492

A ferocious beast with a level three Seethrough bloodline.

After being nourished by Wang Xian’s immense dragon energy, the level of the bloodline was raised to level six of Seethrough.

After it hatched and was born, the inside of its egg shell was also completely nourished by the dragon energy. Surprisingly, it also allowed its bloodline to achieve a breakthrough.

A level seven Seethrough ferocious beast with a bloodline made him very surprised.

The value of a young ferocious beast at level seven of the Seethrough realm was extremely terrifying.

Even if he were to exchange it with an ordinary dynasty, he might not be able to get it.

However, Wang Xian did not care too much about this young ferocious beast.

There were more than 16,000 members of the Dragon Palace. All of them were existences with endless potential. Let alone a young beast at level seven of the Seethrough realm, even a young beast above level seven of the Seethrough realm was nothing to him.

Furthermore, the pups needed to be nurtured. To nurture a pup of a level seven of the Seethrough Realm Bloodline Demon Beast to level seven of the Seethrough realm required a terrifying amount of resources.

To nurture a pup to level seven of the Seethrough realm from a third-rate force in the vast region, they would need to spend at least half of their resources.

Therefore, Wang Xian didn’t take it to heart. He didn’t feel any heartache even if he gave it to he yuan directly.

Furthermore, he wouldn’t forcefully upgrade the bloodline of a demonic beast or ferocious beast in the future. It would be too much of a waste of dragon energy.

“Pa pa, Pa Pa, Zhi Zhi, Zhi Zhi!”

The two of them walked towards the place where he yuan was celebrating his birthday.

He Yuan’s birthday and the establishment of He Yuan’s army made this banquet extremely grand.

The venue was located within the He clan, not far from the holy tree.

The closer they were to the holy tree, the more abundant the wood attribute spiritual energy was.

According to Wang Xian’s estimation, the density of the wood attribute was at least ten times that of the outside world when they stood on the holy tree.

This was definitely a terrifying paradise.

It was also because of this holy tree that the He tribe was able to stand in the vast region for tens of thousands of years.

Little Goody was a wood attribute ferocious beast. The holy tree was very attractive to it, so it became even more excited.

Waving its small hands, it had a somewhat green body and green eyes. It looked very cute.

The name Little Goody was naturally given to it by one tree dazhuang!

“TSK TSK, the surroundings are really beautiful!”

Walking straight inside, the surrounding flowers and plants were abnormally beautiful.

In the sky, there were many houses built in the middle of the two trees. The vines were twining, and they were colorful.

“Ah, that demonic beast cub is so cute!”

At this moment, a surprised voice came from the side.

The two girls from the forest fairy race looked at little rascal who was on Wang Xian’s shoulder and exclaimed in surprise.

“Pa pa, Zhi Zhi!” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Little Rascal looked at them. They were both wood-type creatures and were rather close to each other. He called out to them twice.

“Wow, so cute!”

The two forest fairies’eyes lit up as they said this.

Lone Tree Dazhuang looked at the two beautiful forest fairies who were looking in their direction. He slightly puffed out his big belly.

However, when he saw that they weren’t looking at him at all, he was slightly dejected. He rolled his eyes.

“Hehe, two beautiful ladies, it’s called Little Goody!”

Dui Dazhuang went over and said with a smile.

“Is that so? What kind of beast does this fellow belong to? Let’s Go Get One Too!”

The two forest fairy girls glanced at DUI Dazhuang and immediately asked.

“This, this is an ancient brown beast, a wood type beast!”

Dui Dazhuang replied with a smile.

“Ancient Brown Beast? Ancient Brown Beasts don’t look cute at all. How can such a cute little fellow be an ancient Brown Beast?”

The two forest spirits looked at Little Goody in puzzlement.

“Mutated, this one is mutated!”

Dui Dazhuang said with a laugh.

“Demonic flower, hurry up!”

“Oh Oh!”

At this moment, the voices of the other forest spirits came from the front, and the two forest spirits immediately left.

Dui Dazhuang looked at the two leaving figures with some disappointment.

“After entering the inner area, don’t cause any trouble. Otherwise, you will be punished according to the rules of the Clan!”

At this moment, the two of them arrived at an entrance. A middle-aged man’s voice rang out.

“Yes, yes!”

Dui Dazhuang immediately replied.

He sized up the surroundings. There were some young and beautiful women from the forest fairy race. All of them were outstanding young men and women.

Today, everyone was dressed exceptionally beautifully. Dui Dazhuang was extremely moved by them.

“Sigh, brother Wang Xian, speaking of which, I’m almost 40 years old. I haven’t achieved anything. I haven’t even found a wife at 40 years old. Sigh!”

All of a sudden, Dui Dazhuang sighed and said to Wang Xian.

“Speak your mind!”

Wang Xian shot him a glance and said directly.

“Hehe, brother Wang Xian, you know me well. ERM, can you let me play with little rascal later? No, my thick arms let little rascal stand!”

Dui Dazhuang said to Wang Xian.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian saw through his thoughts at a glance and nodded his head.

“Haha, Brother Wang Xian, you’re the best!”

“I know that my chance of joining Young Master He’s army is slim. I’ll depend on it today!”

Dui Zhuang walked to Little Rascal’s side and extended his hand towards it with a wretched expression.

Wang Xian commanded little rascal to follow him.

“Squeak Squeak!”

Little Rascal jumped into DUI Dazhuang’s hand unwillingly.

“Hehe, Hehe!”

Dui Dazhuang smiled in a wretched manner and gently patted little rascal’s head.

Wang Xian followed the crowd and arrived at an empty space.

This place was about five kilometers away from the holy tree. There was a river surrounding it.

“Today is young master he Yuan’s birthday banquet in the sky. Everyone, go to the location above!”

A voice prompted. Wang Xian moved his body and flew directly into the sky.

At the top of the tree, there was a patch of thorns in the sky with a radius of about two kilometers.

The thorns were intertwined together and it was very stable. One could stand on it. It was a very beautiful scene in the sky of seven to eight hundred meters.

There were some tables and chairs as well as some food on it.

There were more than ten thousand people here, so it didn’t seem crowded.

However, what made all the youths excited was that there were a hundred fierce beasts lying around.

There were all kinds of fierce beasts. The lowest was at the first level of the profound void tier, and the highest was at the third level of the profound void tier.

At this moment, there were already several thousand youths who had come here, and they were chatting in groups.

There were also many youths who came to the front of the fierce beasts with burning eyes, and they were sizing them up with burning faces.

Today, as long as they could succeed, these ferocious beasts could become their mounts.

“This place is really luxurious and magnificent. TSK TSK, I’m really envious!”

Dui Dazhuang looked around with a shocked expression.

“Let’s Find a place to sit down first!”

Wang Xian said to him and walked to a seat at the side. He waited there.

He poured a cup of tea on the table and sipped it lightly.

“TSK tsk, brother Wang Xian, how did a young man like you manage to live the life of an old man? I’ll go somewhere else!”

Dumu Dazhuang said as he looked around with a wretched gaze. He swayed his fat body as he walked towards the ferocious beasts.

Wang Xian looked at him and shook his head!
