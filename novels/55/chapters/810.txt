Translator: 549690339

“Roar!”

On the other side, AO qitian, who held the sea-pacifying divine needle in his hand and was seven to eight meters in size, looked like a devil monkey.

It was too violent! VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

There were a total of three middle-level immortals in the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect. However, at this moment, the violent ao Qitian was fighting one of them with his own strength.

The terrifying flames attacked him. The violent demonic qi, together with the fifty-meter-long sea-pacifying divine needle, swept through everything.

Whether it was the Sea of fire, the flaming lava, or the pillar of fire, they were all forcibly blocked by his violent attacks.

The ocean-pacifying divine needle was an existence that far surpassed ordinary immortal God artifacts. It could become fifty meters long, and when it was waved, it could simply destroy the world.

In the area where AO Qitian was fighting with the middle-level immortal of the Holy Doctor and Holy Medicine, no one dared to enter the area.

On the other side, Prime Minister Gui was standing on top of a flood dragon, and a hundred-meter-wide earth wall appeared out of thin air.

Terrifying wind blades, storms, and the flood dragon’s powerful physical body, the immortal gods in front of them were defending passively, their faces filled with fear.

There was no room for resistance at all.

“Move the mountain!”

At this moment, Prime Minister Gui’s body shook, and the turtle shell on his back flew higher into the sky.

“Boom!”

Instantly, a 1,000 meter tall mountain appeared in the sky, and the mountain smashed heavily towards the lower immortal.

“Wind domain, binding of wind!”

Below, the flood dragon’s body flashed with a green light, instantly forming a wind domain of 10 km in radius.

Within this space, all the wind was within their control.

Terrifying green energy shot towards the lower immortal.

“No, save me!”

The lower immortal couldn’t move. He looked up at the terrifying mountain in the sky, his face filled with despair.

“Boom!”

The mountain descended, bringing with it a terrifying power as it smashed towards the ground below.

“Boom!”

Another earth-shattering sound rang out as the ground split open. Terrifying cracks spread out in all directions, all the way to the sacred city.

The terrifying cracks were a meter wide and a hundred meters deep.

At this moment, all the disciples of the two great immortal sects in the Sacred City stood on the streets, their faces filled with shock and fear.

They looked at the terrifying sea of fire, the terrifying mountains, and the cracks not far away, their eyes filled with fear.

It was the third one. Their immortal God had already died, and not a single one of them had died. Not even a single one was injured!

“Ah, I’ll fight it out with you!”

A subordinate immortal collapsed under the combined attacks of the two flood dragons.

Terrifying speed, powerful physical body, and sharp wind blades.

In addition to their incomparably powerful bodies, the two flood dragons were completely toying with the subordinate immortal.

He had no ability to resist at all.

Seeing his companions die one by one, despair appeared on his face. His arms turned into terrifying tree branches that directly twined around the flood dragons.

“Roar!”

With a flood dragon roar, the densely packed wind blades slashed towards the tree branches.

When the wind blades landed on the tree branches, numerous wounds appeared instantly, and fresh blood flowed out from the tree branches.

“Ah, die!”

The middle-aged immortal God’s body began to wither, and his black hair slowly turned white.

The terrifying tree branches that his arms transformed into were even more terrifying.

“Rise of the clouds!”

When the two flood dragons saw that the middle-aged immortal God was actually using up his life force to attack, their expressions did not change, and a gust of wind blew over.

At the same time, a large patch of cloud and fog.

The cloud and fog instantly filled an area of ten kilometers.

The two flood dragons moved and directly entered the cloud and fog.

The Divine Dragon was nowhere to be seen!

The middle-aged immortal God’s expression changed drastically, and the tree branches formed by his arms scattered in the cloud and fog.

“Ahhhh!”!

As time passed, his attacks became weaker and weaker, and the life force in his body became less and less.

Attacks that cost his life were destined to not last long.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

Just as the middle-aged immortal God fell into a state of weakness, sharp wind needles pierced through the middle-aged immortal God like terrifying hidden weapons.

“Ahhhh!”

An anguished cry sounded out as the middle-aged immortal God’s body fell to the ground at a terrifying speed.

The fourth immortal God had fallen!

At this point, the Holy Doctor, Holy Medicine, and Immortal sect only had eight people left.

They would fall even faster.

“Boom! Boom!”

The battle that shook the heavens and earth spread out in all directions from ten thousand meters in the sky. All of China and the entire jianghu could hear it clearly.

Even the terrifying energy that came from this place spread far, far away.

Among the 30 immortal gods, there were two high-level immortals. This momentum shook the world.

The entire sky was like the end of the world. Any random attack that landed on the ground could cause a sea of fire and a crack.

“Whoosh! Whoosh!”

At this moment, one immortal God after another rushed over. The supreme elders of the Xuan Yuan clan and the Yuwen clan also arrived.

The Immortal Gods of the two immortal sects watched the battle in the sky from a distance, their faces filled with shock.

Their eyes swept across the entire battlefield and instantly understood.

“Is this the power of the Dragon Palace? It’s too powerful. Four immortal gods have died from the holy medicine and Holy Medicine!”

“Eighteen immortal gods versus eight. It’s a complete suppression. The two immortal sects are going to be finished!”

“The Dragon King’s strength is really unrivaled. The Dragon Palace should be the most powerful existence in the Jianghu!”

The Immortal Gods watched the battle in front of them, and their pupils couldn’t help but shrink. Shock appeared on their faces.

The Immortal Gods of the Dragon Palace were really invincible.

The supreme elder of the Yuwen clan’s face changed drastically when he saw how miserable the two immortal sects were.

Their relationship with the two immortal sects could be considered quite friendly. Not long ago, they had even discussed a series of cooperation.

Now, when he saw that the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect was about to be destroyed, his expression was somewhat unsightly.

“Brother Xuanyuan, should we stop them?”

The Yuwen clan’s supreme elder revealed a hesitant expression as he spoke to the Xuanyuan clan’s supreme elder at the side.

All the immortal sects of the Xuan Yuan clan fell silent after hearing this. They did not reply as they did not want to interfere.

If they were to interfere now, it was obvious that they had offended the dragon palace. With the Dragon King’s character, the two of them were destined to have a rift or even hatred.

“Dragon King, I think we should just forget about this battle. We should be lenient when possible. You have already killed five of their immortals. Let them pay a little more and let’s call it a day!”

The supreme elder of the Yuwen clan saw that the Xuanyuan clan did not respond. He took a deep breath and said to Wang Xian.

“What? are the Yuwen clan going to interfere?”

“What are they going to do?”

The voice of the Yuwen clan’s supreme elder shocked all the immortals and powerhouses around. They quickly looked over.

“Brother Yuwen, help us get through this crisis.”

When Bian Jiang Tu heard the voice of the Yuwen clan’s supreme elder, he disregarded his status and asked for help loudly.

Four immortals were killed in just ten minutes. He was really afraid.

“You dare to interfere?”

Wang Xian turned his head and stared at them with a cold gaze.

“Ah!”

At this moment, a scream was heard. A terrifying flame suddenly shot up into the sky.

Unparalleled pressure, suppress heaven and earth!
