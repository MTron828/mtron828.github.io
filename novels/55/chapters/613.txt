Chapter 614: Wait While I Kill Them (1)

Hehe!

Feeling the gazes from hundreds of thousands of people, Xiaoxiao felt a little shy as she flapped her wings and moved towards the platform on the peak.

However, she was completely dumbfounded when she was approaching the platform and saw a familiar figure.

It’s her? I had not expected her to be from Da Hong Immortal Sect!

However, Wang Xian frowned and clearly wasn’t very excited upon seeing the young girl.

He had seen the young girl previously. She was a disciple of the Sect Leader of the Sacred Followers Guild.

“He... Why would it be him...? This...?”

Xiaoxiao was dumbfounded at this moment. She stared blankly at Wang Xian and mumbled, “Dragon King! Why is he...? It’s really him...!”

“Xiaoxiao, come to my side!” At this moment, a girl on the platform signaled to her.

She flew mechanically towards the platform while her gaze was still locked tightly on Wang Xian.

“Xiaoxiao, what are you looking at?” When the girl on the platform saw the blank look on Xiaoxiao, she asked this curiously.

“Dragon King! He is the Dragon King! What a surprise! Really unexpected!” Xiaoxiao shouted abruptly.

Her eyes widened and stared at Wang Xian with disbelief.

Huh?

Her sudden actions drew the attention of the remaining supreme talents on the stage as they looked over inquisitively.

“What’s the matter, Xiaoxiao?”

The girl placed her arms on Xiaoxiao’s shoulders and asked.

“Mm. We meet again!”

Wang Xian turned around, looked at Xiaoxiao and revealed a faint smile.

Xiaoxiao’s expression changed and she started observing Wang Xian from top to bottom while ignoring the girl beside her. With a surprised look, she remarked, “I had not expected you to be still alive!”

Wang Xian smiled and said with confidence, “Who could possibly kill me?”

“Xiaoxiao, do you know the Dragon King from Da Hong Immortal Sect?”

Seeing that Xiaoxiao was ignoring her, the girl beside Xiaoxiao frowned and asked again.

Around them, the supreme talents watched curiously.

“Dragon King from Da Hong Immortal Sect?”

Xiaoxiao stared at the Dragon King and said with her eyes shimmering, “He isn’t the Dragon King from Da Hong Immortal Sect!”

Huh?

The other girl and the surrounding supreme talents were astonished.

Wang Xian looked plainly at her and didn’t attempt to stop her. He knew that he wouldn’t be able to do so.

“He’s the Dragon King from the Dragon Sect. The Dragon King from Dragon Sect of the real world!” Xiaoxiao stared intensely at Wang Xian as she increased her volume.

“What?”

The surrounding supreme talents were stunned and surprised.

“In the real world, the Dragon King from the Underworld established the Dragon Sect st the age of twenty. With the forces of his Dragon Sect, he triumphed over the strongest expert of the alliance of the orthodox sects, Nie Wushuang, and Emperor Qi from Diabolism. In the battle at the peak of Huashan, he broke the defensive spirit array of Yong Chang world and entered our world. I thought he would be killed by the attacks of the spirit array but he survived unexpectedly.” Xiaoxiao added this emotionally. Her face was flushed and a myriad of emotions filled her eyes.

She was shocked but also respected Wang Xian!

“What? Dragon King from the real world?” Ge Wen exclaimed with astonishment as he flew up.

The surrounding supreme talents were equally astonished. “Junior sister Xiaoxiao, you are saying he’s from the real world? This... This... How did he get into our Yong Chang world!”

“It’s definitely him. I’m certain that I didn’t mistake him for someone else. It is him! Are you the Dragon King from the Dragon Sect?” Xiaoxiao pointed at Wang Xian and asked loudly.

The edge of Wang Xian lips curved upwards as he replied, “I’m the Dragon King of Dragon Sect from the real world. Nice to meet everyone!”

I’m the Dragon King of Dragon Sect from the real world. Nice to meet everyone!

Upon hearing Wang Xian, the eyes of the surrounding supreme talents widened in disbelief.

All of them turned around and stared at Wang Xian vigilantly.

“He’s from the real world? Who would have expected you to be from the real world!”

The supreme talents growled with astonishment while their eyes widened.

The outside world and an outsider!

“You are from the real world! What are you plotting? To infiltrate our Immortal Sects?”

Ao Shuwen’s expression changed and he shouted loudly!

His voice reverberated across tens of kilometers. All the disciples around could hear him clearly.

“What’s the situation? What’s happening? An outsider from the real world?”

Seeing the sudden changes happening on the stage on the peak, the surrounding hundreds of thousands of disciples were dumbfounded. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Everyone stood up, while feeling a little confused, and stared fervently at the platform.

“I got to this place by accident and it’s only natural for me to want to make a name for myself here!”

Wang Xian smiled faintly and turned to Xiaoxiao. “Hey girl, you have disrupted my plan!”

“A man from the real world! What are your intentions for joining our three Immortal Sects and entering the Yong Chang world?”

Ao Shuwen stared at Wang Xian while shouting again. His voice reverberated across the area with a radius of several tens of kilometers once again.

This time, everyone in the vicinity had their doubts confirmed.

“A man from the real world? Senior brother Ao Shuwen is saying that the Dragon King is from the real world!”

“Really? The Dragon King from Da Hong Immortal Sect is from the real world?”

Exclamations could be heard from below and the surrounding disciples were shocked.

The Elders from the three Immortal Sects flew towards the platform on the peak instantly.

“Elder Wang is from the real world?”

The Great Elder of Da Hong Immortal Sect instantly questioned this harshly.

Rumble!

Several Elders surrounded the platform in the peak completely. Their eyes were all fixed on Wang Xian!

Wang Xian looked at the fifty to sixty Budding Realm experts around him. Gradually, a smirk appeared on his face. He clasped his right fist with his left palm and said plainly, “Dragon King from the Dragon Sect of the Underworld. Nice to meet everyone!”

“He’s really from the real world!”

Disbelief beamed in the eyes of the Great Elder of Da Hong Immortal Sect.

The Dragon King was actually from the real world! A genius like him... A demon-like talent like him was from the world that was experiencing the Age of Dharma Decline?

This was unbelievable for them.

How could such a demon-like talent exist in the real world?

“You definitely have ill intentions for joining our Da Hong Immortal Sect. Speak! What are your intentions?”

An Elder from Da Hong Immortal Sect questioned Wang Xian harshly.

“Regardless, his intentions wouldn’t be kind. Let’s just kill him! Kill him!”

Ao Shuwen seconded this loudly. Dense killing intent was beaming in his eyes.

“That’s right. Cripple his cultivation and interrogate him about his sinister plot!”

Several Elders from Yong Chang Immortal Sect remarked harshly as ruthlessness flashed across their eyes.

“Just kill him!” an Elder from Immortal Slaying Sect shouted.

With the crowd cheering for the killing of the Dragon King, the Elders from the three Immortal Sects felt compelled to take action but were hesitant as they stared at him.

“Feng Family, Ao Family, Dong Family, Liang Family... Hehe! It seems like the warning I sent out to you guys for trying to assassinate me wasn’t sufficient!”

Wang Xian looked across the Elders that spoke and ruthlessness flashed in his eyes.
