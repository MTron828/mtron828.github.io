Chapter 1001: 1,002 people were killed by me

Translator: 5496903

The expressions of the young master’s mercenary group changed drastically.

Snake scar stared at the members of the Void Beast mercenary group and the amethyst mercenary group with a gloomy expression.

If these two mercenary groups really wanted to become enemies with them and protect that new student, he really didn’t dare to make a move.

The Amethyst and void Beast’s strength was enough to make their young master’s mercenary group unable to move an inch.

But in front of so many people, if they let that kid go, wouldn’t it be a huge humiliation in the future?

The surrounding Demon Hunters Academy looked at this scene with their mouths Agape.

They never would have thought that a freshman would actually be able to make the two large mercenary groups of the Academy Act to protect him.

With the amethyst and void beast around, who would dare to bully him?

“Good, good. Zhang Yitian, Xiahou Ming, you are clearly making our young master’s mercenary group embarrassed, right? Today’s matter, I, Snake Mark, will remember it!”

Snake Mark’s face was gloomy as he glared at them with a pair of triangular eyes.

This made Zhang Yitian and Xia houming smile in disdain.

“Brat, just you wait. Don’t think that just because you have the protection of the amethyst mercenary group and the Void Beast mercenary group, I can’t do anything to You!”

Snake mark saw their expressions and felt even more embarrassed. He stared at Wang Xian and growled.

“Hehe, a bunch of trash. I would like to know what you guys have up your sleeves!”

Wang Xian, who had been silent all this while, heard what he said and said in a slightly mocking tone.

“You...”

He didn’t expect that he would dare to mock him. His expression changed drastically as he stared at Wang Xian. “Just you wait. I, Snake Hen, will not be human until I kill you!”

A ferocious growl was heard, causing the hearts of the people around them to turn cold.

They looked at Wang Xian with a strange expression.

You said that you were mocking snake mark at this moment and making him lose face. Aren’t you going to fight to the death with him?

Now that the amethyst and void Beast had made a move, could it be that he would be with them every day?

“Isn’t he courting death on Purpose?”

“That’s right, he is totally provoking snake mark. No matter what, Snake Mark is a very famous figure in the demon Hunters Academy and even the East Sea City!”

“It’s too unwise. If he doesn’t say such words of provocation, snake mark might really not dare to touch him in the future. But now, if Snake Mark doesn’t take revenge in the future, he will become the laughing stock of many people!”

The surrounding students looked at Wang Xian who didn’t seem to care and shook their heads slowly.

If he didn’t seek death, he wouldn’t die.

Snake mark stared at Wang Xian with a face full of killing intent. He, Snake Mark, had never suffered such humiliation before.

After being provoked by a freshman, even if he had two large mercenary groups behind him, he wouldn’t let it go.

Everyone wanted a face!

When the people from Amethyst Mercenary Group and void Beast mercenary group saw Wang Xian’s provocation, they smiled slightly.

They knew Wang Xian’s strength. So what if he provoked a young master’s mercenary group?

“The bunch of fellows who came to kill me the last time are already dead. Welcome to send yourselves to your deaths!”

However, Wang Xian opened his mouth and said something that caused the entire banquet to fall into dead silence.

When he finished his sentence with a smile on his face, everyone’s breathing stopped.

Even the members of the amethyst mercenary group and the Void Beast mercenary group stared at Wang Xian with their eyes wide open in shock.

“What? Yun Hanhai was killed by you!”

A Ray of light shot out from Snake Scar’s eyes as he glared at Wang Xian and roared loudly.

Everyone around him was dumbfounded?

This... ? What was this Wang Xian doing? Was he courting death?

He actually said that Yun Hanhai and the rest were killed by him!

Regardless of whether this matter was true or false, this Wang Xian was definitely doomed.

The death of Yun Hanhai not only involved the young master’s mercenary group, but also the Yun family.

Once the Yun family found out that the future successor of the Yun family was killed by a student, they would definitely take revenge crazily.

“So what if I killed them?”

Wang Xian smiled faintly and swept his gaze across the young master’s mercenary group. “I just killed a bunch of trash!”

“You... you... Alright...”

Snake Scar Didn’t know what to say at this moment. He extended his finger and pointed at him. His arm was trembling slightly. “You’re dead. You’re Dead!”

“Hehe!”

Wang Xian smiled faintly at the side and didn’t seem to mind. “You’ve said this sentence many times already!”

“You’ll know the consequences very soon!”

Snake Mark’s eyes were a little red. He shouted coldly and walked out with a face full of anger.

“Zhang Yitian, Xia houming, this matter is not something that you guys can participate in anymore. Don’t Dig Your Own Grave!”

Snake Mark’s voice was heard, causing the young master’s mercenary group and the Void Beast mercenary group to show an embarrassed look.

They looked at Wang Xian with a helpless look in their eyes.

Why did you say that you killed Yun Hanhai and his men.

They died in the wilderness. Without evidence, the young master’s mercenary group wouldn’t dare to take revenge on the amethyst and void beast mercenary groups.

Now, he directly said that he was the one who killed Yun Hanhai and his men.

Then, this matter wasn’t something that they could withstand.

“Captain Wang, you...”

Zhang Yitian opened his mouth and said helplessly as he looked at Wang Xian. He really didn’t know what to say after that.

They knew that Wang Xian was very strong, but could he compete with the power behind the young master’s mercenary group?

Could he compete with the Yun Family?

“Big... Big Brother, I think you should stay in Donghai city for the time being. or... or go to another town!” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Xia Hou Ming hesitated for a moment before he said to him.

Wang Xian didn’t take snake scar and the rest to heart. He looked at the group of people who had suddenly appeared and a hint of doubt flashed across his eyes. “Thank you for your help earlier. However, do I know you all?”

When the students around heard Wang Xian’s words, the corners of their mouths couldn’t help but Twitch as they stared at him with widened eyes.

The group of girls from the amethyst mercenary group also looked over in astonishment.

What? They didn’t know each other?

Xia houming was also slightly taken aback. He didn’t expect that the other party had saved them two days ago. They had no idea who they had saved and didn’t even remember them.

This made him speechless.

It turned out that the other party didn’t care about them at all that day.

“Big Brother, five days ago in the thunderstorm area...”

“Oh, I got it. The group of people from cloud clam?”

Wang Xian was enlightened and interrupted him.

“Yes, yes. I really have to thank you for that day, Big Brother. Otherwise, we might not have been able to return!”

Xia houming nodded his head quickly and said gratefully.

“It was nothing!”

Wang Xian shook his head lightly.

“Captain Xia, Captain Wang, let’s sit down and talk!”

Zhang Yitian took a look at his surroundings and the students quickly returned to their seats.

Only the members of the tornado mercenary group walked out with a drastic change in expression.

The incident just now had a huge impact on him!

“But this time, even if that kid has three heads and six arms, he will still be finished!”

The captain of the tornado mercenary group took a deep breath and thought to himself with a solemn face.
