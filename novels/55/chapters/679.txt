“Roar!”

In the sea, the 70-80-meter-long Kun was floating quietly in the sea. Its five-to six-meter-wide eyes were staring at the place in front of it, emitting a fierce light.

On the Kun, AO Qitian stood in the front, followed by 800 demon monkeys.

This group of demon monkeys only had the strength of the infant realm. They were holding level-12 spirit weapon sticks in their hands.

Behind them, the group of demon monkeys stared at the front with blood-red eyes.

Ao Qitian slowly raised the metal rod in his hand and roared loudly.

“Roar, Kill!”

A low roar filled with killing intent was heard. Blood boiled, and demonic qi soared into the sky. The demon monkeys behind him attacked the group of Yin snakes in front of them at a terrifying speed.

Ao Qitian carried the metal rod on his shoulder, but he didn’t move. His gaze was fixed on the leader of the Yin Snakes Group, big snake, in the middle.

An immortal-level existence!

“Who is that?”

Big Snake licked his tongue and his triangular eyes revealed a cold expression. “There is actually an immortal-level existence. Where did this force come from?”

He stared at the Devil Monkey who was attacking them directly, and his gaze swept across the Dolphins on the Kun.

“Fighting with me, Big Snake, a beast!”

A trace of coldness flashed in the snake’s eyes. It stared at AO qitian and growled in a low voice.

“Roar, I am AO qitian!”

When the demon monkey heard the snake’s voice, his body slowly began to change. Layers of scales covered his entire body, and his fangs were exposed.

“I will tear you apart today!”

The Demon Monkey roared and moved, directly charging toward the snake.

“Roar!”

In an instant, the demon monkey’s figure increased to seven to eight meters, and the cudgel in his hand smashed towards the huge snake.

“Beast!”

The huge snake waved its arm, and the grey poisonous snake on its neck turned into a dozen meters in size, and its huge mouth directly bit towards the demon monkey.

“Roar!”

Ao Qitian’s cudgel directly smashed towards the huge grey snake.

The grey snake twisted its body and wrapped itself around the cudgel, crawling towards ao Qitian along the way.

Ao Qitian’s expression did not change. When the grey snake’s huge mouth bit towards his head.

“Roar!”

Ao Qitian suddenly had a burst. The Devil Qi on his body suddenly condensed into a black devil dragon, and a terrifying Dragon’s aura directly covered it.

The grey snake’s body trembled.

Dragon’s might!

Ao qitian, who had fully unleashed his dragon bloodline, could fully activate his divine dragon bloodline. In terms of combat strength, among those of the same level, perhaps only ao Jian, who cultivated the heartless sword principle, could fight with him.

“Bang!”

Ao Qitian’s large hand grabbed the giant gray snake and threw it ruthlessly toward the bottom of the sea.

“Boom!”

The terrifying power caused a huge wave to rise from the bottom of the sea.

“AH, be careful!”

At this moment, Xiao Yu, Tang Yinxuan, and the others, who were watching from the Kun, saw the huge snake suddenly appear above ao Qitian’s head. The terrifying poisonous fangs attacked his head, and they warned him loudly.

“HMPH!”

Ao Qitian’s ears twitched, and with a cold shout, a tail that was more than ten meters long swept towards the huge snake.

“Boom!”

The terrifying collision instantly caused the sea water within a radius of several kilometers to surge in all directions.

“What... What a terrifying battle!”

Tang Yinxuan’s eyes widened, and a look of disbelief appeared on her face. The battle before her eyes was too terrifying.

Each and every move had the power to destroy the heavens and earth. Even the entire sea was surging wildly in the aftermath of their battle.

“Ahhhh!”

In the surrounding area, the devil monkeys that were emitting monstrous demonic qi were like the devil monkeys in the chaotic world, tearing apart the members of the Yin Snake Group.

The devil monkeys were considered relatively weak among the few races in the Dragon Palace.

Their strength, which was at the lowest level of the Xiantian realm, was completely unleashed. It was simply not something that existences of the same level could withstand.

With a body size of three to four meters, terrifying defense, and powerful strength, they directly tore the members of the Yin Snake Group into pieces.

“Water-extinguishing Cannonball, you guys deserve to die!”

Seeing the deaths of his subordinates, the big snake’s eyes turned cold. With a wave of his arm, a 100-meter-long water cannonball directly attacked the surrounding demon monkeys.

“Your opponent is me. Today, I will use your blood to pay tribute to the water tribe that you have killed!”

Ao Qitian waved his arm, and the 100-meter-long Devil Qi directly dispersed the water cannonball. Then, he waved the stick in his hand again.

“Damn Beast!”

The snake stared at Ao Qitian with an embarrassed expression. The sea water within a few kilometers of him surged violently, and a sea python condensed from water energy gathered around him.

Each sea python was several thousand meters in size, and they exuded a terrifying power.

“Roar!”

Ao Qitian stood at the bottom of the sea. The Demonic Dragon formed from demonic energy rose from his body, and it stared coldly at the giant snake above his head.

“Kill!”

The Sea Python that was several thousand meters in size charged at Ao Qitian, and the demonic dragon above ao Qitian’s head met it directly.

The Blue Sea Python collided with the Black Demonic Dragon.

Boom

The terrifying collision of energy instantly caused the mountain peak at the bottom of the sea to fall to one side.

At this moment, on the island at the side, the island had a circumference of about five kilometers. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

On the island, two powerful top-tier forces were sitting cross-legged and cultivating.

The old man with the red metal mask and the two-headed woman instantly stood up when the terrifying energy came from below.

“There’s an immortal God fighting!”

“It’s the big snake. That guy is fighting with another immortal God!”

“Hehe, it might be a powerful creature from the bottom of the sea. The big snake is really unlucky. It would be interesting if it died!”

The two people let out gloating smiles. Their bodies slowly floated in the air and looked down.

“Boom!”

However, at this moment, the entire island suddenly split open and sank to the bottom of the sea.

“Damn you, wasting our time!”

The two-headed woman, Yan Mei, let out overlapping and sinister sounds. With a wave of her arm, the area where the island split open actually overlapped under the mighty force.

“The range of the battle between the two immortal gods is too large. All of you, move aside!”

The old man in the Red Mask said in a deep voice to his subordinates.

“Boom!”

At this moment, a huge snake with blue energy all over its body rushed out of the sea.

At the same time, AO qitian, who was seven to eight meters in size, also came out of the water.

“You two, come and help me kill this beast!”

The huge snake looked at the old man with Yanmei’s two heads and the red mask and growled in a low voice.

“Hehe, why are we fighting? What does it have to do with us?”

The two of them smirked and hovered in the air, looking at each other mockingly.

“Hehe, they’re fighting, they’re fighting!”

“Don’t worry, as long as we can get one or two immortal god-level corpses, we’ll be lucky. If we both get injured, that’ll be even better. Hehe, the appearance of Yu Ding, the immortal God’s corpse, is good news for us!”

In the air, two pairs of blood-red eyes stared downwards. Their eyes were filled with greed, excitement, and bloodlust!
