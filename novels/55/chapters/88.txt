“Young Master Wang, I’ve got the paperwork done for the car. Here’s the key.”

“No, Young Master Wang, I cannot take your money. Just take it as a gift from me. Thank Young Master Wang for treating my injuries. Take care and goodbye!”

Back in the showroom where the Bentley 4S showroom was, Ren Anzhi was thanking Wang Xian with respect and enthusiasm.

Wang Xian smiled when he saw his look. “Good, I’m going off now.”

“Young Master Wang, take care!” Ren Anzhi continued with a polite smile.

Wang Xian nodded and handed the car key to Xiao Yu. “Xiao Yu, you’ll drive. Let’s go.”

“Oh, oh!” Xiao Yu nodded. She took over the key hurriedly and unlocked the pink Bentley.

They’d gotten the luxury car without paying a single cent on it.

Wang Xian sat in the car and watched smilingly at his sister who drove the car out.

Ren Anzhi watched as the car dove away. He wiped the sweat on his forehead with a complicated expression on his face. “What a domineering existence. I wonder if I should feel fearful or lucky to meet someone like him. Whatever it is, never provoke him! Never!”

He could destroy you when he is unhappy and heal you easily when he is in a good mood.

Radiance flickered in Ren Anzhi’s eyes as he spun his head around slowly. He gazed at Lin Feng and the pretty girl, who were standing at the entrance.

Just then, Lin Feng slapped the girl furiously. Because of her, he’d provoked that terrifying existence.

“Lin Feng, count yourself unlucky to have provoked Young Master Wang,” Ren Anzhi said with icy cold eyes as he walked in slowly.

Not many people knew what had happened in the 4S showroom. Those who knew did not dare to spread the word around.

“Gosh, aren’t they... aren’t they Xiao Yu and her brother?”

However, a group of young people saw what had happened just now not far away.

They saw Xiao Yu driving out with a brand-new pink Bentley. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

It was a high-class luxury car, Bentley.

Jia Wenrui, Jiang Shuang and the rest watched in surprise as the pink Bentley disappeared before them.

“Her brother is rich! He actually bought her a Bentley. That luxury car costs about $5 million.”

“Gosh, this is incredible. Too incredible!”

Several young people could not help but exclaim. They never thought that Xiao Yu’s brother was that awesome.

Jia Wenrui stood there with a mixed expression of fascination and awkwardness.

Jiang Shuang was dumbfounded. Apart from being jealous, there was nothing else left for her.

Bentley... Her dad was unwilling to buy a Bentley for her.

“Senior Wang Xian, you’re way too suave! The person whom Director Cui called was so terrified of you. He even gave us a free car!” Back in the car, Xiao Mi spoke to Wang Xian with admiration.

“Brother, you have become so awesome now!” Xiao Yu exclaimed too.

“Haha, don’t you know who your brother is? Your brother is a legend,” Wang Xian laughed and replied loudly.

Xiao Yu also beamed, “My brother is the best!”

“Where are we going now, Brother?”

“It’s almost evening time. I’ll take you to my restaurant for dinner.”

Wang Xian looked at the time. He gave Xiao Yu the directions too.

“Restaurant? Brother, where is your restaurant? Is it near the school?” asked Xiao Yu curiously.

“Yes, it’s near the school.”

After talking to Xiao Yu and Xiao Mi, the car reached the entrance of the old street half an hour later.

“Cars are prohibited inside. You’ve got to park the car in the parking lot,” Wang Xian told his sister.

“Yes, brother!”

After they walked out of the car, Wang Xian began to introduce the old street to them.

“This street is known as the old street. You can shop for stuff and have your meals on this street in the future. My restaurant is inside.”

As they walked, he introduced the delicious breakfast places and some street food to his sister.

Xiao Yu nodded her head continuously as she asked questions curiously.

Holding her brother’s arm, Xiao Yu felt relaxed and happy.

“This is my restaurant,” Wang Xian said to Xiao Yu when they arrived at the entrance of First-grade Restaurant.

Both of them looked up and were slightly stunned when they saw the restaurant’s name.

“First-grade Restaurant, such a familiar name!” Xiao Yu murmured.

“Xiao Yu, isn’t this the restaurant that gained popularity on the internet lately? It was known to be the country’s best restaurant.” Xiao Mi thought of the news she read recently and spoke in surprise.

“Yes, I remember. First-grade Restaurant. Brother, never did I expect that the First-grade Restaurant belongs to you. This restaurant is famous now!” Xiao Yu stared at Wang Xian and cried out in surprise.

“Come on in. I’ll treat you to a big feast tonight.”

Wang Xian chuckled as he led them inside.

“Director Wang.”

“Boss!”

As soon as the greeters saw him, they immediately greeted him.

“Okay.” Wang Xian nodded at them as he looked inside.

It was only 6 pm, and there were almost 80 people in the queue. It was not hard to imagine the popularity of the First-grade Restaurant.

“Director Wang!” Upon seeing the arrival of Wang Xian, Manager Huang hurried on his way over.

“Did you reserve the seat I asked you to? I’m going to treat my sister to dinner. Get the kitchen to prepare Two-headed Abalone, Atlantic Bluefin Marlin sashimi, and Chinese Bahaba fish gelatine. On top of that, prepare some specialty dishes too,” said Wang Xian to Manager Huang.

“Yes, the seat has been reserved for you. I’ll get the kitchen to prepare your dishes.”

Manager Huang nodded as he swept his gazes across Xiao Yu and Xiao Mi behind him. Finally, he fixed his gaze on Xiao Yu.

“Okay.” Wang Xian nodded. Then he went into the office and got Guan Shuqing out.

“Xiao Xian, is this your sister, Xiao Yu?” asked Guan Shuqing with a smile. She walked out and spotted Xiao Yu, who looked somewhat alike to Wang Xian.

“Yes, this is Xiao Yu, and this is her best friend, Xiao Mi. Xiao Mi, this is Guan Shuqing, and she’s your senior from now on.” Wang Xian nodded.

“Hello, Xiao Yu and Xiao Mi!” Guan Shuqing grinned as she waved and greeted them.

“Hello, Sister!” Xiao Yu looked at the beautiful and elegant Guan Shuqing. She leaned to Wang Xian and whispered in his ears, “Brother, is she...my Sister or sister-in-law?”

“What are you thinking?” Wang Xian patted her head. “Let’s go for our dinner.”

“Brother, I’ve realized that I’m simply too happy right now. With good food and nice clothes. Hehe, I’m so happy to be attending university!”

“My Xiao Yu will be the little princess from now on!”

“Brother, you are wonderful!”

“Enough of the sweet-talk. I’ll send you back after dinner. You’ve been running around for the entire day. Rest well tonight. Report to school tomorrow first thing, and I’ll bring you out again!”

Wang Xian and Xiao Yu grinned at each other. Guan Shuqing was also gazing at them with a smile on her face.
