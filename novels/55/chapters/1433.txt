Chapter 1434: 1434 gave the order

“Every faction will send out one-third of their forces. This... This is an all-out war with the Demon Beast Clan!”

“One-third of their forces?”

When Crown Prince Bloodflow finished speaking, some of the factions frowned slightly and discussed in low voices.

“Our Zero Glory Dynasty agrees with Your Highness Crown Prince. We will definitely comply!”

“Our Storm Dynasty will listen to the orders of Bloodflow dynasty!”

Very quickly, the various factions voiced their agreement.

Within these dynasties, there were only 20 to 30 insightful emptiness realm experts. Even if they were to send out a third of their strength, it would still be acceptable.

Moreover, the upcoming war was hard to say.

Most importantly, once the bloodshed empire made a decision, they had no right to resist at all.

Their dynasty’s strongest expert was only at the fourth level of the insightful emptiness realm. If the bloodshed empire wanted to destroy them, it would be a piece of cake.

Sect Master Ling’s expression did not change at all when he heard his words.

“I have a piece of information here. This is what our blood flow dynasty has gathered!”

“The zero glow dynasty now has 28 insightful void realm experts!”

“The North Spirit Dynasty has 33 insightful void realm experts!”

“The storm dynasty has 23 insightful Void Realm Experts!”

“The Sky Sword sect has 393 insightful void realm experts!”

...

Prince Bloodflow looked at the numbers on the data and said indifferently.

This caused all the forces in the flowing sea region to be slightly shocked, and their faces revealed a shocked expression.

“The Bloodflow dynasty has actually found out the number of experts in each of our forces!”

The expressions of the kings and sect leaders of some dynasties and sects changed slightly. These numbers were considered confidential to them.

However, the blood flow empire was able to find out so easily.

As expected of the overlord of the flowing sea region.

The eyes of all the experts flashed. They knew that it was impossible to hide this information.

One by one, the insightful emptiness realm experts were called out by Prince blood flow.

The Sky Sword sect and a few other large forces were slightly unhappy.

“There’s one dynasty that surprised me the most. The dragon-phoenix Dynasty has at least 537 insightful emptiness realm experts!”

“It really surprises us. 537? Our bloody flow dynasty only has a little more than you guys!”

Prince bloody flow said as he looked in the direction of Feng Luan, his eyes shining.

“What? More than 500 insightful emptiness realm experts! How... How is this possible?”

“As far as we know, there are only more than 300. How can there be so many?”

Some of the dynasty’s forces revealed shocked expressions as they looked over with their eyes wide open.

Feng Luan frowned slightly and took a sip of the tea beside her. There was no change in her expression.

She knew that the blood flow empire must have included the Dragon Palace’s strength that they knew.

She looked at Wang Xian.

Wang Xian smiled and didn’t mind.

Sect leader Ling of the Heaven Sword sect, the King of the Light Dragon Empire, and sect leader Yi of the blood flow sect all looked at Feng Luan. Their eyes were also filled with astonishment.

More than 500 insightful void martial artists had hidden their strength too deeply.

If one didn’t count their top-notch combat strength, the dragon-phoenix Empire was only slightly weaker than the blood flow empire.

Even the heaven sword sect couldn’t compare to them!

Seeing that Feng Luan did not show any fluctuations, prince blood flow slightly raised his eyebrows and revealed a satisfied expression.

“This is a map of the demon beasts in the human-demon graveyard. In a few days, we will attack every demon beast race and disrupt their plans to establish an empire!”

As the sixth prince spoke, he waved his arm and a huge map appeared in the air.

The map clearly recorded the distribution of the forces of each Demon Beast Race.

“Among the Demon Beast Race, the Blood Barbaric Demon Beast, the Demon Scale Demon Beast, and the Bloodthirsty Sea Demon Beast are the most powerful. They have experts at the sixth level of the profound void tier!”

“According to the information we received, the strongest experts of these three demon beast races are gathered here to discuss the matter of establishing the Imperial Palace!”

“Therefore, we will launch a sneak attack on all the demonic beast races’lairs in five days’time to disrupt their plans!”

Prince Bloodflow said as he pointed with his arm.

“The Heaven Sword sect and the blood stream sect are in charge of launching a sneak attack on the Demonic Beasts’lairs. The Light Dragon Dynasty, the Hanhai dynasty, and the Divine Wind Academy are in charge of the bloodthirsty sea demon race, and the Dragon Phoenix dynasty is in charge of the Blood Barbaric Demon Beast Race!”

“Wait!”

Prince Blood Stream pointed at the map in the sky as he spoke.

However, before he could finish his words, he was interrupted by sect leader Ling.

“Oh? Sect leader Ling, Does Your Sky Sword sect have any objections?”

Prince Blood Stream looked at the sect leader of the Sky Sword sect with a smile on his face as he spoke indifferently. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

On the contrary, when the surrounding dynasty forces heard Prince Blood Stream’s words, they heaved a sigh of relief in their hearts.

Handing over these three strongest demonic beast races to the top-tier factions in the Bloodflow region was the best choice in their eyes.

“I don’t have any objections to our Sky Sword sect facing the Demonic Lin Demonic Beast race. Facing the powerful demonic beast race, only a few of our factions are able to deal with them. However, you’ve given away all three great demonic beast races. I want to ask, what is your bloodflow empire doing?”

Sect leader Ling asked the blood flow empire with a calm expression.

“Our blood flow empire is in charge of the overall situation...”

“This is an order, this is not a discussion!”

Prince blood flow said. Suddenly, an old man holding a blood red scepter at the back slowly raised his head and said calmly.

Prince blood flow was slightly stunned and slowly raised his head.

“This...”

“As expected of the Bloodflow Empire, incomparably overbearing!”

“The Bloodflow Empire has dominated for thousands of years, so it naturally has this strength. Even if the Spirit Sword sect has a sixth level void interpretation expert, it still can’t change the overall situation!”

When the surrounding people heard the old man’s words, their pupils slightly constricted and they pursed their lips.

The entire hall became silent.

This was the might of the blood flow empire.

“Hehe, our blood flow empire naturally can not just stand by and watch. In the end, we still have to rely on our blood flow empire when facing the Demon Beast Empire!”

Prince blood flow said indifferently and shrugged his shoulders slightly.

Sect leader Ling of the Sky Sword sect frowned slightly. His expression was somewhat unsightly as his eyes flickered.

“We don’t have the strength to let our dragon-phoenix Empire Face the Blood Barbaric Demon Beast!”

At this moment, Feng Luan frowned slightly and said directly.

“Hehe, your dragon-phoenix Empire is so strong, how can we not do it!”

At this moment, the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop, which were sitting at the front and two sides, stared at Feng Luan with smiles on their faces and said with a smile.

They finally understood the blood flow empire’s plan today.

They didn’t even need to do it themselves. The dragon-phoenix Empire would suffer heavy losses, and they could even use the dragon-phoenix Empire to weaken the demonic beasts.

Killing two birds with one stone, killing two birds with one stone!

“You’ve underestimated your strength, this queen. If the sixth level of the profound void tier isn’t here, you have the supreme prodigy. It’s Just a Blood Savage demonic beast. You can still deal with it!”

Prince blood flow looked at Feng Luan and slowly picked up the wine cup.

“Moreover, this is an order!”

“Who else has an opinion?”
