Chapter 570: Demon-like master (2)

The entire Mt Xue was the liveliest place in Da Hong Immortal Sect.

Countless female disciples were cultivating and practicing on the training field. There were also disciples from other mountain sects. Some of them were even graciously guiding the female disciples.

Mt Xue was able to rank second among mountain sects because they had the true strength to support their ranking instead of relying on the privileges of female disciples.

One could easily tell from the strength of Piao Lingxue.

“Wanbai, inform Beiling, Beibei and the rest. Ask them to gather those disciples who are interested. I’ll be bringing all my spiritual stones here first!”

When the two girls arrived at Mt Xue, Piao Lingxue spoke to the young girl, Wanbai.

“Alright, Sister Xue. I’ll look for Sister Beiling and Sister Beibei while you go get your spiritual stones!”

Wanbai smiled and nodded her head. The next instant, she took off on her sword towards the peak of Mt Xue before shouting down, “Hey sisters, did anyone see Sister Beiling and Sister Beibei?”

“Junior sister Wanbai!”

“Junior Sister Wanbai!”

When the crowd heard Wanbai’s voice, they lifted their heads with smiles. Several young men from other sects also greeted her with smiles.

Mu Wanbai was from the Mu Family. Other than the Immortals in Yong Chang world, her family was ranked in the top five.

Moreover, the dorky Mu Wanbai was really adorable.

“Senior sister Beiling and Senior sister Beibei are at that mountain peak. Some really handsome guys from Yong Chang Immortal Sect are here looking for them!” a female disciple shouted in response to Mu Wanbai.

“There are dogs trying to woo them?” Mu Wanbai mumbled to herself before she left on her sword.

“Dogs?”

Upon hearing Mu Wanbai, the disciples from various mountain sects could feel the edges of their mouths twitching uncontrollably!

“Sister Beiling, Sister Beibei!”

Mu Wanbai flew to the other mountain peak. She saw seven to eight sisters from the mountain sect and three young men wearing outfits from Yong Chang Immortal Sect.

“Wanbai!”

When the group saw Mu Wanbai, they smiled and asked, “Where’s Great Senior sister?”

“She went to get some stuff from her room and she will be here right away!”

Mu Wanbai descended on the peak and stole a few glances at the disciples from Yong Chang Immortal Sect while speaking. “Sister Beiling, Sister Beibei! Come! Follow Sister Xue and I to Yong Chang City in a while!”

“That... Sister Bei, aren’t you thinking of refining spiritual equipment? Get the materials required ready!”

“What’s the matter, Wanbai?”

The girl who was addressed as Beibei looked at Mu Wanbai curiously.

“It’s a grave matter! Where should I start...?”

Mu Wanbai tilted her head and said, “Sister Xue and I will be bringing you to a cheapskate master. Let’s see if any other senior or junior sisters require refining of elixir pills or equipment!”

“Master? What master?”

Several female disciples around Beibei were taken aback. Even those young disciples from Yong Chang Immortal Sect were curious.

“A blacksmith master. If we introduce business to him, he will reduce the fees for Sister Xue to purchase her spiritual swords!” Mu Wanbai said.

“Blacksmith master? Introduce business?”

The crowd was taken aback. Blacksmith Master? Introduce business? That felt a little strange.

Would a blacksmith master require others to introduce business to him?

“Yep!”

Mu Wanbai nodded her head and continued, “He’s a cheapskate blacksmith master. Sister Xue will be here soon. Get all the other senior sisters and junior sisters. Gather all those who want to refine equipment and elixir pills over!”

“Junior sister Mu Wanbai, are you sure he’s a blacksmith master? The reason why we are here today is because we have convinced Senior brother Ou Ziming. He has agreed to help refine spiritual equipment for disciples of Mt Xue. As for refining elixir pills, you can leave it to Senior brother Ye Feng!”

At this moment, several young men from Yong Chang Immortal Sect frowned and explained to Mu Wanbai.

“Wan Bai, Senior brother Ye Feng has agreed to refine elixir pills for the disciples of our Mt Xue. This is a valuable opportunity!”

Beiling pulled Mu Wanbai aside, looked at one of the young men and spoke to her.

“Huh? Senior brother Ye Feng? Senior brother Ou Ziming?”

Mu Wanbai was taken aback as she looked at the prideful group of young men.

The young man lifted his head slightly. He was wearing exquisite red armor which emitted dense fire energy.

Despite facing everyone, he still looked as proud as a peacock!

“Senior brother Ye Feng!” Mu Wanbai exclaimed.

Ye Feng was a descendant of an Immortal in Yong Chang Immortal Sect. Although he was the tenth generation, he was still a descendant of an Immortal.

At the same time, Ye Feng was known for his incredible alchemy skills. He could refine Level 5 elixir pills.

His reputation could even match Ou Ziming.

And he was only in his thirties!

“Yeah!”

Ye Feng nodded his head plainly at Mu Wanbai, still looking as prideful as ever.

“Sister Beiling. Senior brother Ye Feng has just been able to refine Level 5 elixir pills. Level 5 elixir pills are only effective for Inborn-level disciples. For Dan Realm disciples, only Level 6 elixir pills would be useful!” Mu Wanbai said to the two tall girls by her side.

“Senior brother Ye Feng will be able to borrow the Wan Pill Cauldron from his family for the next month. His success rate for Level 5 elixir pills will be forty percent. Moreover, he has a certain chance of successfully refining Level 6 elixir pills with the effects of the Wan Pill Cauldron!” a young man from Yong Chang Immortal Sect added with a smile.

“Wan Pill Cauldron!”

Mu Wanbai gasped. That was a Level 13 alchemy furnace used by Immortals. When used for refining elixir pills, the success rate would be greatly enhanced.

“However...!”

Mu Wanbai turned around and said, “Sister Beibei, Sister Beiling! That guy in Yong Chang City is really incredible. Sister Xue’s Bo Yu was restored by him. Moreover, he used the remaining materials to forge six Level 11 hidden weapon type spiritual weapons. Sister Xue couldn’t afford them. However, that guy said he could reduce the price a little if Sister Xue introduces customers to him!”

“That guy restored Great Senior sister’s Bo Yu sword?”

Upon hearing her, Beibei and Beiling were astonished.

They also knew Great Senior sister’s Bo Yu sword was chipped. It was exceptionally difficult to restore.

They were shocked that the guy was able to restore it and curious about the identity of that guy.

“Yeah! He’s an extreme cheapskate!”

Mu Wanbai nodded her head and continued, “However, that guy is really incredible. He is a blacksmith master despite being just in his twenties!”

“A blacksmith master in his twenties? That’s not possible!”

Before Mu Wanbai could finish her words, Senior brother Ye Feng interrupted with a definitive tone.

“Yeah! It’s impossible to become a blacksmith master in one’s twenties. How can there be such a young blacksmith master?”𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Our Senior brother Ou Ziming is already regarded as a one in a thousand years blacksmith genius for being able to refine Inborn Spiritual equipment. How can there be a blacksmith master in his twenties!”

It wasn’t just the few disciples from Yong Chang Immortal Sect who snorted. Even Beibei, Beiling and other female disciples of Mt Xue couldn’t believe it as they shook their heads!

“Although I don’t believe he’s a blacksmith master either, the truth is the truth. Sister Xue’s Bo Yu sword was indeed restored by him!”

Seeing that the group didn’t believe her, Mu Wanbai pouted and added this remark.

“Are you sure? A blacksmith master in his twenties? Putting aside Yong Chang world, there’s not a single person who became a blacksmith master at this age!”

Senior brother Ye Feng snorted with indignance.
