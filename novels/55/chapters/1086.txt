He was defending a city by himself!

He was facing an army by himself!

The descent of the wood world and the spirit enchantment had always been Wang Xian’s most powerful combination of abilities.

Now, with the addition of the lightning strike wood in his hands,.

The Lightning Strike Wood was at the void interpretation level. The attack of the wood attribute was imbued with the lightning attribute.

This time, the thousands of trees that descended from the wood world were emitting a faint lightning glow.

Possessing spirits could give them intelligence. Even if their intelligence was not high, under the guidance of Wang Xian, they could double the power of the descent of the wood world.

In front of the north gate, after the arrival of the thousands of trees that looked like tree demons, everyone had shocked expressions on their faces.

The trees waved their densely packed branches and attacked the blood shadow walkers.

“Roar!”

The 70,000 to 80,000 blood shadow walkers showed no fear when they saw the incoming treants. They leaped up one by one. The dark red dark energy carried a strong corrosive force and attacked the group of Treants.

“Attack!”

Wang Xian, who was standing in the air, pointed his lightning strike wood finger. Countless branches were waved at the blood shadow walkers.

The Weakest Blood Shadow Walker at the forefront had the strength of a level three extraordinary.

However, these trees were, after all, Wang Xian’s strongest attack.

It was almost comparable to a strike of a half-step void interpretation. At the instant when all the trees attacked, the Blood Shadow Walker at the forefront died in large numbers under the countless branches.

With just one attack, at least 7,000 to 8,000 blood shadow walkers had died. There were also a few thousand who were severely injured.

“Bang Bang Bang!”

While the blood shadow strollers were panicking, thousands of trees that were hundreds of meters tall waved their branches again.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

At this moment, a sharp sound came from behind the Blood Shadow Strollers.

This sound instantly calmed all the blood shadow strollers down, and their eyes that were almost dripping blood revealed a cold light.

“WHOOSH WHOOSH WHOOSH!”

Tens of thousands of blood shadow Rambler directly jumped up, toward a group of trees attack.

After all, the descent of wood is a supernatural power of Wang Xian, in terms of flexibility is somewhat inadequate.

However, under so many trees, the second attack still easily killed 3,000 to 4,000 blood shadow walkers.

“Ho ho ho!”

The angry roar came again, and tens of thousands of blood shadow walkers trembled, and black raindrops attacked the trees.

“Bzzz bzzz!”

The black raindrops landed on the trees and made an uncomfortable sound.

When the trees were under a certain amount of attack, they slowly dissipated.

This caused the blood barbarian demonic beast that was controlled from behind to roar once again. More Blood Shadow Walkers attacked the trees one by one.

“This is the time!”

Wang Xian smiled when he saw the tens of thousands of blood shadow walkers attacking the trees one by one.

“Flame of the Fire Dragon!”

A terrifying flame burst out from his hand and was released directly at the location where the wood world was descending.

Wood-aided fire!

The moment the flame landed on the wood world, a huge fire rose up.

“Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!”

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

The Blood Shadow Walker who rushed into the wood world to destroy the trees was instantly covered in flames.

The terrifying flames directly engulfed over 10,000 blood shadow walkers.

“How terrifying! Oh My God, Wood and fire dual attributes!”

“Too strong, too strong! Commander Wang’s attacks are simply too strong!”

“These two attacks from Commander Wang directly killed at least 30,000 blood shadow walkers, and almost half of them were wiped out!”

When the flames shone on the group of people on the city wall, everyone had shocked expressions on their faces.

The two attacks had drowned out nearly 30,000 blood shadow striders. Almost half of them had been killed.

Everyone looked at Wang Xian like he was a demon.

“Human, you deserve to die!”

A brutal voice came from the back. The voice was hoarse and didn’t sound like a human.

Wang Xian stared at the back with a cold expression.

He raised the lightning strike wood in his hand and shouted, “Fight!”

“Fight!”

The people of Shenghai town behind them were excited. They raised their weapons and shouted loudly.

Wang Xian’s two attacks had helped them to finish off half of the Blood Shadow Ramblers. If they couldn’t hold on any longer, they would be useless!

“Ao Jian, all of you, charge with me!”

Wang Xian shouted softly. His eyes locked onto the five blood barbarian demonic beasts behind him. With a leap, he charged towards the back.

“Roar! Roar!”

One by one, the blood shadow walkers saw Wang Xian flying towards the back from the sky. They leaped up and attacked him.

Thousands of blood shadow walkers flew up. Ao Jian and the rest waved their arms and 11 golden sword rays slashed at him.

“Clang! Clang! Clang!”

The corpse of the Blood Shadow Walkers, which had been split into two, fell to the ground.

“Kill him!”

A brutal voice came from behind. A group of Blood Shadow Walkers, who were at transcendent level eight, attacked Wang Xian and the rest.

At the same time, the five blood savage beasts, who were at transcendent level nine, also attacked.

“Whoosh!”

The five blood savage beasts were like ghosts. A blood shadow flashed and appeared behind Wang Xian in an instant. Its sharp claws attacked directly at his back.

“HMPH!”

Wang Xian snorted coldly. His arm changed instantly and turned into a dragon claw that was two to three meters in size.

The Dragon Claw collided with the Blood Barbarian Demonic Beast’s attack.

Boom

After the terrifying collision, the body of the blood barbarian demonic beast was sent flying backward.

Wang Xian’s eyes flashed. A stream of flames landed on the body of the blood barbarian demonic beast instantly.

This was the flame of endless wood.

“Ahhhhh!”

The Flames landed on its body, causing it to let out a miserable cry.

The blood on its body churned, but it was unable to extinguish the terrifying flames.

“Bzzz bzzz!”

The Demonic Beast’s face was filled with fear as the blood on its body churned. A large amount of blood wrapped around the flames and fell to the ground. Only then did it manage to escape the burning of the endless wood flames.

“Blood Demon Shadow!”

At this moment, the blood shadows that filled the sky suddenly appeared around Wang Xian.

It was the supernatural ability of the Blood Demon Beast, Blood Demon Shadow.

The Blood Demon Beast excelled in speed. Under the influence of the supernatural ability, blood demon shadow, the five blood demons drew out tens of thousands of blood demon shadows and instantly surrounded him.

A faint smile appeared on Wang Xian’s face as he sized up his surroundings with his bewitching eyes.

A blood demon shadow was attacking him, and Wang Xian acted as if he was going to receive it.

However, a figure appeared silently behind him and attacked him.

“Assassinating? The strange demon can be considered your ancestor!”

A hint of disdain appeared in Wang Xian’s eyes. He clawed at the back with his dragon claws. “Go to Hell, gold-shattering void!”

The Dragon Claws instantly turned golden in color. Gold-shattering void could be used for single-target attacks as well as area-of-effect attacks.

As If can tear the void of the Golden Flash flash past!
