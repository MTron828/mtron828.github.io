Translator: 549690339

“Ding, the eye of light and darkness, endless wood, piercing pupil and the Eye of Heavenly Dragon are fused into the eye of light and Darkness Fire Dragon!”

“Ding, the void divine ability is transformed into the light and Darkness Void!”

“Ding, the formless divine ability is transformed into the light and Darkness Void!”

Just when Wang Xian was shocked by the heart of Light and darkness, the system’s voice sounded again.

This made him slightly stunned. With a thought, he immediately checked his information.

“I’ve actually comprehended all the supernatural powers of the prickly dragon, and it even evolved!”

“This heart of light and dark?”

Wang Xian frowned and checked the reward that he suddenly received in his mind.

When he finished reading the information about the heart of light and dark in his mind, his eyes sparkled.

The heart of Light and darkness was the Supreme Treasure of the Divine Dragon God of Light and darkness. It could be integrated into the heart.

The Divine Dragon God of Light and darkness was the only divine dragon among the divine dragons who possessed both the light and darkness attributes. His abilities were ranked in the top three among the divine dragons.

This heart of Light and darkness was a supreme treasure that he had obtained unintentionally. It was also because of the heart of Light and darkness that he was able to become the Divine Dragon of Light and darkness.

Just now, the heart of Light and darkness wanted to enter Wang Xian’s heart and turn him into the divine dragon of Light and darkness.

However, the power of the five elements was too powerful and directly repelled it. It could only reside in his mind.

Even so, Wang Xian had obtained quite a number of supernatural powers. It had even increased his strength by one level.

If he were to completely absorb the heart of light and darkness, his strength would definitely increase crazily. However, it was due to the attributes of the five elements.

Although Light and darkness were powerful, it was still impossible to replace the five elements.

“Although the heart of Light and darkness did not replace the five elements, it still allowed me to live with some supernatural powers. Does this mean that I have a chance to become a divine dragon with all attributes, including the five elements of light and darkness plus wind and thunder?”

Wang Xian thought to himself. However, he shook his head immediately. He did not dare to think of a divine dragon with all attributes.

“The thorned dragon is the descendant of the light and Dark Divine Dragon. As the saying goes, dragons have nine sons, and each of them is different. The thorned dragon has inherited the innate talent and attributes of the light and Dark Divine Dragon!”

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered as he looked at the heart of the thorned dragon.

A thorned dragon that was the size of a palm was a combination of light and darkness. Its form was similar to the AO Yaoyao of today. However, it was only half-light and half-darkness.

The Ao Yao could only be considered as a half-completed spiky dragon. The main reason was that it only possessed the light attribute. Hence, it became the current light spike.

In order to become a complete spiky dragon, one would need to evolve into a dark spike from a member of the Dragon Clan who possessed the darkness attribute.

However, when they were combined together, they would form a spiky dragon.

“Ao Yao!”

Wang Xian looked at the heart of the spiky dragon and shouted to the side.

“Dragon King!”

Ao Yao revealed herself and looked at the heart of the spiky dragon that was floating in the air. Her eyes sparkled.

“Absorb it and you should be able to evolve into a complete spiky dragon!”

Wang Xian said to Ao Yao.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Ao Yao nodded and aimed her claws at the body of the heart of the spiky dragon.

Buzz

The moment she touched it, the heart of the spiky dragon entered the body of the spiky dragon.

Boom

In an instant, it was as if an energy exploded from the body of the thorned dragon. One of his eyes turned into a strange black color.

Following that, half of his body began to slowly turn black.

Half of it was light, and the other half was darkness.

A real thorned dragon, wandering between light and darkness.

The strongest assassination dragon of the Divine Dragon Race, the thorned dragon!

“Boom!”

A strange aura was emitted from Ao Yao’s body. Darkness and light interweaved. The arm that had claws was emitting white light.

The scythe-like arm was emitting evil darkness.

Wang Xian waved his arm and quickly resisted ao Yao’s aura. A thick smile appeared on his face.

“Thank you, Dragon King!”

A few minutes later, Ao Yao kneeled on the ground respectfully and thanked him.

“Not bad. Although your level has only increased by one level, you are now qualified to hunt down a level seven extraordinaire!”

Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled. Ao Yao was already at the peak of level three extraordinaire. After the modification and evolution of the heart of the prickling dragon, he had directly upgraded to level four extraordinaire.

With the strength of level four of transcendence and the complete inheritance of the prickling dragon, it was sufficient for him to possess the strength of a true divine dragon.

Assassinating experts who were three levels above him.

“I have also obtained the divine ability of the prickling dragon. However, due to my size, I am still inferior to Ao Yao in assassination!”

Wang Xian looked at his arm. With a slight movement, his arm turned into nothingness.

This was the divine ability, nothingness. Other than these few divine abilities, the strongest one was the light and Dark Fire Dragon Eyes!

The light and dark fire dragon eyes were the fusion of four eye-related divine abilities.

Now, it had the same ability as before. It was even more powerful.

“The heart of light and dark is located at the head. The eyes are also located here. It must be affected by the heart of light and dark!”

Wang Xian thought to himself.

“Dragon King, all the missions have been selected!”

At this moment, a group of drakonids walked over and said to Wang Xian, “Dragon King, we have discovered something interesting. Someone has offered a high price to assassinate you!”

“Assassinate me?” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

When Wang Xian heard their words, a smile appeared on his face. “I’ve accepted the mission!”

“You’ve accepted it?”

The group of Drakonids were slightly stunned.

“I’ve accepted it. In shenghai town, there are only three people who will issue this mission. The leader of the squalid shark mercenary group, Bei Qianjun, and Qinggu Ya. After accepting the mission and receiving the reward, kill them all!”

Wang Xian said with a smile.

To hire an assassin, one had to give a reward in advance. After the reward was given, the assassin organization would take action.

Now, they found an assassin to assassinate him and actually found the dragon assassin organization. How interesting!

“It’s the Dragon King!”

The group of DRAKONIDS nodded their heads.

Wang Xian took out the communication stone plate and looked at the information on the mission. He shook his head slowly.

“After today, I believe the entire Shenghai Town will be in chaos. More than a dozen important figures, TSK TSK!”

Wang Xian passed the communication stone plate to AO yao and said, “After the DRAKONIDS receive their reward, we will act immediately!”

“Yes!”

Ao Yao nodded and disappeared in an instant.

This time, the communication stone plate in his hand disappeared as well.

In the past, if Ao Yao had something in his hand, he wouldn’t be able to disappear so quickly. Now, it was a piece of cake.

“Assassinating a level three extraordinary is equivalent to 20 dragon crystals in exchange for resources!”

“Level 4 transcendent is equivalent to 100 draconic crystals!”

“Level 5 transcendent is equivalent to 700 draconic crystals!”

“Level 6 transcendent is equivalent to 2,000 draconic crystals!”

“Level 7 transcendent is equivalent to 10,000 draconic crystals!”

“If these missions are completed and converted into resources, it can reach 5,000 draconic crystals. It can not level up, but it can raise the dragon spike to a terrifying level!”
