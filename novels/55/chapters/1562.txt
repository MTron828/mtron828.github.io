Chapter 1563: 1563 sages of Light 2

The next morning, Wang Xian stood in the house where Ling Jian ‘er was staying.

Looking at her who was sitting cross-legged on the bed cultivating, he waved his arm and threw the two statues at the entrance.

It was only when he saw Ling Jian ‘er open the door, pick up the two statues at the entrance and put them into his interspatial ring that he smiled and left.

Ao Yao was hiding in the surroundings, protecting her in the dark.

Ling Jian ‘ER stood in the courtyard and looked around in a daze. She did not find any traces.

Ao Jian and Ao Yao soon found a way to quickly gather resources.

They hunted the dark beasts and dark beasts in the ruins of the divine kingdom.

The Dark Beasts and Demon Beasts were a huge resource for the Dragon Palace. Although the Dragon Palace was not here, they could not turn them into dragon blood in the Dragon Pool.

However, they could preserve the corpses of the ferocious beasts and demonic beasts.

As the center of the vast region, the divine kingdom forest was extremely vast. It took up an area of more than 100,000 kilometers.

There were countless of ferocious beasts and demonic beasts living in it. The powerful ferocious beasts and demonic beasts were even feared by the three superpowers.

The Golden Swordfish and strange demon could hunt and kill the ferocious beasts and demonic beasts. They could collect their corpses and bring them to the Dragon Palace to increase their strength in the future.

Apart from visiting Ling Jian ‘er every day, Wang Xian would stay in his room to balance the light and dark attributes.

“All radiant priests, head to the front of Wuji Empire’s palace immediately. We, Wuji Empire, invite you!”

“All radiant priests, head to the front of Wuji Empire’s palace immediately. We, Wuji Empire, invite you!”

On the morning of the fifth day, a majestic voice suddenly resounded in the sky above the ruins of the entire divine kingdom.

The awe-inspiring voice carried an unquestionable tone as it resounded in everyone’s mind.

“Oh? What’s going on?”

“This awe-inspiring voice? This Is? This is the voice of the Wuji Empire’s ancestor!”

“Heavens, why would such a powerful figure personally order all the radiant priests to stand in front of the Wuji Empire’s Palace?”

When this voice sounded, everyone in the god nation ruins trembled slightly.

Even the other two superpowers and a group of first-rate forces looked in the direction of the Wuji Empire with faces full of shock.

“Order all the radiant priests in the divine kingdom ruins. has the Wuji Empire encountered any problems?”

Some experts were alarmed.

“Go, go, we’ll rush over immediately!”

“Quick, quick, the Patriarch of the Wuji Empire actually personally called for us to rush over!”

“Call all the priests of our Divine Light Empire. Go over immediately and call our patriarch!”

When the voice fell, everyone was shocked. All the radiant priests in the ruins of the divine kingdom were shocked and rushed over to the Wuji Empire.

The order from the Wuji Empire was so sudden. To call all the radiant priests in such a hurry meant that something big had happened.

Even the Divine Light Empire hurriedly ordered all the radiant priests of the Empire and even the patriarch to go over personally when they heard this voice.

“Eh? This voice? It should be coming from a powerhouse above level eight of the Void Interpretation Stage!”

When Wang Xian heard this voice, a hint of surprise appeared on his face.

A powerhouse above level eight of the void interpretation stage, a powerhouse at level nine of the void interpretation stage, would be considered a top-notch figure in the vast region.

Why would such a figure be so anxious?

“Reporting to the Dragon King!”

“We have received news that the Crown Prince of Wuji Empire, Wu Qing City, has suffered a serious injury in the black screen garden. Now, the Wuji Empire has summoned all the radiant priests to go and treat him!”

At this moment, a civil official of the Dragon Palace came in and reported to Wang Xian.

“Wu Qing city has suffered a serious injury?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and revealed a look of surprise.

“It’s the Dragon King. The exact injuries are unknown!”

The civil official nodded and said.

“It seems that Wuqing city’s injuries are not light. Otherwise, the ancestors of Wuji Empire wouldn’t be in such a hurry.”

Wang Xian thought to himself.

For Wuqing City to be appointed as the crown prince at such a young age, it showed how much importance the Wuji Empire placed on him.

Now that the Crown Prince’s life was in danger, it was a huge matter for the entire Wuji Empire.

Wang Xian didn’t go over. Although he was a radiant priest, he didn’t care about the Wuji Empire.

Furthermore, no one knew that he was here.

With his concealment ability, even if the Wuji Empire used all their strength, they wouldn’t be able to find him.

...

“Ahhhh!” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

At this moment, in front of the Wuji Empire’s palace in the god country ruins, screams of pain could be heard.

Several hundred experts from the Wuji Empire stood beside a young man.

The young man’s entire body was pitch-black, emitting waves of terrifying demonic qi.

His face was somewhat distorted and malevolent, and his left and right faces seemed to have their own lives.

“Sigh, I can’t suppress it. There are too many darkness souls in his body. More than ten sixth level void interpretation darkness souls have lives. Once I want to get rid of them, they will immediately devour Qing City!”

“Bastards! How are you protecting Qing City? !”

A bald old man with black pupils placed his hands on Wu Qing city’s body and shouted angrily.

“Patriarch, we deserve to die! We deserve to die! We didn’t protect the Crown Prince Well!”

In the front, more than ten middle-aged elders kneeled on the ground in fear and kept talking to the old man.

“Qing Cheng was careless this time. In order to obtain the black veil heart fruit, he used the black circle heart to deal with the Darkness Soul. In the end, he didn’t manage to get too many darkness souls and was devoured!”

Beside the bald elder with black eyes, an elder holding a darkness staff sighed.

“Big Brother, Big Brother!”

At this moment, a group of figures quickly walked over. Wu Qingyan and Wu Qingyan, who were in the lead, were filled with anxiety.

When they saw Wu Qingcheng lying there in pain, their expressions changed drastically.

“The Darkness Soul has entered his body!”

Wu Qingyan saw her brother’s condition and was shocked.

“Elder ancestor, grandfather, Big Brother...”

Wu Qingyan ran over and called out worriedly.

“The Darkness Soul has entered his body. Elder ancestor has no choice. Let the light priests take a look first!”

The elder holding the dark staff frowned.

“More than ten souls of Darkness? And all of them are at the sixth level of the profound void tier, this... this...”

Wu Qingyan looked at the souls of darkness in her brother’s body, and her expression changed slightly.

“Elder ancestor, grandfather, I’m afraid this is not something an ordinary light priest can handle!”

She looked at the elder ancestor and grandfather, and said with an extremely embarrassed expression.

As the daughter of light, her strength was not considered weak among the radiant priests.

She was very clear about her brother’s current condition.

It was very difficult to destroy more than ten sixth level insightful void Tier Darkness Souls.

In fact, she felt that even her master might not be able to get rid of them.

“I’ve already sent people to take them over. Let the other radiant priests take a look first. Who knows, there might be a way!”

The old man holding the dark scepter said in a deep voice.

Gathering all the priests of light, they were also desperate.
