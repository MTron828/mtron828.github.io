2642 2642 was vast and invincible

Vast and invincible!

This was the feeling that the imperial court gave Wang Xian!

Such a majestic and vast imperial court was not something that could be accumulated over thousands of years or even tens of millions of years!

The imperial court had been in control of the imperial star field for hundreds of millions of years!

During these hundreds of millions of years, the imperial court had accumulated a terrifying amount of power!

“Let’s go, I’ll bring you to my house!”

As she spoke, she flew towards the direction of the vast palace happily!

Wang Xian and the rest immediately followed closely behind!

At the side, bei Shuang’s eyes flickered as she looked at her surroundings. There was nostalgia and coldness in her eyes!

This time, she was here to let some people know that she, bei Shuang, had returned!

At the same time, she wanted to let some people know that she wanted to get back the humiliation she had suffered in the past!

After flying for about half an hour behind the Empress Star Lady, she stopped at a plain in front of the palace!

This was a very beautiful place, with rivers, lakes, grasslands, and trees!

On the grasslands, one could see desolate beasts flying above from afar!

There were cranes dancing and Pegasus soaring!

Wang Xian’s gaze swept across the desolate beasts and his heart trembled slightly!

Among the desolate beasts on the grassland, 20% of them were immortal king level!

The rest were only at level six or above!

“Is this the foundation of the imperial court? Compared to the Dragon Palace, there’s a huge difference!”

Wang Xian mumbled!

When he was on the Demon Island, Wang Xian thought that the dragon palace was already very strong!

After this upgrade, it was comparable to some big sects!

But now, it seemed that there was still a huge gap between them and such a dominant force!

Even if the imperial court wanted to destroy the Dragon Palace, it would be effortless!

There was also a huge gap between the big sects and the imperial court!

“Ring, Ring, Ring!”

The Imperial Star Lady came to a corner of the grassland and took out a bell to ring it!

The sound of the bell spread far away!

“BURP!”

Soon, the sound of a crane was heard. Three Cranes flew over, and a woman stood on the crane in the middle!

The woman looked similar to celestial maiden, very beautiful!

“Celestial Maiden!”

When the woman saw Celestial Maiden, her eyes were filled with love, and she couldn’t help but call out softly!

“Mom!”

Celestial Maiden said with a smile!

“Hehe, Sister Star Lady hasn’t come back for a few years. This is the longest time she’s been gone!”

“She even brought a handsome man back. Star Lady Isn’t young anymore!”

The laughter of two women came from the crane next to them!

“Greetings, Miss!”

The woman and two women jumped down from the crane, and the two women immediately shouted at the Emperor Star Lady With a Smile!

Clearly, their relationship was very good!

“Celestial daughter!”

The woman opened her arms and hugged the Celestial Emperor’s daughter!

“Hehe, Mom, I’m Back!”

The Celestial Emperor’s daughter hugged her mother with a smile on her face!

“Mmm, my daughter is back. This must be the Dragon King!”

The woman stroked the Celestial Emperor’s daughter’s head and looked at Wang Xian with a smile on her face!

“Auntie, Just Call Me Wang Xian!”

Wang Xian smiled faintly!

“Yes, yes, Mom. Just call him Wang Xian. What Dragon King? HMPH!”

Di Xingnu said immediately!

“Hehe, he is very strong. My Daughter is lucky to have met a noble like you!” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

The woman patted di Xingnu’s head and said with a smile!

...

“What? It’s only true that he’s Lucky!”

Di Xingnu said with some dissatisfaction!

“I’m friends with Xingnu!”

Wang Xian looked at Di Xingnu and smiled!

“Alright, Alright. Mom, let’s go back first!”

As Di Xingnu spoke, she held her mother’s hand and said!

“Alright, Alright. This should be miss bei Shuang. Why Don’t you introduce yourself, Little Girl!”

The lady nodded her head and looked at bei Shuang who was beside her!

“Alright!”

Bei Shuang gave the lady a friendly smile!

“I forgot that the goddess of ice and frost is Wang Xian’s disciple. She is also extremely powerful now!”

...

The Queen of the Imperial Star Smiled embarrassedly!

“Chirp!”

The lady let out a sound!

“BURP!”

“BURP!”

The voices of the cranes were heard one after another. Following that, a few cranes flew over!

The lady sized up the frost goddess, Her Eyes Gleaming!

She had been paying attention to her daughter’s information, so she probably knew more than the Emperor Star Lady!

“Everyone, stand on the crane, go and sit at home!”

The lady said to them and brought the Emperor Star Lady to a crane!

“Sorry for the trouble!”

Wang Xian nodded and flew onto a crane!

The crane beneath him had the strength of an immortal King Level 1 while the lady had the strength of an immortal King Level 3!

And according to the Empress, the lady was one of her father’s over 10,000 women!

She didn’t even have a title!

“Mom, I’ve already reached the pinnacle of the eternal God Lord Level and my Battle Pet Space Beast Chu she has also reached the immortal King Level 5. This time, I’ll definitely be able to become the Empress!”

“After I become the empress, I’ll bring you into the palace in the future, that guy will give you a status too!”

On the crane, the Emperor Star Lady said to the Lady!

“Pinnacle of God Lord?”

The lady was stunned too, her eyes flashing with excitement!

“Hehe, Mom, I didn’t tell you all this time, I wanted to give you a surprise!”

Emperor Star Lady raised her head slightly, her face revealing an excited expression!

“It doesn’t matter if you enter the main hall or not. It’s not bad to be free here. Star Lady, if you are successful, mother will be happy!”

The woman said with a smile!

“That fellow asked you to raise desolate beasts here. How is that not bad?”

Emperor Star Lady said with resentment!

She was indeed very dissatisfied with her father!

A father could not be seen for more than a decade, and her mother was ordered to raise desolate beasts here!

Although this kind of work was very good in many people’s eyes, to his father, it was the work of a servant!

Even other disciples of the same generation said that she was the daughter of a breeder!

Even after she worked hard to become a famous star in the Imperial Star Field, she was still called an actress!

“Alright, Starlet, you are you, your father is your father, you just have to follow your own path!”

The woman said indifferently!

She didn’t have any good feelings towards that philandering man!

But that philandering man was once an emperor, and her family members directly gifted her to that man!

Her status wasn’t high, so it was normal!

“Don’t worry, Mom. This time, we will hold our heads high and let everyone be shocked!”

The Imperial Star Lady raised her head and said confidently!

The woman at the side smiled and nodded her head!

Wang Xian stood on the crane at the side and vaguely heard the words of the Imperial Star Lady and the rest. He had a slight understanding in his heart!

It was not easy to be the daughter of the imperial court!

Especially for such a powerful force like the imperial court, there were hundreds of billions of direct descendants!

To stand out from them, one needed talent and hard work!
