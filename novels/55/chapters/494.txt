Chapter 495: Making A Name in Asia

“Oh no, let’s run!”

Seeing Wang Xian and Adjaya charging in their direction, the charcoal-black old man hurriedly shouted with horror.

“Retreat!” the Deity Lady of Nether Flame commanded loudly, trying to make her escape.

Roar!

“Old hag, you might as well stay here!” Wang Xian barked at the Deity Lady of Nether Flame, tossing balls of immense fire at her.

“Stop her!” Adjaya commanded the Fire Demon.

“Yes, master!”

With a dull roar, the Fire Demon wielded his Flaming Sledge Hammer and smashed at the spot where the Deity Lady was trying to run. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

The Flaming Sledge Hammer struck across the sky, drawing a kilometer of flames.

Wang Xian swept his dragon tail and sped up to a hundred meters away from the Deity Lady. He raked her with his dragon claws.

Nine columns of flames tore the empty space. Every hundred-meter-long column of fire was dashing toward Deity Lady of Nether Flame, while Adjaya, on Wang Xian, followed with an attack.

“Scram!”

The Deity Lady let out a shrill cry as she was aghast upon seeing the trio after her life.

The dense black runes on her body rose again as they condensed into a Nether Flame.

The Nether Flame transformed into a black silhouette while she stood in the middle of it.

The black skull ballooned rapidly to a two-meter size, suspending above the silhouette.

“Trying to kill me? Fat chance!”

The Deity Lady of Nether Flame stood in the center of the silhouette, speaking in a clanging voice that sounded like crashing metal.

However, the voice was not coming from her mouth, but rather from the skull.

“God of Nether Flame in possession. All of you must die!”

The God of Nether Flame was a frightful silhouette ten meters in size. It was connected by black Nether Flame runes while a hideous skull was giving off endless Nether Flame.

The lady stood in the air and struck awe into those who were watching this from afar.

The Deity Lady of Nether Flame swung her arm, hurling the daunting Nether Flame and power at Wang Xian and Adjaya.

“Such a queer and compelling offense. Unlike me...I can only spew fire, rake with my dragon claws and sweep with my dragon tail!”

Seeing the attack made by the Deity Lady, Wang Xian was a little envious. He made up his mind to learn all these battle techniques in the future.

“However, given the Fire Demon and my strength, it’s sufficient to keep you back!”

Wang Xian’s eyes were full of murderous intent.

Wang Xian would not let her off simply because that old hag had wanted to kill them and feed her skull not long ago.

The ten-meter God of Nether Flame might have looked huge, but it was not so for Wang Xian.

He swung his dragon claws to exchange blows with the God of Nether Flame’s arm.

Ka Ka Ka!

The loud raking sound was heard as soon as the dragon claws dropped on his arm. The arm that was condensed by the runes of the Nether Flame let out an explosive sound.

Boom!

At this time, the Fire Demon came crashing down on her from the side with a similar body size.

Wielding his hammer down, the black Nether Flame runes burst straightaway.

Argh!

Fear flickered in the eyes of Deity Lady of Nether Flame. With a scream, she cried, “Help me!”

The two old men who were hesitating at the side were appalled!

“You two can jolly well stay here since you dared to come over!”

Wang Xian swept his cold gaze at them.

The two old men had mixed expressions. They were certain that the Fire Demon, Divine Dragon, and the Fire Goddess who had inherited the legacy of Fire God could undoubtedly make them stay if they wanted.

They were not as strong as Deity Lady, and they could barely cope with themselves.

“Deity Lady, see you at the Hall of Nether Flame!”

Two old men exchanged gazes and beamed into blazing rays that disappeared in the sky!

“You two old bastards!”

The Deity Lady of Nether Flame gritted her teeth and bawled with a hideous look upon seeing their departure.

“Old hag, go to hell!”

Wang Xian sprung into murderous action, attacking the Deity Lady with his dragon claws and dragon tail.

Fire Demon did the same thing at the same time.

The three ten-meter freakish masses were battling in the sky.

Every blow was deafening to the ears, while every strike sparked fire.

The group of Martial Artists at the beach were dumbfounded by the battle high up in the sky.

The unparalleled experts with body masses of ten meters were striking with power that was similar to a volcanic eruption.

Every casual swing rumbled the sky with a thousand-meter-long flame.

The ocean below was tumbling violently.

The seething sound of the seawater was incessant.

Every clashing sound of the blows resonated through the sky.

Within a radius of fifty kilometers of the entire Dubai, it could be heard.

Mist was raining from the jets flying in the sky.

This was an effort of Dubai to try to cover up the fight tonight. Otherwise, hundreds of thousands of people would witness this.

Argh!

With a sharp shriek, the God of Nether Flame silhouette was shaking before it slowly broke down.

The skull shrunk once again and lost its former luster.

The Deity Lady of Nether Flame had hair all over her face as she coughed out blood without stopping.

Not until a dragon claw raked over was peace restored in the sky.

Wang Xian circled in the air while the enormous Fire Demon stood by the side, gazing at his master, Adjaya.

All the Fire Demons from the Fire God Palace strode and stood behind Adjaya.

Thousands of Fire Demons were brought down by less than half by the experts from those three denominations.

Noticing her triumph in this war, Adjaya revealed a smile on her face.

She moved and stood in front of those Fire Demons, gazing in the direction of the coast.

“I, Hertha Mohakaben Cesid Al Adjaya, inherited the legacy of the Fire God. I’ll protect Dubai from any invasion!”

Adjaya held her truncheon up. The crown on her head, coupled with her red hair and red dress, brought out the goddess vibe within her.

Hearing her declaration, Wang Xian smiled and came to her side, coiling around her.

Gulp!

Time seemed to freeze on that scene while all the Martial Artists on the beach were stupefied.

“Goddess, the Goddess of Fire. She’s compelling!”

“Beautiful, what a beauty!”

“She is at most twenty years old, and yet, she owns the domineering Fire Demon, Divine Dragon, and the Fire God’s legacy. She’s simply the luckiest woman!”

“She slew the Deity Lady of Nether Flame. From now on, the Fire Goddess has made a name in all of Asia. She will have a chance to advance to the God-like level in the future!”

Numerous Martial Artists watched dumbfoundedly as the Goddess, Martial Artist, and Fire Demon returned to the Fire Spirit Island.

After today, another supreme-class expert had emerged from Asia.

The Goddess of Fire, Hertha Mohakaben Cesid Al Adjaya!

“Get down!” said Wang Xian coldly. As soon as Adjaya returned to the Fire God Palace, she sat on Wang Xian straight away while Wang Xian made a flip.

“Heh heh!”

Adjaya stroked his dragon whiskers before she made a leap.

Wang Xian jerked as he reverted to his human form. The flames on him condensed into fiery-red clothes.

“Look, don’t you think the fiery-red clothes on you match mine? Even though you’re shorter than me, it’s okay. I still like you a lot!”

Adjaya stood before Wang Xian, looking at him with a broad smile.
