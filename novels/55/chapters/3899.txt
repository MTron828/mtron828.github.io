Chapter 3900: 3899 completely refined the starfield fragment

Translator: 549690339

Wang Xian and Lan Qingyue left.

They didn’t go to the starry city. Instead, they came to the land of thunder.

The land of thunder could be considered one of the most treasured lands of the Dragon Palace!

The value of such a treasured land was extremely high.

Even if it was a peak race, they would fight for it.

“Hehe, the resources in the Dragon Palace now are enough for the Dragon Palace to consume for a billion years! ”

Wang Xian counted the harvest in his hands and smiled.

It was equivalent to the harvest of the four armies of faith. This was more than 200,000 and close to 300,000 corpses of the Pantheon level.

In addition to the previous harvest, he had obtained close to 300 corpses of the level seven pantheon level.

There were more than four million corpses that were comparable to the level eight, level nine, and peak of the venerable realm!

These resources were enough for the Dragon Palace to consume for a billion years!

It was enough for the Dragon Palace to achieve a terrifying increase in strength. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

It was enough for the Dragon Palace to catch up with the other peak races in terms of mid-range strength.

Perhaps the only thing the dragon palace lacked was the ability to dominate combat strength above the level seven realm.

This level of combat strength could only be sustained by Wang Xian, Lan

Qingyue, and the rest.

However, their strength was now invincible in the starry universe.

“Xiao Xian, do you want to wait until you have refined the starfield fragment before going back?”

Lan Qingyue asked Wang Xian.

“Yes, I have an idea. First, I want to completely refine the starfield fragment. Then, I want to go there once. The crystal beast that we encountered is very strong, comparable to us at the peak of dominance. However, as long as I have refined the starfield fragment, together with you and Xiao Lan, it will be enough to destroy it. In that case, the energy that Xiao House and Xiao Bai have increased might be enough!”

Wang Xian said.

“As for the matter with the Phoenix clan, get rid of the crystal behemoth and return immediately! ”

He said!

Right now, the Phoenix Clan had four space behemoths at level seven.

As for whether these four space behemoths at level seven were actually subordinates of the chaotic space behemoth, they couldn’t be 100% sure.

It was also not 100% certain that the beast king token would be of any use to them.

After Wang Xian was done with everything, he would make his move like a thunderbolt.

First, he would refine the starfield fragment!

After refining it, he would kill the Crystal Energy and the Crystal Beast in the ocean. In that case, little white and little house would be able to increase their strength!

After resolving all of this, Wang Xian and the others would be able to easily kill the four space beasts who were at level seven!

sure!

Lan qingyue nodded her head.

“I’ll refine it first! ”

As Wang Xian spoke, he immediately took out the galactic fragment!

Wang Xian had only refined a little of the entire galactic fragment.

The heaven creation level galactic fragment was very strong, even if it was only one-fifth of it.

However, he could still use it to unleash a terrifying destructive power.

Currently, Wang Xian could use the galactic fragment to unleash rapid shooting stars, Galactic Space Lock, eight-star alignment, Flaming Shooting Stars, heavy sky, and galactic desolation.

These names were given by Wang Xian himself. Some of the offensive moves were used by the gods of the universe to deal with him!

Wang Xian sat cross-legged in the Thunder Domain, quietly nurturing.

To complete this nurturing, it would take at least tens of thousands of years, or even tens of thousands of years. However, he was not in a hurry.

Time passed quickly.

At the same time, all the gods and believers in the palace who were located in the space passage of the universe had all escaped and gathered at the entrance of the passage!

Some experts of the palace glanced at the gods and believers in their palace and looked extremely embarrassed!

This time, the losses of their 24 palaces were too great!

After the belief universe entered the starry universe, the losses of their gods and disciples were too great!

In particular, most of the losses were caused by the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace!

“King of all gods, what should we do now? The Dragon King is too strong. We are no match for him. ”

An elder looked at the king of all gods and said with an embarrassed expression!

“With the suppression of the universe, it will be difficult to kill the Dragon

King. You can decide what to do next and develop slowly. If you can kill the Dragon King, then kill him. If you can’t, we will kill the Dragon Palace first when the calamity begins! ”

The three-faced figure in the center said indifferently!

He disappeared as soon as he spoke!

He wasn’t going to attack the Dragon Palace Dragon King Now.

The calamity hadn’t started yet, so they couldn’t enter the starry universe. Once they entered, there was a high chance that they would die inside.

Therefore, the disciples under him decided what to do next.

Seeing the king of all gods leave, the rest of the gods and believers had ugly expressions on their faces.

The experts of the 24 palaces looked at each other helplessly.

“The starry universe is very big. Although the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace is very strong, it’s impossible for him to keep chasing after the disciples of our belief universe. Let’s send some level seven and level six gods to search for resources in the starry universe first. ”

After a long silence, an elder of a palace said!

“In that case, our 24 palaces will cooperate for the time being. ”

An elder of a palace nodded and said!

Soon, the 24 palaces reached an agreement. They would first send the experts of the gods to enter and slowly develop, searching for treasures and resources.

Although it was very sullen, at least there wasn’t too much danger.

This time, the belief universe was completely subdued by the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace.

Time continued to pass, and thousands of years and tens of thousands of years passed by in a flash.

The belief universe started to play dirty. This was a very beneficial thing for the powerful disciples of the nine-origin universe.

The powerful disciples of the peak races and high-level races once again embarked on the path of searching for opportunities.

However, as time passed, the things that the great disciples from the 9-origin universe had been looking forward to and paying attention to did not happen.

That was because after so long, the Dragon Palace had not sought revenge on the Phoenix clan!

This caused many thoughts and conjectures to appear, and it also caused many great disciples from the 9-origin universe to discuss!

“The reason why the Dragon Palace has not sought revenge on the Phoenix clan right now should be because of those four space beasts at the level of a ruler!

“The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace and the others are definitely at the peak of the sovereign realm, but the ally of the Space Beasts invited by the Phoenix clan is also very terrifying. ”

“The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace and the others aren’t strong enough to fight against the four level seven sovereign realm space beasts. I don’t think it’s shameful. The Dragon King and the others are already very powerful! ”

“The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace is my idol. I support the Dragon Palace and the Dragon King. Now that the Phoenix clan has allies, it’s not too late to take revenge when the Dragon Palace is stronger.. We can’t be Rash!”
