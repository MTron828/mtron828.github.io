Chapter 2869: Under the dominance of 2869

“Hehe, I know the virtue of being invincible in battle techniques very well!”

Wang Xian smiled when he saw that his master had restrained the back of his neck and prevented him from moving.

The god Emperor of Shangshui smiled and picked up the invincible in battle techniques.

More than ten hours ago, when he learned that his mischievous disciple had offended the eight desolation god Emperor, his expression changed drastically. He immediately flew into the windless forest.

However, before he could fly for half an hour, he received news that the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace had killed the eight desolation divine emperor.

When he learned from the various information on the communication network that his mischievous disciple had a very good relationship with the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace, he was stunned.

His mischievous disciple called the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace the Boss?

Their relationship was very good?

This made him extremely surprised.

Now that he saw the special creature beside his mischievous disciple, he was slightly surprised.

With his god Emperor level power, he could naturally sense that this was a pinnacle undying God king treasure.

And it was a treasure that could be controlled, such a treasure was priceless.

At least he didn’t have such a treasure.

The Dragon King was able to give it to his stubborn disciple. One could imagine their relationship.

And since his stubborn disciple had a good relationship with the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace, he could also benefit from it.

After all, it was the third largest force in the resplendent starry sky.

“Master, I’m just joking with you. Please put me down.”

Invincible battle technique was caught by the god Emperor of Shangshui and his face turned red. He said with a red face in embarrassment.

In the front, Ye Lui Ying and the other brothers couldn’t help but laugh when they saw invincible battle technique.

“Yes!”

Shangshui divine emperor nodded and threw it aside.

“Hehe!”

Invincible battle technique stood up with a smile and slightly raised his head. He looked at his master and said, “Master, let me introduce you to the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace, my invincible battle technique’s boss.”

“You should know that boss Wang and I have risked our lives. Back then, the two of us were Peerless Heaven’s favorites who stirred up the storm.”

He spoke with some pride as if he was very awesome.

“Hehe, God Emperor of Shangshui, please take a seat!”

Wang Xian smiled at him and gestured with his hand.

“Good, good!”

Although this stubborn disciple of his seemed to be bragging to him, God Emperor of Shangshui was in a very good mood.

“This must be the protector of the Holy Region, right? I heard that he has one foot in the god Emperor realm. Congratulations!”

The God Emperor of Shangshui sat in front of the chair and looked at Hong Fengyan. When he thought of the information on the communication network, he immediately cupped his hands and congratulated her.

“It’s all thanks to the Dragon King’s help that he was able to take this step.”

Hong Fengyan smiled and cupped her hands in response.

“I really didn’t expect that this mischievous disciple of mine would be able to know the Dragon King. It’s really his fortune.”

The divine emperor of Shangshui continued with a slight sigh.

“Haha, when I first came to the Imperial Star Field, I met him on a continent. It has been quite a few years since i last spoke of him.” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Wang Xian smiled and started chatting with his master, who was invincible in combat.

The divine emperor of Shangshui was obviously more talkative than Hong Fengyan. The group sat there and chatted for more than ten minutes.

“By the way, Dragon King, you have destroyed the divine emperor of wind destruction. This matter has caused a great stir in the eight desolates and six harmonies. I wonder if the Dragon King knows about the statement that the eight desolates made on the communication network?”

Ten minutes later, the divine emperor of Shangshui suddenly spoke. He frowned slightly and his face was full of solemnity.

“Statement? What statement? That divine emperor of wind destruction still wants to kill boss Wang without knowing whether he is dead or alive. What does the eight barrens dare to force now?”

“If he dares to force them, the army of the Dragon Palace will directly crush their heads. The Dragon Palace is much stronger than the eight barrens.”

Invincible, who was sitting at the side, heard this and immediately said angrily.

“Shut up!”

Upon hearing his words, the god Emperor of Shangshui glared at him.

Invincible curled his lips and didn’t dare to speak.

“They said that they want the Dragon Palace to give them an explanation for the eight desolates.”

The god Emperor of Shangshui continued to speak to Wang Xian.

“An explanation?”

Wang Xian’s face revealed a trace of coldness. He smiled coldly and shook his head. “Ignore it!”

Upon hearing Wang Xian’s reply, the divine emperor of Shangshui smiled speechlessly.

“With their control over the eight desolates and six harmonies, they should be able to find us soon. Dragon King, you should pay more attention.”

The Divine Emperor of Shangshui pondered for a moment and reminded him.

“Yes, I will be returning to the imperial star field soon. If the eight desolates really wants to start a war with our Dragon Palace, I will come over after a period of time.”

Wang Xian said faintly.

The reason why Wang Xian was so confident was all because of the resources in his hands.

The rewards from this trip were huge.

Not only would he be able to obtain a substantial improvement, but he would also have nine wind divine dragons.

“I might have to return to the holy region later. After my strength has improved, you can inform me if you need anything, Dragon King.”

“Moreover, our starfield is connected and the distance is not too far. I will go to the Dragon Palace to thank you personally.”

Hong Fengyan looked at Wang Xian and said.

“Sure, we are not far from each other. When you upgrade the celestial emperor, there will be a celebration ceremony. I will make a trip to your holy region.”

“I want to establish a teleportation formation on a planet in your holy region. It will be closer to the barren lands in the future.”

Wang Xian said to her.

“Sure, Dragon King is welcome.”

Hong Fengyan nodded.

Boom! Boom! Boom

Just as they were conversing, powerful auras came from the sky above the planet.

“Dragon King of the Dragon Palace, come out!”

A voice sounded out of thin air.

“Huh?”

“That’s… That’s the divine emperor of Bhang!”

“Hiss, the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace is on our planet!”

“The eight barrens are going to get an explanation from the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace. There might be a fight.”

On the Blue Moon planet, everyone was slightly shocked when they felt the mighty power. They quickly raised their heads to look at the sky.

Under the pavilion, Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly.

The divine emperor of Shangshui immediately frowned.

“Dragon King, there are twelve God emperors and a group of experts from the eight barrens. Old Man Huang didn’t come. Hehe.”

At this moment, the Heaven Array reported to Wang Xian from the side.

“Hehe, twelve God emperors really think highly of us.”

Ba Qi smiled, his eyes flashing with a black glow.

“Wudi, you and your master should leave first. You should bring your disciple back to the Holy Region first.”

Wang Xian stood up slowly and said to God Emperor Shangshui, Hong Fengyan and the rest.

“Then we shall stay here for a while.”

God Emperor Shangshui frowned slightly and said to Wang Xian.

“Okay!”

Wang Xian nodded.

“You guys go back to the Holy Region first. I’ll be back soon.”

Hong Fengyan looked at her disciples and instructed.

“I’ll take a look here.”

She looked at Wang Xian and said.

“Sure.”

Wang Xian pondered for a moment and nodded his head. Then, he looked towards the sky.

“I’d like to see what kind of explanation the eight directions wants me to give them!”

He smiled and flew towards the sky.

Ao Yao from the eight-limbed demonic sky formation immediately followed behind.
