Chapter 1373: 1373 swept across the four kingdoms

“Victory! We’ve won! Haha!”

“The Dragon and Phoenix dynasty is invincible! The Queen is invincible! Lord Wang is invincible!”

“He destroyed 100,000 in one strike! He’s too strong!”

When the Dongyuan Dynasty’s army was destroyed, the cheers of victory resounded throughout the dragon and Phoenix dynasty.

All the citizens cheered excitedly.

The city gates opened and the citizens rushed out one by one. The Army and dynasty that were supporting them looked at their queen and their lord king in awe.

“Clean up all the corpses quickly. Ao qitian, Ao Jian, ao Qixia, and Mu Zesen, the four of you will follow me!”

Wang Xian looked at the densely packed corpses on the ground without the slightest fluctuation.

As for destroying 100,000 in one strike, it wasn’t an extremely difficult task for him.

With the destructive power of the five elements great mill, it was completely easy for him to kill 100,000 in one strike.

As he spoke, he looked at Feng Luan who was at the side.

Feng Luan nodded her head slowly. Her gaze swept across all the soldiers of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire. “All the soldiers of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire, Listen Up!”

“The Star Moon Empire, the Dongyuan Empire, the Wind Howl Empire, and the Southern Cloud Empire have invaded us. Next, we must destroy them all within ten days. We must either submit or Die!”

“Ten days later, our dragon-phoenix Empire will soar into the skies and shock the world!”

“Yes, destroy them and unify the four great empires!”

“Destroy them and unify the four great empires!”

The dragon-phoenix Empire’s soldiers roared out in excitement.

The crowd was excited. Their small dragon-phoenix Empire had defeated the four great empires.

Each of these four kings had more than ten cities, and the Dongyuan dynasty had more than twenty cities. They were the best of the dozen or so nearby countries.

If they took over all four dynasties, their dragon-phoenix Dynasty’s territory would expand by dozens of times.

At that time, the dragon-phoenix dynasty, which had more than sixty cities, would become the strongest existence in the nearby area.

At that time, the Dragon and Phoenix Empire would be considered to have shocked the world!

“All the soldiers, follow me on the Expedition!”

Feng Luan shouted softly and swept her gaze across all the soldiers.

“Line up!”

Mang Hong roared loudly and shouted excitedly.

“Yes!”

The soldiers lined up and stared at Her Majesty and their Lord Wang with burning eyes.

“Flood dragon, come!” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Wang Xian shouted softly. With a wave of his arm, a dragon throne and a Phoenix throne were formed using attributes.

“Roar Roar!”

The nine flood dragons swayed their 30-meter-large bodies and flew to the front.

Buzz

The wind attribute energy on their bodies moved and pulled the dragon throne and Phoenix throne.

Wang Xian gestured to Feng Luan.

“Let’s Go!”

Feng Luan revealed a smile on her face. With a move of her body, she flew to the Phoenix throne and sat on it.

Wang Xian sat on the dragon throne.

The nine flood dragons roared and flew into the distance.

Behind them, the 100,000 troops of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire followed closely behind.

The 100,000 troops of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire were not weak. They were the strongest warriors that Feng Luan had painstakingly nurtured.

Each of them was at least at level five of the extraordinary realm.

There were 14 insightful void martial artists following them. However, with Wang Xian’s nine flood dragons and the leaders of the Dragon Palace, it was not difficult to take down four empires!

“My Queen, the Star Moon Empire’s Eastern Sea city is 20 kilometers ahead!”

After flying for five hours, they were about to arrive at the first city.

“The city lord of Eastern Sea city has already died in battle when he came to invade our empire. Go straight there and kill them if they dare to resist!”

Feng Luan ordered coldly.

“Yes, your Majesty!”

The soldiers immediately replied.

...

“Come, come, come. We congratulate Lord Wei. We congratulate Lord Wei for being as blessed as the East Sea. We also welcome Lord Wei to settle down in East Sea city in the future!”

“Today, our city Lord and Legion Commander will follow Her Majesty to attack the dragon-phoenix dynasty. They are unable to come personally. Our City Lord’s Mansion and the ocean cultivators legion congratulate Lord Wei!”

At this moment, the entire eastern sea city was extremely lively and festive today.

Everyone in the city, including the people from the city Lord’s mansion and the ocean cultivator corps, all came to a manor and gave congratulatory gifts to a middle-aged man.

“Haha, Thank You, Thank you, thank you, everyone from the city Lord’s mansion and the ocean cultivator corps. When the city Lord and general return in triumph, I’ll have a good chat with them!”

The middle-aged man was General Wei, who had betrayed the dragon-phoenix dynasty. At this moment, he proudly bowed to the people below with a smile on his face, enjoying the respect of everyone below.

After he left the dragon-phoenix dynasty, he came directly to East Ocean City.

After the city lord of East Ocean City learned about it, he treated him with hospitality and invited him to stay here.

General Wei hesitated for a moment and agreed.

Looking at all the aristocratic families in the eastern sea city looking at him respectfully, the corners of General Wei’s mouth curled up slightly.

When he joined the dragon and Phoenix dynasty, he valued the resources and status of the Dragon and Phoenix dynasty.

However, he later discovered that his status was not very high in the entire dragon and Phoenix dynasty.

This was because the dragon and Phoenix dynasty only had one imperial city, and he could not act recklessly in the imperial city.

As a general, he could not even make a move when he liked the beauty he liked. This made him feel very uncomfortable.

Looking at the group of Beauties sent over by the group of nobles, he narrowed his eyes slightly.

“HMPH, a general who might have already been destroyed might as well be a noble in eastern sea city!”

He narrowed his eyes slightly and raised the cup in his hand to signal to everyone.

Below, everyone quickly raised their cups respectfully in fear and trepidation.

“Boom!”

“Everyone in Eastern Sea City, listen up. Star-moon dynasty is attacking our Dragon-phoenix dynasty. All warriors, including the king, will be beheaded, submitted, or Die!”

“Roar Roar!”

At this moment, a loud sound was suddenly heard, accompanied by a cold voice and a roar.

The sound covered the entire eastern sea city.

“Oh my God, what’s Going On?”

“What? The defensive formation of our Eastern Sea city was destroyed in one blow. Look at the sky, that army, that creature, it’s so terrifying!”

“Our King was killed? The army that went to attack the dragon-phoenix Dynasty was destroyed? How... How is this possible! ?”

Within Eastern Sea city, everyone raised their heads and looked up into the sky. Their eyes were wide open, filled with shock.

The 100 thousand strong army charged over, but the soldiers on the city walls did not have the slightest reaction.

The 30 meter long creature lightly struck out, and the city protection formation shattered.

As the closest city to the Dragon-phoenix dynasty, they naturally knew that the star-moon dynasty had joined forces with the Wind Howl dynasty and the Southern Cloud dynasty to destroy the dragon-phoenix dynasty today.

In the eyes of the people of East Sea city, this dynasty could be easily destroyed, but they had never expected the enemy to attack.

Their king and army were directly destroyed. How was this possible?

“Kneel down, everyone, kneel down. Otherwise, I’ll kill you!”

A cold voice sounded from the sky, and a terrifying pressure pressed down.

Everyone’s expressions changed drastically.

“What... this... This is impossible!”

At this moment, General Wei, who was in the manor of Eastern Sea City, opened his eyes wide. He stood up and stared at the sky in disbelief!
