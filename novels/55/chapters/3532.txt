3533 3532 searching Dragon Ruler, exterminating Dragon Palace?

“Just one more step, just one more step, and I’ll be able to break through my current shackles.”

Within the central mountain peak of Hundred City Peak, Hundred City Alliance leader looked at his body, his eyes shining with fervor.

He was one more step away from the true universe ruler realm!

Right now, his demon Dragon’s head and body were all covered in black scales.

These were dragon scales, pure-bred demonic dragon scales!

These dragon scales were the treasures he obtained from the Holy Dragon lineage.

At the same time, there was also a large amount of pure-bred demonic dragon bloodline!

This made him twice as strong as when he was fighting against Wang Xian!

Now, he was confident that he could fight against that powerhouse from the Dragon Palace!

“Of course, if I take it out, I can easily kill him!”

Hundred Cities Alliance master slowly took out a talisman. It was a yellow talisman.

The entire yellow talisman emitted a special energy.

The moment the yellow talisman appeared, the surrounding space seemed to be restricted!

There were two big words on the Yellow Talisman. One was heavy! The other was kill!

An innate true treasure. This was an extremely powerful innate true treasure.

However, the sacred dragon lineage lent it to him!

Even this innate true treasure wasn’t from the Sacred Dragon Clan, but from the Angel clan.

Even for a force like the Sacred Dragon Clan, it was rare to have one or two innate true treasures in the entire clan!

How could they still have spare innate true treasures to lend to him! !

This time, if it wasn’t for the power displayed by the Dragon Palace threatening the sacred dragon clan, they wouldn’t have lent the innate true treasure to him.

“Dragon searching ruler!”

The next moment, he moved his hand and another treasure appeared.

It was a dragon searching ruler that was emitting light!

On the dragon searching ruler, there was a divine dragon and a light chain that completely restrained the Divine Dragon!

It was said that this was a treasure created by the Archangels of the Angel race. It was used to search for the Divine Dragon Bloodline!

The range of this dragon-seeking ruler was very terrifying!

“Dragon Palace, your doomsday is coming, and I still lack the opportunity to make a breakthrough. This opportunity might be a pure-blooded godly dragon bloodline!”

Hundred City Alliance leader murmured.

“All great beings with power above that of a universe ruler of hundred cities, come here!”

He shouted softly, and his voice spread throughout the entire hundred city peak!

“The Alliance leader has ordered us to go!”

“Is revenge about to begin?”

The Great Beings of 100 cities flew toward the mountain in the center.

The leader was 35 universe rulers with level-two combat power.

There were more than 300 universe rulers with level-two combat power!

This was all the power of the 100 Cities Alliance, and all the universe rulers with level-two combat power.

This power far surpassed that of other powers.

Even the demon witch clan didn’t have so many great beings with the combat power of a universe ruler.

Even the demon witch clan and the Spirit Demon clan combined didn’t have so many great beings.

This was mainly because the Hundred City Alliance was a group of city alliances.

There were 100 cities, and even the weakest city had a great being with the Combat Power of a universe ruler at level one, let alone a top-tier city!

A total of nearly 400 universe master level great beings flew over and arrived at the central main peak.

They looked at the Alliance leader who was covered in dragon scales and giving off a powerful aura, and their eyes were filled with respect and excitement.

“Alliance leader, are we going to make a move?”

Red eyes stared at the Alliance leader and couldn’t help but ask first.

“Haha, that’s right, Our Hundred City Alliance is going to make a move. Within 10 years, I will destroy Dragon Palace!”

The Hundred Cities Alliance master laughed and roared with confidence!

“Alliance master, we are always ready for a battle. We are always ready to destroy the Dragon Palace!”

A City Lord roared with burning eyes.

Now, the Dragon Palace had forced them into this crowded hundred cities peak and turned them into stray dogs.

Right now, their greatest hope was to destroy the Dragon Palace!

“It will be here soon. Tell all the disciples and legions to get ready. In a month, we will start the operation to destroy the Dragon Palace!”

The Hundred Cities Alliance Master’s face was full of violent killing intent as he roared in a low voice!

“It’s the Alliance Master!”

The Hundred Cities Alliance Master’s experts immediately roared!

“Announce this news to the world. We, the Hundred Cities Alliance, will avenge ourselves!”

The Hundred Cities Alliance master roared in a low voice!

“Alliance master, do you have such confidence?”

Hearing that they would announce this operation to the world, one of the City Masters clenched his fists.

“I can easily kill that expert from the Dragon Palace. I Won’t be able to escape even if I wanted to!”

The Hundred Cities Alliance master said confidently.

“Congratulations to the city lord for greatly increasing his strength. We will definitely destroy the Dragon Palace this time!”

The city Lord immediately bowed excitedly!

“Congratulations to the city lord for greatly increasing his strength. We will definitely destroy the Dragon Palace this time!”

The other experts from the hundred cities immediately roared loudly!

“Go get ready. We will move out in a month!”

100 City Alliance leader waved his hand, his face filled with strong confidence.

With an innate true treasure in his hand, his power had reached the pinnacle of a universe knight. As long as he was not a great being at the universe ruler realm, 100 City Alliance leader was confident in dealing with him! Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“It’s alliance leader!”

Everyone immediately moved out, forming an army and commanding their disciples!

Soon, an excited roar came from 100 city peak!

“We will destroy the Dragon Palace!”

“We will destroy the Dragon Palace!”

The roars shook the heaven and earth!

Soon, not long after, on the universe ai, Hundred City made a statement: one month later, we will destroy the Dragon Palace!

It was just a few words, and there were no other words!

They directly announced this matter, which showed hundred city’s confidence!

“HM? Hundred City actually made a statement to destroy the Dragon Palace? Where did their confidence come from? You should know that not long ago, Hundred City Alliance leader was completely suppressed by the Dragon Palace!”

“Yeah, why did they suddenly make such a statement? This kind of reputation-related statement is definitely not made randomly. Do they have the confidence to destroy the Dragon Palace?”

“What do they have to destroy the Dragon Palace with? How can they be so confident? Don’t tell me that Bai Cheng still has a trump card he hasn’t played yet?”

“Since they made such a statement, they must have the confidence. The foundation of the Alliance of Bai Cheng is still very deep!”

When the news of the Hundred Cities Alliance was released, it immediately caused a huge sensation.

At this moment, even the war between the Holy Dragon and the ancestral dragon was not as exciting as the war between the Hundred Cities Alliance and the Dragon Palace.

The Dragon Palace had attacked time and time again, and the Hundred Cities Alliance had been defeated time and time again!

Was it time for them to counterattack?

What other trump cards did they have?

All the powerhouses from the various factions were astonished!

Boom

At the same time, at the location of the Dragon Palace, a wave of light and darkness energy swept out in the surroundings.

Wang Xian looked at the extremely thick and heavy tai chi dragon plate that looked like an ink painting. His eyes shone brightly.

The Tai Chi Dragon Plate had broken through!

To be able to easily defend against the attacks of a level three overlord of the universe, his strength had become much more abnormal!

This caused him to reveal a trace of a smile.

In a few days, he would exterminate 100 cities!
