3737 3736 made his move to kill

“Huh?”

Wang Xian’s figure disappeared in an instant and immediately caught the attention of the fire phoenix in the middle.

When he saw Wang Xian appearing beside them in an instant, his pupils contracted slightly!

“Damn it, not good, Dodge!”

He shouted in a hurry!

However, he came to his senses. The fire phoenix beside him did not react in time!

Wang Xian stretched out his arm. There was a claw of darkness on his palm as he clawed at the Fire Phoenix beside him!

The Claw of Darkness in his hand was an innate supreme treasure that he obtained from the Invincible Zone!

With the Five Elements Millstone and the Tai Chi Dragon Plate, the innate supreme treasure did not have much effect on Wang Xian.

Wang Xian basically did not use innate supreme treasures!

However, this time, he deliberately changed to an innate supreme treasure!

The Terrifying Claw of Darkness entered the fire Phoenix’s body directly. It followed his blood and went straight to its heart.

Every innate treasure possessed a strange and terrifying ability.

For example, this claw of darkness was called The Claw of the heart of the black magic. Once it entered the body, it would enter the heart directly.

The power of this innate treasure was very strong. Of course, in Wang Xian’s opinion, it was more convenient to use the five elements Millstone!

“Ah!”

The Heart Claw of the black magic entered his body, causing the fire Phoenix to let out an intense scream.

He turned his head and stared at Wang Xian in horror.

However, under the cover of darkness, he could only see a blood-red pupil!

“Damn it!”

At the side, the hearts of the other two fire phoenixes were thumping violently!

They had completely ignored this figure just now because they could not sense the aura of the ruler from his body.

However, this sudden burst of strength had actually killed their companion in an instant.

One had to know that their companion had the strength of a ruler at level one!

“Which peak race are you from? You’re courting death!”

The Fire Phoenix in the middle was slightly stronger. He opened his mouth and a stream of flames shot towards Wang Xian!

“You’re the ones courting death!”

“Phoenix Clan? Hehe, die!”

Wang Xian’s eyes revealed a cold expression that was filled with killing intent.

He had always kept the account of the invincible region in his heart!

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz

As soon as he finished his sentence, four netherspirit avatars appeared around him. They stared at him coldly and charged towards him without any hesitation!

“Netherspirit avatars? Are you from the Netherspirit Race? Damn it!”

When the Fire Phoenix saw this, a cold expression appeared on his face.

Wang Xian flapped his incorporeal holy wings that were shrouded in darkness. Wind and thunder flashed and instantly locked onto the other fire Phoenix!

Three Fire Phoenixes, two level one masters of the universe, and one level two master of the universe!

Four netherspirit avatars were attacking the level two master while he was attacking the level one master!

“Not good, we are no match for him!”

The fire phoenix in the middle sensed the strength of the netherspirit avatars. Its pupils constricted slightly and a look of horror appeared on its face!

“Run!”

The other fire Phoenix was even more terrified!

He couldn’t see Wang Xian at all. He looked around in Panic!

“A Lord Fire Phoenix was actually killed. Hiss!”

“Oh no, we have encountered an expert!”

“It’s an expert from the Netherworld race. We have suffered. Let’s escape quickly!”

When the other demonic beasts saw a fire phoenix being killed in an instant, their faces were filled with horror.

They didn’t hesitate at all and hurriedly fled into the distance!

“PFFT!”

However, at this moment, they heard the sound of penetration!

“Ah Ah, Big Brother, save me!”

A scream came again.

They couldn’t help but turn around and see that their pupils contracted and their hearts tightened!

“The three fire phoenixes are no match for the enemy. Run!”

“The enemy is very terrifying!”

More than ten demonic beasts felt their scalps become troublesome and ran away desperately!

“Lord of the Dark clan, we don’t mean to offend you. We are willing to give this place to you. We are willing to leave this place!”

When the last fire Phoenix saw his companion being killed instantly, he widened his eyes in horror!

The other party had the ability to easily destroy them.

And in this starry universe, they could not return to their divine kingdom in an instant.

“None of you can escape!”

Wang Xian easily killed the second fire Phoenix. His gaze landed on the last fire Phoenix and his eyes were filled with coldness!

With a wave of his arm, a demonic ship flew out from his palm instantly.

The demonic ship expanded by a million times and charged towards the escaping demonic beasts!

“Ahhhh!”

“No, no, no, don’t Kill Us!”

The demonic beasts had no room to resist. With their speed, they were much slower than the demonic ship.

This demonic ship was also an innate treasure!

Even in the nine-origin universe, they had yet to reach the Overlord realm. They were basically cannon fodder!

The demonic ship easily caught up to them and crashed into their bodies. They were instantly killed!

“You… We don’t have a deep grudge against each other. Why do you want to Kill Us All? !”

When the Fire Phoenix, who was at the Overlord realm level two, saw that Wang Xian was not going to let even a dozen demonic beasts off, his expression changed drastically!

“Die!”

Wang Xian ignored him. With a move of his body, he dashed forward with his four Netherspirit avatars!

“Chirp, chirp, Chirp!”

“It’s not that easy to kill me. Nirvana, Burn!” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

The eyes of the Fire Phoenix were filled with fury. He spread his phoenix wings and the raging flames of life began to burn.

The Flames of life burned and the terrifying power of the flames swept across the surrounding starry sky!

Among the dozens of planets in the distance, two of them started to move!

“If you want to kill me, then you must be prepared to die together with me!”

The fire Phoenix’s eyes were burning with flames as it roared in an eerie manner.

His strength had increased by a lot in an instant!

The terrifying thing about the Phoenix tribe was that they were burning their own fire of life.

Under the burning of the fire, their strength would increase tremendously.

When the Phoenix clan fought with their lives on the line, it was extremely terrifying!

“Humph!”

Wang Xian snorted coldly. With a thought, the five elements millstone appeared in the sky instantly. Above the five elements millstone, there was another piece of ice metal!

“Confine!”

Wang Xian shouted softly. Streams of dark force were released towards the Fire Phoenix.

The Four Ghost Clones were also released!

“CHIRP CHIRP CHIRP!”

Facing Wang Xian’s attack, the Fire Phoenix let out an angry roar. Terrifying Flames were burning as it struggled to break free!

“Roar Roar Roar!”

However, at this moment, the five elements were grinding in the air. Five divine dragons stretched out and let out roars. They struck the ice metal heavily!

The entire piece of metal was attacking the Fire Phoenix at a terrifying speed!

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

The Fire Phoenix saw a piece of ice metal flying towards it. It raised its head and spat out the fire of Phoenix’s life.

However, when the terrifying fire landed on it, the ice metal did not change at all. It continued to smash towards the Fire Phoenix at a terrifying speed!

“Bang!”
