Chapter 1015: 1016 precious bloodline

Translator: 5496903

The liquid was emitting a green glow and looked extremely mystical.

The pool wasn’t very big. It was just enough for a person to lie in.

Wang Xian’s eyes were sparkling. This pool was located in the middle of the entire treasure house. It was definitely not simple.

Wang Xian stared at the pool and a message appeared in his mind.

The bloodline of the wind-winged savage fish: half-step void interpretation

“Bloodline? It’s actually a bloodline?”

Wang Xian’s face was filled with astonishment. Following that, an excited expression appeared on his face.

“Bloodline, a half-step void interpretation bloodline. This... is worth something!”

That’s right, this bloodline was worth something!

The bloodline of the wind-winged savage fish was of no use to Wang Xian. It was no different from a puddle of water.

However, to humans, this bloodline was a huge treasure trove.

Bloodlines were something that demon beasts and vicious beasts were born with. It was a gift from heaven.

As long as the demon beasts and Vicious Beasts with bloodlines didn’t die, they would be able to cultivate to the peak of their bloodlines as long as they had enough energy.

For example, if they had enough energy and treasures, they would be able to reach the half-step void interpretation realm.

Ten years ago, the wind-winged Savage Fish Demon Beast clan had been killed by the experts of East Sea city until only a few rank six transcendents were left.

Now, only four years had passed, and under the enormous resources, a strong race had been born.

The leader of the wind-winged Savage Fish had reached rank eight transcendence.

As for humans, they envied the bloodline of the wind-winged savage fish, so they invented a technique.

The bloodline extraction technique changed one’s bloodline to the bloodlines of demon beasts and Vicious Beasts.

After possessing the bloodlines of vicious beasts and demon beasts, humans could easily cultivate to the peak of bloodlines like these demon beasts.

They didn’t need to comprehend divine abilities or break through shackles. As long as they had resources, they could break through to the peak of bloodlines.

Although it was more difficult and required more resources than demon beasts, it was definitely a huge shortcut.

The DRAKONID Empire was able to establish an empire because they had the dragon bloodline.

Bloodlines would definitely cause people to go crazy on the transcendental continent, especially the bloodlines of the wind wing savage fish.

It wasn’t easy to extract a demon Beast’s bloodline just by killing it.

The extraction of bloodlines required the consent of the fierce beasts and Demon Beasts, and the demon beasts had to reach the peak of their bloodlines.

There was another harsh condition. The will of the demonic beast had to be stored in the bloodline.

The so-called will was the inheritance for the entire bloodline race.

Only a demonic beast at its peak was willing to give up all its blood and will. Only then could the bloodline be considered complete.

All sorts of conditions made bloodlines extremely rare.

In East Sea City, four or five families had bloodlines. The Yun family had the highest level of bloodlines, and they could cultivate to transcendent level 9.

The Yun family was ranked fifth in East Sea city.

Even Zhang Fengying’s bloodline was only at transcendent level 8. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Even so, the Zhang family was a huge existence in east sea city.

A half-step void interpretation bloodline would definitely shake the entire city!

I’m really rich. Just by relying on this bloodline, I can get a few billion middle-grade spirit stones

Wang Xian’s eyes were burning with passion. He took out an interspatial ring and placed the entire pond into it.

He wore this interspatial ring on his hand to prevent it from being lost.

Perhaps this bloodline had consumed all of Wang Xian’s luck. On the other side of the Treasury, all of it was the food of the winged howler fish.

However, Wang Xian did not care. This bloodline alone was enough for this trip.

Wang Xian, Ao Yao, and the rest took a look at their surroundings. After making sure that they did not miss any treasures, they walked out from the nest of the wind-winged savage fish.

“Destroy it!”

Wang Xian thought for a moment. With a shake of his arm, he landed on the ground.

The Wrath of the Earth!

Boom! Boom! Boom

The surroundings began to shake, and the top of the nest of the winged savage fish began to crack.

Boom

The entire nest collapsed.

Wang Xian smiled and headed outside to meet Ao Jian and the rest.

“Dragon King, are we going back?”

Having obtained the largest treasure in the entire nest, ao Jian asked Wang Xian.

“There’s no need to rush back!”

Wang Xian shook his head. There were at least seven to eight caves in the territory of the winged howler fish. The value of the items in each of the caves was not less than 10 million middle-grade spirit stones.

If he was not in a hurry to return now, he could definitely search here.

“Alright, Dragon King!”

The members of the Dragon Palace nodded their heads.

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian looked to the right. There were more than 100 winged howler fish heading there. He thought for a moment and headed there.

If the group of wind-winged savage fish were really looking for humans, the people from the amethyst mercenary group and the Void Beast mercenary group would be in trouble. With their strength, they wouldn’t be able to deal with them.

Wang Xian paused and hesitated for a moment. Then, he took out an interspatial ring.

“Ao jian, consume all the wind-chiming liquid in here to increase your strength!”

The fengling liquid was considered as energy. Even if Wang Xian consumed it, he would be able to obtain dragon qi. Ao Jian and the rest could definitely increase their strength after consuming it.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Ao Jian and the rest nodded and immediately consumed the fengling liquid.

Wang Xian was not in a hurry. He looked at the eleven Golden Swordfish sitting cross-legged!

Three hours later, a powerful aura erupted from Ao Jian and the rest, causing a smile to appear on his face.

“I had to consume almost all of the wind chime liquid worth 700 to 800 million before I could make a breakthrough. It will be too difficult for me to level up in the future!”

Wang Xian smiled when he saw the eleven golden swordfish had leveled up to extraordinary level 7.

“Let’s Go!”

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Wang Xian walked forward while scanning his surroundings with the Dragon Eyes of light and dark fire.

After walking for five to six hours, he found nothing other than an empty cave.

The territory of the wind-winged savage fish was too big. It would take at least a week to walk through it completely.

“Quick, everyone, run! As long as we avoid the pursuit of the wind-winged savage fish, we can only escape by breaking through the soil on Top!”

Just as Wang Xian walked out of the cave, he suddenly heard an anxious voice coming from the front.

“Eh?”

However, a group of people appeared in his line of sight.

What entered his eyes were the amethyst mercenary group, the Void Beast mercenary group, and a group of students from the other mercenary groups in the Demon Hunter College.

They ran over with faces full of fear. Among them, there were quite a number of people who were covered in injuries. Their faces were full of fear.

“Leader Wang, run quickly. We have a group of wind-winged savage fish chasing us. They are a group of wind-winged savage fish. Their strength is very terrifying!”

The group of people who were running towards them also saw Wang Xian. They were slightly stunned. A female student from the amethyst mercenary group hurriedly shouted anxiously.

“Are they chasing after you?”

Wang Xian looked at them. It seemed that the group of wind-wing savage fish was chasing after them.

However, what surprised him was that they actually managed to escape from their pursuit.
