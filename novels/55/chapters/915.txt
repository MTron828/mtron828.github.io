On Earth, an extraordinaire could cover an area of more than ten kilometers with a wave of his hand.

However, on the extraordinaire continent, due to the rich spiritual energy, the quality of the spiritual energy in the world was higher than on Earth.

The attack of an extraordinaire could only cover an area of one to two thousand meters at most.

The descent of the wood world was the result of Wang Xian advancing to the extraordinaire and obtaining a wood attribute supernatural ability. As his level increased, it would increase.

The power of the descent of the wood world was comparable to a level five divine ability.

However, with the addition of the spirit enchantment, the attack was even more terrifying and more agile.

“Descent of the wood world!”

“Spirit Enchantment!”

When Wang Xian’s voice rang out in the sky, dense trees instantly appeared beneath him.

The trees were five to six meters thick, four to five hundred meters tall, and had an area of more than a thousand meters.

Within this range, Wang Xian could control the wood world to descend and attack.

However, after the enchantment, all the trees seemed to come alive.

Boom! Boom! Boom

The trees seemed to have woken up and were emitting green rays of light.

“Kill!”

Wang Xian stood at the highest point of a tree. His body was emitting a dense azure dragon aura.

The azure dragon aura seeped into the tree, causing it to become even stronger.

A divine ability with a coverage of more than a thousand meters was not considered small in this battlefield with a radius of ten kilometers. However, such an area of attack had appeared five to six times since the start of the battle!

Some of the area-of-effect attacks had a wide coverage, but they did not last for long.

It was like burning the river and boiling the sea. It only lasted for about ten seconds.

The descent of the wood world was different. Only when all the trees were destroyed could the descent of the wood world disappear.

The attack power of the descent of the wood world was slightly weaker than that of burning the river and boiling the sea.

However, it was completely different after the enchantment. Even if Wang Xian did not turn into a divine dragon, his attack power was still not weak.

Hundreds of huge trees were like awakened tree demons. They attacked the Goldblade fish in front of them directly.

“Holy Sh * t, what divine ability is this?”

The tree demons that suddenly appeared, and there were hundreds of them, waved their thorns and attacked the golden knife fish.

This scene made many people look shocked.

They summoned trees, but the trees attacked like living creatures. Such a divine ability was unbelievable.

“What a powerful divine ability!”

Some of the mercenary group leaders looked over and revealed a look of astonishment.

“What him... he...”

The long-haired young man and the rest were stunned. Even Jin Liuyan, who was standing at the side, looked at the young man standing on the Tree Demon in astonishment.

Due to the conflict with Wang Xian, they had been paying attention to his battle.

In the beginning, he used the fire attribute, but now, he actually used the wood attribute!

“Dual attributes?”

The long-haired youth widened his eyes in disbelief.

Dual attributes meant that his attack power far exceeded that of a single attribute.

However, the cultivation speed of dual attributes was twice that of a single attribute.

“He actually has dual attributes, and he should be at transcendent rank 4 or rank 5. How terrifying!”

Jin Liuyan’s face was filled with shock.

Not many people in eastern sea city could match such talent.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

Just as everyone was in shock, the spirit-imbued trees in the tree world transformed into tree demons.

One after another, the trees moved their huge bodies and attacked the Goldblade fish.

The densely packed trees smashed onto the goldblade fish and sent them flying.

Terrifying.

There were hundreds of tree demons that were hundreds of meters tall, and each one of them had the strength of a rank 3 transcendent.

With their huge bodies, their attacks were simply abnormal.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

In just a few minutes, the group of tree demons had killed 3,000 to 4,000 golden bladefish.

However, after killing so many golden bladefish, the dozens of tree demons looked like they were in tatters.

“Crack! Crack! Crack!”

At this moment, an ear-piercing sound came from the sky. Thousands of demon-winged beasts suddenly swooped down and attacked the tree demons.

These demon-winged beasts were stronger than the golden mackerel. Thousands of demon-winged beasts emitted a terrifying demonic aura and could easily destroy all the tree demons.

Wang Xian stood at the top of a tree demon. He frowned slightly and thought of something.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

When the group of demon-winged beasts attacked, all the trees started to move.

They were not attacking the demonic winged beasts. Instead, all the tree magic thorns intertwined together to form a huge net.

“Whoosh!”

When the net that covered a radius of more than two thousand meters intertwined together, it directly covered all the demonic winged beasts.

“Ka Ka Ka!”

When the demonic winged beasts saw the net that covered them, their eyes revealed a cold expression.

They flapped their wings and instantly, demonic feathers flew towards the net of thorns.

However, the moment the demonic winged beasts attacked, all the trees condensed into thorns and filled up the spot where the net was broken.

The tree demon turned into thorns and interweaved into a gigantic net that was suspended in the air.

In the net, over a thousand demonic winged beasts were covered.

“This is the moment!”

A blazing fire flashed across Wang Xian’s eyes. He moved his body and dashed toward the net formed by the tree demons.

Boom

In an instant, terrifying flames shot out from Wang Xian’s eyes and body.

The Flames ignited all the tree demons in an instant.

Wood-based fire!

Wood-based fire!

Boom! Boom! Boom

In an instant, a flaming battlefield with a radius of more than 1,000 meters suddenly appeared on the battlefield with a radius of 10 kilometers.

“Gulp!”

“Dual-attribute, wood makes fire. Using these trees as fuel, the fire attribute explodes with even more terrifying power. My God, this move is too terrifying!”

“Who is that young man? How can he be so strong? This move is simply amazing!”

“Too strong, too strong!”

“What kind of monster young man has appeared in Our Holy Sea Town?”

Around them, the members of the mercenary group looked over with a look of horror on their faces.

Among the demonic winged beasts that were surrounded by trees, there were quite a number of transcendents at level four and level five!

Crack! Crack! Crack

At this moment, screams of agony were heard coming from the huge flames.

Whoosh

A few demonic winged beasts at level five transcendence flew out from the flames.

“Kill!” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

At this moment, Wang Xian took action and chased after the three transcendent level five demonic winged beasts.

The three demonic winged beasts were already severely injured.

“Kill!”

Ao jian 11 followed closely behind Wang Xian. Their bodies transformed into longswords and charged towards the three transcendent level three demonic winged beasts in the sky!

“PFFT! PFFT! PFFT!”

The three extraordinary level five demonic winged beasts that had just escaped were killed by them!

“Hiss!”

“They’re too strong. What kind of mercenary group is this? It’s simply heaven-defying!”

“The most terrifying one is the young man with Wood and fire attributes. He’s Too Amazing!”

Some of the surrounding members of the mercenary group saw this scene and widened their eyes. They were filled with shock.

The long-haired young man and the few members beside him looked extremely embarrassed. There was even some fear in their hearts.

“I saw their badges just now. Their mercenary group seems to be called the Immortal Phoenix Mercenary Group!”

Immortal Phoenix mercenary group!
