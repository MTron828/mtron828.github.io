Chapter 758: 0759 as the enemy (1/5)

Translator: 549690339

Dual attributes were very rare among martial artists. Usually, no one would practice dual attributes.

Two different attributes in the body would bring great trouble to a martial artist.

However, according to the five elements eight trigrams, through the symbiosis, a martial artist could practice dual attributes or even more attributes.

The practice of dual attributes required a combination, such as wood creating fire, fire creating Earth, earth creating metal, metal creating water, and water creating wood.

However, there was one point. The cultivation speed of dual attributes was twice or even more difficult than that of a single attribute.

In jianghu, there were basically no people who cultivated dual attributes. Even if there were, it was because of special reasons.

Just like the water and fire attributes of Ah Jiaya, water and fire were incompatible. She couldn’t cultivate and had to suppress one of them. After Wang Xian became an immortal, he would help her completely eliminate the water attribute.

There were many ways to cultivate multiple attributes, but no one would choose to cultivate.

Not to mention that an immortal God had dual attributes. This meant that he had to pay at least double the time of others to reach the level of an immortal God.

However, a dual-attribute martial artist was much stronger in battle than a single-attribute martial artist.

The green-robed old man and the other three looked at the water-blue flames dancing in Wang Xian’s hands. The flames were emitting a terrifying temperature and their expressions turned slightly ugly.

The water-refining technique was similar to the fire-refining technique. They could also refine weapons and pills.

Looking at Wang Xian who was full of confidence, the four celestials from the Holy Doctor Sect and the Holy Medicine sect had ugly expressions.

The white-bearded Old Man and the few celestials from the innate celestial sect were also looking at Wang Xian in shock.

Chang Shu, who could cure them with a wave of his hand, had dual attributes and also knew the powerful water-refining technique.

As for the split of the pills he mentioned, everyone would believe him when they saw his confident expression.

There was no need for him to lie. If he couldn’t do it, he would offend the natural born celestial sect.

“It seems like you are going to make an enemy out of the Holy Medicine Celestial sect and the Holy Doctor Celestial Sect!”

The green-robed elder stared at Wang Xian coldly. He was no longer as calm as before.

“Since you have already said that today is just the beginning, let’s... Let’s begin!”

Wang Xian picked up the Teacup on the table and stared at the four of them with a smile.

The atmosphere instantly froze.

The green-robed old man and the other two looked extremely gloomy.

The matter of the tree demon was ruined by Wang Xian. Now, even the cooperation with the natural born celestial sect was ruined.

Every matter was very important to the two celestial sects.

The tree demon could increase the combat strength of their celestial sect by one middle-level immortal.

And the cooperation of medicinal pills could allow their celestial sect to monopolize the market of medicinal pills.

“Since that’s the case, I hope that you can withstand the strength of our two celestial sects in the future!”

The green-robed Elder’s eyes revealed a strong killing intent as he said coldly.

“Haha, Alright!”

Wang Xian looked at them nonchalantly. “I’ll accompany you to the end anytime!”

“HMPH!”

The four people from the Holy Medicine Immortal Sect and the Holy Medicine Immortal sect stood up coldly. “Elder Mu, we’ll take our leave!”

“Hehe, elder Hua, we’ll meet again in the future!”

Elder hua smiled as he cupped his hands towards them. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Let’s Go!”

The four of them had grim expressions as they spoke to the dozen of disciples at the side. Then, they left immediately.

Looking at their figures, a hint of coldness flashed across Wang Xian’s eyes.

Today, he could be considered to have formed a complete enmity with the Holy Medicine Immortal sect and the Holy Medicine Immortal sect!

“If you want to blame someone, blame yourself. You stopped me from obtaining the wood spirit fruit and even provoked me!”

Wang Xian felt a chill in his heart.

Wang Xian was not the least bit worried about forming an enmity with the Holy Medicine Immortal sect and the Holy Medicine Immortal sect.

His dragon sect had a total of more than 80 disciples. All of them were in the infant stage. As for the Holy Medicine Immortal Sect and the Holy Medicine Immortal sect, they had countless disciples under them.

If they were to really fight, even if the other party had two immortal sects, they would suffer heavy losses.

At most, Wang Xian could just transfer some more subordinates from the Dragon Palace.

However, the best way was to increase his own strength a little.

After a year of closed-door cultivation, his dragon Qi had reached more than 600 million. If his dragon Qi increased by another 100 to 200 million, his strength would be comparable to a superior immortal.

If he could complete the first change of the Divine Dragon, then his strength would truly be invincible on earth!

“Dragon King, the Holy Doctor Immortal Sect and Holy Medicine Immortal sect are very strong. You must be careful in the future!”

The white-bearded elder looked at Wang Xian and reminded him kindly.

“Since you dare to offend them, you shouldn’t be afraid of them!”

Wang Xian revealed a hint of confidence on his face.

This confidence made the Celestials from the natural born immortal sect look surprised.

The Holy Medicine Immortal sect and the Holy Doctor Immortal sect were united in strength. With the combined strength of the two immortal sects, they could be ranked in the top three.

“It’s good that you are mentally prepared, Dragon King. Regarding the matter of taking Chang Shu and the collaboration of the elixirs, are you prepared, Dragon King?”

The white-bearded elder looked at him expectantly.

“Take Chang Shu. I will be able to restore his vitality today. As for the pills, we can talk about it tomorrow. At that time, all of you can take a look at my alchemy skills. I should be staying at the soup cauldron for the next few days!”

Wang Xian spoke to them indifferently.

There were a total of five immortals in the natural born celestial sect. The white-bearded old man was a middle-level immortal with the strongest strength. His surname was mu!

They were very curious about Wang Xian’s ability to regain his vitality after subduing Chang Shu. Therefore, Wang Xian gave them an excuse.

When the few of them saw that he was unwilling to speak further, they were too embarrassed to get to the bottom of it.

At the side, Fairy Centaurea looked at Wang Xian, who was chatting happily with the celestial sect. She had a complicated expression on her face.

She never expected that this young man would have such powerful strength.

She looked at the crystal box on Wang Xian’s back and her eyes were filled with envy once again.

“Dragon King, you can stay here for the next few days. If you need anything, you can come and look for me. Or you can tell hundred flowers that we will stay at the next location!”

After chatting with elder Mu and the rest for more than an hour, flower queen brought Wang Xian to a courtyard at the side and said to Wang Xian.

“Thank you!”

Wang Xian nodded his head and walked into the room.

The house was built entirely out of wood and was filled with a natural smell.

The smell was very pleasant and it made one’s mind clear. All the items were made of wood.

Wang Xian looked at the wood spirit fruit in his hand and immediately walked into the room.

“Wow!”

Opening the Ice Soul Stone, Wang Xian looked at the comfort inside and said, “I hope it’s useful!”

The wood spirit fruit was a type of green fruit. It had a human shape and emitted a unique smell.

There were a total of six wood spirit fruits in the natural born celestial sect. All of them were given to him.

Wang Xian placed the fruit into Shu Qing’s mouth slowly. With a move of his palm, the fruit turned into liquid and fell into his mouth.

When the wood spirit fruit entered his stomach, Wang Xian used dragon energy to melt it.

In one go, Wang Xian placed all six wood spirit fruits into Shu Qing’s mouth.

After taking a look at Shu Qing, Wang Xian placed her on the bed.

He took out his phone and contacted Xiao Yu.

Now that Xiao Yu’s injuries had recovered, he was prepared to return to Jiang city in two days.

Meanwhile, Wang Xian also got Mo Qinglong to start planning for the Divine Dragon Refinery.
