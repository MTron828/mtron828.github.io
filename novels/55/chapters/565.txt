Chapter 566: The First Customer (2)

“Saint Forge Workshop couldn’t even fix your weapon. They aren’t living up to their name! This is just a Level 11 weapon!”

At the entrance of the Saint Forge Workshop, two girls walked out from the workshop with disappointed looks. A young girl with two ponytails pouted and grumbled unhappily.

“Bo Yu is too unique and they aren’t confident. The main reason is still because we have too few materials!”

The other girl beside the girl with the ponytails frowned and was clearly a little unhappy.

“Sister Xue, why don’t I get you a piece of Level 1 spiritual equipment as a gift?”

Seeing Sister Xue frowning, the girl with the ponytails held her arm and spoke with a smile.

“Bo Yu is the most suitable weapon for me. Moreover, this was given to me from my grandma and I have been carrying it for over twenty years.”

The other girl shook her head.

“It’s all because of that brat from Yong Chang Immortal Sect. Tsk! Sister, you should have trimmed away all his hair!”

The girl with the ponytails waved her fists angrily.

The other girl remained silent and didn’t say a word. Her eyes looked in the direction of another forge workshop.

“What a joke! A small shop like this and yet they dare to claim they have an alchemist master and a blacksmith master. They are really taking customers as fools!”

“Exactly. Look at this shop! There’s nothing in there. No weapons or elixir pills! It must be a scam!”

At this moment, the girls heard the voices of two middle-aged men.

That girl’s eyes followed the source of the voice and looked across.

Huh?

“Eh, it’s just as they have said. What an interesting shop! alchemist master and alchemist master refining personally for you? Customers to prepare all materials? They sure are arrogant. However, this shop is pathetically small. Isn’t this too obvious of a scam?”

The young girl with the ponytails was also attracted by the conversation of the two middle-aged men. She looked towards the shop and blinked her eyes speechlessly.

“Why would an alchemist master or a blacksmith master remain in a small shop like this! Tsk! The owner is really brainless!” the young girl with the ponytails continued and found this to be hilarious.

The other girl looked inside the shop and was clearly hesitating.

“Sister Xue, let’s go to Bai Ling Forge Workshop. They also have a famous blacksmith master.”

The young girl looked away from that shop, pointed to another weapon shop a short distance away and spoke.

Huh?

However, when she saw the other girl, she realized that the other girl was staring at the shop beside her and was in deep thought.

“Sister Xue, you can’t be thinking that this small little shop really has a blacksmith master!” the young girl with ponytails exclaimed.

“I know the blacksmith master from Bai Ling Forge Workshop. He’s a lot weaker than Master Xuanhuo!”

The other girl frowned and walked directly into the shop.

“Aiya! Sister Xue, you... How can you even believe the notice outside this shop!” the young girl with ponytails shouted but still followed behind.

“I’m just thinking of giving it a try. It wouldn’t take up much time either!”

The other girl insisted and walked ahead. She was just hoping for a miracle.

“This... Alright. If there isn’t any blacksmith master in this shop, I’ll report this shop and seal it up!” the young girl with the ponytails exclaimed as she pouted and walked into the shop.

“Huh? Customer?”

Wang Xian was seated in the shop while manipulating small water clones in his hands when he saw the two girls walking in. He lifted his head and stood up.

“Does this shop have a blacksmith master?”

When the girls stepped into the shop, they looked around before their attention fell on Wang Xian.

“Yeah!”

Wang Xian looked at the girls and eventually at the short sword in the girl’s hand. He was able to tell that the short sword wasn’t ordinary from a single glance at the scabbard.

“Where’s the blacksmith master?” the young girl by the side asked Wang Xian immediately.

“What kind of weapons are you two interested in forging? Do you two have the materials? As long as you have sufficient materials, I’m a hundred percent certain of successfully forging Level 12 spiritual equipment and below!”

Wang Xian looked at the young girl with ponytails as he replied.

“Tsk! What a reassuring tone!” the young girl pouted. “Where’s the blacksmith master? No matter how I look at it, your shop just seems like a scam to me!”

Swish!

The other girl pulled out the short sword from the scabbard.

The short sword was as light as a feather and as white as snow.

The entire blade was as thick as a piece of paper and seemingly transparent.

However, the tip of the blade was chipped off.

“Level 11 spiritual weapon. The name of the sword is Bo Yu. Can you restore it?” the other girl asked directly.

“Restore?” Wang Xian raised an eyebrow and took Bo Yu from the other girl.

“Where are the materials?” Wang Xian asked directly.

“Bing Yi Metal!”‘ The other girl took out a piece of metal that was a little transparent.

Bing Yi Metal: Level 12

“What a waste of precious materials!” Wang Xian mumbled softly when he saw the piece of metal in the girl’s hand.

“Huh? What do you mean by wasting precious materials?”

When the young girl with ponytails heard Wang Xian, she questioned him right away.

She had seen Wang Xian as a scammer all along.

“Using Level 12 materials to forge a Level 11 Weapon. That’s obviously a waste of precious materials!”

Wang Xian spoke to the young girl with ponytails.

“Can you restore it?” the other girl frowned and asked. The truth was she wasn’t harboring high hopes on it. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“So what if we are using Level 12 materials to forge a Level 11 spiritual weapon?” the young girl with ponytails retorted and was seemingly looking down on Wang Xian for not understanding.

“Yes. As for remuneration...” Wang Xian nodded his head and observed the materials in the girl’s hand. He was estimating the amount that would be left before assessing if he would require further remuneration!”

“Two thousand spiritual stones. As long as you can restore it, I can give you two thousand spiritual stones!”

Before Wang Xian answered, the girl interrupted.

Huh? Wang Xian raised an eyebrow and said, “Alright. The remaining materials will belong to me!”

“Alright!”

The girl didn’t hesitate for a moment as she stared fervently at Wang Xian. “That’s only if you can restore my Bo Yu!”

“Get your spiritual stones ready and give me ten minutes!”

Wang Xian took the Bing Yi Metal from the girl and went to the second floor right away.

“This... This...”

The young girl with ponytails looked at the back view of Wang Xian with doubts and mumbled, “Is the alchemist master on the higher floors?”

“Let’s wait for ten minutes!” the other girl said to the young girl.

“I keep having the feeling that this shop is a little strange and weird!”

The young girl mumbled on. After which, she looked around and continued, “There aren’t even chairs for customers to rest in! What kind of wretched shop is this!?”

The other girl also frowned. However, she wasn’t worried that this shop was up to something.

No one dared to scam her, Piao Lingxue!

“Who would have thought that my first business would be so lucrative? Two thousand spiritual stones and the remaining materials!”

Wang Xian went to the second floor and his eyes were beaming with excitement. It would seem that opening this shop was the right decision after all.

Looking at the Bo Yu sword in his hands, Wang Xian’s lips curved into a smile.

“Art of Water Refining!”

Wang Xian waved his arm and sat on the floor. A pool of water energy surfaced before him as he threw Bo Yu sword on it.

[Ding! Would you like to use the Origin Source Water to refine spiritual equipment?]

At this moment, the notification of the system popped up, making Wang Xian smirk.

“Refine!”

At that moment, scorching heat was emitted from his body. The Origin Source Water was boiling at an incredible temperature.

This was an application of water energy and was known as Boiling Water!

Using the Art of Water Refining to refine equipment was the equivalent of refining with boiling water!
