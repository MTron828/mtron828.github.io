“This is the one!” Wang Xian exclaimed with excitement as he stood by the villa’s window and looked down at the sea. It was a villa which was located deep within the Supreme Seas Development Zone, close to the sea.

This villa was built on a towering rock that emerged from the sea, thus having the seawater right beneath it. It was different from the other villas that were located more than a hundred meters away from the sea.

The entire villa stood at three stories, and the exterior had a swimming pool that linked to the sea and a boat placed beside the villa.

The exciting thing was the slide placed on the roof, allowing people to slide straight into the sea.

This villa seemed much more magnificent than the previous one which he had viewed.

“How much does this villa cost?” Wang Xian asked the saleswoman excitedly.

“Sir, this villa is currently selling at $83 million. If you are able to make the full payment, you may have the property only for $80 million. You may have the villa with all the facilities available inside!” the saleswoman replied politely.

“$80 million...” Wang Xian nodded and said, “I’ll take it, may I sign the contract and stay in today?”

“Yes, of course!”

The saleswoman nodded with enthusiasm and shook, and moved herself right beside Wang Xian.

She looked at Wang Xian with glittering eyes and brushed her breast against Wang Xian’s arm.

“All right, please bring me the contract, and if possible, I shall stay here today.” Wang Xian spoke as he looked coldly at her.

“Oh yes! Yes, sir!” The saleswoman nodded and walked out with some disappointment.

Wang Xian made his way up to the top level of the villa and watched Xiao Yu view the surroundings with excitement.

“Choose a room for yourself!” Wang Xian said to Xiao Yu.

“All right, brother. I’ll choose the room on the second level,” she replied excitedly.

“Okay, I shall have the room on the third level then.”

“That reminds me, brother, my master will be coming over and staying with us later,” Xiao Yu told Wang Xian.

Wang Xian nodded and said, “Sure, we can give Elder Fang the room right beside yours, when is she coming over?”

Wang Xian was not surprised that Xiao Yu’s master was staying with them.

Ever since Xiao Yu had become the Saintess of the Thistles And Thorns Sect after joining the sect, Sect Leader Tang had always wanted to arrange someone skillful enough to protect her.

However, Xiao Yu turned down the offer. Fortunately, Elder Fang would be following her from now on.

Apart from giving martial arts guidance, she would also ensure Xiao Yu’s safety.

“I just sent her the address, she will be here in the afternoon,” said Xiao Yu.

“Okay,” Wang Xian acknowledged.

At this moment, the saleswoman came back with a middle-aged man in a suit.

“Sir, we have brought all our information, and we may proceed with the transaction now.”

“Sure!”

All it took was just the signing of the purchasing contract and the payment.

“Sir, if you have any needs, you may contact us via our hotline, and we will answer your needs as soon as we can!” the middle-aged man said to Wang Xian with much veneration.

“Oh yes, I really do have a need. Does your company provide purchasing services for yachts?”

Wang Xian had always dreamed of possessing a yacht.

A yacht would complete that sea view villa. It would also be a pleasure to take Xiao Yu or Guan Shuqing out to the sea for a ride.

Having a zesty life on the sea could not be more wonderful than swimming under the sea in his dragon form.

“Yachts?” The middle-aged man was stunned for a while and replied, “Well, we have a collaboration with a yacht agent who represents a well-known yacht brand in the world. If you wish to purchase, we have a booklet with the various types of yachts.”

He took out a booklet and handed it to Wang Xian.

The yachts were known as the top luxury brand in Italy.

Wang Xian viewed the price of the yachts, which ranged from $3 million to $80 million, came in different styles and were mesmerizing.

“This yacht costs just as much as this villa.” Xiao Yu was shocked as she came and looked at the different yachts in the booklet.

Wang Xian nodded, he pointed at a particular yacht and said, “How’s this one?”

“It’s beautiful, but it costs $40 million, it’s too expensive,” Xiao Yu replied with her lips pouting as she looked at the yacht that Wang Xian had pointed out to her.

The yacht stood at 26 meters long and was able to make long-distance travels. The interior concept was no different from a house.

It was filled with all kinds of amenities such as a dining area, a bedroom, and a living room. The double-decker yacht was grand and luxurious.

“Let’s decide on this, then: the cheaper ones are too small,” Wang Xian said decisively.

Both the middle-aged man and the saleswoman were astonished.

In just within a day, $120 million had been spent.

“Sir, we will need you to pay the deposit first, and we will deliver the yacht within a week!” said the middle-aged man, in an ardoring manner.

“Sure!” Wang Xian nodded and made the payment for the deposit immediately. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Thank you, and contact us if you have any needs.”

As both the middle-aged man and the saleswoman left, Wang Xian lay on the sofa with a huge smile on his face.

Just the renovation of the entire villa alone cost tens of millions of dollars, with all appliances purchased from top brands in the world.

Xiao Yu also toured herself in their new home happily.

“Brother, my master has arrived, I’m going out to receive her.”

Xiao Yu ran out of the house. By then, half an hour had already passed as Wang Xian was chatting with Guan Shuqing on his mobile phone.

“Brother, come and help me out!”

Wang Xian stood and went outside as he heard Xiao Yu’s voice after a short while.

As he arrived at the courtyard, he saw a Wrangler SUV had been parked. Xiao Yu, with her master and the chauffeur, had their hands full.

What seemed peculiar to Wang Xian, were some grass and stones that were removed from the car.

“What are these?” asked Wang Xian as he looked dumbfounded.

“These are some spiritual stones and spiritual grass that possess spiritual energy,” replied Elder Fang, who looked at Wang Xian in bewilderment.

“Spiritual stones and spiritual grass that possess spiritual energy?”

Wang Xian was stunned for a while and immediately went up to pick up one of those stones.

[Dilapidated spiritual stones]

Instantly, some words flashed across Wang Xian’s head.

“Spiritual stones!” Wang Xian’s eyes started to fill with fire, but he shook his head.

Wang Xian needed a complete spiritual stone; dilapidated spiritual stones were totally useless to him.

He looked at the spiritual grass, but there was no sign given from his system, as the grass may have been too low in terms of level.

“These items are used as a form of support for Xiao Yu’s training,” said Elder Fang as she took out two tufts of spiritual grass from her car carefully.

The tufts of spiritual grass were placed in a wooden bucket of half a meter wide, which was filled with red mud and some spiritual stones.

One of the tufts appeared to be redder in color, and it glowed with red halation.

The other tuft had some green fruits which were about the size of a pinky fingernail, grown on it, and there were five to six of them.
