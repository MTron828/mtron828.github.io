Chapter 2930: conquering the machine imperial region 5

Wang Xian was waiting for the arrival of all the armies in the machine imperial region.

With his current strength, he could totally catch up with the robot army in front and the creator.

However, he didn’t do so.

According to the information he got from the glazed domain, although the creator couldn’t directly escape back to his divine kingdom, he possessed a very heaven-defying ability.

He could transfer his memory to any robot.

In other words, he could abandon his body and transfer it to other robots and robots.

After the transfer, he could still mobilize the entire robot army.

If the Dragon Palace displayed all its strength at this moment and annihilated all the robot armies in front of him, the creator would immediately escape. Wang Xian would definitely not be able to stay.

After escaping, the creator would definitely order the remaining robots to protect him from the pursuit of the Dragon Palace.

If that was the case, it would be considered pretty good if the Dragon Palace could destroy half of the robots in the machine imperial territory.

Therefore, Wang Xian was waiting for all the robots in the machine imperial territory to arrive.

Or perhaps, he was waiting for the moment when the creator and the rest escaped to the center of the machine imperial territory to launch a counterattack.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

In the front, the wind god Dragon let out a raging roar. From time to time, the battleships were destroyed by them. At the back, the devouring dragons immediately flew over and devoured the robotic battleships.

These battleships were made of a special biological metal, the same material used to make robots.

Battleships could also be called robots of a different size.

To the devouring dragon, this was an increase in energy.

In the half an hour of pursuit, the wind god Dragon and the rest had shot down more than 2,000 battleships. It was enough to raise the combat strength of over 1,000 devouring dragons by a level.

The pursuit continued.

Wang Xian wasn’t in a hurry.

The creator wasn’t in a hurry either.

He closed his eyes and searched the star map of the mechanic royal territory in his mind. He was giving out orders one by one.

He wanted to surround all the people of the Dragon Palace and make them suffer heavy losses.

Even if he couldn’t destroy the Dragon Palace, he had to severely injure it.

Time slowly passed, and it had been a day since the Dragon Palace chased after the robot army

The members of the Dragon Palace didn’t look tired at all after a day.

As divine dragons and dragon species, their physiques were enough to sustain their battles for several years.

Moreover, the members of the Dragon Palace didn’t use their strongest techniques.

“Hehe!”

At this moment, the creator opened his eyes and smiled coldly.

He glanced at the two sides, his eyes shining.

“Let the Dragon Palace pay the price here.”

“In order to prevent you from escaping back to the divine kingdom, I’ve prepared a big gift for you!”

The creator slowly stood up as he spoke. His body moved and he flew towards the front of the machine emperor ship.

“Boom Boom Boom!”

At this moment, the planets on the left and right were flying towards them at a terrifying speed. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

The planets on the left were emitting extremely hot flames. The one in the middle was a blazing sun.

And on the right were planets that were emitting extremely cold temperatures.

“Golden Split Scarlet Sun and extreme ice white dwarf stars. These terrifying natural planets in the universe can emit temperatures that can threaten godly king powerhouses.”

The creator stared at the two huge planets, and a smile appeared on his face.

And behind this group of blazing extreme ice planets were the automaton armies of the Machine Imperial region.

On those mechanical planets stood countless robots.

They held all kinds of weapons in their hands and stared coldly at the position in front of them.

“Huh?”

At the same time, Wang Xian had already noticed the appearance of the Golden Split Red Sun and polar ice white dwarf stars on both sides.

He narrowed his eyes slightly and swept his gaze toward the positions on both sides.

“All members of the Dragon Palace, Stop!”

Wang Xian ordered with a twinkle in his eyes.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

The members of the Dragon Palace immediately stopped their attacks and stopped moving. They also swept their gaze toward the two sides.

“Dragon King, the robot army from the machinery empire should have all arrived!”

At this moment, the Heaven Formation flew to Wang Xian’s side. He held a compass in his hand and said with a smile on his face.

On his compass, they were surrounded by numerous red dots.

The number of red dots was uncountable.

“It’s about the same. Since they have already set up an ambush here, they should have deployed at least 90% of their strength.”

“The Golden Red Sun and the polar ice white dwarf stars should be to prevent the members of the Dragon Palace from escaping back to their divine kingdom directly.”

Wang Xian said faintly as a smile appeared on his face.

An expert wanted to return to his own divine kingdom in an instant. At this moment, he could not be attacked.

Once he was attacked, he would be interrupted.

The extreme heat and cold emitted by the Golden Split Red Sun and polar ice white dwarf stars would affect the entire void and cause the aura of this void to be unstable.

Under such circumstances, it would take a longer time to prepare if they wanted to escape back to their God country.

However, this also meant that the mechanical imperial region was preparing to fight with the Dragon Palace!

It was exactly what they wanted!

“Dragon Palace, since you want to kill my mechanical army, then let us decide the victor here!”

“All mechanical army, Attack!”

Seeing the Dragon Palace Army suddenly stop, the creator thought that they were afraid, so he immediately ordered loudly with a grim look on his face.

Boom! Boom! Boom

When he gave the order, the dozens of golden split red sun and extreme ice white dwarf stars suddenly increased their speed and charged toward them.

Boom! Boom

At the same time, the Cyborg Army began their counterattack.

Standing in the position of the Dragon Palace, they could see countless beams, cannons, and missiles flying toward them.

On both sides, the gold-splitting red sun and the polar ice white dwarf star began to crack when they were hundreds of millions of kilometers away from the members of the Dragon Palace.

Boom! Boom! Boom

Countless flaming meteorites and frost meteorites rushed toward the members of the Dragon Palace.

The blazing heat and extreme cold caused cracks to appear in the space where they were.

The entire space was unstable.

The flaming meteorites and frost meteorites didn’t harm the members of the Dragon Palace. They mainly wanted to disturb the starry sky and prevent the members of the Dragon Palace from escaping.

“Hehe, let’s begin. All the god Emperor members, lock onto your targets and don’t let them escape!”

“The Devouring Dragon focuses on battle. After this battle, devour the fruits of battle!”

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered with a strong fighting spirit. He swept his gaze across the surrounding meteorites and gave an order with a faint smile.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

At this moment, the eyes of the 51 celestial thearch from the Dragon Palace flashed with a violent fighting spirit as they replied loudly.
