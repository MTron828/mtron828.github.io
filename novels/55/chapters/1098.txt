Chapter 1099: 1100 to give you a city

Translator: 5496903

It was not as easy as it seemed to be to establish a country and expand its territory.

A powerful country would not be able to prosper unless it had been settled for a long time.

The foundation of a country was very important.

A country could only become more and more powerful if it had an endless stream of talents and experts.

If one wanted to attract experts and talents, one first had to win the hearts of the people.

A country without the hearts of the people wouldn’t be able to go far, especially in a country like the transcendent continent where demonic beasts and fierce beasts roamed freely.

“A few years is too long. A few years is already enough to build a city!”

Feng Luan looked at the information in front of her and muttered.

“Empress, if you want to build a city, the manpower and material resources required are a huge amount of wealth. In addition, when the time comes, you have to attract people to live here!”

As the old woman spoke, she looked at Feng Luan and hesitated for a moment before continuing, “Empress, you are too anxious!”

“Yes, I am too anxious. How can it be so easy to build a dynasty!”

Feng Luan smiled self-deprecatingly. He knew that he was too anxious.

“Hu!”

Lightly exhaling, Feng Luan slowly stood up and looked outside.

Buzz! Buzz

At this moment, she sensed the information on the communication stone plate. With a move of her arm, the communication stone plate on the table flew into her hand.

“When are you coming to star-moon kingdom? When are you going to attack Donghai City?”

When she saw Wang Xian’s message, she shook her head helplessly and replied immediately, “Something has happened. I might have to wait for a few years!”

“Huh?”

At this moment, Wang Xian, who was sitting in the mayor’s residence of Shenghai Town, was slightly stunned when he saw the message sent by Feng Luan.

“Looks like you can’t do it. You can only take down a city after a few years. If you were to establish a kingdom, wouldn’t it take more than ten years? Wouldn’t it take decades to overthrow the Phoenix Dynasty?”

He joked a little.

“That’s right. It might take decades or even hundreds of years!”

Feng Luan replied faintly.

“Why didn’t you take down Donghai City? Why did you change your plan?”

Wang Xian became serious and asked curiously.

“I’m Not Strong Enough!”

Feng Luan didn’t hide anything and replied directly.

Not Strong Enough?

Wang Xian looked at her last sentence and raised his eyebrows slightly.

“It’s not that Feng Luan doesn’t want to take it down, but it’s because I’m not strong enough? That’s right. I can’t use the strength of the fire lark tribe!”

Wang Xian was deep in thought.

“Sir Wang Xian!”

At this moment, the mayor, Jin Gan Yuan, the President of the Employment Association, and a few other experts walked in. They greeted Wang Xian respectfully.

Wang Xian raised his head and nodded his head faintly.

“Mayor Jin, our Shenghai Town can’t accommodate so many citizens. We have to think of a way to build a house. Otherwise, there will be four to five hundred thousand people without a place to live!”

A few people walked in, and an old man walking behind said in a deep voice.

“Yes, this is a very troublesome matter. However, we can only build it after it is completely safe. For now, let them make do with it!”

Jin Qianyuan nodded, a contemplative look on his face.

“Mayor, should we contact star-moon kingdom and ask for their assistance?”

The old man nodded slowly. After hesitating for a moment, he suddenly spoke.

His words made everyone’s expression turn ugly. The star-moon kingdom had given up on them, but they relied on their own strength and Sir Wang Xian to tide over this crisis.

When they were in danger, when they were about to perish, it wasn’t the star-moon kingdom that saved them.

However, if they did not rely on a kingdom, what could a small town like theirs do?

“Sir Wang Xian, please make the decision on this matter. After all, the holy sea town can continue to exist because of you, Sir Wang Xian!”

Jin Qianyuan looked at Wang Xian and said to them.

“Alright!”

The few of them nodded and looked at Wang Xian. “Sir, please decide the future of the Holy Sea Town!”

Wang Xian had already heard their conversation from the side. He looked at Mayor Jin and the rest and thought of the matter regarding Feng Luan. The corners of his mouth curled up slightly.

“Alright, I’ll make the decision!”

As he spoke, his eyes flickered. “Wait for My News!”

“Alright, Sir Wang Xian. No matter what choice you make, we will support you!”

Everyone nodded their heads.

Wang Xian took out his communication stone plate and revealed a smile.

“I’ll give you a city. Do you want it?” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

He sent it over.

“Huh?”

When Feng Luan saw the message sent by Wang Xian, she was stunned. Then, she smiled.

“Stop joking!”

She sent it over with a smile.

“I’m not joking. It can’t be called a city. It should be a town. You should know about the holy sea town, right?”

“The holy sea town was attacked by demonic beasts. Star-moon kingdom gave up on defending the town. Now That I’m defending it, do you want the Holy Sea Town?”

“Also, there’s a problem that you need to solve!”

Wang Xian continued with a smile on his face.

“This...”

When Feng Luan saw Wang Xian’s message, her body froze. She looked at his message in astonishment.

“Yes!”

She naturally knew about the holy sea town. Her first stop after returning to the transcendence continent was the holy sea town. However, what she didn’t expect was that Wang Xian would gift her a town while she was worrying about a base.

Although it wasn’t a town and was only one-tenth of the size of Donghai City, it was still a town after all.

Just now, he already had the idea of building his own city. Wouldn’t it be more convenient to have a town? It would save a lot of things.

“It really is a lucky star!”

Feng Luan revealed a happy smile.

The old woman at the side saw that the empress suddenly smiled happily at this time, and her face was full of surprise.

What made the Empress So Happy?

“Yun, get ready. Bring all the resources and subordinates to star-moon kingdom. The journey has begun!”

Feng Luan faced the old woman and revealed a confident smile.

“Empress, you are... about the city...”

The old woman looked at her in astonishment.

“Wang Xian gave me a city, the holy sea town. Although it’s not a city, it’s not bad to start with a town!”

The corners of Feng Luan’s eyes were raised, filled with joy.

“Young master Wang gave you a town?”

The old woman was astonished. A town?

“We’ll talk about it when we get there. He doesn’t know how to Joke!”

Feng Luan said with a smile.

“Alright, Empress. I’ll get someone to prepare immediately. If we want to reach holy sea town, it might take more than ten days!”

The old woman said.

“Okay, Go and prepare!”

Feng Luan nodded.

The old woman walked out of the room with a big smile on her face.

“In this life, someone will help the empress, and someone will be with her. She Won’t be as lonely as she was a thousand years ago!”

“I hope that young man can bring a different life to the Empress!”
