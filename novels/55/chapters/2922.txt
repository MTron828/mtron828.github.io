Chapter 2923: Dragon Palace’s shocking decision 3

“Domain Lord, how strong is that Dragon King?”

In the sky above the desolate planet, a god Emperor looked down at the Dragon Palace in the ocean. He was slightly surprised and asked the domain lord curiously.

The other god Emperors also looked at the domain Lord.

The rapid rise of the Dragon Palace had destroyed the two big forces in the starry sky. Now, many people said that the dragon palace was the strongest force in the starry sky.

As the celestial thearch of the glazed domain, although they did not say anything, they were still very curious about the strength of the Dragon Palace.

Was the Dragon Palace really stronger than them?

“Then the Dragon King’s strength should be on the same level as mine!”

The domain Lord pondered for a moment and said.

He could sense a trace of the power from Wang Xian’s body.

“In that case, with the addition of the Divine Dragon, the Dragon Palace is really strong!”

One of the Celestial Thearchs said with a twinkle in his eyes.

“To be able to destroy two major factions and make the eight barrens flee, this dragon palace is really not simple.”

A few celestial thearchs beside him also sighed slightly.

“The Dragon King and the rest have come out. They are so fast. The Dragon Palace is really strong when it comes to the array formation!”

At this moment, they saw Wang Xian flying out from the ocean with a group of experts. Their faces were filled with astonishment as they spoke.

“21 subordinates and 20 celestial thearchs.”

The celestial thearchs of the glazed area swept their gaze over. Their eyes were sparkling.

The governor smiled.

He had brought 20 celestial thearchs over directly. It was the right call to seek help from the Dragon Palace this time.

With such strength, the glazed area could safely survive this crisis.

“Welcome, brothers from the Dragon Palace!”

When Wang Xian and the rest flew over, the domain Lord and the rest immediately greeted them with a smile.

“TSK TSK tsk, you’re too polite.”

Mo Sha Ba Qi and the rest took the lead to respond. After that, the godly monarchs of the dragon palace also looked around curiously.

“Everyone, we, Veluriyam, have prepared a rich feast. After we finish our meal, we can discuss the following matters.”

The domain Lord invited them.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded his head and followed the governor as they flew towards the continent plate in front of them.

“Huh?”

At this moment, Wang Xian and the rest exclaimed in surprise.

“Metal lump from the machine royal territory, die for me!”

At this moment, a god emperor behind the governor had a cold look in his eyes. His body moved and he flew towards the void in front of him instantly.

“Peng!” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

A streak of flame energy struck a spot in the void, producing a sound of collision.

An invisible detection machine was destroyed.

“HMPH!”

That glazed god Emperor snorted coldly and waved his arm once again.

“Peng Peng Peng!”

The sound of collision rang out once again. One by one, the invisible detection machines were destroyed and fell downwards.

“This is the machinery of the Machine Emperor Domain. It has a powerful invisibility detection ability. They are hiding within the void crack to probe the surroundings. Ordinary god King experts would not be able to sense it.”

“They have already detected the situation on our side.”

The governor looked over and said faintly.

“Oh? That’s quite impressive. Even if they were discovered, they can still detect some situations.”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and said.

The governor nodded.

“This kind of thing?”

Ao crab, who was behind Wang Xian, looked at the detection machine that had fallen. He waved his arm and five detection machines flew towards him.

“What’s wrong, ao crab? Did you find anything?”

Prime Minister Gui asked ao crab curiously.

“What’s this material?”

Ao crab held a machine and sensed it. His eyes were shining.

The next moment, he opened his mouth and took a bite on it.

“Crack! Crack! Crack!”

Ao crab took a bite and tasted it.

The celestial thearchs of glazed tile were slightly stunned. They looked at him in astonishment.

“It tastes pretty good!”

However, ao crab said this sentence again, causing the celestial thearchs of glazed tile region to be stunned.

“TSK, TSK, tsk. The taste is very good and the energy is also very abundant. Dragon King, this thing has a great effect on our devouring Dragon!”

Ao crab’s eyes lit up as he said to Wang Xian.

“Oh?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows. “All the machines in the machine royal territory are a kind of special life form. They are life forms that are integrated with metal materials. Is this very useful to the devouring dragon?”

“Yes, Dragon King. These machines are similar to the divine kingdom. They are very useful to us. TSK TSK, what a feast!”

As Ao crab spoke, he looked at the battleships and Mechanical Corps of the machine royal territory. His eyes were burning with excitement.

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered slightly.

At the side, the celestial emperors of the glazed domain were puzzled by their conversation.

What did they mean by that? Could the machinery from the mechanic royal territory still be eaten?

Could eating it increase one’s strength?

“Let’s talk about this later. Domain Lord, let’s Go!”

Wang Xian said to Ao Xie before following the domain Lord and the rest to war continent.

During the two-hour banquet, Wang Xian did not reply to the Dragon Palace’s request to help them deal with the mechanic royal territory or chimei territory.

After the banquet, they went straight to the Dragon Palace.

“Now, let’s discuss whether we should help the glazed domain to fight against the mechanic royal territory or the chimei territory. Since we are here, we are not here for the reward from the glazed domain. Instead, we are here to obtain more information.”

“Initially, we were planning to hunt down demons. Now that the machinery in the mechanic Royal Territory is an evolutionary resource for the Devouring Dragon Clan, we have a choice.”

Sitting on the dragon throne, Wang Xian spoke to Prime Minister Gui and the rest.

They were ready to discuss the next action of the Dragon Palace.

“Dragon King, let’s go to the machine imperial territory. All the machinery in the machine imperial territory is an evolutionary energy for the devouring Dragon Clan. How many robots are there in the entire machine imperial territory?”

“If all of them are devoured by the devouring Dragon Clan, we will be able to obtain a huge improvement.”

Ao crab shouted excitedly.

“Ai Ai, brother crab, I was thinking of raising my strength to the second rank void God Emperor this time!”

At the side, eight Qi said unhappily.

“Eight heads, you brat, shut up!”

Ao crab glared at him.

“If it weren’t for the fact that you have many subordinates, I would have F * cked you!”

Eight Qi curled his lips. He did not dare to be arrogant with AO crab.

Ao crab had a million subordinates, and two of them had the battle strength of a first rank divine emperor.

“Dragon King, didn’t you negotiate with the glazed domain Lord and the others? All the evil demon corpses they killed belong to our Dragon Palace!”

“Our Dragon Palace will guard this side for them. We can kill the robots and raise the devouring dragon.”

“The evil demon corpses killed by the glazed domain will eventually be sent to us.”

Prime Minister Gui said.

Prime Minister GUI had yet to reach the combat strength of the divine emperor. However, his position in the Dragon Palace was still that of the second-in-command.

Furthermore, Prime Minister Gui had to consider the future development of the Dragon Palace.

“If we were to fight against the robots, it wouldn’t be as simple as guarding this place for them.”

Wang Xian’s eyes were sparkling as he said faintly.

“The Machine Empire is the enemy of humans to begin with. As long as they have the strength, they will invade all living creatures.”

“Let’s do it. Our Dragon Palace will wipe them out!”

Prime Minister Gui said.
