Chapter 1495: Dragon of 1,495 people 3

At the birthday banquet venue, Dumu Jiang stared at Dumu Dazhuang’s back with a gloomy face as he walked towards Dumu Jiang.

At the back, Gongsun Ning and the others looked at Dumu Jiang with faint smiles on their faces.

They didn’t pay too much attention to Dumu Jiang. Speaking of which, Gongsun Ning didn’t know Dumu Jiang at all.

He could only be considered as a little brother’s little brother’s little brother. His little brother’s friend wouldn’t be anyone with any background.

It would be a piece of cake to take the young ferocious beast from their hands.

Everyone followed behind Dui Jiang and walked forward leisurely.

In the surroundings, young men greeted Gongsun Ning respectfully from time to time.

Gongsun Ning, who was dressed in red, became a small focal point in the entire banquet hall. Some people would look at him from time to time and discuss in low voices.

“Brother Wang Xian!”

At this moment, Dui Dazhuang, who was walking towards Wang Xian’s seat, felt his brother following behind him. He sped up with an embarrassed expression and shouted at Wang Xian.

“Eh? What’s wrong? Didn’t you enjoy yourself just now? Why? Are you being targeted by a pervert?”

Wang Xian looked at the flustered Dui Dazhuang and teased him with a smile on his face.

“Brother Wang Xian, stop joking around. Little Rascal, go over quickly. That brother of mine wants to take little rascal away. I didn’t agree and he followed me here!”

As Dumu Dazhuang spoke, little rascal jumped onto Wang Xian and squeaked.

“Eh? That brother of yours!”

Wang Xian pinched little rascal’s belly and looked up at the back.

“Dumu Dazhuang, let’s see if you are itching for trouble!”

At this moment, Dumu Jiang’s voice was heard.

This made Dumu Dazhuang shrink his head. He forced a smile and turned his head around. “Big Brother, this ferocious beast cub is really not mine!”

Bam

However, Dumu Jiang slapped him on the head instead.

Dumu Dazhuang didn’t dare to speak. He stood at the side with an apologetic smile.

“You’re a dead thing. How can you have any friends?”

He said with a frosty expression as he looked ahead.

“Hehe!”

However, when he met Wang Xian’s smile, his expression suddenly froze and kept changing.

“What? Are you going to Snatch My Things?”

Wang Xian looked at Dumu Jiang indifferently.

Gulp

Dumu Jiang gulped as a hint of fear appeared in his eyes.

He remembered what happened on the airship very clearly. This young man in front of him was definitely not someone he could provoke.

For a moment, Dumu Jiang stood there and his expression kept changing.

“Dumu Jiang, what are you doing?”

An impatient voice came from behind.

Dumu Jiang turned his head and looked behind him. He walked over with an embarrassed expression.

“Brother Zhou, young master Gongsun, that ferocious beast cub belongs to that young man. He is very strong. I...”

Dumu Jiang stammered.

“Alright!”

Gongsun Ning waved his hand at him and walked straight towards Wang Xian.

The young man at the side Glared at Dumu Jiang, his face full of dissatisfaction.

“Young master, I am Gongsun Ning. I wonder if you can part with your little pet. I can buy it at a high price!”

Gongsun Ning raised his head slightly and walked to a spot about five meters in front of Wang Xian. He looked at Wang Xian with a smile.

“You can’t afford it!”

Wang Xian glanced at Gongsun Ning and said faintly.

“Squeak Squeak!”

Little Rascal, who was at the side, glared at him and bared his fangs and brandished his claws.

“Huh?” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Gongsun Ning was slightly taken aback. A look of astonishment appeared on his face before he started to laugh.

“Hehe, this young master sure knows how to joke. I Can’t afford it? There are things that I, Gongsun Ning, can’t afford?”

He smiled and his expression slowly turned cold as he stared at Wang Xian.

“Not for sale!”

Wang Xian drank a cup of tea and said indifferently.

“Kid, our Gongsun Young Master wants to buy your things to give you face!”

“Give us a price. Don’t be ungrateful!”

When the few young men behind Gongsun Ning saw Wang Xian’s merciless rejection, they threatened him with cold faces.

Wang Xian didn’t bother with them at all. He took out a spirit stone and placed it in front of little goody.

“Crack, crack, crack!”

Little Goody bit the spirit stone and let out a crisp sound, as if it was a silent mockery.

When Dui Dazhuang saw this scene, a bitter expression appeared on his face.

He didn’t even bother with the young master of the He clan and the brothers of the Forest Spirit’s princess, Wang Xian, let alone these few people.

However, Wang Xian ignored him. This made Gongsun Ning’s face turn even colder.

He narrowed his eyes and stared at Wang Xian. Then, he walked over slowly.

The group of young men followed closely behind him. They stared at Wang Xian coldly.

“Brother, are you not giving me face?”

Gongsun Ning walked to a meter in front of Wang Xian slowly. He stared at Wang Xian from above and looked down at him coldly.

“Scram!”

Wang Xian glanced at Gongsun Ning indifferently and said coldly.

“Hehe, interesting. No one has ever dared to tell me to scram. Then, what if I don’t Scram?”

A sinister smile appeared on Gongsun Ning’s face as he stared at Wang Xian expressionlessly.

Bam

When Wang Xian heard his words, he gently put down the tea cover in his hand.

Boom

A grey fist appeared directly on Gongsun Ning’s chest and attacked him.

“What?”

Gongsun Ning’s expression changed drastically. The intense pain in his chest made him spit out blood uncontrollably. His body flew backward.

“You actually dared to ambush Gongsun Ning!”

“You’re courting death!”

The faces of the young men behind Gongsun Ning changed drastically. They hurriedly stretched out their hands to catch Gongsun Ning.

However, the powerful force caused their bodies to continuously retreat backwards.

“Peng!”

The group of youths retreated to a table over ten meters away, and a loud sound rang out, attracting the attention of the surrounding crowd.

“Eh? What’s the situation?”

“There seems to be a conflict. It’s Gongsun Ning Gongzi!”

“Gongsun Ning Gongzi actually spat out fresh blood from his mouth. who injured him? who has the strength to do so?”

The people around were slightly shocked. They looked over in surprise.

“You... you actually dared to sneak attack me!”

Gongsun Ning wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth. He felt embarrassed when he felt the attention of the people around him.

“You’re courting death!”

His vital energy and blood rushed to his head. His figure moved and he attacked Wang Xian directly.

“Ant!”

Wang Xian waved his arm. A greyish energy attacked Gongsun Ning again at a terrifying speed.

“Bang!”

Gongsun Ning, who had just rushed over, didn’t even have time to react before he was struck in the chest again.

A powerful force caused him to spit out blood again. His body was sent flying backward.

This time, he landed heavily on the ground.

His eyes widened in disbelief.

He was Gongsun Ning after all. Other than the young master of the He clan, he was the number one heaven’s favorite within a radius of more than 100,000 kilometers.

Now, he was actually easily defeated!
