Chapter 783: 0784. One sword, two swords, extermination

Translator: 549690339

The life and death battle between the disciples of the Dragon Gate and the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect.

At the beginning, no one was optimistic about the Dragon Gate.

However, two immortal gods suddenly appeared and led a group of young people over. This scene made many people feel that the dragon gate was not as weak as they had imagined.

However, looking at the twenty heaven’s chosen disciples who were competing with each other, most of the disciples of the immortal sect were still optimistic about the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect.

After all, Hua Gujiang was a half-step immortal god monster. One half-step immortal God could deal with at least ten infant realm experts.

At present, only four Heaven’s chosen of the immortal sects were half-step immortal gods. These were the most outstanding disciples who were nurtured by the immortal sects with their enormous resources.

Only the top few immortal gods could nurture such heaven’s chosen and outstanding talents!

“Even if the Dragon Gate is defeated, with the Dragon Gate’s foundation, it’s enough to make most immortal sects fear it. Even the top few immortal sects fear it!”

Some immortal sect disciples thought to themselves.

“Haha, Go To Hell, wood cremation!”

At this moment, Hua Gujiang waved his arm, and drops of green seeds fell to the ground. Thorns crazily burrowed out of the ground.

The five fire element disciples tapped their scepters, and the thorns were instantly covered in flames.

In an instant, the terrifying flaming thorns attacked the ten golden swordfish.

The battle was about to start!

The terrifying attacks instantly covered the entire arena. In an instant, the arena was filled with the terrifying flaming thorns.

The arena within a few kilometers was completely covered. One could imagine how terrifying the power was!

The Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect’s attack instantly caused all the disciples of the immortal sect to reveal shocked expressions.

Even Xuanyuan Fengyi of the Xuanyuan clan and Yu Wenhua of the Yuwen clan watched with solemn expressions.

“One sword!”

However, at this moment, an emotionless voice sounded from within the arena.

“One sword!”

The ten Golden Swordfish let out a soft cry at the same time. With one sword, a resplendent golden sword light directly slashed forward.

This was especially true for the attacks of the five Golden Swordfish in the center. Each sword was a thousand meters long and dozens of meters wide.

The aura of a half-step immortal God instantly exploded out.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

A terrifying sword light swept out.

There was nothing fancy about it, only one sword!

“What! ?”

The instant the Sword Light Condensed, all the immortal gods of the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect quickly stood up, their faces revealing an embarrassed expression.

A low roar resounded throughout the entire arena!

“What’s going on! ?”

Seeing the immortal gods of the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect stand up with embarrassed expressions on their faces, all the disciples of the immortal sect revealed shocked expressions.

“Five half-step immortal gods!”

An immortal god from the Xuan Yuan clan said in a deep voice as his eyes sparkled.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

Under everyone’s astonished gazes, the sword light that could easily crush a dead branch met with the flaming thorns.

The terrifying flaming thorns were like fireworks as they emitted a flash of light on the stage. Soon after, they were drowned by the terrifying sword radiance.

It was so overwhelming that there was no way to block it at all.

The Flames and thorns disappeared at a terrifying speed.

“Block! Block!”

Hua Gujiang’s shocked voice rang out on the stage. His eyes widened as a look of disbelief appeared in his eyes.

The emerald scepter in his hand emitted a dazzling green light.

This was an immortal God’s weapon. It was specially given to him by the immortal gods for today’s battle!

The other nine disciples of the immortal sect were greatly shocked. They looked at the terrifying sword light that was attacking them in terror.

“Buzz Buzz Buzz!”

One by one, the young geniuses placed the scepters in their hands in front of them. The fire shield and the wood shield instantly appeared in front of them.

“If you don’t die with one strike, then one more strike!”

The cold voice sounded again, like a curse that could kill.

The disciples of the Saint Medicine Immortal Sect, who had just blocked the sword light, had a terrified look in their eyes.

There were five half-step immortal gods, and the opponent had five half-step immortal gods. This was a F * cking unequal combat power.

The opponent only had one person and one sword, and they had already used all their strength to block. If one more strike came...

Everyone’s eyes revealed a terrified expression.

Even Hua Gu Jiang, who had arrogantly and domineeringly stared at the position of the Dragon Gate and demanded a battle, felt his heart tremble.

His forehead was filled with cold sweat!

“I can’t block it, I can’t block it!”

A terrifying sword light once again formed. A young man from the Saint Medicine Immortal sect shouted out in fear with eyes filled with fear.

The other eight infant realm disciples also had despair on their faces.

They had used up all of their strength just now. If they attacked again, they wouldn’t be able to defend at all.

Even the sword light attack from the five infant realm young swordsmen made their hearts palpitate, not to mention the five half-step immortal gods!

“Run!”

A young heaven’s favorite’s eyes flashed with panic. Under the shocked gazes of all the disciples of the immortal sects, he turned around and ran out of the arena.

“F * CK, run! This... This is too embarrassing! All the immortal sects are watching, and he’s actually running away!”

“If he doesn’t run, he’ll definitely die. This disciple of the Saint Medicine Immortal sect has completely collapsed. The gap is too big!”

“Five half-step immortal gods! There are five of them! Even the powerful Xuan Yuan clan only managed to nurture one half-step immortal god, Xuanyuan Feng Yi, among the younger generation. Furthermore, Xuanyuan Feng Yi has a high chance of becoming an immortal God!”

“How can the Dragon Gate... how can the Dragon Gate be so powerful? !”

All the disciples of the immortal gate had shocked expressions on their faces.

“Ahhhh!”

Screams of pain rang out in the arena. The disciple who had just escaped had just flown out of the arena’s enchantment when he heard the sounds behind him. Immediately, his scalp went numb, and his eyes were filled with terror as he flew toward the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal Gate with all his might.

“Can you escape?”

At this moment, a cold voice rang out. Terrifying sword rays pierced through the young man’s chest, causing his eyes to widen as his corpse fell towards the ground.

At this moment, traces of sword rays were left behind on the sturdy stage.

At the edge of the stage, Hua Gujiang was half-squatting on the ground. His emerald-green staff was emitting a dazzling light as a green circle surrounded him. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

He was panting heavily, and his eyes were filled with fear.

A dense energy entered his chest from the staff of the artifact of the Immortal God. The defense of this green circle came from a treasure on his chest.

As the most powerful disciple of the Holy Medicine sect and the disciple with the most terrifying talent, he had a life-saving method.

Unless the immortal God made a move, he could not break the defense on his chest!

As for the other disciples of the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect, they had already died under that terrifying sword light!

There was only one sword!

If one sword did not die,

then there would be one more sword!

Two swords, just two swords. The domineering and confident Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect only had one disciple who survived, while the other disciples were all killed!

This result made everyone feel incredulous.

Not only did the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect not win, they were all instantly killed!
