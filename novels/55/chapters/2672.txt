2673 The 2673 Northern Front was lost

“What?”

When Wang Xian’s voice rang out, the sect master and the rest were slightly shocked. Their faces were filled with astonishment.

“There’s a pinnacle immortal king flying towards us?”

“This... There can’t be an even more powerful abyssal seed flying towards us, right?”

The rest of the people also had a drastic change in expression as they growled in a low voice.

“Listen to the Dragon King’s orders, everyone immediately fly out of the abyss seed, quickly, immediately!”

“The Great Sect Warriors from last month are prepared, the moment the situation is dire, immediately lead the planet to escape.”

The leader’s pupils contracted slightly, seeing the members of the Dragon Palace Madly Flying towards the Dragon Mountain, he immediately roared at them.

“Quick quick, immediately teleport to our planet, the moment there really is a pinnacle undying god King Abyss seed, immediately lead the planet to escape.”

The expressions of the Dragon Python group, Ancient God Dynasty and Bei Chuan Sect Warriors all changed, hurriedly flying towards the teleportation formation.

No one doubted the Dragon King’s words.

If the Dragon Palace Emperor had a pinnacle undying emperor seed flying over, then there was a 100% chance.

“Sou Sou Sou.”

Around the Dragon Mountain, ao Xing Mu and the others swiftly moved, storing all the abyss seeds in the space into the Dragon Mountain.

“Boom Boom!”

In the next moment, the dragon peak directly opened and flew out of the Abyss.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

“Roar!”

The moment the Dragon Peak flew out of the abyss, a few earth-shaking roars came from behind.

“Rumble!”

After that roar, a series of rumbling sounds actually came from within the Abyss, and an unparalleled aura rushed over in this direction.

“This is?”

Everyone was shocked, their faces filled with shock as they looked into the depths of the abyss.

“This energy, it’s a pinnacle undying Emperor!”

Last month’s leader and the rest looked over, their expressions changed.

“All Disciples, return to the planet, all warriors, take the planet and leave, the further the better!”

A last month’s leader immediately roared.

“Quick, quick, quick, run.”

“Pinnacle Undying God Emperor abyss seed, how can such a terrifying existence appear, we’re giving up on the north?”

“Giving up on the north? After giving up on the north, the entire demon island will be engulfed by the Abyss again, and where can we run to? This is our home.”

“Damn it, how can there be a pinnacle undying God Emperor Abyss seed!”

Just now everyone was celebrating the victory of the war, yet they had to give up on the northern front and run for their lives, causing their faces to be filled with unwillingness and helplessness.

Some of the elders even trembled.

“Don’t talk too much nonsense, enter the planet, flee, flee, those who don’t want to die leave this place.”

An elder from last month roared loudly.

A pinnacle undying emperor abyss seed, such an existence wasn’t something they could fight against.

Even all of them added together couldn’t defend against the massacre of the Undying Emperor Abyss seed.

Of course, this was only their own opinion.

With the Dragon Palace’s current strength, they could barely fight against one pinnacle undying emperor abyss seed, but if there were two, they would only be slaughtered.

The Dragon Palace couldn’t even hold on for 5 minutes.

Long Feng swiftly flew towards the depths of the starry skies, facing such a crisis, there was simply no way to fight back.

“Boom, Boom, Boom.”

At this time, the surrounding planets also started to move, fleeing into the depths of the starry sky at a terrifying speed.

While guarding the northern front, the various factions also prepared for the worst.

However, to their surprise, they still lost in the end.

Out of the 3,000 to 4,000 planets in the northern front, a few hundred planets started to move.

It was impossible to escape with 3,000 to 4,000 planets at this time.

They could only gather people on these few hundred planets.

“It doesn’t need to be too fast to ensure safety.”

Wang Xian stood on the command platform and looked at the black dot on the screen. Then, he scanned the position behind him.

At this time, even if the two peak immortal King Abyss seeds flew over, they wouldn’t be able to attack Dragon Peak.

“Dragon King, look into the Abyss.”

The heaven array nodded and pointed into the abyss. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

...

Forty to fifty seconds had passed. Now, about thirty seconds had passed.

Thirty seconds had passed. The hundreds of planets had just flown for a short period of time, and the Abyss could still be clearly seen.

“HM?”

Wang Xian looked over and saw two abyssal seeds that carried monstrous flames appearing in the abyss.

One of them was over 10,000 meters in size and had four gigantic wings. Its wingspan spanned over 20,000 to 30,000 meters.

The other abyssal seed had the form of a human, but its head was triangular. Its blood-red eyes could be seen from afar.

It was eerie and terrifying. Its body was about 2,000 to 3,000 meters in size and it held a blood-red bone sword that was about 2,000 meters in size.

The two terrifying abyssal seeds carried a ferocious aura as they flew towards them.

“Not good, look at the abyss, those two abyssal seeds are terrifying!”

“Hiss, are these the pinnacle undying Emperor abyssal seeds?”

“Damn it, why did they suddenly rush over, if it wasn’t for them, we would have won.”

...

On the surrounding planets, some people also saw the silhouettes of these two abyssal seeds.

“Oh no, the speed of those two abyssal seeds has increased again. They actually flew out of the Abyss.”

Right at this moment, everyone was shocked to discover that those two terrifying and invincible abyssal seeds had rushed out of the Abyss.

Their blood-red eyes scanned their surroundings.

“Ka Ka Ka!”

That humanoid abyssal seed waved the bone sword in its hand and directly swept towards the planet that was hundreds of millions of kilometers away to the left.

Dark red energy rushed out directly, turning into a ferocious monster in the air.

“Boom Boom Boom!”

The sound of an explosion rang out. Everyone was shocked to see that the planet hundreds of millions of kilometers away had directly exploded.

Moreover, the abyssal seed’s attack did not dissipate. It continued to charge towards the right.

A crevice that caused one’s scalp to go numb appeared in the void.

“Boom Boom Boom!”

“Boom Boom Boom!”

In the next moment, everyone was shocked to see that on the right, that terrifying attack had destroyed over a dozen planets in a row.

“Hiss!”

When everyone saw this scene, they could not help but suck in a breath of cold air. Their faces were filled with shock.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

At this moment, another abyssal seed with four wings stared at the planets that were flying towards the depths with bloodthirsty eyes.

It raised its head and let out a roar, flapping its wings and chasing at a terrifying speed.

“Not Good, that Pinnacle Undying God king abyss seed is chasing us.”

At this moment, the expressions of all the warriors on the hundreds of planets changed as they roared.

With the speed of that Pinnacle Undying God king abyss seed, it would quickly catch up to them.

The moment it caught up, they would be like the dozens of planets, exploding.

“Roar!”

At this moment, behind the peak of the godly monarch abyss species, a tail that looked terrifying suddenly rose up. At the end of the tail was a sharp thorn.

“Sou!”

That Sharp Thorn aimed at a fleeing planet and directly charged towards it.

“Not good, everyone immediately flee to their own divine kingdoms.”

The experts on the planet that was attacked had faces full of shock as they immediately roared.
