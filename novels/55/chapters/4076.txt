“Next, let’s see if I can still improve my strength! ”

After the elven empress left, Wang Xian stood on the branch of the Tree of chaos, deep in thought.

It was extremely difficult for a group of powerhouses in the Heaven’s origin realm to improve their strength.

Even if it was tens of billions of years, there was a possibility that their strength would not improve at all.

However, Wang Xian was different. His current realm was only at the seventh level of the universe dominator.

His current breakthrough did not have any restrictions at all. As long as he had sufficient resources, it would be fine!

As long as he had the resources, he would be able to achieve a breakthrough very quickly.

It would be comparable to the control level of the Heaven’s origin creation, or even the Great Dao level!

However, the amount of resources required for Wang Xian to achieve a breakthrough was too much!

It was so much that it was a little terrifying!

The resources in the Dragon Palace could not satisfy his consumption at all. He needed to search for them himself.Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“There will be treasures appearing around the tree of chaos. You can go and search for them yourself! ”

Wang Xian spoke as he scanned his surroundings.

This was an incomparably vast tree with no end in sight.

A single leaf was as big as a continent.

Standing here, Wang Xian’s human-shaped body felt extremely tiny!

“Tree of Chaos! ”

He looked at the branch under his feet and his mind stirred slightly. The branch of the ancestral tree appeared in his palm.

The branches of the ancestral tree landed on the tree of chaos.

However, the tree of chaos did not react at all. Wang Xian did not feel any changes to the ancestral tree either!

“I wonder what level of existence this tree of Chaos is. ”

Wang Xian mumbled.

After a while, he did not bother about the tree of chaos anymore.

His body moved and he immediately flew out of the tree of Chaos!

Outside the tree of chaos, there was a dead silence of chaos.

Within the chaos, there was some Great Terror!

Wang Xian had entered the chaos before. It was dead silent inside and there was no energy at all.

Only existences at the Heaven’s origin level could travel in the Chaos!

“Linniu, let’s go. Let’s enter the chaos and see if we can find any treasures!”

Wang Xian said to Linniu.

“It’s the Dragon King! ”

Linniu nodded his head. He flew to Wang Xian and brought him directly into the Chaos!

Buzz

After entering the chaos, they released a stream of energy.

Everything around them was gray as if the world had yet to open!

Wang Xian’s mind stirred and the energy started to explore the surroundings!

The Linniu also scanned his surroundings and flew straight in one direction!

They scanned their surroundings, but they did not sense anything.

The entire space seemed to be dead silent. There was no sound at all!

It gave off a very oppressive feeling!

There was no sound, no vitality, and no light!

There was even no direction!

They could only remember the route they took or the sensing they left behind at the tree of Chaos!

“Dragon King, this chaotic world feels so terrifying. There isn’t even any energy being absorbed in the surroundings. ”

Even after flying for more than ten days, they still couldn’t sense anything!

There was nothing but a grayish color.

A grayish aura!

“Yes, there are no living things in plants or animals! ”

Wang Xian nodded his head and continued to observe his surroundings!

In such an environment, even if the Heaven’s origin destiny was roaming in the chaos, it could go crazy after a long period of time!

It was too depressing!

There was no sign of life.

It was as though he was the only one in the world!

Wang Xian continued to fly forward while conversing with the Unicorn Ox!

Buzz Buzz

After flying for another month, some sounds were suddenly heard! When Wang Xian heard this sound, his eyes narrowed slightly!

“Dragon King, there’s movement! ”

Lin Niu also sensed something and spoke to Wang Xian!

“Let’s Go! ”

Wang Xian nodded and instructed him.

Lin Niu’s body moved and immediately flew towards the source of the sound!

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom

Boom! Boom! Boom

When they got closer, the sound became louder and louder! At the same time, all kinds of energy charged towards them!

“This is? The power of lightning! ”

Lin Niu sensed something and said as he rushed over!

When they got closer, a shocking scene appeared in their sight.

In the chaotic space in front of them, there were terrifying bolts of lightning flashing continuously.

Around this bolt of lightning, it actually formed a space of lightning.

The Lightning tore open a brand new space. This scene was as though it was creating a world!

“What’s going on?”

Wang Xian looked at the shocking scene in front of him and was filled with

shock!

“Dragon King, this scene should have a great effect on the cultivation of the Lightning attribute. These bolts of lightning contain a special charm and possess a powerful attack method! ” Lin Niu stared ahead and spoke!

Wang Xian felt something as he watched!

His gaze was fixed on the Thunderbolts in front of him.

However, he did not see anything!

The improvement of a heaven origin creator was entirely due to his understanding of the universe!

Wang Xian himself was not at this realm. In fact, his true realm was merely the seventh level of the universe overlord.

Therefore, he could not see anything from the Thunderbolts in front of him!

Wang Xian stared at the Lightning carefully.

However, what surprised him was that as time passed, the Lightning was getting weaker and weaker!

The space around the lightning seemed to be being squeezed bit by bit!

“What’s going on?”

Wang Xian looked at this scene.

The lightning could not break through the shackles of the chaotic space?

It could not be born successfully!

What would happen if the Thunderbolt was born successfully?

Would it be born into a powerful treasure?

Would this thunderbolt even give birth to its own intelligence?

This was the first time Wang Xian had ventured deep into the chaotic space. He was completely clueless about the scene in front of him!

“Dragon King, the Thunderbolt is about to disappear. It will be destroyed by the chaotic space. However, Dragon King, this thunderbolt is material. Can We put it away?”

Lin Niu suddenly spoke to Wang Xian!

This made Wang Xian’s heart skip a beat!

The energy contained in this lightning was far beyond the peak of the Overlord realm!

Material Lightning was not a virtual object!

If there was no interference from the energy, he would gradually disappear into the chaos!

A complete fusion with the chaos!

However, what would happen if he was put away?

Could it be used as a powerful treasure?

Could it be absorbed?

Wang Xian’s eyes focused. His body moved and he immediately flew towards the lightning bolt!

Lin Niu did not hesitate and flew towards the lightning bolt!

The lightning bolt was too big and it covered an area that was comparable to some small planets!

However, the energy from Wang Xian and the rest could completely envelop it with a wave of their hands!

Wang Xian stretched out his palm and transformed it into a gigantic dragon claw. He wanted to hold the Thunderbolt in his hand!

Crack! Crack

Sensing Wang Xian’s attack, the Thunderbolt seemed to possess intelligence as it attacked the Dragon Claw directly!
