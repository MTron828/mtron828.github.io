“Hiss!”

“This is the power of the Dragon Palace, the two ancestors of the world margin sect, world margin sect and the others controlling the world margin ruler, they are all being held back.”

“There are so many undyings in the Dragon Palace, another 10,000 have flown out, along with at least 30,000 archers, this is close to 60,000 undyings, right?”

“The most terrifying thing is the black and white creatures, no one noticed them before, 10,000 undyings were killed, it’s too terrifying.”

“Look at those three brambles, they are completely suppressing the two ancestors and the leader of the world margin sect.”

When the 10,000 undyings rushed out, the surrounding warriors and disciples were all shocked.

Within a Dragon Mountain, not only were there beings that could fight against pinnacle undying emperors, there were also close to 60,000 undying emperors.

The world margin sect had 70,000 to 80,000 undying emperors, however this time there were only 50,000.

And out of these 50,000, over 10,000 were killed by strange demon and the others.

Another important point was that the world margin sect’s elders had already been killed by the Dragon Palace by six.

In terms of high level battle strength, the Dragon Palace had an overwhelming advantage.

“Not good, the Dragon Palace has seven to eight undying fighters of the ninth level.”

When the Starwood Dragon species all rushed out of Dragon Mountain and charged towards the group of warriors and disciples of the world margin sect surrounding Dragon Mountain.

An elder felt the terrifying power and roared in shock.

There were 15 undying god King Level 9 warriors, the sect leader and 2 elders wanted to control the world end ruler, 6 elders were killed, 2 elders were guarding the land of the world end sect, they could only use 4 undying god King Level 9 warriors.

They were not a match for the Dragon Palace.

What made them even more shocked was that the 60,000 members were all undying level.

There weren’t even any below undying level.

Their eternal god Lord Disciples were completely slaughtered by the Undying Emperor’s attacks.

Sou Sou Sou

As the Starwood Dragon charged out, thorns began to cover their surroundings.

Arrows and thorns filled the sky. In an instant, over a million disciples of the world margin great sect were killed.

“Ahhhh!”

Miserable cries rang out. The expressions of the experts of the world margin great sect changed slightly, and their eyes revealed an incomparably violent killing intent.

“Kill, kill them!”

Although the world margin great sect was slightly weaker, it was not as if they did not have the slightest ability to resist. The experts roared furiously.

Weng Weng Weng Weng

At this time, over 10,000 strange monsters moved and hid in space.

“All world margin disciples be careful, watch out for that assassin.”

An elder saw it and his expression changed, immediately warning loudly.

“Elder, the opponent is too strong, we aren’t their match.”

Behind them, a group of eternal God Lord Level Disciples watched the battle in fear.

The battle in front of them wasn’t something they could participate in.

Just being hit by the aftershocks of the undying battle could kill them.

Only a god Lord level could fight on the battlefield.

The rest weren’t qualified.

This made the tens of millions of disciples of the world margin sect panic.

Right now, not to mention surrounding the Dragon Palace, even being able to fly dozens of km ahead without dying was already a heaven defying luck.

“Buzz!” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The five elements millstone swept across the surroundings from the sky.

Seeing that terrifying attack, the elders of the world margin sect had to defend themselves.

If they didn’t defend, many disciples of the world margin sect would be killed!

“Whoosh!”

However, when he was defending himself, an arrow directly shot toward him.

“SH * t!”

The elder’s expression changed drastically, and he hurriedly retreated, giving up on defending.

“Buzz!”

The river of destruction swept past, drawing out a death domain. The disciples of the world margin sect were filled with fear.

“No, no!”

Screams rang out, and the hundreds of thousands of disciples who were enveloped frantically fled outside.

However, they were really too weak.

They didn’t even have time to return to their eternal divine kingdom, and were directly killed.

“The Horizon sect is no match for the Dragon Palace at all. If this continues, all their disciples will be slaughtered.”

...

“The disciples of the horizon sect have gathered to surround the Dragon Peak. They are completely gathered to wait for the Dragon Palace to kill them.”

“The Dragon Palace’s strength is so terrifying. The Horizon sect is in big trouble.”

All the powerful disciples around were shocked when they saw the scene on the battlefield.

Who could have imagined such a situation?

Initially, everyone thought that the dragon palace was stupid and seeking death, but now it seemed that the stupid one was the world margin sect!

To surround Dragon Peak with such power was no different from seeking death.

“Sect leader, forefather, we aren’t their match!”

After a short clash, the Undying God King level warriors lost their fighting spirit and roared in fear.

“Damn it, how can this Dragon Palace be so strong?”

Above them, the two forefathers of the world margin sect, the sect leader and the elders all had changing expressions.

They were barely able to dodge the Thorn Monster’s attack.

...

Hearing the sounds below, their hearts shook violently.

They knew that world margin wasn’t a match for the Dragon Palace, they were about to lose.

“All the powerhouses and disciples, run!”

One of the Tian Ya patriarchs gritted his teeth. His arm was struck by a thorn and his arm was instantly broken. He shouted in shock and anger.

He was defeated. He was completely defeated.

“You want to run away now? Aren’t you too naive? You want to destroy our Dragon Palace. How can we let you escape so easily?”

Wang Xian was standing on the command platform. When he heard the voice of the Tian Ya Patriarch, a cold expression appeared on his face.

Buzz

At the side, the Heaven Formation’s arm moved and a strange space slowly covered the area in front of him.

The black hole disturbed the space.

While the Heaven Formation was controlling the bramble monster, it had already allocated some of its energy to set up this formation.

The formation was activated and spread forward at a terrifying speed. It covered an area of one billion kilometers.

“This is?”

The surrounding space suddenly changed, causing everyone’s expressions to change drastically. A bad premonition enveloped their hearts.

“Not good. Elder, patriarch, I can’t sense my eternal divine kingdom. I Can’t return to my divine kingdom.”

A terrified voice sounded, and a god Lord level disciple was filled with panic.

They weren’t a match to begin with. If they continued fighting for a long time, they would all die.

Now that they could not return to their own divine kingdoms, it was no different from waiting for death?

“This is an array formation, a powerful trapping array.”

A patriarch of the world margin sect was also filled with fear.

“Break the array formation, break the array formation!”
