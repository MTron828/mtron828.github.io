Chapter 1466: 1466, this child can not be left behind

“Kill him, kill this beast!”

An angry roar sounded in front of the northern flowing sea sky high sword sect.

The Wu clan’s patriarch stared at Ren Xingchen with a furious expression and roared ferociously.

This child must not be left behind.

To be able to kill a profound void first rank expert at such a young age, such a talented genius becoming enemies with the Wu clan was a huge hidden danger to the Wu clan.

“Eh? What’s going on? Why is there a sudden fight over there?”

“That, it seems to be the Wu clan from the ancient magic city. Who is that young man?”

“The Wu clan’s influence isn’t weak. A young man is going against the Wu clan. This is simply courting death!”

The Wu clan’s clan leader’s roar attracted the attention of everyone around.

The other forces that had brought their clan disciples over looked over and revealed astonished expressions.

“There seems to be someone fighting at the entrance of our Sky High Sword sect!”

“Hehe, let them fight. It’s just a small group of people fighting and some people dying. Don’t worry about it!”

“If we guard the entrance here, we’ll be able to see a fight. Not Bad, not bad!”

At the entrance of Sky High Sword sect, two disciples who were guarding the entrance looked over with smiles on their faces.

They looked as if they were watching a show, as if they did not care at all.

“Kill!”

On the ship of the Wu clan, four to five insightful void tier experts attacked Ren Xingchen without any hesitation.

This child must not be allowed to escape!

In the entire Wu clan, there were around ten insightful void tier experts who were at level three.

Five insightful void tier experts charged over, including two at level two.

In a city, this power would be considered a top-tier power.

“I really didn’t expect this kid to have reached this level, to be able to kill a first level insightful emptiness realm expert!”

In the position of the song clan, the clan leader of the song clan also stared at Ren Xingchen with a face full of surprise.

“That... that was only because that Wu clan expert didn’t use his full strength. He was caught off guard and was killed. Now, he’s dead for sure!”

Song Wan’s expression was unsightly as she spoke from the side.

“No matter how peerless his magnificence is, he is still too young!”

The song clan’s clan leader at the side slowly nodded his head.

However, very quickly, something that shocked him happened.

“I have returned this time to exterminate all of Your Wu clan’s People!”

Ren Xingchen looked at the five profound void martial experts that were attacking him, and a ghastly expression appeared on his face.

The long sword in his hand trembled, and the two types of energy, gold and water, directly attacked the five people.

“Gold and water, that moment of brilliance!”

He lightly shouted, and a ray of gold and blue light directly swept forward.

“Not good, his strength is very strong, and he’s not only at the first level of the insightful emptiness realm!”

An old man in the center sensed the attack of the two colors of gold and water, and his expression changed greatly, and he warned loudly in panic.

“Die!”

Ren Xingchen’s face revealed a cold expression. The two-elemental divine ability once again attacked.

The bottom was water, and the top was gold.

Two rays of light attacked.

“I don’t believe that a little bastard like you can be my opponent!”

A vicious expression appeared on the face of an old man at rank 2 profound void martial stage. The golden energy of the sharp sword directly charged forward.

“Hong!”

The sea water exploded, and the golden sword directly dissipated in the air. The golden light continued to charge out.

Of the two attacks, the elder’s golden sword was unable to block even one.

“Be careful!”

The elder’s face was filled with shock as he hurriedly shouted out. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Shit, how is this possible!”

“Blade ring!”

The Wu clan leader’s expression also changed greatly, as a golden blade instantly appeared in his hand, and he went to support the 5 clan members.

“Ah!”

However, even if he was the first to help, the three clan members of the first rank of the profound void martial stage did not have the slightest ability to resist the golden water’s attack.

The other two Wu clan experts of the second rank of the profound void martial stage had red faces as they resisted.

If it was not for the broadsword ring that appeared in front of them, they would also be in deep trouble.

Although Ren Xingchen’s current strength was only at the second rank of the profound void martial stage, under the golden water dual cultivation, he could completely surpass his level to fight.

“Third level of the profound void martial stage, little bastard, you actually have the strength of the third level of the profound void Martial Stage!”

The Wu Clan’s clan leader roared with a face full of fear.

Third level of the profound void martial stage, this was the third level of the profound void martial stage, and his own strength was only so-so.

Back then, the strongest member of the Ren clan was only at the third level of the profound void martial stage.

Now, this remnant of the Ren clan, who was not even forty years old, actually also possessed the strength of the third level of the profound void martial stage.

Just thinking about it made him feel somewhat terrifying.

“Today, I will exterminate your Wu clan and take revenge for everyone in my Ren clan!”

Ren Xingchen roared with a face full of killing intent.

“Dharma Idol: golden water flowing sand!”

Without the slightest hesitation, he directly unleashed his strongest attack and attacked the Wu clan’s clan leader.

“Little Bastard, even if you obtain a great opportunity, today, I will still kill you!”

The Wu clan leader roared with a ferocious expression. He raised the long saber in his hand and also unleashed his dharma idol.

“Boom!”

A violent collision caused both of them to retreat a few hundred meters.

“Wu clan leader, I want you to watch as your Wu clan members die one by one!”

Ren Xingchen gripped the long sword in his hand tightly and controlled his dharma idol to charge forward once again.

This time, his target was the Wu clan’s ship.

“Damn it, you little bastard, you’re courting death!”

The Wu clan’s leader’s expression changed drastically when he saw Ren Xingchen charging towards his clansmen.

“Not good, run quickly!”

“He actually has the strength of a third level void interpretation expert, let’s run quickly!”

When the more than 400 people of the Wu clan saw Ren Xingchen’s target on them, their faces were filled with shock.

They did not have the strength to resist the attack of a rank 3 profound void martial expert.

Even the aftershocks of the battle could kill them.

“Hong Hong!”

“Ah Ah Ah!”

Two terrifying sounds of collision rang out.

One was Ren Xingchen blocking the attack of the Wu clan leader, while the other was his attack landing on the ship of the Wu clan.

The destructive attack caused the 400 people of the Wu clan to lose more than half of their forces.

The entire ship slowly cracked under his attack.

All the people of the song clan were terrified when they saw this scene.

“This isn’t real. How could he have the strength of a level 3 profound void martial artist? !”

The song clan leader and Song Wan fled to the ship of the song clan in fear. They watched the battle in shock.

Ren Xingchen was a level 3 profound void martial artist?

This was impossible!

“What? That young man is actually a third level profound void martial expert!”

“My God, how could there be such a young expert? His talent is unparalleled in the entire Liuhai Region!”

“Which faction’s young man is from? Which clan is the Ren clan from? Even the heaven’s favored son of the vast region can’t compare to him!”

Sounds of shock could be heard from the surrounding areas.

Even the ten or so disciples at the entrance of the towering sky sword sect widened their eyes, filled with shock.

This... This strength, the eldest senior brother of the younger generation of their towering sky sword sect was only at the first level of the profound void tier!
