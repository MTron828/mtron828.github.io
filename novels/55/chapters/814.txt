Chapter 815: 0816 half a year

Translator: 549690339

Time passed day by day. In the blink of an eye, half a year had passed in the boiling battle between Immortals and gods.

During this half a year, the Dragon Palace had completely spread its name throughout the entire jianghu. Any immortal sect that was famous would be afraid of it.

Moreover, when the Dragon Gate forging workshop opened for business again, it was built in the cities under the immortal sects. It was completely not built in the real cities.

As for the Longmen forging workshop, it completely monopolized the business of medicinal pills and refining weapons in the entire jianghu.

In just half a year’s time, Wang Xian had obtained a terrifying amount of resources.

“In half a year’s time, I’ve increased 100 million Dragon Qi. I’m still short of 50 million to completely break through. According to Feng Luan, after my strength breaks through, my realm will be extraordinary.”

“According to the realms on the extraordinary continent, I’m not at the immortal realm at all, but the rebirth realm. Above the rebirth realm, I’ll be extraordinary, above the transcendent realm, I’ll be at the profound void realm, and above that, I’ll be at the longevity realm

“According to Feng Luan’s estimation, the creatures on Earth at present can only cultivate to the extraordinary realm at most. Above that, the resources on Earth can’t reach it at all

“During this half a year, if I don’t distribute the resources to the members of the Dragon Palace, I should be able to achieve a breakthrough in my strength!”

Wang Xian mumbled as he looked at his attributes. His mind was full of thoughts.

In this half a year, not only did Wang Xian’s strength improve tremendously and he was on the verge of a breakthrough, even Lan Qingyue and Xiao Yu’s strength had also improved tremendously.

Now, Lan Qingyue and her first Kun had already broken through to the immortal realm.

The moment they broke through, they immediately possessed the strength of a middle-level immortal. This was especially so for Kun, whose body size had reached about 150 meters. It was truly terrifying.

In addition, Xiao Yu, elder fan, and Sun Lingxiu had also broken through to the immortal realm.

Only Tang Yinxuan had only reached the half-step immortal realm.

Apart from the few girls, the strength of the entire Dragon Palace had also increased tremendously.

With all kinds of medicinal pills and the energy from the corpses of the Immortal Gods of the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect.

The entire Dragon Palace had increased by eleven immortal gods in half a year.

Four appeared in the Strange Thorn Clan, Ao Yecha had advanced to the immortal God realm, two appeared in the Devil Monkey Clan, two appeared in the Golden Swordfish clan, and two appeared in the strange prawn clan.

There were eleven immortal gods. Including the previous sixteen, there were a total of twenty-seven immortal gods in the Dragon Palace.

If Wang Xian, Xiao Yu, and the others were included, there were a total of thirty-four immortal gods.

Thirty-four immortal gods. This was definitely a terrifying strength.

In addition to the immortal gods, the number of half-step immortal God realm experts in the Dragon Palace had increased by more than eighty.

The number of infant realm experts had reached more than 700.

In the past half a year, the Dragon Palace had not only obtained medicinal pills and metal materials, but also a large number of spirit stones.

These spirit stones could increase the speed of cultivation. It was also because of this that the members of the Dragon Palace could break through so quickly.

With the current strength of the Dragon Palace, it was highly possible for them to destroy four to five top ten immortal sects at the same time.

The increase in the strength of the Dragon Palace was equivalent to the increase in the strength of Wang Xian. Therefore, he sacrificed some resources to the subordinates of the Dragon Palace.

“Dragon King!”

At this moment, Prime Minister Gui and Ao Yao came to the Dragon King’s Hall and greeted Wang Xian respectfully.

“Speak!”

Wang Xian sat on the dragon throne and spoke in a dignified manner.

For the past half a year, he had basically been in the Dragon Palace.

The Dragon Palace was currently built in the four major divisions. The Demon War division was in charge of combat, Ao Qitian was in charge, and the demon monkey clan was in charge!

The Thunder Division was in charge of the Thunder Prawn clan, which was also the strange prawn clan. They were in charge of combat, and Ao Qi was in charge!

The Dragon Guard division was in charge of the Yaksha clan, which was in charge of patrolling and defending, and Ao Yaksha was in charge!

The Dragon Spur division was in charge of the strange demon clan, which was in charge of assassinating and gathering information!

Apart from the four major divisions, there was also a dragon guard, which could also be called an internal expert. They mainly followed Wang Xian.

The Dragon Guard was a golden swordfish clan, and Ao Jian was in charge.

In addition, there were two more special positions, the maid and the guard of the Palace of Dragon King.

The maid was in charge of organizing some of Wang Xian’s things.

Ao Shi was in charge of the duties similar to that of a young eunuch.

In addition, they also had some subordinates who were in charge of the flowers and plants in the Dragon Palace, guarding some places.

The entire Dragon Palace had already established a preliminary and perfect order, and the civil servants that Prime Minister Turtle had trained had also been completed. It seemed that the Turtles in the Dragon Palace, who were carrying turtle shells on their backs, were enlightening the creatures of the Dragon Palace and teaching them some knowledge.

“Dragon King, our AO Monster Clan has thoroughly explored the sea area within a thousand kilometers. There are three immortal-level creatures in the black area on the map. One of them is a giant snake that is a superior immortal with nine heads

“At the red area on the map, there are two immortal-level creatures!”

“In addition, in the Pacific Ocean deeper in the map, there are many giant squid species!”

Ao Yao reported to Wang Xian. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Compared to the past, ao Yao had a cold expression. Although he was very intelligent, he did not know how to handle many things.

Under the teachings of the civil officials, Ao Yao was now able to take charge of his own affairs and possessed his own powerful intelligence.

Upon hearing his report, Wang Xian nodded his head slowly.

The resources in Jianghu were getting lesser and lesser. Wang Xian set his sights on the ocean.

He had roughly investigated the ocean in the past. Now, he was officially sweeping across the ocean to build an invincible underwater dragon palace.

Furthermore, Wang Xian had to start devouring and advance to the transcendence realm as soon as possible.

“Alright, bring along the demon war division, Thunder Division, and the five supernatural beings. We will sweep the area closest to us!”

Wang Xian pondered for a moment and ordered them.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

“Brother!”

At this moment, Xiao Yu ran in and shouted at Wang Xian.

“What’s Wrong?”

Wang Xian waved at them and looked at Xiao Yu with a smile.

“I’m Going Out Tomorrow. Let’s go out and play!”

Xiao Yu walked over. In half a year’s time, the little girl was becoming more and more graceful.

“What? Are you going on a date with that Feng Lingtian?”

The corners of Wang Xian’s mouth curled up as he asked with a smile on his face.

“What? There are many of us here. Brother, don’t make wild guesses!”

Xiao Yu’s face was slightly red as she said hurriedly.

“Alright, Alright. Go, go. Let one of the guards of the Golden Swordfish follow you!”

Wang Xian said dotingly.

“There’s no need. I’ve already broken through to the immortal realm. Furthermore, I’m your younger sister. Who would dare to provoke me!”

“Better safe than sorry!”
