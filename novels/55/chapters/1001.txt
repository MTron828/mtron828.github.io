Chapter 1002: 1003 diamond level mission

Translator: 5496903

“May I know what kind of mission leader Zhang is referring to when he invited me over?”

The amethyst mercenary group and the harp mercenary group sat down. All of them looked at Wang Xian and didn’t know what to say for a moment.

They really didn’t know how to reply to Wang Xian who was so powerful and unpredictable. They felt a little awkward.

Wang Xian looked at them with a smile and asked directly.

Wang Xian had a good impression of the girls in the amethyst mercenary group.

This seemingly ordinary Xia houming dared to speak directly and made an enemy out of the young master’s mercenary group.

Their actions also made Wang Xian have a good impression of him.

“Mission?”

Xia houming took a look at Zhang Yitian and asked, “The mission in the Dragon Wind Region?”

“Yes!”

Zhang Yitian nodded and looked at Wang Xian. “Commander Wang, the main purpose of this gathering is to discuss the mission of the demon beasts in the Dragon Wind Region!”

As she spoke, she took out a document and handed it to Wang Xian.

“There is a race of demon beasts in the Dragon Wind region, the wind wing savage fish. This is a very powerful race!”

“The demon beasts of this race are bloodthirsty by nature. Four years ago, they controlled other ferocious beasts and started a monster siege in Donghai City!”

“At that time, it was fortunate that the city lord of the East Sea city and the other experts discovered it in time. They moved out together and killed all the experts of the wind-winged savage fish!”

As Zhang Yitian spoke, Wang Xian revealed a curious expression on his face.

“Is the mission related to this wind-winged savage fish?”

Wang Xian asked curiously.

He had only seen demon beasts once in the wilderness when he came to the extraordinary mainland. They were cunning and intelligent. They were much more difficult to deal with than ferocious beasts.

“A demon beast race. Just like humans, they have their own territory and their own nest. The same goes for the wind-wing Savage Fish Demon Beasts. The Demon Hunters Academy has a file on the wind-wing savage fish

“Back then, after the Lords of the Eastern Sea city killed the top-tier demon beasts of the wind-wing savage fish race, they sent people to the nest of the wind-wing savage fish. However, they didn’t find anything there, not even a single wind-wing savage fish

“Later, a mercenary group went to the territory of the wind-wing savage fish with the hope of getting lucky, but they didn’t come back

“According to some news in the past few years, some scholars speculated that the Demon Beast Race of the wind-wing savage fish still existed, but there were no more powerful wind-wing savage fish there

“Once an expert went to their nest, they would immediately run away, and if they were weak, they would be killed by the wind-wing savage fish

“In order to prevent this cunning demonic beast race from harming Donghai city when they grow up, the mercenary group has always had a one-star diamond mission to eliminate the wind-wing savage fish!”

Zhang Yuntian continued to speak to Wang Xian.

Wang Xian nodded slowly. Looking at the information on the wind-wing savage fish, he asked in puzzlement, “Is this mission not too different from the other missions?”

“Commander Wang, the wind-wing savage fish used to be a very powerful demonic beast race. After the top-tier demonic beasts were killed, the remaining ones were all weak. However, all the treasures in the demonic beast race are in the hands of these weak demonic beasts!”

As Zhang Yitian spoke, his eyes lit up.

“A race with four to five extraordinary level nine demonic beasts must have extremely rich treasures. If we can exterminate the wind-wing savage fish race, not only will we be able to complete the mission, but we will also be able to obtain a huge treasure. This mission is not something that other missions can compare to!”

Xia houming’s eyes lit up as he said.

The mission in the Dragon Wind region was a mission that all the mercenary groups wanted to complete. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

The treasure trove of a top-tier demonic beast clan was even richer than that of a top-tier clan in Donghai city.

“Is that so?”

Wang Xian’s heart was moved!

Treasure Trove. If he could really obtain a treasure trove, then the members of the Dragon Palace and his abilities would be greatly enhanced.

“Yes, the entire East Sea City knows about this mission, but it’s very difficult. Once the powerful mercenary groups pass by, the crafty wind-wing savage fish will quickly escape, and the weak mercenary groups will be destroyed by them. This is also because the level of the demon beasts isn’t high, and the mission is diamond-level!”

“After some students of our demon Hunter College checked the information, they found that once an expert above rank seven extraordinary realm appeared on this mission, the other party would run away, and anyone below rank seven extraordinary realm would be killed!”

“We are preparing to team up with some powerful mercenary groups from the academy and ask them to find some experts to head to the territory of the wind-winged savage fish together!”

Zhang Yuntian said to Wang Xian.

“Form a team to complete the mission together?”

Wang Xian looked at them and asked curiously.

“It’s not a team. We can also split up and act independently. If we split up, we can also split up the strength of the wind-winged savage fish and reduce the danger. As for who can obtain the treasure, it will depend on our strength and luck!”

Zhang Yitian shook his head.

“When do we set off?”

Wang Xian pondered for a moment and asked directly.

“Commander Wang, do you agree to do this mission with us?”

Zhang Yitian asked in pleasant surprise.

Although they didn’t know Wang Xian’s strength, he should be at level seven of the supernatural realm. They were in need of such an expert.

“Of course we’ll Go!”

Wang Xian nodded his head.

“Captain Zhang, Big Brother, why don’t We Go Together? This way, we can take care of each other and distribute the treasures according to our respective strengths?”

Xia houming suggested from the side.

Zhang Yitian looked at him and then at Wang Xian.

“It’s up to you guys to decide. I Don’t Care!”

Wang Xian said to Zhang Yitian.

This matter was invited by the amethyst mercenary group. It wasn’t appropriate for him to make his own decision.

It would be much more convenient to go with them.

At the very least, he didn’t need to look through a lot of information. It would be much more convenient to know from them.

“Sure, commander Xia Hou. Please send someone to ask the other mercenary groups if they want to go to the territory of the wind-winged Savage Fish Demon Beasts. However, after they get there, they have to act on their own!”

Zhang Yitian nodded and said to Xiahou Ming.

“Alright, I’ll go and ask them immediately!”

Xiahou Ming nodded. He looked at Wang Xian and hesitated for a moment. “Brother, are you sure you want to leave the city? where is the Yun Family?”

“Don’t worry. We have agreed on a location outside the city. When the time comes, I’ll look for you guys. They won’t notice me!”

Wang Xian smiled.

He told the young master’s mercenary group that it was Wang Xian who intentionally said that Yun Hanhai and the rest were killed by him.

Since this young master’s mercenary group wanted to kill him, he would let them come over.

Coincidentally, he was currently in dire need of spirit stones. If they came to kill him, they would be able to send him a lot of spirit stones.

As for the Yun family, which had a transcendent level nine status, it was also part of his plan.

The Yun family was one of the top families in East Sea city. Now that the dragon Spike had arrived, it was only natural for them to become famous.

He would use the Yun family to increase the reputation of the dragon spike!
