Chapter 514: Nether Skull

Ka ka ka!

Creepy noises came from the corpses of the three members of the Remains. The red flames on them had disappeared and were replaced by black will-o’-wisps.

The will-o’-wisps burned creepily on their bodies and in just a dozen or so seconds, their bodies had vanished completely.

Wang Xian revealed a faint smile and the Nether Skull returned to the size of a human head.

He moved his arm and the Nether Skull hovered above his shoulder.

From the location of the eyes, black will-o’-wisps glowed intensely. The next moment, it turned to face the crows on the branches.

Cadaveric Crow: Level 7

“Level 7 cadaveric crows! There are at least a few thousands cadaveric crows around them. The Remains are really strong. It’s no surprise considering that they’ve been lying low for fifty years!”

Wang Xian looked across the thousands and thousands of cadaveric crows in shock before continuing to walk ahead.

Ga ga!

Just as he was about to take another step forward, those cadaveric crows stared at him with their blood-red eyes. Using their razor-sharp beaks as weapons, they charged towards Wang Xian.

Bzz bzz!

The Nether Skull on Wang Xian’s shoulder appeared to be exceptionally excited. Will-o’-wisps came from the bones of corpses. Cadaveric crows had far more will-o’-wisps in them than ordinary people.

Ka ka!

With just a thought, the Nether Skull on his shoulder flew towards the flock of cadaveric crows. Its mouth enlarged and devoured five cadaveric crows in a go. Drips of impurities flowed down from the chin of the Nether Skull.

“No matter how many cadaveric crows there are, they are simply nutrients for the Nether Skull!”

Wang Xian smiled faintly. Behind him, Mo Yuan and twenty-seven dragonians had also walked over.

Ga ga ga!

The deeper they went, the more cadaveric crows flew towards them. Their calls were sharp and shrouded towards Wang Xian and the group in a huge flock.

Wang Xian waved his arm and a stream of fire dragon energy was injected into the Nether Skull.

Weng! Ka ka ka!

The head of the Nether Skull expanded explosively to over a meter in size.

Will-o’-wisps flickered in the giant eye sockets and the terrifying mouth crunched on the huge flock of cadaveric crows.

Each cadaveric crow that entered the mouth of the Nether Skull was transformed into dense will-o’-wisps. The cadaveric crows had become the nutrients for the Nether Skull instead.

The more will-o’-wisps are in the Nether Skull, the larger it can expand. That Deity Lady from Nether Flame killed several people before the battle to absorb their bones and create more will-o’-wisps!

Seeing the incomparably huge skull, Wang Xian showed a faint smile.

As it was a Level 12 Spiritual Weapon, he wouldn’t have to control it while it was devouring the cadaveric crows. Instinctively, it could attack on its own.

Ga ga ga!

After walking approximately a thousand meters forward, a flock of at least a thousand cadaveric crows appeared before them.

In the middle, there was a cadaveric crow that spanned two meters long. It opened up its wings and its black bones were exposed at the back.

It was emitting a deathly aura and there was even a piece of flesh still dangling below its beak.

“It would seem like we are nearing the base of the Remains!”

Wang Xian looked ahead and saw a creepy and terrifying small village ahead of him.

There was a small stream before the village and several stone huts.

In the middle, there was a huge structure that resembled a platform for sacrificial rituals.

At night, every stone hut and structure had two basins of flames at the door.

Will-o’-wisps burned creepily within the fire basins.

In front of some stone huts, there were several human figures. They looked stiff and had no emotions on their faces.

“Intruders!”

“Who dares to step into the Remains’ territory!”

“Hehe. It doesn’t matter. If he can make it here, he must be pretty strong and he will make a powerful bone puppet!”

A sharp voice resounded and figure after figure rushed to the spot from all directions.

Rattle rattle rattle!

At this moment, the sound of wings flapping could be heard from the sky.

Wang Xian lifted his head and looked into the sky.

On a huge tree, a terrifying cadaveric crow with a human head was flying towards him.

The human head had the looks of an exceptionally good-looking young man. However, his eyes were blood-red and he had the body of a cadaveric crow.

On the cadaveric crow, there was a young girl that looked like she was just seventeen to eighteen years old.

She wore bright and revealing red clothes that exposed most parts of her body.

A blue and red light flashed in Wang Xian’s eyes. He realized that the girl was, in fact, a hunchback old man. He was staring harshly at Wang Xian and looked extremely creepy.

Looking across the dozen-odd figures, Wang Xian found that they were all handsome or beautiful guys and girls.

There were at least one or even two bone puppets standing beside them.

A pungent stench of blood was emitted from their bodies. There were five humans and together with their bone puppets, there were thirteen.

Seeing Wang Xian and the group, they raised their eyebrows in confusion and stood in a line.

In the air, the hunchback old man stood on the cadaveric crow with a human head and was looking down at Wang Xian and the group.

“Who are you? How dare you kill the cadaveric crows of our Remains and barge into the lands of our Remains!”

When the hunchback old man on the cadaveric crow saw the huge skull above Wang Xian, he questioned him solemnly.

“Dragon King of the Dragon Sect!”

Wang Xian looked across them and killing intent flashed across his eyes. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Dragon King from Dragon Sect?”

The crowd was taken aback and turned solemn.

As the guards of the base of the Remains, they had gathered news on the happenings in the Underworld while they were on duty.

The Dragon King of the Dragon Sect was now the second strongest unparalleled expert in the Underworld.

“What? Are you here to collaborate with us? Where are the three disciples of our Remains?”

The hunchback old man standing on the cadaveric crow had just glanced through the thread on the Underworld website. He squinted his eyes and focused on the Nether Skull above Wang Xian’s head while asking him.

“Collaboration?”

Wang Xian was taken aback but soon revealed a smirk. “The disciples from the Remains? Let me send you guys to meet them!”

Wang Xian waved his arm and a stream of will-o’-wisps shot out from the Nether Skull instantly towards the hunchback old man on the cadaveric crow.

“They are enemies! We are under attack!” the hunchback old man shouted loudly upon seeing Wang Xian attacking suddenly.

“Kill! Today, I’m here to annihilate the Remains!” Wang Xian ordered.

Mo Yuan and the dragonians behind Wang Xian instantly sprang into action.

When the hunchback old man saw the will-o’-wisps crashing into him, he could feel the strength of it as his expression changed substantially.

He moved his arms and the cadaveric crow with a human head below him shielded him immediately.

Ga ga!

The cadaveric crow cried out loud and fell onto the ground directly.

“What?”

The hunchback old man was furious and drew an ivory dagger instantly. “Retreat! We are under attack from the Dragon Sect! We are under attack from the Dragon King! Inform Lord Ossein!”

The hunchback old man shouted in his sharp voice which instantly reached the entire base of the Remains!

“Run!”

When the other five experts from Remains saw the strength Mo Yuan and the group released instantly, they were horrified and retreated immediately.

“Will you be able to escape? Today, I, Wang Xian, shall enforce justice on behalf of Heaven!”

Wang Xian waved his arm and dense fire dragon energy was injected into the Nether Skull.

The Nether Skull exploded in size and reached over two meters. At the same time, it started devouring the members of the Remains at an astonishing speed.
