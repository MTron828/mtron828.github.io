Chapter 1316: 1317 attacked without restraint

“Hiss!” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Wang Xian looked at the five elements millstone that was two kilometers in circumference above his head. A look of shock appeared on his face.

The entire five elements millstone was like the controller of this piece of sky.

Golden Yellow, Wood Green, aqua blue, fiery red, and earthy yellow.

There were five colors. Each of the attributes took up one-fifth of the space. Above the attributes, there was an attribute dragon.

Looking at the five elements millstone, Wang Xian couldn’t help but suck in a breath of cold air.

His heart skipped a beat. On the Five Elements Millstone, the divine dragon galloped and the five elements millstone began to revolve slowly.

Buzz

A strong life force was transmitted over. The strong life force made Wang Xian’s spirit jolt.

Following that, he waved his arm and a destructive aura was suddenly transmitted over.

Below, the demon soul was lying on the ground, trembling. His eyes were filled with despair as he looked at the five elements millstone in the sky.

He was powerless to resist it. With the strength of the demon soul at the second level of the void interpretation stage, he didn’t have the qualifications to resist it at all.

“Hu!”

After using the five elements millstone briefly, the corner of Wang Xian’s mouth curled up slightly.

The Five Elements Millstone was both a divine ability and a divine artifact.

The origin of the five elements grindstone came from the Five Elements Dragon Pearl and the five elements origin.

Now that he had used it, he could easily control the five elements. With the five elements grindstone, he could destroy and heal.

With Wang Xian’s current strength, it was no exaggeration to say that he could kill a level four Seethrough expert. As for a level five Seethrough expert, he should be able to escape from him or even fight against him.

“I’m still short of 100 million dragon crystals to level up. As long as I level up, I can kill a powerhouse at level five of the Seethrough realm. In the entire Liuhai region, only the blood flow empire and the leader of the Heavenly Sword sect are not a match for me!”

Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled. With a move of his body, he transformed into a human form.

With a wave of his arm, the five elemental grindstone in a radius of two kilometers in the sky shrunk and turned into a size of 10 meters that floated in the sky.

The shrinking of its form did not affect the terrifying power of the five elements millstone.

Wang Xian looked at the five elements millstone and thought of something.

Buzz Buzz

The entire five elements millstone began to rotate slowly and finally formed a five elements crown.

There were five divine dragons on the crown and it looked majestic.

“Not bad, not bad!”

Wang Xian froze on top of his head. With a flick of his arm, a water mirror appeared in front of him. He looked at himself on it and revealed a smile.

“I have to consume all the spiritual liquid in the interspatial ring!”

Wang Xian opened the space and consumed all the spiritual liquid and blood essence obtained from killing the first level Seethrough expert of the Frost sect and two demonic beasts.

However, even so, he was still short of about 80 million dragon crystals to upgrade his level.

“Next, there are two ways to increase my strength quickly. One is to kill and loot, and the other is to ascend to a higher main hall!”

There was nothing easier than killing and looting to accumulate resources. Even if one climbed up to the higher main hall, it might not be as fast as killing and looting.

“Let’s go and see if the two guys from cold sect who ambushed me are still around!”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and looked at the demon soul lying on the ground. “Let’s go, let’s go out!”

“Yes, King!”

The demon soul nodded its head in awe. It immediately got up and lowered its head.

Wang Xian flew directly to the demon soul and sat on it.

“Roar!”

The Demon Soul let out a soft roar and flew out.

Riding on a demon Qilin Demon Beast at the second level of the void interpretation stage, he wore a crown that was transformed by the five elements grinding and a black robe.

Coupled with the mysterious mask, Wang Xian was like the King of darkness.

When he was in the main hall, Wang Xian was a little apprehensive of other top-notch experts. Now, as long as he did not encounter a terrifying existence at level six of the Seethrough realm, he could escape even if he could not defeat the others.

Therefore, he did not have any fear.

The Demon Soul rushed out from the room and flew out directly.

It was unrestrained and did not hide anything!

“Roar!”

Sensing the invincible aura from Wang Xian, the Demon Soul Roared and flew towards the main hall.

“That is? It’s the traitor, the demon soul. The nameless sword demon of the human race is on him. It’s them!”

“Damn their judgment. How dare they come to US so arrogantly!”

“Go, kill him!”

The Demon Soul’s roar attracted the attention of the surrounding four to five demon beasts. When they saw Wang Xian and the demon soul, their eyes revealed a cold killing intent.

The betrayal of the demon soul had caused many demon beasts to lose face and wanted to kill them.

Now that they saw the demon soul and the nameless sword demon, they naturally wouldn’t let them off.

“Kill!”

Four Demon Beasts of the second level of the Seethrough realm and one of the first level of the Seethrough realm attacked them directly.

Wang Xian turned his head and looked over. His eyes were flashing with a cold expression.

“Five elements grinding, crushing!”

He snorted lightly and the crown on his head flew out. In an instant, it turned into a thousand-meter-wide five elements grinding.

Buzz

A special sound rang out. It was like the gears of history turning. A five-colored light enveloped it.

On it, the five divine dragons were slowly pulling the grinding disc.

It was operating!

Death!

“Ahhhhh!”

A miserable scream rang out. From the five elements grinding to crushing, it only took an instant.

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered. The five elements millstone shrank and flew directly to the top of his head, turning into a crown.

“The five elements millstone is operating. All creatures below the five elements millstone will either resist the attacks of the five types of energy or die immediately!”

He looked at the demonic beast that was killed instantly and revealed a hint of a smile in his eyes.

Just now, it was just a little operation of the Five Elements Millstone. If he were to use the power that countered the five elements at full force, it would create a destructive domain below the five elements millstone.

If he didn’t have sufficient strength in that domain, he would definitely die.

In the future, his opponent would only be able to fight against Wang Xian if he could withstand the attacks of the five elements grindstone.

“Let’s Go!”

After killing the five demonic beasts in an instant, Wang Xian’s expression didn’t change at all. He looked at the Demonic Beasts’interspatial ring and swallowed the spiritual essence and blood directly.

He had gained another ten million dragon crystals. He was getting closer and closer to leveling up.

“I have stayed in the land of five elements for more than six months. I wonder if the few people from the cold sect are still around!”

Wang Xian sat on the demon soul and raised his head slightly. He looked at the entrance.

Boom

The Demon Soul dashed forward. It did not hold back in the dangerous main hall. It charged into the main hall through the entrance with a huge force.

The Demon Soul charged into the main hall in such a high-profile manner, instantly attracting the attention of the demonic beasts and humans.

“Eh? It’s the Nameless Sword Demon!”

“It’s the demon soul. It’s the traitor, Demon Soul!”

The Demon Soul charged into the center of the first level of the main hall. Some humans and demonic beasts immediately recognized it.

Wang Xian sat on the demon soul and looked down at all the humans and demonic beasts around him.

“Are you still there?”

He looked at the position of Han Zong. The two second level insightful emptiness realm experts were sitting cross-legged in the formation and cultivating.

Compared to the two of them, there were seven to eight more people beside them. Among them, there were six young men and middle-aged men who had yet to reach the insightful emptiness realm.
