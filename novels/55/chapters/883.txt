Chapter 884: 0885 breakthrough

Translator: 549690339

Burning the river and boiling the sea.

It was a direct attack from the very beginning.

Now, with Wang Xian’s strength, it was easy for him to exterminate a level two extraordinary.

Back then, when he was fighting against the leader of the Holy Glory mercenary group who was at level four extraordinary, the two of them combined and killed him directly.

Now that there was a group of level two extraordinary individuals, Wang Xian did not hold back at all.

He felt a little aggrieved these two days!

“Boom!”

Terrifying Flames erupted directly. The flames within a radius of a thousand meters instantly attacked the burly young man and the rest.

Behind them, the group of DRAKONIDS also erupted with their superpowers.

When the thirteen people who were prepared to besiege them saw Wang Xian’s attack, their expressions changed drastically.

“AH, not good. The opponent is very strong!”

The young man who was the first to be hit by the Flames had a drastic change in expression as he roared loudly.

“Hehe, all of you can go to hell!”

The eight DRAKONIDS slashed out with their swords and sabers.

“Shield!”

The face of the burly young man in the middle changed slightly. He moved his body and a shield appeared in his hand. A powerful Earth attribute divine ability covered his entire body, turning him into a three-meter-long aborigine.

“Ah!”

However, the three people at the front were unable to withstand Wang Xian’s fire attack. Their bodies were instantly covered in flames.

“Not good!”

Fear appeared in the eyes of the burly young man. He shouted in a hurry, “Brother, why are you attacking us?”

“Hehe!”

Wang Xian laughed mockingly. His eyes sparkled as he attacked the burly young man without stopping.

Boom

Wang Xian arrived in front of him. The fire dragon bead appeared in his hand and swept across the surroundings.

“What?”

When his gaze landed on the young man’s shield, it started to burn rapidly. His body moved and a large amount of earth energy churned in an attempt to extinguish the flames. However, it had no effect at all.

At the side, the other nine people in the burning river boiling sea were instantly hit by the dragon bead and the eight drakonids.

The terrifying power of the flames, coupled with the full strength of the dragonmen, landed on them.

The group of dragonmen were at the second level of the extraordinary realm and were almost invincible in the same realm. The Burning River boiled sea already had the power to kill those at the second level of the extraordinary realm.

After two terrifying attacks, the nine people didn’t have the ability to resist at all.

“No, don’t kill us. We have no enmity with you. Don’t!”

“Hong!”

You can kill us without enmity?

A metallic blade of light with a terrifying blade light directly cut through the middle.

“This strength, how can it be so strong...”

The burly youth in the center who was covered in endless flames had a horrified expression.

They were clearly just a 1-star bronze mercenary group, they had never even heard of their names.

How could they have such terrifying strength?

“Flames, the flames on their bodies!”

His face revealed a terrified expression as he looked around.

However, he discovered that the closest one to them was a few kilometers away. As for Ao Xue bei Ming and the others, they had no idea where they were going!

With an ugly expression, he directly jumped into the ocean beside him.

“Peng!”

After entering the ocean, what frightened him was that the flames did not dissipate. Instead, they were burning intensely.

They could not be extinguished. They could not be extinguished at all!

“If you want to kill me, let me kill you first. Then, I will look for them!”

A cold voice was heard. The burly young man widened his eyes and revealed a terrified expression.

“PFFT!”

At this moment, the ice-cold water sword pierced through his body and kept him into his interspatial ring.

“Dragon King, we’ve dealt with all of them!”

When Wang Xian flew up, the group of DRAKONIDS said respectfully.

“Put the corpse away. Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian said to them.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

The corpse of an expert could be absorbed by the Dragon Cave. After being absorbed, it could strengthen the strength of the members of the Dragon Palace.

A corpse of a level 2 supernatural realm could definitely create a level 1 supernatural realm member of the Dragon Palace.

“I’ll go and hunt the big-mouthed piranhas. As long as I don’t run into any level 5 supernatural realm piranhas, I’ll be able to deal with them easily!”

“The assessment? I wonder what benefits I’ll get if I kill too many of them!”

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered as he stared at the huge island in front of him. This was a good place for him to level up.

“It’s good to be a mercenary group. If I accept some ocean missions, I’ll be able to understand the basic situation of this sea area. This place should be safer as the assessment ground for the Demon Hunters Academy!”

Wang Xian moved his body and dashed forward.

The scale rocks on the island were uneven. There were also some seaweed and vines growing on them. Some of the seaweed was as tall as five to six meters and was densely packed.

“Dragon King, the big-mouthed piranha has a huge mouth and is of the Earth attribute. It doesn’t store much oxygen. Therefore, they can’t stay at the bottom of the sea. They like to hide and attack the enemy when they are caught off guard!”

Long Yi introduced to Wang Xian.

He nodded his head and his eyes flashed with a red and blue glow.

The earth attribute was relatively strong in terms of concealment. This place was called the Mermaid Island and there were many piranhas.

The Jade Glue in the piranhas was an important ingredient to refine a kind of medicinal pill. It was good for the skin if consumed directly and was loved by the ladies. The price was not low.

Wang Xian’s gaze swept forward and moved quickly.

Eight drakonids followed from left to right as they watched their surroundings vigilantly.

Extractable Dragon Energy: 2 Dragon Crystals

When a piece of information appeared in his mind, Wang Xian revealed a smile.

With the penetrating eye and the system, he could perfectly scan all the hidden creatures around him.

Wang Xian moved his body and looked at the two big-mouthed piranhas in front of him.

They had a huge head that was two meters in size. The mouth took up half of the head and had incomparably dense teeth.

They looked extremely terrifying.

They were hidden in the grass and there was a hole below where they could enter the seabed directly.

“Earth Conquers Wood!”

The corners of Wang Xian’s mouth curled up slightly as he began to hunt.

“Bind!”

A gush of azure dragon aura emanated from his body. The azure dragon bead appeared in his hand and attacked the two piranhas from the ground.

The surroundings were filled with seaweed. It was the perfect terrain for wood attribute cultivators.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

In an instant, the dense seaweed became thicker and longer, binding the two large-mouthed piranhas!

Crack! Crack

The green dragon bead flew above the two big-mouthed piranhas and transformed into two green dragon claws that landed on their heads.

The dense wooden thorns entered the piranhas’bodies and killed them.

Wang Xian opened his mouth and transformed into a dragon in an instant, devouring them!

“Ding! Devouring the big-mouthed piranhas has increased by 0.2 draconic crystals!”

“Ding! Devouring the big-mouthed piranhas has increased by 2 draconic crystals!”

“Alright, there are still more than ten levels of dragonglass left for me to level up. I’ll level up first. The assessment will be a piece of cake!”

“The Celestial Phoenix mercenary group will soon be able to shake the entire region!”

Wang Xian’s face was filled with confidence.

With the eye of penetration and the system, he could easily scan demonic beasts. After devouring them, he could rapidly increase his cultivation level.

The corpses of demonic beasts could also increase the strength of the members of the Dragon Palace. Very soon, he would be able to build a powerful mercenary group and start to devour the ocean!
