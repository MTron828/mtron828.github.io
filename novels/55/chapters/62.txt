Chapter 63: The Five Elements Stone Plate

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

Bam!

An old man who was soaked in blood fell on the road in front of him.

Cough.

The old man looked up. With a pale-looking face, he looked towards the trees and bushes at the roadside with a despairing expression.

“Mo Qinglong, you can’t run away. Hand over the thing now, and I’ll let you have a peaceful death.”

Soon after, an angry bellow was heard, Wang Xian saw eight men rushing towards his side.

They were like the martial arts experts on the television who leaped onto the tree branch and landed on the road in front of him.

The eight of them were dressed uniformly in black costumes. The swords in their hands were flickering with cold radiance under the moonlight.

A middle-aged man in the center stepped forward and glared coldly at the elder on the ground.

“Green Lotus Ancient Sect, the so-called decent sect, stooped to using despicable and shameless resorts just to steal the treasure from the Ancient Fiend Clan.” The old man stood up slowly with hideous expressions on his face.

“Haha, the Ancient Fiend Clan has always been up to no good. We are going to uproot your clan and finish off all the assassins that the clan has cultivated. We’re doing this for the good of the people. Mo Qinglong, don’t ever think of escaping today. Hand over the Five Elements Stone Plate now.” The middle-aged man in the center was glaring at the old man with immense killing intent. He stared at the chest area of the old man with greed in his eyes.

“Unless you kill me, you bunch of hypocrites will never ever get it.” The old man was covered in blood with numerous cuts on his body.

His clothes were getting soaked in his fresh blood.

“Then we’ll kill you.” The middle-aged man in the center had an impassive look. He looked towards both sides and commanded, “Kill him. We must get the Five Elements Stone Plate.”

“Kill!” The rest of the seven members nodded and launched swift attacks at the old man.

One of them suddenly looked up and fixed his gaze on the spot where Wang Xian was.

“Count yourself unlucky today.” As he spoke, he flung his arm and hurled a dagger at Wang Xian.

Without looking at him, the man turned to attack the old man.

In his opinion, Wang Xian could be considered a dead man.

It was an unexpected misfortune to any commoners. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Wang Xian was about to take his leave when he saw what happened. But his eyes could not help but narrow when he saw the dagger flying towards him.

How tyranical of them. I’m just a passer-by.

Wang Xian squinted his eyes as he looked at the incoming dagger. He stretched his arm out.

Piak!

The dagger was easily grasped by Wang Xian.

Back in the fight, the old man was besieged by eight people, and soon, he took another two slashes on his body.

The old man’s strength should be around Level Eight, and only the middle-aged leader is on par with him. The remaining Martial Artists are all at Level Seven.

Radiance flickered in Wang Xian’s eyes. He got down from his Harley motorcycle slowly and gazed at the eight people with a cold look.

“If it were not for you who wanting to kill me, I would have never interfered in this. But now, it’s a good chance for me to test my skill.”

Wang Xian curled his fingers into a fist. He was wearing his helmet, but he was not afraid that someone would recognize him.

Ka Ka Ka!

The dagger in his hand was crunched into a ball and discarded on the floor.

“I’m just a passer-by, yet, you guys wanted to silence me. Fine. If that’s the case, let’s have some fun.”

Wang Xian moved as he talked. He sprang into action and attacked the closest middle-aged man.

“Courting your own death. Qingwen and Qinglie, kill him!” The middle-aged leader was looking cold as he commanded loudly after Wang Xian dodged the dagger and attacked them.

“Lad, never did I expect that you’re a Martial Artist too. However, you are bound to die today!” The two middle-aged men, Qingwen and Qinglie, took themselves out from the joint attack of the old man and looked towards Wang Xian. Immediately, they made a counterattack.

“Heh heh!”

There was only coldness in Wang Xian’s eyes. Even though he had a good temper, his killing intent was triggered when he met a bunch of people who wanted to kill him without any reason.

The two middle-aged men wielded their sharp and long swords at his chest and throat.

“Have a taste of my physical power!”

The Dragon Energy in Wang Xian’s body surged. He stretched out both his hands and grabbed the two sharp swords.

“Die!” The two men looked at him disdainfully as they spun the long swords in their hands. “Go to hell.”

Piak Piak!

However, what shocked them was both swords were caught, and their attacks were stopped.

Ka Ka Ka!

“Oh no!”

Their eyes were filled with disbelief as they noticed the long swords in their hands were giving way.

“Die!”

Wang Xian hurled himself forward and attacked one of the middle-aged men.

He had not learned any martial arts before and had little experience in real-life combat. However, the power and speed of the Divine Dragon were insurmountable.

He held his fist tightly. With his mighty strength, he swung his fist at the middle-aged man who was looking shocked and horrified. He wielded his sword across his chest for defense.

Ka!

The sword broke when the sound was heard. The domineering force struck onto the chest of the middle-aged man.

Bam! The middle-aged man felt as though his chest had exploded. His eyes were protruding out as he stared at Wang Xian with disbelief.

“Damm, we met an expert!” The other man who witnessed the instant death of Qinglie was horrified. Hence, he quickly called out.

“Didn’t you guys say you were going to kill me?” Wang Xian lifted his head and stared ferociously at that middle-aged man. Like a raging beast, he struck an attack with brutal force.

“Green Lotus Sword Dance!”

That middle-aged man was horrified to see Wang Xian charging at him like a raging beast. He wielded the long sword in his hand, and an image of a green lotus appeared before him.

The green lotus was carrying a bone-chilling cold radiance with it.

“Fancy but impractical.”

Despite seeing the Green Lotus Sword formation, Wang Xian did not have the slightest hesitation. He continued punching his fist out.

Ka Ka Ka!

When the sleeves on Wang Xian’s arm were torn, it sounded like shattering glasses.

Blood traces could be seen on his arm, but they recovered almost instantly because of the mighty Divine Dragon’s body.

“No...” When the middle-aged man let out a devastating scream, Wang Xian’s fist already landed on his chest. Immediately, his chest sank in, and he collapsed on the floor.

“Damm, Qingwen and Qinglie got killed!”

The devastating screams from Qingwen and Qinglie drew shocking exclamations of those middle-aged men who were attacking the old man as they watched in disbelief.

Initially, they thought they killed an ordinary passer-by just to conceal the secret. But no one expected that he was a formidable Martial Artist who killed two Level-seven Martial Artists instantly.

Level-seven Martial Artists were experts who could establish an Ancient Martial Artist Family in this world.

“I was only passing through this place, and yet, you guys wanted to kill me. Then don’t blame me for it. Let’s see who will win today!”

Wang Xian stared at the remaining six people. All he wanted was to fight.

He wanted to find out how strong he was now!
