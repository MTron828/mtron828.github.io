Chapter 1557: 1,557 skyfiends appear 3

At the front of the Black Curtain Garden’s Gate, a group of powerful people had already left.

There were only four to five thousand black-robed people in front of them.

They were all factions below first-rate forces.

Don’t underestimate these people. The entire vast region was incomparably vast. There were three super forces and eight first-rate forces.

These eleven forces only occupied one-fifth of the vast region.

The other four-fifths of the region also had hidden dragons and crouching tigers. This was especially true near the God nation ruins. There were many mysterious organizations.

Many organizations existed to occupy the entire God nation ruins.

Some hidden organizations might not be weaker than some first-rate forces.

Of course, there was still a huge gap between them and the three super forces.

Ling Jian ‘er was floating at the entrance by herself. She was very eye-catching. She scanned the area in front of her warily and flew towards the outside without saying a word.

Wang Xian, who was hiding in the air, also glanced at the positions of the first-rate super forces that had left curiously.

Black Water Divine Lake? Tree of God? It seems that all these superpowers have gone there? Perhaps only in the last few days will there be experts coming to protect their disciples

Wang Xian thought to himself.

The black curtain garden had been in operation for a month. It had only been half a month since then. The people from the first-rate and superpowers would basically stay in the black curtain garden for about a month.

If Ling Jian ‘Er hadn’t suddenly obtained three sword heart grass at the eighth level of the profound void tier, she wouldn’t have come out earlier.

“Buzz, Buzz, Buzz!”

Just as Ling Jian ‘er was about to leave this place, another thirty to forty people appeared at the entrance of the Black Curtain Garden.

Their eyes scanned the surroundings and immediately locked onto Ling Jian ‘ER who was in the air.

“Master, capture that woman from the Bingxin Empire!”

A middle-aged man dressed in a black robe immediately pointed at Ling Jian ‘er and shouted loudly.

“Huh?”

Everyone was attracted to the spot in front of them.

More than a dozen of them flew over with a hint of doubt on their faces. “What’s the situation? Speak!”

When Ling Jian ‘er heard the voice from behind, her expression changed drastically. She immediately used all her speed and fled forward.

Wang Xian frowned slightly. He had a bad premonition.

“Master, we can’t let her escape. She has a treasure in her hands!”

The middle-aged man said anxiously. However, he didn’t dare to say that the other party had three spiritual herbs of the eighth level of the Seethrough Void.

Once he said it out loud, a group of powerhouses in front would swarm forward.

“Elder, stop her. She has obtained a few top-grade spiritual herbs in the black screen garden!”

Another team hurriedly shouted at their elders.

“Top-grade spirit herbs?”

Everyone was slightly shocked and immediately looked towards Ling Jian ‘ER’s figure.

“The people from the Bingxin Empire... TSK Tsk, their experts aren’t here. I Won’t be polite anymore!”

A sinister voice suddenly sounded out. Following that, a figure rushed out and chased after Ling Jian ‘er.

“Go, the icy heart empire is domineering. Since their disciples have spiritual herbs, we will accept them with a smile. Haha!” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

In less than a second, three more figures flew over.

“TSK tsk, what a beautiful young lady!”

“Boom Boom Boom!”

Another dozen figures directly chased after Ling Jian ‘er.

One figure after another, several of them emitting terrifying demonic qi.

Seventh level void interpretation, a terrifying seventh level void interpretation expert.

“Damn it, those are our things!”

The faces of the elders of the two teams revealed a cold expression, and with a gloomy expression, they directly chased after them.

Top-grade spiritual herbs, the top-grade spiritual herbs of the black screen garden were eighth level void interpretation!

A few eighth level void interpretation spiritual herbs, even if they were seventh level void interpretation experts, were extremely tempted.

Spiritual herbs of this level were of great use to them.

Especially for those experts who didn’t have much lifespan and were desperately seeking to break through, the seventh level of the profound void tier medicinal pill was a treasure of a higher level.

In an instant, more than seventy figures chased after Ling Jian ‘er. Among them, more than twenty figures were emitting a majestic energy from their bodies.

It was extremely terrifying!

Ling Jian ‘ER’s speed was very fast and she managed to escape about a minute ahead of time.

However, the people who were chasing after her were a group of experts who could be considered strong even in the vast continent.

When Wang Xian saw this scene, he cursed in his heart and his expression turned slightly gloomy.

If he had known this would happen, he would have killed all the people who were chasing after Ling Jian ‘er!

“If you want to escape, come over here!”

At this moment, an elder at the front waved his arm and a devil whip shot towards Ling Jian ‘ER.

“This is the prey our disciple has discovered. Everyone, you have crossed the line!”

An elder waved his arm and a golden sword slashed towards the Devil Whip.

“What prey? Whoever catches it will get it!”

The old man who waved the devil whip saw that his attack had been cut off, and his face was cold with a trace of killing intent.

“I only want one top-grade spirit herb!”

A few figures from behind rushed over and grabbed towards Ling Jian ‘er.

“Peng Peng Peng!”

However, their attacks were immediately blocked.

“Young lady in front, Stop Right Now!”

With a shout, Ling Jian ‘ER’s expression changed drastically, and she hurriedly stopped.

“Seniors, I am willing to give all of the sword heart grass that I have obtained to all of you!”

Ling Jian ‘ER’s expression was filled with fear as she felt the terrifying attacks behind her. She hurriedly took out the sword heart grass and shouted.

“Sword Heart Grass, a sword heart grass of the eighth level of the profound void tier, and there are three of them!”

When the black-robed men saw the three sword heart grass in Ling Jian ‘ER’s hand, their eyes shone with a fiery light.

A spiritual grass of the eighth level of the profound void tier was a treasure.

Ling Jian ‘er glanced at the black-robed men around her in fear. “Seniors, please spare my life for the sake of the Iceheart dynasty!”

She had no choice but to bring up the Iceheart dynasty, hoping that the other party would be more cautious.

“If you don’t say that you’re from the Bingxin dynasty, I might let you off. Now, I’m going to Crush You!”

However, just as Ling Jian ‘ER finished speaking, an aged voice sounded out, and a terrifying killing intent directly charged towards her.

This caused her face to instantly turn pale, and her gaze turned towards the old man in front of her who only had a pair of ice-cold eyes.

“He has a grudge with the icy heart empire!”

Ling Jian ‘ER’s body trembled slightly as she looked at the group of terrifying experts surrounding her like a lamb waiting to be slaughtered.

“It’s not easy to divide the three spiritual herbs of the eighth level of the profound void tier. Treasures will belong to those who have the strength to snatch them!”

That old man swept his gaze across the surrounding people as he spoke in a sinister tone. Just as his voice faded, a pair of shriveled arms extended out from his black robe.

The shriveled arms were like demonic claws. The moment they reached Ling Jian ‘ER’s side, the terrifying demonic qi contained within would be able to tear them apart.

He did not care about Ling Jian ‘ER’s life at all.

Ling Jian ‘er looked at this attack and closed her eyes in despair. A figure suddenly appeared in her mind...

Would that person still save her?
