2705 2705 parasites and the venom

“Wang Xian, the two in front of us are the heavenly sword king and the one-armed saber.”

Everyone walked towards the center. The Empress saw two figures in the center and said to Wang Xian.

“Oh?”

Wang Xian looked over and saw an old man and a one-armed middle-aged man.

The old man looked ordinary and didn’t have any aura. His aura was restrained.

The other one-armed middle-aged man was holding a large saber in one arm. He stood there expressionlessly with a murderous aura emanating from his body.

It was easy for an expert of such a realm to recover his broken arm. He didn’t understand why he hadn’t recovered yet.

“They were invited by the imperial court and the Night Clan.”

Di Xingnu said in a low voice.

Wang Xian nodded slightly at the side. It was impossible for such an expert to come over without an invitation or inducement.

“Let’s stay here!”

At this moment, one of the Senior Sisters of the Imperial Star Lady stopped for a moment and spoke to them.

They stopped and the former Imperial Star Lady waved her arm. A message floated beside them.

A team formed by the seven Imperial Star Ladies of the imperial court. The Strongest Immortal King had a combat strength of level 8, Level 7 had eight, and level 6 had 15... Now that they were recruiting heroes, the strong ones could cooperate.

A slightly vulgar message floated in the air, but it was the same everywhere else.

Showing off the strength of his team to attract some strong ones to join.

Wang Xian scanned his surroundings and could see the teams formed by the imperial court’s strong ones recruiting their subordinates and partners in such a way.

The team formed by the Imperial Star Lady was considered to be one of the stronger ones.

The seven Imperial Star Ladies represented the strongest women in the seven eras of the imperial court.

Their arrival attracted the attention of many people.

“Star Lady, let Lili and the rest stay here. We will go around and look for some powerhouses to invite them to join us.”

One of the Imperial Star Ladies said to the Imperial Star Lady.

“Alright.”

Empress Star Lady nodded. A portion of them were waiting for some experts to come over while they took the initiative to recruit some.

Wang Xian followed by the side and looked around.

All kinds of experts from the Emperor Star Field had opened Wang Xian’s eyes.

“Everyone, are you interested in joining our team?”

Very soon, Empress Star Lady and the rest found a target. There were five of them. They were all at level five or six and were emitting an immortal king level aura.

Seeing the five of them, the Emperor Star Lady and the Emperor Lady went up to them and tried to recruit them.

Wang Xian took a look and continued to observe his surroundings.

“Eh? What is that?”

At this moment, Wang Xian was attracted by the group of Heaven Demons. These creatures should be considered as heaven demons.

The reason why they should be used was that the group of Heaven Demons was too strange.

They had black skin, human-shaped bodies, and blood-red eyes. They had a row of huge white teeth, and their mouths covered half of their heads.

Their bodies were three to four meters tall, and they weren’t very big.

Their bodies were like liquid.

What was most attractive about them was that they emitted a dense aura that seemed to corrode the space around them.

“This is the venom. It’s a very special race that lives in the Sea of poison. I didn’t expect that this race would come here.”

“This venom is a special race in the Emperor Star area. The venom on their bodies is poison. We can judge their strength based on the amount of poison. The more poison they absorb, the stronger they will be.”

“However, creatures like poison don’t seem to be too strong.”

Voices of conversation came from the side.

“Poison? Aquatic Creatures?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows. He was filled with curiosity towards these aquatic creatures.

“HMM?”

Suddenly, Wang Xian’s gaze landed behind the group of poison.

There were more than fifty of them. At the last position, there was a relatively short one.

His body was only the size of an ordinary human, less than two meters. However, his body was darker and emitted a corrosive smell.

The smell on his body was slightly unpleasant. Furthermore, he was five meters away from the rest of the poisonous liquid. With every step he took, there would be a mark under his feet, a mark of corrosion.

What attracted Wang Xian was the position in front of his chest. There was something strange on his chest. Unlike the other poisonous liquid, there was nothing special in front of the other poisonous liquid. On his chest, there was a body that looked like the tail of an insect.

This body that looked like the tail of an insect suddenly grew in front of his chest. It looked very strange.

However, the body with half of the tail gave Wang Xian a very familiar feeling. There was even a strong attraction.

This caused his eyes to sparkle.

“What an unexpected surprise.”

He raised his eyebrows and walked directly towards the group of Venom.

“Huh?”

Just as Wang Xian was walking towards the group of Venom, a young man not far away was staring at di Xing Nu. At the same time, he saw Wang Xian walking towards the group of Venom.

“Have you found out anything about him yet?”

The young man, Ye Shaohuang, frowned and asked a middle-aged man beside him in a deep voice.

“Young master, we haven’t found out anything yet. He shouldn’t be from the imperial court. We...”

“Trash!”

The middle-aged man said. Ye Shaohuang interrupted him and said coldly.

“Is he trying to recruit the Venom Tribe?”

Ye Shaohuang raised his eyebrows slightly when he saw Wang Xian walking in front of the Venom tribe.

“Young master, the Venom tribe is too toxic. They will hurt their companions accidentally when they fight. Usually, no powerhouse would be willing to fight alongside them.”

...

The middle-aged man beside him said.

“Let’s go.”

The corner of his mouth curled up slightly. He took a glance at the Empress Star and turned toward the group of Venom.

...

“Everyone.”

In front of the group of Venom, Wang Xian walked forward. His gaze shifted from the special venom to the leader of the venom.

“HMM? You are a disciple of the imperial court? If you want to recruit us, please call us the powerhouses of the imperial court.”

When the leader of the venom saw Wang Xian walking in front of them, he spoke very directly.

“I’m not a disciple of the imperial court.”

Wang Xian shook his head and waved his arm gently. A wave of energy stirred up the black liquid on his body.

The leader of the Venom’s expression changed slightly. A look of fear appeared in his eyes.

“Sir, may I know who you are?”

The leader of the Venom immediately asked respectfully.

“I’m here to recruit all of you.”

Wang Xian looked at them and glanced at the special venom at the back.

“HMM?”

The leader of the venom was slightly taken aback.

“The night clan also wishes to recruit all of you from the Venom.”

At this moment, a voice came from the side.

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and looked to the side. When he saw the young man, a smile appeared on his face.

“Ye clan.”

The leader of the venom was slightly shocked. He sized up young Emperor Ye.

“Our young master is called Young Emperor Ye. It’s your honor to be able to recruit you.”

A middle-aged man behind young Emperor Ye said faintly.

Young Emperor Ye who was standing in front raised his head slightly. There was a hint of arrogance on his face.
