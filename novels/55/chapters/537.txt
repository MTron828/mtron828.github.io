Chapter 538: A Real Man Faces A Strong Opponent Directly (3)

“It has been fifty years! Our Diabolism has lived in seclusion for fifty years! Now that we have returned, we will definitely rule the Underworld!”

Amidst the towering mountain range and below the majestic tallest peak of Huashan, Emperor Qi stood in the air and spoke plainly.

Emperor Qi’s voice instantly turned the attention of the crowd from the Dragon Sect as the crowd turned to look at the leader of Diabolism with great excitement.

“Fifty years ago, I, Nie Wushuang, could suppress your Diabolism. Today, I will still be able to do so. The Underworld is still going to be our Underworld!”

Nie Wushuang lifted his head slightly and an intense battle will emitted from his body.

“Great! Show it to me then! Will you be the king of the Underworld or will I declare myself the Emperor of the Underworld?”

Emperor Qi levitated upwards. A terrifying devilish aura was released from his body and the coffin behind him.

Dang dang dang!

Sounds of metal clashing rang out around Nie Wushuang. Violent metal attribute energy and intense golden rays were emitted from his body gradually.

Nie Wushuang also started to levitate into the sky.

They would be fighting at the highest peak of Huashan.

“Sss. Terrifying! Their auras are too terrifying. Is this the strength of a supreme expert? In the face of them, why do I feel that we are just ants!”

“Budding Realm! Is this the aura of a Budding Realm expert? It’s no surprise that they are looking down on the Dragon King. It’s all because they are so overwhelmingly powerful!”

“This is where a battle between supreme experts should be! At the tallest peak of Huashan!”

Everyone’s eyes were burning with frenzied passion as they stared fervently at the two figures.

If only I could reach this stage in the future. That would be the greatest thing ever!

Some experts couldn’t help but think that way.

“Will it be Nie Wushuang who continues to be the king or will Emperor Qi declare himself as the emperor? Everything will be based on today’s battle. The fate of the Underworld lies in the hands of these two supreme experts.”

Disciples from some Sacred Clans and Sects could feel themselves getting breathless as they stared fervently at the two supreme experts in the air.

“Nie Wushuang!”

“Emperor Qi!”

“My initial plan was to wait for both of you to suffer severe injuries before I crush both of you. Now, I’m just not fond of the two of you!

“Moreover, a real man should face a strong opponent directly and annihilate his strongest enemies!

“Haha, let me join you guys for some fun. Show me exactly who will be the one ruling the Underworld!

“If you wish to claim supremacy in the Underworld, you’ve got to ask if I, the Dragon King, will allow it!”

Suddenly, an exceptionally brazen and unruly voice reverberated through Huashan. A peal of frenzied laughter followed and pierced through the clouds.

Boom!

Boom!

A stream of flames shot into the clouds, filling the sky with fire.

A stream of golden rays fell from the sky as though a thousand-meter razor-sharp longsword hadpierced through the atmosphere and into the land.

Two terrifying auras erupted suddenly and reverberated through Huashan.

One rose from the ground while the other descended from heaven!

Argh!

Screams of horrors broke out suddenly. Those first-class forces and devil sects that were close to the Dragon Sect were screaming in horror.

They were petrified, their faces were as white as snow, and they were panting profusely.

“Powerful! How powerful! Supreme experts!”

“How can this be possible? How can this be possible? How can the Dragon King and his subordinates be so powerful?”

“Even the weather is changing! They must be supreme experts! The Dragon King and the middle-aged man beside him are both Budding Realm experts! This cannot be... This cannot be possible...!”

Insane! Insane!

Those who had witnessed the development would definitely feel that their world had been thrown into disarray.

They looked fearfully towards the column of flames and a golden longsword that reached the clouds and saw the Dragon King and the middle-aged man sustaining the release of energy.

“How can this be possible? Budding Realm experts and there are two of them! The Dragon King and the middle-aged man beside him are both Budding Realm experts!”

Cold sweat covered Nie Wuya’s forehead instantly as his lips turned a little pale.

Their enemies... Their opponents... The Dragon Sect which their sect leader had no regard for had two supreme experts.

Everyone in the Dong Hua Sacred Sect shivered in horror and felt as if their vision had dulled a little.

All the Sacred Clans and Sects of the Underworld swallowed their saliva and their eyes were filled with astonishment.

“Two supreme experts... With Dragon Sect’s strength, they probably could annihilate the alliance of orthodox sects or Diabolism easily!” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

The surrounding crowd felt extremely bitter.

They finally understood why the Dragon King could be so fearless and annihilate whoever he wished.

That was because they had the strength to support it.

So what if you were Dong Hua Sacred Sect?

If both parties fought with all their strength, they would probably be annihilated even if Nie Wushuang was around.

As for the Remains and the Crimson Bug, what the hell were they?

The only option was a mockery to their initial intention. That would be for the alliance of the orthodox sects to form a separate alliance with Diabolism to stand a chance against the Dragon Sect.

However, Diabolism and the alliance of the orthodox sects didn’t choose to do so after the Dragon King called out the two supreme experts directly.

Just as he had said, “A real man should face a strong expert directly and annihilate his strongest enemy!”

“Wow! He’s too cool! The Dragon King is too cool!”

Faraway, Xun’er was exhilarated after witnessing this. She started clapping and cheering loudly.

The lady beside her was dumbfounded. This time, she didn’t speak a word.

That was because there was nothing for her to say.

Everyone in Diabolism was stunned and couldn’t help but swallow their saliva.

“Luckily, the Dragon King isn’t part of the alliance of orthodox sects. Otherwise, I believe we would have to lie low for another fifty years!”

“What the hell! How can there be such a terrifying force in the Underworld!?”

Experts from Diabolism were scared out of their wits as they wiped away the sweat on their foreheads.

In the air, the eyes of Nie Wushuang and Emperor Qi, who were brimming with battle intent, subconsciously constricted. Their expressions had also sunk.

This was completely beyond their expectations.

A force which they had previously regarded as insignificant had two experts at the same level as them suddenly.

Feeling the battle intent from them, Nie Wushuang and Emperor Qi took a deep breath and looked extremely bitter.

A slap! An open slap in their faces.

“Fight!”

“Fight!”

Wang Xian shouted as his body was overwhelmed with battle intent. As he waved his arm, the fist-size Nether Skull grew larger as it flew into the sky.

Roving Sword also shouted coldly. He extended his right arm and pointed his longsword towards Nie Wushuang. The thousand-meter longsword was absorbed into it instantly.

Terrifying aura stifled the atmosphere instantly.

Nie Wushuang and Emperor Qi were extremely solemn. Seeing Wang Xian and Roving Sword attacking them separately, they took a deep breath.

“Who would have expected this? Dragon Sect? Great! Let’s fight!”

“Fight!”

Nie Wushuang pulled out the longsword from behind his back. In the process, sounds of the rings on it clashing with the metal body of the sword resounded.

Emperor Qi patted his back. The next moment, the black coffin appeared before him.

“Haha. Great! Come! Show me if the supreme experts from Dong Hua Sacred Sect and Diabolism can kill us as though we are ants!”

Wang Xian laughed hysterically. A dense stream of fire dragon energy was injected into the Nether Skull.

The close to six-meter Nether Skull raged violently in black will-o’-wisps instantly. Within the black flames, there were still red flames burning.
