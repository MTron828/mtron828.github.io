Chapter 2890: 2,890 dragon punishment 6

“Damn it, how can their Dragon Palace be so strong!”

“How can it be like this!”

The five great arrays collapsed one by one. The Wizard’s blood-red eyes stared at the Dragon Palace’s powerhouse who had rushed in, and his body trembled slightly.

Before the battle, he had a strong confidence that he could rely on the formation of the Wizard Association to defend this place.

With all the inheritance arrays activated, four or five rank two divine emperors could defend this place. However, they only lasted for two minutes.

This was a powerful suppression.

He knew that the Success Wizard Association was no match for the Dragon Palace. The Success Wizard Association was doomed!

“Wizard, our space has been sealed. We can’t escape back to the divine kingdom. Our space has been sealed!”

At this moment, a voice filled with fear and panic sounded again.

Tian Zi’s face was extremely pale as he scanned his surroundings. He was filled with panic.

At this moment, he had already lost his will to fight.

“How can the Dragon Palace be so powerful? !”

“Not good, Tiancheng divine emperor has set up a formation. We can’t escape in an instant!”

“Is that a real divine dragon? Is that a real divine dragon?”

On Wu Mountain, countless powerful disciples of the Witch Formation Association panicked when they saw the dragon palace breaking through their defenses. They roared in fear.

“Hehehe, you are the enemy of the Dragon Palace. Die!”

“Sky Array, do you want us to kill that disciple of yours for you?”

“Roar, Roar, Roar! The Dragon Palace is awesome! Kill them! Kill them!”

At this moment, the eight-limbed devilish baleful demons and invincible fighters shouted excitedly from the front.

“Continue attacking and kill them all!”

Prime Minister Turtle stood at the back and ordered loudly.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

“Wu Wu Wu!”

The Nine Divine Dragons continued to roar, and the terrifying draconic might directly pounced on them.

The wild aura of the Little Blue House also filled the entire witch mountain.

The end of the Witch Formation Association had arrived!

“Kill them, kill them!”

Seeing the experts of the Dragon Palace continue to attack, the Magi roared with bloodshot eyes.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

The disciples of the experts on Wu Mountain clenched their teeth and released their strongest attacks, covering everyone in the Dragon Palace.

“Peng! Peng! Peng!”

However, facing the attacks of the 24 divine emperors of the Dragon Palace, four of them were rank two divine emperors. Without the protection of the array formation, they were unable to resist.

Two wind divine dragons locked onto the monarch and the Magus.

The rest of the imperial court and the Formation Wizard Association’s Divine Emperors were instantly suppressed!

One of the wind divine dragons’wings flapped toward the Wizard Mountain below.

The entire wizard mountain collapsed instantly, and the experts of the formation Wizard Association on it were killed instantly.

A huge dragon claw swept past the Wizard Mountain, and the entire mountain collapsed instantly, turning into rubble.

Everyone on it was easily killed.

“Lord Magus, we can’t Stop It!”

A god Emperor of the Magus Union could not help but shout at the Magus.

“Break the formation, everyone escape!”

When the Magus heard this, his heart tightened, and he gritted his teeth as he shouted.

“Members of the rear, attack the formation, break this formation!”

The group of protectors immediately shouted at all the disciples.

“The Shaman Association has been defeated. They want to escape!”

“This isn’t a battle of the same level at all. This isn’t a one-sided massacre!”

“The Shaman Association is going to be finished this time. A faction that has stood for a billion years is going to be destroyed.”

“Divine Dragon, the Shaman Association has provoked the wrong person!”

When the powerhouses from the Heaven Magus region who were hiding in the surrounding void heard the orders filled with unwillingness, their hearts were slightly moved.

This was the strongest existence in their Heaven Magus region. Now, he had been destroyed by the Dragon Palace!

“You want to escape? Hehe, it’s a little too late!”

At this moment, Wang Xian, who was standing in front of the Dragon Throne, saw this scene. A cold smile appeared on his face.

The primaless sacred wings appeared on his back. He narrowed his eyes slightly.

Boom

In the next moment, their figures disappeared instantly.

“Ahhhhh!”

At this moment, screams of pain could be heard from the Wu Mountain. Facing so many divine emperors from the Dragon Palace, they had no way to resist at all.

“Dragon Palace, just you wait. Just you wait for us, the Wizard Association. One day, we will make you pay the price, the price of blood!”

Facing a wind god Dragon, the wizard’s body trembled as he controlled the purgatory world’s array diagram and roared sternly.

His voice was filled with endless rage.

His faction had been destroyed, and their blood feud would not end until one of them was dead.

“Magus, with just you, you want to destroy our Dragon Palace? You Reckless Thing!”

Right at this moment, a voice appeared beside his ear.

In an instant, the Magus’expression changed drastically, and his forehead was covered in cold sweat.

“Not good!”

His heart sank.

Buzz

The next moment, a death threat enveloped his entire body, causing his body to tighten.

Puff

However, before he could make a move, he felt a sharp claw piercing through his body.

Waves of destructive energy stirred in his body.

The wizard’s body was completely stiff. He widened his eyes and turned around in shock, looking at Wang Xian who had appeared behind him.

“In order to prevent you from having any trump cards to survive, so…”

“Soul Catcher!”

Wang Xian stared at the Wizard with a smile on his face. He stirred his dragon claws and a surge of energy spread towards his body.

The Wizard’s life force was dissipating at a terrifying speed.

Buzz

“You… how is it possible… speed…”

His eyes were wide open and filled with despair. He struggled to make a sound.

His pupils slowly dilated.

Waves of information entered Wang Xian’s mind. Everything about the magi and their secrets were revealed one by one.

“Sir Magus!”

“Not good, Sir Magus!”

“The Dragon King killed our Sir Magus!”

Terrified and trembling voices came from the surroundings. Some of the powerhouses and disciples of the sorcery association shouted in horror.

“What!”

The monarch turned his head and looked over, his expression changing greatly.

Looking at the Dragon King who was standing behind the wizard, his eyes revealed a look of fear.

The Wizard was killed instantly by the Dragon King’s sneak attack.

“We can’t stay here, run, run, run!”

The monarch murmured, feeling extremely panicked.

“Run, run!”

The monarch quickly retreated to the back and shouted at the other divine emperor of the monarch.

“Ahhhhh!” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

The monarch retreated to the back of the disciples of the Wizard Association and dodged the Wind God Dragon’s attack.

However, the disciples of the Wizard Association were hit, and a large number of them died instantly.

“Buzz!”

The monarch could no longer care about the lives of the others. His body trembled slightly and he slowly disappeared.

“Roar! Roar!”

The Wind God Dragon roared angrily, and wind blades covered him.

Countless wind blades landed at his position, but they were unable to hold him back.

The array set up by the sky array could only trap a rank one void God Emperor. It was useless against a rank two void God Emperor.

“Monarch!”

When the monarch of the imperial court saw the monarch fleeing, he let out a loud roar. His figure became slightly illusory.

But very soon, his face turned pale and revealed a look of despair.

“The Wizard is dead, the Emperor has escaped!”
