Chapter 106: Technique

“This girl’s body is deficient and lacks a type of element. This made her body weak and made her suffer from breathing difficulties. She will still need some time to recuperate!”

The juvenile wiggled his fingers and another dozen silver needles appeared in his hand. He continued with a smile, “I’ll execute silver needle treatment on her to first wake her up.”

When the juvenile completed his sentence, he moved his hands so quickly that they formed after images which confused the onlooking crowd.

“Incredible! Absolutely incredible! You are indeed from the Sacred Followers Guild! The techniques of hidden needles and laying out needles are truly incredible!”

“Yeah. I would have never thought that the University of Rivertown would have such an incredible expert. Looking at the medical skills of this young miracle doctor, you are more than qualified to become a tutor in our medical branch!”

The middle-aged school doctor and lead each exclaimed in disbelief.

“It’s just a simple trick and isn’t anything!” The juvenile revealed a satisfied look but still replied in an arrogant manner.

“If this is a simple trick for this young miracle doctor, my medical skills will be nothing in comparison. Incredible!”

The middle-aged school doctor gave him a thumbs-up.

Hehe!

The juvenile smiled faintly as he controlled the silver needle in his hand. Soon, the girl opened her eyes gradually.

“I... This... What happened?” The girl looked around, feeling a little lost.

“Awesome, awesome. You are indeed worthy of the name of ‘miracle doctor!’”

The two leads were thrilled and remarked excitedly.

“Alright, for the coming week, rest well and have some beef and fruits. Together with my silver needles treatment, I can guarantee that you will recover within a week!”

As the young man waved his hand, all the silver needles were kept within his hand.

“So strong!” Doctor Sun, who was on the side, also looked at the girl with amazement.

“Basic operations.” The arrogant juvenile nodded his head and suddenly looked to Wang Xian. “This student seemed to be thinking of providing treatment too a while ago. Did you learn medical skills previously?”

Wang Xian was taken aback, shook his head, smiled and replied, “I know a little about healing.”

Tsk! “If you don’t understand it well, it’s better than you don’t try providing treatment to others. Otherwise, you might make it worse if you misdiagnose the symptoms!”

The juvenile spoke in a tone similar to how a senior would guide a junior.

“This young miracle doctor is right. Misdiagnosing would only harm the patient. If you aren’t confident, it’s better if you don’t act rashly. Not only does this young miracle doctor have extraordinary medical skills, but his medical ethics are also worth respecting!” the middle-aged man said as he tried to lick the juvenile’s boots.

“I’m just a little more gifted than others.” The juvenile shook his head and continued, “Please send this student to the dormitory to rest. Give her something to eat in an hour or two, and she should be recovering well. For the following days, I’ll perform a few additional rounds of treatments and she will recover fully!”

“Alright, thank you, young miracle doctor! Thank you, young miracle doctor!” The two leads quickly replied. “Why don’t we excuse the young miracle doctor from training and let him be a doctor here? If any students are to encounter any issues, we would also be more assured with this young miracle doctor with us!”

“Yeah, that will work too!” The juvenile nodded his head and revealed a prideful smile. “With me around, there wouldn’t be any issues!”

“Yeah, yeah. Definitely! With you around, we will feel more reassured too.” The middle-aged school doctor quickly seconded.

Haiz. “You two students...if you guys are free, can you help us bring this girl back to her room?” one of the leads said to Wang Xian and Wang Dahai.

“Alright!” Wang Dahai nodded his head and squatted down, ready to help the girl up.

“Let me do it!” Wang Xian extended his hand over to stop Wang Dahai. He bent down and placed his hand on the stomach area of the girl.

“Huh? What are you doing?” When the middle-aged school doctor saw Wang Xian placing his hand on the girl’s stomach, he immediately frowned.

“I’m just taking a look!” Wang Xian lifted his head and smiled.

“What are you looking for? You can’t possibly be thinking that you could cure her?” the middle-aged doctor said sarcastically. “Hurry up! The young miracle doctor has already seen her. Stop causing trouble!”

“Hehe! Don’t move recklessly if you don’t know anything! Do you think you could tell her condition just by placing your hand on her? Childish!”

The young man looked at Wang Xian with contempt.

Hehe.

Wang Xian laughed and had a cold expression. “I was still wondering how incredible one from the Sacred Followers Guild is. It seems that you are just average.”

“What the hell are you saying? Do you even understand what “Sacred Followers Guild” represents?”

When Wang Xian completed his sentence, the middle-aged school doctor standing by the side immediately shouted at Wang Xian mercilessly. “What did you say? I dare you to repeat it!”

When that juvenile heard Wang Xian, his face sank too. “Sacred Followers Guild isn’t something you could humiliate!”

“What the hell are you saying? Hurry and apologize to this young miracle doctor!” The two leads also condemned Wang Xian solemnly.

“If everyone in Sacred Followers Guild is at your level... Hehe!”

Wang Xian looked at the group of people shouting at him and his expression turned chilly.

He looked to the girl and moved his finger, tapping on over 10 spots on the girl.

“Brat, are you humiliating me?”

The juvenile’s eyes flickered as he stared at Wang Xian. He moved his fingers and needles appeared within his hands.

Wang Xian ignored him and simply injected vitality of the Wood Element into the girl’s body.

With his current strength, he wouldn’t have to exhaust dragon energy for treatment and could simply rely on the vitality of the Wood Element to cure the girl.

The fatigued girl suddenly felt strength returning to her body. She opened her eyes and looked at Wang Xian in astonishment.

“Brat, I’m talking to you!”

Seeing that Wang Xian wasn’t replying to him, he remarked, “Get up!”

Wang Xian stood up gradually and gave the juvenile a harsh stare. He then extended his hand over to the girl.

“Thank you!” The girl nodded her head and grabbed onto Wang Xian’s hands. She was blushing and stood up with Wang Xian’s assistance.

The crowd was stunned their attention was all on the girl.

Doctor Sun, who had been by the side all along, was thrilled. She immediately asked, “Are you feeling any discomfort?”

“Nope. When brother tapped on my body, I felt very comfortable. Moreover, I’m feeling a lot better than before.”

The girl replied as she stole glances at Wang Xian with a blushing face.

“You just have a small issue and it could be solved with a little treatment. Have regular meals in the future and don’t lag behind on your military training!” Wang Xian instructed directly.

The truth was that he didn’t know the source of the girl’s problem. However, it didn’t matter. The dense vitality of the Wood Element had eradicated the issue at the source. Besides that, the girl’s body composition was a little weak, and military training would be beneficial for her.

“Alright, brother, thank you!” The girl nodded her head.

Wang Xian nodded his head in response and turned to the juvenile beside him. He lifted his head and said with contempt, “If members of the Sacred Followers Guild are like you, they aren’t anything special. Trash!”

“YOU...” When the juvenile heard Wang Xian, he held onto the silver needles in his hand tightly and his eyes were filled with murderous intent.

The middle-aged school doctor and the two leads were stunned. This time, they didn’t comment anything when they heard Wang Xian.

Wang Xian had simply tapped a few times on the girl and she was cured. As for this juvenile from the Sacred Followers Guild, he claimed that the girl required a week of treatment.

One could easily tell the difference between them!

Recalling how they had chided Wang Xian just a while ago, the group was feeling embarrassed currently.

“You are from the Medical Saint Sect? What techniques did you just use?” The juvenile stared intensely at Wang Xian and questioned him.

“Brat, I’m not from the Medical Saint Sect. As for medical techniques, I only understood a little and am not as well-known as your Sacred Followers Guild. Hehe!”

Wang Xian looked at the juvenile with mocking eyes. “As for the technique, it’s called ‘Anyhow Pressure Points Technique!’ Hehe. Brat, don’t be so cocky when you don’t have the capabilities. Otherwise, you are just bringing shame to the Sacred Followers Guild!”

Wang Xian imitated how the juvenile had acted previously and chided as though he was simply educating a junior as a senior!
