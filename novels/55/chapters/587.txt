Chapter 588: Serpent Sword

Standing at the entrance to the fourth floor, Wang Xian hesitated a little.

Let’s practice the other two battle techniques when I have the time!

It was already the next morning and he still had to attend a spiritual tea session in the afternoon.

Wang Xian wouldn’t want to miss the spiritual tea session.

Wang Xian didn’t have many other hobbies. He wasn’t a fan of smoking or drinking alcohol. All he liked was to taste and enjoy great tea.

He wouldn’t want to miss tea that was made from Level 7 spiritual tea leaves.

He didn’t return to Mt. Fengyu. Instead, he flew towards Yong Chang City directly.

At this moment, there was still a huge pile of materials waiting for him to refine.

Refining spiritual equipment was relatively more time consuming as compared to refining elixir pills to Wang Xian. Therefore, he had to refine the materials piling up in his shop as soon as possible.

When he reached Yong Chang City, dawn had just broken.

Huh?

When Wang Xian arrived at his shop, he was surprised to see a burly young man standing at the entrance.

The young man was roughly two meters tall and had an exceptionally burly build. He wore a long black robe and looked imposing.

Behind him, he carried a huge sword that was roughly two meters long.

“Are you here to refine elixir pills or spiritual equipment?”

Wang Xian looked at the young man, took out his key and opened the doors to the shop.

“You are the master of this shop?”

Seeing Wang Xian opening the door, he asked this in a solemn and low voice.

His voice was ordinary but had a unique dominance.

“Yeah. Get your materials ready!” Wang Xian said plainly to the young man.

“I’m here because I wanted to modify this weapon of mine!” The young man stepped into the shop and remarked with a straight face.

“Modify your weapon? Get your materials ready, leave the weapon you want to modify behind and write down your requirements for the modification!” Wang Xian replied directly.

“I’d like to stay behind to watch. Moreover, I only have a set of materials. I can pay the rest with spiritual stones!”

The young man frowned and answered Wang Xian.

“Come again in half a month. I don’t have time now!”

Wang Xian’s eyebrows knitted together upon hearing him before answering plainly.

“You are going to help me modify today!” The young man paid no attention to what Wang Xian had said.

Huh?

Wang Xian raised an eyebrow and looked at that young man.

He had bushy eyebrows, thick lips, a burly stature and a naturally imposing demeanor.

“Get in the queue!” Wang Xian said as he turned and headed to the second floor.

Weng!

Just as Wang Xian took the first step, a razor-sharp Sword Edge flashed across and blocked off his route.

The blade was close to half a meter long and was emitting a chilling aura.

Wang Xian squinted his eyes, turned around and stared at the young man. “What? You want a fight now?”

“Get it modified today. I won’t pay you a single spiritual stone fewer!” The young man stared at Wang Xian with his deep and black eyes as he remarked coldly.

“What if I say no?”

Seeing the attitude displayed by the young man, Wang Xian’s expression turned solemn. He flicked his finger towards the Sword Edge.

Ka ka!

Sounds of mirrors cracking reverberated and the blade before Wang Xian collapsed instantly.

“Huh? You are pretty strong!”

The young man was surprised Wang Xian could crush his Sword Edge with a flick of his finger. He squinted his eyes to observe Wang Xian and said, “I’ll compensate you with sufficient spiritual stones. You have to help me modify my sword right now!”

“Is this the attitude to have when you are asking me for a favor?”

Wang Xian looked at the young man with contempt and shouted, “Get out!”

The young man was haughty and exceptionally conceited. He was requesting that Wang Xian modify his spiritual sword and yet showed Wang Xian a horrible attitude.

Wang Xian wasn’t lacking in spiritual stones at this moment. If the young man wasn’t polite to him, he could afford to simply ignore him.

“Think before you talk. You are going to modify as I requested. I wouldn’t be cheating you on the spiritual stones!”

When the young man heard Wang Xian, he was still emotionless. It was as though he was incapable of showing emotions. Gradually, he lifted his arm and drew the huge sword.

The huge sword didn’t have a sharp edge and looked extremely heavy. It was entirely black and seemed capable of absorbing sunlight.

On it, streams of black water were flowing.

“This is...?”

Wang Xian stared at the sword and was surprised. Level 12 spiritual equipment! Moreover, the water that was flowing on the surface wasn’t ordinary water!

“Scram!”

Wang Xian shifted his gaze away, turned around and headed for the stairs once again.

Weng weng!

At this moment, the young man’s arm trembled and a black-colored Sword Edge shot out from the huge sword towards the stairs where Wang Xian was heading!

“You must be eager to die! I’m asking you to get out and you shall get out now!”

Ruthlessness beamed in the eyes of Wang Xian. Moving the longsword in his hand, a huge mountain-shaped sword appeared below the black energy blade.

Bam!

A terrifying explosion reverberated and the immense energy was absorbed by the mountain-shaped sword.

“Sword Alps! And you are so skillful in it!”

The young man’s eyes lit up. Waving the huge sword in his arm, shots of Sword Edge slashed towards Wang Xian like a strong storm.

“Sword Edge Storm?”

Seeing the young man attacking, Wang Xian moved. Mountain-shaped swords hovered around him as he started swinging the Phantom Sword.

“Sword Edge Storm!”

The same Sword Edge Storm!

However, Wang Xian’s Sword Edge Storm perfectly deflected the young man’s Sword Edge Storm as they continued their attacking paths towards the young man.

“Great! What a great use of Sword Edge Storm!”

The young man was burning with passion. He placed the huge edgeless black sword across his body and one could see the black water energy flowing rapidly on it.

“Sword Alps!”

The same Sword Alps!

Tsk!

Wang Xian snorted. He swung his sword in a cross action as sword-shaped energy struck towards the young man. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Thinking of breaking my defense? A wishful thought!”

The young man shouted and the huge sword in his hand started rotating.

Bam! Bam!

Bam! Bam!

The young man’s Sword Edge Storm and Wang Xian’s Sword Edge Storm hit their opponent at the same time but were stopped by their Sword Alps.

“Sword Jail!”

However, the sword energy launched by Wang Xian trapped the young man directly.

The burly young man lifted his head and was clearly shocked. “Three middle-class battle techniques! I had not expected you to have mastered three middle-class battle techniques!

“However...” Confidence quickly returned to the young man, shown in his expression. “However, your Sword Jail won’t be able to trap me!”

As he spoke, the huge sword before him glowed brightly. The black rays gradually pushed against the Sword Jail.

“Just get out!”

Wang Xian waved his arm and revealed a cold smirk. As he spoke, the Sword Jail enlarged and transformed into a three-meters by three-meters water region.

The water region shrouded the young man.

Wang Xian waved his arm.

Boom!

The entire water region appeared to have suffered catastrophic attacks. Intense and fierce water columns coalesced and smashed towards the young man.

“What?”

At this moment, the emotionless face of the young man finally revealed a different expression. His body flew out of the exit under the strong impact of water energy.

Bam!

The young man plunged his huge sword heavily into the ground and was completely shocked.

Pfft!

“So strong... This... How can this be possible?”

The young man looked out of sorts while staring blankly at the shop.
