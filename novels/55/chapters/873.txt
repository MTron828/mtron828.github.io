Wang Xian looked over and found it very interesting.

The Floating Island came to a stop. The two western gods quickly pulled the red carpet and placed it on the floating island.

“Welcome, Dragon King and Dragon Queen. May I know what your orders are for coming to the western continent?”

A few leaders of the celestial domain greeted Wang Xian respectfully.

“It’s fine. You Don’t have to be so grand since you’re here for a vacation. I’ll be spending some time in the west!”

Wang Xian waved his hand at them.

“Vacation?”

The western gods were slightly taken aback. Following that, an old man quickly said, “Dragon King, since you’re here for a vacation, we naturally have to give you a proper explanation. Little Lina, come over and be the tour guide for the Dragon King and the Dragon Queen!”

“Dragon King, my daughter is more familiar with Paris!”

“Dragon King, my wife is very familiar with the entire western continent!”

“Dragon King, I used to serve my father for a long time. Let Me Be Your Butler for a few days!”

A few leaders of the celestial domain said hurriedly. They even went on stage themselves to be the Butler!

A few girls were full of smiles when they saw this scene.

Wang Xian smiled and waved his hand. “We will be here for the next one to two months. There’s no need to trouble you guys!”

“Dragon King, there’s no need to trouble you, there’s no need to trouble you. The Dragon King might not know about the specialty snacks here. How about this? There are people in the celestial domain who know about the specialties, snacks, and people who are here for fun. We will send someone to guide you, Dragon King and Dragon Queen!”

One of the leaders of the celestial domain quickly waved his hand and looked at the few leaders of the celestial domain beside him.

“That’s good too. I’ll have to trouble all of you. We don’t want to be disturbed when we’re here. Let’s meet up again before we leave!”

Wang Xian said politely.

“Alright, Alright. Dragon King, Please Do Your Thing!”

The group of western gods quickly said respectfully. They turned to a goddess beside them and said, “Little Lina, you’re more familiar with Paris. Bring the Dragon King and the Dragon Queen to have some fun!”

“Yes, Father!”

“Dragon King and Dragon Queen, This Way Please!”

“Welcome, Dragon King and Dragon Queen!”

As the few leaders of the celestial domain spoke, the gods behind them shouted and shouted loudly.

Wang Xian smiled speechlessly. He felt that these gods were like the village loudspeakers. It was rather interesting.

Wang Xian did not have the face of Buddha and the rest.

Nowadays, his position on earth was like that of an ancient king. The more polite he was, the more the western gods felt that they did not treat him well and the more uneasy they were.

Wang Xian was not someone who did not know the truth. Although the difference in strength between the two parties was huge, he would not be overbearing and not give the other party face.

He stepped on the red carpet and walked to the shore.

“Welcome, Dragon King!”

There were more people gathered by the shore. All of them were experts from the celestial domain. They knelt down and shouted.

Wang Xian waved his arm and a powerful force supported them up. “No need to kneel!”

“Oh right, when we are playing, you can’t let everyone be so courteous when they see us. It’s fine as long as it’s normal. We don’t want to be disturbed!”

Wang Xian reminded the western gods.

“Yes, it’s the Dragon King. I guarantee that we won’t disturb you!”

The leaders of the celestial realms nodded their heads quickly.

Wang Xian nodded with a smile and moved into a castle.

Upon learning of the Dragon King’s arrival, the western gods were trying to think of ways to let Wang Xian and the rest experience the best service. Everything was the best.

A castle, fine wine!

The Dragon Queens were going shopping? Alright, Alright. Two top designers from Paris were following them around. They were helping them to pick out clothes and even personally making clothes.

After dinner, the sons and daughters of the Gods transformed into personal maids and personally led them to various special snacks, restaurants, hotels, and restaurants!

When they went to the amusement park, the Dragon King should not be too high-profile. It was normal for him to cut the queue.

As for spending money, how was that possible...

Under the orders of the Celestial Realms in the west, all the western martial artists knew that the Dragon King had come to the west.

Hence, Dragon King and Dragon Queen were welcome to visit a certain place at any time.

The people welcomed you.

It was a feast of licking and flattery!

There were even many people taking pictures with Wang Xian and the rest from afar.

No matter where they went, they would smile and receive a warm welcome.

This indeed made Wang Xian, Guan Shuqing, and the rest happier and in a good mood.

“The sailboat in front is so beautiful!”

On this night, Wang Xian and the rest came to a lakeside with smiles on their faces. Below them were sailboats.

“Eh? There’s a patient there!”

At this moment, Sun Lingxiu saw a tattered old man squatting in the corner. The Old Man’s face was extremely pale.

Not only was he hungry, he was also sick.

“How Pitiful!”

Sun Lingxiu sighed slowly. She waved her arm and a strong light energy landed directly on the old man.

The old man’s figure suddenly changed, and his face revealed a shocked expression. Soon after, his face was full of excitement.

He looked at Sun Lingxiu and knelt on the ground with gratitude.

“Thank you, thank you benefactor!”

The old man shouted excitedly and kept kowtowing to Sun Lingxiu!

“There are too many poor people in the world. Dragon Queen, You Are Really Merciful!”

The goddess who had been following beside him said with admiration.

“That’s right. There are too many pitiful people in the world!”

Sun Lingxiu was a doctor in the past. She had always had the tendency of being a holy mother. It could not be said that she was a holy mother. This was a form of kindness.

Perhaps it was because of her heart and the light system, she was much kinder than ordinary people.

“No matter how many pitiful people there are, they can still be saved now as long as you want to!”

If one was poor, one could live a good life. If one was successful, one could also help the world.

With Wang Xian’s current strength, he could change the entire world.

“Alright. In the future, I will treat everyone for free whenever I go to a place. Oh right, on the day of Xiao Yu’s wedding, let’s celebrate and distribute the items to everyone in need!”

Sun Lingxiu said with a kind face.

“Sure!”

Wang Xian nodded. “Let the whole world celebrate when that day comes!”

Everyone was full of smiles. The goddess, who was also a tour guide, revealed a hint of admiration in her eyes.

However, the current Dragon King was indeed qualified to change the entire world with just one sentence.

With just one sentence, he could turn beggars into rich people and rich people into beggars.

He was truly in control of the world.

In the next two days, Sun Lingxiu ordered all the patients in the city to come over and use a holy light.

With her extraordinary strength, even if it was a terminal illness, she could easily be cured.

There were even some martial artists who had chronic illnesses that were directly cured.

Sun Lingxiu, who had a light constitution, had extraordinary strength. On Earth, it wasn’t an exaggeration to call her the goddess of light.

In the following period of time, the title of the goddess of light was indeed given to Sun Lingxiu after the Benevolent Dragon Queen.

In the future, she was welcomed by the entire city every time she walked through a city. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

This time, it was a sincere welcome.

If one was poor, he would be a good person. If one was successful, he would be able to help the world.

During his last period of cultivation, Wang Xian could be considered to have done one last thing for the humans on Earth.

Do not seek fame, just a clear conscience!
