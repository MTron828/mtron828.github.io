Chapter 546: Arrival Of The Dragon!

“The Underworld will likely have a peaceful period for some time!”

“That’s right. Everyone will probably be wary of the Dragon Sect. Damn! The strength displayed by the Dragon Sect today is truly insane!”

“Towards the end of the battle, it was clear that Sect Leader Nie Wushuang had lost. Also, it was impossible for Emperor Qi to win. This was because the Dragon King was still standing a thousand meters away while watching the battle develop.”

“If it wasn’t for the void space shattering today, the Dragon Sect would have ruled supreme. How did the Dragon King get so terrifying? He’s just going to be twenty-one years old this year!”

“When the Dragon King returns, the Underworld will likely be under the Dragon Sect!”

“I wonder...when will the Dragon King and the rest return?”

“Hehe! It’s actually pretty good to have the Dragon Sect and Dragon King. Those they have killed were those that offended him or were from Diabolism. The Dragon King has not killed an innocent without reason. For small characters like us, there’s nothing bad about this!” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

After the battles of the supreme experts at the tallest peak of Huashan, all the martial artists in the Underworld didn’t stay for long as they headed for the exit.

The crowd discussed what had happened today excitedly.

The major battles today had greatly enhanced their views of the world.

Mo Qinglong and the rest from the Dragon Sect took a further glance at the space that the Dragon King had been sucked into. The next moment, they took flight and headed towards Rivertown.

Protect the Dragon Sect till the Dragon King returns!

As dragonians and members of the Dragon Palace, they could still sense the existence of their Dragon King. This would mean that the Dragon King had not died.

As long as the Dragon King was alive, they believed that he would return soon.

They weren’t worried about it in the slightest.

Soon, all the martial artists of the Underworld had departed from the tallest peak of Huashan. What was left was the ruined tallest peak of Huashan, which had cracked, and destruction that spanned over a thousand meters.

Amidst the mountain range, the land looked uniquely wretched.

“Who would have expected that guy to be so strong! Budding Realm! Even my other brothers are a far cry in terms of talent compared to him.

At the foot of the mountain of Huashan, two people remained. One was a young girl while the other was the guild leader of the Sacred Followers Guild.

“Hehe! I had not expected the Dragon King to have such exceptional talents either. It’s truly frightening. Hehe. Xiaoxiao, do you think the Dragon King could become an Immortal?” the guild leader of the Sacred Followers Guild asked that little girl.

“There’s a high possibility...”

That little girl was recalcitrant but it was hard for her to not be convinced by Wang Xian. She pouted and added, “I do feel that the middle-aged swordsman has a higher chance of reaching the Immortal Realm. His swordsmanship is really powerful!”

The guild leader of the Sacred Followers Guild nodded his head silently before asking, “Shall we go in?”

“Yes, master. Just follow me back. After all, it won’t be long till we can enter and leave as we wish. Cultivation there will be four to five times quicker than here. At locations where the Immortal Sects are, it will be seven to eight times quicker. Since we have gathered the required information, let’s get back!”

The little girl nodded her head, held onto the hands of the guild leader of the Sacred Followers Guild and answered.

“Alright, I’d like to take a look at the legendary land of the Immortals, the world of Yong Chang.

The eyes of the guild leader of the Sacred Followers Guild were filled with anticipation.

“Hehe! Let’s go then!” the little girl replied with a smile. In her hands, she held several iPads. In them, there was a range of information on the current society.

This was something that her father had asked her to gather when she was sent to modern society. This was done in preparation for when Yong Chang descended on the current world.

They were various bits of information on the current lifestyles and their technology.

The little brat led the guild leader of the Sacred Followers Guild to the peak of a mountain and rubbed a blue spiritual item on her neck.

Weng!

Suddenly, two pairs of terrifying arms appeared. Four palms with fiery-red gloves ripped apart the space of an area.

“Xiaoxiao, hurry!”

A voice came from the other end. The little girl jumped in immediately without hesitation.

The guild leader of the Sacred Followers Guild was shocked to witness this. Four huge hands had ripped apart the space directly. He had no doubts that the energy in those hands could easily crush him to death.

Pa Pa!

When he entered it, he fell towards the land immediately.

The guild leader of the Sacred Followers Guild was surprised to see the two pairs of fiery-red gloves being destroyed by the spirit array instantly.

While he was still in shock, a huge flaming palm appeared below them and led them towards a direction.

All these actions were like those one would envision of an Immortal.

What the little girl didn’t know was the exorbitant price of entering the Yong Chang world.

Although four to five Budding Realm experts could rip apart space, they would suffer terrifying attacks when they entered.

The intensity of these attacks would be dependent on the strength of the martial artist.

Even the powerful Immortal Realm experts wouldn’t dare to. This was because the fatality rate was ninety percent and no one would like to take this risk.

As for the two pairs of flaming gloves that had exploded previously, those were Level 12 Spiritual equipment.

This was the price for allowing the two of them to enter.

Just a while ago, Wang Xian had suffered attacks from the spirit array as he entered. The terrifying force sent chills down his spine.

The destructive attacks made Wang Xian feel like he was going to be torn apart.

However, Wang Xian was a divine dragon after all and had the body of a divine dragon.

Before he felt he would collapse, he realized he had made it through.

Nonetheless, his body was severely injured by the attacks. Before he could exhaust dragon energy to heal himself, he lost consciousness and fell to the ground.

Yong Chang world was the world suppressed by the Yong Chang Cauldron. The entire world wasn’t huge and was roughly the size of a large province in China.

Or roughly the size of South Korea.

There were three Immortal Sects in Yong Chang world and they were Yong Chang Immortal Sect, Immortal Slaying Sect and the Da Hong Immortal Sect.

Yong Chang Immortal Sect specialized in fire attribute, Da Hong Immortal Sect specialized in water attribute, and Immortal Slaying Sect was known for their Metal attribute sword cultivators.

Together with the three Immortal Sects were seven to eight smaller sects.

Da Hong Immortal Sect was located in the middle of a mountain range. The tallest mountain could reach a height of roughly five thousand meters, which was twice the height of Huashan.

Rumbling sounds were incessant throughout the mountain range where Da Hong Immortal Sect was located.

Waterfall! There are waterfalls everywhere that start from the highest peak.

Chirp chirp chirp!

Spiritual birds flew in the sky. The water of the waterfall was exceptionally clear with fishes occasionally emerging.

Birds swooped down from the sky and scooped the fish away as prey.

Bam!

A bird that was entirely white and almost a meter in size stood at the highest peak while staring vigilantly at the fishes before the waterfall.

Just as it was about to swoop down, a figure dropped from the sky. The white bird was shocked and stared blankly at that figure which floated down the waterfall.

“Splitting the water while maintaining the water in its position for five seconds is the benchmark of gaining great mastery of Da Hong Sword Technique. The results of all your assessments previously are generally below average. Practice diligently over this period!”

Below a waterfall, a lady stood in the middle and the water separated onto two sides automatically.

Around her, several twenty-odd-year-old young men and girls held longswords in their hands while slashing at the waterfall.

Argh!

At this moment, a horrifying scream resounded. A girl was horrified to see a figure falling from the waterfall before her.

The arrival of the dragon!
