Chapter 3922: The terrifying treasure of the 3921 divine dragons

Translator: 549690339

Crack Crack

When Wang Xian opened the third treasure box, a majestic energy gushed over!

Dragon Bead!

This was a dragon bead!

No, this was not a dragon bead.

The energy emitted from the dragon bead should be mainly of nine attributes. However, the energy emitted from a dragon bead was not spatial energy.

It was… spatial energy!

Yes, the familiar spatial energy was somewhat similar to the energy in an Lie’s body.

In this dragon pearl, one could vaguely see a young dragon curled up inside.

This did not seem to be a dragon pearl, but a Dragon Egg!

A dragon egg that nurtured the spatial divine dragon.

“What is this?”

Wang Xian’s face was filled with astonishment as he looked at the introduction in the treasure box.

“The Space Dragon Pearl, the nemesis of the nine-origin universe and the Void

Universe, has four to five aeons. Before the three aeons, the Divine Dragon Clan’s heaven-origin creation and the other heaven-origin creation in the nine-origin universe tried to create a brand new dragon species, the void divine dragon, but they never succeeded! ”

“At the last moment, there was only one void Dragon Pearl that contained boundless space energy. If this dragon pearl could be integrated into the body, it could increase one attribute, the space attribute! ”

“However, it is extremely difficult to increase one’s attribute, especially if it does not conflict with one’s own energy. However, according to my speculation, if one has the ancestral tree and the ancestral tree recognizes its owner, perhaps one could absorb the void dragon bead and increase the spatial attribute to fight against the void race! ”

The introduction was long. Wang Xian’s eyes were sparkling as he read the message.

He didn’t expect the void dragon bead to have such a long history.

It was actually created a few eons ago.

However, it had never succeeded.

“With the ancestral tree and the recognition of the ancestral tree, is it possible to absorb the Void Dragon Bead?”

Wang Xian mumbled as he held it with both hands.

With a thought, the branches of the ancestral tree appeared and wrapped it up.

After wrapping it up, Wang Xian saw that there was no reaction and frowned slightly.

He hesitated for a moment and stabbed a root into the void dragon bead.

To Wang Xian’s surprise, the root easily pierced into the void dragon bead!

He saw that the root was slowly connected to the extremely small divine dragon in the Void Dragon Bead.

“Hualala!”

At this moment, Wang Xian could vaguely hear the ancestral tree trembling slightly. The sound of leaves and branches colliding with each other followed closely behind the void dragon bead in his hand and slowly disappeared.

Wang Xian looked at this scene with a look of astonishment.

Through his spiritual perception, he discovered that there was an additional void dragon bead at the top of the ancestral tree.

The energy of the ancestral tree enveloped the dragon bead, and this void dragon bead also emitted a special energy that enveloped the ancestral tree.

This made Wang Xian feel extremely amazed.

The energy of the void dragon bead could actually envelop the ancestral tree?

This was simply unbelievable.

One had to know that the ancestral tree was a true heaven’s origin creation, even if it had not fully grown up yet.

“However, it can be seen that this void dragon bead is not simple. It was created by the Heaven’s origin creation of the previous Divine Dragon. It has already passed two to three tribulations, yet it is still preserved to this day. One can imagine how precious it is. ”

Wang Xian mumbled to himself. His eyes were filled with excitement.

He just didn’t know when he would be able to finish refining this void dragon bead?

After refining it, would he be able to possess the spatial attribute?

He was looking forward to it. His gaze landed on the last item.

It was a bag. It was obviously a spatial bag!

He walked over and slowly opened it!

After opening it, a large number of treasures appeared in his mind.

There were treasures from the very low level to the peak of the Dominator level.

However, the number of treasures, other than those of the low level, was not too many!

In the middle of this spatial bag, there was a special formation. The formation was emitting an extremely powerful energy.

“This is the system’s treasure vault. ”

Wang Xian smiled when he saw this.

This was also the treasure vault where Wang Xian exchanged items from the system.

He took out the energy items and activated the teleportation formation. After that, the items were transferred to his hands.

However, it was not worth it to exchange for items with energy. Wang Xian had never exchanged for them after that.

Now, all the items belonged to Wang Xian.

There were bloodlines such as the thorned dragon, Imperial Dragon, and Berserk Dragon.

Of course, these were not of much use to Wang Xian.

This was because the dragon palace already possessed these dragon species.

There were many treasures and items, densely packed together.

“This is?”

However, at this moment, he was attracted by the item at the top.

It was a book of the water attribute. The book looked a little worn and tattered.

It was not complete. It seemed to have been torn into several pieces.

This was just one of the pieces.

Wang Xian’s mind moved and the book flew into his hand.

Boom

In an instant, Wang Xian felt as though he was enveloped in an ocean. Endless water energy surged over.

He quickly regained his consciousness and stared at the book!

There was a line on the book.

This shabby book had a few pages in front and a cover.

The cover was a picture of a wave with a few words on it.

Wang Xian didn’t recognize these words, but an energy and spiritual fluctuation allowed him to understand the meaning of these words.

The Book of Water Curse!

“The book of Water Curse? This book. ”

Wang Xian stared at it intently. From the book of water curse, he could feel a vast and lofty power.

This was the power of the Heaven’s origin creation.

However, it was obvious that this book was an incomplete treasure of the Heaven’s origin creation.

In other words, it was a fragment of the Heaven’s origin creation!

“A fragment of the Heaven’s origin creation. The former Divine Dragon Clan actually has a fragment of the Heaven’s origin creation! ”

Wang Xian couldn’t help but laugh out loud.

This was the heritage of the Divine Dragon Clan.

This was the strength of the Divine Dragon Clan!

A fragment of the Heaven’s origin destiny!

The energy in this book of water curse was no weaker than the fragment of the Starfield!

In fact, it was even stronger than the fragment of the Starfield.

“The second fragment of the Heaven’s origin destiny. This is a huge win for me. The treasure left behind by the Divine Dragon Clan is simply too terrifying! ”

Wang Xian couldn’t help but Roar in excitement!

With this book of water curse, his strength would receive another huge boost. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Wang Xian couldn’t help but clench his fists.

After putting away the book of water curse, his gaze landed on the few treasures below the book of water curse.

They were resplendent crystals that contained resplendent blood essence.

Wang Xian sensed it and a message was transmitted.

Bone Dragon’s blood essence and a trace of Dragon Soul!

Frost Divine Dragon’s blood essence and a trace of Dragon Soul!

Wind Thunder Divine Dragon’s blood essence and a trace of Dragon Soul!

Light and Dark Divine Dragon’s blood essence and a trace of Dragon Soul!

Five Elements Divine Dragon’s blood essence and a trace of Dragon Soul!

The pure blood essence of five divine dragons could produce five mutated divine dragons!
