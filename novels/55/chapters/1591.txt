Chapter 1592: 1592. The destruction of the Iceheart Empire

With the character of the Sky Devil, would he let us off if he kneeled?

The words of the Iceheart king caused a look of despair to appear in the eyes of the Type 7 and Type 6 insightful void realm experts.

They looked at the center of the mushroom cloud that covered an area of over 10 kilometers.

Energy surged, but there was still no victor.

It had been nearly 10 minutes. The three of them had besieged a sky devil, but they still could not take him down.

“Then, why did we provoke him in the first place?”

A rank 7 insightful void realm expert gritted his teeth and growled weakly.

“If we knew that priest Wang was a sky devil, would we have provoked him?”

Bingxin king turned to look at the old man beside him expressionlessly and said calmly, “The mistake is that we should not betray others for the sake of obtaining greater benefits!”

As he spoke, a bitter smile and despair appeared on his face. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

At this moment, he understood very clearly that if they hadn’t been ungrateful, the Bingxin dynasty wouldn’t have been destroyed.

“Keke, it’s a little too late to understand now!”

The stooped old man looked over, his eyes filled with disdain.

His figure moved, and the devil hands behind him enveloped the group of the king of Bingxin Kingdom.

“I’m not satisfied. Why did you make a mistake? Let us take the blame!”

An expert at the sixth rank of the profound void martial stage shouted with a face full of unwillingness.

However, facing the full-strength attack of the hunchbacked old man, they didn’t have the strength to resist.

In fact, at this moment, the Ice Heart King and several experts at the seventh rank of the profound void martial stage had already given up on resisting.

“Pu Pu Pu!”

The sound of tearing could be heard, and it was exceptionally clear in the entire silent city.

All the people kneeling on the ground looked up and saw their king and their emperor’s body being brutally torn apart.

The Ice Heart Empire was finished!

“The rest of you don’t have to worry. No matter how cruel boss Devil and I are, it’s impossible for us to destroy tens of millions of lives. However, the Ice Heart Empire’s royal family must die. Keke!”

As the hunchbacked old man spoke, he waved his arm, and the pulsing ball of blood instantly flew in front of him.

Through the ball of blood, he was able to sense every single member of the Iceheart Empire’s royal family.

“TSK TSK, there are still a few who aren’t dead!”

His figure flashed, and he instantly appeared in the sky above the ruins within the city. He waved his arm.

Rumble

A group of figures appeared in his line of sight.

More than twenty young men were enveloped in a formation, dodging the attacks of the Great Dark Sun.

Ten of the young men had pale faces as they looked at the hunchbacked old man with despair.

“Don’t kill me, don’t kill me!”

Seeing the hunchbacked old man staring at them with a smile on his face, they shouted in terror.

“Senior...”

The other ten or so young men in golden clothing looked at the old man with respect in their eyes. They immediately bowed their hands, and a young man in the middle spoke.

“Kneel down and tell me. I’ll give you two seconds!”

The old man glanced at them mockingly and said faintly.

The ten or so young men in golden clothing were slightly stunned, and a hint of displeasure flashed in the eyes of the young man in the lead.

“Senior, I Am...”

He cupped his hands once again!

“Keke, you are all ants!”

The hunchbacked old man waved his arm, and a terrifying energy directly attacked downwards.

“No, senior, we are the southern emperor...”

“Ka Ka!”

The group of young men hurriedly shouted with faces full of fear, but before they could finish their words, the dark energy directly descended, instantly killing them!

“Southern Emperor, F * ck!”

The hunchbacked old man muttered as the dark flames in his eyes flashed past.

“Keke, continue. After I kill all of you, I’ll kill those three old things!”

The hunchbacked old man moved. In less than a second, the entire city was filled with endless screams.

Everyone knelt on the ground, shivering as they listened to the screams around them.

“Boss Devil, let me help you. Kill the last three old things. I’ve already killed the rest of the members of the Iceheart Dynasty’s Royal Family!”

“How was it, Boss Devil? My performance wasn’t bad, right?”

The hunchbacked old man shouted as the demonic qi on his body slowly rose. In a short two seconds, his entire body turned into a thousand-meter-wide dark demon.

His figure directly charged into the enormous mushroom cloud.

At this moment, the three patriarchs of the ice heart dynasty inside the mushroom cloud heard his voice, and their bodies trembled violently!

“You... you actually exterminated all of us from the Ice Clan!”

When the three patriarchs heard this news, they were extremely shocked. The Ice clan, an entire ice clan.

For the sake of their entire clan, all of their clansmen had worked hard for tens of thousands of years to establish the current ice heart dynasty.

However, all of them had been annihilated.

“Boom!”

Just as their hearts were burning with fury and they did not dare to accept it, a terrifying demonic shadow directly attacked them!

“Pu!”

The long-haired old man was struck by the Black Shadow and instantly spat out a mouthful of blood!

“We... We are not their match!”

Ice faceless shouted with a face full of terror.

At first, they thought that they could easily kill the sky demon by fighting three against one.

However, when they started fighting, they finally understood what fear was.

The Sky Demon had turned into a terrifying dark creature. When their destructive attacks landed on the opponent, the opponent immediately turned into a light creature.

However, with a heal, all the injuries on their bodies were healed and they turned into dark creatures to fight with them.

This was F * cking cheating.

In the ten minutes of fighting, the other party was not injured at all. On the contrary, every one of them was wounded.

Now, another hunchbacked elder who was much stronger than them had come.

“Fa Wu, we will hold them off. You Go to the lone cult immediately and preserve the roots of the Iceheart dynasty

“In the future, we must take revenge. We must kill them, their families, and all of them!”

The white-bearded old man’s eyes were bloodshot as he shouted at Bing FA Wu.

“Big Brother, I’ll leave it to you. We’ll hold them off for you!”

The long-haired old man’s face was filled with despair.

“Kill, kill them!”

The two patriarchs of the Bingxin dynasty charged at Wang Xian and the stooped old man with all their might.

“Are you desperate?”

The stooped old man showed a look of disdain. “Then go to Hell. How does it feel to provoke our boss demon? TSK TSK!”

He roared with a heart-wrenching voice. The demon figure wrapped around his body opened its terrifying fangs and lunged at the long-haired old man.

Like a demon, it devoured humans.

“Don’t worry. You will all die. It’s just a matter of Time!”

Wang Xian watched as the white-bearded elder charged at Bing Fa Wu with all his might to let him escape. There was no change in his expression.

“If I don’t take revenge, I, Bing FA Wu, will not be a human. I will return the favor with a sea of blood!”

Bing FA Wu roared with bloodshot eyes. As he spoke, he fled into the distance while trembling.

“Hehe!”

Wang Xian smiled disdainfully. His dragon claws crushed the white-bearded elder directly.

“There will no longer be an ice heart dynasty in this world!”

He stared at the Ice Fa Wu who was trying his best to escape dozens of kilometers away and roared coldly.

His voice spread throughout the entire world!
