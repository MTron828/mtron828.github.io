2656 2656 background, battle pet: towering snake

In the past, in the palace disciple competition, if one’s strength reached the eternal God Lord Level 7, one would almost be able to become an emperor’s daughter.

Just like the two emperor’s daughters from the previous generation, they had this strength, and after 5,000 years, they were only at the Pinnacle God lord level.

They were still a step away from the undying emperor level.

However, now that the Emperor Star Lady had displayed the pinnacle god Lord level strength, this meant that she was comparable to the previous emperors.

This could be said to be the difference of 5,000 years.

“How can the Emperor Star Lady Be So Strong?”

“A few years ago, I remember that she was still at God Lord Level 5, could it be that she got some treasure to quickly raise her strength?”

“Either she has been hiding her strength all this while, or she has obtained a huge amount of resources these few years.”

The gazes of the surrounding people flickered as they looked at the Emperor Star Lady, who stood proudly among the heroes.

Facing 19 of the most outstanding disciples of the same generation, she was still able to easily suppress them. It had been a long time since such a powerful disciple had appeared in the imperial court.

“So powerful.”

Di Haosong’s expression kept changing as he looked at the group of Emperor’s daughters. This was his daughter.

If it were any other time, he would be extremely happy. His daughter had become an empress, and she was so powerful.

But now...

His expression slowly darkened.

“Peak Master God!”

The nineteen disciples’expressions kept changing. Di Suyi’s expression darkened as he gripped the snow-white longsword in his hand.

“I admit defeat.”

The Dark Horse woman looked at the Empress who was emitting a powerful aura. She shook her head and retreated.

“I admit defeat too.”

“I admit defeat too.”

Someone took the lead, and another two ladies helplessly shook their heads and retreated to the side.

Peak God lord strength was not something they could contend against.

“What about you guys?”

Emperor star lady slightly raised her head. Her gaze swept over the rest, including the fourteen young men.

“I admit defeat.”

“I truly didn’t expect you to be so strong, di Xing ‘er.”

The few young men shook their heads and retreated to one side.

In an instant, ten men retreated to one side.

“Di Xing ‘er, don’t think that just because you have the strength of a peak God Lord, we are afraid of you. The selection of the Emperor’s daughter tests one’s strength, not one’s realm.”

Di Suyi’s face was filled with unwillingness as she tightly gripped the snow-white longsword in her hand.

“Hua Hua Hua!”

In the next moment, drops of white liquid dripped from her longsword. The liquid slowly condensed into a human figure.

The white human figure directly entered di Suyi’s body.

“Boom!”

In the next moment, an extremely powerful aura burst out from her body.

“This is the battle spirit I obtained. I’ve nurtured it for a thousand years and fused with it. Don’t think that you can suppress everyone just because you have the strength of a peak God Lord. The competition this time isn’t over yet.” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Di Suyi’s body fluttered even though there was no wind, and her aura increased explosively.

“Battle spirit, I didn’t expect di Suyi to obtain such a treasure.”

Some people revealed astonished expressions when they saw di Suyi’s aura increase explosively.

The eyes of all the emperors and princesses twinkled as they watched.

The competition between emperors and princesses was a competition of strength and combat power.

Other than high-tech items that couldn’t be used, everything else could be used.

“Hehe, Emperor Star, you’re dreaming if you want to suppress all of us, even if you’re very strong.”

Beside him, Emperor soul singer took out a wooden staff. Vines extended from the staff and slowly covered his entire body.

“Ka Ka Ka!”

Soon, a similarly powerful aura emanated from his body, not one bit weaker than a peak god Lord.

At the same time, his body grew to over a hundred meters tall under the cover of the vines.

“Come out, Mu Jiu!”

“CHIRP CHIRP!”

However, this was not the end. He waved his staff in front of him, and a ten-meter-tall battle pet suddenly appeared.

The battle pet had a pair of leaf-like wings, and it landed on Di Hun Ge’s huge shoulders.

“He has revealed his trump card. Di Hun Ge has revealed his trump card. A peak god Lord level battle pet and that powerful vine covering his entire body. What kind of treasure is that?”

...

“Hehe, as expected, none of the geniuses of our imperial court are simple.”

“Di Hun Ge’s power is so strong. He has the combat power of a peak god Lord. In addition to that battle pet, his combat power is even stronger than the Emperor Star’s daughter.”

“Although he is relying on external forces, this is still a part of his strength.”

Some people were shocked when they saw the changes in Di Suyi and Di Hun Ge.

Even the Emperor Star’s daughter’s mother’s face was filled with worry.

“HMM?”

A few young men and women saw the changes in Di Hun Ge, and their eyes narrowed.

“Hehe, I didn’t expect the battle to end so soon.”

Di Ming smiled and waved his arm.

Crack! Crack! Crack

Metal appeared in front of him one by one. The metal transformed into a ten-meter-tall giant like a transformer!

...

With a light leap, he jumped onto the transformer’s body!

Puppet!

“All of them are very strong!”

“They all have quite a lot of trump cards!”

The black-robed Jiu di’s eyes flashed with a dark luster.

“Ka Ka Ka Ka Ka.”

Around him, two dark golden skeletons appeared in front of him. The dark golden skeletons emitted a sinister aura.

“Hehe, I’m not satisfied without trying.”

“Di Xingnu, don’t be arrogant too early. In terms of trump cards and foundation, you’re still far from it!”

Di Qingshan waved his arm and a wolf-like battle pet covered in scales appeared beside him!

“Roar Roar Roar!”

That battle pet scanned its surroundings and let out an angry roar. A powerful murderous aura spread out in all directions.

“Silence!”

Di Qingshan shouted softly. The battle pet lowered its head slightly and stood beside him.

“Two powerful battle pets. That dark-gold skeleton is considered a different kind of battle pet. They actually tamed it completely. This...”

“It’s not that they tamed it. It’s just that there are experts and powerful beast tamers who have tamed it over a long period of time. That’s why it can be used like an arm. This requires a long period of assistance. This can be said to be a foundation.”

The group of young men and women who had retreated saw this scene and spoke with some envy.

“Hehe, Celestial Emperor, don’t challenge us so blindly and arrogantly. Also, don’t be so violent and apologize. You Ladies should compete with each other first before fighting. Otherwise, we can only return the favor.”

Di hunge stared at Celestial Emperor and coldly spoke.

Just now, Celestial Emperor embarrassed them, so they naturally wanted to get back at her.

“Humph, I want to see you continue to be arrogant.”

Di Qingshan stared at Celestial Emperor with a gloomy face and said.

“Hehe, as expected of the support of the elders behind us. It’s really different. However, you still don’t have the qualifications to compete with me.”

Celestial Emperor glanced around and slowly half-squatted down. A cold expression appeared on her face!

“Chu snake!”

She shouted in a low voice.

“Hiss, hiss, hiss!”

In the next moment, a huge monster suddenly appeared.
