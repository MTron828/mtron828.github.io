Chapter 1582: One thousand five hundred and eighty-two dead bodies, one thousand miles of blood

“Now, My Bingxin Dynasty announces!”

“Princess Bing Jian ‘er, marry young master ao Tian. Your Parents’orders, Matchmaker’s words!”

“If anyone dares to interfere, My Bingxin dynasty will definitely punish them severely!”

The king of Bingxin cupped his hands at Young Master Ao Tian. His cold gaze swept across Wang Xian as he gritted his teeth and said coldly.

He made the final announcement!

“What Matchmaker’s Words? I Am Jian ‘er’s father. What right does your Bingxin Empire have to be called Jian ‘ER’s parents?”

“Jian ‘er has lost her memory. How long has she been in your Bingxin Empire? Now that Jian ‘er doesn’t agree, what right do you have to force her!”

When Sect Master Ling, who was standing beside Wang Xian, heard King Bing Xin’s words, he revealed an angry expression and roared loudly.

“Let me out! I Won’t marry him! Let Me Out!”

At the Heaven’s pride stage, Ling Jian ‘er brandished the metal longsword in her hand and thrust it heavily towards the formation.

However, the sturdy formation did not have the slightest ripple.

“This... This is really unexpected!”

“Now, the Bingxin Empire is embarrassed. According to what I said, Bing Jian ‘er is not the daughter of the king of Bingxin. Instead, she was brought here by the Patriarch of the Bingxin Empire not long ago!”

“Bing Jian ‘ER is obviously loyal to priest Wang. Now... However, that priest Wang is going to be in trouble. The woman that young master ao Tian wants, he doesn’t have the qualifications at all!” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Everyone around looked on, pursed their lips, and whispered.

“The Bingxin Empire is ungrateful!”

“Today, I, Wang Xian, announce! If Jian ‘er doesn’t leave with me today, I will definitely make your Bingxin Empire bleed for thousands of miles!”

Wang Xian swept his gaze across Ling Jian ‘er and stared at everyone in the Bingxin Empire. His face was filled with killing intent as he announced the same thing.

“Haha, Haha. Pastor Wang, I will give you face and address you as pastor Wang. If I don’t Give You Face, you are nothing in the eyes of our Bingxin Empire!”

“Make My Bingxin Empire bleed for thousands of miles. Do you have the ability to do so? Haha!”

The long-haired elder from the bingxin empire laughed maniacally. A powerful aura that belonged to the eighth level of the Seethrough realm was emitted from his body as he stared at Wang Xian coldly.

The rest of the people from the Bingxin Empire were also staring at Wang Xian with sparkling eyes.

“Haha, this is really interesting. This is really interesting. A radiant priest, a mere radiant priest, actually dares to challenge the Bingxin Empire!”

“You are really arrogant and conceited. Do you dare to challenge the solipsistic sect?”

“Don’t think that just because you saved the Crown Prince of Wuji Empire, you can act recklessly in the vast region. Bingxin Empire, don’t have any scruples!”

“All the consequences will be borne by the solipsistic sect!”

Ao tian laughed maniacally when he heard Wang Xian’s words.

His laughter was filled with disdain. In the end, he promised the Bingxin Empire.

Don’t be afraid of the Wuji Empire. Their only sect is here!

“I want to see how you can make our Bingxin Empire bleed for thousands of miles!”

The long-haired elder flew a few hundred meters forward and looked down at Wang Xian from the sky.

Around them, Bing Fa Wu, the King Bing Qiankun, and the experts from the Bingxin Empire immediately flew into the sky and looked down as well.

“Ao Tian, you want me to marry you? Dream On!”

Ling Jian ‘ER’s cold voice sounded from within the array formation on the Prodigy stage.

“HMPH, you’ll be mine for the rest of your life. Not long from now, our wedding will be held under the watchful eyes of the world!”

“Now, I’ll bring you back to the only sect to take a look. Let’s go, it’s not good to watch that fellow die here!”

Ao Tian saw that everyone was looking in his direction. His expression was not good as he waved his arm.

A hexagram pattern appeared in the sky above the heaven’s pride stage. Both of their figures disappeared instantly.

“Only sect, you are seeking your own destruction!”

Wang Xian saw Ling Jian ‘er who had disappeared into the formation. His eyes slowly turned black.

A violent aura was gathering on his body.

“A mere priest. Get Rid of him as soon as possible. It’s a waste of time!”

A supreme elder of Soli sect said indifferently. He gestured to the supreme elder beside him and leaped into the sky.

He left directly through the long-distance teleportation of the hexagram.

“Remember, a radiant priest. Don’t be so arrogant. Otherwise, you will die!”

The long-haired elder from the Iceheart Empire stared at Wang Xian and said indifferently.

“Kill him!”

As the two of them spoke, they ordered the two people beside them.

“It’s the old ancestor!”

The two powerhouses at level seven of the Seethrough realm nodded and walked out slowly.

“That priest Wang is going to die!”

“Who would have thought that the saint of light would end up like this!”

“He’s too arrogant. He dares to provoke anyone. This time, I’m afraid he’s going to die!”

When everyone saw the enraged Bingxin Empire was about to make a move, their eyes sparkled as they discussed among themselves.

When Wang Xian saw the two seventh-level profound void martial stage powerhouses from Bingxin Empire flying out, he narrowed his eyes slightly.

That kind of violent killing intent caused his eyes to slowly turn pitch-black.

“You will only have face if our Bingxin Empire gives you face. If we don’t Give You Face, you are nothing!”

The two experts at level seven of the Seethrough void tier stared at Wang Xian and said with disdain.

Behind him, Bing Jinghuan was watching this scene with excitement.

“Cough cough, cough cough, I’m finally here. I’m finally here!”

“Priest Wang, save me. Cough Cough, I’ll help you. I’ll help you kill them. I’ll help you bleed thousands of miles and kill everyone!”

At this moment, a hunchbacked old man walked towards Wang Xian with his walking stick.

He swept his gaze across the surroundings and looked at Wang Xian. He forced a smile on his face and said to Wang Xian in a fawning manner.

The two powerhouses at level seven of the Seethrough realm who were about to make a move were slightly stunned. They looked at the old man.

“Who... who is that old man?”

“A cripple? That old man seems to be a cripple. Is there something wrong with his brain? What is he doing here?”

The old man who appeared out of nowhere and was even talking arrogantly made everyone around him slightly stunned.

“You Old Fool who is courting death. Let’s die together with you, priest Wang!”

The two level 7 insightful void martial artists from the Bingxin Empire revealed a hint of cold disdain on their faces.

The staffs and longswords in their hands shot out a violent stream of water and a bone-piercing ice sword. In an instant, they attacked Wang Xian and the hunchbacked old man.

Buzz

Wang Xian looked at the two attacks without any emotion in his eyes. He slowly raised his arm.

A wave of light energy blocked the attack directly.

He turned his head slowly and looked at the hunchbacked old man who was begging to please him.

“I’ll give you a chance to atone for your sins!”

Wang Xian’s dark-haired eyes were filled with violence. He placed his other palm on the old man’s chest.

Buzz

A terrifying demonic aura entered the old man’s body. The Soul of darkness that he released instantly trembled.

“I want to destroy the Bingxin Empire!”

His cold voice was heard by the stooped old man.
