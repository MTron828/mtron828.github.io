Chapter 1605: 1605 Battle of Madness 4

Within the Solitaire Mountains, the closure of the array formation represented the submission of the Solitaire sect.

Two experts at the ninth rank of the profound void tier were facing two experts at the ninth rank of the profound void tier from the solitaire sect, as well as Nangong Jianghe from the southern royal family. There were a total of three experts.

Three against two. Even if they could win, the solitaire sect and Nangong Jianghe would have to pay an extremely heavy price.

This price would at the very least destroy more than half of the sect and at the very most, kill an expert at level nine of the Seethrough void stage.

The price was not something that the sect could bear.

However, what shocked all the experts and disciples of the sect and all the forces in the vast region was that Wang Xian was still staring at all the people of the sect with bloodlust and killing intent.

“Is he crazy? Unless he is injured here, he will not be able to bring peace to the sect. What is the Sky Demon trying to do?”

“My God, injured? What does the Sky Demon Mean? Other than killing him, will he not leave?”

“Isn’t this too violent? For the sake of nearly 100,000 people who died because of him, is the sky demon going to fight the sect to the death?”

In the surroundings, everyone’s forces retreated to a place more than 10 kilometers away. Looking at the sky demon who was still floating in the sky, each and every one of them revealed a horrified expression.

The sect had already given in. What else did the Sky Demon want to Do?

Fight with his life?

But was there a need for that?

This was purely an act of suicide!

“Sky Demon, don’t think that my sect is really afraid of You!”

The supreme headmaster roared at Wang Xian with an unsightly expression. His face was filled with fury.

Streams of green wind whistled and condensed around him. It was like a sign formed by a hurricane.

At the side, Patriarch Fengchi’s expression kept changing as if he was making a huge decision.

As for Nangong Jianghe, who was a thousand meters away, his expression turned even darker.

He never expected that the Sky Demon was also an expert at the ninth level of the Seethrough void tier. Furthermore, he killed all the experts and disciples of the southern royal family in an extremely violent manner.

He had killed them right in front of him.

He clenched his teeth tightly as he looked at the Crazy Sky Demon.

He had never expected to provoke such a crazy person.

Unfortunately, there was no room for regret.

Also, there was that guy who killed his father!

The killing intent on Nangong Jianghe’s body became more and more serious.

“Haha, since you are not afraid, Let’s have a life and death battle. Haha!”

“Today, I will make your lone sect fall into fear!”

Wang Xian stared at Patriarch Fengchi, the supreme sect leader, and laughed maniacally.

He had already consumed the violent blood pill. Wang Xian was already prepared for his body to be damaged. Before he died, he would kill as many people as he could.

After saying that, Wang Xian waved his dragon claw and the Five Elements Millstone appeared above his head.

The five elements millstone within a radius of six kilometers was emitting destructive energy.

“Destroy!”

Wang Xian did not waste any more time talking to them. He raised his head and looked at the great mill of five elements in the sky. Then, he shouted loudly.

Buzz

Streams of terrifying energy headed straight for Ying Tian Peak.

“Good, good. Do you really think that we don’t dare to fight you to the death? Since we are going to kill you, let’s do it. We will not rest until one of us dies!”

Patriarch Fengchi, who was standing at the side, saw Wang Xian’s attack. His eyes revealed a crazed look as he roared furiously.

“We will not rest until one of us is dead. Kill!”

The Supreme Headmaster’s face was filled with malevolence as well. His tyrannical aura was completely unleashed.

As a faction that had stood firm for tens of thousands of years, as a peerless expert who had cultivated to the ninth level of the Seethrough void tier.

They had experienced many life-and-death battles throughout their lives.

They would be filled with fear towards the sky demon and Mo Sha.

However, the sky demon’s continuous provocations and attacks had completely infuriated the two strongest experts of the sect.

Their bodies were also emitting the aura of a life and death battle.

“Dharma Idol, hurricane sweeping the world!”

Patriarch Fengchi let out a furious roar. A hurricane that reached to the sky instantly formed in front of him and headed toward the destructive force of the five elements great mill.

“Dharma Idol, heavenly wind turbulence!”

The supreme headmaster revealed a ruthless expression as he attacked Wang Xian directly.

Gusts of heavenly wind turbulence covered an area of ten kilometers.

In this space, gusts of terrifying wind attribute tore apart the surrounding air.

Even the air was rustling.

“Miss Ling Jian ‘er, be careful here. Boss MO, I’m Coming!”

When Mo Sha saw that Wang Xian was prepared to fight to the death with the sect, he was a little shocked.

However, Mo Sha, who had guessed it beforehand, was not too surprised.

He moved his body and attacked the supreme sect leader directly.

“Nangong Jianghe, help us stop this old fellow. We will kill the Sky Demon and then kill him!”

“Our Supreme sect and the southern royal family are completely United!”

When the supreme sect leader saw Mo Sha’s attack, his expression changed slightly. He immediately shouted loudly.

“Good! Mo Sha, I will definitely kill you for killing my father!”

“Sky Demon, you killed a disciple of my southern royal family. My Southern Royal Family will not rest until you die!”

Nangong Jianghe’s expression changed drastically. A terrifying killing intent slowly shot out of his eyes as he coldly roared.

If Mo Sha wasn’t the person who killed his father, he might not have attacked.

But now, they were irreconcilable and would not rest until one of them was dead!

Kill! who was afraid of whom!

“Hiss, my God, they are really fighting!”

“The battle between the five top-tier profound void tier 9 powerhouses has not happened for nearly 10,000 years, right?”

“It has been over 10,000 years since such a terrifying battle broke out in the vast region!”

“Why does this sky demon want to fight until one of them is dead? If they really fight, only my sect and the southern royal family will win!”

In the distance, everyone looked at the battle that had completely erupted, and their faces were filled with shock. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

They once again retreated more than ten kilometers.

Such a terrifying battle would affect an area of at least fifty kilometers.

“Mo Sha, today, I will personally take revenge for my father!”

Nangong Jianghe stared at Mo Sha, and he directly attacked with destructive flames.

“Dragon Kingdom in the Palm!”

“Dragon head under the Heavens!”

“Ten-thousand-mile Dragon Body!”

Wang Xian let out a furious roar and unleashed all of his dharma forms.

The Dragon Claw, Dragon Head, and dragon body enlarged and transformed into a divine dragon beast that was about ten kilometers long.

Ten kilometers was ten-thousand meters.

A body that was ten-thousand meters long was comparable to the size of a mountain peak in the Solitaire Mountains.

“Boom!”

Wang Xian waved his dragon claw and attacked the supreme sect leader and elder Fengchi with an attack that contained endless power.

“With a body of 10,000 meters, it is comparable to the giant beast of the mistress of the barren sea!”

When they saw Wang Xian in his complete form, the supreme sect leader and elder Fengchi’s expressions changed slightly. All the forces that were watching in the surroundings were also filled with astonishment.

His physique was too terrifying!

Boom! Boom! Boom

Patriarch Fengchi and the supreme headmaster dodged Wang Xian’s Dragon Claw.

That gigantic dragon claw landed on Yingtian Peak.

The entire 10,000-meter-tall peak collapsed immediately!
