Translator: 549690339

“Boom Boom Boom!”

The entire ocean went berserk. A battle between Immortals and gods, each move contained a terrifying energy that could destroy the world.

Especially two immortals who were fighting with their lives on the line.

“Raging flame hibernation!”

The 50-meter-tall flame giant was now only about 40 meters long. The red-masked old man in the middle was filled with malevolence and killing intent.

Both of his hands slammed heavily into the void.

His arms were decreasing at a terrifying speed. The Flames in his body were burning, causing the flames within a radius of seven to eight kilometers to burn.

Boom! Boom! Boom! The Flames exploded in the air!

Wang Xian had a serious look on his face. He clawed at the Fire Giant’s chest with his dragon claws.

The Flames couldn’t cause much damage to it. However, at the same time, the masked old man had protected his body well after being injured once!

The terrifying flames made Ao Qitian afraid to get close to him.

The terrifying attack that was unleashed by burning his own life force would cause ao Qitian’s body to suffer a terrifying attack the moment he entered.

Ao Qitian was standing on top of the fire giant. He was prepared to deal a fatal blow at any time! F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“If you want to kill me, one of you will definitely die with us!”

A tragic look appeared on the masked Elder’s face. “You won’t be able to last until all the flames in my body are completely burned!”

Wang Xian waved his dragon claws expressionlessly and attacked the flaming giant once again.

At the same time, the flames of both parties weren’t able to cause much damage to each other. The only thing they could do was to compare the strength of their physical bodies.

After all, the flames of the flaming giant were condensed from energy. On the other hand, Wang Xian’s physical body was the body of a divine dragon.

His powerful physical body grabbed directly at the flaming giant.

Boom

The fire giant raised his terrifying arm and smashed it forward.

His arm was even larger than Wang Xian’s entire body. With a single strike, a large area of flames on his arm dissipated. However, Wang Xian’s body was also sent flying for a few thousand meters.

“I don’t know how long this fellow has been in the immortal realm. be it his attack techniques or the use of flames, he is simply too powerful!”

A trace of blood appeared at the corner of Wang Xian’s mouth. “However, you still have to die!”

A hint of coldness flashed across Wang Xian’s eyes. In the universe, there were less than three people who could rival the physical body of the Divine Dragon.

Even if he was injured from the impact, he would be able to recover very quickly if he wanted to.

Crack Crack Crack Crack

Wang Xian raised his right claw which was covered by the thick fire liquid. The entire Dragon Claw turned into seven to eight meters in size and charged at the fire giant again.

“Take This!”

At the same time, the demonic aura around ao qitian condensed into a solid form to surround the surroundings for defense. He brandished the metal rod in his hand and smashed it directly at the flaming giant.

Boom

Another terrifying collision of flesh and flesh. At this moment, the Sun had already set. The Flames illuminated a radius of dozens of kilometers like the sun.

“Haha, If You Want to kill me, if you want to kill me, one of you will have to die!”

After a wave of impact, the masked elder’s face turned slightly pale as he roared ferociously.

“Ah!”

“No, no!”

However, at this moment, a scream suddenly came from the side.

A golden light flashed past, passing through the body of the Yanmei two-headed woman.

On the other side, a ten-meter-large turtle shell ruthlessly smashed into the body of the other two-headed woman.

“Although spreading your body apart can unleash more powerful attacks, your defense is much weaker. The Earth attribute is best at defense. You give up your advantage and accelerate your death!”

Prime Minister Gui’s voice was heard. The ten-meter-long turtle shell was emitting earthy yellow energy and had a terrifying suction force.

On top of the turtle shell, sharp earth thorns were attacking nonstop.

“We have no grudges with each other. Why do you want to Kill Us with your life?”

A head whose body had been chopped off shouted with a face full of unwillingness.

“We have no grudges with each other. But why do you want to prevent us from taking revenge? Do you think we are easy to bully?”

Prime Minister Gui’s eyes flickered. He waved his arm, and the turtle shell emitted mountains, rivers, and trees, which pressed down on them.

“Boom!”

The turtle shell pressed down on these two bodies. They fell directly into the ocean and gave off a loud boom when they landed on the seabed!

“There’s still one more!”

Prime Minister Gui looked at the flaming giant. Ao jian pointed the tip of his sword at it.

“Kill!”

Wang Xian shouted coldly. The golden sword was a terrifying mountain peak that condensed into yellow soil in the void. It was a rod that emitted demonic aura!

“Kill, Kill, kill! I want to kill all of you!”

When the red-masked elder saw Ao Jian and Prime Minister Gui killing the two-headed woman, a hint of despair and madness flashed in his eyes.

He roared loudly and the flames on his body instantly turned the area within ten kilometers into a flaming domain.

However, Wang Xian and the rest did not retreat.

Four celestials were attacking one at a time. Furthermore, each of them was in a situation where they were evenly matched. They were completely crushed!

Boom

Wang Xian, Ao Jian, Ao Qitian, and Prime Minister Gui’s attacks arrived. Flames splashed out in all directions.

Tens of thousands of tons of seawater evaporated instantly and turned into mist. Following that, it condensed into clouds in the sky and the rainstorm fell instantly.

The entire process did not take more than a minute.

The flame giant collapsed. The red-clothed masked elder in the middle could not help but spit out blood. His eyes were dim.

“Roar!”

A metal rod with demonic flames smashed into his body. His body fell to the bottom of the sea.

“Phew!”

Wang Xian took a deep breath. He felt exhausted all over.

This battle lasted for a total of about half an hour.

“It’s really hard to kill someone whose strength has reached the level of an immortal God. It takes a lot of strength to attack two people of the same level. I even have to guard against being killed together!”

Wang Xian heaved a sigh of relief. With a thought, he reverted back to his human form.

His entire body was covered in wounds. Each of the wounds was extremely grievous. If he were to use his dragon energy to deplete it, it would be at least a few million dragon energy.

Apart from the injuries on his body, he was also extremely exhausted.

Beside him, ao Qitian was also panting heavily. The blood on his body had already covered his entire body. Most of the blood was his own.

The only one who was not injured was Prime Minister Gui.

The powerful Earth attribute defense and the earth turtle shell on his back made his defense almost invincible.

However, Prime Minister Gui had expended too much energy. The earthy yellow glow on the turtle shell was extremely dim.

“Xiao Xian!”

Xiao Yu, Lan Qingyue, and the others hurriedly flew towards Wang Xian.

Tang Yinxuan, who was standing on the Kun, hesitated for a moment before following them.

She stood on top of a pink-nosed dolphin and followed behind.

Wang Xian had saved her life, causing Tang Yinxuan to feel extremely complicated.

She had a good impression of him when he gave her the zither. Later on, she admired and admired the Dragon King. Later on, the heavenly note sect was destroyed.

Then, she was saved by him today.

“Woo Woo!”

At this moment, Tang Yinxuan suddenly felt a throbbing and panic coming from the pink-nosed dolphin beneath her.

She had felt this feeling not long ago when they were being hunted.

Crisis!
