Chapter 245: Pilgrimage Or Tearing Down The Place (4)

“A second-class force actually has a Saintess? How interesting!”

“I bet that lass from Thistles and Thorns Sect couldn’t take more than three strokes.”

“That Mu Wanwan from Flame Palace seemed to be a Level 7 proficient. I guessed she can beat her in just one or two strokes!”

“Judging from what the Saintess said, they want to teach this lass from Thistles and Thorns Sect a lesson!”

Everyone stared at the field and exchanged views about it.

The elders and attendants from Thistles and Thorns Sect were overwrought. Despite knowing that Xiao Yu had a domineering Inborn Constitution, they were worried, as she was going to face a disciple from Flame Palace.

After all, it had not been long since Xiao Yu began her cultivation, and she did not have any combat experience.

Elder Fang and Sect Leader Tang at the side looked relieved though.

“Hehe!”

Elder Liu revealed a faint smile as he looked at his apprentice with a satisfied look under the large cauldron.

“I’ll let you have a go first, lass!”

Mu Wanwan scorned Xiao Yu with one hand behind her back and another hand holding her belt sword. She raised her eyebrow at her!

“Fine!”

Xiao Yu took a deep breath, grasping the sword in her hand.

This was her first fight and her first real combat experience.

She closed her eyes and recalled the sword movement taught by her teacher and Sect Leader Tang.

“Poot, what is that lass doing? Is she too nervous?”

“Haha, the Saintess of Thistles and Thorns Sect is funny. She is so nervous that she closed her eyes!”

“If such a lass can become a Saintess of Thistles and Thorns Sect, I think they can really disband!”

The spectators around them chortled when they saw how Xiao Yu was behaving.

The Saintess from Thistles and Thorns Sect was amusing!

“I’m going to attack!” Xiao Yu opened her eyes and looked fixedly at Mu Wanwan without any emotion!

“Hehe, lass!” Mu Wanwan shook her head disdainfully.

However, Xiao Yu held her sword and thrust forward with a sharp radiance on her sword edge and a swift movement just like the wind.

Xiao Yu had completely adjusted herself to her peak condition in terms of her speed and strength.

This blow was almost at the peak of an attack from a Level 8 Martial Artist.

“Hur?”

The moment Xiao Yu struck, Mu Wanwan felt as though a lion was coming her way when she looked at the sword propelled at a breakneck speed. Her expression changed abruptly as she quickly put up her block!

Ah!

A horrified shriek cut the air in the field. Mu Wanwan stared with a ghastly look at the sword that had slashed her belly.

A honed sword had slit her clothes, and blood was oozing out from it.

If Xiao Yu had not altered the course of the sword slightly, she could have killed Mu Wanwan instantly!

Shocking!

Everyone watched the stage in disbelief as they could not believe their eyes.

They were stupefied when they witnessed Xiao Yu’s sword slashing the disciple of Flame Palace.

With just a stroke, Xiao Yu had almost killed Mu Wanwan, a Level 7 Martial Artist from Flame Palace, in a split second.

“Swift and mighty move!”

“Her speed and her power are equivalent to a Level 8 Martial Artist!”

“Gosh, the Saintess from Thistles and Thorns Sect is a Level 8 Martial Artist? Unbelievable!”

“An instant kill within one stroke. This young girl is domineering! Incredible!”

“She’s at least a Level 8 Martial Artist. Well, a juvenile who is not even 20 years old possesses a Level 8 strength? Such an intimidating talent!”

“Level 8 Martial Artist! She could jolly reach Inborn Realm in the future. No wonder Thistles and Thorns Sect conferred her as the Saintess of Thistles and Thorns Sect. She has dominating endowment!”

“Her talent is intimidating. Even the Saint and Saintess from Flame Palace were not as gifted as her!”

The atmosphere got heated instantly. They stared in disbelief at Xiao Yu, who had slashed the disciple from Flame Palace in a split second.

Just now, they were still mocking and scoffing at her. The next moment, she made an instant kill. This...

The intimidating talent!

“How is this possible!?”

Even the disciples stared at Xiao Yu with shock.

With a Level 8 strength, she already surpassed many other Flame Palace disciples. The most surprising thing was her endowment!

The faint smile on Saintess Luan Fanghua’s lip slowly disappeared. Her eyes glittered as she fixed her eyes at Xiao Yu with surprise.

The four elders below the large cauldron were taken aback as they looked at Xiao Yu.

A Saintess of Second-class sect at the age of 18 or 19 actually possessed the strength of a Level 8 Martial Artist.

Her endowment was even better than their Saint and Saintess.

“Did I win?” Xiao Yu fixed her eyes on Mu Wanwan, who was horrified, and asked impassively. Her voice was heard throughout the field.

Everyone halted their breathing for a moment and stopped their conversations.

It was so quiet that everyone could hear a pin drop.

“Well, well. What a wonderful Saintess of Thistles and Thorns Sect and Tang Linglong!”

Elder Liu sat under the large cauldron and muttered in a low voice with a gloomy look.

“Elder Liu, she’s just a lass with extraordinary talents. Before she’s a grown-up, she’s still a lass!”

Upon hearing what Elder Liu said, he answered with a dismissive expression.

He stood up slowly and cast a look at Xiao Yu. With a beam, he said, “Very good. The young lady has such an outstanding talent to achieve Level 8 at such a young age!”

“Hur?” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“What’s going on? An elder of Flame Palace praised her personally?”

“Don’t tell me that this elder is fond of talents?”

The surrounding crowd was puzzled as they watched the elder of Flame Palace stand up.

“Wang Yu, right? Well done,” the old man continued his praise. “It would be a waste for this supreme talent to stay in Thistles and Thorns Sect. But after all, you’re a Saintess. Why not this? I’ll make an arrangement today.”

“Since the Saintess of Thistles and Thorns Sect is such a gifted person, we have a disciple who is a descendant of a highly ranked member in Flame Palace. I’ve decided to let Saintess of Thistles and Thorns Sect marry the descendant of Attendant Peng!”

The old man stood beside the giant cauldron and announced this right away.

“What? Does the Flame Palace want to have an allegiance marriage with Thistles and Thorns Sect?”

“If she marries the descendant of a highly ranked member in Flame Palace, wouldn’t Thistles and Thorns Sect be affiliated with Flame Palace. This would be a blessing in disguise!”

Everyone below the stage froze for a moment before they began their discussion frantically again. Some of them envied Thistles and Thorns Sect for having a blessing in disguise.

Yet, the elder’s words stunned the disciples of the Flame Palace.

“The descendant of Attendant Peng? Isn’t he Peng Fengyun? That ugly idiot?”

“To betroth the Saintess of Thistles and Thorns Sect to that idiot, Peng Fengyun, he must be in luck!”

“Tsk tsk, that Saintess of Thistles and Thorns Sect looks pretty. That ugly and silly idiot is really lucky!”

Disciples of the Flame Palace paused for a while before they whispered.

Even though their voices were soft, all the Martial Artists around them could hear them.

When they heard the whispering of Flame Palace disciples, they froze immediately.

To betroth the Saintess of Thistles and Thorns Sect to an ugly and idiotic disciple was obviously an insult!

Nothing was more humiliating than this!
