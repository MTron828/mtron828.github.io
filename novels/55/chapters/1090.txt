“Run! Run away from the west gate! We’re finished! We’re going to die soon!”

“I don’t want to Die! I don’t want to Die!”

“Ahhhh! Get out of the way! Don’t crowd around! Get out of the way!”

“My child! My child!”

When Jin Qianyuan and the others flew over from the east gate, they saw that the place was in chaos.

The people who had gathered at the east gate were waiting for the result. At this moment of despair, some people wanted to escape, some hugged their heads and cried, and some wanted to find their loved ones.

Chaos! Chaos!

Some people were pushed to the ground, and some people’s children and loved ones were pushed away by the crowd! Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Boom! Boom!”

Right at this moment, the sound of the city gate colliding was heard. The violent sound of the collision seemed to have hit everyone’s heart.

The array formation was trembling, and the entire holy sea town was trembling.

“Everyone, calm down!”

Jin Qianyuan’s expression was extremely unsightly when he saw this situation, and he hurriedly shouted.

However, when his voice rang out, it didn’t cause the slightest ripple, and the area below was still in chaos.

At this moment, many people had already sunk into fear.

“Bang!”

All of a sudden, there was a loud sound from the city gate, and a large hole was directly opened. In holy sea town, one could see the densely packed ferocious beasts outside.

“Ah, the city gate has been broken, the city gate has been broken!”

“The ferocious beasts are coming in, they are coming in, hurry up and escape!”

The sudden opening of a large hole in the city gate once again caused all the people to shout out in fear, and one by one, they desperately wanted to escape into the distance.

However, there were too many people, completely blocking everyone. Some people even jumped up and stepped on the heads of people as they fled into the distance.

“Not good, cracks have appeared in the array formation!”

Jin Qianyuan and the others looked at the broken city gate with fear on their faces and despair in their eyes.

“WA wa wa!”

“Ah, my daughter, daughter...”

As the crowd fled, a woman holding a girl was pushed to the ground.

The woman was knocked away and the little girl fell to the ground. The people behind her were still squeezing on the ground.

“AH...”

The little girl felt her legs being stepped on and started crying.

Boom

At this moment, a terrifying pressure suddenly enveloped everyone. Everyone’s body stiffened and even their breathing became sluggish.

Their figures instantly became smaller.

“Little Sister, Are You Alright?”

Wang Xian floated in the air and looked at the cute girl with a ponytail who was lying on the ground. He waved his arm gently and held her hand as they floated in the air.

“What’s the situation...”

The people of Shenghai Town who were enveloped by the powerful pressure revealed a look of fear. Some of them raised their heads in shock.

“Everyone, don’t panic. Shenghai town has not been destroyed yet. Hope has not been destroyed yet!”

Wang Xian, who was floating in the sky, shouted in a deep voice.

His voice entered everyone’s ears like thunder.

Everyone was stunned. They raised their heads and looked at Wang Xian who was in the sky.

“Huh?”

The president of the Jin Gan Yuan and the Employment Association was slightly stunned. He looked at Wang Xian with a look of astonishment.

“It’s not that the ferocious beasts and demonic beasts outside can not be resisted. With me and Mayor Jin around, we didn’t escape. We didn’t give up. This battle is worth fighting!”

“Escaping will only lead to death. There is still hope in this battle. Everyone, all the strong ones, follow me and continue to defend. Protect your homes and protect your loved ones!”

Wang Xian looked down at everyone and shouted in a deep voice.

“Bang Bang!”

“Crash!”

At this moment, the ferocious beasts outside the city seemed to have sensed resistance. There was an intense sound coming from the city gate!

The city gate, which was more than 200 meters wide and dozens of meters tall, broke open, revealing the densely packed ferocious beasts outside.

Their eyes revealed a bloodthirsty glow as they looked at everyone in Shenghai Town.

Everyone looked over hurriedly. At this moment, the people who had stabilized Wang Xian’s heart started to panic again.

“If you don’t want to die, don’t want your home to be destroyed, and don’t want your loved ones to die, then let’s fight! Let’s Fight!”

“This battle is worth fighting!”

Wang Xian saw the broken city gate and waved his arm. The fire dragon bead that had been nurtured all this while was covered with terrifying flames.

The fire dragon bead was only at level five transcendence. It could not amplify his attack at all.

However, Wang Xian did not want to amplify it.

The fire dragon bead flew towards the city gate and instantly turned into a fire god Dragon that was 20 to 30 meters in size.

The Fire Dragon God rushed out from the city gate and attacked the ferocious beasts at the city gate.

The powerful flames caused all the ferocious beasts at the city gate to die.

The shocking attack shocked everyone in Shenghai town.

“Commander Wang is a powerhouse. He is not a member of Shenghai town, but he is fighting for us. Are we going to run away in a panic now?”

“Running away will lead to unexpected death. Only by fighting can we survive. Even if we die, we must protect our homes and family. All the citizens of Holy Sea Town, follow me, Jin Qianyuan. Fight!”

Jin Qianyuan was grateful and excited when he saw Wang Xian making a move. He roared loudly.

“Fight!”

The President of the Mercenary Association and the rest who were beside Jin Qianyuan shouted loudly.

“Fight! Fight!”

“Even the mayor didn’t escape. We are a bunch of people who are about to die. Why should we run? Fight, even if it means death!”

“Fight, even if it means death, we will die gloriously!”

The eyes of the young, middle-aged, and old men in Shenghai town gradually became firm as they shouted loudly.

“Everyone, return to the city wall immediately and fight!”

Wang Xian roared loudly. With a gentle wave of his arm, the girl flew directly to her mother’s side.

He looked outside the city gate and saw many ferocious beasts surging towards the city gate once again.

“Fight!”

Wang Xian smiled and transformed into a ray of light.

Boom

He rushed over from the city gate. His entire body was emitting blazing flames.

The Phantom of the Fire God Dragon appeared around him and rotated around him, making him look extremely majestic.

Wang Xian rushed out of the city gate and immediately saw the countless ferocious beasts around him.

He also saw the group of ants that were about to die as they hovered in the air like kings.

Wang Xian’s gaze swept across the group of Demonic Beasts. His demonic eyes were filled with coldness.

“Today, I will show you what it means to rule the world!”

Wang Xian flew into the air.

Dragon transformation!

“Roar!”

A majestic roar sounded in the sky above Shenghai town. A 35-meter-long fire dragon with flames burning all over its body appeared in front of everyone.

This was the first time Wang Xian fought with the body of a divine dragon in front of everyone’s eyes.

“Boom!”

The pressure of a divine dragon instantly filled the area in front of the east gate of Shenghai Town.

Below, all the wandering sirens below transcendent level seven were lying on the ground, trembling.

This was the suppression of the powerful divine dragon, the ruler of the ocean.
