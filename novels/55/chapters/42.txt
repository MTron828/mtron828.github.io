Chapter 43: Looking for Top-quality Ingredients

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

“I didn’t expect that you would look like a boss when you are really one.”

After talking to Manager Huang and the main chef, Guan Shuqing beamed at the serious Wang Xian.

“Haha, really? Do I look like a professional?” Wang Xian chuckled and asked in vain.

“Yes, a little. Looks like you’re going to be busy in the next few days. Where are you going to find top-quality ingredients? Do you want me to go with you?” Guan Shuqing asked him with a smile.

“Not really. You have to run around to find them. Besides, the weather is hot. You will stay in the shop and keep a tab on my money.” Wang Xian looked at her smilingly.

“Well, what’s the matter with that? I can take hardship well.” Guan Shuqing rolled eyes at him.

“I still cannot allow the belle of the University of Rivertown to run around outside and get tanned. Otherwise, I am committing a sin by doing so. I have ways to get those top-quality ingredients. Don’t worry. You’ll get food-tasting first after I got them.”

Wang Xian spoke with a smile.

“You better be careful if you’re asking me to try. I’ll eat so much that your restaurant might go bankrupt,” Guan Shuqing said with some slyness.

“Haha, if you really did it, then I have nothing to say.” Wang Xian said with a smile.

“I’ll be leaving in a while. Later, you’ll learn the daily revenue and expenses from Manager Huang. After which, check on the inventory. I’ll need you to look after my money in the future.”

He continued joking.

“Sure, go get busy.” Guan Shuqing nodded to him.

“Okay, I’ll give you your wage in advance. Let me know if you need more in the future.”

Wang Xian stood up and fished for his phone. He transferred $10,000 to her through WeChat.

Guan Shuqing took out her phone immediately when she heard it buzz.

However, Wang Xian took away her phone and received the money on her behalf. He smiled and said, “If you work for me, you’ll get to enjoy life.”

Wang Xian returned her phone to her and spoke teasingly.

Guan Shuqing froze for a moment as she looked at the transaction on her WeChat. With a slight blush on her cheek she said, “Hmph, that would depend on my mood too. If the boss is nasty, I’ll quit too.”

“Okay, I’m leaving.” Wang Xian grinned and waved to Guan Shuqing.

“Get going,” Guan Shuqing looked at him and said.

“Director Wang, see you. I’ll take care of everything in the restaurant.” On seeing that Wang Xian was about to leave, Manager Huang immediately walked over and saw him off.

“Okay, call me if there’s anything. Work together with Guan Shuqing too.” Wang Xian nodded.

“Rest assured, Director Wang.” Manager Huang nodded.

After he left First-grade Restaurant, Wang Xian rode his Harley motorcycle to the seaside while thinking of ways to fish for the seafood.

The restaurant required top-quality ingredients every day. Hence, he would need a large volume of seafood.

There were many top-rated seafoods available in the domestic waters.

Take lobster as an instance. Those who knew something about seafood would understand that the Australian lobsters were one of the average-priced lobsters.

However, the price was jacked up to $200 to $250 for every catty in recent years. [1]

Within China, several kinds of lobsters were more expensive than Australian lobsters like the Scalloped Spiny lobsters, Ornate Spiny lobsters, and Striped Spiny lobsters.

But too many locals were foodies. Hence, the number of lobsters in China’s domestic waters were left with very few of them. As such, they were too overpriced.

In particular, the Chinese Ornate Spiny lobsters, also known as the Divine Lobsters or the Rainbow Lobsters, were jacked up to $5,000 to $6,000 for every 4 to 5 catties.

In addition to the lobsters, the Wild Giant Yellow Croaker fish, and Chinese Bahaba fish found in China were expensive as well.

3 catties of Wild Giant Yellow Croaker would cost about $8,000 to $12,000 for every catty.

While the Chinese Bahaba fish cost a few million for each, its fish gelatine could fetch a scary price of hundreds of thousands of dollars.

These fish could be found in the nearby waters around the country, but it had become so scarce that it was hard to find one in a few years.

“If I can catch fish like Wild giant Yellow Croakers and Chinese Bahaba fish, it would give us some great publicity.”

Wang Xian pondered to himself. Very soon, he came to the seaside. He parked his Harley motorcycle at the side and walked to a remote spot.

He took off his clothes. With a swift movement, Wang Xian jumped into the water.

“Transform into Dragon.”

Splash!

In just a move, Wang Xian turned into a two-meters long Divine Dragon. The Divine Dragon exuded strong and powerful strength as it swished its tail and dived into the ocean.

I’ll check out the Clam Girl first. She should have some transformation after the two-days cultivation, Wang Xian thought to himself and headed to the spot where the Clam Girl was.

The golden tail swung, surging strong currents. On seeing Wang Xian swimming over, some of the surrounding marine animals were shuddering and dared not move.

Some even fled in terror.

Soon, Wang Xian arrived around the remote island in the middle of the ocean, sensing the position of the Clam Girl.

Moving his body, he swam to the Clam Girl.

Queen Clam: Level Six

Art of Cultivation: Water Dragon Transformation

Superpower: Ability to control clam race whose level is lower than own existing level; Water Control

“No changes to her level, but she has cultivated her own Superpower. She can control her own kind whose level is lower than hers, and water.”

Wang Xian was surprised to see the Clam Girl’s attributes. On top of that, the name of the Clam Girl was changed to Queen Clam.

“Dragon King!”

Sensing Wang Xian’s arrival, the Clam Girl opened its shell and revealed the flesh inside.

He was surprised to find that the flesh had gradually become humanoid. However, there were no limbs and face except for a simple embryonic form.

Does that mean the Clam Girl will change into a human when her level gets higher?

Wang Xian secretly thought to himself. He looked at the Clam Girl and commanded, “Clam Girl, show me your water control ability.”

“Yes, Dragon King!”

After sending the message to the Clam Girl, he found that the water around him began to surge.

The surge was extremely powerful. Soon, he noticed that the sea water at the bottom of the ocean began to freeze.

Boo!

At this time, he saw a solidified water body appeared beside the Clam Girl. With her mind control, the ball of water was hurled forward.

The ball of water was thrown off on the boulder at the side, leaving a dented mark on it.

“Not bad, the Clam Girl possesses a fair strength now. With her sturdy clamshell, the sharks might not necessarily be able to beat her.”

“Follow me to the sea farther out,” Wang Xian ordered the Clam Girl.

“Yes, Dragon King.”

Wang Xian nodded. He took the Clam Girl to the waters farther out.

To his surprise, the Clam Girl was moving at a breakneck speed. Her water control ability allowed her to control the flow of water around her and accelerate her pace.

“She just cultivates on the Water Dragon Transformation. As time goes by, she will be more powerful than now.”

Wang Xian looked and sped forward.

A golden Divine Dragon, along with an odd and huge sea clam, were swimming freely in the vast ocean. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎
