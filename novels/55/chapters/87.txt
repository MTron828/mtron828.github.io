Chapter 88: Feared Like A Demon, Revered Like A God

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

“Young Master Wang, Young Master Wang. I didn’t know it was you. I have nothing to do with this! It’s all these damned guys who offended Young Master Wang. I have nothing to do with them!”

“Young Master Wang, I’ll apologize to you. We are at fault in this incident. I’ll apologize!”

Wang Xian had initially wanted to wait for the person Director Cui had called before calling Old Qin or trying to settle it by himself. However, it was beyond his expectations that the person who came was Ren Anzhi.

He naturally remembered him very clearly.

He was from the Ren Family. Previously, he was asked by Longxuan Restaurant to burn down his First-grade Restaurant. At that time, he was crippled by Mo Qinglong directly.

What he had never expected was that Director Ren, whom Director Cui was talking about, was none other than Ren Anzhi.

Seeing Ren Anzhi kneel down beside him, on the verge of tears, Wang Xian was speechless.

Am I so scary?

Is it fine for a guy to act like this?

If Ren Anzhi knew what Wang Xian was thinking currently, he would definitely cry out loud. How is he not afraid?

Not only are you horrifying, but you are also the embodiment of the devil!

Damn it. With a half-step to an Inborn expert as subordinate, how horrifying your background is. A single kick from you is sufficient to finish off the Ren Family.

If I let my father know that I just offended this devil again, I’ll probably be killed by him.

“I was wondering who Director Cui would call. So, it happens to be someone I know.”

Wang Xian looked at Ren Anzhi. He rubbed his nose and found this to be a little hilarious.

“Young Master Wang, I didn’t know it was you either. If I knew, I wouldn’t have dared to come, even if you beat me to death... I wouldn’t dare to...”

Ren Anzhi was shivering as he broke into tears.

“Since we know each other, I believe this matter could be settled easily.”

Wang Xian looked at him, smiled and squatted down.

“Young Master Wang, we are at fault in this. I’ll apologize. I’ll kill Director Cui as apology. Please calm down!”

Ren Anzhi trembled at the sight of Wang Xian squatting down. He was completely petrified!

At the other end, Director Cui, who got slapped so hard that he bled, finally started to recover from the shock.

However, when he heard what Ren Anzhi said, he blanked out and lost consciousness.

The security guards around couldn’t help but swallow their saliva as they witnessed this unbelievable twist of events.

When Young Master Lin and the beautiful girl beside him saw this, their eyes were in a daze and their faces paled.

Even Xiao Yu and Xiao Mi were dumbfounded.

Wang Xian looked around before turning to Ren Anzhi. “I’m not an unreasonable man. You can be the judge for me.”

“Young Master Wang, please carry on. Please carry on,” Ren Anzhi replied immediately.

“Yeah, this is how it happened. I brought my sister here to buy a car and we had our eyes on a pink Bentley. After trying it out for several rounds and making the decision to buy it, Director Cui told me that the car has been sold.”

“He said that the car was pre-booked by that Young Master Lin and wouldn’t sell to me. However, it was clear that at the moment we were trying out the car and had confirmed that we wanted to buy it, this car wasn’t sold yet. In other words, I wanted to buy it first but he sold it to another person. Tell me if you would be angry about it if you were me?”

“Moreover, Director Cui wasn’t apologetic at all and asked me to get out. That Young Master Lin and the beautiful girl beside him even said that I was arrogant, I was courting death and was uneducated. Hehe. Tell me now, can you blame me for what I’ve done?”

“I can’t, I can’t blame you. We are at fault in this. Young Master Wang, I’ll definitely give you an explanation that you could be satisfied with!”

When Ren Anzhi heard Wang Xian finish his illustration, he gritted his teeth and replied quickly. He repeated, “Young Master Wang, I’ll definitely give you an explanation you could be satisfied with. Rest assured, it’s those damned brats who have not followed the rules!”

“Yeah, they are the one who did not follow the rules. I’m not an unreasonable person!”

Wang Xian smiled, nodded his head and extended his hand over to pat Ren Anzhi’s shoulders.

“No, No... Young Master Wang, please don’t...”

When he saw Wang Xian extending his hand over, he thought that Wang Xian was meting out punishment. His face paled as he begged for forgiveness.

However, he suddenly felt a warming feeling from his Elixir Field. To his pleasant surprise, he noticed that his Elixir Field was recovering gradually.

This made him stare at Wang Xian in disbelief.

“I’m a very reasonable person. As long as you don’t offend me, I wouldn’t offend you!”

Wang Xian patted on his shoulders and smiled.

Ren Anzhi felt the power returning to his body. His face turned red in agitation and his mucus was almost spit out.

“Thank you, Young Master Wang. Thank you! Young Master Wang!”

Ren Anzhi was kowtowing to Wang Xian. He was unexplainably agitated as he had not expected that this devil in front of him... No... This god-like young man could heal his Elixir Field.

He had never expected this to end in such a fortunate way.

Wang Xian smiled, stood up and signalled for him to stand up.

Ren Anzhi stood up immediately and stood beside Wang Xian with his head lowered like a servant.

“For these Bentleys that I’ve smashed, put it on the tab of Director Cui and that Young Master Lin. Also, Young Master Lin and the beautiful girl beside him threatened me, saying that I wouldn’t even know how I died. Hehe. I leave them to you.”

Wang Xian smirked as he turned his attention to Young Master Lin and the girl beside him.

“Rest assured Young Master Wang, leave this matter to me. I’ll definitely not disappoint you.”

Ren Anzhi lifted his head and guaranteed solemnly. “Since they dare to offend Young Master Wang, I’ll let them know what is meant by not knowing how one died!”

Ren Anzhi was speaking very loudly. Young Master Lin and the beautiful girl beside him could definitely hear him clearly.

When they met Ren Anzhi’s murderous stare, they felt a shudder down their spine and were petrified.

“Young Master Ren, Young Master Ren... Don’t... It’s our fault... Please Young Master Ren!” Young Master Lin’s voice was trembling and he looked horrified.

Ren Anzhi looked coldly at Young Master Lin, smirked and said, “How dare you offend Young Master Wang and behave arrogantly in front of him. Just wait and see. We will have a good time together! ”

“Young Master Ren, you can’t do this to me. It’s my fault. Young Master Wang, Young Master Wang, it’s all my fault. I didn’t recognise that it was you. I deserve death!” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

When Lin Feng heard the words of Ren Anzhi, he was completely flustered. He looked towards Wang Xian in horror. In his eyes, this young man was the equivalent of a devil.

He was petrified. Even Young Master Ren kneeled down in front of him and begged for forgiveness. Just a word from Wang Xian was enough to make Young Master Ren decide to mess with him.

Looking at how Young Master Ren behaved, he might very well be killed.

His body was trembling as he begged for forgiveness.

The beautiful girl beside him had turned as white as sheet and her whole body was shivering. Who the hell did I offend?

Wang Xian glanced at them without emotions.

In the eyes of those who offended him, Wang Xian was feared like the devil. Similarly, he could also make others revere him like a god.

All of this depended on his mood.

If he was in a bad mood, he could cripple Ren Anzhi. Ren Anzhi’s actions made him satisfied and he could cure him with a wave of his arm.

Feared like a devil and revered like a god.

With regard to the control he had, Wang Xian enjoyed it greatly. Your life or death is all in my hands!

Everything shall be as I wish!
