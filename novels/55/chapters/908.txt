Chapter 909: 0910 was easily killed

Translator: 549690339

Ten thousand meters under the sea, in front of a underwater mountain, a group of more than ten people stood in front of a devil den.

At the entrance of the Devil Den, a golden swordfish stood there, expressionlessly staring at the dozen people in front of it.

“Hehe, I really don’t know why a small two-star bronze mercenary group has so many spiritual stones!”

The woman next to the middle-aged captain sized up the Golden Swordfish.

“Are your other members nearby? Call them over!”

The middle-aged captain revealed a greedy look.

A 2-star bronze mercenary group and a young captain who could take out eight million spirit stones.

Perhaps this mercenary group and that young man weren’t simple, but after seeing their strength, greed rose in their hearts.

The group of young men holding longswords only had the strength of a rank 3 transcendent, so what was there to be afraid of?

To be able to reach this step, they not only possessed courage, but also decisiveness.

“My companions are all around. They heard your voice just now, they should be rushing over soon!”

The Golden Swordfish looked around and said to the group of over ten people with a smile.

“Are you very confident?”

The middle-aged captain saw the expression of the golden swordfish and narrowed his eyes slightly. He swept his gaze around and gestured to the people around him.

The members of the Mirage Sea mercenary group nodded slowly and dispersed.

“Mirage Sea mercenary group, do we have any enmity with you?”

Wang Xian walked over and swept his gaze across all of them as he asked expressionlessly.

At this moment, the golden swordfish in the surroundings also flew over and stared at all of them with an expressionless face.

The middle-aged captain didn’t say anything. He sized up Wang Xian and the rest again and again before he slowly narrowed his eyes.

“There’s no enmity!”

The middle-aged captain said with a smile.

“Then why are you surrounding our team members?”

Wang Xian smiled when he saw how vigilant they were.

As expected of a seasoned mercenary group. They didn’t even make a move under such circumstances.

“Attack!”

All of a sudden, the middle-aged captain moved and gave the order to attack Wang Xian.

“It’s really...”

Wang Xian shook his head slowly when he saw their attack.

“PFFFT! PFFFT! PFFFT!”

The sound of penetration was heard. The expression of the middle-aged captain who had just leaped up changed drastically.

When he turned his head around, a terrifying white figure appeared beside his subordinate.

A weapon as sharp as a sickle directly killed them.

“Pu!”

Before he could react, a sharp claw directly pierced through his body, causing his eyes to widen as he looked at the smiling youth.

“This kind of creature? The spirit stones on his body, could it be?”

Suddenly, before his death, a thought flashed across the middle-aged man’s mind. Following that, he widened his eyes. His eyes were filled with disbelief.

“The Dragon Assassin Organization!”

He widened his eyes and growled in a low voice with a face full of shock.

Following his words, blood kept spurting out of his mouth.

Wang Xian moved his arm and stored their corpses into his interspatial ring.

These were rare nutrients.

“Let’s go, let’s continue. Clean up this area within five days!”

Wang Xian said to the members of the Dragon Palace before returning to his original position.

Wang Xian did not care about the more than ten people from the Mirage Sea mercenary group. Since they were seeking death, Wang Xian would not be merciful either.

They continued to advance forward. With Wang Xian and the rest’s abilities, their speed was extremely fast.

It had been two to three years since many mercenary groups had come to the Black Sea region. This caused the number of jellyfish to increase.

There were quite a number of celestial star grass and Heaven Billow grass.

“I wonder how the mercenary groups will react when they discover that there are no jellyfish when the celestial star grass and Heaven Billow grass are available in Shenghai Town!”

Wang Xian smiled when he thought of this. However, this didn’t have much of an impact.

Both the celestial star grass and the heaven billow grass were used for detoxification and detoxification. They could be used in many places, not just in the Black Sea region.

Wang Xian and the rest were very fast. Within two days, they had swept across an area of more than 20 kilometers.

It was only on the third day when they were close to the central region that their speed slowed down.

“It’s going to be troublesome now!”

Wang Xian looked ahead. In front of him was an endless mountain range. The demon caves in the mountain range were no longer just a dozen meters or 20 to 30 meters deep like before.

Here, the demon caves were completely connected together. They were densely packed like a demon palace.

The entrance of each cave was about four to five meters in size. There were jellyfish beasts of supernatural level four and five living inside!

“No wonder there are no extraordinary level six or seven experts to clean up the Black Sea. The jellyfish beasts here can make a fortune!”

Wang Xian entered the Devil’s Cave and looked at the passageways that extended in all directions. He raised his eyebrows.

The entire mountain range was completely cleared. He had no idea how many jellyfish beasts were inside.

Moreover, even if ao Yaoyao entered, she would feel dizzy inside. This was not a problem of perception. There were simply too many passageways!

“It seems like Ao Yao and Ao Jian can only stay behind me!”

Wang Xian had the light and dark fire dragon eyes. With the penetration of the eye of the Heavenly Dragon, he could push forward directly.

Even so, he still had to mark the road.

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian swept his gaze across the area and noticed that there were four to five jellyfish beasts gathered at a distance of more than 500 meters. He moved his body and rushed over immediately.

From the perspective of the Dragon Eyes of light and dark fire, it was a distance of 500 meters. However, there were a few caves that needed to be circled. In fact, the distance was more than 500 meters.

When Wang Xian and the rest got closer, the five jellyfish that were lying on the ground instantly stood up vigilantly.

Out of the five jellyfish, three of them were nearly four meters in size while the rest were more than two meters in size.

Chirp! Chirp

The largest jellyfish in the middle let out a low growl. The other four jellyfish instantly attacked Wang Xian and the rest. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

PFFFT! PFFFT! PFFFT

However, in an instant, streams of white light flashed and the four jellyfish were instantly killed.

Chirp! Chirp

When the other jellyfish saw the rapid death of its companion, a look of fear appeared in its eyes.

It opened its mouth and a thick, ink-colored poisonous fog directly covered Wang Xian and the rest.

Meanwhile, this jellyfish was fleeing frantically towards the back.

“If you can’t beat it, then run. Even if it’s a ferocious beast, it will still possess powerful instincts when its level is higher!”

Wang Xian looked at the escaping jellyfish. He raised his eyebrows and moved his arm.

A thorny bush emerged from the ground and completely wrapped around its body.

“Bang!”

The thorny bush entered the body of the jellyfish and easily killed it.

“Let’s go, continue!”

Wang Xian moved his body and walked forward again, leaving marks in the places he passed by.

The members of the Dragon Palace were observing the star grass and the Heaven Billow grass.
