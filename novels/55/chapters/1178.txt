Chapter 1179: 1180 versus the Void interpretation ferocious beast

Translator: 5496903

“This won’t do. I still can’t control it well. The fire attack is overflowing!”

Wang Xian frowned slightly. A contemplative look appeared on his face. Following that, he shook his head slowly.

“I should continue on my journey. I’ll think about it as I Walk!”

Wang Xian thought to himself. Following that, a smile appeared on his face.

This little bit of inspiration and nearly two days of consideration and contemplation had increased his skills by more than ten times.

The increase in his skills brought about an increase in his attacks.

The current Wang Xian was more than twice as strong as the him two days ago.

Now, his casual attack was several times stronger than before.

“I feel that even if I don’t turn into a divine dragon, I still have the qualifications to fight against an insightful void martial artist!”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and a satisfied look appeared in his eyes.

He was in a great mood. He took out the map and flew forward again.

The human-demon graveyard was located at the center of the Liuhai District. Wang Xian was only traveling about one-fifth of the distance.

This was also because he had been flying for 24 hours without any rest or sleep.

He continued to fly forward. This time, he didn’t fly at full speed. Instead, he was constantly thinking about the combination of attributes.

This was especially so for one of the offensive methods he was researching — starburst.

Starburst, fire, metal, and earth combination attack, AOE attack.

It was an attack that he came up with based on the explosion of meteorites and planets.

If he could come up with this starburst, Wang Xian felt that its offensive power should not be weaker than the dual-attribute divine ability of the fire territory.

As he continued to fly forward, Wang Xian continued to rehearse the combination of the three attributes in his mind.

“Pagoda Pagoda Pagoda!”

Just as Wang Xian was thinking and flying forward, the sound of a pagoda pagoda suddenly came from the void in front of him.

It was as if there was a terrifying existence stepping on the void. The sound was dull and loud.

The dull sound woke Wang Xian up. He quickly looked towards the source of the sound.

“What’s That?”

When Wang Xian looked to his right, his pupils contracted slightly. A look of shock appeared in his eyes.

It was a ferocious beast. Its entire body was emitting purple lightning. Countless lightning bolts were densely packed within a 20-meter radius around it.

With every step it took, the purple lightning bolts around it would emit a special sound.

“Spirit Purple Qilin!”

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered as he looked at the void interpretation level ferocious beast that was flying towards him at a rapid speed. Hesitation appeared on his face.

The Spirit Purple Qilin was a ferocious beast at the first level of the void interpretation level. It wasn’t big and was only four meters in size.

Its head was like a mythical qilin with two purple wings.

Its body was like a lion with purple fur.

If it didn’t have two one-meter-long tusks, the spirit purple qilin wouldn’t look so imposing.

However, the two huge tusks had destroyed its imposing manner, making it look ferocious and ferocious.

It had a pair of purple eyes and was charging forward proudly.

As a ferocious beast at the insightful void tier, very few people dared to provoke such an existence.

While Wang Xian was hesitating, the spirit purple qilin, which was thousands of meters away, was already walking towards him.

When it saw Wang Xian in front of it, it didn’t hesitate at all. It raised its head slightly and aimed its two huge tusks at him.

Crack! Crack

Two purple tusks, which were one meter long, emitted purple thunderbolts that seemed to have substance as they attacked Wang Xian directly.

“Since I’m attacking, let’s test my current strength!”

Wang Xian looked at the purple lightning bolts that were attacking him. His eyes were filled with a strong fighting spirit.

He waved his arm, and ice and fire shot out with his fingers.

Ice, which caused white fog to appear in the void, collided with the extremely hot flames. When the two energies, which were condensed to the extreme, collided, a terrifying explosion was produced.

Boom

The two bolts of lightning, which were as sharp as purple fangs, dissipated instantly under the extreme explosion of ice and fire.

The explosion of fire and water caused a huge white fog to rise in the air.

The white fog covered an area of a thousand meters.

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes, which were flashing with light.

He waved his arm, and an ocean appeared out of thin air in front of him that covered an area of two thousand meters.

The depth of the ocean was about five meters, and the seawater was emitting a terrifyingly high temperature.

This was boiling water.

Following that, Wang Xian waved his other hand again. Streams of flames entered the boiling water directly.

Combination skill: extremely hot sea of water!

“Roar!”

The Ling Zilin, which was charging towards Wang Xian, let out a painful scream the moment it came into contact with the extremely hot sea of water.

Its body was instantly covered by thick purple lightning bolts. Terrifying Bolts of lightning struck towards the extremely hot water sea.

With each attack, a large area of the extremely hot water sea dissipated.

“Explode!”

“Boom Boom Boom!”

Wang Xian instantly converted the water energy, turning it from extremely hot to extremely cold.

The Flames collided with the extremely cold and let out a terrifying explosion sound again.

This time, the explosion covered an area of about two kilometers. The terrifying explosion caused Ling Zilin’s body to fly backward.

The terrifying energy left a long scar on his head.

“Good. The attack power of the combination skill can completely threaten a ferocious beast at the first level of the Seethrough realm. If I transform into a divine dragon, this fellow might not be my match!”

Wang Xian looked at Ling Zilin who was sent flying backward and revealed an excited expression.

“Roar!”

However, at this moment, Ling Zilin revealed a ferocious expression.

A human who looked like an ant to him was actually able to injure him lightly. Ling Zilin was extremely furious.

His entire body condensed into a terrifying lightning bolt which covered the surroundings like a ten-meter-long terrifying lightning beast.

Its body moved and turned into rays of purple light. In an instant, it attacked Wang Xian.

“This should be the supernatural ability of the spirit purple qilin!”

Wang Xian focused his mind slightly. With a move of his arm, the lightning struck wood appeared in his hand.

“Golden Wood Explosion!”

He pointed with his arm and a wooden spear that was emitting golden rays of light went straight for it.

It exploded in front of the spirit purple qilin and rays of golden rays of light attacked it.

Crack! Crack

Roar! Roar

However, when his attack landed on the purple lightning around Ling Zilin, the Golden Light couldn’t penetrate it at all.

Wang Xian’s expression changed slightly. He looked at Ling Zilin who was charging at him with a loud roar. He quickly raised his arm.

“Earth Dragon Shield!”

The Divine Dragon Earth Dragon Shield was released. However, it collapsed instantly under Ling Zilin’s attack.

His body moved, and he hurriedly dodged to the side.

“The wood realm descends, bind!”

“Fire Dragon Flame, Burn!”

His expression didn’t change, and he instantly cast two divine abilities.

The wood realm appeared above Ling Zilin’s head, and the Flames instantly burned.

This wasn’t a perfect combination of divine abilities, but it could still increase the power of the divine ability by 20-30% .

“Roar!”

However, when the wood realm descended and surrounded the spirit purple qilin, it opened its mouth and raised its head to roar.

The surrounding purple lightning started to spin, and all the trees instantly disappeared.

Only the flame of the Fire Dragon landed on the spirit purple qilin’s body, causing the surrounding purple lightning to immediately disappear!
