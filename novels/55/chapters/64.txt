Chapter 65: Evolution: Five-elements Divine Dragon (1)

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

Dragonians were also known as the Dragon Servants.

Dragonians represented the power of the Divine Dragon in the human world.

The purity in Dragonians’ bloodline would determine the limitation of their strength and capability.

It was rare for Divine Dragons to develop into Dragonians except for those dragons with low purity bloodlines or the offspring of Divine Dragons and humans.

Dragonians were powerful. Those that attained great achievements in their cultivation could even transform from humans into dragons.

Of course, it was an arduous thing to do so.

The development of Dragonians and marine animals was somewhat similar. The only difference was the speed of their cultivations. Not only did the Dragonians cultivate slower than the marine animals, but they also had to cultivate according to their own physique conditions.

That is, they had to work step by step by cultivating their eight extraordinary meridians first.

However, this was not required from the Divine Dragons. Divine Dragons just needed to absorb Dragon Energy to evolve and strengthen their physical bodies.

That is to say, the human cultivation technique was invalid for Wang Xian. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Gazing at the old man who was at the verge of his death, Wang Xian stretched out his hand. The golden drop of blood which appeared in his palm dripped on his glabella.

Suddenly, the head of the old man jerked.

“If you wish to live, absorb it, and don’t resist it!” Wang Xian said to the old man upon seeing his resistance.

The old man calmed down, and the blood of the Divine Dragon entered his brain.

An agreement was formed, and the old man had to serve Wang Xian as his Master from now on.

“Let’s heal him first!” On seeing the completion of the contract, Wang Xian smiled and placed his palm against the chest of the old man.

Streams of immense Dragon Energy entered his body.

The old man was obviously stretching himself way too far as all his internal organs were barely functioning. Hence, his body quickly absorbed the nourishment of Dragon Energy.

At the same time, the golden dragon blood flowed through his entire body, making him in possession of the bloodline of Divine Dragon.

Both the dragon blood and Dragon Energy caused the old man to develop tiny dragon scales on his body, which made him look formidable.

“After becoming a Dragonian, his defense ability and vitality would increase by two to three folds. A strong Dragonian could upgrade his arms into dragon claws, and bring out his own dragon tail for combat purposes.”

Wang Xian thought to himself. As he felt the Internal Energy circulating in the old man’s body, he suddenly had an idea.

For humans to make a breakthrough in their eight extraordinary meridians, they had to work step by step before they could advance. What if Wang Xian uses his own Dragon Energy to help him with it?

Would that speed up the cultivation? Without the slightest hindrance?

Wang Xian pondered. He hesitated, but he tried to direct his Dragon Energy to the old man’s eight extraordinary meridians.

Currently, only his Conception Vessel and Governing Vessel were blocked. Once they were unblocked, he would become the Inborn Expert.

An Inborn Expert was good enough to lead a force.

Wang Xian sensed where his two vessels were and tried to unblock with streams of Dragon Energy.

Bobo!

A subtle sound came from the old man’s body while his Internal Energy was circulating frantically within him.

“It works!” Sharp radiance flashed in his eyes. After depleting over 100 points of Dragon Energy, he really unblocked his Conception Vessel and Governing Vessel.

“If I could unblock someone’s meridian, that means I can build a powerful army in the shortest possible time.”

Wang Xian was excited. Just then, the old man who was lying on the floor suddenly sat up.

His expression changed drastically, and his eyes were wide open when he learned something new.

He raised his head slowly and looked at Wang Xian, who was beside him as his body trembled.

“Dragon King!” He bowed, “Thank you, Dragon King, for bestowing a new life to me. I’ll lay down my life and fight for you!”

Mo Qinglong was shocked, excited, and full of disbelief.

According to the information in his mind, he had become an immortal Dragonian. All this was given to him by the legendary Dragon King before him.

“You may rise!” Wang Xian was pleased with the respectful Mo Qinglong.

“Yes, Dragon King!” Mo Qinglong stood up and stayed by the side respectfully.

“You’re my first Dragonian subordinate. In the future, you’ll also become the leader of the powerful Dragonian army. Now, you’ll need to find a batch of loyal subjects so that I can upgrade them to Dragonians,” said Wang Xian to Mo Qinglong.

“Yes, Dragon King. Leave this to me!” Mo Qinglong hastily answered, “I was the elder of the Ancient Fiend Clan. Our clan was in hot water after we obtained the treasure, Five Elements Stone Plate, by chance. All the disciples of the Ancient Fiend Clan were killed except for a bunch of assassins who hid themselves during their training and escaped the calamity.”

“But they aren’t any powerful assassins. Just ordinary people.”

“Oh, really?” Sharp radiance flashed across his eyes, “It doesn’t matter even if they are weak. Just gather all of them first.”

“Yes, Dragon King!” Mo Qinglong nodded his head obediently.

“Is this the Five Elements Stone Plate that you mentioned? What’s the use of it?” Wang Xian picked up the bundle on the floor and opened it.

“Yes!” Mo Qinglong nodded his head as he stared at the bundle with fiery eyes. “The Five Elements Stone Plate is a very magical treasure. So far, we have not fully grasped its functions. We only know that cultivation speed can increase by five fold with this around. It can also heal injuries, which makes it powerful!”

“Oh, really?” Wang Xian opened up the bundle, revealing the Five Elements Stone Plate.

“This...”

Suddenly, Wang Xian’s eyes were wide open as he looked at the stone plate in front of him. The stone was glimmering in five different pure colors, namely the gold, green, white, red, and yellow.

The Five Elements Source Stone marked the source of five elements. Wood fuels fire. Fire creates Earth. Earth bears Metal. Metal collects Water. Water nourishes Wood.

Extractable Dragon Energy: Energy is too high to be extracted.

“The Five Elements Source Stone! It’s the Five Elements Source Stone!” Wang Xian’s body shook with excitement.

The so-called Source Stone was the Origin Source which represented a form of limitation.

For example, if Wang Xian practiced fire attributes, his body would transform into the Origin of Inferno when he mastered the ninth transformation of Nine Divine Dragon Transformations. He could easily control all the fire in the world with his mind.

And the Origin of Inferno was represented by the red portion on this Five Elements Source Stone.

Same goes for the water and metal attributes.

“According to the art of cultivation of Divine Dragon Transformation, the Divine Dragon must choose an attribute when it masters the First Transformation. Subsequently, it must cultivate according to its attribute. But there was a legendary attribute known as the Five Elements Attribute. It was the most powerful attribute of all, as five elements reinforce and counteract each other.”

“Relying solely on the Cultivation Arts to cultivate Five Elements Attribute was not enough. It would require a treasury auxiliary, and that is the power of the Origin Source of Attribute. At the same time, the auxiliary must possess the integration power from the Inborn Origin Source of Five Elements Attribute that almost doesn’t exist in this world.”

Wang Xian stared at the Five Elements Source Stone passionately. The five colors were connected to each other, exuding a magnificent and imposing power.

“I’ll merge this stone with my body and proceed with the five elements cultivation. When I master the First Transformation, I will become the legendary Five Elements Divine Dragon!”
