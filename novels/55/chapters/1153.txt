Chapter 1154: 1155 slapped his face

“Did something happen? Do you need help?”

In the room of the restaurant, Feng Luan looked at the sullen Wang Xian and asked in a low voice.

“No, it’s nothing serious!”

Wang Xian smiled. “I can solve this problem myself!”

“That’s good. If it’s really not possible, I can help you get rid of the master of Undercurrent!”

Feng Luan nodded and said to him.

Wang Xian shook his head. He didn’t need to get rid of the master of undercurrent. All he needed to know was where he was.

The dragon Spike couldn’t afford to offend an expert at the insightful void level. However, this didn’t mean that the dragon Spike would be afraid of an expert at the insightful void level.

He stood in the room and waited quietly. A pensive look appeared on his face. Not long after, a faint smile appeared on his face.

“Dragon King, the Strange Demon’s soul has been absorbed. Do you want to look for the drakonid?”

A dozen minutes later, ao Yao’s voice sounded beside Wang Xian and reported to him.

“I can sense the location of the drakonid!”

Wang Xian looked at ao Yao and said, “Ao Yao, I have a mission for you. Monitor the master of undercurrent and his actions!”

“From now on, when the spy receives the Commission, you will guard the master of undercurrent. Once you discover his actions, immediately report to the DRAKONID. I would like to see if his next words will smack his own face!”

Wang Xian revealed a faint smile.

“It’s the Dragon King. Leave it to me!”

Ao Yao nodded.

“Be careful!”

Wang Xian nodded and reminded him.

“Don’t worry, Dragon King!”

Ao Yao revealed a confident expression.

Ao Yao currently possessed the combat strength of a half-step void interpretation. The most powerful aspect of the prickly dragons was their ability to assassinate and conceal themselves.

Now that Ao Yao was a complete prickly dragon, he was able to evade the detection of a first-level void interpretation. Of course, if the other party possessed powerful ocular skills, ao Yao might not be able to hide it from him.

However, if it was the master of undercurrent, he would definitely not be able to discover the existence of Ao Yao.

Walking in the light and darkness, the powerful thorny dragon species was the most terrifying killer in the Dragon Palace.

“He should be at the position of the drakonid here. Let’s go, I’ll Bring You There!”

Wang Xian could sense the location of the DRAKONID and walked out directly.

Ao Yao was hiding around him. Only a powerhouse above level two of the Seethrough realm would be able to detect him.

If Ao Yao were to be on high alert and pay attention to this situation, it would be very difficult for even a level two Seethrough realm expert to detect Ao Yao.

“D * mn, undercurrent has posted a message in the public forum of Bright Moon City. They want to destroy this dragon spike so that they have no place in bright moon city or even the entire star-moon kingdom. They even want to destroy the dragon Spike!”

“Wow, the undercurrent master is simply too overbearing. He killed the assassin who killed the dragon spike in the city under everyone’s gaze, and now he wants to announce that he’s going to destroy the dragon spike. He’s too confident!”

“After all, he’s a veteran expert who has risen to power for decades. He’s an assassin organization that has dominated the underground world of star-moon kingdom for decades. His strength is unfathomable!” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Haha, it’s said that the dragon Spike received quite a number of missions today. Now, the people who hired the dragon spike are out of luck. The commission has been paid, but the dragon spike is also finished!”

“Yeah, those people are probably going to suffer heavy losses. However, it’s their bad luck. Who asked them to hire dragon Spike!”

Wang Xian walked out of the restaurant and heard the sounds of discussions around him.

He raised his eyebrows slightly. The incident that happened this evening had indeed dealt a huge blow to dragon Spike’s reputation.

On the contrary, the domineering and bloodthirsty leader of undercurrent made many people fearful and fearful.

After the leader of undercurrent killed those people who spoke ill of undercurrent, no one in the entire bright moon city dared to speak ill of the undercurrent assassin organization.

“Today is just the beginning!”

Wang Xian took out his communication stone plate and looked at the information in the public area of Bright Moon City. On it, there was indeed a manifesto of the undercurrent assassin organization.

When he saw this manifesto, a hint of mockery appeared on his face.

Let’s wait and see then!

He kept walking forward. When Wang Xian came to the front of an elixir shop, his body paused slightly.

“Ao Yao, the leader of the undercurrent is inside. A middle-aged man with long hair in blue and red patterns has been staring at him!”

Wang Xian transmitted his voice to Ao Yao who was beside him.

“It’s the Dragon King. Leave it to me!”

Ao Yao replied.

Wang Xian nodded his head.

This master of undercurrent was extremely arrogant. He didn’t bother to hide his identity and attacked directly. Almost everyone knew his face.

If Ao Yao wanted to spy on him, it would be extremely easy for her.

After returning to the restaurant, Wang Xian waited quietly for the arrival of night.

“This dragon spike, will it take the commission and not attack?”

In a luxurious mountain villa, an old man sat there with a gloomy expression as he muttered.

Today, they had made a huge decision to take out 80% of their entire clan’s spirit stones to hire the dragon spike.

Then, the incident in the afternoon was like a basin of cold water that was poured over their heads. It was ice-cold!

They were afraid. They were afraid that the dragon spike would escape because of the appearance of the master of Undercurrent and take their commission to escape.

They were very worried.

“I don’t know. The Master of Undercurrent’s performance today was too strong. I’m worried...”

An old man beside him frowned and sighed.

“Why? I took out all my life savings and spirit stones that I risked my life to get revenge for my father. Why did this happen? I’m not willing to accept it. is God going to treat me like this?”

In the poor area of Bright Moon City, a young man was sitting in a room. He was clenching his fists tightly. His nails were inserted into his flesh, and blood was flowing out. However, he didn’t feel any pain at all.

He had taken out all the spirit stones because he wanted to take revenge for his father. However, such a thing had happened now.

He was unwilling to accept it. Why was it like this? !

Not only these two places, but many places in bright moon city were experiencing the same thing.

The overlord and invincibility of the Master of undercurrent made many people worry that the dragon spike was probably going to be finished.

And the commission for hiring the dragon Spike would probably not be able to come back.

Many people were unwilling to accept the fact that their opponents were not killed and that they had suffered heavy losses instead.

The families, mercenary groups, and some individuals who had given out missions sat at home with worried expressions and did not sleep for a night.

“The dragon spike may be late, but it will definitely not be absent. We will definitely complete the mission that we have accepted. We won’t even be late!”

“The dragon Spike has already enveloped the entire bright moon city. No one can expel it. The undercurrent can’t do it, and neither can the undercurrent master!”

“You want to destroy us? We will accompany you to the end!”

It was late at night. It was already two to three o’clock in the morning. When the last strange demon returned to report the situation, Wang Xian took out his communication stone plate.

The undercurrent master had killed the dragon spike assassin in public, and the undercurrent assassin organization had issued such a declaration in Bright Moon City. Therefore, Wang Xian could not show any weakness.

Of course, he had to slap his face in front of everyone!
