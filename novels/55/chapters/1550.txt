Chapter 1551: 1551 in the Soul of darkness

Vast, majestic, and vast!

Flying towards the interior of the Kingdom of God ruins, black trees that were seven to eight hundred meters tall rose from the ground.

Each tree was ten meters thick.

In front of them, there were many huge buildings that stood in the Kingdom of God Forest.

Every building was emitting a dark luster, containing the weight of history, as well as the black radiance, giving people a faint pressure.

Especially the huge human-shaped sculpture in front of them, a human-shaped sculpture that was over a thousand meters tall, with a black crown on its head.

It held a pitch-black staff in its hand, and its pair of eyes looked disdainfully at the front, as if it was overlooking the entire world.

Everyone looked at the sculpture, giving people a feeling of insignificance.

Just a sculpture gave people a great pressure.

One could imagine how powerful the owner of the ruins of the Kingdom of God was.

“What a strong dark energy!”

The deeper they flew in, the stronger the dark energy became. A huge building that stretched as far as the eye could see slowly appeared in their line of sight.

Occasionally, terrifying roars could be heard from deep within.

Some of the roars made Wang Xian’s heart palpitate.

“As expected of the ruins of the Kingdom of God. Compared to this, the human-demon graveyard is like a small river compared to the sea!”

Wang Xian looked at the world in front of him with a shocked expression. Even a level-3 Dragon Palace could not be compared to this place.

The entire building in front of him was emitting a restrictive force. This force was not a formation but a special type of confinement.

“If a demigod wants to become a god, he needs to build his own divine kingdom. The gods in the divine kingdom are invincible. They can establish their own order!”

“Although this is just the ruins of the divine kingdom, there are still some remnants of divine power!”

Wang Xian looked ahead and thought to himself.

Following behind Ling Jian ‘er and the rest, they flew past the thousand-meter-tall statue and entered a cluster of buildings that stretched as far as the eye could see.

The ruins of the Kingdom of God covered an area of 10,000 kilometers. However, the space of the ruins of the Kingdom of God was more than 10,000 kilometers.

That was because there was another space in the ruins of the Kingdom of God!

No one knew how big the entire ruins of the Kingdom of God was.

“Those are the people from our Bingxin Empire!”

After flying for four hours, Bing Jinghuan’s voice sounded in front of them. Wang Xian looked ahead and revealed a look of astonishment.

Hundreds of thousands of people were gathered in front of them.

In front of the hundreds of thousands of people, there was a huge black door. On the top of the huge black door were three ancient characters, black screen garden.

In front of the huge door of black screen garden, three very eye-catching forces stood there.

The Wuji Empire, the solipsistic sect, and the southern royal family.

The three forces were at the front. Behind them were the He clan, a dark race that was shrouded in darkness, and a group of first-rate forces in the vast region.

As for the people behind them, they were all dressed in black and had their bodies shrouded in darkness.

“Junior sister Jian ‘er, we have to be careful when we enter the Black Screen Garden. Do you see the rear?”

“Apart from the three super powers and our first-rate factions, the people sent by the other factions are all dressed in black to hide their identities and factions!”

“The reason they are doing this is to compete with US and even the three super forces. When they encounter a high-level spiritual herb, they will not care about your background

“Also, the demon beasts living in the forest of the divine kingdom control an entrance that we don’t know about. They will be able to enter the black curtain garden, too. When they encounter the demon beasts, they will take action immediately!”

Bing Jinghuan brought Ling Jian ‘ER and flew towards the location of the Bingxin Empire. She introduced them to her in a low voice.

Ling Jian ‘er nodded her head. Her gaze swept across the surroundings and she was extremely solemn.

“Also, the Black Curtain Garden has been open for a month. You can enter and leave as you wish along the way. However, there will be people lying in ambush at the exit of the Black Curtain Garden!”

“There are also experts at level three of the Seethrough realm lying in ambush here, waiting for an opportunity to strike. However, we don’t have to worry. There will be experts from our Bingxin Empire here to receive us!”

Bing Jinghuan continued speaking to Ling Jian ‘ER. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Wang Xian scanned his surroundings and hesitated for a moment. His body moved and his entire body was covered by a black robe. A faint demonic aura emanated from his body.

Now that the light and darkness had been balanced, Wang Xian would not be possessed as long as he did not suffer a huge blow.

After entering the Black Screen Garden, he was prepared to use his dark identity to protect Ling Jian ‘ER in the dark.

“Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!”

At this moment, a series of booming sounds suddenly rang out, causing the slightly silent surroundings to instantly boil with excitement.

“The door to the Black Screen Garden has opened!”

“The door has opened! Haha, this time, I must obtain even more spiritual herbs!”

“The land of treasures is about to open, Haha!”

A commotion could be heard from the surroundings as excited voices rang out one after another.

Many people who were covered in black robes had excited looks in their eyes.

“Haha, the Gate of the Black Screen Garden has been opened. If anyone can get the black screen heart fruit, I’m willing to buy it for twice the price!”

At this moment, Wu Qing Cheng’s loud laughter could be heard. His figure moved and flew directly into the Black Screen Garden.

Behind him were over a thousand experts.

“Let’s go, Let’s go in too!”

“Let’s charge in!”

Seeing the people from the Wuji Empire enter, the rest of the people in the surroundings rushed in frantically.

The people from the Bingxin Empire also flew in quickly.

Two experts at level seven of the Seethrough realm were stationed here, waiting for their return.

Wang Xian’s figure moved and followed behind them.

Buzz

After passing through the gate of the Black Curtain Garden, Wang Xian suddenly felt as though he had entered another dimension.

Tens of thousands of people were gathered around him!

“In the black curtain garden, those above level three of the Seethrough realm are not allowed to enter. Here, other than the creatures inside, I am an invincible existence!”

Wang Xian revealed a faint smile on his face. His gaze was locked onto Ling Jian ‘er as he followed behind her like a ghost.

“Let’s go, let’s Go There!”

After passing through the gate of the Black Screen Garden, it was as though there was a forest in front of them. It was extremely huge.

Numerous trees rose into the sky. Those who entered immediately spread out and flew towards the surroundings.

This was a land of treasures. First Come, first served!

“20 people to a small team. Spread out and act according to the plan!”

In the Bingxin Empire, Bing Jinghuan ordered everyone around him.

The 500 people immediately split into 25 teams. Those who stayed beside Bing Jinghuan and Ling Jian ‘ER were all powerhouses at the peak of the third level of the Seethrough realm.

“Let’s go, let’s go deeper!”

Bing jinghuan shouted loudly and quickly headed forward.

“A spiritual herb of the seventh level of transcendence!”

Wang Xian followed behind them. After flying for less than 1,000 meters, he saw a spiritual herb of the seventh level of transcendence in front of them.

Bing Jinghuan and the rest obviously saw it too. However, they completely ignored it and continued flying forward.

“Spiritual herbs of level seven extraordinaire can be seen everywhere. This black screen garden is really not simple!”

Wang Xian was shocked when he saw that they did not stop.
