“Someone is coming to Holy Sea Town? Let’s go and see who it is.”

Tsunami sky slightly narrowed his eyes and immediately walked toward the east.

The soldiers of the ocean cultivator corps slowly followed behind.

In front of them, more than a thousand people slowly walked toward them.

The leader was a woman with a good figure. The woman wore a veil on her face, making it hard to see her face clearly.

Beside the woman was an old woman.

Behind her were three middle-aged men.

One was two meters tall and held a big knife in his hand. The other was dressed in a red robe and held a red staff in his hand.

The other was a middle-aged man with a feather fan in his hand. He had long hair and looked a little thin.

Behind him was a group of young men and women. They were walking in a neat line toward them.

They were silent and didn’t even make any sound as they walked towards the direction of Saint Sea Town.

“Stop! Who Are You? Where are you going?”

The burly middle-aged man with a huge axe in his hand shouted at them. He glanced at the group and asked with a slight frown.

Tsunami Sky looked at everyone with a trace of surprise in his eyes.

This group of people had clear discipline, and they possessed powerful concealment abilities. Even he could not see their strength clearly.

Judging from their movements, each and every one of them was not weak.

However, tsunami sky did not take them to heart. Half of the strength of their ocean cultivator army was here, and he was here as well.

He knew even the insightful void realm experts of star-moon kingdom. Moreover, no one dared to make an enemy out of them.

Making an enemy out of them was equivalent to making an enemy out of the entire star-moon kingdom!

“We’re going to Holy Sea Town!”

The middle-aged man holding the feather fan looked at the group of ocean cultivators, fanned himself, and said with a smile.

“Why are we going to Holy Sea Town?”

The burly middle-aged man holding the huge axe raised his eyebrows and continued to ask.

“Our Friends Are There!”

The middle-aged man with the feather fan stroked his beard and said with a smile.

“Very good friends!”

The middle-aged man with the feather fan slightly narrowed his eyes. A trace of cold killing intent flashed in his eyes, and the corner of his mouth slightly rose.

“Very good friends. We need to enter Saint Sea Town and settle there in the future. May I know who you are?”

The middle-aged man with the feather fan swept over all of them and asked faintly.

“We Are...”

The burly middle-aged man with the huge axe in his hand was about to speak when tsunami sky waved his hand.

“Go over!”

He said to the group indifferently.

The middle-aged man with the feathered fan cupped his fists politely and the group continued to walk forward.

“General!”

The burly middle-aged man walked to Tsunami Sky’s side and called out doubtfully.

“Let’s see how they can enter!”

Tsunami sky slightly narrowed his eyes, and his eyes flickered with killing intent.

“Empress, these people are harboring evil intentions. There’s even a void interpretation level demonic beast in the sky!”

The old woman’s voice reached Feng Luan’s ears. She lightly nodded and looked toward holy sea town.

“The array formation is very strong. Without the strength of a third level void interpretation, there’s no way to break it!”

Feng Luan said with a face full of curiosity.

“The five elements are endless. What an exquisite formation!”

The old woman looked over and was also a little surprised. “Just this formation alone is stronger than the defense of an ordinary kingdom’s imperial city!”

The city defense formation was much more precious than ordinary formations. Its value was also dozens of times higher. After all, the area covered by the city defense formation was dozens or even hundreds of kilometers!

The formation that Wang Xian took out was considered to be of a higher level in the transcendence continent.

The group of people ignored the group of ocean cultivators and headed straight for the city gate of the holy sea town.

The people who came were still Feng Luan and her group who had rushed over from the fire Lark clan.

When they reached the East Gate, Feng Luan raised her head and looked at the city guards on the city wall.

On the city wall, the group of city guards were also looking at them curiously.

They initially thought that this group of people was from the East Sea city to deal with them. Now, it seemed that they were not.

“I’m looking for Wang Xian. Please tell him that I’m here.” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Feng Luan looked at the group of people on the city wall and said faintly.

“HMM? You’re looking for Lord Wang Xian?”

A young city guard looked at them in astonishment. Then, he looked at the ocean cultivator army that was released later.

“State your name. Lord Wang Xian didn’t say that someone came to look for him!”

The young city guard asked loudly in disbelief.

Feng Luan didn’t say anything. She took out her communication stone plate and contacted Wang Xian immediately.

...

“HMM?”

At this moment, in Shenghai Town, Wang Xian had received the message from Feng Luan. He stood up with a smile on his face.

His body moved and he flew directly toward the east gate.

...

“Are they here?”

Feng Luan raised her head and looked into the distance. A smile appeared on her face.

“HMM?”

At this moment, in front of the ocean cultivators’army, tsunami sky revealed a faint smile on his face when he saw Wang Xian flying over. “...”

“Attack! Surround them all!”

Tsunami Sky revealed a cold expression and waved his hand indifferently!

“Yes!”

The middle-aged man who was holding the huge axe laughed and shouted, “Surround them all!”

Boom! Boom! Boom

The tens of thousands of ocean cultivators had a ferocious look on their faces. Their bodies were emitting a murderous aura as they charged over with cold eyes!

The tens of thousands of people surrounded Feng Luan and the rest!

“What are you doing?”

The middle-aged man who was holding a feather fan turned cold as he looked at tsunami sky and asked coldly.

“What are you doing? You will know soon enough!”

Tsunami sky smiled coldly as he looked at the city wall.

At this moment, Wang Xian landed on the city wall.

Looking at Feng Luan and the rest who were surrounded by the ocean cultivators, he was slightly stunned. He looked at the old lady beside Feng Luan and his gaze finally landed on her. He smiled faintly.

“You’re finally here!”

Wang Xian smiled at Feng Luan.

“I’m Here!”

Feng Luan nodded her head faintly.

“Looks like you guys really know each other!”

Tsunami Sky raised his eyebrows when he saw how calm they were. He stared at Wang Xian coldly and asked.

“We know each other. We’re very good friends!”

Wang Xian nodded his head.

“Good friends? That’s even better. Haha!”

Tsunami Sky suddenly burst into laughter. “Since we’re good friends, let’s undo the formation and open the city gates. Otherwise...”

“Otherwise, what do you think?”

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly and asked with a smile.

“Otherwise, I’ll kill one of them every minute!”

The huge sword in tsunami sky’s hand landed heavily on the ground as he spoke in a ghastly tone.

“Clang, Clang, Clang!”

When he finished speaking, the soldiers around him drew their weapons and pointed them at Feng Luan and the rest.

Wang Xian heard his words and was slightly stunned. This...

Was he courting death?

Wang Xian suddenly felt that tsunami sky was extremely stupid. A mocking expression appeared on his face.

“Then why don’t you try killing one?”

He said faintly.
