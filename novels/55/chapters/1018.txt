Translator: 5496903

“How... how is this possible... how did he kill that powerhouse with a single strike? !”

“Impossible, this is impossible!”

When snake mark saw this scene, his body couldn’t help but tremble as he stared at Wang Xian in shock.

“That... that powerhouse must have been careless. The weapon in Wang Xian’s hand is very powerful!”

“It should be. The balance has been broken. What’s next...”

The students at the back said in shock.

The balance has been broken!

Wang Xian had two more extraordinary level-seven experts. These two experts could join forces and defeat Snake Mark and the rest one by one.

Before long, those extraordinary level-seven experts from the Yun family would be finished.

Everyone in the Amethyst and void beast mercenary group watched this scene with an indifferent expression on their faces.

They knew Wang Xian’s strength. He was an expert at level seven of the supernatural realm.

In fact, at the beginning, the balance was already out of balance. It was just that Wang Xian didn’t make a move.

Now that he had made a move, the end of snake mark and the rest was coming.

“Take care of them quickly!”

Wang Xian said to the group of Golden Swordfish.

“Yes!”

The group of Golden Swordfish responded. The two golden swordfish that were free instantly attacked an expert from the Yun family.

“Ah!”

The expert was horrified when he saw the two golden swordfish attacking him.

He was no match for them in a one-on-three fight!

“Go to hell!”

“Sword Extinction!”

The two golden swordfish snorted coldly, the golden swords in their hands emitting an aura of extinction as they charged towards him.

The Trembling Golden Swordfish’s attacks became much more violent.

“Ah!”

The expert from the Yun family did not have the slightest ability to resist, and instantly fell to the sword.

“Not good!”

“It’s over!”

The expressions of the four experts who had just joined changed drastically, and their pupils could not help but shrink.

“We are not involved in this matter!”

“We are not involved either. This has nothing to do with us!”

The four of them were horrified. They shouted loudly and retreated backward.

Wang Xian glanced at them coldly and did not order the Golden Swordfish to stop them!

The four powerhouses retreated. There were only four left in the field. The gap was more than double.

Snake Scar’s face was extremely pale. His eyes were filled with despair.

When the four people who retreated saw that they didn’t resist, they heaved a sigh of relief. They stood in front and looked at Wang Xian and the rest with fear.

“Ahhhh!”

In less than ten seconds, the last four experts who were at transcendent level seven were killed.

“You... You Can’t kill me. You guys can’t kill me!”

When snake mark saw all the experts he brought with him lying on the ground, he couldn’t help but retreat backward. He growled in a low voice with a face full of fear.

Wang Xian looked at snake hen and a hint of a smile appeared on his face. He walked over slowly and asked, “Hasn’t your young master’s mercenary group been trying to kill me? Hehe, what happened now?”

“No, no, we were wrong. Please, spare my life!”

When snake hen saw Wang Xian walking over, he begged for mercy in a low voice with a pale face.

Behind him, when the students of the Demon Hunters Academy saw Snake Hen’s appearance, a complicated look appeared on their faces.

Snake Mark had founded the Demon Hunters Academy’s Young Master Mercenary Group, which was ranked at the top. His strength was incomparably powerful in the Demon Hunters Academy.

In the entire academy, no one dared to provoke him. which student wouldn’t give him face if they met him?

However, looking at his now pale face begging, everyone felt a little dazed.

This was still the academy’s influential figure, and now he was actually begging for mercy from a new student?

If the students in the academy knew about this, their jaws would drop in shock.

“Is that possible?”

Wang Xian waved his hand. A golden swordfish appeared in front of snake scar instantly. The Longsword in his hand went straight into Snake Scar’s chest.

“Cough, cough, i... I don’t want to Die!”

He widened his eyes and looked at Wang Xian with eyes filled with regret.

Because of Wang Xian, because of a freshman, he actually walked towards death.

Regret, a strong sense of regret. If he had known this would happen, he would never have provoked this fellow.

“Bang!”

Snake Scar’s corpse fell to the ground. The sound that was produced rang in everyone’s mind.

The surroundings instantly fell silent. Everyone’s faces were filled with fear. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

They looked at the corpses of the strong ones around them. Their foreheads were filled with cold sweat.

“Hu hu Hu!”

At this moment, the sound of wind whistling could be heard from the tunnel.

“Not good!”

Everyone’s expression changed drastically. Even the expressions of the four rank 7 experts also changed drastically.

“The Wind Winged Savage Fish Demonic Beast and the Brocade scale BOA ARE HERE!”

“Run, run quickly, or we’ll be finished!”

“Run, seniors, let’s run quickly!”

In an instant, everyone panicked and shouted loudly.

Everyone in the Amethyst and void Beast mercenary group also had a drastic change in expression.

“Commander Wang, that group of demonic beasts and ferocious beasts are chasing us. Among them, there are 20 existences at transcendent level seven. Let’s run quickly!”

Zhang Fengying quickly said to Wang Xian.

“Follow me, don’t Worry!”

Wang Xian looked behind him. As expected, in his line of sight, more than 100 demonic beasts were rushing over aggressively.

“Alright!”

Zhang Fengying took a deep look at the group of golden swordfish beside Wang Xian and nodded her head heavily.

Elder Zeng, Xia houming and the rest also heaved a sigh of relief.

With Wang Xian around, their safety could still be guaranteed.

“Commander... Commander Wang, can we come with you?”

A student from the Demon Hunter College heard Wang Xian’s words and his expression changed slightly. He quickly asked him.

His words made all the students from the demon hunter college around him look at Wang Xian with a hopeful expression.

“Commander Wang, we are all students from the Demon Hunter College. If we can help our classmates outside, we will help. What do you think?”

One of the leaders of the mercenary group continued with a smile on his face.

Even the four extraordinary level seven powerhouses were looking at Wang Xian with anticipation.

When he saw the group of people looking at him, Wang Xian smiled. His smile was filled with mockery.

“You guys? What does it have to do with you guys? What does your life and death have to do with us?”

He looked at everyone mockingly.

The faces of the young men from the Demon Hunters Academy changed slightly. They looked extremely embarrassed. “Captain Wang Xian, please. Seeing that we are all students from the Demon Hunters Academy, Please help us this time!”

“That’s right, that’s right. We are all students. When we return to the Academy in the future, you can come and look for us if you need anything, Captain Wang!”

“If it really doesn’t work out, we can take out the spirit stones. I hope that student Wang Xian can help us get through this difficult time!”

All the students hurriedly said to Wang Xian.

The people from the Amethyst and void beast mercenary group looked at them and turned to Wang Xian in silence.

Wang Xian’s gaze swept across all of them and followed closely to the passage.

“The wind-winged savage fish and the Jinlin boa have arrived. I wonder how many of you will be able to survive?”
