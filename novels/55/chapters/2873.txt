Chapter 2874: holy region

“Roar Roar!”

“Dragon King, we are here to take you!”

Outside the planet at the edge of the Imperial Star Field, the six wind dragons let out a low roar and transformed into their divine dragon forms.

They lined up neatly in a row, exuding a powerful majesty.

At the back, the six wind dragons’tails trembled slightly, and a divine dragon throne condensed from the wind attribute appeared at the back.

Slowly, the wind attribute formed an extremely luxurious dragon sedan.

There was a divine wind dragon spiraling on the sedan, looking very lifelike.

Six Dragons pulling the sedan.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian looked at the divine wind dragons of 20,000 meters in size. The six divine wind dragons lined up in a row, looking extremely imposing.

A smile appeared on his face.

Although their speed was much slower than his, it was very comfortable to sit in the Dragon sedan.

“Sou!”

He moved and sat in the Dragon sedan.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

The six wind god Dragons roared and flew toward the vast starry sky.

That powerful pressure spread out in all directions.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

The six wind god Dragons swayed their bodies as wind and thunder sped.

Sensing the speed of the wind god Dragons, Wang Xian revealed a smile.

Among the level one void God realm, the speed of the Wind Divine Dragons was already considered top-notch.

He sat in the Dragon sedan and scanned his surroundings.

“Does having another crown make it even more awesome?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows as a smile appeared on his face.

With a move of his palm, the five elements millstone appeared in his hand. The entire five elements millstone changed slightly and turned into a five-colored divine crown.

On it, five lifelike divine dragons were revolving.

The five elements millstone was a little weaker now.

It was not very effective against a powerhouse at the first level of the celestial thearch level.

However, for all kinds of weapons, the five elements millstone was the most convenient to use.

The main reason was that Wang Xian’s improvement speed was too fast and the five elements millstone could not keep up with him.

“I can also nourish myself by wearing it on my head in the future.”

Wang Xian muttered to himself. He put on the five elements millstone and sat there quietly.

“Dragon King, a life planet has appeared in front of us!”

More than ten days later, the voice of the wind god Dragon was heard.

Wang Xian opened his eyes and looked ahead.

There was a life planet at a distance of more than a billion kilometers.

Wang Xian had been to this life planet before.

“Go to the sky above that Planet!”

Wang Xian said.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

The six wind god Dragons moved and flew directly towards that planet.

“Roar!”

A few seconds later, the six wind god Dragons let out a low roar and arrived above the planet.

“What… What is this?”

“Hiss, look at the sky. Quick, look, what terrifying existence is that?”

“Look at the back, there’s a gorgeous sedan!”

On the planet, when the Divine Wind Dragon quietly descended into the sky, some people noticed their existence and revealed shocked expressions.

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian walked out of the sedan and said to the six divine wind dragons.

The six divine wind dragons transformed into human form and followed Wang Xian.

Buzz

His body moved and he disappeared from the teleportation formation.

“He disappeared. How did he disappear in an instant?”

“Is that an illusion or something? What are those six gigantic creatures? They look like the legendary Divine Dragons!”

“Don’t divine dragons have no wings?”

“Who says they don’t? Some divine dragons have wings!”

When Wang Xian and the rest appeared in front of the teleportation formation, voices came from the surroundings.

He smiled gently and stepped into the teleportation formation.

Six Wind Divine Dragons followed closely behind Wang Xian.

…

“Hehe, Congratulations to the red wind divine emperor for stepping into the realm of divine emperor. We represent the Witch Association, the Imperial Court, and the eight desolates to deliver the congratulatory gifts!”

Just as Wang Xian was hurrying over, at the center of the Holy Region, a place called the Holy Nation, countless people gathered here.

At the front was the holy nation’s holy stairway. On the stairway, there were a few towering divine thrones.

The holy region was one of the seven major regions. This was the name of a star region, and it was also the name of a peak faction in the starry sky.

The entire holy region was under the control of the Holy Region. Everyone in this star region was a disciple of the holy region.

The holy region was relatively peaceful. There were not too many wars, so there might not be too much pressure. The strength that created the holy region was not very strong.

There were only five God emperors. Now that Hong Fengyan had been born, she was ranked sixth.

As a unified star region with a force of a trillion people, the birth of a god Emperor was an extremely shocking matter for the entire holy region.

It was not an exaggeration to say that the birth of a god emperor was like the birth of an emperor.

At this moment, two elders stood in front of the divine seat and said to Hong Fengyan, who was sitting on the divine seat, with a smile on their faces.

Hong Fengyan was also called God Emperor Hong Feng.

“You are too polite!”

Hong Fengyan looked at the two of them and frowned slightly as she said indifferently.

“How did the eight Desolation’s divine emperor get mixed up with the imperial court’s Divine Emperor So Quickly?”

“Oh no, what are these two doing here?”

On the left side, there was a group of people sitting to the side. Invincible battle technique and his master, God Emperor Shangshui, were sitting to the side.

Invincible battle technique looked at the two divine emperors in the middle and frowned slightly as he said softly.

God Emperor Shangshui also frowned deeply.

“You’re welcome. We naturally have to congratulate the saint realm on the birth of a god Emperor.”

God Emperor Shenwu smiled faintly and continued, “However, we came here for another matter.”

“May I know why the two of you have come to our Saint Realm?”

On the right side of God Emperor Hong Feng, an extremely pale-looking old man held a two-meter-wide white scepter and looked at God Emperor Shenwu and God Emperor Hong Feng with a curious expression.

“Saint Lord, there are some things that have happened in our eight barrens and six directions that Saint Lord and the people of the saint realm might not know yet.”

“The Dragon Palace’s Dragon King and the experts have arrogantly killed one of our eight Barrens’God emperors, and God Emperor Hong Feng has a good relationship with the Dragon Palace’s Dragon King, so we came to congratulate God Emperor Hong Feng on his breakthrough, and we also wanted to see if the saint realm and the Dragon Palace’s relationship would unite to deal with us.”

The divine emperor of the eight Barrens said to the Saint Lord with a smile.

“Oh?”

The Saint Lord slowly sat up when he heard his words and looked at Hong Fengyan who was beside him. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

The other four divine emperors of the Saint Realm also looked at Hong Fengyan in surprise.

They did not know what had happened in the eight barrens and six barrens. Firstly, the distance between the two parties was too far, and secondly, the time it took for the incident to happen was too short.

“What happened between me and the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace has nothing to do with the Holy Region.”

Hong Fengyan looked at the eight barrens divine emperor and the Shenwu divine emperor and said faintly.

“It’s good that there’s nothing to do with it. We don’t want to have any conflict with the holy region.”

Shenwu divine emperor said with a smile.

“Don’t worry, the two of you. We don’t have any connection with the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace.”

The holy master frowned slightly and said to them.

“Hehe, Holy Lord, it’s mainly because the red wind divine emperor has a very deep connection with the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace, so we have to come and ask.”
