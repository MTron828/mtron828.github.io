Translator: 549690339

“Boom!”

A loud sound was heard at the gate of the Chaos Origin Immortal Gate. The loud sound was like a terrifying explosion.

A few trucks that were rushing over were directly blown away in the middle of the road.

A drakonid retracted his palm and continued to walk towards the city gate.

Fifty people were walking over, but they had an aura that could destroy a city.

“Eh?”

At this moment, the Hunyuan city guards standing on top of the city gate all looked over in astonishment.

“What happened?”

A middle-aged man looked over with a cold gaze. He narrowed his eyes and stared at the fifty or so members of the Dragon Palace who were walking toward them.

“Captain, they overturned our truck leaving the city. could they be from the Yellow Heaven Immortal Sect?”

A young man stood on top of the twenty-meter-tall city gate, looking down and asking with a frown.

“No, they have short hair, and their aura is different from that of the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect. I can’t tell their cultivation level!”

The middle-aged man stared down and then snorted coldly. “Hmph, they dare to attack our truck. Let’s go down!”

The middle-aged man moved and flew down directly. Around him, more than ten guards immediately followed.

“Who are you? How dare you attack our truck? Do you know that you are courting death?”

The middle-aged man took out the spirit sword in his hand and coldly looked at Mo Qinglong and the others.

With their backs against the Majestic Hunyuan City and the Hunyuan Immortal sect, the guards of the Hunyuan City were not afraid of the fifty or so people.

“People from the Dragon Gate!”

Mo Qinglong did not stop. He looked at the ten or so guards and waved his arm.

A ten-meter-long demonic qi dragon claw directly attacked them.

“Enemy Attack!”

The faces of the Hunyuan city guards changed drastically. They roared loudly and pulled out their swords to attack the Demonic Qi Dragon Claw.

“Ahhhh!”

However, like ants shaking a tree, the dozen or so city guards couldn’t stop them at all. They let out miserable shrieks.

The sounds of enemy attacks and miserable shrieks traveled to the city gate of the city gate of the chaotic origin immortal sect, causing the expressions of all the other city guards standing on the city gate to change slightly.

“Who dares to kill people in front of the city gate of the chaotic origin immortal sect? !”

The Voice of an infant realm expert who was guarding not far away from the city gate was heard. Soon after, an old man floated above the city gate and stared coldly at Mo Qinglong and the others.

Mo Qinglong and the others did not answer. They raised their heads and glanced at the old man before walking toward the city gate expressionlessly.

“Eh?”

The old man sensed their strength and a trace of solemnity appeared on his face.

Five hundred meters away from the city, Mo Qinglong and the others stopped.

The fifty-meter-long dragon people lined up on the wide road.

“From today onwards, we will kill every single disciple of the chaotic origin immortal sect that we see!”

At that moment, a cold voice rang out from inside Hunyuan City.

The voice rang out for a radius of more than ten kilometers.

The old man standing above the city gate was stunned. In the city, the Hunyuan Immortal sect experts who heard the voice were slightly stunned.

“F * ck, you’re courting Death!”

When the old man heard Mo Qinglong’s words, his face instantly turned extremely ugly.

A group of fifty people came to the entrance of their Hunyuan City. In the end, they said that they would kill every single Hunyuan Immortal sect disciple they encountered!

This was a blatant insult to their immortal sect.

And from their stance, it was obvious that they wanted to block the gate.

A blatant provocation and insult.

The old man stood in the air a hundred meters in front of the city gate. His body moved, and metal swords appeared one after another.

“Leave him alone!”

Mo Qinglong looked at the old man who was a hundred meters away from the city gate, and a trace of coldness appeared in his eyes.

“Yes!”

A series of voices sounded, and then the two DRAKONIDS moved and attacked the old man at a terrifying speed!

“Infant realm!”

The old man’s expression changed greatly when he saw the drakonids who attacked him in an instant. The thousand metal longswords behind his back instantly covered the two of them, and he prepared to retreat.

Two people who came out casually already had the strength of the infant realm, and there were more than fifty people on the other side. Could it be that all of them were at the infant realm?

“Trying to escape?”

One of the Drakonids’arms enlarged and turned into a terrifying dragon claw that was two to three meters long.

The Dragon Claw was covered with black dragon scales, making it look extremely terrifying.

They completely ignored the metal longswords that were attacking them. With a wave of their dragon claws, they instantly attacked the elder.

“Not good, so strong!”

Feeling the attack from behind, the elder’s expression changed slightly, and he hurriedly turned around to block.

Another drakonid moved forward, and golden metal longswords landed on his body, but they were blocked by the black scales on his body.

The elder who had just turned around saw a drakonid approaching him, and his expression changed again.

He was entangled!

“Devil Splitting Dragon Claw!”

The terrifying dragon claw carried a black sharpness as it directly tore towards the elder’s body.

The elder’s expression changed drastically, and the metal longswords revolved around him, forming a powerful defense.

“Ka Ka Ka!”

The Dragon Claws made an ear-piercing sound as they landed on his body.

“Die!”

At this moment, another DRAKONID had arrived. The terrifying dragon claws directly covered his entire body.

“Oh no!”

A trace of fear flashed through the old man’s eyes. His entire body emitted a terrifying golden light.

“Thousand needles, ten thousand needles, a hundred thousand needles!”

Numerous finger-sized golden auroras formed a terrifying metal attack!

“Boom!”

However, before the metal could form, two terrifying dragon claws struck the old man’s body.

“Ah!”

The old man widened his eyes, raised his head and roared, wanting to block the attack.

“Boom!”

Another attack came, and the old man’s voice came to an abrupt halt.

A drakonid grabbed the old man’s body with his dragon claws and threw him towards Hunyuan City!

“Bang!”

The old man’s body crashed into the city walls on both sides and was embedded into them.

“Deacon Wen!”

The faces of the few old men who were flying towards them changed drastically as they shouted loudly.

The old man had only flown a hundred meters away, but this hundred meters was like a natural chasm. He had lost his life on the spot! Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The two DRAKONIDS moved and returned to a position five hundred meters away from the city gate. They looked coldly at the city.

“This...”

The bodies of over a hundred nascent soul realm experts from the chaos origin immortal sect who were flying in the sky and daring to come over froze.

In a short instant, the nascent Soul Realm Deacon was actually killed.

Looking at the more than fifty people who were standing five hundred meters away from their city in silence and coldness, they couldn’t help but suck in a breath of cold air!

“They’re standing at the entrance of our city. They’re trying to block US outside the city!”

An old man gritted his teeth and growled in a low voice.

“Block US outside the city?”

The Disciples of the Chaos Origin Immortal sect immediately had ugly expressions on their faces. Their eyes revealed a crazed killing intent.

There was actually someone who dared to block the entrance of their city. Moreover, they would kill anyone who came out!

Extremely arrogant! Extremely arrogant!

This was simply the first time in the history of the immortal sect!

If someone is really blocked inside the city gate, where is the face?
