Chapter 1047: 1048 had an affair with the empress

Translator: 5496903

The Empress who once dominated the world and even men looked up to her.

The Empress who once established an empire and was worshipped by all the people.

The empress who once dazzled the supernatural continent and was an empress for all eternity.

Once...

How did this happen?

She was directly pulled off her veil by a young man, and he even faced her in such a casual and even somewhat flirtatious manner.

The empress only smiled there, and her smile was filled with ease.

It was as if a beautiful girl was smiling sweetly.

They felt that the world had gone mad.

Back when the old woman accompanied the empress on her expeditions, this was the first time she had seen such an image.

And at this moment, Huoyuan’s mind was completely dumbfounded.

His face, which was somewhat ferocious and excited, was completely frozen as he looked at this scene in disbelief.

He dared to remove the veil of the empress. Why didn’t the Empress kill him directly?

Why was the empress wearing such a brilliant smile on her face?

Who Was this young man? How could he remove the veil of the empress.

Feng Luan snatched the veil from Wang Xian’s hand and looked at him with a smile. “You said that you would be here soon, but you only came after two years. This friend of yours is a little untrustworthy!”

“I have no choice. I have a lot of things to prepare!”

Wang Xian shrugged and smiled.

“Doesn’t that mean there are a lot of things to arrange?”

There was a hint of mockery in Feng Luan’s tone. She looked at Zhang Fengying and said, “Not bad. You are still so flirtatious even after coming here!”

“Ahem, this is my friend. It’s not what you think!”

Wang Xian looked at her speechlessly. “I didn’t expect that we would meet so soon!”

“Is it fast?”

Feng Luan looked at him and revealed a displeased expression. “You knew that I was the one who established Feng Xian. All you had to do was to go to the shop and tell me. The news would be transmitted to me. In the end, you didn’t do it even though you knew it!”

“In the end, we met in this manner!”

Feng Luan’s tone was filled with displeasure. Wang Xian smiled awkwardly. “I initially thought that I would look for you after I developed a little. I didn’t expect to meet you here!”

“Knock, Knock, the dishes are served!”

At this moment, the sound of knocking on the door interrupted their conversation.

“Let’s change the location?”

Wang Xian looked at Feng Luan and said to her.

“Alright!”

Feng Luan nodded and gestured to the old lady beside her.

The old lady nodded and the red walking stick in her hand emitted a faint red light.

Buzz

Everyone in the room disappeared in an instant.

Crack

The door was opened and the waiter was holding a plate of food with a smile on his face. “Dear guests... where are they? Where did they go?”

In the auction house in the central area of Donghai City, a group of people appeared directly inside.

Wang Xian looked at the old lady in slight shock.

The old lady smiled and swept her gaze over to the area beside him.

“What terrifying strength!”

Wang Xian was shocked. He had discovered a group of strange demons and brought them over.

To be able to move all of them here from another place in an instant, what kind of power was this?

“Let’s go up and have a chat!”

Feng Luan said to Wang Xian.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded his head and turned to look at Zhang Fengying. “Sister, I’m sorry. I’ll chat with my friend for a while. I’ll let you bring me around when I have time. I’m Sorry!”

“You... You Can Go!”

At this moment, Zhang Fengying was still in a state of shock. She nodded her head mechanically.

“Oh right, there are still some matters that need to be resolved!”

Wang Xian turned his head and looked at the source of fire. His eyes revealed a hint of coldness.

When the source of fire saw Wang Xian looking at him, his face turned pale instantly. His eyes revealed a look of fear.

Cold sweat instantly appeared on his forehead.

How could he have thought of this?

How could he have thought that the empress would be so familiar with this young man. In fact, they were even somewhat intimate.

This... if he knew about this, how would he dare to do such a thing!

“What’s going on?”Feng Luan frowned slightly and asked Wang Xian.

“Let this little girl tell me everything from the beginning to the end!”

Wang Xian patted the Little Loli’s head.

“HMPH, don’t Touch My Head!” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

The Little Loli glared at Wang Xian.

“Little girl, Tell Me!”

The old woman said to the Little Loli.

“Yes, Grand Grandma!”

The Little Loli was a little afraid of the old lady. She pouted her lips and recounted everything that happened when they entered the shop.

The Little Loli had a very good memory. Basically, she even recounted every word of their conversation.

However, as the Little Loli spoke, Huo Yuan’s face turned even paler. There was even a hint of despair in his eyes.

The middle-aged man’s face also changed drastically as cold sweat dripped down his forehead. His eyes were filled with anger as he stared at his disciple.

He actually dared to use the little princess to take revenge on him!

He really had the gall to do so.

The old woman’s face turned slightly grim when she heard the Little Loli’s words. They had already learned that Huoyuan had a grudge against Wang Xian.

From the description of the Little Loli, it was obvious that the little girl was being used.

Using the Little Princess of the fire Lark clan to deal with a male friend who was very close to the empress.

Yes, it was a male friend. The concept of this sentence was somewhat vague because they couldn’t figure out the relationship between the young man and their empress. They could only describe it as a male friend.

This crime involved the little princess and the Empress!

“Deal with it according to the Clan Rules!”

The old woman said directly.

“Yes, yes!”

The three women and the Master of the source of fire hurriedly lowered their heads and replied.

At this moment, the source of fire had already collapsed on the ground in despair.

Dealing with him according to the clan rules was unforgivable.

“Let’s Go!”

Feng Luan said to Wang Xian.

“Alright, let’s Go!”

Wang Xian nodded with a smile and followed her upstairs.

“Educate the little girl!”

Behind them, a middle-aged clan elder said to a woman.

“It’s the Clan Elder!”

A woman quickly replied. Of course, education was not a punishment. It was to tell the little girl that he was being used.

After the matter was settled, the old woman and the two middle-aged clan elders walked towards the fourth floor.

“You don’t have to follow your subordinates, right?”

Feng Luan opened the door and spoke to Wang Xian who was beside her.

“Dragon Queen!”

A group of strange demons appeared and greeted Feng Luan respectfully.

Feng Luan’s face turned slightly red. She quickly put on a cold expression and said, “I’m Not Your Dragon Queen!”

After she finished speaking, she glanced at Wang Xian and said, “Your subordinates are behaving like this!”

“Hehe!”

Wang Xian smiled and said proudly, “How is it? The Dragon Assassin organization. Before long, the might of the dragon thorns will envelop the entire star-moon kingdom!”

Feng Luan’s gaze landed on Ao Yao. Her eyes were filled with astonishment.

“Let’s go, let’s go. Aren’t you going to pour me some tea? Oh right, you should have some good tea here, right?”

Wang Xian walked in with a smile.

Feng Luan smiled and followed him in. “Yes, it’s definitely better than the tea you’ve drunk before!”

The old woman and the two middle-aged elders who followed them to the fourth floor were filled with astonishment.

Dragon Queen?

Serve him tea?

This young man is definitely having an affair with the Empress!
