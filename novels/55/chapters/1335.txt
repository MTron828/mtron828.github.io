Chapter 1336: The 1337 Dragon Palace developed in a year

“I didn’t expect you to be so strong in just a year!”

Zhang Fengying flew out from the island of the Light Dragon Empire. She looked at Wang Xian in astonishment and asked in astonishment.

“Haha, It’s Alright. I didn’t come out to train for a year in vain!”

Wang Xian laughed. He was in a good mood.

“The nameless sword demon, the Supreme Heaven’s pride, the powerful creatures in the main hall, and the battle today!”

Zhang Fengying mumbled. She looked at Wang Xian and revealed a faint smile on her face.

Each of them had glorious battle achievements, and each of them had names that made people fearful of them.

In the very long period of time in the future, these names would be shrouded in the tomb of the demi-human.

Be it the younger generation, the middle-aged generation, or the powerhouses who had lived for more than a thousand years. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Wang Xian, this name was a legend to them.

A legend.

“Let’s go back!”

The two of them returned to their residence. Wang Xian summoned his demon soul and brought along two ferocious beasts of the first level of the Seethrough realm.

He gestured to Zhang Fengying and the two of them flew towards the Dragon and Phoenix Empire.

“That is? That Demon Soul? The King Beast of the Demon Beast Clan?”

“Is the nameless sword demon sitting on the Demon Scale Demon Beast? Who is his real identity?”

When Wang Xian and Zhang Fengying left the cemetery on their mounts, the surrounding people immediately saw the demon soul surging with demon flames.

Along with the two figures on top.

Everyone had a look of surprise on their faces.

However, very soon, Wang Xian and the rest disappeared quickly.

The people in the graveyard of demi-humans would soon know the name of Wang Xian.

“Ta ta ta ta!”

The Demon Soul galloped in the sky, bringing with it a powerful force as it flew at an unbridled speed.

As a demonic beast of the second level of the Seethrough Void Tier, its speed was unquestionable.

The journey would have taken more than ten days. With the speed of the demon soul, it would take at most two days to reach the dragon and Phoenix Empire.

“Eh, why is there an army below us?”

When they were about to reach the dragon and Phoenix Empire, Wang Xian saw an army of more than ten thousand people galloping on the ground.

There were four to five experts at the insightful void tier leading the way.

Wang Xian took a glance and paid no attention to them.

It was very likely that the reason why so many troops were deployed was to exterminate a certain race of demon beasts or a group of ferocious beasts.

“The dragon-phoenix Empire has changed so much in just a year!”

When the dragon-phoenix Empire appeared in their line of sight, Zhang Fengying looked at the huge city in front of them with a face full of shock.

Even Wang Xian’s eyes were filled with astonishment.

The entire city had doubled in size. It was much more majestic than the royal cities that Wang Xian had encountered along the way.

The huge city stood within a radius of 100 kilometers. There were five towers that were 1,000 meters tall inside.

There were still many buildings being built inside.

The number of people in the entire dragon and Phoenix Empire had reached at least 10 million people. It had increased by five to six times.

It was unknown where Feng Luan had recruited so many people.

“Let’s go. I’ll bring you to a place!”

Wang Xian looked at Zhang Fengying and said to her.

“HMM? What Place?”

Zhang Fengying looked at him curiously.

“You’ll know once we get there!”

Wang Xian smiled, patted his demon soul and pointed in the direction of the Dragon Palace.

“Roar!”

The demon soul let out a low growl and flew towards the direction of the Dragon Palace.

“Enter the ocean!”

Wang Xian came to the top of the Dragon Palace and said to the demon soul.

“It’s the King!”

“Bang!”

After entering the ocean, an extremely huge underwater dragon palace appeared in front of them.

“This... This Is?”

Zhang Fengying opened her mouth slightly and stared at the underwater dragon palace in shock.

The Dragon Palace covered an area of 80 kilometers. The mythical underwater dragon palace shocked her.

Wang Xian revealed a proud expression.

The Majestic Dragon Palace was comparable to some of the powerful buildings in the graveyard of demi-humans.

In fact, it looked even more magnificent from the bottom of the sea.

“Let’s go in!”

Wang Xian’s body moved. He got down from his demon soul and brought her into the Dragon Palace.

Buzz

As soon as they stepped into the Dragon Palace, a strong spiritual energy rushed over.

A familiar feeling spread throughout his entire body.

“Dragon King!”

“Dragon King!”

The yakshas who were patrolling around the palace immediately flew over when they saw Wang Xian returning. They knelt down and greeted him.

“Alright, continue patrolling!”

Wang Xian waved his hand and flew towards the direction of the Dragon King’s palace.

The Dragon Palace was huge, but there were only about 3,000 members. It looked extremely spacious.

“Dragon King!”

When Wang Xian walked to the front of the Dragon King’s Palace, ao nu flew over quickly and greeted him respectfully.

“Where are Prime Minister Gui and the rest? Where are the Dragon Queen and the rest?”

Wang Xian scanned his surroundings and noticed that there were not many members in the dragon lair. He asked in puzzlement.

“Dragon King, Prime Minister Gui and the Dragon Queen have led a group of powerhouses from the Dragon Palace to the deep sea spiritual spring!”

Lady Ao quickly replied.

“Deep sea spiritual spring?”

Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled.

“Dragon King, I am one of Prime Minister Gui’s civil servants. I will report to you about the recent events!”

A civil servant from the Dragon Palace with a turtle shell on his back flew over from the Dragon Palace’s Wenhua Pavilion when he saw Wang Xian’s arrival. He knelt on the ground respectfully.

“Get up. Tell me about the development of the Dragon Palace in the past year!”

Wang Xian nodded and walked to the front of the dragon throne. He gestured to Zhang Fengying and asked her to sit at the side.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

The civil official stood up respectfully. “During the month when you were away, the Dragon Palace hunted the nearby sea beasts under the leadership of Prime Minister Gui and a few leaders. They were looking for various resources!”

“The entire sea area within a radius of 500 kilometers is completely under the control of the Dragon Palace. Leader Mu Zesen has broken through to the second level of the void interpretation realm in this one year. Leader AO Yaoyao has broken through to the first level of the Void Interpretation Realm!”

“Prime Minister Gui, Ao Qitian, Ao Jian, Ao Qi, ao Yecha, Occhi, ao crab, and the nine leaders of the flood dragons have all broken through to the first level of the Void Interpretation Realm!”

“In addition, among the five Dragon Queens and the eldest princess, one of them has broken through to the first level of the void interpretation realm. The rest of the members of the Dragon Palace are 100 at the half-step void interpretation realm, 1200 at the ninth level of the extraordinaire realm, and the rest are at the eighth and seventh level of the extraordinaire realm!”

Listening to the reports from his subordinates, Wang Xian nodded his head slightly.

In a year’s time, not only did his strength improve tremendously, but the entire dragon palace was also developing rapidly.

The group of leaders had already reached the first level of the Seethrough realm while the rest were above the seventh level of the extraordinaire realm. This strength was considered pretty good!

However, this strength was still a little too weak when compared to some empires.

There was even a huge gap when compared to the star Moon dynasty.

Of course, this was under the circumstances where Wang Xian didn’t make a move.

“What is the deep sea spiritual spring? Why did Prime Minister Gui and the Rest Go There?”

Wang Xian asked the civil officials below with a hint of curiosity on his face.
