Chapter 966: 0967, get out of the way, I want to show off!

Translator: 549690339

The woman riding the light tiger arrogantly swept her gaze across the group of new students in front of her.

“Female students who have joined the Demon Hunter Academy, if you meet the requirements in the future, you can join our amethyst mercenary group!”

The woman rode the light tiger to the front. The three-meter-tall light tiger allowed the woman to look down on everyone as she spoke indifferently.

After she finished speaking, the woman drove into the academy expressionlessly.

“Wow, what a handsome senior. She’s simply too cool!”

“That light tiger looks so mighty. Is it possible to obtain a light tiger by joining the amethyst mercenary group?”

“The amethyst mercenary group is one of the top three mercenary groups in the Demon Hunters Academy. It was established by a senior in the eighth grade!”!

“The amethyst mercenary group only accepts female members. I heard that there are many beautiful women in there. There are quite a few transcendent level six experts. It’s a three-star gold mercenary group!”

The surrounding freshmen looked enviously at the senior who had entered the academy.

“Haha, another group of Little Brats have come!”

At this moment, another burly voice was heard. Everyone hurriedly turned their heads.

Three youths, each of them incomparably burly, carried a huge hammer on their shoulders, and walked in like dragons and tigers.

“Not bad, not bad!”

The three of them looked at the group of new students, and grinned.

“We are members of the Berserker Mercenary Group, Berserker, ranked in the top five of the Demon Hunter Academy. We, Berserker, only accept powerful warriors. If you are interested, you can get to Know Us, Haha!”

The three of them quickly walked to the front of the group. The hammers in their hands landed heavily on their arms, making a loud noise.

The faces of the freshmen in front of them were filled with shock and admiration.

“After entering the Demon Hunter Academy, you can join the mercenary group established by senior sister. There are many benefits to joining!”

“Some senior sister’s strength is even stronger than ordinary instructors. If you join, you will be able to receive their guidance.”

“I don’t want to join. In the future, I want to build a powerful mercenary group myself!”

When the freshmen saw another senior in the academy promoting his mercenary group, they all whispered among themselves.

“Haha, it’s Our Turn!”

At this moment, another voice came from behind. Everyone turned around and saw four or five young men with fans in their hands walking forward.

They were completely different from the three men from the Berserker mercenary group. They were dressed in luxurious brocade clothes and held folding fans in their hands. They looked more like a playboy.

“It’s the young master’s mercenary group. It’s said that those who can join them must first have money, and second must have strength!”

“I heard that the young master’s mercenary group’s strength can be ranked in the top ten in the Demon Hunters Academy. No one dares to provoke them!”

“Sometimes, having spirit stones is also a reflection of one’s strength. To join them, one needs ten million middle-grade spirit stones. This is ten million!”

The five young men walked over elegantly, causing the surrounding freshmen to discuss and envy.

“Hua Fenghua, come to the young master’s mercenary group after you enter the Academy!”

At this moment, the five young men suddenly walked straight to the seat beside Wang Xian.

“Get out of the way!”

A voice rang out beside Wang Xian.

They were all standing in neat rows. The one who spoke was a young man inside.

The young man had long hair with a golden headband on his head. The headband was sparkling.

He was holding a blue sword in his hand. When he saw the five young men walking over, he was all smiles as he walked straight out.

The few people inside quickly made a path for the young man.

When Wang Xian saw the young man walking over, he was about to move his body backward.

However, the young man seemed to have not seen him as he squeezed his way forward.

He turned his body sideways and bumped right into Wang Xian’s side.

He looked as though he was saying, “Get out of the way, I want to act cool.”.

That’s right, the young man wanted to act cool.

In front of all the new students, the top ten mercenary group of the Demon Hunters Academy had come to invite him personally. Naturally, he had to walk over.

This kind of opportunity to catch the attention of all the new students was very rare.

When Wang Xian saw the golden hoop young man colliding with his body directly, he immediately stopped his retreating posture. His body didn’t move at all.

“Huh?”

The face of the young man who squeezed over changed slightly. He couldn’t help but take a step back. His arrogant face, which had his head slightly raised, instantly became embarrassed. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Don’t you have eyes?”

The young man with the golden hoop stared at Wang Xian coldly and said expressionlessly.

“Don’t you know how to be polite? Why? Did I stop you from acting cool?”

Wang Xian looked at the expression of the young man and smiled.

He really didn’t have a good impression of this kind of guy.

“Get out of my way!”

When the young man with the golden hoop heard Wang Xian’s words, his face immediately darkened and he growled coldly.

“Be Nice!”

Wang Xian stood there indifferently and didn’t move.

“Kid, are you courting death?”

When the young man in golden hoop saw that everyone was looking at him, his expression changed as he stared at Wang Xian.

Damn it. This time, a few seniors from the young master’s mercenary group came to look for him in front of all the new students so that he could gain some face and show off.

Now that he was blocked by a kid on his way to show off, he was naturally extremely furious.

“Huh? Fenghua, don’t be Rash!”

The five young men in Brocade saw the sudden conflict between Hua Fenghua and Wang Xian. They narrowed their eyes slightly and waved at him.

They looked at Wang Xian with a teasing look on their faces.

“Kid, get out of my way!”

It was the same sentence as Hua Fenghua, but they were talking about the five of them now.

The young man in embroidered clothes standing in the middle was even more outstanding. He gestured to the side.

They were all smiling as they stared at Wang Xian indifferently.

The surrounding freshmen were slightly stunned when they saw this scene. Their faces were filled with astonishment.

“What’s wrong with that Kid? Is he courting death?”

“F * ck, he offended the young master’s mercenary group? No Way, who doesn’t know that offending the young master’s mercenary group in the Demon Hunter Academy is simply courting death!”

“It’s already cold. If we apologize now, it’s still not too late!”

When the surrounding freshmen saw this scene, their eyes widened.

The reason why the young master’s mercenary group was able to rank in the top ten of the Demon Hunter Academy was not because of their strength, but because of their financial resources.

Although this world was a world of martial strength, money was still awesome.

If you had money, you could hire strong people, and if you had money, you could hire assassins.

The young master’s mercenary group was definitely an existence that no one dared to provoke in the demon Hunters Academy. Even the top three mercenary groups did not dare to provoke them.

This was completely a wealthy organization.

When the five of them heard the discussions around them, a faint smile appeared on their faces.

Even the freshmen who had yet to enroll in the academy had heard of their reputations. This made them even more arrogant.

Hua Fenghua, who was at the side, snorted coldly. She crossed her arms and looked at Wang Xian coldly.

Wang Xian looked at them and smiled disdainfully. “Move aside? Are you going to give way to trash like you?”

Boom

When Wang Xian finished his sentence, everyone around him was stunned for a moment before they burst into an uproar.
