Chapter 1594: 1594 was the most powerful

“Latest news, latest news. In the Bingxin Royal City, the Sky Demon is fighting three rank-8 insightful void martial artists

“The hunchbacked old man beside him killed all the members of the royal family by himself. It is said that only one ancestor and the ninth prince survived. The bloodline of the royal family almost ended

“The only sect should have received the news by now. I wonder how the only sect will react. Will a top-tier void interpretation level 9 powerhouse take action directly?”

“They will definitely take action. No one has dared to provoke the only sect like this for tens of thousands of years. This time, a grand elder has died. The only sect will definitely not let the matter rest!”

In the ruins of the divine kingdom, after everyone was shocked by the destruction of the Iceheart Empire and the powerful skyfiend, they immediately discussed the lone faction.

This incident was not only related to the skyfiend and Iceheart Empire. It was also related to the lone faction, one of the three superpowers in the vast region.

For such a powerful faction that had been established for tens of thousands of years, it was impossible for a base to be destroyed and a disciple to be killed so easily.

Especially since the other party was the most domineering of the three super factions, the solipsistic sect.

In heaven and on Earth, the solipsistic sect ruled supreme!

This was the slogan and Banner of the Solipsistic sect.

“Boss devil, these are all the treasures in the Ice Heart Empire. Also, this interspatial ring is mine. Everything in it is my property!”

“Look, can you expel the darkness soul from my body?”

At this moment, on the fifth floor of a manor in the ruins of the Kingdom of God.

Wang Xian sat there quietly. The hunchbacked old man beside him was fawning over him with a smile on his face.

He kept rubbing his hands and looked at Wang Xian nervously.

“Are you sure you won’t kill me after I get rid of the dark soul in your body?”

Wang Xian looked at the hunchbacked old man and said faintly.

Although he hadn’t spent much time with the hunchbacked old man, Wang Xian had some understanding of him.

This old man was definitely not a good person in the past. It wasn’t an exaggeration to call him a devil.

He killed millions of people without even blinking an eye. Even Wang Xian couldn’t do it.

Moreover, the means of the bloodline was abnormally cruel.

Although the hunchbacked old man had atoned for his sins, he couldn’t guarantee that he wouldn’t attack him after he cured the other party.

After all, the old man had suffered a lot during this period of time.

Furthermore, Wang Xian could vaguely guess the old man’s previous realm.

He wasn’t his match.

“How could you, Boss Demon? I’m not a despicable person like the ice heart empire. I will never repay kindness with enmity!”

The old man said hurriedly.

“Do you think I will believe you? When my strength breaks through or I find a way, I will help you expel the darkness soul in your body!”

Wang Xian looked at him indifferently and said directly.

“This...”

The stooped old man’s face fell immediately. He was a little embarrassed.

“Little brother Wang Xian, something bad has happened!”

At this moment, sect leader Ling’s anxious voice was heard.

“There’s news about Jian ‘er!”

When Wang Xian saw sect leader Ling walking over anxiously, he stood up with a slightly nervous expression and stared at him.

“There’s news from our sect!”

Sect leader Ling said with a slightly embarrassed expression.

“What News?”

Wang Xian asked quickly.

“Seven days later, our sect invited all the forces in the vast region to attend ao Tian and Jian ‘er’s wedding!”

Sect leader Ling’s face was gloomy as he said weakly to Wang Xian.

“This is the only news?”

Wang Xian’s face turned ugly as his eyes flashed with killing intent.

“This is the only news. Our sect is only releasing this news!”

Sect Master Ling said with a bitter face.

Wang Xian had destroyed many disciples of our sect. However, our sect was only announcing this news.

Facing the threat from Wang Xian and the sky demon who had destroyed the Bingxin Empire.

They completely ignored it and didn’t take it seriously at all.

They didn’t fly into a rage. Instead, they announced the wedding between Ao Tian and Jian ‘er first.

This silent attitude showed the dominance of the solitaire sect.

As for what the Solitaire sect would do next, it would probably be carried out after the wedding!

The rules were orderly and unhurried!

It was disregard and contempt!

The position of the great sect was fully displayed.

“I have to force Jian ‘er to marry someone else!”

Wang Xian held his arm tightly as a crazy killing intent shot out from his eyes.

“The wedding ceremony will be held at the Yingtian Peak of the sect. At the base of the sect, we...”

Sect leader Ling’s face was filled with helplessness.

Even with Wang Xian’s strength and the might of the Sky Demon, he wouldn’t be able to walk out of the place where the sect was established.

Not to mention Wang Xian, even the other two superpowers didn’t dare to bring their men to attack that place directly.

That was the place where a superpower had been established for tens of thousands of years.

The danger was unimaginable.

It was as difficult as ascending to the heavens to rescue Ling Jian ‘ER from there. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Phew!”

Wang Xian exhaled heavily as an icy cold aura emanated from his body.

“Let me prepare for this matter. Even if I can’t bring Jian er back, she won’t be harmed in any way!”

Wang Xian assured sect leader Ling.

“Little brother Wang Xian, don’t be rash!”

Sect leader Ling saw Wang Xian’s determined expression and his expression changed slightly. He quickly said.

“Don’t worry, I will do as I wish!”

Wang Xian shook his head as a hint of madness flashed in his eyes.

“This...”

Sect leader Ling looked at him, nodded his head, and left with a heavy heart.

Wang Xian turned around and looked at the hunchbacked old man.

“Boss Devil, with my current strength, it’s a dead end for me to go to our sect!”

“Unless you get rid of the dark soul in my body. At that time, with my strength, our sect will be afraid of You!”

“At that time, we will threaten you together. Only our sect will return Miss Ling Jian ‘er safely to you!”

The old man saw Wang Xian staring at him. His eyes sparkled as he said hurriedly.

“Sure!”

Wang Xian nodded his head!

“Really?”

A hint of excitement flashed across the old man’s eyes as he stared at Wang Xian with anticipation.

“I want to make a complete preparation!”

Wang Xian stared at the stooped old man and revealed a smile on his face.

Looking at his strange smile, the stooped old man actually had a bad premonition.

“This... What kind of preparation?”

The stooped old man looked at him with some hesitation and asked.

“Of course, it’s to be prepared for certain death!”

Wang Xian smiled. His smile was filled with viciousness.

Since the solipsistic sect was so arrogant, they didn’t put him in their eyes at all.

Since they didn’t put his threat in their eyes, then let them take him seriously and suffer a little.

Death was the thing that everyone in this world feared the most. However, to Wang Xian, death wasn’t scary.

He had died once, but he could die a second time.

Risking his life. If that was not possible, then he would go crazy!
