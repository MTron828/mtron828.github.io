Chapter 1663: 1663, the real killer 1

Buzz

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian, who was floating in the sky, waved his arm. All the corpses were stored in his interspatial ring.

He let out a soft shout and spoke to everyone from the fire Lark clan.

Now that he had killed a group of core disciples from the three major forces and more than ten powerhouses at level nine of the Seethrough Void Tier, the other party would definitely take revenge in less than two days.

However, Wang Xian was very happy to see this scene.

“Yes, sir. Everyone, return to volcano city immediately!”

The two elders of the firecloud Sparrow clan immediately responded respectfully and said to all the disciples.

“Let’s go, let’s go back!”

Everyone didn’t dare to hesitate and immediately flew towards the direction of volcano city.

“What a powerful strength. He is probably at the peak of the half-step longevity realm!”

The four level 9 Seethrough void martial artists of the Holy Fire clan looked at Wang Xian’s figure in shock and exchanged a glance.

Everyone from the Holy Fire clan had ugly expressions on their faces.

They were the ones who initiated this life and death arena battle. In the end, the two major factions had set up an ambush here.

This was a slap to their Holy Fire clan’s face.

However, they had to swallow their anger. Since the life and Death Pill Workshop and the holy item forging workshop were able to summon the demon God tribe, they were no longer afraid of the Holy Fire clan.

If it wasn’t for the mysterious young man who suddenly appeared today, it was uncertain how many of the Holy Fire tribe members would have escaped.

This made all of them look extremely embarrassed.

“Let’s go. We have to be fast. I didn’t expect the life and Death Elixir Workshop and the holy item forging workshop to make a move on this life and Death Arena. Don’t tell me they are not afraid of the anger of the Holy Fire Tribe’s Patriarch!”

When Wang Xian and the rest approached volcano city, a voice filled with anger and coldness suddenly came from the front.

“Eh?”

Five figures flew over at a terrifying speed. When they saw Wang Xian and the rest, they were obviously stunned.

“Clan elder!”

“Clan elder!”

The group of people looked at the five figures and stopped to call out respectfully.

“Phew, are you all alright?”

The elder in the middle looked at all of them and heaved a sigh of relief.

When they received the distress signal earlier, it gave the fire lark clan elders a fright.

Although there were not many people in the arena battle this time, they were all strong practitioners of the younger generation of the fire Lark clan.

If they were ambushed, it would be a huge loss to the entire fire Lark clan.

“Eh? Young master Wang!”

At this moment, one of the clan elders noticed Wang Xian’s figure and was slightly stunned. He quickly shouted at Wang Xian.

“Young master Wang!”

The other four clan elders hurriedly greeted Wang Xian.

“Yes!”

Wang Xian nodded at them.

“Great-grandfather, great-grandmother, it’s all thanks to brother Wang Xian. Otherwise, we would be in danger!”

Huo Luo'er, who was standing beside Wang Xian, looked at the five clan elders and said with a smile.

“Oh? So it was young master Wang!”

The five clan elders nodded their heads slowly. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

It seemed that young master Wang had gotten rid of the distress call just now.

“Yes, yes. Brother Wang Xian is amazing. He wiped out tens of thousands of people from the three major forces in one move. More than a dozen experts at level nine of the void interpretation realm were also killed in one move!”

Huo Luo'er nodded her head heavily and kept on talking.

“The three major forces?”

“Eh? Luo'er, your strength has increased a lot?”

A clan elder revealed a puzzled expression when he heard her words.

However, at this moment, another old woman was sizing up Huo Luo'er and suddenly asked in surprise.

“Hehe, Great Grandma, I’m now an expert at the eighth level of the Seethrough Realm!”

Huo Luo'er’s somewhat boastful figure moved and came directly to the old woman’s side. She said with some pride.

“8th level of the Void interpretation realm? How is this possible?”

When the five clan elders heard her words, they all fixed their gazes on Huo Luo'er.

The strength of an 8th level of the void interpretation realm was not enough to shock them, but Huo Luo'er had reached the 8th level of the void interpretation realm. This was somewhat inconceivable.

One had to know that she had just matured!

She was only at the profound void Tier 2 a few days ago. How could it be possible for her to be at the Profound Void Tier 8 now?

“Profound Void Tier 8? This... this...”

Then, at the back, all the members of the fire cloud sparrow clan heard Huo Luo'er’s words and their faces were filled with shock.

This made them think of how Huo Luo'er had instantly killed the peerless prodigy of the life and death pill workshop, Shui Lian Hun.

At that time, everyone was extremely shocked. It was just that the outbreak of war had caused them to temporarily focus their attention on other places.

Now that they thought about it, Huo Luo'er’s strength was indeed a little terrifying.

“Hehe, brother Wang Xian used the flame soul to help me raise my strength to a level eight Seethrough void martial artist. In the future, I will also be an expert of the fire lark tribe!”

Huo Luo'er raised her head and said excitedly.

“Young Master Wang?”

“Fire Soul?”

The five clan elders were stunned for a moment before they looked at Wang Xian.

When they thought of the person in front of them, who had reached half-step longevity from the transcendence realm, they pursed their lips.

It was indeed possible for Huo Luo'er to raise her strength.

“The few of us clan elders have some respect for Lord Wang!”

“There is a little, and we all address him as young master Wang!”

“He was actually able to raise princess Huo Luo'er’s strength to the eighth level of the Seethrough realm. How terrifying!”

“What is this Lord Wang’s identity? What is his relationship with US firecloud Sparrow clan?”

Voices of doubt rang out. Everyone in the firecloud Sparrow clan was filled with curiosity towards Wang Xian.

He had destroyed tens of thousands of people with a single move. He was respected by their elders and saved their lives.

No matter what, they could boast about this for a long time.

“At that time, the higher-ups of the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan came to welcome us personally. They didn’t mean to embarrass us!”

The four experts of the Holy Fire clan, who were at level nine of the Seethrough realm, looked at each other and thought to themselves.

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian smiled faintly and said to the five of them without saying anything else.

“Yes, yes!”

The five elders of the firecloud Sparrow clan nodded immediately.

The group of them flew quickly into the firecloud city.

“Where is Senior Fengyun?”

After entering the Firecloud City, Wang Xian asked the five elders.

“Young master Wang wants to see the patriarch? Let us bring you there!”

The five of them nodded and said to Wang Xian immediately.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded and followed them to the firecloud mountain range ahead.

“Patriarch, young master Wang wishes to see you. We have something important to report!”

The six of them spent more than ten minutes before an elder shouted into the mountain range.

“Come in!”

Feng Yun’s voice was heard. Wang Xian and the rest immediately entered the mountain range.

“Patriarch!”

An old woman walked over and recounted what had happened.

“What? The Demon God tribe of the nine God Empire actually joined two major forces?”

On the way here, the five elders had already understood everything.

When they learned that the demon God tribe had sent people to support the two large factions, their expressions changed drastically.

Feng Yun similarly frowned and sighed slightly.

“It looks like these two large factions want to kill us!”

Feng Yun sat there, thinking non-stop.

“Senior Feng Yun, if the longevity experts from the three forces join forces to attack us, Will the fire cloud sparrow tribe be able to withstand them?”

Wang Xian sat at the side and said in a low voice.

“If the three forces join forces, our fire cloud sparrow tribe will not be able to withstand them!”

Feng Yun shook her head bitterly. “The life and Death Pill Workshop and the Medicine Master of the Holy Item Forging Workshop joined forces to attack us. I have the confidence to withstand them. However, with the demon God tribe, we are definitely not their match!”

“That is the demon god of the nine God Empire. They have at least one longevity, or even more!”

Wang Xian frowned slowly. “With the appearance of the Demon God tribe, the two forces are clearly no longer afraid of the Holy Fire tribe. In that case, we can only go all out!”
