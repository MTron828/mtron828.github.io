Chapter 2917: asked the Dragon Palace for help 3

“I don’t know how strong the Dragon Palace is. I’ve seen the Dragon King kill two rank one divine emperors with a single move!”

“The Dragon Palace does have a divine dragon, and there’s an 80% chance that it’s the legendary Divine Dragon.”

“The most terrifying thing is that the Dragon Palace has only been in the imperial star field for ten years. You guys might not believe it. Ten years ago, my bad disciple got to know the Dragon King. At that time, the Dragon King was only at the Divine Lord level. There’s no mistake about that.”

“At that time, the Dragon Palace might not even have a god Lord. In ten years, they have grown to this point.”

“The Dragon Palace gives me an unfathomable feeling. The Dragon King seems very easy-going. As for how strong he is, I think he shouldn’t be weaker than our domain Lord!”

Upon hearing the first Supreme Elder’s question and seeing that everyone was gathered here, the divine emperor of Shangshui pondered for a moment and said.

He really didn’t know how strong the Dragon Palace was, but the Dragon Palace gave him an unfathomable feeling.

And that terrifying speed of development made him feel incredulous.

“It seems that the Dragon King has obtained the true divine dragon inheritance!”

When the surrounding people heard his words, they were also slightly shocked.

Although they knew a little about the dragon palace, every time they heard it, they were still shocked.

Ten years of awe-inspiring Starlit skies and sweeping across a region was a heaven-defying move.

“There’s one more thing. The relationship between the Holy Region and the Dragon Palace is good now. If the Dragon Palace is willing to help us, the holy region should also come over.”

“The Dragon King is very easy to talk to, but I’m not sure about this kind of thing.”

Shangshui divine emperor continued to speak.

“The Domain Lord is currently contacting the Holy Region Lord. As for the Dragon Palace, should we give it a try?”

The elder beside the first Supreme Elder said with a frown.

“To request the Dragon Palace to come over and help us, at the very least, we have to be sincere enough. It’s best that we discuss this matter with the domain Lord before we request. If we act rashly and cause the Dragon King to be displeased, it will be troublesome.”

The first Supreme Elder said.

The divine emperor of Shangshui nodded.

“Sigh, if there is no support, it will be a disaster for our glazed domain!”

A divine emperor sighed heavily, his mood extremely grave.

Everyone sat there quietly, their brows tightly knitted.

The first Supreme Elder took out his AI and reported the matters on their side to the domain Lord.

He also reported some matters regarding the Dragon Palace.

“The domain Lord has sent a message!”

Time passed by minute by minute. Half an hour later, the first Supreme Elder said.

“The Holy Region is a bit hesitant to come to our aid. They don’t dare to come to our aid rashly.”

“Besides, the governor knows that your disciple has a good relationship with the Dragon King, so he wants to ask Green Mountain or your disciple to test the waters.”

“The governor has given us two plans. One is to ask the Dragon King what price we have to pay, and they are willing to help.”

“The other is for the governor to give me a set of resources. With such resources, Will the Dragon Palace be willing to send people or how many people they can send?”

The first Supreme Elder looked at the divine emperor of Shangshui and said.

“Sure, I’ll call that kid over. He can contact the Dragon King.”

The divine emperor of Shangshui nodded, stood up and said.

“Okay!”

The group of divine emperors nodded.

“Fortunately, Qingshan came back this time. Otherwise, it would have taken some time to contact the Dragon King!”

Looking at the figure of Shangshui divine emperor leaving, one of the Divine Emperors said slowly.

“What happened back then was a tragedy caused by a coincidence. Qingshan came back because his heart is with us, Glaze!”

A few divine emperors beside him nodded in agreement.

“F * CK, F * CK, F * ck, these B * stards from the glazed tile palace. Did I say something wrong? Did I say anything wrong when I said that your glazed tile palace was weak?”

“My master almost died here in this kind of battle situation. In the end, I had to take action!”

“Humph, you still say that your glazed tile palace is the strongest and the most powerful region in the resplendent starry sky. F * ck, why do I feel that it’s really trash?”

“I’m so angry, I’m so angry. A bunch of idiots. The glazed domain can’t be compared to the Dragon Palace in the first place.”

However, just as the divine emperor of Shangshui flew over, he heard invincible battle technique cursing.

Second senior sister stood at the side with a dark expression, as if she didn’t recognize him.

As for the glazed soldiers behind him, their faces were also dark as they looked at invincible battle technique from time to time.

The reason was that invincible in battle technique had asked for an AI just now and registered his name, preparing to leave his legend in the VELURIYAM domain.

A perfect video of killing the evil God Emperor.

When he posted it in the VELURIYAM domain, it had indeed attracted the attention of countless people.

Now, the war at the front line was related to the crisis of the entire population of the VELURIYAM domain. Such a shocking video was naturally crazily spread and watched.

In just a short ten minutes, it had received billions of attention.

In the video, the valiant posture of the invincible in battle techniques had indeed shocked and impressed everyone.

They even felt awe in their hearts.

However, the words at the bottom of the video made the citizens of the veluriyam domain somewhat unhappy.

The invincible in battle techniques had directly said under the video that the Veluriyam Domain Army was too trashy. They didn’t even have any trump cards. They were too useless!

This caused some people to be dissatisfied, and they began to retort.

How could invincible in battle technique stand it? He was the great hero of the glazed domain, and someone actually ridiculed him.

So invincible in battle technique began to spew wildly. He directly said that the glazed domain was trashy and couldn’t be compared to the Dragon Palace.

He, a Dragon King’s underling, could easily destroy two demon god emperors, but the glazed domain couldn’t. It was too trashy. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

His scolding was tantamount to igniting a barrel of gunpowder.

Although invincible in battle had killed two evil God monarchs, if you scolded the glazed domain, how could others coddle you.

If they said that the glazed domain was inferior to the Dragon Palace, how could the citizens of the glazed domain admit that they were inferior.

Hence, there were all kinds of replies. They said that if they weren’t facing enemies on both sides and if it wasn’t for the mechanical imperial region’s army pressing down on them, they could easily destroy the chimei territory.

They also said that the Dragon Palace was a newly rising force. How could it be compared to their glazed domain? They had more than a billion years of foundation.

Although there were no such words as saying that one was invincible in battle techniques was a fool, there were also many mocking words.

This invincible in battle techniques was naturally possessed by the keyboard warrior. As he cursed, he replied.

On the side, the soldiers of the glazed domain almost could not help but want to chop invincible in battle techniques.

Their faces were dark as they watched invincible battle technique spewing all over their brains.

“Invincible, come here!”

At this time, the god Emperor of Shangshui flew over. When he saw the cursing bad disciple, he shouted with a dark face.

“Wait for master, Wait for me to reply a few more words!”

Invincible battle technique said without raising his head.

“Bastard!”

With a dark face, the god Emperor of Shangshui grabbed the back of invincible battle technique’s neck and flew toward the central conference room.

Unable to resist, the god Emperor of Shangshui pinched the back of his neck!

“AH, master, it hurts!”
