Chapter 504: Dong Hua Rules Supreme

The young disciple from Dong Hua Sacred Sect lay listlessly before the two attendants of Dong Hua Sacred Sect as despair overtook him.

He had not expected the Dragon King to cripple him directly.

Over the last two days, he had received various Sacred Clans and Sacred Sects. They were all courteous towards him.

Therefore, he had thought that the Dragon King wouldn’t do anything to him even if he was trying to get on the good books of the Lord of Sea Serpent Island.

However... He was too naive. He was naive to the extent of challenging the authority of an expert.

No matter what, he’s not showing any respect to us when he cripples our disciple in our sect. He really has no regard for us!

When the two middle-aged men saw their young disciple on the floor, their faces sank and they mumbled, “Report this incident up.”

The two of them moved and left immediately. As for the young disciple on the floor, he was carried away by the other disciples.

“He’s indeed the Dragon King. No matter which sect you are from, you will still be killed as long as you offend him!”

Around them, the disciples of other sects couldn’t help but sigh after witnessing the event.

Before the Dragon Sect was established, the Dragon King was already known to kill disciples of other Sacred Sects. The Dragon Sect was even established on the corpses of two Saint-class forces.

The Dragon King wouldn’t care if you were from the Dong Hua Sacred Sect or if you were the second strongest man in the Underworld.

Dong! Dong! Dong!

At this moment, the sound of the bell rang. The disciples of Dong Hua Sacred Sect guided all the sects towards the Dong Hua Ritual Ground.

“Everyone from Dragon Sect, please follow me!”

A female disciple of Dong Hua Sacred Sect walked to Wang Xian and spoke fearfully.

In less than ten minutes, the news of the Dragon King from Dragon Sect crippling a disciple of Dong Hua Sacred Sect was known by all other disciples.

Hearing about the wretched state of their senior, they couldn’t help but feel a chill running down their spines.

An attendant and a female disciple were sent to receive the Dragon Sect.

Mmm!

Wang Xian nodded his head, followed beside the female disciple and headed towards the Dong Hua Ritual Ground.

Dong Hua Ritual Ground was two to three thousand meters away and one had to cross ten mountains to reach it.

An incomparably huge ritual ground appeared before them. On the other end, there was a huge lake.

In the middle of the lake, there was a stone statue that was over twenty meters tall.

“That’s a stone statue of our Dong Hua Supreme Saint, the founder of Dong Hua Sacred Sect!”

The female disciple of Dong Hua Sacred Sect stole a glance at Wang Xian as she introduced it softly.

“Dong Hua Sacred Sect has close to seven to eight hundred years of history. Am I right?” Wang Xian asked.

“Eight hundred and seventy-three years to be exact. This year is the eight hundred and seventy-third year since the founding of our Dong Hua Sacred Sect!” the female disciple replied with pride.

Wang Xian chuckled. All the disciples of Dong Hua Sacred Sect had an innate pride and confidence.

“Dragon King, please find a spot you like!”

At the ritual ground, the female disciple pointed to a place that was relatively ahead of the rest.

Wang Xian looked across and saw the Sui Clan and Xiao Clan. He immediately walked over with a radiant smile.

Beside Sui Clan and Xiao Clan was the Sacred Followers Guild.

“Brother Wang Xian!”

When Sui Huang and Xiao Quanshan saw Wang Xian walking towards them, they immediately exchanged greetings with him. The Guild Leader of the Sacred Followers Guild and their disciples also looked across.

Sui Clan, Xiao Clan and the Sacred Followers Guild each had ten Inborn experts that had come.

“Sui Huang, Old Xiao! Have you guys just arrived today?” Wang Xian asked with a smile.

“Yeah. We heard what you did a while ago. You really are a magnet for trouble!” Sui Huang shook his head and chuckled.

“What are your thoughts about the alliance of the orthodox sects after deliberation?” Wang Xian chuckled and asked directly.

“We can’t let diabolism take control of the Underworld. Therefore, I have discussed with Old Xiao and Old Huang. If we can’t avoid it, we just have to join in!” Sui Huang answered solemnly.

Wang Xian nodded his head. When one was in the Underworld, not all things could be decided by themselves.

Even Sacred Sects couldn’t do as they wished in the face of the battle between the orthodox sects and diabolism.

“I have a batch of fire attribute Inborn Spiritual Weapons. If you guys are interested, bring Inborn-level materials to exchange. It would be best if you have devil attribute materials!”

Wang Xian hesitated for a moment before informing them.

In the battle between the Dragon Sect, Medical Saint Sect and Qiao Clan previously, the Dragon Sect had owed them a favor after they came to their aid.

This favor had to be returned.

Moreover, the three-hundred-plus fire attribute Inborn Spiritual Weapons were too weak for him.

Now that he had mastered the Arts of Equipment Refining, he could rely on it if he could get a batch of Inborn-level materials.

Sui Huang and Xiao Quanshan were taken aback and were shocked. “A batch?”

“Regardless, I can equip both of your clans fully. Naturally, this is dependent upon you two having sufficient Inborn-level materials to exchange!” Wang Xian said heartily.

“Brat, how did you get your hands on so many Inborn Spiritual Weapons?” Xiao Quanshan and Sui Huang’s eyes beamed with excitement.

These were Inborn Spiritual Weapons that they were talking about. Between battles of two Inborn experts, the one with the weapon would be certain to win.

For a Sacred Sect, it would be rare to find three or four Inborn Spiritual Weapons!

“Do you think I’m like you? Getting almost killed in an overseas trip?” Wang Xian looked to Sui Huang and teased him.

“How dare you, brat! How dare you make fun of me now!” Sui Huang stared at him and continued, “Do you really have that many fire attribute Inborn Spiritual Weapons?”

“Of course!” Wang Xian nodded his head and continued, “In fact, I have Level 11 weapons that are above the Inborn-level!”

“What?”

“Weapons for Dan Realm experts?”

Sui Huang and Xiao Quanshan could feel their breathing getting rapid as they stared fervently at Wang Xian.

“Bring your stuff to me to exchange!” Wang Xian replied with a laugh.

The expressions on the two of them changed rapidly. They were thinking hard about what materials they could offer in exchange for weapons they could use.

The Guild Leader of Sacred Followers Guild looked at Wang Xian in shock.

The female disciple beside him still pouted and observed Wang Xian with discontent.

“Alright. We will bring the stuff over tomorrow. With Inborn Spiritual Weapons, the losses of our two clans will be substantially lower!” Sui Huang and Xiao Quanshan answered in a hurry.

Wang Xian nodded his head and looked around. He saw that over thirty sects had gathered in this place.

In the entire field, there were over ten thousand people.

No one was weaker than martial artist Level 7. One could say that almost ninety-five percent of the forces of the Underworld had gathered in this place.

He looked ahead and saw an elevated platform near the center of the lake.

On the elevated platform, there were a hundred-odd stone benches. No one was sitting there. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“The people from the Dong Hua Sacred Sect are here!”

At this moment, Wang Xian saw the people of Dong Hua Sacred Sect arriving.

There were over a thousand of them. In the middle, there were four old men with snow-white hair. One of the old men had a sword-shaped walking stick.

A hundred people or so walked towards the elevated platform.

As they walked over, they were like an army of a thousand soldiers. From them, one could feel a stifling pressure.

“Inborn! All of them are Inborn experts! Oh gosh, is this the real strength of Dong Hua Sacred Sect?”

“They are too strong. In the Underworld of China, Dong Hua rules supreme!”

“Sect Leader Nie Wushuang isn’t here. Could it be that Sect Leader Nie Wushuang is getting ready for the big battle in a few days?”

The surrounding sects were shocked to see the elite experts from the Dong Hua Sacred Sect walking forward.

A hundred Inborn experts would match three Sacred Sects!
