Chapter 3891: 3890 Thunder Treasure Ground, a fragment of the Starfield!

Translator: 549690339

The power of the starry universe had somewhat exceeded Wang Xian ‘s expectations.

According to what the chaotic space behemoth had said, there were quite a number of heaven origin creation level space behemoths in the infinite starry sky!

This made Wang Xian slightly amazed.

Whoosh! Whoosh

At this moment, Lan Qingyue flew over. Ao crab also came over at the same time!

In this transaction, apart from some other treasures, there was also a powerful treasure land.

This treasure land was second only to the treasure land of the peak races.

Naturally, an expert from the Dragon Palace would be there to keep an eye on it.

With ao crab’s current strength, he was considered the strongest in the dragon palace other than the charming dragon seed.

Let ao crab keep an eye on it.

“Xiao Xian, the soul-returning embryo fruit has been brought over!”

Lan Qingyue said to Wang Xian!

Wang Xian nodded and gestured to her!

Senior Hundun, Here! ”

Lan Qingyue waved her arm and threw all the soul-returning embryo fruits to the Hundun Space Beast!

The two tentacles on Hundun’s head moved and beckoned him over. After sizing him up, a smile appeared on his face.

“Alright, give me the remaining 200 or so fruits in 100 million years. Happy Business! ”

The Chaotic Space Beast said in satisfaction.

“Happy Business! ”

Wang Xian nodded with a smile.

“Let’s go. Pll bring you to that treasure land. Pve taken over that treasure land. There are no more space beasts there. I’ll leave my aura there. The other space beasts won’t dare to come over! ”

The Chaotic Space Beast said.

Wang Xian and the rest felt an energy enveloping them. In the next moment, the scene around them changed!

The terrifying speed made it impossible for Wang Xian and the rest to see their surroundings clearly.

When the Space Beasts of chaos stopped, they came to a strange object floating in the middle of the ocean.

This object was floating in the middle of the ocean. Its area was comparable to a small star!

It looked like a strange tree.

Lightning was flashing on it!

“This is the place. You can enter and feel it. The lightning here contains a huge amount of vitality. ”

The Wonton Astral Beast said to Wang Xian!

Wang Xian nodded his head. As he got closer, he immediately sensed a vast amount of lightning energy!

This lightning energy was very gentle, and Wang Xian could even absorb it.

After absorbing it, Wang Xian could sense that there was healing energy contained within the Lightning.

If Wang Xian was injured, he would be able to recover quickly here!

“The location at the center is very effective for the Lightning Dragons of Your Dragon Palace. ”

The Voice of the Chaotic Space Beast rang out!

Wang Xian sensed it for a moment and nodded. “Thank you, Senior Hundun. Our Dragon Palace is very satisfied with this transaction! ”

“Hehe, Pm very satisfied too. This place is very safe. Oh right, unless you have my letter, do not step into the interior of the infinite starry sky. There are many territories of the Heaven Origin Cosmic Beasts. Once you are targeted, you will be completely killed. Some resurrection treasures are useless to the heaven origin Cosmic Beasts. ”

“It’s best to be careful. I’m really looking forward to you creating a new world, Dragon King! ”

Hun Dun said.

“Thank you, Senior! ”

Wang Xian cupped his hands and replied respectfully!

The sphere on the antennae of the chaotic space beast flashed and disappeared in an instant!

“This senior Hun Dun is pretty good. He is very trustworthy! ”

Lan qingyue saw him leave and whispered to Wang Xian!

“Yes, it’s good to be able to sense that senior Hundun has no ill intentions! ”

Wang Xian nodded and smiled at Lan Qingyue. “The deal this time is not bad! ”

Lan qingyue nodded with a smile as well!

“Xiao Xian, there are some things that have happened at the starry city. Prime Minister Gui asked me to tell you about it. The Army of the belief universe wanted to attack the starry city. However, they might have fled after hearing that we had killed the gods and gave up on attacking the starry city! ”

“In addition, the belief universe should already know about our strength. It will take at least 1,000 years for the 21 legions to escape from the starry city to the passage of their belief universe

“Other than that, there is also the matter with the Phoenix clan. More than a dozen of the disciples of the Dragon Palace who were killed have been resurrected. It Won ‘t be long before they are completely resurrected. When that time comes, the truth will come out

“However, Prime Minister Gui has guessed that there’s a 90% chance that the Phoenix clan is deliberately looking for trouble! ”

Lan Qingyue spoke again and spoke to Wang Xian one by one!

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows. “The matter of the Phoenix clan killing our Dragon Palace’s disciples can be dealt with later. They won’t be able to escape anyway. Let’s deal with the Army of the universe of faith first. Their 21-strong army is an extremely huge resource for our Dragon Palace!”

As Wang Xian spoke, his eyes sparkled!

The corpses of the experts of the belief universe would have all the power of belief retracted into the heart of belief after their death!

In other words, although the corpses of the experts of the belief universe could not increase the power of the disciples of the experts of the Dragon Palace.

However, the power of belief had an extremely powerful effect when it came to breaking through!

There were 21 belief universes with more than 20 million gods and believers. If Wang Xian could kill some of them, the Dragon Palace would continue to improve at a terrifying speed in the future!

The army of the belief universes should be preparing to escape to the passage.

Wang Xian could not let them go back so easily.

He had been trapped for more than 30 million years. This was the time to make them pay the price! DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

At the very least, he had to destroy a few legions. It would be even better if he could destroy all of them!

“However, it’s not impossible! ”

Wang Xian mumbled. With a move of his arm, the galactic fragment appeared in his palm!

“Let’s go. Let’s enter this land of treasures first. Then, we will get an lie to summon the Thunder Dragon from the Dragon Palace! ”

As he spoke to Lan Qingyue, he flew straight into this land of treasures!

When he arrived at the center of the land of treasures, Wang Xian sat there with his legs crossed!

“As long as I can refine this galactic fragment, I will have the ability to kill all the gods at their peak. At that time, I will kill them regardless of their belief in the universe or the Phoenix race! ”

Wang Xian said to Lan Qingyue with a smile.

“Xiao Xian, how long will it take to refine it?”

Lan Qingyue asked Wang Xian.

“It might take tens of thousands of years. I will first nurture the army of the universe of faith. Even if there are flying treasures, it will take at least five to six hundred years to return to the path of the universe of faith. I will first nurture them. After two hundred years, I will go and look for the Army of the universe of Faith. ”

Wang Xian decided!

He would first nurture the army of the belief universe. It would be enough to have the strength of a peak-level pantheon. When the time came, he would search for the army of the belief universe.

It was time to reap the harvest!
