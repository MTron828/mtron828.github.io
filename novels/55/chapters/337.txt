Chapter 338: Horrifying Creature (2)

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

“Hehe! It does have the characteristics of a vampire. It requires fresh blood to evolve. When sucking fresh blood, it would inject venom into the body of the host. This venom is really potent and could corrode one’s body!” Miracle Doctor Blood Man shut his eyes lightly and allowed the leech to move along his arm. It was an extremely gory scene.

“It appears to be a bloodline cultivator and could evolve quickly by absorbing sufficient fresh blood. This is also an exemplification of a high level bloodline,” Miracle Doctor Blood Man explained while showing a shocked expression. In the end, he opened his eyes slowly, looked at his arm and added, “This creature is really horrifying.”

Sss sss sss sss!

Wiggling his arm, a leech was forced out. He extended his finger and sliced open the body of the leech.

Networks of red blood vessels connected throughout the body of the leech.

The leech seemed devoid of the sense of pain. It had already extended its teeth and wanted to leech onto the body of Miracle Doctor Blood Man.

“Filthy creature!”

Miracle Doctor Blood Man waved his arm and flicked it into a glass box. Waving his hand again, drops of brownish liquid appeared.

“This is the venom within their body and the cause of their mutation,” Miracle Doctor Blood Man said to the middle-aged man in military uniform.

Huh? The eyes of the middle-aged man in military uniform beamed. He said gratefully to Miracle Doctor Blood Man, “Thank you, Miracle Doctor. You can collect an item from the National Treasury after this incident!”

“Hehe! That’s generous of you!” Miracle Doctor Blood Man’s eyes lit up when he heard the middle-aged man in military uniform.

The surrounding Miracle Doctors were all looking enviously at Miracle Doctor Blood Man.

“Let me take a look at that venom!” An old man from the Sacred Followers Guild said. He tapped on the venom with his hand and stared coldly at it.

“Assimilation! This venom could assimilate one’s bloodline. Those who are weaker would be assimilated directly!” the old man explained and his eyebrows knitted together.

“How can we guard against this venom then?” asked the middle-aged man in military uniform anxiously.

“Dark Blood Grass, a Level 4 spiritual medicine. With the effects of the Dark Blood Grass, the venom would be rendered completely ineffective even if it entered the body of a human!” answered the old man.

“Dark Blood Grass?” The middle-aged man in military uniform frowned and asked, “For those who have been infected by the venom, can Dark Blood Grass help in their recovery?”

“Yes!” answered the old man as he nodded his head.

“Level 3 elixir pill, Blood Cleansing Pill, could do the same!” At this moment, Bian Yaoquan lifted his head proudly and spoke plainly.

“Blood Cleansing Pill?” mumbled the old men. He wasn’t familiar with it. “Since Young Master Bian is confident, it couldn’t be wrong.”

“We have over forty soldiers who are infected by this venom and are currently being tied down. Young Master Bian, could you help us with the refining of these elixir pills? We will provide you with the spiritual medicine required. After refining the elixir pills, Young Master Bian can head to the National Treasury to pick a treasure too!”

The middle-aged man in military uniform continued, “Besides that, we will be diving deep to search for the source of this virus. Based on our observation, there might be stronger mutated animals there. At that time, we would like Young Master Bian to refine more elixir pills as prevention.”

“Rest assured. Leave this to me! Refining elixir pills is my specialty!”

Bian Yaoquan revealed a confident smile and looked cockily across the crowd. His attention eventually fell on Wang Xian as he smirked coldly.

“Everyone, please wait for me here. I’ll prepare your accommodation. I’ll leave these four creatures here. Everyone can take a closer look, but please be careful!”

The middle-aged man in military uniform spoke to the crowd before turning to Bian Yaoquan. “Young Master Bian, please write down the spiritual medicine you need. We will prepare it right away!”

“Alright!”

Bian Yaoquan nodded his head and walked to the side to write it down. After which, he handed the list to the middle-aged man in military uniform.

“Young Master Bian, do you require any other items?” asked the middle-aged man in military uniform after taking a look at the list.

“I’m good. I can refine Level 3 elixir pills even without my alchemy furnace!” Bian Yaoquan smiled confidently. Subsequently, he flipped his hand and a green flame appeared on his palm.

“Heavenly Flame! Oh gosh! It’s a Heavenly Flame!”

When the surrounding crowd caught a glimpse of it, they were shocked.

“Firmament flame, an exceptional flame for refining elixir! It could also increase the success rate of refining elixir pills!” Bian Yaoquan explained plainly with pride.

“Incredible!” the middle-aged man in military uniform wasn’t stingy with his compliments.

“Medical Saint Sect indeed lives up to his name. Even a core disciple has a Heavenly Flame. They must be really rich!”

The surrounding crowd was shocked.

“Young Master Bian, we will send the spiritual medicine over in half an hour,” the middle-aged man in military uniform said with a gentle smile.

“In that case, I’ll just wait here!”

Bian Yaoquan nodded his head and turned to Wang Xian. He lifted his head slightly and remarked, “All the medical techniques in the world originated from the Medical Saint Sect. However, the Medical Saint Sect isn’t just focused on medical skills. We also delve into the Arts of Refining Elixir Pills. The Arts of Refining Elixir Pills is of a higher status than medical skills.

As he completed his words, he turned to Sun Lingxiu before continuing in a cold tone, “Don’t be so arrogant just because others are calling you the Holy Goddess. In my eyes, you are just an average woman! Tsk!”

Bian Yaoquan walked to a chair after speaking.

The surrounding Miracle Doctors frowned but didn’t say a thing. Even the group from the Sacred Followers Guild didn’t retort what Bian Yaoquan said.

There were bases to the claim that all medical techniques originated from the Medical Saint Sect.

The Hua Family and Bian Family of the Medical Saint Sect were descendants of Hua Tuo and Bian He. They were the founding fathers of medical techniques in Chinese history. 99 percent of medical techniques had originated from them. [1]

The medical techniques of the Miracle Doctors around had all originated from the Medical Saint Sect.

The Medical Saint Sect had a long history that stretched back four to five hundred years.

For the Medical Saint Sect, they were more interested in the Arts of Refining Elixir Pills instead of medical techniques.

Only direct descendant disciples of the Hua Family and Bian Family were allowed to learn the Arts of Refining Elixir Pills. As for the external disciples, they were only taught medical techniques.

All the Miracle Doctors and even the medical techniques of the Sacred Followers Guild were leaked from ex-external disciples of the Medical Saint Sect.

Therefore, even though the Sect Leader of the Sacred Followers Guild ranked higher than the Sect Leader of the Medical Saint Sect on the Miracle Doctors Chart, the sacred grounds of medical techniques were still at the Medical Saint Sect.

From their names, one could also tell their intertwined origins.

“The path of elixir pills is the greatest path!” The Buddhist Physician held a string of buddha beads in his hands as he mumbled to himself. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Miracle Doctors saved lives but alchemists could strengthen oneself and others.

Saving and strengthening were different in nature.

The crowd of Miracle Doctors looked enviously at Bian Yaoquan. However, they soon kept such feelings to themselves and started researching the mutated animal in the glass box.

Wang Xian glanced disdainfully at Bian Yaoquan, who believed he was better than the rest!
