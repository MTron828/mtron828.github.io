Riding on the Spirit Purple Unicorn which was at the first level of the insightful void tier, those beasts and birds which had yet to reach the insightful void tier could feel the aura of the Spirit Purple Unicorn and immediately left far away.

Even beasts at the insightful void tier would usually avoid the spirit purple unicorn as soon as they felt the presence of beings of the same level.

The speed of the spirit purple unicorn was not slower than Wang Xian’s at all. However, after flying for about half a day, it needed to rest for a while.

Sitting on the spirit purple unicorn, Wang Xian only needed to inform it of one direction. He basically did not need to care about the rest.

Therefore, Wang Xian spent most of his time sitting on the Spirit Purple Unicorn. His mind was constantly thinking about the combination of attributes.

Especially the combination of three attributes.

Once Wang Xian understood the attack of the star explosion, even in his human form, he would still be able to fight against an expert at the insightful void tier.

Another day or so, I should be there soon. However, I only have a vague map. I still need to look for the human-demon graveyard on my own

After flying for six days, Wang Xian opened his eyes and looked down.

The map that Feng Luan gave him was not very detailed. Moreover, this was Wang Xian’s first time here. In this wild-like world, the usefulness of the map was greatly reduced.

All he could do was to find the location of the tomb of the demi-human.

“The tomb of the demi-human is located in the ocean and the forest!”

He muttered as he looked at the map. He patted the spirit purple qilin and said, “Go in this direction!”

“See if I can find a city and ask for directions!”

He thought to himself as he looked at the location below.

In this wild and desolate world like the transcendence continent, one might not even be able to meet a human city even after traveling for tens of thousands of kilometers.

Compared to the number of humans, the number of ferocious beasts was at least 10,000 times that of humans.

“Huh?”

After traveling for over 10,000 kilometers along the coast, Wang Xian suddenly saw a city in front of him.

The city was not very big. It looked like a town.

However, this town was a little troublesome at the moment.

At the entrance of the town, there were at least hundreds of thousands of ferocious beasts attacking the town.

The formation of the town had been broken, and even the city gate was on the verge of collapse.

If there weren’t a few experts at the city gate, these ferocious beasts would have already charged in.

And behind the Ferocious Beasts, a demonic beast was fighting with a middle-aged man.

The terrifying battle had affected an area of four to five thousand meters.

“This demonic beast?”

Wang Xian looked over and narrowed his eyes slightly. This was a very familiar demonic beast.

It was a blood barbarian demonic beast. It was a type of demonic beast that thirsted for blood like its life.

“I can’t hold on any longer!”

Wang Xian looked over and thought to himself.

“Damn it, damn it. I can’t believe I encountered such a thing at the last moment. Brother, let’s leave this place!”

On the city wall, a 15 to 16-year-old girl looked at the group of ferocious beasts in front of her with a face full of anger. Her small face was flushed red as she pouted at a young man beside her.

“If we give up, the second Prince’s test will fail and he will be one step behind the other princes. I’m afraid...”

An old man beside her said with a bad expression. He looked at the battlefield in front of him and sighed, “Blood Savage Beast. I didn’t expect that a group of beasts like the Blood Savage Beast would suddenly appear. Prince, there’s nothing we can do. Let’s Retreat!”

In the middle of the young girl and the old man, a young man stood there with his hands tightly gripping the treasured sword. His eyes flickered.

He looked at the few guards and generals beside him and looked at him with hope.

Behind him, the citizens of the entire town crossed their arms and prayed.

“I can leave safely, but the people behind me, can they leave safely?”

The young man exhaled and asked with a resolute gaze.

“They...”

The old man looked at the ferocious beast army in front of him, then at the people behind him before looking at the young man, his eyes flickered. “Although it’s a pity to abandon this place, there’s nothing we can do about it. In order to recover our losses, the prince rescued some experts from wind salt city.”

“They will be grateful for the Prince’s life-saving grace, and they will have a group of loyal followers. Perhaps, in the end, this won’t be a bad thing!”

The young man turned his head and stared at him coldly. There was not a hint of emotion in his eyes.

The old man pretended not to see it and lowered his head directly, he said respectfully, “Second prince, those who achieve great things do not care about small things. If you want to walk on the path of the King, you must know how to make choices. Even if you fail the test this time, the King will not blame your highness when he finds out!”

“At this time, following this old minister’s method is the most advantageous!”

The young man’s eyes were filled with helplessness.

“Lord Mayor, we can’t hold on any longer. You should retreat!”

“Mayor, let all the citizens escape. The rest will depend on fate!”

At this moment, the anxious voices of the city guards came from the surroundings. He looked over and clenched his fists tightly.

The young man looked forward and pursed his lips. He slowly pulled out the long sword in his hand and raised it up, he roared loudly, “The situation is critical. A large group of ferocious beasts is not something we can defend against. All the citizens in the town, escape from the west gate immediately. The rest will depend on your luck!”

“In the end, is there anyone who is willing to fight with me to defend against the ferocious beasts below? Give our families more time. Is there anyone who is willing to fight with me?”

The young man roared loudly. He turned his head and looked at everyone in the town.

“We are willing to fight with the Mayor!”

“I am also willing to let the rest of the citizens escape first. We will defend and buy them more time!”

“Lord Mayor of the small town, Wu Wu!”

The young man stood on the city wall. His actions and words shocked everyone around him.

“Yes, Mayor!”Immediately after, dozens of guards responded loudly as they looked at their young mayor with tears in their eyes.

When the people below heard the young man’s words, their hearts moved slightly, and the eyes of some elderly women turned slightly red.

“Don’t waste your breath. All the people of wind salt town, immediately flee this place. Those who are willing to fight with me, Charge!”

The young man’s gaze was resolute as he roared loudly. His body moved, and he directly flew out. He waved the long sword in his hand, and a bright sword qi directly swept forward.

Over a thousand vicious beasts were instantly killed. The strength of a half-step void interpretation expert was revealed.

“Charge!”

“Follow the mayor and charge. The rest of you, escape from the West Gate!”

“Kill! The mayor has already charged down. What are we still standing here for? We have to buy more time for our family!”

Furious roars sounded one after another, and a group of martial artists followed closely behind.

The young girl on the city wall was stunned as she looked at her elder brother with some admiration and anxiety.

“Sigh!”

The old man beside shook his head helplessly and lightly shouted towards the front, “You must protect the young master well!”

Below, the several thousand people who were fighting with the fierce beasts saw the mayor come down and their eyes revealed a trace of surprise.

“Fight!”

They roared loudly as they stared coldly at the fierce beasts in front of them. They raised their tired arms and welcomed him.

A line of three or four thousand people formed a human wall defense!
