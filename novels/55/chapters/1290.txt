Chapter 1291: 1292 heavenly sword Lingyun

“Heavenly Sword Lingyun, has this Ling Jian ‘er gotten over it? has she acknowledged her father?”

“What Will Heavenly Sword Lingyun be? The welcoming ceremony her father held for her?”

Wang Xian looked at the words on the invitation letter and guessed curiously.

Heavenly Sword Lingyun would be held on the island of the Heavenly Sword sect two days later.

Wang Xian thought about it and kept the invitation letter. He could go and take a look at the Heavenly Sword Lingyun meeting in two days.

The night passed quickly. The next morning, Wang Xian arrived at the island of the Radiant Dragon Empire punctually according to the time.

When Wang Xian arrived, he yuan and long Xiaotian had already arrived.

“Brother Wang Xian, the remaining spiritual liquid is for you!”

He Yuan waved his arm and threw a porcelain bottle at him.

Wang Xian smiled and caught it. 200,000 spiritual liquid could be converted into 140 million dragon crystals. He was still about 400 million away from leveling up.

“Let’s go. I’ll bring you to Xiao Yun Pavilion. It’s a good place!”

Long Xiaotian said to Wang Xian, he yuan, and the rest in a good mood.

The two of them followed by the side and walked towards the Xiao Yun pavilion that he mentioned.

The so-called Xiao Yun Pavilion went straight into the clouds. Clouds and mist passed through the pavilion.

However, the most distinctive feature of this place were the naked beauties.

When Wang Xian entered, he was slightly stunned. However, when he saw Long Xiaotian winking at them, he gave them an understanding look.

It was obvious that this was the first time he yuan came to such a place. His eyes were somewhat attracted and he would look left and right from time to time.

It was obvious that he was a novice.

This made Wang Xian and Long Xiaotian feel amused and mocked him.

This made he Yuan’s face turn red.

As the most outstanding son of Heaven’s pride in the family, he had grown up in the eyes of everyone in the He clan. Naturally, he had never been to such a place.

Moreover, after coming here, the young disciples of the Yan clan did not dare to bring him to such a place.

There were three great ironies in life. Going through the same window, going through the same spear... (the other one was understood by everyone) .

This clearly made sense even if it was on the transcendental continent.

Although, they were not considered to be a place for red lanterns and feasting, they were simply relaxing and watching the dance.

“Hey, do you guys know about the Heavenly Sword sect? One day ago, the sect master of the Heavenly Sword sect went to the royal city of the Hanhai dynasty and killed five or six insightful void realm experts. He also killed the prince who besieged Ling Jian ‘er!”

“How could we not know? This is a big event that shocked the Liuhai region. The sect master of the Heavenly Sword sect broke through and reached the sixth level of the insightful void realm, becoming one of the strongest experts in the Liuhai region. In the future, the Heavenly Sword sect will be able to stand on equal footing with the bloody flow dynasty!”

“The sect master of the Heavenly Sword sect has personally come to bring her daughter back. I heard that he has failed several times. In the end, I wonder how Ling Jian ‘ER agreed to it!”

“Tomorrow, the Heavenly Sword sect will hold the Heavenly Sword Ling Yun event. Firstly, it is to announce the current strength of their heavenly sword sect. Secondly, it is to bring Ling Jian ‘er back. Oh right, I heard that the Heavenly Sword sect will announce that a disciple will join!”

“I told you, it is best not to provoke Ling Jian ‘ER. Her father will definitely come to pick her up. However, what everyone did not expect was that her father actually made a breakthrough and directly charged into the royal city of the Hanhai dynasty, which bullied his daughter. It is simply too domineering!”

“With Ling Jian ‘ER’s current status, even some princes of the bloodshed empire can’t compare to her, right?”

Just as Wang Xian and the other two were lying in the special hot spring of the Yunxiao Pavilion, a conversation came from the side, causing Wang Xian to be slightly stunned.

“By the way, brother Wang Xian, don’t you know Ling Jian ‘er? Did you receive the invitation from Tian Jian Ling Yun?”

Long Xiaotian heard the conversation and asked him.

“I received it!”

Wang Xian nodded.

“Ling Jian ‘er? is the Heaven Sword sect very powerful?”

He Yuan asked curiously.

“She is considered one of the top forces in the Liuhai region. Ling Jian ‘ER is also very powerful. She has the battle strength of the Seethrough Void tier at such a young age. She is ranked third on the heaven’s favorites list!”

Long Xiaotian explained to him.

“Oh? She has the battle strength of the Seethrough Void tier at such a young age. Moreover, she is a girl. I realized that the heaven’s favorites in the Liuhai region are also very powerful!”

He Yuan said with some surprise.

“This year is a little special. I wonder how each and every one of these freaks appeared!”

Long Xiaotian shook his head and said with some emotion.

“I reckon that all the major factions in the flowing sea region will be present this time. The sect master of the Heaven’s sword sect is going to become the strongest powerhouse. In the future, even the blood flow empire will have to be wary of him!”

He continued, “Tomorrow should be a grand gathering. Brother Wang Xian, let’s go together!”

“Yes, sure!”

Wang Xian nodded his head.

The three of them played for more than ten hours in some well-known places in the tomb of the demi-human.

On the afternoon of the second day, Wang Xian flew towards the seaside. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

The island of the Sky Sword sect was not very far from the Light Dragon Empire. It was only about ten kilometers away.

The Heavenly Sword sect was a powerful sect that wasn’t weaker than the Light Dragon Empire.

Now that the Heavenly Sword Sect’s sect master’s strength had increased, the heavenly sword sect had become a force that was comparable to the blood flow empire.

The entire Liuhai region was an unparalleled existence.

This heaven’s Pride Lingyun gathering was a form of propaganda for the Heavenly Sword sect. At the same time, it announced the return of Ling Jian ‘ER.

From this heaven sword Lingyun gathering, everyone knew what kind of status Ling Jian ‘ER had in the Heaven Sword sect.

When Wang Xian arrived at the island of the Heaven Sword sect, there were already many people at the front.

Everyone had an extraordinary temperament. The forces they represented could intimidate a large group of people with just a casual display.

“Brother Wang Xian!”

Long Xiaotian’s voice rang out as he looked over.

“Let’s go in. He Yuan will come over with the Yan clansmen later!”

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded his head and the two of them walked towards the Heavenly Sword Sect’s Island.

No one dared to reject the invitation letter from the Heavenly Sword sect. Even the blood flow empire had to give them some face.

There were many people around them. Young Masters and young ladies from various forces, as well as the Outstanding Heaven’s chosen on the Heaven’s chosen roll, Wang Xian, had met quite a few of them.

Tonight, Sky Sword Lingyun would be located in front of the back mountain behind the island.

In front of the hundred-meter-long mountain peak, there were artificial mountains and fake water. The environment was very beautiful.

There were hundreds of tables placed around them.

There would be no less than three to four thousand people who would arrive tonight.

“Second Prince, you’re here so early. Hehe!”

“Big Brother Long Xiaotian, I heard that you got a batch of mounts. Congratulations!”

Wang Xian followed long Xiaotian to the back of the mountain. As soon as he entered, some young men came up to him.

They spoke to long Xiaotian with some compliments.

Recently, almost everyone thought that the second prince of the Radiant Dragon Dynasty had a high chance of inheriting the throne and would become the king of the Radiant Dragon Dynasty in the future.

Naturally, they had formed a good relationship in advance.

When Long Xiaotian saw the few of them approaching, he politely responded to them one by one.

At a place in front of them, more than ten young men were sitting at a table.

When they saw long Xiaotian and Wang Xian, their eyes turned cold!
