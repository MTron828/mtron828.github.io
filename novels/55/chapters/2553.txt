2554 Dragon Star 2554 started playing the game

“The concert is about to start. Go, Go, Go!”

“Wow, there are so many people. This sports square on Dragon Star is not bad. It’s full of fantasy. It’s So Cool!”

“At present, Dragon Star is not inferior to the other five commercial planets. It’s even a few levels higher!”

Countless people rushed into the concert!

“The concert is full. We can take you to other places on the Dragon Star Commercial Planet!”

In less than ten minutes, the concert was full of hundreds of millions of people. The staff of the chaotic Tiger Demon Nation led the rest of the people to browse other places on the Dragon Star!

“Dragon King, more than a billion people have entered the concert in less than ten minutes. Also, we have seen quite a few powerful forces coming. It is estimated that the daily flow of people can reach more than ten billion!”

The people from the chaotic Tiger Demon Kingdom said with excitement and excitement on their faces!

The number of people could reach more than ten billion. If these people could spend their money here, they would be able to obtain a terrifying amount of resources!

The reason why the four major factions could be so powerful had a lot to do with the commercial planet they owned!

The commercial planet was a cash cow!

“This is only the beginning. After the training grounds are opened, more people will come!”

Wang Xian smiled!

The training ground of the heaven formation was very powerful and had a fatal attraction to cultivators!

“The concert is about to start. Let’s Go!”

The group chatted for a while. The time for the concert was almost up!

At this moment, the concert venue was already packed. They were all sitting in their seats, waiting for the opening of the goddess of stars and goddess Yinxuan!

Tang Yinxuan had received quite a number of fans since her last appearance. Although she wasn’t as famous as Goddess Star, she was still somewhat famous!

“Hello, everyone, Welcome to our concert!”

Emperor Star and Tang Yinxuan appeared on time, and cheers rang out!

Hundreds of millions of people. At this moment, what a huge number. At a glance, they were all densely packed with people!

“Let’s Start Now!”

“Wait a little longer. Goddess Star’s singing is very beautiful. Let her singing accompany our slaughter. hehehe!”

“We will make the Tiger Riot Demon Kingdom pay a heavy price this time!”

Relaxed voices sounded one after another!

More than ten people glanced around. Seeing that they were not on guard at all, their faces were full of mockery!

“The heaven demons of the Tiger Demon Kingdom are all a bunch of idiots. So is the Dragon Palace!”

They thought to themselves, but the mockery in their eyes was not concealed at all!

At this moment, the song had already sounded. The more than ten people looked at each other!

“Hahaha, go to Hell. You will be buried with the Trash Planet Dragon Star!”

“Hehehe, such a trash planet still wants to become a commercial planet!”

When the song surrounded everyone’s ears, suddenly, a voice resounded throughout the entire sky, completely covering the voices of the Imperial Star Ladies!

“HMM?”

In the concert, everyone was slightly shocked!

“Hahaha, die!”

Following that, everyone felt an incomparably terrifying pressure coming towards them, and the threat of death instantly enveloped their hearts!

Everyone was shocked, their faces filled with shock!

“An undying God Emperor has made a move!”

Within the concert, someone shouted out in fear!

Feeling this unbridled aura, the other party was obviously about to start a massacre! Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Let’s make a move too!”

At this time, another group of people hiding within the concert saw the situation and immediately communicated!

They also instantly burst out with terrifying killing intent!

“It’s time to make a move, hahaha, this place will soon become a purgatory field!”

“I didn’t expect, I really didn’t expect, not only did we send people, there were also over 10 undyings, Dragon Star, I want to see how you can become a commercial planet with so many people dead, who else would dare to go to your place!”

This concert was broadcasted live by the AI. At this time, within a 9th grade sky sect domain planet, Xing Hua planet’s 3 great powers saw the scene and couldn’t help but reveal sinister smiles!

This time, Dragon Star had completely fallen!

It had just opened and was already heading towards destruction, hehehe!

The group’s lips curled up, Their Eyes Gleaming!

Weng

However in the next moment, terrifying beams of light descended from the sky, the law beams instantly trapped the undyings that were bursting with terrifying power within!

“Hahaha, a bunch of rascals, they actually dare to cause trouble on Our Dragon Star commercial planet, they really don’t know their limits!”

At this time, the tiger chaotic demon country’s old country leader’s voice resounded, entering everyone’s ears!

...

“HM?”

Everyone was shocked!

“What is this?”

At this time, the over 10 undyings from the demon Slayer sect felt the light beams binding them, their faces filled with shock!

The law light beams from the distant 9 planets above, directly trapping him within!

“Damn it, break for me!”

They heard the voice of the old national advisor of the Chaotic Tiger Demon Nation and saw the experts of the chaotic Tiger Demon Nation flying over. Their faces revealed an anxious look!

“Boom Boom Boom!”

Waves of terrifying power attacked the nomological light beam!

However, the light beam didn’t have the slightest fluctuation!

“You want to escape? Since you are here, you still want to escape? is that possible?”

...

Rumble Rumble Rumble

In the next moment, the tiger chaotic demon country’s old country teacher led all the top warriors of the tiger chaotic demon country over, his face cold as he locked onto them!

“Damn it, run, RUN BACK TO YOUR UNDYING COUNTRY!”

Seeing them arrive, the demon Slayer sect and one of the forces on Black Cloud planet’s faces changed, immediately wanting to escape!

However very quickly they were shocked to discover that they couldn’t contact their God country at all!

This caused their eyes to widen, filled with shock and despair!

“Sou Sou Sou!”

At this moment, the old imperial preceptor made a move. He extended his arm and grabbed a person’s neck, his eyes filled with ice-cold!

The other experts also immediately made a move and captured him. They stared at the people from the demon slaying sect’s black cloud star faction with killing intent!

“I’m sorry star Goddess, I’ve disturbed your concert, please continue!”

Chaotic Tiger Country Leader looked at the stage and smiled at Star Lady, after which they left with the group!

“It’s Alright, don’t panic, within the Dragon Star, the Dragon Palace and Chaotic Tiger Demon Country can protect your safety. Look, those 20 over undyings were easily captured, they didn’t even escape!”

Emperor Star Lady stood on the stage, smiling as she said to everyone!

“Damn, I almost pissed myself just now, these 20 undyings, it looks like they want to kill and make the dragon star suffer losses!”

“It should be, what were those beams of light just now? They seemed to fall from the 9 planets in the sky, too powerful, trapping 20 undyings!”

“Luckily the Tiger Chaos Demon Country and Dragon Palace were prepared, otherwise I would have been finished!”

As the Emperor Star Lady’s voice fell, the shocked people were discussing with pale faces!
