Chapter 896: 0897 during the day

Translator: 549690339

The strange demon had evolved into a light thorn. Their most powerful assassination was during the day, and at night, they were not as strong as during the day.

Moreover, the strange demon discovered that the members of the horned shark mercenary group were very vigilant. Their vigilance at night was even higher than during the day.

The strange demon grasped this time and opportunity to directly enter the horned shark mercenary group.

After entering, some members of the horned shark mercenary group were still cultivating, while some had already started to put on their clothes and wash up.

“I’ve been on guard for a whole night!”

In a room, a young man was wearing his clothes with slight dissatisfaction.

“Hehe, Kid, you should know that raising your guard is to protect your own life. Although it’s a waste of a night to be on guard, it’s still worth it!”

The middle-aged man who was in the same room as the young man reminded with a smile.

“It’s best to kill that fellow as soon as possible. It saves us so much trouble. HMPH, he dared to kill the daughter of our vice-leader. If we meet him in the wild, his life would be worse than death. Let him know how powerful our horned shark mercenary group is!”

The young man still said with some dissatisfaction.

“Don’t worry. Our leader is also paying attention to this matter now. That kid will die very soon!”

The middle-aged man said with confidence.

“I heard that that Brat is also a heaven’s chosen. He entered the demon Hunter Academy with the result of first place. HMPH, what a pity, he doesn’t have a brain!”

The corners of the young man’s mouth curled up slightly, and his eyes were filled with schadenfreude.

“Uncle Li, throw my sword over!”

The young man tidied his clothes and stretched out his hand as he said.

“HMM, uncle Li?”

The young man suddenly realized that the middle-aged man didn’t respond, nor did he make any sound. He turned his head around in puzzlement.

Suddenly, his eyes widened, filled with disbelief.

“Eh, Cough Cough Cough!”

The young man clutched his neck, his eyes filled with terror.

Soon after, his consciousness slowly disappeared and he fell to the ground.

At the same time, the same thing happened in the other rooms.

“Hu!”

In a room in the center, ao Kuang was sitting cross-legged and cultivating.

Suddenly, two balls of light appeared in the air.

The white light had patterns on it, making it look like a completely white eye that was filled with strangeness!

Piercing pupil!

The extraordinary third level light piercing divine ability, piercing pupil!

Piercing pupil could instantly find the opponent’s weakness.

It could clearly see the enemy’s weak points in defense.

The light piercing dragon was another powerful divine ability.

“Buzz!”

When piercing pupil was activated, ao Ao Yao instantly charged towards Ao Kuang.

Transcendence level three assassinating transcendence level five!

Crossing two stages!

“Boom!”

“Who dares to assassinate me!”

However, the moment ao ao Yao attempted to assassinate him, ao Kuang opened his eyes and shot out a terrifying cold light as he coldly roared.

“Die!”

When Ao Kuang saw Ao Yao who was already in front of him, he roared angrily. In an instant, his entire body was like an erupting volcano.

A terrifying flame attacked Ao Yao.

When Ao Yao saw that he was discovered by AO Kuang, his expression did not change at all.

His sharp fist instantly arrived in front of Ao Yao.

“Buzz!”

At this moment, ao Yao increased his speed and directly met the terrifying flaming fist.

“What?”

When ao Kuang felt that he was about to hit his opponent, his fist actually directly pierced through.

How was this possible? How could his senses be wrong?

His opponent seemed to have turned into air.

Divine ability, nothingness.

At this moment, a sharp claw pierced through Ao Kuang’s body.

Ao Kuang was shocked once more, and a hint of fear appeared on his face.

The claw pierced through his heart!

Why didn’t it Pierce through him directly? Could it be that he had discovered the heart armor on his chest?

How was this possible!

“Pu!”

In just an instant, the claw pierced through his heart, stirring it slightly.

“Die!” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Ao Kuang opened his eyes wide, blood and tears appeared in his eyes. With a wild howl, he gathered the power in his body and attacked in front of him.

“Whoosh!”

Ao Yao’s expression changed drastically. He quickly flew into the air and escaped into the distance.

“Damn you, don’t even think about escaping!”

Ao Kuang howled and the entire house was shattered under the terrifying power.

“Who dares to barge in?”

At this moment, an angry roar came from the side, and he quickly rushed out of the room.

When he rushed out of the room, he immediately saw that Ao Kuang’s room had already been shattered. His entire body was burning with flames as he stood there.

“Ao Kuang, who is he?”

The face of the captain of the horned shark mercenary group was extremely gloomy, and he roared at Ao Kuang in a deep voice.

However, ao Kuang did not reply. The Flames on his body slowly disappeared and he stood there stiffly.

The captain’s face changed drastically. He moved and instantly appeared in front of Ao Kuang.

When he saw the bloody hole on his chest, his expression changed drastically.

However, he suddenly widened his eyes and stared at his surroundings in disbelief.

“Ka Ka!”

“Commander, what happened?”

At this moment, a middle-aged man and an old man walked out from three to four rooms and asked with a surprised expression.

Commander dogfish swept his gaze across the other rooms with a solemn expression and took a deep breath. “Go to the other rooms and take a look!”

“Yes, it’s commander!”

The seven to eight people widened their eyes and their expressions slowly darkened. They hurriedly walked towards the rooms at the side.

“What happened? !”

At this moment, voices rang out one after another. In the sky, a woman and a dozen city guards flew toward them.

The dogfish mercenary group was located in the center of Holy Sea Town. Next to it was a bustling street.

The arrogant roar, the violent aura, and the sound of the houses exploding instantly attracted many people around them.

Especially at the place where the house exploded, there was a gap, so many people could see the situation inside the base of the dogfish mercenary group.

“Leader, the others have all disappeared. There are blood stains on the ground, and... There are red pieces of paper!”

Seven or eight people walked out of the rooms one by one, with their eyes wide open, and said with a terrified tone.

The leader of the Dogfish mercenary group had a gloomy expression on his face and did not say anything.

Today, there were more than forty people from the dogfish mercenary group living here, and only seven or eight of them survived.

Among them, vice leader Ao Kuang was also dead.

“Red Paper?”

When the woman who flew over from the sky heard the words ‘Red Paper’, her face revealed surprise.

The city guards behind her also looked at each other in shock.

“What happened to Captain Shark?”

The woman flew into the courtyard and asked with a frown.

“Look, it’s Ao Kuang. He... he actually...”

At this moment, a city guard’s shocked voice suddenly came from the side.

Ao Kuang was the vice-captain of the shark mercenary group, an extraordinary fifth rank expert.

In holy sea town, he was also a big shot. His strength could definitely be ranked in the top 50. Now, he was actually assassinated.

“More than 30 members died. More than 30 people died!”

Captain Dogfish’s body trembled, and his eyes were bloodshot.

However, when they heard Captain Dogfish’s words, everyone’s expression changed slightly.

“Creak!”

At this moment, the magnificent ten-meter-wide door of the Dogfish mercenary group was pushed open, and a sound was heard.

Everyone looked over, and their pupils couldn’t help but shrink again.

On the door was a two-meter-wide red piece of paper.

Below it were three lines of words from the transcendent continent.

“This piece of paper is called Congratulations!”

“Congratulations on your death!”

“Dragon Assassin Organization!”
