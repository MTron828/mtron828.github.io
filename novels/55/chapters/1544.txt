Chapter 1545: 1545 suppressing all heaven’s favorites 8

At the banquet venue, young master Tian laughed out loud. He was still looking at Wang Xian with a smile on his face.

He didn’t want to repeat his words for the second time. This was a clear indication of his attitude.

His arrogant attitude was as though he didn’t want to repeat his words to an ant.

Disregard, blatant disregard.

As soon as young master Tian finished his sentence, the surrounding atmosphere instantly froze.

Although Young Master Tian was laughing, many people could feel his dissatisfaction.

Towards this priest Wang’s dissatisfaction.

Everyone was slightly shocked!

“Is that priest Wang courting death? He actually dares to defy young master Tian!”

“He’s really arrogant, he even dares to refute young master Tian’s words. Does he really think that he can rely on the He clan and he Sui clan to protect him?”

“Anyone who dares to go against Young Master Tian and young master di of our sect will not have a good ending. is that priest Wang courting death?”

The surrounding people felt young master Tian’s impatience and anger. They were slightly shocked and whispered.

They looked at Wang Xian as if they were looking at an idiot.

“Brother Wang Xian!”

He Yuan’s expression changed slightly when he saw this scene. He shouted at him in a low voice.

The two young masters of Heaven and Earth, the Heaven’s Pride Disciples of the Super Forces, were not to be trifled with.

“Long time no see. Let’s go and have a cup of tea!”

Wang Xian chose to ignore him and said to he yuan indifferently.

He didn’t want to repeat it a second time?

When Wang Xian heard this sentence, he wanted to laugh!

He ignored him and said to he yuan. Then, he walked towards the table at the side.

When he yuan saw Wang Xian’s actions, a hint of bitterness appeared on his face.

He took a glance at young master Tian, whose expression turned gloomy instantly. He sighed in his heart.

Although young master heaven-defying was talented and had a strong background, it was a pity that the one you provoked was a sky demon.

Would a crazy sky demon who was invincible within the seventh level of the Seethrough realm care about your identity and background?

Would he lower his head for a person at the third level of the Seethrough Realm? What a joke.

“Very good, very good. It’s been a long time since anyone dared to disobey me and provoke me!”

At this moment, looking at Wang Xian walking towards a table with no regard for him, the smile on young master Tian’s face disappeared completely.

He stared at Wang Xian coldly.

“What?”

“This... This is not giving young master tian any face at all!”

“It’s more than not giving him face. This is a slap in the face. Ignore, completely ignore young master Tian!”

Everyone around widened their eyes. Their eyes were filled with disbelief.

“He’s courting death. How dare he disobey young master Tian. Surround him!”

Bing Jinghuan was slightly stunned when he saw that Wang Xian did not pay any attention to young master Tian. Following that, a hint of excitement flashed across his eyes.

He waved his arm and the people from the bingxin empire immediately surrounded Wang Xian.

The disciples of the solipsistic sect who were standing behind young master Tian and young master di also stared at Wang Xian coldly and slowly surrounded him.

“How dare you ignore our senior brother Tian? I sentence you to die!”

A young man from the solipsistic sect stared at Wang Xian coldly.

He also declared his sentence to Wang Xian with an air of superiority.

The people from the Bingxin Empire surrounded Wang Xian and the people from the solipsistic sect followed closely behind to surround him.

Upon seeing this scene, everyone held their breaths. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Young Master Tian, young master Di, this is the banquet venue for the Crown Prince of Wuqing City. This... forget it!”

He Yuan took a deep breath when he saw this scene. He said with an embarrassed expression.

“The current you is not qualified to say such words to me!”

Young Master Tian swept a cold glance at he yuan. He stared at Wang Xian and said expressionlessly, “It’s been a long time since someone provoked me. I want to let others know that the outcome of provoking me will be the same as yours!”

“You dare to provoke Young Master Tian? You really have a way out. If you don’t walk through Hell, you’ll just barge in!”

“You brought this upon yourself. A radiant priest actually dares to provoke young master Tian. TSK TSK!”

“There’s no need for young master Tian to make a move at all. This fellow can be killed ten times!”

When some of the surrounding disciples saw young master Tian being completely enraged, they raised their heads and shouted at Wang Xian while trying to curry favor with him!

Wang Xian stopped and swept his gaze across the crowd surrounding him. He swept his gaze across the disciples who were trying to curry favor with young master Tian and reprimanded him. Finally, his gaze landed on young master Tian. A hint of coldness and arrogance flashed across his eyes.

“Ending? In my opinion, all of you, including the two of you, are trash!”

Wang Xian looked at young master Tian and young master Di and said coldly.

As soon as he said that, everyone was shocked. They stared at Wang Xian in disbelief.

At this moment, he actually dared to provoke young master Tian and young master di. Furthermore, this time, it was a blatant humiliation.

Calling the two young masters of Heaven and earth as trash?

This...

This was simply too arrogant. He was really seeking his own death!

“F * ck, cool, this is simply too cool!”

At the side, when he suiwen heard Wang Xian’s words, a fiery look shot out from his eyes as he roared in his heart.

F * ck, as expected of the Sky Demon. So what if you are the Master of Heaven and earth? I will call you both trash in front of you!

This is simply too domineering. You are indeed worthy of the name of the Sky Demon.

“There are too many words for a dead person!”

A terrifying killing intent suddenly shot out of young master Tian’s eyes.

Young master di also raised his head slightly. The crown on his head emitted a faint pressure.

...

“I really didn’t expect that priest Wang to have such terrifying strength. He single-handedly destroyed two rank seven void interpretation experts, and in a short period of time, he destroyed a second-rate force and established the heartless sword path sect!”

At this moment, Wu Qingcheng’s eyes were still filled with shock as he walked towards the Black Lotus Lake.

Beside him were Wu Qingyan and Wu Qingyan.

“We also didn’t expect that he would actually...”. “He’s actually so monstrous. Heavens, a rank seven profound void martial expert who’s not even thirty years old and he killed two rank seven profound void martial experts. This is too heaven-defying. No wonder we went over to teach him a lesson and were easily defeated by him!”

At this moment, Wu Qingyan and Wu Qingyan’s small faces were also filled with shock.

Not long ago, they had gotten their subordinates to look for priest Wang’s information and sent it to them.

As a super force, the information of the Wuji Empire was unparalleled in the entire vast region.

In just a few days, all the information about Wang Xian was gathered.

When they saw the contents of the information, the three of them were stunned for a very, very long time.

One was a seventh level Seethrough void martial artist who was less than 30 years old, while the other was a peerless genius.

The so-called Heaven’s favorites in the vast region, even Wu Qing Cheng, felt that they were trash in Wang Xian’s eyes.

Wu Qingyan and Wu Qing Yan’s mouths were slightly agape. They recalled the last time when the two of them rushed over to teach him a lesson.

If Wang Xian really let them off, he could easily crush them to death.

How could a young man from that small place in Liuhai district be so heaven-defying?
