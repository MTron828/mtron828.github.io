“Here they come. Haha, Good, good. This time, regardless of whether the Dragon Palace has 50 immortals or 100 immortals, they must die!”

“After the Dragon Palace is destroyed, anyone on earth who dares to resist us will all die!”

Godly king Okudin’s eyes shone with a bright light as he slowly stood up.

“This time, I will let everyone on Earth know the consequences of offending me, Okudin. If you dare to kill my daughter, I will tear her into pieces and make everyone in the world despise him!”

“Divine King, after this battle, everyone will have to submit to my Nordic Divine Realm!” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The white-bearded old man quickly stood up. “In the future, you will not only be the king of all gods, but also the king of all Immortals!”

“Wise man, I hope that as you have analyzed, this Dragon King will have a decent strength and will be able to come over tomorrow. Otherwise, there will be no meaning at all!”

Divine King Okerdin waved his hand and said indifferently.

“Eighty percent confidence!”

The white-bearded old man said with confidence.

Around them, the immortals of the Yuwen clan sucked in a breath of cold air. Their eyes were filled with shock as they watched.

“As expected of the strongest northern European divine realm in the west. As expected of the godly monarch!”

The Yuwen Clan Grand Elder’s face was filled with astonishment. His eyes flickered as he looked at the white-bearded elder.

The white-bearded elder was called the wise man. He was the wise man of the Northern European divine realm.

He had always been the most important right-hand man of the auxiliary godly monarch. This wise man in front of him had assisted three generations of godly monarchs in total.

His lifespan had already reached around 450 years old.

This time, it was his intention to pass on the power of the Nordic divine realm and the Yuwen clan.

In fact, the power that was passed out had ten immortal gods hidden in the Nordic divine realm.

They had a total of 60 immortal gods.

However, that was not all. Seeing the 60 immortal gods that came over again, he was amazed.

This time, even if the Dragon King had three heads and six arms, he was doomed!

Thinking of this, a cold expression appeared on his face.

“Prepare everything and wait for the arrival of the Dragon King!”

The white-bearded old man sat on the chair and flipped through the information in his hands. His face was filled with confidence.

...

“Seventy-eight immortals, over four thousand experts in the infant and Dan Stages. This is a good opportunity for the Dragon Palace to train their soldiers!”

In Jiang City, Wang Xian stood at the top of the Floating Island Villa. He smiled as he read the information sent over by the demonic Azure Dragon.

“Dragon King, Prime Minister Gui is bringing a group of civil officials from the Dragon Palace over. In the past, it was all talk on paper. This is a real drill!”

Ao Jian said to Wang Xian from the side.

Wang Xian nodded. “Good. It’s rare to have an opponent. Use It well. Otherwise, it would be a waste!”

Wang Xian did not put the king of the Nordic celestial realm and the Yuwen clan in his eyes. In his opinion, they were a good training ground for the Dragon Palace.

From the beginning to the end, the Dragon Palace did not encounter any opponents. This time, they passed the test.

Seventy-eight immortals and four to five thousand infant stage powerhouses at the Dan stage barely passed the test.

“Tomorrow morning, we don’t need the Nordic celestial realm and the Yuwen clan to look for us. Let’s go look for them!”

The corners of Wang Xian’s mouth curled up slightly as he said confidently.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Ao jian nodded respectfully.

Wang Xian stood at the top of the villa with an indifferent expression as he looked ahead with a smile.

However, he didn’t know that Wang Xian’s thoughts had already been predicted by others.

Meanwhile, the Norse celestial domain and the Yuwen clan were already waiting for his arrival.

The next morning, today, was three days later. It was the Nordic Divine King’s day of revenge for the Yuwen clan.

Today, the entire world, from the immortal sects to the warriors who had just cultivated for a year, was paying attention to this battle.

The Real Battle of the century!

...

“Hello, everyone. This is the Huaxia Warriors’live broadcast platform. We are currently in Jiang City. Everyone, please look into the distance. Look, that is the Dragon King’s Floating Island. It is said that the Dragon King is currently on the Floating Island!”

“We can connect to another streamer. He is currently in the Yuwen clan. Today, we will be live broadcasting this battle!”

As time passed, the television stations of the past had also undergone changes. There were many more martial artists’live broadcast platforms and teaching platforms.

The Huaxia Martial Artists’live broadcast platform was the largest platform. Now, it was even more important to carry out a live broadcast of this battle that all humans were paying attention to.

At this time, hundreds of millions of people had already gathered on the platform to watch.

Besides those watching on the live broadcast platform, the real powerhouses, such as the immortal God level, half-step immortal God level, and infant realm level, were all located not far away from Jiang city and the Yuwen clan.

They were ready to watch this terrifying battle with their own eyes.

The power of this battle would far surpass the battle between the Holy Doctor, Holy Medicine, and Immortal sect and the Dragon King.

“There’s no movement on the Dragon King’s Floating Island. We can also see that there’s no movement on the Yuwen clan’s position. It’s 8:30 in the morning, so there should be some movement soon. Everyone, wait patiently!”

“Everyone, do you think that the Nordic divine realm and the Yuwen clan will win this battle, or the Dragon King’s Dragon Palace?”

At 8:30 in the morning, both the floating island and the Yuwen clan were silent, like the calm before a storm.

As soon as the streamer asked this question, a voting area appeared. In an instant, the number of votes reached over a million.

Among them, 99% of them thought that the Norse celestial realm and the Yuwen clan would win, and the Dragon King Dragon Palace would be destroyed!

“88 immortals vs members of the Dragon Palace, the Dragon King vs The Godly King. The members of the Dragon Palace will probably be completely defeated. Unless the Dragon King defeats the godly king, the Dragon Palace and the Dragon King will be destroyed!”

“That’s right. There’s no movement on the floating island. has the Dragon King already escaped? If he really escaped, it would completely prove that the Dragon King is not as good as the Godly King!”

In the void around Jiang City, the immortals from the immortal sects were hiding in the white clouds. They looked down and whispered.

Similarly, there were many immortal gods from the Yuwen clan hiding in the void around River City.

There was no movement from either side!

“It seems that everyone thinks that the Nordic god’s domain and the Yuwen clan will win. I think so too. I’m afraid that they will really have to slay the dragon this time. Eighty-eight immortal gods. This is too terrifying!”

The live streamer flew in the sky on his flying sword as he spoke to the audience.

“Oh my God? What’s going on?”

At this moment, the streamer suddenly widened her eyes. Her eyes were filled with disbelief.

“Oh my God, the power of the Dragon King! The power of the Dragon King! !”

“Boom! Boom!”

While the streamer was in shock, terrifying creatures suddenly flew out from the bottom of the ocean below the floating island.

Among the nine flood dragons, there was a throne that the Dragon King was sitting on.

At the back, there was a beautiful woman standing beside the Dragon King with a fan and a pair of wings behind her.

On the other side, an old man with a turtle shell glanced around with a wise gaze.

Finally, a group of creatures with a terrifying aura.
