“The elites of the pinnacle races have appeared. In such a short period of time, there are actually two elites from the pinnacle races.”

“Those are the 12-winged angels. They are the true masters of the universe, the strongest existences in our universe!”

“Hiss, is that the elven race’s Lord? What a perfect existence. The Elven race’s arrow of life is the strongest archer in the universe, chasing after the sun and moon, hunting the heavens and earth!”

A shocked voice came from the surroundings. Everyone looked at the two figures that had appeared.

The water in the sky had already stopped flowing. It seemed to have encountered a terrifying resistance.

The two figures stood there quietly. It gave people the feeling that they were at the center of the world.

Holy, terrifying, and not to be looked at directly!

A wave of reverence rose in everyone’s hearts.

“That sister gives me a very intimate feeling.”

Lingling whispered into Wang Xian’s ear.

Wang Xian nodded his head slightly. “All of you belong to the same race.”

“Sound of life arrow, I want this water lotus. You Can’t compete with me.”

At this moment, the twelve-winged angel who was in the middle turned his head and looked at the Great Elf of the Arrow of life. He spoke faintly.

“Archangel Baili, how would we know if we don’t try? Besides, this guardian has been here for billions of years. How could he let you take him away?”

The Great Elf of the arrow of life said calmly.

The arrow of the Arrow of life was the name of this great elf.

Once the Elf clan stepped into the universe ruler realm, they would take life as their surname.

“If he doesn’t let me, I’ll kill him.”

Baili’s Archangel said confidently.

He swept his gaze around and waved his arm.

“Hong Hong Hong!”

The next moment, a large number of angels appeared around him.

There were six-winged angels, eight-winged angels, and ten-winged angels.

There were over a million of them, and there were over a hundred powerful ten-winged angels among them!

“Hiss, this is the Angel Army, a powerful Angel Army!”

“This… This is the power of a 12-winged archangel? This is too terrifying!”

Everyone looked at the army of over a million angels, their faces filled with fear.

That terrifying aura made them shiver.

The six-winged angels were the weakest, but they had at least the power of a universe knight at Level 7, and they were strong enough to reach level 8.

The hundreds of ten-winged angels all had universe master level two or even level three power.

This was a terrifying being at the universe master level of a pinnacle race.

With a wave of his hand, he had a million legions.

However, this was also related to the characteristics of the angel race. The battle angels of the Angel race were war machines.

They were similar to the skeleton race, a pinnacle race.

The Dominators of the skeleton race even had an even larger army.

“Seal off the surrounding area. Kill anyone who comes near!”

Archangel Baili ordered faintly.

“It’s Archangel Baili!”

All the Angels immediately responded. Under the lead of over a hundred ten-winged angels, they flew to the surrounding area and formed an incomparably large encirclement.

Some of the experts around hurriedly retreated. Their eyes were filled with shock.

“Is this an existence at the level of a universe overlord?”

Some of the experts muttered.

Wang Xian’s gaze was similarly shining. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

At their peak, those dragon kings who were at the level of a universe overlord also possessed such might.

They walked across the starry sky, made way for the ocean, and were supported by countless experts from the Dragon Palace!

“Don’t attack when I kill this guy.”

Archangel Baili looked at this expert of the ELF race and said lightly.

Life sound arrow frowned slightly, and his bright eyes seemed to be able to see through the ground.

“How about you try it with it, and then I’ll attack.”

Archangel baili smiled and said confidently.

“If you can suppress it, I won’t do it. If not, don’t blame me.”

The Voice of life replied indifferently.

“Alright, Remember.”

The archangel nodded.

The rules set by the strong were usually not broken.

And as a race at the pinnacle of the universe, they would not rashly clash.

The archangel stared below and with a move of his hand, an Archangel’s sword and shield appeared in his hand.

“Will you hand over the water lotus to me, or shall I suppress you?”

Archangel baili stared at the ground below and said coldly.

“Roar Roar!”

The next moment, an angry roar came from below. Following that, an incomparably terrifying tentacle drilled out from the water and attacked him.

The entire tentacle was incomparably huge and emitted a terrifying aura.

“Holy Light Slash!”

Baili’s Archangel wielded his angel Greatsword and slashed towards the tentacle.

“Boom!”

An incomparably resplendent light illuminated the starry sky. The Holy Light Longsword directly slashed at the tentacle.

“Pu!”

The Holy Light Slash entered the tentacle and a large amount of blood flowed out.

“Anyone who wants to fight for my treasure must die.”

At this moment, a sharp female voice came from below. Several hundred terrifying tentacles rushed over from the bottom of the river once again.

Water droplets rushed towards the sky.

Each water droplet was as heavy as a vast mountain peak as they attacked the Archangel.

“Peng Peng Peng!”

The Archangel raised his shield, and the water droplets made a loud sound as they fell on it.

“Light Judgement Sword!”

He waved his arm, and the longsword in his hand stabbed downwards.

The entire longsword seemed to instantly become a hundred times bigger as it descended from the sky.

“Boom!”

At the location below, a terrifying whirlpool formed, directly absorbing the longsword.

Following that, the whirlpool charged out directly, sweeping towards the Archangel Baili.

“You’re courting death, you’re so stubborn!”

“Angel Country, Angel Battle Hymn, Kill!”

His entire body trembled, and the wings on his body slightly spread out. Numerous angel Phantoms condensed, directly attacking downwards.

The whirlpool quickly collapsed.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

At this moment, an incomparably large body was revealed on the surface of the water.

The incomparably large astral beast was over 10,000 kilometers in size, and its tentacles were terrifyingly long.

It could extend over a hundred million kilometers.

This astral beast was hundreds of times the size of a planet.

It waved its tentacles, and the densely packed tentacles attacked the Baili Archangel.

“Kingdom of Heaven, Move!”

A shadow of the Kingdom of angels appeared behind him, and a beam of white light shot toward the tentacles.

Boom! Boom! Boom

The extremely terrifying collision was heard once again.

Wang Xian and the rest moved and retreated into the distance. He looked at the battle in front of him in astonishment.

Was this the strength of a true master of the Universe?

The aftermath made them tremble.

“Get out of my territory. Otherwise, I will make you pay a terrible price!”

The Voice of the Space Beast rang out again. Dense tentacles blotted out the sky and covered the Sun.

It was extremely violent!
