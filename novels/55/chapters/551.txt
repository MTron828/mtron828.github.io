Chapter 552: My Name Will Start To Spread (1)

Wang Xian stood by the side, listened to their conversation, and was completely shocked.

He stared blankly at the image on the Memento Stone.

I had not expected someone to have entered reality and gotten their hands on this information. It would seem like this world will surface in reality soon!

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered and he felt a sense of urgency suddenly.

If a world like this were to surface, Inborn experts would be everywhere. People in the Dan Realm wouldn’t be considered experts and one would have to be a Budding Realm expert to rule over a small area.

In fact, even Immortal Realm experts might be present.

At that time, what would Dragon Sect be before them? They probably would be crushed and overwhelmed completely.

For him, even if he had turned into a divine dragon, he wouldn’t win against these Immortals who knew powerful skills and battle techniques!

I’ve got to increase my level soon. Otherwise...

For the first time, Wang Xian felt a sense of urgency.

He had to reach Level 9 so he could remain fearless when facing Immortal Realm experts.

“Qianmei, you are here too! What a coincidence!”

At this moment, the voice of a middle-aged woman came from the side.

Tsk!

Mentor Yu snorted at the middle-aged lady and wasn’t hiding her annoyance with her.

“Hehe! Huh? You have a new disciple? There’s a new disciple who is willing to join Mt. Fengyu?”

The beautiful middle-aged lady looked at Wang Xian with a smile. “Hey kid, Mt. Fengyu is among the bottom three of the twenty mountain sects. They don’t even have a Dan Realm disciple. Did you get scammed here?”

“Lengyan, shut your mouth!”

Upon hearing her words, Mentor Yu stared harshly at her.

“Did I say something wrong? I’m just letting an ignorant kid understand the picture and not be scammed by others. Hehehe!”

The beautiful middle-aged lady who was being addressed as Lengyan chuckled and stared back at Mentor Yu with ridicule.

“The matters of my Mt. Fengyu have nothing to do with you!” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Mentor Yu clenched her fist tightly but released it shortly after while glowering at the middle-aged lady.

Tsk!

Lengyan lifted her head slightly and stared back at Mentor Yu in a confrontational pose.

Attendant Liu shook his head bitterly and walked to the side. Clearly, he had no intention to interrupt.

“Master, if he’s joining Mt. Fengyu, he can’t be talented. One could easily tell that he’s a rookie!” said the girl beside Lengyan with ridicule.

The girl had thin lips and almond-shaped eyes with the ends inclining up. Overall, her appearance wasn’t pleasing.

“That’s a given. If he were a talent, he wouldn’t be joining Mt Fengyu!” Lengyan chuckled.

“Hey, little brother, do you want me to guide you a little?” the girl turned around and asked Wang Xian with a face of contempt.

“Attendant Liu! Please register my disciple!”

Seeing and hearing the two of them criticizing and ridiculing Wang Xian, the sword in Mentor Yu’s hand was shaking a little while she spoke to Attendant Liu.

“Alright. What’s your name?” Attendant Liu responded immediately and asked loudly.

“Wang Xian!” Wang Xian replied in an emotionless tone. He turned around and looked at the girl with almond-shaped eyes.

“Please guide me along!”

In the next instant, Wang Xian drew his sword and pointed it at the girl.

“What?”

Attendant Liu was about to register Wang Xian’s name when he suddenly heard Wang Xian. He was taken aback and was shocked to witness what Wang Xian was doing.

Mentor Yu, Lengyan, and that girl were also taken by surprise.

Mt. Fengyu had been one of the strongest three mountain sects in the past. Since Mentor Yu’s husband, Huo Fengyu, died and their elite disciples were killed, their overall strength had declined and was ranked among the bottom three at this moment.

Currently, all the disciples of Mt. Fengyu were the “leftovers” from the other major mountain sects.

Over the last two years, no new disciples had joined Mt. Fengyu and the resources allocated to it had been declining over the years.

Those who had joined Mt. Fengyu definitely wouldn’t be disciples with ambitions or talent.

Yet, this dim-looking guy that Mentor Yu had brought over wanted to challenge Lengyan’s disciple.

Lengyan’s disciple would at least be of Pinnacle Inborn level.

“You must be courting death!”

Seeing that Wang Xian had the guts to challenge her, that girl wasn’t furious at all. Instead, she looked at Wang Xian with contempt and ridicule.

She swung her arm, drew her longsword and pointed directly at Wang Xian.

“Wang Xian, stop!”

Surprised by Wang Xian drawing his sword, Mentor Yu was astonished and wanted to stop him immediately.

“Since he had drawn his sword, there’s no reason to retract it back. Qianmei, could it be that you are trying to interfere with the sparring of disciples?” Lengyan stared at Mentor Yu and spoke with a radiant smile.

“Let’s get started!”

Wang Xian had no intention of stopping at all. The longsword in his hands instantly released greyish water energy. Illusory Swords appeared and completely covered his presence.

“Illusory Swords? Hehe! Let me teach you that you should keep a low profile!”

The girl with the almond-shaped eyes smirked and her sword glowed in dazzlingly blue light.

“I’ll counter your Illusory Swords in a single strike!” the girl shouted nonchalantly as she lunged ahead with her longsword.

Wang Xian flexed his muscles and over a hundred Illusory Swords shot towards that girl.

At the same time, a water clone held his longsword and charged ahead.

“Break!”

The longsword in the girl’s hand descended from above and clashed heavily with the Illusory Swords.

Countless Illusory Swords were erased instantly as the longsword shot towards that human figure.

Seeing that the human figure wasn’t attempting to dodge, ruthlessness gleamed in the eyes of that girl. She didn’t hold back her strength at all.

Bam!

Sounds of swords clashing resonated as the human figure was slashed apart by the descending sword.

“Shit!”

The next instant, the girl’s expression sank. Three razor-sharp water swords were shot towards her vital spots and it was too late for her to dodge.

“Presumptuous!”

When Lengyan witnessed the development of the battle, her expression changed drastically. She waved her arm and a water shield appeared before the girl instantly.

Bam! Bam! Bam!

The water swords fell on the shield.

The girl’s face was covered in cold sweat. Her eyes widened and were filled with disbelief as she stared at Wang Xian, who was standing five meters away.

Wang Xian pulled back his arms and the sword returned to his hand. He turned to Mentor Yu and said, “Mentor Yu, which mountain sect is she from?”

“Mt. Leng!”

Mentor Yu was taken aback but she soon gave Wang Xian a smile as she replied.

“Trash!” Wang Xian remarked plainly. This shocked Mentor Yu once again as her smile deepened.

“Attendant Liu, we will be leaving now. Don’t forget to register him!”

Mentor Yu’s lips curved up slightly as she spoke to Attendant Liu before walking out.

Dang!

Wang Xian put his longsword back in its scabbard and followed behind Mentor Yu, leaving the embarrassed Lengyan and her disciple.

And the dumbfounded Attendant Liu.

“Going forward, keep a low profile in the mountain sect. When you reach the Dan Realm, you can then start showing your edge. You are still a little too weak currently. Practice diligently and I’ll guide you if there’s anything you don’t understand!”

Walking out of Peak Wushi, Mentor Yu paused for a moment and reminded Wang Xian of this.

Wang Xian nodded his head silently but didn’t take the reminder to heart.

Now that information on the real world had surfaced, he was getting a little anxious.

Initially, he was preparing to grow silently, away from attention while mastering some battle techniques and tactics.

At this point, time wasn’t on his side. He had to quickly master the battle techniques and tactics while gathering more resources.

To get more resources, there was only a single way. That was to become the most glaring genius.

My name will start to spread!
