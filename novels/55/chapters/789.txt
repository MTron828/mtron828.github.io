Chapter 790: 0791 superior immortal

Translator: 549690339

The first celestial artifact was sold at a price of 1.5 million. This price had far exceeded Wang Xian’s expectations.

At the same time, it also stunned the disciples of the immortal sect in the hall.

1.5 million spirit stones. Such a terrifying amount of spirit stones was enough to create a few infant stage powerhouses.

When martial artists cultivated with spirit stones, their cultivation speed was seven to eight times faster than usual. With 1.5 million spirit stones, they could definitely create quite a number of infant stage powerhouses.

However, the value of an immortal artifact could not be measured in this way. There was a huge difference between an immortal God with an immortal artifact and one without an immortal artifact.

The first spirit sword was auctioned off for the first item. It was auctioned off at a terrifying price by the immortal slaying path immortal God.

Following that, the value of the second item dropped. It was a grade-6 medicinal pill, a medicinal pill that was very useful to any attribute martial artist.

Although the value of a grade-6 medicinal pill was far from what an immortal item could compare to, there were many people competing for it.

One bid after another, causing a grade-6 medicinal pill to be sold at the price of 50,000 spirit stones.

Following that, one item after another was quickly auctioned off.

Every item was fought over by many martial artists.

There were a total of five to six thousand martial artists who came, and all of them were relatively strong and had a lot of spirit stones. Each of them could buy a grade-6 medicinal pill.

The atmosphere of the auction was extremely heated.

Celestial artifacts, Spirit artifact sets, and grade-7 elixirs had become the items with the most intense competition in this auction.

When the auction reached its climax, the celestial sect disciples’eyes lit up as they shouted out their bids one by one.

Wang Xian, who was sitting in a private room on the third floor, revealed a smile on his face. This auction had made a huge profit.

Those spirit weapons were refined from the materials that Wang Xian had obtained from the cauldron of Yu. There was no cost involved.

The materials used to refine the weapons in the cauldron of Yu were obviously far superior to those in other worlds. He had obtained a lot of level-13 materials.

If these materials were used to refine level-13 celestial artifacts, there would be at least dozens of them. Not to mention, there were even more level-12 materials.

“Spiritual artifacts have their own accumulated materials. Elixirs have the materials provided by the natural born celestial sect. In the future, there will be an endless stream of resources coming in!”

Wang Xian laid on the chair with a satisfied expression.

One item after another was auctioned off. When the last celestial artifact was bought by a Celestial, the first auction of the Dragon Gate was considered to have ended successfully. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

A group of celestial sect disciples walked out with excited faces and chatted with each other.

Even if the people who came to the auction today were the most elite among the disciples of the Immortal Gate, their eyes were still burning with excitement as they talked about it.

It was their first time seeing so many precious items.

“This trip is really worth it. The items that the Dragon Gate took out for auction this time are too valuable. TSK TSK, it’s a pity that I can’t afford any of them!”

“F * ck, I, a dignified infant realm expert, thought that I was very rich, but I didn’t expect that I could snatch a grade-7 medicinal pill without snatching anyone else!”

“Look, the spirit tool set was bought by a descendant of an immortal god of the Ji Clan. Now that I’m wearing it, my aura has directly increased by a lot!”

“The next auction will be in two months’time. At that time, there will still be immortal God tools. TSK TSK, within these two months, I must think of a way to get some spirit stones. I must buy an item that is useful for my cultivation!”

The Immortal sect disciples walked out with some regret.

Most of the martial artists left empty-handed. Their eyes were burning with passion as they left. One could not imagine how upset they were.

Wang Xian stood on the third floor of the auction house and watched the group of martial artists leave with a smile on his face.

“Dragon King!”

At this moment, Mo Qinglong walked into the room and shouted with a smile on his face.

“Dragon King, we have gained a lot this time. An immortal from the Ji Clan took out four grade-8 pills in exchange for a celestial artifact. However, this pill is a little useless. He took out another 500,000 spirit stones to compensate us!”

“In addition, we have obtained a total of 5.3 million spiritual stones, 50 grade-6 elixirs, and 13 grade-7 elixirs in this auction!”

“As well as all kinds of grade-6, grade-7, and even grade-8 spiritual herbs!”

Mo Qinglong handed an interspatial ring to Wang Xian.

“Can the Dragon Gate Forge be open for Business Tomorrow?”

Wang Xian took the interspatial ring and asked with a twinkle in his eyes.

“Yes, Dragon King. Please hand over all the elixirs and spiritual artifacts to me. We will be able to open for business tomorrow. Moreover, we have already publicized the Dragon Gate Forge!”

“There are a total of eight cities. Eight shops will open for business tomorrow at the same time!”

Mo Qinglong nodded and said.

“Alright. Taking advantage of the popularity of the Dragon Gate auction house, we will open for business directly tomorrow. We must ensure the safety of each shop. Send four members of the Dragon Gate to guard it!”

Wang Xian said slowly.

“It’s the Dragon King. I will deal with it now!”

Mo qingyue bowed and walked out immediately.

“Xiao Xian, once the Dragon Gate forging workshop is set up, our Dragon Palace’s strength will be greatly enhanced within half a year. At that time, no other immortal sects will be our match!”

Lan Qingyue hugged Wang Xian’s arm happily.

“Of course!”

Wang Xian nodded confidently. “Let’s go. Let’s go to the entertainment area on the other side of the floating island. You guys have fun there. I want to improve my strength!”

“Let’s go, let’s go. I took a look at the modifications after yesterday. It’s too beautiful!”

The group of girls walked towards another area of the floating island happily.

Wang Xian came to one of the villas with an area of 1,000 meters. He took out the pills from his interspatial ring.

“These pills are enough to increase my dragon energy by 100 to 200 million!”

Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled as he threw the pills into his mouth one by one.

“Roar!”

On the top floor of the villa, Wang Xian transformed into the body of a divine dragon. The huge amount of dragon energy allowed his body to reach the size of 15 meters.

A terrifying awe-inspiring aura emanated from his body. As he felt the strength in his body, a smile appeared on Wang Xian’s face.

“Superior Immortal!”

After consuming all the elixirs, his dragon energy had reached 840 million. He was only 160 million away from completing the transformation.

Wang Xian moved his body and transformed back into his human form. He opened his mouth slightly and three level-13 dragon pearls appeared in front of him.

Fire Dragon Pearl, Wood Dragon Pearl, and Water Dragon Pearl.

All of them had reached level-13. One Dragon Pearl alone could rival a lower immortal.

“I still need two more dragon pearls. I have to collect them as soon as possible. In addition, with my strength, I can even fight against the two grand elders of the Xuan Yuan clan and the Yuwen clan!”
