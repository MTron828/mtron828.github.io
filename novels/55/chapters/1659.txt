Chapter 1660: 1660 in one move

When the fire cloud sparrow saw Huo Luo'er flying over, everyone’s faces were filled with shock, and they hurriedly shouted out.

The Fire Cloud Sparrow’s two profound void tier 8 experts’expressions changed slightly, wanting to directly block her.

However, Huo Luo'er’s speed caused the two of them to be slightly stunned.

“The Fire Cloud Sparrow clan’s newly matured princess, Haha, Do You Know How your two elder brothers died?”

Seeing Huo Luo'er rushing over, Shui Lianhun revealed a mocking expression and laughed mockingly.

“Princess Huo Luo'er, come back quickly!”

Behind them, the members of the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan roared with extremely ugly expressions.

If their princess was killed here, it would be a huge blow to the morale of their fire cloud sparrow clan.

“Princess, Retreat!”

In the center of the battle, Xu Xingcan shouted loudly.

“You dare to be distracted while fighting with me?”

Opposite him, Jiang Xingkong shouted coldly and smashed the huge hammer in his hand.

“After I kill you, all those under 100 years old from the life and Death Pill Workshop and the holy item forging workshop can come and challenge me!”

Hearing the exclamations of her clansmen, huo Luo'er didn’t waver at all.

There was even a hint of excitement on her small face.

“You still wet behind the ears little girl, die!”

Hearing Huo Luo'er’s words, a hint of contempt appeared on shui Lianhun’s face. She moved and directly attacked.

The target was pointed at her head.

“Haha, the Princess of the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan is going to be killed in an instant!”

“I found that the princess and Prince of the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan are all idiots. Once this princess dies, all the princesses and princes will die. Haha!”

Seeing Shui Lianhun make his move, everyone in the life and death pill workshop revealed excited expressions.

Shui Lianhun was one of the most outstanding disciples of their life and Death Pill Workshop. wasn’t he instantly killed when he fought against a little princess who was still wet behind the ears?

“Boom!”

Huo Luo'er looked at Shui Lianhun who was charging over. She held a magic staff that looked like a phoenix in her hand and gently waved it forward.

A flame appeared out of thin air around this most outstanding female disciple of the life and Death Pill Workshop.

“What?”

Shui Lian Hun’s expression changed slightly as he felt the terrifying flames around him. Blue light surged around his body and the sound of raging waves churned within his body.

“Boom!”

However, the flames directly covered him.

“This is impossible!”

Shui Lian Yi screamed in terror and despair as she felt her body being rapidly melted.

“Bang Bang!”

A broken staff and a charred corpse landed on the ground and collided.

“What?”

“How is this possible? Her strength?”

“How... How can our princess’s strength be so strong?”

Shocked voices came from the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop.

The people of the Demon God tribe also looked at Huo Luo'er, their eyes filled with shock.

Even the members of the Fire Cloud Sparrow tribe could not believe it.

Their princess had just come of age, and her strength had reached the second rank of the insightful void realm. She was already at the top of the Fire Cloud Sparrow tribe.

But now, she had killed a fifth rank insightful void realm expert in one move. Her strength was at the sixth rank of the insightful void realm?

How did their princess suddenly advance to the sixth rank of the insightful void realm?

“She has just come of age and is already at the sixth rank of the insightful void realm? Even the geniuses of the empire are only so-so!”

Mo Yuan bei frowned, staring at Huo Luo'er with a face full of surprise as he sighed.

“Life and Death Pill Workshop, Holy Item Forging Workshop, all of you young disciples, come at me together. Today, I will kill all of you!”

Huo Luo'er held her staff tightly, her gaze revealing a chill as she spoke to the two great factions.

Her somewhat tender face and voice caused people to feel somewhat dazed.

“Damn it, why is this Huo Luo'er’s strength suddenly so terrifying!”

The elders of the life and Death Pill Workshop and the holy item forging workshop looked at each other with slightly embarrassed expressions.

They had thought that with the demonic God tribe resisting the sacred fire clan, the disciples of the two forces would be able to easily suppress the fire cloud sparrow clan. They had not expected that a monstrous princess would suddenly appear.

“Attack!”

The elders of the two major factions made a decision in their hearts and nodded slowly.

An elder slowly raised his arm and released a special signal.

“Princess!”

At that moment, an elder from the fire cloud sparrow clan flew directly towards Huo Luo'er’s position.

“Elder Xuan Hua!”

Seeing the elder fly over, Huo Luo'er’s face was filled with smiles as she narrowed her eyes. She was like a good student waiting for her parents to praise her.

“Eh? Elder Xuan Hua is also here. Who Is He?”

At the fire Lark Clan’s location, some people showed a hint of doubt on their faces.

Wang Xian, who had been standing there the whole time, raised his eyebrows slightly when he saw the old man flying over.

A strange light immediately flashed in his eyes.

“Hehe, all of You Must Die!” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

On the opposite side, a few elders from the life and Death Elixir Workshop and holy item forging workshop who saw this scene showed a sinister expression on their faces.

Some disciples from the two major forces held their weapons in their hands.

Following that, the battle was about to break out.

“Princess Huo Luo'er, you’re simply too awesome!”

Elder Xuan Hua flew over with an amiable smile on his face.

“That’s because of brother Wang Xian. It’s him...”

“Go to Hell, Little Princess!”

Huo Luo'er did not sense that something was wrong at all. She spoke with a smile on her face. However, before she could finish her words, Xuan Hua’s long and amiable voice interrupted her.

At the same time, a dagger was stabbed towards Huo Luo'er.

This caused Huo Luo'er to be slightly stunned. While she was in a daze, fear appeared in her eyes.

“PFFT!”

“Masked Assassin Organization?”

However, at this moment, a sound that penetrated through flesh and blood could be heard. Wang Xian’s figure appeared behind elder Xuan Hua in an instant and asked calmly.

“Ahhhhh!”

All of a sudden, a scream came from the position of the fire Lark clan.

“Attack! Kill everyone from the fire Lark Clan!”

In an instant, the scene changed. The roar of an elder from the life and Death Elixir workshop spread across hundreds of kilometers.

“What? How dare you attack!”

“Damn it! You went back on your words and sent assassins to ambush us!”

“Aren’t you afraid that our Sacred Fire clan will fight to the death with you? !”

Everyone from the Sacred Fire clan had a drastic change in expression as they roared furiously.

This life and death arena battle had been agreed upon by their Sacred Fire clan and the two major factions. Now, the other party was actually using this place to ambush them.

The Masked Assassin organization had already entered the fire cloud sparrow clan and killed over a thousand people in an instant.

“Hahaha, leave the Sacred Fire clan to our demonic God tribe!”

At this moment, a loud laugh came from behind. Five black figures flew over quickly.

“Five rank nine profound void martial experts from the demonic God tribe!”

“All Disciples of the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan, be careful. There are masked assassins among us!”

At this moment, the elders of the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan shouted with an extremely ugly expression.

They had never expected that the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop would set up an ambush in this arena.

“When the demonic God tribe appeared, we should have thought of this!”

The two elders of the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan shouted with an ugly expression.

The sudden riot caused everyone to not notice princess Huo Luo'er’s side in the middle.
