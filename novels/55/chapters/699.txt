“Have you heard? The Immortal God has announced that our Yu Ding world will temporarily close the island and not come out. His Excellency will take out the star guide disc and let us cultivate. The star guide disc is a cultivation treasure!”

“Really? He really wants us to cultivate under the star guide disc?”

“It’s said that the star guide disc is a cultivation treasure. It can form its own starry sky. Cultivating under this starry sky is more than ten times that of the outside world. It seems that the star guide disc can only be opened for the last time. After this, the star guide disc will disappear!”

“With the star guiding disc, we will be able to reach the peak of the Dan stage in a year’s time at most. We might even be able to reach the infant stage!” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“This time, there are too many experts in the Yu Ding world who have died. The Immortal has no choice but to take out his trump card. This is a huge opportunity for us!”

Wang Xian sat in a restaurant and listened to the excited conversations of the people around him. He knocked on the table gently.

“Star induction plate, what is this? A cultivation treasure?”

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered.

“Is this a bait, or?”

Wang Xian revealed a contemplative look on his face. However, he smiled immediately after.

Regardless of whether he was a bait or not, he would be able to break the ten thousand arts by then.

“Is it here?”

At this moment, Wang Xian sensed a familiar aura. His body moved and he disappeared from the restaurant.

“Dragon King!”

When he arrived at the courtyard, Wang Xian saw Prime Minister Gui and Ao Qi. They greeted him respectfully.

“Yes.”

Wang Xian swept his gaze across them. “How is the situation in the Dragon Palace?”

“Dragon King, everything is progressing in an orderly manner. The spiritual energy waterfall has allowed many of the aquatic species in the Dragon Palace to step onto the path of cultivation.”

“In addition, six more spiritual energy waterfalls have appeared in the Huaxia region. I have already placed your blood essence into the dragon vein!”

“Miss Tang Yinxuan has awakened. She has become the princess dolphin in name. The Dolphins have all awakened their wisdom under the spiritual energy waterfalls. Furthermore, their potential is very strong!”

“In the end, the eldest princess and the Dragon Queen hope that you can return as soon as possible!”

Prime Minister GUI reported to Wang Xian.

“HMM, why is Ao Qi here?”

Wang Xian nodded his head in satisfaction. He looked at the leader of the strange prawns and asked with some doubt.

“Dragon King, the nine-headed Hui has experienced the baptism of the spiritual energy waterfall and is currently making a breakthrough. According to them, they will be able to make a breakthrough in three years at most, or at least two years.”

Prime Minister GUI explained, “That’s why I allowed Ao Qi to absorb the energy of the two immortals in the Dragon Pond!”

“Sure!”

Wang Xian nodded. “Ao Yao, get someone to check if the star steering wheel is a trap or if it’s real!”

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Ao Yao nodded and disappeared.

“He’s about to make a breakthrough!”

Wang Xian looked at Ao qi and smiled as he felt the violent lightning energy in his body.

“Yes, Dragon King. There’s still a little bit left!”

The leader of the three-meter-long strange prawns had a respectful expression on his face.

“Let me help you!”

Wang Xian waved his arm and a surge of dense dragon energy entered Ao Qi’s body directly.

Crack! Crack

In an instant, a terrifying lightning energy was transmitted from Ao Qi’s body.

Prime Minister Gui waved his arm and the earth-like energy covered the surroundings.

Lightning kept brewing in Ao Qi’s body.

Especially where his two huge arms were, dazzling lightning was flowing on his arms.

His two arms started to undergo huge changes.

One of them became like a spear, while the other looked like a hammer, an extremely sturdy hammer fist.

Crack! Crack

His tail slowly split apart from the black shrimp line, forming two strange feet.

This foot also looked like a hammer.

The shell on his body slowly covered his chest, and the shell on his back turned into something that looked like wings.

But it looked more like a windbreaker.

AOQI’s head was pointed, and his eyes were flashing with lightning.

It was very strange, but his appearance was very sharp!

He had an inexplicable sense of dominance.

“Thank you, Dragon King!”

Ao Qi stood up slowly. His body was about two meters tall. Following that, he immediately knelt on the ground and placed his hammer-like right hand on the ground.

Wang Xian was stunned for a moment before a smile appeared on his face. “Not bad, not bad.”

Ao Qi’s body was very domineering. His right hand was a hammer, his left hand was a spear, and his feet were like hammers.

Behind him was a lightning shell that looked like a windbreaker.

From his appearance, one could tell that Ao Qi’s strength was not weak.

At least, he was much stronger than the thunder god in the movie.

Wang Xian smiled.

Ten minutes later, Ao Yao’s figure appeared beside him.

“Dragon King, we have already investigated the matter regarding the star guiding disc!”

“The Jade Hand Immortal sect and corpse chief path do indeed have such a precious treasure like the star guiding disc. This afternoon, the four immortals will open the star guiding disc around their island and open up a space for everyone in Ding Yu to cultivate!”

Ao Yao reported.

“This star guiding disc can allow more than two million people to cultivate in it at the same time?”

Wang Xian revealed a look of surprise.

“It is said that the star guiding disc has a radius of five kilometers. There are less than two million people in it. However, it can last for a year!”

Ao Yao said.

“Is there really such a precious treasure? In a year’s time, the spiritual energy contained in it is more than ten times that of the outside world. It is only slightly inferior to the spiritual energy waterfall. However, the duration of the spiritual energy waterfall can not be compared to it!”

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered as he swept his gaze across the five underlings beside him.

Ao Jian, Ao Qitian, Prime Minister Gui, Ao Yao, and Ao Qi were the underlings of the five immortals.

Including him, the four immortals could fight.

“Regardless of whether this is a conspiracy or not, all of you must die!”

Wang Xian looked at the island where they lived, and his face revealed a cold glow.

Three hours passed very quickly. On the six islands, everyone from the two immortal sects was rushing towards the immortal’s island excitedly.

Some of them took ships, while others flew directly. There were more than two million people rushing over.

Wang Xian and the rest walked at the back. Their eyes were sparkling as they looked ahead.

“I heard that only 100,000 people can cultivate together at a time. I wonder how the immortal will arrange it!”

“Even if I have to cultivate in there for a month, I feel like I can break through!”

Two disciples of the Immortal sect came from the front with excited expressions.

“The Immortal God is coming out! The Immortal God is coming out!”

Just as they approached, they heard exclamations coming from the front.

Four tall figures stood in the void.

Two demonic middle-aged men were emitting terrifying demonic qi. The other two old men seemed to contain a terrifying ocean.

The might of an immortal god spread out in all directions, causing everyone’s faces to reveal reverence.

A million people stood there motionlessly, looking up at their gods.

Right at this moment, in the sky, the snow demon and blood arrow each took out a blue jade plate that was half a month long.

“Ka!”

Under everyone’s gaze, the two blue crescent jade plates fused together!
