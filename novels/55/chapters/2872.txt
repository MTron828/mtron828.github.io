Chapter 2873: invitation — Hong Fengyan’s breakthrough

Instant kill of a level two void God Emperor!

This was the current strength of Wang Xian!

“Boom Boom Boom!”

Wang Xian flapped his wings and used the wind attribute to fly rapidly.

After testing for half an hour, he returned to the sky above the ocean where the Dragon Palace was located with satisfaction.

“With my speed, one level two void God emperor can be killed instantly. Two or even three of them can also be killed by relying on speed.”

“However, there is a prerequisite. The opponent’s defensive strength can not be too terrifying. If it’s someone like the imperial dragon seed, relying on speed can only kill one of them.”

“If I want to kill myself, I must at least have the strength of a level four void God realm divine emperor. Otherwise, I wouldn’t be able to catch him without trapping me.”

Wang Xian mumbled as a smile appeared on his face.

“Huala!”

His body moved and entered the Dragon Palace.

The improvement this time was huge.

“Now that I have only completed the wind attribute and the Thunder attribute, I don’t know what abilities the complete void initiation sacred wings will have.”

“And I have relied on the void initiation sacred wings to control the wind attribute. If I can control the Thunder attribute in the future, I will be able to control nine attributes.”

“The nine attributes represent everything. If I can fuse them together, it would be terrifying.”

Wang Xian was deep in thought.

“I didn’t expect that I have been cultivating for a month.”

Looking at the time, he mumbled.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

At this moment, roars came from the position of the Dragon’s lair. The entire Dragon Palace was filled with the phantom image of the Wind God dragon formed by the wind attribute.

“Oh?”

Wang Xian was slightly stunned. His body moved and he arrived at the Dragon’s lair.

When he arrived at the Nine Wind Dragons’lair, he saw nine huge bodies entrenched there.

Six of the wind dragons raised their heads slightly and their eyes were shut tightly.

They had broken through!

There were three wind dragons not far away from them. From their auras, they had also broken through and were still cultivating.

“This is? Can the remaining wind jade allow the three wind god dragons to possess the strength of a level two void God Emperor?”

Wang Xian looked over and his eyes sparkled with excitement.

If that was the case, the increase in the strength of the Dragon Palace this time around would be very terrifying.

“Greetings, Dragon King!”

Sensing Wang Xian’s arrival, the six wind god Dragons swayed their dragon bodies. Their bodies moved and transformed into young men and women. They cupped their hands respectfully toward Wang Xian.

“Haha, good, Good, good!”

Wang Xian looked at them with a smile on his face. He swept his gaze downwards and asked, “Can they continue to improve with the remaining resources?”

“Dragon King, you have brought so many wind jade. It’s enough for our big brothers and sisters to make another breakthrough. This time, they might need about a month to make a breakthrough.”

A young wind god Dragon said respectfully to Wang Xian.

“Good, what a pleasant surprise!”

Wang Xian nodded with a smile.

“Dragon King, when can the nine of US go out and have some fun? We haven’t participated in the Great Battle of the Dragon Palace either. We have been cultivating in seclusion for a long time.”

One of the female wind god Dragons asked Wang Xian with a smile.

“I’ll let you guys go out and have some fun next time. If you guys have nothing to do, you can go out and have some fun in the imperial star field.”

A smile appeared on Wang Xian’s face.

The wind god Dragon, the purebred divine dragon of the Dragon Palace.

In the past, they were kept in the Dragon Palace due to some misgivings. Now, there was no need for that at all.

Especially after the other three wind god dragons were promoted, so what if the resplendent starry sky knew that they were the wind god Dragons?

When that time came, who would dare to provoke the Dragon Palace after destroying the witch formation and the imperial court?

“Thank you, Dragon King!”

The female wind dragon God said to Wang Xian happily.

“Come to the Dragon King’s palace. I’ll ask Prime Minister Gui to prepare some delicacies for you to celebrate.”

Wang Xian said with a smile. He moved and arrived at the Dragon King’s Palace.

He gave Prime Minister Gui some instructions.

Soon, six wind dragon God flew over. Their faces were filled with excitement.

To them, they had finally made it.

“Eh? There’s a lot of information in the communication stone plate.”

Sitting on the Dragon Chair, Wang Xian looked at the mother nest and saw a communication stone plate with a lot of information on it.

This communication stone plate was made by the Heaven Formation. Wang Xian also gave one to invincible Hong Fengyan and the rest to contact him.

Ye Lui Ying also asked him for one.

On the communication stone plate were messages sent by invincible battle technique and ye Lui Ying.

Especially invincible battle technique, which sent a total of dozens of messages.

“Boss Wang, these guys from the eight desolates are a little arrogant now. Several celestial emperors have publicly said that the Dragon Palace will be in trouble soon. Boss Wang, when are you going to kill them?”

“Boss Wang, when are you coming to the eight desolates and the six desolates?”

“Boss Wang, What are you doing? When I have the chance, I want to go to the imperial star field to have fun. I haven’t been to many places in the imperial star field. Now that I have you to take care of me, I’m invincible in battle techniques and want to explore the imperial star field.”

“Boss Wang, Ye Luying asked me if I wanted to participate in her master’s promotion ceremony. I heard that her master has broken through to the celestial thearch realm, and the Holy Region will celebrate for seven days!”

“Boss Wang, I followed my master to the Holy Region. Hahaha, this holy region is so cool. There are so many beautiful women here.”

Wang Xian looked at the invincible battle technique message. The last message was sent by him two days ago.

Looking at the messages one by one, a faint smile appeared on his face.

Then, he opened the message sent by ye Lui Ying.

The message sent by ye Lui Ying was from her master who had broken through and invited Wang Xian to the holy region’s grand banquet.

This was the only message that was released five days ago.

At that time, Wang Xian was cultivating and didn’t see it. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Hong Fengyan lifted the Kingdom of God so quickly?”

Wang Xian was slightly surprised when he saw the news. However, when he thought of a force at the level of the Holy Region, he had some understanding.

Hong Fengyan didn’t invite him. Apparently, she was a little embarrassed and asked her disciple to ask.

“Looking at their information, it should be the grand ceremony tomorrow. Looks like I won’t be able to make it in time. However, if they hold the Grand Banquet for seven days, even if I can’t make it to the first day, I will be able to make it to the second day.”

Wang Xian mumbled to himself as he prepared to make a trip to the holy region.

In addition, he was prepared to ask Hong Fengyan for a planet to build a dragon palace. This way, he would be able to teleport directly to the holy region from the Emperor Star Field. It would be more convenient if he were to go to the eight desolates and six harmonies in the future.

Furthermore, he had also told Hong Fengyan that he would go over to congratulate her when she advanced to the level of celestial thearch.

“Wait a moment, I’ll bring you guys to the Holy Region.”

Wang Xian hesitated for a moment before replying to invincible battle technique, Ye Lui Ying, and the rest. He then said to the six wind divine dragons.

“Go to the Holy Region? Sure!”

The eyes of two of the female wind divine dragons lit up and they nodded happily.

After the banquet to celebrate the breakthrough of the six wind dragons ended, Wang Xian took them away immediately and flew outside.
