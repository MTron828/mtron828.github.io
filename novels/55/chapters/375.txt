Chapter 376: Bloodbath (2)

The car was moving rapidly and the girls never stopped talking in the car. They were explaining about the Dragon Palace to Xiao Yu and Xiao Yu was constantly amazed by what she heard. She was filled with anticipation to visit it one day.

She had long forgotten about the fact that she had been poisoned. This trip felt just like another tour as she chatted constantly with the other girls.

Xiao Yu spoke about the battle she’d had with the young master of the Nine Lotus Sect.

The young master of Nine Lotus Sect was an Inborn expert. Therefore, Xiao Yu wasn’t that dumb to challenge the authority of an Inborn expert.

However, that young master constantly insulted her. He even declared that he could only use one hand to fight Xiao Yu. As a result, Xiao Yu fought with him out of anger.

Although Xiao Yu had not cultivated for long, she was already at the Half-step to Inborn Realm. Moreover, Sui Huang had been guiding her recently. Therefore, she was much stronger than normal Half-step to Inborn experts.

When the young master fought Xiao Yu with only one hand, he wasn’t gaining any advantage over Xiao Yu after ten moves. Furthermore, he was pushed into perilous situations constantly.

In the end, he used both his hands and even heavily injured Xiao Yu with the poison. When Elder Fang witnessed it, she attacked with rage and was caught in the venom too.

“Brother, you must teach that rascal a lesson on behalf of me. It would be best if you could abolish all his cultivation so he can’t act arrogantly in the future!” Xiao Yu said grudgingly.

Wang Xian smiled plainly and nodded his head.

After witnessing the scenes of the war during the establishment of the Dragon Palace and the defense of the Dragon Palace subsequently, Wang Xian’s mindset had experienced a drastic change.

War and death were what he would have to experience in the future.

He thought of the millions and billions of deaths, the annihilation of entire races and the fall of countries.

This taught Wang Xian that by being strong and powerful, one could have a better living.

If someone were to offend him, he would kill them!

War, to a great extent, had no right or wrong. It was especially so for wars between races and wars for resources.

None of the parties were wrong but billions of lives would be lost in the process.

At this moment, Wang Xian was a lot calmer when facing life and death situations.

When he came across resources, he would compete for them. If others were to compete with him, then a battle would be imminent.

If someone were to offend him or bully the people close to him, it would be the same response. Kill them!

The basis of the universe was as such unless he could become the strongest in the universe and no one dared to offend him.

Wang Xian wouldn’t kill the innocent but wouldn’t be soft to others either.

He would annihilate the Nine Lotus Sect and everyone affiliated with it would be killed!

This was because he couldn’t be sure that the remains of his enemies wouldn’t deal a fatal blow to his back one day.

The war between races would usually lead to the annihilation of one side. The side that survived would be the correct side.

Thrones were built upon the corpses of the people.

Sky City wasn’t far from Rivertown. The journey took just six hours and the group reached Sky City at around 3 pm.

The car drove towards a suburban area of Sky City.

“Young master, we have arrived!” The car stopped and Mo Yuan spoke.

“Let’s alight!”

Wang Xian stood up and carried Xiao Yu to a wheelchair before pushing the wheelchair down from the car.

“Brother, this is the place!”

Xiao Yu pointed at the location in front of them and said, “Those mountains are known as the Sky Mountains. There’s a lake there and the scenery is breathtaking. The Ancient Tomb is located right there!”

“Let’s go Xiao Yu. I will avenge you!” Wang Xian said with a smile as he pushed Xiao Yu forward.

Mo Yuan and Mo Qinglong were leading the way. Beside the wheelchair, the Heavenly Hound followed closely behind Lan Qingyue.

It kept looking at Lan Qingyue in awe and regularly rubbed against her to show affection.

Six people, a dog and a girl who was in a wheelchair. No matter how one looked at the group, they would conclude that Wang Xian and the group were tourists.

“Stop right there!”

When the six people arrived at the entrance of Sky Mountain, two young men stared at them coldly.

The two young men wore identical white uniforms with black lotuses embroidered on them.

“This area is out of bounds for ordinary people. Leave at once!”

The two young men looked across the group of six. Their attention remained on Guan Shuqing and Lan Qingyue for a little longer before shouting.

“Nine Lotus Sect?” Wang Xian looked at the two young men and asked emotionlessly.

“Brother, it’s them! They are from the Nine Lotus Sect!” Xiao Yu frowned and said to Wang Xian.

“Huh? You know we are from the Nine Lotus Sect?” The two young men lifted their heads when they heard Wang Xian. One of the young men lifted his head slightly, looked down at them and asked, “Which Family or Clan are you guys from? Since you know we are from the Nine Lotus Sect, you should also know the Ancient Tomb of Sky Mountains is now controlled by us. If you want to enter, you need to prove your worth!”

“Eh? That young brat?”

When the young man finished his sentence, the other young man looked curiously at Xiao Yu who was in the wheelchair.

“She’s the young girl who was crippled by our young master!”

“Eh! It’s really her! What gives you the guts to come again? Are you interested in becoming the concubine of our young master?”

“Haha! She courting her own demise to challenge our young master!” The two young men recognized Xiao Yu and started mocking her.

Upon hearing them, Xiao Yu was infuriated! It was apparent that the young master of the Nine Lotus Sect had insulted her countless times on that day.

“Kill them!” While the two young men were laughing, Wang Xian caressed Xiao Yu’s head and spoke plainly.

Huh?

Wang Xian’s voice was cold and emotionless and surprised the two young men. They stopped laughing and gave Wang Xian a harsh stare.

“Rascal, do you know this is...”

Before they finished their sentence, Mo Qinglong and Mo Yuan had already struck.

A palm appeared on their necks tightly.

When the two young men realized what was happening, their eyes widened and they were filled with fear. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“You guys...”

Crack crack!

Boom!

The sounds of the necks cracking resounded. Soon after, cold demonic flames appeared on Mo Qinglong and Mo Yuan’s hands, burning the two young men.

The two men vanished immediately, leaving only some ashes behind as evidence of their existence.

“Argh! Brother!” Xiao Yu exclaimed when she saw the two men turning into ashes. Her eyes widened as she lifted her head and stared at Wang Xian.

“The path to becoming strong is filled with blood. Showing mercy to the enemies would be showing cruelty to ourselves.” Wang Xian caressed Xiao Yu’s head and spoke softly. He continued pushing the wheelchair forward and headed deeper towards the mountains.

This was just the beginning!

Xiao Yu’s expression changed and she remained silent. After ten seconds, she lifted her head, revealed a smile and commented, “I will listen to you, brother!”

Since a young age, her brother had been taking good care of her. In her heart, everything her brother did was right.

Even if it meant killing and committing arson.

“Yeah!” Wang Xian smiled and replied. He wanted to let Xiao Yu know that this world was cruel and bloody. This was to prepare her for the long journey ahead.

However, he did not require her to change her behavior. The job of an executioner could just be left to him.

Behind them, Guan Shuqing felt a little discomfort. However, she recovered quickly.

Lan Qingyue’s expression did not show any changes.

When she accepted the inheritance of the Ancient God Kun Breeder, she learnt about the cruelty of the universe.

In fact, the Ancient God race was the evil side in her opinion. All she wanted to do was just ensure she wouldn’t go against her own nature!
