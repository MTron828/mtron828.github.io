Chapter 1624: Under the Alliance of the three superpowers of 1624

“Today, in the morning dynasty of Wuji Empire, the King of Wuji Empire announced that he would go to other regions not long ago and find that the people of the vast region were suffering because of the war. He was deeply saddened that the peaceful and vast region had fallen into the flames of War!”

“The king of Wuji Empire called for Peace in the vast region and for less conflict!”

“The king of the Wuji Dynasty said in the imperial court that ever since the appearance of the Dragon and Phoenix dynasty, the people in the vast region have been living in poverty. There have been wars and killings everywhere, accusing the dragon and Phoenix dynasty of being inhumane.”

“What exactly does the Wuji dynasty mean by what happened in the imperial court, denouncing the Dragon and Phoenix dynasty publicly?”

Three days later, a piece of news spread out from the imperial city of the Wuji dynasty and spread to the entire vast region.

When everyone in the vast region heard this news, they were slightly stunned.

What did the Wuji Empire mean by this?

“It’s indeed as the Wuji Empire’s King said. Ever since the Dragon and Phoenix Empire arrived, we’ve been trembling all day. When they didn’t come, how peaceful our place was!”

“That’s right. I really hope that the dragon and Phoenix Empire will scram back to their flowing sea region so as to avoid increasing the number of killings in our vast region!”

“If the Wuji Empire helps the lone cult and the southern royal family, we can totally destroy the dragon-phoenix Empire!”

“It’s impossible for the Wuji Empire to make a move, right? Once they join the war, although they can suppress the dragon-phoenix Empire, they will still be angered, and the flames of war will spread to the Wuji Empire!”

“The dragon-phoenix Empire is just an outsider. I hope that the three superpowers can work together to drive the dragon-phoenix Empire out of the vast region or destroy it!”

“I agree. The vast area is our territory. Why should we let the dragon-phoenix Empire Harm Us?”

When this voice spread to other places, voices rang out once again.

The streets and alleys of the vast area were all talking. Gradually, more and more people were shouting for the dragon-phoenix Empire to get out of the vast area.

Even some of the cities ruled by the dragon-phoenix Empire and some warrior mercenary groups also thought so.

Ever since the Dragon and Phoenix Empire had arrived in the vast area for eight months, the entire vast area had fallen into the flames of war.

The cities ruled by the Dragon and Phoenix Empire were all ruled by force, and the People’s hearts were not united.

Public opinion suddenly erupted in the entire vast area.

“Damn, to be able to create such a huge public opinion in such a short period of time, it must be the Wuji Empire using their power!” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

In the Dragon and Phoenix Empire’s Imperial Palace, the He clan leader and he Sui clan leader were all gathered in the imperial palace.

The He clan leader took a document and handed it to Feng Luan with an embarrassed expression.

“The Wuji Empire wants to stand on the side of righteousness and then announce that they are going to attack us!”

The He Sui clan leader said with a gloomy face.

The development of an empire was different from a sect. The development of an empire required the support of the people and the support of experts.

The Wuji Empire’s action was obviously to pave the way for what they were going to do next.

“Clan leader he sui, you lead your clansmen to retreat to the land of the He clan’s holy tree!”

Feng Luan looked at the news one by one and her expression was somewhat awkward as she spoke to the He Sui clan’s clan leader.

“HMPH, the Wuji Empire is really something. War? Righteousness? Why didn’t you say it when the only sect killed nearly 100,000 innocent people? !”

The He clan leader roared with a gloomy face.

“The strong are the kings in this world. With the Wuji dynasty joining us, Let’s retreat for now. We will come back one year later!”

Feng Luan said in a deep voice.

“We finally got the situation we are in now. We are not willing to retreat like this!”

Several important ministers said.

“In the current situation, we have to retreat even if we don’t want to!”

Prime Minister Gui’s face darkened. “Emperor Feng, prepare to retreat!”

“Retreat!”

Feng Luan nodded without the slightest hesitation.

“Emperor Feng, we will also take our leave!”

The He clan and he Sui clan’s patriarch said directly with a bad expression.

“One year. You only need to endure patiently for one year!”

Feng Luan assured them.

The two bowed and left immediately.

“The Wuji Dynasty has announced that in order to ensure peace in the vast region and prevent some outsiders from destroying the vast region, they have decided to join forces with the solipsistic sect and the southern royal family to expel or even destroy the dragon and Phoenix Dynasty!”

A voice suddenly sounded in the city of the Dragon and Phoenix dynasty.

The voice covered half of the city.

“Damn it!”

“Capture the person who spoke and kill him!”

In the imperial city, some of the guards heard the sudden voice and their faces instantly darkened.

Everyone in the imperial city was also stunned.

“The Wuji Empire is going to make a move against our empire?”

“Oh my God, the three major powers in the vast region are joining forces. This... Our Empire is going to be destroyed again!”

“To be honest, the policies of the Dragon and Phoenix Empress and the way she governs the country are very good. Sigh, the most pitiful ones are still us!”

When everyone heard this news, bitterness appeared on their faces.

If the country was destroyed again, it could be said that they had changed several dynasties.

At the same time, not only here, but also in the other cities of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire, this voice sounded.

The Wuji Empire also officially announced that they were joining forces with the solipsistic sect and the southern royal family.

“Damn it, I didn’t expect them to be so fast!”

When Feng Luan and the others received the news, they all looked embarrassed.

“Let’s Go!”

The girls felt humiliated, but they couldn’t do anything about it.

“Wuwu!”

Xiao Lan flew out of the Ice Heart Lake, and everyone from the Dragon and Phoenix Empire sat on her.

The members of the Dragon Palace followed closely behind.

“Go back to the flowing sea area!”

Lan qingyue patted little blue and looked around as she said in a deep voice.

“Wuwu!”

Little blue whistled and flew directly toward the flowing sea area.

“They’ve escaped. Everyone from the dragon-phoenix Empire has escaped!”

“I didn’t expect them to escape. It seems that the Wuji Empire has made the dragon-phoenix Empire completely afraid!”

In the imperial city, everyone looked at the departing soldiers and generals of the dragon-phoenix Empire and said with a complicated expression.

“Reporting, according to the news from the dragon-phoenix Empire, everyone from the dragon-phoenix Empire is quickly escaping towards the flowing sea region!”

At this moment, in the palace of the Wuji Empire in the God Country Ruins, a middle-aged man quickly came to report.

In the middle of the palace sat six elders.

The three super powerful experts were all here.

Apart from the six strongest experts from the three superpowers, there were also the people in charge of the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop, as well as the upper echelons of the three superpowers.

“Escape? Where can they escape to? Even if they escape to the flowing sea region, we must destroy them. Haha!”

An old man from the life and Death Pill Workshop heard this news and laughed out loud with a savage face.

“Just nice, we will take back the flowing sea region’s market this time!”

A trace of a smile appeared on the face of the old man from the holy item forging workshop.

“I want to make them pay with blood that is thousands and tens of thousands of times more. I want to make the Sky Devil, even if it is in the netherworld, not be able to have peace!”

The supreme headmaster slowly closed his eyes, his cold voice penetrating people’s hearts!
