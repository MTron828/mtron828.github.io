Chapter 441: Sacred Sect: Dragon Sect (1)

“Young Lord, the two middle-aged men behind Miracle Doctor Wang possess formidable strength. One of them should have advanced to Half-Step to Dan Realm!”

“Oh, really? That Miracle Doctor Wang is really one of a kind to have such forces at such an age!”

Back at the center of the competition field, the Young Lord swept his gaze across the three bodies on the floor and beamed.

“He’s not bad, but I’m afraid it’s going to be over for him after he offended the Medical Saint Sect. Unless he goes into hiding, he’ll be doomed!”

“Not everyone could possess invincible strength like our Lord!”

The two middle-aged men were evaluating everything plainly as they remained unwavering when Wang Xian’s gang killed the three disciples of the Sacred Sect.

“You’re right. Not everyone possesses the strength of my father!”

Young Lord of Sea Serpent Island revealed a prideful look as his father was the goal in his life.

Hai Jiao, a well-known figure in the Underworld who was awe inspiring.

He possessed a reputation that was similar to that of a Sacred Sect.

Not many people knew that his father had annihilated a Saint-class force overseas. He was unrivaled and was one of the best in the entire Asian sea region.

Besides, he knew that his father had far more power than anyone could imagine!

“Which force does the girl from Miaojiang, Flower Monk, and that fair-looking young man come from?” asked the Young Lord of Sea Serpent Island as he stepped off from the carriage and looked around the field.

“If I’m not mistaken, the Flower Monk should be from Devil Spirits Temple, and that young man is from Devil Corpse Palace!”

A middle-aged man speculated with a stern look.

“Devil Spirits Temple and Devil Corpse Palace!”

The Young Lord was slightly stunned as he narrowed his pupils. “Two from the diabolism? Is the diabolism emerging?”

“No idea, but if they do, the Underworld will be in chaos again!” the middle-aged man said with a sunken expression as he recalled.

The so-called diabolism was not talking about practicing Arts of Cultivation that were of devil attributes. It was also not referring to those eccentric and unreasonable people who went around killing the innocents.

The true demons controlled corpses, turned humans into puppets, sucked the Blood Essence of others. They inflicted harm on other people just to enhance their cultivation.

This bunch of people and their practice was known by the Underworld as diabolism, as what they practiced was evil.

The diabolism was once being annihilated by Saint-class forces led by Donghua Sacred Sect and the other powerful ancestral sects.

Whereas Nie Wushuang, the Sect Leader of Donghua Sacred Sect, was known to be the number one strongest expert in the Underworld during this annihilation.

Since then, diabolism went into seclusion, and they had not made an appearance for the past fifty years.

“Devil Spirits Temple enhanced their cultivation by condensing bloodlust to extract Blood Essences from humans and other living beings. Subsequently, they will refine and feed on it. Devil Corpse Palace will refine themselves or other people into corpses. The Cultivation Arts of these two sects are extremely gruesome. Since they are here to participate in the Outstanding Young Heroes Chart, I guess diabolism is going to be active again!”

The Young Lord displayed the trace of a smile on his face. “Looks like the opponents that are in my way to attaining the role of champion of the Outstanding Young Heroes Chart will be these two fellows ”

“Given your strength of Pinnacle Inborn, coupled with a few Inborn Spiritual Weapons, so what if they are from diabolism? Still, they had to go into hiding to survive fifty years ago!”

The middle-aged man giggled as he flattered the Young Lord.

“Haha, even so, we cannot underestimate them. Let’s go.”

The Young Lord put on a confident look and strode towards the arena.

The crew from the organizer was standing at the stage; all the surrounding disciples were moving towards the stage as well.

Disciples of various ancestral sects divided themselves clearly on one side.

There were five arenas in the field, which could hold five competitions at one time.

Wang Xian, Xiao Yu, and the rest headed for the biggest arena at the center.

The remaining disciples of Sacred Sects were also going for the same arena. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“It’s going to start soon. Gosh, I just made a count secretly. There were more than a dozen supreme talents of Inborn level. More than a dozen! That’s four to five times more than in the past!”

“There’s no chance for us. But we didn’t make a wasteful trip since we can watch those outstanding supreme talents fighting among themselves!”

“Those experts below the Inborn levels are going to be awkward. They can only be ranked after the tenth!”

“The ones who came are getting more impressive!”

The young disciples sized up all the mighty supreme talents from the side as they exchanged views in whispers.

When Wang Xian and gang came to the arena, Xiao Ran and his clan members were already standing below the stage. Xiao Ran gave him a hearty smile.

“Long time no see, Miracle Doctor Wang!”

Just then, a voice that was music to the ears was heard from the side.

Wang Xian spun around and saw Tang Yinxuan. With a smile, he said, “Miss Tang, how...are...”

As he greeted her, he could feel the muscles at his waist convulsing. He drew his lips and looked towards Guan Shuqing and Lan Qingyue beside him.

“Haha, Miracle Doctor Wang is getting more and more suave!”

When Tang Yinxuan spotted Guan Shuqing and Lan Qingyue by the side, there was an inexplicable look in her eyes. Her voice turned slightly cold.

Cough!

Wang Xian gave an awkward smile and kept his silence.

Several elders beside Tang Yinxuan were puzzled as they looked at her. Then, they whispered a few words to her.

“The Outstanding Young Heroes Chart ranks you by your strength. I’m sure everyone is clear about the rules. Anyone can come to the arena. The top twenty people are able to leave their names at the cliff for people to pay tribute to. It’s life and death in the arena!”

At this time, the organizer began to speak from the arena.

It was a brief introduction, and everyone knew about it.

“Without strength that is above Half-step to Inborn, they can forget about going to the arena. It’s going to be interesting for this year’s ranking!”

A faint voice was heard. Everyone looked over and saw a middle-aged man wearing an outfit with an island on it. All of them revealed a look of awe on their faces.

Young Lord of Sea Serpent Island.

He drew his lips and swept his gaze across all the young people. With a beam, he said, “Twenty. The twenty of us shall take the seats!”

“What?”

Whatever the Young Lord of Sea Serpent Island said surprised everyone.

“Twenty? Are there twenty Inborn supreme talents here?”

“Eh, I don’t think so. Miracle Doctor Wang and his sister. Young Lord of Sea Serpent Island, Xiao Ran from Xiao Clan, Qiao Fuzi from Qiao Clan, Tang Yinxuan from Heavenly Sound Sect, Saint Qi, and Saint Wen from Dark Sect, Flower Monk and the mysterious young man in the sedan. Including the current three Inborn Experts on the chart, there are only thirteen!”

“That girl with steel rings around her neck should be an Inborn Expert. That makes it fourteen!”

“Another six more people? Gosh, Half-step to Inborn Experts are unable to make it on the Outstanding Young Heroes Chart this year!”

All of them looked around. In the past, even Level 9 Martial Artists were eligible to participate. With the numbers of Inborns around, they could not stand a chance!
