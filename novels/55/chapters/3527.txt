3528 3527 was an innate true treasure

Hong! Hong! Hong

Hua La

The moment skeleton ocean appeared, it suffered a devastating blow!

Skeleton Ocean was definitely a powerful trump card of the clan leader of the Demon Witch clan.

However, no matter how powerful your trump card was, could it fight against two or three great beings who were fighting against universe masters at level-three?

No!

His skeleton ocean could at most fight against a great being who had the combat power of a universe master at level-three.

However, facing the sky array’s attack, the sea of skeletons was in trouble!

The Sea of skeletons happened to appear!

The sky array was completed!

The nine godly dragons wreaked havoc, and countless skeletons died!

“How is this possible? You actually have a great being, an array Magus!”

Seeing this terrifying attack, the patriarch of the sorcerer Demon clan was stunned, and his face was filled with fear as he roared!

There was also an array sorcerer, and judging from his power, he was not weaker than himself at all!

Facing such a powerful enemy, his body trembled.

These enemies were each more heaven-defying than the last!

He was in his own nest, supported by all kinds of array treasures, and with the addition of powerful existences, he was confident that he could withstand four or five universe masters with level-three combat power.

However, he was completely suppressed by only four of them!

“I’m no match for them!”

Seeing this, the clan leader of the demon witch clan growled with an unsightly expression.

He moved his hand and took out a skeleton horn!

A stream of energy was injected into the horn!

“Wu Wu Wu!”

A deep and distant voice sounded in the territory of the demon witch clan. All the Great Beings and disciples in all the castles of the demon witch clan could hear it clearly!

“Someone has invaded our demon shaman clan. The horn came from the clan leader. An enemy has infiltrated the clan leader. All disciples, kill them!”

At this moment, powerful warriors of the demon Shaman clan soared into the sky from the castles one by one and flew towards the clan leader’s castle.

“Although the other party is relatively strong, all the powerful disciples of our demon shaman clan together can still resist them.”

The clan leader of the Demon Wizard clan thought with an embarrassed expression.

He did not believe that all the powerful disciples of the Demon Wizard clan could not block the other party.

As for whether the Demon Wizard clan would suffer heavy losses, this was not something he could consider!

The clan leader’s own divine kingdom was here, he could not escape!

Moreover, he could not escape either. The other party had an array magus, so they could track him.

* Hua La! *

Just as he was thinking, a figure broke through his castle and attacked him.

“Damn it, this speed is too fast!”

The leader of the Magus tribe looked over and his expression changed. He waved the staff in his hand, turning it into a death scythe that covered the surroundings.

An indiscriminate attack was meant to deal with this terrifying speed!

“Lingling, Defend!”

He let out a low growl and immediately released his defensive power.

Lingling also immediately released pieces of leaves which attached themselves to Wang Xian’s body.

Wang Xian ignored the other party’s attack and charged towards the clan leader of the demonic shaman clan.

He could sense that the clan leader of the demonic shaman clan was not very strong in terms of physical strength!

“Oh no, what the hell is that thing beside him?”

Seeing that Wang Xian was still charging at him, the clan leader of the Demonic Wizard clan had a drastic change in expression. He stared fixedly at the spirit.

Companion Elf?

What kind of enemy had they provoked? They had so many trump cards that it was simply outrageous!

“The source of the curse, the Devil’s Corpse!”

He let out a low roar and a loud roar.

At the position below, the dark corpse slowly floated up.

Without any hesitation, the leader of the Demonic Wizard clan moved and entered the demon corpse.

Slowly, the face of the leader of the Demonic Wizard clan appeared on the demon corpse.

“What is this? It actually strengthened the physical body of the leader of the Demonic Wizard clan by a lot!”

Wang Xian stared at it. He suddenly felt a power that made him fearful from the dark corpse.

However, the body of the Spellcaster clan had merged with it. The only difference was that their physical body had improved a little!

The other changes were not that great!

He was on high alert as his body flickered!

“Hula!”

He flapped his incipient saint wings and instantly arrived at the side of the Spellcaster clan’s clan leader. His Dragon Claw grabbed onto it.

“Crash!”

When the Dragon Claw landed on it, it immediately made a huge gash!

“Boundless darkness, Ghost Mark!”

The face of the leader of the Demonic Wizard clan changed drastically. His body flew to the side and stopped moving. The scythe turned into a staff and a ghost mark attacked Wang Xian.

Whoosh Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Wang Xian’s body flashed again and arrived at the other side of the leader of the Demonic Wizard clan!

Towering Dragon Horn!

He growled and a dragon horn attacked him directly.

“Bang!”

The Dragon Horn struck his body once again, causing him to spurt out blood and his body to slowly crack open.

He hurriedly used waves of energy to envelop his surroundings.

“Eh? He entered the dark corpse and his defense only increased a little. There aren’t any other changes?”

Wang Xian was slightly puzzled and had been on high alert.

“I want to see what kind of trump card you have!”

Wang Xian flapped his incipient saint wings and unleashed his speed to the maximum. Waves after waves of attacks bombarded the leader of the witchcraft clan.

Faced with Wang Xian’s speed, the leader of the witchcraft clan was unable to resist at all. He could only use his entire body’s energy to protect his body and resist continuously.

However, under the intensive attacks, the defense on his body cracked bit by bit.

Blood continued to flow out of his body.

His aura also became weaker and weaker.

At this moment, the clan leader of the demon Shaman Clan felt a little hopeless.

He had fused the cursed source of the innate supreme treasure, the demon corpse, into his body. Its effect was only to increase his defense!

It had no other use!

This demon corpse was not used in this way.

His opponent’s speed and strength made him despair.

Now, under his opponent’s speed, he couldn’t even escape!

It’s over, it’s completely over!

“Dragon Breath of Life!”

Wang Xian continued to attack the clan leader of the demon Shaman Clan. Sensing the weakening of his aura, he immediately unleashed his strongest attack.

“No!”

The clan leader of the demon Shaman Clan felt this terrifying attack and roared with complete despair on his face.

The Dragon Breath of life struck him and his body collapsed immediately.

Wang Xian had a puzzled look in his eyes.

He died so easily?

“Huh?”

However, at this moment, he saw the corpse of the clan leader of the Demon Witch clan coming out from the collapsed dark corpse.

The wounds on the dark corpse were slowly healing!

However, the clan leader of the Demon Witch clan had indeed lost his life!

This scene made Wang Xian slightly surprised!

His gaze landed on the Dark Corpse, and his eyes were sparkling.

His body condensed into a shadow and walked over to check it out.

“This is… a treasure? An innate treasure!”

Soon, he gained some confidence from the dark corpse, and his eyes were burning with excitement.
