3763 3762 was exposed

“Hehe, today I’ll let you see the gap between us. Lin Wenluo, you’re already lagging behind!”

Crestford stared at the space beast, sneered, and waved his arm!

“Whoosh!”

The four Battle Metal Angels moved. They flapped the 12 wings of the machine, and energy shot out from the position behind them, directly attacking Lin Wenluo’s metal beast!

“Sita Battle Beast, Attack!”

Lin Wenluo shouted softly. The metal horns on the Sita Battle Beast’s head began to accumulate the power of storm. A wind sword attacked the four metal battle angels at a terrifying speed!

“Too weak. With our technology, we still can’t convert the energy of the ruler level. Close combat is the best choice!”

Chris chuckled. The wings of the four metal battle angels formed a shield in front of them and attacked the Sita Battle Beast at the same speed!

“Roar Roar Roar!”

The Sita Battle Beast roared and welcomed the attack.

“Bang Bang Bang!”

In the next moment, the sound of metal colliding could be heard. The twelve wings of the metal battle angels were his weapons. Each wing was extremely sharp and contained a terrifying attack power.

Every strike had a loud sound.

Although Lin Wenluo’s battle beast was huge, it was not bloated at all. During the battle, sharp spikes could be seen from time to time!

There were even powerful cutting gears!

This was a battle between machines, a pure physical confrontation!

“This technological world is really powerful. As long as they are given enough materials, they will be able to improve qualitatively, even though it is only a physical attack.”

Wang Xian looked at the sudden outbreak of the battle and his face was filled with curiosity.

He did not make a move but just watched curiously.

The metal behemoth that Lin Wenluo had created had the combat strength of a ruler in the second stage.

As it was metal, it did not know pain. Unless it was destroyed, it would be very difficult to deal with.

Of course, this metal behemoth was perfectly countered by the Dark Clan.

The Dark clan could ignore physical attacks!

But even so, the technology world was already very powerful to be able to produce such powerful battle machines.

As for Crestleaf’s four metal battle angels, they were also comparable to masters at the second stage of the ruler realm.

With four of them attacking one, Lin Wenluo’s metal giant beast was quickly at a disadvantage!

“Lin Wenluo, you have already exceeded my expectations, but the current me is no longer the old me!”

Crestet looked at the battle in front of him and laughed loudly.

He waved his arm again, and this time, the same metal battle Angel appeared.

The Metal Battle Angel in the center was still emitting dense light power.

He was holding an angel sword in his hand!

“What?”

Lin Wenluo’s pupils slightly shrank when he saw it. He stared at the Metal Battle Angel that was emitting the power of light with a shocked face.

“No, you didn’t create a technology that can transform a ruler-level energy. That Metal Battle Angel is supported by a special treasure that is emitting energy!”

Lin Wenluo quickly said loudly.

“Don’t worry. It Won’t be long before I’m able to create a technology that can transform a ruler-level energy.”

Kleis said indifferently, pointing his arm at him. “Now, I’ll give you the final choice. Join me, or I’ll destroy your place and make it mine.”

When Lin Wenluo heard his words, his expression was abnormally ugly!

“Bang! Bang! Bang!”

“Roar! Roar!”

At this moment, at the side, there were fourteen metal battle angels and an existence whose strength was comparable to a dominator at level three. Their attacks landed on the body of the Sita battle beast, causing huge cracks to appear on its body. It was on the verge of collapse.

“Lackeys of the Angel clan!”

When Wang Xian saw this situation, his body moved and he flew forward slowly.

A cold and mocking expression was emitted from his mouth.

“HMM?”

Wang Xian’s sudden words appeared beside Lin Wenluo. It stunned Kleis Fu for a moment and his gaze immediately locked onto him.

“Your Luck isn’t good. Whose Lackey is it? It has to be from the Angel clan.”

Wang Xian looked at him and continued to speak plainly.

“Dragon Palace, Dragon King!”

Crixus looked at Wang Xian and immediately analyzed Wang Xian’s expression from the database.

“I didn’t expect it. I really didn’t expect Lin Wenluo to join the Dragon Palace. How foolish, how foolish!”

He immediately turned his gaze to Lin Wenluo and spoke with a face full of mockery and disdain!

“We’re just cooperating!”

Lin Wenluo replied with an expressionless face.

“Needless to say, all the lackeys of the Angel clan must die!”

Wang Xian said indifferently. His body moved and instantly flew toward the fourteen metal battle angels!

“D * MN Dragon King!”

Seeing Wang Xian flying toward his metal battle angels, Lie Sifu’s face changed drastically.

He naturally knew Wang Xian’s current strength and knew that he wasn’t a match for him.

“Come back quickly!”

He shouted loudly at his metal battle Angel. His eyes were slightly red.

He released all the Metal Battle Angels because he wanted to show off to Lin Wenluo.

In the end, he didn’t expect the proud and unyielding Lin Wenluo, who had always wanted to protect the glory of the technological world, to actually submit to the Dragon King.

This made him look extremely embarrassed.

“Bang! Bang!”

Fourteen Metal Battle Angels were still too slow for Wang Xian!

This was practically giving him resources.

He flew to the front of the group of Metal Battle Angels and stretched out his dragon claws to grab them.

Each metal battle Angel was only a few hundred meters in size. Under the coverage of the Dragon Claws, they were all grabbed by his hands.

He didn’t have any ability to resist at all.

“D * MN Dragon King!”

Upon seeing this scene, Kristen let out a furious roar with blood-red eyes.

He had built and accumulated over a hundred thousand years ago, and he had even used up a treasure that the angel race had given him. Yet, all of it was gone just like that?

“HMPH, you’re courting death!”

Upon hearing his roar, Wang Xian snorted coldly and flew over.

His terrifying speed caused him to have no time to react at all!

Crack! Crack

Wang Xian’s Dragon Claw grabbed onto Krstic’s mech and crushed it with force! Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

The surrounding mechs were suspended in the air without any commands!

When Lin Wenluo saw this situation, he heaved a sigh of relief. However, he still had a worried expression on his face.

“Dragon King, I’m afraid that we have been exposed. Dragon King, you have been exposed as well!”

He said to Wang Xian with a solemn expression.

In their world of technology, there was a relatively powerful and even heaven-defying point, and that was the cloning of bodies.

Every powerful scientist in the world of technology did not know that there was one clone body, or even dozens or hundreds of them.

They could share information.

To a certain extent, it was difficult for them to be wiped out even when they were stronger than the Dominators of the peak races.

To kill them, even if a Type 7 or 8 ruler attacked, the success rate would not reach 50.

This was the power of their technological world.

Crestford was not dead, and the windstorm continent would definitely be exposed.
