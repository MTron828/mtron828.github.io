Chapter 1395: 1395, I’ll be in charge

“Boom!”

A terrifying aura emanated from Duan Jinming’s body, and the terrifying aura directly covered the entire Liu clan.

Liu Shaohua, who was the first to bear the brunt of this terrifying impact, instantly turned pale. His face was filled with terror as he directly retreated backwards.

“What?”

“This is impossible. This aura isn’t the aura of an ordinary profound void stage expert!”

“This... this... second level insightful emptiness realm expert? or higher?”

“My God, Duan Jinming’s aura...”

In front of the Gilded Gold clan’s mansion, at least a few thousand people gathered to watch curiously.

When Duan Jinming unleashed all of his strength, everyone was shocked.

They looked at Duan Jinming standing in the middle with fear on their faces. That terrifying aura caused everyone’s faces to turn slightly pale.

“Third level of the profound void tier!”

At the Liu clan’s position, the Liu clan’s second master’s expression changed drastically. With a wave of his arm, a wave of energy directly blocked Duan Jinming’s incoming aura!

He stared at Duan Jinming with a face full of shock, and couldn’t help but exclaim out loud.

“What? Third level of the profound void tier? Duan Jinming is a third level of the profound void tier expert? How is this possible?”

“Third level of the profound void tier? A few days ago, wasn’t he just a punk who was nothing? How could it be now?”

The rest of the Liu clan members were all dumbfounded. They stared at Duan Jinming in disbelief.

Third level of the profound void tier, this was the third level of the profound void tier. In their Liu clan, he was also a top-notch expert.

But now, this once lowly demonic beast was actually a terrifying existence like the third level of the profound void tier.

“That’s right, it’s the third level of the profound void tier. It’s the aura of the third level of the profound void tier!”

The Gilded Gold tribe leader’s body was trembling slightly. He stared at Duan Jinming with his eyes wide open.

His strength was at the second-level profound void martial stage. He could feel the terrifying pressure coming from Duan Jinming!

This pressure made him tremble!

This kid, was he the young man who respectfully bowed and cupped his hands towards him just now?

Was he the young man who wanted to marry his daughter and respectfully came to propose marriage?

This was a f * cking third-level profound void martial stage!

A third-level profound void martial stage expert who was comparable to their gilded gold family’s patriarch!

Such an expert came to propose the marriage, and he still refused?

As for the Liu family’s eldest young master? Compared to a third-level profound void martial stage expert, he was far inferior!

“Third-level profound void martial stage, Duan Jinming’s bloodline level is absolutely very good, otherwise, he wouldn’t have directly upgraded to third-level profound void martial stage!”

“Compared to Duan Jinming, the young master of the Liu family is completely useless!”

“Lowly? There’s such a lowly expert?”

Everyone was in a daze as they thought of the mockery and disdain the Liu family had shown him.

Now, they had been slapped in the face, and it was a severe slap to the face.

Compared to Duan Jinming, Liu Shaohua was on a completely different level.

“No wonder the people of the dragon-phoenix Empire Place so much importance on the fire hammer clan and Duan Jinming!”

Some people had some understanding.

Using force to suppress others. The other party had the dragon-phoenix dynasty. In terms of individual ability, there was no way they could compare!

“Jinming!” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Gilded Gold Yan looked at Duan Jinming with admiration. He tightly held the water orb in his hand, full of excitement.

In front of gilded gold mansion, under Duan Jinming’s powerful aura, everyone fell silent.

All the people of the Liu clan stood in front of them, looking extremely embarrassed.

Liu Shaohua’s face was ashen. He never expected that lowly demonic beast to have such terrifying strength.

He originally wanted to embarrass Duan Jinming and that guy from the dragon and Phoenix dynasty, but he didn’t expect that he would be the one to be embarrassed in the end.

He even made the entire Liu clan lose face.

“Mrs. Gilded Gold, I don’t care about this matter. A few days ago, you said that you wanted your third lady to marry my son. Now, I brought my son here to propose marriage. Do you want to embarrass my Liu clan? Are you going to slap our Liu clan’s face?”

At this moment, Mrs. Liu’s stern voice suddenly sounded.

At this moment, Mrs. Liu stared at all the members of the Gilded Gold clan with a gloomy expression and asked with a cold face.

“Huh?”

All the members of the Gilded Gold clan were slightly stunned. Mrs. Gilded Gold’s expression began to change.

She had indeed said that she wanted her third daughter to marry the son of the Liu clan. At first, Mrs. Liu had said that it was fine, but it was clear that this matter did not succeed.

However, it was obvious that they had not rejected it.

Now that Madam Liu had brought up this matter, it made her look extremely embarrassed.

As long as they did not agree to the Liu family’s proposal, they would definitely anger the Liu family!

However, if they agreed...

Duan Jinming was a third level profound void martial stage expert. His daughter liked him and had given him so many gifts.

The entire gilded gold family was more inclined towards Duan Jinming.

“Gilded Gold family, you guys should make a normal choice. If the Liu family dares to go against you, we will take action against them!”

Wang Xian saw Madam Liu’s threat and spoke out sarcastically.

“Dragon and Phoenix Empire, this is Xiaoyao City, not your empire. Do you really think that you can go against anyone you want? Don’t look down on Xiaoyao City!”

Yao Dingfeng, who was standing at the side, said coldly when he saw Wang Xian’s arrogant look.

“Eh, Young Master Yao, what’s Going On?”

At this moment, some curious voices came from behind.

Yao Dingfeng was slightly taken aback. He looked over and the people around him also looked over.

More than 30 young men and women with extraordinary statuses walked over curiously.

“What’s wrong? We wanted to congratulate young master Liu on marrying a beautiful woman. What’s going on now? The young master city has followed us here!”

A young man looked at the scene curiously and asked.

“Young master Li, Young Master Yang, you guys are just in time. An arrogant guy said arrogantly that he wants to deal with the Liu clan!”

Yao Dingfeng’s eyes were sparkling. He walked over and whispered the matter to them.

“What?”

The group of young men was slightly shocked. Their eyes swept across Duan Jinming and finally landed on Wang Xian.

“An outsider has no right to interfere in the affairs of our Xiaoyao City!”

The young man named Li Shao said coldly.

“He said that he wanted to destroy a family in Xiaoyao city, but he wanted to destroy a family. Does he really think that he is invincible?”

Another young man at the side stared at Wang Xian mockingly.

“He is the young master of the other top families in Xiaoyao City!”

“The young master of the Li family in the ferocious beasts region and the young master of the Yang family in the grocery region!”

“Xiaoyao city was established by the mayor of Xiaoyao City. Theoretically speaking, all the families in Xiaoyao City are under the mayor of Xiaoyao City. That guy from the Dragon and Phoenix Empire is a little too arrogant when he said he wanted to destroy the Liu Family!”

Some people whispered to each other when they saw the group of young men walking over.

“I will naturally not interfere in matters that have nothing to do with me. However, if it has something to do with me, I will naturally interfere!”

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly and said faintly.

“Hehe, interfere? That depends on whether you have the ability to do so. Would the families in Xiaoyao City Be Afraid of Your Dragon and Phoenix Empire?”

“This is not a place where your dragon and Phoenix Empire can be impudent!”

Yao Dingfeng, Liu Shaohua, and the young men from Xiaoyao city stared at Wang Xian and said coldly.
