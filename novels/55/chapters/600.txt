Chapter 601: Assassination In The Late Night (2)

Sword Cloud!

Extremely daunting Sword Cloud!

In the void, the old men stared at the place below them with icy-cold eyes while daunting water energy surged around them.

Those middle-aged men and old men who cultivated Inferno and Metal Energy did not strike. All they did was watch by the side, doing nothing.

As a total of eight Sword Clouds were formed, each one of them was hundreds of meters in size.

Eight Budding Realm experts played the Sword Clouds at the same time.

Including those Budding Realm experts who did not strike, they had about fifteen people in total.

With so many supreme-class experts killing a master who was unparalleled in refining elixir pills and equipment, it was a piece of cake despite the other party also being a Budding Realm expert.

“Kill!”

Eight elders let out a cold bellow in the sky. Within the Sword Clouds, longswords sprouted out all of a sudden.

The longswords gave out a chilly aura in the rain. Instantly, thousands of razor-sharp swords darted out towards the shop below for a kill.

“Hur? Oh no!”

At this time, Wang Xian, who was refining equipment in the room, had a drastic change in his expression. With an arm swing, he put all the surrounding materials into his space ring.

“What a daunting killing aura!”

His expression was altered slightly. With a thought, a shield appeared in his hand.

On the shield was water current flowing at a rapid speed. At the same time, another longsword showed up in Wang Xian’s hand.

“Sword Alps!”

He waved his arm and set up walls of Sword Alps around him.

At the same time, Wang Xian raised the shield in his hand.

Om!

The shield in his hand ballooned, wrapping him completely with water energy.

Boom!

At this time, Wang Xian sensed a round of terrifying attacks charging in his direction. It came from all sides and he had nowhere to hide.

“Who dares to strike in Yong Chang City?”

Wang Xian was slightly aghast as he fixed his eyes on the sky with a stern look.

Whoosh!

At this time, the entire rooftop was torn apart as frightful water swords were darting at him.

The dense water swords came one after another, as though they were endless.

Wang Xian saw the Sword Clouds that contained domineering energy in the sky were releasing the water swords.

“There’s more than one!”

Cold radiance was found in Wang Xian’s eyes as the water energy around him intensified.

Below that stream of water energy, a layer of mustard energy was also encircling it.

Boom boom!

Destructive attacks kept raining down on Wang Xian.

The incessant water swords lasted for ten seconds.

The entire shop was completely gone under such a daunting rain of swords while a pit that was a dozen meters deep appeared in the ground.

“Alright, we’ll need to restore this place before dawn!”

An elder withdrew his Sword Cloud and spoke impassively while taking a brief glance below.

“This stupid fellow is a total waste of our time!” another elder commented coldly at the side.

Master Xuanhuo and Master Qingming revealed a smile. “Going against all the elixir pills shops and blacksmith shops in Yong Chang City will never come to a good ending!”

The crowd looked down and they were almost certain that this wicked master who was unparalleled in refining elixir pills and equipment had totally vanished from Yong Chang!

They exchanged glances with one another, ready to settle the remaining matters.

“Let’s go!” an elder said without any emotions as though killing a person here was nothing but a trivial matter to him.

“I’ll get my men to withdraw the array!”

Another old man’s voice was heard.

Bo!

However, at this time, the rain in the sky was getting heavier.

But the strange thing was, not only did the rain not fall on the ground, but it was gathering in the sky.

It was as though the rain was controlled by some dominating force in the surroundings.

“Hur? “What’s going on?”

The fifteen Budding Realm experts sensed the eerie change of the surroundings and revealed a look of surprise.

“He’s not dead!”

An old man sensed something moving below as a golden radiance shot out from his eyes.

Phew!

Wang Xian let out a deep breath while the Level 11 shield in his hands was full of cracks.

The attacks from eight Budding Realm experts had almost injured him.

“Who are you people? Why did you try to kill me?”

Wang Xian swept his gaze across everyone and eventually stopped on Xuanhuo and Qingming. Seeing them made him realize what was going on.

“Hur? He looks familiar?!”

When Master Xuanhuo and Master Qingming saw Wang Xian, they found him to be very familiar.

“Isn’t he...he...”

Master Qingming suddenly had a flash of memory. He recalled the young man who once showed up in his Saint Forge Workshop, applying to be an alchemist in their shop.

“How is this possible?”

The two of them exchanged eye contact as they found disbelief in each other’s eyes.

The lad, which they had rejected back then, was actually an alchemy master unparalleled in refining elixir pills and equipment!

This is a fu*king joke!

“Oh? You’re not dead? It looks like we have to go for one more round!”

The surrounding experts ignored Wang Xian’s questions as they raised their eyebrows and spoke without any emotions.

Fifteen Budding Realm experts against one was simply overkill!

“Since you guys refused to tell me, then go to hell!”

Wang Xian revealed frantic murderous intent in his eyes. This was the first time in Yong Chang world that he felt such rage.

“Haha!”

Upon hearing his words, the group of fifteen people grinned disdainfully.

Bobo!

Yet, they were surprised to find out that the rainwater gathered in the center had ballooned to ten meters in size at this instant.

Subsequently, the ten-meter water space spread out, enveloping a radius of five kilometers at a rapid speed.

The fifteen of them were horrified as they quickly propped up space within the water region.

“What kind of battle technique is this?” asked an expert from Yong Chang Immortal Sect coldly as he studied the surrounding water region with vigilance.

“Not sure, it doesn’t seem to have any offensive power!”

Bewilderment flashed in the eyes of an expert of Da Hong Immortal Sect.

“Forget about it! Let’s kill that brat first!”

An old man released golden radiance as he moved. The long sword in his hand immediately wielded a golden beam that struck at Wang Xian with domineering speed.

“Great Waterfall Water Shockwave!”

Wang Xian stood in the water region, depleting his water energy within his body at a frantic rate to connect with the entire water region.

Boom!

He sensed that the entire water region was almost like his own world.

He could easily control this world.

“Is this the power of an Immortal’s battle techniques?”

Radiance flashed in Wang Xian’s eyes. Seeing the longsword that was darting towards him, he swung his arm.

For a moment, destruction happened within the entire water region as though it was the end of the world.

The rainwater swept toward the longsword and that old man. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

It was as if the entire water region was erupting with the wrath of God.

The charging speed of the Water Shockwave was unusually fast, such that the longsword was scattered around like a lifeless log.

The daunting Water Shockwave continued charging at that old man.

“What?”

For a moment, the old man was horrified as he could sense the entire world collapsing. All the energy of the world was rushing towards him!
