Chapter 1219: 1,220 dragon and Phoenix grocery store

Translator: 5496903

“70% ? Only 70% of the market price?”

Wang Xian entered the holy item forging workshop and asked the staff inside with a frown.

“Of course! You still want to recycle at the market price? How is that possible?”

The staff replied to him with a slight sneer.

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and walked straight out. He walked on the bustling road and looked around.

Wang Xian would naturally not sell all kinds of weapons and armors to them at 70% of the market price.

He had so many weapons in his hands. It was a complete loss to sell them to the holy item forging workshop.

“Let’s see if there’s an auction house. If It’s an auction house, it would be a quick way!”

Wang Xian looked around. After walking for a short while, he saw an extremely glorious auction house, the Blood Emperor auction house.

“This blood emperor auction house seems to be set up by the blood flow empire!”

Wang Xian walked over immediately.

However, what made him feel helpless was that the blood emperor auction house was held once a month. It was only held for two days this month.

If he wanted to auction items, he would have to wait until the following month.

“No, no, one month is too long!”

Wang Xian shook his head and continued to look around.

There were all kinds of shops. They were densely packed with elixirs, weapons, pets, mounts, formations, spiritual meat...

There were thousands of different shops in the central area.

There were big ones and small ones. I took a look at two more auction houses but the scale of the auction house was too small.

Wang Xian had too many things. He didn’t dare to entrust such a small auction house to conduct an auction.

This made him frown.

Hold an auction on my own? Get Long Xiaotian over to oversee the auction to prevent people from directly snatching it

He pondered in his heart, but he quickly ruled it out. There were too many things involved. Publicity was one aspect. Moreover, if an auction was to be held, there had to be a strong person overseeing it.

Long Xiaotian was in the assessment period. During this period, the power of the Light Dragon dynasty was forbidden to be used.

With only the title of a prince, it was obvious that he could not suppress the other factions.

Another important point was that if he were to get close to long Xiaotian, he reckoned that the other factions would not need to do anything. The other princes of the Light Dragon Empire would come to rob this auction.

Creak

The sound of the door closing came from the side. An old man walked out and pasted a note on the door. He shook his head and left.

Wang Xian took a glance and stopped. He looked deep in thought.

“Open my own shop?”

His eyes flickered. He still had a lot of metal materials that he needed to refine into weapons.

Those materials would take at least five to six days to be refined.

“Why don’t I Open my own shop and Get Long Xiaotian to help recruit people to advertise it? I can refine weapons on my own and sell things normally!”

“If my reputation starts to spread, the items in the shop should be sold out very quickly!”

Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled as he pondered for a while. This method was really feasible.

Since he could sell it at a high price, it wouldn’t take long for him to refine weapons and armor in the shop!

He made a decision in his heart and began to search for a suitable shop in the entire area.

The location of the shop was not bad, but the shop was too small.

Wang Xian’s shop was a grocery store. There were all kinds of miscellaneous items and even demonic beasts and ferocious beasts for sale.

Naturally, he had to find a bigger shop.

After searching for a while, Wang Xian identified a shop that was on sale. It was big enough and had three floors. It used to be a weapons shop, but now it was closed.

Wang Xian immediately contacted the owner and bought it for 50 million middle-grade spirit stones.

50 million middle-grade spirit stones was definitely a very high price. However, this was the tomb of a demi-human.

If one wanted to open a shop in the tomb of a demi-human and owned a shop, the price would naturally be hundreds of times higher than the price outside.

After buying it, Wang Xian immediately flew towards his residence. He needed to make some preparations.

He was going to contact long Xiaotian and bring some people to patronize the shop. He was going to set up the shop.

“Bang!”

When Wang Xian pushed open the door of the courtyard, he looked into the courtyard in slight astonishment.

“Roar! Roar!”

In the courtyard, Xiao Ha was standing on the body of a level nine Seethrough blood-traced turtle. He was chirping with the Five Little Yan monkeys.

At the side, Ling Zilin and the blood evil turtle were lying on the ground. They did not pay any attention to Xiao Ha.

When it saw Wang Xian enter, it shrunk its head and threw something at him.

“This is?”

Wang Xian was stunned when he saw the blood-red item that contained energy being thrown at him.

Blood Essence: 700 dragon crystals can be extracted from Dragon Energy

“Blood essence, is this the blood essence?”

Wang Xian immediately took it and examined it carefully.

Blood essence was similar to the spiritual liquid. It was two items that were produced in the human-demon graveyard.

The spiritual liquid was very useful to humans. Blood essence was very useful to demonic beasts and people with bloodlines.

“No wonder the spirit purple kylin blood evil turtle didn’t chase it out. It turned out that it bribed the treasure and even got along with a few demonic beasts!”

Wang Xian revealed a smile and kept the blood essence.

He looked at Xiao Ha and his body trembled slightly. A wave of kindness was transmitted directly into Xiao Ha’s mind.

Xiao Ha was slightly stunned. He looked at Wang Xian slowly with a gaze filled with friendliness.

“That Ling Jian ‘er is really careless. She let a cub with the bloodline of a second level void interpretation stage demon beast go so easily. If I have any thoughts, I can subdue it directly!”

Wang Xian thought to himself.

“Roar! Roar!”

At this moment, Xiao Ha flew towards Wang Xian and stood on his shoulder intimately.

Wang Xian stroked its head and sat on the chair beside it. He poured himself a cup of tea and sent a message to Long Xiaotian. He gave a brief explanation and asked him to help promote his shop when it opened.

After sending the message, Wang Xian took out a piece of metal material and prepared to make a signboard.

The signboard didn’t need to be too good, but it couldn’t be too bad either.

It was made of metal material of extraordinary level eight.

“Let’s call the shop dragon and Phoenix grocery store. The items sold are pretty miscellaneous anyway!”

Wang Xian thought to himself as he carved the words “Dragon and Phoenix grocery store”on the metal material. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Xiao Ha, Xiao Ha, come back!”

Not long after, Ling Jian ‘ER’s cold voice came from outside the courtyard.

“Roar! Roar!”

Xiao Ha lay on its shoulder and roared towards the direction outside.

“Huh? Xiao Ha, come over!”

Ling Jian ‘ER’s figure was suspended in the air. She looked at Xiao Ha, who was lying beside Wang Xian, with a surprised expression.

Wasn’t Xiao Ha a little afraid of him? Why did he look so intimate now?

Why didn’t he come over even if she called him?

In the past, she would have come over as long as she called Xiao Ha softly.

“Awoo!”

Xiao Ha looked at Wang Xian with a face full of reluctance and rubbed his head against him.
