The Demonic Beast Cub on Ling Jian ‘ER’s shoulder roared at heavenly sword star, making him even more embarrassed.

“Roar!”

However, to everyone’s surprise, the Purgatory Mastiff beside Heavenly Sword Star let out a furious roar when it saw Xiao Ha roaring at its master.

A two-meter-tall black flame rose from its body, and its blood-red eyes stared at Xiao Ha as if it was ready to pounce at any moment.

“Roar Roar, looking for a fight, looking for a fight!”

Xiao Ha, who was lying on Ling Jian ‘ER’s body, was also enraged when it saw the ferocious purgatory mastiff. It let out a roar and spoke in a tender human language.

Following that, Xiao Ha’s figure instantly attacked the purgatory mastiff.

Even though Xiao Ha didn’t look like it was even half a meter, its speed was extremely terrifying. Its four limbs turned golden, and its sharp claws directly drilled out.

The Demonic Beast Cub on Ling Jian ‘ER’s shoulder also had the bloodline of the second rank of the profound void tier, and its current strength had already reached the peak of the ninth rank.

No matter how small a demonic beast cub was, it still had the aura of a king. If a beast of the same level provoked it, it naturally wouldn’t cower.

Little Ha was like a sharp sword as it directly attacked the Purgatory Mastiff.

The purgatory Mastiff opened its bloody mouth and instantly bit towards little ha.

However, at this moment, little ha, who was flying in the air, waved his claws and a golden sharp sword directly attacked the Purgatory Mastiff’s mouth.

The sudden attack of the two pets caused everyone in the surroundings to be slightly stunned.

Even Ling Jian ‘er and heavenly sword star had not expected this.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

Xiao Ha’s attack landed on the Purgatory Mastiff’s mouth, causing it to let out a painful cry. Its eyes turned even redder.

“Xiao Ha, Stop!”

Ling Jian ‘er immediately shouted at Xiao Ha.

“Roar Roar!”

Xiao Ha revealed a smug look on its face. Its body flew to her shoulder and it stuck out its tongue to lick her face.

“Purgatory, Stop!”

Heavenly Sword Star also hurriedly shouted at the purgatory mastiff.

However, the ferocious purgatory mastiff was now injured in its mouth, making it even more violent. It opened its huge mouth, wanting to continue attacking Xiao Ha.

Heavenly Sword Star’s expression changed slightly, and his aura trembled. The longsword in his hand pressed down on the top of its head.

“Roar Roar!”

The purgatory Mastiff was controlled by Heavenly Sword Star, and it continued to roar in a low voice.

Ling Jian ‘ER glanced at the purgatory mastiff and walked straight ahead.

Heavenly Sword Star glared at the Purgatory Mastiff and hurriedly chased after it.

“Roar!”

However, Heavenly Sword Star had just walked a dozen meters behind it. When he retracted his hand from the Purgatory Mastiff, the Purgatory Mastiff saw little ha glaring at him fiercely and suddenly went berserk, letting out a furious roar.

“Purgatory, behave yourself!”

Heavenly Sword Star turned around somewhat impatiently and let out an angry roar at the Purgatory Mastiff.

“Damn, this purgatory mastiff is so violent and Savage!”

“The Purgatory Mastiff has always been a very violent and savage beast. Heavenly Sword star has clearly not tamed it completely!”

“It’s Too Savage!”

The surrounding people saw that the Purgatory Mastiff had lost control once again. Black Flames curled around its body and it emitted a terrifying murderous aura. Some of the surrounding people could not help but take two steps back.

“Roar!”

However, just as they were discussing in hushed voices, after Heavenly Sword Star’s furious roar, the Purgatory Mastiff suddenly went berserk and charged forward.

“Be careful!”

The expressions of the youths in front changed drastically as they hurriedly dodged to the side.

“Purgatory, stop right there!”

When Heavenly Sword Star saw that Purgatory had gone berserk, a look of fury appeared on his face. He originally wanted to show off his mount in front of Ling Jian ‘er today.

However, he didn’t expect that he would go crazy and lose control. This made him extremely embarrassed.

He let out an angry roar. The Crazy Purgatory Mastiff ignored him completely and bit at the few young men in front of it.

However, the few young men moved their bodies and flew into the sky to dodge far away. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Roar!”

Its blood-red eyes charged forward once again. When it saw that the figure in front of it didn’t Dodge, it charged forward ferociously.

“Am I that unlucky?”

Wang Xian, who was walking towards the sword mansion, felt the attack coming from behind him. His eyes turned cold.

He turned around and waved his arm. A stream of water shot towards the Purgatory Mastiff.

“Bang!”

The purgatory mastiff, which had just pounced over, was hit in the head by the powerful water. It crashed heavily into the ground with a loud sound.

“Stop it, you damned fellow. How dare you attack my Mount!”

Seeing his pet being sent flying, Heavenly Sword Star spat out a mouthful of blood. His expression changed drastically as he shouted sternly.

He moved and came to the side of the Purgatory Mastiff. He took a glance at his pet and stared at Wang Xian coldly.

“Mind your own Mount!”

Wang Xian looked at Heavenly Sword Star and narrowed his eyes slightly.

“I will mind my own pet. However, you dare to attack him. Kid, I think you are courting death!”

The Longsword in Heavenly Sword Star’s hand moved and emitted a green glow.

“Hehe, it was your pet that attacked me first. Don’t tell me you don’t allow me to retaliate!”

Wang Xian smiled and asked indifferently.

“No!”

Heavenly Sword Star said tyrannically.

“Heavenly sword star is really overbearing. It was clearly this purgatory mastiff that attacked First!”

“He has the right to be overbearing. After all, he is the 15th Heaven’s favorite!”

“Strength is king. The weak are the original sin!”

When the surrounding people saw this scene and heard Heavenly Sword Star’s words, their faces didn’t change at all.

In the purgatory field of the graveyard of demi-humans, the strong were the king. The weak had no right to speak at all.

They had often seen people killing in public and snatching other people’s treasures. Although heavenly sword star’s actions were extremely overbearing, he had the right to do so.

“Roar!”

At this moment, just as Heavenly Sword Star finished speaking, the purgatory mastiff beside him shook its head and once again pounced towards Wang Xian violently.

Heavenly sword star frowned slightly. He didn’t say anything to stop it and stared at Wang Xian coldly.

Wang Xian looked at the overbearing heavenly sword star. When he saw the purgatory mastiff pouncing towards him again, the killing intent in his heart was completely released.

He moved his palm slightly and the terrifying energy in his hand condensed.

He stared at the attack that was coming towards him and waved his arm.

“He still dares to attack?”

“He is disrespecting heavenly sword star. This kid is going to be in trouble!”

When everyone around saw Wang Xian making a move, they were astonished and whispered.

“Huh?”

Ling Jian ‘er, who was standing at the side, frowned slightly when she saw Wang Xian.

“He still dares to attack?”

Heavenly Sword Star’s eyes were ice-cold. The longsword in his hand was condensed with gusts of wind radiance.

Boom

However, at this moment, the sound of an explosion was suddenly heard.

The purgatory mastiff that was pouncing at Wang Xian didn’t fly backward this time. Instead, it was completely turned into minced meat in the explosion of metal and wood.

Small pieces and small pieces. The largest piece was only the size of a fist.

“What?”

When the surrounding people saw this scene, they were completely stunned.

“You actually dared to kill my mount. I Am the Heaven’s favorite, Tian Jian Xing. Today, I will definitely tear you into pieces!”

Heaven’s sword star roared furiously when he saw the purgatory mastiff that his father had spent a lot of effort to get for him was directly blasted into pieces.
