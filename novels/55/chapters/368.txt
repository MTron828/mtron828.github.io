Chapter 369: Blue Whale

After the massive and powerful race siege against Wang Xian, the terrifying oppression and the aftermath of the battle had risen to the sea surface.

Lan Qingyue and Guan Shuqing, who were in deep sleep, were awakened immediately.

They called out to Wang Xian, but they never found him. Out of panic, they got Sun Lingxiu, and Mo Qinglong, who heard their commotions, walked out.

Mo Qinglong and Sun Lingxiu knew what Wang Xian was doing under the sea. As the terrifying impetus, oppression, and roarings came from the sea, they were all aghast.

However, they sensed that Wang Xian was safe.

After a long time, Guan Shuqing and Lan Qingyue could not stand still. The screams and bellows coming from the deep abyss of the sea were too horrifying.

The two girls were wearing anxiety all over their faces. As time passed, they were overwhelmed with panic!

Even Sun Lingxiu at the side could not remain calm. She looked towards the bottom of the sea with trepidation, ignoring the pouring rain from the sky.

Rumble!

At this time, a bolt of lightning flashed across the sky, bringing a glimmer of light to the darkness in the ocean. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Boom boom!

“That is...?”

At this time, a horrifying shadow showed up before the four of them. The gigantic shadow was more than 30 meters long.

It was domineering.

“It’s an ocean monster. Xiao Xian must be in danger now!”

Upon seeing the appalling figure diving into the sea, Guan Shuqing exclaimed in anxiety and fear. Tears rolled down her cheek immediately.

“Don’t worry, that’s only a blue whale. It may look huge, but an Inborn Expert can just kill it!” Mo Qinglong explained from the side.

“No way, I want to have a look. I must enter the sea!”

“Me too!”

As Guan Shuqing and Lan Qingyue spoke, they looked at the pitch-black sea with consternation, striding slowly towards it.

“I’ll go with you girls!” said Sun Lingxiu to them. This time, Sun Lingxiu did not halt them.

Mo Qinglong was frowning at the side as he knew he could not stop them either.

“Come with me!”

Mo Qinglong made a swift move and jumped into the sea directly.

Without the slightest hesitation, the girls followed suit and leaped into the sea.

Sensing the whereabouts of Wang Xian, Mo Qinglong swam rapidly towards him.

The ocean was rather deep, and this was the first time these three girls had entered such an appalling ocean. But fear had not taken over them as they only felt worry for someone else.

As they dived rapidly to the bottom of the sea, the slightly weaker Lan Qingyue and Guan Shuqing almost could not cope when they were a thousand meters below the sea.

Sun Lingxiu, on their side, waved her hand, wrapping them with her Light Energy.

For one who was practicing Light Divine Dragon Transformation like Sun Lingxiu, the ocean was no different from land.

Gulp!

Just then, they saw that gigantic blue whale and swam deeper to the bottom of the sea.

“There’s light over there!”

After diving another two to three hundred meters deeper, the group of them stared with their wide-open eyes. They were shocked by what they saw at the bottom of the sea.

“That’s a Dragon Palace!”

Excitement flashed in Mo Qinglong’s eyes as he fervently looked below. That was his sacred ground.

“Dragon Palace!”

Both Lan Qingyue and Guan Shuqing were surprised as they turned to look at Mo Qinglong.

“Xiao Xian obtained a Divine Dragon heritance. This is the Dragon Palace that he built underwater. He brought us here to let us visit the Dragon Palace!”

With a pair of glistening eyes, Sun Lingxiu stared at the Dragon Palace below as she explained slowly to Lan Qingyue and Guan Shuqing.

Lastly, she added, “Xiao Xian wanted to give you two a surprise!”

Both Lan Qingyue and Guan Shuqing were overwhelmed as they stared dumbfoundedly at the miraculous Dragon Palace in the sea.

The entire Dragon Palace was extravagant, spectacular, and towering, so much so that no other buildings in the world could compare to it.

It was bright within the Palace with all kinds of glowing corals.

There were huge mountains with columns, giving off a golden radiance.

All these struck a deep impression on them.

They swam downwards above the Dragon Array, but they ended up knocking themselves against it.

They were taken by surprise as they touched the array.

Ssss!

At this time, a venomous sea snake sensed something and looked over at Mo Qinglong and Sun Lingxiu. The snake felt a similar aura from them.

“Is the Dragon King around?” Mo Qinglong asked that venomous sea snake directly.

Since they shared the same Divine Dragon bloodline, communication was not a problem.

Ssss!

That venomous sea snake rolled its tongue and reported to the Dragon King Hall after some hesitation.

“That is...? What was that?”

Guan Shuqing stared at the horrifying-looking venomous sea snake and asked this while gaping.

Whatever had unfolded before her was too shocking for her to speak.

“One of the members of the Dragon Palace!” Mo Qinglong answered.

“Dragon King, there are two humans with Divine Dragon bloodline outside.”

When Wang Xian was sleeping soundly, the voice of a venomous sea snake came through the Royal Residence Hall.

He patted his muzzy head. “Two humans?”

“Dragon King, it’s four humans,” the venomous sea snake replied.

“Four?”

Wang Xian froze for a moment, but he quickly thought of Lan Qingyue and Guan Shuqing. In a swift movement, he darted out.

Wang Xian saw the gang as soon as he walked out of his bedroom.

Making a rapid move, Wang Xian swam towards them.

He peered at the Southern Gate and Northern Gate and spotted eight venomous sea snakes crouching not far away from him. They were staring coldly at the two races.

The two race leaders seemed to be having a conversation with them.

Wang Xian did not have the energy to care about it. He showed up before the girls after walking out of the Western Gate.

“Xiao Xian. you frightened us!”

When the two girls saw him coming over, their eyes were red as tears could not stop flowing down their cheeks. They immediately sprang on him.

Cough, cough!

“I’m fine!”

Wang Xian felt pain all over his body with the knock as he quickly assured them.

“Xiao Xian, are you all right?”

Upon hearing his severe cough, Guan Shuqing and Lan Qingyue were worried as they looked at him.

“I’m fine. I sustained minor injuries just now. I’ll be all right after a recuperation!”

Wang Xian shook his head.

“Hur?”

Sun Lingxiu quickly paced to Wang Xian, and a beam of light entered his body.

“You call these minor injuries?” Sun Lingxiu had a change in her look as beams of Light Energy were cast into Wang Xian’s body.

“It’s nothing. I’ll recover after a month of rest!”

Wang Xian shook his head and threw them an assuring smile. “I wanted to give you two a surprise. Little did I expect some other circumstances to occur. Sorry to make you worry. I’ll show you around my Dragon Palace!”

Wang Xian spoke with a smile as he held the hands of the two girls.

“Xiao Xian, are you really all right?” the two girls asked with concern again.

“Yes, look at me. I can fly, I can jump. Do I look like something is wrong with me?”

Wang Xian beamed to them and pulled them towards the Dragon Palace.
