Chapter 1297: Under the domineering aura of 1298 Zhang Feng

“Eh? What’s going on?”

At the entrance of the Heavenly Sword Sect’s Back Mountain, Tang Ling ‘er stood beside a group of people. She looked at the bewitching Fox and asked with a slight frown.

Logically speaking, with her strength and background, it was absolutely impossible for her to stand at the side.

But today, among this group of people, she really had to stand at the side.

In the center was a slightly chubby young man. The young man had a smile on his face, and he looked very kind.

Beside the young man were Tang Feng and Tang Yuan, her two older brothers.

Beside her two older brothers were the slightly chubby middle-aged man’s assistants.

She was beside these people. Other than them, there were seven or eight other middle-aged young men. Two of them were on the prodigy roll, and there were a few other young men.

There were a few others who were already in their fifties or sixties, but they looked no different from youths.

They were all experts who had been on the prodigy roll in the past. Their current strength was even stronger than some of the geniuses on the Prodigy roll.

Each and every one of them was an extremely famous character.

Other than these geniuses and the former geniuses, there were also a few core disciples from the top-tier powers in the bloodshed empire.

These top core disciples of the blood flow empire had strong backgrounds. Two of them were only slightly weaker than the Light Dragon Empire’s Divine Wind Academy and the Boundless Sea Empire.

“This...”

The woman who was supporting the fox-like woman looked at the fox-like woman.

“Leader!”

When she saw Tang Ling ‘er, she slightly pursed her lips and her eyes flickered.

“Brother, you and manager Qian can go in!”

Tang Ling ‘er said to Tang Feng and the others, and looked at Hu mei, “Tell me, what’s the matter?”

Hu Mei hesitated for a moment, and stammered out everything that had happened just now.

“What? There’s really someone who dares to treat you like this. Let’s go, I want to see what ability the other party has! Someone who dares to bully my people!”

When Tang Ling ‘er heard Hu Mei’s staccato words, her expression was ice-cold.

“Regiment commander, no... There’s no need!”

Hu Mei hurriedly walked over, her face slightly embarrassed.

“Don’t worry, as long as I’m here in the flowing sea region, no one can do anything to you! No one dares to do anything to your clan!”

Tang Ling ‘ER’s face was full of arrogance as she said, “Follow Me!”

As she said that, she directly walked inside.

Hu Mei bit her lips, her eyes were filled with worry and hatred. Seeing that Tang Ling ‘er had already walked over, she didn’t dare to disobey and followed closely behind.

The woman who was supporting her just now frowned slightly. She hesitated for a moment and did not join in. Instead, she walked to the side.

In the back of the mountain, the people around had not dispersed.

In fact, less than two minutes had passed.

When everyone saw manager Qian and the Prince of blood flow empire arriving, some of them quickly walked over to greet them.

“Who’s Wang Xian? Come out!”

A cold voice was heard and once again attracted the attention of everyone around.

When Tang Feng, Tang Yuan, and the rest heard their sister’s voice, they looked over in puzzlement.

“Huh?”

Everyone around also quickly looked over. When they saw Tang Ling ‘er bringing Foxy over, everyone was slightly shocked.

“It’s Princess Tang Ling ‘Er. What is she trying to do?”

“Foxy is a member of her cherry blossom mercenary group. Tang Ling ‘er might want to stand up for her!”

“That Wang Xian is going to be in trouble now. Tang Ling ‘ER is very strong and has a very strong personality!”

When the people in the surroundings saw Tang Ling ‘er bringing Foxy back, a hint of surprise appeared in their eyes!

Many of them were gloating over Tang Ling ‘ER’s misfortune. With Tang Ling ‘er coming forward to seek justice for Foxy, even long Xiaotian was a little afraid.

“Huh? Is this an unexpected surprise?”

Long Xiaochen and the other princes, who already had bad expressions, saw Tang Ling ‘ER’s appearance, and their eyes sparkled.

“This is also the reason why I asked the Foxy woman to go!”

A cold look flashed in the eyes of the forty-second Prince at the side.

This made long Xiaochen and the other princes wary. This forty-second brother was not simple.

Jiang Chuan, who was standing at the side and his expression kept changing, raised his eyebrows slightly when he saw this scene.

However, even when he saw Tang Ling ‘er appearing, his expression still didn’t look good.

It was because Zhang Fengying’s behavior just now made him very uncomfortable.

Upon hearing Tang Ling ‘er’s voice, Wang Xian frowned slightly. He looked over. She naturally knew this Tang Ling ‘er.

The Princess of the blood flow empire.

Long Xiaotian looked over and his expression didn’t look too good.

Zhang Fengying stood quietly beside Wang Xian and looked at Tang Ling ‘er coldly.

“If you don’t know the specific reason, don’t get involved!”

Wang Xian didn’t give her any face just because she was the princess of the blood flow empire. He said coldly.

“Oh? You Are Wang Xian, right? Are you very arrogant?”

Tang Ling ‘er followed the voice and looked at Wang Xian. “Foxy is a member of my mercenary group. You bullied her and even dared to threaten her. Are you looking down on me?”

“Now, you’d better apologize to Foxy three times respectfully. Otherwise... Don’t blame me for being rude!”

Tang Ling ‘er stared at Wang Xian aggressively and spoke to him in a commanding tone.

“Princess Tang Ling ‘er, you have yet to understand the exact reason behind this matter. Can you deal with it after you’ve investigated it thoroughly?”

Long Xiaotian squeezed out a smile and said with a smile.

“Shut up. I’m asking you, do you want to apologize?”

Tang Ling ‘er spoke to long Xiaotian coldly without giving him any face.

This made long Xiaotian’s expression extremely awkward.

“So what if you don’t apologize? So what if you’re not polite?”

Zhang Fengying looked at Tang Ling ‘er and coldly asked directly.

Tang Ling ‘er was slightly stunned when she heard Zhang Fengying’s words. She did not expect that someone would actually dare to speak to her like this.

Moreover, he was so unyielding!

Her gaze looked at Zhang Fengying. When she looked at her appearance and figure, her eyes flickered, and a faint trace of jealousy welled up in her heart.

“If you don’t apologize, the consequences will not be something you can bear!”

Tang Ling ‘ER’s gaze was ice-cold as she glared at Zhang Fengying.

“HMPH, then we really want to see if we can bear it!”

Zhang Fengying stood there and spoke with a domineering expression.

“You’re courting death!”

When Tang Ling heard her words, her expression instantly turned ugly as a faint aura gushed out from her body.

As a proud daughter of the heavens, she was second only to Ling Jian ‘ER in the entire prodigy roll. She was confident that other than Ling Jian ‘er, her strength could dominate the entire Liuhai region.

The Zhang Fengying in front of her definitely did not look much older than her.

As a proud daughter of the heavens, the aura she emitted could not be underestimated.

However, she was facing Zhang Fengying, who possessed the ice fire civet cat and the entire inheritance of the hundred patrol elders. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Put away your imposing manner. If you were to make a move yourself, we can bear the consequences!”

Zhang Fengying said faintly to Tang Ling ‘er.

His tone was very calm, but he was still full of dominance and strength when facing the blood flow empire’s princess.

“This...”

When everyone around saw that Zhang Fengying was willing to offend the blood flow empire’s princess for the sake of Wang Xian, they were slightly shocked.

At this moment, Zhang Fengying was like:

Even if Wang Xian had committed all sorts of evil deeds, she would still follow him!

Even if Wang Xian was the enemy of the world, she would still follow him and become the enemy of the world!
