2563 2563 made the first move

It was either to keep a low profile and not provoke anyone!

It was either to keep a high profile and establish enough prestige so that no one would dare to provoke them!

This was what Wang Xian had always thought!

When he was weak, he could keep a low profile and not provoke anyone. He also didn’t do anything too extreme!

However, when he was strong, he had to establish sufficient prestige!

Regardless of whether it was the three major forces on Xing Hua planet or the demon Slayer sect, they had a grudge against long xing!

It was impossible for the Dragon Palace to be on guard against them from time to time. Therefore, they had to either destroy them or make them fear them. They didn’t dare to have any thoughts towards long xing!

Therefore, Wang Xian was prepared to fight head-on against the protection of the ninth-grade heaven sect!

Wang Xian knew that the current Dragon Palace and the chaotic Tiger Demon Nation were enough to fight against the ninth-grade heaven sect. So, why should he be afraid of them!

“Alright, Prime Minister Gui. Order the deviant demon to create a commotion on the commercial planet of the ninth-grade heaven sect. Kill only the disciples of the ninth-grade heaven sect. Don’t hurt the innocent too much!”

He immediately ordered Prime Minister Gui!

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Prime Minister GUI nodded immediately!

“Old National Advisor, we have to be prepared as well. After all, we are a top force in the southern star system and have a deep foundation. I’m not worried about the defense here on Dragon Star. I’m not worried about the dragon palace either. It’s just your place!”

Wang Xian reminded the old national advisor!

“Don’t worry, Dragon King. Our chaotic tiger demon country has been fighting with the demon Slayer sect for tens of millions of years. Putting everything else aside, there is no problem for us to protect ourselves. Furthermore, they do not dare to provoke us!”

The old nation master said calmly!

“HM, over there, I will give you 100,000 training grounds. I will not charge you any fees and I will not charge you any profits from the consumption of God Stones. The disciples of the chaotic tiger demon country can cultivate there!”

“In addition, you can transfer some of the core disciples of the Tiger Chaos Demon Nation to the Dragon Star. Within the Dragon Star, more than a dozen immortal king level seven powerhouses wouldn’t be able to break in!”

Wang Xian said to the old nation master and the rest!

“Thank you, Dragon King. Haha, it’s our greatest fortune for the Tiger Chaos Demon Nation to be able to make friends with the Dragon Palace!”

A hint of excitement flashed across the old nation master’s eyes. He immediately stood up and cupped his fists to express his gratitude!

“Thank you, Dragon King!”

The national advisor and the others also immediately stood up to express their gratitude!

The Dragon Star training grounds could be said to be extremely popular in the entire southern star system. 100,000 training grounds were directly given to the chaotic Tiger Demon Kingdom!

This was secondary. The training grounds consumed divine stones, and the Dragon Palace would definitely intercept a portion of the divine stones. The Dragon Palace would not accept this portion now, and it was equivalent to giving them a training ground!

100,000 training grounds were a huge amount of resources given the current situation of the training grounds!

With this training ground and a portion of the profits from the commercial planet of the Dragon Star, the turbulent Tiger Demon Nation could increase their profits by ten times!

“It’s alright. We are all friends!”

Wang Xian waved his hand at them.

After a simple sentence, Wang Xian flew out of the Dragon Palace and hovered above the Dragon Star. He looked around!

In just a few days, the dragon star training ground was filled to the brim every day. The profits of the training ground even exceeded the war pets!

With the sale of the war pets, the Dragon Palace had obtained a huge amount of resources. Now, the number of undying fighters in the Dragon Palace had reached close to 2,000!

Among them, there were about 10 undying fighters with level 6 strength!

As for undying fighters with level 5 strength, there were more than 60 of them!

Every day, there were many members of the Dragon Palace who possessed the immortal king combat strength!

The number of tourists on Dragon Star had reached 10 billion every day!

“Next, it will be either chaos or peace!”

Wang Xian said calmly!

However, the current Dragon Palace had basically gained a firm foothold and was not afraid of any force!

Time passed day by day. The destruction of Xing Hua Planet had laid the foundation for the complete rise of Dragon Star!

In just a few days, Dragon Star had completely replaced Xing Hua Planet!

Similarly, the Dragon Palace and the tiger chaotic demon country had also risen strongly!

Now, it was basically confirmed that both the Dragon Palace and the Tiger Chaotic Demon Country had an undying level 7 god King guarding them!

The situation where the four forces were at their strongest had become the five forces at their strongest!

“Rumble Rumble Rumble!”

However, just five days later, a terrifying explosion suddenly occurred within a luxurious building on a grade 9 Sky Clan Business Planet!

The terrifying energy instantly leveled the entire building!

“Hiss, what... What’s going on? How did the Shenming building suddenly be leveled to the ground? Just now, I felt a terrifying power here. Is there someone fighting here?”

“Look, it seems like a lot of people died. Someone actually dared to kill people on a ninth-grade Celestial Trade Planet!”

“Who... who did this? Are they courting death?”

Around the Shen Ming building, some people looked over, their faces filled with shock!

It had been a long time since anyone dared to cause trouble on a grade 9 Sky sect business planet!

...

It had even been over 10,000 years since anyone dared to kill in a grade 9 Sky sect territory!

Not to mention such a huge commotion!

“Sou Sou Sou!”

The next moment, hundreds of undying emperors flew over at a terrifying speed. They looked at everything below, their expressions extremely dark!

“Rumble Rumble Rumble!”

An undying waved his arm and all the bricks and metal rose, revealing the thousands of corpses below!

“It’s a disciple of our ninth grade sky sect, there seems to be a disciple gathering here!”

An undying looked over, his expression changed and he immediately landed on the ground!

“A substantial law energy, it’s an undying!”

“Only attacking our ninth grade sky sect disciples, what are they doing? Are they showing off or warning? Who Dares to kill on our ninth grade Sky Sect Business Planet!”

A thick killing intent shot out from the old man in the center!

...

“Search for all traces, immediately!”

He roared angrily!

The other undying emperors immediately searched!

“Skynet did not detect any information!”

“Other than knowing that an undying godly monarch had attacked, there’s no other information!” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Very quickly, information was transmitted one after another. The expressions of the ninth grade heaven sect experts were extremely ugly!

There were no clues. Other than knowing that it was an undying godly monarch, there was no other information!

“Patriarch, could it be the Dragon Palace and the Tiger Chaos Fey Kingdom?”

Suddenly, a middle-aged godly monarch said with a change in expression!

It had been tens of thousands of years since the ninth-grade heaven sect had clashed with other factions. If one were to say that there was only one person who was most likely to deliberately destroy and kill people on their commercial planet, it would be the Dragon Palace and the Tiger Chaos Fey Kingdom!

A few days ago, the Dragon Palace and the Tiger Chaos Fey Kingdom had bluntly told Xing Hua Planet and their ninth-grade heaven sect to bear the consequences!

Now that planet Xing Hua had been destroyed, they were suddenly attacked and thousands of disciples were killed!

“The Dragon Palace and the Tiger Riot Demon Nation!”

The elder’s eyes were full of killing intent!

“Are they trying to challenge our limits and lead us to destruction?”

Violent killing intent surged out of their bodies!

“Let them have it!”
