Chapter 1651: The 1,651 humans and Dragons merged into one

“In the dark and light herb garden that is covered by the formation, the defense is the weakest. Let’s go to these two places first!”

Wang Xian scanned the area below him with his dragon eyes that seemed to be able to see through the void and the netherworld.

He tried his best to conceal his figure and slowly flew towards the dark herb garden below.

Perhaps it was because no one had infiltrated the celestial herb valley in the past tens of thousands of years. Although there seemed to be many powerhouses in the entire valley, no one had discovered him.

Wang Xian came to the sky above the dark herb garden. He moved his body and entered directly.

The moment he entered, Wang Xian saw five figures inside.

Five old men dressed in life and death elixir workshop uniforms were refining elixirs. They did not notice Wang Xian who had entered.

He waved his arm and a wave of destructive energy engulfed the five of them. The five powerhouses at the eighth level of the Seethrough void tier were instantly killed.

“Even if it’s the smallest dark herb garden, there are at least a million spiritual herbs in there!”

Wang Xian looked at the herb garden with a burning look in his eyes.

Without any hesitation, he threw all the elixirs into the storage spiritual bag. He didn’t spare even the low-level spiritual herbs.

Five minutes later, Wang Xian passed through the formation and entered the herb garden of light.

There were more experts in the protection of light than in the herb garden of darkness. However, they were also some experts at level eight of the Seethrough realm.

Wang Xian waved his arm and continued to wipe them out. Then, he began to plunder the herb garden in a frenzy.

“There are experts at level nine of the Seethrough realm guarding the herb garden of wind attribute. However, with Ao Yao and myself around, there shouldn’t be much of a Problem!”

Following the same method, Wang Xian released ao Yao and the two of them sneaked into the herb garden of wind attribute.

Now that Wang Xian possessed an assassination technique that was no weaker than Ao Yao, he easily worked together with Ao Yao to eliminate the two ninth-level profound void martial stage cultivators in the wind attribute herb garden.

Just like that, there was no commotion at all. Wang Xian brought ao Yao into the six herb gardens of light, dark, wind, thunder, water, and earth.

“There are half-step longevity experts in the remaining three herb gardens. It’s impossible for me to assassinate them!”

Standing in the Earth attribute herb garden, Wang Xian looked at the other three areas.

The other three areas were the largest areas in the entire herb garden.

The level and quantity of the spiritual herbs there were much higher than the spiritual herbs he obtained.

“There’s no rush. After i absorb the spiritual herbs in my hands, I will have invincible strength below longevity. When the time comes, I can completely crush these three half-step longevity masters with my powerful strength!”

Wang Xian thought to himself. His heart was burning with passion.

If he could obtain the resources of the entire herb garden, wouldn’t he be able to fight against longevity?

“I will be discovered if I make a breakthrough here. I still have to go out and make a breakthrough!”

Wang Xian thought to himself. His eyes were burning as he looked at the longevity level spiritual tree in the center. After hesitating for a moment, he resisted the temptation and flew out.

A longevity level spirit tree could be called a demigod tree. This type of spirit tree had its own domain and possessed spirituality.

Even the divine tree above the longevity level possessed extremely terrifying combat strength. It was comparable to the godly state and was extremely heaven-defying.

If he wanted to pick fruits from this type of spirit tree, it would definitely cause a commotion.

“Bear with it for a while. The situation in the other six herb gardens will not be discovered!”

Wang Xian moved his body and flew out of the Heaven Herb Valley without causing any ripples.

After flying out of the valley, he arrived 40 kilometers away in two flashes. He took out the spiritual herbs from his storage spiritual bag.

There were tens of millions of spiritual herbs. Among them, there were hundreds of thousands of spiritual herbs at the void interpretation level.

However, there were only about 100,000 spiritual herbs that were fully matured. The rest of the spiritual herbs were not mature yet.

However, this was enough. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Wang Xian threw the spiritual herbs into his mouth one by one and quickly swallowed them.

The dragon energy in his body was increasing at a terrifying speed.

“Ka-ka-ka!”

A powerful force washed over Wang Xian’s body. His entire dragon body doubled in size, reaching a height of 300 meters.

Five-colored rays of light circulated around his body. The power of light and darkness enveloped the surrounding space.

A powerful and invincible aura was emitted from his body.

“Phew, I’ve made a breakthrough. After this breakthrough, I’m one step closer to the peak of the supernatural continent!”

Wang Xian slowly opened his eyes. A powerful pressure spread out in the surroundings.

He moved his body and transformed into his human form to feel his body. A smile appeared on his face.

The breakthrough this time was no surprise. His dragon tail had become stronger.

What surprised him was that he had become one with the dragon.

On his attribute panel, he could transform into a human and become one with the dragon.

This meant that even if Wang Xian didn’t transform into a divine dragon, he would have the combat strength of a half-step to the peak of longevity.

There was no difference between the human form and the divine dragon form.

When he raised his arm, he could immediately transform into a dragon claw that was a few kilometers in size.

When he opened his mouth, he could transform into a dragon head that was a few kilometers in size!

This was the human-dragon unity!

“Every upgrade is a qualitative change!”

“Next, it will be the entire Heaven Herb Valley!”

Wang Xian immediately turned his head and looked into the Heaven Herb Valley. His face was filled with excitement.

Boom

Just as Wang Xian was about to enter the Heaven Herb Valley again, a raging fire suddenly rose in the valley ahead.

The fire directly shot tens of thousands of meters into the sky. The entire Heaven Herb Valley was like a terrifying furnace!

“What’s going on? is the formation activated?”

Wang Xian’s expression changed slightly as he looked at the terrifying flames.

The blazing flames dyed the entire sky red.

The air was burning and a wave of heat surged over.

“They discovered the disappearance of the spiritual herbs in the six herb gardens. They activated the formation immediately!”

Wang Xian’s pupils constricted slightly.

This kind of attack and defense formation was one. Once it was activated, it would be surrounded by a forbidden area.

Under such circumstances, even if he could ignore the formation, he wouldn’t be able to enter it.

“The heavens are really unfair. I can’t believe I was discovered so quickly. If I can still enter...”

Wang Xian was a little unwilling.

If he could enter, his strength would be able to increase by one level.

At that time, his combat strength that was comparable to the longevity realm would be able to fight head-on with Feng Yun and the other two forces!
