Chapter 1140: 1141 beast taming technique and special bloodline

Translator: 5496903

Wang Xian’s gaze swept across the surroundings as he looked at the six insightful emptiness realm experts heading to different places. He was slightly fearful.

Even though these insightful emptiness realm experts were heavily injured, they were still able to kill him in one move.

“Go. If they dare to attack, I will avenge you!”

Feng Luan looked at Wang Xian and smiled. With a wave of her arm, the Phoenix that was circling around her came directly to Wang Xian.

The Flaming Phoenix circled around him. If someone were to attack him, the Phoenix would be able to defend itself immediately.

Wang Xian nodded his head helplessly. The Flaming Phoenix circled around his entire body. With a move of his body, he flew directly in a direction.

“Bang!”

Wang Xian’s arm smashed directly at a sculpture. The sound of collision was heard throughout the entire hall.

His attack caused the other six insightful emptiness realm experts to look over.

“What the F * ck!”

However, what surprised the six insightful emptiness realm experts was that Wang Xian’s attack did not break the sculpture when it landed on it.

Wang Xian’s face was also filled with astonishment. His face turned slightly black. He had used 60% of his strength just now.

“Hehe, Trash!”

“HMPH, how dare a piece of trash come in!”

Two mocking voices rang out, making Wang Xian even more embarrassed. His face turned black.

“Eh, some of the sculptures are solid and hard to destroy!”

Feng Luan saw Wang Xian’s embarrassed look and sent him a voice transmission.

Wang Xian almost wanted to vomit blood.

The six insightful void tier experts turned their heads in disdain. They saw Feng Luan breaking the sculptures one by one and tried to break them as well.

Furthermore, they were checking each other out. Once a treasure appeared, it might be the time for a fight.

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows slightly and his gaze started to change.

The mud in the sculptures was too sturdy. He decided to use his ocular technique to observe.

There was no other energy in the mud. This allowed him to see through and see the situation inside.

“Why is there only a drop of fresh blood in every sculpture? What is the use of this fresh blood?”

Wang Xian looked at the sculptures one by one and frowned as he pondered.

There were all kinds of sculptures of ferocious beasts. They were flying in the sky, swimming in the water, running on land, having two legs, three legs, four legs, and even more than ten legs. It was like an exhibition hall for sculptures of ferocious beasts.

Wang Xian looked at one sculpture after another of ferocious beasts, but there was nothing inside.

“Eh?”

Suddenly, Wang Xian was slightly stunned. He looked at a ferocious beast that was lying on the ground. It was about ten meters long and looked like an alligator.

In the middle of this ferocious beast, there was a ball of liquid. The liquid was about half a meter long and was emitting a sparkling luster.

“This is the bloodline of a ferocious beast. It should be at level nine of the supernatural realm!”

Wang Xian’s eyes revealed a burning glow. He moved his arm and attacked the sculpture directly.

He didn’t destroy all of it. Instead, he created a half-meter-wide hole.

“I got it!” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Wang Xian’s eyes were filled with joy. The bloodline of an extraordinary level nine ferocious beast was worth close to ten billion middle-grade spirit stones!

However, when Wang Xian broke open the sculpture and saw the situation inside, he immediately froze. The bloodline of the ferocious beast inside was actually gone.

It couldn’t be said that it was gone. Instead, it had completely dried up. There was no sign of life at all.

“Eh?”

Everyone looked over when they saw Wang Xian breaking a sculpture.

Wang Xian ignored the gazes of the people around him. He broke the sculpture completely with one punch after another.

There was nothing left. Indeed, there was nothing left.

The ferocious beast bloodline that was filled with life in his line of sight had actually dried up to the point where there was no sign of life at all.

When the people around saw that there was nothing inside, they immediately turned their heads around and attacked the sculpture in front of them again.

With a casual wave of their hands, they directly broke more than ten sculptures.

They didn’t dare to use too much strength. If there really was a treasure inside, they would cry.

“Eh?”

Suddenly, a cry of surprise came from the side, attracting everyone once again.

“Dried blood, and there’s quite a lot of it. Isn’t this the bloodline of a demonic beast or fierce beast? Will it lose its vitality after a long time?”

The insightful void martial expert from star-moon kingdom said with a dark expression as he looked at the large pool of dried blood beside him.

His words immediately caused the expressions of the surrounding people to turn ugly.

Old Man Bai Xun specialized in Beast Taming, and Beast Tamers were related to bloodlines. It was normal for him to possess the bloodline of fierce beasts and demonic beasts, but if the bloodline of fierce beasts and demonic beasts didn’t have any energy for a long time, they would die and become ordinary blood.

“Damn it, it can’t be that there’s nothing!”

The level three void interpretation expert from the Kingdom of wind howl waved his black-faced arm forcefully, and the dozens of sculptures in front of him shattered.

There was nothing inside, but one of them contained a large piece of dried blood.

This scene caused Feng Luan’s face to turn black.

However, when Wang Xian saw this scene, he revealed a contemplative look.

How could this be?

He clearly saw the bloodline of a ferocious beast that was filled with vitality. How did it turn into dried blood after it was opened?

It was impossible for the Dragon Eyes of light and dark fire to be wrong. Something must have gone wrong.

Wang Xian looked at the dried liquid in front of him, then looked at the one beside him. He walked forward while deep in thought.

After checking dozens of them consecutively, Wang Xian’s gaze landed in front of a sculpture of a flying bird and ferocious beast. His eyes were sparkling.

In his line of sight, there was a ball of liquid in the stomach of this four-meter-sized flying bird sculpture. It was half a meter in size and was exuding an exuberant vitality.

Blood of the flying bird in flowery clothing: level eight extraordinary

“That’s right. This can’t be wrong. That one just now wasn’t wrong either!”

Looking at the information that the system had sent back, Wang Xian sized up the sculpture of the flying bird in flowery clothing carefully.

Its slender neck flew upwards. Its sharp mouth and bright eyes looked as if they were real.

The feathers on its body were lifelike. Even the position of its buttocks was only left with a hole. However, the hole was covered by the feathers.

Wang Xian looked at the hole and the corner of his mouth twitched. He touched the feathers beside the hole and pulled them away forcefully.

Looking at the hole, Wang Xian fell into deep thought.

“Bai Xun, that Old Thing, shouldn’t have such a strong taste, right?”

Wang Xian clenched his fists slightly. He had the urge to hit someone.

“D * mn, go and take a look. If it’s not what I think, I will smash all of You!”

Wang Xian’s face was dark. With a wave of his arm, he plucked all the feathers in front of the hole.

He moved his body and went straight into the cave.

“This...”

The insightful void martial artist, who could sense every trace of Wang Xian in the surroundings, was slightly stunned when he saw that Wang Xian had gone straight into the cave!

“This trash!”

“Hehe, he is too weak to break the sculpture. He came here to embarrass himself. I want to slap this trash to death!”

“Idiot!”

The three insightful emptiness realm experts from the star-moon kingdom laughed mockingly.

Wang Xian’s situation had actually eased their frustration. After all, there was a clown performing for them!

“Haha, you guys are a bunch of idiots. A bunch of trash!”

Wang Xian, who had entered the sculpture, couldn’t help but laugh maniacally in his heart.

He didn’t expect that the Bai Xun Old Man’s taste was so strong!
