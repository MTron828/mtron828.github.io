“The Dragon Palace has now occupied the territory of our world margin sect, but they have sold the land to Duan Tian and Jiu Xiao. The Dragon Palace has occupied the ocean. If we want to take revenge, I can bring people to destroy the Dragon Palace’s ocean base.”

Behind the main hall, an elder growled with a murderous look on his face.

“Yes, we can send people to destroy the Dragon Palace’s ocean base. The imperial court can’t control us in the remote Demon Island.”

Another elder of the world margin sect echoed.

“The Dragon Palace is stronger than us. They might have expected us to take revenge.”

The other elder frowned.

The two patriarchs sat there with gloomy faces.

“Patriarch, I think we can kill one person first and take the rest of the revenge slowly.”

At this moment, the sect master of the world margin suddenly said.

“HMM?”

Everyone looked at him, waiting for his answer.

“Northern Frost, the Dragon King’s disciple. As far as I know, the Dragon King’s disciple is currently hunting the abyssal seed with the other princesses of the imperial court. As long as we are well-prepared, we will definitely be able to kill the Dragon King’s disciple.”

“His disciple is known as the frost goddess. Many people say that she has the potential to be a great emperor. If we kill her, the Dragon King will definitely be very angry when he finds out.”

Sect Master Tianya said with a cold face.

“The frost goddess, bei Shuang?”

The eyes of the two forefathers and the three elders of Tianya flickered.

“Forefather, I think it’s possible. Isn’t the Dragon King killing our people? Then we’ll kill the Dragon King’s people and kill his disciple!”

An elder immediately echoed in a cold voice.

“Okay, let’s start with the disciple of the Dragon King. Next, we’ll take revenge bit by bit.”

Feng Yazi, the world’s end patriarch, immediately decided.

“Patriarch, let me do it. I’ll do it. I’ll definitely cut off bei Shuang’s head and send it to the Dragon King.”

An elder requested.

“If an elder does it, the other party might escape. Besides, if there’s a powerhouse protecting the disciple of the Dragon King, we’ll alert the enemy.”

The world’s end patriarch said thoughtfully.

“Then let’s all three of us go and bring a dozen deacons with us!”

An elder said solemnly.

“No need, I’ll do it myself.” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

At this time, world end Patriarch Wu Lin Gao suddenly said.

“HM? Patriarch, you’ll Do It Yourself, an undying god King Level 8 lady...”

“I’ll do it myself, I’ll cut off the head of the Dragon King’s disciple.”

World End sect master and the others were slightly shocked, but Wu Lin Gao interrupted them.

“Patriarch, do you want to do it alone? Do you need our cooperation?”

An elder of Tianya said.

“No need. I can do it myself.”

Wu Lingao said coldly.

“Then I’ll immediately order my disciples to investigate bei Shuang.”

Sect Master Tianya immediately said.

“Go. Send your core disciples to investigate. I want to know the whereabouts of all the disciples of the Dragon King within three days.”

World Margin Patriarch Wu Lin Gao said in a cold voice.

“It’s the Patriarch!”

Sect master world margin and the three elders immediately responded and walked out.

World Margin’s revenge was about to begin!

..

“Eh, World Margin Patriarch wants to personally intercept and kill bei Shuang.”

However, the world margin sect never expected that Wang Xian would receive this news in just an hour.

When he saw this news, a cold glint flashed in his eyes.

“Dragon King, the mantis stalks the cicada and the oriole follows behind. We can use miss bei Shuang as bait. If only a peak-stage immortal King comes this time, we can totally kill him.”

At the side, Ba Qi’s eyes were sparkling as he spoke.

“It will take some time to kill a peak-stage immortal king. However, we can do it.”

Wang Xian was deep in thought as the corners of his mouth curled up slightly.

“However, we have a better method. The imperial court has already announced that humans are prohibited from fighting among themselves during the war. Once everyone knows about the heaven’s end sect attacking Northern Frost, will the imperial court let them off?”

“Even if the imperial court won’t destroy them, our dragon palace can be prepared to attack the heaven’s end sect directly. In that case, the imperial court can’t Say Anything.”

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered as he said.

...

“Dragon King, according to the information we received, the world margin sect has a good relationship with a protector. Will the imperial court do it?”

Ba Qi said.

“Since the imperial court didn’t help the world margin sect, they should still abide by some rules. Moreover, when the ancestor of the world margin sect tried to kill bei Shuang, the Imperial Star Ladies and the other imperial ladies would also be witnesses. They are the imperial court’s Imperial Ladies.”

Wang Xian said faintly.

The Dragon Palace’s current strength had completely surpassed the Heaven’s end sect.

If not for the imperial court’s rules, the Dragon Palace’s army could have directly destroyed the heaven’s end sect.

However, since the rules of the imperial court were violated by the Heaven’s end sect, the Dragon Palace could also openly attack the heaven’s end sect and kill their powerhouses.

At that time, the imperial court would have nothing to say.

“Sky Array, AO qitian, Ao Jian, the few of you, follow me to the frontline planet of the imperial court. Ba Qi, once you have any information, report to me immediately, especially when patriarch world margin tried to kill bei Shuang.”

Wang Xian said to them.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

...

Ba Qi and the rest nodded immediately.

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian moved and immediately flew towards the frontline planet of the imperial court.

All the way until he arrived at the courtyard where the Imperial Star Lady lived. He took a glance and did not find the imperial star Lady and the rest.

“Ao Qitian, Ao Yao, go to the Abyss and contact the Dragon Guards to protect them and ensure the safety of bei Shuang.”

“Also, be careful. Don’t let some people from the world margin sect notice you.”

Wang Xian was a little worried and said to Ao Qitian, Ao Yao, and the rest.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Ao Qitian and the rest nodded and flew out immediately.

Wang Xian did this to prevent bei Shuang and the rest from being killed by the world margin patriarch the moment they came out of the abyss.

After all, he had to be fully prepared.

Not everyone could kill his disciple.

“Wang Xian, I heard from the Dragon Guards that you are back.”

A day later, Wang Xian heard the voice of the celestial maiden. Following that, Wang Xian saw a few figures walking over.

The celestial maiden and bei Shuang were walking together, followed by a few dragon guards.

One of the Dragon Guards had the combat strength of a Level 9 immortal king.

“How was it? How was the harvest?”

Wang Xian looked at them and said with a smile.

“We have gained a lot during this period of time. This is all thanks to sister bei Shuang. Sister bei Shuang’s frost art is too amazing.”

The Empress Star Lady said happily.

“Furthermore, I will be able to exchange for a treasure very soon. It Won’t be long before I can advance to immortal king level two.”

She continued.

“Congratulations to the beauties. Are you still going out in the next few days?”

Wang Xian smiled and asked them.

“Of course. We have made an agreement with senior sister and the rest to enter the Abyss one day later.”

“Hehe, I still want my name to appear on the heroes list!”

The Imperial Star Lady raised her head and said with fighting spirit.
