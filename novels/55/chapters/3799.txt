3800 3799 teased them!

“Yes, the Dragon King is obviously trying to tease them. Even if the Green River Water Phoenix uses all of its life force, it is still no match for the Dragon King.”

“If the third Prince’s Battle Angels, who are at the seventh level of the ruler realm, didn’t use up their life force, they might be able to fight the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace!”

In the surrounding area, there was an expert who was at the seventh level of the ruler realm!

They knew a little about the Dragon King’s strength.

How could they fight with just the third prince and the Green River Water Phoenix?

Just as they said, Wang Xian was toying with them!

He wanted to let the lofty third prince and the Green River Water Phoenix know that without the support of their race, they were an existence that could be easily slaughtered.

The third prince, the Green River Water Phoenix, and the two Netherworld Ghost Avatars were fighting each other.

In a one-on-two situation, they were not at a disadvantage at all.

They even had the advantage. If they continued to fight, the two Netherworld Ghost Avatars would be scattered.

However, one must know that this was before Wang Xian made a move!

“Die, die, die, die!”

The third Prince roared crazily as he fought.

He also realized the problem in front of him, but he couldn’t do anything about it. At this moment, he had to stand up and fight with the Dragon King.

But now, the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace was still standing there and didn’t move!

“Isn’t the gap too big?”

“The third prince and the Green River Water Phoenix are now trembling together with the ghost avatar of the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace. What will happen if the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace makes a move?”

“If we want to defeat the Dragon King Now, we have to make a move from an expert who is at level eight!”

“He’s too strong. This is the Dragon Palace’s Dragon King!”

The surrounding expert disciples sighed slightly.

The experts from the Phoenix clan and the Angel clan looked extremely embarrassed when they saw this scene.

Their breathing was a little hurried!

“Hehe!”

“I’m not messing with you guys anymore!”

Wang Xian looked at this scene and sneered. He looked at the Green River Water Phoenix.

“The first one will kill you first. I’m going to make my move!”

He spoke.

Before he made his move, he reminded the Green River Water Phoenix.

This was undoubtedly a taunt to him.

Crash

The next moment, Wang Xian made his move. He flapped his uninitiated holy wings and disappeared instantly!

When the Green River Water Phoenix heard Wang Xian’s words, she sensed a terrifying figure attacking her. Her expression changed drastically!

“Fire of death, unleash!”

She roared with blood-red eyes and launched a large-scale attack.

At this moment, one-fifth of her life force was burned.

Buzz

Wang Xian sensed the energy of this attack and immediately formed a terrifying defense. At the same time, the Tai Chi Dragon Disc started to spin.

He continued to attack the body of the Green River Water Phoenix.

The moment he rushed over, the attack that he had set up began to crumble.

The attack landed on the Tai Chi Dragon Plate!

However, the tai chi dragon plate easily blocked this attack.

The power of the backlash began to rebound.

Because this layer of energy had the weakening effect of Wang Xian’s defense, this backlash was not too strong.

However, it was definitely not weak.

The Green River Water Phoenix immediately felt a strange energy gushing into her body. Caught off guard, she spat out a mouthful of blood.

Splash

In the next second, Wang Xian flapped the primaless saint wings and landed on the body of the Green River Water Phoenix in an instant!

He stood on it and stomped his feet gently. A wave of energy surged into her body directly.

“CHIRP CHIRP CHIRP!”

A mournful voice came out of her mouth.

“Hehe, Green River Water Phoenix, you still want to kill me with your strength?”

Wang Xian stood on top of her body and said mockingly.

“Too strong, this is simply too strong!”

“Green River Water Phoenix couldn’t do anything to the Dragon King even when she was risking her life. The Dragon King’s strength is indeed too strong!”

“The gap is too big. Maybe the third prince and the Green River Water Phoenix would never think that the day would come when they provoked the former Dragon King!”

All the strong disciples around were extremely shocked when they saw this scene.

“Attack!”

“Destroy the Dragon King!”

However, at this moment, a group of strong practitioners from the Phoenix clan stared at Wang Xian and launched an attack instantly.

They seemed to be waiting for this opportunity, waiting for this time!

“Huh?”

“They are going to ambush the Dragon King!”

The moment all the experts from the Phoenix tribe made their move, the surrounding experts were shocked.

The Phoenix tribe was not keeping their word!

“HMPH, you are courting death!”

Lan qingyue snorted coldly when she saw this scene.

She had been paying attention to Wang Xian and the rest of them. How could she let them ambush Wang Xian?

Lan Qingyue waved her arm and a black hole appeared behind Wang Xian. The black hole instantly enveloped him.

In an instant, Wang Xian’s figure returned to his side!

“Kill them!”

After Lan Qingyue completed all of this, she ordered Xiao Lan, Xiao House, and Xiao Bai with a cold gaze!

“Woo Woo!”

“Woo Woo Woo!”

In an instant, Xiao Lan, Xiao House, and Xiao Bai moved. Waves of terrifying grayish energy charged straight at them!

This grey energy condensed into the shape of fish.

Their bodies did not move, but a terrifying attack had already descended!

Among this group of fish, there were some fish that strangely opened their mouths, their mouths filled with black holes!

Strange!

Terrifying!

“Not good, defend!”

The two phoenixes that had used the blood essence of their phoenix totems to forcefully raise their strength roared.

They flapped their wings, forming a pair of Phoenix Wings that blotted out the Sun.

They met Xiao Lan and the others’attacks head on.

“Buzz Buzz Buzz!”

When the energy began to collide, an extremely strange scene appeared.

When some of the Phoenix energy collided with the fish that opened their mouths like a black hole, the phoenix energy immediately disappeared.

It was as if it was being devoured!

However, if one looked closely, one would be able to see that it wasn’t swallowed.

Instead, it was instantly transported to the bodies of Xiao Lan and the others.

These energy attacks landed on Xiao Lan and the others, and it was as if they were tickling them.

After the Phoenix Energy was swallowed, the black hole in the fish’s mouth also disappeared.

However, the fish continued to attack them.

This attack represented the attacks of the three Kun rulers at the eighth rank.

How could the phoenixes below resist?

“Pu Pu Pu!”

“Pu Pu Pu!”

In an instant, the two phoenixes that had forcefully upgraded spat out a large amount of blood, and their bodies trembled violently.

After all, they had forcefully upgraded, and their combat strength was only comparable to a ruler at the eighth rank, just like the Netherworld race expert’s ghost clone.

It was very ordinary!

They couldn’t resist the attacks of the three Kun’s!

“Third prince, attack, break through!” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

At the side, a dark angel from the angel race hurriedly shouted at the third prince.

The third prince gritted his teeth, and the crown on his head shot out a beam of light power.

The light power landed on the Archangel’s secret message.

All the attacks above were directed at the Blue Moon.
