Chapter 354: Boundless Seas, The Choice Of Location For The Dragon Palace (2)

“Currently, I’m only able to build a Level 1 Dragon Palace. However, even a Level 1 Dragon Palace wouldn’t be any weaker than the base of a Sacred Sect!”

“A Level 1 Dragon Palace can be established in the depths of the sea. The area of the Dragon Palace could cover a radius of ten kilometers!”

“This is just a preliminary Dragon Palace. In the future, I’m going to build more structures.”

Wang Xian didn’t know much about the preliminary Dragon Palace. However, he was sure that the Dragon Palace couldn’t be built in the Bohai Sea.

Bohai Sea was just a small piece of the seas with a depth of several tens of meters. Wang Xian wasn’t certain of the exact height of the Dragon Palace.

However, it would definitely be more than several tens of meters.

The location where he would build his Dragon Palace would at least have to be four to five hundred meters deep.

The location of the Dragon Palace wouldn’t stay stationary forever. A Level 2 Dragon Palace would be able to move. In fact, when the Dragon Palace reached a higher level, it could even become a Dragon Nation.

A Dragon Nation could fly in the air directly and would be incomparably powerful.

Wang Xian brought Sun Lingxiu around the floating island. Subsequently, he dived into the sea.

“Prime Minister Turtle, follow me to look for a region in the seas to build the Dragon Palace.”

Wang Xian transmitted his orders to Prime Minister Turtle.

“Yes, Dragon King!”

Prime Minister Turtle’s huge body floated rapidly. Wang Xian stood on it as they moved rapidly towards the deeper seas.

The sea was beautiful, majestic and unfathomable.

Standing on the back of the giant Prime Minister Turtle, Wang Xian looked around him.

Regions that were tens of meters deep wouldn’t be in consideration.

Prime Minister Turtle was astonishingly quick. His current strength had now reached the pinnacle of Level 11. In just a few months, he would be able to reach Level 12.

“We will be entering the Eastern Sea soon. There’s a trench in the Eastern Sea that reaches a depth of over seven thousand meters. Moreover, the Eastern Sea isn’t too far from Rivertown!”

Wang Xian stood on Prime Minister Turtle and looked ahead of him.

The sea ahead was much deeper. Barely any sunlight could reach this depth.

The density of fish around was also higher.

Wang Xian didn’t devour the schools of fish. Instead, he ordered Prime Minister Turtle to swim forward rapidly.

“Huh? That is...? What a huge shark! It’s over fourteen meters long!”

Wang Xian looked to his left and his pupils couldn’t help but constrict.

That huge shark was looking in the direction of Wang Xian attentively with his cold-looking eyes.

That is clearly the territory of a race!

Wang Xian thought to himself. In the depths of the sea, different races would occupy different territories. If one entered into their territory, the person would suffer horrifying attacks from the race.

Continue ahead!

This was the first time Wang Xian had toured such a huge area of the seabed. This experience also allowed him to understand how horrifying the seabed was.

There were underwater monsters with four huge limbs and looked just like a dinosaur.

There were creatures that spanned over two meters, had countless legs and a tail with spikes that glowed in a dull glimmer.

There were powerful fish that resembled tanks and had horrifying-looking heads.

And there were fish that resembled bats with sharp heads and poison stings.

These species were horrifying creatures that Wang Xian had not seen previously. They loitered within their own territory on the seabed and emitted horrifying auras.

Wang Xian didn’t clash with them. Even when these horrifying creatures charged towards him, he simply ordered Prime Minister Turtle to get away rapidly.

“Soon, I’ll be competing with you guys for supremacy in the seas!”

Wang Xian’s lips curved into a smile as he looked ahead.

“This is...?”

Right ahead of Wang Xian, there were multiple towering underwater mountains.

Each mountain was approximately two hundred meters tall.

Among them, the largest mountain was over two hundred meters tall.

These mountains were densely packed. In an area that spanned several tens of meters in radius, there were twenty mountains.

Other than the mountains, what caught Wang Xian’s attention was the faint glow of the surroundings.

The glow came from the jellyfish. In this region, there were lots of jellyfish. They were densely packed and illuminated the area as though it was the day.

“Magical and beautiful! Together with the surrounding mountains, this would be a great location to build the Dragon Palace!”

Wang Xian looked around him and revealed a satisfied expression.

The tallest mountain in the center could become his resting place or the accommodation for the Dragon King.

As for the surrounding mountains, it could be allocated to Roving Heavens and the others.

“This shall be it...”

Wang Xian looked around him in satisfaction. However, just as he made up his mind, he squinted his eyes and looked attentively towards a far place. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Right there, a bloom of humongous jellyfish was swimming towards the various mountains.

Although their speed wasn’t fast, their terrifying bodies made Wang Xian worried.

In the middle of the bloom, there was a jellyfish with countless tentacles. It was almost the size of the entire mountain.

It was shaped like an oval and spanned over ten meters. As for its tentacles, they were fifty to sixty meters long.

The densely packed glowing tentacles covered an area over a hundred meters.

“How could there be such a huge jellyfish?”

Wang Xian was shocked. Other than the largest jellyfish, there were multiple jellyfish with tentacles of thirty to forty meters.

The twenty-odd jellyfish together illuminated the entire region.

Before the eyes of Wang Xian, these jellyfish landed on the peak of each mountain.

Their tentacles scattered between the mountain peaks. When looking from afar, the region resembled mountains that were glowing.

“This is the territory of these huge jellyfish!”

Wang Xian’s eyebrows knitted together. Clearly, this place had been occupied by this powerful jellyfish race.

“Let’s go take a look.”

Wang Xian directed his thoughts to Prime Minister Turtle and commanded him to move closer towards one of the jellyfish.

When Prime Minister Turtle was approximately a hundred meters away from a jellyfish, the tentacles of the jellyfish, which were resting on the mountain, moved abruptly.

It was as though they had eyes. Those soft tentacles were covered in razor-sharp needles and pointed towards them.

Swish swish swish!

At the next instant, the densely packed needles that covered the surrounding fifty meters swept towards Wang Xian.

[Aurora Jellyfish: Level 11

Extractable Dragon Energy: 254,433]

“A Level 11 Jellyfish!”

When Wang Xian saw the information about this jellyfish, he wasn’t too surprised.

Boom!

At this moment, Prime Minister Turtle made a move. A wall of earth rose from the seabed and completely blocked off the needles from the jellyfish.

“Let’s go!”

Wang Xian instructed Prime Minister Turtle after seeing other jellyfish in the vicinity starting to move.

Prime Minister Turtle moved its limbs and left this region rapidly.

The bloom of jellyfish did not give chase upon seeing Wang Xian and Prime Minister Turtle leaving. They slowly landed back on the peak of the mountain.

“The largest jellyfish must be Level 12 while the rest are Level 11.”

Wang Xian frowned slightly. Among his subordinates, only Prime Minister Turtle, Roving Heavens and Roving Yaksha were Level 11. It would be difficult to deal with this bloom of jellyfish.

“There are still too many terrifying creatures in the seas. The Dragon Palace still isn’t sufficiently powerful!”

Wang Xian felt a little bitter!
