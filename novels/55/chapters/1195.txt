Chapter 1196: The second Prince of 1197 was furious

Translator: 5496903

“AH, my arm!”

A scream sounded in the banquet hall. Yin Xianfeng stared at his right hand with a face full of fear.

So what if it was empty!

When the Golden Light swept past, the arm immediately dissipated.

This...

He widened his eyes, a trace of shock and malevolence flashed in his eyes.

In the surroundings, all the sounds instantly stopped. Four to five hundred people looked on with faces full of shock.

“This... what terrifying strength. Yin Xianfeng is ranked 20th among the heaven’s favorites. How could he be defeated so easily?”

“Hiss, he injured eight disciples of the six element sect in one move. Now, he defeated Yin Xianfeng in two moves. Where did he come from? Why haven’t I heard of him before?”

“No wonder he was invited by the second prince. His strength can already be ranked on the heaven’s favorites list!”

Everyone’s eyes widened as they stared at Wang Xian and Yin Xianfeng, exclaiming in surprise.

The strength that Wang Xian displayed was too strong.

“His strength is something that even Xu Wenling can’t match up to, right?”

A young man looked at Wang Xian who was standing there with an indifferent expression and said heavily.

When everyone in the banquet heard his words, they nodded their heads slightly.

Xu Wenling was ranked 18th on the prodigy roll, but the strength displayed by the young man was definitely stronger than his.

“Humph, he’s just a bloodline cultivator. After all, there’s a limit!”

When Xu Wenling heard this, his face slightly displeased as he lightly snorted and coldly said.

“Bloodline cultivator? He’s a bloodline cultivator?”

The surrounding people were slightly stunned as they came to a sudden realization.

“No wonder, from their conversation just now, that young man came from a weak country. He shouldn’t have such terrifying strength. So he’s a bloodline cultivator!”

“I don’t know what level of bloodline he has, but that young man might be in trouble!”

Some people looked at Yin Xianfeng, whose arm had disappeared. Yin Xianfeng’s face was extremely ferocious, and his eyes were full of killing intent.

They knew that this matter would not be resolved so easily.

In the territory of the six element sect, they had severely injured their disciple and wiped out one of their most outstanding disciples.

“Call the elders in the villa over!”

Suddenly, a cold voice sounded. The short-haired young man who had been sitting beside Yin Xianfeng stood up and stared at Wang Xian with a grave expression.

“You hurt people in the territory of our six element sect. You Don’t put us in your eyes!”

The short-haired young man looked at Wang Xian expressionlessly and said in a deep voice.

“Hehe, if the people of your six element sect want to kill me, would I put you in My Eyes?”

Wang Xian revealed a mocking look in his eyes as he walked towards them slowly.

The short-haired young man narrowed his eyes slightly as he looked at Wang Xian.

“Hua Hua Hua!”

“Who dares to cause trouble in the territory of our six element sect?”

At this moment, a cold voice covered the entire area. The sound of footsteps was heard. Everyone was slightly shocked as they quickly looked forward.

A middle-aged man was holding a long spear in his hand as he flew towards them with a cold expression.

Below them, twenty to thirty disciples of the six element sect were holding weapons in their hands as they walked towards them aggressively.

“Void interpretation expert!”

When they saw the middle-aged man in the sky, everyone’s gaze froze slightly.

“Elder, it’s this guy. It’s this guy. Not only did he heavily injure us, but he also crippled one of senior brother Yin’s arms. Elder, you have to avenge us!”

A young man who was lying on the ground shouted at the middle-aged man in the sky with a pale face. He pointed at Wang Xian and his eyes were filled with killing intent.

“Huh?”

The middle-aged man swept his gaze across the area. When his gaze landed on Yin Xianfeng, his expression slowly turned cold as he stared at Wang Xian.

“It has been a long time since someone dared to cause trouble in the territory of our six elements sect!”

The middle-aged man looked at Wang Xian and spoke slowly.

“Hehe!”

Wang Xian stared at the middle-aged man who was floating in the air and sneered.

“Hua Hua Hua!”

At this moment, a group of disciples under the middle-aged elder of the six elements sect came to Wang Xian’s side. They surrounded him and locked onto him with a murderous aura.

Wang Xian’s expression did not change. He clenched his fists slightly.

He was not afraid of an expert at the first level of the Seethrough realm. He was so agitated that he fled after a round of slaughter.

Boom! Boom! Boom

“What happened?”

Just as the atmosphere froze and was about to explode at any moment, a slight tremor came from the ground in the distance.

The second Prince’s voice rang out.

“The second Prince Is Here!”

Everyone looked over. Even the people from the six element sect turned their heads over.

“Hiss, what’s that?”

“This... all of the second prince’s subordinates have mounts, and they are all powerful Black Shadow Leopards!”

“This...”. “There are four half-step void interpretation experts, and around ten transcendents at level 9. These people are stronger than the first prince and the eighth Prince’s subordinates, but the most terrifying thing is that the second prince actually got so many mounts. This almost doubled the second Prince’s power!”

“The black shadow leopard the second prince is riding is at half-step void interpretation. Hiss, is this the second Prince’s power? It is definitely the strongest among all the princes!”

When everyone saw the second prince riding the black shadow leopard and rushing over with his subordinates, they all sucked in a breath of cold air.

They were extremely shocked by the second Prince’s power.

Even Xu Wenling’s face was full of shock.

“Prince Long Xiaotian!”

The six element sect’s elder who was floating in the sky landed on the ground and greeted the second prince.

“Second Prince!” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The rest of the people also stood up and shouted with flickering eyes.

“Huh? What’s going on?”

Long Xiaotian could feel the frozen atmosphere around him. He frowned and asked with a hint of killing intent.

“Second prince, this kid injured my arm and severely injured my junior brothers. Today, I want to keep him here!”

When Yin Xianfeng saw the second prince, his expression was still ferocious. He pointed at Wang Xian and shouted loudly.

“Oh? Brother Yin Xianfeng, who dares to...”

Long Xiaotian raised his eyebrows and looked over. However, when he was halfway through his sentence, he was stunned and looked at Wang Xian in astonishment.

In an instant, his expression changed. His body moved and he jumped down from the black shadow leopard. He quickly walked to Wang Xian’s side.

“Brother Wang Xian, are you alright? What Happened?”

He walked to Wang Xian’s side with a sullen face and asked hurriedly.

The second prince suddenly walked towards Wang Xian, causing everyone to be slightly stunned. They looked at this scene in astonishment.

“I’m fine. I have some enmity with them. They want to keep me here!”

When Wang Xian saw Long Xiaotian walking over, a smile appeared on his face.

“Keep me here?”

When Long Xiaotian heard Wang Xian’s words, his face turned cold instantly.

He wanted to keep Wang Xian here?

Moreover, it was happening in his banquet hall!

This made long Xiaotian extremely embarrassed.

Who Was Wang Xian? He was wind salt town’s savior, Long Xiaotian’s Lucky Star, and the thigh that he swore to hug.

Now, there was actually someone in his banquet hall who wanted to keep this thigh of his?
