Translator: 549690339

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

Terrifying energy raged. Around the altar, streams of terrifying energy attacked the two heaven origin creation realm experts of the belief universe.

That terrifying energy caused the surrounding chaotic energy to tremble.

“There are two or three control-level experts with deep foundations. We

Aren’t their opponents. Run! ”

When the waves of energy attacked them, the old man’s heart trembled again.

His expression was extremely ugly as he shouted in fear!

He did not understand why this was the case.

A small sword and magic universe, with only two existences that had just entered the Heavenly Kismet Realm.

He coveted this place and was already fully prepared.

In the end, there were suddenly so many powerful powerhouses who had entered the Heaven’s origin realm.

What was going on?

The old man and the middle-aged man fled directly in the direction of the Void Dragon.

According to his senses, that direction was the weakest and the easiest to break through.

However, when they flew toward the Void Dragon’s body.

This clone of Wang Xian let out a low roar. The dragon scales on his body released mirror-like fragments.

One by one, the space fragments charged towards them!

“Break through! ”

The old man let out a low roar. With a wave of his arm, a huge human-headed staff appeared in his hand.

He waved his staff forward. The human-headed staff released pure power of faith and attacked the space fragments!

Under their attacks, the densely packed space fragments shattered rapidly one by one.

They increased their speed and continued to fly forward.

However, in the next moment, they were met with waves of attack energy.

This caused their expressions to change slightly.

“Father, our position has been changed! ”

The expression of the middle-aged man who was in the Heaven’s origin realm changed slightly. Similarly, he held a human-headed staff in his hand and waved it forward.

When they were attacking Wang Xian’s space fragments earlier, their position had changed unknowingly.

This was the control of the Void Dragon’s body over space!

They flew forward. In fact, they were heading towards the back.

Wang Xian and the rest’s attacks had arrived in front of them. The terrifying attacks made their faces extremely ugly.

These streams of energy were not something they could withstand.

An existence at the level of the Great Dao could easily kill an existence at the level of control.

Wang Xian’s strength was comparable to the level of the Great Dao.

The middle-aged man beside the old man was only at the beginner level.

His strength was inferior to Lin Niu and was only on the same level as Liu Lan.

Even Tianci could easily destroy him.

Not to mention, there were Lin Niu, Liu Lan, and hopeless heaven around them.

It was a huge suppression.

“Father, what should we do? They are very strong. We are not their match at all!

The middle-aged man who was in the Heaven’s origin realm resisted the attacks of Wang Xian and the rest with great difficulty. He even took out a defensive trump card.

However, the moment he took out his trump card, it was directly destroyed.

This caused a look of horror and horror to appear on his face.

Ever since he broke through to the Heaven’s origin, this was the first time he had encountered such a terrifying powerhouse!

“Don’t be stingy with your trump card. Just Run Away! ”

The old man blocked the attacks from Wang Xian and the rest. His body was sent flying under the attacks as he roared loudly!

His body shook and a cloud formed from the power of faith appeared!

The cloud started to spread out at a terrifying speed.

His body merged directly into the cloud and his position could not be seen at all!

“HMPH, you want to escape? If I let you escape today, it would be too embarrassing! ”

Wang Xian snorted coldly when he saw this scene.

He flapped his incorporeal holy wings and extended his Dragon Claw!

An extremely huge dragon claw clawed at the cloud!

The Five Elements Millstone and the Tai Chi Dragon Plate followed the position of Wang Xian’s Dragon Claw and attacked!

Liu Lan, the Hopeless Heaven Kylin Bull, and the rest unleashed an area-of-effect attack that covered the entire cloud!

“Faith, Chant! ”

The elder who was in the clouds sensed the attacks from all directions and let out a low roar!

“Buzz Buzz Buzz! ”

“Buzz Buzz Buzz! ”

In the next instant, the whispers of the believers were heard continuously.

Waves of special energy attacks were transmitted into the ears of Wang Xian and the rest.

This voice was filled with bewitchment and temptation!

It caused Wang Xian and the rest to fall into a momentary daze!

Buzz

In just an instant, the branches of the soul-returning wood on the ancestral tree trembled and he regained his clarity!

By the time he regained his clarity, the huge cloud had already broken free from their blockade!

“Wind and thunder, show yourself!”

Wang Xian focused his gaze. The inoriginator holy wings burst out with a dazzling light of wind and thunder!

Amidst the clouds, two figures appeared with a striking light of wind and thunder!

God-striking! ”

Not far away, Tianci had also recovered. With a wave of his arm, the branches in his hand struck at the two figures!

“Father, save me!”

In an instant, a scream sounded out. Under the attack of the god-striking branches, the middle-aged heavenly Yuan creator’s body was rapidly torn apart!

It looked extremely miserable!

His life force was also quickly dissipating!

“Believers, bless! ”

The old man’s face was filled with fear as his body released an extremely dense power of faith.

The Shadows of countless believers appeared above him.

One by one, the believers prostrated on the ground and chanted softly.

Streams of power of faith enveloped their surroundings and protected them tightly!

At this moment, Wang Xian flew over instantly. The dragon horns emitted a glow and attacked their location!

“Crack! Crack! Crack!”

The light and dark energy swept past. The attack from the blessing of the Believers was instantly broken!

The old man spat out a large amount of blood instantly.

The Shadows of the believers in the sky fell one after another!

The moment the old man spat out blood, the body of the void God Dragon appeared in the old man’s hands.

A dragon claw slashed across the middle-aged man beside him.

“Father! ”

The middle-aged man roared. There was no time for him to dodge, so the Dragon Claw grabbed him and took him away!

The terrifying power of space consumed his life force.

The middle-aged man, who had been heavily injured by God’s will, was instantly killed!

“Damn it, who are you people? How dare you ruin the Good Thing of our belief universe?”

The Old Man’s face changed when he saw this scene, and he roared angrily!

“Hehe, since you dare to covet other universes, We Can’t Kill You? Die, Old

Wang Xian moved and appeared in front of the old man in an instant.

His dragon claws landed on the top of the old man’s head.

“Divine Dragon, you are the Divine Dragon of the nine-origin universe. I will remember all of you! ”

The old man stared at Wang Xian with blood-red eyes and roared loudly.

“Those who believe in me will live forever. Return to the Holy Church! ” The old man roared and a white black hole appeared on his body!

His entire body was instantly sucked away by the black hole!
