“Miss, Miss, I’ve prepared everything for you. Everything for the baby has been prepared. Will the baby be born today?”

“Miss, Miss, is there anything else I can do? Is there anything else I Can Do?” Water source, inside a courtyard of the Mu Li tribe!

The Mu Li tribe was located on the surface of the water. Below the surface of the water was a treasured land.

The entire Mu Li tribe was abnormally beautiful. The Raindrops in the sky continued to drip down.

Not far away, there was a rainbow adding color to it.

Voices came from a room inside!

A child was about to be born.

Outside the room, a middle-aged couple stood there. Listening to the voices in the room, there was not a trace of joy on their faces!

“Hmph, I didn’t expect that I, Mu Liqiao, would become the grandfather of an unknown bastard. How shameful! ”

The middle-aged man swept his gaze across the room and snorted coldly with a somewhat embarrassed expression!

“Alright, Alright. Yin ‘er is our daughter. She suddenly… Sigh, she wants this child. Then this child is the descendant of our family. ”

The woman beside him pulled his arm with a helpless expression!

Shameful, shameful! ”

The middle-aged man growled in a low voice with a face full of anger and helplessness!

As he spoke, his gaze swept across another room next to him.

“A man who was seriously injured suddenly appeared there. It has nothing to do with Yin c er, right?”

He asked in a deep voice.

“No, I’ve already checked. It was indeed Yin ‘er and the others who met him on the road, so I brought him here. When he wakes up, Pll get Xiao Ai to send him away so that there won’t be any rumors! ”

The woman nodded.

“That’s Good! ”

The middle-aged man nodded.

“Miss, the baby is born, the baby is born!”

“It’s a boy, it’s a cute boy!”

Along with the sound of crying, the sound of pleasant surprise followed.

In the courtyard, when the middle-aged couple heard the cry of the child, they immediately looked over!

“Rumble!”

“Rumble!”

However, in the next instant, a rumble suddenly sounded!

Along with the Rumble of Heaven and Earth, following that, a purple light, along with an extremely dense life force, suddenly lit up the entire sky!

No, not the entire sky!

But the entire universe!

The universe rumbled!

The Purple Qi and life energy filled the entire universe!

The Sky and Earth changed colors!

The sudden situation caused the middle aged couple in the courtyard to be stunned. They hurriedly raised their heads and looked up into the sky! The entire sky and earth was enveloped by the Purple Qi and life energy!

The rain seemed to contain a powerful energy!

All the living beings in the entire six paths universe felt a warmth enveloping their hearts!

“Heaven and Earth are changing, what is this? Why does it feel like a celebration?”

The middle-aged man stood in the courtyard, looking at the sky and feeling the changes in the entire universe. His face revealed a shocked expression as he muttered.

However, at this moment, the sky above the center of the six treasured lands of the six paths universe appeared.

In the palace, there were two other figures sitting there.

Suddenly, they raised their heads and looked up at the changes in the universe. Their faces were filled with shock.

“This is the universe celebrating the birth of a true treasure of heaven origin creation!”

“A true treasure of heaven origin creation has been born! It has really been born! What kind of true treasure of heaven origin creation is this? Where exactly is it located in our universe? ! ”

“It has really been born! We can’t let the other universes obtain the true treasures of our six paths universe!”

The two figures stood there, their eyes flashing with madness as they shouted loudly!

At the same time, they were located in various places in the six paths universe!

Ever since the news of the birth of the heavenly creation true treasure spread out.

The number of heavenly creation great beings who had come to the six paths universe had already reached 40 to 50!

They were all constantly searching for the heavenly creation true treasure.

However, there had been no news of heavenly creation true treasures for tens of millions of years.

The sudden changes in the six paths universe made all the great beings feel something.

This must be the birth of a heavenly creation true treasure.

“What kind of heavenly creation true treasure is this? Is it an attack type or something else? Hu, Hu, a true treasure has been born. We have to find it, we have to get it!”

“As expected, this universe has a heavenly creation true treasure born. If I can get a heavenly creation true treasure, my strength will be greatly increased, a huge increase. ”

“Quick, quickly find it. We must get it before all the other great beings find it! ”

“Heavenly creation true treasure!”

All the heavenly creation true treasures seemed to have gone crazy!

The value of a heavenly origin creation true treasure was unimaginable.

The nine-origin universe wasn’t weak, but the known heavenly origin creation Great Beings, apart from the universe ai that wasn’t completely controlled, were the Wizard Race’s heavenly origin creation true treasures.

The other great beings didn’t have a heavenly origin creation true treasure.

Even someone as strong as fallen Shadow Demon Emperor didn ‘t have a heavenly origin creation true treasure.

For the Heavenly Yuan creation true treasure of this universe, he didn’t hesitate to step inside and forcefully search for it.

This time, all the great beings were somewhat crazy.

Some heavenly yuan creation great beings of the universe were even prepared to let their subordinates enter the six paths universe.

If their subordinates entered, even if their strength was suppressed, as long as they could obtain a heavenly yuan creation true treasure, all the losses would be worth it!

The Heavenly Yuan creation masters of the six paths universe began to move.

The Heavenly Yuan creation masters from the outside were also frantically searching.

“Husband, what’s going on?”

In a courtyard of the Mu Li tribe, a woman asked the middle-aged man in shock.

(‘I don’t know either, but this doesn’t seem to be a bad thing! ” The middle-aged man shook his head. He didn’t know.

His strength was only at level five of the Universe Overlord realm.

He couldn’t sense what was going on.

“As long as it’s not a bad thing. Let’s go in and take a look at our daughter and the Child! ”

The woman nodded and said to the middle-aged man.

The middle-aged man scanned his surroundings and nodded as he walked into the house!

At the same time, in the room next door.

Wang Xian was lying on a bed.

His entire face was drained of blood and he looked extremely weak!

However, at this moment, he suddenly opened his eyes.

Although he was still extremely weak and could be killed easily, the luster in his eyes was abnormally bright.

He sensed it. He sensed an extremely holy and powerful energy.

This energy carried an unrivaled sharpness!

“This is?”

Wang Xian sat up slowly and looked to the right.

On the right was the wall. With Wang Xian’s current injuries, he couldn’t see through the wall.

However, at this moment, he seemed to be able to see through the wall. He could see that there was an extremely powerful treasure only 30 meters away from him.

There was a hint of familiarity in the aura!

“Heavenly Yuan Destiny Treasure! ”

He slowly spat out six words.

His gaze was burning as he added another three words.Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎
