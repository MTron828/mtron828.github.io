Chapter 1357: 1357 obtained a huge harvest

“Surrender, we surrender, don’t Kill Us!”

“I surrender, I’m willing to surrender, don’t kill me!”

Screams of terror resounded in the sky of the one leaf continent dynasty.

When the last insightful void martial artist of the dynasty died, everyone in the dynasty revealed expressions of despair.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

The members of the Dragon Palace stopped killing and stopped attacking. They let out a roar of victory.

The sound covered the entire imperial city of the one leaf continent.

“Enter the city!”

Prime Minister Gui revealed a smile when he saw this scene.

He moved and came to Wang Xian’s side.

“Yes!”

The group of members of the Dragon Palace came to Wang Xian’s back in unison.

“They... none of them seem to have died?”

At this moment, the soldiers of the one leaf mainland dynasty who were injured noticed a problem with a horrified expression.

That was, none of the forces that defeated their enemies and killed all the powerhouses of their dynasty had died.

Even those creatures below the insightful void tier didn’t die.

Their corpses were all around them.

This discovery made everyone from the one leaf continent dynasty widen their eyes. Their eyes were filled with fear!

After destroying them, the other party didn’t even expend a single soldier?

Just thinking about it made them feel a little terrified.

“Those who submit, kneel!”

Wang Xian sat upright on the dragon throne. His gaze swept across the empire that had been conquered.

Prime Minister Gui stood at the side. He looked down coldly at the citizens of the defeated Empire. His majestic voice covered the entire imperial city.

Those who submit, kneel!

These five words resounded in everyone’s mind. On the battlefield, the expressions of everyone from the one leaf dynasty changed drastically.

“Those who do not submit, die!”

From the back, Ao Qitian saw the hesitant expressions of the people from the one leaf dynasty.

He did not hesitate at all. The ocean pacifying needle in his hand turned into a few hundred meters wide and shot downwards.

“Ahhhh!”

Ao Qitian’s blow had killed at least four to five thousand people.

He suppressed everyone below with a ferocious expression.

He would not show any mercy to his enemies.

In this kind of war, there was no right or wrong, no justice or evil.

The Victor was the King!

The weak were ants!

“Plop!”

“Plop!”

With a swing of the club, everyone from the one leaf dynasty immediately knelt on the ground in fear.

After witnessing how terrifying AO Qitian was, the pride in their hearts vanished.

Now, they were captives, and they were losers!

“Oh my God, we’ve lost, we’ve lost!”

“They... are so terrifying, so terrifying...”

“Kneel down, quickly kneel down, or they will really kill us!”

In the city, the people of the one leaf dynasty were all kneeling on the ground in fear when they saw ao Qitian kill four to five thousand people in one move.

“Roar!”

The nine flood dragons roared and landed on the ground. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The members of the Dragon Palace also landed on the ground.

Around them, the hundreds of thousands of people who had not been killed kneeled on the ground and retreated!

“Open the city gate, quick, open the city gate!”

Some of the soldiers kneeling on the city wall saw this scene and immediately shouted in fear.

Crack! Crack! Crack

Soon after, the huge city gate slowly opened. On both sides of the city gate, the soldiers knelt there, not daring to move at all.

During the war just now, they had witnessed the horror and brutality of the Dragon Palace.

Now, how would they dare to resist?

The King was dead, and the strong were dead!

Their fate was already in the hands of the other party.

If the other party wanted them to live, they would live. If they were to die, they would die.

There was no room for resistance at all.

“Roar Roar!”

The nine flood dragons looked at the wide open city gates with satisfaction. They walked arrogantly and pulled the dragon throne towards the imperial city.

Wang Xian sat on the dragon chairs without any fluctuation.

Upon entering the city gates, both sides were filled with the citizens of the one leaf continent who were kneeling on the ground.

Sensing the violent aura coming from the nine flood dragons, demon monkey, and the rest, all of them trembled in fear.

The nine flood dragons continued to move forward. The citizens of the one leaf continent’s imperial city in the distance hurriedly knelt on the ground in fear when they saw them enter.

Tens of millions of people knelt on the ground in rows.

At this moment, Wang Xian was like their king.

When he arrived at the Dragon Palace of the imperial city and swept his gaze across the Magnificent Dragon Palace, a smile appeared on Wang Xian’s face.

“Next, it’s time to reap the rewards!”

He swept his gaze across everyone in the Dragon Palace indifferently. “I’m very satisfied with this battle!”

“Thank you, Dragon King, for your praise!”

The members of the Dragon Palace replied in a hurry with happy faces.

“Go and take back the spoils of war that belong to us!”

Wang Xian waved his hand and ordered the members of the Dragon Palace.

“All combat divisions head to the Imperial City separately and bring all the treasures in everyone’s household over!”

“Those who resist will be killed without mercy!”

Prime Minister Gui ordered all the members of the Dragon Palace.

“Yes!”

In an instant, all the members of the Dragon Palace moved.

Since they had taken down this dynasty, it was for the resources, the resources of the entire Imperial City, and the resources of the entire dynasty.

Regardless of whether the people of the imperial city agreed or not, they had no choice.

If the Dragon Palace did not have absolute strength, the Sky Island dynasty and the one leaf continent dynasty might join forces to occupy the deep sea spiritual spring.

As for the Dragon Palace, if they resisted, they would be waiting for their demise.

At this moment, it was not just the imperial city of the one-leaf Mainland dynasty.

In the entire dynasty and all the cities, the figures of the members of the Dragon Palace were wreaking havoc.

All the treasures and treasures belonged to the Dragon Palace.

“TSK tsk, this one-leaf mainland dynasty is indeed the best dynasty in the surrounding domain. There are so many items in the imperial treasury!”

Wang Xian came to the treasury and scanned his surroundings. His eyes lit up slightly.

As a dynasty that was five to six thousand years old, there were simply too many treasures in it.

There were hundreds of tons of void interpretation level materials alone!

What kind of concept was this? If it was given to a powerful artifact master, he could forge thousands of void interpretation weapons.

However, Artifact Masters were rare.

Other than the various materials, there were also many precious items.

Formations, strange weapons, various remnant secret arts, and even the training maps of some special battle teams!

“These items are all very valuable. I have to think of a way to sell them and exchange them for resources that can be used by the Dragon Palace!”

Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled. He picked up a few earth and water spirit pearls and handed them to the five elements millstone to devour.

“Dragon King, news from the other cities of the one leaf continent dynasty has been received. All of them have succeeded!”

“Dragon King, all the treasures in the imperial city have been searched into the interspatial ring!”

One by one, the information was sent over. One by one, the interspatial rings filled with treasures were sent over. Wang Xian revealed a satisfied expression on his face.

The value of these treasures was definitely worth tens of trillions of middle-grade spirit stones!

After that, the Dragon Palace would be able to receive a considerable upgrade!

In fact, if someone offended the dragon palace and destroyed a few more factions, he would be able to gather all the resources he needed to level up!
