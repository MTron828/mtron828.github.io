“You dare to interfere?” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The sudden intervention of the supreme elder of the Yuwen clan caused all the surrounding immortals and the powerhouses of the immortal sect to reveal shocked expressions.

However, a cold and dignified voice came out of Wang Xian’s mouth as he stared coldly in the direction of the Yuwen clan.

At the same time, the sudden burst of terrifying power caused the expressions of all the immortals to change drastically.

The number of immortal gods gathered here had already reached forty to fifty. They were all watching the battle in the air.

The sudden burst of power caused everyone’s bodies to tremble. Their eyes were filled with shock as they hurriedly looked towards the direction of the terrifying battlefield.

It was a woman whose entire body was emitting terrifying flames.

This flame was different from the other flames. It was even very different from the supreme elder of the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect.

The flame had the form of a bird and was somewhat similar to the legendary Vermillion Bird.

Around her body, a ten-meter-long vermillion bird rotated and emitted a terrifying might.

The Vermillion Bird seemed to be alive and was full of spirituality.

Just now, the middle-level immortal of the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect who had been fighting with it was instantly killed by this terrifying Vermillion Bird.

“CHIRP CHIRP!”

A phoenix cry sounded. Feng Luan took control of her body and looked in the direction of the Yuwen clan.

For a moment, the supreme elder of the Yuwen clan was completely stunned. He opened his mouth slightly and revealed an incredulous expression.

“Another high-level immortal!”

“The Dragon King’s wife is also a high-level immortal!”

Shocked voices came from the immortal God behind him. The face of the Yuwen clan’s first elder slowly turned ugly.

Looking at the two pairs of cold eyes staring at him, his face changed drastically.

“What?”

However, at this moment, all the immortal gods in the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect were completely in despair.

There was still one more. The Dragon Gate actually had a superior immortal. This... This completely extinguished all their vitality.

The Dragon Palace had two superior immortals and eighteen immortal gods. They were invincible in this world!

“Just... just forget it!”

The supreme elder of the Yuwen clan said with an embarrassed look on his face.

F * ck, the Dragon Palace, which had two high-level immortals and two high-level immortals, might not be able to defeat them even if he led all the immortals of the Yuwen clan to fight.

If the Dragon King came to destroy the Yuwen clan in the future because of his interference in this matter, they would be courting death!

“Eh...”

When the surrounding immortals heard the Yuwen clan’s Supreme Elder’s words, they were a little stunned and speechless.

Now, the Yuwen clan no longer had the right to interfere with the strength that the Dragon Palace had displayed.

If they interfered, they would be courting death.

With the Dragon Palace’s current strength, unless the Xuanyuan clan and the Yuwen clan interfered, it would be possible to stop this war.

“Today, whoever dares to interfere will be the enemy of the Dragon Palace. The Holy Doctor and Medicine Immortal sect will be annihilated by the Dragon Palace today!”

When Wang Xian saw the Yuwen clan’s supreme elder retract his words, he snorted coldly and shouted loudly.

When Bian Jiangtu saw this scene, his body couldn’t help but tremble.

“Help me kill him!”

At this moment, Wang Xian turned to look at Feng Luan and said to her.

“Alright!”

Feng Luan’s eyes sparkled as she stared at Wang Xian’s body.

This was the first time she saw Wang Xian in battle. It was the first time she saw him transform into a divine dragon.

On the transcendence continent, there was a dragon race that was the most powerful existence in the entire continent.

Even when she was at her peak, she didn’t dare to provoke such a terrifying race.

Moreover, she also knew that the Divine Dragon race was a race that was comparable to their vermilion bird race.

“CHIRP CHIRP!”

A phoenix cry sounded. Feng Luan’s figure moved and directly jumped into the center of the Vermilion Bird. With a flap of her wings, she directly became 20 meters in size.

“Hiss! Too strong! Today, the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect is completely finished!”

The surrounding immortal gods and other experts looked shocked when they saw the two terrifying creatures, Dragon and Phoenix, attacking the flat territory.

“Even if I die today, I will drag one of you down with me!”

Despair. Bian Jiang Tu was in complete despair when he saw this scene.

The Flames on his body dyed the entire sky red. The scene of the flames burning the sky could be seen within a radius of 100 kilometers.

Fight to the death.

Wang Xian and Feng Luan saw the aura emitted by Bian Jiang Tu. There was no expression on their faces. They moved and attacked instantly.

Dragon Roar! Phoenix Cry!

Roar! Roar!

Chirp! Chirp

Two terrifying flames were spat out from Wang Xian and Feng Luan’s mouths.

Flames versus flames!

Bian Jiangtu waved his arms and the terrifying fire pillars on his arms met the flames directly. He blocked the flames with a cold gaze.

Roar! Roar

At this moment, Wang Xian moved his body and flew toward Bian Jiangtu. He swung his sharp metal dragon claws forward.

“Volcanic descent!”

Bian Jiang Tu waved his arms with an embarrassed expression. In an instant, a terrifying flaming mountain formed in the sky.

The Flaming Mountain smashed towards Wang Xian rapidly.

“Phoenix Feather!”

Feng Luan shouted softly. With a flap of her wings, feathers flew towards the volcano.

The feathers rotated slowly. It was beautiful and looked like a flaming flower.

The Phoenix feathers landed at the bottom of the Flaming Mountain and entered it directly.

Boom

In an instant, the flaming mountain erupted into the surroundings.

Bian Jiangtu’s expression changed drastically as he looked at Wang Xian who was attacking him. His arm turned into a huge flaming arm in an instant.

The flaming red arm crossed in front of him to block his attack.

“A mantis trying to stop a chariot!”

Wang Xian’s eyes revealed a hint of disdain. His sharp metal dragon claws easily penetrated the flaming red palm and clawed at his body.

“Ah!”

His eyes were wide open. With a loud roar, the flames on his body were retracted into his body.

His entire body was like a lava stone that had existed for tens of thousands of years!

“Is it useful?”

Wang Xian’s eyes were like torches. A dazzling golden glow was emitted from the dragon claws. The terrifying golden glow penetrated the dragon claws and clawed towards his body.

Bian Jiangtu retreated backward with an embarrassed expression.

Crack! Crack

The Dragon Claw touched his arm and produced a cracking sound.

“Hiss!”

Instantly, Bian Jiang Tu’s forehead was filled with cold sweat. His entire arm fell downwards like a rock.

Boom

His arm landed on the ground. The area within a few thousand meters of the ground was charred black.

“Ahhhh!”

At this moment, screams of pain could be heard from the surroundings.

There was more than one scream.

An old man was pierced through the chest by a lightning spear.

A middle-aged man was entangled by a flood dragon.

A red-haired old man was hit by Ao Qitian’s ocean-pacifying divine needle and fell heavily to the ground.

An old woman was torn into two pieces by ao shrimp’s pincers.

All the surrounding immortals and gods looked at this scene with complicated and even fearful expressions.

“I’m not reconciled!”

Bian Jiangtu turned his head when he heard the screams. His eyes were instantly filled with blood and his face was filled with despair.

The experts of the Dragon Palace had killed the immortals and gods of the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect. Not a single one of them had died. They were not even seriously injured.

He regretted it so much!
