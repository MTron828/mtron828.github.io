“Let’s go, let’s have fun these two days. In a few days, there might be some danger outside!”

“What danger? Don’t tell me that the Dragon Gate still dares to block our immortal gate like they did with the Chaos Origin immortal sect? Haha, as long as they dare to come, we can directly kill them!”

“You can’t say that. Now that the Dragon Palace has appeared, we can’t underestimate the power of the Dragon King!”

“Coward, who cares about the Dragon Palace and the Dragon King? Since our immortal sect dares to make a move, we are not afraid at all. Haha, Let’s Go!”

“That’s right. Today, we can destroy the Dragon Gate forging workshop. Tomorrow, we can destroy the Dragon Gate. Humph, what Dragon King!”

At the gate of the Holy City of the Holy Medicine and Immortal sect, more than ten young men dressed luxuriously, holding fans in their hands, walked out like elegant scholars.

After the appearance of the immortal sect, these disciples of the immortal sect were very popular among those infatuated girls in the real world.

As long as they hooked their fingers, many beautiful girls would pounce on them. This made them very proud.

They didn’t care too much about the grudges between the two immortal sects and the Dragon sect. They had great confidence in their immortal sect.

The group walked out. At the city gate, besides them, there were many disciples of the immortal sect. Some went to the outside city to deal with matters, and some went out to play.

The Sun had just set. From the outside, one could see that the entire sacred city was bustling with activity. People were also coming and going at the city gate!

“Sword Slash!”

At this moment, a voice without any emotion suddenly came from the sky.

Then, without any warning, terrifying golden lights fell toward the ground.

In an instant, the three city gates of the sacred city shone like the setting sun.

Golden Sword Lights fell directly from the sky.

Each sword light was 1,000 meters long. When more than ten sword lights fell, the terrifying golden lights illuminated the sky.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

Soon, a terrifying explosion sounded.

“What?”

“What a terrifying attack!”

“Run, run!”

The disciples of the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect raised their heads and saw the terrifying sword rays. Their faces were filled with fear.

They roared in fear and wanted to escape into the city.

However, the sword rays were too fast. The disciples of the immortal sect who had not reached the infant realm were easily killed.

“It’s the Dragon Gate! It’s the people of the Dragon Gate!”

A sharp cry sounded from the south gate, and the terrified voice traveled far.

The sword light disappeared one after another, leaving more than ten gullies that were thousands of meters long.

In front of the three city gates, more than ten figures stood in the air. When they saw the corpses on the ground, they moved and disappeared.

“The people of the Dragon Gate are here for Revenge!”

From the position of the city gate, angry roars rang out in the sacred city.

The guards of the sacred city trembled and stared at the mess outside the city wall with an embarrassed expression.

In less than five seconds, the terrifying sword light directly split the road in front of their city gate.

All the disciples of the immortal sect at the city gate didn’t resist at all and became dead souls under the sword.

This made the disciples of the immortal sect who were about to leave the city look terrified.

“What a fast speed! We destroyed their forging workshop in the morning, and they came to take revenge on us in the afternoon, and they are so arrogant!”

“Damn the Dragon Gate! How dare they kill the Disciples of our immortal sect! Kill them!”

The disciples of the Holy Medicine and Holy Medicine Immortal sect looked gloomy. They didn’t expect the Dragon Gate to be so fast that they came to attack them in the afternoon.

And it was still so open, so arrogant!

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

At this moment, the immortal gods led the elders and deacons of the Holy Medicine and Holy Medicine Immortal sect and flew toward the city gate.

When they saw the terrifying sword lights and corpses outside the city, their expressions turned slightly ugly.

“I didn’t expect the Dragon Gate to counterattack so quickly!”

“They left immediately after our city gate attacked. It seems that they were afraid that we would rush over. Hehe, I thought that the Dragon Gate would be so brave and fearless!”

The immortals looked at the marks left by the attacks outside the city, and their eyes revealed a cold expression.

However, when they saw the dragon gate experts leave immediately after one attack, a cold expression appeared on their faces.

They didn’t dare to stay here, which meant that the Dragon Gate was afraid that their experts would come out.

“We have a formation in the city, so don’t worry. The Dragon Gate doesn’t dare to stay too long because they are afraid of us, so they only dare to attack and leave quickly. If that’s the case, then let’s have a cat-and-mouse fight!”

An immortal God looked at the corpses on the ground, his voice full of coldness!

“Sir, should we inform all the disciples to return to the city and forbid them from leaving the city?”

An elder asked in a deep voice.

“No need. Tell all the disciples to forbid them from leaving the city. Others might think that our Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal Sect is afraid of them. Today, we will set up an inescapable net at the city gate and wait for the Dragon Gate to come again. In addition, we will spread the word on the jianghu website that we will fight with the Dragon Gate to the end and see who will admit defeat first. Haha!”

“But from today onwards, all disciples can only leave through the East City Gate!”

An immortal God sneered and flew directly towards the immortal sect.

The Dragon Gate’s speed of revenge was so fast. Although it was beyond their expectations, they were not worried at all.

When everything was ready, it was not certain who would kill who! Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

At this moment, the city closest to the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect was Xia city.

Xia city was one of the larger and more prosperous cities in China. At the same time, it was also a city where the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect disciples were more active.

In the evening, the red lights and lush greenery of the city made the entire city seem like a white night.

At this time, a group of more than 30 Dragon Gate members stared coldly at the location below, sensing everyone below.

“Brother Fei, can you show me how to ride a flying sword?”

“Yes, Brother Fei, your sword is so handsome. Can I touch it?”

“Haha, Beauties, you might not know this, but I’m best at stick techniques. Do You Want Me to show you tonight?”

“How Annoying...”

Beside a street, a few gorgeous women were standing beside a long-haired young man wearing the clothes of the Holy Doctor Immortal sect. They were laughing and playing.

That young man had a hint of arrogance on his face, and his eyes were filled with pride!

“Whoosh!”

“Bang!”

However, in the next moment, a demonic claw directly descended from the sky and instantly crushed his body.

“Ah!”

The screams of the women could be heard!

In the sky, the DRAKONIDS did not have the slightest bit of emotion as they coldly swept their gaze downwards.

Once they encountered the disciples of the Holy Medicine Immortal sect, they would all be killed.

However, this was only the beginning!
