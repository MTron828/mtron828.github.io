Chapter 955: 0956, someone was courting death

“Leader Wang, let’s follow them from a distance. It’s safer this way!”

When Father Zhou heard the taunts from the mercenary group in front of him, he revealed an embarrassed expression and said to Wang Xian.

“Sure, follow them from two to three kilometers away!”

Wang Xian nodded his head nonchalantly.

“Alright, Alright. We’ll be relying on you guys from now on!”

Father Zhou nodded his head solemnly.

“Commander Wang, we’ll have to trouble you guys for the rest of the journey. Our lives are in your hands now!”

Jin Liuyan walked over with a smile on her face and said to Wang Xian.

“Don’t worry. I’ll guarantee that you guys will arrive at Donghai City safely!”

Wang Xian said with a smile on his face.

“Alright then. When we arrive at Donghai City, we will treat commander Wang to a meal. Commander Wang, please take good care of us in the future!”

Jin Liuyan said with a smile.

“I am not familiar with the people and places in Donghai City. Please take good care of me when the time comes!”

Wang Xian joked with them.

After spending two days together, they were joking like normal friends.

“Quack, Quack!”

The Carrion Crows in the sky came from afar. Father Zhou took a look and the carrion crows continued to move forward with the caravan.

They stopped about a thousand meters in front of them. It was obvious that they were feeding the carrion carcasses.

“Commander Wang, they should be far away. Let’s set off too!”

Five minutes later, Father Zhou said to Wang Xian.

“Alright, let’s Go!”

Wang Xian nodded. The 21 ao demons immediately spread out within a 1,000-meter radius.

Any creature within a 1,000-meter radius would be discovered immediately.

Even if there were creatures hiding in the swamp, they would still be discovered.

After four hours of smooth sailing, the sky gradually turned dark.

After four hours of smooth driving, Father Zhou and the others let out a sigh of relief.

“We are two to three kilometers behind the caravan. Most of the fierce beasts have been disposed of by them, so it’s relatively safer!”

He said with a smile.

“Dad, I got a great deal by hiring the Immortal Phoenix mercenary group this time!”

Zhou Hanhan said proudly.

As the sky turned dark, their speed also decreased.

At this moment, at a distance of two to three kilometers, more than 30 mercenary groups were fighting with the Imperial Croc.

Among the five Imperial Crocs, the largest one was 15 meters in size, exuding a fierce aura.

Beside it, there was a part of the corpse of a wildebeest.

A transcendent level 6 Imperial Croc suddenly attacked, causing the mercenary group at the front to lose a wildebeest without noticing it.

If it wasn’t for vice leader Ling, the loss would have been even greater.

“Those people from the Zhou Chamber of Commerce are really smart. They followed two to three thousand meters behind us. We opened a safe path for them along the way!”

The person in charge of the Chamber of Commerce who was at the back turned his head to look behind with an embarrassed expression. He then turned his head to look at the mercenary group that was fighting alligator.

“Yes, supervisor. Maybe those guys are safer than us!”

A middle-aged man said angrily.

“Humph!”

The supervisor of the Chamber of Commerce rolled his eyes and moved toward the center of the group.

“Supervisor Du, elder Xiao, we are risking our lives on the road ahead, but those guys from the Zhou Chamber of Commerce don’t need to worry about any danger. This is equivalent to us opening a path for them!”

The middle-aged supervisor of the Chamber of Commerce walked over and said in a very loud voice.

“Huh?”

Seeing the middle-aged man walk over and say what he said, supervisor Du and elder Xiao raised their eyebrows.

“Yeah, we are risking our lives to clear the road ahead, but they are just sitting back and enjoying the fruits of our labor!”

“F * ck, the Zhou Chamber of Commerce must have thought of such a situation, so they dare to separate from us!”

A few people in charge of the Chamber of Commerce who were relatively close to them agreed with a sullen expression.

“Then what do you guys think we should do?”

Supervisor du and elder Xiao looked at each other, raised their eyebrows, and asked.

“I think, should we...”

As the middle-aged supervisor of the Chamber of Commerce said this, a very hot expression appeared on his face. He touched his neck and said, “They have so many fierce beast corpses, why don’t we...”

When the surrounding managers saw his hand gesture, their eyes sparkled. They looked at manager Du and elder Xiao with interest.

“We are a chamber of Commerce, not thieves. Although this Zhou Chamber of Commerce is immoral, we can’t do this. Let’s not talk about this anymore!”

Elder Xiao’s expression turned serious as he spoke to the manager.

“That’s right. Elder Xiao is right. Our Chambers of commerce must help each other. Although the Zhou Chamber of Commerce does not know what is good for them, we can not do such an unrighteous thing. Forget it!”

Head of the Chamber of Commerce said with a righteous expression.

The face of the head of the Chamber of Commerce changed slightly as a trace of admiration surfaced in his heart. “Head of the Chamber of Commerce, elder Xiao, I have learned my lesson. I have indeed become a little greedy!”

“Supervisor du and elder Xiao are really magnanimous. Together with the Green Vine Chamber of Commerce and the Xiao Chamber of Commerce, they’ve also made us feel much more at ease!”

“Yeah, even I was greedy just now. Supervisor du and elder Xiao are still the righteous ones. No wonder the Chamber of Commerce is stronger than us!”

The people in charge of the surrounding chambers of commerce hurriedly flattered them. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

The two of them smiled faintly. “However, we can’t just be a wedding dress. Just now, they weren’t willing to sacrifice that little bit of spirit stones. Now that they’re asking us to open a path for them, I feel uncomfortable too!”

“Vice Commander Ling, when we kill the Emperor Crocs, it’s best to leave one or two for them to try!”

The two of them continued with a smile.

“We agree on this point. Leave a few Emperor Crocs for them instead of killing them!”

“That’s right. We can’t let them enjoy the fruits of their labor. I support supervisor Du and elder Xiao’s actions!”

“I also support not doing what we shouldn’t do, but we can’t be at a disadvantage either!”

Everyone looked at supervisor du and elder Xiao in admiration.

Hehe, if they agreed to let you destroy the Zhou Chamber of Commerce, then they would definitely give a portion of the items they obtained to you. Now, Hehe...

The two of them looked at each other, their eyes filled with cunningness!

Justice? Righteousness?

In the face of benefits, what kind of thing was this?

“Leave them two transcendent level 5 Imperial Crocs to play with them!”

Vice Commander Ling’s lips curled up slightly. He waved his arm and directly hit the imperial crocodiles on the head.

The powerful force made his head feel dizzy. He wanted to recover for at least five to six minutes.

“Leave them two gifts!”

“Two transcendent level 5 imperial crocodiles. The other party might be eaten directly!”

“It’s a bit of a waste, but it’s very satisfying. There’s no way we can sit back and enjoy the fruits of our labor!”

The group of mercenaries laughed out loud.

The caravan continued to move forward. In the swamp at the side, two alligators were lying on the ground with their heads slightly shaking!

The people from the Chamber of Commerce were not good people!

Wang Xian’s carriage followed behind. When they came to the side of the two alligators, a golden swordfish in front immediately waved his hand.

“What’s Wrong?”

Seeing the gesture of a golden swordfish in front, the carriage stopped immediately. Father Zhou’s expression changed slightly. “What’s going on?”

“There’s a ferocious beast!”
