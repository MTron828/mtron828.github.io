Chapter 1572: In 1572, a girl was growing up

“Sir Sage, your highness, there’s someone outside who wants to see you!”

Four days later, in the morning, a maid came to the courtyard and reported to Wang Xian and Ling Jian ‘ER.

“Who is it?”

Ling Jian ‘ER looked at the maid and asked.

“They are here to look for Sir Sage. They want him to help them expel the dark soul from their bodies. They said that they will pay a high price!”

The maid replied.

“Huh? Wang Xian, it’s for You!”

Ling Jian ‘er looked at Wang Xian and said.

“Tell them to look for me at night. They don’t have time during the day!”

Wang Xian smiled at Ling Jian ‘ER and said to the maid.

“Why don’t you have time during the day?”

Ling Jian ‘er looked at him and said.

“Of course, it’s to accompany our beautiful Jian ‘er!”

Wang Xian said with a smile.

“Nonsense again!”

Ling Jian ‘er rolled her eyes at him. “Aren’t you fast at treating them? You can treat them here!”

“It’s alright. I have time at night too. I Can’t let others disturb our private time!”

Wang Xian took a sip of the tea on the table and said with a smile.

“It’s alright. I still want to see how you treat others!”

“Last night, the emperor came to me and asked if you could help an elder of the Bingxin Empire expel the dark soul in his body!”

Ling Jian ‘er said to Wang Xian.

“Oh? is that so? Then tell the king of bingxin that I will definitely do my best!”

Wang Xian said with a smile.

The king of Bingxin was very good at doing things. Even if he were to treat the elders of the Bingxin Empire for free, it wouldn’t be a big deal.

“Alright, I will inform the Emperor!”

Ling Jian ‘er nodded her head.

Now, she was, after all, a member of the Bingxin Empire. She was also the disciple of the Patriarch of the Bingxin Empire and the adopted daughter of the emperor.

“Let them in!”

Wang Xian said directly to the maidservant.

“It’s the SAGE!”

The maidservant nodded her head and walked out.

“The SAGE!”

Soon, many middle-aged elders walked over. They looked at Wang Xian and cupped their hands respectfully.

Wang Xian’s gaze swept past them and landed on an elder beside him.

The elder was extremely weak and exuded a deathly stillness.

Clearly, he had been invaded by the soul of darkness for a long time.

“He has the strength of a seventh level void interpretation. As long as the reward is sufficient, I can expel the soul of darkness from his body!”

Wang Xian said directly.

“Sir Sage, do you think these rewards are feasible?”

An elder threw an interspatial ring over and said to Wang Xian.

“I still have a hairpin of the sixth level of the void interpretation realm here. Hehe, I’ll give it to this lady!”

A middle-aged man hesitated for a moment before taking out a golden hairpin. He walked to Ling Jian ‘ER’s side and said with a smile.

“Hehe, alright. You guys wait outside. I’ll be able to get rid of the dark soul in his body very soon!”

Wang Xian laughed out loud and said directly to them.

“Yes, yes. Thank you, Sage. Thank you!”

The group of middle-aged elders nodded their heads excitedly and waited outside.

“This is for you!”

Ling Jian ‘er looked at the hairpin in her hand and quickly placed it beside Wang Xian.

“Why are you giving it to me? I don’t carry a girl’s hairpin. You can take it!”

Wang Xian smiled and waved his arm. The hairpin was inserted directly into her hair.

“HMPH!”

This made Ling Jian ‘er snort softly. However, her eyes were filled with joy.

Clearly, she looked like a young girl in love.

At this moment, the luminous dragon bead flew out from Wang Xian’s body and enveloped the old man.

Wang Xian had already received the bunch of luminous pearls sent by the Wuji Empire and had them absorbed by the luminous dragon bead.

Before long, the luminous dragon pearl would be able to evolve to the eighth level of the Seethrough realm.

The Darkness Soul in the old man’s body was only at the sixth level of the Seethrough realm. With his strength, he could easily get rid of it.

Very soon, the old man, who was filled with the aura of death, regained a lot of his vitality.

“Thank you, Sage. Thank you!”

The old man sensed the rich vitality in his body and revealed an excited expression. He quickly sensed it.

“There’s no need. I’ve already received the reward. Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian said with a smile.

“You’re really amazing!”

Ling Jian ‘ER’s eyes sparkled when she saw Wang Xian heal a person with a wave of his hand. She said with a smile.

“Haha, of course!”

Wang Xian laughed out loud as he patted his chest. Ling Jian ‘er rolled her eyes at him.

Not long after, a few more groups of people came to seek the removal of the dark soul in his body.

Wang Xian easily healed it and received a lot of rewards.

“It seems that many people know that I can remove the soul of darkness. There will probably be more people coming in the next few days!”

“Give it to Jian ‘er. This is a spiritual herb of the sixth level of the void interpretation realm. It has a metal attribute and is very beneficial to your cultivation!”

In the evening, Wang Xian looked at the spiritual herb beside him and passed it to Ling Jian ‘ER.

“I... I don’t want it. You’ve already given me a lot of things!”

Ling Jian ‘er shook her head and turned her back to him.

“What’s mine is yours. Take it if you want it!”

Wang Xian smiled and placed the spiritual herb directly on her head. He smiled and said, “HMM, not bad. It’s pretty!”

“You’re looking for a beating...”

Ling Jian ‘er quickly took it off and glared at him.

“Haha, What’s Wrong, Jian ‘er? Did priest Wang make you unhappy?”

At this moment, King Bingxin’s loud laughter came from outside.

Ling Jian ‘ER’s face was slightly red. She hurriedly stood up and looked towards the door. “Your Majesty!”

“Haha, Alright, Jian ‘er, you sit. Priest Wang, sorry to disturb you!”

King bingxin smiled and waved at Ling Jian ‘er.

Bing jinghuan, who was beside him, clenched his fists tightly when he saw Ling Jian ‘ER’s slightly red and alluring face.

“I Won’t Disturb You!”

Wang Xian smiled and shook his head. His gaze swept across an old man beside King bingxin. “King bingxin, does this senior need some treatment?”

“Priest Wang is really smart. I wonder if priest Wang is confident!”

King bingxin’s eyes were burning with passion as he asked hurriedly.

The old man was also looking at Wang Xian with excitement.

“This senior’s situation is similar to that of Wuqing City. We can resolve it now!”

Wang Xian smiled and said directly.

“Then I shall trouble you, priest Wang. Thank you so much. Our patriarch has been invaded by the darkness. Although he didn’t lose his mind, he has been suppressing it in his body and his strength has been greatly reduced!”

“If pastor Wang Can Cure Him, our Bingxin Empire will be eternally grateful!”

The king of Bingxin said excitedly.

“You don’t have to be so polite!”

Wang Xian shook his head and walked to the side of the old man immediately. He began to remove the darkness soul in his body.

“Thank you, Little Brother!”

The old man nodded at Wang Xian with a smile on his face. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“You’re welcome!”

To Wang Xian, dealing with the soul of darkness at the seventh level of the void interpretation realm was very easy.

In less than two minutes, it was easily eliminated.

This caused the king of bingxin to be endlessly grateful.

Wang Xian did not charge him any fees and chatted for a while with a smile.

On the other hand, the old man from the Bingxin Empire went back to cultivate excitedly to recover his strength.
