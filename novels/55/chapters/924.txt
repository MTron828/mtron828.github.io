“The Ultimate Elixir. It is a very precious elixir that can be consumed by even extraordinary fourth or fifth level cultivators. After consuming it, one’s strength can be greatly increased, causing one’s mind to sink into a state of emptiness. One’s comprehension of supernatural powers will be increased by tens of times!”

The woman explained with a smile when she saw Wang Xian’s astonished expression.

Wang Xian nodded his head slowly. He stretched out his hand and took the gift. He smiled and said, “I’ll accept the gift. I’ll Help You Solve Fengxian’s predicament in Shenghai Town!”

The woman and shopkeeper Liu were stunned for a moment. Then, they smiled and said, “We will take our time to solve the problem in Shenghai town. Since leader Wang has treated Fengxian so well, we will naturally repay him!”

“I need to take some pills to rest first. After this battle is over, we can get together!”

Wang Xian spoke to the two of them and found a place with fewer people.

The woman and shopkeeper Liu nodded and watched Wang Xian’s figure leave.

“I feel that Commander Wang is very familiar with us, Fengxian. His actions give us the feeling that we are his own people!”

Shopkeeper Liu looked at Wang Xian’s figure in deep thought and said to the woman.

“There is one kind. If it were someone else who received our pills, they would definitely be filled with excitement or fear. However, he is just a little surprised. I wonder which one of us, Fengxian, has a relationship with this young man. Moreover, this relationship is not simple!”

The woman nodded slowly.

“Ding! Consume the spiritual pill and extract 8800 Dragon Crystals!”

“Ding! Host’s level has increased. You have reached transcendent level 4!”

“Ding! Host’s level has increased. Your supernatural ability, burning river and boiling sea, has been upgraded to the flame of the Fire Dragon!”

At the side, Wang Xian, who had consumed the transcendent level 7 pill, had his level increased immediately.

A transcendent level 7 pill and a pill that was worth tens of millions of middle-grade spiritual stones had directly increased his level by 8800 dragon crystals.

Wang Xian had a thought.

“I’ve leveled up. The Burning River and boiling sea has turned into the flame of the Fire Dragon. I wonder how powerful it is?”

Wang Xian looked at his attributes and smiled. He did not understand the supernatural powers of the light and dark attributes. He did not know if it was because he did not fuse with the heart of light and dark or some other reason.

However, this was sufficient.

With an increase in level, Wang Xian’s strength would definitely undergo an earth-shattering change.

In the third wave of the city defense battle, he would be able to kill even more ferocious beasts.

“After this city defense battle, the strength of the Dragon Palace will definitely experience a crazy increase!”

Wang Xian was full of confidence.

The corpses of the ferocious beasts that he had killed were absorbed by the Dragon Pool and turned into dragon blood. This would allow a large number of members of the Dragon Palace to increase their levels.

“The third wave of monster siege begins!”

At this moment, Jin Qianyuan’s voice sounded from the city wall again, “The third wave of beasts, black-horned seahorses, has the lowest level of transcendent-level rank-2 and many of them are at rank-3. There are more than 100,000 of them!”

“Flying-thorn Sea Beasts, the lowest level of transcendent-level rank-3 sea beasts. There are about 5,000 of them!”

“Mission, begin!”

“It’s starting, the last wave!”

“Oh my God, there are about 5,000 flying thorn sea beasts. If we leave the city, it will be too dangerous!”

“There shouldn’t be more than 50 mercenary groups that can accept this mission.”

“The third wave will have city guards leaving the city to fight. Moreover, there should be a level 8 extraordinary ferocious beast this time. The mayor should also make a move!”

Sounds of discussion could be heard from the surroundings.

Everyone flew towards the city wall to prepare for the battle.

Meanwhile, the 500 guards of Shenghai Town flew out. They were fully armed and the weakest among them was at supernatural level 3.

This was the strongest force of the guards in Shenghai Town.

Wang Xian accepted the mission without any hesitation.

A one-star diamond mission was equivalent to more than ten five-star gold missions. As long as he completed this mission, the Celestial Phoenix mercenary group would be able to advance to the gold level.

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian led ao Jian and the rest to the outside of the city and looked ahead.

Five Hundred City Guards were floating in the sky. Their main focus was to deal with the flying sea beasts.

Standing at the front was the mayor, Jin Qianyuan.

The strength of the Holy Sea Town alone was not enough to deal with so many ferocious beasts.

“Fight!”

On the city wall, there were more city-guarding weapons and huge war machines. There were a total of 100 heaven-piercing arrows that were four to five meters long.

These heaven-piercing arrows could penetrate the defense of a transcendent-level rank 5 beast. It required dozens of transcendent-level rank 2 experts to pull them apart.

“Kill!”

This time, there were only 40 to 50 mercenary groups that accepted the mission. They did not charge forward directly. Instead, they waited for the arrival of the beast below the city wall.

With their strength, they were not strong enough to charge forward.

As long as they could guard the city wall, it was enough.

Black-horned seahorses were similar to seahorses. They had two legs and a huge black horn.

The black-horned seahorses emitted a terrifying black light and looked extremely tough.

With two legs, their speed was extremely terrifying.

Their bodies were wrapped in a layer of black keratin. They ran towards holy sea town in an orderly manner.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom

The ground began to tremble. The powerful aura caused many people’s faces to turn extremely pale.

“Die! Die! Die!”

On the city wall, a few mighty figures flew into the sky. One by one, their supernatural abilities smashed downwards. In an instant, the charging momentum of the black-horned seahorse was greatly reduced.

“Flame of the Fire Dragon!”

Wang Xian let out a low roar. Flames that were 1,000 meters high instantly rose from his body. He was like a powerful god of fire.

“Haha, not bad. The flame of the fire dragon is not a one-time aoe spell. Instead, it is attached to the surroundings of the body. It can last for a very long time!”

Wang Xian was very satisfied. He clenched his hand and a fire sword appeared in his hand. Instantly, he charged forward.

The third wave of the monster siege began!

The slaughter began!

Wang Xian wanted to make use of this defense to accumulate sufficient resources for the Dragon Palace.

“As expected, that kid has been hiding his strength just now!”

Dao Hen, who was not far away, swept his gaze over. One of his single eyes revealed a cold expression!
