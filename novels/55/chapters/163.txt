Chapter 164: The Price Of Getting Off The Car

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

Seeing the group of people following, Wei Qingguo had a ghastly expression.

If I let my relatives and friends witness the bride arriving in a wedding car that costs a few hundred thousand, wouldn’t that be embarrassing?

What will this tell them about us?

They probably will say we are mean to let the bride sit in such a car!

The middle-aged woman looked disgruntled.

However, she couldn’t possibly send them back after seeing their enthusiastic looks. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

This had made her look even more disgruntled.

“She really knows how to cause us trouble!”

Wei Qingguo mumbled softly as he headed down with a grumpy face.

“Director Wei, why didn’t you ask the photographer along? There should be video coverage for receiving the bride, right?”

As the group of more than a dozen people walked out of the lift, one middle-aged man asked this.

“It’s fine. We like to keep this process simple. The two kids have already taken lots of wedding photos and videos as records.”

Wei Qingguo squeezed out a faint smile.

“In that case, let our groom be at the front to receive the beautiful bride and the parents behind him to welcome their daughter-in-law!” a middle-aged man joked loudly.

“Let’s go!” the crowd behind him seconded. No one had noticed the looks on Wei Qingguo or the middle-aged woman.

On the other hand, Wei Zhiwen was wearing a faint smile as he walked out.

“Where are the wedding cars?”

When the crowd arrived at the lobby, Wei Qingguo looked around. He instinctively skipped the luxurious cars as he looked around him.

“Hmm? Where are they?”

The middle-aged woman also looked around. Her face darkened as she commented, “Don’t tell me they are only coming in two or three cars!”

“What a huge line-up of wedding cars ahead. Wow. Rolls-Royce and sports cars! Isn’t that a little too extravagant?”

“Oh my gosh! Take a look at those car plates. Which influential person of Rivertown do these belong to? What a grand line-up!”

“I haven’t heard of any wealthy man in Rivertown getting married today!”

At this moment, doubts sounded from the crowd of relatives and friends.

Wei Qingguo and the middle-aged woman also saw the luxurious wedding car line-up. However, they did not believe they were from Xiao Li’s family.

They knew clearly about their daughter-in-law’s family.

The crowd also didn’t believe that these luxury cars belonged to the Wei Family.

They knew the Wei Family well. Although they were rich, they still couldn’t afford a wedding car line-up that cost $300 million.

“Son, give them a call!”

The middle-aged woman heard the exclamations of the surrounding relatives.

If the wedding cars that arrive in a while cost just a few hundred thousand, it would be really embarrassing in comparison with the luxury cars ahead.

The middle-aged woman and Wei Qingguo weren’t looking pleased.

When the phone call got through, it was Uncle Zhang who answered the call.

“We are right ahead of you guys! Can’t you see us?”

Wei Zhiwen, who was making the call, was instantly shocked as he looked ahead.

There was indeed a familiar face standing in front of the Rolls-Royce.

“Father-in-law, these cars...”

“Come over!” Uncle Zhang said impatiently before passing the phone to his daughter in the car.

“Dad, mom, they are right there. Let’s go over!”

Wei Zhiwen pointed to the cars ahead and led the group over.

“Where?” The middle-aged woman looked in the direction her son pointed and followed behind her son.

“There!” Wei Zhiwen pointed his finger again.

Wei Qingguo and the middle-aged woman looked over and saw two familiar figures standing beside the Rolls-Royce.

They were the parents of the bride.

“Why are they standing...”

Wei Qingguo and the middle-aged woman were shocked.

When they got closer to the wedding cars, they started seeing other familiar faces. At this moment, they couldn’t help but be surprised.

They knew clearly about the bride’s family and were extremely dissatisfied about it.

They were from a village.

However, they were in a Rolls-Royce luxury car right now and were surrounded by several dozens of other luxury cars.

Even the Wei Family couldn’t afford such a grand line up.

“What the... It can’t be! Look at those luxury cars from the bride’s family and those car plates. Aren’t those the cars of the Ren Family’s Head?”

“And those cars right there. Aren’t those the cars of several other wealthy men in Rivertown? Why are they all being used as wedding cars?”

“Isn’t the bride from the village? The Wei Family wouldn’t be able to afford such a luxurious line up of wedding cars too!”

The crowd of relatives and friends were commenting and felt disbelief.

Wei Qingguo and the middle-aged woman were also stunned by what they saw.

Their daughter-in-law was indeed sitting in the luxury car.

“It’s really hard to get you here!”

When Uncle Zhang saw them walking over, he remarked mockingly.

“Father-in-law!”

When Wei Zhiwen heard Uncle Zhang, he greeted with embarrassment before looking towards Sister Li.

Wei Qingguo and his wife asked, “You...How did you guys get so many luxury cars as wedding cars?”

“What? I can’t get other cars to send my daughter over just because you are not willing to fetch her?” Uncle Zhang replied angrily.

“Huh?”

Uncle Zhang’s word surprised the crowd behind the Wei Qingguo’s couple. They looked towards Wei Qingguo and his wife curiously.

It seemed that they weren’t very pleased about it.

Moreover, the Wei Family seemed to have not sent wedding cars to fetch the bride.

“Alright, let’s talk after we get in. Let’s go upstairs. We have a number of guests waiting!”

When Wei Qingguo heard Uncle Zhang, he quickly diverted the topic out of embarrassment. Those that had come along with him were all his relatives and friends. He didn’t want to lose his composure here.

“Xiao Li, let’s get up together!” Wei Zhiwen said to Sister Li, who was in the car.

“Wait a minute, brother-in-law. We had a hard time sending Sister Li over. How can she just go up with you? You’ve got to at least give her a red packet to get her off the car. These are the rules and customs!”

Wang Xian placed his hand on the car door as he smiled and spoke to Wei Zhiwen.

Uncle Zhang looked at the Wei Family’s reaction before turning to Wang Xian. He stood aside and didn’t say a word.

“Red packet?”

Wei Qingguo and his wife were slightly shocked and Wei Zhiwen frowned.

They had not prepared any red packet!

However, giving a red packet to get the bride off the wedding car was also a customary thing to do. The amount wasn’t the crux of the issue.

“You guys must have gone crazy from thinking about money!” the middle-aged woman grumbled softly. However, Wang Xian, who was closest to her, could hear her perfectly.

“Xiao Li, let’s not kick up a fuss. Will you just get off the car? The wedding is about to start. We can’t afford to miss the auspicious hour!” Wei Zhiwen said quickly.

“Hehe.”

Wang Xian looked at the Wei Family’s couple and revealed a cold smirk.

At this moment, a mocking voice came from the back of the crowd.

“Aiyo, a wedding should be lively. Can it be that the Wei Family didn’t even prepare a red packet? How can you guys not show even this level of sincerity?”

It was from Miao Zhiwei and the group.

They could now tell that Young Master Wang had invited them over to support him and mess with the Wei Family.

Any one of the six of them could severely damage Wei Family’s business. Any two or three of them together could make the Wei Family bankrupt!
