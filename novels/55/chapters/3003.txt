Chapter 3004: treasure hunt

Simple, vast, and magnificent!

When Wang Xian and the rest stood on the 18 continents of the Mohan clan and looked at this world, they were slightly shocked.

The entire continent was tens to thousands of times the size of the Dragon Island where the Dragon Palace was located at present. There were all kinds of buildings on it.

Unfortunately, 99% of the buildings were already rotten.

Only a few buildings made of special materials were still standing.

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly and sized up this piece of land!

“This is too big. It will probably take a long time to search the entire continent!”

Ba Qi looked around and exclaimed slightly.

“There isn’t much spiritual energy fluctuation on this continent. I wonder if there are many treasures!”

Tian Chen frowned slightly and said.

“Let’s look around. After all, this is just a ruin!”

Wang Xian shook his head and said.

With a move of his palm, an ant with long tentacles appeared in his palm.

Treasure-seeking ant was a treasure that Wang Xian had obtained from the system in the boundless galaxy.

Treasure-seeking ants were divine beasts of the Zerg race that were used to search for various resources. They didn’t have any combat strength, but they were very useful to the Zerg race.

Wang Xian had been feeding it in the Dragon Palace and had not used it for a long time. It was a good place to put it to use.

“Let’s go and investigate. We might find something unexpected!”

Wang Xian said with a smile and placed the treasure-seeking ant on his shoulder.

“Search for treasures above the level of celestial thearch!”

He gave an order to the treasure-seeking ant.

“Squeak Squeak!”

A special sound came from the mouth of the treasure-seeking ant. Its two tentacles were glowing.

Wang Xian moved his body and immediately flew on the continent.

However, after flying for ten minutes, there was no movement from the treasure-seeking ant. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

This made Wang Xian frown slightly. He continued to fly forward.

After flying for more than two hours, there were some fluctuations in the tentacles of the treasure-seeking ant.

“I have found a level three wizard artifact of the Celestial Emperor!”

Located in a blessed land, the treasure-seeking ant transmitted the information to Wang Xian.

This caused him to reveal a smile. Following the direction the treasure-seeking ant pointed to, he immediately flew towards that direction.

After entering a building filled with dust, Wang Xian waved his arm and the dust dissipated. His gaze landed on a divine artifact hanging on the wall.

It was a shaman weapon, a suspended pen.

It was similar to the pens used by the disciples of Celestial Emperor Hong Tian whom Wang Xian had killed not long ago.

“Dragon King, this is a formation-drawing pen. It’s a shaman weapon exclusive to the ink and Han clan!”

Tian Cheng walked over and held the formation-drawing pen in his hand. He said with a smile on his face.

“I found a pen after searching for a few hours. There are really few treasures here!”

Ba Qi said with slight dissatisfaction.

“That’s enough. It’s so easy to find a level-three godly emperor wizard weapon. Even a universe knight wouldn’t waste such a small amount of time!”

“Besides, the Mohan clan was exterminated. Most of the battle items and treasures have been used!”

Tian Chen said with a smile.

“Let’s continue searching. If we’re lucky, we might be able to obtain some high-value treasures!”

Wang Xian was rather satisfied with his harvest over the past few hours. He continued to search the surroundings.

“I’ve found a level one divine emperor metal material!”

“I’ve found a large number of divine stones!”

“I’ve found a level four divine emperor magic tool!”

“I’ve found a level two divine emperor medicinal pill jade bottle!”

“I’ve found a level-six celestial thearch material!”

As they continued to fly on the continent, they found some treasures from time to time. Time flew by quickly.

A month passed by in the blink of an eye. Wang Xian and the rest were satisfied with their harvest this month.

Especially the sky array. They were very happy.

The Mohan clan was a branch of the Magi. Many of the treasures were used by the Magi.

They were of great use to him.

The wizard items he obtained were useful to the heaven formation and Dragon Wizards. Some of the metal materials were useful to the Ao crab devouring dragon.

Some of the elixirs in the jade bottles were useful to Wang Xian and the entire Dragon Palace.

The entire continent was already a land of treasures to them.

As they continued to search, they kept all kinds of treasures in their bags.

“Dragon King, although there are many treasures here, none of them are at the seventh or eighth level of the Celestial Thearch!”

Three months passed very quickly. Wang Xian and the rest had indeed gained a lot.

However, there was one thing. They had never encountered any high-level items.

The highest-level item they obtained was only at the sixth level of the celestial thearch.

This made Ba Qi feel slightly displeased.

Midway, an lie brought the heaven array back to the Dragon Palace and allowed it to absorb the energy from the level seven Celestial Thearch’s corpse. His strength had also increased and he now possessed the strength of a level seven celestial thearch.

“Let’s search bit by bit. We have only explored one-fifth of this continent.”

Wang Xian smiled and didn’t mind.

“Squeak squeak squeak!”

Suddenly, the treasure-seeking ant on Wang Xian’s shoulder let out a squeak. Its pair of antennae emitted a strong light as it pointed to the front.

“Eh? This Is?”

Wang Xian sensed the excitement of the treasure-seeking ant. He was slightly stunned and his face revealed a look of joy.

“There should be a treasure ahead!”

As he spoke, he immediately flew in the direction pointed by the treasure-seeking ant.

After Wang Xian improved, his speed was very fast. The eight-point heaven formation and the rest followed behind him with great joy on their faces.

“This is?”

When Wang Xian and the rest flew to the front, they discovered a paradise.

This was the first paradise they discovered when they arrived on this continent.

In front of them, there were mountains and rivers intersecting each other. The mountain peaks that were up to a million meters tall were transformed into an incomparably luxurious living place.

Huge waterfalls flowed down from above, and the spiritual energy here was dozens of times more than in other places.

Moreover, the array here was still operating.

The arrays that could operate for billions of years could imagine the identity and status of the person who set up this array in the Mohan clan.

“Dragon King, the level of the array here is very high. Even if it is slightly weakened, with my current strength, I still can’t Break It!”

Heaven Array’s eyes were burning with passion as he spoke.

“In other words, it is very likely that a universe knight once lived here?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows as his eyes flickered.

“90% . The Mohan clan is an elementary race with a very deep foundation in the universe. There are dozens of universe knight-level existences in their entire race. It is very likely that it is the residence of a universe Knight!”

Sky array nodded.

“An lie, I’ll leave the rest to you!”

Wang Xian’s eyes were filled with excitement as he said to an lie.

“Don’t worry, Dragon King. Leave it to me. TSK TSK, I’ve finally encountered a good treasure!”

An lie looked at the array in front of him with excitement in his eyes.

His body moved and he immediately entered the array.

It was all thanks to an Lie’s abnormal ability. Otherwise, there was no hope for Wang Xian and the rest to obtain the treasure.

“Dragon King, the energy inside is so dense. It’s only slightly weaker than our Dragon Palace. Many of the items inside are intact!”

Soon, an lie, who had an excited expression, teleported out and shouted excitedly.
