Chapter 1378: 1378 abject species

“Fire-gold dragon seed?”

When Wang Xian saw the information obtained by the system, he was slightly taken aback.

His gaze was fixed on the line of words in his mind, “The strongest dragon seed in the forging technique in the Dragon Palace.”.

Dragon Seed, a powerful dragon seed!

Dragons had nine sons, and each of them was different. A dragon with a weak bloodline could become a divine dragon when he cultivated to the extreme.

However, some were different. For example, if a divine dragon was born with the same level of bloodline, the dragon might not necessarily evolve in the direction of a divine dragon.

Perhaps they would grow in another direction, and when they grew up, they might not be weaker than a divine dragon.

Among them, the top-tier dragon species in the dragon palace would not be weaker than a real divine dragon when they grew up, and might even be stronger than an ordinary divine dragon.

For example, the thorned dragon species had both light and dark attributes. When they grew up, they were no weaker than ordinary divine dragons.

For example, the wild dragon species had three attributes, fire, darkness, and lightning. When they grew up, divine dragons of the same level were no match for them.

On the other hand, this fire-gold dragon species possessed a terrifying talent in forging. It could even be compared to the top-tier forging species in the universe.

“I actually met a powerful dragon species, a peak-tier dragon species. Ao Yao is the only one in the entire Dragon Palace. The rest of the dragon species, even the rest of the strange demons, can not be considered to be at the peak.”.

Wang Xian stared at the two-meter-tall fire-gold dragon seed with a fiery gaze. Its entire body was made of metal, and it looked like a young man.

“I wonder how many members there are in the fire-gold dragon seed race. If there are many of them, I would be rich!”

He thought to himself.

It was not easy to obtain a peak dragon seed. For example, Ao Yao. He was able to become a peak dragon seed because of the heart of light and darkness.

If the strange demon wanted to evolve into a thorny dragon seed, he would need an extremely rare heart of darkness.

The Heart of Darkness was a high-level energy. Only experts who had reached the divine realm could condense the heart of darkness.

There was another condition, and that was that the other party was a god with darkness attribute.

If there were more fire gold dragon seeds, Wang Xian could nurture them into artifact masters and Great Grandmasters.

When he opened a weapon shop in the dragon and Phoenix Empire, he could completely monopolize the forging industry in the Dragon and Phoenix Empire.

He could use the money from selling weapons to buy pills, which could be converted into strength.

“The Phoenix clan’s talent, apart from their combat strength, is the most powerful in alchemy. Right now, the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan is hiding behind the Phoenix clan. The Dragon and Phoenix Empire’s pills are about to be monopolized by the Phoenix clan. If the Dragon Palace can monopolize the refining of weapons, it would be the best of both worlds!”

Wang Xian was glowing. Monopolizing the crafting of weapons of the Dragon and Phoenix dynasty was an extremely terrifying income.

Furthermore, the income was endless and unusually crazy.

Without any hesitation, Wang Xian walked towards the young man.

“Huh?”

Before Wang Xian got close, the young man sensed him. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

He turned his head and looked at Wang Xian vigilantly.

“What are you doing? Why Are You Staring at me?”

The young man stared at Wang Xian and the rest vigilantly and asked cautiously.

“Little guy, I see that you have a unique bloodline. Are you willing to follow me?”

Wang Xian stared at him with a smile on his face. His body emitted the aura of a divine dragon.

“Huh?”

Sensing the aura of Wang Xian’s bloodline, he was slightly stunned.

Wang Xian’s aura gave him a feeling of familiarity. This kind of familiarity came from his bloodline.

His eyes were filled with astonishment. However, very soon, his face showed vigilance again.

“You should be able to feel the closeness of our bloodline. Follow me and I will bring you into the world that you should enter!”

Wang Xian stared at him and said slowly.

“Who are you? I don’t know you!”

The young man stared at him and his expression changed slightly.

“I am Wang Xian. I don’t have any ill intentions towards you. How many clansmen do you have? Can you bring me over to take a look?”

Wang Xian stared at him and asked.

“Why... Why should I believe you?”

The young man looked at Wang Xian with some hesitation.

“Because you have the bloodline of the Divine Dragon!”

Wang Xian smiled.

“Divine Dragon? The bloodline of the Dragon Race? Don’t joke around. If I had the bloodline of the dragon race, how could I be so weak? My clansmen...”

The young man opened his mouth in disbelief.

Wang Xian smiled with a hint of disdain in his eyes. He smiled and said, “The divine dragon is not a member of the dragon race of the supernatural continent. Believe me, can you bring me to see your clansmen?”

“This... Alright!”

The young man looked at Wang Xian’s friendly expression and nodded his head slowly.

“My Name is Duan Jinming, a member of the Fire Hammer clan. Our clansmen are currently working in the gilded gold forging clan!”

Duan Jinming looked at Wang Xian and said softly.

“Fire Hammer clan? It’s fine. Bring me there to have a look!”

Wang Xian was slightly surprised. He followed beside Duan Jinming and walked towards Xiaoyao City.

Stepping on the Golden Ground, they continued to walk upwards.

The entire road was a thousand meters wide. Xiaoyao city was above them, so they had to walk up a slope.

“Move, move, move!”

At this moment, a few shouts came from the back. When Duan Jinming heard the shouts, he quickly dodged to the side.

“Quickly dodge. They are the descendants of some big families in Xiaoyao City!”

Duan Jinming reminded Wang Xian immediately.

Wang Xian looked over and saw a young man riding on various ferocious beasts heading into the city.

There were many families in Xiaoyao city. One or two of the top families were not weaker than some dynasties.

However, the strongest one was still the mayor of Xiaoyao City. It could be said that all the families in Xiaoyao City were the subordinates of the mayor of Xiaoyao City.

“There’s no need to be envious. To you, they are just ants!”

Wang Xian saw the envious look on Duan Jinming’s face and said faintly.

Duan Jinming was slightly stunned. He pursed his lips and didn’t say anything.

Xiaoyao city could be entered and exited freely. No one dared to cause trouble here.

After passing through a city gate that was a few hundred meters high, Duan Jinming continued to walk in with Wang Xian.

This was because Xiaoyao city was located on top of a mountain peak. Every mountain peak was located in an area. Looking at it from afar, it was extremely magnificent.

Especially the mountain peak that was 10,000 meters behind the city, it was extremely shocking.

“The most famous transaction in Xiaoyao city is this. The entire city is divided into five zones. One is the weapons zone, one is the elixir zone, one is the ferocious Beast Zone, and one is the grocery zone. The central zone is the King Zone!”

“Each zone has a top-notch family guarding it. Our clansmen are in the weapons zone, the gilded gold family!”

Duan Jinming led Wang Xian to the left as he explained.

Wang Xian smiled and nodded his head. His gaze swept across the surroundings. This Xiaoyao city was completely incomparable to the dragon and Phoenix Empire.

Magnificent buildings and magnificent scenery!

With Duan Jinming, a local, leading the way, he was able to understand a lot.

Soon, Wang Xian followed him to the weapons district. The entire district was filled with weapons shops.

There were even many shops with various weapons and metals!
