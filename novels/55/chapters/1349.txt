Chapter 1350: 1350

“Roar!”

A furious roar sounded from the bottom of the sea. In front of the Dragon Palace, nine flood dragons were pulling huge dragon chairs and swaying their huge bodies.

Prime Minister Gui was standing on the left.

The clam girl was standing on the right with a huge cattail leaf fan.

Behind them, Ao Qitian, who was holding the sea-pacifying needle in his hand, was leading his clansmen.

Beside him was Ao Qi, who held a thunder spear and a thunder hammer!

Ao Jian, who held a golden longsword!

Mou Zesen, who held a bow and arrow!

Behind them were their tribesmen.

These three groups were at the front, center, and left and right.

And in the center of their tribesmen was a special group of tribesmen.

There was a slender dolphin, and a venomous snake with a ferocious face.

Tang Yinxuan and the other girls didn’t follow them. A pink dolphin was the leader of the Dolphin tribe.

Ba Qi stood around the ferocious poisonous snakes.

These were two special combat divisions.

The Strange Demon Tribe hid in the surrounding void.

“Let’s Go!”

A humanoid creature held a huge conch in his hand and blew the Horn of war.

“Let’s Go!” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

All the Warriors of the Dragon Palace roared and flew forward aggressively.

Their target was the one leaf continent empire.

“Teng, Teng, Teng!”

Wang Xian sat on the huge dragon throne and a series of heart-rending voices sounded around them.

They were very fast.

“Dragon King, this is the news that the strange demons found in the one leaf continent Empire Yesterday!”

Before the battle, Prime Minister Gui had ordered the strange demon clan to find out the information.

This morning, all the information was sent over.

There was a simple record of the power of the one-leaf mainland dynasty and the power of the cities.

The one-leaf mainland dynasty was different from the Sky Island dynasty on an island.

The territory of the one-leaf mainland dynasty was 300 kilometers wide, which was three times the size of the Sky Island dynasty.

It was made up of small islands that looked like leaves from the sky, so it was called the one-leaf dynasty.

The power of the one-leaf dynasty was two to three times that of the Sky Island dynasty, and there were three rank 4 void interpretation realms.

Now that one was killed, there were two more.

There were nine rank 3 void interpretation realms.

The remaining twenty were no match for the Dragon Palace.

“The palace has gathered 50% of their dynasty’s forces. We can attack all the cities at the same time according to the information obtained by the Strange Demon!”

Prime Minister Gui said to Wang Xian.

“Alright, the newly promoted Dongxu members will lead their men to attack the cities. The rest will attack their imperial cities!”

Wang Xian nodded his head slowly.

“It’s the Dragon King. I’ll pass down the Order Now!”

Prime Minister Gui held the turtle shell and nodded his head. He then passed down the order.

“Whoosh!”

As they rushed out of the sea, a terrifying aura directly impacted the entire sky.

Nine flood dragons were sprinting in front while a group of subordinates followed behind.

“Everyone, hurry up. We received news from the Sky Island Empire today that the Sky Island Empire was attacked by powerful demonic beasts. Countless experts were killed and injured. Let’s go over and see if we can fish in troubled waters!”

“I really didn’t expect the Sky Island dynasty to be attacked so horribly. Didn’t our dynasty enter into a marriage alliance with them two days ago? Why are they suddenly attacked?”

“Yeah, the Sky Island dynasty isn’t weak either. What demonic beast would dare to attack them?”.

“Who cares? They’re not here to attack us. Their lives have nothing to do with us. Let’s see if we can make a fortune!”

On an island of the one leaf continent dynasty, a family flew towards the sky island dynasty with shining eyes.

Not long ago, they received news that the Sky Island dynasty had suffered a terrifying attack, and all the experts had been killed.

The entire country was in chaos.

This surprised them, and their eyes flickered. They immediately led their family members to the Sky Island dynasty.

They could fish in troubled waters. Even if they couldn’t get some treasures, they could control some beautiful women to sell them.

Their family had started from selling slaves in the past.

A group of more than fifty people flew out of the island with excited faces and flew forward.

At the front were three half-step void interpretation experts.

“My God, look ahead, that’s... That’s...”

Suddenly, the three half-step void interpretation experts in front who were conversing suddenly felt a terrifying force rushing over from the front.

They looked over, their faces filled with fear.

What was that?

Nine enormous creatures that were thirty meters long, flapping their not-so-big wings, pulled a golden throne.

That golden throne was at least a few hundred meters in size, and on it sat a human.

A human sitting on such a huge throne looked a little out of place, but it didn’t seem very strange.

At a glance, it seemed like that human was the center.

Behind the golden throne, about 3,000 creatures followed behind. They were strangely shaped and looked extremely ferocious.

As they got closer, a terrifying aura charged towards them.

What was even more shocking was that in the sky above the group of creatures, a terrifying dark cloud that covered an area of about five thousand meters followed them.

The Dark Cloud destroyed the city!

They had come with ill intentions!

Even if they were a few thousand meters away, they could still feel the destructive power of the other party.

“Return to the city, return to the city, immediately return to the city, quickly report to the city Lord!”

The group of more than fifty people revealed a terrified expression. They opened their eyes wide and hurriedly shouted, flying toward the city on the small island.

“An expert is flying over. Alert, Alert!”

They turned around and glanced at him. Seeing his terrifying speed, they shouted out in fear.

The voice of a half-step void interpretation expert covered the entire small island.

“What is that?”

“It’s a group of powerful creatures. What are they doing here?”

“Be careful, be alert, be alert!”

“Dong Dong Dong!”

On the city wall of the island, when some soldiers saw the group of Dragon Palace coming with a terrifying pressure, they widened their eyes and shouted in fear.

The sound of alert resounded throughout the island.

“Whoosh!”

An old man flew into the sky from the island Lord’s Mansion and flew toward the north gate.

When he saw nine 30-meter-long flood dragons pulling a throne and the terrifying creatures behind them, his face was filled with shock.

His forehead was instantly covered in cold sweat, and he couldn’t help but swallow a mouthful of saliva.

“Oh my God! This, this...”

“What faction are they from? Are they here to attack us? How terrifying...”

“This... This is not something we can resist!”

As Wang Xian and the rest got closer, the extremely thick and heavy dark clouds arrived. The huge scales on the nine creatures could be clearly seen. The soldiers on the city wall were trembling with fear in their eyes.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

When the dark clouds covered the entire sky, a 10-meter-tall demon monkey with a level-three ocean-pacifying needle in his hand led 300 demon monkey subordinates and jumped down from the sky!

“The one leaf continent’s dynasty is about to be destroyed. Those who submit will live, and those who resist will die!”

His majestic voice covered the entire island!

Meanwhile, the rest of the Dragon Palace’s forces were pointing at the one leaf continent’s imperial city!
