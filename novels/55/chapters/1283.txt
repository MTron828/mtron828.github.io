Chapter 1284: 1285 Beast Tamer Youth

Translator: 5496903

The blood refinement ground was filled with danger.

There were at least tens of thousands of people entering the blood refinement ground every day, or even more. However, there were at least thousands of people dying in there every day.

This was a natural desolate domain. Eighty percent of the mercenary groups in the demi-human graveyard were here to hunt fierce beasts and Demon Beasts.

This was a dangerous place for all the forces in the flowing sea region.

However, at this moment, Long Xiaotian and all his subordinates were dumbfounded.

Looking at Wang Xian who was standing in front of the six transcendent level eight beasts, all of them widened their eyes in disbelief.

It had been three hours since Wang Xian and the rest entered the blood refinement ground. They followed behind Wang Xian and flew deeper into the sea.

Along the way, they didn’t encounter any beasts or any danger.

On the contrary, once Wang Xian flew towards a certain place, he would definitely tame a few ferocious beasts that were at transcendent level six, seven, or even eight.

This unbelievable ability left long Xiaotian’s subordinates dumbfounded.

“Brother Wang Xian, your... your speed is insane. Furthermore, you can actually find ferocious beasts so easily!”

Long Xiaotian could not help but ask when he saw Wang Xian taming six level eight extraordinary ferocious beasts.

“It’s a powerful sensing ability!”

Wang Xian smiled faintly. “Isn’t the training ground full of ferocious beasts? It’s still not dense enough!”

“Uh... Young Master Wang, we only walked for two kilometers before we encountered more than ten ferocious beasts. It’s already very dense. Furthermore, we are now at the edge. If there are more ferocious beasts in the depths, there will be a herd of them!”

Elder Zhu looked at Wang Xian and said in a speechless manner. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Looking at Wang Xian shuttling through the blood refinement grounds, they had a feeling that he was strolling through the back garden.

Wang Xian nodded. “Alright, let’s speed up. It would be best if we can encounter a group of ferocious beasts. This way, our speed will be faster!”

As he spoke, he rode on the spirit purple qilin and flew into the distance.

Wang Xian was traveling at a very fast speed. He didn’t continue to tame one or two ferocious beasts alone.

With the light and dark fire dragon eyes, he could see everything within a two-kilometer radius clearly.

Coupled with the Divine Dragon System, nothing could escape his detection.

Furthermore, he could discover the hidden spiritual herbs immediately.

Long Xiaotian and the rest followed behind Wang Xian obediently as they dashed into the depths of the blood refinement ground.

“HMM? There’s a group of violent monkeys ahead. It’s a pity that they can’t be used as mounts!”

Wang Xian looked towards the tree ahead. There were more than a hundred violent monkeys there. Their strength was generally at transcendent level seven and above.

There were also a few at transcendent level nine and one at the half-step void interpretation stage.

If an ordinary mercenary group encountered them, it would be difficult to fight them without a void interpretation stage powerhouse.

“Let’s Go!”

Without any hesitation, Wang Xian moved his body and dashed forward.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

With a wave of his arm, rays of golden light shot towards the violent monkeys.

Chirp! Chirp! Chirp! Chirp

When the group of violent monkeys saw the humans, they immediately grinned. They stared at Wang Xian with ferocious expressions and pounced towards him.

However, when rays of golden light landed on their bodies, the group of violent monkeys fell to the ground.

Wang Xian waved his arm and kept them into his interspatial ring.

These violent monkey corpses were used to condense blood essence.

Long Xiaotian and his subordinates behind him widened their eyes and pursed their lips. Their faces were filled with shock.

“Brother Wang Xian’s strength is definitely comparable to a powerhouse at the first level of the Void Interpretation Stage!”

Long Xiaotian said in a low voice.

Bai Qingshan and elder Zhu nodded solemnly.

“Continue!”

Wang Xian’s figure could be heard from the front. Everyone followed behind him obediently and flew deeper into the forest.

They had killed over a thousand ferocious beasts in a row, but none of them were suitable to be used as mounts.

As they continued forward, they were completely unable to differentiate their direction in the dense forest.

It was truly a primitive forest. As they walked inside, they felt extremely tiny.

“Have we reached the Beast Valley?”

After traveling for about 20 to 30 kilometers, Wang Xian stopped when he saw the ground in front of him sink.

“Brother Wang Xian, we are in the depths of the land of blood refinement. Be careful!”

Long Xiaotian and the rest stopped as well. They walked up to him and reminded him softly.

“Okay!”

“Let’s go down!”

Wang Xian looked down and nodded. It was still a forest, but there was about half a meter of seawater inside.

As it was lower than the sea level on the left, the seawater surged in.

The seawater was half a meter deep and there were dense seaweed growing on it. The area ahead was twice as dangerous as the previous location.

“There’s a group of manatees ahead!”

When Wang Xian entered the sea, he looked to the left and saw more than a hundred manatees eating grass.

Each manatee was five meters in size and had a two-meter-long rhino horn.

The manatees were generally at transcendent level eight.

Wang Xian revealed a smile. He moved his body and flew directly toward the manatees.

Manatees belonged to the aquatic species. With Wang Xian’s current strength of level nine transcendence, aquatic species below level nine transcendence could be controlled directly.

When Wang Xian flew over, he unleashed his Dragon Might and the group of manatees knelt down in fear.

Compared to taming the ferocious beasts on land, the aquatic species were much simpler.

“Let me help you tame the ferocious beasts first. After taming these ferocious beasts, there are only about a hundred left!”

Wang Xian looked at the number of ferocious beasts and said with a smile.

“Alright, Alright. Thank you, brother Wang Xian!”

Long Xiaotian grinned from the side.

For the next day, Wang Xian spent all his time helping them tame the ferocious beasts.

As night fell, the entire area became darker. It was basically pitch black.

There were only the roars of the beasts and the sound of the waves in the distance.

Wang Xian and the rest did not move at night. Instead, they lit a fire and rested on the spot.

“F * ck, there are so many demonic beasts ambushing us in the blood refinement ground. D * mn it!”

“It’s all because of what happened at the Heaven’s Pride Bridge. The entire demon race lost face and came to take revenge on us!”

“I have to say that the battle at the Heaven’s Pride Bridge was really satisfying. The nameless sword demon is simply too strong!”

“There’s light ahead. There should be someone. Let’s go around!”

At this moment, the sounds of conversation came from ahead. As the group of people spoke, the voices gradually disappeared.

“Demon Beast? Second Prince, young master Wang, if there really are demon beasts ahead, we’d better not go any deeper. Otherwise, if we encounter danger, the gains will not be worth the losses!”

Bai Qingshan reminded them.

“Yes, although our strength is not weak, if we encounter a demonic beast of the second level of the Seethrough realm, there is basically no possibility of escaping!”

Long Xiaotian nodded his head in agreement.

“We are still lacking about a hundred beasts. Let’s look around and see if we can encounter a ferocious beast of the first level of the Seethrough Realm!”

Wang Xian did not care too much about it.
