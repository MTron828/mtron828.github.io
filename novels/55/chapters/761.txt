“Your alchemy skills are amazing!”

Walking out of the herb garden, Wang Xian looked at Feng Luan who was emitting a flame from her glabella and said softly.

“To US Vermilion Birds, alchemy is a piece of cake!”

Feng Luan said to Wang Xian coldly and arrogantly.

Wang Xian possessed the water of origin and the fire of origin. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

In the world, the Vermillion Bird was the king of flames. Even if it was a fire-attributed divine dragon, its control of flames was slightly inferior to that of the Vermillion Bird.

Therefore, even without an alchemy furnace, Feng Luan was able to refine level-six pills at a terrifying speed.

Of course, this was also largely due to her expertise in alchemy!

“Well, since you can refine pills so quickly, can you help me refine pills? Consider it as a reward for occupying my wife’s body!”

“The reason why you are able to wake up now is mainly because of us. Without Us, you would still be a drop of blood essence!”

“Help me refine some pills as a form of repayment to us!”

Wang Xian said to Feng Luan shamelessly.

This caused Feng Luan to frown slightly. Just as Wang Xian said, if it weren’t for them, she wouldn’t know when she would be able to revive.

As a prideful empress, she didn’t like to owe others favors.

“Sure, I’ll treat it as a repayment!”

After hesitating for a while, she nodded her head slowly.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes and revealed a faint smile on his face.

“With such a perverted alchemy master, it won’t be long before all the spiritual herbs from the natural born celestial sect can be refined into pills!”

Wang Xian thought to himself. With a thought, he suddenly asked, “Do you know how to refine weapons?”

“Yes!”

Feng Luan nodded her head expressionlessly.

“Can I refine a level-thirteen spiritual weapon, one that is engraved with an array formation?”

Wang Xian asked with anticipation.

“I can even refine a weapon at the return to void level, let alone an extraordinary weapon!”

Feng Luan looked at Wang Xian proudly.

However, she felt that she had gone too far. “With my current strength, I can only forge some simple weapons that can inscribe arrays!”

“Return to void stage? Extraordinary?”

Wang Xian silently memorized the realm that Feng Luan mentioned. This reminded him of the star attraction disc. The star attraction disc was also an item of the extraordinary stage.

This transcendence should be a realm above his current level. It was also the realm that he attained after completing the first transformation of the Divine Dragon Transformation.

As for the return to void, it might be the realm after transcendence.

“Can you tell me about the method to inscribe the array formation?”

Wang Xian rubbed his hands and said to Feng Luan.

Inscribing the array formation and refining a level-13 spirit weapon was what Wang Xian had been looking forward to all this while.

However, he couldn’t find any secret manuals to inscribe an array.

“Simple!”

She nodded her head coldly and didn’t say anything else.

Wang Xian looked at her helplessly. This empress of the so-called extraordinary continent had a very cold and arrogant character.

She didn’t even want to bother with him. She was as cold as ice. This was a tsundere empress!

After returning to the courtyard, Wang Xian stayed there for the next few days.

Wang Xian stayed in the natural born celestial sect to refine elixirs every day. When Feng Luan took over his body, he also helped to refine elixirs.

The speed of the two of them was extremely fast. In just three to four days, they had already refined half of the spiritual herbs in the natural born celestial sect!

With the communication between Guan Shuqing and Feng Luan, Wang Xian finally succeeded in inscribing the array formation.

According to Feng Luan, the array formation on a weapon could not be called an array formation. Instead, it was called an inscription formation. It was similar to an array formation, but it was completely different.

It was not difficult for Wang Xian to forge weapons. Even if it was to inscribe runes, with the help of the system, it was still very fast.

Regarding the shop of the crafting workshop, Mo Qinglong had already purchased it in the cities under the twenty gates of immortality. It would not be long before it could officially open for business.

Before Wang Xian opened for business, he was preparing to conduct a huge publicity.

He was preparing to hold an auction on the floating island. There would be a few grade-13 spirit weapons and some grade-7 or even grade-8 elixirs being auctioned there.

He believed that the immortals and gods would also be attracted here.

At that time, the Divine Dragon Refining Workshop would also become famous.

It would also be a good choice to be a merchant quietly in the future.

“Eldest senior brother and the others are preparing to go to the mysterious sea tomorrow. Are you going or not?”

“Yes, of course I’m going. The mysterious sea is connected to the underground sea, and there are countless powerful undersea creatures living there. Hunting powerful undersea creatures can be sold for a lot of spirit stones!”

“Spirit stones are secondary. If we are lucky enough to encounter the earth star fish, we will be rich!”

On the fifth day, Wang Xian took the time to take a break to stroll around the natural born celestial sect with Guan Shuqing. They heard the conversation of the natural born celestial sect disciples.

“Oh right, Xiao Xian, do you want to go to the mysterious sea to take a look? I heard there are many treasures there!”

Guan Shuqing heard the discussion at the side and said to Wang Xian.

“The mysterious sea? What is that place?”

Wang Xian asked curiously.

“You don’t even know about it. I’ve been sleeping for so long and you still don’t know about it?”

Guan Shuqing rolled her eyes at him. “The mysterious sea is an inland lake in the area of Ji Ding. However, it has an area of 100 kilometers. Hence, it is also known as the sea. It is said that this inland sea is connected to the underground sea. The depth of the water is extremely deep and there are many creatures and treasures in it.”

“There are many things about the mysterious sea on the Jianghu website these few days. There is a type of terrestrial star fish that can increase one’s lifespan after eating. It is very expensive!”

“Is that so? Terrestrial star fish can increase one’s lifespan. This is a fatal temptation for anyone!”

Wang Xian was slightly stunned. He really did not know about the mysterious sea. He had been refining pills and weapons for the past few days and did not pay attention to the things on the Jianghu website.

An earth star fish that could increase one’s lifespan was comparable to a miracle drug to humans.

However, it did not have much of an attraction to Wang Xian. As long as he did not die, his lifespan was almost endless.

“Connect to the underground sea?”

However, Wang Xian was filled with curiosity about the underground sea.

According to current scientific research, there was an underground sea on Earth. Moreover, the sea water was comparable to the surface.

This was also unexpected. There was a huge space on earth. This space might not be as large as the surface of the sea, but it was definitely comparable to the surface.

It was unknown if there were any living things in the underground sea.

However, water was the source of life. The possibility of having living things was very high.

Wang Xian took out his phone and looked at Ji Ding’s area.

“It’s near Tang Yinxuan’s house!”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and hesitated for a moment.

A powerful aquatic creature that could increase one’s lifespan was indeed attractive to him.

This type of fish that could increase one’s lifespan might not be useful to him, but if he could catch it, he could sell it at a high price.

“Why don’t we go over and take a look?”

Wang Xian looked at Guan Shuqing and asked hesitantly.

“Sure, I want to take a look at what’s happening outside as well!”

Guan Shuqing nodded her head with interest.

“Alright, the concoction of the elixir is almost done. Let’s go over and take a look!”
