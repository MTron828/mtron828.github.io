Chapter 1501: 1501 clan head?

“Hiss, this, this...”

“It’s still an instant kill, a casual wave of his hand. His strength is simply too terrifying!”

“How is this possible? He Feng is a dragon among men, how could he be defeated so easily? That young man’s strength...”

Within the He clan, at the birthday banquet venue, sounds of shock could be heard.

Looking at the miserable he feng, everyone swallowed a mouthful of saliva. Crushing, completely crushing.

A young man from the flowing sea region had actually crushed he feng, who was considered a dragon amongst men in those empires.

How was this possible?

If they hadn’t seen it with their own eyes, how could they believe it.

“I want to kill you, I want to kill you!”

He Feng fell to the ground. His entire body was in a sorry state. The pain in his arms and his chest made him feel extremely uncomfortable.

Sensing the gazes of the tens of thousands of young men around him, he stood up slowly with a ferocious expression and roared at Wang Xian.

When they saw he Feng’s slightly absent-minded roar, everyone was slightly shocked. They knew that this Wang Xian had completely offended young master he feng.

This enmity was completely formed, even if young master he yuan was in the middle.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

Just as he feng finished his sentence, figures flew over one by one.

The three pavilion masters and a few law enforcement personnel who were the closest flew over. They looked at He Feng, who was lying on the ground in a miserable state, with a stunned expression.

“He Feng!”

The three pavilion masters quickly landed beside He Feng and cried out in surprise.

“Seventh uncle, help me kill him! Help me kill him!”

When he fang saw the group of people from the law enforcement pavilion arriving, he shouted at one of the pavilion masters with a ferocious expression.

“Big Brother, it was you who wanted to teach brother Wang Xian a lesson but was injured by him. You Can’t blame brother Wang Xian for this, right?”

He Yuan’s expression changed slightly when he heard he Feng’s words. He quickly spoke up.

He was afraid that the people from the law enforcement pavilion would kill Wang Xian directly.

“You dare to hurt me? No matter who it is today, don’t even think about leaving our he clan!”

When he feng heard he Yuan’s words, his bloodshot eyes swept across him and Wang Xian as he growled in a low voice.

“Huh?”

The few pavilion masters were slightly stunned when they saw he Feng’s ferocious and furious expression. They raised their heads and looked forward.

“This...”

When they saw Wang Xian, their faces froze and the corners of their mouths twitched slightly.

It was actually him, it was actually this young man!

Attack? What a joke. Unless it was the tribe leader and the three tribe elders, or the ancestors of the Guardian tribe, they wanted to kill him?

“Feng ‘Er!”

At this moment, a woman’s shocked voice sounded. Two figures appeared in front of He Feng.

The woman’s face was filled with worry as she walked up to He Feng and looked at his body.

“Clan leader!”

When the surrounding people saw the figure, they bowed respectfully and called out.

“Mother!”

“Feng ‘er, who hurt you so deeply? In our he clan, who would dare to hurt you!”

He Feng called out, and the woman’s face was filled with anger as she shouted.

“Mother!”

He Yuan saw his mother and father arrive, and a bitter expression appeared on his face.

He didn’t expect that this matter would be so big.

“Who dares to hurt my son, stand out!”

The woman’s face revealed a cold murderous aura, and she looked forward and shouted sternly.

Her voice caused everyone around to be shocked!

“It’s Done!”

The moment the woman finished her sentence, the He clan leader behind her said faintly.

His gaze swept over he feng and then looked at Wang Xian. A smile appeared on his face as he said, “Brother Wang Xian, my eldest son is insensible. Don’t mind him!”

What?

However, the words of the He clan leader stunned everyone present.

Even the woman, he feng, and he yuan looked at him in astonishment.

What was going on?

His eldest son was severely injured. Not only did the He clan leader not take revenge for him, he even blamed he feng.

This...

“It’s alright, he clan leader. I was too harsh!” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Wang Xian smiled at the He clan leader and said.

“It’s alright. Let this kid know that there’s always someone better. Hehe!”

The He clan leader smiled and looked at he yuan. “Little Yuan, you’ve made a good friend. Get along well!”

“Take Feng ‘er away, don’t embarrass yourself here!”

Finally, he tribe leader looked at He Feng and said to the woman.

“Father!”

He Feng looked at his father in disbelief and slightly opened his mouth to call out.

“Husband, this...”

The woman also looked at her husband in shock, she didn’t understand why he didn’t punish her son after he was beaten.

“Take him away!”

He tribe leader didn’t say anything. He waved his arm and a thorn wrapped around he feng.

The woman saw his expression and nodded slowly.

“Yuan ‘er, enjoy your birthday!”

She said to he yuan and left immediately.

“This...”

Seeing he tribe leader take he feng away without saying anything, everyone around was shocked.

What the hell was going on?

He Feng was beaten up so badly, yet clan leader he didn’t say anything?

Something was strange.

“This... brother Wang Xian, have you met my father? And your strength is so abnormal!”

He Yuan didn’t expect things to end like this. He stared at Wang Xian with his eyes wide open and asked in shock.

“I met him a few days ago. Uncle is a good person!”

Wang Xian nodded with a smile on his face.

“This... No wonder. No wonder. My father must have seen your strength and didn’t say anything!”

“I really didn’t expect that when we first fought, the gap between us wasn’t that big. Now, the gap between us is huge!”

“How did you cultivate, you monster?”

He Yuan patted Wang Xian’s shoulder heavily and asked in shock.

“Maybe this is talent!”

Wang Xian smiled.

Everyone around swallowed a mouthful of saliva and stared at Wang Xian in astonishment.

From the few words of the He clan leader, they could tell how much importance the He clan leader placed on Wang Xian.

He didn’t even blame his own son for being injured. One could imagine how much recognition the He clan leader had for his strength.

Perhaps, the He clan leader even wanted to pull him into the He clan.

Everyone was speculating in their hearts as their eyes sparkled.

Everyone had memorized Wang Xian’s figure in their minds. This person was someone who could even injure the He clan’s young master without any problems!

“Young master Wang Xian, your strength is so strong. If you were placed in the vast region, no one in your generation would be able to defeat you. You’re too powerful!”

He suiqing, who was standing at the side, also walked over in slight shock and said to Wang Xian.

No wonder he was able to be good friends with the proud he yuan. It turned out that his talent was so terrifying!

“Hehe, you don’t have to praise me like that. Today is he Yuan’s birthday. Happy Birthday. This is the gift I prepared for you!”

Wang Xian smiled and gave little rascal to he yuan as he spoke.

“Wow, Little Rascal, I just want to buy this pet of young master Wang Xian. Now that he has given it to you, do you think you can...”

When he suiqing saw Wang Xian giving little rascal to he yuan, she pulled he Yuan’s arm coquettishly.

When he yuan saw his fiancée acting coquettishly to him, he was in a good mood. He reached out and took little rascal.

“Of course not...”

He said with a smile on his face. However, before he could finish his sentence, the expression on his face became interesting.

He widened his eyes and sized up little rascal. His eyes revealed a shocked expression.

“Maybe, no!”

He spat out four words softly.

HMM?

His answer caused he suiqing to be slightly stunned. Everyone around him was also stunned.
