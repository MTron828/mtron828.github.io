Chapter 2959: glazed tile grand ceremony announced to the world

“Roar Roar Roar!”

In the Chimei territory, a roar came from a demon cave.

The Devouring Dragons of the Dragon Palace were hunting down the demonic beasts one by one.

“Hahaha, I’ve improved again. I’ve improved again. I’ve finally broken through to the first level of celestial thearch!”

!!

In the deepest part of the Demon Cave, an excited voice was heard.

At the side, the Wang Xian Heaven Array and the others revealed a smile.

They had stayed here for half a year. After killing the demonic beasts in the devil lairs, an lie had absorbed the energy from the altar. His strength had broken through once again.

“Hahaha, Dragon King, I can teleport within a radius of 300 million kilometers. There are still 50 devil lairs. The higher the level of the devil lairs, the more energy there is in the altar. I reckon I can at least increase by one or two ranks!”

An lie said excitedly.

“It will be troublesome to deal with the demon caves now. In the end, it will become more and more troublesome, especially to deal with the level four demon caves of the void God Realm!”

Wang Xian said.

“After killing the level three demonic beasts of the void God realm, the Dragon Palace will be able to increase the number of level three experts of the void God realm. It shouldn’t be too much of a problem to surround and attack them. The closer we are to the depths, the further the demon caves are. Even if there is a battle, we will not be discovered. Maybe in a year or two, we will be able to eliminate all the demonic beasts in the chimei region.”

Heaven’s formation calculated with a smile on his face.

Wang Xian nodded his head. To be able to obtain so many resources in one to two years, it was quite a lot.

Overall, the resources obtained from killing the demons in the chimei territory would only be more than that of the machine royal territory.

“Take a break and continue!”

Wang Xian said.

“Yes!”

Heaven’s formation dark raging ao crab and the rest nodded their heads.

At this moment, the communication stone plate in Wang Xian’s mother nest suddenly trembled.

He opened it and raised his eyebrows.

Following that, a few more messages were sent over.

These few messages were sent by Prime Minister Gui and the glazed domain lord.

Now that half a year had passed, all the citizens of the glazed domain had returned.

All the citizens had settled down.

The crisis had been resolved. Besides, apart from some planets being ravaged by evil spirits, not many people had died in this crisis.

The glazed area was ready to celebrate.

Secondly, the glazed area had officially announced that the Dragon Palace would be the ruler of the glazed area in the future, and the Dragon King would be the king.

This was not just words, but something that had to be paid for.

For example, taxes.

For a powerful faction that controlled many planets, taxes were an important source of resources for a faction.

It was not an exaggeration to say that the entire VELURIYAM domain’s monthly tax resources could allow the Dragon Palace to give birth to a divine emperor powerhouse.

In addition, in order to thank the Dragon Palace for helping them tide over the crisis, Veluriyam and the others would take out treasures to thank the Dragon King.

Prime Minister Gui mentioned in the message that Liu Li would gift their ultimate treasure, the glazed rainbow stone, to the Dragon King.

The glazed rainbow stone was the ultimate treasure of the entire glazed domain. There were only a few glazed rainbow stones in the entire glazed domain.

As for its specific function, Prime Minister Gui did not know.

Other than the glazed rainbow stone, there were also glazed rainbow stones and so on.

“It seems like it’s necessary to make a trip there!”

Wang Xian looked at the information one by one and smiled.

As a large domain, the glazed domain had many precious treasures. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“I’ll return to the Dragon Palace to settle some matters later. Let’s wait for the chimei domain. There’s no rush!”

Wang Xian said to Tian Cheng and the rest.

“Oh? Dragon King, What’s the matter?”

Tian Chen asked curiously.

“Nothing major. The glazed area is holding a celebration to thank US properly.”

“They will send us some treasures then.”

Wang Xian said with a smile.

“The treasures of the glazed area?”

“I’ve heard about some of the treasures of the glazed area before I died. Especially the glazed stone. I heard that it’s a rare treasure!”

The eyes of the heaven array lit up as he spoke.

“AO he, send a few subordinates here to keep an eye on things. An lie, bring us back to the Devil’s lair in the Chimei Domain!”

Wang Xian instructed an lie.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

The two of them nodded.

The next moment, they appeared in a devil’s lair at the border of the chimei domain.

Ao crab ordered a few of his men to guard this place. Then, Wang Xian and the rest returned to the Dragon Palace.

“Dragon King!”

After Wang Xian and the rest arrived, Prime Minister Gui and the rest immediately went over to welcome them.

“Since the glazed tile territory is holding a celebration and they are prepared to treat us as their masters, we should also make some preparations and do what we should do.”

“What’s the situation in the Holy Region?”

Wang Xian nodded and asked Prime Minister Gui.

Prime Minister Gui had just sent him a message and briefly mentioned the Holy Region.

Wang Xian also understood that after witnessing the dragon palace’s formidable strength and seeing the Veluriyam capital submit to the Dragon Palace, the holy region should also do something.

“Emperor Hongfeng said that their holy region will also take the Dragon Palace as their leader in the future and is willing to provide us with some resources and treasures every year.”

Prime Minister Gui smiled and said.

“That’s fine. The holy region and the glazed area have a good relationship with us. Ask them. If they have any intentions, they can get through all the communication messages of the Celestial Wizard region and the glazed area. This will be beneficial to the development of the entire resplendent starry sky!”

Wang Xian said to Prime Minister Gui.

“It’s the Dragon King. There shouldn’t be any problems in the glazed saint land!”

Prime Minister Gui nodded.

The two of them chatted as they walked. Soon, they arrived at the location of the dragon transformation pool.

At this moment, in the dragon transformation pool, there were many members of the Dragon Palace who were improving their strength.

After entering the chimei territory and hunting down the demons in the demon caves, they had already obtained more than 1,000 corpses of the demon god Emperor.

Adding on the corpses of the four great YAOXIE leaders and the monsters, the members of the Dragon Palace could increase their strength by more than a thousand celestial emperor experts.

“The corpses of the four Yaoxie leaders have raised the strength of a wind god Dragon, Ao Yao, Ao Qitian, and Ba Qi. Now, they have raised their combat strength to the third level of the void God Emperor.”

“The remaining resources will be allocated to the elite experts of the Dragon Palace!”

Prime Minister Gui said to Wang Xian.

“Alright, I’ll leave the matters of the Dragon Palace to you. When will the celebrations of the glazed area be held?”

Wang Xian nodded.

He didn’t need to worry about the matters of the Dragon Palace. Prime Minister GUI could be 100% impartial.

Prime Minister Gui was dedicated to the Dragon Palace. It was much better than Wang Xian managing it himself.

“The celebrations of the glazed area will be held in three days. The holy region will participate in it too. They have also invited the Dragon Queen.”

Prime Minister Gui said with a smile.

“Let’s head over now. We can set up some dragon palaces in the Veluriyam capital. It will be more convenient for us to deal with the matters in the chimei territory.”

Wang Xian said in a good mood.

After coming to the resplendent starry sky for more than ten years, this starry sky was already under the control of the Dragon Palace.

He was very proud!
