Chapter 2876: 2,876 seconds

“Xiao Yan, even though the Dragon King guided you and made you break through, it’s best that you don’t get involved in this kind of thing. Not to mention you, even our holy region doesn’t dare to get involved. If you’re not careful, there won’t even be any bones left!”

“Bhang, which one of us from the Wizard Association is easy to bully? Even the imperial court isn’t much weaker than us!”

In the Great Hall, a sacred region divine emperor continued to speak earnestly to Hong Fengyan.

“I… I know!”

Hong Fengyan nodded slightly.

“It’s good that you know.”

The other four people looked at each other, shook their heads, and walked out.

Hong Fengyan stood there quietly. After a few dozen seconds, she flew into her own palace.

“Ye Luying, don’t you think that the divine emperor of the imperial court’s eight Barrens is too arrogant? Damn it, he actually dares to threaten us. Boss Wang should have killed them all!”

“Now that the Imperial Court’s Wizard Association and Eight Barrens have joined forces, is the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace still their match?”

“I know boss Wang very well. It Won’t be long before we can completely kill them. HMPH.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“But, they are the alliance of the three major forces!”

When she had just arrived in the hall, she heard the voice of invincible battle technique and her disciple talking inside.

“Master!”

“Master!”

When Ye Lui Ying and the others saw Hong Fengyan, they immediately shouted respectfully.

“Divine Emperor Hong Feng!”

Divine Emperor Shangshui and invincible battle technique also immediately greeted her.

“You two have come a long way. After the celebration, let my disciples show you around.”

Hong Fengyan said with a smile.

“Hehe, thank you, divine emperor Hong Feng.”

Invincible of fighting style replied with a smile.

“Has the Dragon King replied to your message?”

After hesitating for a few seconds, Hong Fengyan asked them.

“Not yet. I wonder what boss Wang is doing now?”

Invincible fighter shook his head with a straight face.

“Buzz Buzz!”

But suddenly, something on his chest trembled.

“What?”

Invincible fighter was slightly stunned. He immediately took out the communication stone plate on his chest.

“It’s a message from boss Wang. He has rushed towards US and has entered the Holy Region!”

Invincible battle technique shouted in surprise when he saw the message on the communication stone plate.

“He said that he was cultivating a while ago and didn’t see our message. He also said that he won’t be able to make it on the first day of the ceremony, but he’ll be able to make it on the second day!”

He continued.

“Oh? is the Dragon King Coming Soon?”

Ye Luying and the others asked in surprise.

“He’s on his way. It’ll probably take another seven or eight hours.”

Invincible said with a grin.

“Yes!”

Hong Fengyan’s eyes flickered and she nodded slightly. She looked at her disciples and said, “Go to the Holy Tower and reserve the top floor. Tomorrow, we’ll sit with the Dragon King and the water god Emperor to enjoy the delicacies of our holy region.”

“Yes, Master!”

The disciples immediately said happily.

“We have to inform Dragon King about the alliance between the Imperial Court’s Wizard Association and Bhang. Let the Dragon Palace prepare in advance.”

God Emperor Shangshui said slowly from the side.

Hong Fengyan also nodded slightly.

Bhang joining the two major forces might be bad news for the Dragon Palace.

“Dragon King, this holy region is so peaceful. Moreover, there is news of God Emperor Hong Feng’s breakthrough everywhere.”

At this moment, on a planet located in the Holy Region, Wang Xian was leading six wind celestial dragons on a journey of teleportation from one planet to another in the imperial star field.

This was the first time the wind celestial dragons had gone on a long journey. They looked around curiously.

They had been cultivating all this while and did not understand the various star fields in the resplendent starry sky.

“The holy region is very peaceful. It has been united for nearly ten years. However, it is also because it is relatively peaceful and the competition is not very big. Hence, there are not many divine emperors in the Holy Region.”

“However, the foundation of the Holy Region is very deep. They are much stronger than the imperial court when they were at their peak.”

Wang Xian said to them from the side.

The group of wind divine dragons nodded their heads slightly.

Their eyes swept across the surroundings. All of them were filled with information about the breakthrough of the Red Wind Divine Emperor.

The birth of a divine emperor in the holy region was a joyous occasion for the entire imperial star region.

“We will reach the central holy kingdom in seven hours.”

Wang Xian looked at the map and said.

The holy region was also very big. If they were to fly there, it would take half a month.

Wang Xian went through one transit after another.

After seven hours, they arrived at their destination, the Holy Kingdom.

The Holy Kingdom was a holy land suspended in the universe.

It could be called the sky nation.

The entire huge holy nation was the void God Nation of a fallen God Emperor.

The entire void God nation was huge, not any smaller than the Dragon Island.

According to the rumors in the Holy Region, the owner of this void God nation was a terrifying existence billions of years ago. He had the strength of a peak void God Emperor.

After billions of years, most parts of the holy nation had already decayed.

However, even if it decayed, it was still a blessed land.

“God Emperor Hong Feng advancing to God Emperor is truly a fortunate thing for our holy region. Our Holy Region has an additional god Emperor, and our strength has also increased by a lot.”

“The grand ceremony this time is simply too spectacular. Moreover, this is the first time I have seen our Lord Holy Master with my own eyes.”

“Unfortunately, the imperial court god Emperor and eight desolation God Emperor are a little disappointed. They actually publicly warned us about the holy region and God Emperor Hong Feng!”

“That Dragon Palace is a little too arrogant. They are the arch-enemies of the Imperial Court and the Shamans Association. Both sides are evenly matched. Now, they have offended eight barrens. Now that they have joined forces, I reckon that the Dragon Palace will be finished in the future!”

“I reckon that the celestial thearch of the imperial court and the eight barrens are also afraid that we will join forces with the Dragon Palace. That’s why they came here to scout for the limelight. Naturally, our sacred master is unwilling to join in. However, the red wind celestial thearch is a little uncertain. The Red Wind Celestial Thearch is able to become a celestial thearch all because of that Dragon King.”

“That Dragon Palace is courting death. Don’t Drag US along. Don’t drag our red wind celestial emperor along. This ceremony is all their fault. It’s a little disappointing.”

When Wang Xian had just arrived at the Saint Nation through the teleportation formation, he heard the discussions around him.

“Oh?”

When Wang Xian heard their discussions, he raised his eyebrows slightly. His eyes were sparkling.

“I didn’t expect the imperial court of the Witch Formation Association to join forces with bhang. Furthermore, the speed at which they joined forces is so fast!”

He mumbled and was a little surprised.

It would take at least four to five months to reach the bhang six directions from the Heaven Wizard region. However, it had only been a little over a month and they had already joined forces.

There was only one possibility. An expert from the imperial court of the Witch Formation Association happened to be in the bhang six directions.

“This is really an accident.”

Wang Xian scanned his surroundings.

The reason why he dared to offend bhang Liu he was because bhang Liu he was very far away from the Heaven Wizard region. It was unlikely for them to form an alliance.

However, he did not expect that the speed of their alliance would be so fast.

Bhang Liu was also so daring as he was caught in the middle of the battle.

“It’s possible that they thought that the three major forces would be able to completely destroy the dragon palace if they joined forces. Hehe.”

Wang Xian smiled contemptuously.
