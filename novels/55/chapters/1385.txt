Chapter 1386: 1386 young city lord

“I’ll leave the Spirit Stones with you for now. Use these spirit stones to buy all kinds of metal materials. In the future, we will open a weapons store!”

“Also, take out half of the spirit stones and buy some elixirs to increase the strength of your fire hammer clan!”

Wang Xian didn’t take the interspatial ring and said to the Fire Hammer clan leader.

“Thank you, Dragon King. These few days are the five-year king auction period. At the same time, it is also the time for the major forces to purchase all kinds of items. The weapons in our hands can only be sold for three days at most. If we can meet some dynasties to purchase them, we might not be able to last a day!”

“We can totally use the spirit stones we earned to purchase the materials and continue to sell them. If we do this repeatedly, we will be able to earn even more profits!”!

“Furthermore, Jin Ming and I are already able to forge void interpretation weapons!”

The chief of the Fire Hammer clan said to Wang Xian with a smile on his face.

“Yes, that’s fine. You guys can make your own arrangements. I will bring Jin Ming to participate in the King’s auction tomorrow!”

Wang Xian nodded and said to the chief of the Fire Hammer clan.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

The chief of the Fire Hammer clan bowed and walked out.

After a night’s Rest, Wang Xian was awakened by the sound of forging in the morning.

He walked out of the room and looked around with a smile on his face.

The members of the Fire Hammer clan were forging weapons one by one.

Due to the transformation of the Fire God Dragon, everyone’s spirit, energy, and spirit had undergone a huge change.

In addition, the clothes on their bodies had improved a little. They were wearing new clothes with a fire hammer pattern on the back. It was completely different from the pitch-black clothes that Wang Xian had when he first met them.

Now, the blazing flames on their bodies had a hint of a smile on their faces.

A faint aura emanated from their bodies.

“Dragon King!”

After eating some food, Duan Jinming came to Wang Xian’s side and shouted respectfully.

“Let’s go. The auction is about to begin!”

Wang Xian nodded and led Ao Jian, Ao Yao, and the rest to the king’s auction house in a beast carriage.

“There are so many people. There are simply too many of them. Furthermore, there are so many void interpretation experts here!”

When they arrived at the king’s area in the middle, Duan Jinming scanned his surroundings with a look of astonishment.

There were many luxurious cars pulled by powerful ferocious beasts. Among them, there were many void interpretation level ferocious beasts pulling the cars.

There were also many people riding on void interpretation level ferocious beasts. Each and every one of them exuded a noble aura.

There were also many powerhouses from powerful sects who were dressed in uniform.

The entire King’s region was bustling with activity.

“After staying here for such a long time, don’t you know about this grand scene?”

Wang Xian looked at the surprised Duan Jinming and asked with a smile.

“No. These few days are also the busiest time for us. Moreover, we are not qualified to enter the King’s Region!”

Duan Jinming smiled and scanned his surroundings in surprise.

“We’re here. Let’s Get Off!”

Wang Xian patted Duan Jinming’s arm and said faintly.

“Yes, yes!”

Duan Jinming nodded immediately and followed behind him.

The carriage stopped not far from the king’s auction house. There were many grand teams around them.

Void interpretation experts could be seen everywhere. At least a thousand people were walking towards the king’s auction house.

“Eh? The Fire Hammer clan? Why are the Fire Hammer clan here?”

Wang Xian and the rest followed the crowd and walked in slowly. Suddenly, a surprised voice came from the side.

Duan Jinming frowned and turned his head. He saw more than a dozen people looking at him.

The one who spoke was a young man. At this moment, the young man was looking at Duan Jinming with a face full of surprise. He looked at the emblem of the Fire Hammer clan on the back of his clothes!

“Why can’t You Come Here?”

Duan Jinming whispered and turned his head away.

“Hehe, a lowly clan. This is not a place that you can come to...”

“Shut up. Be careful not to bring disaster to your own clan!”

As the young man continued speaking, Wang Xian turned his head around and said coldly.

“HMM?”

“Huh?”

When the dozen of people beside the young man heard Wang Xian’s words, their faces turned cold immediately.

Ao Jian and the other three golden swordfish stared at them coldly, causing everyone to feel their breathing stagnating.

The Young Man’s face turned red as he opened his mouth. He wanted to speak but was stopped by a middle-aged man beside him.

“I’m sorry for offending you, Young Master!”

A middle-aged man cupped his hands at Wang Xian and looked at Ao Jian and the rest with some fear.

“Mind your own business. You have no manners!”

Wang Xian looked at the middle-aged man indifferently and said directly.

This caused the middle-aged man’s face to darken slightly and he snorted softly. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“It’s the young master of Xiaoyao City. The young master of Xiaoyao City Is Here!”

“The young master of Xiaoyao City Master has the strength of a half-step to the peak of the void interpretation realm at such a young age. He can break through to the void interpretation realm at any time!”

“Yesterday, the young mayor invited many of the younger generation to attend the gathering. It’s a pity that Bei'er wasn’t able to participate!”

At this moment, sounds of exclamations could be heard from the surroundings.

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and looked towards the back.

A young man with long hair and a proud expression, dressed in white clothes and with the word “Xiaoyao”written on his chest, walked straight towards the king’s auction house.

Around him were forty to fifty young men and women.

There were the disciples of the families in Xiaoyao City, as well as some princes and princesses from other dynasties!

A group of proud young men followed behind the young castellan with smiles on their faces.

Each and every one of them had a proud look on their faces.

“Third miss, third miss is here too!”

At this moment, an excited voice came from beside Wang Xian.

Wang Xian looked over and saw that Duan Jinming was looking at the back of the group of young men and women.

A dignified and beautiful woman was following behind. It was the third miss of the gilded gold family.

“Third miss!”

When the third miss of the gilded gold family came to the side not far away, Duan Jinming could not help but call out in a low voice.

Just when Gilded Gold Yan was feeling a little annoyed following behind, he suddenly heard a familiar voice.

She was slightly stunned and quickly looked over, a hint of surprise on her face.

She hesitated for a moment, then walked towards Duan Jinming with a slightly red face.

“Huh?”

“Huh?”

The men and women next to her were slightly stunned. Her elder sister and second brother’s expressions changed slightly.

“Xiao Yan, what are you going to do?”

The two of them stopped walking with a dark face. A young man in water-blue clothing at the side raised his eyebrows and slightly raised his head. He also stopped walking with displeasure in his eyes.

“It’s that guy!”

Beside the young man in aqua blue, Yao Dingfeng, who was holding a feather fan, narrowed his eyes and also stopped walking.

“Big Sister, second brother, we met a friend!”

Yu Jinyan turned around and looked at his big sister and second brother, whose faces were cold. His expression was a bit ugly.

“Don’t interact with some random people. Let’s Go!”

The two of them looked at him and said with sullen faces.
