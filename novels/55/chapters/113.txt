Chapter 114: Known Throughout University of Rivertown (5)

“Xu Qingcheng, why are you kicking up a fuss?”

In the Taekwondo Club, just as Wang Xian was about to cripple this arrogant guy with a slap, a loud roar pierced through the atmosphere.

The surrounding crowd, who was ready for a show, turned around and looked in shock.

All they saw was a middle-aged man in a Taekwondo suit rushing over. He had the same black belt over his waist and looked worried.

“Coach!”

“Coach!”

The members of the club quickly greeted despite being surprised by the middle-aged man.

The middle-aged coach wasn’t bothered and walked up to the ring with a heavy expression. His gaze swept passed Wang Xian and his heart palpitated rapidly. After which, he turned to his student and stared angrily at him.

“Coach, why are you here?” Xu Qingcheng was startled to see his coach.

“If I didn’t come, would you expect me to accept your actions silently?”

Yan Hu was furious and gave Xu Qingcheng a harsh stare. He took a deep breath and walked towards Wang Xian.

“I’m sorry, Wang Xian. My student couldn’t tell what’s good for him and has offended you. I’ll teach him a lesson personally.”

The middle-aged coach spoke with great respect.

He didn’t know much about Wang Xian but he knew that Wang Xian was a person that even Director Sun had to show great respect to from the incident on that night.

Director Sun was a friend of a higher social status that he got into contact with by coincidence.

On that night, Director Sun had also invited him. Therefore, he knew what had happened in the bar.

After that incident, he heard some information from Director Sun. This young man wasn’t from a family with a strong background but was one with truly incredible strength.

This strength was referring to human strength.

As a 9th Dan Taekwondo expert who had reached the epitome of Taekwondo, his battle prowess was extraordinary.

Even so, he also knew some things that ordinary people didn’t.

That was none other than Ancient Martial Arts.

Against Ancient Martial Arts, the Taekwondo that he practiced was no more than playing house.

At this moment, this student of his had offended such an expert. He must be truly eager to die.

The other party could even kill you before anyone noticed it.

Wang Xian looked at this middle-aged coach with doubts.

Yan Hu saw his puzzled looks and immediately explained. “Hi, student. You might not recognize me but I was lucky to have met you at the bar that night. I’m a friend of Director Sun.”

Wang Xian nodded his head and looked to Xu Qingcheng.

“Xu Qingcheng! Apologize now!” Seeing that Wang Xian had turned to Xu Qingcheng, Yan Hu quickly shouted.

“Coach... You... You...”

Xu Qingcheng looked at his coach in disbelief. He couldn’t understand why his teacher would be chiding him or why his coach would apologize to the other party. Moreover, he was even doing so with great respect.

One should know that his coach was a 9th Dan blackbelt and had even clinched the title of the National Taekwondo Champion.

It was also because of the teachings of his incredible coach that he managed to achieve what he had today.

“Apologize! To challenge Young Master Wang with your strength, are you courting a beating? Even I am not a match for Young Master Wang, do you think you would be? If I hadn’t seen the thread in the school forum by coincidence, I wouldn’t have known that you are so brazen!”

Yan Hu chided Xu Qingcheng angrily.

“What?” Xu Qingcheng’s eyes stared wide open and looked at his own coach in disbelief.

What did I just hear?

Coach said that he isn’t a match for him?

How can this be! My coach is a 9th Dan Blackbelt!

“Are you turning a deaf ear to what I’ve said?” Yan Hu looked at him and continued.

Seeing his coach’s expression, Xu Qingcheng looked around unwilling and said with a blushing face, “I’m... I’m sorry!”

He didn’t dare to defy his coach’s words and his coach wouldn’t lie to him.

However, he still couldn’t understand why his coach wouldn’t be a match for Wang Xian.

What just happened? What just happened?

The surrounding crowd looked at the sudden twist in development in disbelief. They had all believed that Xu Qingcheng would give Wang Xian a painful lesson.

However, before their fight even started, Coach Yan Hu suddenly rushed over.

Coach Yan Hu was a pretty well-known figure in the University of Rivertown. He had taken on over 10 street ruffians by himself when they came to school to cause trouble.

It was also because of that incident that Coach Yan Hu shot to stardom and made the Taekwondo Club the hottest student club in the University of Rivertown.

And now, Coach Yan actually apologized to Wang Xian and even claimed that he wasn’t a match for Wang Xian!

This...

Everyone was astonished.

It was especially so for the members of the Taekwondo Club. They were puzzled over Coach Yan Hu’s words.

However, since they were from Coach Yan Hu, they had no reason to doubt the authenticity of them.

In the crowd, those students, who had come over to watch a show, looked towards the Taekwondo Club members. Some of them were shocked but there were also some who looked at the members with mockery.

Just a while ago, they had seen their disdainful looks on Wang Xian.

And now, their coach ran out to apologize and even made Xu Qingcheng do the same.

Twist!

Major twist of events!

Wang Xian hadn’t even moved a finger and the outcome of this matter had been clear as crystal.

The Taekwondo Club members sensed the gazes from the surrounding crowd and their faces turned a little red from embarrassment.

As for that student who was using his phone to update the situation on the thread, he stood there in complete shock.

Seeing that there were still students constantly replying, his face sank.

What should I do now? Continue to update?

Am I supposed to say that the sparring did not happen because their coach arrived? That he even apologized to Wang Xian and stated that he wasn’t a match for Wang Xian? That he is here to reprimand Xu Qingcheng for being brazen and courting death?

And even made Xu Qingcheng apologize?

If I send this out, Xu Qingcheng will be completely embarrassed!

How could he even lift his head in front of Wang Xian in the future?

However, even if I don’t post, those students who were here to witness would also spread this out.

Damn!

At this moment, he suddenly saw someone had updated the situation on his behalf in the thread he had started.

Picture after picture and word after word.

[Just as the two of them were about to fight, Coach Yan rushed over and apologized to Wang Xian personally. He even claimed to not be a match for the other party!]

[Coach Yan made Xu Qingcheng apologize and Xu Qingcheng did so with a flushing red face!]

[Those Taekwondo Club members, who were mocking Wang Xian previously, just got a tight slap to their faces. If their Coach isn’t a match for Wang Xian, how are they qualified to mock him?]

The updates continued and many had pictures attached.

That student blacked out. He couldn’t hide it! This incident couldn’t be hidden anymore.

“I’m sorry, Wang Xian, I’m sorry!”

At this moment, in the ring, Coach Yan brought Xu Qingcheng over, bowed and apologized.

This action stunned the crowd once again.

Wang Xian frowned upon seeing their actions. He didn’t say another word and headed for the exit.

Behind him, Wang Dahai followed behind excitedly. Even he had not expected things to have developed in such a manner.

Wang Xian strolled towards the exit under the gaze of the crowd.

When he reached the exit, he suddenly stopped.

He lifted his head and saw a signboard three meters above the door. On the signboard were two words: “Taekwondo Club.” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

He smirked.

Coach Yan had rushed over to apologize to him personally. He was a coach and was acting respectfully towards Wang Xian. This made it hard for Wang Xian to press on the matter.

However, he wasn’t pleased with Xu Qingcheng and the club members.

When he walked in, they were all looking at him with despisement.

Taekwondo Club!

Wang Xian smirked. To the astonishment of the crowd, he jumped lightly and smashed violently at the signboard with a kick!

Bam!

Shattered!
