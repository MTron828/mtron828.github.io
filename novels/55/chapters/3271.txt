“Kill, Kill, Kill!”

The Great Beings of the Devil Dragon Bloodline, Fire Dragon Palace, and Red Gold Battle Dragon let out furious roars. They condensed their laws into a powerful defense.

At this time, they could only retreat to the back of the Dragon Palace if they could defend against the attacks of the weak knights.

Otherwise, with their strength, they would be killed before they could retreat.

Now that all the god Emperor level disciples had died, they couldn’t afford to lose more. Otherwise, the entire devil dragon lineage would be finished.

Many universe knights and above were defending.

And an lie was hunting while they were defending.

“The other universe knights can let the people of the three dragon palaces go, but we definitely can’t let Fire Dragon Master Go in.”

An lie scanned his surroundings and transmitted his voice to the Knights from the Dragon Palace and the Water Dragon Palace.

The Dragon Palace could prevent others from entering. Even Wang Xian could not enter the Dragon Palace.

However, an lie was different. He could enter the Dragon Palace easily.

However, if the Fire Dragon Master entered the Fire Dragon Palace, with the Fire Dragon Master’s control over the Dragon Palace, an lie would not be able to kill him.

He could even use the power of the palace to kill him.

Hence, he could not let fire dragon master enter his palace.

As for the rest, an lie did not care. Even if Devil Dragon King entered the dark world, he could still kill him with his strange methods.

After all, he was only a level five knight.

“OK!”

Ao qitian, Mu Zesen, and the others heard an Lie’s words and understood what he meant.

“Attack Fire Dragon Master!”

The next moment, they gave up on all the knights in front of them and charged towards fire dragon master.

Right now, the sky array was fighting fire dragon master.

In the Dragon Palace, there were only nine knights with level 5 strength. This time, only seven came.

Ao Jin and Lei Ming didn’t come.

Little Blue had the power of a universe Knight Level 5. Together with AO qitian, Ao Qi, Ao Tu, and the other leaders of the Dragon Palace, they attacked Fire Dragon Master.

“HM?”

“Attack Fire Dragon Master!”

Water Dragon King and the others narrowed their eyes and attacked the opponent in front of them.

“HM?”

Devil Dragon King was also stunned.

“PFFT!” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

At this moment, a terrifying energy attacked him.

The Demon Dragon King’s body trembled, and black bricks appeared around him, enveloping his entire body.

“Bang!”

Even so, a terrifying energy landed on his dragon head, causing him to spit out large mouthfuls of blood.

“What a strange fellow, what a terrifying attack!”

The Demon Dragon King’s eyes revealed a look of fear.

If it wasn’t for the acquired Supreme Treasure protecting his body, this attack would have taken half of his life.

Even so, he was still heavily injured.

“Damn it, run!”

The Demon Dragon King’s expression was extremely ugly as he hurriedly ran back.

The Water Dragon King was no longer attacking him. At this time, survival was more important.

Otherwise, even if that strange guy attacked him a few times, he didn’t dare to guarantee that he would be able to withstand it.

“Retreat, Retreat, Retreat!”

He roared and fled toward wind and thunder god Dragon Palace.

“Retreat!”

The Great Beings of the Devil Dragon bloodline were delighted when they saw that water dragon palace and Dragon Palace weren’t attacking them, and they hurriedly fled.

“Damn it!”

However, at this moment, Fire Dragon Master’s expression changed drastically when he saw the situation.

In an instant, 14 universe knights and level five Great Beings attacked him.

There were dozens of universe knight level four great beings attacking him from a distance.

Although they couldn’t cause him much harm, he couldn’t ignore them completely.

Plus the array master from Dragon Palace, he was suppressed in an instant.

After all, they were the elites of Water Dragon Palace and Dragon Palace, and there were two pure-blooded godly dragons, water dragon emperor and Water Dragon Queen.

Each of them had two true treasures.

“Fire Dragon Emperor!”

The leader of Fire Cloud Army and Dragon Eagle Army was shocked when they saw fire dragon emperor being attacked.

“Retreat! All of you, Retreat! Fire Dragon Emperor, hold on for a few seconds and then retreat!”

Devil Dragon Emperor looked around and ordered loudly.

At this time, as long as Fire Dragon Emperor could hold on for seven or eight seconds, the rest of the universe knights would be able to retreat into Dragon Palace.

“Retreat!”

The expressions of the Warriors of Fire Dragon Palace changed, they gritted their teeth and retreated into the palace.

Even the leader of Fire Cloud Dragon Eagle flew back.

At this time, there was nothing they could do.

If they stayed here for another second, they might be hunted by that strange being.

They were afraid too.

Furthermore, Devil Dragon Emperor had given the order, they had no choice but to follow.

“Damn it!”

Fire Dragon Master saw everyone from the three Dragon Palace retreat, and his face was extremely ugly. He roared furiously.

A Flame Pagoda above his head immediately released a terrifying fire meteorite.

“Surround and kill him, we must kill him!”

The sky array roared, and one formation after another attacked the acquired Supreme Treasure.

“Kill, Kill, Kill!”

Water Dragon King and the others also shouted and used the acquired true treasure to unleash their strongest attacks.

“Okay, as long as we kill Fire Dragon Master and Dragon King kills Devil Dragon Emperor, everything will be easy.”

An Lie’s eyes were shining with a cold light as he locked his eyes on Fire Dragon Master.

Buzz

In the next moment, he appeared on fire dragon master’s tail.

“Boom!”

A terrifying attack landed on the fire dragon Lord’s tail, and blood splattered everywhere.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

“You Damned Flea, get lost!”

The Fire Dragon Lord was in pain. He roared and swept his tail across.

“Attack!”

Ao Qitian, Mou Zesen, AO xingmu, and the others immediately attacked.

Terrifying attacks covered him.

“SH * t!”

The Fire Dragon Lord’s expression changed drastically at the sight of these terrifying attacks.

Even the array formation master of the Dragon Palace and the experts like the Water Dragon King were not afraid at all. The Fire Dragon Lord had a strong confidence that he could escape.

However, with the existence of that Strange Fellow, he had to protect his entire body at all times to prevent himself from being attacked.

This put him in a completely passive situation. It was even very difficult for him to escape.

“If I keep fighting, I might die here.”

The Fire Dragon Lord’s expression changed dramatically. Terrifying Flames burned on his body as he retreated.

“Wu Wu Wu!”

At this moment, Little Blue’s voice sounded, and a strange space invaded the entire starry sky.

“What?”

The Fire Dragon Lord’s expression changed when he saw that he had suddenly entered a strange space.

“Kill!”

The sky array, the experts of the Dragon Palace, the Water Dragon King, and the others attacked again.

An Lie’s figure flickered as he waited for an opportunity to move.
