Chapter 1426: On the layout of 1426

Colorful demonic beasts floated in the sky and scanned their surroundings coldly.

In the center, the leader of the Demonic Beasts, who was five to six meters tall, stared at the area in front of him with a cold expression.

“Which force are you?”

The leader of the Demonic Beasts in the center spoke in human language and asked coldly.

“What kind of demonic beasts are you? Why did you intrude into the territory of the Dragon Palace?”

Nine flood dragons slowly appeared in the sight of the demonic beasts. Around them, demonic monkeys and thunder prawns slowly surrounded them.

Wang Xian sat on the dragon throne. His gaze swept across the demonic beasts in front of him as he asked indifferently.

“What are you trying to do by surrounding us?”

A demonic beast swayed its colorful body as it shouted sternly.

“Shut up. You are not qualified to let the two leaders speak!”

“Whoosh!”

Mou Zesen’s cold voice sounded. A terrifying arrow swept up the seawater and headed straight for the demonic beast.

The powerful force caused the faces of all the members of the Demonic Beast clan to change drastically.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

The expression of a demonic beast not far away from the leader of the Central Demonic Beast clan changed slightly.

His body size was similar to that of the leader of the Central Demonic Beast clan. When he saw the incoming arrow, his pupils constricted slightly, and his entire body fluttered.

One by one, seaweed shot into the sky and coiled around the arrow.

“Boom!”

A violent explosion sounded in the middle of the area.

Even though it was more than 20,000 meters deep at the bottom of the sea, waves of water were still surging.

The expression of the demonic beast who spoke earlier changed drastically. His eyes were filled with fear.

“We are a race of colorful algae demonic beasts. I didn’t know this was the land of Your Dragon Palace. How Offensive!”

When the leader of the demonic beasts who was floating in the middle saw the explosion in front of him, his expression changed slightly. He swept his gaze across the members of the Dragon Palace who were surrounding them and spoke to Wang Xian warily.

“Are you guys from the human-demon graveyard?”

Wang Xian looked at this demonic beast race with great interest and asked with a smile.

“Yes. If our species of colorful algae demonic beasts disturb you, we will leave immediately!”

The leader of the colorful algae demonic beasts said with a twinkle in his eyes.

“The entire sea area, apart from the human-demon graveyard, is already under the control of our Dragon Palace!”

Wang Xian stared at the leader of the colorful algae-like demonic beasts and continued with a smile, “I’m very curious. What happened in the human-demon graveyard that made you guys come here?”

“Did you come here to hunt other demonic beasts or?”

“These matters don’t seem to have anything to do with you guys!”

The leader of the colorful algae-like demonic beasts said directly with an unpleasant expression.

Boom

As soon as he finished his sentence, the surrounding members of the Dragon Palace raised their weapons and unleashed all of their auras.

There were more than a thousand insightful emptiness realm experts and more than a thousand half-step insightful emptiness realm experts.

When this aura came pressing down on the more than a thousand colorful algae demonic beasts, the entire space froze.

The pupils of the more than a thousand colorful algae demonic beasts contracted slightly as they swayed their bodies in panic.

Even the leader in the middle was trembling slightly.

Wang Xian stared at the leader of the colorful algae demonic beasts and smiled. “Look at your own situation. If we want to destroy you, it will be easy!”

“Phew!”

The leader of the colorful algae took a deep breath. With an embarrassed expression, he lowered his head slowly. “There’s a huge change in the human-demon graveyard. A group of demonic beasts are fighting!”

“The Blood Barbaric Demon Beast Race wants to establish an empire. All the Demon Beast races will join the Empire!”

“Some Demon Beast races don’t want to be controlled. They don’t agree. They want to establish an empire. Each race will establish their own empire, but a few top-tier demon beast races don’t agree!”

“A few top-tier demon beast races are fighting for the throne of the empire. It’s a mess. They’ve only stabilized a little in the past few days, but the result is not what we, the second-tier Demon Beast races, want to see!”

“That’s why I brought my clansmen here and prepared to hide!”

As the leader of the colorful algae demonic beast spoke, he raised his head and looked at Wang Xian. Finally, he said, “We didn’t mean to offend you!”

“Establish an empire? Empire? Then, what was the situation in the human-demon graveyard before you left?”

Wang Xian asked in puzzlement.

“A few major races have established an empire. The strong ones will sit on the throne and all the demonic beasts will be able to participate. The strong ones will be respected!”

The leader of the colorful algae demonic beasts said with a serious expression.

“Oh? That’s very fair. The strong ones will be respected!”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and said with a smile.

It was very fair to the top-tier demonic beast races. However, it was not very fair to the rest of the demonic beast races.

Once the Empire was established, the rest of the demonic beast races would become subjects! Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

There were nearly a hundred demonic beast races of various sizes in the human-demon graveyard.

As he spoke, his gaze swept across all the members of the colorful algae-type demonic beast race. His eyes sparkled.

The strength of the demonic beast race that came from the human-demon graveyard was only inferior to those top-tier races.

There were more than a thousand members. The weakest among them was at level seven of the supernatural realm.

If he could subdue them, it would greatly enhance the strength of the Dragon Palace.

“Since you guys from the colorful algae-type demonic beast race have come out from the human-demon graveyard, why don’t you join our Dragon Palace?”

Wang Xian said with a smile.

“What?”

“That’s impossible. We will definitely not listen to anyone’s orders!”

The two colorful algae demon beasts, who were at level five of the Seethrough realm, roared furiously when they heard Wang Xian’s words.

“I can bring you guys to the Dragon Palace to take a look. After that, you can make your choice. It’s useless to reject now!”

Wang Xian looked at them with a smile.

All the members of the Dragon Palace were closing in on them by a few hundred meters. Their intentions were very obvious.

If they didn’t agree, then they would take action.

This made all the members of the colorful algae demonic beast clan look extremely embarrassed.

The leader of the colorful algae demonic beast scanned his surroundings and his heart sank.

They had really entered the dragon’s lair the moment they were out of the Tiger’s Den!

“Alright!”

The leader of the colorful algae demonic beast had no idea what to do. He replied with an embarrassed expression.

“Alright, follow us. Don’t think of escaping!”

As Wang Xian spoke, he waved his arm and the five elements millstone appeared in the ocean.

Buzz

The five elements millstone covered an area of two kilometers and enveloped the entire multi-colored algae demonic beast clan.

“What is this?”

“Hiss, what a terrifying force!”

“This... that human is so strong!”

The members of the colorful algae beast group were shocked when they saw the five elements grinding mill above their heads.

The leader of the colorful algae beast group also narrowed his eyes and glanced around helplessly.

It was over!

“Go!”

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”!

The nine flood dragons roared and flew toward the Dragon Palace.

A powerful beast clan didn’t even have the strength to resist the power of the Dragon Palace.

After that, they could only survive if they joined the Dragon Palace.

The expansion of all the forces was filled with tyranny and blood.

The Dragon Palace was the same!

However, it might not be a bad thing for the colorful algae Demon Beast clan!
