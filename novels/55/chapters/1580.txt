Chapter 1581: Dragon 1581 has a reverse scale 4

Dragon has a reverse scale!

Anyone who touches it will die!

Wang Xian stood there with killing intent surging in his eyes. His gaze was fixed on everyone in the Bingxin Empire. Violence was brewing in his eyes.

Everyone around was discussing in shock.

No one expected that Ling Jian ‘er, who had obtained the title of the Supreme Leader, would be betrothed to the young master of Ao Tian by the Bingxin Empire.

When Ling Jian ‘er heard her master and the Bingxin King’s words, her face was also filled with shock and astonishment.

“Sister Jian ‘er, you are the most outstanding woman I have ever seen. Marry me, and I will let you enjoy the blessings of the heavens. I will let you become the most dazzling woman in the vast region!”

At this moment, ao Tian was looking at Ling Jian ‘er with a face full of smiles and confidence.

As he spoke, he slowly spread his arms and gave off a domineering aura, “In the future, you will be the female owner of this sky!”

“Hiss!”

The surrounding 100,000 people sucked in a breath of cold air when they heard young master ao Tian’s declaration.

Almost all the girls looked at Ling Jian ‘er with envy.

However, Ling Jian ‘ER’s expression was getting uglier and uglier.

She glanced at ao Tian and her gaze landed on the people from the icy heart empire.

“I don’t agree. I will make my own decisions!”

Her cold voice sounded.

“What!”

“This...”

When Ling Jian ‘er’s voice sounded, everyone from the icy heart empire had a huge change in expression. The people around them were also stunned and their eyes were shining with a strange light.

Ao Tian, who was standing at the side, was slightly stunned. The arrogant expression on his face instantly froze.

He turned to Ling Jian ‘er and glared at her with a pair of angry eyes.

“Jian ‘er, don’t mess around. Marriage is a major event. It is the Order of your parents. Furthermore, foster father and master are doing this for your own good!”

When the king of Bingxin heard Ling Jian ‘ER’s words, his expression changed slightly as he spoke in a domineering manner.

“Bing Qiankun, Bing FAWU, is this your decision?”

Wang Xian stared at the king of Bingxin and the white-haired old man. He called them by their names and questioned them in a cold tone.

When the king of Bingxin and the white-haired old man heard Wang Xian’s cold words, they frowned slightly and their expressions changed slightly.

When everyone around saw this situation, their faces were filled with astonishment as they looked around.

No one had expected such a situation to happen.

“Priest Wang, Jian ‘er’s marriage was decided after careful consideration by us. Let’s give her a better life!”

“My Bingxin Empire and my Bingqian Kun have many daughters. They are all as beautiful as flowers. You can choose any one of them!”

“Furthermore, as long as priest Wang likes any of the beauties in the entire Bingxin Empire, I will make the decision for you!”

The king of Bingxin squeezed out a smile and said to Wang Xian.

“Haha, almost everyone knows that I, Wang Xian, came to the vast area from the flowing sea region to look for Jian ‘er!”

“You guys are forcing me now!”

Wang Xian laughed out loud. His voice was filled with coldness. He sighed slowly at the last sentence.

“I already have someone in my heart!”

Ling Jian ‘er stood on the heaven’s pride stage and shifted her gaze away from Wang Xian. She looked at the king of Bingxin and said calmly.

“The Bingxin Empire!”

Ling Jian ‘ER’s words and Wang Xian’s words caused the two supreme elders of the solitaire sect to turn gloomy instantly.

They looked at Ao Tian who was standing there with endless fury in his eyes. Their eyes were also filled with coldness and anger.

The bingxin empire had said that they would betroth Bing Jian ‘er to the son of their supreme leader.

But now, they didn’t agree.

This was a slap to the face of the only sect!

This was a violation of the dignity of the only sect!

“Supreme elders, leave this matter to the Ice Heart Dynasty!”

The white-haired elder Bing Fa didn’t feel the anger of the supreme elder of the only sect. His face changed greatly and he quickly said.

Ao Tian on the prodigy stage slowly raised his head and stood there expressionlessly looking down at everything.

“Jian ‘er, we have already made the decision on this matter. We are doing this for your own good. The matter is settled!”

“In the future, you will marry into the only sect and become the wife of Young Master Ao Tian. Cherish this opportunity!”

Bing FA Wu’s expression also turned cold as he ordered Ling Jian ‘ER.

“As for priest Wang, this matter is the matter of our Bingxin dynasty. It is not something you can participate in!”

“But don’t worry, our Bingxin Empire will give you sufficient compensation!”

Bing FA Wu said as he looked at the long-haired elder beside him.

“This is how the matter is decided. No one can change it!”

The long-haired elder announced with a gloomy face.

“Old Geezer, how can the matter of Jian ‘er be decided by you two?”

As soon as the two of them finished speaking, Wang Xian’s somewhat savage voice sounded.

“Bastard!”

When Bing FA Wu and the long-haired elder heard Wang Xian’s words, their faces instantly turned furious.

“Priest Wang, if it weren’t for the fact that you healed me, I would have been able to kill you if you had said those words!”

Bing FA Wu growled at him with a face full of anger.

“Old Man, do you know that I was the one who helped you expel the dark soul in your body?”

“How could the Bingxin Empire do such an ungrateful thing?”

Wang Xian raised his head and stared at Bing FA Wu.

“You...”

Bing FA Wu’s face turned red when he heard his words.

“Shut up. This is a matter of our bingxin empire. You are just a priest. You Don’t have the right to interfere in our matters!”

“Don’t think that you are the number one priest and you dare to be so arrogant to our Bingxin Empire!”

“Let me tell you, Jian ‘er is lucky to be able to marry young master ao Tian. Compared to Young Master Ao Tian, you are like a firefly competing with the Bright Moon!”

At this moment, Bing Jinghuan, who was standing at the side, had a ferocious look on his face. He was gloating as he shouted at Wang Xian.

While Bing Jinghuan was shouting, the people from the Bingxin Empire did not stop him.

When Wang Xian heard his words, a smile appeared on his face instead.

He had already made a decision in his heart.

“I don’t agree!”

On the Heaven’s pride stage, Ling Jian ‘ER said with a determined gaze.

She looked at Wang Xian and moved!

However, just as Ling Jian ‘er was about to fly towards Wang Xian, Young Master Ao Tian took out a round ball from his hand.

The round ball enveloped the heaven’s pride stage. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Ling Jian ‘ER’s expression changed. There was no fluctuation at all when she crashed into the formation.

“Ao Tian, release Jian ‘er!”

Wang Xian saw it and the terrifying killing intent that he was suppressing erupted. He shouted loudly.

“There is nothing that I, ao Tian, can not get!”

He looked down at Wang Xian with a domineering expression. The corners of his mouth curled up slightly as he looked at Ling Jian ‘er who was at the side.

“Such an outstanding lady is only worthy of me, ao Tian. No one else is worthy of her!”

As he spoke, he turned his gaze to everyone in the Bingxin Empire.

“Bingxin Empire, I hope that all of you can settle this successfully!”

“I don’t want to fight!”

He stood there arrogantly and said faintly.

“Don’t worry, Young Master Ao Tian!”

The king of Bingxin immediately cupped his hands and said firmly.
