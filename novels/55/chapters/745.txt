Chapter 746: 0747 in a panic assassination (4/5)

Translator: 549690339

Late at night, four to five hours.

For people who slept, four to five hours was very short, but for an infant realm expert, four to five hours was enough to do a lot of things!

In mixed Yuan City, soundless and soundless sounds filled the entire city.

What was brought was corpses.

Five hundred meters away from the city of primordial chaos, more than a hundred people were standing on the road.

“Bang!”

At this moment, a corpse suddenly landed on the ground with a loud sound

“Hiss!”

“This is the eleventh corpse. This is an elder of the primordial immortal sect!”

The experts of the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect looked at the corpse on the ground and sucked in a breath of cold air. A hint of terror appeared in their eyes.

That’s right, it was fear.

Even if the corpses were their enemies, they still felt fear.

Looking at the city in front of them, it was as if it was a ferocious beast that was devouring people.

That terrifying formless and shadowless creature quietly attacked and killed eleven infant realm experts of the Hunyuan Immortal sect within a short two to three hours in the huge city.

This was an infant realm expert!

“If you make an enemy out of such an existence, you might not even know how you died!”

The members of the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect felt their scalps go numb.

“Fortunately, we are not enemies. The Dragon Gate is really too terrifying!”

Elder Feng’s eyes flickered as he said to Mo Qinglong.

“Hehe, it will be bright in a while. Give the Chaos Origin Immortal sect a big gift!”

Mo Qinglong smiled faintly. There were more than a hundred of such terrifying creatures in the Dragon Palace!

“If the Hunyuan Immortal sect sees these corpses, they will probably despair!”

Elder Feng could already imagine the reactions of everyone in the Hunyuan Immortal sect. He looked forward with some anticipation.

The sky gradually brightened.

In front of Mo Qinglong and the others, there were a total of seventeen corpses.

Among them, there were fourteen corpses of infant realm experts and three corpses of the Hunyuan Immortal Sect’s outstanding heaven chosen disciples!

“Hang them on the mountain peak on the right!”

Mo Qinglong looked around and waved his arm, bringing one corpse after another to the mountain peak on the left.

That was a rather conspicuous place. Even in the Hunyuan city, if one looked carefully, they would be able to see it.

He believed that this great gift was enough to cause the entire chaos origin immortal sect to boil!

“Cowardly disciples of the Turtle Immortal Sect, get up. Don’t cower in a turtle shell!”

The Sun had just risen, and an angry roar was transmitted into the city.

“Bastards, this group of Damn Fellows. F * ck him...% ...% @%”

“Weren’t you the ones who were scolded yesterday? If I didn’t go out, you wouldn’t dare to come in. But I can still scold you!”

“Go, go, Motherf * cker, let’s properly greet their eighteen generations of ancestors today!”

Furious curses quickly came from the chaos origin immortal sect. The Immortal sect disciples flew directly to the city gate and prepared to curse!

“I’ll give you a big gift. Please look at the mountain on the right. hahaha!”

The youth’s Loud Laughter was heard!

“I’ll give your grandmother my foot. If you have the guts to enter our city, I guarantee... cough cough cough cough cough...”

An irascible young man directly spat at that person loudly. However, when he looked at the mountain on the right from the corner of his eyes, he was instantly stunned.

His eyes widened and his teeth began to tremble. His face was filled with fear.

The dozens of youths in the surroundings also looked over in bewilderment. However, in an instant, it was as if an icy spring had surged into his heart, causing them to feel their breathing quicken.

“Hu hu, impossible, this is impossible!”

“You... you have entered the city. You... No, no, this is impossible. It must be fake, it must be fake!”

When the dozens of youths saw the corpses on the mountain peak, they nearly collapsed on the spot. One by one, they cried out involuntarily.

“Haha, You Say We Don’t dare to enter the city? Do you recognize the people above us? !”

When the youth saw their expressions, he revealed an excited expression.

The two immortals had been fighting for hundreds of years. Now that the Chaos Origin Immortal sect had suffered heavy losses, it was something that the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect was most willing to see.

Seeing their panic and fear, the youth was extremely excited.

“Not good, something has happened to the elders and deacons!”

At this time, the dozens of young men completely ignored the young man’s mockery.

They all shouted into the city in panic, their voices trembling.

They were dead. Fourteen elders and deacons were all killed overnight.

In addition to the fourteen nascent realm experts, there were also the most outstanding disciples of the Chaos Origin Immortal sect.

This filled their hearts with panic.

They had actually entered the Hunyuan city last night and had even killed their elders and deacons.

What frightened them the most was that no one had noticed and no battle had occurred.

What kind of existence was it that could kill so many of their experts in one night.

The panicked cries immediately attracted the attention of everyone in the Hunyuan City.

All the disciples of Chaos Origin Immortal sect were slightly stunned.

“Something happened. What Happened?”

“What’s Going On!”

One by one, experts who had reached the Dan stage flew over with faces full of shock.

“Look over there, quickly look over there!”

A young man pointed at the mountain peak on the right with a face full of fear.

The corpse that was hung on it made their hearts shiver.

“What?”

Everyone looked over and instantly felt their scalps go numb!

“How is this possible? They entered our primordial city?”

“There wasn’t any fighting last night. How could it be? How could a group of elders and deacons be assassinated? They are at the infant realm!”

“Who is it? Could it be that the immortal God acted last night to assassinate us? No, no, the immortal God should be able to sense the immortal God’s actions!”

The Disciples of the Chaos Origin Immortal sect opened their eyes wide and shouted in shock.

“Report to the immortal God immediately!”

A Dan stage expert moved and flew towards the immortal sect with a face full of panic.

“Something has happened! Something has happened!”

More and more chaos origin city’s immortal sect disciples rushed over when they heard the terrified screams. When they saw the corpse on the mountain peak, their bodies went numb.

Panic quickly spread toward the city.

In just one night, such an immortal sect expert had died, and they didn’t even know how the other party had attacked.

This made them feel terrified. If the other party had come to assassinate them, then their corpses would have already been hung on the city wall! Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

At this moment, three immortal god experts emitting terrifying auras instantly flew over.

“You’re courting death!”

A fierce roar resounded throughout the entire chaos origin city.

They were furious!

When the three immortal gods of the Chaos Origin Immortal sect saw the corpses on the mountain peak, their faces revealed furious expressions.

Seventeen corpses and fourteen elders and deacons had once again cut off more than half of the power of the Chaos Origin Immortal sect.

Presently, the entire immortal sect only had ten plus infant realm experts left.
