Chapter 87: Ren Anzhi’s Actions

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

Ren Anzhi was feeling despair and had been irritated these past few days.

When he recalled what had happened the few nights before, he felt immense fear.

His Elixir Field was destroyed, and now, he had become a useless man. The one who ruined him was a Half-step to Inborn Expert.

He shuddered at the thought of the old man and the young man.

He told his father, the current Master of Ren Family.

When his father heard about this incident, he almost killed him to make amends with that expert. But under the persuasion of his mother, his father gave up the thought eventually.

His father wanted to bring him along and apologize to them. But he gave up the thought as his father did not wish for anyone in the family to find out about this.

If other elders in the family found out that he’d gotten into trouble with such a formidable expert, he would be beaten to death to atone for his sins even if his father did not do so.

Blood and brutality filled the world of Ancient Martial Arts.

Even though Ren Anzhi escaped the calamity, his cultivation was totally ruined. Initially, he had the chance to inherit the family as the leader. But now, it was completely out of the question.

His Elixir Field was completely destroyed, and it was only possible to recover with the help of an Inborn Expert and some medicine.

Obviously, the Ren Family was not capable of inviting an Inborn Expert to treat him.

After he lost all his cultivation, he was sent to one of the organizations in the family to manage some businesses.

“Damm, if it was not for those two idiots, would I have ended up in such a state?”

Ren Anzhi was sitting in the office, staring at his computer. When he recalled what happened that day, he was fuming.

If it was not for those two idiotic brothers-in-law, how would he have ended up in such a state?

However, the two of them were also leading a tough life. Their limbs were crippled, and they had to spend the rest of their lives in wheelchairs.

Besides, his brother-in-law’s family also compensated him with half of their assets.

However, no matter how much money they compensated him with, it could never be enough in exchange for his cultivation.

Buzz!

Just when Ren Anzhi was feeling vexed, the phone suddenly rang. He displayed an impatient look when he saw the caller’s name on the phone.

“Speak out now!” Ren Anzhi screamed with an unpleasant expression.

“Director Ren, I’m sorry to disturb you. Something happened in our showroom. Someone smashed five of our Bentleys. Five of them! That person even taunted us.”

“What?”

Director Cui’s voice stunned Ren Anzhi for a while. He raised his voice with rage, “Has the person left?” Ren Anzhi darkened his expression as he asked with radiance flickering in his eyes.

“Not yet, Director Ren. He’s still in the showroom.”

“Great, I’ll be there. God damm it. He’s asking for it!”

Ren Anzhi revealed a killing expression. He was feeling grumpy, yet, someone dared to make trouble in his showroom. That person was going to be a piece of dead meat.

“In the entire Rivertown, everyone knew that the Rivertown 4S showroom had the backing of the Ren Family. What a fuc*ing fellow.”

Ren Anzhi stood up immediately with a cold expression as he walked to the showroom.

He was going to teach that outrageous fellow a hell of a lesson.

“Lad, you’re doomed. I’ll make sure you regret what you did for the rest of your life. Just you wait. You’re dead!”

Back at the 4S Automobile Showroom, Director Cui spoke to Wang Xian with a hideous look once he got the reply from Director Ren.

“Director Cui, who did you call just now?” Young Master Lin asked with doubt when he heard how Director Cui addressed the person on the line.

“I called Director Ren, the son of the Ren Family,” Director Cui answered. He continued coldly, “Director Ren will be here in no time. You are dead.”

“The son of the Ren Family?” Young Master Lin was surprised as fear filled his eyes.

Ren Family was a huge and influential family in Rivertown. Lin Family was far more inferior to them. The son of the Ren Family was definitely not someone he could compare with either.

“Director Ren will be here in no time. You’re dead!” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Young Master Lin looked at Wang Xian as though he was a dead man.

The pretty girl beside Young Master Lin grabbed his arm and scorned at Wang Xian. “Lad, you’re too arrogant. You actually bashed their cars when they didn’t want your business. How ill-educated you are!”

Wang Xian swept his cold gazes when he heard them. His flickering gaze fixed on the pretty girl and Young Master Lin.

Just then, a voice suddenly cut the air before the person could arrive. “Who the hell dares to create trouble in the Ren Family’s turf? Are you sick of living?”

When Director Cui heard the voice, his eyes flashed with happiness as he hurried over to greet the person.

“Director Ren, that fellow is inside. He’s simply too arrogant. He bashed our cars when we didn’t want to sell the car to him. Director Ren, you must teach him a lesson!” Director Cui explained as he ran.

With a cigarette in between his fingers, Ren Anzhi was looking cold as he saw Director Cui running to him. He nodded his head and walked inside.

After he entered the showroom, he froze when he saw a young man, leaning haughtily against a Bentley.

“Hello, Young Master Ren. I’m Lin Feng.” When Young Master Lin saw Ren Anzhi, he quickly went over and greeted him.

Yet, Ren Anzhi could not hear what Lin Feng was talking about now.

He could see darkness in front of him as if he had fallen into the abyss.

This young man, this young man.

He would never forget him.

His serene smile.

His taunting look in the eyes.

He recalled that night when even that domineering Half-step to Inborn Expert had to listen to his commands.

He felt suffocated.

Why, why is it him?

How could I be so pitiful that I have to meet this devil-like young man again?

Ren Anzhi shuddered in his shoes when he saw the curious and playful look in that young man’s eyes.

“Director Ren, he’s the one who smashed five of our cars.” Director Cui pointed at Wang Xian as he howled angrily to Ren Anzhi.

Ren Anzhi paused his breathing, and his expression changed dramatically when he heard Director Cui.

“Fuc* you! Are you trying to get me killed?”

Ren Anzhi jumped up and slapped Director Cui hard on his face.

He almost exerted all his force on it. If his Internal Energy was still around, Director Cui could be dead with that slap.

Ren Anzhi looked at Wang Xian with bitterness as he trotted over.

Boom!

Next, Ren Anzhi did something that shocked everyone.

He ran over and knelt in front of that young man.

That’s right. He knelt, and the sound of getting down on his knees was loud.

Everyone was blown away by Ren Anzhi’s series of actions.

He slapped Director Cui hard.

Then, he ran over and knelt before the young man.

He was the Young Master of the Ren Family; the son of the leader of Ren Family.

Moreover, the Ren Family was ranked as the number two Ancient Martial Artist Family in Rivertown.

Yet, when he was confronted by the young man who smashed their cars, he actually ran over and got down on his knees!

He got down on his knees!
