Translator: Larbrestudio

A flourishing age was about to begin!

Ka ka ka!

When Wang Xian was flying towards Mt. Taibai, a terrifying event was happening in the sky above Mt. Taibai.

Sounds of space cracking resounded, alerting all the martial artists who were cultivating.

It had been half a month since the battle on Mt. Taibai. At this moment, several hundreds of thousands of people were scattered densely across the mountain.

Among these hundreds of thousands of people, there was a large number of wealthy people and members of some clans that had just entered the Ancient Martial Arts world.

With several hundreds of thousands of people occupying this space, there were lots of people becoming martial artists or powerful Inborn experts each day!

Practicing martial arts could also strengthen one’s body.

Once, many people didn’t know how. With the spiritual energy waterfall falling on their bodies now, everyone could become a powerful martial artist!

“What’s happening?”

The cracking sounds in the air stunned everyone below the spiritual energy waterfall. All of them lifted their heads while staring into the sky.

“Oh gosh!”

“What’s happening? The sky is breaking up!”

“This... The space has been ripped apart!”

“What’s the situation? What’s happening!”

When the martial artists below the spiritual energy waterfall saw a crack that appeared across the sky suddenly, all of them were astonished. Some martial artists retreated in fear immediately.

In the blink of an eye, the entire region became chaotic.

Huh?

Xiao Xian, Lan Qingyue and the other three lifted their heads and squinted their eyes. Based on what Xiao Xian had said, the people from the Nine Cauldron Worlds must have arrived before the estimated date!

“Be careful!”

The five girls stared at the sky vigilantly.

Ka ka ka!

Before the astonished eyes of the crowd, a large crack was ripped open in the space above them.

The entire crack reached an astounding range of a hundred meters.

“Another sky. There’s another sky on the other end!”

At this moment, an Inborn expert exclaimed loudly in shock.

From the crack in the space that was ripped open, they could see another world! This terrified a large number of people.

“What’s really happening? Could it be that aliens are invading our world?” a young man mumbled while watching in astonishment.

“Is this one of the Nine Cauldron Worlds that Brother Wang Xian mentioned previously?”

Sui Huang and Xiao Quanshan exchanged glances before turning their attention to the crack.

“Someone has come out from the crack...”

Another exclamation reverberated as everyone’s eyes couldn’t help but constrict.

From the other world, another human had appeared.

“There are lots of them!”

A light flickered in Xiao Yu’s eyes as he stared intensely at the people from one of the Nine Cauldron Worlds.

Haha!

After a peal of laughter, a man emerged from the crack on a sword. The spiritual sword made an arc in the air as he laughed loudly. “The new world! I’m finally here!”

“Flying on a sword? Is that an Immortal?”

Seeing the figure that flew out from the crack on a sword, many martial artists were astounded.

Swish swish swish!

At this moment, experts wearing green and white outfits flew out from the crack on their swords one after another.

Soon, there were close to four to five hundred people.

“The crack is healing. There are so many of them! Roughly five hundred!”

When Xiao Xian saw the martial artists that had arrived on their swords resembling immortals, she was astounded.

“They are finally here! I wonder what changes they will bring to the real world. No one could really know what this group of people will do!”

“Luckily, there aren’t any Immortal Realm experts!”

Sun Lingxiu’s eyes flickered as she looked at the group of people standing in the air.

Five hundred-odd people wasn’t a small number.

Their green and white outfits fluttered in the wind and each of them stood proudly in the air.

“There are quite a number of people here! Are these the martial artists of the current Underworld?”

The first person who emerged from the crack made a circle while observing the new world with interest.

Below him, all the martial artists were silent as they stared blankly at him.

The five-hundred odd experts who were standing on their swords in the air looked around them. This was also their first time in this world.

“We are from the Huang Cauldron world. Get someone who can make a decision to speak to us!”

An old man looked down while standing on his spiritual sword and questioning in a solemn tone.

All the martial artists were taken aback and turned their attention to where Xiao Yu, Lan Qingyue, and the girls were at.

Everyone in the Underworld knew who they were and their status. They were the sister and women of the Dragon King.

They were also the strongest among them.

Feeling the gazes from the crowd of martial artists, Xiao Yu and the girls frowned slightly.

“We welcome everyone from the Nine Cauldron Worlds!”

Lan Qingyue took a step forward, clasped her right fist with her left palm and spoke with great composure.

“Eh? You know we are from the Nine Cauldrons Worlds?”

The young man who was flying on his sword steered his sword towards Lan Qingyue, stopped roughly ten meters away, and asked curiously, “Are there people from the other Nine Cauldron Worlds that have appeared in this world?”

“They have not truly shown themselves. I believe you guys are the first batch that has come in such a big group to this world!” Lan Qingyue replied to the young man.

“You are the leader of them? Their ruler?”

The old man in the air moved and appeared beside the young man.

The surrounding martial artists around them that were on their swords looked around curiously while feeling a little overwhelmed.

In the end, all their attention fell on Lan Qingyue, Xiao Yu and the girls. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“We are from the Dragon Sect of the Underworld!” Lan Qingyue said to the old man while also observing the group of people before them.

There were roughly twenty people with strength that was equivalent to hers. As for the rest, they were all Dan Realm experts.

The old man, who was the only one in a golden outfit, made them feel a little wary.

His strength was well hidden and would at least be at the Half-step to Immortal Realm.

What made them feel a little more assured was that this group of people didn’t seem to have come with a vengeance. In addition, none of them were acting as though they were high and mighty kings.

“Dragon Sect? It must be a powerful sect in the Underworld.”

The old man looked across them before looking over to the surrounding crowd of martial artists. He was slightly surprised and commented, “We are from the Yellow Sky Immortal Sect of the Huang Cauldron world.”

Ka ka ka!

Just as the old man finished his words, in the sky a short distance away, sounds of the space breaking could be heard again.

The old man frowned slightly. Those that had come with him were also frowning while their eyes turned as cold as ice.

“It must be those brats from the Primeval Chaos Immortal Sect!”

The young man beside the old man smirked and commented coldly.

The surrounding martial artists of the Underworld were taken aback as they revealed astounded expressions.

There were more people from the Huang Cauldron world that were arriving.

Ka ka!

A golden light appeared across the sky as figure after figure walked out from the crack. All of them lifted their heads arrogantly and were staring at the old man and the group that had arrived moments ago.

“Feng Jinqing, you guys sure are early!”

The golden ray faded gradually and a few hundred figures appeared in the air. They smiled at that old man and remarked plainly.

“You guys aren’t too slow either!” the old man in the golden outfit replied emotionlessly.

“There’s quite a number of people around!”
