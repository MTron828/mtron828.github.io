Chapter 343: Corpse (1)

“A mutated toad?”

Everyone was shocked by the toad that suddenly leaped out. They staggered two steps back as they stared at the mutated toad with vigilance.

Croak!

The toad let out a low cry with its tongue moving slowly while it glared coldly at the group of people.

[Cadaveric Toad: Level 10]

[Unable to extract Dragon Energy]

A message popped out in Wang Xian’s mind. But he realized that this toad was much stronger than those usual Level 10 creatures.

In particular, the long tongue in its mouth looked terrifying.

“A toad that actually grew to a meter in size? What is this? What caused such a horrible transformation in them?”

A middle-aged man was observing the toad.

“Kill it and dissect it!” a Miracle Doctor holding on to his silver needles announced to the group.

Croak!

Just when that Miracle Doctor finished his sentence, the mutated toad moved.

As its four limbs moved, it charged at one Inborn Expert at a terrifying speed.

“Beast, go to hell!”

Those Inborn Experts standing in front were looking cold as they wielded their swords at it.

Four Inborn Experts struck immediately at it while the rest observed the enormous mutated toad from behind.

Bam, Bam, Bam!

“Oh, no!”

As the sharp radiance from the sword struck the body of the mutated toad, not a single trace was left on it.

This caused a drastic change in the expressions of four Inborn Experts who were attacking it.

Hiss!

At this moment, that mutated toad suddenly extended its tongue from two meters to five meters long.

The overcrowding mouthparts were horrifying.

Poof!

The Inborn Expert was appalled when the toad struck at him. He crossed his arms in front of his chest, defending himself with mighty strength.

However, his defense energy was penetrated just like a piece of paper.

At a speed visible to the naked eye, that Inborn Expert’s body shrunk.

Croak!

That terrifying toad was enjoying itself.

“Oh no, that toad has reached Half-Step to Dan Realm!”

The middle-aged man in military uniform was horrified. He quickly waved the saber in his hand, aiming at the tongue of that mutated toad.

“Half-Step to Dan Realm?”

All the Inborn Experts were taken aback by horror. Those experts who had not reached the Inborn Realm quickly stepped back.

“Let’s strike together!”

The middle-aged man in the military uniform shouted immediately when his saber bounced off as soon as it hit the mutated toad’s tongue.

“Attack!”

All the Inborn Experts were surprised by the power of the mutated toad, which had instantly killed an Inborn Expert. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

An Inborn Expert had been killed in a split second with no hope for treatment.

Boom, boom!

The sharp radiance from the swords, fiery whirling weapons, and powerful strikes bombarded the mutated toad.

Croak!

Yet, it ignored all the attacks, assaulting only the middle-aged man in the military uniform.

Boom, boom!

All their strikes left only slight traces on the mutated toad.

“What a dominating defense!”

The surrounding people were horrified. A film of cold sweat was covering the forehead of the middle-aged man in military uniform. “Azure Dragon Saber, slay!”

With both his hands gripping his saber, he blasted a full-blown attack at the mutated toad.

Bam!

The razor-sharp saber, accompanied by Energy of the Gold Summit, only left a half-meter long blood trace on the toad.

Hiss!

The middle-aged man in military uniform leaped and staggered back as he gasped.

“Level 8 weapon and my full-force attack could only leave a slight injury on the mutated toad. What a domineering defense it has. Everyone, watch out!”

“Just now, when my sword hit that fellow’s eyes, it only left a faint trace on it. The defense is simply appalling. There’s no weakness at all!”

Another Inborn Expert stared at the mutated toad with a sword in his hand, looking nasty.

“What a strong mutated toad!”

Bian Yaoquan and the rest of the young and middle-aged men who were not Inborns yet were horrified as a score of Inborn Experts was staring at the mutated toad.

“We’ll trap it. The rest, attack!”

At this time, Sun Lingxiu squinted her eyes as she lifted her palm slowly.

“Ack, ack, let’s kill this thing off now!”

At the same time, Miracle Doctor Blood Man stepped forward with streams of blood flowing down from his feet, spreading rapidly towards the mutated toad.

“Holy Light Trap!”

“Blood Confinement!”

After the soft groan from Sun Lingxiu, Miracle Doctor Blood Man followed suit with a bellow.

White-colored lights criss crossed each other. Crimson bloody aura attached to each light ray, trapping the mutated toad in a red-colored cage.

Bam!

The mutated toad seemed to have no other emotions except banging itself into the cage.

However, the double-binding powers caused the toad to bounce off from the cage.

“Attack!”

The surrounding twenty Inborn Experts grabbed their weapons and wielded them at that mutated toad with strong forces.

Boom, boom!

Every attack the Inborn Experts made seemed to be firing a violent explosion.

Bam, Bam, Bam!

Yet, the mutated toad did not seem to feel the pain as it knocked itself against the surrounding trap violently.

“Oh no, the trap can’t hold any longer!”

At this time, Sun Lingxiu had a change in her expression. The brightness around her intensified as she looked even more like the Goddess of Light.

“Its defense is too domineering. More than a score of Inborn Experts could not inflict serious injuries on it!”

Those people who were not Inborns were appalled when they saw the light injuries on the mutated toad’s body.

“Prison Duo, take my Level 9 weapon, Sky Splitting Blade!”

When Bian Yaoquan saw this from the back, he swung his arm, and a half-meter long weapon appeared in his hand. He yelled at Old Du and flung it.

“Level 9 weapon?”

The surrounding Inborn Experts had a slight change in their expressions. Some of them looked over fervently. Level 9 weapons were incredibly sharp and fearsome.

“Sure!”

Old Du revealed a smile as he reached out his arm and took the Sky Splitting Blade. Drawing a sword radiance that was a few meters long, he encompassed himself in poisonous smoke with a swift move.

Swish!

As the Level 9 weapon cut across, it left an inch-deep wound on the mutated toad.

“Such a sharp weapon. That’s a formidable Level 9 weapon!”

Everyone was astonished by the wound left on the mutated toad, which was deep into the bones.

“Awesome. He carried a Level 9 weapon around with him. Is this how affluent and resourceful Medical Saint Sect is?”

“Young Master Bian’s self-defense weapon is actually a Level 9 weapon. I really envy him!”

“Even for weapons that are seemingly like decor, his weapon is Level 9. We really can’t compare with him at all!”

The rest of the crowd slightly lifted their chins and looked at Bian Yaoquan whose face was full of smiles. They were all envious of him.

Their backings might have been strong, but they were nowhere near this Young Master Bian.
