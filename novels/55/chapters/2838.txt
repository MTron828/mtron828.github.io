2839 2839, a fan that spanned billions of kilometers

Huge mountain peaks stood on both sides. Each mountain peak was at least a million kilometers tall.

Above the mountain peaks were densely packed trees.

In the center was a canyon and an entrance.

“After passing through this canyon that is more than a billion kilometers long, the inside should be the windless forest valley, the core of the entire windless forest.”

“It is said that the core of this windless forest is very dangerous. Even the god Emperor might die if he enters.”

!!

Wang Xian stood in front of the mountain peaks. He stared into the valley as he muttered.

Boom! Boom! Boom

Suddenly, at the entrance in front of him, law tornadoes gathered instantly. They emitted whistling sounds as they spun towards the interior of the canyon.

The terrifying might caused Wang Xian’s pupils to constrict slightly. His face was filled with astonishment.

This terrifying tornado could threaten the celestial emperor.

He stood quietly at the entrance of the canyon. The entire canyon passage was irregular and chaotic. From time to time, terrifying tornadoes, hurricanes, typhoons…

There were also wind spears and wind blades shuttling back and forth from time to time.

“Looks like I have to force my way in!”

Wang Xian frowned slightly. He unfurled his incipient saint wings and flew straight into the valley.

With his divine emperor level strength and the incipient saint wings, he only needed ten seconds to traverse the entire valley.

Buzz

Wang Xian’s speed was very fast. He was fully focused on sensing his surroundings.

Perhaps he was lucky and flew forward easily.

“I’m about to reach the entrance of the Windless Forest Valley!”

Wang Xian was delighted. At the same time, the incipient holy wings behind him trembled as a strong feeling came from above.

The holy feather was inside!

Buzz

“Everything is going smoothly!”

After passing through the valley successfully, a smile appeared on Wang Xian’s face as he looked at the location in front of him.

There were still many trees in the valley, but the trees here were bigger, taller, and had more luxuriant foliage.

Wang Xian took a glance and saw more than ten wind jades.

The wind jades were the size of a human head, and they contained terrifying energy.

At the entrance, the wind jades that Wang Xian obtained were comparable to a level 9 immortal king treasure.

The wind jades here were all at least at the peak of the immortal king level.

Furthermore, he saw a wind jade that was in the form of a bird. The bird had two wings that were the size of an ordinary fan.

At a glance, it looked like a holy object.

Wang Xian squinted his eyes slightly. There was a glow in his eyes.

However, he did not move. The Dragon Eyes of the five elements of yin and yang were still observing his surroundings.

The wings of the prieless holy wings on his back were trembling slightly.

“I’ve found it!”

At this moment, Wang Xian locked onto a tree tens of millions of kilometers in front of him.

This tree was slightly different from the surrounding trees. Its leaves were the same as ordinary leaves.

However, the leaves of this tree were in the form of feathers.

At the root of the tree, there was a feather and a green feather.

This feather was a little illusory and did not seem to be real. However, Wang Xian could sense a strong attraction from it.

This made his eyes burn with passion.

“I’ve found it. But why is there only one feather? Is there only one feather, or is there only one feather here?” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Wang Xian was puzzled. He scanned his surroundings and flew forward.

“I’ll put away these wind jades first. With the level of these trees, I shouldn’t be able to hurt myself.”

Wang Xian mumbled. His body moved and came in front of a wind jade. He stretched out his arm and grabbed it immediately.

Buzz

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

The moment he plucked it, countless leaves covered Wang Xian.

Dragon scales appeared on Wang Xian’s surface and easily blocked the attack of the leaves.

He stopped after a round of attacks.

Wang Xian was delighted.

“This is the rhythm of making a fortune!”

His eyes lit up. The value of the wind jade in his hand was comparable to a treasure at the peak of the Immortal King Realm.

The resources exchanged for this piece of wind jade could increase the number of peak-stage immortal king level experts in the Dragon Palace.

However, he wasn’t prepared to sell it. Instead, he wanted the immortal slaying gourd to absorb it.

His body moved and arrived in front of the second piece of Wind Jade. Just like before, Wang Xian kept it in his bag.

Next, he kept the pieces of wind jade one by one.

“This is the last piece of wind jade in this area. However, the attack of this tree should be able to threaten me.”

Wang Xian looked at the bird-shaped Feng Yu and showed a hint of hesitation on his face.

He flew over. Dragon scales covered his entire body as the five elements revolved around him. Waves of earthy yellow energy covered his body.

PA

Wang Xian extended his hand and held the bird-shaped Feng Yu in his hand.

Crash

In the next moment, countless leaves covered Wang Xian in an instant.

It wasn’t that he didn’t want to dodge, but the attacks from the leaves didn’t give him any time to dodge.

The speed of the wind was the fastest among the nine attributes.

“Bang! Bang! Bang!”

The continuous sounds of collisions rang out. Wang Xian’s body kept retreating backward.

“PFFT!”

A mouthful of fresh blood was spat out from his mouth. The dragon scales on Wang Xian’s body disintegrated bit by bit as fresh blood gushed out.

His expression changed drastically as he tried to prevent himself from crashing into other trees.

“PFFT!”

After a round of attacks, he spat out another mouthful of fresh blood. An extremely grave expression appeared on his face.

He had to endure such a powerful attack just to obtain this wind jade. If he were to obtain the Holy Feather, wouldn’t his attack be even more terrifying.

“This is also because of the incipient holy wings. After not touching the trees, the trees would only carry out one round of attacks. If it were anyone else, even a divine emperor would die here when facing the dense trees around.”

As Wang Xian spoke, his expression kept changing. His gaze landed on the Holy Feather.

“Release the strongest defense and withstand the attack. I shouldn’t die. However, I will be severely injured. I’ll give it my all!”

A determined look appeared in Wang Xian’s eyes.

After obtaining the Holy Feather, his strength might be able to increase tremendously.

After the injuries on his body recovered, Wang Xian approached the tree carefully.

If it were anyone else, they would not be able to avoid the lack of wind while walking and flying here. Once the wind was generated, they would be subjected to a terrifying attack.

Coming to the position of the Holy Feather, Wang Xian sized up the feather and slowly extended his arm.

His arm turned into a small dragon claw.

Crack

When Wang Xian grabbed the holy feather, he immediately grabbed it in his hand.

“Crash!”

At this moment, waves of surging energy surged from Wang Xian’s body to protect his body.

However, his expression changed the next moment.

This time, it wasn’t the leaves that were attacking him. Instead, it was the branches. The branches gathered together like a large banana fan. They carried a terrifying wind attribute law power as they attacked Wang Xian.

Bang

Crack Crack Crack

A terrifying attack landed on Wang Xian’s body. The strong wind force caused his body to fly backward.
