“Huh?”

Xiao Yu and the others rode their horses and flew toward them with a curious look on their faces.

“They are from the West!”

Looking at the color of their faces, Guan Shuqing immediately said.

However, they didn’t pay attention to her. They flew slowly while admiring the scenery around them.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

At this moment, the Pegasus flew toward the sky above them.

“Yu Yu!”

“Ao ao ao!”

Suddenly, the terrified cries of horses could be heard.

“F * ck, what’s Going On!”

“What’s Going On!”

“Bang! Ah! What’s Going On!”

The screams of horses and the gasps of the crowd could be heard. The entire scene was extremely chaotic. Over five hundred people were able to stabilize the Pegasus.

The Pegasus roared in fear and agitation. Their bodies could not help but retreat backwards.

“Hehe!”

Xiao Yu and the rest could not help but laugh when they saw the scene of the Pegasus falling from a thousand meters in the sky.

Earlier on, this group of people wanted to fly to the top of their heads on their Pegasus. However, when the Pegasus approached them, they felt a power that made their hearts palpitate.

Animals had a very strong bloodline suppression, especially when the other party was stronger than them.

Wang Xian, Xiao Yu, and the rest had already reached the first transformation of the Divine Dragon Transformation, not to mention Wang Xian. Xiao Yu and the rest also possessed the bloodline of the Divine Dragon.

This group of Pegasus didn’t dare to ride on top of their heads.

Their instinctive fear made them stop in fear.

“What’s going on?”

At this moment, the sound of two horses’hooves stepping on the air was heard. A cold voice was heard.

Two horses slowly flew over. These two horses were extremely tall. There was a horn in the middle of their heads. They looked like divine beasts.

A man and a woman sat on the horses. The man had long golden hair and was extremely handsome. The woman also had long golden hair. She had a proud expression on her face.

“Divine son, we don’t know either. When the Pegasus flew here just now, they suddenly stopped in fear!”

A girl rubbed the spot where her forehead touched and spoke to the young man and woman.

The young man swept his gaze across the Pegasus and looked ahead slowly.

When he saw that Wang Xian and the rest had left, his face was expressionless. “Everyone in front, did you just leave after making fun of the people from the Roman celestial domain?”

“Huh?”

When Wang Xian and the rest heard the voice from behind, they turned their heads around with a smile.

“We didn’t make a move!”

Xiao Yu spread out her hands with a smile on her face.

“You guys are the only ones here. If you guys didn’t make a move, could it be that there are others?”

The young man looked at them with an expressionless face.

“According to the 15th rule of the Roman celestial realm, anyone who offends the Oracle Corps will have their arm chopped off!”

The golden-haired goddess raised her head slightly and announced the sentence.

Their words caused Wang Xian and the rest to frown slightly.

“The people from the celestial domain have always been arrogant!”

Xiao Yu snorted coldly. She obviously knew something about the celestial domain.

“You don’t know which Immortal sect we are from?”

Guan Shuqing looked at them curiously.

“Xuanyuan? Yuwen or Beast Immortal Sect?”

“Even if it’s these three sects, you have to pay a little price for what you did just now!”

The young divine son said proudly.

“Hehe, how interesting. Little Xian, no one knows you now!”

Guan Shuqing and the others felt very interesting when they heard the young divine son’s words.

It had only been more than a year, yet there were people who did not know the Dragon King.

However, it made sense when they thought about it. This year was the year of the Earth’s great change. There were many prodigies, and at most, an immortal would appear every week. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

The Dragon Palace had not appeared for more than a year. Furthermore, the other party was from the west, so he did not know Wang Xian at all.

Now, the world did not recognize him!

“What price did you pay?”

Wang Xian asked in amusement.

“Looks like you guys are not from the three great immortal sects of China. Then, each of you shall have one arm!”

The Blonde Goddess landed on her Pegasus and looked down at the judge.

As she spoke, she moved her arm and a sharp gemstone sword appeared in her hand. She said indifferently, “Do you want to do it, or do you want me to do it?”

“I’ll do it!”

At this moment, a golden swordfish behind Wang Xian said coldly.

The moment he finished speaking, he started to move.

A radius of four to five kilometers was filled with beams of golden light. These beams of golden light seemed to cut through the entire space.

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian took a glance indifferently and continued flying forward.

Xiao Yu, Guan Shuqing, and the rest looked at him mockingly.

“The people of the divine realm call themselves gods in the west and are worshipped by others. However, when they come to the east, they have to keep a low profile!”

Xiao Yu said with slight disdain.

“Ah! My Arm!”

At this moment, a terrified scream came from behind.

“No, no, my arm!”

All of their faces were filled with shock. They stared in disbelief at their right arm.

Over five hundred people had their right arms chopped off.

“How is this possible... this...”

However, the two divine sons and goddesses seated on the two enormous Pegasus had cold sweat on their foreheads, and their eyes were filled with terror.

Their right arms were also completely empty.

In an instant, an instant attack.

“A god, or at least a god, he actually dares to directly attack us!”

The two sealed the wounds on their arms, gritting their teeth as they spoke in terror.

They hadn’t expected that their opponent would actually be an immortal god, and a God who was even stronger than them.

If they had known, they wouldn’t have spoken out about the trial, and they wouldn’t have been so arrogant.

However, the other party actually dared to directly cut off one of their arms without any mercy. This made their faces incomparably gloomy.

“Damn it, damn it. He actually dared to directly cut off all of our arms. I want my father to kill them, kill them!”

The young divine son roared in a sinister and low voice.

They were only divine sons who had just advanced to immortal God. Having their arms cut off, they needed a large number of medicinal pills to recover.

Besides them, there were also a group of experts from the Roman celestial domain who had their arms cut off. If all of them recovered, it would be a considerable amount of resources.

The western gods were basically the descendants of gods. In other words, it was very likely that their ancestors had gods, and their descendants would have a chance to become gods.

It was even more so now. Divine sons were the descendants of gods. They cultivated to become gods and did not inherit the divine throne.

The expression of the goddess beside him changed drastically. As the descendant of the god of beauty and love, she was very concerned about her image. Now, one of her arms had been chopped off.

In the grand scene that followed, wouldn’t it be embarrassing for her mother.

“Just you wait!”

The goddess gritted her teeth. Her expression was a little ferocious.

Wang Xian did not pay much attention to the small episode just now. At this moment, the so-called gods were just some people with strong cultivation.

On Earth, they were immortals and deities. On the supernatural continent, they were just frogs in a well!
