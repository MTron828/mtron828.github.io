Chapter 2894: 2,894 might of the Dragon Palace 1

“The dragon and Phoenix Divine Dynasty, which is in charge of the imperial star area, will take over the Heaven Magus region while the Dragon Palace will take over Mount Wu!”

“The founder of the Dragon and Phoenix Divine dynasty is the Dragon Empress of the Dragon Palace.”

“In seven days, the intelligence brain of the imperial star area will be connected to the communication network of the Heaven Magus region. At that time, the Heaven Magus region will be able to know what happened in the imperial star area and vice versa.”

“The ancient sorcerers and the other forces of the major religions have gone to the Wu mountain to pay their respects. Currently, the Wu Mountain is sparsely populated, and the Empress of the Dragon and Phoenix God dynasty has announced that talented people can settle in the Wu Mountain!”

“According to the Dragon Palace’s experts, the evil flow sect has committed all sorts of crimes in the Heaven Magus region. Now, the Empress of the Dragon and Phoenix God dynasty has given the order to destroy them. The nine divine dragons and the Heaven Array have a total of twelve divine emperors, and none of the members of the evil flow sect will be spared!”

“Order is about to be established in the Heaven Magus region, and a peaceful world is about to be established!”

In the next few days, many major events happened on the Heaven Magus region’s communication network.

Every single event was on the level of an earthquake to the entire Heaven Magus region.

With the establishment of the Dragon and Phoenix Divine Dynasty, the communication network, and the communication of the teleportation arrays, the Wu mountain accepted talented people.

There was also one point that caused the Heaven Magus region to boil with excitement. The Dragon Palace and the Dragon and Phoenix Divine Dynasty wanted to get rid of the evil people.

The evil flow sect was also a powerful force and had a prominent reputation in the Heaven Magus region.

They controlled dozens of planets and practiced slavery. They used hundreds of millions of people as cattle and horses, slaughtering them at will, refining wizard tools, and so on.

In the end, the Dragon Palace directly sent 12 God emperors to wipe them out.

These were 12 god Emperors!

The evil flow sect did not even have a god emperor. In the end, the Dragon Palace sent out 10 god Emperors.

Especially the nine divine dragons, which emitted a despairing might.

During those two days, the Divine Dragons roared, and all the disciples of the evil stream sect were killed. They suffered great pain and died.

In the entire evil stream, from the sect master patriarch to the servant disciples, not a single one survived.

Furthermore, the two divine emperors of the Dragon Palace tortured all the people of the evil stream sect for more than ten hours before killing them.

The entire Heaven Magus region was in an uproar, and most people were clapping and cheering.

Some people who cultivated evil witchcraft had pale faces. They either turned over a new leaf or fled the Heaven Magus region.

The Dragon Palace’s forceful attack also made everyone know that the rules of the Heaven Magus region had changed.

The huge reform had begun, and in less than a month, the Heaven Magus region had undergone a huge change.

“Is the news confirmed?”

At that moment, in the Sacred Tower of the sacred kingdom, the sacred master looked at Hong Fengyan and asked with a hint of shock in his eyes.

“It’s confirmed. The sacred master should have received the news from our Scouts of the Sacred Kingdom. There shouldn’t be any discrepancies!” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Hong Fengyan said with a faint smile.

“The Magi were killed. Not a single celestial thearch in the entire Heaven Magus region escaped. All the godly monarch experts were killed. Hiss, the strength of the Dragon Palace is too terrifying!”

“It’s not just terrifying. Many people in the Heaven Magus region can confirm that those nine creatures are real godly dragons. The Legendary Wind God dragon is an existence that stands at the pinnacle of the Universe!”

Beside them, the two holy region godly monarchs exclaimed in shock.

“The strength of the Witch Formation Association is much stronger than our holy region. According to what I know, the Dragon Palace broke through the Witch Formation Association’s defenses in less than two minutes. That Magus was instantly killed by the Dragon King. Only the monarch was prepared in advance and escaped.”

Hong Fengyan continued.

“With the Dragon King’s terrifying speed, he does have the ability to kill the Witch Formation Society’s Witch in an instant!”

“The Dragon Palace, the Dragon King, the Divine Dragon, and Xiao Yan, communicate with the Dragon King more in the future. With the Dragon Palace’s current strength, they are qualified to fight for the first place in the starry sky.”

The Holy Lord said with a twinkle in his eyes.

The Dragon Palace had destroyed two of the seven forces in the starry sky by itself. The Dragon Palace’s strength had far surpassed the holy region’s.

The saint realm might not even last a minute against the Dragon Palace.

“This matter might not have spread to other star fields yet. Why don’t we light a fire and let this matter spread faster?”

Hong Fengyan asked the Saint Lord with a smile.

“Hehe, no matter what, our relationship with the Dragon Palace is pretty good. Let’s congratulate it on our AI!”

The Saint Lord said with a smile.

He had seen the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace before. The Saint Realm and the Dragon Palace would become good friends because of their relationship.

This was enough for the Saint Realm.

“Boom!”

“Look at the information on the AI. We of the Saint Realm are congratulating the Dragon Palace for unifying the Heaven Shaman Realm and killing the enemy. What the hell does that mean?”

“The Dragon Palace destroyed the Witch Formation Association? Destroyed the imperial court?”

“How long has it been since the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace left our holy region? They actually destroyed the Witch Formation Society, destroyed the imperial court, and swept across a region!”

“The strength of the Dragon Palace is too terrifying. They are simply heaven-defying!”

Soon, after the Holy Region’s congratulatory statement was issued, the entire holy region was in an uproar.

This was truly sweeping across a region, truly destroying a powerful force.

Five years ago, the Rising Battle of the Dragon Palace had been fought within the imperial star area and hadn’t destroyed the imperial court, so it hadn’t caused much of a stir.

But now, it was a true sweep of a region, a cross-region battle. They had destroyed the other party and taken over a large region.

It was extremely terrifying!

This made everyone in the entire holy region suck in a deep breath.

“The success Wizard Association and the Imperial Court have been destroyed. I wonder how will bhang react?”

At this moment, some people thought of bhang.

Not long ago, bhang had joined forces with the imperial court’s Divine Emperor to head to their holy region and warned them not to interfere with their matters with the Dragon Palace.

In the end, the success Wizard Association and the Imperial Court’s two comrades had been destroyed by the Dragon Palace.

So, bhang had been killed?

If bhang knew about this news, he would probably pee in his pants!

Thinking of this, everyone in the holy region started to gloat.

Next, they would see how arrogant they were.

The announcement from the holy region caused the news of the Dragon Palace destroying the Witch Formation Association and the imperial court to spread even more widely.

Among the seven great regions, the news from the three great regions quickly spread to the surrounding star regions.

This was especially true for the eight desolation six directions. The eight desolation six directions was not a star region. It was a place where the experts from the various regions wanted to break through and search for treasures.

Therefore, the people from the eight desolation six directions came from the various star regions and received news from the various star regions in the most timely manner.

However, today, a piece of news caused the entire eight desolation six directions to fall silent.

“The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace led the Divine Dragon to conquer the Heaven Wizard region and destroyed the Cheng Wizard Association and the Imperial Court. The Celestial Emperor of the Cheng Wizard Association, including the Wizards, was killed and the monarch of the imperial court fled!”

When this news spread on the desolate six directions’communication network and was confirmed by a large number of people, the atmosphere in the entire desolate six directions became a little strange.

This was especially so for the disciples of the desolate eight directions.

Not long ago, the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace killed the eight desolate wind god-destroying emperor, and the eight desolate ordered the dragon palace to give an explanation or else they would pay a heavy price.

After the Dragon King of the back Dragon Palace left, he announced that the members of the Dragon Palace would come to the eight desolate six directions and kill them directly.

Moreover, they had joined forces with the imperial court of the Formation Wizard Association to prepare to destroy the Dragon Palace.

Now…
