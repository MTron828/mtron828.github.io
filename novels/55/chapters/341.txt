Chapter 342: Blood Sucking Toad

The sudden sound emanated from afar and surprised the crowd.

The rapid and coarse sound wasn’t that of a frog. Instead, the sound was low and deep.

The sound emanated from at least several thousand meters away.

“What’s making that sound?”

Everyone was taken aback as they looked towards the source.

This sound had made their hearts skipped a beat.

Several meters ahead of them was a branch of the Yellow River. For a sound to come from such a far place, the one making it would definitely be horrifying.

“Are there other mutated creatures?”

The expression on the middle-aged man in military uniform had stiffened with dismay. He looked ahead with his deep eyes before turning back and speaking to the crowd, “There might be unknown and powerful creatures ahead. Everyone, please be careful!”

The crowd kept their nonchalant attitude in check and started observing their surroundings attentively.

“Let’s go! Let’s quicken our pace!”

As the middle-aged man in military uniform finished his words, he dashed ahead at astonishing speed.

The crowd followed closely behind and headed towards the Yellow River.

Bam! Bam! Bam!

The crowd was really fast. The leeches and ants along the way were alarmed and attacked them directly.

However, the fighting capacity of the crowd was incredible. As they waved their weapons and shot out sword rays, these leeches and ants were split into halves.

“These mutated creatures are everywhere!” said Sun Lingxiu.

The crowd had encountered over fifty mutated animals while dashing for a thousand meters.

Hmm.

Wang Xian nodded his head and looked to the side.

There was a dilapidated village beside him with roughly over two hundred houses. At this moment, there were some dull red blood stains all around this small village.

There were no longer any humans within the village. What was left were corpses of some reared animals.

“We are approaching the Yellow River. Everyone, please be careful!” the middle-aged man in military uniform reminded the crowd.

The crowd slowed down and looked towards the Yellow River ahead of them.

Screech, screech, screech!

The crowd gathered at a dilapidated house with an area marked out for rearing pigs.

Suddenly, all of them picked up dense buzzing sounds. They were shocked and instantly looked to their side.

“Those are mutated mosquitoes. Be careful!” an Inborn expert turned over and shouted with a serious expression.

“F*ck! There are so many of them!”

Everyone was alarmed. Each mosquito was the size of a human’s palm. As they charged out of the house by the thousands, the razor sharp edge of their mouths had a strong scent of blood.

At least a thousand mutated mosquitoes were attacking them.

Wang Xian squinted his eyes and looked at the nest of mutated mosquitoes before him. They were known as Cadaveric Mosquitoes. Among them, there was a Level 10 existence.

On top of that, there were many Level 9 Cadaveric Mosquitoes.

“Be careful. Some of these mutated mosquitoes are as strong as an Inborn Realm expert!”

An Inborn expert shouted and reminded the crowd. He was shocked to hear a clang collision sound when he slashed his sharp sword at a Cadaveric Mosquito.

Rumble!

The group of Inborn experts immediately gave their all and did not hold back their strength.

“Aurora!”

“Blood Mist!”

Sun Lingxiu struck at the same time as Miracle Doctor Blood Man. Flashes of brilliance cut through the skies, illuminating the day even more brightly.

As for Miracle Doctor Blood Man, he shrouded over a hundred mutated mosquitoes with his Blood Mist.

Soon, these Cadaveric Mosquitoes fell to the ground like raindrops.

“So strong!”

When the surrounding crowd saw Sun Lingxiu and Miracle Doctor Blood Man’s attacks, their pupils constricted unconsciously.

The range of their attack had eliminated one-fifth of the total Cadaveric Mosquitoes.

The group of Miracle Doctors also looked at them in awe. As Miracle Doctors, their battle capacities were much weaker than ordinary Inborn experts.

However, the Holy Goddess and Miracle Doctor Blood Man were completely different from them. Their fighting capacities were off the charts!

The middle-aged man in military uniform also took a glance at Sun Lingxiu and Miracle Doctor Blood Man. After which, he shouted, “Go!”

The crowd was on high alert. Among the thousand mutated mosquitoes they had encountered previously, there was an Inborn level mosquito!

Logically, the center of the source of the virus might have even stronger animals.

It was especially so considering the sound they had heard previously that made their hearts skip a beat.

The crowd approached the Yellow River carefully. The water of the river was incomparably muddy. There was no way one could see the situation below the surface. On the surface, there were floating corpses of ducks and birds.

As this wasn’t the main channel of the Yellow River, the river water wasn’t flowing. Faint ripples were formed only when faint wind disturbed the calm surface.

The breadth of this segment of the Yellow River was over a thousand meters. It wasn’t particularly broad but wasn’t narrow either.

The crowd arrived at the edge and carefully observed their surroundings.

“It would seem that the sound from before should have originated from this vicinity,” an Inborn expert commented with a solemn expression.

“Let me take a look!” Poison Doc, Yan She, moved his arm and a green poisonous snake dived into the Yellow River.

He still had a black venomous snake with him. Clearly, he wasn’t willing to risk the black snake.

“Let me take a look at the river water!” An old man waved his hand and a ball of water flew towards him.

“The center of this part of the Yellow River can reach a depth of fifteen. It is relatively deep compared to other areas,” the middle-aged man in military uniform explained to the group. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Wang Xian squinted his eyes. A blue and red light flashed in his eyes.

In his view, the muddy water gradually turned transparent. The situation under the surface gradually appeared in his sight.

“There aren’t any fish at all! Not even one!”

Wang Xian was slightly surprised that there wasn’t even a living fish in the huge and broad Yellow River.

“That is a Cadaveric Leech!”

Wang Xian turned his head around and looked to his right. A palm-sized leech was resting at the bottom of the riverbed.

Suddenly, that Cadaveric Leech suddenly accelerated and attacked towards the direction of that green snake.

Sss sss!

The green snake was clearly not any ordinary snake. Sensing the Cadaveric Leech, it immediately lifted its head and stared coldly at it.

Swish!

The Cadaveric Leech charged furiously ahead but the green snake wasn’t flustered. It opened its mouth and revealed two huge fangs which it sank into the leech. After which, it swam rapidly towards shore.

Croak!

At this moment, a water bubble appeared before the snake. A huge and dreadful toad-like creature was swimming towards the green snake at an astonishing speed.

The toad-like creature extended its tongue. On its tongue, there were various suction cups that looked frightening.

The green snake didn’t even have the time to retaliate when it was wrapped by the tongue. After which, the dense suction cups instantly started wiggling.

At a pace visible to the human eye, the green snake was sucked dry. As for that Cadaveric Leech, it managed to survive and fled rapidly.

Huh?

The commotion within the water also attracted the attention of the crowd on shore as they looked on.

Splash!

At this instant, the toad-like creature appeared to have picked up the scent of the humans on shore and jumped out of the water directly.

Bam!

A one-meter huge horrifying mutated creature stared coldly at the crowd.

It had dense, bulging meat balls all around its body and was dull yellow in color. Subsequently, it opened its mouth and revealed its horrifying tongue, which it stuck out and pointed to the sky.
