2681 2681 was courting death

“Beast, die!”

“One person taking care of two should be enough!”

In the Abyss on the east side of the Demon Island, 50 to 60 people from the world margin sect stared at the abyss seed in front of them with burning eyes.

They charged straight into the Abyss Group and attacked the Undying Level 6 and 7 abyss seeds.

Rumble

The leader of the World Margin Sect Elder’s sky connecting ruler flew towards an undying level 8 abyss seed in front of him.

The powerful wind law energy instantly pierced through the body of the level 8 seed.

Weng

He waved his arm and took out the crystal, his lips curling up.

“Die Die Die Die!”

Behind him, the palm of the Tian Ya sect brought its claws and tore through space, swiftly killing an undying level 7 seed.

Every disciple of the Tian Ya sect attacked the weaker one.

“Dragon King!”

The sky array looked to the right and frowned slightly.

“Hehe!”

Wang Xian’s face turned cold when he saw them killing the abyssal seeds without any scruples.

“Ao Yao, send someone over and capture the elders and deacons. Don’t make them call for help. Kill the rest!”

He looked to the side and said with a murderous tone.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Ao Yao’s voice was heard. In the next moment, a few spots in the space of the dragon peak trembled. Immediately, a large number of strange demons followed behind Ao Yao and flew out.

Wang Xian looked over there with a cold look in his eyes.

If it was someone from the nine heavens sect, he might have hesitated a little. However, if it was Tian Ya, hehe!

Coincidentally, he also had some things to verify.

“Die!”

Within the Abyss, the Tian Ya great sect elder once again attacked, another undying level 8 seed died in his hands.

He waved his arm and took out the abyss crystal, his face full of smiles.

“HM? That Dragon Palace didn’t react at all?”

Holding the Abyss Crystal in his hand, the Tian Ya great sect elder’s body paused. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

According to his plan, killing two undying level 8 abyss seeds would be enough. Any more would offend the Dragon Palace, infuriating them.

But now, they had already started to kill the abyss seeds, yet the other Dragon Palace didn’t react at all.

This made his heart move!

Could he kill another one?

His heart moved, he gripped the sky connecting ruler in his hand and waved his arm, attacking the abyss seeds in front of him once again.

If the Dragon Palace scolded them, they could at most return the abyssal seed in their hands to them.

“The people of the Dragon Palace didn’t say anything. What are they doing?”

“They should be afraid of the strength of our world margin sect. Haha, the Elder has continued to hunt, so we should kill another one.”

“We came to the right place this time!”

At the back, the people of the world margin sect saw that the elder continued to hunt after killing two abyssal seeds. When they saw that the Dragon Palace didn’t have any reaction, they were delighted and whispered excitedly.

Without any hesitation, they continued to hunt down the abyssal seeds.

“Buzz, Buzz, Buzz!”

However, at this moment, black and white figures appeared behind them and to their left and right.

The black and white figures exuded a cold murderous aura.

The figures that suddenly appeared to their left and right caused them to be slightly stunned.

“This...”

The members of the world margin sect were slightly shocked and their pupils constricted.

“Insatiable greed, seeking death, unable to live.”

At this moment, they heard a voice coming from Dragon Peak. The faces of the fifty to sixty members of the world margin sect changed drastically and revealed shocked expressions.

“What is the Dragon Palace trying to do?”

“Are these the experts of the Dragon Palace?”

Their hearts sank, but they didn’t have time to react. Terrifying attacks came at them one after another.

“Not good!”

The expressions of the fifty or sixty experts of the world margin sect changed drastically.

“PFFT! PFFT! PFFT!”

...

However, at this moment, the extremely sharp claws had already entered their bodies.

“Dragon Palace, you...”

“PFFT!”

“Cough, cough, cough!”

At the front, the elder of the world margin sect instantly sensed the changes in the surroundings.

When he sensed that the dragon palace had directly sent people to kill them, his expression changed drastically and he let out a furious roar.

However, before he could make a sound, a sickle-like claw directly cut his throat, making him unable to make a sound.

“PFFT!”

His face turned pale, and his body trembled. However, before he could react, another sharp claw directly pierced through his body.

Moreover, he sensed with extreme fear that he had been suddenly appeared behind him and flew toward the Dragon Peak.

“What are the Dragon Palace trying to do? How dare they?”

...

“Are they trying to make an enemy out of the world margin sect?”

“Also, what kind of terrifying existence is this that can subdue me in an instant?”

Many thoughts appeared in his mind, causing his face to turn extremely pale.

“Cough, cough, cough!”

At this moment, he saw that the deacon from the world margin sect had been caught and was spitting out blood.

“Dragon King!”

Ao Yao and the rest brought the two of them to the command platform and shouted at Wang Xian.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

Heaven array swept his gaze across the two of them. With a wave of his arm, two thorns extended out from the dragon peak and wrapped around them.

Ao Yao and the rest immediately released their grip.

“Gulp!”

“Dragon King, what are you trying to do? Let me tell you, I am an elder of the world margin sect. If you dare to kill me, the World Margin Sect Will Destroy Your Dragon Palace.”

Ao Yao had just released the elder of the world margin sect when he shouted with a drastic change in expression.

“Bang!”

Wang Xian stepped lightly on his head and stared at him coldly.

“Who gave you the courage to come to our Dragon Palace’s territory to hunt for Abyss Seeds?”

He stared at the elder of the world margin sect and said with some disdain.

“I... If you don’t want us to hunt, you can tell us. You actually dare to seriously injure me now. Dragon King, do you know that you are courting death?”

The elder of the Horizon sect shouted sternly.

“Let us go, let us go. If you dare to kill us, we, the horizon sect, will not let you go. Let us go now.”

At the side, the Deacon of the Horizon sect clenched his fist and shouted sternly.

“You who are about to die, don’t be so arrogant!”

Wang Xian looked at the deacon with indifference in his eyes.

“Don’t you dare, Dragon King. If you dare to kill us...”

Buzz

“Ah!”

When the elder of the world margin sect heard Wang Xian’s words, he immediately roared angrily. However, before he could finish his sentence, he heard the screams of the deacon beside him.

He immediately turned around and looked over. He saw the deacon lying on the ground with a lifeless look in his eyes. His body trembled.

“You... What did you do to him? What did you do to him?”

At this moment, the elder of the world margin sect shouted in horror.

“Phew!”

Wang Xian closed his eyes slightly and absorbed the memories obtained from the Soul Catcher.
