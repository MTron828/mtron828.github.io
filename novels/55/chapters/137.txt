Chapter 138: Descent of the King (3)

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

“Die!”

Twisting his body, Yan Zhongyuan lifted a sword and slashed towards Mo Shisan rapidly.

“How dare you send a Level 8 Martial Artist expert to battle a Level 7 Martial Artist expert from the Yan Family! That’s despicable!”

“Tsk. Just a brat courting death. This time, the Yan Family will definitely not let them off!”

The crowd looked on coldly as Yan Zhongyuan launched his attacks.

Although it was shocking that Mo Shisan had defeated the middle-aged man from the Yan Family in an instant, the crowd saw Wang Xian’s action of hiding Mo Shisan’s true strength as the reason for his imminent downfall.

Despite seeing Yan Zhongyuan making his moves, Wang Xian did not say a word. Instead, he simply smiled and looked on.

“Those who dare to offend our King shall all die today!”

Mo Shisan looked at Yan Zhongyuan. Around him, devilish flames were rising. His fingers turned into a claw as he swung his arm.

One could vaguely see faint scales on the hands of Mo Shisan.

Dragon scales!

“Courting death!”

Yan Zhongyuan manipulated the long sword in his hand. To his astonishment, he saw Mo Shisan intending to take the attack directly with his bare hand. Murderous intent filled his face as he slashed down ruthlessly.

Bam!

However, what happened sent chills down Yan Zhongyuan’s spine. Mo Shisan had grabbed onto the long sword directly with his hand. Moreover, cracks were starting to appear on his long sword.

Rawrrr!

Mo Shisan let out a low growl as he attacked heavily with his right hand.

Yan Zhongyuan was shocked by the development and immediately raised his arm to defend against the attack!

Crack crack!

To his astonishment, he heard the bones of his arms cracking.

Bam bam bam!

Mo Shisan clenched his claws and dealt 5 consecutive punches to Yan Zhongyuan’s four limbs and Elixir Field.

In less than 10 moves, Yan Zhongyuan was down on the ground.

“Martial Artist Level 9!” the crowd exclaimed, looking on in disbelief.

He is definitely a Martial Artist Level 9 expert. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have defeated Yan Zhongyuan so easily!

Yan Zhongyuan could be considered as very strong even among Martial Artist Level 8 experts.

Bam!

“Great! How dare you make a fool of the Yan Family! You have completely angered me!”

When Yan Gukong saw Yan Zhongyuan crippled by Mo Shisan, the dragon-head walking stick in his hand smashed heavily on the floor. At the same time, a strong and dense aura started emitting from his body.

He stared at Wang Xian with murderous intent.

“I have made my decision. You won’t be stepping out of the Yan Family’s gate tonight!”

Yan Feng lifted his belt sword and pointed at Wang Xian. His belt sword was like an agile snake and had a dazzling glow.

“Let me destroy him!”

Yan Gulie, who was beside Yan Gukong, walked over slowly with a heavy look. His eyes were fixed on Mo Shisan!

“I’m really just a Level 7 Martial Artist!”

Mo Shisan pouted and looked at him with murderous intent.

“Mo Yuan, Martial Artist Level 9!”

At this moment, Mo Qinglong’s disciple, Mo Yuan, walked forward and passed Wang Xian. He maintained a cold smile while observing his surroundings.

Mo Shisan bowed to Mo Yuan before leaving.

Mo Yuan nodded in response before looking to Yan Gulie.

Yan Gulie’s expression changed and the crowd was stunned.

Everyone’s attention was on Mo Yuan.

“It... It can’t be. Mo Yuan looks so much stronger than Mo Shisan! Mo Shisan claimed to be Martial Artist Level 7 but was able to easily crush Martial Artist Level 8. Now we have Mo Yuan, who looks much stronger and is claiming to be Martial Artist Level 9!”

“How strong is this group of people?”

The Martial Artists around looked at Mo Yuan in disbelief. At this moment, they had put away their disdain and chose to take this group of people more seriously.

Yan Gukong from the Yan Family also squinted his eyes. His palm wrapped around the dragon-head walking stick tightly and he suddenly had a bad premonition.

Yan Feng’s expression had also turned heavy. He looked at Mo Yuan before looking across at the group of people behind Wang Xian.

“Playing tricks!”

Yan Gulie’s expression changed dramatically. He gritted his teeth and jumped towards Mo Yuan.

“You? Not good enough!”

Mo Yuan looked nonchalantly at Yan Gulie and his face was filled with contempt.

“Die!”

Yan Gulie’s palm turned red, emitting dazzling and scorching light as he struck towards Mo Yuan’s head.

“Dragon Claw!”

Mo Yuan was unmoved. Just as Yan Gulie’s attack was about to hit him, he swung his five fingers like a claw towards Yan Gulie.

Argh!

Horror and shrieks sounded. Mo Yuan grabbed onto Yan Gulie’s arm easily. His eyes were filled with contempt as he said, “You are too weak. Next!”

Bam!

Yan Gulie was sent flying back and landed heavily in front of Yan Gukong. He was throwing out blood violently.

“Instant kill! How can this be possible...”

“He can’t be a Level 9 Martial Artist. Definitely not! He is at least a half-step to Inborn realm expert!”

“Half-step to Inborn! Could it be that he is really at the half-step to Inborn realm?”

“Who is that juvenile? How is he... Able to bring along such powerful people!”

Shock! Everyone was stunned.

No one had expected that juvenile to bring along such horrifying people.

What would the Yan Family do now?

At this moment, the people in the crowd who had chided them to get on the good books of the Yan Family previously were turning pale.

They would have never expected this group of people to be so powerful.

The members of the Yan Family turned solemn. Even the arrogant looks on Yan Gukong were gone. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Yan Feng had also put aside his arrogance and looked at Wang Xian in disbelief.

“Hehe. Let’s continue!” Wang Xian said as he looked across the crowd at Mo Yuan.

“Yes!”

Mo Yuan nodded his head and turned his attention to Yan Gukong in the middle. “Only you are qualified to be my opponent!”

Yan Gukong’s expression turned ghastly and his hand that was holding onto the walking stick started shivering.

“This is unexpected. Really unexpected. May I ask...where are you guys from?”

“Dragon Sect!” Mo Yuan said plainly.

“Dragon Sect? I don’t think we have any deep grudges between us. If we continue with this fight, you wouldn’t come out unscathed.” Yan Gukong stared at Mo Yuan as he spoke.

“Since you have offended our Dragon King, it’s only natural to annihilate you!”

Mo Yuan pouted. “As to whether we would come out unscathed, your Yan Family isn’t qualified to say that. You are really full of nonsense!”

Mo Yuan spoke, and as he finished his words, the devilish aura around him raged fiercely as he attacked Yan Gukong.

“Fight!”

Yan Gukong was shocked. The opponent was too overbearing.

“Get back! Get back! Battles between half-step to Inborn experts could implicate a large area!”

Seeing the fight, the leader of the Ren Family quickly retreated.

All the Ancient Martial Arts Families also retreated in a hurry as they looked to the fight in horror.

They had initially thought that the Yan Family would announce the return of the King and dominate over all others. To their surprise, a juvenile brought a group of horrifying experts over that could even match Yan Family’s half-step to Inborn realm expert.

“Father. That... That old man is likely to be even stronger than Mo Yuan!”

Ren Zhian and the Ren Family were dumbfounded by the fight. When Ren Zhian saw the old man behind Wang Xian, he subconsciously recalled the events of that fateful night. He couldn’t hold back his thoughts as he spoke to his father.

The leader of the Ren Family was slightly shocked as he turned his gaze towards the old man in front of the group of 50 people.

The old man maintained a faint smile throughout and didn’t seem to be concerned about the current battle.

“Zhian, are you sure?” The leader of the Ren Family was shaking slightly.

“I’m sure!” Ren Zhian nodded his head heavily.

Inborn Expert! Horror crept into the leader of the Ren Family.
