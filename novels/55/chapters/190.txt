“I’m sorry that I’m late!”

A nonchalant voice sounded in the ears of everyone.

Everyone was stunned as they turned their attention to the entrance at the side.

It was a middle-aged man with hair that spread around his shoulders. He had a saber at his back. His fringe was concealing his eyes, but even so, a bright and fearsome radiance could be vaguely seen from his eyes.

Behind that middle-aged man, dozens of followers were trailing behind him. They had the same weapons in their hands. All of them shared an extraordinary vibe that came from someone who held high positions for a long time.

“Who is he?” A middle-aged man observed the horde of people with surprise as he displayed a puzzled look.

But everyone had the same sentiment when the horde of people emerged. All of them were staring at the long-haired middle-aged man who was leading at the front.

“We’ve got more than enough people to challenge you guys.” The man was obviously Maniac Ji. Following behind him were all formidable people from the Ancient Martial Artist Families and sects in Flow City.

Maniac Ji might not have established any forces of his own, but he was born and lived in Flow City. He truly deserved to be the King of Flow City.

Even if he did not claim to be the King, all the families and sects in Flow City recognized him as one.

Maniac Ji’s identity was similar to Wang Xian’s in Rivertown.

They were Kings without having to proclaim themselves as such.

None of the people in Flow City dared to defy his orders.

Maniac Ji slowly lifted his chin and stared at the middle-aged man who remarked, “A small Rivertown which doesn’t even have a Second-class Force and the Southern Province which doesn’t even have a First-class Force were thinking of challenging them and the Liu Family. They must be really eager to seek their own death!”

“Maniac Ji!” That middle-aged man filled his eyes with fear as he swallowed his saliva with a trembling body when he saw Maniac Ji staring at him nonchalantly. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Maniac Ji, he’s Maniac Ji...” All the guests from Liu Family went pale in panic.

Reputation was all a person needed. Be mad, be a maniac. Do whatever it takes, Maniac Ji.

Back then, Maniac Ji stooped to any means just to annihilate the entire first-class force, and this created a stir in the Ancient Martial Arts World.

Anyone who encountered this maniac would be petrified.

Maniac Ji swept his impassive glance across those guests from Liu Family as he paced his way to Wang Xian.

With a bow, he shouted respectfully, “Miracle Doctor Wang!”

“You’re not late!” Wang Xian had not informed Maniac Ji, but he was pleased to see Maniac Ji here.

Ji Yuankun might be known as Maniac Ji, but he had a strong sense of comradeship, and he was someone who kept his words.

“Glad to hear that!” Maniac Ji revealed a smile. After his son recovered, he finally found his long-lost smile. “Miracle Doctor Wang, should I annihilate Liu Family?”

Maniac Ji’s voice was heard once again.

When the guests from Liu Family saw the chilly smile Maniac Ji was wearing, their foreheads broke into a cold sweat.

No doubt it was Maniac Ji. The first thing he said was to annihilate Tyrannical Sword of Liu Family.

“Maniac Ji, do you want to set yourself against us?”

At this time, the white-bearded old man who was sitting at the front could not take it lying down. He stood up immediately with frosty radiance flickering in his eyes.

Maniac Ji ignored the white-bearded old man as he continued to look at Wang Xian, waiting for his reply.

“Do it!” Wang Xian spat out the words coldly.

“Hahaha, hahaha.” Just then, the white-bearded old man laughed wildly. He stared at Wang Xian with a malevolent expression. “Brat, you are thinking of annihilating Liu Family? What an arrogant tone. Do you think Maniac Ji himself could do that by himself?”

The white-bearded old man continued as he glared ferociously at Maniac Ji. “Others may be afraid of you. But I, Liu Jingshan, am not. Do you think you can be my match?” The white-bearded old man exhibited immense confidence on his face as he spoke.

Twenty years ago, he had made a breakthrough and attained Inborn Realm while Maniac Ji had accomplished that only five years ago. Hence, Liu Jingshan was dauntless.

“Wang Xian, damn you. Today, I’ll kill you with my own hands!” Liu Fei Yun felt embarrassed when he saw a horde of Ancient Martial Artist Families and Maniac Ji led by Wang Xian.

He slowly drew the sharp-edged sword with a pair of murderous eyes as he glared at Wang Xian.

Today, Liu Family had nothing to fear if a fight broke out. His grandfather could hold Maniac Ji while the rest of the guests from Liu Family could cripple Wang Xian’s men.

“Kill me with your own hands?” Wang Xian stared at Liu Fei Yun coldly as he filled his eyes with an immense amount of killing intent. He swung his arm.

Whoosh!

At this time, four figures were thrown over to the side.

Everyone was appalled as they quickly turned to check on the black figures.

Bam!

Four black figures were thrown to the stage, making four thumping sounds.

“Four bodies!” All of them were aghast as they stared at the four bodies on the stage.

Liu Fei Yun fixed his eyes on the four bodies with an awful look on his face. He could even recognize them at one glance, as they were the ones who he had sent to assassinate Wang Xian last night.

“How dare you send someone to kill my family and me. Heh!”

“I must destroy Liu Family!” As soon as Wang Xian finished his words, a group of people, in black attire with a golden Divine Dragon embroidered on their chest, marched slowly towards them.

There were 52 in total including an old man and a middle-aged man at the entrance. The remaining ones were young men.

As they marched over, they exuded an intense killing vibe.

All of the people from Liu Family varied their expressions. Every one of them stared at those black-attired people as they surrounded them.

Liu Jingshan narrowed his eyes as he sensed danger brewing. He stretched out his arm and drew a honed sword as he stared at Wang Xian coldly.

With a stern look, the guests from Liu Family fixed their eyes on the fifty people who emerged out of nowhere. A small amount of cold sweat broke out from their faces.

They were already aghast that Miracle Doctor Wang could gather all the people from Rivertown.

They did not expect he could gather Maniac Ji, let alone a group of more than fifty black-attired men who surrounded the area.

They might not be aware of their strength, but they could tell that this bunch of people were not ordinary given the killing and imposing vibe they exuded.

Besides, the brave act of besieging the Liu Family already proved their strength.

On the other hand, people from Lan Family were dumbfounded and appalled as they watched the event unfold.

They did not expect that the political marriage of Lan and Liu Family would have such developments.

Dazedly, they fixed their eyes upon that young man who had apparently engaged in some entanglement with Qingyue.

Initially, they thought this young man would be easily killed by Liu Family.

Never did they expect things would turn out this way.

Experts emerged and eventually besieged them all!

They were dazzled as that young man seemed like he wanted to annihilate Liu Family!

“These must be the forces behind him. It’s much more formidable than I thought!” Sect Leader Tan was stunned as he looked at Maniac Ji and the group of black-attired men around him.

But he was glad that he had made this choice.
