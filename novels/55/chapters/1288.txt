Chapter 1289: 1290

“Haha, that Young Man is obviously no match for young master he!”

“Of course, not to mention the powerful fierce beasts under young master he, even his own strength is definitely not something that young man can compare to!”

“Young master he, teach that Guy a lesson and let him know how powerful you are!”

Seeing the weapon in he Yuan’s hand, the young men of the Yan clan had a burning look in their eyes as they flattered him from behind.

“Unless that youth is at the second level of the profound void tier, he is absolutely not a match for Little Yuan!”

“That’s right, be careful later, don’t injure your life!”

The two middle-aged men looked at this scene with smiles on their faces as they stood at the side, ready to attack at any time.

“Roar Roar!”

The roars of fierce beasts rang out, and the group of fierce beasts had already engaged in a fierce battle.

“Young master Wang!”

Around them, Long Xiaotian’s subordinates were also shouting with worried faces. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Haha, don’t worry. No matter what, he is my follower today. I will not let him get hurt too badly!”

When he yuan heard the voices of Long Xiaotian and the rest, he laughed heartily in his heart.

Wang Xian looked at the somewhat smug he yuan and revealed a smile on his face.

He waved the lightning strike wood in his hand and numerous thorns attacked he yuan.

“Eh? Brother Wang Xian, aren’t you of the metal and water attributes? Why Is it wood and water?”

Long Xiaotian, who was standing at the side, was surprised when he saw Wang Xian’s attack.

Could it be that he had obtained a special heaven and earth water attribute?

“Wood attribute. Haha, you still dare to use the wood attribute in front of me!”

He Yuan showed a hint of disdain in his eyes. He waved the staff in his hand and the trees within a radius of a thousand meters in front of him attacked Wang Xian directly.

“Hehe!”

Wang Xian smiled faintly.

Water Tomb!

Earth burial entanglement!

Wang Xian waved the lightning strike wood in his hand again.

There was already half a meter deep sea water below them. After Wang Xian used it, it was completely silent.

With his current strength, even if he yuan was equipped with powerful equipment, he could still defeat him easily.

He Yuan was slightly stunned by the unexpected restraint. Following that, he felt a strong entangling force coming from the water.

“What?”

He Yuan’s expression changed drastically.

“Thousand Thorn Slash!”

He swung the staff in his hand down heavily.

However, what shocked him was that his attack did not break the thorns that were wrapped around his legs.

The strong tearing force was still transmitted.

“Oh no, Myriad Wood Protection!”

He shouted loudly immediately. His entire body emitted a bright green glow.

Numerous thorns were surrounding him.

“Explode, water danger explosion!”

Wang Xian shook his arm and unleashed his water attribute divine ability.

Boom! Boom! Boom

The powerful attack force caused the defense that he had yet to form to explode.

“What? Dual attributes!”

“Dual attributes!”

The two middle-aged men who were watching by the side had a drastic change in expression. They cried out involuntarily.

“What, this...”

Even he Yuan’s expression changed drastically. As he felt the powerful tearing force coming from beneath him and the terrifying water attribute divine ability in the surroundings, a hint of fear appeared in his eyes.

“Little Yuan is no match for him!”

“Dual attributes. He can almost fight across levels!”

The two middle-aged men looked at each other. Without any hesitation, they flew straight towards the battlefield.

“Alright, Little Brother, let’s call it a day!”

A middle-aged man roared in a deep voice as he looked at Wang Xian in shock.

Dual attributes. A powerful Beast Tamer. No one knew what kind of bloodline he had.

However, they could guess that this young man’s bloodline was definitely extraordinary.

“I really didn’t expect that there would be such a powerful heaven’s favorite in such a small domain like the flowing sea region. Coupled with the nameless sword demon, could it be that there will be a top-notch expert rising up in the Flowing Sea Region?”

The two of them thought to themselves in surprise. They came to He Yuan’s side and waved their arms to help him cut off the thorns that were entangling him.

When Wang Xian saw them making their move, a smile appeared on his face. He looked at he yuan and shouted mockingly, “How is it, little brother? Are you convinced?”

At this moment, he yuan was still in a state of shock. When he saw Wang Xian’s mocking expression, his expression kept changing.

However, he had to admit that he had lost. Moreover, he had lost completely.

“Dual attributes. You actually have dual attributes. What kind of bloodline do you have?”

To become a Beast Tamer, one had to have a bloodline.

He Yuan was a little surprised as to what kind of bloodline Wang Xian had. In the supernatural continent, dual-attribute demonic beasts existed.

However, due to the preciousness of this bloodline, it had not appeared for thousands of years.

“Haha, I’m Stronger Than You Anyway!”

Wang Xian laughed out loud. “I’m just asking if you admit defeat, Pretty Boy!”

“You, you... you...”

He Yuan’s expression kept changing. He had lost in the Beast Taming competition, and he had also lost in the Battle of strength.

Wasn’t he one of the top heaven’s favorites in the vast region?

Was this the central region of the transcendence continent?

“I admit defeat. You Won’t go back on your word, right?”

Wang Xian looked at him and asked with a smile.

“I, he yuan, am a man of my word. HMPH, here you are. This is 100,000 spirit liquid!”

He Yuan handed a few porcelain bottles to Wang Xian with an embarrassed expression.

“Then, how about calling me big brother again? Haha!”

Wang Xian took the porcelain bottles and laughed loudly as he continued to speak.

“You... I... Big...”

He Yuan’s body was trembling slightly. It was difficult for him to call this fellow Big Brother.

“Big Brother!”

However, when he saw Wang Xian’s mocking expression, he gritted his teeth and shouted loudly.

The young men of the Yan clan were stunned when they heard Wang Xian call him Big Brother.

He was a top-notch Heaven’s favorite of the He clan, yet he was calling him big brother...

And this was the extremely arrogant young master he these few days?

Where did the pride that came from his soul go?

The two middle-aged men didn’t say anything when they saw this scene.

They had witnessed this matter from the beginning to the end. Naturally, they wouldn’t attack Wang Xian directly because of such a small matter.

Furthermore, they did not sense Wang Xian’s hostility.

“Alright, Little Brother, you’re a good boy now!”

Wang Xian smiled.

“One day, I will come for Revenge!”

He Yuan looked at Wang Xian’s smug look and swore through gritted teeth.

“Welcome, Welcome!”

Wang Xian smiled and kept the spiritual liquid.

100,000 spiritual liquid and 70,000,000 Dragon Crystals. Happy to have it!

“HMPH!”

He Yuan turned around with a face full of anger. He wanted to leave immediately.

“Wait!”

Looking at He Yuan’s figure, a smile flashed across Wang Xian’s eyes.

It was not easy to meet a rich person who could still see eye to eye with him. How could Wang Xian let him leave immediately.

Naturally, he had to get more spiritual liquid from him.

“Speak quickly if you have anything to say!”

He Yuan turned his head to look at Wang Xian with an embarrassed expression and roared in a deep voice.

“Do you want to buy the beast taming inheritance of the old man of Bai Xun?”

Wang Xian asked with a smile.

“Yes, yes!”

He Yuan’s heart skipped a beat. A hint of surprise flashed across his eyes as he hurriedly shouted.

For the first time, he felt that this fellow was not that annoying.

Although the beast taming skills of the old man of Bai Xun were not that important to him.

As a Beast Tamer, he naturally wanted to master more beast taming skills.

“200,000 spiritual liquid!”

Wang Xian said faintly.

He Yuan: ...
