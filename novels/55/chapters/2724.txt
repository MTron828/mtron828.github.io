Wang Xian chatted with imperial star lady bei Shuang and the rest for a while.

The two of them had been in the abyss for six days and had killed dozens of immortal king abyss seeds.

The strength of the team of Imperial Star Lady and the rest was relatively strong compared to the imperial court.

After all, only the elders of the imperial court had the strength of an immortal King Level 9. With their immortal King Level 8 combat strength, it would be pretty good if they were placed in the Abyss battlefield.

“We need to have a good sleep. It’s very harmful to stay alert in the Abyss.”

After Empress Star said that, she entered the room with bei Shuang and began to rest.

“Dragon King, the news of bei Shuang’s return has already reached the horizon sect.”

At this moment, Ba Qi, who was at the side, spoke to Wang Xian.

“Oh? That’s quite fast.”

Wang Xian smiled and sipped his tea.

“Hehe, Dragon King, one of the disciples who investigated the news is one of our own.”

Ba Qi, who was at the side, smiled.

When Wang Xian heard that, the corners of his mouth curled up slightly.

The news that horizon wanted to obtain was merely something that the dragon palace had intentionally allowed him to obtain.

“I reckon that when Miss Beishuang leaves tomorrow, it will be the time for Patriarch Tian Ya to make his move.”

Ba Qi said faintly.

“Be fully prepared by tomorrow.”

Wang Xian said to Tian Chen who was at the side.

“Yes!”

Tian Chen nodded.

“Wang Xian, we have to leave. We have to continue to fight.”

On the morning of the second day, Di Xingnu walked out of her room. She stretched and said with a smile on her face.

“Okay, be careful.”

Wang Xian nodded at her faintly.

“Don’t worry. With sister bei Shuang and the Dragon Guards by our side, we won’t be in any danger.”

Di Xingnu said with a smile.

“Don’t worry, master. We’ll be very careful.”

Bei Shuang said from the side.

“Okay, go ahead.”

Wang Xian said.

The two of them nodded and walked out immediately.

“Bei Shuang, Xingnu. A few hours ago, deacon Ying came to us and invited us to hunt down an abyssal race. They have already investigated the strength of that abyssal race. Their harvest should be quite substantial. Do you think we should...”. “...”

Just as the two of them walked out of the courtyard, a few hundred people walked over and asked them.

“Deacon Ying?”

Upon hearing this, Di Xingnu frowned slightly.

“Yes, it’s that... team you’re in.”

The leader of the group looked at her and said.

The person she was talking about was the father of Di Xingnu, Di haosong.

“It’s fine. He’s him, I’m me. It has nothing to do with me. Senior sister, did you agree to Deacon Ying’s invitation?”

Di Xingnu relaxed her brows and asked.

The current her was doing much better than her father. With her current position in the Emperor Court, some deacons would be polite to her, not her father.

The main thing was that she had an undying level 8 and 3 undying level 7 guards.

And her undying level 5 Space Serpent War Pet.

“Not yet, if you don’t have any objections, I’ll agree to the Deacon’s invitation.”

The empress shook her head and said with a smile.

“Agree.”

The Empress said directly.

“Okay, let’s go directly. They will set off soon.”

The empress nodded and then the group flew forward.

Soon, seven to eight hundred people gathered on a mountain peak in front of the planet.

“Deacon Ying, this time, we girls will fight side by side with you.”

The group of people came to the front of the mountain peak. The Empress, who was in the lead, said with a smile.

“Hahaha, welcome to the top. Welcome to the group of Heaven’s chosen. Welcome to the goddess of Frost. Welcome to the star Lady.”

...

On the mountain peak, an old man immediately went up to welcome them. He said with a face full of laughter.

The group of people also turned their gazes over. Their gazes landed on bei Shuang and the Empress who were more dazzling.

“Di haosong, your daughter.”

At the back, a woman smiled as she looked at the middle-aged man.

Di Haosong heard her words and remained expressionless.

“Speaking of which, Brother Haosong’s daughter is a hot topic in the imperial court.”

A middle-aged man looked over and said.

“It’s a pity that our lothario di Haosong didn’t treat them well. In the end, the two women didn’t acknowledge him. Haha.”

A middle-aged man said with some schadenfreude.

“Shut up!”

Di Haosong’s face sank as he said with embarrassment.

...

“Hehe, it was just a joke.”

A middle-aged man next to him said with a chuckle. He didn’t care about it. Clearly, he wasn’t afraid of him.

“With the Frost Goddess and the star lady, it will be much easier to hunt down the abyssal race. Let’s go. We will set off immediately.”

In front, Deacon Ying spoke to them.

“Alright.”

The group of girls nodded. Then, under the lead of Deacon Ying, they immediately flew towards the direction of the Abyss.

“Has the news spread out?”

At the same time, Wang Xian and the rest appeared not far behind them.

“Dragon King, the news has spread. The planet where the world margin sect is located is not far from here. With the speed of the world margin patriarch, he can intercept them before they enter the Abyss.”

“I wonder if the world margin patriarch will attack after entering the abyss or before he enters.”

Ba Qi said from the side.

“Ao Qitian, Tian Zhen, pay attention to the direction of the world margin sect.”

Wang Xian said.

“Yes!”

The two of them nodded.

Then, they followed from afar.

After flying out of the range of the planet, Northern Frost Imperial Star Lady and the rest flew towards the left side of the Abyss.

Their objective this time was to fly for more than five hours.

In front of the entrance of the abyss, they could see countless people entering and exiting.

It was not an exaggeration to say that the number of people entering the abyss could reach billions of people every day.

“If you want to blame someone, blame yourself for being the Dragon King’s disciple.”

At this moment, a wisp of white flame was drifting in the void at a terrifying speed to the right of the imperial star’s daughter, bei Shuang, and the rest.

A pair of eyes filled with murderous intent emerged from the flame as they stared at bei Shuang who was in front of them.

They were waiting for the best opportunity.

“Dragon King!”

“I see him!”

At this moment, Wang Xian and the rest who were also hiding behind noticed the white flames.

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly as the dragon eyes of the Yin-yang five elements flickered.

“Be prepared. It’s easy for a peak immortal King to kill an immortal king level eight. Don’t let him hurt bei Shuang.”

He said.

“Don’t worry, Dragon King.”

Tian Chen and Ao Qitian nodded and were ready.

“This is the time!”

When bei Shuang and the rest had flown for three hours, there were fewer people around them.

A low roar came from the Wisp of white flames.

The Flames on his body intensified. He locked onto bei Shuang at a terrifying speed and attacked.

“Attack!” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

On Wang Xian’s side, Ao Qitian, the Heaven Array, Ao Jian, and the others also moved instantly.
