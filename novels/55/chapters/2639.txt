2640 2640 Moon Bay mutated and headed to the imperial court

“What’s the situation?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows. His body moved and he immediately came to the Dragon King’s Palace!

“HMM? It’s Moon Bay!”

Looking at the right side of the dragon throne, Wang Xian immediately went to the side!

Moon Bay in the ancient pond was a treasure that was traded during the exchange. It was one of the most precious treasures of the Elf race!

He had kept Moon Bay here for a few days. He hadn’t paid attention to its situation for the past few days!

Looking at Moon Bay, Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled!

There was a crack on the surface of Moon Bay that he traded with previously. Furthermore, it looked like an ancient lake. It was an ancient lake without anything!

At this moment, there were drops of sparkling and resplendent liquid in Moon Bay!

There were very few drops of liquid. There were only five to six drops that dripped down from the branches above!

One drop was as red as fire, one drop of lightning flickered, one drop of green light lingered around, and another drop was gray!

There was another drop in the middle that was as transparent as a crystal!

Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled. His eyes were filled with curiosity!

“Eternal flame, Nirvana lightning liquid, ingestion of ordinary liquid, soul-returning liquid, and Vitality Liquid!”

Information appeared in his mind one by one, causing his eyes to sparkle!

The first four drops of fluid were considered to be of little value because they were equivalent to one-twentieth of the effects of the endless embryo fruits!

From Wang Xian’s point of view, the soul-returning fluid was just a little more magical. It possessed a rather powerful ability!

It was a drop of the user’s blood on the soul-returning fluid. If the user was killed and the main body was completely destroyed, the blood on the soul-returning fluid would be activated and be reborn!

Although this ability was still lacking compared to the soul-returning embryo fruit, it was already heaven-defying enough!

It was truly equivalent to a second life!

Such a treasure was priceless!

However, there was a limit to this. This soul-returning liquid could only be used once!

In other words, no matter how much soul-returning liquid you had, you could only be revived once!

The effects of the eternal flame and Nirvana Lightning liquid were even worse!

Of course, this was in Wang Xian’s opinion. In fact, the eternal flame and Nirvana Lightning liquid had the ability to change one’s physique. It could turn one’s physique into a powerful divine body and increase one’s cultivation speed greatly!

The last drop of the vitality liquid was condensed from the Moon Bay in the ancient lake. A drop of it could heal one’s injuries instantly, no matter how severe the injury was!

Moreover, this vitality liquid had the ability to remove poison!

It was also a rare treasure!

“This liquid may seem ordinary to me, but its value is definitely priceless in the outside world. Especially the soul-returning liquid, it’s equivalent to a Second Life!”

Wang Xian looked at the liquid and mumbled to himself!

He didn’t dare to sell the indestructible embryo or the nirvana thunder embryo fruit. However, he could sell these few drops of liquid!

His face revealed a contemplative expression. A single fruit could turn a person into an origin body. This effect was too heaven-defying!

Even if the Dragon Palace were to sell one, it would be coveted by countless factions!

However, the effects of these drops of liquid were not too heaven-defying. Instead, they could be sold!

“Just that drop of soul-returning liquid alone could raise my strength by one rank!”

He muttered!

Such a life saving item could even move the void God Emperor!

If one were to exchange a drop of soul returning liquid for a undying god King Level 9 abyss seed corpse, to the large sects, they would definitely be willing to exchange!

“Last month, the large sects didn’t have the strength to kill an undying god King Level 9 abyss seed, the possibility of them buying it is quite low!”

“However, if it’s in the imperial court, I can definitely sell it for a good price!”

Wang Xian muttered to himself as he looked deep in thought!

I can follow the Imperial Star Lady to the imperial court!

As for the Demon Island, I can only let Prime Minister Heaven Array Turtle and the rest take care of it first!

After all, it was also very important for me to gather the resources to improve!

“Xiao Xian, the effect of this liquid seems to be much worse than the fruit!”

Tang Yinxuan said as she sized up the liquid in Moon Bay!

“HMM, other than the vitality liquid, the rest are much worse than the fruit. However, it can be sold. I’m planning to go to the imperial court with di Xing ‘er!”

Wang Xian nodded and said to her!

“Do you want to go? If you go, I’m sure the celestial maiden will be very happy!”

Tang Yinxuan said with a smile on her face!

“Go. Firstly, sell these liquids. Secondly, that girl has helped Qing Yue and the rest no matter what!”

Wang Xian nodded. She had a very good impression of the celestial maiden!

“Where is that girl? I’ll let her know!”

...

As Wang Xian spoke, he came to the residence of Di Xingnu!

“Xingnu, I’ll accompany you tomorrow!”

Tang Yinxuan followed him. When she saw di Xingnu, she smiled and said!

“Wow, at least you have a conscience, Wang Xian. Hehe, it’s good that you’re following me. When the time comes, I’ll suppress everyone in the imperial court and let them know how powerful I, Di Xingnu, am!”

When the imperial star Lady learned that Wang Xian was going with her, she revealed an excited expression on her face!

With Wang Xian following her, she really wanted to know which disciple in the imperial court could be compared to her this time!

She was very clear about the current strength of the Dragon Palace!

“Oh, I’m mainly going to your imperial court to sell some things!”

Wang Xian said indifferently!

“HMPH, can’t You Say Something Nice?”

Emperor Star Lady was slightly stunned when she heard his words. Then, she glared at him fiercely!

...

“Let’s go to the imperial court from the Northern line of the Demon Island Tomorrow!”

Wang Xian smiled and said to her!

“Alright!”

Emperor Star Lady nodded her head!

The next day, Wang Xian brought a few drops of liquid along with Emperor Star Lady and Aunt Ying to the Northern line of the Demon Island through the teleportation formation of the Dragon Palace!

“The entire northern side of the imperial star field has been invaded by the abyss. I heard that there is a huge crisis lurking in our imperial court. It is very likely that a war will break out!”

When Emperor Star Lady arrived at the Northern Line and saw the Abyss at the side, she said with a solemn expression!

“The Abyss can threaten the imperial court? Your Imperial Court should have a few void God realm emperors, right?”

Wang Xian looked at her and asked in puzzlement! RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“The Abyss has existed in the imperial star field for billions of years. There are also abyss seeds at the level of void God emperors in there!”

“It’s just that I don’t know why the Abyss dares to invade us this time!”

The Imperial Star Lady shook her head and looked around. “On the Northern line, there is only one planet that can be teleported to our imperial court. It’s called the inviting Moon Planet!”

“Yes, let’s go to the inviting Moon Planet!”

Wang Xian nodded and flew forward!

“Dragon King!”

However, when Wang Xian flew to the side of the Dragon Peak, a disciple of the Dragon Palace shouted!

“Yes? What’s the matter?”

He raised his eyebrows and asked!

“Dragon King, the experts from the Dragon Python group are here to pay a visit. Since you are not here, we will not disturb you!”

“They sent over a divine sword. They said that you were the one who traded this divine sword to the experts from the Dragon Python group. That trader died and is now returning it to us!”

As the member of the Dragon Palace spoke, he handed over the Dragon Blood Sword!

“Huh?”

Wang Xian was slightly taken aback as he took the Dragon Blood Sword!
