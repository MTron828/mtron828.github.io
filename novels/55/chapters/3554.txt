3555 The panicking Great Beings of the Holy Dragon Bloodline

“How can there be so many pinnacle great beings in Your Dragon Palace? How is this possible?”

The Holy Dragon Bloodline had 10 universe masters with level-three Combat Power, and over 20 universe masters with level-two Combat Power.

They looked at the scene in front of them and found it unbelievable!

Over 10 universe masters with level-three Combat Power?

The Holy Dragon bloodline had developed for countless years, and the angel race had rewarded them with some resources!

But what about Dragon Palace?

How long had it been, and it had already gained such terrifying power!

Most importantly, that Dragon King, the terrifying Dragon Palace!

He killed the Holy Dragon Son in three moves!

The Holy Dragon Son had two connate true treasures!

“Run, run, run! Run Now!”

Seeing the Great Beings of Dragon Palace charging at them, the 10 pinnacle great beings of the sacred dragon lineage did not hesitate and roared!

Run!

With the power of Dragon Palace, they were no longer a match for them!

This was the territory of Dragon Palace. If they were not careful, they might die here!

In addition, the 10 pinnacle great beings could still defend a little.

However, more than 20 universe masters with level-two combat power couldn’t withstand the attacks of the Dragon Palace!

They didn’t hesitate to flee!

“There’s a space-restricting array around us. Break this array!”

A light dragon roared in shock and anger!

“I’ll do it! Break It!”

The Light Dragon in the center roared, and a pair of scissors appeared in the sky above him.

The scissors were grey and looked as though they didn’t have any attributes!

The pair of scissors opened up and cut towards the void!

The Divine Light Dragon Phantom around them started to collapse rapidly!

“What? He’s the Dragon King. They have a powerful innate treasure in their hands!”

At the lower position, the heaven formation was slightly shocked when it saw its anti-air formation being broken!

“Kill as many as you can!”

Wang Xian’s gaze locked onto a divine light dragon and instantly arrived at his side!

“Scram!”

The expression of the divine light dragon changed drastically. It stirred up a terrifying dragon’s might and brought along endless power of light as it swept towards Wang Xian’s direction! ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Faced with Wang Xian’s attack, he didn’t dare to be the slightest bit careless. The moment he made his move, he used his law projection!

Wang Xian’s expression didn’t change as the light swept across. The tai chi dragon around him revolved and his spirit waved the staff in his hand. A stream of energy covered his entire body!

“Die!”

Wang Xian’s arm turned into a dragon claw and clawed at the tail of the Divine Dragon of light!

“You’re courting death!”

When the Divine Dragon of light saw that Wang Xian dared to attack with his dragon tail, his expression turned ferocious!

This Dragon King was probably looking for trouble!

However, in the next second, his ferocious expression froze!

He felt that his dragon tail had collided with a terrifying force. An extremely powerful rebounding force rushed into his body!

“PFFT!”

He could not help but spit out a mouthful of fresh blood. He was severely injured in an instant!

Following that, he felt the world spinning. Waves of terrifying energy surged into his body and his life force rapidly disappeared!

“Bang!”

His body crashed heavily in front of the Dragon Palace. His life force gradually disappeared!

The second divine light dragon was killed instantly!

At this moment, a level three universe dominator without an innate supreme treasure could not even withstand a single move from Wang Xian!

“Kill!”

After the second divine dragon was killed, Wang Xian immediately locked onto the next moment!

“Not good, not good, third brother has been killed!”

The death of this divine light dragon caused the expressions of the surrounding experts of the Holy Dragon lineage to change drastically. They roared in fear!

Their faces were filled with shock!

A level three universe overlord with combat strength was killed in an instant?

Was the Dragon King of Dragon Palace a terrifying universe overlord?

How could he be so powerful?

“Fight with all your might!”

The Universe Overlord with level 3 Combat Power, the Light Dragon God, glanced down and roared in fear!

If they didn’t fight with all their might, if they didn’t run, they would all be killed!

Why was Dragon Palace so powerful?

Now, they finally understood why the Dragon Palace didn’t run away when they found out that they were coming!

Because the Dragon Palace wasn’t afraid of them at all!

They even felt that it would be difficult for them to kill the Dragon King alone!

It was too terrifying!

Boom! Boom! Boom

In the next moment, all the experts of the Sacred Dragon bloodline released their strongest energy in fear!

They wanted to escape!

“Cut the Air!”

The Divine Light Dragon with the innate supreme treasure roared and directly cut the space around his companion!

The space around his companion seemed to have been cut off, forming a separate space!

He quickly returned to his divine kingdom!

“Boom!”

Ao Qitian flew towards him, but was blocked by the strange space!

A light godly dragon was escaping!

“Ah! Ah! No! No!”

However, at this moment, a scream was heard again!

“What?”

The Pinnacle Great Beings of the Holy Dragon Branch, who were holding true treasures, looked over, and their eyes instantly turned blood-red!

More than 20 Great Beings of the Holy Dragon Branch, who were fighting level two universe masters, let out screams!

A dark and light figure was rapidly harvesting their lives!

They couldn’t resist at all!

“Thorned dragon seed, this is a strange thorned dragon seed!”

The Holy Dragon Great being who was holding an innate true treasure roared.

“Run!”

He controlled his innate true treasure to isolate his own space, and then he cut the space around his other companion!

“Run! Have you asked me?”

Water Touch Emperor roared, and drops of seawater covered the space that was cut off, completely blocking it!

The water current surged into the space, blocking the escape of the expert from the Holy Dragon lineage!

“What kind of attack is this? What kind of strange attack is this?”

The expert from the Holy Dragon lineage roared in disbelief.

With the obstruction of the water energy, he would be interrupted instantly when he returned to his divine kingdom!

“You are courting death!”

At this moment, Wang Xian’s figure flashed and attacked the Divine Light Dragon who was holding the innate treasure!

“Oh no, that Dragon King has locked onto me. He has locked onto me!”

At this moment, even though he was in a special space, the expert from the Holy Dragon lineage broke out in cold sweat instantly.

After witnessing Wang Xian’s strength, he didn’t dare to go against him!

The expert from the Holy Dragon lineage who was holding the innate treasure gritted his teeth. The grayish scissors in front of him slashed backward, creating a terrifying black hole in an instant!

“Run for your lives, Run!”

He didn’t dare to care about his other companions. He entered the black hole and disappeared!

“Ah!”

At this time, another scream came!

“Bird Man’s dog, die!”

The tentacles of the water-tentacle king squeezed into the space that was cut open and wrapped around the light dragon!

“Howl! Howl! Howl!”

Another scream was heard. Another level three universe master from the bloodline of the Holy Dragon died!

“No, no! Dragon Tail, explode!”

The level three universe masters from the bloodline of the Holy Dragon panicked when they saw this scene!

A great being exploded his dragon tail, creating a space for him to escape!
