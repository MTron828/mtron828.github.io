“I don’t have any land, I don’t need a mule, I don’t need a horse, I just need a servant!”

Hearing what Feng Lingtian said, Xiao Yu’s lips curled up!

“Alright, if I can get out today, I, the crown prince, will be your servant!”

Feng Lingtian gritted his teeth and scanned his surroundings vigilantly.

“Hehe, I will definitely take you in as a servant!”

The bone whip in Xiao Yu’s hand began to grow longer and slowly split into more than ten pieces.

“So it’s still a pair of lovebirds. It’s so good to have a companion on the road!”

“Kill!”

The white-bearded elder saw Xiao Yu’s confident expression and his eyes revealed a cold expression as he shouted.

In an instant, a terrifying blade light and sword light formed and the aura of a golden mountain filled the surroundings.

Feng Lingtian’s expression changed drastically.

“Pu Pu Pu Pu!”

However, at the instant his opponent attacked, piercing sounds could be heard.

“Not good, there are people around!”

A middle-aged man saw a white figure suddenly appear behind the old man in front of him, and his terrifying claws directly pierced through his body. His expression changed drastically as he shouted loudly.

“Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang!”

The four strange demons directly pushed down the four corpses. Their bodies were suffused with white light as they retreated backward!

The white light began to slowly dim. Ten seconds later, it disappeared again.

The four white figures that suddenly appeared instantly attacked and killed four people. One of them was even a half-step immortal god.

The people from the Chaos Origin Immortal sect were stunned. Their faces were filled with fear as they hurriedly stopped the attacks in their hands.

Feng Lingtian was also stunned as he stared at the corpses on the ground in disbelief.

“Gulp... they... those four figures, that...”

“That what? My Brother sent them to protect me. Your father is an immortal God, why didn’t he send some experts to protect you? Seriously!”

Xiao Yu glared at Feng Lingtian and said unhappily.

“What the F * ck!”

The corner of Feng Lingtian’s mouth couldn’t help but Twitch. His brother sent him here to protect her?

With his strength reaching the infant realm, how could his father still send people to protect him.

For an infant realm expert, you could only send people to protect an infant realm expert at most. Why couldn’t you send a half-step immortal God to protect him?

There were only three or four half-step immortal gods in the entire immortal sect!

Was this possible? impossible.

With his strength, there wasn’t much need to send an infant realm expert to protect him. This was because his strength was already strong enough among the infant realm. If he really encountered a strong enemy, he could run even if he couldn’t win.

But now, compared to this young miss in front of him, he was simply a poor prince!

The other party was already a terrifying existence of half-step immortal gods. It didn’t say that there were ten infant realm experts following him on the surface.

There were even four terrifying hidden experts in the dark, killing one half-step immortal God and three infant realm experts with a single move.

Amazing!

This protective force was practically invincible under the current situation where the immortal God was forbidden to make a move!

“This grandaunt is F * cking awesome, my little life is finally saved!” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Feng Lingtian’s eyes revealed an excited expression, almost waving his flag and shouting.

“Little slave, calm down, there’s still one half-step immortal God and nine infant realm experts!”

Xiao Yu waved his hand at him with a smile on his face.

“Cha, Hehe, there’s still a bunch of scum like them. Young Miss, you can handle them all by yourself!”

After surviving the calamity, Feng Lingtian gave up on his bottom line and said with excitement.

“You... how is this possible!”

The white-bearded old man widened his eyes and scanned his surroundings vigilantly. His scalp was slightly numb.

There were actually four terrifying experts who were good at hiding around her to protect her.

What kind of F * * King identity did she have to have such experts to protect her?

Didn’t they say that she was from a faction in the pugilistic world? When did she become so perverted to casually send four such terrifying existences to protect a young girl.

F * ck!

The remaining eleven people did not even need to attack Feng Lingtian and Xiao Yu. Now, it was time for them to be wary of the attacks around them.

They tried their best to sense their surroundings, but they did not sense anyone. This made their expressions even more awkward.

“It’s our turn to attack. Don’t be so useless. Pick two and leave the rest to me!”

Xiao Yu held the bone whip in his hand and swung it forward. More than ten bone whips were like poisonous snakes, coiling around the experts one after another.

“Haha, if you want to kill this young master, this young master will kill all of you today!”

Feng Lingtian’s face revealed an excited expression. The six spirit swords in his interspatial ring instantly attacked the two infant realm experts.

“Damn it!”

The faces of the people from the chaotic origin immortal sect were extremely unsightly.

The side that originally surrounded and attacked was actually attacked now.

“Kill!”

The experts from the chaotic origin immortal sect braced themselves and instantly went up to meet the attack.

Numerous golden sword lights and saber lights slashed towards the bone whip!

“HMPH, you think you can kill me? !”

Xiao Yu snorted coldly. The bone whip in her hand shook, and numerous sword lights and saber lights directly scattered.

Her body moved, and she stood up to attack the white-bearded elder.

“Chaos Golden Saber!”

The white-bearded Elder’s expression changed slightly. He gritted his teeth, and the golden saber in his hand trembled. A resplendent saber light seemed as if it was about to pierce through the void, slashing towards Xiao Yu.

“Peng!”

The shield in Xiao Yu’s left hand blocked, easily blocking the elder’s chaos Golden Saber.

“You’re courting death!”

She waved her right hand continuously, and bone whips that emitted terrifying demonic qi shot towards the nine people around her.

“Peng Peng Peng!”

Golden door-shaped defenses appeared in front of them, blocking the bone whips.

“Ahhhhh!”

Right at this moment, four miserable cries sounded, and four terrifying white figures appeared once again.

“Haha, Awesome!”

When Feng Lingtian heard the miserable shrieks from the side, he turned around and revealed an excited expression.

“It’s over!”

Four more infant realm experts had died and there were only seven out of fifteen of them.

The seven experts from the chaos origin immortal sect revealed expressions of despair.

“Sir, quickly remove the formation and let us out!”

The white-bearded old man’s eyes revealed a look of fear as he shouted loudly.

Everyone was originally in the chaos origin formation to prevent Feng Lingtian and Xiao Yu from escaping.

However, it had now become their cage, making it difficult for them to escape!

Everyone was terrified and wanted to order the immortal god controlling the formation to remove it.

At this moment, four to five people were standing in the air above them. Their expressions were extremely ugly.

“Sir, elder Jin and the others... have failed. Should we remove the array formation?”

An old man said with some fear on his face.

The flawless ambush attack and even the use of the immortal sect’s chaos origin array had actually failed.

That terrifying four white shadows and that powerful girl.

Even if they were watching from here, they felt their scalps go numb and some fear.

The body of the middle-aged immortal God in the center was slightly trembling, and his eyes were filled with a crazy killing intent!

“No need. Call all the infant realm experts of the immortal sect over, and bring over the immortal blasting stones!”
