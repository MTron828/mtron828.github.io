Chapter 3950: No. 3949 Mingyi Saint Academy, Lower Your Head! Lower Your Head

Translator: 549690339

The strong should not be humiliated.

Sometimes, this sentence was not unreasonable.

Now, the three principals of Mingyi Saint Academy, who were in the ruler realm, had no idea of Wang Xian’s actual strength.

However, they did not dare to offend him completely.

Even if Wang Xian had already killed some of the strong practitioners of Mingyi Saint Academy.

This was because if they could not kill Wang Xian, with the strength of the Songyi Saint Academy, provoking a powerhouse in the ruler realm would bring great trouble to the Songyi Saint Academy.

The simplest thing was that when a powerhouse in the ruler realm targeted the students and teachers of their academy, they could not do anything about it.

It was even possible that they would fall completely because of it.

Therefore, they had to lower their heads to Wang Xian.

They could only lower their heads.

This was something that they had no choice but to do.

Most importantly, it was the spatial saint son of the Songyi Saint Academy who had provoked this existence first.

“Wu Qitian and his father should have been resurrected. Leave their lives to me and Pll leave.”

Wang Xian spoke when he heard the three principals ‘words.

The three principals could only nod their heads helplessly and report to their subordinates, “Bring Wu Qitian and Wu Zhihong over! ”

The few powerhouses nodded their heads immediately and responded. Their bodies moved and they flew back immediately.

“May I know where this friend comes from?”

The few subordinates brought Wu Qitian and his father over. The principal in the middle looked at Wang Xian and couldn’t help but ask.

“They came from afar! ”

Wang Xian replied indifferently.

The principal nodded and didn’t ask further. He was afraid that the conflict would escalate!

“No, no, no. Elder, save me, save me!”

At this moment, screams of pain could be heard.

An extremely weak young man and middle-aged man were brought over.

They were Wu Qitian and Wu Zhihong who had been resurrected.

However, at this moment, they had offended someone whom they could not afford to offend. Hence, they were completely given up by the Ming Yi Saint Academy.

Whoosh

Wu Qitian and Wu Zhihong were brought over and thrown directly at Wang Xian.

The experts from the Ming Yi Saint Academy looked on silently. Their faces were filled with helplessness.

“No, no, no!”

After Wu Qitian saw Wang Xian’s figure, a look of horror and despair appeared on his face.

His body trembled violently. He looked at his father and the three principals with a pleading look.

When Wu Zhihong saw this scene, his body only trembled violently. His face was filled with unwillingness.

He didn’t expect that the enemy he provoked would be so terrifying.

He also understood that Ming Yi Saint Academy had already given up on him and his son.

He was filled with fear and dread towards Wang Xian.

The strength of this mysterious young man was too strong.

“Bastard, why did you provoke such an existence?”

He couldn’t help but berate his son.

“Just be more careful in your next life! ”

Wang Xian said to him faintly. With a wave of his arm, a wave of energy enveloped them.

Before he killed Wu Zhihong, he had conveniently absorbed his memories!

“At least you guys from the Ming Yi Saint Academy are sensible enough to avoid the danger of annihilation! ”

After Wang Xian killed the two of them, his gaze swept across the three principals of the Ming Yi Saint Academy as well as the group of experts.

His body moved and he flew into the distance.

Boom

At this moment, Wang Xian revealed a faint pressure.

Bang! Bang! Bang

Under this pressure, the three principals who were suspended in the air fell directly to the ground.

They crashed heavily onto the ground. Their faces were filled with paleness and shock.

Gulp

“How… How is this possible?”

“What kind of existence is he?”

The three principals shouted in shock.

However, the universe knight level beings around them were also lying on the ground, their bodies trembling violently. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

This was the terrifying pressure from the outside world, and their souls were trembling.

It took them more than 10 seconds to react.

The three deans stood up with lingering fear, and they looked at each other. “What level is this great being?”

One of the deans couldn’t help but growl.

“I don’t know. Absolute universe masters above level five can make us unable to move, this…”

The other Dean was terrified!

“How did this damn Wu Qitian offend such an existence?”

The last Dean said with a gloomy expression and looked at his subordinates.

“Principal, according to the information we received, this mysterious expert is a student of our Songyi Saint Academy’s Elementary Academy. He is an eternal swordsman with the spatial attribute. No one knew that he would be so terrifying. ”

One of his subordinates spoke with a bitter expression.

From the pressure they had felt just now, if they hadn’t admitted defeat, the entire Songyi Saint Academy might have already suffered a calamity. “A student from the elementary academy? Spatial attribute?”

Hearing this, the three principals narrowed their eyes.

“In that case, the mirror flower in the mirror world was taken away by this person?”

“It should be him, or it could only be him. However, the things he left behind are much more precious than the mirror flower. ”

The three principals spoke and shook their heads slightly.

“The continent is huge. With a flash, there is still a mountain high up. Compared to the central continent, our place is already very remote. To think that there are still such terrifying powerhouses roaming around. ”

The central principal sighed slightly.

There was still lingering fear in his heart.

This time, it could be considered as the luck of the Ming Yi Saint Academy.

They had encountered a powerhouse who was not bloodthirsty.

If they were to encounter someone who would wipe out their entire clan with a single word of disagreement, the Ming Yi Saint Academy would be finished.

“Let’s Find a place to cultivate! ”

After flying out of the Ming Yi Saint Academy, Wang Xian revealed a smile on his face.

In the past 20,000 years, although Wang Xian’s strength didn’t increase by much, his understanding of this universe had increased by a lot.

Furthermore, he had the overlord-level mirrored flower in his hands.

These mirrored flowers were sufficient for him to advance to the level of a universe knight very quickly.

Wang Xian floated in the sky and flew forward according to the memories in his mind.

After flying for a few days, he arrived in front of an ocean.

This was a vast ocean. According to the memories he obtained, there were a large number of demonic beasts living in this ocean.

There were even terrifying demonic beasts on the level of the Masters of the universe.

As a divine dragon, Wang Xian preferred places in the ocean.

He was prepared to build a cave abode here to cultivate!

After entering the ocean, Wang Xian swam towards the center.

After flying for a week, he found a good spot.

Following that, he waved his arm and built a cave abode.

Following that, Wang Xian took out the mirror-image flower and began to cultivate.

He wanted to use up all of the mirror-image flowers and raise his space attribute to its limit.

Then he was going to the center of the universe!
