“Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!”

When the heaven array fused with the brambles, the strength of the two brambles had a huge increase. More than 10,000 brambles had a huge change.

The diameter of each bramble increased by two to three meters. On the brambles, there was a faint pressure. There was a dragon-shaped phantom flickering on it.

Thorn after Thorn flew towards the bones and ribs of the human-shaped peak god King.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

The human-shaped peak god King’s Abyss Seed’s head was filled with anger when it saw the thorns flying towards it.

“Boom!”

At the next moment, tens of thousands of bones and ribs instantly bloomed with black flames. The Flames were strange and filled with the ability to corrode.

Crack! Crack! Crack

However, the thorns were covered with a layer of dragon scales and continued to entangle the bones.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

The thorns entwined around the bones and firmly bound them.

“Roar! Roar!”

When the head saw this scene, its face was full of fear as it hurriedly dodged to the side.

“You want to escape? Wishful Thinking.”

One of the dragon heads in the middle of the thorny monster let out a cold voice.

The dense thorny vines attacked.

“Crash!”

However, just as the countless thorny vines were about to cover its head, the entire head split open and split into pieces to escape the attack of the thorny vines.

The entire head was split into pieces.

Eyes, teeth, nose, ears, all of them fled in all directions.

“HM? This abyss seed is so strange, it feels like a living machine.”

Tian Chen looked at the human form Undying Pinnacle Abyss seed in shock.

Such a strange creature, even with his previous experience, he was shocked and amazed.

His eyes gleamed, controlling the brambles to capture it alive.

Boom Boom Boom

Just as Prime Minister Turtle and the others were completely suppressing the peak level undying godly monarch abyss seed.

Below, Wang Xian led ao Yao, Ao Qi, and Ao Qitian to kill the Level 9 undying godly monarch abyss seeds one by one.

Around them, the legions of the Dragon Palace were also killing the abyss seeds one by one.

The 10,000 people of the Dragon Palace formed an army, each army had 4 undying level 7 abyss species.

The imperial dragon species defended, the berserk dragon species attacked.

At the back, the Dolphins were releasing their support energy.

With the Dolphins’support, the imperial dragon species could defend against the powerful attacks, the berserk dragon species could kill without fear.

They didn’t need to worry about their own lives.

The berserk attacks quickly harvested the abyssal species.

In the Dragon Palace, the combat strength was no lower than the level 8 eternal lord.

The combat strength of the god-king level Dragon Palace was almost double that of the abyssal species. With such a lineup and strength, it was a complete massacre.

However, there were bound to be casualties in the war. Even though the Dragon Palace was very powerful, the unexpected attacks still caused many members of the Dragon Palace to be injured.

After all, there were hundreds of millions of abyss seeds, and the number was too huge.

However, this loss was completely within the acceptable range of the Dragon Palace. In fact, it was even less than expected.

Earth-shattering roars and roars continued to be heard in the abyss.

“The eighth one!”

Ten minutes later, Wang Xian, Ao Qitian, and Ao Yao had already killed eight of them.

In the entire abyss, half of the Level 9 immortal King Abyss seeds had been killed.

The remaining eight were also heavily injured under the siege of the experts from the Dragon Palace.

“Ao Qitian, you guys kill the level 8 immortal King Abyss Seed. Ao Yao, let’s continue!”

After Wang Xian gave the order, he immediately flew forward.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Ao qitian waved his ocean-pacifying needle and flew straight down.

There was no longer a need for so many experts to fight on the level 9 immortal king side.

“Sect leader last month, let’s surround and kill them.”

Wang Xian revealed a smile on his face. With a move of his body, he arrived at sect leader last month’s side.

At this moment, sect leader last month and one of their ancestors were surrounding and attacking one of them.

...

Although they could not kill it, they could still fight with ease.

“Alright!”

Upon seeing Wang Xian’s arrival, the two of them revealed a smile.

“Kill!”

Following that, Wang Xian, sect leader last month, and the other three instantly surrounded and attacked the immortal King Abyss seed.

In less than a minute, they killed it easily.

“Dragon King, let’s go and help old Feng and the rest. The four of us can take care of that one.”

After killing this immortal king level nine abyss seed, an elder from the great sect last month said with a smile.

“Alright, be careful.”

Wang Xian nodded. He locked onto the abyss seed that was fighting Ao he and the rest and immediately attacked.

“This war is about to be won.” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

...

Last month’s sect leader and the rest saw the battle around them. Regardless of whether it was from above or below, the Dragon Palace’s experts had completely suppressed them.

“The members of the Dragon Palace are all extremely talented and powerful. After this battle, I’m afraid the nine clouds great sect will have to be respectful to the Dragon Palace.”

Forefather of last month said.

“Let’s go. We can’t force the Dragon Palace to retreat. We have to destroy a level nine abyssal seed as soon as possible last month.”

Forefather of last month roared with a smile on his face.

“Surround and kill!”

The two of them rushed over and immediately roared at the other two forefathers.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

When the battle had lasted for fifteen minutes, an extremely miserable roar came from the sky.

“Did you get rid of one?”

When Wang Xian heard this voice, a smile appeared on his face. He raised his head and looked at the sky.

In front of Prime Minister Gui and the others and a thorny monster, the peak-stage immortal king level abyssal seed with four wings was in an extremely miserable state. Its head was directly entangled by the thorny vines and its vitality was rapidly disappearing.

“This old man from Sky Formation is bragging. He said that he got rid of two peak-stage immortal king level abyssal seeds in 15 minutes. Now, he only got rid of one.”

At this time, Mo Sha’s voice came from the side.

“Keke, maybe he’s senile and didn’t calculate well.”

Ba Qi laughed in agreement.

Wang Xian smiled gently.

“Dragon King, we’re here to help you!”

Prime Minister Gui flew over to Wang Xian with the world’s end ruler. Beams of energy shot directly at the undying god King Level 9 abyssal seeds.

With Prime Minister Gui and the others using the world’s end ruler to attack, the situation became even more relaxed.

One undying level 9 abyssal seed after another was swiftly killed.

After the level 9 abyssal seed was killed, the Dragon Palace Level 9 combat strength killed the level 8, making the speed even faster.

The war began to be one-sided, and the speed at which the abyssal seed was killed increased tenfold.

In the air, the three thorny monsters began to surround and attack the human form God Emperor Pinnacle abyssal seed.

After another 15 minutes, the entire Abyss fell silent, from the initial roar to the final scream.

And now the Silence!

In the entire abyss, only one area was still fighting.

“Half an hour and we still haven’t gotten rid of that pinnacle undying God Emperor, that shouldn’t be!”
