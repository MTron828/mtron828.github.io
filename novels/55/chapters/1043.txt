Chapter 1044: 1045 wasn’t a good person

Translator: 5496903

This was the first time the old woman was so happy to see the Empress.

Even a thousand years ago, when the Empress descended upon the world, she didn’t see the Empress’s current expression.

She looked like a little woman.

But no matter what she looked like, as long as the Empress was happy, she would be happy.

Even if the Empress didn’t take revenge and returned to her fire Lark clan, the Empress would still be their king.

A king above the king of their tribe!

...

“Hey, why didn’t you reply when I sent you a message a few days ago? Are you pretending that you didn’t see it?”

At this moment, Wang Xian was standing in front of a girl with a hot figure who was even taller than him. He looked a little embarrassed.

“I was busy a few days ago, so I didn’t see your message. I’m really sorry!”

He replied with a faint smile.

The woman was Zhang Fengying. When she was strolling on the streets of the Western District, she suddenly bumped into him.

After seeing him, Zhang Fengying walked over with an angry face.

He had indeed received a few messages from her in the past few days, but because he had been busy forging weapons and refining pills for the past two days, he hadn’t replied.

“Humph, is that so?”

Zhang fengying sized him up coldly. With a straight face, she placed her hands in front of her chest.

In this state, Wang Xian felt that her hands were a little heavy.

“Miss Zhang, is there anything you need from me?”

Wang Xian asked with a smile.

“Yes...”

When Zhang Fengying heard Wang Xian’s words, she did not know why she was looking for him. She just felt that Wang Xian was a little mysterious and wanted to know more about him.

For a moment, she didn’t know how to answer him.

“Oh right, is there anything fun and delicious in the Western District? This is my first time here. Why Don’t you bring me around?”

Wang Xian noticed that she was a little embarrassed and followed up.

He had nothing to do now. It was just nice to have a beautiful lady to accompany him.

“Then you’ve found the right person. I’ve lived here for dozens of years and everyone knows about it. Let’s go. Today, I’ll be kind enough to bring you to eat something delicious!”

Zhang Fengying was as fit as her body and said to Wang Xian in a forthright manner.

“Alright, lead the way then!”

Wang Xian smiled and followed Zhang Fengying around.

Zhang Fengying was a forthright girl. She was much older than Wang Xian, but the difference in her lifespan of 500 years was not huge.

“It’s almost noon. Let’s go. I’ll bring you to the most popular restaurant in the Western District. There won’t be any seats if we’re Late!”

Zhang Fengying urged him.

Wang Xian was a little speechless. It must be something you want to eat.

Following behind him, they passed through two small alleys and arrived at a street with relatively fewer people.

However, this street had relatively fewer people.

There were many people gathered in front of a simple and unadorned store. Loud noises came from inside the store.

What surprised Wang Xian was that the owner of the store was not a human. Instead, it was a demonic beast with two horns and three legs that was two meters tall.

“It’s the only restaurant owned by a demonic beast in the entire Donghai City. The owner and his family are very nice. The quality of the food and dishes are definitely among the best in the entire Donghai City!”

As Zhang Fengying spoke, she asked a demonic beast who was serving them, “Are there any private rooms left?”

“There are no private rooms left. The hall is also full. However, there are still seats in the Big Private Room!”

The demonic beast spoke in a familiar human language.

“Take us there. Two people, bring out all of your specialties!”

Zhang Fengying waved her hand and said directly.

“Yes, Miss, please come!”

They followed the attendant into a big room, which had two tables.

The two of them chose one of the tables and sat down.

“Captain Wang, you must have earned quite a lot of spirit stones from the wind chime forest. Are you going to the auction in three days?”

After sitting down, Zhang Fengying asked him with a smile on his face. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Auction? Of course I’m going. Why are you going?”

Wang Xian nodded his head.

“Of course. I would like to see what the half-step void interpretation level demonic beast bloodline looks like. It’s a half-step void interpretation level!”

Zhang Fengying said with some yearning.

The Zhang family’s bloodline was at the peak of level eight transcendence. Once it reached level eight transcendence, it would be unable to advance any further.

Unless, she could obtain a higher level bloodline and break the shackles of bloodline.

Wang Xian smiled. “Aren’t you going to the other two auction houses to take a look?”

“I’m not going. Be It pet eggs or demonic beast cubs, they are not something I can buy. Naturally, I’ll go and take a look at the half-step void interpretation level bloodline.”

Zhang Fengying shook her head and said.

“This is the restaurant. It’s definitely the most popular restaurant in the entire Donghai city that you have never eaten before!”

Just as she was speaking, a few people walked in.

Wang Xian took a glance and was slightly stunned. Zhang Fengying took a glance, she continued, “Speaking of which, the Phoenix Immortal and the life-and-death holy item are fighting each other to the death this time. I didn’t expect that the Phoenix Immortal would appear out of nowhere and crush the two families directly. Now, the efforts of the two families previously are all a joke!”

“Especially Phoenix Immortal. This time, she has lost a lot of face. Not only was her own auction suppressed by the life-and-death holy item, but now another Phoenix Immortal has appeared!”

As she spoke, she shook her head and poured a cup of tea for Wang Xian.

“Who lost face? You guys are the ones who lost a lot of face. This time, we will not lose!”

At this moment, a clear and melodious voice filled with anger was heard, causing Zhang Fengying to be slightly stunned.

Wang Xian looked over and saw a cute little loli dressed in red glaring at Zhang Fengying with a pout.

He looked at the three girls and the young man beside him and had some understanding.

“Little girl!”

Zhang Fengying looked at the Little Loli and smiled faintly. She did not argue with her.

“You... you are the little girl. I Am Not Young at all!”

The Little Loli puffed out her chest fiercely.

Zhang Fengying looked at herself and then at the Little Loli. She asked teasingly, “How are you not young?”

The Little Loli didn’t react for a moment. She looked at Zhang Fengying and then at herself. Her expression turned ugly instantly

Compared to Zhang Fengying, she was indeed the smallest.

“Miss, ignore them. They are not good people.”

The young man next to her said to the Little Loli. He looked at Wang Xian with a hint of hatred in his eyes. “They are in cahoots with the life and Death Elixir Workshop.”

“So they are bad guys. HMPH, no wonder they are saying bad things about us. Such bad guys should be beaten up by the Aunties!”

The Little Loli heard the young man’s words and snorted. She looked at Wang Xian and Zhang Fengying with a hateful gaze.

When Zhang Fengying heard the young man and the Little Loli’s words, she frowned slightly. “Mind your words. And you, little girl, don’t be so ignorant!”
