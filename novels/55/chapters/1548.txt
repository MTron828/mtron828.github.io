Chapter 1549: Above and below the 1549 Heaven’s favorites

“Gulp!”

“Oh my God, just how strong is he?”

“He didn’t even give face to the crown prince of Wuqing City and directly beat up the two Peerless Heaven’s favorites of our sect! This is also...”

Until that figure disappeared, the eyes of the rest of the people in the banquet hall were burning with passion. They couldn’t help but say, their voices trembling.

The two peerless geniuses of the Supreme Sect in heaven and earth, who stood high and mighty, questioned and judged that young man in an arrogant manner. In the end, they were directly abused.

They didn’t have the slightest bit of resistance.

They didn’t even give face to the crown prince of Wuqing City. They directly made a move here!

From the beginning to the end, when that priest Wang made a move, the crown prince of Wuqing City didn’t say anything.

“Wu Qing City!”

At this moment, a sinister voice came from the side.

Everyone turned their heads when they heard this voice and quickly looked towards the ground.

Young Master Tian and young master di slowly stood up in a sorry state. Their faces were extremely gloomy and their eyes were filled with a humiliating and crazy killing intent.

“Who... is he? !”

The two of them gritted their teeth and asked word by word in a somewhat crazy manner.

“He is someone you can’t defeat!”

Wu Qingcheng looked at the two heaven’s favorites in the sky and ground and shook his head slowly. He continued, “This time, you have provoked a tough opponent!”

“Tell us, who is he?”

The two of them roared in a low voice and asked again.

“According to the information I got, he doesn’t have any background, but... His strength can completely defeat you!”

“Just as he said, you are no different from ants in front of him!”

Wu Qing Cheng didn’t open his mouth to mock the two of them. After all, he had just been slapped in the face.

“We so-called geniuses are no different from trash in front of him!”

After pondering for a few seconds, Wu Qing Cheng also said with a slight sigh.

How could there be such a monstrous existence in this world.

“What?”

However, when the crowd heard Wu Qing Cheng’s evaluation, they were shocked.

Wu Qing Cheng was the top heaven’s pride in the entire vast region. How could he say that he was trash in front of priest Wang?

This...

However, when they thought about how priest Wang easily abused the Heaven’s pride and Earth’s pride, they fell silent again.

“Above the Heaven’s Pride!”

Wu Qingyan and Wu Qingyan, who were standing beside Wu Qing Cheng, slowly spat out these words.

They didn’t know how to describe this kind of peerless monster. They could only describe him as above the heaven’s pride.

An existence above all the heaven’s pride.

“Above the Heaven’s Pride? Bullsh * t above the heaven’s pride. If he dares to humiliate us today, we will definitely send him to the Netherworld one day. All the peerless experts who haven’t matured aren’t experts. We want him to die!”

Young Master Tian’s face was filled with malevolence as he roared in a low voice.

“We want him dead!”

Young Master di similarly clenched his fist in a malevolent manner.

The two of them exchanged a glance, their eyes filled with killing intent as they walked out.

The people from lone sect who had fallen to the ground hurriedly got up and followed.

Bing Jing Huan’s breathing was somewhat hurried as he stood there. He did not dare to directly leave like the two heaven’s pride experts from lone sect.

He could only stand there quietly with a gloomy face.

The fellow who was pestering his junior sister was beyond his imagination.

“He’s too cool, he’s Too Cool!”

He suiwen stood there and said excitedly, “That brother Wang Xian is my idol!”

“I’m just afraid that young master Tian and young master di will get the experts of the Solitaire sect to deal with brother Wang Xian!”

He Yuan asked worriedly.

“With young master Wang’s strength, unless it’s an expert at level eight of the Seethrough Void Tier, these two young masters of Heaven and Earth can’t order such an expert!”

He suiqing whispered beside he yuan.

“That’s true. With brother Wang Xian’s strength, unless it’s an expert at level eight of the Seethrough Void Tier, such an expert wouldn’t fight for the sake of two heaven’s favorites!”

He Yuan smiled.

“Little Yuan, the Crown Prince of Wuqing City is here!”

At this moment, Lin Yaoyao reminded him.

He Yuan was slightly taken aback. When he saw Wu Qing city walking towards him, he immediately went forward to welcome him.

“Forest Beast Master, I’ve long heard of your great name!”

Wu Qing City walked over. His eyes flickered as he sized up he yuan and extended his hand with a smile.

“Hello, Crown Prince of Wu Qingcheng. Compared to you, I still have a lot to learn!”

He Yuan said with a hint of respect.

Although both of them were equally famous, there was still a huge gap between their backgrounds and status.

“Haha, Young Master He is too modest. I heard that you and young master Wang Xian are very good friends...”

Wu Qingcheng smiled and chatted with he yuan.

Although Wang Xian did not give him face today and slapped him in the face, he was not too narrow-minded.

Moreover, with the two heaven’s favorites from the Solitaire sect in front of them, the two of them were the ones who lost face.

Now that they had formed a complete enmity with Wang Xian, he was happy to see that.

When he yuan saw Wu Qing Cheng asking about Wang Xian, his mind was full of thoughts. He had nothing to hide.

Other than the matter of Wang Xian being a sky demon, he told the truth about everything else.

“Miss Ling Jian ‘ER is really beautiful. No wonder young master Wang Xian was able to travel hundreds of thousands of miles to the vast region to look for you!”

Wu Qingyan and Wu Qingyan whispered to each other in a corner. They looked at Ling Jian ‘er and walked over to greet her with a smile.

“Eh? Princess Qingyan, Princess Qingyan, my name is Bing Jian ‘ER. My Name Is Not Ling Jian ‘er!”

Ling Jian ‘er looked at them and said with a slight frown.

“What? You Are Not Ling Jian ‘er? You are clearly...”

Wu Qingyan and Wu Qingyan were slightly stunned. “Is there anyone in the world who looks so similar?” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Ling Jian ‘er stood at the side with her brows tightly knitted. She thought carefully and did not recall Ling Jian ‘er, Wang Xian, or the middle-aged man who said he was her father.

But... why would it be so easy for others to say it?

“Princess Qingyan, Princess Qingyan, can you tell me about that Wang Xian?”

Ling Jian ‘er hesitated for a moment before asking.

Wu Qingyan and Wu Qingyan looked at each other and nodded.

Bing jinghuan, who was standing at the side, had a drastic change in expression when he heard their conversation.

He knew that Ling Jian ‘er was someone their ancestor met by accident. When he met her, her entire body was covered in injuries as she was fighting with others.

After he rescued her, she immediately fainted. Only the word ‘Jian ‘er’was engraved on the sword in her hand.

After she woke up, she had forgotten her own name. Her family and friends, the Patriarch had named her ‘Bing Jian ‘er’.

Could it be? Ling Jian ‘er was really the person that the evildoer youth had looked for?

This caused his expression to be extremely ugly. Ling Jian ‘er was the woman that he had decided on internally!

The banquet did not stop because of what had just happened.

However, throughout the entire banquet, everyone was talking about priest Wang. They were talking about the two heaven’s favorites from the solipsistic sect.

Some people guessed that young master Tian and young master di would definitely take revenge, and the solipsistic sect would definitely take revenge as well.

There were also people who said that priest Wang would be killed by the solipsistic sect.

So what if he was above a heaven’s pride expert?

As long as he wasn’t a peerless expert, the so-called above a heaven’s pride expert was no different from an ordinary person in front of an absolute expert.
