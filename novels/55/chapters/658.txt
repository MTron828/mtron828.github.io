Chapter 659: If You Aren’t Leaving, I’ll Bury You Here (2)

“Today, I’m announcing that this will be the territory of the Creepy Snake Group. Any martial artist from the Underworld who isn’t willing to surrender will die if you take a step in!”

Above the main peak where the spiritual energy waterfall originated, five old men stood at the tallest point while staring down at Wang Xian. Their cold voices reverberated across the entire area.

Dragon King from the Dragon Sect?

So what if he had annihilated half the Underworld?

Known throughout the Underworld?

So what? In this small Underworld, there was indeed nothing that their Creepy Snake Group had to fear.

What was there to fear about the ruler of the Underworld that was as big as a small pond?

“So there are still Budding Realm experts in this Underworld. This is really unexpected. Show us your strength. If you have the strength, you can get a mountain!”

An old man with a metal skull truncheon from Gautama denomination shouted in a low voice, “Keep your arrogance in check. Otherwise, your outcome will be catastrophic!”

“Kid, show us your strength. If you are weak, just get lost. There’s no such thing as territory of the Underworld. If my fist were larger, this would be our territory! Haha!”

An old man kept his hands behind his back while standing on a mountain peak and shouting arrogantly.

When facing the Dragon King of the Dragon Sect, not a single overseas force was afraid or willing to back off.

“Although the Dragon King and the Dragon Sect are exceptionally terrifying, it would just be their wishful thinking to demand all other forces to get lost!”

“No matter how strong the Dragon Sect might be, they would at most be at a level similar to the Creepy Snake Group. It might be possible to occupy one or two mountains. The Dragon King still doesn’t have the strength to demand all of them to get lost from this place!”

“That’s right! There’s nothing wrong with our decision. Even if the Dragon King can occupy one or two mountains, only those from the Sui Clan, Xiao Clan, and Thistles and Thorns Sect would be allowed to cultivate on these mountains. There’s no way we will get a chance!”

On various mountains, those martial artists that had joined the overseas forces looked down and commented gloomily.

They had no regrets over their decisions at all!

“Brother Wang Xian, they are too strong. Why don’t we occupy one or two mountains first?”

Looking at the terrifying old men on various mountains, they suggested solemnly.

Wang Xian shook his head, looked around him and said, “Since you guys aren’t leaving, this will be your burial site. This is a rather good resting place after all!”

Huh?

Wang Xian’s response stunned everyone around him.

“Hehe. Creepy Snake Group! Your Creepy Snake Excellency almost killed me in the past. I’m going to collect some interest today!”

“Killing is the most enjoyable thing in this world!”

At this moment, Dragon Spirit, Dragon Kid and the other dragonians that had been following Wang Xian finally stepped out.

Eerie voices came from them before they charged towards the thirteen mountains.

Mo Qinglong was equally focused as he charged towards the mountain directly ahead of him.

Rumble!

In an instant, nine Budding Realm experts released their auras explosively from their bodies. The terrifying might instantly shook the spiritual energy waterfall.

“Hehehehe! Time to kill!”

The dragonians Wang Xian had brought along this time were from the Wandering Groups of the disordered region. Every member of these Wandering Groups had a lingering pungent blood scent on them.

Brutality and massacres.

Despite becoming dragonians, their cores remained the same. Therefore, Wang Xian had brought Mo Qinglong along.

With his orders and Mo Qinglong to restrict them, these people wouldn’t commit acts that were over the top.

“What?”

The thirty-odd experts from the six forces that occupied the mountains were shocked to see these experts charging towards them with frightening auras.

“It’s you! Old Spirits! Why are you here!? Aren’t you supposed to be in the disordered region? Since when did you become the dog of someone else?”

The five old men from Creepy Snake Group growled as they saw the old dwarf approaching. Their expressions had also turned bitter and gloomy.

“I, your father, will bury you here today!”

Dragon Spirit gave a creepy smile and the dagger in his hand glowed with a faint green light. A black light shimmered in his eyes.

“You must be courting your own death to dare to attack all of us at once!”

“Kill them! These arrogant bastards are courting their own deaths!”

The experts from these six forces were furious to see Wang Xian instructing his men to attack directly.

None of them had any regard for the Underworld of China. Yet, they were belittled by Wang Xian who ordered his men to attack them recklessly.

Moreover, what surprised them was that there were nine Budding Realm experts among the experts who charged towards them.

The experts from these six forces pulled a long face and met the attacks with raging killing intent.

The battle exploded without any prior signs.

“Gulp. The Dragon King is still as domineering as before! Attacking six overseas forces at once!”

“Is this the entirety of Dragon Sect’s strength? They are too strong! They actually have nine Budding Realm experts! It’s not surprising that the Dragon Sect would be able to annihilate Nie Wushuang, Emperor Qi, and the four old men previously!”

The crowd of martial artists from the Underworld couldn’t help but gasp as they felt their hearts palpitating violently while watching.

“This... Nine Budding Realm experts! Is this the strength of the Dragon Sect? So... So strong!”

At this moment, those martial artists that had turned themselves to the overseas forces were completely shaken to their cores.

They exchanged glances and could see a bad premonition from the looks in one another’s eyes.

Nine Budding Realm experts and thirty-odd Dan Realm experts from the Dragon Sect against the fifteen Budding Realm experts and forty to fifty Dan Realm experts from the six forces.

There was a huge difference in terms of the numbers of experts between both parties. The Dragon Sect would definitely not be a match for the six overseas forces.

However, the Dragon King had not made a move.

Furthermore, the Dragon King had shown the same dominance as before.

Based on their prior experiences, they weren’t certain who would emerge victorious in the end.

“How dare you even think of taunting us with just nine Budding Realm experts! None of you shall even dream of escaping today!”

The old man from Creepy Snake Group was brimming with dense killing intent. His samurai sword was wrapped in black devilish aura and opened up a devilish mark that extended over a thousand meters.

Rumble!

An explosion reverberated across the sky and the spiritual energy waterfall as spiritual energy scattered down like rain.

Hehe!

Dragon Spirit, Dragon Kid, and other Budding Realm experts were fearless despite the other party having an overwhelming advantage in numbers.

All of them were experts that had survived a bloodbath. Now that they possessed the bloodline of the divine dragon, their strength was enhanced once again.

All of them were holding Level 12 spiritual equipment.

These were specially crafted by Wang Xian.

With the materials on hand, Wang Xian was able to refine twenty pieces of Level 12 spiritual equipment. As for Level 11 spiritual equipment, he had sufficient materials for over a hundred pieces. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Die!”

Creepy, ruthless and violent attacks were launched by the dragonians. Their strength was a lot higher than Mo Qinglong who had just reached the Budding Realm.

“Shit! Why would your attack be...?”

An old man who stood opposite the Dragon Kid was astounded. He stared at his weapons that were now covered in cracks and fear started welling up inside him.

Grrr!

Dragon Kid, who had a hideous expression, shouted loudly. The next instant, a huge devil dragon illusion appeared behind him and the hideous face on it trembled.

“The killings start now!”

Wang Xian looked at the battle in the sky and revealed a satisfied smile.

He wouldn’t have to say much to these overseas forces.

All he had to do was kill them all!
