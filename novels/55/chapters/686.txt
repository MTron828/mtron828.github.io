Lan qingyue, Sun Lingxiu, Ah Jiaya and elder fan were extremely anxious, but they had no other way.

Coming back from the dead was a very heaven-defying matter.

If Wang Xian didn’t have the ancestral tree and the two heaven-defying treasures, the soul-returning wood, coming back from the dead was simply a legend.

They could only ask Prime Minister Gui anxiously and wait.

“The soul-returning wood has already grown the soul of the Dragon King. What we need now is the dragon blood and the energy of the three Immortals!”

Prime Minister Gui’s eyes sparkled. He turned to Ao Jian and AO qitian and said, “Let’s recuperate for a while. We will go to the chaotic sea area later and hunt down the Devil Fish King!”

“Okay!”

Ao Qitian and Ao Jian nodded, and their eyes were cold. “Should we go to other unknown sea areas and kill immortal-level creatures?”

“Look again. The Dragon King’s Dragon Bone hasn’t disappeared, and the five elements origin hasn’t either. The energy of four immortal-level creatures should be about the same!”

Prime Minister Gui looked hesitant. “If it doesn’t work, we’ll take the risk and kill other immortal-level creatures!”

“Prime Minister Gui, if we have enough energy, how long will it take for my brother to be resurrected?”

Xiao Yu asked while pulling Prime Minister Gui’s arm.

“Grand Princess, if we have enough energy, it will take at most a month to be resurrected!”

Prime Minister GUI slowly stood up. “Dragon Queen, Grand Princess, I need to make some preparations first!”

“You go, Prime Minister Gui!”

Lan Qingyue and the others quickly said.

“Brother!”

Xiao Yu looked at the dragon pool and could not help but cry again.

“Xiao Yu, don’t cry. At that time, Xiao Xian had already considered that she would die and that she could be resurrected, so we don’t have to worry!”

A few girls stood by the Dragon Pool with slightly red eyes and waited quietly.

Prime Minister Gui came to the Dragon Field of the Dragon Palace and looked at the Dolphins and Tang Yinxuan who were floating in the air.

The pink light surrounded the dolphins, which was quite unbelievable.

“After the Dolphins learned how to cultivate, they seemed to have awakened a very special energy

“After the girl’s body was pierced through and her life force dissipated, she was surrounded by a sound wave

“It’s completely opposite to the effects of the soul-returning wood. The soul-returning wood absorbs and protects. This pink energy contains a powerful life force!”

“Perhaps, under the treatment of these dolphins, she can be resurrected!”

Prime Minister Gui stood there and looked, his face full of surprise.

This group of dolphins had easily jumped over the Dragon Gate and even brought Tang Yinxuan in. He was somewhat shocked.

The rest of the aquatic species that leaped over the dragon gate were all desperately charging towards the Dragon Palace.

However, they were very easy to do.

“In the future, this group of dolphins might even be a powerful subordinate of the Dragon Palace.”

Prime Minister Gui moved his body and entered the Dragon Cave to recuperate from his injuries.

“Are they dead? Should I wait for Resurrection?”

Wang Xian felt his consciousness gathering in a hazy manner. When he realized that he had appeared on the soul-returning wood on the dragon throne, he heaved a sigh of relief.

Just as he had expected, the soul-returning wood was extremely powerful.

Wang Xian had no choice but to exhaust his body and fight with the two demonic middle-aged men.

If he had not used up all his energy to launch the strongest attack and repel the two men, they would have been truly finished.

With the terrifying strength of the two demonic middle-aged men, they would definitely be annihilated in their original state.

By then, after all the experts of the Dragon Palace had died, he wouldn’t be able to resurrect even if he wanted to.

At that time, the strongest attack that he had unleashed was the best choice.

“People from the Yu Ding world, just you wait!”

Endless killing intent surged in Wang Xian’s heart. “As long as I resurrect, even if you don’t appear in the world, I will enter your world and turn the sky and earth upside down!”

“And Tang Yinxuan!”

Wang Xian was stunned. When he recalled how Tang Yinxuan used her strongest defense to block the black energy back then, the killing intent in his heart became even stronger.

If she had not reminded him back then and did not face the Black Light, he was afraid that the attack would have already killed him and Prime Minister Gui.

The consequences of his and Prime Minister Gui’s death would also mean the destruction of the Dragon Palace.

“I will avenge you!”

Wang Xian mumbled.

He looked around and could sense a radius of ten meters around him. He couldn’t sense anything further away.

“Shuqing!”

Wang Xian looked towards the dragon throne and revealed a smile.

“Eh?”

At this moment, Wang Xian revealed a surprised expression.

In his soul state, he could see Guan Shuqing’s body and her soul.

However, what surprised Wang Xian was that there were two gray dots of light in Guan Shuqing’s body.

Both dots of light were extremely dim.

“Does everyone’s soul have two dots of light? Shuqing’s vitality is already very strong, but she didn’t wake up. Could it be related to these dim dots of Light?”

“Could it be that the strength of the soul is too weak and couldn’t support this strong body, so she couldn’t wake up?”

Wang Xian was bewildered.

He didn’t expect that he would discover the reason why Shu Qing couldn’t wake up.

Time passed slowly.

The next day, Prime Minister Gui and Ao Jian and AO qitian walked out of the Dragon Palace. Half a day later, they brought over the body of the Devil Fish King.

In the Dragon Pool, after the ten-meter-long dragon bone absorbed the Dragon Cave in the Dragon Pool, flesh and blood began to grow.

“At this speed, the Dragon King’s body will be fully recovered in half a month!”

Prime Minister Gui stood beside the dragon pool and said thoughtfully.

“Is there enough energy?”

Sun Lingxiu frowned and asked Prime Minister Gui.

“I’m not sure!”

Prime Minister Gui shook his head slowly and suddenly had an idea, “Dragon Queen, I’m going to get something!”

As he spoke, he moved and arrived at a cave on the surrounding mountains. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

The jellyfish corpses that were emitting crystal light were piled inside.

They were immortal jellyfish, level-11 immortal jellyfish.

Their bodies were immortal matter, a very precious thing.

“All creatures want to evolve towards immortality, and the divine dragon will eventually go in that direction. This immortal matter is an enormous energy!”

“Back then, the Dragon King was prepared to use it to create an immortal jellyfish race, but now it seems that there’s no need!”

“The Eternal Material Dragon Pool can’t absorb it, but it can use endless wood to completely melt it!”

The Endless Wood was a different type of eternal tree. It had endless flames that would never be extinguished, and it was similar to the eternal material.

The level of the endless wood was obviously higher than the eternal jellyfish, so it should be able to melt it.

If the eternal material was used to condense the Dragon King’s body, it could make the Dragon King’s strength and recovery power a terrifying increase.
