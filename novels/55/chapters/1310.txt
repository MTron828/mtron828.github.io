Chapter 1311: 1312, the cruel main hall

“Be careful!”

After resting for two days in the demi-human graveyard, Zhang Fengying walked him to the entrance and said to him.

“Don’t worry. Information can not be spread in the main hall. I might be staying there for a period of time. Don’t worry, I will be fine!” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Wang Xian waved his hand at Zhang Fengying and flew towards the main hall.

The main hall was once the core of the blood stream sect. It was the starting point of the blood stream sect’s treasure trove, herb garden, and spirit stone lode. It was also the training ground for the sect leader and the elders.

The main hall was the only intact building in the tomb of the demi-human. It was covered by a powerful array formation.

It covered an area of about 100 kilometers. The most precious place inside was the various training rooms.

As the main hall, the cultivation rooms inside were more than ten times the size of the outside world. There were also cultivation rooms of various attributes, which corresponded to cultivation, increasing the speed of cultivation even faster.

Besides these cultivation rooms, there were also many treasures in the main hall, such as spirit grass, weapons, spirit liquid, and essence blood.

However, the Blood Stream sect’s beast garden used to be next to the medicinal garden. After the blood stream sect had an accident, these fierce beasts had rushed out.

They had swallowed a large amount of spiritual herbs and evolved. Now, these fierce beasts were the most common in the main hall.

Fierce Beasts liked to stay in places with abundant spiritual energy, which resulted in many treasure lands being occupied by fierce beasts.

And if humans and demonic beasts wanted to cultivate in the cultivation room, they had to first kill the fierce beasts.

If they wanted to obtain some treasures, they had to first subdue the fierce beasts.

However, the beasts inside were once kept by the blood stream sect, and each of them had a bloodline level that was not lower than the profound void tier.

There were even sixth level profound void tier beasts, which resulted in many sixth level profound void tier beasts in the main hall.

These beasts were inside, which resulted in even the strongest experts in the flowing sea region had to be careful when entering.

“Demon Soul, you said that the place where you obtained the five elemental spirit pearl is in a mysterious cultivation room. It contains the energy of the five elements. Are you serious?”

Wang Xian rode on the demon soul and wore a mask on his face. He headed towards the main hall as the nameless sword demon.

“My king, how could I Lie to You? Back then, my strength was only at level nine of the supernatural realm. In order to pursue a powerful strength, I entered the tomb of the demi-human and coincidentally entered a cultivation room. There was a passageway in that cultivation room. After walking for dozens of kilometers, I came to an underground space. I obtained the five elemental spirit pearl from there. Moreover, that place was enveloped by a terrifying array formation. The five elemental energy was raging inside. It was extremely terrifying and I was too weak back then. After obtaining the five elemental spirit pearl, I left immediately!”

“After that, I went into seclusion and broke through to the second level of the void interpretation stage. I never had the chance to go there again!”

The Demon Soul said respectfully to Wang Xian.

The main purpose of Wang Xian’s visit to the main hall was to listen to the Demon Soul Talk about this space a month ago.

Due to the five elemental spirit Pearl, the Demon Soul was able to reach the second level of the void interpretation stage in less than fifty years.

That space contained a majestic energy of the five elements. If what it said was true, Wang Xian’s cultivation inside was at least dozens of times that of the outside world.

“Let’s go, increase the speed!”

Wang Xian nodded silently and said to the demon soul.

“Yes, King!”

The Demon Soul’s body shook as it flew rapidly in the sky of the human-demon graveyard.

“That is... the nameless sword demon riding on the demon scale!”

“It’s him. The nameless sword demon has appeared again. where is he going?”

In the human-demon graveyard, when people saw the demon soul flying in the sky, they were all shocked.

There was only one person in the entire demi-human graveyard who was riding on a demon scale demon beast, and that person was the nameless sword demon.

After the five sword demons disappeared for a few months, they reappeared.

It was an incomparably huge building complex. Compared to The Prodigy stage and the training grounds, this was the largest and most complete building complex in the demi-human graveyard.

A building that was about two thousand meters tall and reached into the clouds stood in the center.

From Afar, one could see the words ‘main hall of the blood stream sect’. It was emitting a terrifying power.

A terrifying formation enveloped it.

Similar to other places, half of the main hall was on land and the other half was in the ocean.

“Eh? That’s the nameless sword demon!”

“The nameless sword demon is also in the main hall?”

When Wang Xian arrived at the entrance of the main hall, the five or six insightful void martial arts practitioners at the entrance looked over.

The demi-human graveyard was the center of the Flowing Sea region. There were at least a few thousand insightful emptiness realm experts active in the surroundings.

Among them, 70% of the insightful emptiness realm experts were in the main hall.

If he was lucky, he might be able to obtain the inheritance of the ancient blood stream sect.

The founders of the Blood Stream Empire and the Blood Stream sect had established their empire and sect because they obtained powerful treasures in the main hall of the blood stream sect.

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian glanced at the few people at the entrance and entered directly from the entrance.

Buzz

The moment he stepped into the main hall, Wang Xian could clearly sense that the spiritual energy was several times stronger than the outside.

The entrance was a corridor, a corridor that was only about twenty meters long.

After walking through the corridor, there were three intersections. In front of them were all kinds of buildings.

The buildings inside were slightly damaged. It was obvious that a powerful battle had occurred here.

“Can you find the entrance to that place from here?”

Wang Xian asked the demon soul.

“No, we have to head towards the Sea of demonic beasts. Once we reach the sea, I should be able to find the place!”

The Demon Soul said to Wang Xian.

“Yes, Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded his head. His eyes flashed with a demonic look as he swept his gaze forward.

“HMM?”

There were buildings and powerful formations all around him. His light-dark fire dragon eyes could not penetrate through this place at all.

“I knew it. My strength is still too weak!”

The light-dark fire dragon eyes were not omnipotent. The powerful energy could not penetrate through it at all.

“Shrink your body a little!”

Wang Xian jumped down from the demon soul and spoke to it. Then, he dashed straight ahead.

He looked around vigilantly.

He had just entered the outer area. Other than encountering two insightful void martial artists, there was no danger.

The two insightful void martial artists who met Wang Xian looked at him vigilantly and left hurriedly.

The main hall was filled with dangers. It was very common to kill and Rob people.

One couldn’t trust anyone here.

Wang Xian steered forward. The surroundings were deathly silent. Wang Xian restrained his voice and proceeded forward carefully.

“Eh? The spiritual energy over there is so abundant!”

After walking for more than ten kilometers, Wang Xian suddenly sensed an even stronger spiritual energy fluctuation from a room.

He hesitated for a moment and flew towards that direction.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

However, before he could get close, three terrifying attacks were launched at him.

Each attack was unleashed by at least a second level void interpretation expert. This caused Wang Xian’s expression to change slightly.
