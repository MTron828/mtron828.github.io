Chapter 1293: In 1294, he had six wives

“This focus of yours doesn’t look like a good person!”

When Zhang Fengying saw him sizing her up, she couldn’t help but roll her eyes at him and said unhappily.

“Hehe, what are you doing now? Why are you here?”

Wang Xian asked her.

“I’m a teacher in the Divine Wind Academy. I joined the Academy by chance not too long ago. What about you? Why did you come here from the Dragon and Phoenix Dynasty?”

Zhang Fengying asked him.

“To gain experience and improve my strength. I think I’ll be back in seven to eight months at most.”

Wang Xian said to her and hesitated for a moment. “I’ll go back then. Come with me. The tomb of the demi-human is too messy. It’s not safe!”

Zhang Fengying was stunned when she heard his words. She smoothed her long hair and her eyes sparkled. “We’ll see!”

Wang Xian shook his head and said, “It’s decided then.”

“HMPH, if I don’t go back, can you still tie me up and bring me back?”

Zhang Fengying glared at him and snorted softly.

Wang Xian smiled and started to talk about what had happened to her during this period of time.

“This?”

However, at this moment, Jiang Chuan, who was sitting beside the few princes of the Kingdom of Light Dragon, suddenly stood up. His gaze was directed at Wang Xian and Zhang Fengying as his expression kept changing.

“Eh? Brother Jiang Chuan, what’s Wrong?”

Everyone at the table looked at Jiang Chuan and asked in surprise.

Why did he suddenly lose his composure?

They followed Jiang Chuan’s line of sight and were a little surprised.

“Eh?”

When Long Xiaochen and the other princes saw Wang Xian’s figure, their eyes flickered.

They looked at Zhang Fengying who was beside Wang Xian and then at Jiang Chuan whose expression kept changing. A faint smile appeared on their faces.

“I really didn’t expect that kid to have such luck with women. That beauty is really beautiful!” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Long Xiaochen said it on purpose. However, the envy on his face was very real.

Zhang Fengying’s appearance was definitely one of the best. However, the most popular thing was her figure.

Top-notch. She was simply top-notch.

“That guy doesn’t have the right to enjoy such luck with women!”

Prince No. 16 glanced at Prince No. 36 and said faintly.

“Brother Jiang Chuan, may I know what is the relationship between that beauty and you?”

Prince No. 36 looked at Jiang Chuan with a smile and asked.

Jiang Chuan didn’t answer. His gaze was fixed on Wang Xian and Zhang Fengying.

Even though he didn’t dare to believe it himself, he had to admit that the relationship between that Guy and Zhang Fengying wasn’t ordinary. In fact, they were overly intimate.

He knew that Zhang Fengying was very cold to other men.

But now...

“Phew!”

He took a deep breath and finished the wine in his glass. Then, he looked at the few princes of the Light Dragon Dynasty.

“Help me humiliate that kid. Leave the rest to me!”

He looked at Long Xiaochen and the others with a gloomy face.

“Huh? Haha, Good, good. Brother Jiang Chuan, don’t worry. A Kid from a small country, even if he has some ability, is not qualified to snatch a beauty from you!”

Long Xiaochen and the others burst into laughter. They looked at each other and said, “Leave this matter to us!”

“What do you guys do?”

Jiang Chuan narrowed his eyes slightly and asked coldly.

The few of them fell silent and looked pensive.

“The simplest way is undoubtedly to tarnish his reputation. However, after today, I hope brother Jiang Chuan can give it a try!”

The eyes of the forty-second prince flickered as he looked at the group of women on the table beside them.

“Don’t worry about that. I Won’t be a dilettante!”

Jiang Chuan said coldly.

“That’s Good!”

The 42nd Prince stood up and walked to the side with a smile on his face.

When the group of women on the table saw him walking over, two of them immediately stood up.

“Vixen? Cherry Blossom Mercenary Group?”

Seeing the 42nd Prince Walk over, the rest of them revealed a trace of contemplation, followed by a trace of a smile on their faces.

“Done!”

Soon, the 42nd Prince came back with a big smile on his face. He looked at them and said, “If Princess Tang Ling finds out about this, we’ll have to compensate her!”

“As expected of a prince. He’s really resourceful!”

Jiang Chuan said with a faint smile.

“Hehe, we’re taking a big risk. We can’t be ordered by brother Jiang Chuan to do such a thing, right?”

The 42nd Prince smiled and said nonchalantly.

“Fengying, come here. Let us introduce you to a few Sisters!”

After Wang Xian and Zhang Fengying had talked for more than ten minutes, the girl called Xiao Ya shouted at her.

“Alright, I’ll be leaving for a while!”

Zhang Fengying waved at Xiao Ya and said to Wang Xian helplessly.

“Okay!”

Wang Xian nodded and said with a smile.

Zhang Fengying walked towards Xiao Ya. There were at least five to six thousand people around her.

Fortunately, the island was very large and didn’t seem crowded at all.

Among them, the disciples of the various major forces and the experts representing the insightful emptiness realm were gathered together. Some of them were conversing while others were greeting each other.

“This is young master Wang Xian!”

Just as Wang Xian was about to return to long Xiaotian’s place, a gentle and charming voice suddenly came from the side.

Wang Xian was stunned for a moment. He looked at a lady who was walking towards him with a surprised expression.

The Lady was dressed in a slightly revealing manner. She perfectly displayed her impressive body. Her looks were not bad and she was considered a beauty.

“You are?”

Wang Xian looked at her with a puzzled expression.

“I’m a Vixen, Mei'er!”

The woman walked to Wang Xian’s side with a smile on her face. Her body was soft as she leaned over with a strange Hong Juan in her hand.

“You must have mistaken me for someone else, right?”

Wang Xian frowned as he looked at her. There was a hint of impatience in his eyes.

“You don’t recognize me just like that? You are really heartless. Didn’t you say that you would marry me in the future? Didn’t you say that when the second Prince ascends the throne, you would give me a bright future? Why are you like this now? SOB SOB!”

As the woman spoke, she gently placed Hong Juan on Wang Xian’s body and started to cry.

Tears fell from her eyes. She looked extremely miserable, just like a woman who had been abandoned.

“The second Prince?”

When Wang Xian heard these three words, he raised his eyebrows and scanned his surroundings.

When he saw more than ten people looking in his direction, he understood a little.

“Get lost! Don’t court death!”

Wang Xian waved his arm and shook it gently. Hong Juan landed directly on her body. A trace of aura shook her.

“Aiya, sob sob sob sob. I didn’t expect you to be such a person. You promised to give me happiness. Now that you want my body, you actually pretended not to know me. You Heartless Man!”

Under Wang Xian’s aura, the woman fell to the side. She cried miserably and shouted at Wang Xian loudly.

“Eh? What’s going on?”

“What’s going on?”

The surroundings were crowded with people. When they saw the woman who suddenly fell, they were stunned.
