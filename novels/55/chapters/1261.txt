Translator: 5496903

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

“Run, everyone, run!”

“Oh my God, this demon Lin King Beast is a terrifying existence at profound void Tier 2, everyone, run!”

“Don’t block the way, get out of my way, get out of my way!”

The sound of the array exploding rang out, along with chaotic and terrified cries.

The second-level void interpretation formation, at the cost of being damaged, launched its final attack at the demon soul of the second-level void interpretation.

“Roar, damn it, damn the formation!”

The Demon Soul saw the last hundreds of thousands of black longswords attacking it by self-destructing, and it immediately stopped moving.

The killing formation of the second-level void interpretation was, after all, the killing formation of the second-level void interpretation.

Even a Demon Beast of the second rank of the insightful void tier could not completely ignore it.

Its body shook, and flame scales rose up one after another, forming a defense around it without any blind spots.

Countless black swords fell on it, but they could not cause any damage to it.

And in these few short seconds, they fought for a chance of survival for all the humans.

Everyone rushed towards the exit frantically!

“Get out of the way! Get out of the way!”

Wang Xian stood in the void and looked at the demon soul with a little surprise. It was the king beast of the current generation of the Demon Beast Race.

However, at this moment, a young man who was rushing over in fear pulled out his weapon and attacked Wang Xian directly.

He wanted to escape for his life and escape as soon as possible.

Wang Xian frowned slightly when he saw the weapon that was charging at him. His eyes were cold.

He moved his body and dodged to the side.

“Roar!”

“Ahhhh!”

At this moment, a roar was heard. A terrifying flame attacked the humans at the back.

A scream was heard instantly. Wang Xian looked over.

The formation had already dissipated. The Furious Demon Soul released a terrifying flame.

Hundreds of people were instantly incinerated by the flames.

The screams made the humans who were running away even more terrified. Wang Xian saw them pick up their weapons and attack the people who were blocking their way.

“Scram! All of you, F * CKING SCRAM! Who told you to follow us!”

Tang Feng and Tang Yuan’s foreheads were covered in cold sweat as they shouted loudly towards the front.

They charged towards the people blocking their way without any scruples and towards the exit.

With their strength, the people around them could not withstand it at all.

Wang Xian looked over. In just a few seconds, there were over a thousand people who died at the hands of their own kind.

He shook his head slowly and looked towards the demon soul that was engulfed in flames.

Demon Soul was the name of this demonic Lin Demon Beast.

Just like humans, they had their own name and civilization.

The people around them fled at a very fast speed. Tens of thousands of people swarmed into the exit.

Fortunately, the exit was relatively spacious and could accommodate six to eight hundred people.

“Damn it, damn it, don’t run away!”

When the demonic soul saw that almost all the humans had fled, he revealed a furious expression.

A huge flame was spewed towards the exit.

Seeing the last few thousand people, Wang Xian frowned slightly. With a move of his arm, a mask appeared on his face.

He didn’t want to expose himself. The intelligence of the Demon Beast race was not inferior to that of humans. If he were to expose himself, it was very likely that he would attract the attacks of the Demon Beast Race.

He wouldn’t reveal his true appearance easily unless he had absolute strength.

He waved his arm and a black ray of light swept over under the heaven-defying Pearl to block the attack of the demon soul.

“HMM? There’s still an ant left. Roar, die!”

The demon soul stared at Wang Xian with his cold eyes. With a slight movement of his tail, a fire whip swept towards Wang Xian.

The blazing fire whip caused the air to be filled with a layer of mist.

Wang Xian smiled lightly and a cold expression appeared in his eyes. He waved his arm and unleashed the extreme ice and fire explosion.

Boom

The extreme ice and fire explosion landed on the fire whip. The fire whip collapsed instantly and the energy from the extreme ice and fire explosion continued to attack forward.

“Eh? What? Another insightful void martial artist?”

Demon Soul’s expression changed slightly as he clawed at the extreme ice and fire explosion.

Boom

Sensing the energy from above, his expression changed slightly as he revealed a serious expression.

“Roar roar, cunning humans. I didn’t expect two of you to descend!”

The Demon Soul’s eyes were filled with killing intent as he stared at Wang Xian.

“Hehe, if you are willing to be my mount, I can spare your life!”

When Wang Xian saw that the demon soul treated him as a human who had entered this place through a special method, a faint smile appeared on his face. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

His body moved and he floated in the air. He sized up the demon soul with a smile on his face.

Now that his strength had increased, Ling Zilin was no longer qualified to be his mount.

This demon soul looked extremely domineering, and it had a sixth level void interpretation bloodline. If it was to be his mount, it would be a good choice.

“Keke, arrogant human, let me be your mount. You are delusional, become my food!”

A hint of anger flashed across his eyes. He opened his mouth and a terrifying flame shot towards the sky.

Flames descended from the sky like meteorites and smashed towards Wang Xian.

The terrifying attack covered an area of two kilometers.

“The King of Heaven’s favorites from the Demonic Beasts? Hehe, since that’s the case, let’s have a taste of it!”

A faint smile appeared on Wang Xian’s face as the three spirits armor appeared around him.

With a move of his palm, the black demon-free sword appeared in his hand.

The King of Heaven’s favorites from the human race, the head of Heaven’s favorites, versus the King of Heaven’s favorites from the demon race!

However, none of the humans saw this scene.

At this moment, when all the humans rushed out of the training grounds, everyone had a look of survival on their faces.

“Hu hu, I came out alive, I Came Out Alive!”

“It’s too terrifying, the Demon Race’s genius King Beast is too terrifying. Oh My God, a terrifying existence at the second level of the void interpretation realm, Tang Lingwen was easily killed. The killing formation at the second level of the void interpretation realm has no effect on him, it’s too terrifying!”

“Ah Ah Ah, our second brother didn’t come out from inside, second brother, second brother!”

The tens of thousands of people who had just rushed out roared loudly.

What had happened just now was like hell.

They were filled with strong confidence, wanting to watch the people of the Blood Flow Empire Kill that damned beast.

In the end, no one had expected that beast to actually possess the terrifying strength of a second level void interpretation realm expert.

Even the void interpretation realm expert who had paid a huge price to use the descending technique to enter the training ground had been easily killed.

“What’s going on?”

“What happened?”

Those who did not follow them outside looked at the people who had rushed out in shock.

“A level two insightful emptiness realm demonic beast, a genius King Beast of the Demonic Beast clan. It is a level two insightful emptiness realm existence. It easily killed senior Tang Lingwen and killed more than a thousand of us with a single flame!”

A young man said loudly.

Everyone’s bodies trembled, and their faces were filled with shock.
