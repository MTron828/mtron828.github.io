Chapter 569: Demon-like Master (1)

Thirty-thousand Spiritual Stones for just any business that dropped by. If the shop had such good businesses in the future, he could earn even more Spiritual Stones.

Perhaps a hundred thousand a day?

In that way, upgrading the Dragon Palace would be a piece of cake, not to mention enhancing his own strength.

A tinge of excitement flashed in Wang Xian’s eyes as he stared at the girl in front of him with a beaming face.

“Thirty thousand Spiritual Stones?”

The girl paused as thirty thousand was a hefty amount. However, she was determined to get the six miniature Bo Yu swords.

“What is it? Can’t you afford it?” Wang Xian frowned slightly and asked her.

“This is way too expensive. Thirty thousand Spiritual Stones! Who could take them out in one shot. Besides, the material you used for making these miniatures swords were from Sister Xue. You’re way too cunning. At most, we’ll offer ten thousand Spiritual Stones!”

Upon hearing the price that Wang Xian quoted, the young girl immediately resented him.

Taking out thirty thousand Spiritual Stones in one shot was really difficult for them.

After all, they were consumables, which most people used to buy weapons and elixir pills for enhancing their strength.

“There’s another way. You can use materials that are equivalent in value to exchange for it. Regardless of whether they’re refining materials or Spiritual Grass, they are fine!”

Wang Xian proposed this to them.

Exchanging it with materials would be better. Compared to giving him the Spiritual Stones, Wang Xian was more inclined to receive materials.

“Give me some preparation time!” said the girl as she nodded slightly toward Wang Xian.

“Sure!”

Wang Xian nodded. With a swing, he took the six miniatures Bo Yu swords back and stretched out his arm. “Pay me the Spiritual Stones for the restoration of the Bo Yu sword first!”

The girl was slightly taken aback while the other young girl was staring at Wang Xian with a startled look.

Phew!

The girl took a deep breath as she handed Wang Xian the Spiritual Stones which she had been prepared for. She looked at him and said, “I’m Piao Lingxue. You can be assured that I won’t owe you any money.”

“I’m running a small business, no credit allowed!” said Wang Xian with a smile.

As Wang Xian received the Spiritual Stones, he was surprised to hear her name.

Piao Lingxue, the number two on the young supreme talents ranking of Da Hong Immortal Sect. Her strength had reached the Budding Realm.

Yet, this lady looked to be at most thirty years old. She looked like one favored by the gods.

“Hey, you, Sister Xue already said she won’t owe you any Spiritual Stones. She means it. What’s wrong with you?” The young girl pointed at Wang Xian with discontent and said, “Isn’t the name of my sister worth thirty thousand Spiritual Stones?”

Wang Xian chuckled. “My business is not good. So I don’t take credit!”

“How can the business of a blacksmith master be bad?” Piao Lingxue commented with indignation. She, Piao Lingxue, was one of the top-notch talented girls in Yong Chang world.

In other places, the name ‘Piao Lingxue’ could be worth over ten thousand Spiritual Stones or even more than that if she ever wanted to take on credit.

Yet, this young man totally disregarded it.

“It’s bad. You guys can see it with your own eyes. As such, come and collect your six miniature swords whenever you have the Spiritual Stones!”

Wang Xian shook his head at her.

“Then,” the young girl rolled her eyes and said, “if we refer some business to you, can we get a discount on the Spiritual Stones?”

“Oh? Refer some business?”

Wang Xian was taken by surprise. He immediately replied, “Sure, if the business value is relatively high, I can give you a discount of thousands or up to ten thousand Spiritual Stones!”

“Great, I have your word on it!”

The young girl squinted her eyes, revealing a lovely dimple. She tugged Piao Lingxue by the arm.

“Don’t you eavesdrop. We’ll go down now!”

The young girl pointed at Wang Xian and grabbed Piao Lingxue’s arm. She whispered, “Sister Xue, we can refer disciples in our mountain sect to him since this cheapskate fellow is a blacksmith master. It’s not easy to find one. Besides, this silly fellow doesn’t have any business. If we bring out his reputation, the girls in the sects will readily agree to it. They are probably wishing for this!”

Upon hearing how the young girl addressed Wang Xian, Piao Lingxue smiled with flickering radiance in her eyes. “Indeed. Average disciples are not qualified to get a blacksmith master to forge their Spiritual Weapons!”

There was a cunning look in Piao Lingxue’s eyes. She did not know why this blacksmith master was in such a miserable state, but this was beneficial to her.

“Master!” Piao Lingxue called out to the second floor as she craned her head.

“What is it?”

Wang Xian walked down from the second floor and looked at them.

“I’ll go back to gather the Spiritual Stones, and refer you some customers. What is your closing time?” asked Piao Lingxue to Wang Xian.

“I’ll always be here,” said Wang Xian to the two girls.

“Great, we’ll be right back!”

Piao Lingxue nodded as she headed outside with the young girl.

“Refer me more customers for refining elixir pills too. I’ll give you more of a discount!”

Wang Xian’s voice came from behind.

Piao Lingxue paused for a while with a cold face.

To think that she was the most talented girl of Mt Xue Immortal Sect. Now she became someone who needed to rely on such a method for some Spiritual Stones discount?

Her face was blushing slightly as she felt embarrassed.

“You said it. Wait for us!”

The young girl, on the other hand, was very excited. “Sister Xue, let’s gather all the disciples who need to forge their weapons and refine elixir pills. And then... hiak hiak, let’s just take the six miniature swords for free!” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

The young girl clenched her fists with an excited look. She spoke with a resolution. “I want this cheapskate fellow to vomit blood!”

“Customers for elixir pills? Don’t tell me this guy knows alchemy too? Could he be an alchemist master? No, that couldn’t be possible!”

After Piao Lingxue calmed down, she recalled what Wang Xian had said. Unlike the young girl, she was not silly or naive.

However, it was hard for her to believe that he was a master of alchemy too.

To become a blacksmith master for a guy in his twenties was already sick enough. How could he be an alchemy master too?

“Forget it, we’ll find out in due time!”

Piao Lingxue’s eyes gleamed as she looked at her Bo Yu in her hand. She was in a chirpy mood as she headed to Mt Xue with the young girl on their swords.

Mt Xue, the mountain sect in second placing among Da Hong Immortal Sect, was a unique sect as all their disciples were female.

Mt Xue never took in male disciples.

As the number-two mountain sect among Da Hong Immortal Sects, the disciples were incomparable with those from Mt Fengyu.

There were over two hundred female disciples.

No one dared to provoke any girls from Mt Xue in the entire Da Hong Immortal Sects or even in the Yong Chang world.

Not only because the leader, Piao Lingxue was strong, but also because they had many admirers.

Mt Xue was four or five times larger than Mt Fengyu. In the evening, the entire Mt Xue was unusually lively.

Disciples of other mountain sects such as Immortal Slaying Sect and Yong Chang Immortal Sect were all present.
