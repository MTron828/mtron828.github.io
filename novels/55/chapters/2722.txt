“All god Emperor Disciples of the world margin sect gather!”

“All god Emperor and above disciples of the world margin sect gather in the main hall!”

On the planet where the world margin sect was located, an order gathered all undying god Emperor and above disciples.

“What happened?”

When all the disciples gathered in the main hall, everyone looked around in shock.

“We will wait. Next, we will announce something that will affect the fate of the entire world margin great sect. It will affect everyone’s lives.”

In front of them, sect master Tian Ya stood there with a gloomy face and shouted at everyone.

“It’s sect master!”

Everyone trembled slightly and a solemn expression appeared on their faces.

At the very front stood four figures. The sect master and three elders. This caused some experts to be slightly puzzled. Where were the other four elders?

The entire great hall was silent, and a stifling atmosphere lingered.

No one dared to speak.

“Sovereign Protector.” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

At this moment, on the largest planet in the center of the Imperial Court’s Frontlines, a towering palace was suspended in mid-air. The two forefathers of the world’s end great sect were standing in a study room in the Great Hall, suppressing the anger in his heart, he cupped his hands towards an old man in front of him.

The old man was dressed in gold, looking at him gave off a luxurious feeling.

High and mighty.

“Brother Feng Yazi, brother Wu Lin Gao, I wonder why the two of you are so anxious to come here?”

The old man was a guardian level figure of the imperial court, he asked the two politely.

“Guardian Di, during this period of time, the Warriors of the Dragon Palace have assassinated over 16,000 undying god King Disciples of our world margin sect. Four elders have fallen, please help us fight for Justice.”

World Margin Patriarch Feng Yaazi bent down, his arms trembling as he growled.

“HM? The Dragon Palace assassinated more than 10,000 of your undying god King Disciples? Do you have proof?”

Protector di was slightly stunned as he asked them.

“Yes, protector di. One of our deacons obtained a treasure and escaped before he died. A few hours ago, more than 10,000 of our disciples were killed. We have to take revenge. Please help us.”

Wu Lingao gritted his teeth and said.

“Is there any other evidence?”

Protector emperor frowned slightly and continued to ask.

“No other evidence, but we are 100% sure that it was done by the Dragon Palace.”

Feng Yazi said with a red face.

“The imperial court has a rule. During the war, no forces are allowed to kill each other, and no humans are allowed to kill each other. Those who violate the rule will be killed by the imperial court!”

“If you have clear evidence, I can send the emperor to punish and even destroy the Dragon Palace, however without clear evidence, it’s hard to do so.”

The Emperor said indifferently.

“Emperor, don’t tell me the disciples of the world margin sect died for nothing?”

Feng Yaazi’s breathing was hurried.

“I can’t do anything about that. During the war, to destroy the Dragon Palace, they would have to send at least seven or eight pinnacle undying emperors, and you don’t have any evidence.”

Protector emperor shook his head.

“Since you can’t do anything, then even if we fight to the death, we will make the Dragon Palace pay a heavy price.”

Wu Lingao roared crazily.

“Brother Fengyazi, brother Wu Lingao, calm down!”

Protector emperor frowned slightly and said when he saw his condition.

“Protector Emperor, if this continues, all the powerful disciples of the world margin sect will be assassinated. Rather than slowly walking toward the end, it’s better to fight to the death with them.”

Fengyazi said with a miserable tone.

“Brother Feng Yazi, if you fight with the Dragon Palace at this time, the imperial court will punish you. At that time, I won’t be able to protect you.”

Protector Emperor said faintly.

“We know this. As long as there’s no evidence to prove it, it’ll be fine.”

Wu Lingao said in a low voice with a sinister expression.

His words caused protector emperor to be slightly silent. Following that, he said faintly, “Yes, without evidence, the imperial court will not act.”

“Brother Feng Yazi, brother Wu Lingao, the Divine Empire of the Cold Night Island is about to open. Why Don’t you endure it? If you can make a breakthrough inside, the imperial court will not stop you even if you want to destroy the Dragon Palace.”

Guardian emperor looked at them and continued.

“The chances of US making a breakthrough to the Divine Empire of the cold night emperor are too slim. We don’t want to be passive and sullen all the time. People of the ends of the Earth would rather die than submit.”

Feng Yazi said coldly.

“Sigh.”

“If it were any other time, I would be able to help you a little. But now, I can’t Help You.”

The Guardian Emperor said faintly.

...

“We appreciate your kindness, guardian emperor. Farewell.”

Feng Yazi and Wu Lingao cupped their hands and flew out.

“Buzz!”

“All the disciples of the world margin sect get ready. Next, we will have a good fight with the Dragon Palace. We will fight to the death!”

Soon, a voice full of killing intent was heard in the hall where all the disciples of the world margin sect were gathered.

All the disciples shivered slightly.

“We will obey the Patriarch’s order!”

The sect master of the world margin sect and the three elders immediately responded.

“The more than six thousand disciples of the world margin sect who disappeared during this period of time were assassinated by the Dragon Palace in a despicable way by the four elders and ten thousand disciples a few hours ago!”

“If you want to Kill Us, you have to pay the price in blood. Even if you have to die, we have to make the Dragon Palace suffer!”

Sect Master Tian Ya swept his eyes over all the disciples and roared coldly.

...

“What? !”

“The four elders were killed. This...”

“Blood must be repaid in blood. They want to kill us all. We will fight them to the death. At most, we will die!”

The disciples of the World Margin Sect were furious and roared with murderous intent.

They were all loyal disciples of the world margin sect. If someone bullied them, they would kill him one by one.

“The imperial court forbids fighting on the surface. The Dragon Palace secretly assassinates our people. Then, we will return the favor with a tooth for a tooth and a blood for a blood. All the disciples of the Dragon Palace who are related to the Dragon Palace will be our targets for revenge.”

Feng Yaazi, the Patriarch of the world’s end, said coldly.

“All the disciples should be ready. It’s time to return the favor with blood. During this period, no disciple is allowed to leave the planet.”

Wu Lingao, another patriarch, said coldly.

“It’s the Patriarch!”

The disciples of the world’s end sect immediately responded.

They were all full of murderous intent.

“Let’s go and make a plan!”

Feng Yazi said to the sect master of the world margin sect and the three elders.

“It’s the Patriarch!”

The four of them immediately followed him and walked toward the back of the hall.

“Find a target first and tell the Dragon Palace and the Dragon King that we, the world margin sect, are not easy to bully.”

Wu Lingao, the Patriarch of the world margin sect, sat on a chair and said in a deep voice with a face full of killing intent.
