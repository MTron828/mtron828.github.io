Chapter 1363: On the besieged city of the 1363 Three Kingdoms

“All Warriors, Get Ready!”

“All families and experts of the dragon-phoenix Empire, come to the east gate. Do not disobey!”

“Dong Dong Dong!”

In the morning of the next day, only eight hours had passed, and an urgent voice resounded throughout the entire dragon-phoenix Imperial City.

The alert voice that could not be decided immediately shook everyone’s hearts.

Urgent and nervous!

“Are the enemies invading? So fast, they’ve come in just a few hours this time!”

“Kill, anyone who dares to invade our Dragon-phoenix dynasty, kill them all!”

“Kill them all. With Lord Wang and Her Majesty here, there’s no regret in dying in battle!”

“In just over a year, the Queen has let us live a peaceful and happy life. Anyone who dares to invade us, kill them all!”

“Are there really three or four dynasties coming to attack us? It Can’t be true, right?”

The entire dragon and Phoenix dynasty was in an uproar. Everyone had different expressions as they walked towards the East Gate’s city wall.

Some people were furious and looked like they were ready to face death.

Some people were terrified and their eyes were flickering as they looked around.

“Your Majesty, the enemy is already 20 kilometers away from us. They are expected to arrive in five minutes!”

On the city wall of the East Gate, a general came forward to report respectfully. He looked ahead worriedly.

“Alright, get all the soldiers ready!”

Feng Luan nodded her head faintly and looked at Wang Xian who was beside her.

Wang Xian nodded his head at Feng Luan and looked ahead with a smile.

“Your Majesty, our West, south, and north gates are sealed by a powerful formation. We Can’t get out at all!”

“Your Majesty, there are at least 400,000 soldiers from the east rushing towards us!”

In less than two minutes, a general and a scout flew over with an awkward expression and reported again.

“Continue to monitor!”

Feng Luan nodded her head faintly and looked at Wang Xian. “I am now at level three of the void interpretation stage. I can fight against level four of the Void Interpretation Stage!”

“The enemies who came this time are personally led by the King of the Star Moon Empire. The other two empires, the Wind Howl Empire, have sent an expert at level four of the void interpretation stage. The other empire, the Southcloud Empire, is personally led by the king of level four of the Void Interpretation Stage!” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“There are three people at level four of the void interpretation stage. Apart from that, we also have to guard against the Dongyuan Empire. The Dongyuan Empire is even more powerful!”

She pursed her lips as she spoke and reminded Wang Xian.

“A bunch of scum. There’s no need for me to make a move at all!”

Wang Xian looked at Feng Luan, who still looked a little worried, and said with a smile.

“You are really annoying. If you have any strength, just bring it out directly. And you’re still trying to hide it!”

Feng Luan glared at him when she saw his pretentious manner.

“Haha!”

Wang Xian laughed out loud!

“Hahahaha, Dragon and Phoenix Empire, your doomsday has arrived. Surrender obediently and we will leave you with a complete corpse!”

At this moment, a carefree and even louder maniacal laughter came from the east.

The voice was extremely loud and could be heard clearly within a radius of tens of kilometers.

“All soldiers, get ready for battle!”

Mang Hong looked at the Black Mass of people flying in front of him. His pupils constricted slightly as he roared.

“Yes!”

All the soldiers held their weapons tightly as they stared ahead with determination.

“Heavens, there are so many people. Look at that flag. Three dynasties. Three dynasties are attacking us!”

“The flag of the Star Moon dynasty, the flag of the Howling Wind dynasty, and the flag of the Southern Cloud dynasty. There are at least 300,000 to 400,000 soldiers!”

“Look at the experts flying in the sky, those insightful emptiness realm experts in a row!”

The maniacal laughter attracted the attention of everyone from the dragon-phoenix dynasty. When they looked to the east, a powerful battle team appeared in their line of sight.

Among the Black Mass of people, the most eye-catching ones were the more than forty void interpretation experts floating in the sky.

Some rode on void interpretation level mounts, while others stood on large swords.

Each and every one of them exuded a terrifying might.

Even from afar, they felt their hearts palpitate.

“More than forty void interpretation experts, how are we going to fight them?”

“Heavens, that old man in the middle is the king of the Star Moon Empire, this...”

Some of the citizens of the dragon-phoenix Imperial City looked at the three empires that were slowly flying over with fear.

Any one of these three empires would have a power that was even stronger than the dragon-phoenix Empire. Now, the three of them were working together!

How could they fight?

In particular, in order to prevent the people from the dragon and Phoenix Empire from abandoning the city and escaping, except for the East Gate, the three empires had secretly set up powerful formations to seal them off.

There was no way to retreat!

“Fearless, get ready for battle!”

Feng Luan sensed the panic in her surroundings. She stared at the front with her cold eyes and shouted softly.

Her voice entered the minds of the millions of people at the East Gate of the Dragon and Phoenix Royal City!

“With the queen and I around, there’s no need to fear!”

Wang Xian also shouted softly.

“No need to fear, Fight!”

The group of generals floated above the city wall and shouted loudly.

“No need to fear, Fight!”

“Fight!”

“Fight!”

“With the Queen and Sir Wang around, we must defend our country even if we have to die. Fight!”

“Without Sir Wang, the two million of us would have died long ago. What’s there to be afraid of? Our lives were given by Sir Wang and our survival was given by Her Majesty the Queen. What’s there to be afraid of? Kill!”

“That’s right. If it wasn’t for Her Majesty the Queen taking us in, we would have died outside a long time ago. It wasn’t easy for us to find a safe place to live. We will fight for the Queen!”

As Feng Luan and Wang Xian shouted softly, the frightened citizens at the back held their weapons tightly with flushed faces and shouted loudly.

“Haha, Fight? With Your Tiny Dragon and Phoenix Empire!”

A disdainful voice came from the center of the troops at the front.

In the east, the armies of the three empires slowly stopped about two kilometers in front of them.

They stopped there quietly. There was no sound at all, but they gave off a strong pressure.

The powerful battle teams of the empires and the powerful cavalry warriors.

Two old men in yellow robes and an old man in a python robe stood at the center. Each of their faces was filled with dignity.

The Star Moon King on the left was riding a golden lion. His eyes were cold as he stared at the Majestic dragon-phoenix Imperial City.

“Dragon-phoenix Queen, you have occupied the territory of my star Moon Dynasty and established your country. You have killed the experts of my star Moon dynasty. Today, I will raze this place to the ground!”

A voice filled with killing intent resounded throughout the sky.

“I heard that the traitor of our Wind Howl dynasty, the Heaven’s Eye Demon Beast Clan, has a close relationship with you. Call them over, and we will exterminate them!”

On the right, the king of the Wind Howl dynasty stood on a large green bird, and his faint voice sounded in the sky.

“We don’t have any enmity with your dragon and Phoenix dynasty, but since our allies invited us, we can only come over and help exterminate you, Haha!”

The king of the Southern Cloud Dynasty, who was in the middle, laughed loudly. He did not put the dragon and Phoenix dynasty in his eyes at all!
