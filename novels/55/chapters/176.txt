Chapter 177: The Impact from Level 4 Spiritual Medicine

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

“How arrogant. Five Level 3 Spiritual Medicines are more than enough to exchange these Blood Corals. This young man actually said it’s for rearing bees? Ignorant people aren’t afraid of anything.”

“How dare he say he’d use Level 3 Spiritual Medicines of Liu Family to rear bees. Those were the flower petals from the Level 4 Ethereal Flower. Each of them is equivalent to Level 3 Spiritual Medicine, and they are priceless!”

“I guess he didn’t know the value of Level 3 Spiritual Medicines. He was lucky to have gotten those Blood Corals.”

All the Martial Artists families and sects were dumbfounded when they heard Wang Xian. Subsequently, they commented sarcastically.

Not only Level 3 Spiritual Medicines, but even Level 1 ones were also precious. Only the First-class forces could lay their hands on Level 3 Spiritual Medicines.

Liu Family could become the First-class Force because they had two stalks of Level 4 Ethereal Flowers. Hence, they had consistent supplies of Ethereal Flowers’ petals. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

In fact, every level of Spiritual Medicine marked a difference. Some of the Spiritual Medicine Trees could bear a lot of Spiritual Medicines. Hence, the value would be higher.

Ethereal Flower Petals were considered to be low in value among the Level 3 Spiritual Medicines. But it was not easy to obtain either.

Now, Wang Xian actually commented on using them for rearing bees. Thus, everyone felt he was too arrogant.

“Are the Level 3 Spiritual Medicines formidable?”

Wang Xian chuckled softly as he looked at Liu Fei Yun. Then he turned to Lan Qingyue and picked up the Blood Corals. “We’ll deal according to the price you said!”

Lan Qingyue stared at Wang Xian with gleaming eyes. She stood up slowly, nodded, and walked over.

“I’ll transfer the money immediately to you.” Lan Qingyue took over four Blood Corals with surprise flashing across her eyes.

“Mm!” Wang Xian nodded and did not utter another word.

“Lad, aren’t you talking big? It’s better to stay low profile. The value of Level 3 Spiritual Medicine is not something you can spout nonsense about.”

When Lan Qingyue took over the Blood Corals from Wang Xian, Liu Fei Yun clenched his fist with a dreadful expression.

“You are the arrogant one!”

Wang Xian glared at Liu Fei Yun with a disdainful look. He then took out a yellow fruit from his pocket slowly.

“Let’s carry on with the auction. Spiritual Bead, a Level 4 Spiritual Medicine, Spiritual Bead Fruit!”

“What?!”

When Wang Xian took out the Spiritual Bead Fruit from his pocket, a faint, refreshing aroma drifted into the air.

Boom!

At this moment, people from dozens of tables stood up in the auction hall as they stared at the fruit in Wang Xian’s hand with fire in their eyes.

“The fruit bore by Spiritual Bead! It’s 2,000 years old...Level 4 Spiritual Fruit!”

“This can give you an additional 10% chance to attain Half-step to Inborn for Level-nine Martial Artists. This thing is a must-have. We need to get it.”

“The fruit from Level 4 Spiritual Bead. This is even more valuable than the petals of Ethereal Flower. Gosh, how did this young man get Level 4 Spiritual Fruit?”

All the Martial Artists from the families and sects stared hard at the Level 4 fruit with burning eyes. They almost went short of breath.

Level 4 Spiritual Fruit was extremely beneficial to a family or a sect.

If any of the Level 9 experts from the clans or families could achieve Half-step to Inborn Realm with this fruit, their family or sects would attain huge improvements.

In particular, those Third-class Forces could upgrade their strength by a class with a Half-step to Inborn expert. And the fruit could give birth to one Half-step to Inborn expert.

“In history, Level 4 Spiritual Fruit has only appeared thrice in Nine Stars Auction House. It’s totally unexpected to encounter one over here.”

An elderly Level-nine Martial Artist was exhilarated as he stood up, staring at the Spiritual Fruit.

“No wonder he said Liu Family’s Level 3 Spiritual Medicine was trash. He’s got a better one, and he actually took it out to trade!”

“Damm, compared to the Level 4 Spiritual Fruit, Liu Family’s Level 3 Ethereal Flower Petals are indeed trash!”

“Young lad, what do you want to trade this Spiritual Fruit for?” an old man from the Demon Subduing Sect asked Wang Xian with a pair of eager eyes.

“Spiritual Stones. I only want to trade for Spiritual Stones through bids!” Wang Xian said immediately. Initially, he had wanted to trade for money. But the corals fetched a price that was beyond his expectations. Besides, the Spiritual Stones appeared.

As he spoke, he turned to look at Maniac Ji at the back.

Just then, Maniac Ji lifted his head and revealed half of his head, looking at the Level 4 Spiritual Fruit in Wang Xian’s hand.

“Spiritual Stone!”

After Wang Xian revealed his trading requirement, everyone had a complicated look.

Spiritual Stones were valuable, and not any ordinary families or sects could possess them.

Besides, they did not have a large number even if they owned some.

Without seventy or eighty Spiritual Stones, it was impossible to win the auction.

At Table 8, Liu Fei Yun continued to have a mixed expression on his face. He fixed his gaze on the Spiritual Fruit in Wang Xian’s hand and gritted his teeth.

He did not expect this fellow to have a Level 4 Spiritual Fruit.

Recalling what had happened just now when he asked Wang Xian if he knew the value of the Level 3 Spiritual Medicine...it was another slap in the face.

And this was not the first time today.

“Young Master Liu, Level 4 Spiritual Fruit! We must fight for it. We must win it!”

Just then, the middle-aged man beside Liu Fei Yun exclaimed excitedly, “If we can win this Spiritual Fruit, our Head of Family will be pleased.”

The voice of his middle-aged steward darkened Liu Fei Yun’s expression even more.

He took a deep breath and nodded with a dreadful look.

Upon seeing Wang Xian stir up a commotion with just a thing he took out, Lan Qingyue had a look of yearning.

If... If she was the chosen one, how wonderful it would be?

“70 Spiritual Stones!”

An old man from the Demon Subduing Sect bid immediately.

“71 Spiritual Stones!” a young man from Ancient Fist Sect shouted.

“73 Spiritual Stones!” Liu Fei Yun clenched his teeth and yelled.

“Hoho, why is the Liu Family participating in the auction?” The middle-aged man from Lingyue Sect looked at Liu Fei Yun and jeered at him, “Just now, I wonder who said the other party was ignorant about the value of Spiritual Medicine? And who claimed that his Level 3 Spiritual Medicine was awesome? Since it’s so awesome, why do you have to bid?”

Liu Fei Yun’s face turned black immediately upon hearing what he said. “If you want to bid, just offer your price. Stop saying useless shit!”

“Hmph, how arrogant for a junior, just because he thinks he’s the Little Sword Celestial.” The middle-aged man from Lingyue Sect had chilly eyes. He shouted out immediately, “75 Spiritual Stones!”

“76!”

“77”

“Four first-class forces are competing for it. Forget it, we are not qualified to participate in this!”

“Spiritual Stones are the hard currency for the top-notch forces. But it’s too difficult to obtain them!”

“I only had three of them, and I already used them all up for my cultivation.”

The rest of the people watched dumbfoundedly as Liu Family, Ancient Fist Sect, Demon Subduing Sect, and Lingyue Sect competed against each other. All of them let out a soft sigh.

They were totally ineligible to participate.

“85 Spiritual Stones!”

Just when the four first-class forces were in a heated competition, Maniac Ji’s voice cut the air once again as he raised the bid to 85 Spiritual Stones.

This was an extremely high offer.
