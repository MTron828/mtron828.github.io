Chapter 1502: 1502 Level 7 void Interpretation Beast Cub’s shock

Probably not!

He Yuan’s answer shocked everyone around him.

He Yuan and he suiqing were not related by marriage, but they met at a gathering and later became a couple.

He Suiqing’s family and he family naturally did not have any objections to their marriage, but were happy to see it.

The relationship between the two of them was very good.

He suiqing asked he yuan for something, and he would not refuse.

However, now he actually directly rejected he suiqing. This caused everyone’s faces to be filled with astonishment.

At this moment, at the height of more than a thousand meters from the holy tree, in a wooden house.

The He clan’s patriarch and the woman brought he feng into the room and took out some medicinal pills to treat his injuries.

“Father, I...”

He Feng looked at his father and cried out in a slightly aggrieved manner.

He was a little unhappy and didn’t understand what his father had done just now.

“Look at this injury. His arm was directly crippled, and his attack was so heavy. There’s also the injury on his chest. He only needs half a month to recover!”

“Husband, who is that young man? Are you going to let our Feng ‘er off just like that?”

The woman at the side looked at He Feng’s wound and asked her husband with some heartache.

“He is not young anymore. His heart is not broad. He is not allowed to leave the He clan’s forest for five years!”

The He clan leader coldly glanced at He Feng and coldly said.

“Grounded for five years? Father, why?”

He Feng looked at his father with some unwillingness and asked with an embarrassed expression.

“Husband, why did you ground Feng ‘er?”

The woman was also slightly stunned as she frowned and asked the He clan leader.

“Why? It was you who sent people to assassinate him a few days ago, right?”

The He clan leader looked at he feng with a dignified expression.

He Feng was slightly stunned as he slowly lowered his head.

“This child is a monster!”

The He clan leader’s eyes flickered as he spat out a few words. He hesitated for a moment before he gently waved his arm towards the holy tree.

An image appeared in front of them.

The image was the scene from He Yuan’s birthday party. It was so vivid that even the voices could be heard.

This was the image that they obtained with the help of the Holy Tree’s power.

In the image, Wang Xian had just given little rascal to he yuan. He Yuan had rejected he suiqing.

“Little Yuan, you...”

“Seventh level of the Seethrough realm. It’s actually the pup of a seventh level Seethrough realm ferocious beast. Oh My God, brother Wang Xian, you... you...”

However, just as the He clan leader was about to speak, a voice came from the screen, causing him to be completely stunned!

In the birthday banquet, he yuan widened his eyes and stared at Wang Xian with excitement. He exclaimed in disbelief.

“What?”

“What?”

However, his voice caused the expressions of the tens of thousands of people around him to show shock.

“Seventh level void interpretation?”

He suiqing was also stunned. He opened his mouth slightly and looked at little goody in he Yuan’s hand!

“Little Yuan, are you saying that this is a seventh level void interpretation young Vicious Beast?”

She couldn’t help but exclaim in surprise.

The value of a seventh level void interpretation young vicious beast was clear to everyone.

Humans, demonic beasts, and vicious beasts were very different.

Humans didn’t have a bloodline, but it could be said that their potential was limitless.

Demon Beasts and dire beasts had bloodlines, but there were also differences between Demon Beast Cubs and Dire Beast Cubs.

Demon Beasts understood human nature and had higher intelligence, just like the forest fairy race.

They lived together with the He clan and had a level 7 insightful void bloodline.

In theory, as long as the members of the forest fairy race had enough resources, they could break through to level 7 insightful void.

However, that was not the case.

The child of a forest fairy at the seventh level of the profound void tier and a forest fairy at the seventh level of the profound void tier would definitely be able to advance to the seventh level of the profound void tier in the future.

However, the child of a forest fairy at the ninth level of the extraordinary realm and a forest fairy at the ninth level of the extraordinary realm might not be able to advance to the seventh level of the profound void tier.

Even if they could, it would be exceptionally difficult.

This was because their parents’bloodline had not reached the peak of the bloodline. Children born before reaching the peak would have flaws.

Because of the inheritance of the bloodline, the power that their parents did not comprehend would be passed on to the next generation, making it even harder to comprehend.

As time passed on, the bloodline would become even thinner. It would be even harder for them to reach the seventh level of the profound void tier.

It was just like how the forest demon, Fairy, and Demon Beast Clan had a royal family and a princess.

Their Royal Family was the purest bloodline keeper. As long as they had the resources, they could break through.

As for the other ordinary members, they needed to comprehend the power in their bloodlines. This process of comprehension was only slightly easier than that of humans.

If not for this situation, the Dragon Clan and the Demon Beast clan would have already ruled the entire transcendental continent.

At present, there were only twenty or so royal clans in the entire fairy forest, including the younger generation.

However, there was another way for Demon Beasts to pass on their bloodlines. That was, demon beasts whose bloodlines had reached the peak could preserve their bloodlines before they died and leave them to their own kind. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

There were some differences between young ferocious beasts and demon beasts.

Vicious Beasts didn’t have intelligence and only had bestial nature. They would only give birth to their young when they matured.

And maturity meant that they had already reached the peak of their bloodlines.

In other words, as long as this young vicious beast had enough resources, it would be able to advance to the seventh level of the profound void tier.

One could imagine the value of a seventh level profound void tier young vicious beast.

“That’s right, it’s the seventh level of the Seethrough realm. As a Beast Tamer, I can’t be wrong!”

He Yuan stared at little rascal with a fiery gaze.

A young beast at the seventh level of the Seethrough realm was an existence that could grow to the level of his father in the future.

A young beast at the seventh level of the Seethrough realm was a treasure to him and even to the He clan.

“Brother Wang Xian, this... is really for me!”

He Yuan asked Wang Xian excitedly.

“What do you think? I’ve already given it away!”

Wang Xian smiled. “Take it. I’ll have to trouble you to find someone for me in a few days!”

“Huh?”

He Yuan was slightly taken aback before he continued, “This is too valuable. It’s too valuable!”

“Alright, take it if you want. You’re welcome!”

Wang Xian shook his head nonchalantly.

“My, My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, My, my!”

“To master he Yuan, a seventh-level pup, this is... This is bullshit!”

All the young people around felt that the world was a little crazy, and their bodies trembled as they looked at it.

He Yuan pursed his lips and looked at Wang Xian. “Then... Then I’ll Take It!”

Wang Xian nodded with a smile.

“This...”

He suiqing, who was standing at the side, was stunned. A birthday gift for a baby beast of the seventh level of the Void interpretation realm?

She couldn’t believe it. Who would be so generous.

This made her think about how she had promised a bunch of benefits to buy this baby beast. She couldn’t help but blush.
