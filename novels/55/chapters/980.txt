Chapter 981: 0982 arrived one by one!

Translator: 549690339

At the edge of the Thunder Island, a group of Demon Hunters Academy’s mercenary group students stared at Wang Xian with a face full of curiosity and mockery.

Some of them had been on the Thunder Island for a day, while others had been here for more than ten hours.

The students of Demon Hunters Academy would usually cooperate with each other in such special missions.

If someone was in danger, they could call for help through the communication stone plate.

Two hours ago, when one of them just arrived, he was unlucky enough to encounter five transcendent level six thunderfish.

They immediately called for help. Very soon, many mercenary groups on the Thunder Island rushed over and killed the thunderfish.

A transcendent level six thunderfish was worth 500,000 to 600,000 mid-grade spirit stones. Five of them meant more than three million.

Although they had a larger number of people, they still managed to reap a lot of rewards.

However, what surprised them was that they actually bumped into this influential person on campus, the new student Wang Xian.

In the Academy’s Forum, everyone had been discussing about Wang Xian for the past two days.

Furthermore, they were bumped into by the members of the amethyst mercenary group.

Wang Xian looked at the members of the amethyst mercenary group who had an unfriendly expression. He raised his eyebrows slightly and stared at them coldly.

“Oh? Are you still not convinced? Kid, I don’t like you very much!”

The girl from the amethyst mercenary group raised her eyebrows and walked slowly toward Wang Xian.

A faint pressure was emitted from her body. The aura of an extraordinary level five was clearly displayed.

“Sister Qing, you don’t have to do it. Let us do it. This kid has offended classmate Qin Qing. Let us help you teach him a lesson!”

Around them, the leader of a mercenary group walked out with a smile and said to the girl.

“That’s right, let us do it. Sister Qing, tell us how to teach this kid a lesson. Leave such a small matter to us!”

The young men quickly said.

Among the people present, the amethyst mercenary group was the strongest. Furthermore, they were the ones who had to depend on them to kill the five beasts that were at extraordinary level six. The rest of them naturally wanted to curry favor with them.

One by one, the students walked out and looked at Wang Xian and the rest provocatively. They smiled and said.

“Sister Qing, forget it!”

At this moment, Qin Qing, who was standing at the back, suddenly said.

“Huh? Xiao Qing, how can we just forget it? This kid hurt your younger brother!”

The girl was slightly stunned. She pointed at Wang Xian and said to her in astonishment.

“Forget it!”

Qin Qing shook her head with a complicated expression. “It has already happened. Furthermore... Xiao Shan was the one who made the first move. So... forget it. If one day, my strength becomes stronger, I will spar with him myself!”

“This...”

Sister Qing saw that even Qin Qing, the person involved, had said so. She raised her eyebrows and said, “Forget it then. Since Xiao Qing has said so, I will let you off this time!”

As she spoke, she raised her head slightly at Wang Xian!

“Hehe, this is your well-known choice!”

Wang Xian saw their discussion and said indifferently, “This time, it’s Your Luck!”

As he spoke, he walked straight into the Thunder Island with a group of members of the Dragon Palace following behind him.

“You...”

When Sister Qing saw Wang Xian saying this, she was stunned. An angry expression instantly appeared on her face. “You really don’t know what’s good for you. It seems like you need to be taught a lesson!”

“F * ck, you’re too arrogant. Student Qin Qing spared you once, yet you still dare to act pretentious. Sister Qing, as long as you say the word, we will F * ck him immediately!”

“That’s right, you’re too arrogant!”

When the people around heard Wang Xian’s words, they also shouted angrily.

Student Qin Qing was merciful enough to let you off, yet you still dared to say such words.

You’re simply asking for a beating!

Sister Qing glared at Wang Xian indignantly. She frowned slightly when she saw him flying into the room. “Forget it. I Won’t argue with this little fellow. If he is so arrogant, he will be at a disadvantage sooner or later!”

“Let me say this. The goddesses of the amethyst mercenary group are too kind. If it were me, I would have crippled him long ago!”

“That’s right, that’s right!”

Everyone said in a fawning manner.

“Alright, distribute the thunderfish. I will take out the spiritual stones that are equivalent in value to the thunderfish!”

The vice leader of the amethyst mercenary group opened his mouth and ended their conversation.

“Alright, Alright!”

Everyone hurriedly nodded their heads. According to their respective strengths, they obtained the corresponding spirit stones.

“Eh? Another person is coming!”

In less than five minutes, they saw another person flying towards them.

This time, there were about twenty people flying over.

“It’s Yun Hanhai, a group of young master’s mercenary group!”

“The vice leader of young master’s mercenary group is here personally? What are they trying to do?”

“They brought quite a number of people, as well as the experts outside the Academy!”

Everyone looked over, their gazes sharp, and their faces revealed astonishment.

A group of twenty people flew towards the Thunder Island. In the middle was a handsome young man with three special stripes on his face.

Beside him were five young men and more than ten middle-aged men.

These middle-aged men were not students of the demon hunters academy, but belonged to the young master’s mercenary group.

The Demon Hunters Academy’s students could establish a mercenary group to recruit members from outside the academy.

The strength of recruiting members from outside the academy could not exceed the founder.

The Academy would conduct an investigation on the mercenary groups with members from outside the academy. Once it was discovered that an external force had used the identity of the Demon Hunters Academy’s students to obtain benefits, they would be severely punished by the demon Hunters Academy!

No one dared to exploit this loophole.

In the Academy, the top ten mercenary groups all had external members. Furthermore, they were all very powerful.

The external members of the young master’s mercenary group were even more powerful.

Beside Yun Hanhai, there were two experts at transcendent-level rank-6.

The rest were all at transcendent-level Rank-4 and Rank-5!

“Deputy leader Xiao!”

Yun Hanhai looked at the people on the island and looked at the deputy leader of the amethyst mercenary group in the middle. He was all smiles.

“Yes!” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Deputy leader Xiao nodded his head faintly.

“Did you see that freshman Wang Xian?”

Yun Hanhai looked around and asked with a smile.

“Yes, yes, I saw him. Deputy Leader Yun, that guy just went in!”

When a student heard his words, he quickly pointed inside and said.

“Oh? Thank you. Let’s go and meet that freshman who dared to threaten us. Deputy Leader Xiao, Goodbye!”

Yun Hanhai looked inside and walked in with a smile.

“The experts from the young master’s mercenary group actually rushed over!”

“Even vice-captain Yun is here. It seems that Wang Xian won’t be able to leave this place this time!”

“He’s definitely going to be killed by the young master’s mercenary group. Otherwise, vice-captain Yun wouldn’t be here!”

“I think that kid is courting death. He’s too arrogant. He’s done for now!”

The surrounding students watched Yun Hanhai and his group enter the Thunder Island and discussed in hushed voices.

“HMPH, that kid is going to be unlucky!”

“It’s not just unlucky. With young master’s mercenary group’s despicable and vicious nature, that freshman is going to die!”

A few girls from amethyst mercenary group also said in hushed voices.
