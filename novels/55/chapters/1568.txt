Chapter 1569: Title 1569: The Sage

“I want three level-eight light pearls and ten level-seven light pearls!”

When Wang Xian’s voice fell, the already silent surroundings became even quieter. Everyone’s breathing became slightly sluggish.

“What... What does he mean?”

A radiant priest looked over and looked at Wang Xian in astonishment.

Everyone from the Wuji Empire also looked at Wang Xian in unison.

“You... you have a way to save my brother?”

Wu Qingyan was the first to react. Her expression changed as she stared at Wang Xian and asked loudly.

“Yes!”

Wang Xian looked at Wu Qingyan and nodded his head faintly.

“How... How is that possible? Our ancestor said that unless a radiant priest at level nine of the void interpretation stage makes a move, otherwise... how could you...”

Tian Qingguang, who was at the side, trembled. He stared at Wang Xian in disbelief and growled in a low voice.

He could not believe that this fellow could cure a person that even his patriarch could not save.

“Seventeen darkness souls have fused into one and reached level seven of the void interpretation stage. They are expelled from the body of the Crown Prince of Wuqing City. They must be eliminated without harming the crown prince!”

“A radiant priest at the eighth level of the Seethrough realm can not do that unless he is at the ninth level. If he were to attack rashly, he would cause great harm to the Crown Prince!”

Forefather Chenguang frowned as he looked at Wang Xian. He did not believe that a young man could expel the darkness souls from the body of the Crown Prince of Wuqing City, even if he was a monstrous young man.

“If you are not confident, it is best that you do not attack Rashly!”

He added in the end.

All the radiant priests around were also looking at Wang Xian with sparkling eyes.

“How confident are you?”

Patriarch of dark eye frowned as he looked at Wang Xian and asked in a deep voice.

“Just because others can’t do it doesn’t mean I can’t do it. Three level-eight light pearls and ten level-seven light pearls. Senior, how about this reward?”

Wang Xian glanced at the morning light patriarch and said to dark eye patriarch.

“Alright. If you can really cure Qing city, our Wuji Empire will give you this reward!”

Dark eye patriarch stared at this somewhat daring young man and nodded his head heavily.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian smiled and opened his palm. The Light Dragon Pearl appeared in his hand.

The Luminous Dragon Pearl had already reached the seventh level of the Seethrough realm. It was still a long way from the eighth level of the Seethrough realm.

However, it was sufficient to expel the soul of darkness!

“This... This is impossible... unless you have reached the ninth level of the Seethrough realm. However, you are definitely not a radiant priest of the ninth level of the Seethrough Realm!”

Seeing that Wang Xian had really made his move, forefather Chenguang’s expression changed as he spoke in a low voice.

“Impossible? Hehe, a master is a master. Watch carefully and learn from him!”

Wang Xian said to forefather Chenguang in a mocking tone as he moved his arm.

“Roar!”

A dragon’s roar came from the light dragon bead. Following that, the dragon bead slowly transformed into a half-meter-long light divine dragon.

The light divine dragon revolved around Wang Xian.

At this moment, Wang Xian’s body was enveloped by a thick light energy.

Surrounded by the Divine Light Dragon, he looked holy and noble.

He slowly extended his milky-white arm. Wu Qing city, which was suspended in the air, floated towards him.

Roar

The Divine Light Dragon let out a soft roar once again and began to revolve around Wu Qing city.

“What is that? How can it be so agile?”

At the side, the forefather of the morning light stared at the Divine Dragon of light with his eyes wide open. His face was filled with astonishment.

“What a terrifying power of light. Seventh level of the Seethrough realm. Such a young powerhouse at the seventh level of the Seethrough Realm!”

The surrounding priests of light were also looking at him in shock.

Even the forefather of the dark eye was extremely shocked.

Whoosh

Wang Xian waved both of his hands and a pair of jade-like hands of light flew toward Wuqing City. He drew a long gash on his chest.

“What is he trying to do?”

“His Royal Highness the Crown Prince is of the darkness attribute. He is already very powerful since he didn’t suffer any backlash from the dark energy when he cut open his Royal Highness’Chest!”

Everyone around them stared at him and discussed in low voices.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

At this moment, a dragon’s roar that shook the heaven and earth was emitted from the Divine Light Dragon’s mouth.

A terrifying light power spread out in all directions.

“BZZT BZZT BZZT!”

“Be careful!”

In the Wuji Empire, other than Patriarch Dark Eye and the elder holding the dark staff, everyone else retreated to the rear.

They stared at the Divine Light Dragon in fear, their eyes filled with shock.

“So powerful! That creature that condensed light actually gave me a powerful threat!”

An expert at the seventh level of the Seethrough Void took a deep breath and said with a twinkling gaze.

“This... this...”

At this moment, the morning light ancestor was completely speechless.

He stared at the Divine Light Dragon in disbelief with a twinkling gaze.

Buzz

Wang Xian slowly spread his arms. The powerful light force instantly formed a 20-meter-wide domain around him.

In this space, everything was bright and nothing else could be seen.

Even the dark eye patriarch, who was standing by the side, revealed a hint of surprise in his eyes.

His pair of black eyes could not see through this space.

“Roar!”

At this moment, the Divine Light Dragon entered the body of Wu Qing city.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

The moment the Divine Light Dragon entered, the Darkness Soul inside let out a series of roars.

“Come here!”

At this moment, a voice filled with brutality, terror, and command rang in the soul of Darkness’s ears.

Its body trembled as it felt the attraction of its own kind outside.

Looking at the Divine Dragon of light who was competing with it for territory, it hesitated for a moment before flying out.

The moment the soul of darkness emerged from Wu Qing city’s body, Wang Xian waved his arm and a pitch-black Dragon Claw grabbed it.

At the location of his heart, a dark dragon head filled with dignity and brutality appeared.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

The dragon head opened its mouth and swallowed the terrified soul of darkness.

Wang Xian smiled and waved his arm. The Divine Light Dragon flew towards the location of his heart.

The healing of the light landed on Wu Qing Cheng’s chest and the wound healed immediately.

“Huh? I...”

After the dark soul was expelled from Wu Qingcheng’s body, his body moved and he slowly opened his eyes.

“Alright, Congratulations. I didn’t give you face last time. I’ll take it as returning it to you this time. I have a black veil heart fruit here. After consuming it, I reckon you should be able to achieve a breakthrough!”

Wang Xian looked at Wu Qingcheng who had recovered. He waved his arm and the black veil heart fruit landed in front of him as he said faintly.

At the same time, the surrounding light energy had completely dissipated, revealing the figures of two people.

“This...”

Wu Qing Cheng sized up his body and looked at the heart fruit of darkness with a burning gaze.

“Thank you, Pastor Wang. If it wasn’t for you this time, my life would really be in the hands of this group of Darkness Souls!”

As he spoke, he bowed deeply to Wang Xian!
