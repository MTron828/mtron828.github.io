Chapter 1231: On top of the shocking grocery store

Translator: 5496903

Wang Xian walked straight into the store.

Long Xiaotian would occasionally turn his head and glance at Ling Jian ‘ER who was following him. His eyes were sparkling.

Bai Qingshan and the old man followed closely behind. Their eyes were also filled with astonishment.

They waved at the people behind them and followed them into the dragon and Phoenix grocery store.

After entering the store, Wang Xian looked at Ling Jian ‘er behind him and said, “The Golden Lotus Tree is upstairs. Take a look at the first floor and see if there are any items that you need. We can buy them Together Now!”

As he spoke, he pointed at the items around him.

“There are so many weapons and treasures!”

Long Xiaotian, who followed them into the store, looked ahead and was slightly stunned.

There were rows and rows of weapons and armor on the walls. The lowest level was at transcendent level seven or eight.

Apart from the weapons and armor, there were even more precious sets.

There were all kinds of them, at least thousands of them.

Apart from these, there were two pet eggs and a few fierce beasts.

When he saw the Five Little Yan monkeys, his eyes shone with a blazing light.

A half-step void interpretation level demonic beast cub, this...

“This... This even has the bloodline of a half-step void interpretation level ferocious beast. My God...”

When he saw the two well-sealed bloodlines at the side again, his eyes widened with a fiery expression.

The bloodline of a half-step void interpretation level ferocious beast. This thing was extremely rare. A bloodline of this level would sell for at least 50 to 60 billion middle-grade spirit stones.

Even though he was a prince of the Guanglong dynasty and was well-informed, he was still stunned when he saw the items in Wang Xian’s grocery store.

Bai Qingshan and the core experts who followed the second prince widened their eyes when they saw the items around them. They were filled with shock.

This was a grocery store?

Was this a grocery store?

Damn it, everything inside could be auctioned off.

Especially the young demonic beast, the half-step void interpretation bloodline, and the pet eggs. The complete set of weapons, armor, and boots was a huge treasure trove.

How could the items inside a grocery store be so terrifying?

“This is the first floor. Most of the items on the first floor are below the void interpretation level. The items on the second floor are used by the void interpretation experts. There are some weapons, armor, and formations of the void interpretation level!” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Wang Xian smiled when he saw their shocked expressions.

“Let’s go upstairs!”

Ling Jian ‘er scanned the surroundings and said to Wang Xian calmly.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded and led them upstairs.

As soon as they entered the second floor, waves of powerful auras could be felt.

The Blade, the sword aura, and the thick and heavy armor all contained a strong fluctuation.

On the second floor, there were more weapons. There were more than ten void interpretation level longswords, but the fifth level void interpretation level longsword was not taken out, because few people could afford it.

The highest level was a third level void interpretation level longsword.

On the entire second floor, there were about twenty weapons and armor. In addition, there was a golden lotus tree and a second level void interpretation formation.

“Hiss!”

As soon as they entered, everyone sucked in a breath of cold air. They stared at the weapons and armors with burning eyes.

“This... this... brother Wang Xian, where... Where did you get so many treasures? Oh My God, this grocery store is crazy!”

Long Xiaotian stared at Wang Xian with his eyes wide open and asked with a face full of shock.

“It’s alright. I’m ready to sell all the items here as soon as possible!”

Wang Xian smiled faintly and looked at Ling Jian ‘er who was beside him.

“Golden Lotus tree. Metal elemental cultivators can increase the speed of their cultivation by cultivating beside this tree. It’s helpful in comprehending supernatural powers. If you want it, give me 20,000 drops of spiritual liquid!”

Wang Xian said directly to Ling Jian ‘er who was beside him.

“20,000?”

Ling Jian ‘er frowned slightly and looked at her interspatial ring.

“20,000 is considered cheap. After all, this kind of thing is not something that weapons and armor can compare to!”

Wang Xian said directly.

“I don’t have so much spiritual liquid!”

Ling Jian ‘er frowned slightly and said.

“How much do you have?”

Wang Xian frowned slightly and asked her.

“Only 13,000. We are still short of 7,000!”

She said directly.

“How long will it take to get the remaining 7,000?”

Wang Xian looked at her.

“I’ll give it a try. It shouldn’t be a problem for half a month!”

Ling Jian ‘ER said with a frown.

“Alright, give me the 13,000 spiritual liquid and I’ll keep the Golden Lotus Tree for you!”

Wang Xian stretched out his hand with a smile and said to her.

“You... Why aren’t You a gentleman at all?”

Ling Jian ‘er looked at Wang Xian and felt that he was very different from other men. He couldn’t even be called a man.

“I don’t take credit for my small business. Why don’t You Mortgage Xiao Ha Here?”

Wang Xian said plainly.

“Awoo!”

After Wang Xian finished his words, Xiao Ha even let out a cooperative cry.

This made Ling Jian ‘ER’s face turn black. Mortgage Him? When she came to ask for it, Xiao Ha would probably not want to be with her anymore!

“Here, I’ll come and get the Golden Lotus tree in half a month!”

As she spoke, she threw a porcelain bottle to Wang Xian and snatched Xiao Ha away. Then, she walked out with a cold expression on her face.

“Eh...”

Long Xiaotian was stunned when he saw the conversation between Wang Xian and Ling Jian ‘ER.

“Brother Wang Xian, how did you get to Know Ling Jian ‘er?”

Long Xiaotian was a little speechless as he asked him.

“Her? What’s wrong? She lives next door to me!”

Wang Xian looked at him in puzzlement and said.

“Next door? Brother Wang Xian, don’t you know Ling Jian ‘ER’s background?”

Long Xiaotian stared at him and asked in surprise.

“Is his background very strong?”

Wang Xian looked at him.

“It’s not just strong. The young miss of the Heavenly Sword sect, do you think she’s strong? Even the current me can’t compare to her!”

Long Xiaotian looked at Ling Jian ‘ER’s disappearing figure and said.

“Oh? She’s really a rich lady!”

Wang Xian smiled as a hint of surprise flashed in his eyes.

The Heavenly Sword sect was one of the few powerful forces that could match the Guanglong dynasty. The status of the Miss of the Heavenly Sword sect was indeed not simple.

“Rich Lady?”

Long Xiaotian was a little speechless when he heard his words. He hesitated for a moment before continuing to speak to Wang Xian, “Ling Jian ‘ER’s situation is a little special.”

“There is one thing that everyone knows. Ling Jian ‘ER has been expelled from the Heaven Sword sect.”

“Do you know the reason? The sect leader of the Heaven Sword sect was once known as the Most Outstanding Heaven’s favorite in the flowing sea region for a thousand years. His strength was extremely terrifying. Ling Jian ‘er was the first daughter of the sect leader of the Heaven Sword Sect!”

“Later on, the sect leader of the Heaven Sword Sect married another wife. This was nothing to a powerhouse. The second wife gave birth to a son, which was Ling Jian ‘ER’s younger brother!”

“Ling Jian ‘ER’s younger brother’s talent was extremely monstrous, even more monstrous than the sect leader of the Heavenly Sword sect. He was favored by the entire heavenly sword sect and was even determined to surpass the sect in the future.”

“However, a few years ago, something happened. Ling Jian ‘ER’s younger brother and her biological mother killed Ling Jian ‘ER’s mother!”
