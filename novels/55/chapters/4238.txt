Chapter 4239: 4238 to protect the path

Translator: 549690339

Wang Xian wasn’t too surprised that he didn’t completely destroy the river-migrating beast emperor.

If the space beast was so easy to kill, the universe would have been conquered long ago.

He was already very satisfied with his harvest this time.

He was prepared to exchange the corpse of the river-migrating Beast Emperor for a treasure to prepare for his breakthrough.

Of course, Wang Xian was also prepared to give a fifth of the flesh and blood to Tianci.

After all, Tianci was his son.

Although Tianci’s strength was not bad, his tribe was still too weak. He needed some resources.

After returning to the Dragon Palace, Tianci brought a large amount of the flesh and blood of the river-migrating beast emperor back to the six paths universe excitedly.

The corpse of the nine-corpse Beast Emperor last time had greatly improved the Mu Li tribe.

The corpse of such an existence was a huge treasure trove for ordinary cultivators.

This time, they had obtained a huge amount of resources. It was enough to add another four to five experts at the peak of the ruler realm to their Mu Li tribe.

It was extremely difficult for ordinary heaven origin creation realm experts to obtain such a huge amount of resources.

Wang Xian returned to the nine-origin universe and temporarily had some free time.

However, not long after, the fallen Shadow Demon Emperor suddenly contacted him.

Senior Fallen Shadow Devil Emperor! ”

Wang Xian came to the devil race and saw the Fallen Shadow Devil Emperor welcoming him. He shouted with a smile!

“Hehe, Dragon King, come in and have a seat!”

The Fallen Shadow Devil Emperor smiled at Wang Xian and gestured. Wang Xian nodded and entered the main hall of the Fallen Shadow Devil Emperor.

“Greetings, Dragon King! ”

In the main hall, a devil expert greeted Wang Xian respectfully when he saw him!

Wang Xian nodded his head and swept his gaze across the hall.

Senior Fallen Shadow Devil Emperor, have you found a universe that can allow you to break through?”

Wang Xian asked with a smile.

“Yes, I found a universe. It’s not far from the nine-origin universe, but it’s not very close either. There’s still a slot for the darkness attribute of that universe. Pm afraid I’ll have to trouble you, Dragon King. ”

The Shadow Devil Emperor spoke to Wang Xian.

“It’s no trouble. Senior, you’re in charge of the nine-origin universe. It’s only right for me to protect the other disciples. When can we set off? How’s the strength of that Universe?”

Wang Xian asked.

The devil race had disciples who could make a breakthrough. They needed to go to the universe with a slot.

Wang Xian needed to understand the strength of this universe in detail.

After all, occupying a quota in another universe was an invasion for the powerhouses in this universe.

They would suffer intense resistance from their universe.

There might even be a huge battle.

Therefore, Wang Xian had to understand the strength of this universe.

“Three powerhouses in the Heaven’s origin realm. All of them are at the beginner level and are not strong. If nothing unexpected happens, Jiuli should be able to make a breakthrough easily! ”

The shadow devil emperor said, “We can set off at any time! ”

“Alright! ”

Wang Xian nodded. “Then let’s set off now. I have nothing to do now. Don’t worry, senior. I will let the disciple of the devil race complete his breakthrough! ”

“Thank you, Dragon King! ”

The Shadow Devil Emperor cupped his hands at Wang Xian. “Thank you, Dragon King, for protecting my path! ”

At the side, Jiuli from the devil race thanked Wang Xian excitedly.

“No need. We are both beings from the nine-origin universe. This is what I should do! ”

Wang Xian shook his head.

“This is the coordinates of that universe. Be careful. I have a clone there.

Dragon King, contact me when you arrive! ”

The Shadow Devil Emperor passed Wang Xian the coordinates and reminded him.

“Oh? Alright! ”

Wang Xian nodded and looked at Jiuli.

Jiuli bowed to Wang Xian.

He waved his arm and brought the disciples of the demon race out of the nine-origin universe.

Wang Xian came to the chaos outside the nine-origin universe. He took out the location given by the Fallen Shadow Demon Emperor and opened it.

(‘I will keep you in my storage space first. I will summon you when we arrive! ”

Wang Xian spoke to Jiuli!

“I’ll listen to your arrangements, Dragon King!”

Jiuli nodded.

Wang Xian kept him in his mother nest and flew toward the coordinates.

The universe that Jiuli had broken through was found by the Fallen Shadow Demon Emperor’s clone.

It was called the Arnold Universe.

It was a universe with a very strange name.

Disciples with a strong background had great benefits.

At the very least, they didn’t have to risk their lives to search for a universe that they could break through.

Even an avatar of the Fallen Shadow Devil Emperor was still waiting there.

This kind of treatment wasn’t something that the skeleton clan and the divine tiger clan could compare to.

Wang Xian was flying rapidly in the chaos.

Coupled with the power of teleportation, his speed was extremely terrifying.

However, even if Wang Xian was very fast, it wouldn’t be a matter of a day or two to reach there.

It would even take him tens of thousands of years to fly there.

The distance between the universe and the universe was still very far!

Of course, the Dragon Palace had a bug like an lie.

If Wang Xian wanted to come back, it would be very easy!

He traveled quickly through the chaos.

On the way, Wang Xian even saw some creatures from other universes flying in the chaos.

Wang Xian did not linger on the way.

Everything revolved around the breakthrough of the demon disciples.

If the breakthrough was completed, he could take a stroll around.

Time passed day by day.

Soon, Wang Xian flew in the chaos for more than 10,000 years.Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

He looked at the distance and saw that there were still a few thousand years of flying time.

Five thousand years passed in the blink of an eye once again. In front of him, an incomparably huge universe appeared in his line of sight.

The Cataclysm had arrived. Each universe was like a sun in the chaos, extremely eye-catching.

One could see it clearly from a great distance.

Wang Xian took out his communication device and sent a message to the fallen Shadow Demon Emperor!

After that, he continued to fly towards that universe.

More than ten days later, Wang Xian arrived in front of this universe.

“Dragon King! ”

At this moment, the Shadow Devil Emperor also appeared at the front and flew over.

Senior! ”

Wang Xian nodded. He waved his arm and let Jiuli out. “Greetings, Lord Shadow Devil Emperor! ”

Jiuli immediately bowed to the Shadow Devil Emperor!

“Get up. We will bring people into their universe to make a breakthrough. It will attract the attention of the entire universe. When the time comes, we will need you to intimidate them, Dragon King!”

The Fallen Shadow Devil Emperor spoke to Wang Xian!

“No problem. If they don’t agree, we will fight! ”

Wang Xian nodded.

This was the law of Chaos in the Aeon.

Strength was king.

If anyone tried to stop them, they would fight and kill them.

Wang Xian and the rest’s methods were considered relatively mild during the aeon.

If some evil-aligned powerhouses encountered a weak universe, they might not even be able to make a breakthrough.

They might even slaughter all the living beings in the universe.

They would absorb blood and eat flesh to increase their strength.

This kind of thing was very common during the calamity..
