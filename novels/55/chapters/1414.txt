Chapter 1415: 1415, what is a heaven’s Pride? 1

Tingfeng City!

Hanyang city!

Lingwei city!

In the following days, Wang Xian, Feng Luan, and a group of girls walked past one city after another.

In these cities, they met arrogant families and rich second-generation children who wanted to molest Xiao Yu and the group of girls.

Their results could be imagined.

As the Queen of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire, it was no exaggeration to say that she controlled the lives of billions of people in the entire dragon and Phoenix Empire.

Those who committed crimes within a city were directly eliminated.

There were also kinder families and experts with great ambitions who were directly recruited by Feng Luan and conferred as Ministers of the Dragon and Phoenix dynasty.

They walked through dozens of cities consecutively and used nearly a hundred days.

Along the way, they also browsed through the scenery of the various cities.

“In this competition, I must obtain a spot in the top ten. Only then will I have a chance to enter the dragon and Phoenix Imperial City and battle with the geniuses of more than 200 cities in the entire dynasty!”

“Competing with the heaven’s favorites from more than 200 cities. Just thinking about it makes me very excited. If I can reach the royal city, I will have a chance to meet the Queen!”

“Her Majesty the Queen is a peerless expert at the fifth level of the Seethrough Void realm. I heard that Her Majesty the Queen is secretly visiting in disguise. In the past few months, she has visited dozens of cities. Some families and city lords who have bad manners have been punished. I really want to see the Queen’s heroic bearing!”

“Haha, I want to see it too. I wonder if there’s a chance!”

In front of a huge city, Wang Xian, Feng Luan, and a group of girls walked onto a spacious road and walked into the city ahead.

In the surroundings, young men who were filled with fighting spirit rode on their mounts and walked into the city in high spirits.

“This is flaming sun city, once the imperial city of a dynasty. Now, this city is one of the top five cities in the dragon-phoenix Dynasty!”

“This is also the furthest city from our dragon and Phoenix Imperial City. It’s more than 100,000 kilometers away!”

Walking on the road, Feng Luan introduced the city to Wang Xian and the rest with a smile.

“It seems that this place is only about 100,000 kilometers away from the cemetery of humans and demons!”

Wang Xian looked around and said.

“Yes, this place is very close to the cemetery of humans and demons!”

Feng Luan nodded and looked towards the east. “The area within 200 to 300 thousand kilometers around the tomb of the humans and demons is the most glorious place in the flowing sea region!”

Wang Xian nodded slowly. That was indeed the case. There were four top-notch forces, one dynasty, and one Sky Sword sect that was close to the dynasty.

“Your Majesty, it seems that the results of the Dragon and Phoenix Dynasty’s prodigy competition are pretty good!”

Mang Hong, who was sitting at the side, looked around and said happily.

“Yes, it’s going well. It will be held every three years. In this way, our dragon and Phoenix dynasty will have an endless stream of experts!”

Feng Luan also nodded in satisfaction.

As soon as they entered the city, a lively atmosphere blew over.

“The discipline and order of this flaming sun city is quite good!”

Guan Shuqing and Xiaoyu glanced around and found that this place was much better than other cities. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Hehe, now that news of the Queen’s private visit in disguise has basically spread in the dragon and Phoenix dynasty, which city lord or family member dares to be impudent?”

Mang Hong said with a smile.

“This atmosphere is good. It seems that there will be a prodigy competition here in the next few days. We can watch the competition, Hehe!”

Shu Qing, Xiao Yu, and the rest of the girls were filled with energy along the way.

There was a constant flow of delicious food and beautiful scenery. If they saw anything good, they would immediately buy it.

This was just like a woman shopping. She was full of energy. Even Feng Luan was not immune to it. Under the guidance of a few girls, she bought many beautiful clothes, rouge, and gadgets.

Wang Xian was in a good mood when he saw how happy they were.

“That’s not bad. Let’s treat it as a martial arts competition performance. Haha!”

Wang Xian laughed and echoed from the side.

Everyone laughed.

Once they entered the center of the city, the management of the entire flaming sun city was in place. It was basically harmonious.

As the former Imperial City, there were many strong people and powerful families here.

The group of them looked for many restaurants but could not find a place to stay. Hence, they bought a manor.

This was their last stop. The first Heaven’s pride competition of the dragon-phoenix Empire was about to be held in the dragon-phoenix royal city.

Feng Luan was going to appear during the competition.

“Xiao Xian, sister Feng Luan, we got more than ten admission tickets for tomorrow’s competition. Look, they are at the front row!”

Wang Xian, Feng Luan, and Sun Lingxiu sat in the courtyard of the manor and sipped their tea.

Xiao Yu and Shu Qing, who were full of energy, came back with tickets in their hands and said happily.

“Alright, Alright. Let’s Go and take a look tomorrow!”

Wang Xian nodded with a smile.

“I heard that the night scenery of Yanyang city is very beautiful. Shall we go out for a walk tonight?”

Xiao Yu pulled Wang Xian’s arm and said.

“You guys are really full of energy!”

Wang Xian shook his head helplessly.

“Alright!”

Feng Luan nodded her head with some interest.

Wang Xian was even more helpless.

In the evening, they arrived at a new city. Everyone was filled with novelty.

Xiao Yu and Shu Qing, who were the most excited, held their communication stone plates and looked at the tour guide.

“Let’s go to the shore of Hero Lake first. That is the most famous lakeside in Yanyang City. There is a saying that if you can’t reach the shore of Hero Lake, you are not a hero. Let’s Go!”

Xiao Yu said loudly.

The group of people naturally didn’t have any objections and walked towards the so-called hero Lake.

“So many people!”

The group of people came to a lake that only had a radius of five kilometers. Only then did they know what it meant to have a lot of people.

“The waning moon young master from the waning Moon City is in front. Quick, quick, let’s go and have a look!”

“The waning Moon Young Master is the number one prodigy in the waning moon city. He can definitely rank in the top three or even number one in this prodigy competition!”

“Young master Nan Feng, Young Master Qian Jun, and goddess Hua Hua are all at the front. They are all strong contenders for the first place!”

At this moment, the voices of young men and women could be heard from the surroundings.

Especially some women. Their eyes were glowing as they walked forward like they were chasing after a star.

“The atmosphere here is pretty good!”

Wang Xian looked around and revealed a faint smile.

“Let’s go, let’s go and take a look at the heaven’s favorites in this competition!”

Xiao Yu walked forward with great interest.

Wang Xian and the rest followed behind.

“Your temperament is extraordinary and your head is prominent. All of you are the Heaven’s favorites in the Flaming Sun Continent. In the upcoming competition, the Heaven’s favorites will compete for supremacy. I wish all of you young masters and ladies the best!”

“Haha, Miss Hua Hua, you don’t have to be so humble. Everyone knows your strength. There are not many people who are your match in this competition!”

Just as they got closer to the front, Wang Xian and the rest heard loud and hearty laughter.

The laughter was filled with ease.

Wang Xian and the rest looked over. There were more than 20 young men under a pavilion by the Lakeside.

Some of them were sitting, some were leaning on bamboos, and some were holding wine flasks. All of them were extraordinarily handsome.

Many of the people around looked over with admiration and respect.

“HMM? A group of level eight transcendents. There are even a few level nine transcendents among them. They are not bad!”

Wang Xian looked over and commented indifferently!
