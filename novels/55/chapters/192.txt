Chapter 193: Annihilation (3)

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

The sun was shining. A gust of cool breeze drifted over, cooling the summer.

When the cool breeze came off the engagement ceremony at Flowing Water Villa, it was a bone-piercing chill.

All of them watched as the young man and girl took their leave while the black-attired men slowly closed up the blockade.

“You want to destroy Liu Family?” Liu Jingshan clenched his long sword tightly with a ghastly look as he swept his gaze across the black, imposing old man and Maniac Ji.

“Miracle Doctor Wang cured my son. You can only blame your grandson for this!” Maniac Ji drew his long saber slowly as his body gave off an immense killing aura.

“Heh, Unexpected. A mere Miracle Doctor of Rivertown could summon two Inborn Experts. What a surprise.” Liu Jingshan let out distasteful laughter. Apparently, he misunderstood that the people of Dragon Sect also owed Wang Xian their favor.

He swept his gaze across all the people. “Destroying Liu Family? I’m afraid it is not that simple.”

“Heh, I’ll wipe out your entire family instantly.” Mo Qinglong looked at Liu Jingshan with a disdainful look. As he spoke, he struck!

“Run! Get out of here! Get out of here!” Lan Family and the rest of the guests fled in all directions with fear when they saw how the situation developed.

The battle of Inborn Experts was not something they could participate in. If they got involved, they’d either get seriously injured or die.

“Why didn’t you tell me when such serious things like this happened to you?” Wang Xian and Lan Qingyue strode to one of the rooms and turned a deaf ear to the devastating screams behind them.

“Why should I?” Lan Qingyue looked over her shoulder and returned a question.

Wang Xian drew a bitter smile on his face. It seemed like Lan Qingyue still bore grudges over his choice of Guan Shuqing.

“But for what you did today, I’ll forgive you.” Lan Qingyue hesitated as she saw his smile. “But, Liu Family...”

“Leave the Liu Family to them. Don’t worry. I’m not afraid of them.” Wang Xian chuckled and continued, “We’ll settle your family’s affairs together. When people learn about what happened today, Lingyue Sect and Zhou Family wouldn’t dare to play any tricks. If they did, there’s nothing to fear either!”

“Thank you, Xiao Xian!” Lan Qingyue stopped and looked at him, as she was touched.

Wang Xian grinned. “A red wedding gown would suit you better. Wear the red one next time!”

Lan Qingyue slightly blushed when she heard his comment. She reached out her hands to hug him gently.

Wang Xian revealed a thrilled expression as he hugged her tightly. He whispered in her ear, “You must be tired from the last few days. Why don’t we enjoy ourselves for a few days? I’ll take you out to sea.”

“Sure, I’ll call my parents to tell them that I’m having a break for the next few days.” Lan Qingyue struggled out of his hug and stretched herself. She then ran to the room next door with a beaming face and took out her phone to call her parents.

“Hello, Qingyue? Are you okay?” Lan Qingyue’s father held his phone as he watched Liu Jingshan spit out fresh blood in the air. He asked this with trepidation.

“Dad, I’m going out with Xiao Xian for a few days. These last few days have been tiring for me. I want to have a good rest!” Lan Qingyue spoke in a joyful mood.

“Sure, go and have fun with Miracle Doctor Wang. You don’t have to worry about anything!” Lan Qingyue’s father quickly agreed.

Since his daughter had gotten such capable boyfriend, why the hell would they want to continue with the political marriage with Liu Family? What’s more, they were almost dead now.

So long as they befriended Miracle Doctor Wang, Lan Family was not afraid of Zhou Family and Lingyue Sect.

Besides, the Miracle Doctor Wang was, obviously, much easier to get along with than the Liu Family.

“I’m done, Xiao Xian. Let’s go. I want to relax for a few days!” Lan Qingyue changed out of her wedding gown and came to Wang Xian with thrills all over her face. She looked like she was a little carefree girl.

“Let’s go. We’ll go out to the sea. The yacht that I bought a few days ago just arrived today,” Wang Xian said with a smile.

“Sure, let’s go to the sea. I’m going to swim, surf and fish...” Lan Qingyue exclaimed with excitement.

“Sure, let’s go!” Wang Xian held her hand and went outside.

Lan Qingyue was only 22 years old now, and she should not be responsible for the entire group. She should not endure a marriage that she hated. She should be learning and having fun in school without a single worry.

“Wow, what a beautiful villa and yacht!” They took a car to the villa that sat right next to the sea. Lan Qingyue was animated as soon as she saw the villa and the yacht.

“I’ll pick up something from the house!” As Wang Xian spoke, he went into the villa and picked up swimsuits, red wine, tea leaves, and some supplies.

“Qingyue, let’s head out to the sea!” Wang Xian brought her to the yacht.

“What a beautiful yacht. It’s much better than the one my dad bought!” Lan Qingyue looked at the luxury yacht that was over 30 meters long with an ebullient expression. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The yacht was divided into two levels. The ground floor had a sofa, kitchen, dining area, and it was quite spacious.

There were four rooms on the second floor.

A 30-meter-long yacht had a floor area that was larger than an average house!

“Xiao Xian, can you drive a yacht?” Lan Qingyue asked as she roamed around the yacht.

“Ahem, I think there should be driving instructions. I’m quite smart, so there shouldn’t be any problems!”

Driving a yacht required a license too. But Wang Xian believed he could handle it.

“Haha, let’s do it together.” Lan Qingyue followed behind Wang Xian with much interest.

Wang Xian took the operating manual. He was examining the brand new yacht with a beaming face.

“The oil tank is full. Let’s set out now.”

With a smiling face, Wang Xian began to operate the yacht as it sailed slowly out to the sea.

“Be careful, Xiao Xian. You’re maneuvering it without a license!” Lan Qingyue said, grinning.

“Haha, don’t worry. Leave this to me. Let’s go somewhere shallow first before we go further out? We can enjoy ourselves for the next two to three days!” said Wang Xian with a smile.

“Sure!”

The yacht continued to sail across the sea. As a first-timer, Wang Xian did not dare to drive it too fast. But without knowing, he actually drove them to somewhere near the Dragon Sect island.

He hesitated and stopped the yacht. “Let’s stop and check out this place!”

“Okay, I want to catch some fish. How about having fish for dinner?”

“There is diving equipment on the yacht. We can dive and catch some lobsters for dinner!”

“I don’t dare to do that. Is the water deep over here? Will there be any sharks?”

“Haha, how can there be? Let’s go. I’ll take you out for a swim!”

Wang Xian and Lan Qingyue changed into diving suits and dived underwater freely.

Swimming, diving, and fishing.

Wang Xian even caught some lobsters and crabs for dinner.
