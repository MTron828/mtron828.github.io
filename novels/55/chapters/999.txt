Chapter 1000: 1001 is going to be your enemy?

Translator: 5496903

“Hiss!”

The atmosphere in the banquet turned heavy. The surrounding students took in a breath of cold air when they saw this scene.

The amethyst mercenary group was actually willing to become enemies with young master’s mercenary group for the sake of that freshman. This...

When the devilish youth heard Zhang Yitian’s words, the expression on his face changed slightly and sank.

“Yun Hanhai and a few members of my young master’s mercenary group are still missing because of him. My Young Master’s mercenary group will not let him off. Otherwise, others will think that we are easy to bully!”

The devilish youth stared at Zhang Yitian and said in a deep voice.

“Yun Hanhai’s whereabouts are still unknown. You Can’t blame others!”

Zhang Yitian frowned slightly and said, “This is your own matter. Don’t blame others!”

“I, Snake Mark, have promised Master Yun that no matter if Yun Hanhai is dead or alive, this kid will die!”

Snake Mark’s body slowly emitted a faint killing intent, and his voice became cold.

Zhang Yitian’s expression slightly changed when he heard this.

Snake Mark picked up a glass of wine on the table, he slowly shook his head, “Yun Hanhai is not only the vice leader of my young master’s mercenary group, but also the most outstanding disciple of the Yun family. This matter is not something that you, Zhang Yitian, Can Stop!”

Zhang Yitian’s expression kept changing. The faces of the girls from the amethyst mercenary group around him were also a little embarrassed.

The Yun family was not something that their academy’s mercenary group could compare to.

That was a very powerful family in the entire eastern sea city.

If they really vented their anger on Wang Xian because of the incident with Yun Hanhai, they would not be able to do anything about it.

“What happened at the banquet?” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“I don’t Know? Why does it seem like the young master’s mercenary group and the amethyst mercenary group are in a standoff?”

“Could it be that snake mark is causing trouble?”

At this moment, more than 30 people walked into the banquet. The young man in the middle looked ordinary.

There was an inch-long scar on his face. The scar was very obvious. It was obvious that he had been injured not too long ago.

The group of people walked over with curious expressions. Their gazes swept over and they smiled. “Come, come, let’s watch a Show!”

The scar-faced youth crossed his arms and looked at them with curious expressions.

When the surrounding students saw them arrive, their faces revealed respectful expressions.

“Leader, senior, it’s that senior, it’s him...”

Suddenly, the youth beside him hurriedly pulled the scar-faced youth’s arm and said with an excited expression.

“What senior?”

The scar-faced youth glared at the youth beside him and slightly raised his head to glance at him.

However, it was this glance that caused his expression to stiffen.

He couldn’t help but widen his eyes and use his hand to wipe his face.

“It’s him, it’s really him!”

The scarred youth muttered and couldn’t help but touch the scar on his face.

This was the scar left behind five days ago in the wilderness.

At that time, he and the members of the mercenary group were preparing to hunt the cloud clams, but they didn’t expect that things would go beyond their expectations.

The entire aerial beast mercenary group had almost been wiped out.

If it wasn’t for the sudden appearance of that young expert who wiped out the group of extraordinary rank 6 cloud clams with a wave of his arm, they would have died long ago.

What he didn’t expect was to meet his savior and that senior here.

However, this senior seemed to be...

His expression changed as his eyes flickered.

The group of young men around him also stared at Wang Xian with their eyes wide open.

“Even if it’s not something that our financial mercenary group can stop, we still have to give it a try!”

Zhang Yitian’s face darkened as he spoke to snake mark.

“Alright, Alright. Since that’s the case, don’t blame me for being ruthless. Let me state my words here today. Whoever dares to protect this kid will be the enemy of my young master’s mercenary group.”

“Once they become enemies, I, Snake Mark, will make them pay a heavy price!”

Snake mark pointed at Wang Xian and glared at Zhang Yitian with a face full of killing intent!

When the surrounding members saw that snake mark was completely enraged, they were terrified.

A furious snake mark was capable of doing anything.

With the rich financial resources of the young master’s mercenary group, he might hire assassins to attack directly in the city!

When the scarred young man saw snake mark pointing his finger at Wang Xian, his expression changed instantly as he stared at him gloomily.

“Pay a heavy price? I would like to see how you will pay a heavy price for becoming your enemy!”

The scarred youth pushed aside the bodies of the youths in front of him and walked straight inside.

Behind him, a group of members of the Void Beast mercenary group followed behind, their gazes fixed on the members of young master’s mercenary group.

“Oh? What’s going on?”

“F * ck, the Void Beast mercenary group is here. What is Commander Xiahou Ming trying to do?”

When the surrounding people saw the void beast mercenary group suddenly joining in, they felt a little dizzy.

The Void Beast mercenary group was ranked second in the Demon Hunter College, and its strength was even stronger than amethyst.

Its leader, Xiahou Ming, was the son of a diamond-ranked mercenary group leader in East Sea City. His strength was formidable, and his talent was terrifying.

Xiahou Ming was a very loyal person, and he had a group of brothers following him.

However, why did the void Beast mercenary group join in? Could it be that they wanted a hero to support a beauty?

“If you want to touch my ex... Big Brother, you have to go through me first. Why? Does your young master’s mercenary group want to be enemies with us void beasts as well?”

Xia houming walked towards Wang Xian and smiled at him. He turned around and stared at Snaketrace as he asked coldly.

“You...”

Snaketrace’s expression changed drastically when he saw Xia houming who suddenly appeared. He growled in a low voice, “Xia houming, this matter has nothing to do with you!”

“How could it have nothing to do with me? The matter of my Big Brother is my matter. Whoever dares to touch him will become our void beast mercenary group’s enemy!”

“That’s right. Whoever dares to touch our big brother will become our enemy!”

Behind him, a few members of the void beast mercenary group shouted angrily.

They were full of loyalty!

“Oh my God, Why did the Void Beast mercenary group step out to help that freshman!”

“Big Brother? How does Xia houming address a freshman as Big Brother? could he be a relative?”

“The amethyst mercenary group was willing to make enemies with young master’s mercenary group for his sake, and now the Void Beast mercenary group is also doing the same. The Academy’s second and third ranked mercenary group is making a move at the same time. Who else would dare to provoke him?”

Snake Mark’s devilish white face began to change color, and his eyes were filled with fury.

An amethyst mercenary group had already made him feel extremely troubled. Now, another void Beast mercenary group had appeared!

What was the relationship between them and this brat? How could he make the massive amount mercenary group not hesitate to make an enemy out of them!

Zhang Yitian and the group of amethyst mercenary group girls looked at Xia houming in astonishment.

Why did he also stand up for Wang Xian?

Could it be that they knew each other before? There was a high possibility!

The group of girls thought to themselves and smiled. They raised their heads and stared at the group of people from the young master’s mercenary group with a smile.

Wang Xian watched this scene with an indifferent expression. When he saw the group of people who suddenly appeared, he was a little puzzled.

Who are they?

They didn’t seem to know each other!
