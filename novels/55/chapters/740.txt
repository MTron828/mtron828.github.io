Chapter 741: 0742 immortal gate blocking and assassination 2(19/20)

Translator: 549690339

“Immortal gate blocking!”

“Assassination!”

Ling Xiao, Huang Tian, and the others who were standing at the side were stunned. Their eyes widened as they looked at Mo Qinglong and the others in astonishment.

What was the immortal gate blocking?

It was a group of experts surrounding the entrance of another immortal gate. If the other party came out, they would kill them one by one!

This was clearly telling you that if I wanted to F * ck you, you could come out and F * ck us.

If you don’t dare to come out, fine, then don’t come out.

If you don’t come out, they won’t care. We’ll go assassinate you.

This is a kind of aboveboard bullying, an aboveboard insult, and it’s aboveboard to kill you!

The Yellow Heaven Immortal Sect’s assassination team was dumbstruck.

You’re trying to block an immortal sect, an immortal sect from the Nine Cauldrons world. How Can You Be So Awesome?

Now, their Hunyuan Immortal Sect was trying to assassinate their crown prince, the son of their sect leader.

At most, they would set up an assassination team to take revenge using assassination methods.

That was because even if fifteen top-tier experts of the Hunyuan Immortal sect died, they still had a power that could not be ignored.

If they were to fight, their Yellow Heaven Immortal sect would also suffer heavy losses.

But now, this group of people wanted to directly block the immortal sect. This was too arrogant!

However, feeling the strength of this group of people, they pursed their lips and fell silent again.

More than fifty infant realm experts.

This force was even more than the infant realm experts of their Yellow Heaven Immortal sect.

In particular, besides the five people on the surface, according to the voice in the void, he still had five subordinates.

These five subordinates might be around them, so they couldn’t sense it. Even their sect leader couldn’t find their specific location.

A terrifying assassin, a natural born assassin!

This power did indeed have the right to block the immortal sect after fifteen experts of the chaos origin immortal sect had died.

And that terrifying assassin also had the ability to enter the immortal sect and assassinate the disciples of the Chaos Origin Immortal sect!

“Sect Master Ling, I’ll have to trouble everyone to take care of our eldest princess!”

Ao Jian said to Ling Xiao. Then, the group of people moved and flew directly towards the Chaos Origin Immortal sect.

Ling Xiao’s eyes sparkled as he watched the group of people fly away.

“What a domineering and domineering behavior!”

Elder Feng’s eyes sparkled as he stared at the group of people flying away. His face was filled with shock as he said.

“They are very strong. That middle-aged man who is like a sharp sword and that terrifying creature in the void. When they join forces, their strength is not weaker than mine!”

Ling Xiao said with a slight sigh. The moment Ao Yao appeared, he even felt a sense of fear.

The other party took advantage of his unpreparedness and very likely assassinated him.

“Sect leader, then we...”

Elder Feng looked at the group of people in front of him somewhat awkwardly.

Ten nascent realm and thirty Dan realm. This was already a very powerful force.

However, compared to the group of people just now, they were simply too weak.

They were still preparing to launch a sneak attack, while the others were openly blocking the immortal sect.

The two were on completely different levels.

“They’re theirs, we’re ours!”

Ling Xiao said slowly.

“It’s the sect leader!”

Elder Feng knew what the sect leader meant. His son had been assassinated, and in the end, there were even more people who had been implicated by a girl.

How should he put it? There was a sense of shame and humiliation. This made him feel how his own son felt in front of that girl.

Ling Xiao shook his head.

“Let’s go over and take a look. We Can’t Lose!”

Elder Feng’s figure moved, and he led the assassination team to fly towards the location of the Chaos Origin Immortal sect.

The Chaos Origin Immortal sect was located in a valley.

The entrance to the valley was the entrance to the Hunyuan City of the Hunyuan Immortal sect.

It extended all the way to the back and was the Hunyuan Immortal sect.

The entire area had a circumference of fifty kilometers. The Hunyuan City had a population of two to three million people. Eighty percent of them were disciples and family members of the Hunyuan Immortal sect!

On both sides of the Hunyuan City were huge mountains, creating a super city that was easy to defend but hard to attack.

The gate of the city of origin was 20 meters high and 40 to 50 meters wide. From Afar, it looked very spectacular. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

After the Yellow Heaven Immortal Gate sounded the alarm, the gate of origin not far away also sounded the alarm.

They did not dare to guarantee that Ling Xiao would not go crazy and start a war between the two immortal gates.

Therefore, the entire gate of origin was in a state of alert.

On the city wall above the chaos origin immortal sect, a group of Chaos Origin City Guards stood on top of it to patrol.

“The Chaos Origin Immortal sect only has one main entrance. There might be a secret passage, but we can just block it here!”

The Sun was high up in the sky. From Afar, one could see more than 50 figures walking towards the direction of the chaos origin city with murderous auras.

The main entrance of the chaos origin city was not closed because there was no need to close it.

Although the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect and the Hunyuan Immortal sect had shed all pretense of cordiality, the Hunyuan City belonged to the immortal gods. Once someone dared to break in, the immortal gods could kill the intruders.

There were many trucks outside the gate of the Hunyuan Immortal sect. The words “Hunyuan”were written on the trucks.

Obviously, these were the trucks that the Hunyuan Immortal sect had purchased outside.

“The Hunyuan Immortal sect only has this one city gate. We can just block them here!”

Mo Qinglong looked around and a cold expression appeared on his face.

“Strange Demon, don’t make a move for the time being. First, block them outside the city. Then, go to the city and kill them. Finally, kill them inside the immortal sect!”

Ao Jian stopped. “Strange demon and I will not show ourselves!”

“Ao Jian and strange demon, you don’t have to show yourselves. Just leave it to us disciples of the Dragon Gate. If the immortal gods don’t show themselves, we disciples of the Dragon Gate won’t even care about a Hunyuan immortal sect!”

Mo Qinglong said confidently.

Mo Qinglong’s current strength was at the half-step immortal God realm, while the others were all at the peak of the infant realm.

With the cultivation under the spiritual energy waterfall and the one-year cultivation under the star guiding disc, their strength far surpassed the ordinary infant realm.

Moreover, because of the Divine Dragon bloodline, although their combat strength was not at the half-step immortal God level, they could still resist five or six half-step immortal gods.

“The guy in front, you’re standing in the middle and looking for death. Get lost!”

The truck was traveling on the road. When it saw Mo Qinglong and the others walking in the middle of the road, a middle-aged man stuck his head out and berated them.

“Are they from the Chaos Origin Immortal Sect?”

Mo Qinglong asked indifferently.

“That’s right. Get out of the way! Don’t court death!”

As the truck drove on without slowing down, the middle-aged man roared.

“That’s right!”

Mo Qinglong and the others were expressionless.

“Motherf * cker, who are these guys?”

The middle-aged man in the truck revealed a hint of anger. “Get out of the way! Since they won’t budge, I’ll just ram them and kill them!”

Those who dared to block the path of their primordial immortal sect were courting death!

“This is a warning period. Don’t tell me they’re from the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect!”

The driver was slightly taken aback as he asked.

“If they’re not from the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect, then I don’t know where they came from to seek death in the real world. Just Ram straight into them! I Can’t believe they won’t Budge!”

“Alright!”
