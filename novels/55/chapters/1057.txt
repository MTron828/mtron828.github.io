Chapter 1058: 1059, I’m the team leader. Is there anyone who isn’t convinced?

Translator: 5496903

“Who is he? Why haven’t I seen him before?”

“That’s right. Who Is this guy? What qualifications does he have to be our team leader?”

“He’s a little familiar, but I don’t think I have much of an impression of him!”

“It’s him...”

When Wang Xian walked over, all the students were stunned. They looked at this young-looking voice in astonishment.

Some of them looked puzzled while some of them looked surprised.

Some of them recognized him, but most of them didn’t.

However, Qian Hu, who took a step forward, looked a little embarrassed.

“Vice principal, who is he? What qualifications does he have to be our leader?”

Qian Hu asked loudly with a sullen face.

Vice Principal Zhao smiled and didn’t answer him. Instead, he looked at Wang Xian.

Wang Xian knew that the vice-principal wanted him to take care of it. After thinking about it, it made sense. Since such an important task was given to him, he naturally had to convince his subordinates first.

Wang Xian nodded his head faintly and looked at the five hundred plus students below.

The reason why he agreed to lead the demon Hunters Academy to Shenghai town was firstly because of the favor from the Demon Hunters Academy. Secondly, it was also a huge opportunity for him when the demon beasts attacked the city.

If he could obtain a large number of corpses after the demon beasts attacked the city, it would be able to accumulate a terrifying amount of resources for the Dragon Palace.

Even if the demon Hunter College didn’t send him to Shenghai town, Wang Xian would still bring the members of the Dragon Palace over.

“Let me introduce myself first. My name is Wang Xian!”

Wang Xian placed his hands behind his back and swept his gaze across all the students in front of him.

Most of them were at transcendent level four while there were dozens of them who were at level five. As for those who were at level six, he could count them on one hand.

There were a few familiar faces in there. They were Xia houming from the Void Beast mercenary group, a few members from the Void Beast mercenary group, and a few members from the amethyst mercenary group.

“The new student of the Academy is the leader of this team. I hope everyone will obey my orders!”

Wang Xian stood on top of them and said with a faint smile on his face.

“New Student?”

“Wang Xian, is he the new student Wang Xian?”

“The young man who killed Yun Hanhai and Snake Mark? If it wasn’t for the Yun and snake families being assassinated by the dragon thorns, this kid would probably be dead by now!”

“I heard that he has eleven subordinates at transcendent level seven. Even so, he isn’t qualified to be our team leader, right?”

“Are you kidding me? Letting a freshman be our leader? This is such an insult to us!”

When Wang Xian finished his words, the students immediately burst into an uproar.

They had heard of Wang Xian’s name before. He was a very impressive freshman who was unbridled in the academy.

However, a freshman like you is our leader. Where is our face?

“You must be joking. A freshman is leading a group of senior students. Vice President, this...”

Qian Hu’s face darkened instantly as he said to Vice President Zhao with an embarrassed expression.

“Haha, I, Xia houming, agree. Other than student Wang Xian, no one else is qualified to lead us!”

At this moment, Xia houming’s voice rang out, causing everyone to be slightly stunned.

Xia houming’s strength was second only to Qian Hu. Furthermore, the mercenary group that he established was ranked second in the academy. His words caused everyone around to be stunned.

“We agree as well!”

“We agree as well!”

Very soon, the members of the Void Beast Mercenary Group and amethyst mercenary group also spoke up.

“Alright, who else is unconvinced?”

Wang Xian revealed a smile when he heard the words of the Void Beast mercenary group and amethyst mercenary group.

However, Qian Hu’s expression turned ugly. He stared at Wang Xian with a gloomy expression.

“I’m not convinced. A freshman is not qualified to be our leader!”

Qian Hu narrowed his eyes and stared at Wang Xian coldly.

He was the leader of the number one mercenary group in the Academy. At the same time, he was also recognized as the strongest person in the academy. How could he agree to let a freshman lead them.

So what if Xia houming and the rest agreed?

The agreement of a defeated opponent didn’t represent Qian Hu.

“Is there anyone else who doesn’t agree?”

Wang Xian looked at Qian Hu who was standing at the front indifferently. His expression didn’t change at all.

It didn’t matter if he didn’t agree. Those who didn’t agree would step forward.

“We don’t agree. What right does a little guy have to be our leader?”

“That’s right. For this mission, only our leader Qian is qualified to be our leader!”

Soon, another seven to eight young men stood up and stared at Wang Xian with disdain.

“Vice principal, it’s not good to let a first-year student be our leader. With his strength and experience!”

At this moment, a middle-aged man standing beside vice principal Zhao frowned and whispered to the vice principal.

The middle-aged man was somewhat similar to Qian Hu. In fact, he was a director of the Academy and a high-ranking member of the Demon Hunter Academy.

However, he didn’t understand why vice principal Zhao had called a new student to be the team leader this time.

In his opinion, only his son had the qualifications.

And this opportunity was very important to his son. With him as the team leader, he would definitely be able to complete the mission better.

At that time, he could easily keep his son in the Demon Hunters Academy!

When he saw a kid who suddenly appeared, his expression turned ugly as well!

“Just watch!”

Vice-principal Zhao waved his hand with a smile.

“You guys aren’t convinced? Is there anyone else?”

When Wang Xian saw the dozen or so people who stood out, the corners of his mouth curled up slightly.

“What’s wrong, Kid? Do you want to beat us into submission?”

Qian Hu stared at Wang Xian coldly and mocked him.

“You got it!”

Wang Xian smiled. With a move of his arm, the lightning strike wood instantly appeared in his hand.

“Then let’s see what kind of strength you have!”

Qian Hu stood there proudly and raised his head. His gaze was fixed on Wang Xian.

“Haha, you’re Just a freshman. If you can defeat me, then my decades of cultivation would be wasted on a dog!”

A burly young man beside Qian Hu had an axe in his hand.

“He’s too arrogant. Let’s teach this kid a lesson!”

“That’s right. If he wants to be our leader, bring out your strength. Otherwise, go home and suck on his milk!”

Some of the young men behind him shouted loudly with disgruntlement.

“He’s courting death!”

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

As the students shouted and Xia houming and some amethyst female students looked at him sympathetically, the lightning struck wood in Wang Xian’s hand fell to the ground.

In an instant, thorns appeared beneath Qian Hu and the other ten or so students.

The thorns came out from the ground and twined around them.

“Eh?”

Qian Hu’s expression changed slightly as a black glow emerged from his body. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“What?”

“Not good!”

However, before they could react, Qian Hu and the rest were tied up by the thorns.

Under everyone’s shocked gazes, the brambles slammed them heavily onto the ground.

“Bang!”

The intense sound actually caused Qian Hu and the others to not stand up for a moment.

The voices of dissatisfaction instantly disappeared.

The surroundings were completely silent. The group of people widened their eyes and their faces were filled with disbelief.
