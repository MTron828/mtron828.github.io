Chapter 1143: The reward of 1,144 days’worth

Translator: 5496903

Wang Xian’s inheritance was extremely terrifying, and the increase in his speed was also shocking.

However, his current strength had yet to reach the insightful emptiness realm. In Feng Luan’s opinion, he couldn’t be considered a powerhouse if he had yet to reach the insightful emptiness realm.

Furthermore, Wang Xian had entered the interior from the butt of the sculpture. When she saw it, she was speechless.

In the Hundred Beasts City, even the group of insightful emptiness realm experts didn’t gain much. It was normal if Wang Xian didn’t gain anything.

“Just a little bit!”

When Wang Xian heard Feng Luan’s words, he smiled faintly and the corners of his mouth curled up slightly.

“Just a little bit!”

When he thought of his gains, Wang Xian didn’t remember them clearly.

“Just a little bit is good enough!”

Feng Luan nodded her head faintly. “It wasn’t a waste of time!”

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded his head. He thought of the ice fire civet cat in the storage spiritual bag and looked inside.

At this moment, the ice fire civet cat was jumping around in the storage spiritual bag. It was very active and made rapid sounds. Clearly, it was very afraid in this pitch-black and unfamiliar space.

Feng Luan poured some tea for herself and took out a book to read.

Wang Xian had a thought and the ice fire civet cat appeared beside him.

“Meow!”

Upon seeing Wang Xian, the ice fire civet cat let out an excited cry and pounced on him.

“Don’t lick me! Don’t Lick Me!”

Wang Xian patted the head of the ice fire civet cat to stop it from being mischievous.

“Meow, Meow!”

The ice fire civet cat meowed and jumped onto his shoulder.

“Huh?”

Feng Luan, who was drinking tea at the side, was slightly stunned. She immediately looked at the ice fire civet cat with a stunned expression.

“How did this cat appear? It...”

Feng Luan widened her eyes slightly. Her eyes were filled with shock as she sized up the ice fire civet cat in astonishment.

“It’s a little fellow that I obtained from the Hundred Beasts City!”

Wang Xian smiled. “How is it? Not Bad, right? This ice fire civet cat’s bloodline is not simple!”

“It’s not just not simple!” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Feng Luan’s eyes flickered slightly. “Dual attributes of ice and fire. A rare dual attribute. It might even be able to stand at the peak of the transcendence continent!”

“Is that why you said that your harvest is average?”

Feng Luan thought of how it was good for her to have a harvest and rolled her eyes at him.

“Oh right, where did you hide the ice and fire civet cat?”

Following that, she asked curiously.

“Spirit storage bag, a space that can store living things!”

Wang Xian explained with a smile.

“Spirit Storage Bag?”

Feng Luan looked at it and felt a little envious. “I’m really envious of your inheritance!”

Wang Xian looked at her and smiled. “I want to see what I Got Tonight!”

“HMM? You got something else?”

Feng Luan looked over in surprise.

Wang Xian shrugged his shoulders and waved his arm. Five pet eggs were placed on the ground. “These are your five pet eggs!”

Feng Luan looked at him and then at him.

“Bang, Bang, Bang...”

Following that, Wang Xian waved his arm again and one pet egg after another landed on the ground.

One, two, three, four...

One pet egg after another appeared on the ground. Feng Luan, who was at the side, was slightly surprised. However, she soon opened her mouth slightly. Her mouth was filled with shock and was exceptionally cute.

“Thirty-one, there are eighteen extraordinary seventh level, seven eighth level, four ninth level, and only two half-step void interpretation level ones. It’s a pity that there aren’t any void interpretation level ones!”

Wang Xian shook his head regretfully.

“You...”

Feng Luan looked at him and then looked at the pet eggs on the ground. She choked slightly. The current her was no longer the former empress. With so many pet eggs placed here, it was still a shock to her.

With so many pet eggs, it was comparable to the half-step void interpretation demonic beast bloodline of Wang Xian!

It was worth 50 to 60 billion middle-grade spirit stones!

In comparison, it was nothing for her to obtain five pet eggs?

“Is this your so-called little harvest?”

Feng Luan glared at him.

“Yes, this is just a little harvest!”

Wang Xian looked at her and nodded his head with a serious expression. “I still have more!”

As he spoke, he kept the pet eggs into his spirit pouch. With a wave of his arm, the bloodlines of ferocious beasts and demonic beasts appeared before his eyes.

There were three bloodlines at level eight of the supernatural realm!

Two at level nine of the supernatural realm!

One at half-step to the void interpretation realm!

One at level one of the void interpretation realm!

With six bloodlines, every single one of them could cause a bloodbath in bright moon city. The most terrifying one was the bloodline at level one of the void interpretation realm.

Such an item was considered the best item even in the empire. Since when was this item so worthless?

The last time, Wang Xian had given her a demonic beast bloodline of the second level of the void interpretation realm. Now, he was giving her another one?

Why was it so common to have a bloodline of the void interpretation realm?

“Did you get all the treasures in the Hundred Beasts City?”

Feng Luan stood up and stared at these bloodlines with sparkling eyes. The value of these items was terrifying.

The main reason why she came here this time was to obtain some treasures and prepare for the next development of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire.

“No!”

Wang Xian shook his head speechlessly when he heard her words. Then, he slowly took out another bloodline.

“The bloodline of the tarsal bone demonic beast, level six of the Seeping Void!”

“This is considered the most precious one. Oh, there’s also the inheritance of the Beast Tamer!”

Wang Xian said to her indifferently.

“This... you... you...”

When Feng Luan saw the bloodline of the Level Six Seeping Void Demonic Beast, she was slightly excited.

Even though she was the former empress, her breathing quickened when she saw the Demon Beast bloodline.

“You... Do you know what the Level Six Demon Beast bloodline of the Void interpretation means?”

She took a deep breath, staring at Wang Xian, she said, “The Fire Cloud Sparrow clan’s bloodline was at level eight of the void interpretation. I upgraded it to level nine of the void interpretation. With my help, Xiao Yun rose another level. Now, the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan is a top-tier Clan!”

“A clan with a level six Seethrough bloodline will be conferred as a prince’s clan in the Empire!”

“The value of this is too high. It’s so high that the sale of a level six Seethrough bloodline in the transcendence continent hasn’t happened more than five times in the past ten thousand years!”

Feng Luan spoke a lot.

“Is that so? Does that mean we don’t have the qualifications to sell it with our strength? It doesn’t matter. I’m not prepared to sell it either. I’m prepared to give it away!”

Wang Xian smiled. “This is all my gains from the Hundred Beasts City. It’s not bad!”

Not Bad?

When Feng Luan heard his words again, the corner of her mouth twitched.

She glared at Wang Xian. You call your gains not bad?

It was obvious that he was mocking her for saying that his gains were not bad at all.

This was not only not bad, it was a huge gain.

One was the pup of a Void Interpretation Demon Beast, one had the bloodline of a level one void interpretation demon beast, and one had the bloodline of a level six void interpretation demon beast.

If the other six void interpretation experts knew about this, they would definitely fight him to the death.

If this item did not belong to Wang Xian, even Feng Luan herself would have to consider whether to snatch it.

It was not an exaggeration to say that the value of these items added up could not even be compared to ten dragon and Phoenix cities.

In fact, the entire star-moon dynasty could not compare.
