“There’s a powerhouse responding to us? which force is it?”

In the Endless Abyss in front of the planet occupied by the Dragon Python group, seven to eight million disciples were fighting with a group of abyss seeds!

The entire abyss seed was full of broken bodies. Broken Arms, legs, and even heads were floating in the battlefield!

Compared to the Beichuan sect, this place was even more tragic. There were over a million corpses of the abyss seed!

This was even after most of the corpses were directly devoured by the abyssal seed!

In a short half an hour of battle, the Dragon Python group had lost two to three million people!

In the sky, the four elders of the Dragon Python group each held a shield in their hands. The Divine Dragon coiled around the shield, and one look was enough to tell that it was extraordinary!

“Peng Peng Peng!”

In front, an incomparably huge pitch-black tail swept over and struck the shield of an elder!

The old man was instantly sent flying backwards, blood flowing out of his mouth, his face pale!

“There’s a response, which organization’s Warrior is it?”

The top 4 of the Dragon Python group relied on their dragon Python shield to defend against the attacks of the 8 undying level 8 abyss species!

If not for this dragon Python Shield, their dragon Python group’s greatest treasure and trump card, they would have been killed long ago!

Even so, the four of them were pale, they couldn’t hold on much longer!

After all, they had eight undying level 8 abyss species on their side!

“I don’t know, this voice sounds a little young? Are they from the great cult from last month?”

An elder beside growled with a dark expression, the dragon pythons intertwined on the shield, blocking the terrifying attacks!

“No matter who it is, as long as someone comes to help, they will be the benefactor of our dragon Python group. We should not place our hopes on others. Block them, block them!”

An old man dressed in yellow dragon python clothing growled in a grave manner. His body was filled with dignity!

These four people were the strongest experts of the factions that had stood in this starry sky for tens of millions of years. A single look from them could cause some people to suffocate!

“If the newcomer is too weak, who knows how many of our disciples will be left after the battle!” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

An old man said with an incomparably ugly expression!

The losses were too great!

“Boom Boom Boom!”

At the same time, in front of the many planets in the Northern line, Dragon Peak flew towards the right at a terrifying speed!

They did not directly rush over from the abyssal seed, because their strength was not enough!

“Boom Boom Boom!”

When they passed by the center of last month’s sect planet, an even more terrifying sound came from the abyss beside them!

Wang Xian looked over and saw five figures engaged in a vast battle!

On the Command Board of Dragon Peak, there were five black dots. This meant that there were five immortal King Level 9 existences!

Among them, there were three level 9 immortal king level experts from the great sect last month. As for whether they were stronger, no one knew!

The battle between Level 9 immortal king level experts was even more shocking. The range of the battle spread to hundreds of millions of kilometers!

Just the aftershocks of this battle could destroy some stars!

“After this battle, the Dragon Palace will be able to give birth to level 9 immortal king level experts!”

Wang Xian’s gaze swept across as his eyes sparkled!

“Dragon King, the location of the Dragon Python group is right in front of us!”

After flying at full speed for 15 minutes, Dragon Mountain arrived in front of a planet!

He looked at the abyss seed in front of him as his eyes sparkled!

It was too tragic. Too many people had died!

There were more abyss seeds here than at Bei Chuan sect!

“Everyone from the Dragon Python Group, Our Dragon Palace is here to provide support!”

Dragon Mountain came to the front of the planet of the Dragon Python group and charged straight into the abyss!

Wang Xian swept his gaze across and shouted softly!

“Dragon Palace!”

“Dragon Palace? The power of the Master of the Frost Goddess. Good, good. The Dragon Palace has the ability to kill an undying king level 8!”

Four old men holding dragon python shields looked excited when they saw Dragon Mountain coming over!

The Dragon Palace had the record of killing an undying level 8 abyssal seed!

“Thank You Dragon King for your support, Our Dragon Python group is extremely grateful, please help us block these 8 abyssal seeds!”

“As long as we block them for half an hour, we should be able to get through this crisis!”

A top warrior from the Dragon Python group said!

“Don’t worry, since we’re here, we can easily block and kill these abyssal seeds!”

Tian Cheng replied indifferently and Dragon Peak soon arrived at the battlefield!

“Huh?”

...

Everyone in the Dragon Python group was slightly shocked when they heard Tian Cheng’s words!

“We only need the powerhouses of the Dragon Palace to help us block a few of them!”

An elder of the Dragon Python group couldn’t help but say!

“Kill!”

However, as soon as he finished his words, the order of the sky array was given!

Before Dragon Peak entered the battlefield, numerous arrows shot towards the abyss seeds in front of him!

“Fiery golden sword, Attack!”

The abyss seeds in front of him were densely packed, and the Fire Hammer clan also launched an attack instantly!

More than 1,000 divine weapons shot out fiery golden swords, and a terrifying attack rushed into the battlefield!

“Ice Dragon Crack!”

Northern Frost floated directly above the Dragon Peak. With a wave of his arm, an ice dragon condensed from frost directly attacked in front of him!

...

“Crack Crack Crack!”

It flew to the center of the abyssal seeds and let out an explosive sound!

“Bang!”

Then, countless frost shot out in all directions and instantly pierced through the abyssal seeds!

“So powerful, the powerhouses of the Dragon Palace are so powerful!”

“Goddess of Frost, the goddess of frost is also here!”!

“Thank you for the attack of the Dragon Palace, thank you all!”

When the first round of attacks from the Dragon Palace arrived, everyone from the Dragon Python group was slightly shocked, followed by excitement in their eyes!

Some of the disciples of the Dragon Python group were so excited that their bodies trembled!

It was too timely!

Tens of thousands of disciples of the Dragon Python group were dying every minute. Now that the experts of the Dragon Palace had arrived, they had killed over a million abyss species in a round of attacks!

This allowed the Dragon Python group to save a lot of lives!

Some of the higher-ups of the Dragon Python group were also full of gratitude!

After all, these people who had died were their disciples and their relatives!

“Hahaha, thank you for your help, Dragon Palace. In the future, with just a word from you, Dragon King, Our Dragon Python group can fight for the Dragon Palace!”

When the four pinnacle powerhouses of the Dragon Python group saw this scene, their eyes were filled with excitement!

“Hehe, everyone from the Dragon Python group, we are fighting for the abyssal seed. The abyssal seed that we kill next belongs to us!”

Wang Xian smiled faintly. His eyes were sparkling as he stared at the Eight Immortal King level eight abyss seeds above him!

“Everyone, let’s join hands and kill those eight beasts!”

He shouted softly!

Boom Boom Boom

Long Feng charged straight into the center of the battlefield. There were array compasses placed in front of the Heaven Array!

Huala

Bei Shuang leaped up high and floated beside the four elders!

Wang Xian flew over as well!

“What? He destroyed eight level eight abyssal seeds?”

The four top-notch experts of the dragon Python group were slightly shocked!
