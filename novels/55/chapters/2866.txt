Chapter 2867: Under the shock of the eight desolate six directions

The establishment of the eight desolate six directions was the shortest among the seven great factions in the resplendent starry sky.

They were not sect-style, nor were they family-style.

They were established by experts who entered the eight desolate six directions in search of opportunities.

The original intention of the eight desolate six directions was to occupy more resources and treasures in the eight desolate six directions.

Later on, he became a powerful existence.

The death of God Emperor Wind Destruction did not make them feel sad or sad.

This was because God emperor wind destruction was not related to them by blood, nor did he have deep feelings for them.

But because of this, they should speak up for God Emperor Wind Destruction.

If God emperor wind destruction was killed without any consequences this time, then what if it was their turn to be killed in the future? Would that be the case?

Would no one avenge them?

This was something that all the god-emperors had to consider.

A Fox would mourn the death of a rabbit.

However, if they wanted to take revenge, they had to face the Dragon Palace.

They had long understood the strength of the Dragon Palace. When they were pushed to the fourth place in the rankings, they had some understanding of the Dragon Palace.

After resisting the attacks of the imperial court and the formed Wizard Association, the Imperial Court and the formed Wizard Association had two rank two void God emperor experts.

This was especially so for the Wizards of the formed Wizard Association. Their strength was nearly invincible among the rank two void God emperor experts.

Even under such circumstances, they were unable to defeat the Dragon Palace. The strength of the Dragon Palace could be seen from this.

“With our strength, if we were to really fight, we wouldn’t be a match for the Dragon Palace.”

An old man on the right revealed a contemplative expression as he said with a solemn expression.

“We don’t have a powerful array master among us, nor do we have such a precious treasure. Even if the Dragon King is currently here with us, it would be very difficult for us to kill him.”

Another old man said with a frown.

Only powerful array masters could seal an area of space.

The sky array could do it, and so could the witch formation society.

Powerful factions would have a space-locking supreme treasure that could also do it.

However, they did not have such a treasure in the eight desolates.

If they could not keep the Dragon King, they could escape easily. After that, they could take revenge on them.

Once all the Divine Emperors of the Dragon Palace came, it would be very difficult for the eight barrens to resist.

“If you want to take revenge for wind destruction, there is only one way.”

At this moment, the old man who was riding on the divine deer spoke.

As he spoke, everyone around looked over with a hint of respect in their eyes.

This old man was the founder of the eight Barrens and was known as the desolate divine emperor.

“He’s Here!”

Suddenly, the desolate god Emperor changed the topic and revealed a faint smile as he looked outside.

“Oh?”

The god Emperors revealed looks of surprise as they looked ahead.

“Reporting to the desolate god Emperor, a god Emperor from the imperial court is here to pay a visit!”

A desolate god Emperor came over and reported respectfully.

“Imperial Court!” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

In the Great Hall, the eyes of the godly monarchs flashed.

“And the Magus Union.”

They looked at each other and a smile appeared on the face of the eight barrens godly monarch.

“Get that godly monarch from the imperial court over here!”

The desolate godly monarch ordered his subordinates.

“Yes!”

The Guardian who came to report immediately flew out.

“Greetings, desolate godly monarch.”

Soon, an old man entered the Great Hall. His gaze swept across the Great Hall and a smile appeared on his face.

“This should be divine emperor Shenwu. Please take a seat!”

The godly emperor of desolation looked at the Godly Emperor Shenwu and smiled.

“Thank you, godly emperor of Desolation!”

The Godly Emperor Shenwu cupped his hands and sat on the seat beside him.

“What brings you here today, Godly Emperor Shenwu?”

The godly emperor of desolation looked at him and asked calmly.

“Godly emperor of desolation, I’ll get straight to the point. I’ve reported the conflict between the eight barrens and the Dragon Palace to our monarch and the Wizards. Now, I can represent the imperial court and the Witch Formation Association.”

“My Lord, you can also guess why I’m here. The enemy of my enemy is my friend. The Dragon Palace is so arrogant and doesn’t care about the eight barrens, and our imperial court and the Witch Formation Association have a deep hatred for each other. I’m here to represent the imperial court and the Witch Formation Association and hope to form an alliance with the eight barrens to deal with the Dragon Palace.”

The monarch, Shenwu, said directly.

“We have not reached the point where we will fight to the death with the Dragon Palace!”

The barren divine emperor looked at him, pondered for a moment, and said.

“Lord Barren Divine Emperor, it is already very excessive for the Dragon King to directly order his subordinates to kill an eight desolation divine emperor.”

Divine emperor Shen Wu frowned slightly when he heard this and said.

“We need to discuss the matter of joining forces with you!”

The barren divine emperor said indifferently.

“This… alright. As long as bhang agrees, the imperial court and the Witch Formation Association will welcome bhang to join us at any time.”

Divine Emperor Shenwu stood up, frowned, cupped his hands, and flew out.

“Lord Barren Divine Emperor, why don’t we agree to it directly?”

Seeing the imperial court’s divine emperor leave, a divine emperor asked with a twinkle in his eyes.

“Once we join their alliance, it means that we have become a great enemy of the Dragon Palace. There may be no room for us to turn back.”

The desolate celestial emperor was deep in thought.

“You guys go and check the location of the Dragon King. Ask the Dragon Palace to give us an explanation for the matter of the wind destruction celestial emperor.”

He turned his head and said to the surrounding celestial emperors.

“Great desolate divine emperor, what if the Dragon King doesn’t know what’s good for him?”

A divine emperor asked with a twinkle in his eyes.

“If he doesn’t know what’s good for him, then we must give the eight desolate disciples and the dead divine emperor of wind destruction an explanation.”

As the desolate divine emperor spoke, his eyes flashed with a cold expression.

“Yes!”

The group of divine emperors nodded.

“Order the disciples to find the current location of the Dragon King. Also, announce that the Dragon Palace’s Dragon King has destroyed my eight desolate divine emperor. We must give him an explanation!”

The desolate celestial emperor’s voice sounded in the hall as his figure disappeared.

The other celestial emperors stood up as their bodies emitted cold auras.

The Dragon Palace had destroyed their eight desolation celestial emperor. There must be an explanation.

Otherwise, where would their eight Desolation’s face be?

How would their eight desolation disciples view their faction!

“Boom!”

“There’s news from the eight desolation. The death of the wind destruction celestial emperor and the death of the eight desolation disciples must be given an explanation!”

“They killed a divine emperor. It would be embarrassing if the eight barrens didn’t do anything. As expected, the eight barrens have made a statement!”

“As the pillar of a faction, it’s impossible to kill a divine emperor so easily. If the Dragon Palace doesn’t give the eight barrens a satisfactory explanation, there will probably be a conflict!”

Not long after, a statement from the eight barrens came from the communication network.

The statement only had a short line of words: Dragon King of the Dragon Palace has destroyed my bhang celestial emperor. He must give an explanation!

This line of words was not threatening, but it also indicated bhang’s decision.

Give an explanation!
