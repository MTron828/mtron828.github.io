Chapter 1595: 1595. If he didn’t go crazy, he wouldn’t be able to survive

“You... Boss Devil, are you crazy? Are you confident that you will die? This... this...”

When the old man heard Wang Xian’s words, he felt as though he had a million curses in his heart.

Confident that he would die?

There was actually someone who was confident that he would die? What the F * ck?

Was there something wrong with his brain?

He was a lunatic!

The Old Man’s face was extremely dark as he stared at Wang Xian. His heart was filled with anger but he didn’t dare to get angry.

You should be prepared for certain death. I Don’t want to Die!

“Don’t worry, I Won’t let you die. You are still useful!”

Wang Xian looked at the stooped old man’s uncertain expression and revealed a faint smile.

Anyone who heard Wang Xian’s words would feel crazy.

However, if one didn’t go crazy, one wouldn’t be able to survive.

“It’s not certain if you will die. What if you survive?”

Wang Xian smiled as his eyes sparkled.

With a move of his palm, a bright ball of light appeared in his hand. The ball of light contained extremely terrifying spiritual energy.

Myriad origin spirit: Level One longevity

The spiritual energy contained in it was equivalent to level one longevity!

This treasure was found in the land of formations of the Bingxin Empire. All the formations in the bingxin imperial city relied on this myriad origin spirit to provide energy.

“Exchange for a violent blood pill!”

Wang Xian checked the treasury in the system and a violent blood pill appeared in his hand.

Violent Blood Pill: level eight void interpretation

By burning his flesh and blood, he could unleash a combat strength that exceeded his own strength.

With the current resources in Wang Xian’s hands, it was not enough to increase his strength. In that case, he could only use another way to increase his strength.

Wang Xian rarely used the treasury in the system because the items that he needed to exchange for were too high in dragon energy. It was not worth it.

The core of the invincible divine dragon nurturing system was the word ‘nurture’.

The path of invincibility required one to be grounded. By relying on the various functions of the system, one was destined to not be able to stand at the peak.

However, there were some items that Wang Xian still needed to exchange for.

“Next, I will expel the dark soul in your body!”

Wang Xian looked at the two items in his hands and said to the hunchbacked old man.

“Boss... Boss Demon, why do I have a bad feeling!” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

The stooped old man looked at Wang Xian and gulped.

“Don’t be afraid. Don’t worry. I Won’t hurt you. I still need to rely on your strength to save Jian ‘er!”

“However, I can’t trust you. Therefore, I can only use another method to restrain you!”

“After the deed is done, I will let you leave and I won’t restrain you!”

“Do you agree or not?”

Wang Xian asked the hunchbacked old man.

“Do I have any other choice?”

The hunchbacked old man said with a dark face when he heard Wang Xian’s words.

“No!”

Wang Xian smiled. He moved his palm slightly and slowly grabbed towards his chest.

“What are you...”

“PFFT! PFFT!”

“Madman, Madman, What are you doing? What the F * ck!”

When the old man saw Wang Xian directly grabbing towards his heart with his arm, he revealed an astonished expression.

He widened his eyes and stared at Wang Xian in disbelief.

“It’s Alright, don’t Worry!”

Wang Xian smiled. Under the old man’s F * cking gaze, he took out a heart of light and darkness!

“This... This is... This is the reason why you can use light and darkness?”

Although the stooped old man was in shock, when he saw the beating heart of darkness.

The abyss-like darkness and the Holy Hall-like light made him widen his eyes and tremble.

“That’s right, this is my heart of Light and darkness. Come, I’ll Lend You My Heart!”

Wang Xian placed the myriad origin spirit in his hand at the location of his heart. In an instant, waves of powerful spiritual energy filled his entire body.

It made him feel that his entire body was filled with strength.

The wound on his chest was slowly healing. The heart of Light and darkness was beating in his hand.

“Lend, lend me your heart? Gulp!”

The stooped old man was completely dumbfounded.

He had lived for more than three thousand years, but this was the first time he had encountered such a strange and crazy thing.

He directly dug out his own heart and lent it to me?

This... This... This was still the world he knew in the past.

“The heart of Light and darkness can replace your heart. It can expel the soul of darkness in your body. It is also a way for me to restrain you!”

Wang Xian said to the old man and slowly stretched out his arm. “Come, give me your heart!”

“Damn it, damn it!”

The hunchbacked old man’s forehead was filled with cold sweat when he saw Wang Xian’s crazed look.

The heart and the head were vital parts to a void interpretation stage powerhouse.

Only a longevity stage powerhouse whose head was still intact after his heart was blown off could survive.

Now, Wang Xian wanted him to take out his heart? That was too crazy.

“Don’t worry, if I wanted you to die, you would have died a long time ago!”

Wang Xian moved his palm slightly and the aura of the hunchbacked old man changed instantly.

The suppressed darkness soul started to riot again.

“Alright, Alright, Alright. I agree, I agree!”

Sensing the riot of the Darkness Soul in his body, he shouted hurriedly.

He was the fish and others were the butcher. He had no choice but to agree.

“Boss Mo, be gentle. I don’t want to die yet!”

The stooped old man closed his eyes as if he was about to be raped.

Wang Xian smiled. He moved his arm and grabbed at the stooped old man’s heart.

The stooped old man trembled and didn’t dare to move.

“Puchi!”

Wang Xian grabbed the stooped old man’s heart directly. At the same time, he placed the heart of Light and darkness on the stooped Old Man’s heart.

Following that, he moved his arm and waves of green dragon energy wrapped around the stooped old man’s heart and threw it into the storage spiritual bag.

Then, he threw the light and dark dragon balls into the old man’s body.

“Hiss!”

“Boom!”

The old man sucked in a breath of cold air. Then, a terrifying aura spread out from his body.

The Soul of darkness hidden in his body revealed a terrified expression the moment the heart of Light and darkness entered his body.

The Dark Dragon Balls directly swallowed it.

His injuries recovered, and his aura rose.

The stooped old man suddenly opened his eyes, and a black light shot out from his turbid eyes. The black light landed in front of him, and half of the room instantly melted.

“Jie Jie, Jie Jie Jie, I, Mo Sha, have returned. Jie Jie, Jie Jie!”

As he felt the terrifying demonic power circulating within his body, a ferocious expression appeared on his face.

He felt that the current him was even more terrifying than when he was at his peak.

“Wang Xian, feel my current strength. Is It...”

“Ahhhh!”

He turned his head and stared at Wang Xian as he spoke with an unruly expression.

However, before he could finish his sentence, an extremely pained expression appeared on his face.

This pained expression was akin to a thousand demons devouring one’s heart!

“Stop acting tough. Your Heart is in my hands. Furthermore, the heart in your body is mine. With just a thought from me, you will die!”

Wang Xian said faintly to him.

“Yes, yes. I couldn’t help but want to act tough. Boss MO, Please Don’t blame me!”

The hunchbacked old man quickly gave in. He knew that he had gotten carried away!
