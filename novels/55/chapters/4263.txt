Boom

A violent explosion rang out.

Wang Xian’s terrifying dragon tail and the dragon tail that was shining with nine-colored radiance collided heavily into the Void Pagoda.

Crack! Crack

Terrifying cracks appeared on the entire powerful Void Pagoda in an instant.

After all, Xining Kung’s void pagoda had not reached the level of the ultimate treasure of Tianyuan.

Although it was powerful, it could not withstand the full-force attack of an expert at the level of Wang Xian’s Great Dao.

“Not good!”

“The strength of the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace is too terrifying!”

Duke Xining was located in the Void Pagoda. When the terrifying energy entered it, his expression changed drastically. His body suffered a huge impact!

“Pu!”

He spat out a mouthful of blood. With a move, he flew out of the Void Pagoda.

Crack! Crack! Crack

At this moment, Wang Xian’s dragon tail engulfed the entire void pagoda.

The gigantic void pagoda began to change its shape and collapse completely under the influence of his dragon tail!

Wang Xian swung his dragon tail and the Void Pagoda flew into the distance.

“The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace is very powerful. I can’t defend against him at all!”

Lord Xining was shocked and shouted loudly!

They had underestimated the Dragon King’s strength.

They had underestimated the Dragon Palace’s strength.

With their strength, not to mention holding on for 5 minutes.

Even if they held on for 2 minutes, they wouldn’t be able to do it.

The difference was too big!

They could only escape immediately!

“The king wants us to hold on for 5 minutes, use our trump cards!”

Another void universe country protector shouted with an ugly expression!Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Damn it!”

Duke Xining growled and waved his arm. Feeling a little heartache, he threw out one round ball after another.

The round balls attacked Wang Xian directly.

Wang Xian focused his gaze and sensed that the round balls contained a terrifying energy.

His body trembled and countless wind and thunder powers charged forward!

The wind and thunder powers covered the entire void in an instant.

It enveloped Duke Xining and the rest.

Boom! Boom! Boom

Under the attack of the wind and thunder powers, the balls exploded.

Each explosion created a terrifying mushroom cloud!

However, this terrifying mushroom cloud was completely blocked by Wang Xian’s wind and thunder powers.

“Eh?”

Although Wang Xian managed to block the attacks, he was still a little shocked by the attacks of the balls.

The destructive power of these balls was comparable to that of two powerhouses at the control level.

This was not something that Duke Xining could unleash!

It looked like a technological item!

Wang Xian thought to himself!

Buzz

At this moment, he looked at Duke Xining with a cold expression in his eyes!

“Netherworld Dragon’s pursuit!”

He waved his arm and sent a Dragon Claw towards Duke Xining!

At the same time, his body disappeared instantly!

When Duke Xining saw Wang Xian’s dragon claw attack, his expression changed drastically.

With his strength, he could not withstand any of Wang Xian’s attacks. He could only Dodge.

His body moved and he immediately teleported!

Buzz Buzz

Buzz Buzz

The moment he teleported, Wang Xian’s figure appeared beside him!

A Dragon Claw was clawing at him.

Duke Xining’s expression changed drastically as he revealed a terrified expression.

“Bang!”

The Dragon Claw landed on his body, causing him to be unable to dodge in time!

“Bang!”

His body collapsed immediately.

However, in the next moment, his body started to distort and the surrounding space started to distort as well.

His entire body appeared beside him in an instant.

“Huff! Huff!”

“Huff! Huff!”

He panted heavily and his face was filled with fear.

This time, it was a powerful treasure that he had obtained that allowed him to dodge a fatal blow in an instant!

“Soaring Cloud Dragon!”

When Wang Xian saw that he had dodged his fatal blow, his expression did not change at all.

As an expert at the control level, it was normal for him to have such a treasure!

Wang Yun opened his dragon mouth and a cloud of mist shot out!

It instantly enveloped the entire space!

“Duke Jin Ming, I can’t hold on any longer. If this continues, I’ll be killed. The treasure in my hand will only allow me to hold on for two minutes at most!”

Duke Xi Ning saw the surrounding cloud of mist appear.

His vision was blocked by a huge barrier and he roared with an extremely ugly expression!

“I’m no match for them either. Their strength is comparable to two ordinary control-level experts!”

Duke Jin Ming’s expression also changed drastically as he replied loudly!

He was now facing the Void Dragon Body and Lin Niu, Lan Qingyue, and the others, and was completely no match for them!

“Damn it!”

Duke Xining’s heart sank.

This time, he was prepared to make use of the spatial attribute’s characteristic to dodge the Dragon King’s attack while killing some of the Dragon Palace’s disciples!

However, he didn’t expect this situation!

He couldn’t retaliate at all!

His breathing was rapid, and his body was trembling!

“Roar Roar!”

At this time, a dragon’s roar entered his mind, making his head feel like it was about to explode!

He gritted his teeth and teleported to the back!

“Bang!”

But at this time, a dragon’s tail appeared at the position where he teleported.

It swept towards his body!

It was another fatal attack!

With this attack, Duke Xining felt that he only had a sliver of life left!

He moved his palm, and a dancing fruit was directly thrown into his mouth!

In an instant, the injuries on his body recovered!

“Run, I Can’t face it head-on, I’ll Fight!”

Duke Xining gritted his teeth, and his body began to flicker continuously!

“Peng!”

However, when he blinked twice, he felt an invisible barrier blocking his path.

This made his expression change. With a move of his palm, a dagger appeared in his hand and attacked the barrier!

“Boom!”

Just as he was attacking forward with the dagger in his hand, a fatal attack descended once again!

“Spatial substitute!”

Duke Xining bit down and roared in pain!

“Bang!”

Wang Xian’s attack landed on his body, dissipating his life force rapidly.

However, Duke Xining’s body appeared in the distance again. He held the dagger in his hand and landed heavily in the void in front of him.

The dagger seemed to be able to cut through the void of the universe, directly creating a huge crack.

He hurriedly jumped into the crack!

“Can I escape?”

With a move of his palm, a branch appeared and instantly coiled around Duke Xining’s body.

This was the branch that was the most precious treasure of the Heaven’s origin.

Wang Xian had taken a few of the branches that were the most precious treasure of the Heaven’s origin. After the nurturing of the ancestral tree, they also possessed terrifying strength.

“It’s over!”

The branches wrapped around Duke Xining’s body, causing a hint of despair to appear on his face.

The life-saving treasures in his hands had already been used up.

This time around, he had brought three life-saving treasures with him.

In his opinion, this was sufficient.

If he were to really encounter danger, three was not enough. Perhaps four or five would not be enough.

Therefore, under normal circumstances, he would only bring three life-saving treasures with him.

The rest would stay.

He could not bring all of his trump cards with him. Otherwise, once he died, he would not be able to bear the loss.
