Chapter 1673: The 1673 Eternal Fire Cloud Sparrow clan didn’t give up

“Disciples of the life and Death Pill Workshop, Attack! Target the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan!”

“Disciples of the sacred item forging workshop, Attack! Target the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan!”

After the disciples of the life and Death Pill workshop and the Sacred Item Forging Workshop withdrew from Fengtian City for two days, the two main cities of the two forces gathered again.

This time, it could be said that they had all gathered.

Almost all the insightful emptiness realm experts of the two forces had left for battle.

“The Eternal Fire Lark clan won’t Give Up!”

“Kill them all!”

Furious roars came from the experts and disciples of the two forces, and their faces were filled with excitement and killing intent.

They raised their heads and looked forward. The dazzling divine-like medicine master and weapon master floated in the sky.

The strongest person of the two forces had personally led the two forces into battle!

This time, the two forces were all out.

“Let’s Go!”

The two forces that were second only to the Empire set off from their main cities and flew towards the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan.

The two forces finally gathered at a location of 10,000 kilometers.

A total of 200,000 people, over 10,000 insightful void rank experts!

The remaining 190,000 people were all no less than rank 7 transcendents!

This was the full strength of the two forces.

This strength could easily rule a large area like this vast area.

“Hehe, now all the forces in the world think that our life and Death Pill Workshop and holy item forging workshop’s retreat means that we admit defeat. What a joke!”

The weapon master, who was emitting terrifying fireworks all over his body, revealed a cold expression as he said indifferently to the medicine master.

“That mysterious assassin organization is indeed very strong. It has disrupted some of our plans!”

The medicine master’s eyes flickered as he looked into the distance.

“It is indeed a problem. If they were hired by the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan, it would be easier to deal with them. However, if they are from the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan, it would be a little troublesome. At that time, we will have to deal with them personally for a period of time!”

The weapon master nodded indifferently.

A sudden appearance of an assassin organization completely disrupted their plans.

They originally wanted to waste another half a year with the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan. After the Sacred Fire clan left, they would directly take action.

However, the appearance of the mysterious assassin organization made the two grit their teeth and immediately decided to take action.

Within these two days, after they dealt with the sacred fire clan and the demon God tribe, they immediately led their disciples out in full force.

However, they did not place too much importance on an assassin organization.

At worst, they would personally take action and fight against this assassin organization. Two longevity experts and an assassin organization would fight against each other. There were not many assassin organizations that could withstand this.

The two legions of 200,000 mighty experts quickly flew directly in the direction of the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan.

When the two top experts of the continent, the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop, announced that they would attack the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan.

When they led their legions and left, all the forces on the continent were shocked.

“Didn’t they just leave? Why did they suddenly leave?”

“The tool master and the Medicine Master went out personally. It seems that they are ready to fight the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan this time!”

“With the strength of the two forces, they will suffer heavy losses even if they destroy the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan, right?”

All the forces of different sizes on the transcendent continent were surprised when they heard the news.

However, when they thought about the battle between the two forces, they felt relieved.

All the forces were paying attention to their battle.

This included the losses of the two powerful factions. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

After a year of battle, the two factions had suffered heavy losses.

The Life and Death Pill Workshop and the holy item forging workshop were merchants. They didn’t want to see such losses.

If this continued, it would be a constant loss for them.

Perhaps this was their determination to go all out.

Moreover, some large factions knew that currently, no powerful faction would help the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan.

Even the Sacred Fire clan wouldn’t.

Two longevity experts against one longevity expert had a powerful advantage.

All the factions could predict that a fierce battle would ensue.

“What? Two large factions are rushing towards us!”

The news was quickly transmitted to the fire cloud sparrow race.

After receiving this news, all the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan members had solemn expressions on their faces.

“It’s the patriarch. The news has been confirmed. The two big forces are currently about 100,000 kilometers away from us. The medicine master and Weapon Master are personally leading the Army!”

“They are expected to rush over tomorrow morning!”

Within the Fire Cloud Mountain, all the fire cloud sparrow upper echelons had gathered and reported to Patriarch Feng Yun.

“Are they the only two factions?”

Feng Yun frowned and asked with a solemn expression.

“According to our information, they are the only two factions. We haven’t seen any other factions. There hasn’t been any activity from the Fiendcelestial tribe!”

An elder said.

“Patriarch, the Fiendcelestial tribe was wiped out by young master Wang with a single move. Could it be that the fiendcelestial tribe is pressuring the two factions?”

“Furthermore, they are afraid that young master Wang’s assassin organization will enter their lair and carry out assassinations!”

Queen firecloud guessed.

“It’s possible, but there’s another possibility. The fiendcelestial tribe has been invited by them!”

Patriarch Fengyun said as he prepared for the worst.

“The Fiendcelestial tribe is making a move? There’s no need for the Fiendcelestial tribe to participate in this war, right? Their strength is comparable to the alliance between the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging Workshop!”

A clan elder frowned and guessed.

“Under normal circumstances, if they don’t have a deep grudge against our fire cloud sparrow tribe, there’s no need for them to make a move!”

Feng Yun nodded slowly.

“Order everyone to leave Volcano City and enter the Fire Cloud Mountain Range!”

Feng Yun continued to order, “We have to make a final decision!”

“Yes, Patriarch!”

The fire cloud sparrow elders immediately nodded.

“CHIRP CHIRP CHIRP!”

A Rapid Phoenix cry came from within the fire cloud mountain range.

The fire cloud sparrows that were more than ten meters in size flapped their flaming wings and flew towards the fire cloud city.

Within the Fire Cloud City, there were many clan elders standing.

“All fire cloud sparrow disciples listen up. Bring all your items and retreat to the fire cloud mountain range. Tomorrow morning, prepare for battle!”

A clan elder’s voice enveloped the entire volcano city, causing the entire city to be silent for two seconds.

“Disciples, Listen Up!”

Within the volcano city, many insightful void tier experts were slightly shocked and immediately responded loudly.

“All Disciples, take all your items and prepare to retreat!”

“Retreat to the fire cloud mountain range, prepare to face the enemy tomorrow!”

The profound void martial experts immediately carried out their orders.

At this moment, the faces of all the members of the Fiery Cloud Sparrow clan revealed a shocked expression.

They listened to the orders one after another and were somewhat stunned.
