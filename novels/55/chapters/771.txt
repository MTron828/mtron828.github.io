Translator: 549690339

The first immortal sect disciple competition!

This was a very sensational event for the entire jianghu.

For all the immortal sect disciples, this was a grand event.

There were peerless beauties in Jianghu, and there was a heaven’s pride roll.

However, there wasn’t a ranking on the Heaven’s pride roll. Moreover, everyone wasn’t very clear about the overall strength of an immortal sect disciple.

However, through this immortal sect disciple competition, one could understand the strength of the disciples of the various great immortal sects.

The true ranking of the Prodigy roll!

The overall strength of the disciples of the various great immortal sects!

And even the strength of some immortal sects!

This time, after the emergence of the eight cauldron world, it was the first time that a disciple could truly make a name for himself.

This time, the competition was for the strong, and they could soar to the skies in this competition!

It was a heaven’s chosen who could shine brilliantly in this battle.

As long as they could enter the top 21 of the competition, they would definitely be the most powerful 21 disciples in the entire jianghu.

To those heaven’s chosen and monstrous disciples, this was simply the best competition.

It was a dragon that could truly soar to the nine heavens!

The entire jianghu was in an uproar. All the disciples of the immortal sects were sharpening their blades. There was truly a chance to make a name for themselves. No disciple with ambition and strength would give up on this competition.

On the pugilistic World Online, everyone was discussing the matter of the disciple competition. There were even some who were analyzing the strength of the various prodigies.

All in all, the entire pugilistic world was abnormally lively.

Apart from the reputation gained from the competition, the rewards from the competition also caused everyone to be in an uproar.

“The Xuanyuan clan has taken out the one heaven primordial water as a reward for the prodigy disciples!”

“The Yuwen clan has taken out a level one array spirit gathering formation as a reward for the prodigy disciples!”

“The Holy Medicine Immortal sect has taken out two level seven pills as a reward for the disciples!”

...

Each and every one of them was richly rewarded, especially yesterday, when the Xuanyuan clan announced an important matter for the competition.

Apart from the twenty immortal sects, the Dragon Gate was invited to participate in the immortal sect competition this time.

The Dragon King of the Dragon Gate had custom-made a level thirteen spirit weapon for the Heaven’s chosen. When this news came out, everyone was in an uproar.

A grade-13 spirit weapon. Nowadays, even immortals and gods might not be able to own a grade-13 spirit weapon. The winning heaven’s favorites would be qualified to obtain a grade-13 spirit weapon.

One could imagine how precious it was.

The atmosphere of the entire martial arts world was ignited to the extreme. All the disciples of the immortal sects were filled with fighting spirit.

“Hey, brother, which immortal sect is that over there? There are so many beautiful women!”

Just as they walked out of the small town and Wang Xian and the rest were about to board the airship, a group of people from the immortal sect beside them walked forward.

“Fengyan Immortal sect. Only the Fengyan Immortal sect is filled with women!”

Wang Xian glanced at Xiao Yu and said with a smile.

“No wonder there isn’t a single man. I heard that their immortal sect has a beauty who is the best in terms of beauty. I wonder if she is prettier than her sisters-in-law!”

Xiao Yu looked at them curiously.

Guan Shuqing, Lan Qingyue and the rest smiled and said, “Xiao Yu cares about beauties? I heard that Beauty Xiao Yu saved a handsome guy. I wonder if that handsome guy has given himself to her!”

“Aiya, what Pretty Girl saved a handsome guy? What kind of handsome guy is he? He is far worse than my brother!”

Xiao Yu heard their teasing and blushed slightly. She quickly said.

“Oh, is that so? Our Xiao Yu is not young anymore. Let us keep an eye on you. If you meet a good man, you can marry him. Haha!”

A few girls teased Xiao Yu. This made her pout. She hugged Wang Xian’s arm and said that her sisters-in-law were bullying her.

Wang Xian smiled at the side and said, “If you want to find a boyfriend, I agree. In this competition of the top 20 prodigies of the immortal sects, if there’s anyone you like, tell me. I’ll propose a marriage for you. Haha!”

“Brother, even you are teasing me. I’m ignoring you!”

When Xiao Yu saw that Wang Xian was not defending her, she tugged at his arm angrily.

“Little girl, you’re Not Young Anymore!”

Wang Xian patted her head lovingly.

“HMPH!”

Xiao Yu rolled her eyes at him and pouted her lips without saying another word.

“That is? Dragon King of the Dragon Gate!”

At this moment, a group of people from the Fengyan Celestial sect also saw Wang Xian and the rest.

The two women standing in the middle looked over with a hint of surprise in their eyes.

“According to the information we received, the Dragon Gate has two intermediate immortals, one lower immortal, and fifty to sixty infant stage powerhouses!”

A woman’s eyes flickered as she spoke.

“Indeed, they are all infant realm experts. All of them are following behind him. It seems that the Dragon Gate doesn’t have any ordinary disciples. The weakest one is also an infant realm expert. They should be participating in the grand competition. There are a total of three immortal gods!”

The water-blue staff in the woman’s hand flickered with specks of light.

Each speck of light was different in size.

This was a method of detection.

“It’s better not to provoke such a force. No ordinary disciples means no worries. Besides, the strength of this Dragon Gate can be ranked at the top among all the immortal sects!”

The woman next to her said indifferently.

Cheng Qingcheng and the other disciples of the immortal sects heard the conversation between the two immortal gods and revealed shocked expressions. They looked over and were filled with astonishment.

A faction in the real world was participating in the competition of the disciples of the immortal sects together with the twenty immortal sects. Their strength was so terrifying that many immortal sects were afraid of them.

The young clan leader of the Thunder clan had his limbs cut off. The Thunder clan did not have any reaction to this.

The Dragon Gate could be considered to be walking in the sight of all the immortal sects.

Wang Xian and the rest came to the airship and flew directly in the direction of the Xuan Yuan clan.

This airship was gifted by the puppet immortal sect and was similar to the airship of the innate immortal sect.

The location where the Xuan Yuan cauldron appeared was not far from Shangjing. The Xuan Yuan clan and the Yuwen clan were the two great immortal sects within the sect.

The Xuan Yuan clan and the Yuwen clan were also ranked in the top five among all the immortal sects. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The Immortal sect disciple competition this time was held within the Xuan Yuan clan.

The ancient immortal sects and clans liked to place their foundations in the mountains, and the Xuan Yuan clan was no exception.

The airship arrived in the sky above a group of mountains. The mountain stream was filled with the chirping of cranes and the chirping of apes. It was filled with an ancient charm.

“May I know which Immortal sect is here? Welcome!”

A voice was heard. Following that, a figure stood on the spirit sword and shouted at Wang Xian and the rest on the airship.

“Dragon Gate!”

Wang Xian looked at the half-step immortal god Powerhouse of the Xuanyuan clan and said in a deep voice.

“So it’s Dragon Gate. You must be the Dragon King. Please follow me!”

The middle-aged man bowed to Wang Xian and guided him.

“Sorry for the trouble!”

Wang Xian nodded. The airship landed on a huge square under the middle-aged man’s guidance.

At this moment, there were already quite a number of airships in the square. There were also people from other immortal sects around them.

“Dragon King, we have already arranged a mountain peak for all of you to live on. Please!”

The middle-aged man from the Xuan Yuan clan gestured to Wang Xian.

“Okay!”

Wang Xian nodded his head. Everyone followed behind the middle-aged man and walked forward.

“Dragon King, this is the mountain peak where you live at Dragon Gate. The rooms inside are sufficient for all of you to live in!”

The middle-aged man said to Wang Xian respectfully.

Wang Xian came to participate in this competition as a big shot.

A top-notch powerhouse who was on equal footing with the twenty immortal sects. The Xuan Yuan clan didn’t dare to be the slightest bit negligent!
