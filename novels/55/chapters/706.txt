“Old Wang, you’ve been gone for more than a year. I missed you so much!”

“I thought Old Wang had forgotten about a nobody like me. Hehe, we must get drunk tonight!”

“Old Wang, let’s go to the class and take a look. It seems to be a public class today. Our classmates are not gathered together!”

Wang Dahai said to Wang Xian excitedly.

He knew Wang Xian’s identity. The overlord of the martial arts world a year ago, the Dragon King of the Dragon Gate, was actually his brother.

He was very excited just thinking about it.

“Where are our counselors? Are they bringing US along?”

Wang Xian asked Wang Dahai with a smile on his face.

“No need. Our counselors have gone to be civil servants. Zhang Feng and Zhang Wen have also dropped out of school and joined the Puppet Immortal Sect!”

Wang Dahai said to Wang Xian.

“Oh? Why did they join the Puppet Immortal Sect?”

Wang Xian revealed a surprised expression. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Old Wang, I know about the spiritual energy waterfall a year ago. After that, I told Zhang Feng and Zhang Wen about it. Later on, we were lucky and built our foundation under a spiritual energy waterfall. After the spiritual energy waterfall was washed away, our cultivation speed was very fast. Now, I have joined the Mingwang Immortal sect. However, as there are disciples of the immortal sect studying in our Jiang City University, the warden of the Immortal sect sent me to follow these disciples and recruit some disciples with potential!”

Wang Dahai explained to him.

Wang Xian nodded his head. Currently, the martial arts practitioners who had undergone the baptism of the spiritual energy waterfall had a physique that far surpassed those in the nine cauldrons world due to the impact of the huge amount of spiritual energy.

Therefore, those immortal sects would take them in as their disciples.

As the disciples of the immortal sects wanted to integrate into the world, there would be a situation where the disciples of the immortal sects would go to university.

“By the way, where is your girlfriend, Su Qian?”

Wang Xian asked her with a smile.

“She is also in school. She joined the Mingwang Celestial sect with me. Yuan Yuanyuan also joined. At that time, the spiritual waterfall of shunding was not too far away from us. Many people had entered the spiritual waterfall. However, many of them did not stay for long before they were controlled by the martial arts practitioners of the past. Without the ability, they would not be able to enter the spiritual waterfall!”

As Wang Dahai spoke, he puffed out his chest and said, “Boss, what do you think of Me Now? A fighter of level eight will be able to step into the Xiantian realm in five years at most!”

“You are still too weak!”

Wang Xian shook his head. He waved his arm and landed it on Wang Dahai’s chest.

Before he could react, he felt a terrifying energy entering his body directly.

The eight extraordinary meridians were opened in an instant. A martial artist was at level nine, half-step into the Xiantian realm, and the Xiantian realm!

In just a short instant, Wang Dahai’s cultivation base was elevated to the Xiantian realm.

Wang Dahai was stunned. Following that, his face turned red. He quickly hugged Wang Xian’s arm and said, “F * CK, F * CK, Boss, you are my boss for Life!”

“Get lost. I didn’t plan to teach you before you stepped into martial arts. Now that you have embarked on this path, I can only help you up to this point!”

Wang Xian pushed his arm away. A smile appeared on his face before he threw a porcelain bottle to him.

“There are some elixirs in there. It’s enough for you to advance to the Dan Stage. I will give it to You Then!”

He said faintly, “Let’s go for a walk. Let’s have dinner together tonight!”

“Alright!”

Wang Dahai nodded excitedly. He asked with anticipation, “Boss, how strong are you now? Are you as strong as the immortals from the immortal sects?”

“What do you think?”

Wang Xian smiled and didn’t answer. He looked around with a smile.

“Hehe, Hehe, even if you aren’t that strong, you are at least an infant stage powerhouse. With your subordinates, you are still very strong!”

Wang Dahai didn’t dare to imagine that Wang Xian was as strong as the immortals. He smiled foolishly.

Buzz! Buzz

At this moment, Wang Dahai’s phone rang.

“Wang Dahai, come back immediately!”

As soon as Wang Dahai said that, the other party immediately hung up the phone. Wang Dahai’s face was filled with helplessness.

“What’s Wrong?”

When Wang Xian heard the voice on his phone, he asked curiously.

“Senior sister from the Celestial sect, she asked me to rush over. Isn’t school just starting? There’s a batch of new students. There are dozens of martial artists who know how to cultivate. They joined the school’s martial arts club. As long as they can reach the level of a martial artist above LV 8, they are qualified to join the celestial sect. The martial arts club can be considered a small place for the celestial sect to select disciples.”

Wang Dahai explained to Wang Xian with a bitter face.

“Oh, is that so? Come, Let’s go and take a look!”

Wang Xian was slightly interested and said immediately.

“Alright, let’s hurry over then. If we are late, we will have to face her arrogant face again!”

As Wang Dahai spoke, he quickened his pace and walked towards the martial arts club. Wang Xian followed by the side with a smile on his face.

The martial arts club was now in a single large room. The entire room was the size of a playground. It was obvious that it had just been built not long ago.

In the martial arts club, there were about two hundred people gathered inside.

At the center, there were three to four young men standing there.

“Senior sister!”

Wang Dahai walked in and shouted at a girl in the center.

“En!”

The girl took a glance at her and didn’t say anything else.

“Eh, student Wang Xian!”

“Senior Wang Xian!”

“It’s really senior Wang Xian!”

At this moment, surprised voices came from the surroundings.

Wang Xian was slightly stunned. He looked around and found that he didn’t know anyone other than Su Qian and Yuan Yuanyuan.

However, all the senior students in Jiang City University knew him, so he wasn’t surprised.

“Hello!”

Wang Xian smiled at them kindly.

“It’s really senior Wang Xian. I haven’t seen you for more than a year. Where’s Xiao Yu?”

Su Qian and Yuan Yuan came to Wang Xian’s side with pleasant surprise and asked him.

“Xiao Yu will be back in two days!”

Wang Xian said to them.

“Who is this?”

Forty to fifty people in the surroundings shouted Wang Xian’s name, causing a curious expression to appear on the faces of the surrounding people.

All of them were freshmen and sophomores of Jiang City University. They had never seen Wang Xian before, so they asked their seniors out of curiosity.

“Student Wang Xian, he should be a senior now. He used to be an influential figure in Jiang City University. He once donated 50 million to the university, but he hasn’t appeared in the school for more than a year!”

“Not only that, senior Wang Xian has also managed to woo the former goddess of our Jiang City University. He is the most handsome Prince Charming in our school!”

Some students who were of the same level as Wang Xian and were of a lower grade said to the surrounding juniors and juniors.

“Wow, donating 50 million. That’s amazing. Senior Wang Xian is also quite handsome!”

“TSK, he’s just rich. Now that the world of martial arts is in his hands, being strong is the true capital!”

Some of the girls were in awe, but most of them were a little disdainful. The world today was the world of martial artists. No matter how much money there was, it was useless compared to being strong!

When the few people in the center heard the discussions around them, they looked curiously at Wang Xian who was beside Wang Dahai.

“Wang Dahai, non-martial artists are prohibited from entering our martial arts club!”

A young man looked at Wang Dahai and glanced at Wang Xian before saying in a deep voice.
