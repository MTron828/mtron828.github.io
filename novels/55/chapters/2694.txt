Time passed day by day, the Dragon Palace used the land of 5,000 life planets to exchange for 2 undying level 9 abyss species corpses from the nine heavens sect.

Following which, these 2 undying level 9 abyss species corpses were immediately used to raise the Dragon Palace’s Level 9 warriors.

Over the next 10 days, the Dragon Palace went through large scale drills.

The Dragon Palace currently had about 410,000 members, of which more than 5,000 were members of the logistics and civil service.

There were about 405,000 combat members.

The Dragon Palace would have to use all their strength to hunt down the abyssal races on the Northern Front.

There were hundreds of millions of abyssal races on the northern front. Of course, many of these hundreds of millions of abyssal races were weak divine-level abyssal races.

Even so, it was still a huge force. In this battle, the Dragon Palace had to send out all of their members.

400,000 members of the Dragon Palace all attacked, fighting against hundreds of millions of undying god King Abyss species.

This time, the Dragon Palace had sent out their entire army!

Recently, all the members of the Dragon Palace had been training in the Dragon Field.

After all, there would definitely be deaths in this battle, and there were even quite a number of deaths.

With the current training, the number of casualties would be reduced as much as possible. The revival of the members of the Dragon Palace also required a large amount of resources.

Fifteen days passed in the blink of an eye. In the Dragon Transformation Pool, two level 9 immortal king combat strength members flew out.

“Dragon King, all the members of the Dragon Palace are ready.”

“The great sect has already informed us last month. They will be here soon.”

On the afternoon of the 15th day, Prime Minister GUI came over directly and reported to Wang Xian.

“Alright, we will set off immediately.”

Wang Xian did not hesitate and flew out directly.

“All the members of the Dragon Palace, follow the Dragon King on his expedition.”

Prime Minister GUI shouted softly and ordered all the members of the Dragon Palace.

“Yes!”

In the Dragon Field, all the disciples of the Dragon Palace who had already lined up neatly flew out immediately.

On the ancient Sky Planet, a towering dragon peak stood there.

Next to the Dragon Peak was a divine weapon that looked like a ruler, the horizon ruler.

“Heavenly Eye Arrow Division, Fire Hammer clan, Starwood Dragon Seed, enter the Dragon Peak!”

“The rest of the members of the Dragon Palace, enter the Horizon Ruler!”

Prime Minister Gui, who was floating in the sky, ordered again.

“Yes!”

All the members of the Dragon Palace replied and immediately flew towards Dragon Mountain and the horizon ruler.

“Dragon King!”

Outside, there were 4 people from last month’s sect leader, beside them were 5 undying level 8 warriors.

Other than the people from last month’s sect, bei Shuang from the Bei Chuan Sect, the sect leader from the Bei Chuan Sect, the Dragon Python group and the Ancient God dynasty all had warriors coming over.

There were about 14 immortal King Level 8 experts.

“Dragon King, I heard that you guys are going to hunt for the abyss species on the northern front. We are here to help the Dragon Palace.”

The bei Chuan sect leader and the rest were all smiling as they spoke to Wang Xian.

“Thank you very much then. Everyone, let’s head to the Dragon Peak.”

Wang Xian nodded his head lightly at them.

The Dragon Palace’s hunt for the Abyss species on the northern front this time could be considered quite secretive. However, last month, the Bei Chuan sect and the higher-ups also knew about this matter.

They came over to express their goodwill. They wanted to show that they were on the side of the Dragon Palace.

Wang Xian did not reject them. Although they were not very strong, they could reduce the losses of the Dragon Palace.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Everyone immediately followed behind Wang Xian and came to the command post.

“Let’s Go!”

“Let’s Go!”

Prime Minister Gui, Ao Jian, and another dragon guard were standing on top of the world’s end ruler and controlling it.

Prime Minister Gui looked in the direction of long Feng and shouted softly.

The Heaven Formation responded and both Long Feng and the world’s end ruler were activated instantly.

Boom

Both Long Feng and the world’s end ruler were divine artifacts at the peak of King God level. Their speed was extremely terrifying.

“Is this the full strength of the Dragon Palace?”

Behind the command platform, the people from the Beichuan sect, who had nothing to do last month, started to size up the power of the Dragon Palace.

Soon, their eyes opened wide, and their faces were filled with shock.

...

“According to my senses, there is no one whose battle strength is lower than the eighth rank of the Eternal Lord.”

“There should be around 100,000 godly kings.”

The hierarch pursed his lips and said in a slightly shocked tone last month.

The lowest level of eternal master was level eight. There were 100,000 godly kings and a total of 400,000 members of the Dragon Palace. was this the true strength of the Dragon Palace?

The power of the world margin sect was already very strong. They had about 30 million eternal masters and above, but they had 30 million eternal masters.

Those below level five of eternal master accounted for about 97 percent. Their overall strength could not be compared to the dragon palace at all.

They calculated in their hearts that only the disciples below the eternal God Lord, Jiu Xiao, Duan Tian, and the disciples below the eternal God Lord, could have a chance to meet with the disciples of the Dragon Palace.

Everyone looked at each other, their faces full of shock.

The Dragon Peak of the world’s end was moving quickly. On the Northern line, after more than a month, the Abyss had expanded a large area again.

After flying for two days, the vast and deep abyss that made one’s heart palpitate appeared in their line of sight. At a glance, the Abyss in the Abyss was like a demon that was devouring the human world.

“Members of the Dragon Palace, Get Ready!”

...

Wang Xian looked at the Abyss in front of him and narrowed his eyes slightly.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

The next moment, more than 300,000 disciples flew out from the Heaven’s end ruler.

Over 300,000 members were split into 30 legions, each with 10,000 people.

Of which, the Mad Dragon and Imperial Dragon were the vanguard, followed by the Heaven Thunder Earth Fire Dragon and Phoenix, the Dragon Guards, the Dragon Palace’s Poison Department, and lastly, the Dolphins, the powerful auxiliary dolphins of the Dragon Palace.

Each Legion was led by an undying level 7 warrior according to this ratio.

The group of members came to the side of Dragon Mountain, their bodies filled with powerful fighting spirit and power.

“All armies spread out according to the arrangement above!”

Tian Chen stood in front of the Command Board, looking at the situation of the abyss seeds on the screen in front of him. With a wave of his arm, images appeared in front of the army leaders.

“Yes!”

The group of army leaders looked over, immediately dispersing towards their surroundings.

“The rest of the immortal King Level 8 and above Dragon Palace members are fighting against the abyss seeds of Immortal King Level 8 and above respectively. This is their distribution!”

Heaven array waved his arm again and transmitted the distribution of the abyss seeds of Immortal King Level 8 and above to the Dragon Palace Immortal King Level 8 and above combat strength members.

“Dragon King!”

After distributing them, heaven array looked at Wang Xian.

“Members of the Dragon Palace, listen to my command, Kill!”

Wang Xian raised his arm and ordered loudly. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Yes!”

“Kill!”

At the next moment, all the members of the Dragon Palace started to move. One by one, the legions charged into the abyss.

Boom! Boom! Boom

The Dragon Peak and the horizon ruler let out a rumbling sound.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

On the Dragon Peak, Thorns covered the area. Three thorn monsters gathered rapidly and charged towards the center.

At the center was the place where the abyss seeds were densest, the 2 peak undying god King Abyss seeds were here.
