Translator: 549690339

The middle-aged man’s words made the surrounding one hundred people slightly silent, and then they slowly nodded.

First, this assassin organization appeared out of nowhere. It was extremely mysterious, and its strength was also extremely terrifying. They could not rashly provoke it.

Second, this assassin organization had its own bottom line. They did not accept missions from children, and they did not accept missions from kind people.

Just these two points alone made this assassin organization beyond their control.

Some of the city guards even admired this dragon assassin organization for being able to stick to their bottom line.

“Disperse. Let their families come and collect the bodies!”

The middle-aged man waved his hand and said to them.

“Yes, Sir!”

Everyone nodded and looked at the ground, slowly shaking their heads.

Among the dead, the young man was the most outstanding student of Saint Sea Academy in Saint Sea Town. He had passed the East Sea Academy’s assessment with excellent results.

But now, he was killed!

The city guards knew a little about this young man. He liked women and had once defiled a girl. He was not a good person.

“What a killer organization with personality. I want to join them!”

The woman in the middle stuck out her tongue and said with a smile.

“Alright, stop fooling around!”

The middle-aged man patted the woman’s head and walked out with a smile.

At this moment, everyone in Holy Sea town was talking about the dragon assassin organization.

“It’s too horrifying. A rank 5 transcendent was killed on the street. How could it be so terrifying?”

“A 3-star silver-tier mercenary group leader was instantly killed by a group of subordinates. This is the most terrifying part!”

“The Dragon Assassin Group appeared out of nowhere. It’s too powerful!”

“Damn, I heard that many people now know the contact information of the Dragon Assassin Group. Could it be that someone killed me?”

“I feel that the dragon assassin group is even more terrifying than the undercurrent. They actually killed people in the middle of the city during the day without being discovered by anyone. This is unbelievable. It’s definitely the work of a very powerful assassin!”

Whether it was in the hotel or in the demon hunter mercenary group, everyone was talking about it.

They killed an expert in the middle of the city during the day without anyone noticing. It was so terrifying!

“So powerful. This assassin organization is so powerful. The mission that I issued this morning was completed by noon. Moreover, the method was so shocking. It’s simply too powerful!”

“Haha, this Dragon Assassin Organization is so awesome. It’s simply too awesome!”

When the people from the Dragon Assassin organization received the news, they were excited.

They were happy that their opponents were not killed.

“No, the Dragon Assassin organization is too powerful. Will Someone Hire the Dragon Assassin organization to assassinate me?”

However, they soon became worried. The dragon assassin organization was so powerful. would someone hire them to assassinate them.

Not only these people, but everyone in holy sea town was terrified.

With the strength of the dragon assassin organization, would someone hire them to assassinate him? If someone did, wouldn’t he be finished?

Living in holy sea town, which of the big families didn’t have competitors?

Would competitors hire the Dragon Assassin?

Everyone, everyone was terrified.

However, some people had a clear conscience.

“What are you afraid of? I have a clear conscience all my life. I have never done anything wrong. On the contrary, many people have received my favor. Even if I have offended many people, according to the rules of the dragon thorns, they will not accept my mission!”

“That’s right. Father has always been open and aboveboard. In shenghai town, the reputation of our Tang family can be ranked in the top three. Since the Dragon Thorns assassin organization has given the rule of three no-kill, they will definitely stick to it. Otherwise, an assassin organization would not take unnecessary actions!”

“I’m not afraid, but you guys shouldn’t do anything wrong. We have a lot of enemies. If your hands and feet are dirty, you deserve to be assassinated!”

“Don’t worry, father. We didn’t do anything wrong. Today, we will open the charity hall and help some people!”

“Okay!”

The Tang family in Shenghai town was also a relatively strong family. In the hall, everyone from the Tang family was talking.

On the same day, the Tang family announced the opening of the charity hall to provide relief to those in need.

Compared to the Peace of mind of the Tang family, the others were much more apprehensive.

In the evening, many people also learned about the three don’t kill of the Dragon Assassin organization.

This surprised many people, but at the same time, they were also somewhat impressed. An assassin organization actually set such a rule. It had to be said that it was definitely the first one on the transcendental continent.

However, there were very few people who had a clear conscience and were truly kind. In this world where the strong were respected, there were very few of them.

This made many people go crazy.

“Dragon King, since this afternoon, many people have contacted our dragon spur mercenary group. Up until now, we have accumulated 30 missions!” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“The highest mission is to assassinate a level six transcendent, and the lowest mission is to assassinate a level two transcendent!”

At night, a group of drakonids came to Wang Xian’s room and reported to him.

“Thirty missions? That many?”

Wang Xian was astonished and asked immediately.

“It’s the Dragon King. There are many of them. Now, the entire Shenghai town is talking about our dragon assassin organization!”

The group of DRAKONIDS said with fervent eyes, “We need to select these thirty missions!”

“Alright, we will accept the mission according to our rules. If the mission to assassinate a transcendent level 6 meets the requirements, we will accept it too!”

Wang Xian said directly.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

The DRAKONIDS nodded.

Ding! “The path of the strong does not lose its eyes due to benefits and strength. Congratulations, host, for obtaining the hidden mission set by the light and Dark Dragon God. You have obtained the heart of light and dark and the heart of the pricking Dragon!”

At this moment, the system’s voice sounded. Wang Xian was slightly taken aback.

“This works?”

Wang Xian’s face was filled with astonishment. “Heart of light and dark, heart of the prickling dragon. What is this?”

Just as he finished his sentence, a divine dragon suddenly appeared beside him.

The Divine Dragon was half-bright and half-dark. It looked very strange.

It was only the size of a palm and contained terrifying powers of light and dark.

Buzz

The Divine Dragon moved and entered Wang Xian’s heart directly.

Boom

In an instant, Wang Xian felt the five elements energy in his body trembling violently as if it was rejecting the entry of light and darkness.

The heart of Light and darkness seemed to feel extremely helpless and could only enter Wang Xian’s head directly.

In an instant, Wang Xian felt as if his head had exploded.

“Congratulations to host for merging with the heart of Light and Darkness!”

“Congratulations to host for comprehending the divine ability, the eye of light and Darkness!”

“Congratulations to host for comprehending the divine ability, void!”

“Congratulations to host for comprehending the divine ability, no formation!”

“Host’s level has increased!”

“Congratulations to host for comprehending the piercing pupil!”

A series of system voices rang out, causing Wang Xian to be stunned.

“What is this heart of Light and darkness? Why is it so powerful?”

Wang Xian’s eyes were filled with astonishment.
