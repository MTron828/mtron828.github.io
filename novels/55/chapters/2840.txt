2841 2841 holy feather and immortal slaying gourd

“Thank you very much!”

Wang Xian smiled at the lady and said.

He didn’t leave immediately. It was much more convenient to have a place to stay.

The lady didn’t introduce herself or say anything. She left immediately.

Wang Xian looked at the room behind him and walked straight in.

The room was spotless. He sat on the bed and took out some medicinal pills to heal his injuries.

It took him a few hours to recover from his injuries. He moved his arm and a feather appeared in his hand.

Looking at the feather, Wang Xian smiled.

Buzz

He moved his body and the Genesis wings appeared behind him.

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz

The Genesis wings and the feather started to tremble at the same time.

However, what made Wang Xian frown slightly was that the genesis wings and the holy feather did not merge after trembling for a while.

He frowned and with a thought, he took the incipient saint wings off his back and placed it in front of him.

He placed the holy feather in the position of the wind-elemental dragon soul of the incipient saint wings and watched it quietly.

One minute, two minutes, ten minutes…

There was no movement at all, which made his face turn black.

“What’s going on?”

Wang Xian’s face was a little pale. After all his hard work, the holy feather that he had obtained after crossing two major domains and being severely injured had no reaction.

He grabbed the holy feather and placed it on the incipient saint wings. A surge of energy was transmitted into it.

“Eh? What’s going on? It’s a little unfamiliar?”

He sensed a special message from the Holy Feather. This message was as if the holy feather and the incipient saint wings were not one.

However, he could sense from the incipient saint wings that the holy feather was the feather of the incipient saint wings.

“Could it be that… because of the dragon soul, the dragon soul and the incipient sacred wings merged into one, causing the aura of the incipient sacred wings to change. That’s why they can’t merge perfectly?”

He guessed in his heart. He grabbed the feather and dripped blood into it. Waves of divine dragon aura surged into it.

Buzz! Buzz

The holy feather trembled and was stained with some dragon blood and aura. However, it didn’t change much.

Wang Xian placed the holy feather on the incipient holy wings and realized that the holy feather didn’t reject him like it did in the beginning.

“Looks like I need to nurture it for a period of time!”

Wang Xian mumbled.

“Let’s put it aside first and take a look at the other treasure I obtained.” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

As Wang Xian spoke, he took out the wind jade, including the bird-shaped wind jade.

Following that, Wang Xian took out the immortal slaying calabash.

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz

The cover of the immortal slaying calabash trembled slightly as if it was trying to break free.

Wang Xian took it away. A green wind attribute energy enveloped the wind jade and slowly absorbed them into the calabash.

Wang Xian sensed that the immortal slaying calabash was refining the wind jade. He ignored it and kept it.

Then, he picked up the holy feather and continued to nurture it.

After two days of nurturing, some changes occurred to the Holy Feather.

The Holy Feather, which was originally illusory, became corporeal. Furthermore, there were patterns of divine dragons on it. It looked like dragon scales.

The connection between the Holy Feather and the primaless Holy Wings became deeper and deeper.

Wang Xian heaved a sigh of relief and smiled.

On the third day, Wang Xian sensed that the immortal slaying calabash on the ancestral tree was trembling slightly and was emitting a green glow.

With a wave of his arm, the immortal slaying Calabash appeared in his hand.

“The immortal slaying Calabash has leveled up. No, it should be that the wind attribute immortal slaying sword inside has leveled up. It can release the attack power of a level one celestial thearch!”

Wang Xian was delighted. This was a double blessing.

To be able to release an immortal-slaying sword that could threaten a first level celestial thearch, one could be born every month. If there were dozens of them, it would be able to kill a first level celestial thearch.

After all, when dozens of immortal-slaying swords attacked at the same time, it was equivalent to dozens of first level celestial thearch experts ganging up on one person.

“This immortal-slaying calabash is a good treasure!”

As Wang Xian spoke, he hung it on his body. It was rather handsome as a decoration.

With a smile, Wang Xian stretched his body. He played with the holy feather in his palm and walked out.

In front of the manor was a lively market. Behind it was a lakeside.

There were a few pavilions in front of the lakeside.

Wang Xian came to the pavilions and poured a cup of tea. He sent a message to the eight-limbed demon killing Heaven Array.

He asked them what they were doing.

“Master said that he would bring us to the windless forest for training in a few days. Hehe, this is my first time going to the windless forest!”

“Little junior sister, don’t be happy too early. When you get there, you won’t be able to laugh anymore. Sigh, this is too tragic.”

“Hahaha, sixth junior sister, don’t scare Little Junior Sister.”

“Fifth senior brother, Am I wrong? Back then, when master brought me there for the first time, it was too tragic.”

Just as Wang Xian was sitting on a chair in the pavilion and leisurely drinking tea to nourish his holy feather, voices were heard.

“Eh, there’s someone here. Who Is It?”

At this moment, the three people who were walking over saw Wang Xian in front of the pavilion by the Lakeside. Their faces were filled with surprise.

“Who are you?”

The girl who looked the youngest looked at Wang Xian and asked.

“Brother, are you a disciple of our sect?”

The middle-aged man beside him looked at Wang Xian with a puzzled expression and asked.

“I’m not from your sect.”

Wang Xian looked at them and shook his head.

“Then why are you here? Did master bring you here?”

The youngest girl looked at Wang Xian curiously and continued to ask.

“Yes!”

Wang Xian nodded his head. With the strength of the three people in front of him, the elegant lady should be their master.

“Wow, are you the disciple that master wants to take in? That’s great, that’s great. If that’s the case, I’m not the youngest. I’m also a senior sister!”

When the lady heard Wang Xian’s words, her eyes lit up as she spoke.

Wang Xian was slightly stunned by his words and shook his head speechlessly.

“Junior sister, don’t spout nonsense. Master didn’t say that he wanted to take in a disciple!”

The lady beside him said to him.

“Then why did master bring a person here?”

The junior sister asked curiously.

The lady and the middle-aged man beside her were also slightly puzzled.

“He should be the disciple of master’s relatives and friends.”

The middle-aged man guessed.

“Your master and I met in the windless forest and we were injured. Your master brought me here.”

Wang Xian looked at them guessing and said with a smile.

“I see.”

The little junior sister said with a sudden realization. She narrowed her eyes slightly and said, “What a coincidence. In the past, it was me who was injured. Then, master met me and took me in as his disciple.”

“I think you have a great chance too. You have to work hard. Maybe you can become my master’s disciple. Hehe, then you can become my little junior brother!”

It was obvious that the little junior sister didn’t want to be the youngest. Hence, she guided him enthusiastically.

Wang Xian smiled speechlessly and didn’t reply.

What a joke. He was taking a powerhouse at the peak of the Godly King Realm as his master?
