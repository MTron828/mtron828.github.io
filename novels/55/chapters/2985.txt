Chapter 2986: 2,986, the advance army of the two races

“What’s going on? I just found out that there’s a powerful warrior from the center of the universe, and now he’s been destroyed by the Dragon Palace?”

“Didn’t they say that the powerful warrior from the center of the Universe had invincible power? Didn’t they say that they were going to destroy the Dragon Palace and tame the Dragon God? And they were destroyed halfway through?”

“The Dragon Palace only sent 10,000 members and directly destroyed the powerful warrior from the center of the universe. They had no power to resist at all. The Dragon Palace is too powerful!”

“Is the Dragon Palace that strong? I’m on the nine obliteration planet, but I know that the experts at the center of the universe are almost invincible. Their terrifying power is suffocating. They even said that they wanted to use the members of the Dragon Palace as their mounts, but they were destroyed now?”

The news shocked countless people. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

The Veluriyam region, the Heaven Wizard region, the Imperial Star Region, and the holy region were slightly better off because they had just learned that the experts at the center of the universe had arrived in the starry sky and were destroyed by the Dragon Palace.

As for the eight desolations and six directions, everyone was shocked.

Everyone in the eight desolations and six directions knew that the powerful and terrifying experts from the center of the universe had passed through the eight desolations and six directions and arrived here.

The four-armed experts and the three-eyed experts all carried terrifying pressure in their every move.

They had thought that the disaster of the Dragon Palace was about to arrive, and they had even thought that the dragon palace might be destroyed when the news of the group of experts from the center of the Universe being destroyed arrived.

Moreover, they were easily killed by the 10,000 members of the Dragon Palace without any resistance.

Many people had witnessed the power of the experts from the center of the universe. How could such a terrifying existence be killed in an instant?

How terrifying was the Dragon Palace Now?

Everyone was extremely shocked when they thought of this.

“The Dragon Palace is awesome and invincible. How powerful are the Lords of the Dragon Palace Now?”

“Too powerful. They are the powerhouses at the center of the universe, but they were killed instantly. The Dragon Palace is invincible!”

While they were shocked, many people cheered.

Now that the Dragon Palace controlled the starry sky and gained the support of everyone, they naturally didn’t want the Dragon Palace to be destroyed.

On the AI, the news about the powerhouses at the center of the Universe being killed spread at a terrifying speed.

And on the nine destruction planet, when the people on the planet saw the news spread on the AI, their mouths were slightly agape, their faces filled with shock.

They looked at the information on the AI, then looked at the two powerful beings from the center of the universe floating in the sky above the planet.

“Presumably, at this time, these two fellows still don’t know that their subordinates have been annihilated, right?”

The citizens of the nine destruction planet pursed their lips and looked at them with strange gazes.

“HMM?”

In the void of the nine destruction planet, the two deacons of the four-armed race and the three-eyed race sensed the strange gazes from below, and doubt appeared in their eyes.

However, they didn’t think too much about it. They looked at the information on the communication stone plate in their hands and smiled.

Seeing that the other party was also smiling, their expressions gradually turned cold.

They knew that regardless of whether it was the four-armed race or the three-eyed race, they had already organized an advance army to come over.

After they sent over the method to enter the resplendent starry sky, they waited quietly.

In a few hours at most, the first batch of experts from their race would arrive and begin to fight for the opportunity in this world.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

At this moment, figures flew over at a terrifying speed.

The speed was so fast that when Deacon Qian of the four-armed tribe and Yang Feng of the three-eyed tribe discovered each other, they had already arrived in the sky above the nine annihilation planet and were very close to them.

“This is?”

When the two of them saw the fourteen people who flew in front of them, their pupils constricted slightly and a look of astonishment appeared on their faces.

“Who are you guys?”

Deacon Qian of the four-armed race frowned as he looked at Wang Xian and the rest who had suddenly appeared in front of them. He asked in a deep voice.

“Let me introduce myself. The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace is the opportunity that you are looking for!”

Wang Xian sized them up with his gaze. There was no expression on his face.

“HMM? You are the leader of the Dragon Palace? The Dragon King?”

Yang Feng’s gaze froze when he heard his words. He sized up Wang Xian and the rest from top to bottom.

“HMM? This Is? The Dragon King and the rest are here!”

“The Dragon King and the rest are here!”

On the nine oblivion planet, everyone widened their eyes when they saw Wang Xian and the rest.

“Yes, I am the Dragon King. Remember, the one who killed you!”

Wang Xian nodded his head. The incipient Saint Wings instantly appeared behind him.

Whoosh

Buzz

At the moment when Wang Xian made his move, the Heaven Array waved its arm and a nine-colored light instantly enveloped the starry sky.

In the Void, a ripple appeared. Ao Yao, who was hiding in the surroundings, also started to move instantly.

“What!”

Yang Feng’s expression changed drastically when he saw Wang Xian attacking him at a terrifying speed.

Deacon Qian from the four-armed race also narrowed his eyes. His face was filled with vigilance.

However, he would not lend a helping hand to the three-eyed race.

He scanned his surroundings and sized up the strange nine-colored radiance. He had a bad premonition.

“Ah!”

Just as he was sizing up his surroundings vigilantly, a scream was suddenly heard.

“How is this possible? !”

Deacon Qian of the four-armed race quickly turned his head and saw Yang Feng of the three-eyed race being grabbed by a huge dragon claw. His expression changed drastically.

Instant Kill?

“PFFT!”

“Danger!”

At this moment, he suddenly felt a sense of fear of death shrouding his heart. A large amount of cold sweat instantly appeared on his back.

However, it was too late. The sharp claws pierced through his body, and a strange power melted his life force.

In the next moment, he felt his body being thrown toward the dozens of people floating by the side.

He widened his eyes, full of fear.

What was going on?

They were really members of the Dragon Palace. Why were they so terrifying?

“No, don’t kill me!”

He said hoarsely, his face extremely pale.

“Hehehe, if you want to destroy our Dragon Palace, you’ll have to pay a heavy price!”

A cold voice sounded. Soon after, Deacon Qian from the four-armed race sensed a black monster entering his body. His consciousness slowly disappeared.

“Let me go, let me go. Dragon King, the Army of our three-eyed race will be here soon. I’m warning you, let me go immediately!”

A terrified voice sounded from the side.

Yang Feng, who was caught by Wang Xian in one move, broke out in cold sweat. His eyes were red as he roared.

What the hell was going on?

Was the Dragon Palace so powerful?

“Hehe, you’re courting death. You still want to be a Dragon Knight?”

Wang Xian stared at Yang Feng, who had three eyes. His eyes were filled with disdain.

“You…”

“Soul Catcher!”

Yang Feng wanted to say something when Wang Xian’s cold voice entered his mind.

His consciousness started to blur.

A stream of information entered Wang Xian’s mind.

“Let’s go back!”

Wang Xian squinted his eyes slightly and said something to the group of members before disappearing.

The rest of the members of the Dragon Palace nodded their heads and disappeared.

It took less than 20 seconds from the moment they appeared to the moment they left.

The two powerhouses from the central race of the universe were dead!
