Chapter 4172  Under the powerful attack of 4171

The divine spear penetrated through Wang Xian’s body and continued to strangle the life force in his body.

Meanwhile, the flesh and blood in Wang Xian’s body were growing crazily under the treatment of the ancestral tree.

His recovery ability had reached an abnormally terrifying level!

If Wang Xian wanted to kill an expert whose strength was similar to his, he would have to use the Kylin Bull and the Tai Chi Dragon Disc to kill him.

Regardless of his injuries, he had to fight to the death!

Wang Xian, Linniu, the five elements millstone, and the Tai Chi Dragon Plate. The combined combat strength was sufficient to kill an existence with the same strength as Wang Xian.

Shui Shayin was at this level.

When they fought, Wang Xian and the rest could kill him.

However, it was extremely difficult to kill him in a short period of time, or even in an instant!

However, Wang Xian had a solution now. He would exchange injuries for injuries and try his best to keep him alive.

He would use a powerful treasure to prevent him from using the treasure to escape in an instant!

“This fellow wants to keep me alive. He wants to wipe me out in an instant!”

Shui Sha saw through Wang Xian’s thoughts and his expression changed drastically!

His body was attached to the divine spear. He slowly extended his palm and grabbed at Wang Xian’s penetrated body.

Although Wang Xian’s body was pierced by the divine spear, the divine spear did not penetrate his body completely.

However, at this moment, Wang Xian’s body could explode if the water-sand-like palm penetrated his body!

“Roar!”

However, just as he was about to make a move, Lin Niu had already rushed over.

The strange devil symbols on his body went straight into the divine spear!

The symbols that contained terrifying erosion, destruction, and tearing immediately caused the entire divine spear to tremble violently.

Shui Shayin’s expression changed drastically as well. He tried to stop the invasion of the symbols frantically.

However, at this moment, the five elements millstone above Wang Xian’s head sent down a wave of destructive energy and attacked the divine spear as well!

Wang Xian stretched out his hands and held the divine spear tightly. Waves of energy surged into it!

“Oh no!”

Shui Shayin’s expression changed drastically. Without any hesitation, he took out a special piece of leather from the divine spear.

A drop of water energy dripped into the leather!

He wanted to escape from this place.

Buzz

However, just when he thought he was going to escape, a tree root suddenly appeared in the leather in his hands. It was an emerald green tree root! Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Following that, he felt that his mind was in a trance.

A surge of energy was trying to control his body.

This made him horrified. His face was filled with fear.

“No!”

He roared crazily. His voice was filled with unwillingness!

The attack of the Unicorn Ox entered his body. The destructive force of the five elements grinding was destroying his life force.

Wang Xian was also attacking him.

The roots of the same root prevented him from escaping in an instant.

Death had arrived!

“PFFT!”

The life force of the water sand disappeared completely. His body came out from the divine spear and landed on the ground at the side.

Wang Xian pulled out the divine spear that was inserted into his body. The wounds on his body were healing rapidly.

He looked at the ground in front of him calmly.

There was another strong cultivator of the heaven’s origin realm hiding there.

The strong cultivator of the heaven’s origin realm who was with Bai Kefu Sheng noticed Wang Xian’s gaze. When he saw the corpse beside him, his body trembled violently!

He felt a tingling sensation on his scalp. He hurriedly fled backward and returned to the side of Bai Kefu Sheng and the rest!

“Hiss!”

At this moment, the sudden death of a heaven origin creation realm expert caused the entire arena and the entire battlefield to be silent!

Even the golden leopard from the six paths universe had his gaze slightly focused!

During these 100 million years, a large number of heaven origin creation realm experts had entered their six paths universe.

During these 100 million years, they had also continuously hunted and killed them.

The 100 million years of hunting and killing made them understand that none of the heavenly yuan creation realm experts that could enter their six paths universe were simple.

If the other party wanted to escape, even if they used their trump cards, it would be difficult to stop them!

It was too difficult to kill a heavenly yuan creation realm expert!

However, here, a heavenly yuan creation realm expert was actually killed in a short period of time.

The one who attacked was actually a heaven’s origin creator from another universe.

“Is it a great dao level existence?”

The death of a heaven’s origin creator halted the battle in the surroundings.

A Heaven’s origin creator stared at Wang Xian with a face full of fear as he growled in a low voice.

“No, it’s just two beginner-level Heaven’s origin creators. However, they have a lot of trump cards.”

Bai Kefu Sheng stared at Wang Xian. When he saw a powerhouse of the Heaven’s origin being killed by Wang Xian so quickly, his face was filled with fear!

He had been killed by Wang Xian once.

However, he had struggled for a period of time previously. This time, the powerhouse of the Heaven’s origin was killed so quickly.

Didn’t he use all his trump cards when he killed him?

“Tianci’s foster father actually killed a Heavenly Kismet realm expert from another universe. Oh My God, he’s so strong!”

The powerful disciples of the Mu Li tribe widened their eyes in shock when they saw this scene.

“That pet...”. “No, didn’t his foster father let that Lord Godly beast follow Tianci on his birthday?”? “This Godbeast has been following tianci for more than 90 million years. I thought it was just a pet, but I didn’t expect it to be a heavenly creation-level Lord!”

Mu Liyin ‘er’s older brother looked at the Unicorn Ox and couldn’t help but Exclaim!

The Unicorn Ox that had been following tianci all along, they even had a pet that was given to Tianci by his godfather.

The result? ?

An existence at the Heavenly Yuan creation realm.

A supreme existence!

“What?”

When the surrounding strong disciples heard this, they were a little dazed.

Especially those who knew Tianci and had seen the unicorn ox, they were even more in disbelief.

“No Wonder Mu Li Tianci is so strong, so monstrous, he has a heavenly Yuan creation realm treasure, and he has a foster father at the Heavenly Yuan creation realm, as well as a divine beast at the Heavenly Yuan creation realm who has been protecting him all along!”

At the Nine River Tribe, Gong Cheng was staring at his grandfather with his mouth agape.

“What kind of immortal brother-in-law is this?”

Gong Cheng’s younger brother was staring with his eyes wide open.

Today, he felt that he had learned something new!

“I haven’t seen you for a few days. Dragon King, you have become stronger again. However, what is going on? The Ultimate Treasure of Tianyuan Destiny is right beside you. Why didn’t you take it away?”

The twelve ancestral witches looked at Wang Xian who had instantly killed an expert of Tianyuan. They looked at each other with shock in their eyes.

They knew that Wang Xian had not broken through for too long.

However, he was able to kill an expert of Tianyuan so easily. Even they could not achieve such a feat!

The current Dragon King and the rest were even fearful of the twelve ancestral witches.
