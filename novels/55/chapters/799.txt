Translator: 549690339

“Bang Bang Bang!”

“Ahhhh!”

The sounds of attacks and screams resounded through the city gates of the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect.

Under the gazes of the experts from the two immortal sects, the bait they had sent out was directly killed.

The corpses of the infant realm experts were directly smashed onto the ground.

Humiliation, naked humiliation.

Even if the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect destroyed the Dragon Gate forging workshop, it didn’t cause such humiliation.

Back then, the members of the Dragon Gate fought to the death. Even if they knew they were going to die, they still fought!

But now, it was the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect and the other two immortal sects. They just stood in the city and watched this scene.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

At this instant, terrifying figures appeared in the sky. Violent Flames and exploding wood filled the entire sky.

The clouds in the sky that were a thousand meters high instantly turned into burning clouds that were completely red.

Five figures floated in the sky. Their eyes were filled with a crazed killing intent as they stared at the people from the Dragon Gate with bloodthirsty eyes.

“The prelude to the war has begun. I hope you can endure it!”

Ao Jian’s figure appeared in the void far away. He stared at the five immortals from the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect, his face filled with coldness.

“One day, we will kill all of you with our own hands!”

The elder in the middle, dressed in fiery red clothes, stared at Ao jian with a cold expression. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Let’s wait and see!”

Ao Jian replied indifferently.

“Haha, Let’s Go. Holy Medicine sect, from today onwards, all of you will hide in the city. Once you come out, you will die!”

Mo Qinglong laughed maniacally and his voice spread throughout the entire holy city.

More than thirty drakonids slowly walked away with their heads held high.

The person who killed you then left in a carefree manner!

This made everyone from Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect extremely embarrassed.

“Just how terrifying will the strength of the Dragon Gate Be? In the future, which immortal sect will dare to provoke the Dragon Gate!”

“Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect has lost. The Immortal sect that was arrogant yesterday, from today onwards, I wonder if they still dare to leave the city gates!”

“From today onwards, the Dragon sect will be famous throughout the martial arts world. No one will dare to provoke them. They are almost comparable to the Xuan Yuan clan and the Yuwen clan!”

Not far away, the disciples of the immortal sect who were watching the show were filled with astonishment as they watched the Dragon Sect’s powerhouse fly away. Their eyes were filled with shock.

“Dragon King!”

Ao Jian and the rest of the people of the Holy Doctor, Holy Medicine Immortal sect, greeted Wang Xian respectfully from a position 20 kilometers away.

“Very good. We will continue to stand guard here. Once the disciples of their sect dare to come out, we will kill them immediately!”

Wang Xian revealed a faint smile.

50 infant realm experts wanted to ambush the surroundings of the road. To Wang Xian, this was simply courting death.

To the strange demons, they were like lambs waiting to be slaughtered.

50 infant realm experts were easily killed by the strange demons without anyone noticing!

“It’s the Dragon King!”

The group of DRAKONIDS nodded respectfully.

In this battle, even the seventy members of the Golden Swordfish clan didn’t make a move.

“In this situation, it won’t be long before nine Hui breaks through...”

Wang Xian raised his head slightly with a smile on his face.

Just like the declaration of the Dragon Palace, anyone who offended the dragon palace would be killed!

The First Battle of the Dragon Palace would be sacrificed by the Holy Medicine Immortal sect.

Mo Qinglong and the strange demon went into hibernation again, waiting for the disciples of the Holy Medicine Immortal sect to come out.

At this moment, there was a huge commotion on the jianghu website.

“The Holy Medicine Immortal sect was killed by the Dragon sect by 50 infant realm experts!”

“The two immortal sects were defeated, and the Dragon sect showed their terrifying strength!”

“In the morning, they even shouted that the children of the Dragon Gate would come and kill us. However, in just a few hours, they were all killed, and 50 infant realm experts died!”

“These are 50 infant realm experts, and they were ambushed in the surroundings, yet they were killed by the Dragon Gate unknowingly. How is this possible? How did the Dragon Gate do it?”

“Just how strong is the Dragon Gate? The experts of the Dragon Palace must have arrived!”

The jianghu internet was in an uproar. The originally arrogant Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect was completely silent.

“Now, it seems that the Dragon Gate has blocked the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal Sect’s city gate. Once they come out, they might be killed!”

At this moment, all the disciples of the immortal sect realized that the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect could only hide inside the city gate.

“They once launched a sneak attack on the Dragon Gate forging workshop, but now they’ve been beaten into dogs. These two immortal sects are so disgraceful!”

Some mocking voices were heard, causing the disciples of the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect to feel extremely aggrieved when they saw these posts.

However, they had no other choice. They could only reply with an angry expression, “If it weren’t for the Immortal God Agreement, the Dragon Gate would have been destroyed by US long ago!”!

“Without the agreement between the Immortals and gods, the Dragon Gate would have been destroyed long ago.”The disciples of the two immortal sects could only comfort themselves on the Jianghu website.

The East Gate of the sacred city was still open, but no one dared to walk out of the gate.

The two immortal sects were completely helpless. Fifty infant realm experts were killed. Their strength was no longer enough to fight against the Dragon Gate.

In this situation, it was tantamount to admitting defeat!

“Without the help of the immortal gods, they killed fifty infant realm experts without anyone knowing. It seems that there are many terrifying creatures in the Dragon Palace!”

In the Chaos Origin Immortal Sect, the three immortal gods looked at each other with fear in their eyes.

Even the immortal gods couldn’t do anything about the terror of those creatures.

They were glad that they did not fight to the death back then!

Otherwise, they would be in a much worse situation than the Holy Doctor, Holy Medicine, and Immortal sect. In fact, the entire immortal sect would be destroyed.

Just as all the immortal sects were discussing about the holy doctor, Holy Medicine, and Immortal Sect, a strange battle began to erupt in the Xia Ding region.

Wang Xian led a group of members of the Dragon Palace to the Holy Doctor, Holy Medicine, and Immortal sect while Ao Yao led a group of strange demons to the Xia Ding region.

There were two great immortals in the Xia Ding region. One was the strange thorn tribe and the other was the wild beast immortal sect.

The Wild Beast Immortal sect was extremely powerful and could be ranked in the top five.

The Strange Thorn tribe was not to be underestimated either.

A thousand years ago, they were a terrifying assassin organization that walked in the dark.

The strength of the Strange Thorn tribe lay in their assassinations.

No one dared to provoke a terrifying assassin organization because one would not know when one would die if they provoked them.

The crafty Thorn clan possessed the most powerful concealment technique of all the immortal sects.

To strike with a single strike and flee into the distance, this was the description of the crafty Thorn clan.

On the surface, the crafty Thorn clan had three immortal gods and one God, but it was unknown whether they had any hidden strength.

The number of infant stage experts was unknown, and so was the number of Dan stage experts.

Their base was located within a small city in Xia ding. Although it was called a small city, it was actually just a small town. There weren’t many people within.

Most of them were wearing a shadow robe and were extremely mysterious.

“Have you gathered all the information?”

“Leader, we’ve gathered all the information in one day!”

“Then let’s begin. Thorn clan, let Our Strange Demon Clan Challenge You!”
