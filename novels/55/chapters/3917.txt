Chapter 3918: 3917, the two peak races, were furious and powerless

Translator: 549690339

Screams of pain could be heard in the Giant Star City.

In the past, the masters of the high-level races in the nine-origin universe were killed by the Dragon Palace!

The disciples of the two peak races were killed one by one.

“This time, the angel race and the Phoenix race have suffered heavy losses!”

“Most of their powerful disciples have entered the starry universe, and most of them are in the city. They might not be able to recover from their losses even when the catastrophe arrives. ”

“Yeah, the Phoenix race and the angel race have really provoked the wrong enemy. ”

“The Dragon Palace is too powerful! ”

All the peak races in the surroundings looked at this scene in shock.

After witnessing the Dragon King’s terrifying strength, they were full of respect for the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace.

After all, this was a real battle technique.

Two existences at the peak of the ruler realm.

One was the Prince of the Fire Phoenix, and the other was the guardian of the Angel of light.

(‘I feel that the strength of the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace is at the peak of the ruler realm among the peak races. ”

“Almost. Judging from his relaxed appearance, it shouldn’t be a problem for him to kill three or four masters of the same level at the same time! ” A few rank 7 masters of the shamans were talking in low voices. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“HMM? How is this possible?”

At this moment, they were in the location of the nine-origin universe passage. When they couldn’t sense the situation in the giant star city.

The powerhouses of the angel race and the Phoenix race felt uneasy

However, because the two peak-stage ruler-level powerhouses stepped inside, their unease wasn’t intense!

But at this moment, they suddenly received a message.

It was from the Prince of the Fire Phoenix, Feng Yuntian, and the radiant Angel Protector, Ayres.

As the top-tier powerhouses of the two peak races, they naturally had resurrection treasures!

In fact, the treasures they resurrected could not be compared to ordinary resurrection treasures.

When they were killed and resurrected by Wang Xian, they immediately sent the news over.

This caused the faces of the powerhouses from the Angel Race and the Phoenix race to instantly turn gloomy.

The other ten peak races suddenly sensed the change in their auras. They raised their eyebrows slightly and revealed a look of astonishment in their eyes.

“Damn you, Dragon King! If he dares to kill a disciple of our Phoenix clan, our Phoenix clan will never let him go! We will start a war with him! ”

At this moment, a roar filled with killing intent and anger echoed in the whole world!

The Water Phoenix King was emitting a terrifying aura. He did not hide his aura at all and rushed toward the surroundings!

“Dragon King of the Dragon Palace! ”

Crack! Crack! Crack

The Radiant Angel King was also clenching his fists. His aura was extremely cold.

All the Phoenixes and angels had ugly expressions on their faces!

“If the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace dares to kill the disciples of My Angel clan, we’ll start an all-out War! ”

The Radiant Angel King also roared with a face full of killing intent.

There were a large number of their powerful disciples in the vast starry city. Even their two peak races couldn’t afford such a loss!

If those powerful disciples were all killed by the Dragon King, then their losses would be too great!

“Oh? What did the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace Do?”

The experts of the other peak races looked over in astonishment.

What on Earth had caused the Phoenix and Angel races to be so furious?

However, the blockade at the starry city was still ongoing.

No one could see what was happening inside.

In fact, the information inside could not be transmitted over.

Clearly, the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace and the rest had completely sealed off the inside!

They could only wait quietly here.

At this moment, Wang Xian was not there to watch the disciples of the dragon palace slaughter the strong disciples of the two peak races.

He appeared beside Lan Qingyue and dealt with the other four space beasts who were at the level seven of the Dominator realm!

In the battle here, Lan Qingyue, Xiao Lan, and the rest had always been at the upper hand. One of the space beasts was even severely injured by them!

Wang Xian’s appearance completely ended the battle.

With the help of the power of the star field fragment, he easily killed a space beast that was at level seven.

The next three were even easier!

When Wang Xian helped Lan Qingyue to kill the four space beasts.

In the space city, all the strong disciples of the angel and Phoenix clans had been killed.

“Dragon King, I’ve already gotten an lie to prepare for the Divine Dragon Island. Everything has been settled! ”

At this moment, Prime Minister Gui flew over and spoke to Wang Xian.

“Alright. ”

Wang Xian nodded and revealed a faint smile!

Wiping out so many strong people from the Phoenix clan and the Angel clan this time had already caused them serious injuries.

It might even alert existences above their rulers. Therefore, Wang Xian had Prime Minister Gui make full preparations.

Once all of their powerful disciples were exterminated, the Dragon Palace would be ready to move out of the nine-origin universe.

Only in the nine-origin universe would there be some devil spirit altars and some dragon palaces that had been built in the past.

Apart from that, the Dragon Palace had also made some preparations on the Divine Dragon Island!

“Send an lie over. I’ll make a trip to the Divine Dragon Island before the two peak races can react! ”

Wang Xian spoke to Prime Minister Gui again.

“It’s the Dragon King! ” Prime Minister Gui nodded.

“Greetings, Dragon King! ”

Soon, an Lie’s figure appeared beside Wang Xian.

“Yes, Bring Me to the Divine Dragon Island.”

Wang Xian nodded, he looked at LAN qingyue and said, “Qingyue, bring the rest of the disciples of the Dragon Palace and wait here. The Angel clan and

Phoenix clan shouldn’t dare to send their experts here recklessly. The other peak clans wouldn’t let them in either. ”

“Alright, Little Xian! ”

Lan qingyue nodded.

Wang Xian gestured to an lie and the two of them left instantly!

Buzz

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz

The moment Wang Xian left, the entire void quickly returned to its original appearance.

The stars disappeared one by one.

“Eh? The Dragon King and the rest have left?”

“The next storm is just about to start. If the angel and Phoenix clans knew about this, they would probably be extremely furious! ”

(‘I reckon that the angel race and the Phoenix race will attack the Dragon Palace of our nine-origin universe. and the Dragon King and the others won’t let the powerful disciples of the Angel Race and the Phoenix race step into the Starry Universe! ”

“This time, the Dragon Palace and the Angel Race and the Phoenix race are in deep trouble. When we meet in the future, we’ll fight to the death! ”

In the starry city, all the experts were discussing when they saw that the void around them had recovered..
