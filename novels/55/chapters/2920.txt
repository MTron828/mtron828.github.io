Chapter 2921: The shocking decision of 2921 Dragon Palace

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz

Soon, three vast figures flew over from the top of the tower and landed on it.

However, when they came to the top and saw the experts of this planet kneeling there, they were slightly stunned.

Looking at the young man who was smiling at them, their pupils constricted slightly.

Feeling the endless pressure from him, the three of them were stunned.

“Dragon King?”

The old man in the lead was slightly stunned and asked Wang Xian.

“Yes!”

Wang Xian nodded his head.

“This… We pay our respects to you, Dragon King!”

The three of them clearly didn’t react in time. When they saw Wang Xian admitting to it, they immediately bowed respectfully.

“You’re welcome. Are we going to meet your domain Lord Now?”

Wang Xian asked.

“This Dragon King… We thought that it would take you more than ten hours to rush here from the Imperial Star Field. We didn’t expect you to rush here so quickly!”

“We, Liu Li, have planned for the three of US and the Grand Supreme Elder of Green Mountain to come and welcome you. We have just arrived and the Grand Supreme Elder and the others have yet to arrive.”

The glazed tile divine emperor in the middle said with slight embarrassment.

When they received the news that the Dragon King had arrived, they immediately rushed over.

They also immediately ordered the planet’s manager to make arrangements to properly welcome the Dragon King’s arrival.

But they didn’t expect the Dragon King to arrive earlier than them.

After all, the Dragon King had rushed over from the imperial star field. How could he be so fast?

“It’s alright. Let’s wait for them. Oh yes, do you have an artificial intelligence? Let me take a look at some information about your glazed domain!”

Wang Xian smiled and shook his head as he said to them.

“Yes, yes. Dragon King, please wait here for a moment. I will immediately contact the Grand Supreme Elder and the rest. Tell them to hurry up!”

The three divine emperors said immediately and handed Wang Xian an artificial intelligence.

After that, they immediately asked the people around them to bring over chairs and some tea.

The manager of this planet hurriedly went to prepare it personally.

After receiving the artificial intelligence handed over by the glazed celestial thearch, Wang Xian opened it and took a look.

As soon as he opened it, he saw a few popular topics. There was information about that guy who was invincible in battle techniques.

He opened it and took a look. He looked at the video that he posted and some of the replies. Then, he looked at the second message. A speechless expression appeared on his face.

“This fellow is still the same as before!”

Wang Xian said indifferently.

He looked at the replies below in boredom. There were all sorts of words that said that he was invincible in battle techniques.

However, the people from the glazed domain also understood that the background of invincible in battle techniques was very deep. It was possible that he had a very good relationship with the god Emperor. Hence, they did not start scolding him.

However, there were a lot of words that said that he was invincible in battle techniques and was as ugly as all sorts of dire beasts. They even made a lot of videos for him. It was very interesting.

“Boss Wang, Boss Wang, you came too quickly!”

Not long after, a very familiar voice sounded.

Wang Xian looked over and saw three figures flying over quickly.

It was an old man whom he did not know, the god Emperor of Shangshui, and his battle techniques were invincible.

“Greetings, Dragon King. I’m sorry to have kept you waiting. We were originally prepared to welcome you, Dragon King!”

The other elder was the first Supreme Elder.

He said apologetically to Wang Xian.

“Hehe, it’s alright.”

Wang Xian shook his head nonchalantly.

“Boss Wang, your speed is too fast!”

Invincible battle technique walked over and said in surprise.

“The distance is not far. I flew here alone!”

Wang Xian patted invincible battle technique on the shoulder and nodded his head to greet the celestial emperor of Shangshui!

“Thank you for your help this time, Dragon King. Dragon King, we will bring you to our governor.”

“Our Governor is currently stationed at the border to prevent the machine royal territory from making a move. We can not come here directly. Please do not forgive us, Dragon King!”

The first Supreme Elder said to him.

“It’s alright. The Dragon Palace has paid some attention to the situation in your glazed tile region. We understand!”

Wang Xian shook his head.

The governor was completely restrained at the border of the machine royal territory. He was also aware of this.

“Let’s go there directly!” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Wang Xian said to them.

“Thank you for your understanding, Dragon King. This Way Please!”

The first supreme elder smiled and gestured immediately.

Wang Xian nodded and followed behind. With a wave of his arm, he took away the immortal slaying calabash, the venerable’s mark, and the control of Earth from invincible battle technique.

“Wow, boss Wang, leave one for me too!”

Invincible battle technique screamed in pain.

He followed the Grand Elder and the rest of them through the teleportation formation.

Three hours later, they arrived at a desolate starry sky.

The destination of the teleportation formation was not a planet, but a continent.

A powerful military continent.

“Thank you for coming, Dragon King!”

Just as Wang Xian flew out, a voice rang out.

An old man who looked refined and amiable walked towards Wang Xian and extended his hand.

There were 20 old men around him. Each of them was at the level of a divine emperor.

Obviously, this old man was the governor of the glazed area, the strongest person in glazed area. At the same time, he was also the strongest person in glazed area.

“This must be the governor. Nice to meet you!”

Wang Xian walked over and extended his palm with a smile on his face. He shook hands with the governor.

“It is a blessing for our glazed tile region that the Dragon King is willing to lend us a hand. I would like to thank the Dragon Palace for their assistance!”

The governor thanked him again.

“Hehe, you are too polite, Governor.”

Wang Xian exchanged a few pleasantries with him before following the governor into the palace at the side.

Around them, a group of celestial emperors followed.

Some of the soldiers looked over curiously.

Wang Xian scanned his surroundings. In the surrounding void, there were the soldiers of the glazed domain. Each and every one of them was equipped with powerful war weapons.

On the other side, there were terrifying battleships that were emitting a metallic luster. They were exuding an awe-inspiring aura.

All sorts of powerful technological weapons caught Wang Xian’s attention.

“The armed forces of the mechanical imperial region are pressing down on us. The Creator is in the center. If it weren’t for them, we wouldn’t be in such a passive position!”

The governor spoke when he saw Wang Xian’s gaze.

Wang Xian nodded his head slightly.

The mechanical imperial region was a unique type of life form. They were created by the creator, and the creator had the authority over the life and death of all the robots.

A long time ago, the mechanical imperial region was a human starfield with exceptionally advanced technology.

Their robot manufacturing technology was very powerful, and they could create fully intelligent robots.

Even in battle, they controlled the robots to fight.

Later, for some unknown reason, the robots rebelled, killing all the humans and establishing the current mechanical imperial region.

In this bright starry sky, the one who lived the longest was the leader of the mechanical imperial region, the creator.

The creator was the leader of the robot rebellion and had existed for more than a billion years.

A divine emperor’s lifespan was only 100 million years. One could imagine what kind of existence this was.

The mechanical imperial region represented the most powerful technological means in the resplendent starry sky.

Unfortunately, in order to pursue technological advancement, they had always been enemies with humans.
