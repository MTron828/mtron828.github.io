The gap was too huge.

Divine Dragons were already top-notch existences of the same level. Wang Xian was also a rare divine dragon of the five elements. Even though the eight-headed dragon was gifted, he could still be easily suppressed.

“Poison Explosion!”

The eight-headed Dragon’s body was burning with flames. It was suffering from the attacks of lightning, wind blades, earth spikes, and strange demons. It twisted its body in anger.

It opened its mouth and spat out balls that were half a meter in size from its stomach.

“Water Shield!”

Wang Xian’s expression did not change. A huge shield appeared in front of him.

Crack! Crack

The water shield cracked instantly. Black poisonous arrows shot towards him.

The black poisonous arrows were extremely terrifying. They were filled with the power of corrosion.

Earth Shield!

Wang Xian waved his dragon claw and another 20-meter-sized Earth Shield appeared in front of him.

“Ah!”

At this moment, a scream came from the side. An immortal-level thunder shrimp was hit by a poisonous arrow, and his entire arm turned dark green instantly.

“As expected of the superior immortal-level octahedron. Even with such a huge gap, it can still cause damage to the members of the Dragon Palace!”

Wang Xian spat out the wood dragon bead and the fire dragon bead.

“Kill!”

The wood dragon bead revolved rapidly around the fire dragon bead. The dense green dragon aura caused the flames on the fire dragon bead to smash toward the eight-headed Hydra as if it had added an accelerant.

“Bang!”

A tail swept toward the fire dragon bead.

“Roar!”

The fire dragon bead let out an angry roar and suddenly turned into a huge dragon head. The dragon head bit on the tail. In just a short moment, more than half of the tail was bitten off.

“AH AH, damn it, damn it, nine-headed Snake Shadow!”

Eight-headed Hydra was in pain again, and its eyes were filled with madness as it shook its body. The surrounding venom surged crazily towards it, and one after another, demonic shadows that looked exactly like him appeared and attacked the surrounding area.

“Boom Boom Boom!”

The earth shook and the mountains shook. Even in the ocean of five to six thousand meters, the entire seabed was like an earthquake, and the powerful nine-headed snake shadow covered the surrounding area.

The Demon Shadow was covered with corrosion and Venom.

“Release your defense behind me!”

Prime Minister Gui shouted softly, and the turtle shell on his back flew directly in front of him.

The turtle shell instantly grew to about twenty meters, and the members of the Dragon Palace arrived behind him one by one.

The wind shield, the dense demonic qi, the gate of lightning, and the ring sword defense set up powerful defenses in front of the turtle shell.

“Bang! Bang! Bang!”

The demonic shadow attacked, and the terrifying attack penetrated through the layers of defense.

Wang Xian also built up layers of defense in front of himself.

“Kill!”

“Clang!”

The Water Dragon Pearl transformed into a water sword and attacked one of the heads.

“Destroy!”

One of the heads opened its huge mouth, and thick demonic liquid gushed out from its mouth. With all kinds of negative attributes, it went up against the water sword.

The water flow on the water sword kept on fluctuating. Streams of water energy blocked the demonic liquid.

“Whoosh!”

The water sword penetrated through and entered one of the heads.

“Sword Explosion!”

Wang Xian shouted softly. The water sword instantly exploded into small pieces.

“Hiss, hiss, hiss!”

A horrifying scream was heard. One of the heads of Ba Qi was penetrated by countless water swords.

“Ah, Lord eight-headed snake, save me!”

At this moment, a scream came from the side.

Eight-headed snake turned its head and a cold glint flashed in its eyes.

“Ah Ah!”

Sharp claws cut off the last two heads of eight-headed snake.

“Dragon King!”

The remaining eight heads of eight-headed snake let out a low roar.

Wang Xian smiled coldly and moved to the side of the five-headed snake’s corpse. He opened his huge mouth.

Ding! “Devouring the five-headed snake has increased the dragon energy by 34 million!”

The system notification came. Wang Xian stared at the eight-headed snake with a hint of greed in his eyes. As long as he could devour the eight-headed snake, he would be able to level up immediately.

When he saw Wang Xian’s gaze, the eight-headed snake could not help but shiver.

“Dragon King, just you wait!” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

The eight-headed snake shouted. Under Wang Xian’s astonished gaze, his huge body actually shrank and finally took on the appearance of a human.

However, this human’s appearance was very strange. He was holding a beast bone with a human head hanging on it.

He had nine heads and one of them was hanging high up.

His body was extremely weak and every head had a middle-aged face. His face was long and thin and looked extremely strange.

He even had nine arms and looked like a monster no matter how one looked at him.

After transforming into human form, the eight-limbed snake moved and dived into a mountain peak below.

“Go after him!”

Wang Xian did not hesitate. Letting go of a superior immortal with such high intelligence would definitely be a future trouble for him.

His eyes flashed with a blue and red glow. His gaze locked onto the eight-limbed snake’s body as he followed closely behind.

“There are actually so many tunnels. What a cunning rabbit with three burrows!”

Wang Xian looked down and followed closely behind.

“The vengeful souls won’t disperse. Dragon King, are you going to kill them all as soon as possible?”

Ba Qi’s expression changed drastically as he roared loudly.

“Surrender or die. You only have these two choices!”

Wang Xian waved his arm and a fireball shot towards him.

At this moment, they were in the underground tunnel. Ba Qi’s expression changed slightly. With a wave of his arm, he crashed into another tunnel at the side. With a wave of his arm, the tunnel collapsed immediately.

However, Wang Xian’s eye of penetration could easily penetrate through some soil and sand.

He broke through and followed closely behind.

Ba Qi’s expression changed again. His speed was not slow, but he could not get rid of Wang Xian at all.

The nine dragons with the Green Dragon attribute could also follow behind and lock onto him.

This made Ba Qi’s expression extremely awkward.

The power of the Dragon Palace was far beyond his imagination.

“You want me to submit? Impossible!”

The nine heads gritted their teeth and fled into the distance.

Wang Xian frowned and followed closely behind the eight-headed snake. In terms of endurance, a dragon’s patience was definitely not something that an eight-headed snake could compare to.

“Little nine-headed snake, don’t make me lose my patience. When I catch you, I will cut off your heads one by one!”

Wang Xian followed behind and spoke slowly.

Escape? There was no way he could escape.

Unless a superior immortal came over to help him. However, it was obvious that he didn’t have a Companion of a superior immortal.

The nine heads of the eight-limbed snake broke out in a cold sweat. Their faces were extremely pale. “I am a god. I have been roaming the world for a thousand years. How can I submit to others? Even if I commit hara-kiri, I will not submit!”

“I didn’t ask you to submit. I will devour you as soon as I catch you. After I devour you, I will be able to break through.”

Wang Xian followed closely behind with a smile.

“What a pervert!”

The nine faces of the eight-limbed snake were extremely embarrassed. With a move of one of his arms, poisonous substances within a radius of four to five kilometers appeared.

He sped up and rushed to the right.

The eight-headed nine’s actions were completely within Wang Xian’s sight. He changed his direction and ignored the poison as he chased after it.

“How did you still discover me? !”

A head was facing Wang Xian as he shouted in disbelief.
