Chapter 373: Immortal Substance

Roar!

Above the Dragon Palace, the blue whale let out a roar like an overlord. Its gigantic body looked even more robust than ever.

The biggest change was found at its head and mouth.

After swallowing the dragon blood, its head became sharper with enormous teeth growing out from its mouth.

The head of the blue whale was huge, occupying two-fifths of the entire body mass. That meant that its head could reach a dozen meters when it was more than thirty meters long.

Each tooth was about three or four meters. All of them were grey, creepy-looking, and extremely durable.

“What a huge change. If it has enough blood, wouldn’t we be able to nurture a powerful Kun rapidly?”

[Whale Kun: Level 11]

[Unable to extract Dragon Energy]

When Wang Xian read the information, he was appalled by the speedy evolution process. It was even faster than those members from the Dragon Palace who went to the Dragon Transformation Pool.

“Xiao Xian, the level of the Kun has got something to do with my ability. The Kun that I raise cannot exceed my own level!”

“Moreover, I can only keep one now with my current ability. I’ll need to reach a higher level before I can raise another one,” Lan Qingyue explained to Wang Xian.

Wang Xian nodded slightly. The speed of raising a Kun, if raised by the Ancient God Kun Breeder, was unbelievable, but it had a lot of limitations.

A supreme-class Ancient God Kun Breeder could at most rear ten Kuns.

Through Lan Qingyue’s explanation, the rearing of Kun required feeding of the bloodline. In other words, even if other races got hold of the rearing techniques, they could not rear one.

Now that Lan Qingyue was the last Kun Breeder in this universe, the Ancient God Kun Breeder Clan could only flourish when Wang Xian and her gave birth to their offspring.

“Back at the Yellow River the other time when those creatures were zombified, their sizes actually grew by multiple times. Why didn’t this blue whale grow too?” Wang Xian asked with curiosity.

If the size of the blue whale were enhanced by more than tenfold, it would be crazily huge. A creature that was a few hundred or even up to a thousand meters was nowhere to be seen in history!

“The size of Xiao Lan is just nice now. Any bigger will reduce its defense. When it reaches Level 12, it will double its size to seventy meters!” Lan Qingyue explained.

“Level 12 can grow to seventy meters. When it’s Level 13, it can grow to more than a hundred meters. That means, it can grow to a few thousand meters when it’s Level 17 or 18?”

Wang Xian did some math and stared at the blue whale, “He will become a gigantic warring beast in the future!”

A picture was formed in Wang Xian’s mind. Members of the Dragon Palace stood close to one another before this domineering Kun of unknown size.

Conquer the universe and the millions of clans and races!

“Impressive!”

Wang Xian’s eyes were brightened up while Lan Qingyue rolled her eyes at him. “Xiao Xian, I want Xiao Lan to enter the Dragon Palace so that he can cultivate here and guard the palace for you!”

“Sure, of course. Haha. Are you hungry? Let’s go and have something!”

Wang Xian let out hearty laughter and hugged Lan Qingyue before he swam towards the Dragon Palace.

“Dragon King!”

As soon as he entered, Nine venomous sea snakes swam over with something in their mouths.

“Hur? This is...?”

Wang Xian looked at the Nine Venomous Sea Snakes with a stunned look as he checked out several large bodies.

“The bodies of the Aurora Jellyfish weren’t absorbed by the Dragon Transformation Pool?”

He was slightly surprised!

[Immortal Jellyfish: Level 11 (Substance Form)]

[Soul-less State. Resurrect it with another soul.]

“No, even the names have changed. They have become Immortal Jellyfish. I can revive them with another soul!”

The message in Wang Xian’s mind reminded him of another thing which was recorded in the Divine Dragon Transformation.

Immortal Substance.

Just as suggested by its name, it was non-perishable. Unless the substance was reduced to ashes, it would live forever.

This referred to vitality, which had a significant difference from stones and soil.

Once a soul entered into one of these Immortal Substances, it could share an eternal life together with it.

Wang Xian had a hesitant look on his face as he looked at the bodies of those Immortal Jellyfish.

If he put some souls into the bodies of these Immortal Jellyfish, they could be revived. Since they would be strong, with powerful assaulting capabilities, they could make excellent subordinates.

However, it was hard to upgrade the Immortal Substances’ levels. They could only upgrade when they absorbed another Immortal Substance.

Humans discovered that Turritopsis nutricula can have eternal life. That is to say, Immortal Jellyfish are evolved from Turritopsis nutricula.

“Dig a cave in one of the mountains and place them inside!” Wang Xian ordered the Nine Venomous Sea Snakes.

The Immortal Substance was a powerful existence. Coupling it with Soul Returning Branch, Wang Xian could build an undying jellyfish race.

As such, this was an extremely precious resource that could come in handy in the future.

Back in his bedroom, Wang Xian ordered a Venomous Sea Snake to hunt for food so that he could enjoy a table of seafood delicacy with Guan Shuqing, Lan Qingyue, and Sun Lingxiu.

The ingredients were made up of high-level marine creatures. If he brought it to First-grade Restaurant, someone would buy it even it was priced at ten million dollars. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Subsequently, Wang Xian stayed in the Dragon Palace for another two days while waiting for Prime Minister Turtle and the rest to resurrect.

On the third day, however, Lan Qingyue received a series of messages on her phone when she returned to the yacht to pass instructions for some development issues in Lan Family.

“What?”

When she read the messages, she was stunned. Immediately, she frowned and leaped into the sea back to the Dragon Palace.

“Xiao Yu, bad news! Xiao Yu is in trouble!”

“What?”

Wang Xian was enjoying his time on his bed when he heard the anxious voice of Lan Qingyue. He shot up and responded with a growing sullen expression on his face.

“Xiao Xian, these are the messages that Sect Leader Tang used to send with Elder Fang’s phone!”

Lan Qingyue handed the phone to Wang Xian with a stern look.

There were over ten messages with the first few talking about Xiao Yu and Elder Fang’s situation. They had been poisoned when they were sparring with someone. The injuries were severe, and Wang Xian was wanted as soon as possible.

The fact that the messages had been sent two days ago caused Wang Xian to darken his expression rapidly.

“Let’s go back now!”

Wang Xian could not wait for Prime Minister Turtle and the rest to resurrect. He quickly walked out of the Dragon Palace and headed for the yacht.

Guan Shuqing, Lan Qingyue, Sun Lingxiu, and Mo Qinglong all followed behind.

When Wang Xian went back to the room in the yacht, he picked up his phone on the table immediately.

He realized the phone had run out of battery, so he quickly connected it to the charger and turned it on.

There were over dozens of missed calls in which most of them were made by Sect Leader Tang. Wang Xian’s expression was even more sullen.

He quickly called back Sect Leader Tang of Thistles and Thorns Sect

“Miracle Doctor Wang, you finally...return my call!”

Sect Leader Tang’s old and tired voice was heard from the phone.
