Chapter 616: Wait While I Kill Them (3)

Several hundreds of thousands of disciples mumbled to themselves while staring at the chaotic area.

“Dead! The two of them must be dead by now!”

The group of supreme talents hid themselves a thousand meters above the ground. At this moment, Ge Wen’s expression softened a little.

He felt extremely embarrassed after being defeated by Roving Sword in two moves. However, fear gripped him when he saw Roving Sword killing four Elders and Ao Shuwen with a single strike.

He’s too strong! What he just displayed was even stronger and more terrifying than when he fought with me!

“Will they die?”

Xiaoxiao stared intensely below her and mumbled, “The Dragon King is just like he was in the real world. Incomparably arrogant with no regard for anyone!”

“That’s the real world and we are in Yong Chang World now. There’s no need to fear the Dragon King. Even if he’s a real dragon, we will subdue him here!”

Jin Jian stared below him and excitement flashed across his eyes.

“That’s right! How dare they kill the people from Yong Chang world. They deserve death!”

Ge Wen grinned hideously. Once the Dragon King and Roving Sword were dead, he would still be the strongest supreme talent in Yong Chang world and the strongest disciple of the three Immortal Sects!

Boom!

However, a terrifying golden longsword slashed across from the center of the explosion.

The golden longsword turned darker and extended to a thousand meters as it slashed ahead.

“What? They aren’t dead yet? Dodge! Dodge immediately!”

When the surrounding Elders from the three Immortal Sects saw the sudden appearance of the terrifying longsword, they shouted out loud.

“NO!”

However, the golden longsword slashed across in an instant. Next, several Elders fell towards the ground without even having the time to scream out in pain.

“What a terrifying attack. He is at least at the Half-step to Immortal Realm. Kill! Everyone attack him together!”

The Elders of the three Immortal Sects were astonished and shouted loudly.

“I had no intention to kill anyone initially. However, with things as such, let’s kill to our hearts’ content! Haha! Yong Chang world? So what?”

Wang Xian looked across the Elders who were charging towards him and broke into hysterical laughter.

“Kill!”

Roving Sword, who was standing beside him, moved.

“Dustless;

Soundless;

Breathless;

Shadowless;

Traceless;

Merciless!”

Voices without any emotion reverberated as Roving Sword’s longsword slashed across and penetrated the various terrifying attacks approaching him.

That terrifying golden longsword pierced through the bodies of six Elders frighteningly.

“What?”

Without making a sound, the six Elders fell towards the ground.

“What? How can this be possible?”

An Elder shouted in fear as his eyes widened in disbelief.

Six strikes and six Elders had fallen.

“Merciless Swordsmanship! He has made huge improvements in his Merciless Swordsmanship once again!” the Great Elder of Immortal Slaying Sect shouted with a horrified expression.

“Attack them together!”

Within a short period of time, Roving Sword had killed ten Elders. This had instilled fear in the hearts of all the Elders of the three Immortal Sects.

If they allowed him to continue attacking, their group wouldn’t be sufficient for Roving Sword to kill.

Moreover, what worried them the most was that the Dragon King hadn’t made a move.

If it was just as Xiaoxiao had mentioned, Roving Sword was just a subordinate of the Dragon King.

“This... This...”

The supreme talents could feel their scalps go numb from fear after seeing Roving Sword killing four Elders with a single strike.

This was followed closely by killing another six Elders with six moves of Merciless Swordsmanship.

Moreover, the attacks from their Elders towards the Dragon King were easily stopped by the surrounding water energy.

The strength of the two of them had shaken them to their cores.

If they were to fight Wang Xian and Roving Sword, they would have been killed instantly.

The group of supreme talents couldn’t help but retreat further.

“Grand Pyro Technique!”

“Sword Explosion!”

“Merciless Sword!”

Terrifying energies were released from the Elders of the three Immortal Sects. The next instant, terrifying battle techniques with catastrophic might were launched towards Wang Xian and Roving Sword.

One could tell how horrifying the attacks from over fifty Budding Realm experts were easily from how the colors of the sky had changed.

Even the surrounding atmosphere was exploding.

“Sword Alps!”

Seeing the attacks approaching him, Wang Xian smiled faintly and five longswords appeared around him.

Every sword was a piece of Level 12 spiritual equipment.

As the longswords rotated, the illusory image of Sword Alps appeared and shrouded Wang Xian within.

“Sword Break!”

Roving Sword was unmoved by the attacks as he swung the longsword in his hand.

Several broken swords appeared around him and met the terrifying energy of the approaching attacks.

Boom!

Explosions reverberated across. However, what embarrassed the crowd was that the blinding blue and golden light were still shining dazzlingly.

“Return Sword!” Roving Sword shouted emotionlessly and longswords formed around him.

“Shit! They are too strong! Avoid his longswords!” the Great Elder of the Immortal Slaying Sect shouted!

The expressions on the surrounding Elders changed drastically.

“Two people went against more than sixty Elders and were able to kill eleven. Is this even possible?”

“Oh gosh! The Elders are on the losing end! How can the two of them be so strong?”

“How could two people from the world experiencing the Age of Dharma Decline be so strong?”

Hundreds of thousands of disciples were watching the terrifying battle in the air with shock and fear.

Based on the information gathered by the Yong Chang Immortal Sect, shouldn’t the martial artists in the real world be trash?

However, what was happening before them seemed to suggest that the martial artists from the real world were all ferocious and mighty beasts!

“Shit!” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

At this instant, they saw Roving Sword slash and attack several Elders with his longsword once again.

Merciless Swordsmanship was considered the strongest sword technique by the Immortal Slaying Sect. Once it was used, there would be experts dying!

“How dare you kill in my Yong Chang! Do you know your sins?”

Ka ka!

Suddenly, a loud and clear voice reverberated from afar.

A blinding ball of fire fell on those longswords directly, disintegrating them!

“Sect Leader Hong Yan!”

“Hong Yan Excellency!”

When the Elders of the three Immortal Sects heard this voice, excitement beamed in their eyes as they greeted respectfully.

Mmm!

A figure appeared before the eyes of everyone as though he had teleported in instantly.

The illusory figure materialized gradually into a middle-aged man wearing a full suit of red armor.

From him, one could sense a warming sensation. He was also emitting a faint glow and personified the holiness of a sun.

He stared at Wang Xian and Roving Sword nonchalantly with spiritual equipment that resembled a sun above his head.

Hong Yan! Immortal Realm expert!

“Sect Leader, these two outsiders killed over ten Elders. Half a month ago, they also killed fifteen Budding Realm experts!”

An Elder from Yong Chang Immortal Sect glowered at Wang Xian with hatred and reported this information.

“Hong Yan Excellency, this man joined our Immortal Slaying Sect with ill intentions. Can we kindly ask for your help to cleanse the scourge from our Sect?” an Elder from Immortal Slaying Sect bowed immediately and asked.

“Hmm! For killing so many experts from our Yong Chang world, their sins warrant their deaths!”

Hong Yan nodded his head nonchalantly and raised a finger.
