2858 2858 he, we will definitely kill him! 3

Invincible in terms of battle techniques, the last disciple of the celestial emperor of Shangshui. At the same time, the Celestial Emperor of Shangshui was also a veteran celestial emperor of the eight barrens.

The celestial emperor of Shangshui was not the celestial emperor of the eight barrens, but he had some connections with the celestial emperor of the eight barrens. Their relationship was neither good nor bad!

However, he was still the last disciple of a celestial emperor.

They frowned slightly and stared coldly at Wang Xian. He did not expect that a young man would actually lure out the last disciples of the Holy Region and the Celestial Emperor of Shangshui.

!!

“Young master invincible of battle law, no one can kill our disciples and leave safely. If we let him leave, where will our reputation go?”

“Young master invincible of battle law, please don’t make things difficult for us. If we have no other choice, we can only offend him!”

Elder lie frowned and reminded invincible of the situation.

At this moment, hundreds of people had gathered in the surroundings. Experts from the eight desolates, six directions, and other domains had gathered. If they were to let go of someone who had killed their disciple, they would really lose all their face.

At that time, others would say that they, eight desolates, were timid and afraid of trouble.

After all, invincible battle technique only had a divine emperor behind him. The strength of a saint domain was also weaker than their, eight desolates.

“Offend? I also want to say this to you now. If you don’t give up, then I can only offend you!”

Invincible battle technique’s face also revealed a cold expression. With a wave of his arm, water rings appeared in his hands.

Each water ring contained a terrifying power.

This power made everyone’s heart palpitate slightly.

“That’s… That’s the divine weapon used by God Emperor Shangshui in the past!”

“It’s the heavy water ring, it was a famous God weapon before the upper water god Emperor became a god Emperor. It’s said that this god weapon is extremely powerful and has its own intelligence. Who would have thought that it would be in the hands of an invincible warrior!”

“Hiss, such a treasure, it can allow an invincible warrior to fight above his level, it can even fight against a pinnacle undying god King!”

When the heavy water ring appeared, everyone was shocked, their faces filled with shock.

The expressions of the experts of the eight desolates also changed greatly, and their expressions became slightly ugly.

“Invincible in battle techniques, are you going to become enemies with our eight desolates? Have you considered the consequences?”

Elder Zhou stared at invincible in battle techniques with a face full of killing intent as he growled in a low voice.

The gazes of the other experts of the eight desolates were also cold.

“I don’t care what you all are. If you dare to touch my invincible boss in battle techniques, then ask me if I agree!”

“Big Brother Invincible, let’s… Let’s not get involved in this matter!”

A few youths from the side who followed invincible shouted anxiously.

At this moment, their foreheads were filled with cold sweat. The other party was an elder of the eight desolates. That youth had killed the eight desolates’disciple.

This was not a small matter!

Once invincible battle technique was involved, if he really angered the eight barrens, even the divine emperor of Shangshui might not be able to do anything about it.

At that time, there would be big trouble.

“Invincible, you, you… you have to think carefully!”

When Tian Xin saw this scene, her expression changed slightly, and she wanted to fly towards him.

“Junior sister, let’s not get involved. Invincible battle technique is a troublemaker!”

Behind her, a middle-aged man immediately grabbed Tian Xin’s arm and shook his head at her.

“Miss, the opponent is eight desolates. If we really anger eight desolates, even the god Emperor of Shangshui will have to pay a price!”

Another middle-aged man hurriedly said to Tian Xin.

“This…”

Tian Xin revealed an anxious expression and looked at invincible in front of her uneasily.

“It’s fine. I want to see who would dare to touch boss Wang with me around! HMPH!”

Invincible battle technique said to Tian Xin and the rest. He snorted softly and stared at the disciples of the eight barrens.

“Boss Wang, look for an opportunity to escape. I’ll help you fend them off!”

At the same time, invincible battle technique sent a voice transmission to Wang Xian. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Wang Xian looked at invincible battle technique in front of him and then looked at ye Lui Ying and the rest of his senior brothers and sisters. A faint smile appeared on his face.

Currently, he had the combat strength of a celestial thearch. However, his injuries were too severe after being attacked by the tree.

His injuries from the last time would recover in a day.

Now, it would take at least a month.

This was secondary. Currently, his combat strength was only around level nine of a celestial thearch.

Of course, when he unleashed his full strength, the offensive strength of a celestial thearch could still be unleashed for a period of time.

However, after he unleashed his full strength, there was no doubt that his injuries were even more serious.

Therefore, he didn’t think it was necessary. The Heaven Array Eight Qi would be here soon.

He just needed to wait here.

Furthermore, seeing some fleas jumping around in front of him, he treated them as if they were monkeys!

His battle techniques were unbeatable, just like before. He was very loyal.

In the past, when he was being hunted down, this kid had helped him a few times.

He remembered this favor in his heart.

The actions of Ye Lui Ying and her fellow disciples surprised Wang Xian a little. Facing a power like the bhang, they actually dared to stand in front of him.

A person he could befriend!

Just like what a rich second generation on earth had said in the past.

I don’t look at other people’s wealth when I make friends. In any case, they are not as rich as me!

Wang Xian was the same now. I don’t look at other people’s strength when I make friends. In any case, they are not as strong as me!

Of course, these words were a little arrogant. However, he had the right to say so when he looked at the bright starry sky.

“Phew!”

Beside Wang Xian, Ye lui Ying and the rest heaved a sigh of relief when they saw the invincible battle technique appearing.

His appearance could greatly reduce their pressure.

“Boom Boom Boom!”

“HMPH, there’s no need to talk nonsense with him. He killed our disciples of the eight barrens and killed them directly. Who cares what faction he belongs to. Moreover, he killed our disciples. We of the eight barrens should ask the holy region and the god Emperor of Shangshui if they want to start a war!”

However, at this moment, a voice filled with dignity sounded.

Upon hearing this voice, the experts from the eight barrens immediately revealed respectful expressions.

“Protector!”

Elder Zhou, elder lie, and the others immediately shouted respectfully.

“Buzz Buzz Buzz!”

At this moment, three figures rushed over.

Three old men. The old man in the middle held a horsetail whisk in his hand and had a cold expression on his face.

The other two also contained a terrifying pressure.

Three Peak King God realm experts and three barren guardians!

His words caused everyone’s expressions to change drastically.

The people around were not too surprised by the arrival of barren guardians.

This was because there were already guardians in the windless forest. When the signal flare rose into the sky, barren guardians would be able to rush over during this period of time.

However, what everyone did not expect was that protector eight desolation was so powerful.

He wanted to kill that youth and question the sacred region’s upper water god Emperor if they were going to start a war.

As protectors of eight desolation, they were already at the top of eight desolation. They also had the qualifications to say such words.

This was especially so for the elder holding a horsetail whisk in the middle. He was the descendant of a god Emperor of eight desolation.

“F * ck, boss Wang, we are preparing to escape!”

When invincible battle technique saw guardian eight barrens coming over, his expression changed drastically as he said anxiously.
