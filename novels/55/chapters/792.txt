Translator: 549690339 Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Kill, Kill, Kill!”

“You leave first, we will kill!”

In seven cities, seven Dragon Gate Forges were located. Apart from the Dragon Gate forges in the Xia Ding region, which had been destroyed in an instant.

In the rest of the cities, a group of DRAKONIDS began to fight.

Most of the people sent by Wang Xian to guard the Dragon Gate forges were Drakonids who had never died before.

Most of the more than thirty drakonids who were subdued by the chaotic sea region were sent to guard the workshop.

However, there were also a few of the first batch of DRAKONIDS who had died once. However, this was only a small number of them!

The instantaneous outbreak of the battle caused all the disciples of the immortal sect who were preparing to enter the Dragon Gate forging workshop to reveal shocked expressions.

“Quick, quick, retreat! Retreat to the back!”

“It’s the experts of the Saint Medicine Immortal sect. All of them are at the infant realm. They are completely making an enemy out of the Dragon Gate!”

“They are directly sending over a dozen infant realm experts to attack the Dragon Gate forging workshop. Oh My God, the Saint Medicine Immortal sect is taking revenge!”

The group of disciples of the Immortal sect hurriedly retreated to the back. They looked at the over a dozen infant realm experts attacking the four members of the Dragon Gate.

“Kill!”

However, what shocked everyone was that not a single one of the four Dragon Gate members escaped. Instead, they instantly erupted with terrifying strength and charged forward.

This caused everyone to suck in a breath of cold air.

“Are the people of the Dragon Gate Crazy? Instead of escaping, they’re directly fighting to the death. This is completely not on the same level. The difference in numbers is too great!”

“Look at their attacks. The members of the Dragon Gate are risking their lives!”

All the disciples of the immortal gate were shocked when they saw the members of the Dragon Gate fighting to the death.

An infant stage powerhouse did not run away when he had the chance to run away. He was fighting to the death with his opponent. This kind of meaningless attitude was rarely achieved.

In fact, very few people even dared to do this when they knew that they would be killed if they didn’t run.

But the DRAKONIDS did!

First, they were 100% obedient and didn’t fear death.

Second, they had the chance to be resurrected.

Therefore, those drakonids who had never died attacked without fear of death.

“Haha, You Still Dare to attack us? You’re simply courting death. In the future, there will be no place for Your Dragon Gate to stand in the Jianghu!”

The group of experts from the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect laughed out loud with cold expressions.

The four DRAKONIDS didn’t have the slightest fluctuation on their faces. They wore a set of grade-12 spirit weapon and were going all out!

This caused the expressions of the group of experts from the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect to slightly change, and they surrounded and attacked with vigilant expressions.

The Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect was still fine, but the expression of the expert from the Strange Thorn clan was extremely unsightly.

Seven or eight infant realm experts from the Thorn clan were more than enough to destroy a shop.

However, the Thorn clan didn’t expect the DRAKONIDS to fight back with their lives.

Two infant realm experts against one could completely suppress them.

However, they were drakonids, and they were wearing a set of grade-12 spirit tools. Two against one, they could barely draw.

This shocked the assassin.

However, what made them even more terrified was that the other party didn’t seem to fear death at all. As long as they could seriously injure their opponent, even if they were stabbed with a dagger, they wouldn’t dodge.

They were fighting with their lives.

The disciples of the immortal sect who were watching from the surroundings also had shocked expressions on their faces.

“The experts of the Dragon Gate are too terrifying. They actually gave up their lives to fight!”

Some of the experts of the immortal sect gulped as they watched in horror.

The battle didn’t last very long. The entire battle could be described as tragic.

There was death without life. There really was death without life!

Out of the dragon people of the seven cities, only nine survived and eighteen died.

The only one that was safe in the Dragon Gate forging workshop was the forging workshop next to the Soup Cauldron area.

That was also because during the battle, the Natural Born Immortal sect experts were by the side, protecting the entire forging workshop with thorns.

The rest of the Dragon Gate forging workshop was directly turned into ruins.

This news quickly spread to the jianghu web, instantly causing a sensation in the entire jianghu.

In the ancient street of Jiang City, five minutes after the Dragon Gate forging workshop was attacked, he also received a message from Mo Qinglong.

“Nine of the Dragonmen survived. The rest died in battle. The ones who died were all Dragonmen who didn’t die once. However, only one of our forging workshops survived!”

Mo Qinglong reported to Wang Xian with an embarrassed expression.

None of them expected that after the heaven’s pride competition ended, the Holy Doctor, Holy Medicine, and Immortal sect would send out 50 to 60 infant stage or even half-step immortal god powerhouses to take revenge on the Dragon Gate.

Under the circumstances where the dragon sect had displayed such strength, they still dared to start a war.

“Holy Doctor Holy Medicine Immortal Sect?”

Wang Xian’s eyes flashed with a bone-piercing coldness as he asked coldly, “How much of the medicinal pills and spiritual artifacts were lost?”

“Dragon King, this time, it wasn’t just the Holy Doctor Holy Medicine Immortal sect that took action. There was also the Strange Thorn clan. The Strange Thorn clan belonged to the assassin clan, and half of the medicinal pills and spiritual artifacts were lost!”

Mo Qinglong said in a deep voice.

“Eighteen drakonids were killed and six forging workshops were destroyed. Very good, very good!”

“Holy Doctor and Holy Medicine Immortal Sect, the treacherous Thorn clan!”

Wang Xian’s eyes were filled with killing intent. “Ao Jian, go to the Dragon Palace and ask Prime Minister Gui to announce the emergence of the Dragon Palace!”

“Ao Yao, go back and bring all your treacherous demon clan here. Also, bring all your Golden Swordfish clan’s infant stage clansmen here!”

“Since they want to play, let’s play with them. Once the nine-headed Hui breaks through...”

“I don’t care about your immortal agreement!”

“It’s the Dragon King!”

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Ao Yao and Ao Jian stood in front of Wang Xian and said respectfully.

“Little Xian, is the Dragon Palace about to appear?”

Beside them, Xiao Yu, Lan Qingyue, and the other girls frowned slightly and asked in surprise.

The Dragon Palace was located in the ocean. Even to the immortal sects, it was a place of miracles.

They were not prepared to make the dragon palace appear when they did not have absolute power.

“The Dragon Palace will appear sooner or later in the war with the Holy Doctor, Holy Medicine, Immortal sect, and the Thorn tribe. Now is the perfect time!”

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered. Although the nine-headed Hui had not broken through yet, it was about time for the Dragon Palace to appear.

“It’s good that it’s happening now. We have to let all the immortal sects know that we are not to be trifled with. Those who dare to provoke US will have to pay a heavy price!”

Xiao Yu and the other girls also spoke with frosty expressions.

This time, the Holy Doctor, Holy Medicine, Immortal Sect, and the Strange Thorn tribe had destroyed six dragon gate forging workshops and killed eighteen drakonids.

In addition, they had also killed more than a hundred ordinary workers hired by the shop.

They would have to pay an unimaginable price for this grudge.

Ao Jian and Ao Yao left and flew toward the Dragon Palace.

When they returned, not only would there be the two of them, but there would also be the terrifying race of the Dragon Palace.

The Dragon Palace would appear!

It would be like an immortal sect, appearing in front of the world!
