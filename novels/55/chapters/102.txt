“Get Brother Panther here!”

The middle-aged man who was standing in the middle told a young man. A dozen people did not make a move against Wang Xian.

“Lad, there are not many fearless people like you. Aren’t you afraid of death?”

The middle-aged man threw a glance at the dreadful Fifth Master Gong before he spoke to Wang Xian while staring at him.

“Heh, just a few of you?” Wang Xian sneered at them.

The middle-aged man raised his eyebrows as he looked at the young man in front of him with bewilderment.

Fearless and composed, disregarding all of them.

An ordinary young man could not possibly possess such a demeanor. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The middle-aged man, unlike Fifth Master Gong, knew how to think. The young man in front of him must have some backings.

However...

He took out a cigarette casually and lit it. “Lad, arrogant people will not have good endings!”

Once Brother Panther arrived, this lad would have to pay the price regardless of how formidable he was.

On the other hand, a young man trotted to a private room along with a security guard of the pub.

“Brother Panther, someone beat our buddies up.” As soon as the door was opened, that young man quickly reported to the middle-aged man inside.

“What?” There were about six people in the room. The one who was known as Brother Panther was rather muscular. He was slightly stunned before he stood up.

“Where are they?” Brother Panther calmly asked.

“They are in the pub now. Fifth Master Gong fought with two young men, and he got beaten up badly!” the young man replied at once.

“Oh? In my pub?” A young man sitting in the middle lifted his chin puzzledly. With a smile, he said, “Interesting. Let’s check it out!”

“Brother Panther, Second Master, the one who beat Fifth Master Gong was a juvenile. He is formidable. He can send a person flying with just a kick,” said the young man at the side.

“Regardless of how formidable he is, I’ll not let him off for beating up my buddy!” Brother Panther said coldly. He turned to the young man at the side, “Second Master, sorry to cause you trouble over here.”

“It’s all right!”

The young man gestured as he did not seem to be bothered by it. Looked like he was in a good mood today!

“Fine, I want to see who dares to lay his finger on my buddy!”

Seeing that Second Master was not mindful, cold radiance flashed in Brother Panther’s eyes as he looked at the place where people were gathering. He bellowed, “How dare he beat up my people. Let me see how formidable he is!”

The surrounding people were shocked as they quickly turned around and looked at the source of the voice.

“It’s Brother Panther, Brother Panther!”

“It’s really Brother Panther. I guess that juvenile is doomed!”

Some people exchanged whispers in fear when they saw Brother Panther walking over.

As Wang Dahai listened to the whispers around him, he displayed an anxious look on his face as he clenched his fists tightly.

Wang Xian watched the approaching people emotionlessly. But he raised his eyebrow when he spotted someone.

The Second Master who was next to Brother Panther froze as the smile on his face slowly disappeared.

“Were you the one who hit my buddy?” Brother Panther glared at Wang Xian coldly as he pointed his finger at him.

“Brother Panther, it was him. Brother Panther, you must avenge me!” Fifth Master Gong, who was lying in a pool of blood, said with a hideous face.

However, the Second Master who was standing beside Brother Panther quickly trotted towards Wang Xian while they were exchanging conversations.

“Young Master Wang, I did not expect to see you here. This is my fault.” The Second Master ran over and greeted him with fear. He was gritting his teeth.

Damm, this bunch of useless things!

He called some friends here for a celebration as he managed to pull some strings with Wang Xian. Never did he expect that he would encounter such a thing.

He swept his gaze across Fifth Master Gong, who was lying on the floor, with a strong desire to destroy him for good!

“It’s nothing. I just fought with some of them. I’ll leave this in your hands. My friend and I will go back now. Let’s meet for lunch someday,” said Wang Xian to the young man before him, who was the Director Sun he’d met yesterday. Wang Xian peered at Wang Dahai, who was looking worried and gloomy.

“Yes, Young Master Wang. Leave this to me, and I’ll make sure you’re happy with the outcome.” Director Sun nodded hastily in assurance.

“Okay!” Wang Xian nodded. He walked to Wang Dahai and said, “Let’s go, Dahai!”

Wang Dahai was stunned as he followed Wang Xian outside in bewilderment.

Everyone was stunned!

What’s going on?

Brother Panther was dumbfounded too when he saw the Second Master running to the juvenile and speaking to him respectfully.

Eventually, he witnessed the departure of the juvenile.

He had a mixed expression when he saw the juvenile walking past him.

But he remained silent as Second Master walked towards him.

“Second Master, he... he...” Brother Panther pointed shockingly at the juvenile who left.

Director Sun took out a cigarette slowly. “Panther, don’t you know how to manage your subordinates?”

Brother Panther froze as he panicked while looking at Director Sun. “Second Master, what have I done wrong? Please... let me know...”

“Break their limbs and make sure they disappear from Rivertown. Teach these three girls a lesson too,” Director Sun said slowly.

What Director Sun said shocked everyone around him.

What’s going on? Why did the Second Master give such instructions?

That juvenile?

“I know you have a lot of questions in your head. What’s the reason for the celebration tonight?” Director Sun looked at Brother Panther and asked impassively.

“Because... Because you befriended such a formidable expert.” As Brother Panther spoke, his eyes were agape. “Second Master, could that juvenile be...”

Director Sun nodded his head slowly. “I wish I could save some face for you. But it was your men who courted their own death!”

Brother Panther was appalled as trepidation filled his eyes.

Today, Second Master Sun had invited them out to have some drinks. Obviously, he was in a chirpy mood. Hence, they were puzzled and asked him about it.

In the end, the Second Master told them proudly that he had befriended a formidable person who was one of the supreme people in the entire Rivertown.

His remark shocked them. They would look up to anyone who was favored by the Second Master.

On top of that, the Second Master made another remark which startled them the most.

He was someone who could make Old Qin bow and apologize.

They were unable to stay composed after hearing these words. That person is Old Qin!

The Second Master could enjoy his current status because he worked for the Qin Family.

“I know what to do!” Brother Panther took a deep breath and stared coldly at the Fifth Master Gong. “Fifth Master Gong, you’re gonna get us killed.”

“Break their limbs!”

A resentful bellow shocked the rest of the bar.

What’s the situation now?

Fifth Master Gong and his bunch of friends, including the three girls, stared at Brother Panther with disbelief and despair.

“Is it over?” asked Wang Dahai, who was following behind Wang Xian as he looked over his shoulder dumbfoundedly.

“Yes, it’s over. What else do you want?”

All of a sudden, Wang Dahai hugged Wang Xian and cried.

“Sob sob, Old Wang, I’m out of love. Out of love! I never thought that Rongrong was such a person!”
