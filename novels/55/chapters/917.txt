Translator: 549690339

“Captain Huan Hai, what are you trying to do?”

Wang Xian flew into the sky and stared coldly at the captain of Huan Hai’s mercenary group, Xiu Qianshan.

“Dragon King!”

The group of Golden Swordfish immediately flew to Wang Xian’s side and stared coldly at Xiu Qianshan.

“Hehe, Kid, there’s no need to be so nervous. It’s just killing a ferocious beast!”

When Xiu Qianshan saw Wang Xian and the rest staring at him vigilantly, some of the mercenary groups around him turned their attention to him. Their expressions changed and they chuckled.

“If you want to ambush me, I’ll just say it. As the leader of a 5-star silver-grade mercenary group and an extraordinary level 6 powerhouse, is there a need to find so many reasons? We both know that we have a grudge against each other!”

Wang Xian stared at Xiu Qianshan coldly and said with some disdain.

“Hehe!”

Xiu Qianshan’s expression turned cold when he heard his words. He licked his lips and said, “So what if I want to kill you? Just you wait, Kid. If you kill a member of My Mirage Sea mercenary group, I will definitely take your dog life!”

Xiu Qianshan stared at Wang Xian coldly. Dozens of members of the Mirage Sea mercenary group flew to his side and stared at Wang Xian and the rest coldly.

“Huh? What Happened?”

“Why did the leader of the Mirage Sea mercenary group suddenly attack that young man? Could it be that they have a deep grudge against each other? They actually attacked during the siege?”

“This... Xiu Qianshan actually wanted to kill that young man!”

“It seems like the Immortal Phoenix mercenary group killed a member of a small team of the Mirage Sea mercenary group. Xiu Qianshan wanted revenge. However, now that the sneak attack has been discovered, even if Xiu Qianshan was stronger than that young man, it would be difficult to kill him!”

The people who were fighting around them were shocked when they saw the illusionary sea mercenary group suddenly confronting the Immortal Phoenix mercenary group.

The illusionary sea mercenary group was one of the top five mercenary groups in Shenghai Town. The Immortal Phoenix mercenary group had shone brilliantly today.

The confrontation between the two powerful mercenary groups in Shenghai town instantly attracted everyone’s attention.

“Kill me. You are not qualified to do so!”

Wang Xian stared at Xiu Qianshan coldly and said coldly.

“Don’t worry. I will step on your corpse soon. Everyone in Your Celestial Phoenix mercenary group will die!”

Xiu Qianshan emitted a strong murderous aura as he growled with confidence.

His current position was too close to the city gate and was surrounded by ferocious beasts.

If Wang Xian and the rest wanted to escape, he didn’t have the confidence to stop them. After the failed sneak attack, he didn’t attack again!

“Kid, just you wait!”

A goldfish rushed towards him. Xiu Qianshan waved the long saber in his hand and a terrifying saber radiance gathered. When it landed on the goldfish, it exploded instantly.

Immediately, blood splattered everywhere. Xiu Qianshan smiled menacingly.

“Go!”

He snorted coldly and waved his saber to attack the surrounding golden machetes.

“The Immortal Phoenix mercenary group actually provoked the Mirage Sea mercenary group. Next, that young man is in Big Trouble!”

“Yeah, a genius who hasn’t grown up is no different from an ordinary person.”

Some of the surrounding members of the mercenary group looked over and discussed in a low voice.

“Are we waiting?”

Wang Xian looked at the mirage sea mercenary group that had once again charged into the group of Golden Swordfish. His dragon aura slowly spread to the surroundings.

In an instant, all the extraordinary level one and level two golden swordfish within a radius of 1,000 meters instantly attacked them.

A few thousand golden swordfish charged over, but it did not cause any chaos in the mirage sea mercenary group.

“You dare to threaten me? Attack!”

Wang Xian moved his body and dashed towards the mirage sea mercenary group at a terrifying speed.

Ao Jian and the rest followed closely behind, their faces filled with killing intent.

They had to take revenge on the spot.

If it wasn’t inconvenient to expose Ao Yao and the rest directly, everyone in the Mirage Sea mercenary group would be dead by now.

But even so, they were fast!

“Endless Sight!”

“Golden Sword Thrust!”

The eleven golden swordfish instantly unleashed their strongest abhijna. Their bodies were like longswords as they directly attacked the Mirage Sea mercenary group.

“They actually dare to attack us!”

The Mirage Sea mercenary group, who was killing the Golden Swordfish, had a change in expression as anger appeared on their faces.

It was especially so for Xiu Qianshan. He was like a tiger that had been angered by a monkey. His body was filled with a murderous aura.

He had already allowed him to live for a few more days when he did not continue to attack earlier. Now, he actually dared to retaliate.

“You’re courting death! Kill them all!”

Xiu Qianshan shouted angrily. This time, he did not conceal his anger at all. His body was emitting a terrifying murderous aura.

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly. In an instant, the group of golden mackerel fish around the mirage sea mercenary group seemed to have gone crazy.

They jumped up and attacked everyone in the Mirage Sea mercenary group without any fear of death.

In an instant, more than 2,000 goldfish attacked without any fear of death. Although their strength was below level three of the supernatural realm, they still had to defend with all their might.

Boom! Boom! Boom

In an instant, a strong defense burst out from their bodies. The Sword Gleam of the goldfish landed in front of them and was blocked.

However, this did not make the golden blade fish give up on attacking. Their bodies flew over and chopped off their kitchen knife-like arms.

“Scram!”

The members of the Mirage Sea mercenary group felt their bodies shake and immediately scattered the group of golden blade fish.

However, following that, another wave of golden blade fish’s attack arrived.

“What’s going on?”

A member of the Mirage Sea mercenary group had a slight change in expression. They could clearly feel that the surrounding golden blade fish were suddenly going all out.

It was as though they would slash them even if they were to die.

This made them flustered.

“Quick, Dodge!”

At this moment, the furious roar of Xiu Qianshan could be heard. However, it was over.

Wang Xian couldn’t see everything clearly. The golden sword spikes of the Golden Swordfish had already landed on the bodies of the Mirage Sea mercenary group.

“Scram!”

A captain of the Mirage Sea mercenary group looked at the flames that were attacking him. At the same time, his body was emitting terrifying flames that burned the golden swordfish around him to death. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

He grunted coldly and held his flaming long saber with both hands. He swung it at an unending line of sight.

Boom

The Flames resisted the flames. The result was that the flames on the team leader’s body became even more intense!

“Ah!”

A miserable scream was heard.

“Ah Ah Ah!”

Following that, another four or five miserable screams were heard from the surroundings.

“Phoenix mercenary group, you’re Courting Death!”

A terrifying blade ray was attacking Wang Xian. His face was solemn as he landed on the ground quickly. A huge wooden shield was used to block the attack.

Boom

The wooden shield exploded and completely neutralized the blade ray.

The sudden outbreak of the battle shocked everyone once again. Their faces were filled with shock.

“D * mn, what’s Going On? Why did the Celestial Phoenix mercenary group suddenly attack the Mirage Sea mercenary group? !”

“This... This is going to be an all-out battle. However, the immortal Phoenix mercenary group’s strength is obviously much weaker than the mirage sea mercenary group!”

Everyone hurriedly looked over and widened their eyes.

The Mirage Sea mercenary group leader’s sneak attack on that youth was unsuccessful. In the end, they had just left when they were instantly ambushed by that youth. was there a need to be so violent?
