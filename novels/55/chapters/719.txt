“Who is causing trouble in yellow sky city, courting death!”

The shout attracted the attention of more than half of the people in Yellow Sky City. The experts from Yellow Sky Gate who did not know what was happening on the other streets were also slightly curious, and their eyes revealed a trace of coldness.

“Yellow Sky City will soon welcome the people in the real world. The issue of public security can not be neglected. who dares to cause trouble here!”

Some of the higher-ups of the immortal sects also moved and flew towards the direction where the guards of the Yellow Sky City were flying towards.

In an instant, dozens of experts at the Dan stage flew over.

“Outsiders? They dare to play around here?”

The group of Yellow Sky City guards who flew over saw the clothes Xiao Yu was wearing and the people on the ground who were trapped by his bone whip. Their eyes flashed with killing intent.

“Quickly save Ling Tian! Ling Tian is being controlled by this witch! Hurry up and kill her!”

The Scream of a girl could be heard and the girl who was standing beside Feng Lingtian shouted loudly.

“What? Crown Prince!”

The group of Yellow Heaven City guards were stunned and immediately looked towards Feng Lingtian.

At this moment, Feng Lingtian was in an extremely sorry state and there were many wounds on his buttocks. It was impossible to tell that he was their crown prince.

However, the few spirit swords on the side allowed them to recognize that he was their crown prince!

Everyone’s expression changed drastically, and their faces immediately sank. “Attacking the crown prince, and you guys are still watching from the surroundings. You deserve to die!”

The surrounding immortal sect disciples and family members were stunned. They opened their mouths, wanting to explain.

“You dare to attack our crown prince? You’re courting death!”

At this moment, the surrounding immortal sect experts flew over. When they heard the voice, their faces were filled with shock. Terrifying energy instantly erupted from their bodies, and the spirit tools in their hands emitted a sharp light.

“Everyone, our eldest princess is merely sparring with him. Don’t be so anxious!”

At this moment, the ten drakonids saw the aura of the surrounding people. Their bodies moved, and they stood in a circle around Xiao Yu with smiles on their faces.

The aura of an infant realm expert was slowly emitted.

“Eh?”

Sensing the aura of the ten drakonids, everyone around them was slightly shocked. Their faces revealed a grave expression.

The atmosphere instantly froze. The eyes of the experts from the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect around them revealed a cold look as killing intent brewed in the air.

“What are you all so nervous about? I’m just sparring with this fellow. It’s not my first time sparring!”

Feeling the atmosphere around him, Xiao Yu chuckled. With a flick of his arm, he pulled the bound Feng Lingtian up and stared at him. “Are we sparring? Look at how nervous the people here are!”

“This isn’t sparring. This is... This Is...”

“Pa!”

Feng Lingtian’s face was unyielding as he glared furiously at Xiao Yu.

However, before he could finish his words, a bone whip struck his butt.

“Ah, F * CK, is this a spar or a spar? I say, great aunt, I admit defeat, I admit defeat!”

Being directly whipped on his buttocks in public, Feng Lingtian was so aggrieved that he almost wanted to cry. He immediately begged for mercy.

“You still dare to hit our Crown Prince!”

An elder revealed an angry expression when he saw this scene. He was about to attack.

“Wait!”

At this moment, a figure flew over and shouted.

“Elder Feng!”

Everyone saw the old man and shouted respectfully.

“En!”

Feng Jin Qing nodded slowly and looked towards the street.

When he saw Feng Ling Tian who was tied up by the bone whip, his mouth could not help but Twitch.

He looked at Xiao Yu with a bitter expression, “This lady, we meet again!”

“Hello, Old Man!”

Xiao Yu looked at Feng Jin Qing’s gentle expression and smiled politely at him.

“This, Miss, can you let our Crown Prince Go First?”

Feng Jin Qing looked at Feng Ling Tian’s body and heaved a sigh of relief. His brows twitched.

The surrounding Yellow Heaven City guards and the experts from the immortal sects were stunned when they saw that elder Feng knew this young lady. They then looked at their crown prince.

It looked like his clothes were badly beaten, but in fact, they were all superficial wounds. He would be able to recover very quickly without taking medicine.

This made them slightly sigh in relief. They stared at them with sparkling eyes.

The ten infant realm experts called the young girl the eldest princess. This young girl’s strength was at least at the peak of the infant realm. It was unknown which powerful force she came from!

“Hehe, we’re just sparring. Don’t worry, we won’t be too harsh!”

Xiao Yu smiled a little embarrassedly. After all, the other party’s parents had come.

The corners of Feng Lingtian’s mouth couldn’t help but Twitch as he stared at Xiao Yu innocently. “I say, you witch, I didn’t provoke you this time. Why did you hit me?”

“Who said you didn’t provoke me?”

Xiao Yu was a little angry when she heard Feng Lingtian’s words and glared at him.

Feng Lingtian was shocked and quickly took two steps back. He stared at him with vigilance. “If you have something to say, let’s talk it out properly. A gentleman will use his words but not his hands!” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

The thousands of people around saw the cowardly look of their immortal sect’s crown prince and the corner of their mouths twitched. F * * K, was this still the fearless crown prince that no one dared to provoke in the Yellow Cauldron World?

“This is my martial nephew, the disciple of my elder brother. Just now, I heard a group of you surrounding him and asking him to sell the Feng Qing Pill to you. If he doesn’t sell it to you, he will be in trouble in the future.”

“I said, you are still the crown prince of some Yellow Heaven Immortal sect. If I don’t beat you up, who will? Are you bullying my martial nephew?”

Xiao Yu glared at Feng Lingtian and pointed at Xiao ran.

Feng Lingtian looked over and looked at Xiao ran. Everyone’s gaze was also on Xiao ran.

They knew this youth. He was the only genius disciple who had joined their Yellow Heaven Immortal sect in the real world.

He was only eighteen years old and already had the strength of the Dan stage. He was extremely terrifying.

“Your brother’s disciple, f * ck!”

Feng Lingtian almost vomited blood when he heard this. He knew what kind of existence the witch’s brother was.

That was an immortal-level existence. Why do you think your brother’s disciple came to his Yellow Heaven Immortal sect?

“I’m Master’s in-name disciple. Master said that in the future, he would let me explore on my own!”

Xiao ran bowed to Feng Lingtian with a strange expression.

This aunt-master of his was too powerful!

Elder Feng, who was standing in the sky, was also stunned.

“The disciple of the Dragon King!”

A trace of seriousness flashed in Feng Jinqing’s eyes.

The Dragon King of the Dragon Gate!

After the Nine Cauldrons appeared in different worlds, all the immortal sects had some understanding of the real world.

Most of the immortal sects had also heard of the Dragon Gate and the Dragon King, but after understanding their strength, they basically threw it to the back of their minds.

That was because they only knew that the Dragon Gate had about ten infant realm experts, and the Dragon King was very powerful.

But in the eyes of the high and mighty immortal sects, it was not worth mentioning, because only immortals and immortal sects could make them take them seriously.

Therefore, the news about the Dragon Gate and the Dragon King did not even reach the immortals and many disciples of the immortal sects.
