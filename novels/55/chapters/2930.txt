Chapter 2931: conquering machine imperial region 6

“Hahaha, creator, I, Dragon King, will be challenging you today. Let me see your strength!”

Deep in the machine imperial region, there was a dense army of machine imperial region. There were countless mechanical planets, battleships, mechs, and mechs.

Wang Xian stared at the largest battleship in the distance. The creator on the machine imperial ship was filled with a strong fighting spirit. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

According to the information from the glazed domain, the creator’s strength had already reached the third level of the void God Emperor Realm.

And the glazed domain Lord believed that the creator’s strength was inferior to his own.

In that case, Wang Xian was confident in killing the creator.

He stared at the creator and smiled. The incorporeal holy wings appeared behind him as he charged forward at a terrifying speed.

“HMPH, Dragon King of the Dragon Palace!”

The eyes of the creator who was standing on the mechanical imperial cruiser were filled with a cold glint. He moved his body and clenched his fists slowly as he struck towards the void.

Crack Crack Crack

The resplendent gemstones on his arms emitted a dazzling luster.

A fist condensed from lightning struck towards Wang Xian.

Whoosh

Wang Xian flapped his wings slightly and easily dodged the creator’s attack. In the blink of an eye, he arrived in front of the mechanical imperial cruiser.

“What! What a terrifying speed! It’s five times faster than mine!”

When the creator saw Wang Xian easily dodging his attack, he calculated his speed in his eyes and his expression changed drastically!

Staring at Wang Xian who was charging at him at an extremely fast speed, he waved his arm!

Crack! Crack! Crack

On the mechanical imperial cruiser below, countless cannon holes rose up.

“Da-da-da-da!”

“WHOOSH WHOOSH WHOOSH!”

A group of cannonballs with unparalleled secret manuals bombarded Wang Xian. Under these countless cannonballs, even a mosquito could be crushed.

Special Metal Bullets, a variety of attributes of the laser, full of destruction.

“Well, creator, you think you can stop me with your technological weapons?”

Wang Xian had a mocking expression on his face. Two dragon horns slowly grew out of his head.

The dragon horns emitted a light and dark color. A Taiji diagram appeared in front of Wang Xian.

“Bang! Bang! Bang!”

All the attacks landed on the Taiji diagram and were easily blocked.

“Clang!”

“This dragon king has such terrifying strength!”

The creator’s expression changed drastically. He immediately retreated and a lightning longsword that was more than ten meters long appeared in his hand.

“Crackle!”

He waved his arm and bolts of lightning struck toward Wang Xian.

“Crack! Crack! Crack!”

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

At the same time, all the weapons on the entire mechanical imperial cruiser were aimed at Wang Xian.

The entire mechanical imperial cruiser was sufficient to kill a level two void God realm existence.

However, such weapons were not of much use to Wang Xian.

All the attacks in front of him landed on the Taiji diagram and only caused some ripples.

“Eh? This creator’s attack isn’t very strong either!”

Wang Xian saw the attack of the Thunderbolt Longsword landing in front of him. He raised his eyebrows slightly.

“If this is all you have, creator, then go to Hell!”

Wang Xian’s body shook as he extended his right hand.

“Dragon Claw!”

He growled in a low voice as his entire right arm turned into a dragon claw.

“Dragon Kingdom in the Palm!”

Wang Xian growled again. His entire palm instantly enlarged to the size of a few million kilometers.

“Bang!”

The entire dragon claw directly attacked the mechanical imperial cruiser below.

Crack! Crack! Crack

A destructive energy landed on the mechanical imperial cruiser. The terrifying dragon claw directly penetrated the mechanical imperial cruiser.

“The strength of this Dragon King…”

The creator stared at Wang Xian with an unsightly expression. His mind was constantly calculating his chances of winning.

“Whoosh!”

At this moment, he saw the Dragon King charging towards him at a terrifying speed.

The Dragon Claw that covered the sky was heading towards him.

“Get lost!”

The creator let out a low growl. A hole appeared on his chest.

A round ball was heading towards Wang Xian’s Dragon Claw.

“Boom!”

An extremely terrifying force exploded in his dragon claw. The Dragon Claw that was millions of kilometers in size collapsed immediately.

“This is the attack of a level three void God realm expert!”

Wang Xian shook off the blood on his palm and revealed a faint smile.

Buzz

At the next moment, his figure disappeared and reappeared a kilometer in front of the creator.

“What a terrifying speed!”

The creator’s expression changed drastically as he growled softly.

Peng

At the next moment, Wang Xian’s palm landed on the creator’s body. The terrifying five elements force caused his body to begin to collapse.

“Oh no, my body is starting to collapse. This Dragon King is too strong!”

“Transmit all the information. Transfer the AI to the Creator’s star of Creation!”

The creator felt the terrifying energy that his body was enduring. His eyes emitted a red light as he continued to calculate.

Very soon, the red light in his eyes disappeared. His entire body lost all signs of life and vitality.

“Eh?”

Wang Xian was slightly stunned. He moved his palm and grabbed the creator’s body in his hand.

“This isn’t his real body!”

His expression changed slightly as he scanned his surroundings.

Crack Crack Crack

“Dragon King, you’re courting death!”

At this moment, an earth-shattering roar came from the area in front of him. At the same time, the sound of machinery operating was heard.

“Huh?”

Wang Xian raised his head and looked ahead. His pupils contracted slightly.

In front of him, there was a mechanical planet just now. It was a mechanical planet with a diameter of at least a few hundred million kilometers.

Around this mechanical planet, there were 18 small planets suspended in the air.

However, at this moment, that planet actually began to change.

Just like the Transformers in sci-fi movies, the entire mechanical planet turned into a gigantic steel giant.

A giant that was hundreds of millions of kilometers in size. What kind of existence was this?

In the surroundings, 18 planets that were the size of ordinary stars revolved around this giant.

Buzz

At this moment, two lightning pillars shot out from the giant’s gigantic eyes.

The lightning pillars were tens of millions of kilometers in size. In an instant, they arrived in front of Wang Xian.

“HMM? What a terrifying attack power. This creator is not as simple as what the glazed domain imagined!”

Wang Xian’s eyes focused. He moved his body and dodged to the side.

Crack! Crack! Crack

At this moment, Wang Xian saw the 18 mechanical planets surrounding the mechanical giant revealing dark holes.

Boom! Boom! Boom

From the holes, a hundred-kilometer-sized tracking bomb was shot out.

The tracking bomb attacked Wang Xian directly.

“Hmph, this creator is somewhat restraining my speed!”

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly.

Wang Xian’s strongest strength was his speed. His terrifying speed could directly hit his opponent before his opponent could react and kill him instantly.

Absolute speed was the most terrifying thing about absolute defense.

Obviously, this gigantic body of the creator was a little difficult to deal with.

“Since that’s the case, I have nothing to hide!”

“Transform into a dragon!”

Wang Xian let out a low roar!

“Roar!”

A roar was heard.
