3856 The 3855 strong and strange fragment of the Starfield!

Boom! Boom! Boom

A terrifying collision sound was heard.

Wang Xian, Lan Qingyue, and the rest’s strongest attack landed on the seven meteorites and collided with them.

The terrifying energy caused the surrounding seawater to collapse and dissipate instantly.

Similarly, the five elements grinding tai chi dragon plate and Lan Qingyue’s attacks gradually dissipated.

After Wang Xian and the rest launched an attack, they did not hesitate and continued to flee into the distance.

However, what made Wang Xian and the rest relieved was that Wang Xian and the rest’s attacks had completely blocked the seven meteorites.

Their attacks disappeared, and so did the meteorites!

“What a powerful treasure. How can this treasure be so terrifying?”

Lan Qingyue couldn’t help but exclaim, her face full of shock.

Their combined attack was almost comparable to the attack of a pinnacle ruler.

But they didn’t expect that their full-strength attack could only block the opponent’s casual attack.

If the opponent attacked a few more times, they wouldn’t be able to block it at all.

They would be easily crushed and destroyed.

They were on completely different levels.

“We are not their match. As expected of the belief universe. To be able to take out such a terrifying supreme treasure. I wonder what level this supreme treasure is.”

Wang Xian’s face was also filled with shock.

A soul supreme treasure that was comparable to a dominator of the ninth level collapsed under that attack and dissipated completely.

This was not an ordinary attack.

An ordinary attack could shatter a soul spear so that the soul spear would not dissipate in the world. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

However, their attack caused the soul spear to disappear completely.

Terrifying!

This involved a powerful and strange energy.

“Let’s go, increase our speed!”

Wang Xian shouted softly again. The Five Elements Millstone’s help landed on Xiao Lan’s body.

Lan qingyue nodded her head. Similarly, a stream of energy landed on Xiao Lan’s body to increase her speed.

Their speed had suddenly increased by a level!

“You want to escape? Once we have locked onto you, do you still want to escape? Starfield fragment, Starfield chain.”

At the back, the eyes of the eight gods were filled with coldness and awe.

They waved their arms and streams of energy were injected into the starfield fragment.

The Shadows of the stars appeared one after another. The Shadows of the stars instantly appeared around Wang Xian and the rest.

Their appearance out of thin air was extremely terrifying. It was as if they had teleported!

“What? What ability is this?”

Wang Xian’s expression changed drastically when he saw this scene.

They had already distanced themselves from the eight gods. However, they did not expect this strange energy to appear around them in an instant.

The eight planets surrounded them. Although the planets were just shadows, Wang Xian and the rest could sense a strange energy.

Wang Xian’s expression changed slightly. He looked at Lan Qingyue and immediately sent a voice transmission, “Let’s go. Let’s split up. I have a way to escape in an instant!”

“Alright, husband, be careful!”

Lan Qingyue looked at Wang Xian and nodded her head heavily

She knew that Wang Xian had the ultimate teleportation treasure in his hands, so she wasn’t too worried. Yes

Now that Lan Qingyue was here, she would be a burden instead!

Wang Xian’s gaze swept across the eight star apparitions that surrounded them. His body moved and he immediately flew to the left.

Meanwhile, Lan Qingyue flew to the right!

“Huh?”

At the back, the eyes of the gods froze slightly when they saw this scene.

“He actually escaped separately? Lock onto the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace and destroy him first!”

A level seven God spoke!

“Alright!”

The rest of the gods responded immediately. They waved their arms and waves of energy were injected into the starfield fragment.

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz

The eight astral shadows flickered slightly and flew toward Wang Xian’s body instantly.

Wang Xian’s expression changed drastically when he sensed this scene.

These eight stars were very strange. He couldn’t sense any offensive power, only a special energy.

Wang Xian could sense that if he was hit by this energy, something bad would definitely happen.

Lan qingyue glanced over, gritted her teeth and left quickly.

Wang Xian was very calm at this moment. He wasn’t worried at all.

Even if he really died this time, he still had enough resources to quickly recover to his current level.

After all, he had stored a large amount of resources.

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz

Wang Xian’s body trembled and a Shadow Dragon Avatar appeared at the side.

Buzz

The next second, the eight stars disappeared instantly when they were very far away from Wang Xian.

He could feel a wave of energy entering his body.

“What kind of strange attack is this? What kind of treasure is this? Could it be an ultimate treasure at the Heaven’s origin level? It’s really terrifying!”

Wang Xian sensed this strange energy and his body trembled.

Buzz

This body of his instantly collapsed and dissipated.

The clone at the side replaced the main body.

The Shadow Dragon clone.

It was able to withstand Wang Xian’s ability to die for sure.

When Wang Xian’s other body collapsed, he felt that the energy in his body had disappeared!

This made him slightly relieved.

That Strange Energy had been evaded!

In the next moment, he didn’t hesitate at all. He continued to flee forward at a terrifying speed.

After sensing the distance between Lan Qingyue and him, Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled.

“Eh? He actually dodged this move? I Can’t let him go!”

The eight level seven gods were slightly shocked when they saw this scene. Their faces were filled with astonishment.

Their bodies moved and they immediately gave chase!

“Trap him in this starry sky, Starfield Lock!”

One of the gods of level seven roared. He waved his arm and a surge of energy continued to be injected into the starfield fragment.

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz

The other seven gods also injected the power of faith.

Crash

In an instant, an invisible chain appeared. The chain instantly chased after Wang Xian.

“It’s Done!”

Wang Xian saw that Lan Qingyue had already escaped some distance away. With a move of his palm, the spatial scroll appeared in his hand.

It was his last chance to use it. Without any hesitation, he used it instantly.

Buzz

Buzz! Buzz

His figure started to turn illusory. However, what shocked Wang Xian was that he saw the illusory and mystical chain instantly enter his body.

Before he could sense anything, the scene around him had already undergone a huge change.

Teleportation was successful!

However, Wang Xian sensed that a surge of energy was located in his body. This made his heart sink.

His mind moved and he wanted to get rid of it. In the end, he realized that he couldn’t get rid of it no matter how hard he tried.

This made him frown.

What was going on?

“A chain appeared directly in my body. It’s illusory and weird. I have a bad feeling about it.”

Wang Xian’s expression was a little ugly.

This was the first time he had encountered such a strange and terrifying treasure.

It was similar to a curse, but it wasn’t a curse.

It seemed to be a binding force.
