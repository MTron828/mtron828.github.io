Chapter 1347: 1347 was finished

“Ahhhh!”

“Kill me, kill me!”

“Please don’t kill me, spare my life!”

In the Palace of the Sky Island dynasty, screams could be heard.

Desperate screams and terrified pleas for mercy!

Prince Jiang, Princess One Leaf, and the other princes begged for mercy in fear.

Prime Minister Gui didn’t hesitate at all. As the general manager of a force that wanted to dominate the universe, he had no mercy.

There were only enemies and his own people.

Crown Prince Jiang, Princess Yi Ye, and the other princes were bound to be cruelly punished for their rudeness to the Dragon Queen.

Streaks of sword light landed on their bodies, making them truly experience the pain of being cut into a thousand pieces.

“Give them a taste of pain!”

Sun Lingxiu looked at the despairing pain and misery of the group and turned her face to the side.

“It’s the Dragon Queen!”

The Golden Swordfish immediately waved their swords and cut them off.

“Leader Mu Zesen, lead the Heavenly Eye Arrow Division to sweep the other cities of the Sky Island dynasty. Bring all the valuable things here. Kill anyone who dares to resist!”

“Leader Ao Jian, lead the Golden Swordfish to contact the strange demons hiding around the Sky Island dynasty. Follow leader Mu Zesen and sweep the entire Sky Island dynasty!”

Prime Minister Gui stood there and ordered the members of the Dragon Palace one by one as he watched the top experts of the Sky Island dynasty being killed by the Dragon King.

The Dragon Palace combat divisions immediately attacked the Sky Island dynasty.

Back then, the Sky Island dynasty relied on its powerful strength to suppress the Dragon Palace and seize the deep sea spiritual spring.

Now that the Dragon Palace was powerful, it could return the favor tenfold.

As a dynasty, it possessed a huge amount of wealth.

They would destroy all the powerhouses of the Sky Island dynasty and seize the wealth of the entire dynasty.

“Disciples of the Heaven’s Eye Arrow Division, Follow Me!”

“Golden Swordfish tribe, follow me!”

...

The leaders of the Dragon Palace led their clansmen and subordinates and spread out in all directions.

Wang Xian floated in the sky and watched the operation of the entire Dragon Palace quietly.

Today, it could be considered a large-scale battle.

Although it was all dependent on his invincible forces, it was still a battle for the entire Dragon Palace.

For such a race battle, the battle between the countries was just the beginning. In the future, it would be the real battle.

Wang Xian’s figure moved and transformed into a human form. His gaze retreated downwards.

At the beginning, there were still soldiers who rushed over to protect the emperor. However, as time passed, some of the soldiers and maids in the palace had already vaguely guessed what was happening here. One by one, they fled frantically outside.

The members of the Dragon Palace did not kill these small figures. Instead, they entered the palaces of the dynasty and began to search for treasures.

A dynasty, and its influence was not weaker than the star-moon dynasty. The treasures in its treasury were definitely worth a lot.

“Plunder all the treasures in the palace of the Sky Island Dynasty!”

The rest of the members of the Wang Immortal Dragon Palace ordered.

“Yes!”

Without him saying anything, the members of the Dragon Palace started to move.

Wang Xian landed on the ground and looked at the few girls with a smile on his face. He raised his head slightly.

“It seems like your strength has improved a lot in the past year!”

Guan Shuqing and the other girls looked at the arrogant Wang Xian and walked over with smiles on their faces.

“Hehe, it’s alright. It’s just the fifth level of the Void Interpretation Stage!”

Wang Xian said faintly.

“Let’s see if you can get it!”

The girls rolled their eyes at him. However, they were very happy that Wang Xian could possess such great strength.

“After we destroy the Heaven Island Empire this time, we will be able to obtain a huge amount of resources. Your strength will also be greatly enhanced!”

Wang Xian said to them with a smile on his face.

“HMM, it’s fortunate that you’re here, Little Xian. Otherwise, those arrogant fellows from the Sky Island Empire would have to bully us for a long time!”

A few girls followed by his side with smiles on their faces.

“Prime Minister Gui, after cleaning up the sky island empire, we will head to the one leaf mainland empire and destroy them in one go!”

Wang Xian looked at Prime Minister Gui and said faintly.

“Dragon King, the one-leaf mainland dynasty belongs to the island dynasty as well. However, it is divided into more than ten islands. Its strength is about double that of the Sky Island dynasty!”

“If we head over now, we can only rely on your invincible power to wipe them out. However, this will cause the other cities to flee when they receive the news. We might as well absorb all the resources of the Sky Island dynasty first. Then, we can get ready to wipe them out in one go!”

Prime Minister Gui bent his body and suggested to Wang Xian, “Also, this way, we can train our Dragon Palace for a real battle. At that time, even without your help, we will be able to destroy the one-leaf mainland kingdom!”

“Alright, we will do as you say!”

Wang Xian nodded slightly when he heard what Prime Minister Gui said.

By destroying the heaven-island kingdom, just the corpses of these experts would be able to raise the strength of the entire Dragon Palace by one level.

By then, Mou Zesen would be able to fight against experts at level four of the Void interpretation realm. Wang Xian wouldn’t need to do anything in the battle to destroy the entire Dragon Palace.

“It’s the Dragon King. I will send the strange demon clan to infiltrate the one leaf mainland dynasty in advance and search for information about them. When the time comes, we will take action and wipe them out in one go!”

Prime Minister GUI said with a cold gaze.

Any force that offended the dragon palace would have to pay a heavy price.

Wang Xian nodded his head slowly. With a move, he flew into the sky and looked around.

As far as his eyes could see, the leaders of the combat divisions were leading their subordinates as they flew toward the cities.

Although there were not many of them, they exuded an overwhelming battle intent.

After today’s battle, the Dragon Palace would rise up completely and stand tall on the transcendence continent!

“Before long, the entire transcendental continent will be ruled by the Dragon Palace. There is only one dragon clan in this world, and that is the Divine Dragon Clan!”

Wang Xian’s eyes shone with a blinding light as he looked down at the Sky Island Dynasty quietly.

This was the dynasty that he had conquered, and it was also the first dynasty that he had conquered.

At the bottom, Prime Minister Gui and a group of girls entered the Treasury of the Sky Island dynasty and took in all the accumulated wealth of the thousand years of the Sky Island dynasty.

Three hours later, Ao Jian, Ao Yao, ao Yaksha, and Ba Qi returned from their surroundings.

“Reporting to Dragon King, the 15 cities of the Heaven Island dynasty have been completely destroyed. All the treasures have been taken. All those who resist have been killed!”

Ba Qi bowed and reported to Wang Xian.

“Reporting to Dragon King, the entire palace has been cleaned up!”

Prime Minister Gui and the rest walked out from the various palaces in the palace and said excitedly.

“Let’s return to the Dragon Palace!”

Wang Xian smiled.

“Yes!”

Prime Minister GUI nodded and shouted, “All members of the Dragon Palace, return to the Dragon Palace!”

“Roar! Roar!”

Excited roars were heard.

All the members of the Dragon Palace flew into the sky and followed Wang Xian towards the Dragon Palace. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only
