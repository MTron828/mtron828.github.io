Chapter 1536: See You in 1536

At the bank of Bingxin Lake, about 100 kilometers away from the Holy Medicine Clinic, Wang Xian arrived in an hour by beast car.

“This is the place. All the businesses around here belong to the Bingxin Dynasty!”

The driver stopped the car and spoke to Wang Xian.

Wang Xian got off the beast car and looked at a lake with a radius of about five kilometers ahead.

There were many sailboats in the lake, and the entire area was extremely beautiful.

Many buildings were built around the lake. This place was much more prosperous than the area near the Holy Medicine Clinic.

The Iceheart Empire was a first-rate force. Among the first-rate forces, they were considered top-notch existences.

As they were relatively close to the ruins of the divine kingdom, they occupied a circumference of twenty kilometers.

As for the three major forces, they occupied an area of 50 kilometers around them.

Dong Dong, Dong Dong

At this moment, Wang Xian sensed something trembling in his storage spiritual bag.

He opened the storage spiritual bag and stared at Ling Jian ‘ER’s heart. He couldn’t help but reveal an excited expression.

According to Ao Jian, as long as he was near Ling Jian ‘er with this heart, his heart would tremble violently.

“Haha, Haha!”

He couldn’t help but stand there and laugh maniacally, attracting the curious gazes of the people around him.

“He’s really not dead, he’s really not dead!”

Wang Xian’s body was trembling slightly, and his face was full of excitement and excitement.

As the saying goes, a woman chasing a man is separated by a heavy veil!

Ling Jian ‘er was pursuing him in the cemetery of the transvestite and gave him pastries every day. In addition, Ling Jian ‘er was extremely beautiful, which made Wang Xian have a favorable impression of her. It would be a lie to say that he was not tempted.

However, he was strictly controlled by his wives at that time, so he did not agree or reject her.

However, men were cheap. They only knew how to treasure when they lost something.

When Ling Jian ‘er left and left in that way, it made him regret it.

Especially when he received the news that Ling Jian ‘er might die in the He clan. The emotions that he had accumulated and the explosion of the heart of light and darkness caused him to be possessed.

He lost his rationality and control.

Everything was because of Ling Jian ‘ER.

Now that he was about to find her, Wang Xian was extremely excited.

“I’m such a Scumbag!”

Wang Xian laughed self-deprecatingly. Regardless of whether Ling Jian ‘er was a scumbag or not, he must get her back.

Through his heart’s senses, Wang Xian looked towards the lake. From his senses, Ling Jian ‘er was in a sailboat in the lake.

Wang Xian scanned his surroundings and saw the location of the rental boat. He walked over quickly.

After renting a boat, Wang Xian’s body shook and the boat sped forward.

He stood at the bow of the boat and locked his eyes on the front.

The heartbeat in the Na Ling Bag became more and more intense and the distance between them was getting closer and closer.

Wang Xian stared ahead nervously.

A beautiful figure appeared in his line of sight. After Wang Xian looked at her closely, a smile appeared on his face.

She was still alive.

She was dressed in golden clothes and held a golden longsword in her hand. She stood there like an unsheathed sword.

However, her expression was extremely cold at this moment. There seemed to be no emotion in her eyes.

“Other than the clothes, she looks exactly the same as the first time I saw her!”

Wang Xian looked at Wang Xian’s figure and smiled. He was in a good mood.

The ship was getting closer and closer. Ling Jian ‘er, who was standing on the deck, was as cold as ice.

On the other side of the bow, there were more than ten young men and women talking.

Each of them was dressed in golden clothes and had a proud expression on their faces.

It was obvious that they were not ordinary disciples.

The ship slowly approached and was only a hundred meters away from Ling Jian ‘ER.

However, Ling Jian ‘er did not even look at Wang Xian.

Buzz

“Ling Jian ‘er!”

His figure flashed and appeared directly in front of Ling Jian ‘ER. With a smile on his face, he called out softly.

“HMM?”

However, when Ling Jian ‘er saw Wang Xian appearing in front of her, she was slightly shocked. She placed her right hand on the hilt of her sword and stared at him coldly.

“Who are you?”

Ling Jian ‘er stared at him emotionlessly and asked coldly.

“I... I Am Wang Xian. We met in the cemetery of demi-humans and demons in the Liuhai District. A few months ago, you suddenly left and I came here to look for you. Now, I have finally found you!”

“Come back with me. Don’t continue to cultivate the heartless sword principle. Follow me and return to the Dragon Palace!”

Wang Xian sized up Ling Jian ‘er and said excitedly.

“I don’t know you. Get lost immediately!”

Ling Jian ‘er stared at Wang Xian without the slightest fluctuation in her eyes and shouted coldly.

Wang Xian saw her expression and his face was slightly embarrassed. As sect leader Ling had said, Ling Jian ‘er, who cultivated the heartless sword principle, had already forgotten about them! RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Jian ‘er!”

Wang Xian gritted his teeth, he stared at him affectionately. “There was once a sincere love that was placed in front of me. I didn’t cherish it. I only regretted it when I lost it. This is the most painful thing in the world. If the heavens could give me another chance, I would say three words to that girl: I Love You. If I have to add a time limit to this love, I hope it will be... 10,000 years!”

“Lunatic!”

Ling Jian ‘ER’s expression didn’t change at all as she spat out these three words coldly.

This caused Wang Xian’s expression to freeze instantly.

“Junior sister Jian ‘er, who are you talking to? HMM? Who Are You?”

At this moment, a young man’s voice came from the front.

The young man stared at Wang Xian with a cold expression on his face.

“A lunatic, Scram!”

Ling Jian ‘er glanced at Wang Xian indifferently and said coldly.

“Kid, I think you are courting death, right?”

The young man at the side stared at Wang Xian with a cold gaze and said coldly.

Wang Xian frowned slightly.

“Disappear from our sight within three seconds. Otherwise, you will have to bear the consequences!”

The young man stared at Wang Xian with a hint of killing intent in his eyes.

Ling Jian ‘er, who was beside him, also swept a cold glance at Wang Xian without saying a word.

“When we first met, you were also so cold. I’m not in a hurry!”

Wang Xian looked at Ling Jian ‘er and suddenly smiled. His body moved and he returned to his ship.

“Brother Jiu, what’s the situation?”

At this moment, the voices of young men and women could be heard from the back of the ship.

“It’s nothing. A reckless fellow. He must have seen junior sister Jian ‘ER’s beauty and wanted to strike up a conversation with her!”

The young man took a glance at Wang Xian’s ship and said to the people behind him.

“Oh? He wants to court our junior sister Bing Jian ‘ER. He’s simply courting death!”

A few young men and women walked over and said with a smile.

Ling Jian ‘er smiled faintly at the group of people. Her gaze swept across the ship that Wang Xian was on. She was a little puzzled.

This was the second person who called her Ling Jian ‘er. However, she was clearly called Bing Jian ‘er.

“You even changed your name? It’s the heartless sword principle!”

Wang Xian, who had returned to the ship, looked at Ling Jian ‘ER’s position and frowned slightly.

He even used such touching lines from Grandpa Xing. However, Ling Jian ‘ER was still unmoved.

It seemed that her heartless swordsmanship had been completed!
