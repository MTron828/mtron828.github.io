Chapter 497: Painted Skin

“Diabolism!” Wang Xian murmured as he read the messages on the Underworld forum.

Diabolism’s cultivation was circled around the bloodline. Their cultivation means were usually gruesome.

Vampires, ghouls, and cursed venoms were the work of Diabolism.

In addition, they often got in touch with dark and evil stuff during their cultivation, which in turn, distorted their mind and character.

As a result, they were eccentric, fearless, and unorthodox.

Therefore, they were known as Diabolism, which often got besieged and wiped out by the ordinary Martial Artists.

Wang Xian was indifferent to Diabolism.

They arrived at the airport where they took a plane back to Shang Jing.

Adjaya, who was dressed like a queen, was a spotlight wherever she went.

She also received some attention, even in the first-class cabin on the plane.

Adjaya smiled as she did not mind the attention at all.

As a Princess, she could easily disregard the curious gazes cast on her.

When the plane landed at the airport, it was already 8 pm.

Wang Xian walked out of the airport with Adjaya and took a cab to Sui Clan.

Adjaya was looking around with curiosity, and would pose questions to Wang Xian from time to time.

Wang Xian would always answer with a smile while the car continued its journey.

Boom!

Just then, an explosion was heard ahead.

“What an unlucky day to encounter such a thing. No wonder nobody has been willing to drive at night for the past few days.”

Upon hearing the explosion ahead, the cab driver was flustered.

Hastily, he made a U-turn.

“What’s the matter? Driver?” asked Wang Xian to the cab driver with a frown.

“The night in Shang Jing has been restless for the past few days. It’s chaotic. Damn, I’m not driving tonight. I’ll drop you guys later without you paying!” the driver said with embarrassment.

Wang Xian knit his brows slightly. “We’ll get out here then!”

“Great, hurry now!”

Apparently, the taxi driver learned something from his colleagues, which resulted in him braking the car immediately.

“What’s the matter? Have we reached the spot?” Adjaya queried Wang Xian.

“Not yet, but it’s not far away from here. Let’s walk over!”

Wang Xian shook his head and replied to Adjaya as he looked ahead.

“I’m following you, no matter what!”

Adjaya cast her gaze ahead. The booming sound just now indicated a fight over there.

“Mm, let’s check it out!”

Wang Xian nodded.

He was surprised to see Shang Jing in such a mess.

The duo stalked over. Wang Xian raised an eyebrow as soon as a faint bloody mist emerged.

“Hiak hiak, the Dongmen Clan wiped out the devil sects fifty years ago. But fifty years have passed, and today marks the doom of Dongmen Clan! Haha!”

“The Remains will skin all of you and craft you into an art piece. Your bones will be made into perfect weapons!”

“Haha, our Laozu annihilated the Sect Leader of Remains fifty years ago. You still have the cheek to seek revenge now. Courting your own doom!”

“Hiak hiak, the Dongmen Clan will be annihilated in ten days!”

“Hmph, how arrogant!”

As Wang Xian and Adjaya approached, they could hear two cold voices.

Bloody mist lingered in the air while the pungent blood caused Adjaya to frown.

Wang Xian looked over to where a score of young men stood.

They were confronting each other with killing intent filling their eyes.

“Dongmen Clan, one of the three main Sacred Clans in Shang Jing. Remains, one of the four main Sects in Diabolism!”

Two of the forces were engaged in a fight. It was no wonder that they did not care about other things.

Sports cars were parked on both sides. Apparently, the disciples of Remains were ambushing the Dongmen Clan.

“That is...?”

Wang Xian peered at the disciples of Remains.

All ten of them had creepy appearances. There was a mixture of old and young, and some of them were women.

Those ladies looked extremely glamorous and alluring.

On a closer look, these disciples of Remains were extremely queer.

They seemed to be wearing masks, which was made out of human skin.

The Painted Skin? [1]

Wang Xian thought of a phrase. There was an introduction to Remains in the Underworld forum.

They used the bones of deceased experts to refine them into a complete bone puppet before wrapping it with human skin.

Using this unique technique, one can be revived. It was as though they were making a Spiritual Weapon.

Bone puppets with spirituality possessed domineering combat power.

These disciples of Remains obviously did not have the strength to make a bone puppet. But they could plaster painted skin on themselves.

After plastering the painted skin, they would obtain a strong defense. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“How perverted this is. They could really fight with the ninjas from Japan!”

Adjaya had seen through their true colors and remarked with disgust.

“Well, everything from that small country came from us. Too bad they learned all the bad things instead of the good ones!”

Wang Xian shook his head.

Now, he finally understood why everyone wanted to eliminate Diabolism.

Just this painted skin alone required the use of the skin from someone who had just died. Such means were absolutely sick and cruel!

A score of them confronting each other with ten Remains with bones in their hands, and people from Dongmen Clan holding their short swords.

“Let’s go!” Wang Xian took a look and said to Adjaya, taking a detour from the side.

Be it Sacred Clan or Diabolism, everything is good as long as they don’t provoke me.

“Okay!”

Adjaya cast a curious gaze at them before holding onto Wang Xian’s arm, making a detour.

“Hur? Wait? What delicate skin!”

Just then, one of the Remains disciples spotted Wang Xian and Adjaya. She peered over and took a measure of Adjaya.

A girl, who was extremely alluring and pretty, gave off a faint bloody vibe on her face and scarlet lips.

“Hong Niang, let’s finish off these fellows from Dongmen Clan before we do other things!” an old man with a wrinkled face said with a frown. Even though he looked like an old man, his voice sounded just like any young person!

“I’ll leave it to the nine of you. Such delicate skin, I must collect!”

Hong Niang licked her fingers and chuckled.

“Haha, no doubt this is the Diabolism. All of you deserve to die!”

One of the young men from Dongmen Clan laughed out loud as he swept a confident gaze at the nine people beside him.

“Kill them all!” the young man from Dongmen Clan in the middle exclaimed coldly and rushed out.

Hong Niang ignored all of them and sucked her finger as she strode towards Wang Xian and Adjaya.

With admiration in her eyes, she took a measure of Adjaya, summing her up with eyes filled with surprise and appreciation.

“A foreign babe. I’m still short a foreign babe in my collection. It looks like today is my day. I’ve made up my mind. When I advance to Inborn Realm, I’ll make you my first bone puppet!”
