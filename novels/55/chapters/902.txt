Chapter 903: 0904 Phoenix Immortal Pill and Weapon Workshop

Translator: 549690339

The overnight massacre had caused an unimaginable change in shenghai town.

This change was something that even Wang Xian didn’t expect.

“Light and darkness exist in the world. Where there is light, there is darkness. Similarly, where there is darkness, there is light and the heart of Light and Darkness!”

Wang Xian mumbled to himself. He could somewhat understand why light and darkness could be fused together.

Two completely opposite attributes could be fused together. This was the nature of the Great Dao and the truth of Heaven and earth.

“However, the darkness has yet to disappear!”

Wang Xian was full of smiles. The Dragon Thorns had brought darkness to the holy sea town. In the darkness, some people had turned into demons.

Nowadays, even though the demons had absorbed the blood, they still existed.

Many people had resolved their hatred and done good deeds during the day.

However, there were still some people who still had demons in their hearts. At least for the next few days, the Demons would not disappear.

“Dragon King, this is all the rewards from yesterday. We received a lot fewer missions today, but there are still seven more!”

The drakonid came to Wang Xian’s side and reported to him.

Wang Xian took the interspatial ring and nodded slowly. “Continue. I reckon that we will receive very few missions in the next two days!”

After these few days of craziness, the holy sea town would regain its peace. The following missions might not be as frequent.

However, the spiritual stones earned in these two days were sufficient.

Furthermore, he would let the DRAKONIDS develop their businesses in other locations.

Especially in Donghai City.

The Demon Hunters Academy in Donghai City would enroll new students one month later. Similarly, Donghai city was close to the ocean.

When he arrived there, Wang Xian would have to develop his business. It would be best if he could find an address of the dragon palace in the surrounding ocean.

He would establish his foundation in this world.

In the next two days, people died at the hands of the dragon assassin organization every day. The Red Congratulatory Death Note was also made known to everyone in Shenghai Town.

It was only on the third day that the dragon assassin organization did not receive any missions.

In the short span of four to five days, the dragon Spike received more than fifty missions, and the number of extraordinary sixth rank experts assassinated reached four.

The dragon Spike’s battle results caused the entire holy sea town to tremble, and even the undercurrent assassin group directly withdrew from holy sea town. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

A small town had another powerful assassin group, so there was no need for them to fight for territory.

In just a few days, I have harvested a few million middle-grade spirit stones, which is enough to buy many elixirs. Next, I have to increase the strength of the members of the dragon Spike

Wang Xian walked out of his room and headed toward the center of the town.

He was going to buy elixirs.

The center of the town was still bustling with activity. The assassinations over the past few days had not affected many people.

Looking around, there were many elixir stores and weapon stores. However, the three largest stores were still the holy item forging workshop, the life and Death Elixir Workshop, and the Immortal Phoenix Elixir and Weapon Workshop!

These three stores were the three largest stores in holy sea town. Ninety percent of people would go to these three stores.

The three stores were very close to each other. With the stores wide open, one could see all kinds of weapons and elixirs inside from the outside.

The martial artists who were passing by couldn’t help but stop and look inside.

“Fengxian!”

Wang Xian walked towards the Fengxian Elixir and weapons workshop with a smile.

“Welcome, young master. Would you like to buy elixirs or weapons?”

As soon as he entered, a female attendant came up to him with a smile and asked Wang Xian.

“Elixirs!”

Wang Xian replied directly and looked at the location of the elixirs.

“Young master, that is the area for elixirs. Young Master, you can choose by yourself!”

The female attendant pointed to the right and said.

Wang Xian nodded and walked over.

There were quite a number of customers in the Fengxian Elixir and weapons workshop. There were also more than a dozen people in the elixir area.

Some were asking about the price while others were asking about the effects of the elixirs.

From ordinary pills to transcendent level 5 pills, they were all sold.

As for higher-grade pills, they were not placed on the stage. More expensive pills were sometimes auctioned.

The Immortal Phoenix Pill and weapons workshop would sometimes auction some precious pills on the second floor.

“Shopkeeper, have you got the detoxification pills?”

At this time, four or five people who were obviously members of a mercenary group walked in and asked the old man standing inside.

“I’m sorry, everyone. We don’t have the detoxification pill yet. We lack a kind of spiritual herb!”

The shopkeeper shook his head bitterly.

“Why don’t we have it yet? How are we going to go to the Black Sea area to do a mission?”

The five people frowned and showed some impatience on their faces. “Sigh, why can’t all the Pill Workshops in the holy sea town buy it!”

After saying that, the five of them left immediately.

The old shopkeeper shook his head slowly.

Wang Xian took a look. In the transcendence continent, not only were there powerful elixirs, but there were also many elixirs that could resist poison, detoxify poison, and provide special assistance.

Some places would have miasma while some ferocious beasts and demonic beasts contained poison. Hence, special elixirs were needed to provide assistance.

The prices of these elixirs were not low either. However, they were essential items for the mercenary group.

“Haha, shopkeeper Liu, Heaven Billow Grass!”

At this moment, a hearty laugh came from outside.

“Heaven Billow grass, found it?”

Shopkeeper Liu, who was sitting inside, was slightly stunned. Soon after, an excited expression appeared on his face, and he hurriedly walked out.

“Commander Sand Sea, have you really found it?”

Shopkeeper Liu asked somewhat excitedly.

“Of course, thirty-five stalks, the rarest ingredient to refine the detoxification pill!”

Outside, a dozen middle-aged youths stood there, their faces beaming with pride.

“Good, good. We are willing to give you a satisfactory reward after the mercenary association’s mission reward. Of course, if Commander Sha Hai wants to exchange it for pills, that’s fine too!”

Shopkeeper Liu said to the middle-aged man excitedly.

“Okay!”

The middle-aged man nodded with a smile on his face.

“Wait, Commander Sha Hai, how about you give us the Heaven Billow Grass?”

At this moment, a voice came from the side, “We will also give commander sha hai a satisfactory reward!”

A woman slowly walked out and looked at Commander Sha Hai and the others with a smile on her face.

“Eh? Shopkeeper Qing, what do you mean?”

Shopkeeper Liu looked at the woman with a gloomy face and asked with a gloomy face.

“The one with the highest price gets it!”

The woman said with a smile on her face.

“Hehe, the one with the highest price gets it? Commander Sha Hai is a cooperative mercenary group of our Immortal Phoenix Pill and weapons workshop. Don’t tell me shopkeeper Qing wants to buy it at twice the price?”

Shopkeeper Liu asked with a cold smile.

“Twice the price is too high!”

Shopkeeper Qing shook his head with a smile on his face. He turned his head and looked to the side.

“Commander Sha Hai, do me a favor and give this heaven billow grass to shopkeeper Qing of the life and Death Medicinal Pill Workshop. Let’s Be Friends!”

At this moment, an old man slowly walked over. His gaze swept the surroundings before finally landing on Commander Sha Hai and the others.

“Oh?”

Seeing the old man arrive, shopkeeper Liu’s expression instantly changed.
