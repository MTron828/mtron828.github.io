Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Not only will they not be able to stay behind here, but they will also not survive back in their country! He’s not getting away!”

A cold voice reverberated in the banquet hall. When Tang Lingling heard Wang Xian, she was stunned and her face instantly paled.

Mu Xiaowan stared blankly as she witnessed the development. She lifted her head and looked at Wang Xian before turning to Yang Ze, Gao Yang and Qing Wen, who were flabbergasted and horrified.

In the end, her gaze fell on Princess Adjaya and Prince Adallen. Suddenly, she had a newfound admiration for Wang Xian.

“Sir, our kids are ignorant. Please allow us to apologize on their behalf. We are from the same country and we hope you can let us off this time!” Gao Yang’s father stepped forward and pleaded with Wang Xian in desperation.

Hehe.

Wang Xian’s cold gaze glanced past him and fell on the girl of Yang Ze. He walked directly at her and demanded, “Hand me the phone!”

“Ah..! Here you go!” The girl was horrified and her hands were shaking as she handed the phone over to him.

“Not bad! You have even recorded everything! Could it be that you are thinking of editing it and uploading it on the web?” Wang Xian saw the video on the phone, stared at Yang Ze and remarked sarcastically.

“No... Not at all!”

Yang Ze shook his head immediately. Cold sweat had broken out on his forehead.

Hehe.

Wang Xian chuckled sarcastically as he looked across the young men and the middle-aged and old men beside them. “Scram!”

“Please leave!”

Just as Wang Xian completed his words, the old man from Dubai ordered them coldly. “Based on the actions of you guys, we will pursue the matter in the future. In addition, all of you are banned from ever stepping into Dubai!”

The group was exceptionally pale and was a little out of sorts by this moment.

At this moment, a few security personnel stepped ahead and stared at them coldly.

The four young men, together with their female companions and fathers, were brought out of the banquet hall.

After seeing the video on the phone, Wang Xian made a call to Mo Yuan.

After telling him the names, he left the rest for Mo Yuan to handle.

The four young men had dared to try to frame him. Their purpose for this video was clearly to further discredit him.

If he did not have the strong backing he did, he wouldn’t know how he would have turned out.

Since he had such strength now, the outcomes for them wouldn’t be what they had expected.

“That... Can we sit down and have a chat? As for the rest, please carry on. I’ll look for each of you in a while!”

Adallen looked at Wang Xian as he spoke. After which, he spoke to the crowd behind him.

“Alright! We will be waiting patiently, my Prince!”

As the businessmen left, they couldn’t help but be surprised and impressed by Wang Xian.

From the attitude of their prince, they could tell that their prince was reserved and even a little fearful towards this young man.

This made them astonished.

Wang Xian shrugged his shoulders and went over to sit down. Adjaya sat beside him while Adallen sat directly opposite to him.

“Greetings, Princess and Prince!”

Mu Xiaowan looked curiously at the prince and princess and greeted them fearfully.

“Hello!”

Adallen and Adjaya looked at Mu Xiaowan, smiled and nodded their heads.

“This is a friend of mine in Dubai. Her family has business in this place. If you can, please help her out in the future!” Wang Xian caressed the head of the little brat and said to them.

“Sure. Since she’s a friend of brother-in-law, she’s also a friend of ours. Girl, if there’s anything you require help with in the future, you can always look for me,” Adallen replied with a smile. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“You sure aren’t reserved. It seems like you have accepted your identity!”

Adjaya turned and looked at Wang Xian as she questioned him calmly.

“What identity?” Wang Xian’s lips curved into a smile as he continued, “Have you prepared the ship I told you about?”

“Marry me and everything is negotiable. Otherwise, you won’t be able to leave Dubai. I’m clearly aware of whatever you do in Dubai and every meal you have here!”

Adjaya looked at Wang Xian and smiled.

“You can forget about this. If I wanted to leave this place, you wouldn’t be able to stop me!” Wang Xian gulped down a cup of red wine confidently.

“We shall see about that!”

Adjaya lifted another cup of red wine. Her long, slender fingers were around the cup as she smiled and gave a toast to Wang Xian.

Mu Xiaowan was dumbfounded as her eyes widened while witnessing what was happening.

She couldn’t contain her curiosity. She pulled Wang Xian’s arms and asked softly, “Uncle, what’s happening?”

“He’s going to abandon me after making use of me!”

Adjaya clearly could hear Mu Xiaowan, and replied plainly.

“Huh? You... You... I had not expected you to be a guy like this! You are really a beast!”

Mu Xiaowan was shocked to hear Adjaya’s reply. After which, anger engulfed her as she held onto Wang Xian’s clothes furiously and growled.

“Hey! Hey! Don’t believe what she has said! Don’t tell me you don’t believe what I’ve said...”

“I would rather believe the words from the princess than you! All guys are bad and indeed you aren’t an exception. Tsk! I’m looking down on you! I’m looking down on you!”

Mu Xiaowan pointed her middle finger at him.

Adjaya couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

...

“Scumbag! You are really a scumbag! It’s over! Our Gao Family is through! I’m so going to screw you over!”

Outside the hotel, the fathers of the four young men pointed furiously and started to scold their sons the moment they stepped out of the hotel.

“He’s the man of the princess! The man of the princess of Dubai! We have invested billions in Dubai! Now all this is gone! Just be ready to go beg for alms in the future!” the four middle-aged men roared at their sons furiously.

The four young men lowered their heads and didn’t dare to say a word.

“Let’s get back to our country now that all our assets in Dubai are gone! They are all gone!”

A middle-aged man took out a cigarette and lit it after scolding for some time.

Yang Ze took a deep breath, walked to his father with his head down and said, “Father, we had not expected him to have an identity like this. If we had known... Father, let me raise the family from here onwards. I can earn money!”

Buzz buzz buzz!

At this moment, his phone rang.

He was shocked and immediately picked it up. Instinctively, he wanted to hang up. However, he immediately accepted the call after seeing that it was a phone call from the director of his company.

“Hello, Director Wang!”

“Are you f*cking dead now? If not, you should be! F*ck you! Give up your dreams of being a star. You might as well be a ghost in hell! If you let me see you again, I’ll kill you!”

An angry roar came from the other end of the phone call. After which, the other party hung up.

At this moment, his female companion’s phone was shaking constantly.

She took out the phone and saw a screenshot her friend had sent her.

Heavenly King Media was the largest media company in the country and Yang Ze was the next superstar they were focusing on grooming. However, the Heavenly King Media had made an announcement on their public Weibo account just moments ago.

[Yang Ze met with a mishap overseas and passed away. Let us mourn in memory of him!]

When she saw the announcement, she was stunned for a full ten seconds.
