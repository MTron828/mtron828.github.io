“Foster father, please be careful! ”

Tianci nodded when he heard Wang Xian’s words.

Wang Xian immediately called an lie over and ordered him to bring Tianci and chaos away.

His gaze swept across the four kings of the gods in front of him. The corners of Wang Xian’s mouth curled up slightly. With a movement of his body, he disappeared instantly!

‘ ‘HMM?”

At the front, the four kings of the gods wanted to escape from the pursuit of Wang Xian and the rest.

All of a sudden, they sensed that the aura of Wang Xian and the rest had disappeared.

This caused them to be slightly stunned. Their faces were filled with astonishment.

“What’s going on? Did the Dragon King and the rest just leave?”

One of the kings of pantheon frowned and asked.

“Their departure doesn’t seem to be a direct return in a normal state. Instead, they disappeared in an instant. Something’s Not Right. ”

A king of Pantheon frowned.

The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace had been chasing them for three days.

Why did they suddenly leave?

“It’s a bit strange. They were chasing us in vain, so they couldn’t pose much of a threat to us. But the Dragon King still chased us for three days, and now he’s suddenly disappeared. It must be premeditated! ”

A king of the gods said with certainty.

“Not good. could he have done something to the Qianjiang Beast Emperor, driving us out of a certain distance and going back to hunt the Qianjiang Beast Emperor himself! ?”

A king of the gods in the center said with a slight change in expression.

“It’s really possible. ”

The other three kings of the gods said with grim expressions!

This was the only reason.

“Damn it, we’ve been played by him!”Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

One of the kings of the gods said with a gloomy face!

“Come, let’s go. We Can’t let the Dragon King have his way!”

The four kings of the gods didn’t hesitate at all and flew directly to the spot they had just been at.

With their strength, although they would be suppressed by the Dragon King and the others, they wouldn’t be in any danger.

Therefore, they were not afraid that the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace had other plans.

They must not let the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace have his way.

Let the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace hunt down the Beast Emperor Qian Jiang.

They must not let him have a good time!

Buzz

However, when the four kings of Pantheon flew towards the location just now.

At this moment, Wang Xian’s figure had already appeared beside the Beast Emperor Qian Jiang!

After Qian Jiang Beast Emperor was severely injured by Wang Xian, he immediately used his powerful innate skill to escape!

He was also extremely far away from where they were fighting.

Wang Xian used the netherworld dragon to give chase and locked onto him.

“Roar! Roar! ”

“Roar! Roar!”

When Qian Jiang Beast Emperor saw Wang Xian appearing, he was instantly shocked.

He fled into the distance with a face full of fear.

Splash

The surrounding water currents condensed into water droplets and dispersed in all directions.

He used his powerful innate skill to escape.

The Beast Emperor Qian Jiang also knew that he was no match for the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace.

If he didn’t escape, he might be killed.

Buzz

When Wang Xian saw this scene, he moved his palm and the book of water forbidden spell floated in the air.

Waves of water energy were swirling towards the Qian Jiang Beast Emperor.

Using water energy to create water energy.

Wang Xian’s usage of the water attribute was far superior to the Qian Jiang Beast Emperor!

Buzz

Wang Xian’s body trembled and the power of space vibrated. In an instant, he teleported to the largest body of the Qian Jiang Beast Emperor.

His dragon claws were clawing at his body.

“Awoo! Awoo!”

A blood-curdling scream was heard. A huge piece of flesh and blood of the Qian Jiang Beast Emperor was directly grabbed out by Wang Xian.

“Dragon Tomb, Burial! ”

Wang Xian let out a low growl as nine types of energy circulated around his body. The nine-colored light slowly turned earthy yellow.

A huge dragon tomb was directly buried toward the Qian Jiang Beast Emperor.

When the Qian Jiang Beast Emperor saw this scene, he let out a terrified roar.

Splash! ”

The long river around him was divided into dozens of sections!

Each section of the river was escaping in a frenzy.

Among them, half of the river was spinning and forming a whirlpool.

Slowly, the river water seemed to sink into the river and disappeared! When Wang Xian saw this scene, his expression changed slightly.

“Divine Dragon Chains! ”

With a low growl, numerous gigantic chains appeared around him.

The gigantic chains entwined with the river flows.

Inside these river flows, there were some bodies of the river-moving beast emperor.

These bodies were all alive and could even unleash a powerful attack.

Wang Xian destroyed the vitality of more than ten parts of the body of the river-moving Beast Emperor and continued to pursue it according to the power of the wind and thunder to lock down the enemy!

This time, the Beast Emperor was still very far away.

Wang Xian, who had just used the chasing power of the Netherworld Dragon, could not continue to use it in such a short period of time.

However, his speed was still very terrifying.

The flight of his body coupled with the teleportation power of space.

Wang Xian’s speed was about ten times that of the Beast Emperor.

However, according to Wang Xian’s senses, the Beast Emperor did not merge the more than ten parts of his body.

Instead, they were fleeing in different directions rapidly.

Two hours later, Wang Xian caught up with the first part of the body.

After he easily suppressed and killed it, Wang Xian continued his pursuit.

In the next ten days, Wang Xian continued his pursuit.

“The last one!”

More than ten days later, Wang Xian stared at the last part of the body of the Qian Jiang Beast Emperor. His eyes were glowing.

He flew over and waved his arm.

The severely injured Beast Emperor was easily caught by Wang Xian.

Wang Xian held it in his hand and smiled.

He did not destroy all the vitality of the beast emperor.

Once the Beast Emperor was completely destroyed, there would be an additional spot in the starry universe.

However, Xiao Lan had yet to reach the stage where she could make a breakthrough!

Therefore, he was prepared to preserve the vitality of the Beast Emperor Qian Jiang.

“However, before that, I can first check if the Beast Emperor Qian Jiang has been completely captured and destroyed! ”

Wang Xian’s mind stirred. He cast soul capture on the piece of flesh of the Beast Emperor Qian Jiang that was still alive.

A stream of information was transmitted into Wang Xian’s mind very quickly.

“HMM? He’s still alive. ”

Very soon, from this piece of flesh, Wang Xian discovered that apart from this piece of flesh, there were other forms of energy and life force.

In other words, even if Wang Xian destroyed this piece of flesh, the Beast Emperor would not die completely.

“As expected of a space beast.”

Wang Xian sighed slightly. It must have been when Beast Emperor Qian Jiang was escaping that some of his flesh escaped and left behind his life.

This life had the foundation of the Heaven’s origin realm and could recover very quickly.

Wang Xian shook his head. Although it was a pity that he did not get this heaven’s origin realm quota in the universe, it was still a huge profit to obtain the flesh and blood of a space beast!

This was a huge amount of resources.

Wang Xian was prepared to stay for the time being.. He wanted to start storing resources for his breakthrough!
