Translator: 549690339

The sound of shattering rang out in the arena!

The Giant Liao Feiyu’s body completely froze.

The earth hammer in his hand slowly began to crumble under everyone’s gaze!

It completely crumbled!

At this moment, he could feel the crumbling earth hammer. Seeing the powerful bloodline weapon belonging to their Liao clan crumble, he was completely stunned!

Yes, this time, he was completely stunned!

This Earth Hammer was one of the top weapons of the Liao clan.

Now it was actually destroyed.

It was destroyed in the hands of a Pinnacle Universe Knight!

In the seat of Honor, Liao Fei Yu’s grandfather’s face instantly paled, and he couldn’t help but spit out a mouthful of blood.

His eyes were slightly bloodshot as he stared at the arena, his body violently trembling!

“Damn it, the Silver Earth Hammer was actually destroyed, it was actually destroyed!

Liao Feiyu’s grandfather’s eyes were slightly bloodshot, and his face instantly revealed a savage expression.

He let out a low roar, and a terrifying might erupted from his body!

The Silver Earth Hammer was one of the few bloodline supreme treasures of their Liao clan.

It was one of the inheritance treasures of the Black Earth tribe.

Now, it had been destroyed, and their losses were too great!

“How is this possible? How could the hammer of silver earth be destroyed so easily? What kind of treasure is that young man holding?”

“Hiss, the bloodline inheritance treasure has been destroyed. This…

At this moment, many great beings stood up from the upper seat of the Black Earth tribe. Their expressions changed drastically as they watched this scene in shock.

A young man with the power of a universe knight had already shocked them!

The weapon in this young man’s hand had actually destroyed the bloodline weapon of their black Earth tribe.

This?

“No! »

Liao Fei Yu looked at the Silver Earth Hammer that had completely collapsed, and his eyes were also bloodshot as he roared madly!

“When you bullied my mother, did you think about this scene? Are You Ready to die?”

Tianci stared at them. His face was cold and cold, but his expression didn’t change much!

He continued to walk towards Liao Feiyu, his gaze fixed on him.

Liao Feiyu saw Tianci continue to get closer. This time, he couldn’t help but take two steps back. His face was filled with fear.

He didn’t want to die!

All the strong disciples of the tribes around were shocked.

Die!

Tianci suddenly increased his speed. A stream of water fell on the sharp sword in his hand.

A terrifying energy formed on the sharp sword. In the next moment, it slashed towards Liao Feiyu!

stop!

In the seat of Honor, Liao Feiyu’s father’s expression kept changing as he watched this scene.

He gritted his teeth and let out a low roar as he flew towards the arena. He stared at Tianci with killing intent flashing in his eyes.

With a wave of his arm, a cloud of sand flew towards Tianci.

Liao Fei Yu’s father had participated in the Battle of the Heaven Board.

Even though he didn’t make it into the top 10, he was still in the top 30.

He had the strength of A Level 4 universe master.

His attack was fatal to a disciple at the pinnacle of the Universe Knight Realm.

There was almost no chance of escaping!

Liao Fei Yu’s father’s sudden intervention stunned everyone around.

Tian Chi’s mother, grandfather, and the elders of the Mu Li tribe were all stunned when they saw this sudden change.

Some of the peak level 9 universe masters frowned when they saw Liao Fei Yu’s father’s sudden attack.

Some of them looked at the Black Earth tribe and shook their heads when they saw that they had no plans to stop them.

The Xuan Tu tribe was one of the top two tribes in the six paths universe. The other tribes didn’t dare to interfere in their affairs at all.

The scene in front of them was clearly the Xuan Tu tribe disregarding the rules and wanted to kill Mu Litianci.

Wang Xian shook his head when he saw this scene.

He waved his arm and a water sword instantly appeared in front of the sand to neutralize the attack of the sand!

“Is this the Xuan Tu tribe? If you are not their opponent, you have to use your power to suppress them. TSK TSK, this is the attack of a ruler of the universe. They want to kill you directly.

Wang Xian looked at the scene with a mocking expression.

He was not surprised by the scene before him.

Ever since Wang Xian’s rise to power on Earth, he had encountered too many such incidents.

He was from a powerful force that stood high up in the world. He was completely shameless enough to break the rules and directly killed the challengers that they thought were weak.

“Hehe, I, Mu Litianci, have witnessed the so-called big tribes today. Since I can’t defeat them, the old ones came. They even wanted to kill me directly. Is this the style of Your Xuan Tu Tribe?”

“Is this your Xuan Tu Tribe?”

Tianci saw this scene and a trace of cold sweat appeared on his face. Fortunately, his adoptive father had attacked just now.

Otherwise, unless he removed the restriction in his body, he would definitely die!

“Destroying the treasure of our Black Earth tribe, damn it!

“Insulting our Black Earth tribe, damn it!

Liao Feiyu’s father saw that his attack was blocked, and his eyes focused as he shouted with an embarrassed expression!

“The Disciples of Your Xuan Earth tribe fought with me in the arena. In the end, their weapons were destroyed and they actually said that I deserved to die. Is Your Xuan Earth tribe so Shameless? ‘Q “A dignified top-tier tribe actually said such shameless words. It’s truly shameless to the extreme!

Tianci could not help but shout when he saw the killing intent on Liao Feiyu’s father’s face!

“This Black Earth tribe is so shameless. I Can’t beat them in the arena battle, but the old one came up and wanted to kill Mu Li Tianci. Isn’t this too shameless?”

Liao Feiyu’s father’s attack also shocked the surrounding disciples.

A young man couldn’t help but say.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Shut Up!

However, a middle-aged man next to him immediately scolded him.

The strong preyed on the weak.

The Black Earth tribe was not something that they could discuss.

All the rules were set by the strong.

The history books were also written by the strong.

The weak were ultimately the losers.

As long as the strong were shameless, the weak could not do anything about it.

Just like now.

“Shut up, my black Earth tribe is not someone that you can teach. Say One more word, and I’ll kill you!

When Liao Feiyu’s father heard Tianci’s words, his aura exploded as he spoke with a face full of killing intent!

When Tianci saw how domineering he was, his breathing quickened slightly.

The other party was completely unreasonable.

He was completely trying to use his power to oppress him!

“Lord of the Xuan Tu tribe, our Tianci is still young and insensible. I apologize on his behalf to you and to the Xuan Tu tribe. I’m sorry, I’m Sorry!

Tianci’s grandfather’s expression changed drastically at the back.

He quickly flew towards the arena and grabbed tianci’s arm, continuously apologizing to Liao Feiyu’s father!
