Chapter 179: Invited For A Treatment?

The next morning, it was the fourth day of their seven-day holiday.

After watching Xiao Yu practice her sword in the courtyard, Wang Xian came to the Divine Dragon Medical Hall at the old street.

The medical hall had been closed for four days. Some of the calls from the hospitals were rejected by him too.

“Even though I have $500 million now, I must continue to work hard when I think of the resources required for Dragon Palace.”

Wang Xian opened the door of Divine Dragon Medical Hall, boiled a flask of hot water and poured himself a cup of tea with smiles. He lay there while waiting for patients to come to him.

In less than 20 minutes, an ambulance siren was heard outside.

Wang Xian had already called and instructed the hospitals to send those patients in need over on his way to the medical hall.

“Be careful. Careful when you shift to the bed.”

“Here, no hurry!”

“Doctor, is the Miracle Doctor here that formidable?”

“If he wasn’t that formidable, would I have taken you here? Speak no more after you enter. You need to abide by the rules. Otherwise, you’ll bear the consequences. You should have found out about the reputation of the Divine Dragon Medical Hall these past two days.”

The conversation between the family members of the patient and the doctor was heard from the outside.

One by one, three patients were brought in one shot.

Wang Xian stood up and swept his gaze across the three patients. “Payment first, and I guarantee your recovery!”

After his shout, he went to the patient and began his treatment.

“Miracle Doctor Wang. I brought my son here. Please take a look at him!”

At this point, a voice was heard.

“Bring him upstairs first. You need to queue for getting treatment!” Wang Xian did not look back at him as he spoke.

“Mm.” Maniac Ji was not displeased at all. He immediately signaled to the people behind him with gestures.

The few of them nodded and carried a juvenile out from a car outside with care.

The juvenile was 14 or 15 years old with rosy cheeks, and did not seem like a patient at all.

However, the juvenile was unconscious with no signs of waking up. One could vaguely see the black bones of the juvenile.

Wang Xian was treating another three patients. To avoid being watched, he got a few curtains in the room so that no one could see him from the outside.

Maniac Ji watched everything Wang Xian was doing. Subsequently, he stood quietly at the side.

The rest of the family members were standing at the side too.

“Is this the place?”

“Divine Dragon Medical Hall... it should be here. I heard there’s a new Miracle Doctor that entered the Miracle Doctor Chart. Now he’s ranked 18, so he should be quite skillful.”

“He beat Fang Huazi to earn his ranking, but he has no cases to prove his reputation. Let’s try and see if he can cure Big Brother’s injuries. If not, we’ll have to find the Miracle Doctor from the Medical Saint Sect!”

Just then, there were a few middle-aged men talking outside the door. They were dressed uniformly with a wolf embroidered on their clothes.

“Is Miracle Doctor Wang around?” asked the three of them directly. When they stepped into the medical hall, they frowned when they saw that people were standing around in silence.

“Queue up if you’re here for treatment!”

Wang Xian answered impassively when he heard the voice outside.

The three of them were stunned and chuckled immediately. “Dianlang Sect would like to invite Miracle Doctor Wang to Rongzhou to treat our big brother. We’ll reward you handsomely then!”

“Rongzhou?” Wang Xian was slightly taken by surprise, as no one had ever come to Rivertown to invite him for treatment.

It looked like his reputation had traveled far, which was a good thing.

“I don’t have much time these next two days. You can bring him over!” Wang Xian smiled and replied. Rongzhou might not be far from here, but it would take four to five hours of traveling. He would waste a day if he traveled back and forth, which was a troublesome thing.

“Hur? The middle-aged man in the center knit his eyebrow slightly and said again, “Miracle Doctor Wang, our Big Brother’s injuries are quite severe. He’s not fit to travel so far. I hope you can come along with us.”

“How much are you paying if I cure him?!” Wang Xian asked immediately as he frowned.

“$20 million. So long as you can cure our Big Brother’s injuries, we will pay you $20 million. Also, we’ll provide those required herbs and Spiritual Medicines!” the middle-aged man continued.

“$20 million?” Wang Xian shook his head and declined. “I’m busy!”

“You...”

The middle-aged man was stunned as his expression turned awful. It was more than respectful for a first-class sect, Dianlang Sect, here to invite a Miracle Doctor that was ranked 18.

But the other party did not even give them any face. Besides, he did not even come out to show his face.

“Miracle Doctor Wang, we can negotiate the price again. You should at least show your face. You’re not showing respect to us if you do this.” The middle-aged man darkened his expression as he spoke to Wang Xian.

Wang Xian, who was treating a patient inside with his Azure Dragon Energy, frowned. Impatiently, he drew the curtain open and looked at the three of them outside.

“I’m busy. If you want to get treatment, bring the patient over. Make your choice, and stop interrupting my treatment of other patients!”

Wang Xian looked at the three middle-aged men and spoke without any patience.

“Fu*k, it took us almost five hours to get here just to invite you over. Is this the right attitude? Your ranking isn’t high, and you’re fu*king proud of it. How could you not give a face to Dianlang Sect?!”

A middle-aged man looked at Wang Xian with fury on his face. “Looking at you, I don’t think you deserve your reputation. You look so young. I wonder what means you used to win Fang Huazi!”

“That’s enough, Third Brother. Stop it!” The middle-aged man in the center frowned slightly and waved his hand to stop him. He then looked at Wang Xian and coldly said, “We heard about your reputation, and that you’re young and promising. But you’re such an arrogant fellow that you are not showing the Dianlang Sect respect, even when we came here and invited you. Heh.”

“Scram if you’re not here for treatment!”

Just then, Maniac Ji’s voice was heard from the side before Wang Xian could reply.

He lifted his head and looked at the trio from Dianlang Sect with immense killing intent in his eyes.

The three of them froze as they spun around with nasty looks. An infuriating bellow sounded. “Fu*k you again...”

But when they saw Maniac Ji, they swallowed whatever words they had. Their eyes were wide-open as they looked at him with disbelief.

“You...You...are Maniac Ji...”

The three middle-aged men trembled all of a sudden as they revealed frightening expressions.

Inborn Expert, Maniac Ji, was well-known for his name. They had even seen him before.

Looking at the middle-aged man whose hair was long, and who was filled with a murderous aura...who else other than Maniac Ji could be here?

They swallowed a mouthful of saliva with great fear in their eyes.

“Senior Ji, hello. We’ll leave now. Like now!”

The trio was full of fear. They were well aware that Maniac Ji was a terrifying existence as he had once exterminated a first-class force all by himself.

Even though Dianlang Sect was also a first-class force, they were not that different from the one that Maniac Ji had exterminated.

If their Sect Leader knew they provoked Maniac Ji, they would get slaughtered immediately just to appease Maniac Ji’s anger.

After all, Maniac Ji liked to do things based on his preferences, and he could kill anyone without batting his eyes!
