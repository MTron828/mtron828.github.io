Chapter 1202: The 1203 mansion was my treasure Trove

Translator: 5496903

“What!”

“So Powerful! So powerful! One of the two half-step void interpretation experts was severely injured while the other was killed directly!”

“Hiss, such terrifying strength!”

The miserable shrieks rang out, causing everyone who was about to chase after Wang Xian to freeze. Their faces were filled with shock.

The momentum of their pursuit immediately stopped. They couldn’t help but swallow a mouthful of saliva.

“Who is he? He instantly injured a half-step void interpretation expert and killed one. Is He a void interpretation expert?”

Everyone who was about to ambush and kill Wang Xian stopped as cold sweat appeared on their foreheads.

If they had charged faster just now, they might have died.

“Boom!”

At this moment, the void interpretation expert from the Spirit Array sect rushed over. When he saw Wang Xian’s attack, his pupils constricted slightly.

To kill two insightful void martial artists in an instant, this strength was definitely not something that anyone below the insightful void martial artist could achieve.

“As expected, to be able to enter the ancient proverb mansion, he is not an ordinary powerhouse!”

The insightful void martial artist from the Spirit Array sect also stopped. Looking at Wang Xian’s disappearing figure, his eyes kept flickering.

If the other party concealed his strength, even if he were to chase after him, he would not be able to stop him. He might even be in danger.

In front of the ancient proverb mansion, a few hundred people saw Wang Xian entering the mansion. They charged out and left in a carefree manner.

“Next, let’s go to Blackcloud Castle!”

Wang Xian sensed that no one was chasing after him. He took out a map and made a cross at the location of the ancient proverb mansion, encircling blackcloud castle.

Blackcloud Castle, the second chaotic formation mansion.

Compared to the ancient proverb mansion, blackcloud castle was much larger.

Blackcloud castle was only a hundred kilometers away from here. Wang Xian dashed forward and soon arrived in front of Blackcloud Castle.

Compared to the chaotic formation mansion, there were more people around blackcloud castle.

The entire castle occupied an area of about three to four kilometers. This was not a castle on the ground, but a castle that was more than half sunk into the ground.

About ten meters above the castle, dark clouds covered it.

Half of the castle had been destroyed, and the chaotic array formation had formed a chaotic mansion.

For thousands of years, no one had been able to enter. Even a transcendent level 5 or 6 expert wouldn’t be able to break in.

If the chaotic array formation was attacked with a powerful external force, it might cause a backlash from the array formation.

The explosion of the array formation would blow up the entire mansion. At that time, all the treasures inside would be turned into ruins.

A few days ago, there were still experts who tried to barge in with their powerful strength. After a few explosions and even the experts who tried to barge in were killed, there were no more experts who dared to barge in.

Wang Xian looked at the blackcloud castle. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

There were many entrances to the blackcloud castle. One could even enter through the windows.

The entire castle seemed to be filled with life. It was very likely that there was still life inside.

Wang Xian scanned the surroundings. There were about seven to eight hundred people gathered in groups to think of a way to break the formation.

The corner of his mouth curled up slightly. He found a secret place and looked around.

With a move, Wang Xian easily entered the castle.

“Haha, after looting the mansions of the strong men and demons in the cemetery one by one, the resources obtained are enough for me to Level Up!”

Wang Xian had an excited look on his face. He swept his gaze across the entire Blackcloud Castle and began his treasure hunt.

After entering the huge castle, Wang Xian immediately felt a wave of spiritual energy fluctuation.

He was not in a hurry. He started to search through the houses one by one.

There were not many weapons, armor, and elixirs placed in porcelain bottles. However, after searching through more than ten rooms, Wang Xian managed to find quite a number of them.

“This should be the place where the lord of Blackcloud Castle cultivates!”

Wang Xian pushed open the door of a room and looked at an open space that was the size of a playground. His eyes were sparkling.

“That’s the herb garden. Hiss, there’s a bottle of spiritual liquid over there. What kind of spiritual tree is this?”

The moment he entered, it was as though he had entered a treasure house. Wang Xian’s eyes were shining as he looked around.

CHIRP CHIRP

CHIRP CHIRP

The roars of beasts could be heard one after another. Wang Xian was slightly shocked and quickly looked over.

“Eh? This Is?”

Wang Xian looked over and immediately noticed that five golden monkeys were staring at him curiously.

“It’s a Demon Beast, the Little Yan Monkey. It’s a demon beast with half-step void interpretation. Furthermore, it’s a cub!”

Wang Xian looked at them and scanned his surroundings. Under the trees where the Little Yan monkey was staying, there were six corpses of the Little Yan monkeys that were two meters in size.

“Six Baby Yan Monkeys. Their value is not low!”

Wang Xian smiled. With a move of his arm, a stream of water surrounded all of them.

The Little Yan monkeys that were only at transcendent level six did not have the ability to resist at all. They were caught by Wang Xian and placed into his storage spiritual bag.

Following that, Wang Xian began to harvest the treasures quickly.

Half an hour later, a figure emerged from the blackcloud fort quietly and dashed into the distance.

Around the blackcloud fort, 700 to 800 people were still studying how to enter. Little did they know that there were no more treasures inside.

“My next target is the Blood Spirit Cave!”

Wang Xian flew towards the ocean.

Some of the mansions of the voidwalkers were located at the bottom of the ocean. Some were located at the bottom of the ocean while some were located at the interior of the underwater mountain peaks.

Some of the residences of the experts were luxurious residences that they had built with their powerful strength.

Once they entered the sea, it was like a dragon entering the sea, and their speed suddenly increased.

The reddish seawater emitted a bloody smell. Compared to land, the number of people in the sea was no less than on land.

Everyone went to the bottom of the sea to search for treasures.

There was once someone who found an interspatial ring at the bottom of the sea. In the end, there was a powerful level 6 profound void tier armor inside.

Even a level 1 or level 2 profound void tier expert would not be able to hurt him if he wore the armor.

Moreover, there were many mansions of various experts at the bottom of the sea.

Coming to the bottom of the sea that was 20,000 meters deep, the entire sea was like an abyss. Compared to the land, this place was even more dangerous.

It was possible to encounter some ferocious beasts at any time. Moreover, there were more demonic beasts active in the sea than on land.

The Blood Spirit Cave was located at the bottom of the sea. There was a cave entrance which was covered by a powerful chaotic formation.

There was no one around the blood spirit cave because the chaotic formation here was considered a killing formation.

Once one accidentally touched the formation, one would be killed by the powerful formation. Some people said that this was a certain death entrance. As time passed, no one came to the blood spirit cave.

“This is very convenient for me!”

The corner of Wang Xian’s mouth curled up slightly as he entered the cave directly.

A few hours later, Wang Xian came out from the cave with a face full of joy.

“There are still five mansions in the safer areas for humans. However, four of them have been occupied by powerful people. Only one of them is unoccupied. The rest of these uncracked mansions are more dangerous to the Demonic Beasts!”

“After I obtain the treasures in the last mansion, I will head back immediately to digest the treasures!”

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered as he flew towards the sword mansion of the last powerhouse.
