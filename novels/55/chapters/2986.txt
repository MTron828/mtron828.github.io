Chapter 2987: The vanguard of the 2,987 races

“They were killed by the Dragon King and the rest just like that?”

On the Nine Oblivion Planet, Wang Xian and the rest had already left, along with the four-armed race and the three-eyed race’s powerhouses.

All the citizens raised their heads and stared at the sky in a daze.

The powerhouses at the center of the two universes, who were extremely powerful in their eyes, were instantly killed by the Dragon King and the rest.

The Gap, the huge gap.

Were the Dragon King and the others the powerhouses at the center of the universe, or were they the powerhouses at the center of the Universe?

“The Dragon King and the others are simply too strong, they can even kill the powerhouses at the center of the universe easily!”

Everyone murmured with shock on their faces.

Ten minutes later, they came back to their senses and immediately passed the news to the artificial intelligence system.

Once this news was out, it once again caused everyone to be in an uproar.

The strength of the Dragon King and the others once again shocked everyone.

How Strong was the Dragon King?

How Strong was the Dragon Palace?

For a moment, the entire resplendent starry sky was in a discussion.

When the god Emperors of the glazed domain and the saint domain received this news, their pupils constricted slightly and they were filled with shock.

The current Dragon Palace was even more terrifying than before.

“Dragon King, things are getting worse. The advance army of the four-armed race is rushing towards us!”

Just as the entire resplendent starry sky was discussing the strength of the Dragon Palace, Ba Qi spoke with a solemn expression in the Dragon Palace.

“There are also advance armies from the three-eyed race rushing over.”

On the Dragon Throne, Wang Xian had a solemn expression on his face.

After absorbing the information of the three-eyed race’s experts, Wang Xian gained more information.

The more he knew, the more he knew about the crisis the dragon palace was facing.

“They should be able to reach us in two to three hours. Their advance army shouldn’t be very strong, but it’s still very troublesome.”

Ba Qi guessed based on the memories he obtained.

“It’s a little troublesome.”

Wang Xian nodded and continued, “We still have a chance now. We have to destroy the advance army of the two tribes and kill every single one of them.”

“Also, we have to ensure that their advance army doesn’t inform the people of their tribe of the way to enter the eight desolates and six harmonies!”

The current Dragon Palace only had such a lucky chance.

They had destroyed all the people of the two great races’advance troops. Furthermore, these people did not inform the race about the method to enter.

It was not impossible. From Wang Xian’s point of view, it was still very high.

According to the memories of the expert from the three-eyed race, he only informed an elder from the three-eyed race about the method to enter. He was also a level six void God realm expert. He was the leader of the advance troops this time around.

“Over at the four-armed race, the entrance was also reported to an elder. He is the leader of the advance army of the four-armed race, a level six void God realm expert.”

Ba Qi also spoke.

“The advance army of the three-eyed race and the four-armed race are all members of the race that are closer to the Mo Han clan’s ruins. There shouldn’t be too many experts. A level six void God realm expert should be the limit.”

“There is a high possibility that there are only two level six celestial thearch powerhouses.”

Wang Xian knocked on the dragon throne beside him gently as he pondered in his heart.

“Dragon King, if there are two level six celestial thearch powerhouses, we might be able to kill them.”

Sky Array spoke.

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows when he heard his words. “Sky Array, your formation can’t affect a level six celestial thearch powerhouse, right? If they escape directly, we won’t be able to hold them back at all.”

“Dragon King, my current formation can’t hold them back, but it can still affect them for dozens of seconds. With the strength of the Dragon Cave, we might be able to kill two level six divine emperor powerhouses. However, if there are three level six divine emperor powerhouses, we might not be able to hold them back!”

Sky Array said with a grave tone.

There were too many uncertain factors!

However, the Dragon Palace had to give it a try. Otherwise, when all the experts from the two major clans arrived, the Dragon Palace would have no choice but to give up on the bright starry sky and flee.

Escaping from the bright starry sky was something that Wang Xian and the leaders of the Dragon Palace didn’t want to see.

This was a choice that they had no choice.

“Get Ready, Ao Yao. Bring some men to monitor the two exits. Report immediately if you see them invading.”

“An lie, you go too. Once they arrive, investigate their strength.”

Wang Xian instructed immediately.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Ao Yao, an lie, and the rest replied immediately.

“Prime Minister Gui, order everyone to get ready for battle. Prepare the Dragon Cave. Also, inform Xiao Lan to get ready!”

Wang Xian continued to give orders.

“Yes!”

Prime Minister Gui replied immediately.

“Once the news is confirmed, if we can fight, we must destroy them all. If we can’t fight, we must leave immediately!”

Wang Xian stood up slowly with his eyes shining.

The members of the Dragon Palace nodded their heads heavily.

“Dragon King, I think we can win this battle. I can stay with this deacon Qian from the four-armed race. We will take out all the spare resources of the Dragon Palace to upgrade the demonic fiend to level-five celestial thearch and let him stay with that powerhouse from the three-eyed race. If the two of US act well, we can injure two level-six celestial thearch powerhouses unexpectedly!”

“If that’s the case, the chances of killing all of them will be even higher!”

Ba Qi said at this moment.

“Oh?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and looked at the two level five celestial thearch powerhouses from the two races.

At this moment, the two of them were on their last breaths. The three-eyed powerhouse was already delirious.

“It’s doable. The vitality liquid in the Moon Bay of the ancient lake can heal their injuries. Taking an ordinary fetus can also restore the consciousness of the three-eyed powerhouse. Ba Qi, if you guys are going to stay here, it will have an unexpected effect!” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Tian Chen’s eyes flickered as he spoke.

“Is the current resources of the Dragon Palace sufficient to raise the level of the Demonic Fiend?”

Wang Xian looked at Prime Minister Gui.

“Dragon King, we don’t have enough resources at the moment. However, we can go to the VELURIYAM domain to exchange for some resources. Raising the level of the demonic fiend shouldn’t be a problem!”

Prime Minister Gui said.

“Alright, then take two ordinary fetus fruits and exchange them for a large number of elixirs. After I consume them, I will raise his strength.”

Wang Xian said immediately.

At that time, it would be worth it even if he used up some of his dragon Qi to increase the demonic fiend. After all, this was a critical moment. The two of them would be of great use if they could completely destroy the opponent’s level six divine emperor powerhouse.

“Yes!”

The leaders of the Dragon Palace immediately began to prepare.

Ao Yao led his subordinates and an lie as they flew toward the two exits of the eight desolation six directions.

The enormous demon cave beside the Dragon Palace slowly rose into the air.

“Roar!”

Ao crab flew out and roared. His million underlings flew out and flew toward the Dragon Cave.

The arrow dragon species, the dolphin species, also flew toward the Dragon Cave and stood on the fighting ring.

“Wu Wu!”

The Little Blue House flew into the sky. Its enormous body gave off a prehistoric aura. The other dragon species of the Dragon Palace all stood on their bodies.

All the members of the Dragon Palace were ready for battle!

They were ready at all times!
