Chapter 563: Saint Forge Workshop

Yong Chang City was a huge and developed city.

Most of the old buildings were built from huge black stones and wouldn’t be shorter than twenty to thirty meters.

Orderly streets crossed and the most central region of Yong Chang City was where four main paths merged.

At this moment, the entire Yong Chang City was still well lit despite it being past 8 PM.

“It’s so crowded. There are probably seven to eight million people in the entire Yong Chang City!”

Wang Xian was astonished by the seemingly boundaryless huge city. While standing in the air, he recalled what the other disciples from Mt Fengyu had told him.

The central region of Yong Chang City was the most prosperous area. At the same time, it was where many martial artists gathered.

Those who lived in the vicinity were either rich and wealthy families or experts from the three Immortal Sects.

Yong Chang Immortal Sect, Immortal Slaying Sect and Da Hong Immortal Sect. They had been in Yong Chang world for over a thousand years and their relationship had become complicated.

There were countless occasions of marriage between disciples of these three Immortal Sects, forming countless families that were affiliated with these three Immortal Sects.

As a result, there were various families in Yong Chang City on top of the three Immortal Sects. These families had the backing of the Immortal Sects and were established by disciples of these Immortal Sects.

There were also ordinary people in Yong Chang City. However, martial artists made up the majority. There were also powerful Budding Realm experts living within the city.

Naturally, there were also Immortal Realm experts in it.

The common currency was largely spiritual stones.

In the past, the three Immortal Sects had chosen this piece of bountiful land for Yong Chang Cauldron to suppress. It was only natural to expect that the resources available to this place were exceptionally immense.

Various spiritual medicine and spiritual equipment was exchanged within Yong Chang City.

In Yong Chang City, one could even get their hands on Level 5 and 6 elixir pills.

Level 10 spiritual equipment was common while Level 11 spiritual equipment would appear from time to time. As for Level 12 spiritual equipment, it could occasionally be found in auctions.

This was the powerful and prosperous Yong Chang City.

Wang Xian arrived at the most central region where the four main paths of Yong Chang City merged. He started observing his surroundings.

“Equipment refining workshops, elixir pills shops, weapons shops and spiritual equipment shops... This place is really prosperous!”

Wang Xian looked around and headed towards a shop.

An Inborn Spiritual Weapon is worth roughly seven hundred spiritual stones!

A Level 5 elixir pill is worth roughly eight hundred spiritual stones!

Spiritual Flame Ball! There are spiritual flame balls for sale here!

As Wang Xian walked across the street of shops, he was astonished.

In his view, the Inborn Spiritual Weapons and Level 5 elixir pills were all relatively cheaper than in the Underworld.

Perhaps that was because this place had immense resources.

Saint Forge Workshop! The disciples from Mt Fengyu told me that this is the strongest and most reputable place in Yong Chang City for refining elixir pills and equipment. This place was established by experts from both Yong Chang Immortal Sect and Da Hong Immortal Sect. This shall be the place!

Wang Xian revealed a faint smile.

Just as the other disciples of Mt Fengyu had said, those who could refine elixir pills or refine equipment were those who could earn spiritual stones and resources the quickest.

Wang Xian wasn’t thinking of working for the Saint Forge Workshop. Instead, he was thinking of becoming a freelance alchemist or blacksmith of this place.

Freelance alchemists and blacksmiths could sign a contract with the Saint Forge Workshop. They would provide you with a certain set of materials in exchange for a fixed amount of spiritual equipment or elixir pills. As for the remaining materials, they were considered as the freelancer’s remuneration.

For Wang Xian, this was the perfect arrangement. He strongly believed that with his insane Origin Source Arts, he would obtain an unimaginable amount of resources regardless of whether he had chosen equipment refining or elixir pills refining.

Not a second to waste! Wang Xian thought to himself as he stepped into the Saint Forge Workshop.

“Hi, Sir, welcome! Are you interested in getting spiritual equipment or elixir pills?”

When an employee saw Wang Xian stepping in, he immediately welcomed Wang Xian with a faint smile.

“Hello! Are you guys recruiting alchemists?” Wang Xian asked the employee.

“Alchemist? Are you applying to be an alchemist or an alchemist apprentice?” the employee asked Wang Xian.

“Alchemist! I know about elixir pill refining,” Wang Xian replied directly.

“Please come with me.”

The employee stole another glance at Wang Xian and felt that Wang Xian was even younger than him. He reminded, “It isn’t easy to become an alchemist of our Saint Forge Workshop. The minimum grade elixir pills you have to refine is Level 3. Moreover, you need to reach a minimum of a thirty percent success rate!”

“I understand!”

Wang Xian nodded his head as he followed behind the employee.

“I’ve succeeded! Haha! I’ve succeeded!”

When he arrived at the back of the shop, Wang Xian could hear exhilarated laughter.

“Master Xuanhuo has really succeeded!”

“I’ve succeeded! Finally! Although I’m a little ashamed of wasting ten sets of materials, I’ve finally succeeded!”

“That’s great! Brother Ao, this is a Level 12 spiritual weapon. You can now challenge for the number one disciple of Da Hong Immortal Sect with this Water Shark!”

“Oh gosh, it’s a Level 12 spiritual weapon. Many Budding Realm experts in the sect couldn’t afford this either!”

Behind the store of Saint Forge Workshop, there were two extremely broad areas. One was for refining elixir pills while the other was for equipment refining. The area for refining elixir pills was a little further from the Saint Forge Workshop.

Five young men stood before an old man while discussing fervently. In the middle of the group was a beautiful spiritual sword.

“Master Xuanhuo is the strongest master blacksmith in our Saint Forge Workshop. He can even forge Level 12 spiritual equipment now. Remember to be courteous when you meet him in the future!”

When the employee heard their conversation, his eyes beamed with excitement.

Creating a single Level 12 spiritual weapon after using eleven sets of materials, what a waste of precious materials!

Wang Xian looked across and shook his head plainly.

“Haha! Congratulations, Old Huo! This is the second piece of Level 12 spiritual equipment you have forged. With your level of forging skills, you could easily rank in the top five in the entire Yong Chang world.

At this moment, a blacksmith heard the commotion and walked out of his room to give his congratulations.

There were even some alchemists who went over to congratulate him.

“Haha! I was lucky! I was lucky!”

Master Xuanhuo smiled contentedly. This was Level 12 spiritual equipment! Other than those Immortals in Yong Chang world, who could possibly forge one?

There were definitely less than two people and he was one of them.

“Congratulations! Master Xuanhuo could very well be a grandmaster-class blacksmith!”

Five to six alchemists walked over and congratulated Master Xuanhuo.

The employee beside Wang Xian saw the alchemists. After their conversation had ended, he walked towards an old man.

“Master Qingming, there’s someone here to apply to be an alchemist!”

“Huh? Who? We are always in need of more alchemists!” Master Qingming raised an eyebrow and asked loudly.

“Master, he’s right there!”

The employee pointed at Wang Xian and spoke with a smile.

“Huh? Are you sure you are applying to be an alchemist?”

When Master Qingming saw Wang Xian, he was a little shocked and started scrutinizing him.

“Yeah. I’m here to apply to become an alchemist. A freelance alchemist!” Wang Xian answered Master Qingming directly.

There were two types of alchemists in Saint Forge Workshop. One was internal alchemist while the other was a freelance alchemist.

For an internal alchemist, they would receive a fixed amount of spiritual stones each month after passing the assessment.

As for freelance alchemist, he would have to collect materials from Saint Forge Workshop and submit a fixed amount of elixir pills.

If there were materials remaining, Saint Forge Workshop would have no claim to them!ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels
