Chapter 324: Appearance of Hao Zhong and the Soundless Instrument (2)

Enchantment Sword, as its name suggested, was a sword of love.

According to the latest historical records, Hao Zhong was given to a woman from her husband. Moreover, the husband had included the Enchantment Sword below the zither for his wife for protection.

The Enchantment Sword was one of the famed swords in history. Although it wasn’t as well-known as the ten famed swords, its strength was still well-regarded and known by many.

This was a sword for the ladies and was featherlight. It was forged from frost metal and the water from a frosty pond.

The elemental attribute of the sword was water. It was said that it was just a tinge inferior to an Inborn Spiritual Weapon.

As it was kept with the Hao Zhong zither, it was recorded as Hao Zhong Enchantment Sword by historians.

Recalling the information regarding Hao Zhong and the Enchantment Sword, Tang Yinxuan couldn’t help but pout.

She removed the Enchantment Sword from the bottom and unsheathed it.

Shingz!

As the sword was unsheathed, the sound it made was pleasing to the ears, like flowing water.

The entire sword was red other than the edge of the blade. It looked extremely stunning.

The sword was light but exceptionally sharp. It was as though there was water flowing on it.

Tang Yinxuan waved it lightly and the water energy raged. She wasn’t well versed in swordsmanship and only knew a little about it.

She looked at the bottom of Hao Zhong. Just as she had expected, there was a sword manual in it.

The sword manual recorded the Enchantment Swordplay.

Hao Zhong is an Inborn Spiritual Weapon while the Enchantment Sword is a weapon exceptionally close to the level of an Inborn Spiritual Weapon.

Tang Yinxuan held them dearly and was really satisfied with them.

However, at the thought of the meaning behind these weapons, her expression changed.

“Since I have accepted them, just forget about the hidden significance behind them!”

She smiled gently and placed the Hao Zhong back into the cover carefully. Looking at the bright moon outside her room, her mood greatly improved. She walked back to her bed and started her rest.

The next morning, the entire Nine Peaks Mountain was shrouded in a festive liked atmosphere. Beautiful music could be heard and the surrounding birds were dancing in the skies.

Other than the alluring music, calls of various birds formed a beautiful melody.

Thousands and thousands of birds were flapping their wings and moving with the music.

All the disciples of the Heavenly Sound Sect had to practice their musical instruments and cultivate in the morning.

It was especially so for today as the entire Nine Peaks Mountain was filled with all kinds of music.

The selection of the Saint had ended yesterday and the selection of the Saintess would start today.

Tang Yinxuan carried Hao Zhong and arrived at the backyard just like any other morning. She gently cleaned the place where she would be placing her zither.

Placing her zither on the table, the surrounding music had not affected her emotions.

Tang Yinxuan’s eyes lit up as she looked at Hao Zhong before her. She placed her slender and fair fingers gently upon it.

Ling!

A musical note sounded. At this moment, this note resounded rapidly throughout a radius of a thousand meters.

“What happened? Why did my zither go soundless?”

“This is strange. What is happening? That musical note previously erased all other sounds!”

“What is this about? What’s the issue? Why is my Erhu not making any sound!?” [1]

At this point, raucous discussion broke out around her. Exclamations and questions came from disciples of the Heavenly Sound Sect in all directions.

Tang Yinxuan was taken aback. She stared with her eyes wide open at Hao Zhong, which was placed in front of her. With a bitter smile on her face, she kept it away and returned to her room.

At this very moment, a woman on the main peak of the Nine Peaks Mountain opened her eyes abruptly.

“What’s that sound? Could it be the Heavenly Sound Zither?”

“It doesn’t sound like... It doesn’t sound like...!”

The woman stood up, closed her eyes and wanted to listen attentively. However, the same sound did not come again. In the end, she sat back down, feeling baffled.

...

“Fang Tianhua became the Saint yesterday. I wonder who will become the Saintess today!”

“Do you even need to ask about this? It will definitely be Senior sister Hu. Senior sister Hu is now a Half-step to Inborn Realm expert and possesses the Level 7 Ancient Temple Zither. Among the female disciples, she tops in terms of strength.”

“It’s still hard to tell. Tang Yinxuan, Fang Jiuhua and Ouyang Yan have all reached the Half-step to Inborn Realm. They are also strong contenders!”

“In my opinion, Senior sister Hu’s chances of winning are at least eighty percent. Strength is just one aspect and you should consider their influence too. Many people are supporting Senior sister Hu now. Moreover, Senior sister Hu has two Half-step to Inborn Realm subordinates. One of them even made it to the top 20 of the Outstanding Young Heroes Chart!” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

When the sun had risen, the disciples of the Heavenly Sound Sect made their way towards the main training field.

On their way there, the disciples were discussing fervently. However, they weren’t too concerned about what had caused their musical instruments to go soundless.

Tang Yinxuan carried two zithers as she made her way to the main training field. Along the way, the other disciples greeted her respectfully.

There were also some disciples who simply gave her a cold glare.

The main training field of the Heavenly Sound Sect lay in the middle of the Nine Peaks Mountain. The Heavenly Sound Sect didn’t particularly have lots of disciples. For young men and women, there were only approximately a thousand of them.

They had exceptional demeanors and were either handsome or beautiful. In terms of looks, the disciples of the Heavenly Sound Sect were all outstanding.

Despite that, Tang Yinxuan still shone brightly with her exceptional vibes and exquisite looks.

The disciples of the Heavenly Sound Sect arrived at the training field one after another. They stood in an orderly fashion around it while waiting patiently.

The arrival of Tang Yinxuan had drawn the attention of many people.

Other than her, there were also a few other girls who were exceptionally attention-grabbing.

“Senior sister Hu is here!”

At this moment, a scream came from the crowd. Everyone looked over and saw an alluring young lady with an enchanting figure walking towards the training field.

She was dressed in black and looked just like a succubus in the night. Every action of hers drew the attention of all the men in the field.

A large number of male disciples couldn’t help but swallow their saliva.

She was one of the few disciples that practiced the Fei Fei Demonic Note.

Two young men followed behind the young lady proudly. Despite being surrounded by outstanding disciples of the Heavenly Sound Sect, they were still carrying a slight sense of superiority.

“Eh, take a look! Senior sister Hu didn’t bring her Ancient Temple Zither along but another zither instead.”

“That’s true. It looks a little ordinary. However, with Senior sister Hu’s strength, others wouldn’t be a match for her even if she used an ordinary zither!”

“The Saint is here!”

At this moment, the Saint, who was dressed in elegant Heavenly Sound Sect’s traditional costume, walked out proudly. Over a dozen disciples followed behind him deferentially.

The Saint’s face looked devoid of expressions and seemed exceptionally cold, callous but exceptional.

“Saint!” the surrounding crowd greeted the Saint respectfully.

The Saint nodded his head faintly, walked to a seat below the stage and sat down.

This was a seat reserved for the higher management of the Heavenly Sound Sect and the Saint naturally was qualified to have a seat too.

Soon, the Elders, Vice Sect Leader and Sect Leader of the Heavenly Sound Sect arrived at the training field.
