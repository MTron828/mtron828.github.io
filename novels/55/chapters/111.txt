“Director Wang, I have negotiated the terms with the boss of the shop next door. As the floor area isn’t that big, the sale price would be $7 million. If you want to rent it, it will be $50,000 a month!”

In the office of First-grade Restaurant, Manager Huang reported to Wang Xian.

“Try to negotiate the price down a little and buy it directly. After which, find a good interior designer for me. Inform me again when everything’s done,” Wang Xian said to Manager Huang.

“Alright, Director Wang. Leave this to me!” Manager Huang nodded his head.

Hmm.

Wang Xian nodded his head. Looking at the earnings over the last few days, the earnings had remained at the level of approximately $1.5 million.

Now that First-grade Restaurant had basically reached its maximum capacity, it would be hard to improve on these earnings. This was because the restaurant’s size was fixed and the number of customers they could get each day was limited.

After having lunch in the shop, Wang Xian headed back to the school.

“Eh, that’s Wang Xian. Look! It’s him!”

“Yeah, it’s him. He’s pretty good-looking. However, it’s unreal that he could make two goddesses fall in love with him. Perhaps Guan Shuqing and Lan Qingyue weren’t really interested in him and were simply having a meal with him!”

“Did you see it? Xu Qingcheng said that he wants to challenge him on the school forum. He’s interested to see why he is qualified to have dinner with Lan Qingyue!”

“Really? Xu Qingcheng is a black belt taekwondo expert. No one is a match for him in the entire University of Rivertown. In fact, not many people in the entire Rivertown could possibly defeat him. Challenging Wang Xian would be like toying with him. I believe Wang Xian wouldn’t be that dumb to accept the challenge and spar with Xu Qingcheng.”

“Xu Qingcheng has only said he would like to have a simple sparring with him. Sparring could be in other aspects. However, if Wang Xian did not accept, he would be a coward and be the butt of the joke in the University of Rivertown. He has to accept it!”

Walking on the pathway through the campus, Wang Xian could vaguely hear the discussions of the surrounding students. He frowned slightly as he walked towards his dormitory.

“Old Wang, you are back.”

Just as he stepped into the room, Wang Dahai immediately turned over and greeted him.

There was only him in the room. Zhang Wen and Zhang Feng must be accompanying their girlfriends currently.

As for Wang Dahai, it was a rare occasion that he wasn’t playing games. Instead, he was staring at the computer.

“Huh? Did something happen again?” Wang Xian asked directly.

While he was walking back, he had heard a little about it.

“Old Wang, don’t be angry when you see this. Xu Qingcheng is being too arrogant just because he has some strength. I despise this type of person the most!”

Wang Dahai rambled on.

Wang Xian walked to his study desk and switched on his computer. Wang Dahai immediately brought his chair over and sat beside Wang Xian.

“Old Wang, I feel that you shouldn’t have to entertain this guy. One of the three Prince Charmings? Aw shucks! He’s still not as incredible as our Old Wang!”

Wang Dahai was commenting from the side while Wang Xian clicked into the forum to take a look. One of the threads had over 9,000 replies. Once again, there was a thread that had a relatively large number of replies.

Wang Xian clicked into the thread. It was created by Xu Qingcheng.

The content of the thread was as follows.

[There’s a man of the hour in our school recently. Yeah, he’s the second-year student, Wang Xian, who ate with two goddesses in a day. I won’t be going to the details as I believe everyone would have known about this. Currently, he is given the nickname “Immoral Beast, Wang Xian.” Hehe, that’s an elegant nickname. Today, I would like to invite the Immoral Beast, Wang Xian... Oops, a slip of the tongue. Haha! I’d like to invite him to spar. I would like to see what you are capable of.]

[Sparring is not limited to just violence. It could also be in many other aspects. Show me what you are capable of. I’m really curious. Haha, if you aren’t a coward, look for me, Xu Qingcheng, at the Taekwondo gym!]

It wasn’t a very long thread but fully showed how Xu Qingcheng had taunted Wang Xian. It was full of mockery.

In the comments section, there were also a lot of people supporting the idea.

Wang Xian eating with their two goddesses had ignited the anger of the majority of the male student population.

It was especially clear from the pictures taken that Wang Xian was acting very intimate with Guan Shuqing and Lan Qingyue.

This further infuriated many. It’s fine if you just date one of them. However, you are a scumbag for being a two-timer!

Unforgivable!

Wang Xian looked through the thread but kept his composure.

“Xu Qingcheng!”

Wang Xian sank into deep thought. In that case, I’ll just make him the example. I’ll probably save myself a lot of trouble too!

Wang Xian thought to himself and stood up gradually.

“Eh, Old Wang. Where are you going?” Seeing that emotionless look, Wang Dahai quickly asked him.

“To the Taekwondo club,” said Wang Xian.

“What? You are really thinking of going? Old Wang, forget it! Just forget it! That Xu Qingcheng is really strong. We don’t have to entertain him. They are just a bunch of jealous dudes!”

Wang Dahai spoke immediately. He was really worried that Wang Xian would go.

Xu Qingcheng had a black belt in Taekwondo after all. If Wang Xian went ahead and sparred with him, even if Wang Xian wasn’t severely injured, he would likely be humiliated.

“Relax, I wouldn’t go if I was not confident.” Wang Xian shook his head slightly and smiled.

“You...” Wang Dahai knew Wang Xian was a little stubborn. He shook his head and said, “Alright then. I’ll go with you.”

“Mm. Let’s go.”

Wang Xian nodded his head and walked straight to the Taekwondo Club.

Taekwondo Club was a relatively large club in the University of Rivertown. Taekwondo originated from Korea but was very popular within the country.

This was because of the way of thinking of the past generations. Martial arts from the country wouldn’t be imparted to external parties, let alone ancient martial arts.

As for Taekwondo, Wang Xian had no comment on it.

The clubs in Rivertown had their activities congregated in an area.

When Wang Xian walked towards the Taekwondo club, he immediately attracted many people’s attention.

“Eh, isn’t that the year-two student, Wang Xian? Could it be that he is heading to the Taekwondo Club?”

“Looking at where he is heading, he must be going to the Taekwondo Club. Xu Qingcheng just issued him a challenge recently. Could it be that he’s going there to accept it?” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“This is interesting. Let’s go. Let’s follow and take a look!”

“Wang Xian is accepting Xu Qingcheng’s invitation. This is going to be interesting. If he chooses to fight with Xu Qingcheng, this will likely turn out to be tragic for him!”

“Hurry! Let’s go! We can post it on the forum later and it will definitely shock the entire school.”

The students along the way followed behind in excitement as they headed towards the Taekwondo Club.

Wang Xian didn’t mind the growing crowd behind him and arrived at the entrance of the Taekwondo Club.

Creak!

Wang Xian revealed a faint smile. Walking to the door, he pushed the door open directly.

The Taekwondo Club had a huge room and there were many students still wearing Taekwondo uniforms while practicing.

When the door was pushed open, some members looked out inquisitively.

Wang Xian stood at the entrance and swept his eyes across before walking in slowly.

“Get Xu Qingcheng over. Tell him that Wang Xian is here!”

Some members of the Taekwondo looked over with sarcasm.

“Hehe, he’s here. It’s time to see how our captain will torture him!”
