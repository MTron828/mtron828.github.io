This collaboration was a windfall for the Mu Family.

Similarly, it was also a windfall for Wang Xian. Moreover, his was an even larger windfall.

If Wang Xian was to learn what the two old men from the Mu Family were thinking, he would be exhilarated instead of being infuriated.

“Two hundred sets of materials for Level 10 spiritual equipment and twenty sets of materials for Level 11 spiritual equipment. This would mean that I’ll be able to get a hundred pieces of Level 10 spiritual equipment and ten pieces of Level 11 spiritual equipment!”

“Two hundred sets of materials for Level 5 elixir pills and forty sets of Level 6 elixir pills. I’ll be able to get four hundred Level 5 elixir pills and eighty Level 6 elixir pills!”

“Summing them up, that’s close to roughly thirteen to fourteen million points of dragon energy!”

“I might not need a month to reach Level 9 after all. When the time comes, this world won’t be able to restrain me!”

Wang Xian lifted his head slightly and revealed a faint smile.

“Let’s finish up the materials for today!”

Twenty disciples from Mt. Xue requested to refine spiritual equipment or elixir pills. Although it wasn’t as much as the previous day, Wang Xian still reaped substantial benefits.

The next day, the disciples from Mt. Xue collected their spiritual equipment and elixir pills. The potential customers from Mt. Xue had been completely exhausted.

The business of the shop died down once again.

Wang Xian sat down on a chair and took a glance into the space ring. Seeing the spiritual equipment in it, he couldn’t help but smile.

The upgrade of the Dragon Field requires a thousand pieces of spiritual equipment and Inborn-level materials. Soon, I’ll be able to collect sufficient materials!

When I get back, the Dragon Palace will be able to get a substantial upgrade. I wonder how Shuqing, Qingyue and the rest are doing... Xiao Yu and Adjaya too!

Wang Xian sank into deep thought.

At the entrance of the shop, Wang Xian was about to receive the second batch of customers.

“F*ck them! Those scumbags from Mt. Zhenliu made us wait in the queue by virtue of their good relationship with Saint Forge Workshop. By the time it reaches our turn, it will probably be a few months from now!”

“The most damning thing would be those scumbags from Mt. Zhenliu creating more troubles for us in the dark. If they instruct Saint Forge Workshop to constantly move us to the back of the queue, we really wouldn’t know when our turn will come. Now that Yong Chang world is about to descend into the real world, we might be facing off against the other eight cauldron worlds. All the forces are turning their resources into strength in preparation for the upcoming uncertainty!”

“All the equipment and elixir pill refining shops are experiencing explosive growth in business. Several elixir pill shops are even facing issues of sticking out. If we want to get elixir pills or spiritual equipment, we could only find alchemists or blacksmiths to refine for us!”

“The alchemist and blacksmith in our Tianwen Sect are truly a waste of our precious resources. Their success rate is too low. We’ve got to find a master!”

“If only we learned about the outside world a little earlier. Now that we are a step slower, we have to wait a long time even when we want to get prepared!”

“Eh, there’s a small shop right here!”

The row of five people conversed as they walked. They were clearly in a foul mood. When they walked past Wang Xian’s shop, a middle-aged man looked inquisitively at the signboard.

“Blacksmith master, alchemist master? Could there be masters in a small shop like this?”

The middle-aged man stared at the shop with doubts as he mumbled to himself.

“A master?”

The other four men were also doubtful. “A small wretched shop like this would have masters?”

“It must be a scam. It’s obvious that this is a front for scams. There’s no way a master would remain in a wretched shop like this!” an old man snorted coldly.

“Yeah. This shop looks a little too dilapidated. How can there be a master? F*ck! They sure aren’t ashamed of lying!”

A middle-aged man seconded and nodded his head as he continued walking towards it.

“Let me go take a look!” a middle-aged man with long hair said coldly to the other four men with him.

“Old Ge, what’s the point? Isn’t it obvious that this is just a front for scams? How could there be...?”

“I’m just taking a look. We can’t find any other blacksmith master, right?”

The middle-aged man with long hair interrupted his sentence emotionlessly before he continued walking towards the shop.

“Old Ge, you are grasping at straws!”

The other middle-aged man frowned. Seeing that the middle-aged man with long hair didn’t pay heed to his advice, he followed grumpily.

“Let’s go in too. If this shop is scamming, we will teach them a good lesson and let them know the consequences of scamming others!” the middle-aged man said to the other three men. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Go!”

The four men followed the middle-aged man with long hair into the shop. They looked around and instantly frowned deeply.

“Hey, kid! Where’s the master in your shop?”

When the group saw that the shop didn’t even have places for customers to sit, they were clearly displeased. When they saw Wang Xian sitting in the shop, they shouted.

Huh?

Wang Xian frowned when he saw the five of them stepping in and shouting at him. He replied plainly, “Are you guys looking to refine elixir pills or equipment?”

“Hey, brother, there’s an alchemist master and blacksmith master in this shop?” the middle-aged man with long hair suppressed his emotions and asked Wang Xian.

“Yeah!”

Wang Xian nodded his head.

“Are you sure?” The other four men were suspicious. “Please invite that master out. We would like to do business with him!”

“You can speak to me. Are you guys looking to refine elixir pills or spiritual equipment?” Wang Xian looked across the five people, maintained a smile and asked.

“You?” The four men stared at Wang Xian. Even that middle-aged man with long hair frowned slightly.

“This business concerns over a hundred pieces of spiritual equipment and a large number of elixir pills. Can I trouble you to invite that master out?” The middle-aged man held his emotions in check as he spoke to Wang Xian once again.

“I’m the master. If you guys are looking to refine spiritual equipment or elixir pills, you can speak directly to me!” Wang Xian answered them.

“Are you freaking kidding me? A kid like you is a master?”

Just as Wang Xian completed his words, the other four men at the back stared harshly at him.

“Kid, if you are a master, I’ll be a grandmaster. Freak! You must be courting a beating!”

“Just as I thought, there’s no master in this wretched shop. This must be a scam and this kid must be really eager for a beating!”

The four of them exchanged words while staring angrily at Wang Xian.

Even that middle-aged man with long hair was pulling a long face.

“Kid, your joke isn’t funny at all. If there isn’t any master here, why did you claim to have an alchemist master and blacksmith master on your signboard? It isn’t going to end well if you dare to lie to us!”

The middle-aged man with long hair spoke to Wang Xian in a solemn tone.

“You don’t believe me?” Wang Xian raised an eyebrow. “Hand me the materials and you will naturally know!”

“Are you still going to lie at this point? You must be thinking of scamming us out of our materials! Is that it?”

An old man stared harshly at Wang Xian while gradually emitting terrifying aura.

“If you don’t believe me, you can leave!”

Wang frowned and stared right at the five people. His tone had also gradually turned colder!

“Leave? We will definitely leave. However, I’m going to teach you a good lesson for fooling us before we leave!”

A bad-tempered middle-aged man clenched his fists tightly as he walked towards Wang Xian.

The middle-aged man with long hair didn’t attempt to stop him while he stared harshly at Wang Xian.

Their Tianwen Sect was also one of the six sects below the Immortal Sects with over ten thousand disciples.

As part of the higher management of the sect, they were already in a foul mood before they came in. Yet, a kid from a shop was fooling them.

This kid was a master?

Tsk!

Even if they weren’t killing him, they would want to teach him a good lesson!
