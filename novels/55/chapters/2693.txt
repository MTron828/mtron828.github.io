2694 2694 took the initiative to attack

“Prime Minister Gui, how is the investigation of the situation in the northern Abyss coming along?”

In the main Dragon Palace of the ancient Sky Planet in the center of the Demon Island, Wang Xian sat on the Dragon Throne and asked Prime Minister Gui.

Below, Prime Minister Gui, the Heaven Array Formation, and all the leaders had gathered at the Dragon King’s Palace.

“Dragon King, we have already gone over to investigate. The investigation results are out.”

Prime Minister Gui nodded and looked at Ao Yao.

“Dragon King, according to our investigation, on the northern front, there are still two peak immortal King Level Abyss Seeds, 16 immortal King Level 9 abyss seeds, 55 immortal King Level 8 seeds, 170 immortal King Level 7 seeds, and more than 50,000 immortal king level seeds.”

Ao Yao spoke to Wang Xian.

The Dragon Palace had been stable for 20 days. Basically, everything had been settled. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Wang Xian wanted to hunt down the abyssal seeds on the northern front. Similarly, the heaven array and the leaders of the Dragon Palace had similar thoughts.

War was the best and fastest way to improve the Dragon Palace.

“How much do you think we will lose if we attack?”

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered slightly. This figure was equivalent to the strength of the Abyss species in the Eastern Abyss.

With the current strength of the Dragon Palace, they could suppress this group of Abyss species. However, if they really fought, the Dragon Palace would suffer losses.

“Dragon King, even if we lose over 10,000 immortal king level powerhouses, as long as we can destroy this group of Abyss species, it would be extremely profitable for us.”

Tian Chen’s eyes gleamed as he said.

If a force from the Dragon Palace killed all the abyss seeds in the north, it would be a huge profit.

“I’m afraid that if another powerful abyss seed appeared in the depths of the abyss, we would be in trouble.”

Prime Minister Gui muttered. Encircling the northern Abyss was a little risky, and the unknown was a little too great.

“Two Peak Undying God King Abyss seeds, I can control dragon peak to completely tie them down. If we prevent them from escaping, with the world end ruler and world end ruler, I have a 100% confidence to kill them within 15 minutes.”

Tian Chen said confidently.

“The Dragon Palace now has 21 undying Emperor Level 9 warriors and Dragon King. After removing 3 to control the world’s end ruler, there are 18 left. 18 against 16 undying Emperor Level 9 abyssal seeds, the difference isn’t too big, there’s a risk.”

“The other levels are still better, our dragon palace warriors can suppress them.”

Prime Minister Gui calculated each other’s strength and said.

The surrounding leaders of the Dragon Palace fell into deep thought. If that was the case, this battle would not be easy to handle.

“We can use the world’s end ruler to kill a few immortal king level 9 abyssal seeds first. That way, there won’t be much of a problem.”

Tian Chen said from the side.

“What I’m afraid of is that the two peak immortal king level abyssal seeds will tie down our side’s high-end combat strength.”

“Dragon King, there is a way.”

Prime Minister Gui shook his head. After pondering for a moment, he looked at Wang Xian.

“Oh?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and gestured for him to continue.

“Dragon King, currently, we have over 100,000 life planets. Although these planets can bring us benefits, speaking of which, the most important thing for our dragon palace is the ocean. We can exchange the land.”

“This time, we can look for the Moon sect, heaven-breaking sect, and even the nine clouds sect. We can ask them to send some powerhouses. We can use the land of these planets as a reward.”

Prime Minister GUI said, “Or, Dragon King, we have another way. The last time we hunted the abyssal seeds in the eastern abyss of the Demon Island, they had a large number of corpses and crystals of the abyssal seeds. We can exchange the land of the planets for them.”

“HMM? That’s not a bad idea.”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows. “Go and inform the heaven-breaking sect and the nine clouds sect immediately. Ask them if they have any intention of selling the abyssal seeds. If they are not willing, we can use another method.”

“It’s Dragon King. I will contact their sect leader immediately. We will get the results soon.”

Prime Minister Gui nodded and immediately took out his AI to communicate.

Wang Xian and the rest sat there and waited quietly.

“Dragon King, Jiuxiao is willing to take out two level 9 undying god King Abyss seed crystals to trade with us. Duan Tian’s is level 8. It’s not very useful to us, but it’s not bad.”

Ten minutes later, Prime Minister Gui said.

“Let’s do the trade. Also, call the sect leader from last month over. Two level 9 undying god King Abyss seed corpses, plus the four undying God kings from last month’s sect, will do.”

Wang Xian pondered for a moment and said.

“Alright!”

Prime Minister Gui nodded and immediately went out to settle the matter.

“Greetings, Dragon King!”

Not long after, the sect leader and the two forefathers rushed over. They looked at Wang Xian and called out respectfully.

“Yes, everyone. Our Dragon Palace is preparing to go to the northern front to hunt the abyssal seeds there. We would like to make a trade with them last month.”

Wang Xian spoke directly to them.

“Yes? Go to the northern front to hunt the abyssal seeds?”

The sect master and the rest were slightly shocked.

They knew a little about the number of powerful abyssal seeds in the northern front. It was no less than the number of abyssal seeds in the east.

The eastern side of the Abyss was destroyed by the combined power of the entire Demon Island.

...

What was the Dragon Palace doing now?

“With the strength of our Dragon Palace, we are completely capable of destroying the abyssal seeds on the northern front. However, compared to the level 9 immortal king, there are not many of them. Hence, we would like to invite the four of you from last month to help.”

“Of course, if you guys help, we will not let your efforts go to waste. It’s the land of 1,000 life planets.”

Wang Xian continued to speak to them.

“This... The Dragon King has done us a favor. As long as you say the word, we will definitely not decline. It’s just that we want to know how confident you are, Dragon King?”

“Also, old Feng’s injuries have yet to recover. Even with a large amount of resources and treasures, he still needs more than a hundred years to recover.”

The sect master of last month said directly.

“Don’t worry. Unless there are more powerful abyssal races from the depths of the Abyss on the northern front, you guys can come over and help. We are 100% sure that your old Feng’s injuries will recover in an instant. I have healing treasures here.”

As Wang Xian spoke, he looked at the newly born liquid in the Moon Bay of the ancient lake. With a wave of his arm, the life force liquid flew directly towards them.

“In addition, you don’t have to reject the land of 1,000 life planets.”

He said faintly.

...

“Dragon King, the reward you have given us is sufficient. As long as you instruct us, we can take action immediately.”

The sect master and the rest received the vitality liquid and sensed its energy. A trace of shock flashed across their eyes as they replied immediately.

“Alright, we will set off in 15 days.”

Wang Xian immediately said.

“Alright!”

The three people from the sect master nodded.

“After removing the three immortal King Level 9 masters who are controlling the heaven’s end ruler, adding the four of them and the two that have been added, 16 against 24 is enough.”

Wang Xian mumbled as a smile appeared on his face.
