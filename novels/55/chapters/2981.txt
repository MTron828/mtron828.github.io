Chapter 2982: 1982 easily killed them

“Sir, according to the speculations of the people in the starry sky, there are between 50 to 100 divine emperors in the Dragon Palace. Nine of them are extremely powerful!”

In the starry sky of the Heaven Punishment Ancient Sky Territory, not far to the right of the four-armed race, the desolate divine emperor introduced to Yang Xiaohun.

“The power of the dragon palace is not worth mentioning. It’s mainly because of those guys!”

Yang Xiaohun did not pay much attention to the words of the desolate divine emperor. His eyes also swept across the four-armed race not far away.

When the desolate divine emperor and the others saw the exchange of glances, their eyes sparkled.

“As long as we can kill the Dragon Palace, it will be fine!”

The Emperor Lord roared in a low voice, his eyes shining with hatred.

“This time, even if the Dragon Palace won’t die, it will be tamed. In the future, it might be reduced to a mount!”

A smile appeared on the desolate god Emperor’s face.

The Dragon Palace had forced them to become homeless dogs. Now that the Dragon Palace’s disaster had arrived, they felt a sense of revenge.

“There’s a planet ahead that can teleport us. Sir, let’s Go!”

At this moment, a god emperor beside them pointed forward and said.

Everyone’s eyes flashed as they sped up and flew towards the planet ahead.

Not far away, the four-armed race had the creator’s reminder and immediately flew towards the planet.

“Who is it!”

“What a powerful presence!”

“Who is it?”

When they, the four-armed race, the three-eyed race, and the disciples of the eight Barrens landed on the planet, it immediately caused chaos on the planet.

“Scram! We, the eight barrens, will lead the powerful three-eyed race experts from the center of the universe to destroy the Dragon Palace. Everyone, get out of the way!”

A God emperor from the eight barrens saw the vigilant planet guards below, and the pressure belonging to the god Emperor directly covered the planet.

“What?”

“Hiss, get out of the way! Get out of the way!”

Hearing the god Emperor’s words and feeling the terrifying pressure, all the guards on this planet revealed expressions of fear and hurriedly roared.

The teleportation array immediately became empty.

“Hehe, I am the Creator. I will lead the four-armed race in the universe to hunt down the Divine Dragon and kill the Dragon King. Move aside!”

At the side, the creator also spoke coldly.

“Creator?”

When everyone on the planet heard these three words, their hearts trembled.

Creator, that was the ruler of the machine imperial region. He wasn’t Dead Yet?

Looking at the four-armed human and the three-eyed human, everyone on the planet was filled with respect.

“Go!”

“Go!”

The desolate god Emperor and the others glanced at the creator and flew towards the teleportation array.

The four-armed race also flew.

They moved together, but they restrained each other.

Only when they reached the Dragon Palace would the battle begin.

“The news from bhang Liu he is true. Hiss, the experts from the center of the universe, they are going to destroy the Dragon Palace!”

“It’s bhang and the creator who contacted the experts from the center of the universe. They are asking the experts to destroy the Dragon Palace. The Dragon Palace is doomed!”

“Their power is too terrifying. With such strength, even the Dragon Palace can’t resist them!”

“Quick, pass this news to our God Emperor!”

On the planets, when everyone saw them leave, their faces were filled with shock.

One after another, they spread the news.

The four-armed race and the three-eyed race were teleporting from one planet to another in the heavenly punishing ancient sky region. The news that the experts from the center of the universe were going to destroy the Dragon Palace was also spreading crazily in the heavenly punishing ancient sky region.

While they were on their way, the heavenly array eight-limbed demon fiend and the others were also rushing toward them.

The distance between the two parties was getting closer and closer.

“Weng!”

At the teleportation array of a flourishing planet, figures with vast auras appeared one after another.

Four-armed humans!

Three-eyed humans!

Through the teleportation array, they had arrived at the center of the Heavenly Punishment Ancient Sky Region.

“We pay our respects to the experts at the center of the Universe!”

Just as they appeared, a divine emperor not far away led many of his subordinates and said respectfully.

When the news was sent to him, he immediately led his subordinates to welcome them.

He did not seek any benefits. He only wanted to get familiar with them so that they would not be destroyed.

After all, they were experts from the center of the Universe!

“The ruler of this region is really weak. He is only at the first level divine emperor.” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Among the four-armed race, an expert at the peak of the Divine King Realm said disdainfully when he saw the divine emperor.

A peak godly monarch realm expert should not have the right to mock an expert at the godly monarch realm. However, coming from the center of the universe and seeing the many planets, he had a feeling of being high and mighty.

“Which is the teleportation array that leads to the Imperial Star Field?”

Yang Xiao Hun glanced at the four-armed race members and asked with a dignified expression.

“Sir, it’s the teleportation array in front of us!”

The Celestial Emperor didn’t dare to have any objection when he heard the four-armed race’s Disciple’s mockery. He quickly said to Yang Xiaohun.

Yang Xiaohun looked forward and walked toward the teleportation array.

“What a terrifying power!”

“The disaster of the Dragon Palace is coming!”

“Why did the creator and eight barrens find an expert from the center of the Universe?”

Some people in the surrounding area looked at them with reverence as they walked toward the teleportation array and transmitted their voices.

“Buzz Buzz!”

At this moment, a group of figures slowly appeared from the teleportation array in front of them.

Their bodies were pitch-black and each of them was around three meters in size. They looked slightly ferocious.

In the middle, there were three people who appeared slightly normal. One was an old man and two were middle-aged men.

They appeared in front of the teleportation array and narrowed their eyes as they stared ahead. Their eyes flickered with a luster.

“Get lost!”

At this moment, a cold voice came from the mouth of a four-armed race expert in front of them. He shouted at the group of people who came out of the teleportation array.

However, the group of people didn’t move at all when they heard the shout. They just looked at them quietly.

“Huh?”

The people on this planet were surprised.

The creator stared at the old man and the group of strange creatures in the middle. His eyes flashed with a luster as he felt that they were somewhat familiar. He immediately analyzed and calculated.

However, when the eight desolation god-emperors saw the old man in the middle, their eyes focused slightly and revealed killing intent.

The group of them were naturally the heaven array and the poisonous horned dragon species.

“Keke, four-armed race and three-eyed race, right? Let me introduce myself. I Am the leader of the Dragon Palace’s poisonous horned dragon species, Ba Qi. This is my brother, Mo Sha. And this is the leader of our Dragon Palace’s Dragon Wizard, Heaven Array!”

“Come to welcome us from afar. Prepare to entertain the experts from the center of the Universe!”

At this moment, Ba Qi took a step forward and cupped his hands. His sinister gaze swept over all of them as he said with a smile.

“Oh? Members of the Dragon Palace?”

Ba Qi introduced himself, causing the four-armed race, Yang Xiaohun, and the others to be slightly stunned.

Come to welcome them from afar and treat them well?

What is this Dragon Palace?
