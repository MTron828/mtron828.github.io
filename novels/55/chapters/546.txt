Chapter 547: Genius? Demon? (1)

“Mum, why did you bring him home? It’s such an inconvenience to have a guy living in our house!”

“We don’t even know who he is. Don’t you think it’s inappropriate to have him in our house? He almost startled me to death today!”

“Let’s find out where he comes from and send him back immediately!”

While Wang Xian was in a trance, he heard a female voice. He frowned as he made a slight movement. His entire body was in pain as though it was going to break at once.

Self-healing with Dragon Energy!

Wang Xian made a thought.

[Self-healing will consume 1.97 million points of Dragon Energy. Continue?]

“Damn, why is it so expensive again?”

Wang Xian twisted his expression a little. With a thought, he checked his own injuries and decided to use 500,000 points of Dragon Energy for a simple treatment.

“Ling’er, since he fell in Mt. Fengyu, we cannot leave him there. I’ll get an ancestral sect to check his identity and send him back!”

“In order to treat him, we have already consumed a lot of resources from Mt. Fengyu!”

“Well, well. Stop speaking, lass. If your strength can achieve advancement, our Mt. Fengyu will definitely receive more resources!”

“Mum, I’ll work hard...”

The voices outside continued to confuse Wang Xian.

Where is this place? Void space shattered? Did I come to the world within the array, or...?

All sorts of thoughts flashed in Wang Xia’s mind. He remembered the last battle scene clearly, when he was sucked into the array when it gave way.

Argh!

“Mum, he’s up. He’s awake!”

Just then, a voice came screaming again, which Wang Xian found somewhat familiar.

Subsequently, Wang Xian saw a lady and a girl walking toward him.

The lady was charming, and he could only tell that she was mature and well-developed through her figure. There were no signs of aging on her face.

The girl was around 22 to 23 years old, and she resembled the lady a lot. Yet, she was glaring at Wang Xian now with a face full of displeasure.

Both of them wore some ancient clothing, which was unlike the modern style.

“Are you awake?”

The lady looked to Wang Xian as she flicked her finger, sending a stream of water current into Wang Xian’s body.

“Are your injuries serious? Which sect are you from? I’ll get someone to send you back,” said the lady, looking at Wang Xian.

Wang Xian froze for a moment as he did not answer the question of the lady, “Where is this place?”

He spun his head around, studying the surroundings as he asked with confusion.

“This is the Da Hong Immortal Sect. Which sect are you from? Immortal Slaying or Yong Chang? Or some other smaller sect?” asked the lady to Wang Xian plainly as she walked to the bed.

“Da Hong Immortal Sect? Immortal Slaying? Yong Chang?” Wang Xian continued with his quizzical look.

He felt like he had really entered into a strange world within that array.

“Don’t tell me you have amnesia? And you forgot which sect you are from?”

Seeing his reaction, the girl at the side stalked over and scrutinized him.

Looks like I have really entered into the world within the array!

Wang Xian stared blankly at the ancient character embroidered on the girl’s clothes as he was in a trance.

“Hey, I’m asking you a question? Did you lose your memory? Or are you a mute?”

The girl was displeased and yelled at Wang Xian since she could not get any answer from him.

Wang Xian looked up to that girl. “I think I lost my memory!”

The girl almost choked upon hearing his answer. This was the first time she saw someone admit that they had lost their memory in such a relaxed manner.

Is this how someone with amnesia should act?

“Mum, look at him. He doesn’t seem to be a good guy, and he does not have amnesia. He clearly wants to...”

The girl stared at Wang Xian furiously as she spoke to the lady beside her.

The lady furrowed her brows slightly as she looked at Wang Xian. “Don’t you know Da Hong Immortal Sect, Immortal Slaying Sect, or Yong Chang Immortal Sect?”

“I have no idea.” Wang Xian shook his head and continued voicing his doubt. “What is this place?”

“We’re at Yong Chang. What do you remember?”

The lady fixed her flickering eyes on Wang Xian.

“Yong Chang? My name is Wang Xian, and others call me the Dragon King!”

Yong Chang? Wang Xian continued to look perplexed. Where is Yong Chang exactly? A world within the array?

“Dragon King? Can you tumble the river or overturn the sea?”

The girl was slightly stunned by Wang Xian’s words, but subsequently, she rebutted him with contempt.

“That’s enough, Ling’er. Wang Xian, right? Take a rest now and see if you can recall anything. You may stay here for the time being!” said the lady to Wang Xian as she tugged the arm of the girl and dragged her out. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Mum, he’s obviously lying. Amnesia? He doesn’t look like he has lost his memory to me!”

“He’s not lying. He really has no idea of where this place is.”

“Don’t tell me he fell from the sky?”

“He can’t be from the outside world. No outsider can come in. He probably lost his memory!”

“Hmph, I think he’s a bad guy, probably got chased by some people, and ran into our place for hiding!”

Wang Xian chuckled bitterly as he overheard the scarcely audible conversation from the outside.

“It seems like this is the world within the array, Yong Chang? They knew about the outside world, so we’re still on Earth. That’s close.

“If I’m not wrong, that lady should be a Budding Realm Expert, while the girl is an Inborn Expert.

“Da Hong Immortal Sect!”

Wang Xian murmured with radiance flickering in his eyes.

.....

Bam!

“Take your medicine!”

Two days later, a teacup was slammed onto the table in front of Wang Xian while the girl instructed him with impatience.

“Thank you!”

Wang Xian smiled at the girl as he put down his book and spoke impassively.

“Hmph, since you’re not disabled, do you expect me to send you medicine all the time? Can’t you take it yourself?”

The girl snorted at Wang Xian with displeasure on her face. Subsequently, she turned around impatiently and left.

Looking at the teacup on the table, Wang Xian picked it up with a beaming face and drank it in one shot. Then he picked up his book once again.

In the book was written four ancient words: Great Way Yong Chang!

Wang Xian took two days before he finally got some understanding of this place.

Yong Chang World was suppressed by Yong Chang Cauldron, and it was the legendary Immortal Realm.

The world possessed Immortal Sects over here with legendary Immortals, and dharma.

Wang Xian stood up and gazed far ahead.

The place he was staying at was half-way up the mountain, surrounded by the sound of waterfalls.

One could see experts flying in the air on their swords some distance away.

That’s right, they were flying on their swords.

Over here, the Inborn Experts could fly on their swords; Dan Realm Experts could ride the clouds; Budding Realm Experts could dive into outer space.

“There’s a complete cultivation system over here, and the Art of Cultivation is way beyond what the Underworld has. On top of that, there are experts in the Immortal Realm that have surpassed the Budding Realm over here.”

With glistening eyes, Wang Xian studied his surroundings.

All along, Wang Xian had wanted to learn the attacking means, and master the read cultivation art. Now, the chance was here.

“Coming here was a good opportunity for me!”

Wang Xian curved his lips slightly.
