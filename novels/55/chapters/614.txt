Chapter 615: Wait While I Kill Them (2)

“Hur?”

Those elders who wanted to speak had a drastic change in their expressions upon hearing what Wang Xian said.

“It’s you! It’s indeed you! Elder Liang, Elder Tong, and Attendant Ao were killed by you!” an elder bellowed with a darkened expression as he stared at Wang Xian with murderous eyes.

“Hehe, since they dared to try to assassinate me, they should have been prepared to meet their doom!” Wang Xian said with his icy eyes.

“Hur?”

All the surrounding elders were startled as they focused their attention on the several elders who had spoken just now.

“Those fifteen Budding Realm experts of Yong Chang City half a month ago were killed by Dragon King?”

An elder with fiery-red hair in the center questioned Wang Xian with flickering radiance in his eyes.

“Half a month ago, fifteen people sieged the surrounding region near my shop with an array in an attempt to kill me. Of course, I wouldn’t let them live. I guess I have infringed on some people’s interests.”

Wang Xian swept his gaze across several elders plainly with a faint smile on his face.

“We discovered something was wrong with you during our night investigation and got killed by you. Today, we’ll avenge them!”

That elder of Da Hong Immortal Sect remained unwavering as he spoke, fixing death stares on Wang Xian.

In the past, they did not dare to spill the beans openly. Knowing that the Dragon King was an outsider, it put them completely at ease now.

No matter how that outsider tried to explain himself, it would never win against their claims.

“After all, he came from the outside world. Let’s just keep him under control now!” an elder said coldly.

“Yes, that goes without saying. We should capture him first!” an elder echoed.

The rest of the elders nodded in agreement. No matter what, they had to control him first since he was from the real world.

“Let’s cripple him and his cultivation to prevent troubles!”

A glimmer of excitement flashed in Ao Shuwen’s eyes with a ferocious look surfacing on his face.

With a swift move, he darted to Wang Xian for a strike.

“Cripple him!”

Just as Ao Shuwen struck, another four people lurched at Wang Xian immediately.

Upon witnessing the scene, Xiaoxiao was slightly stunned. Her expression sank while she kept her silence.

“Sigh, I came to this place quietly, and I wanted to leave quietly too. You guys wanted to court your doom!”

Seeing the quintet was prepared to cripple him, coldness twinkled in Wang Xian’s eyes.

“Kill them!” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

When Wang Xian’s emotionless voice resounded, he had already charged toward the quintet who was approaching five meters away.

Wow!

A crisp sound was heard as a golden radiance flashed, revealing five malevolent people.

“Dragon King, hehe, go to hell!”

The excitement and malevolent expression filled the face of Ao Shuwen as he pointed the longsword at Wang Xian.

The other four wore cold faces. Not only had the Dragon King caused a massive loss to them, but he had also killed one top-notch expert from their clan.

This feud was implacable!

Now that they had this opportunity, they would not let him off!

“How is this possible!?”

At this point in time, a supreme talent behind the quintet suddenly showed fright in his eyes.

“What?”

When the quintet exploded their daunting aura, they were stunned when they heard a voice behind them. Subsequently, they felt their energy dissipating at a terrifying speed.

“Traceless Sword!”

Roving Sword stood before Wang Xian and withdrew his sword after spitting out the words.

“Ah, no!”

The five of them felt their energy dissipating within their bodies as they looked down in trepidation.

They felt panic as they let out despair shrieks.

Half of their bodies were slowly collapsing onto the ground.

One sword move had divided them into two.

Sensing their vitality diminishing at a rapid speed, the quintet lost all hope.

“It’s him. He’s the subordinate of Dragon King. I didn’t expect it to be him. He’s still alive!”

Xiaoxiao watched this scene and quickly spun around with a pale-looking face. She stared at Roving Sword and spoke at the top of her lungs.

“What? Roving Sword is the subordinate of Dragon King?”

“That’s right, it’s him. He’s Dragon King’s man, and he came from the real world too!” Xiaoxiao said with a loud voice.

“Go to hell, Roving Sword. You actually came from the real world. To think that Immortal Slaying Sect spent great efforts to cultivate you. You are so cruel. Die!”

“How dare you strike? Take him down. If he dares to resist, kill him!”

Seeing that Roving Sword actually killed four elders and one supreme talent in one go, the three Immortal Sects became nervous as they exclaimed loudly.

Sixty Budding Realm experts immediately erupted their domineering auras from their bodies, locking onto Wang Xian and Roving Sword completely.

“Surrender immediately!”

The Great Elder of Da Hong Immortal Sect stared at Wang Xian with a complicated look as he yelled in a low voice.

“Don’t mess with me. Otherwise, I wouldn’t mind a killing spree!”

Wang Xian swept his cold gaze across sixty-odd Budding Realm experts as he replied coldly.

“Kill them! How dare he kill the people from Yong Chang world!”

An elder let out a cold bellow directly.

“Strike! Kill!”

Some of the elders acted with no hesitation as they gathered their daunting energy and slashed at both Wang Xian and Roving Sword.

“Retreat!”

Some of the supreme talents on the stage were aghast as they ducked to one side with trepidation.

When all the elders of three Immortal Sects struck together, it brought about a devastating scene.

“Gosh, that Dragon King actually came from the real world, and so did Roving Sword!”

“Roving Sword is so strong that he can kill four elders in one move. Even Ao Shuwen too. He was directly slain. That’s too fast!”

“Dragon King was the one who killed those fifteen Budding Realm experts on Yong Chang Tower half a month ago. This is simply insane!”

“They are from the real world, but isn’t the real world experiencing the Age of Dharma Decline? How come Dragon King and Roving Sword are so strong? Why?”

Over hundreds of thousands of disciples were shouting with disbelief below.

They witnessed daunting oppression erupted from sixty-odd elders, shrouding the entire area over a span of more than ten kilometers.

“Kill the Dragon King!”

“Let’s go and kill him. Damn!”

At this time, all the experts were glowering at Wang Xian with murderous intent from below.

They were the experts from a dozen families.

In a brief moment, more than a dozen Budding Realm experts rose to the sky and lurched at Wang Xian with an immense amount of killing intent.

Boom!

Dozens of elders struck at the same time in the sky. Daunting inferno, water swords, and metallic swords were looming over Wang Xian.

Instantly, all the domineering energy landed on the stage at the peak.

The entire stage on the peak exploded under the domineering attack. The stage that was a thousand meters tall was utterly destroyed.

“He’s dead. I bet he’s dead since more than dozens experts struck at the same time. Their power would be sufficient to bring down the sky!”

Back at the bottom, those disciples commented with shocked looks. Their eyes widened when they witnessed such terrifying attacks.

“It was terrifying for the Dragon King, and Roving Sword from the real world, to become the elders of Da Hong Immortal Sect and the most invincible young generation of Yong Chang. A pity that they were too brazen to kill our people!”

“Even though we killed him, the strength of the Dragon King and Roving Sword were good enough to stun us. Their talents were beyond imagination!”

“Good that they’re dead. They made our talents pale in comparison within a short period! What a great talent!”
