Chapter 503: How Dare Insignificant Ants Intervene?

“Apologize? You really think too highly of yourself!”

Hai Jiao glowered at Wang Xian coldly. “You injured my son and killed my men. I was busy these past few days, and didn’t have the time to kill you!”

“Is that so?” Wang Xian curled his lips. “I sent someone to look for your island, but I didn’t find it. If I knew where your island was, both of you wouldn’t be here today!”

Boom!

Boom!

Tit for tat. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Wang Xian and Hai Jiao stared daggers at each other.

A surge of aura exuded from them. As the two clouds of aura collided, the surrounding space seemed to be distorted.

However, their aura was not revealed in any way. When experts advanced to a certain level, they could perfectly control the aura exuded.

When the two auras knocked against each other, none of the people around them noticed that the contest had begun.

Hai Jiao was staring at Wang Xian with astonishment as he narrowed his eyes.

The Young Lord of Sea Serpent Island clenched his fist and stared at Wang Xian furiously.

But he dared not act insolently as Wang Xian was a compelling expert.

He knew the power of a Dan Realm Expert, but he had no fear, as his father would be slaughtering him.

Gulp!

“A confrontation. Will they break out into a fight?”

“The second strongest expert in the Underworld is facing the youngest unparalleled expert from the new Dragon Sect. If they were to battle, it would be another battle of the ages!”

“Be it Dragon King or Hai Jiao, the two of them are almost invincible. They are the brazen existences. Unless one of them admits defeat or dies, they will need to tough it out!”

Seeing Wang Xian and Hai Jiao gazing at each other coldly, the surrounding atmosphere was frozen as the people around them were shocked to see this.

Some of the experts from Sacred Sects also looked over with flickering eyes.

“Lord Hai Jiao, we should go over!” some of the young disciples of Donghua Sacred Sect hesitantly and cautiously said to Hai Jiao upon noticing the situation.

“Dragon King, please excuse us and let us through!” a young disciple of Donghua Sacred Sect lowered his chin and said to Wang Xian plainly.

This disciple was one of those young men who had received Wang Xian and his gang yesterday.

Wang Xian looked at that young man with an eyebrow raised. “You guys walked to my side and expect me to give way?”

“Dragon King, Lord Hai Jiao is the VIP that Donghua Sacred Sect invited. You’re in our territory, so please give way!”

The young man craned his neck up and told Wang Xian this before he turned to Hai Jiao and revealed a flattering smile.

“Ants.”

Wang Xian swung his arm and released traces of killing intent in his eyes.

Upon seeing Wang Xian making his move, Hai Jiao remained unwavering except for his slightly lifted eyebrow.

“How dare you, an insignificant ant, intervene in the experts’ affairs.”

Under the shocked and astonished eyes of that young man, Wang Xian grabbed his neck and stared coldly at him.

“Cough... You...”

The young man flushed with redness when his neck was seized. He glared at Wang Xian with a dreadful expression. “You... this is Donghua...”

Bam!

Wang Xian jerked his arm, and an explosion was heard around the limbs and Elixir Field of that young man.

Argh!

The young man let out a cry of horror, which resounded in Donghua Sacred Sect.

“I wonder how the mighty Donghua Sacred Sect disciplines their disciples. Such trash actually tried to taunt experts!”

Wang Xian waved his hand and hurled the young man out.

“Argh, no... My limbs, my Elixir Field. You actually crippled me. You crippled me!”

The young man who was thrown to the floor spat out a mouthful of blood. He felt his body shake with terror. His body was huddled up and his eyes were full of despair.

His Elixir Field and four limbs had been completely destroyed.

Sss...

“Dragon King actually crippled a young disciple of Donghua Sacred Sect!”

“He’s completely crippled. Besides, it’s hard to heal injuries caused by such an expert. He’s finished totally!”

“He’s asking for his own death. How can a young disciple of Donghua Sacred Sect interfere in the conflict between the Dragon King and Hai Jiao? Both of them are Dan Realm Experts. A fellow who is yet to be an Inborn actually intervened in experts’ matters!”

“He’s such an idiot. An ant is dreaming of interfering in conflicts between two unparalleled experts. He should count himself lucky for not getting himself killed!”

“Maybe that disciple of Donghua Sacred Sect did not expect that the Dragon King would cripple him straight away!”

The surrounding crowd watched coldly as the disciple of Donghua Sacred Sect rolled and screamed in pain on the floor.

Thinking that you are the disciple of Donghua Sacred Sect, and you can poke your nose in experts’ matters?

It would be okay if the other party was just an Inborn Expert.

But you’re digging your own grave by poking your nose in the conflict between the second strongest expert in the Underworld and the Dragon King of Dragon Sect.

In addition, you were still ignorant, trying to please Hai Jiao, who has made an enemy of the Dragon King.

How can a disciple who is not even an Inborn provoke such an unparalleled expert?

“Senior!”

Several disciples of Donghua Sacred Sect stiffened up as they ran to that disciple with panic.

“An ant has no right to talk.” Hai Jiao swept his gaze at the young man before he glowered at Wang Xian. “But I’ll slay you for hurting my son and killing my men!”

“Hehe, rest assured that you guys will not live long!”

Wang Xian looked at Hai Jiao and the Young Lord of Sea Serpent Island with a broad smile and unconcealed killing intent in his eyes.

“Great, I look forward to it. Haha!”

Hai Jiao chortled and walked inside with an icy-cold face.

The Young Lord of Sea Serpent Island threw a death stare at Wang Xian before he followed behind his father.

Wang Xian chuckled. He took a glance at the young man who was rolling in pain on the floor before he walked to one side.

Several disciples from Donghua Sacred Sect fixed their gazes at Wang Xian and gritted their teeth in fear.

“What’s going on?”

At this time, two middle-aged men flitted over with the daunting aura of Inborn Experts. One looked at the ancestral disciple on the floor and asked this with a grave expression.

“It was the Dragon King from Dragon Sect who did it. He crippled Senior Xue’s four limbs and Elixir Field!” a disciple replied with a dreadful look.

“Dragon King?”

The two middle-aged men frowned as they placed their arms on the young man with a darkened expression.

“It’s completely gone. His life is finished. Why did that Dragon King cripple him?” asked the middle-aged man with a gloomy expression.

“Because... Because Senior Xue tried to intervene in the conflict between Hai Jiao and the Dragon King. As a result, the Dragon King crippled him straight away!”

A young man wiped the cold sweat from his forehead.

“Intervene in their matters?”

The two middle-aged men had a change in their expressions as they fixed their eyes on the fallen young man. “You aren’t even an Inborn. Yet, you tried to interfere with two unparalleled experts? Are you seeking death?”
