Chapter 523: It’s Time to Strike

Clang clang clang!

Bam, Bam, Bam!

The hammering sound kept coming as Wang Xian had not stopped hammering the sheet of Devil Metal Steel according to the forging method in the Art of Equipment Refining.

The most amazing effect of using the Origin Source Flame to refine equipment was the removal of impurities.

Removal of impurities was a crucial step, as the impurities could affect the properties of conduction and therefore affect the power of the weapons.

Secondly, the Origin Source Flame had another strong effect: to soften any types of metals speedily.

It could achieve the same temperature between the interior and exterior of the metal.

For refining equipment, these effects were like great plugins.

After Wang Xian placed the Devil Metal Steel in the mold, he quickly hammered it. Soon, the shape of a mask was formed.

After the semi-finished mask was done, he could proceed with conducting the attributes into the mask.

When Wang Xian examined the conductivity of the semi-finished mask, he instantly found out that the conductivity was smooth without any blockage.

“It must be the Origin Source Flame. The so-called conductivity has a simple way of testing. When the attribution passes through, it will straightaway appear at the end of the device. Just like electric conduction. Some have poor or good conductivity.”

This had to do with the impurities in the materials. The rest did not have much of an impact.

“It’s easy to solve the issue of conductivity when using a single material to craft a weapon. But when it comes to using two or more materials, the conductivity is a key point!”

Wang Xian was elated. Using the Origin Source Flame to refine equipment was such an easy task.

Some of the blacksmiths would spend a long time just to make an Inborn Spiritual Weapon.

Take Zhan Lu, for example. It was said that he used three months just to make the Ancient Sword of Zhan Lu.

Wang Xian took the Wan Forging Hammer, making some small adjustments to the mask.

“Phew, it’s done!”

[Devil Shadow Mask: Level 10]

“A black-colored mask isn’t that nice at all. I should draw an abyss on it. The Abyss Mask looks cool and impressive!”

Wang Xian was wearing smiles as he looked at the mask. He put it on, and a shadow emerged beside him.

The shadow was vague because he was not using any devil attributions.

Once the devil attribution was activated, the shadow would turn realistic, and it could distract the opponent during combat.

“I’ll make fifty of them!”

Wang Xian looked at the material, raised his Wan Forging Hammer, and began to speed up his crafting process.

Level 13 supreme-class weapons with Origin Source Flame, a crazy flame.

Making Inborn Spiritual Weapons was a breeze to him.

After the hammering sound continued for more than two hours, Wang Xian had completed fifty Devil Shadow Masks.

But he did not stop and went on to make other stuff.

It was another piece of auxiliary equipment, a pair of Devil Wings.

The speed of dragonians was a flaw compared to their power and defense.

If they had a pair of wings, it could significantly enhance their speed.

On the other hand, wings and masks had a complimentary effect.

Since Wang Xian had the Origin Source Flame, he thought of an idea: to make the Devil Shadow Mask and Devil Wings into a suit.

This way, they could complement each other, making it a simple Spiritual Weapon Suit.

The suit had one feature, and that was a complement.

There were two types of complements. One was the Spiritual Complement, and one was the Power Complement.

The Spiritual Complement was somewhat more advanced, while the Power Complement was simpler.

But to Wang Xian, this was a piece of cake.

However, making a pair of wings was undoubtedly much more difficult.

The three materials required were Tenacious Devil Stone, Wind Feather Stone, and Golden Metal Rock.

With this three metal combination, it added a lot of difficulty to the crafting of the weapon.

The Tenacious Devil Stone was the primary material, while the other two materials were supplementary. Wang Xian had to bring out the characteristics of these materials, at the same time, not to affect the attribution conductivity.

Bam, Bam, Bam!

For the whole day, Wang Xian had not stopped his hammering and research.

Making auxiliary weapons like the wings proved to be too difficult, as Wang Xian spent eight hours to make one.

The pair of Devil Wings spread out 1.5 meters on each side, three meters with both sides extended out.

The entire wings were pure black with five frames supporting them in the middle. After adding the Wind Feather Stone, the entire wings were as light as a feather.

When they conducted with their devilish aura, they could soar effortlessly into the sky.

That would increase their speed by another fifty percent.

But before using the Devil Wings, one had to embed a Spiritual Stone at the position of the Wind Feather Stone to activate its effect.

Fortunately, the consumption was not massive, and it could be brushed off.

Flap!

Wang Xian spread out the wings with a crisp-clear sound. After he tested them, the wings shrunk, and would not be affecting anything. Even spreading the wings during a battle would not have the slightest hindrance to movement.

Wang Xian had a satisfied look on his face. After putting on the mask, it would be simply impressive if he had another black trench coat. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Should I make one too?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrow as he was intrigued. But after looking at the material, it was a pity that the materials he had were insufficient. He shook his head without any choice.

After putting on the mask, two pieces of metal could buckle on the wings, linking the two items, creating the simple effect of a suit.

Wang Xian moved around, and an illusory shadow emerged beside him.

With his lips curled, he continued making his Devil Wings.

“Dragon King!”

When the moon was hanging in the night sky, Mo Yuan called out from outside.

“Come in!”

Wang Xian wiped the sweat on his forehead. Even he was a little tired after crafting weapons for the entire day.

“Dragon King, Omniscient Group is now under our control!” said Mo Yuan to Wang Xian excitedly.

“Under our control? That fast?”

A trace of thrill flashed across Wang Xian’s eyes.

“Yes, there were not many people at the higher management level. On top of that, they were ordinary people. Hence, it was easy for us to take control, and now we have gained access to the information in Omniscient Group!”

Mo Yuan nodded his head with force.

“Great!”

Wang Xian squinted his eyes. “From now on, collect all the information on Donghua Sacred Sect. Since we won’t rest unless one of us is dead, we should do something about it!”

As Wang Xian spoke, he drew his lips.

“Yes, Dragon King. We’ll get Omniscient Group to send us all the information about Donghua Sacred Sect!”

“Okay!”

Wang Xian nodded. Seeing the well-made Inborn Spiritual Weapons, he smiled and took out his phone to rest on the chair.

When he read the messages on the Underworld forum, he put up a faint smile.

Everyone was discussing the Dragon King and Dragon Sect.

The news of the Remains being annihilated had shaken the entire Underworld. After Donghua Sacred Sect released another statement, all the Martial Artists of the Underworld were hoping the Dragon King and Dragon Sect could wipe out the rest of the devil sects.

All of them were discussing the Dragon King and Dragon Sect’s strength.

Dragon Sect was known to be the next strongest Sacred Sect after Donghua Sacred Sect.

At the same time, all of Diabolism had noticed the fact that Wang Xian had annihilated the Remains. Some of them had posted threads on the Underworld forum, saying they would annihilate the Dragon King to avenge the Remains!
