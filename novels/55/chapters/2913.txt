Chapter 2914: performance time

“Gulp!”

Stupefied!

The soldiers of the glazed third army were all stupefied!

On the battle stage, everyone stared blankly at the lifeless rank one celestial emperor Yao Xie who was falling downwards.

Instant Kill!

A rank one celestial emperor Yao Xie was instantly killed.

Looking at this scene, everyone was in a daze as they stared blankly at the figure in front of them.

That person, who they thought was a little annoying and a little cowardly, had actually killed a demonic god Emperor in an instant.

The blood-red figure enveloped his body and held a resplendent gourd in his hand. He arrogantly raised his head and floated in the air.

Flying Swords flew out from the gourd just now and directly killed a rank one demonic god Emperor.

“How… How is this possible? What kind of treasure is that in his hand? He actually killed a god Emperor Yao Xie in an instant!”

“This is too terrifying. Damn, how can this guy have so many supreme treasures on him? He killed a rank one god Emperor in an instant. What kind of treasure is this?”

“It’s hard for even an ordinary god Emperor to have such a treasure. How can that guy have so many supreme treasures? How much luck does this guy have to obtain such a treasure?”

“It can’t be that the vice-commander gave it to him, right? Even the vice-commander doesn’t have such a Supreme Treasure!”

Very soon, the battle platform erupted into a discussion of shock.

Their eyes were burning with fervor as they stared at the invincible battle technique in disbelief.

Each and every one of the extremely powerful treasures made them somewhat unable to believe it.

Even their glazed divine emperor could not take out so many supreme treasures.

However, that fellow was getting stronger and stronger one after another.

It was simply heaven-defying.

“Junior brother invincible has actually gotten so many treasures from the Dragon Palace!”

Second senior sister looked at the invincible battle technique and muttered. Her eyes were also filled with shock.

The divine weapon in her junior brother’s hand could instantly kill their master.

“Hahaha, good, good, good!”

In the void ahead, God Emperor Shangshui sensed the situation here and was stunned. Then, he couldn’t help but laugh out loud.

He didn’t expect that his bad disciple could get so many terrifying treasures from the Dragon Palace.

Now, five first level god Emperor Yao Xie had been killed instantly by invincible battle techniques. There were only four left.

If there were four, it would be difficult to threaten the lives of him and the Grand Supreme Fourth Elder.

“Hehehe, I’ve already said that I’m staying here to protect you, master, yet you still don’t believe me!”

“HMPH, I’ll let you see how powerful my invincible battle technique is!”

When invincible battle technique heard the words of the divine emperor of Shangshui, he raised his head and laughed loudly.

As he spoke, another flute appeared in his hand.

An earthen yellow jade flute.

At the opening of the jade flute, there was an array. This was set up by the Heaven Array.

The jade flute was of the Earth attribute. Logically speaking, it should not be used when one was invincible in battle.

However, the Heaven Array had set up an array on it. As long as the array was activated, it could be used immediately.

Moreover, with the increase in the strength of the Heaven Array, it had left a trace of its own energy on the array. Even if one was not an array master, they could still activate this array.

“Buzz Buzz Buzz!”

He activated the formation on the jade flute, and a series of unique sounds came from within. In the surrounding void, non-elemental energy began to gather in front of him.

“What kind of treasure is this?”

“Look at the jade flute in his hand. That mysterious and resplendent aura, it doesn’t seem to be inferior to that gourd!”

On the battle platform, when all the Liuli soldiers saw invincible take out another jade flute, their expressions changed once again.

“Does this fellow still have a Supreme Treasure?”

All of Liu Li’s soldiers widened their eyes.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

At this moment, invincible in battle naturally would not disappoint them. A muffled roar sounded.

In the void in front of them, a large number of earth-elemental laws condensed into a huge creature.

On that creature’s body, an aura belonging to a god emperor spread out in the surroundings.

In the next moment, that earth-elemental law creature charged towards a rank one god Emperor Demonic Beast in front of the god Emperor of Shangshui.

“Hiss!”

Seeing this scene, everyone took in a deep breath, their faces filled with shock.

Was this F * CK, was that Guy a treasure trove?

How could he have so many treasures?

A rank one god Emperor creature. That jade flute actually summoned a rank one god Emperor earth-elemental creature!

This…

This was a world treasure!

“Hahaha, Fight for me!”

Invincible battle technique relied on the protection of his paragon mark. With a wave of his arm, he roared loudly and flew towards his master.

“Roar Roar!”

That Earth elemental law creature’s speed was extremely terrifying. Very quickly, it arrived beside Shangshui God Emperor and started fighting with a demonic god Emperor.

“This…”

Shangshui god Emperor pursed his lips when he saw this scene. His eyes were filled with shock.

This disciple of his had actually obtained so many supreme treasures from the Dragon Palace!

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

The two demonic god Emperors who were surrounding Shangshui God Emperor let out furious roars. They waved their huge tails and swept towards Shangshui God Emperor and the earth-elemental creature.

“Master, pin down one and I’ll kill another!”

Invincible battle technique roared loudly. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Alright!”

Shangshui god Emperor’s body trembled as excitement appeared in his eyes. He immediately roared loudly.

His disciple’s trump card was not over yet.

“Boom Boom Boom!”

In a one-on-one situation, Shangshui God Emperor was not afraid of the demonic god Emperor in front of him. He had a jade pot in his hand. With a wave of his arm, a large amount of water elemental laws flew out from the jade pot.

The water elemental laws condensed into various weapons and attacked the demonic god Emperor.

For a moment, the demonic god Emperor was completely suppressed by God Emperor Shangshui.

“Hehe!”

Invincible battle technique came to the front and stroked the immortal slaying calabash in his hand. His face was full of pride.

“Master, pay attention!”

Invincible battle technique roared and the Calabash’s lid was opened.

“All of you, come out!”

With a wave of his hand, the immortal Slayer swords, in addition to the wind-type immortal Slayer swords that could threaten a first-stage celestial thearch, also had fire-type, thunder-type, and wood-type attributes, however, these three attributes could only threaten a peak-stage celestial thearch.

However, they could not withstand the large number of these three attributes.

These three attributes added up to a total of seventy to eighty.

“Attack!”

“Sou Sou Sou!”

With a thought, all the immortal slaying swords flew towards the demonic god Emperor in front of him.

“What a sharp sword, what a terrifying sword!”

Upon sensing the sharpness of the immortal slaying swords, the demonic god Emperor’s pupils constricted slightly. He raised the jade pot in his hand, and water ropes flew out from within, binding the demonic god Emperor.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

The evil demon god-emperor also sensed a strong sense of danger. A look of fear appeared in his eyes, and he wanted to flee into the distance.

However, with Shangshui god-emperor’s obstruction, as well as nearly a hundred immortal slaying swords, they attacked at a terrifying speed.

The evil demon god-emperor only managed to dodge half of the immortal slaying swords.

“Roar! Roar!”

The Scream sounded again.

“Hahaha, killing the god Emperor is like killing a dog!”

The invincible and arrogant voice sounded again.
