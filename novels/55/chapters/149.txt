Chapter 150: Saintess (3)

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

In the future, not only did Thistles and Thorns Sect have a disciple with Inborn Constitution, but it had also gained the friendship of a powerful miracle doctor.

At the thought of this, Vice Sect Leader Lei exchanged glances with the Elder group.

It was clear that they couldn’t hide their excitement.

For the Thistles and Thorns Sect, today was their lucky day.

Just as Vice Sect Leader Lei had shouted previously, the Heavens were blessing the Thistles and Thorns Sect.

“Does Miracle Doctor Wang have any opinion on the master of Xiao Yu. Our intention will be to let our Sect Leader guide Xiao Yu personally. After all, our Sect Leader is a half-step to Inborn expert.”

Vice Sect Leader Lei lowered his stance as he asked Wang Xian once again.

“Let’s stick with Elder Fang. When Xiao Yu enters the Ancient Martial Arts circle, I will also help her out in cultivation,” Wang Xian replied.

“Alright. In that case, let’s go with what Miracle Doctor Wang suggested!” Vice Sect Leader Lei nodded his head.

Xiao Yu smiled, looked at her master and said, “Master, I think that’s better too. It’s you who brought me here while my brother has been hiding these things from me,” Xiao Yu added and it was clear that she was still upset with Wang Xian.

This made Wang Xian smile bitterly. “I was thinking of letting you enjoy your university life.”

Tsk! Xiao Yu rolled her eyes at him before breaking into laughter.

Elder Fang was a little moved. Her previous disciple only had high-class talents but was easily tempted and poached by other people. Now that her current disciple had Inborn Constitution, she wouldn’t agree to letting the Sect Leader be her master, and chose her instead.

She was glad to have a disciple like her.

Different from Elder Fang, the surrounding Elders looked extremely displeased.

“Lei Quan, where’s the disciple with Inborn Constitution?”

At this moment, an agitated voice pierced the atmosphere. Following which, an old man with a head of white hair rushed over at a horrifying pace.

Half-step to Inborn couldn’t walk in the skies yet. Only by reaching the Inborn realm could one levitate in the air for short periods.

“Sect Leader!”

The Elder group and disciples immediately bowed. Vice Sect Leader Lei immediately walked to the old man and repeated the sequence of events.

“Great, great!”

The Sect Leader of Thistles and Thorns Sect was thrilled as he looked at Xiao Yu. After which, he turned to Wang Xian and greeted Wang Xian with his right fist clasped in his left palm.

“Miracle Doctor Wang, I have long heard of you!”

“Sect Leader Tang, greetings!”

Wang Xian exchanged customary words.

“Miracle Doctor Wang, are you really letting Xiao Yu join our Thistles and Thorns Sect? With Xiao Yu’s gift and your ability, it would be easy for you to get her into a Sacred Sect!” Sect Leader Tang asked Wang Xian calmly.

“Since fate brought us here, let’s just go with it. It doesn’t matter if it is a First-class Sect or Sacred Sect,” Wang Xian replied nonchalantly.

“In that case, Xiao Yu will be a member of the Thistles and Thorns Sect from here onwards. Haha. Since Xiao Yu still insisted to let Elder Fang be her master, I’m fine with it. I could find time to guide her in her training in the future too.”

Sect Leader Tang laughed loudly. His face was rosy and he was also very agitated. He hesitated for a moment before making the decision. “Members of Thistles and Thorns Sect, listen!”

“Here!”

All the disciples, including the Elders and Vice Sect Leader Lei all bowed down.

Those juveniles who had not joined Thistles and Thorns Sect also followed and lowered their bodies.

“From today onwards, our Thistles and Thorns Sect will have a Saintess position. Xiao Yu will be the Saintess of the Thistles and Thorns Sect. Her status will be equal to Vice Sect Leader Lei. No one is allowed to go against the words of the Saintess. Otherwise, he would be punished according to our sect rules. When the Saintess reaches the Inborn Realm and leads our Thistles and Thorns Sect forward, she will take over the role as the Sect Leader!” Sect Leader Tang announced to the crowd.

Everyone was shocked but no one objected.

One who had the Inborn Constitution could easily reach the Inborn Realm with cultivation. On that day, she would be able to lead Thistles and Thorns Sect to join the ranks of First-class Sects.

Even if she was made the Saintess, no one would object to it.

Upon hearing the announcement of the Sect Leader, Xiao Yu was stunned and shocked.

Wang Xian stood aside and smiled. Even with Xiao Yu’s constitution, he was a little surprised that Xiao Yu was designated as the Saintess and the future successor of the Sect Leader.

The only question would be if Xiao Yu was willing to take up the role of the Sect Leader.

However, it would be fine even if she wasn’t willing. In the worst scenario, Wang Xian could help to raise an Inborn expert.

Disregarding others, it would be easy for him to create another Inborn Constitution.

Wang Xian was equivalent to a “bug” like existence for the Ancient Martial Arts circle.

However, it would be difficult for him to raise someone above the realm of Inborn.

“Greetings, Saintess!”

An Elder went down on one knee in front of Xiao Yu and greeted with respect.

The surrounding Elders, excluding Xiao Yu’s Master, Elder Fang, also went down on one knee.

The rest of the disciples of Thistles and Thorns Sect had also gone down on one knee as they greeted the Saintess. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Prostration was only done when Xiao Yu assumed the role. Under normal circumstances, even ordinary disciples wouldn’t have to execute such prostration.

After all, modern era thinking was also affecting the Ancient Martial Arts circle.

“You guys... Get up quickly!”

Seeing everyone paying such high respect to her, Xiao Yu’s blushed and spoke quickly.

Below the stage, Zi Yan’er was shivering slightly and her eyes were filled with fear.

She lifted her head and saw the girl she’d been mocking a while ago. She couldn’t help but regret her action.

“Will she expel me? Or...”

Zi Yan’er was filled with horror and fear and did not move an inch while kneeling down. When everyone got up, she didn’t even notice.

Where the Song Family was, Song Aowen also lowered his head. He recalled his arrogant remark previously that this girl was pretty.

If he dared to say this at this moment, disregarding others, his grandfather would kill him.

You’re just a piece of trash. She’s way out of your league!

“Mm. All newly enrolled disciples gather in front!” Vice Sect Leader Lei nodded his head in approval and said to the group of juveniles in front of him.

The group of juveniles immediately rushed forward and stood upright.

Vice Sect Leader Lei looked across and his attention eventually landed on Zi Yan’er.

Seeing Vice Sect Leader Lei staring at her, Zi Yan’er’s expression turned as white as a sheet.

“Are you Zi Yan’er? Your talents are still commendable. From here on out, you shall follow behind the Saintess and are in charge of her living needs!” Vice Sect Leader Lei announced.

“She’s so lucky to be able to stay close to the future Inborn expert!”

“She could follow the Saintess around! What a lucky girl!”

The juveniles looked at Zi Yan’er with envy.

Upon hearing the words of Vice Sect Leader Lei, Zi Yan’er’s expression turned even paler. Her legs went wobbly and she almost fell to the ground.

With a little crying tone, she answered, “Yes!”

“Mm.” When Vice Sect Leader Lei saw her, he thought she was just a little agitated and wasn’t too concerned.

Xiao Yu looked at that girl and revealed a smile. However, she wasn’t intending to be calculative with her!
