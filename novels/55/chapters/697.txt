Translator: 549690339

“Oh no, they are lying in wait for me. Hurry over!”

The bewitching woman let out a sharp voice and shouted angrily.

“It’s Too Late!”

Wang Xian revealed a cold expression. The attacks of the three of them arrived in an instant.

“You guys...”

The bewitching woman felt that her voice was blocked by a layer of energy. Her expression was extremely ferocious. She waved her arm and the human skull staff in her hand was swung forward.

“Evil ghosts devour gods!”

“Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!”

One by one, the evil-looking human skull staff emitted ferocious ghost shadows. The terrifying energy attacked Wang Xian and the rest.

“Boom!”

Wang Xian’s spiritual sword dispersed the ghost shadows formed by the demonic aura. The ocean-pacifying divine needle and Ao Qitian’s sword attacked the woman.

“Ah!”

A ferocious look appeared on the evil-looking woman’s face. She resisted the attacks of Ao Jian and AO qitian. She spat out blood instantly and fled into the distance.

“Can you escape?”

Wang Xian’s expression did not change. Five spiritual swords charged towards the demonic woman in an instant.

Ao Jian waved his arm and golden silent longswords appeared in front of the demonic woman.

Boom

Ao qitian held a terrifying ocean-pacifying needle that was 200 meters in size and smashed it towards the demonic woman.

The attacks caused the demonic woman’s expression to change drastically. Her Eyes revealed a look of panic.

“Young Demon was killed by you guys?”

She let out a shrill scream. The human skull staff in her hand spun rapidly around him. The demonic aura on her body formed numerous devil gates to defend herself.

The longer she stayed here, the lower her chances of survival would be.

Boom

The demonic woman forcefully withstood Wang Xian and Ao Jian’s attack. Under ao Qitian’s attack, her entire arm was deformed.

Her entire body was extremely miserable.

Buzz

However, the bewitching Lady’s eyes were filled with intense excitement.

She rushed out of the formation and escaped.

“Save...”

She raised her head. Her eyes were filled with madness as she opened her mouth to cry out for help.

PFFT

At this moment, despair appeared on her face.

“No wonder, no wonder...”

The bewitching lady widened her eyes and stared at the strange demon beside her. Her eyes were filled with unwillingness.

“Bang!”

The bewitching lady fell toward the bottom of the sea. Wang Xian waved his arm and made her fall onto the surface of the sea. Then, he kept her interspatial ring.

Wang Xian stood on the surface of the sea with a smile on his face. “There are already two of them. I’m afraid they are already panicking!”

“Dragon King, it might be a little difficult to assassinate them next!”

Ao Jian said with a slightly solemn tone.

“There’s no rush. We’ll wait here. I don’t believe that they will never act alone!”

The corner of Wang Xian’s mouth curled up slightly. “Even if they really gather together, we’ll wait until Yu Ding appears and Prime Minister Gui is added. If there are sufficient resources, another immortal God will appear in the Dragon Palace and we can attack them directly!” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Snow demon and blood arrow were the leaders of the two immortal sects. The other immortal gods were weaker than them.

Furthermore, according to the information he obtained, in the ten years when tens of millions of people were raising Gu, two old men were the ones who advanced to become immortal gods.

Clearly, those two old men were only inferior immortals.

If there were six immortal gods, Wang Xian could attack them directly and kill them directly.

“Let’s play with them slowly!”

Wang Xian said with a cold gaze. So what if they were immortals? Even if they were high and mighty and controlled the lives of tens of millions of people.

However, if they provoked him, they would have to pay a heavy price and pay with their lives.

“Go to the island and find a place to hide. Now, they definitely won’t dare to search anymore!”

The corner of Wang Xian’s mouth curled up slightly. He moved his body and flew toward an island.

At this moment, everyone was standing at the location of the six islands.

Above one of the islands, the snow demon and blood arrow were standing in the air. Their expressions were extremely gloomy.

“Huff! Huff!”

At this moment, the silhouettes of two old men appeared. Their faces were filled with shock. “Something happened to young demon?”

“It’s possible!”

Snow Demon’s face was gloomy. His entire body was shrouded in demonic qi. Only his blood-red eyes were filled with a brutal expression.

“If it were two lower-level immortal gods, it would be impossible to kill young demon. Unless there are three of them. Furthermore, we didn’t sense any energy from the fight. They might have used a method to block us!”

An old man said with a gloomy face and flickering eyes.

“They only dared to launch a sneak attack. They must be weaker than us. The five of US will search together and search from the weakest part of the array to the inside. As long as they are still here, we will definitely be able to find them!”

Blood Arrow held a blood-red demonic longbow in his hand. “Even if we have to turn the world of the cauldron of Yu upside down, we must kill them all!”

The two elders fell silent for a moment.

The killing intent in the Snow Demon’s body seemed to be corporeal, making people feel extremely cold.

“Why isn’t Hong Ying Here Yet? !”

Blood Arrow suddenly widened his eyes and looked in the direction where the demonic woman was searching.

The expressions of the few people changed drastically as they fixed their gazes on her. A trace of fear flashed through their eyes.

“Hong Ying!”

An elder shouted in a deep voice. His voice resounded throughout the entire world of the cauldron of Yu.

No one responded. There was no sound.

“Hu hu!”

The two elders’breathing was heavy. They were originally the weakest of the six.

Now that Hong Ying and the young demon, who were stronger than them, had disappeared, it was obvious what would happen to them if they were the ones who were attacked.

A faint sense of panic surged into their hearts.

The two elders exchanged a glance and looked at Snow Demon and blood arrow. “What should we do now?”

“What should we do?”

Snow demon and blood arrow trembled slightly. Young Demon was dead, and Hong Ying had been killed without anyone knowing.

Should they search for the unknown powerful enemy?

What if the enemy was ambushing them?

The two of them did not dare to take the risk, but if they did not find the enemy, wouldn’t they have to live in fear in the future.

As immortals and gods, as rulers who controlled a small world, they had never encountered such a thing.

Assassination. Thinking about how they were best at assassination, they felt that it was a great irony!

“Don’t let me know who you are, don’t let me know where you are!”

The Snow Demon clenched its arms tightly, and its snow-white arms emitted crisp sounds.

“The enemy is in the dark while I am in the light. Let’s go back and think of a way to deal with them for the time being!”

Blood Arrow slightly narrowed his eyes and said to them.

The two old men nodded in agreement. At this time, forget about continuing to search, it was already good enough that they were not assassinated.

A special light flashed in the eyes of the two old men as they flew toward their island.

The snow demon and the Blood Arrow turned into a demonic shadow and disappeared.

Below, the people on the island, the disciples of the Jade Hand Immortal sect and Corpse Chief Dao, watched this scene in shock.

Their immortal gods had fallen, and there were two of them!
