Chapter 1389: 1389

“Why is he here? Why is he here? This... this...” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

In front of a pavilion near the central auction stage, a middle-aged man stood up and stared at Wang Xian with a trembling body.

He never expected to encounter such a legendary existence in this place.

The last time he saw Wang Xian was during the selection of the Crown Prince of the Guanglong dynasty.

The battle that day had shaken the entire demi-human graveyard.

Only after witnessing the terrifying strength of the nameless sword demon did he know what was terrifying.

An old monster at the fifth level of the Seethrough realm who had lived for thousands of years was killed directly.

That terrifying millstone could easily wipe out an entire empire.

“Thirteenth brother, What’s Wrong?”

Beside the middle-aged man, a middle-aged man with a beard and wearing a wide robe who was sitting in the middle saw the shocked expression on his brother’s face. He raised his eyebrows and asked curiously.

This thirteenth brother of his had stayed in a cruel place like the demi-human graveyard for a long time. Logically speaking, he shouldn’t be so excited.

“Big Brother, it’s that person...”

He swallowed his saliva, his eyes still filled with shock.

“Thirteenth uncle, slow down. What made you so shocked? !”

The youth sitting beside the wide-robed middle-aged man asked curiously.

“Big Brother, do you know the Nameless Sword Demon? The supreme prodigy? The evildoer who destroyed the fifth-level ice child of the Void Interpretation Stage!”

The middle-aged man gulped and said to the middle-aged man in the robe.

“Yes, you told me about this before. Could it be?”

The middle-aged man in the robe was also slightly surprised. His eyes were sparkling.

“He is there!”

The middle-aged man widened his eyes and pointed at Wang Xian.

“What?”

The middle-aged man quickly turned his head and fixed his gaze on Wang Xian.

“Thirteenth brother, is... is what you said true?”

The middle-aged man asked with a trembling figure.

“I’m sure. I’m 100% sure that it’s him. It’s definitely him!”

The middle-aged man said with certainty.

“This...”

The expression of the middle-aged man changed drastically. A terrifying powerhouse who could kill a fifth-level insightful void martial artist could completely change the order of the entire region.

The reason why Xiao Yao city was so powerful here was because of the fifth-level profound void martial artist, Xiao Yao City Lord.

“Investigate the faction that Lord is from and think of a way to curry favor with him!”

The wide-robed middle-aged man said directly.

The youth sitting at the side widened his eyes. “He’s so young, and he’s actually a terrifying expert!”

“It’s Big Brother!”

“Congratulations to everyone from the dragon-phoenix dynasty for obtaining the first batch of green nether pills!”

At this moment, the auctioneer’s voice sounded from the stage!

“Dragon-phoenix Empire!”

The middle-aged man in the robe was slightly shocked as he looked into the middle-aged man’s eyes with a hint of solemnity.

If a empire wanted to become stronger, it had to expand,

if it wanted to expand, it had to conquer other empires.

“If I remember correctly, the dragon-phoenix Empire destroyed four empires not long after the nameless sword demon left!”

The middle-aged man gulped as his eyes flickered.

They were a powerful sect, and their influence was much stronger than ordinary dynasties.

Within the sect, there were three or four profound void tier four experts.

But compared to nameless sword demon, they were still far from it!

“Be friendly. Sects and dynasties are not irreconcilable!”

The wide-robed middle-aged man decided.

“The dragon-phoenix dynasty is actually the dragon-phoenix Dynasty!”

“So they are actually from the dragon-phoenix dynasty. No wonder they are able to sit so close to the front!”

“The dragon-phoenix dynasty is very strong!”

When the surrounding factions heard the auctioneer’s voice, they looked at Wang Xian and the rest in astonishment.

“The dragon-phoenix dynasty, the one that has risen recently?”

At this moment, under a pavilion closest to the central auction stage, the young city lord in white looked over curiously.

“Yes, it’s a newly risen empire. I heard that this empire is a queen and is very strong. It should be the strongest among the neighboring empires. Our Empire is far from that!”

A lady sitting beside the young city Lord said with a smile.

“Is that so, Qianying? But with me around in the future, your Jinliang dynasty will become stronger and stronger!”

The young city lord narrowed his eyes and looked at the woman in front of him greedily.

“Hehe, then I’ll thank you, Young City Lord!”

The woman said to him with a smile.

“Young city lord, this guy from the Dragon and Phoenix dynasty is extremely arrogant. Yesterday, I invited him to the banquet, and he said he wasn’t interested. Humph, he’s very arrogant!”

At this moment, Yao Dingfeng and Liu Shaohua, who were not far away, came over and said angrily.

“Oh Really? Hehe, don’t mind him!”

The young city lord smiled faintly and did not take it to heart. It could be said that he did not take the dragon and Phoenix dynasty seriously.

“If the young city Lord had spoken, he would not have refused!”

The woman at the side leaned closer to the young city Lord’s side, and the huge Xiong Division leaned on his body.

“Hehe, that’s natural, that’s natural. Even if he had four or five guts, he wouldn’t dare to be impudent with the young city Lord!”

The two saw that the young city Lord didn’t put the Dragon and Phoenix Empire in his eyes at all, so they didn’t say anything else and just smiled and nodded.

“Qianying, what do you want? I’ll buy it for you later!”

The young city Lord smiled and put his arm around the woman’s shoulder as he asked with a smile.

“Really? Then I won’t stand on ceremony with you, Young City Lord. I heard that this water pearl can beautify one’s appearance, Hehe!”

The woman said happily.

“Haha, Alright, Alright. I’ll buy it for you later!”

The young city Lord laughed out loud with a big smile on his face.

Around them, some of the ladies looked at the lady enviously.

“The second batch of green nether pills. The Dragon and Phoenix Empire is offering 57 billion middle-grade spirit stones. Is there anyone else who wants to raise the bid?”

The second batch of green nether pills began to be sold. When Wang Xian continued to bid, the two factions gave up after competing for a while.

“Congratulations to everyone from the Dragon and Phoenix Empire for obtaining the second batch of green nether pills. The third batch will still be auctioned off at 50 billion middle-grade Spirit Stones!”

“55 billion middle-grade spirit stones!”

Wang Xian raised his hand and raised it to 55 billion!

“This... The Dragon and Phoenix Empire is really rich!”

“That’s right. They must have destroyed four empires. A few hundred billion might be an easy feat for them!”

“It seems like he can’t compete with all the pills he wants. Forget it, forget it!”

After Wang Xian continued to bid, some of the forces around him shook their heads slowly.

Wang Xian was allowed to buy all three sets of elixirs in a row.

The next items to be auctioned were some other items. Wang Xian did not bid for them either.

“The next item to be auctioned is the water element cultivator. Please take note that this is a treasure. It is a water bead, an item at the first level of the void interpretation stage. It is similar to the water spirit bead but different. Wearing it on one’s body can enhance one’s beauty!”

After auctioning off more than ten items consecutively, another item was taken out.

“Oh right, Jin Ming, I’ll go to propose marriage in two days. Have you thought about what you want to take?”

Wang Xian looked at the water elemental orb and asked Duan Jinming who was beside him.

“AH? Take Something? This...”

Duan Jinming scratched his head.

“You have to be smarter when picking up girls!”

Wang Xian patted his shoulder and said, “Let me prepare the item for you!”

“Thank you, Dragon King. Thank you!”

The Honest Duan Jinming thanked him immediately.
