2859 2859, we, the eight desolates, must kill him! 4

The eight desolates’Protector had arrived and did not put invincible battle technique in his eyes at all.

Invincible battle technique also knew that there might be trouble in the future.

There was only one way to escape!

When Ye lui Ying and the other martial siblings saw the appearance of the eight desolates’protector, their faces turned pale.

“Escape? You killed our eight desolates’disciple in the eight desolates, and you still want to escape?”

!!

When the eight Barrens Protector, who was holding a horsetail whisk, heard the words of the invincible warrior, a mocking look appeared in his eyes.

“The invincible warrior, don’t cause trouble for your master, and don’t think that your master can save you if you make a mistake. Even your master, God Emperor Shangshui, can’t protect you!”

He stared at the invincible warrior coldly and warned him in a deep voice.

“HMPH, this matter has nothing to do with my master. It’s completely my own doing!”

Invincible battle technique raised his head and coldly snorted.

“Hehe, if it’s your own doing, then we will kill you!”

Protector bhang coldly stared at invincible battle technique and said coldly.

From their point of view, without God Emperor Shangshui, provoking them was no different from courting death.

“Wudi, come over quickly. We won’t participate in this matter!”

When Tian Xin heard Protector Budi’s words, an anxious expression appeared on her face. She immediately spoke to Wudi of battle technique.

“Tian Xin, how could a loyal person like me, Wudi of battle technique, do such a cowardly thing? HMPH, today, this young master wants to experience your Budi!”

Invincible in battle technique said coldly.

“Big Brother Invincible is too loyal. However, I’m afraid we’ll Be in big trouble. Let’s quickly contact Big Brother Invincible’s senior brothers and let them contact water god Emperor!”

“This is bad, this is bad. Our Invincible Big Brother is so stubborn that even ten oxen can not pull him over. If eight desolates really makes a ruthless move, then invincible Big Brother will be finished!”

A few youths revealed anxious expressions as they said.

“This invincible battle technique is very loyal. He would rather offend bhang to protect that young man!”

“If that invincible battle technique really offended bhang, then protector bhang would really dare to kill him.”

“Who is that young man? How come I’ve never seen him before? To be able to make invincible battle technique and the disciples of the sacred religion protect him like this, he must not be simple!”

In the surrounding area, a distress signal bullet attracted more and more people as they discussed in low voices.

“Attack! That Kid, we will definitely kill bhang. Kill everyone who dares to help him!”

Bhang’s horsetail whisk-wielding protector gave an order with a cold expression.

Hearing this order, invincible battle technique’s expression changed slightly.

“Master is here. Master, you are finally here!”

However, at this moment, a pleasantly surprised voice came from the side.

Upon hearing this voice, everyone around was slightly stunned.

“He’s here again?”

“An expert from the Holy Region?”

Everyone hurriedly looked towards the direction of ye Lui Ying’s gaze.

Buzz

At this moment, a graceful and elegant lady dressed in green clothes flew towards them.

The lady seemed to be quite old. She was walking in the windless forest. In the next moment, she arrived in front of Wang Xian.

“Huh?”

Upon seeing the lady’s appearance, the eyes of the three guardians of bhang froze slightly.

“Hong Fengyan from the Holy Region!”

Hong Fengyan looked at the severely injured Wang Xian and took out an elixir for him. She turned her head and looked at the three guardians of Bhang. She cupped her hands.

On the way, Ye Lui Ying and the rest had already told her the details through the communication stone plate.

“What? The Guardian of the Holy Region wants to protect the person who killed our eight desolates disciple? Or is he also a disciple of Your Holy Region?”

In a confrontation of the same level, the guardian of the eight desolates took a few steps forward and locked his gaze on Hong Fengyan.

“Although I am a guardian of the holy region, this matter has nothing to do with the Holy Region. Furthermore, he is not a disciple of the holy region. I wonder how everyone can resolve this grudge?”

Hong Feng Yan looked at them indifferently, waving her arm, the wind jade flew towards them, there were over a hundred of them, within the Wind Jade, there was another God Weapon, a Pinnacle Undying Emperor God weapon! Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Hiss, what a huge sum!”

“To exchange such a valuable item for that youth’s life, this… looks like that youth is very important to the Saint Domain Protector!”

“A divine weapon at the peak of the Immortal King Realm. If bhang agrees to it, it would be a huge profit!”

Some of the people around were discussing in hushed voices.

Even the experts of bhang and the rest had heated eyes and were shocked in their hearts.

“Wow, boss Wang, who is this beautiful big sister?”

Invincible battle technique was also slightly surprised when he saw Hong Fengyan’s handwriting. He winked at Wang Xian who was beside him.

Wang Xian glanced at him and ignored him. He took out his communication stone plate and sent another message.

They were a little slow!

“The lives of our disciples of the eight barrens can not be compared to some dead objects. If we accept this, do you think we can take some treasures and kill our disciples of the eight barrens as we please?”

“Humph, do you really think that our eight barrens is some small sect?”

“He, our eight desolates must be killed. No one can save him. Attack! I want to see who dares to help him!”

The eight desolates’protector, who was holding a horsetail whisk, stared at Hong Fengyan and ordered.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

The disciples of the eight desolates, who had long been prepared, immediately released powerful auras.

“Boom!”

However, when their auras were released, a powerful aura also surged from Hong Fengyan’s body.

“I will protect him today!”

Everyone around seemed to have heard Feng Xiao’s voice. Hong Fengyan seemed to be standing in the center of Feng Xiao as she coldly glanced at everyone in the eight barrens.

“Good, good, good. If you want to protect him, then you will die!”

Killing intent appeared in the eyes of the eight barrens’three protectors. The old man holding the horsetail whisk in the middle moved and directly attacked Hong Fengyan.

The two protectors beside him followed closely behind.

“Oh no, it’s going to start a fight!”

“Peak king God level combat strength, let’s Retreat!”

When the surrounding people saw this scene, their expressions changed drastically as they shouted loudly.

“Invincible, come over quickly!”

“Junior sister, let’s retreat quickly. Invincible in combat techniques is courting death. Does he really think that he can be so lawless just by relying on a divine emperor’s master? Little Junior sister, it’s best that you don’t come into contact with such reckless fellows in the future!”

Tian Xin shouted at invincible in battle tactics.

The two middle-aged men behind her immediately retreated with her body.

“F * ck, boss Wang. We… We should prepare to escape later! We are very good at escaping!”

Invincible in battle tactics’s mouth twitched. He opened his mouth and said to Wang Xian.

“Eh?”

Wang Xian stood there without moving. He didn’t pay attention to invincible in battle tactics either.

Looking at Hong Fengyan who was protecting him, his eyes sparkled.

Buzz

When Hong Fengyan saw the three guardians of the eight desolates attacking her, her expression didn’t change at all.

In the sky above her, a tornado was formed. In the next moment, the tornado slowly solidified and formed a green gourd!
