Chapter 22: Who Didn’t Know How to Show Off Pompously?

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

When the middle-aged man heard what Wang Xian said, he was slightly shocked.

“What did you say? You have better pearls?”

The middle-aged man looked at him with doubts and started chuckling soon after. In a demeaning and mocking way, he said, “Brat, do you even know what a pearl is? What are natural and wild pearls? Do you know about the colors and quality differentiation?”

“I didn’t find out about them in the past so I don’t know about that. However, I have some pearls with me and they are indeed better than those pearls this beautiful lady is wearing.”

As he spoke, he took out the pearls from his pocket one after another. “Natural pearls. As for their condition, I’m not too sure about that. Nonetheless, these are definitely much better than yours.”

“What pearls do you have there?” The middle-aged man saw the pearls in Wang Xian’s hands and was filled with doubt. However, nonchalance was written all over his face. “Natural pearls are valuable treasures. How could yours be real?”

Wang Xian’s lip was slightly drawn upon hearing what the middle-aged man said. “We will know once we get them to appraise the pearls.”

Wang Xian headed over to the service attendant at the cabinet and asked, “Does this shop collect pearls?”

The service attendant looked at Wang Xian with astonishment. She nodded her head and replied, “Yeah we do but we only collect pearls in good condition.”

“In that case, please help me take a look at these and give me an appraisal of the value,” Wang Xian said to the service attendant.

“Alright Mister, please wait a minute. I’ll go and get my manager.” The service attendant saw the pearls in his hands and immediately went to the back of the shop to call the manager over.

“These pearls are really huge!” At this moment, the beautiful lady just beside him was looking at the pearls in Wang Xian’s hands in astonishment.

Wang Xian smiled and answered carefreely, “20mm. Just slightly larger than those you are wearing. These pearls are round and without flaws. I believe they are worth at least several hundreds of thousands.”

The beautiful lady’s mouth gaped open.

The middle-aged man’s face took on a ghastly expression and he said, “We aren’t even sure if they are real. If they are real, you must be really lucky.”

“Hehe.”

Wang Xian chuckled, “These are just some pearls. So what if they are real? It’s just several hundreds of thousands.”

Showing off! Wang Xian was openly doing it in front of him. As compared to the middle-aged man’s subtle way of doing it, his way was more direct.

“Several hundreds of thousand is already really expensive,” the beautiful lady beside him commented.

“It isn’t, it isn’t. It’s just several hundreds of thousands.” Wang Xian shook his head as he remarked. The way he was acting currently was very similar to a property tycoon. “After starting my business for some years, I still have some wealth.”

“Awesome! To start a business when you are still so young,” the beautiful lady replied in astonishment.

This caused the middle-aged man beside her to take on a ghastly expression. What the hell! This ordinarily dressed brat sure is great at boasting.

“Sir, please let our manager take a look at your pearls.” At this moment, the service attendant walked over and spoke to him.

Wang Xian nodded his head and handed the pearls to the female manager on the other side of the cabinet.

When the manager took over the pearls from his hands, her face was filled with bewilderment. She immediately took out a magnifying glass to take a closer look.

“Natural pearls! These are natural pearls.”

The manager was shocked. After which, she took out a ruler to measure.

“20mm natural pearls without any trace of impurities. Round and without any flaws. This is simply unbelievable. These pearls are of the highest quality even among the highest quality pearls.”

The manager couldn’t contain her astonishment.

“Of course!” Wang Xian was pleasantly surprised. Wang Xian had checked the value of 20mm natural pearls online and they were really valuable. Moreover, if the pearls were made into a string of necklace, the value would be even higher.

“Mister, are you looking to sell these pearls?” the manager looked at Wang Xian and asked

frantically.

“I’m selling. May I know how much you could offer me?” Wang Xian nodded his head.

“This...” The manager frowned. This was the first time she’d seen such precious pearls and therefore she couldn’t determine a price at the moment.

“$500k. Mister, are you alright with the offer?” The manager threw out an offer price.

“$500k?” When Wang Xian heard this offer price, he was rather satisfied but he didn’t agree to it immediately. “I’m selling quite a few of them. Is it possible to increase the price a little more?”

“What? Mister, do you have more pearls with such grade?” The manager looked at him with astonishment.

Wang Xian smiled and took out all the pearls from his pocket.

There were a total of 16 pearls with four white, four black, four gold and four pink pearls.

Each pearl was almost the same size and gave off a mesmerizing glow.

The manager’s eyes popped wide open. “Oh my gosh... You have so many and every single one of them is of the highest quality.”

“16 pearls could be used to make an entire set of pearl jewellery or into a pearl necklace. I believe that the offer price could be increased a little more.” Wang Xian looked at the shocked expression of the manager and spoke with a giggling smile.

“Wow, these pearls are so beautiful!” The beautiful lady took a look at the pearl and jade jewellery on her before looking at the pearls in Wang Xian’s hand. They were completely of a different grade.

“With so many pearls, wouldn’t it mean that these are worth at least $8 million?” The beautiful lady’s eyes popped wide open and her jaw dropped.

Wang Xian glanced at the beautiful lady and middle-aged man and said, “Yeah, these are worth at least $8 million. However, if it’s just $8 million, I clearly wouldn’t sell them. Hey uncle, if you are interested and can offer me a suitable price, I can sell them to you.”

As he spoke, the corners of his mouth arced upwards.

The middle-aged man couldn’t help but feel his mouth twitching. He had a heavy expression on his face and kept silent.

“Mister, Deep-sea Jewellery would like to purchase your pearls.” At this moment, the manager got a little flustered upon hearing what Wang Xian said.

Top grade pearls had always been in demand but there might not be a supply for it. Moreover, natural pearls were hard to come by. If she could purchase these 16 top grade pearls and make them into a set of jewellery or even just a pearl necklace, it would definitely become the attraction of Deep-sea Jewellery.

“Mister, please wait a minute. I’m not authorized to make decisions for transactions in the range of over $10 million. Please wait a moment while I report this to the headquarters.”

“Alright!” Wang Xian nodded his head.

“Please come in.” The manager opened the small door leading to the back of the cabinet in a hurry and said to Wang Xian.

“Mm.” Wang Xian nodded his head. When he walked to the position of the middle-aged man, he paused. He lifted his hand, patted his shoulder and said, “Uncle, if you wish to woo a beautiful lady, you’ve got to work hard. After all, there are many rich young men nowadays and you are already so old. Money is one aspect but you have to be sincere too. Hehe.”

As Wang Xian spoke, he put on a demeanor of an elder educating a younger guy. After which, Wang Xian headed to the waiting room in the back of Deep-sea Jewellery shop. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Who didn’t know how to show off pompously nowadays? Even if you couldn’t, you would at least know how to boast, right?

However to show off in front of others, one would still need to have some capital. Wang Xian believed that he still had the capital to do so currently.

Whoever wishes to show off in front of me has to assess themselves first.

The middle-aged man was extremely displeased. After seeing Wenwen who seemed to be hesitating, his displeasure was even more apparent.

After all, he was already over 40 years old. The only advantage he had was that he had family assets of more than $10 million.
