Chapter 897: 0898 shook the holy sea town

Translator: 549690339

“This piece of paper is called Congratulations!”

“Congratulations on your death!”

“Dragon Assassin Organization!”

The woman standing in front of the city guards widened her eyes and read the words on the door in shock.

A huge red piece of paper was stuck on the door. It looked festive, but the words on it made people feel inexplicably horrified.

Congratulations on death!

A red piece of paper!

Dragon assassin organization!

The door opened and attracted the attention of the people on the street outside. When they saw the piece of paper stuck on the door, they all widened their eyes. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Dragon Assassin organization? What kind of assassin organization is this? Why am I hearing about it for the first time?”

“It’s too arrogant, too domineering. It actually... actually assassinated the vice leader of the Dogfish mercenary group. It seems that other than him, a lot of people died!”

“Is this a newly established assassin organization? How terrifying!”

The surrounding people widened their eyes, their eyes filled with fear.

The horned shark mercenary group, one of the top three mercenary groups in the entire holy sea town, had been directly killed by an assassin. The death of the Vice Leader Ao Kuang was simply shocking.

Ao Kuang, A Level 5 transcendent, was a powerhouse in the entire holy sea town. Now, he was actually killed in the base.

It seemed that this dragon assassin organization was able to assassinate most of the people in holy sea town, and even most of the powerhouses.

“Dragon Assassin Organization, Dragon Assassin Organization!”

Two low growls came out of the mouth of the captain. His eyes were blood-red, and he clenched his fists tightly. His body was emitting a terrifying aura.

“It’s that kid, it must be that kid. You deserve to die, deserve to die!”

As he said that, his eyes flashed with a cold glint. He suddenly raised his head and gritted his teeth, his expression ferocious.

Although the thirty over people who were assassinated today were not the full strength of the Dogfish mercenary group, they still took up half of it.

This was his life’s work. Now that half of it had been destroyed, how could he not be angry?

“That Kid?”

The surrounding city guards looked at each other when they heard the words of the dogfish mercenary group leader.

This was a vendetta. It was normal on the transcendental continent, but the other party had hired an assassin.

The woman standing in front took out a jade plate and looked at it, but she didn’t find any traces.

Just like yesterday, the assassin had concealed himself well.

Looking at the red paper on the door, she not only sighed, this assassin organization was too arrogant.

After killing, they had left a mark to prove that they had killed the person. They were extremely arrogant.

“Captain Dogfish, I’m sorry for your loss!”

A middle-aged City Guard said after hesitating for a moment. He then looked at the woman in front of him.

The woman nodded and the group walked out.

This was their personal grudge. The city guards would not get involved and would not look for the murderer.

Unless captain dogfish could produce enough evidence, they would not make a move to arrest him.

They had no way to deal with the assassin organization.

This was a world where force was the most important thing. If they really wanted to catch the assassins, it would be a pipe dream.

Most importantly, if they really wanted to catch the assassins, they would become enemies with the assassin organization.

The assassin organization didn’t care if you were an official of the kingdom or a minister of the kingdom.

Since they were enemies, it was possible to assassinate the public officials of holy sea town, or even the city guards.

This wasn’t impossible. The assassin organization was in the dark. If they didn’t have the ability to completely eliminate them, it was best not to provoke them.

Otherwise, there would be endless trouble in the future.

Every kingdom and Empire had an assassin organization. A powerful assassin organization even made the Empire afraid.

Their small holy sea town could not afford to offend an assassin organization.

A group of city guards walked out. When the people gathered outside saw them, they discussed in low voices.

The news of the assassination of the vice leader of the Dogfish mercenary group spread very quickly.

The assassination of a transcendent level 5 expert spread throughout the entire holy sea town in the morning.

When they learned of the actions of the dragon assassin organization, their faces were filled with shock.

“After the assassination, the assassin left behind a red piece of paper. The name of the paper is ‘Congratulations’, which means ‘Congratulations on your death’. It’s too arrogant!”

“Dragon Assassin organization, is this a newly established organization or an assassin organization from another place? This is the first time I’ve heard of it, but this assassination can be said to be famous after one battle!”

“I wonder how to contact this assassin organization?”

Some people were discussing in shock, while others were thinking about how to contact the assassin organization.

Many people knew that there was an undercurrent assassin organization in Holy Sea Town.

The undercurrent was the strongest assassin organization in the entire star-moon kingdom, but this assassin organization had too few people and too high a commission. Once it failed, it would only refund half of the commission. Unless forced, no one would hire assassins.

Not to mention hiring powerful assassins to deal with their own enemies.

Assassins were not easy to nurture, and not everyone could become an assassin.

For example, if one wanted to become an assassin, one had to have a fixed inheritance and a fixed method of advancement.

When an assassin wanted to become an assassin, they first had to possess a powerful concealment divine ability. Generally speaking, a divine ability corresponded to a corresponding attribute.

For example, the supernatural ability of the undercurrent would temporarily turn into water and enter the room. To execute this supernatural ability, one first had to possess the water attribute.

Secondly, one had to comprehend this supernatural ability of turning into water.

This was only the first step to becoming a killer. Just this step alone would stop countless people.

This was only the beginning. To become a beginner-level killer, one could hunt warriors at the first or second stage of the extraordinary realm.

Next, one had to comprehend the supernatural ability related to assassination.

The comprehension of supernatural ability did not mean that one could comprehend any type of supernatural ability. It was very difficult to comprehend supernatural ability, let alone a fixed supernatural ability. It was several times more difficult.

On the transcendence continent, there were many warriors at the first level of transcendence. Above that, it would decrease by several hundred times.

Some people might not be able to comprehend a second supernatural ability even after one or two hundred years.

Even if an assassin comprehended a second killing divine ability, he would only be able to assassinate martial artists at the third level of the extraordinary realm. The success rate of assassinating martial artists one level higher than him would be less than 30% .

Not to mention comprehending a fixed divine ability.

However, if you didn’t comprehend a fixed divine ability, that was fine. You were an assassin, but if you comprehended an area-of-effect attack with a large area-of-effect attack, then what was the point of assassinating?

When you use your divine ability, others will notice it.

An assassin would take advantage of their surprise and kill them in one strike. If they couldn’t do it, they would immediately flee thousands of miles away. To an assassin, an area-of-effect attack was simply courting death.

Moreover, not many people were willing to become an assassin who lived in the darkness, unless the assassin organization nurtured their own loyal assassins!

Then, it was already rare for a fifth rank extraordinary assassin to be nurtured out of 100,000 people.

And the cost of nurturing such an assassin was too terrifying!

The assassins in this world were not as easy to nurture as on Earth.

Of course, if it was only to assassinate a martial artist at the first rank of the extraordinary, it would still be easy to nurture an assassin at this level.

Clearly, this was only an assassin of a lower level.

All sorts of harsh conditions resulted in very few assassins.

Even the biggest assassin organization in star-moon kingdom, undercurrent, had only assassinated a rank 9 transcendent.

This had shocked the entire star-moon kingdom.
