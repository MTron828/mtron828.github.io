The girl looked at her post with a smug look on her face. She edited the picture and sent it directly.

After the post was edited, it immediately appeared on the campus forum.

“Let’s go and take a look!”

After the girl posted the post, she gloated and looked forward.

Around them, the students were slightly shocked when they saw the two war chariots stopped in front of Wang Xian and the rest. They quickly looked over.

“D * mn it. Mu Zidao and Ming Feng went to look for trouble with senior Wang Xian. Let’s hurry over!”

“B * Stard. Do you think you can bully others just because you are a disciple of the celestial sect?”

“This is bad. Let’s hurry to the entrance of the school!”

“Sigh, what can we do if we go? Mu Zidao and Ming Feng are disciples of the immortal sect. Their statuses are noble and their strength is terrifying. They can seriously injure us with just a wave of their hands. Moreover, they won’t be punished!”

At this moment, after the post was published, it immediately attracted the attention of many students.

Seeing the information on it, many students instantly revealed embarrassed expressions.

The news spread quickly in the class wechat Group, and a group of students rushed to the school gate.

The first and second year girls were very excited. They didn’t expect their Prince Charming to be so awesome.

“Prince Charming must have seen the posts in the forum and come out to fight for us!”

A group of young girls thought excitedly and quickly ran toward the school gate.

All of a sudden, all the students who received the news rushed towards the entrance.

At the entrance, Wang Xian looked at the puppet war chariot that was parked beside them and sized him up curiously.

Mu Zidao and Ming Feng, who were sitting inside, sized up Wang Xian with their eyes. The corners of their mouths curled up slightly.

The few people in the chariot got off. Mu Zidao raised his head slightly and looked down at Wang Xian arrogantly. “You’re that Wang Xian, the so-called Dragon King of the Dragon Gate!”

“Gulp.”

“Wang Xian, let’s not argue with them. Let’s leave this place!”

Beside them, a few students in the class saw Mu Zidao and Ming Feng and the rest. They gulped and their eyes were filled with fear. They tugged at Wang Xian’s arm and whispered.

“Hehe!”

Wang Xian chuckled and nodded to the students beside him. Then, he walked straight out.

“Stop, did I let you leave?”

Mu Zidao and Ming Feng raised their eyebrows slightly when they saw Wang Xian ignoring them and leaving.

Liang Guwen, who was beside them, shouted at Wang Xian with a cold expression. His eyes were filled with coldness.

What happened in the martial arts club today had caused him to lose all his face. He was extremely furious.

Now that he saw Wang Xian’s cold expression, he was even more furious.

“That Wang Xian actually wants to leave. Looks like he’s cowardly!”

“Heh, he’s really cowardly. He doesn’t even dare to face Mu Zidao and student Xianfeng!”

“They are on completely different levels!”

When the surrounding girls saw this scene, they revealed a mocking expression, especially the girl who posted on the Forum.

She was even more excited as she kept taking pictures with her phone. Her face was filled with disdain!

“We didn’t come to look for you because of some famous person in the school or some Prince Charming. It’s meaningless!”

Mu Zidao saw Wang Xian turn around with a slight frown, he stared at him with a condescending gaze. “Today in the Martial Arts Club, you embarrassed our junior brother and even claimed to be the Dragon King of the Dragon Gate. You are a force in the jianghu. Since you dare to cause trouble in our territory, if we, the Ming Wang Immortal sect, don’t show our respect, everyone will think that we are a coward.”

“Your strength is not weak, at least not below the Dan stage. We came to look for you with no other intentions. Since you dare to cause trouble in our Ming Wang Immortal Sect’s territory, then let’s have a spar. Loser, if you see the other party in the future, get lost. If you see our Ming Wang Immortal sect’s disciples, Lower Your Head!”

His indifferent voice sounded in the surroundings and entered everyone’s ears. It was obvious that he wanted everyone to hear it.

“How domineering, how domineering. Student Mu Zidao is simply too handsome.”

“This is the demeanor of a disciple of an immortal sect. If only I could marry into an immortal sect!”

“Wang Xian is also a martial artist. His strength isn’t weak? However, it’s obvious that he can’t be compared to Mu Zidao. Furthermore, he can’t be compared to the Ming Wang Immortal Sect!”

When the crowd heard Mu Zidao’s words, all the girls revealed looks of admiration. There were also some girls who had helpless expressions.

The high and Mighty Immortal sect. Senior Wang Xian was going to be in trouble this time.

“Your territory?”

When Wang Xian heard his words, his eyes flickered slightly.

The territory of the Ming Wang Immortal Sect? In the past, everyone in Jiang City knew whose territory it was. Now, someone actually said that it was their territory!

“Our territory. This is the territory of our Ming Wang Immortal sect. How dare you bully our junior brother in our territory? Come, let’s spar. Let me see how capable you are!”

Mu Zidao raised his head slightly and stared at Wang Xian with disdain.

“This is not your territory!”

Wang Xian stared at Mu Zidao and said slowly. A hint of coldness flashed across his eyes.

“Senior Wang Xian, this is not your era anymore. Do you think it’s still the same as before? I heard that senior Wang Xian used your RV to crush four multimillion-dollar sports cars. At that time, Jiang City University was your territory. Now...”. Hehe

The enchanting girl next to him crossed her arms and said with a face full of mockery.

Her voice was very loud and could be heard by the surrounding people.

“Oh? So only by crushing the opponent’s car with a luxury car can you say that this is our territory?”

“However, this method is indeed impressive!”

At this moment, obviously Feng heard the words of the girl next to him. His face was full of smiles. He moved his body and got into the puppet chariot.

“Then I shall use this senior’s method to prove that this is our territory. Haha!”

Ming Feng laughed out loud. The war chariot suddenly let out a loud roar.

“What is student Ming Feng trying to do?”

“He is trying to use the war chariot to hit Wang Xian’s chariot. The war chariot he is sitting on is a war chariot. Even a tank is not as tough as the war chariot he is sitting on!”

The surrounding students were shocked and looked at him in astonishment.

“So this is the proof!”

Mu Zidao’s face was filled with mockery as he watched obviously Feng get into the war chariot and start it up.

Wang Xian stood at the side and didn’t say anything. He looked at him coldly.

Boom

At this moment, the war chariot emitted a faint golden glow. With a starting distance of at least 300 to 400 kilometers, the war chariot headed straight for the RV at the side.

The puppet war chariot was only half the height of the RV, but its terrifying hardness and strength directly cut the RV in half at the waist.

There was no trace on the puppet war chariot.

Mo Qinglong, who had been sitting in the RV, had a hint of killing intent in his eyes.

However, the Dragon King didn’t ask him to make a move, and he didn’t make a move either.

However, Tian Gou, who was lying on the chariot, had a fierce look in his eyes as he slowly walked out.
