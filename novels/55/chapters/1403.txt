Chapter 1404: Judgement 1404 began

With a loud laugh, a blue figure appeared.

The entire sky was incomparably blue, as if a deep ocean had appeared out of thin air in the sky.

When they felt that terrifying aura, everyone was stunned.

They raised their heads and looked at the blue-clothed old man, their faces slightly dazed.

This figure that had suddenly appeared, his strength seemed to be...

“Water steward!”

The young city lord was slightly stunned when he saw this figure and shouted in astonishment.

“Haha, Young City Lord, Hello!”

The blue figure laughed loudly and looked at the young city lord. He shouted with a smile on his face.

“Water steward, you... you...”

The young city Lord’s eyes were burning as he stared at the old man. He felt the terrifying aura and recalled what he had said just now.

Ever since he broke through!

Broke through!

In the past, the water steward was an expert at the fourth level of the profound void tier. If he broke through, he would naturally be at the fifth level of the profound void tier!

“Water steward, you have actually reached my father’s realm!”

His eyes were filled with surprise and excitement as he muttered.

“Yes, Young City Lord, I broke through by a fluke!”

The old man smiled and stared down. A faint smile appeared on his face, and his voice was loud and clear as he shouted, “I am the steward of Xiaoyao City. How dare you act so arrogantly in Xiaoyao City!”

“There is no need for the city lord to take action. I will take care of you!”

As he spoke, terrifying waves gathered and rolled behind him!

“The water butler is the water butler from five years ago. I didn’t expect... I didn’t expect him to break through!”

“Oh my God, our Xiaoyao City actually has a top-tier insightful void Tier 5 powerhouse hidden in it. Moreover, he is the butler of the city lord of Xiaoyao City!”

“Haha, two Profound Void Tier 5 experts, with the water butler and the Xiao Yao City Lord around, we still need to be afraid of 300 profound void tier experts?”

“There’s no need for the city lord to make a move? Haha, the City Lord is simply too domineering. Who would have thought that the water butler who disappeared five years ago would actually break through to the profound void tier 5!”

“There are two profound void tier 5 experts, so what if there are 300 profound void tier experts!”

However, at this moment, the experts from the influential families of Xiao Yao City revealed excited expressions.

They originally thought that it would be a Peerless Battle of life and death, but they didn’t expect that a peerless expert that could rival the city lord would suddenly appear on their side.

This battle, they were filled with confidence.

100% confidence!

Even if the opponent had 300 profound void martial experts, what was there to be afraid of?

“Kill them all. I want everyone to know that even if 300 void interpretation experts dare to offend our Xiao Yao City, they will all die here!”

“Not a single one can escape. Judgement!”

The city lord floated in the sky and looked down at everyone.

An intense king’s aura surged out from his body.

“Not a single one can be spared!”

“So what if we have 300 void interpretation realms? We’ll die in our Xiaoyao City today!” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Haha, destroy them, destroy the dragon-phoenix dynasty, and destroy that arrogant fellow!”

The experts of the eight dynasties and the experts of the Xiaoyao city were filled with confidence as they unsheathed their weapons one by one.

The uneasiness and fear from before had completely disappeared!

So what if he had 300 void interpretation?

“Haha, Good, good. Two fifth-level void interpretation. This way, things will be interesting!”

At this moment, Wang Xian who was standing below looked at the smiling old man in blue.

Looking at the confident and arrogant city lord of Xiaoyao City, he also laughed out loud.

“Today, destroy Xiaoyao City!”

He roared, “Do it!”

All the members of the Dragon Palace started to move.

“You’re courting death!”

The blue-clothed elder who was floating in the sky had a mocking look in his eyes.

He had sensed all the 300 insightful void martial artists below just now.

Most of them were at the second level of the insightful void martial artist realm, and there was only one at the fourth level of the insightful void martial artist realm.

If he wanted to kill them with the strength of the fifth level of the insightful void martial artist realm, he could do it even if there were many of them.

Even if there were many of them, killing one or two hundred of them would not be a problem.

As for the remaining void interpretation experts, the experts in Xiaoyao city would be enough to deal with them!

“The one who wants to die is you!”

However, just as he was about to make a move, a cold voice directly entered his mind.

Soon after, he felt a black and white space suddenly cover him.

This shocked the blue-clothed old man, and a shocked expression appeared on his face.

“Who is it?”

In an instant, he felt as if he had entered a domain of light and darkness.

In the surroundings, half of the darkness and half of the light faintly emitted energy that made his heart palpitate.

“The person who killed you!”

A cold voice sounded throughout the entire space.

“What? What’s going on?”

At this moment, the experts from Xiaoyao City and the seven or eight dynasties were completely stunned!

In the sky, darkness and light suddenly appeared. A special space directly covered the old man in blue.

“Mayor of Xiaoyao City, let me see your strength!”

“Let’s see if you can protect Xiaoyao City!”

“Roar Roar!”

At this moment, Wang Xian leaped down from the ground under everyone’s horrified gaze.

He transformed into a terrifying divine dragon that was 50 meters long. A dragon’s roar reverberated throughout the entire Xiaoyao city.

The dragon scales that were emitting bright rays under the sunlight and the majestic dragon head swayed its huge body as it attacked the master of Xiaoyao City in the sky.

“Roar!”

“Do you think that our Dragon Palace doesn’t have any experts at level five of the Seethrough Realm?”

Wang Xian stared coldly at the mayor of Xiaoyao City, whose face was filled with astonishment.

“This...”

Sensing the terrifying aura coming from Wang Xian, his expression changed drastically.

Looking at the black and white special space in the sky, he had a bad premonition.

“Roar! Roar! Kill! Do they really think that we don’t have any experts at level five of the Seethrough Realm?”

“Kill everyone’s enemies!”

Ao Qitian and Mou Zesen roared, and the three hundred profound void martial artists started to move.

At this moment, all the family experts and dynasty experts of Xiaoyao City were shocked.

There were only seventy to eighty profound void martial artists in total.

Facing three hundred, even if there were more fourth-level profound void martial artists than the Dragon Palace, they were still insignificant in front of this huge number.

Especially since the Dragon Palace did not have a first-level profound void martial artist.

As for this group of profound void martial artists, there were around 50 to 60 first-level profound void martial artists.

How to fight?

“Kill!”

All the members behind the Dragon Palace started to move.

This time, there were not only 300 profound void martial artists, there were also around 1,000 half-step profound void martial artists.

With their strength, they could kill one profound void martial artist with at most 10 of them, and they did not even need 10 of them.

Under these thousand members of the Dragon Palace, those below the insightful void realm were almost instantly killed.

The terrifying power of the Dragon Palace began to move.

The first to bear the brunt was the young city lord who stood in the center.

When he saw the water steward in the sky covered in a layer of darkness and light, when he saw his father being attacked by that terrifying fifty-meter-long creature.

When he saw 300 terrifying insightful emptiness realm experts charging over.

He was completely stunned!
