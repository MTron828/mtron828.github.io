3491 Failure and future of 2490

In the Hundred Cities Alliance, all the members of the Dragon Palace who sneaked into the city were attacked.

In a short span of ten hours, more than 500 disciples of the Dragon Palace were killed.

When this news reached Wang Xian, his eyes flickered slightly.

The Hundred Cities Alliance had the ability to detect those with the bloodline of the Divine Dragon.

Wang Xian was not sure if he could detect the poisonous horned dragon species.

If he could, the poisonous horned dragon species would not be able to parasitize and destroy a city in the same way as before.

He was afraid that he would have to rely on his own strength next!

However, everything was not settled yet. Wang Xian needed to test it out with the poisonous horned dragon species.

He immediately contacted the eight-limbed demon fiend and the rest and asked them to send a few poisonous horned dragon species to Muyang city.

Before that, he would order the poisonous horned dragon species to parasitize a few people from Muyang city.

The eight-limbed Demon Fiend received the order and carried it out immediately.

Wang Xian waited quietly in Muyang city.

Ten days later, the poisonous horned dragon species sent by the eight-limbed demon Fiend and the rest had arrived.

During these ten days, the Hundred Cities Alliance had also fallen into a state of peace.

The residents of the Hundred Cities Alliance had left. The cities were no longer as lively and glorious as before.

The slightly desolate cities caused some shops to close. As time passed, the number of people in the Hundred Cities Alliance would decrease.

After Wang Xian received the news from the eight-limbed demon fiend, he immediately went to the position at the city gate.

He entered a shop and pretended to be looking at something.

At the location outside the city, the four figures who flew out of the city turned back once again.

They exchanged a glance and flew into the city.

These were the poisonous horned dragon seeds that were parasitic on the disciples of Muyang City.

They entered the city and walked forward while chatting and laughing.

“HM?”

At the same time, in the city leader’s mansion, within a towering tree, a light-reflecting dragon eye was in the center.

At this moment, the light-reflecting dragon eye suddenly lit up, and below, two old men immediately opened their eyes.

In front of the light-reflecting Dragon Eye, a scene appeared.

Within the scene, four figures were walking within Mu Yang City.

“Their bodies contain a strong godly dragon aura, and they are at the universe knight level. They are courting death!”

The faces of the two old men were filled with killing intent. One of the old men moved and disappeared instantly.

He flew toward the East Gate of the city at a terrifying speed.

Wang Xian was in a shop and was constantly sensing the situation of the poisonous horned dragon species.

After following the poisonous horned dragon species for about ten minutes, he suddenly sensed a wave of energy attacking the four poisonous horned dragon species.

This energy was not something that the poisonous horned dragon species could react to.

A level one master of the universe with combat strength.

“Return to the Dragon Palace immediately!”

Wang Xian sensed this energy and immediately sent a voice transmission to the poisonous horned dragon species. At the same time, he started to move.

Compared to the figure that was charging over, Wang Xian’s speed was even more terrifying.

Bang

His figure immediately disappeared from where he was. In the next moment, his palm had already penetrated the body of the level one master of the universe.

“Buzz!”

Following that, without any hesitation, he instantly disappeared!

“Ah!”

A terrifying aura flashed and disappeared. The entire city gate was instantly turned into ruins.

Terrified screams rang out. Some of the residents of Muyang city nearby let out terrified screams.

Some of the more cowardly ones left in an instant.

Sou Sou Souρ

At this moment, the array glowed brightly, and one figure after another flew over at a terrifying speed.

Five figures arrived in the sky above the ruins, their expressions abnormally ugly.

This was because a universe ruler Level 1 warrior had fallen!

Hu

All of them took a deep breath, their expressions gloomy.

What happened in Muyang City wasn’t a big deal, even the news of a universe ruler Level 1 warrior being killed wasn’t leaked.

However, this matter still caused a huge commotion in the AI.

“Liang Liang, the Hundred City Alliance has completely fallen into the flames of war. If this continues, who would dare to stay there?”

“Hehe, they deserve it. They hunted the disciples of the Dragon Palace and were crazily avenged by the Dragon Palace. Now, they are finished!”

“If this continues, all the people of the Hundred Cities Alliance will run away. The neutral forces will become a joke!”

Countless people discussed on the universe’s AI.

They were worried about the future of the Hundred Cities Alliance.

The current Hundred Cities Alliance was no longer a neutral force in the past!

The Dragon Palace had caused them to fall into a passive position. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

…

Wang Xian didn’t pay too much attention to the matters on the universal AI and the Hundred Cities Alliance.

However, what happened just now wasn’t good news for the Dragon Palace.

“The Hundred Cities Alliance already has a method to detect the bloodline of the Divine Dragon. Even the poisonous horned dragon seed can not enter the city. The previous method is no longer viable!”

Wang Xian looked at the eight-limbed demonic fiend and the rest and said.

“HMM?”

This made the two of them frown slightly.

Now, after the eight-limbed demonic fiend absorbed the energy from the demonic skeleton, its strength had already broken through to the level-two combat strength of a Master of the universe.

With such strength, they initially thought that they could easily destroy a city. Now, it seemed that it was no longer possible.

“From now on, the eight-limbed Demon Fiend, you poisonous horned dragons can move freely, ao Yao!”

As Wang Xian spoke, he looked at Ao Yao who was beside him.

“Your subordinate is here!”

Ao Yao replied immediately.

“Bring some men to surround the cities of the Hundred Cities Alliance. From now on, the thorned dragon species will carry out mass assassinations of the disciples and powerhouses of the Hundred Cities Alliance. You must be careful!”

Wang Xian instructed.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Ao Yao replied immediately.

Last time and this time, the Dragon Palace master wanted to upgrade the venom horned dragon seed and thorned dragon seed.

Currently, there were five thorned dragon seeds with the combat strength of A Level 1 universe dominator. There were already more than 80 peak universe knights.

There were even more at other levels.

If they were to spread out to hunt down the disciples and powerhouses of the Hundred Cities Alliance, it would definitely bring a great disaster to the Hundred Cities Alliance.

“Be careful. The other party has many tricks up his sleeves.”

Wang Xian instructed.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Ao Yao and the rest nodded.

“Alright!”

He nodded and flew out.

His target this time was still the land of the demonic bones. In the land of blood plasma, he would be able to get the ancestral tree to produce blood refinement fruits. He needed to accumulate more blood refinement fruits so that more purebred divine dragons could be born in the Dragon Palace in the future.

Purebred divine dragons were the foundation of the Divine Dragon lineage. Only purebred divine dragons had the chance to give birth to other powerful dragon species and have the chance to mutate and become Frost Divine Dragons, Bone Dragons, dual-attribute divine dragons, and even five-attribute divine dragons.

As for the Hundred Cities Alliance, he would take revenge bit by bit!

When he had another breakthrough, it would be the time for the Great War to truly erupt!
