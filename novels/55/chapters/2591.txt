2592 2592: Blood for blood

Tooth for tooth, blood for blood!

Prime Minister Gui didn’t expect that the ninth-grade sky sect members of the Sky Mountain Sword sect would be so crazy!

It was so horrifying!

The Dragon Palace only occupied the ocean, but they had destroyed the entire planet!

“Since you want to kill them, I’ll kill them with you!”

With bloodshot eyes, Prime Minister Gui passed the Order of assassination directly to all the strange demons!

At the same time, Prime Minister Gui immediately took out his artificial intelligence and issued a statement in the name of the Dragon Palace and the Dragon Star!

“The territory of the Dragon Palace only occupies the ocean. The humans on land don’t belong to the Dragon Palace. Since you have destroyed billions of lives, don’t blame the Dragon Palace for returning the favor with blood!”

After the statement, Prime Minister Gui immediately flew to a planet in the sky of the Dragon Star!

“Hua!”

“What’s going on? The ninth-grade sky sect of the Sky Mountain Sword sect went to another planet in the Dragon Palace? They destroyed the entire planet? This... This is too cruel!”

“The Dragon Palace seems to come from a remote place. The Dragon Palace is the strongest there, but it seems that the dragon palace only occupies the ocean, and the land belongs to other forces. Could it be that the sky of the Dragon Palace of the Sky Mountain Sword sect of the ninth-grade Sky Mountain Sword sect destroyed the planet?”

The attack of the six forces of the ninth-grade Sky Mountain Sword sect and the Sky Mountain Sword sect caught the attention of everyone in the entire southern star system!

Everyone was slightly shocked when they saw the information released by the Dragon Palace!

“Hahaha, it seems that they are really angry. Now that they know the consequences of offending us, what did they do earlier?”

On the planet below the ninth-grade Sky Mountain Sword sect’s domain, the expert of the Sky Mountain Sword sect roared coldly!

A hundred thousand years ago, their sword king had single-handedly destroyed several vital planets. His warning had shocked everyone in the southern star system!

This time, they would do the same thing and warn all the scoundrels!

“Hahaha, good kill, good kill. Anyone who dares to kill an expert of the Sky Mountain Sword sect will be exterminated!”

“Kill them! Destroy all their planets! Leave No one alive!”

“Kill, Kill, kill! This is how it should be. If you provoke the ninth-grade heaven sect, you will have to pay the price of death. Remember, don’t have anything to do with the Dragon Palace in your next life!”

“Humph! Anyone who offends the Sky Mountain Sword sect will have to pay a heavy price. A hundred thousand years ago, the Sword King had a sword and a star. It seems that some people have forgotten about it after a long time!”

Many disciples and citizens of the Ninth-grade Sky sect of the Sky Mountain Sword sect on the AI were supportive of the sect’s actions!

They were the citizens of the ninth-grade sky sect of the Sky Mountain Sword sect. The strength of their sect also gave them a sense of glory!

If someone dared to provoke them and the other party was eliminated, they would naturally gloat and support them with both hands!

This was the consequence of offending them!

“Receive the order, attack immediately, kill!”

“Receive the order, attack immediately, kill!”

“Slaughter begins!”

Just as everyone in the star South Galaxy was shocked, just as the warriors of the Sky Mountain Sword sect were getting excited, the upper level 9 ai from the Sky Mountain Sword sect was supporting them!

40,000 strange demons received the order!

“I only need three undying godly monarchs on this planet, their power is weaker than mine, within a minute, I can destroy the entire planet!”

On a planet of the Sky Mountain Sword sect, a strange demon floated in space, his body emitting a berserk killing aura!

“Eternal night descends!”

He floated in space and roared!

“Rumble Rumble Rumble!”

In an instant, terrifying darkness laws gushed out from one side of his body. Substantial darkness laws enveloped the planet below!

“What’s going on?”

On the planet, everyone’s expression changed slightly when they saw the sudden darkness!

“Extreme Day Light!”

He roared again, causing half of his body to shoot out dazzling light laws!

The entire sky above the planet was instantly covered by eternal night and Extreme Day!

All the living beings on the planet raised their heads, their faces filled with shock!

“Not good, we have enemies!”

The three undying emperors on the planet had a huge change in expression, flying straight up into the sky!

“Chaos descends, explode, blood for blood!”

The Strange Demon roared madly, his cold words entering everyone’s ears!

At the same time, the terrifying darkness and white light clashed, releasing a terrifying explosion!

“Rumble Rumble Rumble!”

Below, the entire planet was affected by the huge shockwave, in an instant, the planet was reduced by 10% !

With Strange Demon’s strength, he could destroy the planet in a minute and turn it into dust!

“Not good!”

“Immediately request the sect elders to help!”

...

An undying god King was shocked and immediately roared!

Just a moment ago, they were gloating over the Dragon Palace’s destruction, however in the next moment, their planet suffered a terrifying attack! L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

In fact, their planet might even be destroyed!

“We’ve already informed them that the sect elders are rushing over, let’s stop him, stop him!”

An undying godly king beside roared!

At this time, the other planets of the ninth grade Sky sect and Sky Mountain Sword sect were also attacked and assassinated!

However, the good thing was that it was difficult for an eternal God Lord to destroy a planet!

Furthermore, most of the planets had an undying godly king guarding them, and the strong ones were all taken away by the Dragon King, so destroying a planet was very difficult!

However, destroying the planets was difficult, and assassination was very easy for the strange demon!

On the 800 to 900 planets, during these few hours, the strange demon and the others had already investigated a lot of the situation!

This time, they were completely targeting the disciples of the Sky Mountain Sword sect and the Ninth Grade Heaven sect!

...

The core disciples of the Sky Mountain Sword sect might only be in the tens of millions, but the ordinary disciples had tens of billions!

A group of strange demons crazily assassinated their ordinary disciples!

As long as they were disciples of the Sky Mountain Sword sect and the ninth-grade sky sect, even if they were at the godly state, they would be assassinated!

Especially in the academies and sub-sects established by the two big forces, they were the main targets of the strange demons!

After the order to kill was given, the feast began!

As for the atrocity of the ninth-grade sky sect of the Sky Mountain Sword sect, they could only kill to stop the killing!

“Ah Ah Ah!”

Even if there weren’t even a hundred strange demons on a planet, they could still create quite a bit of chaos when they tried to assassinate them!

This was especially true for the undying god King level strange demons. Darkness and light enveloped an area, and all the ninth-grade sky sect and Sky Mountain Sword sect disciples in the area were killed!

In an instant, the entire Sky Mountain Sword sect and ninth-grade sky sect fell into chaos!

“Bang!”

“What’s going on? Didn’t we say to be vigilant during the war? Why are we still being attacked by the Dragon Palace?”

When the news reached the upper echelons of the two forces, everyone’s expressions changed and they roared angrily!

All the forces had sent out 70% of their experts, and the remaining 30% were to defend their own planets to prevent the Dragon Palace from ambushing them!

However, the news of the planets being attacked and their disciples being crazily killed spread!

This made the ninth-grade sky sect and the Sky Mountain Sword sect extremely furious!
