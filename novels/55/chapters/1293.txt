Chapter 1294: In 1295, he had six wives

“I didn’t expect you to be this kind of person. It’s all my fault for being blind to believe you!”

A miserable and indignant voice came out of the woman’s mouth. He stared at Wang Xian with a face full of anger. He looked as weak as he could be.

He was as miserable as he could be.

Wang Xian looked at the woman who suddenly accused him in her grief and indignation. He frowned slightly. He couldn’t understand what this woman was up to?

What benefits could he gain by framing him?

What kind of blow could he cause to long Xiaotian?

Wang Xian looked at the woman on the ground with an expressionless face. A hint of coldness flashed across his eyes.

From the moment this woman mentioned the second prince, he knew that it was definitely long Xiaotian’s brothers who framed him.

However, he didn’t understand how a woman could hurt him by framing him?

“Eh? Isn’t that the Fox clan’s Fox Charm? This... This young man actually abandoned the fox charm. This is somewhat inhumane!”

“The Fox clan’s women have always been extremely loyal. There are many young masters who want to marry the Fox clan’s women. Unfortunately, their horizons are too high. This young man actually abandoned the Fox Charm!”

“That’s right, that’s right. This young man seems to be the Light Dragon Dynasty’s long Xiaotian’s brother. He seems to have two profound void tier first level fierce beasts!”

“TSK, so what? He’s rather powerful. who here has a weak background? How could this fellow do such a thing? It’s really embarrassing!”

Some people around looked over. When they saw this scene, all of them pointed at Wang Xian with disdain.

“Don’t court death. I don’t even know you. It’s best for you to disappear from my sight as soon as possible!” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Wang Xian frowned and said coldly as he listened to the discussions of the people around him.

“Wang Xian, I didn’t expect you to be so heartless. You’ve been with Mei'er for so long and now you’ve turned your back on her. You’re too shameless. Mei'er treats you so well!”

“That’s right. Mei'er often praises you in front of us. I didn’t expect you to turn your back on her now. It’s a waste for her to hand everything she has to you!”

At this moment, two voices filled with anger rang out. Two figures walked over to him and helped the fox seductress up from the ground.

“HMPH, how can there be such a scumbag? He actually said that he didn’t want to die and that he should just disappear from my sight. Such a man should be exterminated!”

“That’s right. A woman with Fox bloodline is extremely loyal. This scumbag actually did such a thing. Damn it, damn it!”

When the surrounding girls heard the words of the two girls, they also cursed at Wang Xian angrily.

“Get Out! People like him should get out!”

Some of the young men also shouted at Wang Xian with cold faces.

Everyone around had a strong background. Even if some of them knew that Wang Xian was long Xiaotian’s brother, there were still people who refused to give him face.

Wang Xian looked at the thousands of people around him who were looking at him. Many of them started to criticize him and frowned slightly.

“How is it, brother Jiang Chuan? Are you satisfied now?”

Not far away, the 42nd Prince looked at this scene with a smug expression and said to Jiang Chuan.

“Haha, Good, good. Beautiful. It’s really beautiful. This is the effect I wanted!”

Jiang Chuan could not help but laugh when he saw this scene and gave the forty-second prince a thumbs up.

This was exactly what he wanted. He wanted to destroy that kid’s reputation. If that was the case, Zhang Fengying would never get close to such a scumbag.

“Come, let’s go and take a look!”

He stood up happily and walked forward.

The group of princes followed behind. They looked at Prince No. 42 with a smile on their faces. “Brother No. 42, I didn’t expect you to have so many beauties. Is it still useful?”

“Hehe, brothers, I have sacrificed a lot here!”

Prince No. 42 smiled faintly. The five of them laughed at the same time.

They did not expect that Jiang Chuan would be willing to take action to get rid of that kid because of this matter. This was a pleasant surprise to them.

“Eh?”

Long Xiaotian and Zhang Fengying who were not far away frowned slightly when they saw the incident with Wang Xian.

“Eh? Fengying, isn’t that your friend? What’s going on?”

The lady beside her looked at this scene in astonishment.

Zhang Fengying frowned slightly and walked over directly. Xiao Ya who was beside her immediately followed behind.

“Look over there, that’s Luo Hongjuan. A woman with Fox bloodline is extremely loyal. She would always carry her Luo Hongjuan with her. I didn’t expect that guy to throw her away!”

“That’s true. Sigh, it’s such a pity for Miss Foxy. I feel sorry for him for meeting such a man!”

“Yeah, a guy like that should be eaten by fierce beasts!”

When more people gathered around, a lady suddenly pointed at Luo Hongjuan who was on the ground and said.

Luo Hongjuan was the fresh blood left behind by the lady during her first time. A lady with Fox bloodline would always carry her with her.

When they saw Luo Hongjuan, they also saw the miserable look on Hu Mei’s face.

With the witnesses and evidence gathered, everyone stared at Wang Xian angrily.

“What’s going on, brother Wang Xian?”

Long Xiaotian walked over hurriedly. He frowned as he looked at Wang Xian. Then, he looked at the Vixen beside him. His eyes were filled with doubt.

“I don’t know her!”

Wang Xian looked at long Xiaotian and said directly.

“You don’t Know Her?”

Long Xiaotian frowned slightly. He stared at the vixen and said, “I will investigate this matter clearly. If you are the one who slandered my brother, you, including the Fox clan, will have to wait and see!”

Long Xiaotian’s domineering words caused Linghu Mei’s face to turn pale.

Some of the surrounding youths and women also frowned when they heard his words.

However, they did not dare to speak. There was almost no one in the area who could match the Light Dragon Empire’s strength.

“Long Xiaotian, you are a little immoral. A woman was abandoned by your brother, and you actually said that? Are you using your power to oppress others?”

However, at this moment, Jiang Chuan’s voice was heard. When he saw this scene, a trace of a smile flashed across his eyes as he said faintly.

“That’s right, you can’t bully a girl like that.”

“That’s right, that’s right!”

The few girls next to him were somewhat afraid of Long Xiaotian’s power, and they echoed in a low voice.

“Hehe, what kind of person are you? What kind of friends do you have? Second brother, don’t embarrass us!”

As soon as Jiang Chuan finished speaking, Long Xiaochen and the others walked over with smiles on their faces and said loudly.

“I naturally know the character of my friend. I also know the character of my brother. That’s why I said that someone might have deliberately framed him!”

Long Xiaotian saw them and frowned slightly. He narrowed his eyes and said.

“Haha, deliberately framed? We will waste time to frame your friend for such a thing. What loss will it bring to you? What Benefit will it bring to us? We won’t be so bored.”

The corner of Long Xiaochen’s mouth slightly curled up as he said with a face full of ridicule.
