Translator: 5496903

Divine Dragon’s fiery tail.

With Wang Xian’s fifty-meter-long figure, he used the divine dragon’s fiery tail. The dragon’s tail, which was dozens of meters long, was like a terrifying volcano as it charged straight at Ling Zilin.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

Ling Zilin’s face turned blood-red when he saw Wang Xian’s terrifying dragon tail. He raised his two one-meter-long tusks and met Wang Xian’s dragon tail head-on.

The two tusks were imbued with the power of thunder and lightning.

Boom

The two terrifying powers collided with each other and created a shockwave. Ling Zilin’s four-meter-long body was sent flying backward.

A purple trail of thunder and lightning streaked across the sky.

Roar! Roar

Roar! Roar

Ling Zilin, who had been suppressed all this while, shook its body. Streams of blood flowed out from the wound on its abdomen after the collision.

It lifted its hooves and stepped gently into the air.

“Ta ta ta ta!”

A voice that sounded like the galloping of tens of thousands of horses sounded again. It stared at Wang Xian coldly and opened its mouth. Its two one-meter-long fangs made it look extremely ferocious.

Wang Xian swayed his body. His proud dragon head stared at Ling Zilin coldly. His eyes were filled with fighting spirit.

“Ta ta ta ta!”

Ling Zilin’s front hooves stomped on the air once again. The concentrated sound spread to the surroundings.

“Crackle crackle!”

Following the stomp of its front hooves, streaks of terrifying purple lightning quickly gathered under the two front hooves.

Two balls of lightning gathered under the left and right front hooves.

“This is? is he going to use his virtual image to attack?”

Wang Xian was slightly stunned. The transformation of his supernatural ability into a virtual image was the symbol of an insightful emptiness realm expert. It was also the strongest attack technique of an insightful emptiness realm expert.

Looking at the dark purple lightning gathering under its front hooves, a solemn expression appeared on his face.

“Roar!”

Wang Xian let out a soft roar and a strong light shot out from his eyes. “Then I will use you to test the power of a dual-attribute supernatural ability!”

He opened his mouth and a terrifying dragon flame shot out directly. Following that, the earthen yellow energy converged.

Roar

The flames and the earthen yellow energy converged and slowly rose into the sky.

Boom

A gigantic flaming mountain peak that was as big as a mountain appeared above his head. The Flaming Mountain Peak was emitting white smoke.

Slowly, the entire flaming mountain peak erupted. Thick lava was rolling.

Fire Territory!

It was more appropriate to describe it as fire lava soil.

The entire fire territory was about 1,000 meters in size and about 200 meters in height.

The fire territory stood on top of Wang Xian’s head. Wang Xian stared at Ling Zilin coldly.

“Roar!”

Ling Zilin stared at the fire territory in the sky, and an irritable look appeared on his face.

Dong! Dong! Dong

At this moment, Ling Zilin started to move. Its front hooves stepped on the void and attacked Wang Xian directly.

It stepped out quickly and produced a Dong Dong Sound.

Lightning was densely packed under its feet. It was as if the void would shatter every time it stepped on it.

Ling Zilin was like purple lightning as it stomped heavily on the world.

Wang Xian looked at Ling Zilin who was charging forward relentlessly. The fire territory above his head trembled.

Boom

The mountain-like fire territory smashed directly at Ling Zilin.

The moment both parties came into contact, a terrifying energy collision shook the surrounding dozens of kilometers.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom

At this moment, Ling Zilin stepped into the void. His front hooves landed heavily on the fire territory.

The fire territory was like an erupting mountain of flames. Countless lava chunks that were dozens of meters in size shot down.

“Bang, Bang, Bang!”

The lava chunks shot onto Ling Zilin’s body and were blocked by his two tusks.

A portion of the lava chunks shattered when they landed on his body.

Ling Zilin was like a ferocious beast that trampled on the world. His front hooves kept on stomping towards the fire territory.

“Roar!”

He roared angrily. The purple lightning on his front hooves doubled in size. His terrifying strength stomped on the fire territory and stomped towards Wang Xian rapidly.

The lava on the fire territory fell towards the ground, creating a deep pit that was a hundred meters wide.

“What a powerful dharma idol. Under the stomp of its front hooves, even the two-elemental spells were destroyed!”

Wang Xian stared at Ling Zilin, who was attacking him. His two huge dragon claws met it head-on.

“Roar!”

Ling Zilin did not show any signs of weakness. Its front hooves stepped on the fire territory and headed towards Wang Xian again.

Boom

Two attacks of disproportionate size. Wang Xian’s golden dragon claws collided heavily with Ling Zilin’s front hooves.

Crack! Crack

In an instant, Wang Xian could hear the sound of bones breaking.

Roar

Ling Zilin did not feel good either. He destroyed Wang Xian’s dual-attribute supernatural ability and collided with him with all his strength. Streams of blood flowed out from his front hooves.

Wang Xian’s huge body flew backward and flew 50 meters away.

His two dragon claws had become deformed.

“Hiss, as expected of a ferocious beast at the insightful void level. Its strength is terrifying. However, this is only the beginning!”

Wang Xian revealed a faint smile as his body shimmered with a blue light.

Divine ability, water spirit!

Under the repair of the water spirit, Wang Xian’s dragon claws recovered rapidly.

“Continue!”

Wang Xian moved his body and swung his 50-meter-long body towards the Spirit Zilin.

His abdomen was injured and his front hooves were injured. The Spirit Zilin, who had just cast his Dharma Idol, was furious when he saw Wang Xian coming at him.

He pounced towards Wang Xian and his two fangs emitted bolts of lightning.

Every hair on his body stood up like lightning needles.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

Wang Xian clawed out with his dragon claws. His dragon tail swept across and his dragon head bit down.

After a combination of supernatural powers and dual-attribute combat techniques, it entered the most primitive competition. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Wang Xian was not afraid of the battle between Ling Zilin and Wang Xian.

In the sky, the battle between two terrifying giant beasts caused the entire sky to tremble.

Wang Xian was not afraid of the battle between his physical body. With his huge figure and powerful defense and strength, he was able to completely suppress Ling Zilin.

“Roar! Roar!”

After more than ten minutes of intense battle, the Ling Zilin, who was completely at the bottom, let out a low roar. It was injured all over and its eyes were filled with fear.

“Roar!”

Its body moved and it fled into the distance.

“You want to escape?”

Wang Xian’s eyes were cold. His body shook and the area within two kilometers was covered by seawater.

“Water tomb!”

He let out a soft shout and the combination skill appeared around him.

“HMM? The combination skill unleashed with the body of the divine dragon is obviously much stronger!”

Wang Xian looked at Ling Zilin who was instantly entangled and revealed an excited expression.

“I’ll use you to practice my skills!”

He moved his body and released another combination skill. He also tried to combine new skills one after another!

“Roar! Roar!”

Ling Zilin let out an unyielding roar. His speed was restrained and he could only turn around to meet Wang Xian.
