Chapter 960: 0961, the terrifying freshman

Translator: 549690339

Boom! Boom

When the Zhou Chamber of Commerce’s carriage arrived, Wang Xian had already killed over 300 ghost-faced crabs!

Hiss

Even though they had witnessed Wang Xian’s strength, when they saw the two to three meters long ghost-faced crabs at the bottom of the mountain peak, they were shocked.

This was especially so for Zhou Han and Jin Liuyan. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

There were more than 300 ghost-faced crabs. The weakest among them was at level four extraordinary. Any one of them could easily kill the two of them.

However, he only used a few minutes just now.

“When Dao Hen was killed back then, it’s very likely that he didn’t rely on any treasures. If that’s the case, this is too terrifying!”

Jin Liuyan’s eyes were sparkling as she stared at Wang Xian. She was slightly lost in her thoughts.

Such a rare prodigy would definitely be famous across the continent in the future.

“The ghost-faced crab is a ferocious beast unique to wind arrow mountain. It is also the most popular delicacy. The value of the ghost-faced crab far surpasses that of an ordinary ferocious beast!”

Father Zhou said with a twinkle in his eyes.

“Is that so?”

Wang Xian’s figure moved and landed at the foot of the mountain peak. “Let’s take a break. It’s a good time to taste this ghost-faced crab!”

“Sure!”

Everyone said with smiles on their faces.

After witnessing Wang Xian’s terrifying strength, they felt that it was very safe to stay in the wild. They were totally in the mood to taste the delicacies.

The workers’faces lit up as well. With their status, they could never afford to eat such precious ferocious beast meat.

“Come, let me make it for you!”

Father Zhou rolled up his sleeves and walked over with a smile on his face.

Wang Xian nodded and took a rest at the side.

The two girls also walked down cheerfully and helped to deal with the ghost-faced crabs one by one.

“Hurry up, we are in a hurry!”

At this moment, the caravan behind them had also arrived at Wind Arrow Mountain.

Compared to a few days ago, everyone in the caravan was in a sorry state.

The dozen of people walking at the front were a completely unfamiliar mercenary group.

They wore gorgeous armor and looked extraordinary.

At the back, one of the original nineteen chambers of Commerce was missing.

Of the three hundred or so mercenary groups, more than thirty were killed or injured, making everyone’s faces extremely gloomy.

Their luck wasn’t very good. They encountered the attacks of more than a hundred fierce beasts midway, eight of which were at transcendent-level rank 6.

When that group of fierce beasts appeared, in an instant, more than 30 of them died in the battle. More than a dozen people from the Chamber of Commerce at the front were directly eaten by the fierce beasts.

At the moment when everyone was in despair, fortunately, a group of people appeared.

A group of 13 people, one was at transcendent-level rank eight, three were at transcendent-level rank seven, and nine were at transcendent-level rank six.

The appearance of the 13 people instantly destroyed a group of fierce beasts.

Under their pleas, the other party was willing to send them back to East Sea city.

What made them most excited was that the other party actually didn’t take their spirit stones.

“Yes, yes!”

The group of people from the Chamber of Commerce and the mercenary group hurriedly nodded.

“Who are they? Their strength is so terrifying?”

“Judging from their clothes, they are either from the demon hunters mercenary group or the demon Hunters Academy. They are definitely top-tier existences in East Sea City!”

“They are so powerful that they can sweep across our holy sea town!”

Behind them, some mercenary groups were discussing in low voices as they sped up and followed behind them.

If they were in their place, they wouldn’t dare to travel at such a fast speed in wind arrow mountain. They were simply courting death.

However, with so many experts around, they didn’t have any scruples.

“Eh? There are people in front?”

The thirteen people at the front lightly jumped onto another mountain peak and scanned their surroundings vigilantly.

After an hour, when they jumped onto a mountain peak, they suddenly found more than twenty people sitting not far ahead.

“They actually ate ghost face crabs here. They have some strength!”

A middle-aged man standing on the left licked his tongue and said with a smile.

“Hehe, send them out of wind arrow mountain and we’ll leave as soon as possible. We have to finish that mission as soon as possible. The new students will enter the school soon!”

An old man smiled and said while glancing at them.

“Okay, but I see that there are a lot of ghost face crabs there. Get a few and we’ll eat them on the way!”

The middle-aged man smiled and the group quickly flew over.

The merchant group behind them also rushed over.

“Eh? Everyone, are there any more ghost-faced crabs? Let’s buy two!”

The group landed in front of Wang Xian and the rest. The middle-aged man smiled as he swept his gaze across the two giant ghost-faced crabs that were being produced.

“Eh?”

Father Zhou turned his head and looked at the dozen of them. Following that, he looked at the few hundred people who had rushed over.

“A caravan?”

He was stunned for a moment before his face darkened.

“It’s them!”

“The people from the Zhou Chamber of Commerce. I didn’t expect that they were not eaten by the ferocious beasts!”

“They even caught ghost-faced crabs to cook here. How leisurely!”

Behind them, the people from the Zhou Chamber of Commerce looked embarrassed when they saw the people from the Zhou Chamber of Commerce.

They had almost died in the wilderness, but this group of people actually had good food and drinks!

This made them filled with jealousy!

“The Zhou Chamber of Commerce!”

Supervisor du and elder Xiao looked at Wang Xian and the rest with an embarrassed expression.

That night, they found an excuse to hide the reason for the disappearance of the group of experts from the Spirit Beast mercenary group. The others didn’t know that the spirit beast mercenary group disappeared because they were hunting the Zhou Chamber of Commerce.

When they saw the Zhou Chamber of Commerce again, a strong killing intent flashed in their eyes.

If it wasn’t for the Zhou Chamber of Commerce, they wouldn’t have suffered such a heavy loss.

Elder Xiao’s face was gloomy. His eyes moved and he suddenly walked forward. “My Lords, if you want the ghost-faced crab, we will buy it for you!”

As he spoke, he walked towards Wang Xian and the rest. “Sell the ghost-faced crab to us. You can name your price as you wish!”

The thirteen people standing in front of elder Xiao didn’t say anything when they saw him flattering them.

However, when elder Xiao walked over, Father Zhou, Zhou Han, Jin Liuyan, and the rest had ugly expressions on their faces.

Wang Xian also looked at him mockingly. His gaze then swept across the dozen people at the front.

Sensing the powerful energy contained within their bodies, Wang Xian didn’t pay too much attention to it.

“Scram!”

He glanced at elder Xiao coldly.

The assassination attempt by the Spirit Beast mercenary group that night definitely had something to do with this old man.

He didn’t have a good impression of this group of chambers of commerce and mercenary groups.

“You...”

Elder Xiao glared at him. Instead, a hint of a smile flashed across his face.

“Kid, why are you so arrogant? It’s your honor that our Lord wants to buy some of your ghost face crabs. Don’t be ungrateful!”

“We just want to buy some of your stuff. If you don’t want to sell it, then don’t sell it. Are you asking us to SCRAM? Kid, you’re too arrogant!”

At this moment, the cold voices of a few mercenary groups came from behind instantly.

More than ten burly middle-aged men held their weapons and immediately came over.

The thirteen people who were standing in front also raised their eyebrows and looked at Wang Xian with some displeasure.

A Kid, he’s a little arrogant!
