3849 Under the 3848 terrifying sacrifice

Sacrifice!

When the one million followers of the ten palaces heard this sentence, their bodies trembled violently.

The belief universe had a big killer weapon, and that was sacrifice!

Sacrificing their own followers would cause the gods to burst out with terrifying strength.

Similarly, if they sacrificed other followers, they would also be able to achieve a terrifying amplification!

“Every Legion, sacrifice one-fifth of their strength to block the Dragon King and the others. Quick!”

A rank 7 god from the decree palace shouted!

“Sacrifice!”

“Sacrifice!”

The experts from the other palaces roared without any hesitation.

With a wave of their arms, a large number of believers behind them were enveloped.

The believers who were enveloped by the power of faith were filled with despair.

However, they did not hesitate at all. They sat cross-legged and the heart of faith slowly flew above their heads.

To the experts who believed in the universe, the heart of faith was their lifeblood and also their source of power.

However, their sacrifice could cause their heart of faith to erupt with extreme energy.

It could cause them to burst out with pure and terrifying power of faith.

After the heart of faith was suspended in the air, a level seven pantheon flew directly to the sky.

In the sky above him, the illusory images of the believers appeared one after another. This illusory image began to collapse slowly.

The believers were sacrificing. The powerful believers around them were also sacrificing. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

They were sacrificing their own lives to obtain the most powerful power of faith!

“Eh?”

Wang Xian was astonished when he saw this scene!

His eyes focused and revealed a look of astonishment.

“Attack!”

Wang Xian shouted out in a hurry.

The soul spear in his hand shot forward.

Two Soul Spears covered the area where the two level seven gods were.

The Five Elements Millstone and the Tai Chi Dragon Plate attacked the gods who had sacrificed themselves.

An incomparably powerful force covered them.

“Block this attack and buy us some time!”

The group of rank 7 gods roared loudly when they saw this terrifying attack!

“Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!”

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

The tens of millions of gods and believers of the ten palaces all released powerful attacks and met it head-on.

However, the attacks from the soul spear and the Tai Chi Dragon Plate were not something that they could fight against together.

Not to mention Xiao Lan, Xiao Bai, and Lan Qingyue.

The terrifying attack came crashing down.

“PFFT! PFFT! PFFT!”

“PFFT! PFFT! PFFT!”

In an instant, at least a million worshippers and believers were engulfed by the terrifying energy wave and died instantly.

“Continue!”

When Wang Xian saw this scene, he moved his body and the soul battleship beneath him charged forward.

Lan Qingyue and the rest launched the second round of attacks.

“Faith, Barrier!”

At this moment, a level seven God who was concentrated by the sacrificial energy moved his palm and a staff of faith appeared in his hand.

This staff was formed from the pure power of faith.

With a wave of his arm, a barrier appeared in front of the 1,000,000 troops of the 10 palaces.

“Faith, Rain!”

Another rank 7 god that was blessed roared.

“Hua la la!”

In an instant, the rain formed by faith dripped down from the sky.

This rain of faith contained a special energy.

When the rain fell on the bodies of the gods and disciples of the Faith Universe, it had a strengthening effect. When it fell on other living plants, it had a terrifying offensive effect.

“Faith Destruction Palm!”

Another voice sounded and attacked little blue.

“Faith Heart Piercing Spear!”

The level 7 gods that were strengthened exploded with a terrifying power.

This power was not weaker than the level nine gods.

This was the power of sacrifice.

“What a powerful attack!”

Wang Xian’s expression changed slightly when he saw this scene.

The Soul Spear’s attack landed on the barrier and was completely blocked.

The powerful destructive palm of faith landed on Xiao Lan’s body and caused her to fly backward.

“However, the price to pay is also very high.”

Wang Xian mumbled as he watched.

The strength that they displayed was very terrifying. However, it was indeed a short-term improvement based on the strength of countless believers and the lives of the 200,000 gods and believers in each palace.

What was sacrificed was not just the strength of the believers. The level seven gods would not live for long either.

Since all his believers had died, he would drop down to the realm of the Pantheon. He might even die directly.

Boom! Boom! Boom

Boom! Boom! Boom

“Dragon King of the Dragon Palace, you made us pay such a huge price. We will not let you off. We will never let you off!”

A level seven pantheon that was sacrificed was filled with violent killing intent as he shouted sternly!

“Let’s Retreat!”

Wang Xian looked at their terrifying strength and spoke to Lan Qingyue directly.

He didn’t intend to continue fighting with them!

The sacrificial power of the gods of the universe was temporary and couldn’t be sustained for long.

In that case, he might as well leave and avoid their attacks!

Furthermore, the cursed level seven gods had been gradually transferred by them and were gradually recovering.

Once they had recovered, they would be able to unleash their terrifying strength with the help of the ultimate treasure in their hands!

Wang Xian was prepared to fight and retreat.

He would continue to kill them after the energy from their sacrifice had completely disappeared.

At this moment, they were no longer a match for the gods.

“Alright!”

Lan qingyue nodded and immediately gave the order to retreat to Xiao Lan’s small house!

Wang Xian did not hesitate and retreated immediately!

“Damn it, stay behind for us!”

The ten gods who were sacrificed roared ferociously. They immediately chased after them.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom

Boom! Boom! Boom

The five elements grinding mill and the Tai Chi Dragon Plate immediately formed a defense.

They immediately fled into the distance!

“Ahhhh! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die!”

The level seven gods who had sacrificed themselves unleashed attacks one after another as if they didn’t care about their lives. They attacked Wang Xian and the rest.

However, their attacks were all blocked by the Five Elements Millstone, the Tai Chi Dragon Plate, and Lan Qingyue.

In the blink of an eye, Wang Xian had pulled a huge distance away from them!

“The curse on our bodies has been shifted. We Can’t let the Dragon King escape. Chase after him!”

At this moment, the gods who had gotten rid of their curses roared and began to chase after him.

After the curse was lifted, they used their most precious treasures to unleash a burst of power that was sufficient to fight against Wang Xian and the rest.

After the sacrifice, even if the five sixth level Astral Beasts died, they were still much stronger than before.

However, this strength could not be maintained for long.

Once the power of the sacrifice began to disappear, they would not be a match for the Dragon King!
