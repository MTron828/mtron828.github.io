Chapter 2934: Treasure 1 of 2934 machine royal territory

“Bang, Bang, Bang!”

The sound of metal cracking could be heard. The gigantic head of the creator was directly torn apart by Wang Xian from the center!

“Crash!”

At this moment, Wang Xian’s incorporeal holy wings were flapping violently. He directly drilled down from the crack in the head.

“Crack, crack, crack!”

“Roar! Dragon King, you bunch of D * mned Fellows! I Won’t let you off! I Won’t let you off!”

At this moment, the roar of the creator came from the mechanical heart that was included in the battlefield.

This heart contained his core energy and all his technological information.

As long as he had this heart, he would be able to rise quickly.

Moreover, in order to prevent such an accident from happening, he had made preparations in advance.

Soon, he would be able to recover to his peak. When that time came, he would make the Dragon Palace pay the price.

Invading their machine imperial territory and destroying their cyborgs, everything would have to bear the consequences.

The Creator’s mechanical heart flew quickly. At the same time, he could still control the entire mechanical army.

However, as he watched the mechanical army collapse rapidly, his heart started beating rapidly.

“Beep Beep Beep, the Giant’s mechanical body has completely collapsed!”

“The mechanical army only has 33% of its strength left. I suggest that we evacuate quickly!”

“There is a 0.5% chance that we can make the mechanical army escape with 1.1% of its strength!”

One by one, information was transmitted into the creator’s consciousness, causing his heart to beat violently.

“Retreat!”

He immediately gave an order.

“The robot army wants to retreat, don’t let them escape!”

At the battlefield, the Robot Army received the creator’s order and began to retreat.

Prime Minister Gui immediately gave the order to chase.

One by one, the divine wind dragons locked onto the fleeing robots and easily chased after them, killing them quickly.

“Sky Formation!”

At this moment, Wang Xian stood on the giant body of the creator and shouted at the sky formation.

“Dragon King, has the creator been dealt with?”

The Sky Formation immediately asked.

“No, one of his core-like things escaped and locked onto him!”

Wang Xian shook his head and immediately ordered the Heaven Formation. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“It’s the Dragon King. Leave it to me. Even if he’s a special life form, I can still lock onto him with the information from his body!”

The Heaven Formation revealed a confident expression.

At this moment, the creator had just escaped. It was very easy to find him.

The Heaven Formation immediately set up a formation on the giant body of the creator to search for the creator’s location.

Buzz

“The Dragon King has been found. He is more than 130 billion kilometers away from us!”

The Heaven Formation said immediately.

“Let’s go, we’ll chase after him!”

“Prime Minister Gui, I’ll leave this place to you!”

Wang Xian moved his body and turned into a human figure. With the movement of the incipient saint wings, a gust of wind enveloped the heaven formation and chased after the creator rapidly.

Whoosh

The two figures disappeared rapidly.

“Dragon King, the Creator’s speed is three times slower than ours. We will be able to catch up to him in three minutes!”

The Heaven Formation looked at the formation in front of him and said to Wang Xian.

“Alright, the Creator’s core is escaping towards the central area of the machine royal territory. He should still have a trump card.”

Wang Xian said with a twinkle in his eyes.

“With the Creator’s intelligence, it’s impossible for him not to have a backup plan. I guess he still has his body and strength hidden away.”

“If he were to transfer the information directly, it would be impossible for the formation to lock onto him. However, he didn’t do so. Instead, he escaped directly. Perhaps the core he is residing in is very important now!”

The Heaven Array analyzed.

“Since that’s the case, let’s follow behind him and see where his trump card and backup plan are.”

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly and flew quickly.

“Not good. That Dragon King seems to be chasing after me. I need to change my direction.”

At the same time, the creator was receiving information from the battlefield. When he caught Wang Xian and the heaven array chasing after him, he was shocked and quickly changed his direction.

At the same time, he immediately searched for all the information about array masters.

“According to the records, array masters have powerful hunting methods. Through a person’s hair or even clothes, they can chase after a person’s location!”

“Array masters’hunting methods are abnormally terrifying. It is recommended to enter a special environment to eliminate one’s own aura and get rid of the array masters’Tracking!”

Information appeared one after another in the creator’s mind, causing him to secretly cry out, “Not good!”.

“Search the star map, search the unique environment of the machine imperial region, fly over immediately!”

The creator immediately began to calculate and search.

“Good, good, my luck is really good. There is a special area on the right, the Lightning area. My mechanical heart is extremely immune to lightning.”

The creator thought to himself and quickly changed his direction.

“Eh, the Creator has started to change his direction. Dragon King, he should know that we are chasing after him, he should also know the methods of Array Masters.”

At the back, Heaven’s formation noticed the sudden change in direction of the Creator. He raised his eyebrows slightly and said.

“It’s alright. We will be able to catch up to him soon. When that happens, we will follow behind him!”

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly and sped up abruptly.

“He has entered an area of lightning. That area has some influence on my array formation. However, it shouldn’t be a problem!”

Soon, the Heaven Formation spoke.

“I see it!”

At this moment, Wang Xian also saw an area of lightning in front of him.

The Dragon Eyes of the Yin-yang and five elements swept across the area and soon, he saw a blurry shadow.

“I found it!”

Wang Xian’s face lit up and the corners of his mouth curled up slightly.

“Let me see where you can escape to!”

He mumbled.

“Di di, according to my analysis, this lightning has a certain effect on the array master. There is a 60% chance that the other party will lose their ability to lock onto the target.”

At this moment, the creator was madly calculating the Array Master’s search ability in his mind.

Soon, he received a piece of data.

“60% is not enough. Search the next Special Area and head to the next Special Area.”

“Burn the energy and increase the speed!”

The creator mumbled as his speed suddenly increased by two times.

“Huh? His speed has actually increased!”

Wang Xian was slightly shocked when he saw the creator’s speed suddenly increase. He hurriedly followed behind.

With his speed, it was still very easy for him to keep up with the Creator’s mechanical heart.

His gaze was locked onto the creator as he followed behind.

At this moment, the creator no longer had any equipment. He had no idea that Wang Xian was already following behind him.

However, what Wang Xian didn’t expect was that the creator was flying toward one special place after another.

There was no sign of him heading to his base.

“Beep Beep Beep Beep. Passing through a black hole, through the interference of the black hole particles, the probability of the formation master locking onto it is 8% .”

“Beep, BEEP, Beep. Enveloping the heavenly flame liquid, the chance of the array master locking on is 7.333% .”
