Chapter 1505: 1505 begging the devil

Black, as Black as the Abyss!

Wang Xian sat there with his head lowered. His eyes were slowly turning pitch-black. If one were to stare into his eyes at this moment, one would feel terrified.

In the deepest part of his pupils, there seemed to be an extremely ferocious demonic dragon that wanted to break free from the Cage of the Abyss.

He Yuan stood there alone, he dazhuang, and Lin Yaoyao consoled him for more than ten minutes. When he saw that Wang Xian did not say a word, he yuan shook his head helplessly.

He gestured to the few people beside him and left immediately.

A few hours after they left, Wang Xian suddenly raised his head. A ferocious and terrifying look suddenly appeared in his eyes.

Even though the GODFIEND Dragon had a noble dragon body, it still gave people a sense of evil and malevolence.

The GODFIEND Dragon of the Abyss!

At this moment, in Wang Xian’s mind, the heart of Light and darkness, which had been silent for a long time, was glowing with a black light.

The heart of Light and darkness, which was at the extremes of light and darkness, was slowly operating. The black light completely covered the light.

A sinister and terrifying aura was slowly emitted from Wang Xian’s body.

He stood up slowly and everything around him dissipated.

He turned into a wisp of black smoke.

The grass on the ground withered at a terrifying speed.

He stood up slowly. His pair of completely black eyes were staring in one direction as he walked forward unswervingly.

His body was a little stiff, as if he was being controlled.

Every step he took, the grass under his body would wither. He walked straight in one direction.

“Weng!”

“There’s a terrifying energy!”

At this moment, an alarm sounded from the law enforcement pavilion not far away.

Inside the He clan’s forest, everyone was slightly shocked.

“What happened again?”

One of the pavilion masters was slightly shocked. More things had happened in the past few days than in the past ten years combined.

The three pavilion masters flew over quickly. He Feng, who had joined the law enforcement pavilion, followed behind them quickly.

“It’s Over There!”

When they sensed the destructive energy, everyone flew over.

“That is?”

“It’s young master Wang Xian. What’s going on with him?”

When they flew over and saw Wang Xian in such a state, they were slightly shocked.

“Young master Wang Xian!” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

A pavilion master shouted at Wang Xian with a face full of astonishment.

However, Wang Xian did not respond at all and walked straight ahead.

“What’s going on? Go and call the clan leader and he yuan over!”

A pavilion master frowned and said immediately.

For an expert of this level, he could only ask the clan leader and the rest to make a move.

“Yes!”

A law enforcement officer hurriedly flew towards the holy tree.

“Gulp!”

He Feng looked at Wang Xian’s pupils and suddenly shivered. A hint of fear appeared in his eyes.

Deep, terrifying, Abyss!

Even his temperament was greatly affected.

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz

Just when Wang Xian was about 1,000 meters away, one figure after another flew over.

The He clan leader, the three clan elders, he Yuanhe Suiqing, Lin Yaoyao, and the rest rushed over quickly.

When they saw Wang Xian’s condition, their pupils contracted slightly.

“What a terrifying power of Darkness!”

The He clan leader and the three clan elders were shocked.

“Brother Wang Xian!”

When he yuan saw Wang Xian’s condition, his expression changed drastically. He hurriedly shouted loudly.

When he saw that Wang Xian did not respond, he flew towards the spot in front of Wang Xian anxiously. He landed in front of Wang Xian and stared at him with widened eyes.

“Yuan ‘er, be careful. His condition is not right!”

Even with the profound knowledge of the He clan leader and the clan elders, they did not understand what kind of situation Wang Xian was in.

They were afraid of attacking him.

The few of them immediately came to he Yuan’s side and stared at Wang Xian. When they saw his pupils, they were slightly shocked.

“Brother Wang Xian, Wake Up!”

He Yuan raised his head and stared at Wang Xian with an extremely embarrassed expression. He shouted loudly.

Wang Xian’s body stiffened and he stopped moving. A glimmer of light flashed in his eyes.

He raised his head slowly and looked at he yuan. He shouted with a stiff voice, “He yuan, tell me, what would happen if a person doesn’t have a Heart?”

Tell me, what would happen if a person doesn’t have a heart?

When he yuan heard this sentence, he was stunned. Everyone around him stared at Wang Xian in astonishment.

“What would happen if a person doesn’t have a Heart?”

While they were in a daze, Wang Xian seemed to be mumbling to himself.

However, following that, a shocking action made everyone present widen their eyes. They were filled with disbelief.

When he finished his sentence, Wang Xian stared at his chest and gently grabbed it with his palm.

“PFFT!”

A sound rang out in the surroundings where a pin drop could be heard. A heart appeared in his hand.

This was Wang Xian’s own heart.

In order to find Ling Jian ‘er, he had traveled hundreds of thousands of miles to this place. In the end, he received the news that she might be dead.

Coupled with the accumulation over the past month, the darkness in the heart of Light and darkness in his mind exploded.

He stared at the beating heart in his hand slowly and was slightly lost in thought.

“No, brother Wang Xian, wake up!”

He Yuan’s expression changed drastically when he saw the horrifying scene. He shouted loudly and wanted to run towards him, but his father pulled him back.

Everyone around him was filled with astonishment.

“What would happen if a person doesn’t have a Heart?”

He mumbled to himself again.

The bright red beating heart turned into bloody pieces in his hands.

He crushed his own heart!

He crushed his own heart!

Everyone around felt their scalps turn numb. They inhaled a mouthful of cold air and stared blankly.

Wang Xian slowly closed his eyes. His body seemed to be frozen in place.

At the location of his heart on his chest, a terrifying power of darkness surged directly into his heart. The heart of Light and darkness in his mind replaced his original heart.

“It doesn’t seem to be in pain. Furthermore, I feel that it’s even stronger!”

Boom

Wang Xian opened his eyes abruptly. Strands of dense, substance-like power of darkness flowed out like tears.

Gulp

“He didn’t die!”

The He clan leader and the three clan elders, including everyone around them, looked at Wang Xian with their scalps tingling.

Terrifying, terrifying!

This was the first time they saw a person crushing his own heart without dying.

Even a powerhouse at the ninth level of the Seethrough realm would die if his heart was crushed, unless he had reached the realm of longevity.

However, even if he was in the realm of longevity, with his heart being crushed, there would be less than one-tenth of his strength left!

“I, I...”

He Feng’s legs were trembling. His eyes were filled with fear. He was desperately asking himself why he had offended such a crazy person in the past.

No, he was a crazy monster.

“Bloom in the darkness, and be eternal in the Slaughter!”

At this moment, Wang Xian lowered his head slowly and looked at his pitch-black heart. He mumbled to himself!

Bloom in the darkness, and be eternal in the slaughter!

Ten words, extremely cold!

“Seek the Devil!”

At this moment, he raised his head. His entire body was enveloped by the tangible dark energy crazily!
