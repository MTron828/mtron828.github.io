Chapter 335: The Arrogant Young Man from Medical Saint Sect

They were strange, even eerie, and yet ordinary creatures.

There was an ant, a very huge one, and its head held a mass which resembled a mushroom.

Then there was an all-black leech. With a mouth which was entirely split open, its claws stuck out with countless sharp pricks.

Next was a white leech. With teeth on its head, its entire body was smudged in a sticky blood-colored liquid.

While the last was a mosquito, a blood-sucking mosquito with a ghostly face and crimson body.

These were four ordinary creatures, and yet they appeared so gruesome in the photos, as if they had gone through some terrifying mutation.

Furthermore, each of these four otherwise tiny creatures were now the size of a human palm. Which made them all the more horrifying.

Each record was captioned by numerous sentences below.

The four creatures moved at accelerated speeds. Unless one had the abilities of a Level 7 to 8 Martial Artist, it was impossible to dodge their attacks.

In addition, once bitten by such creatures, a person would turn maniac. They would start biting others like a walking corpse and spread the virus to the remaining unaffected.

According to the records, there were currently plenty of these creatures over there, within a radius of thirty kilometers.

“Little wonder why the Miracle Doctor has been asked to order for such a mission!” Wang Xian exclaimed in shock as he read through the records.

Given that only Level 8 to 9 Martial Artists can ensure their own safety in such a place, there would be great hazards should these creatures be able to spread the virus further.

To the extent where irreversible damages and losses were inevitable.

“There’ll be someone fetching me in the morning, the day after tomorrow. We’ll head over together then!” Sun Lingxiu said cheerfully. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Sure!” Wang Xian nodded back. He had attended two classes at the university, after hanging around at the Divine Dragon Medical Hall for a while.

When night came, he returned to the villa together with Guan Shuqing and Xiao Yu.

Lan Qingyue had been busier lately, as she was expanding Deep-Sea Jewelry at astonishing speeds.

Moreover, the Zhou Jewelry had been sold to Deep-Sea Jewelry for an astronomical price.

Since the Pilgrimage incident, the Lingyue Sect had been completely scared out of their wits. They were afraid that Wang Xian might really lead a team of experts over to have their Sect annihilated.

Since the Zhou Jewelry had been acquired by Deep-Sea Jewelry, the two had merged to become the nation’s largest jeweler.

After which, the company’s market value had since doubled.

Thus, Lan Qingyue had been busy handling company matters.

The rest enjoyed a day of thorough relaxation at the villa.

At dawn the following morning, a military Jeep arrived at the villa’s doorstep.

A plain clothed militant saluted Sun Lingxiu.

“Sit tight. We’ll set off right away!” the militant said.

Wang Xian, Sun Lingxiu and the Miracle Doctor Blood Man got in the Jeep, and in no time arrived at the military airport nearby.

Immediately after, a helicopter flew the trio in the direction of the Huangqi City.

Huangqi City was a Tier 3 to 4 small city, situated near the plains where the Yellow River flowed past.

This time, their destination was set for a region by one of the tributaries of the Yellow River.

The aircraft landed on a makeshift helipad within the plains. As Wang Xian and the rest alighted, they saw many soldiers who had gathered around.

The region was now cordoned off by high-voltage wires, in order to prevent creatures from escaping.

But the method had yielded few results.

Numerous temporary tents were also pitched up front.

The area was also surrounded by many people, accompanied by tens of stationery aircrafts.

“This way please, Miracle Doctor Sun!” a middle-aged man directed as he led Sun Lingxiu and the rest. They ended up at a gigantic tent which stood in the central location.

With one look, it was clear that the tent had been set up as a temporary military command center. It was massive, and would not overcrowd even if it contained more than a hundred.

In fact, the group could already see more than a hundred inside when they first arrived.

Wang Xian squinted his eyes briefly as he swept his gaze across.

The tent was thronging with experts. There were more than a dozen Inborn experts, while the remaining were all Miracle Doctors.

There was a bald Elder who stood out from the crowd. And Wang Xian recognized in an instant that he was Buddhist Physician, who was ranked sixth on the Miracle Doctors’ Chart.

Their arrival had turned many heads. Like a firefly which sparkled in the night, Sun Lingxiu shone in a pristine air which could not go unnoticed.

“It’s the Holy Goddess, Miracle Doctor Sun!” a group of young men in the tent exclaimed as their eyes glistened. To which, even the middle-aged men could not help but take a few more glances.

“Miracle Doctor Sun, this way please!” said a middle-aged man dressed in military uniform when he saw Sun Lingxiu.

“Sure!” Sun Lingxiu nodded as she walked into the tent.

Inside the tent, there were close to thirty seats which were mostly occupied.

Seated amongst them were people including all the Inborn experts as well as several top-ranking Miracle Doctors.

As Sun Lingxiu had been invited along, it was only natural that she be qualified to sit at the front.

Furthermore, she had the means to, given her current reputation.

“Ack ack! It’s rather crowded, but there aren’t that many seats!” Miracle Doctor Blood Man joked. As he laughed, he flopped onto a seat and looked around in relaxation.

“The room capacity is limited. Plus people will not gossip when the Miracle Doctors and experts are being seated here!” the middle-aged militant explained with a smile.

Indifferently, Wang Xian also sat down in a seat he found.

He had just settled down when he felt a wave of cold stares surging towards him. Slightly taken aback, Wang Xian turned to take a look.

Beside him, an aged Elder looked on with burning stares. Beside him was a familiar figure – Yan She the Poison Doc.

When Yan She sensed Wang Xian looking in his direction, he acknowledged him with a friendly nod.

“The Sacred Followers Guild!” a voice announced. As it did, Wang Xian saw a group dressed in a synchronized outfit, and felt a slight stir in his heart.

Whereas the Elder smirked as he looked on dryly.

It must be the Master of Miracle Doctor Guang Hua! Wang Xian speculated to himself as he revealed a faint smile, brushing the elder’s smirk aside.

“Fellows from the Medical Saint Sect, this way, please!” a voice greeted respectfully at the main entrance. Immediately, the crowd scrambled to give way, freeing up the path.

A young man emerged in the middle of the crowd, with two other Elders walking beside him. Exuding a fragrance of medicinal herbs, the arrogant trio made their way in with their heads held high.

In particular, the young man who was walking in the middle, giving a dry smile while his gaze swept past all who were seated.

With chest puffed out and head held high, the young man stopped briefly when he spotted Sun Lingxiu. Pausing for a moment, a glow flickered across his eyes.

As he hurried his way over, he checked on the sides and looked towards Wang Xian.

“Young lad, could you move over to the seat by the side!” an Elder beside the young man said to Wang Xian flatly, while gesturing with his head low. Meanwhile, the young man remained silent.

“Medical Saint Sect. Even the Medical Saint Sect’s here, and with three representatives!” one chirped.

“I know those two Elders. They are the Poison Duo of the Medical Saint Sect. Inborn level experts, highly renowned!” another squeaked.

“Who’s that young man? How is it that he’s able to stand in between the Poison Duo?” the third asked.

“Can’t you tell by looking at his attire? The Medical Saint Sect regards the Hua Family and the Bian Family as their core. There’s a Bian character on the young man’s attire. He’s likely the Core Disciple of the Bian Family!” another explained.
