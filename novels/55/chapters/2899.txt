Chapter 2900: 2,900 power of the Dragon Palace 7

“Supremacy, ruler, the destiny of the Heaven!”

When invincible heard Wang Xian’s words, he muttered.

“Does this mean that I can only advance to the level of a universe knight? Sigh, isn’t this too weak?”

He said helplessly with a bitter face.

“That’s enough, Kid. The core members of the top races in the universe are only at this level.”

“Those at the ruler level are the clan-guarding experts of the peak races!”

The sky array patted his invincible head and said with a smile.

…

“Oh no, reporting to the desolate celestial emperor, we have received news from the Heaven Punishment Ancient Sky region that the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace is rushing toward us with nine Divine Dragons!”

At the same time, in the center of the eight barrens, an eight barrens protector came to a study with a terrified face and reported with a terrified voice.

“Is the news true?”

In the study, the desolate god Emperor who was sitting inside immediately stood up and growled with an abnormally embarrassed expression.

“Sir, the news is true. Some pictures have been sent over.”

Guardian of the eight Barrens said with a solemn expression.

“Hu!”

The desolate god Emperor closed his eyes slightly. His expression was abnormally embarrassed.

Guardian of the eight barrens ahead was somewhat anxious.

It was rare for a guardian of a large faction, a peak godly monarch expert, to feel so uneasy.

But this time, he was truly panicking.

The Dragon King Was Here!

The Dragon King could sweep through the Heaven Magus realm and none of the godly monarch experts could escape.

If they came to attack the eight desolation, none of them would be able to escape!

What should they do now?

Protector eight barrens looked at the desolate celestial emperor anxiously.

“Inform the other celestial emperors and all the godly monarch disciples of the eight barrens to prepare to retreat!”

After a few seconds of silence, the desolate celestial emperor’s voice was filled with unwillingness.

Protector eight barrens was slightly stunned before he immediately nodded.

“Yes, my Lord!”

He immediately walked out and could not help but feel relieved.

He was really afraid of confronting the Dragon Palace.

Escaping was the best choice.

He immediately began to inform the other divine emperors and divine king disciples.

In the next few hours, everyone in the eight desolation six directions discovered that the divine king experts of the eight desolation were flying toward the core planet of the eight desolation six directions.

This made everyone in the eight desolation six directions slightly surprised.

What were they trying to do?

However, very quickly, they strangely discovered that all the disciples of the eight desolation six directions seemed to have disappeared.

“Dragon King, the eight desolation six directions is right ahead!”

A day later, in the void in front of the eight desolation six directions, the heaven array stood up slowly. Looking at the chaotic eight desolation six directions that looked like an ancient battlefield, it spoke to Wang Xian.

“Okay!”

Wang Xian nodded.

“Boss Wang, I saw it on the communication network. Someone said that the experts of bhang Liu he seemed to have disappeared altogether recently!”

At this moment, invincible battle technique looked at his communication stone plate and said with a frown.

“Oh?”

Wang Xian opened the Dragon sedan and raised his eyebrows slightly.

“The news from the Heaven Wizard region must have spread here after such a long time. After learning about our strength, bhang Liu he could only run away. Hehe!”

Tian Chen smiled coldly. “However, now that my strength has broken through, I want to see where they can run to!”

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

When the nine divine dragons entered bhang Liu he’s domain, dragon roars resounded throughout the entire galaxy.

It represented the arrival of the Dragon Palace.

The nine divine dragons swayed their huge bodies as they flew straight towards bhang Liu he’s base.

They flew at a high speed. Soon, someone saw the nine divine dragons pulling a dragon sedan as they flew through the starry sky.

Seeing this majestic scene, everyone was shocked.

“Hiss, this… This is the divine dragon of the Dragon Palace. The one in the Dragon sedan should be the Dragon King!”

“The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace is here. Is this the Divine Dragon of the Dragon Palace? How terrifying!”

“No wonder all the experts of the eight barrens seem to have disappeared. They must have received the news that the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace is here!”

“The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace didn’t send many people here. is the Dragon King so confident that he can destroy them with just these forces?”

“The emperor of the eight barrens obviously knows how many forces the Dragon Palace has sent. They know that the Dragon Palace can destroy them all with just these forces!”

When the nine divine dragons dragged the dragon palanquin through the eight barren six directions. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Soon, a storm blew up in the eight barren six directions.

Everyone’s eyes were on the divine dragons and the eight barren divine dragons of the Dragon Palace.

However, according to the news they had received, the eight barren experts had probably escaped.

That was because there was no news from the eight barren experts for the entire day.

“Our eight barrens god Emperor had already given the order yesterday. All the god King experts have gathered on the eight barrens planet. They should have already hidden.”

“It’s almost 100% certain that there are experts who have passed by the eight barrens planet. There is no one left on it. All the experts of the eight barrens have escaped!”

“How ironic. Not long ago, the eight barrens said that they wanted to teach the Dragon Palace Dragon King and the others a lesson. However, now that the Dragon King has led the nine divine dragons to attack, the people of the eight barrens have escaped.”

“This is the power of the Dragon Palace. If they don’t escape, all of them will die. Escaping is the right choice. The Dragon Palace is too strong!”

“Bhang is very strong, but the Dragon Palace is stronger. They are so strong that when they received the news of the Dragon King’s arrival, they immediately fled!”

“The power of the Divine Dragon, the power of the Dragon Palace!”

The news was boiling in the communication network of bhang and six directions.

They were also shocked by the news of bhang Liu he’s escape.

Bhang Liu he used to be one of the top three existences in this resplendent starry sky.

Now, he actually wanted to escape when faced with the Dragon Palace.

This also reflected the powerful strength of the Dragon Palace.

The entire bhang Liu he was discussing. They were discussing the strength of the Dragon Palace and the Divine Dragon of the Dragon Palace.

“Dragon King, the base of bhang Liu he is right in front of us. There’s no one up there anymore. TSK TSK, I didn’t expect them to abandon this blessed land directly!”

Under the watchful eyes of the entire bhang and six directions, Wang Xian and the rest arrived in front of the base of bhang and six directions.

Seeing that there was no sign of life up there, a mocking expression appeared on the Heaven Array’s face.

“Let’s go and take a look!”

Wang Xian said to the nine divine dragons.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

Dragon roars sounded one after another. Soon, Wang Xian and the rest arrived in the sky.

Wang Xian walked out of the Dragon sedan and scanned the area below with his dragon eyes.

They had taken away all the treasures that could be taken away.

“Let me take a look!”

The Heaven Formation moved and flew directly toward the area below.

He landed on the ground and waved his arm. He gathered the aura of this area and began to set up the formation.

“Woof Woof!”

Soon, a dog formed from wind attribute walked out from the formation and growled softly.

Tian Chen frowned slightly and the dog slowly changed into a formation.

Looking at the formation in front of him, his expression changed.
