Chapter 924: 0925 rank seven extraordinary pill

Translator: 549690339

Fierce battles broke out. From time to time, members of the mercenary group were injured and brought to the city wall by their companions.

Compared to the first wave of battles, the second wave was much more intense.

The thousand-legged fish had metal attributes. Its sharp teeth could easily pierce through human warriors.

It could stand up and use its four legs to support its body. Its other legs were like blade lights. Its attacks were very powerful.

The sea crabs were stronger than the thousand-legged fish. They carried flames and relied on their hard shells to attack.

Their hard shells were like ten-thousand-year-old stones in the lava.

If any sea crab was placed in a city on Earth, it would have the terrifying strength to destroy a city.

However, there were experts in the holy sea town. Two experts at the level eight of the extraordinary realm went to the back to kill the leader of the thousand-legged fish and the sea crabs.

The two experts held back a lot of the thousand-legged fish and the raging sea crab.

Wang Xian held a wooden long whip in his hand. It was formed from the Green Dragon Pearl. With a wave of his arm, the long whip pierced through more than ten thousand-legged fish.

He killed the ferocious beasts below level 3 supernatural realm easily. Even those below level 2 supernatural realm did not dare to resist.

Other than the weaker members of the mercenary group, everyone on the city wall participated in the hunting of the ferocious beasts.

Looking from the city wall, one could see with the naked eye that the speed at which Wang Xian and the rest were hunting the ferocious beasts far exceeded the speed of the other mercenary groups.

More than ten extraordinary second stage warriors were killed with a wave of their hands. Even the extraordinary third stage and fourth stage warriors could not withstand Wang Xian’s attack.

In less than half an hour, Wang Xian had killed over a thousand ferocious beasts.

If these over a thousand ferocious beasts were converted into resources, they would be worth three to four million middle-grade spirit stones.

However, this was only the beginning.

Burning the river and boiling the sea!

Descending of the wood realm!

Spirit Enchantment!

One after another, divine abilities were released.

The Golden Swordfish at the side didn’t fall behind either. They released large-scale metal attribute divine abilities.

With a single divine ability, hundreds of thousand-legged fish and raging sea crabs were killed.

“Hu hu!”

“I can’t take it anymore. The energy in my body has been used up!”

“I’ll go back first. I can’t hold on any longer!”

After twenty minutes of battle, most of the mercenary group members’foreheads were covered in cold sweat.

Battles, especially those that involved massacres, consumed the most energy.

Those who could stand at the foot of the city were all relatively strong.

Half of them could instantly kill a rank 2 transcendent beast.

However, it was also this kind of quick instant kill that consumed the most energy.

It was just like an executioner. One would not feel tired after chopping off a person’s head. However, one would also feel tired after chopping off 100 people consecutively.

This was especially so when one released a series of divine abilities, which increased the speed of exhaustion.

Very soon, some of the level two, level three, and even level four extraordinary mercenary group members flew back to the city wall to rest.

However, Wang Xian, Ao Jian, and the rest did not feel tired at all.

They were slaughtering. They were slaughtering non-stop!

Nearly an hour later, Wang Xian and the rest were still slaughtering non-stop.

This shocked the members of the mercenary group and the city guards who were standing on the city wall and were about to collapse.

“D * mn, are the twelve of them still human? The battle has been going on for an hour without any rest!”

“Awesome! There are only about five hundred people on the battlefield. Some of them went back to the city wall to rest and take some pills before continuing the battle!”

“Their physiques are so strong. They must have had some fortuitous encounter!”

“They must have taken some high-grade pills. They spent millions of spirit stones to buy many pills from the immortal Phoenix!”

“What do you guys think is the relationship between the Celestial Phoenix Mercenary Group and Phoenix Immortal Elixir and Weapon Workshop?”

On the city wall, some people wiped the sweat off their foreheads and looked at the Celestial Phoenix mercenary group that was fighting non-stop with admiration.

“Die!”

The long whip in Wang Xian’s hand was like a poisonous snake that pierced through an extraordinary level four raging sea crab. He let out a deep breath.

After fighting continuously for an hour, he was also exhausted.

“The second wave is about to end!”

Wang Xian swept his gaze forward. The ground was filled with corpses, and only a dozen ferocious beasts were fleeing in panic.

“Phew, let’s go back. We have killed at least five to six thousand ferocious beasts this time!”

Wang Xian revealed a smile. Five to six thousand ferocious beasts were worth twenty million middle-grade spirit stones!

He was all smiles. These 20 million spirit stones were enough for him to advance his level to transcendent level four, or it could also allow Ao Jian and the rest to advance to transcendent level four!

Spirit Stones were a form of harvest. The points obtained from killing the ferocious beasts could also allow the Celestial Phoenix mercenary group to advance to gold-grade.

“Let’s go back!”

Wang Xian’s body moved and flew towards the city wall.

At the side, the members of the saber scar mercenary group flew over as well.

However, their expressions were not very good.

During the battle just now, they were always in the center.

In the entire battle, seven to eight of their comrades had died. Among them, there was also an expert of extraordinary sixth level.

This made their leader’s expression extremely gloomy.

It was difficult to nurture an expert of extraordinary sixth level, even if it was 10 to 20 million spirit stones.

“What terrifying combat strength!”

At this moment, on the city wall, shopkeeper Liu and the woman looked at Wang Xian and the rest who had flown back in astonishment.

“If he can grow up, he will definitely be able to suppress a top-notch powerhouse!”

The woman’s eyes flickered. After hesitating for a moment, she moved her arm and a jade bottle appeared in her hand.

The jade bottle was crystal clear. One look and one could tell that it was extremely valuable.

However, what was even more precious was the medicinal pill inside.

“Using a transcendent tier 7 medicinal pill to befriend a friend who has the potential to become a top-tier expert, it’s worth it!”

The woman muttered.

Shopkeeper Liu, who was at the side, widened his eyes when he saw manager Yi suddenly take out a bottle of medicinal pills.

Transcendent Tier 7 medicinal pill. This was the medicinal pill that manager Yi was able to mobilize with the highest level.

He could use this elixir to recruit strong fighters.

However, even for someone at Supervisor Yi’s level, he only had the authority to do so once in three years.

“Supervisor Yi, what are you trying to do?”

Manager Liu asked with a face full of astonishment.

“Initially, I was thinking of using this elixir to hire the dragon spike that you mentioned. But now, it seems that making a friend is more worthwhile than assassinating an enemy!”

The woman smiled faintly. She looked at Wang Xian who was flying over and went up to him directly.

Shopkeeper Liu also followed him hurriedly.

“Commander Wang!”

When Wang Xian just landed in the city, a voice sounded.

Wang Xian turned his head and saw shopkeeper Liu and a woman walking over. His face was filled with curiosity.

“Commander Wang, thank you for your support to our Fengxian Elixir and weapons workshop. I was impressed by Commander Wang’s massacre just now. It’s just a small gift. It should be useful for your upcoming battle!”

The woman took out the elixir and handed it to Wang Xian.

“HMM, elixir?”

Wang Xian looked over and was surprised.
