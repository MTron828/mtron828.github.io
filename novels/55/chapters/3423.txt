3424 3423 universe masters fled

“Hong! Hong! Hong!”

The sound of collision resounded in the sky above the main hall of the Thunder Ray race.

A terrifying war broke out.

The Great Thunderclap Academy’s Dean and the other great beings from the four great powers were all looking at the war in fear.

“All disciples, gather together. Everyone, get ready.”

The Great Thunderclap Academy’s Dean had an extremely ugly expression on his face as he ordered fearfully.

They gave up on continuing to suppress the Lightning race as their expressions kept changing as they stared at the battle in front of them.

Right now, their hearts were filled with fear.

The battle in front of them was related to their fates.

In fact, they understood that the fates of the four great factions might have already come to an end. However, they still had some unrealistic thoughts in their hearts.

They hoped that the powerhouse in the black cloud would be able to kill the eldest senior brother of the Thunder Ray race.

After all, the eldest senior brother of the Thunder Ray race had just made a breakthrough.

“Wang Xian… he has made a breakthrough in his strength? He is currently fighting with the powerhouse in the Black Cloud!”

“Hiss, he has really made a breakthrough. His strength has really broken through to the level of a universe overlord. Hahaha, this is great, this is great!”

“Our eldest senior brother of the Thunder Ray Tribe has made a breakthrough in his strength. Who would have thought that we are going to win? The Great Thunderclap Academy, Zi City, Liuyan City, your doomsday has arrived!”

At this moment, in the main hall, the leader of the Thunder Ray tribe and the rest of the experts who were suppressed in the grotto-heaven blessed land looked at the scene in front of them with excitement.

They were already prepared to be suppressed.

However, Wang Xian had actually made a breakthrough.

This made them feel extremely dazed.

Wang Xian had made a breakthrough. Their Thunder Ray tribe also had an existence on the level of the Master of the universe!

This crisis could also be resolved quickly.

“What? Our eldest senior brother has made a breakthrough?”

“Our eldest senior brother has made a breakthrough. This… Hahaha, this is great. Our eldest senior brother is invincible!”

At the back, when the disciples heard the exclamations of the clan leader and the rest, their eyes widened instantly and their bodies were filled with excitement.

Boom! Boom! Boom

At the position outside, Wang Xian was relying on his powerful speed to continuously attack the black cloud.

The energy of the black cloud was getting lesser and lesser. Gradually, the figure within the black cloud slowly emerged.

He was three meters tall and extremely skinny. He held a black scepter in his hand and had two faces.

His blood-red eyes were filled with bloodlust and violence.

He waved the scepter in his hand and blocked Wang Xian’s attacks continuously.

His expression was unusually ugly.

“Senior brother of the Thunder Ray race, you can’t kill me. Are you really going to be my enemy?”

The figure in the black cloud let out a cold voice and roared in a sinister manner.

“You are the one who wants to be my enemy. You are the one who is going to be our enemy. You even said that I am your enemy and that I will let you off. If you don’t pay the price today, don’t even think about leaving this place.”

Wang Xian stared coldly at the figure in the black cloud. His eyes were filled with disdain.

From Wang Xian’s perspective, the figure in the black cloud was not very strong. He was mainly good at long-range attacks.

If he did not have the innate spiritual treasure, the black cloud, Wang Xian would be able to kill him quickly.

Even so, if he wanted to escape, Wang Xian would have to make him pay a price.

“You deserve to die. Your Thunder Ray race deserves to die too!”

The Elder in the Black Cloud roared furiously. Waves of black gas surged out from his body and charged directly at Wang Xian.

The black gas covered a radius of hundreds of millions of kilometers. It was a full-scale attack.

Wang Xian moved his body and easily retreated out of the range of the attack. Waves of single-point attacks charged into the area.

Buzz

The figure in the black cloud started to turn illusory. He wanted to escape back to his divine kingdom in an instant.

However, how could Wang Xian give him this opportunity.

He dashed forward at a terrifying speed. Waves of energy rushed towards his body.

He could not move when he escaped back to his divine kingdom.

Therefore, the attacks around him were not very strong at this moment. Wang Xian relied on his speed and strength to interrupt his escape once again.

“Mighty Heavenly Dragon!”

At this moment, Wang Xian also unleashed his strongest law attack.

Didn’t you want to escape?

When you were escaping, it was also the time when you were most unprepared.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

The Mighty Celestial Dragon appeared in front of Wang Xian in an instant. It was an incomparably terrifying divine dragon.

The Divine Dragon looked the same as Wang Xian’s dragon body. It also had a pair of dragon wings.

However, the Mighty Celestial Dragon was over ten million kilometers in size.

“This is bad!”

The figure in the dark cloud trembled violently after being interrupted. He immediately waved his staff and the surrounding skulls flew up and collided with the Mighty Celestial Dragon.

Boom

The collision was heard and the figure in the dark cloud was sent flying backward. He spat out a mouthful of fresh blood.

“I’m not his match! I Can’t continue wasting time!”

The figure in the Black Cloud’s face turned pale. When he saw the skulls around him crack, his heart sank again.

“Whoosh!”

At this moment, he sensed a figure appear behind him.

A trace of cold sweat appeared.

“Black Cloud, Cloud Lotus!”

He immediately roared, and the surrounding black cloud condensed into a flower petal, protecting his body.

“Run!”

“Senior brother of the Lightning race, just you wait. I will make you pay a terrible price!”

His two faces opened their mouths at the same time and let out a sinister voice. He stared at Wang Xian with bloodthirsty eyes.

His body started to turn illusory again.

“Hehe!”

Wang Xian looked at him and sneered, “Just you wait. Don’t let me know which race you are from.”

As he spoke, his arm turned into a dragon claw and clawed at the lotus flowers.

Bam

An intense resistance came. Wang Xian did not break through the defense of the lotus flowers. The figure inside stared at him with hatred and disappeared.

However, the price was that the black cloud stayed behind.

The black cloud helped him to resist for some time.

Wang Xian smiled and looked to the side.

“Gulp!”

“He escaped. That Lord has escaped. No, he is trying to escape for his life!”

At this moment, all the strong disciples from the Great Thunderclap Academy and the other four major forces were stunned!

“Run, run, run!”

The headmaster of the Great Thunderclap Academy shouted with a face full of despair. Their bodies moved and began to turn illusory.

Even the masters of the universe had escaped. were they not going to run and wait for their deaths?

At this moment, they had already decided that once they returned, they would immediately lead all of their clansmen into the grotto-heaven blessed land.

Just like the Lightning race, they hid in the grotto-heaven blessed land.

They had lost. They had completely lost.

They had lost to the eldest senior brother of the Lightning race, and they had lost to a disciple of the lightning race.

To them, it was as if the heavens wanted to kill them on purpose.

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz

Their figures began to turn illusory rapidly and disappeared.

As they were quite far away, Wang Xian had no way to deal with them.

However, the four major forces were no longer imposing to Wang Xian. He could kill them as he pleased.

Compared to killing the four major forces, it was more worthwhile to make the figure in the black cloud pay the price.

A dark attribute innate numinous treasure.
