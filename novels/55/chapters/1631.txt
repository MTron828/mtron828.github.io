Chapter 1632: Invincible stance of 1632

“Kill the enemy!”

“Bang!”

A loud roar was heard. Carrying an invincible stance, the five elements grinding on top of his head and his feet stepping on the yin-yang Tai Chi.

Wang Xian waved his dragon claw heavily. A corpse was thrown directly towards the front of the army of 120,000 people in the vast area.

The Dark Mark Grandmaster, a newly advanced expert at level nine of the Seethrough realm in the Wuji Empire, was actually killed in an instant.

Furthermore, he was fighting against the other two patriarchs of the Wuji Empire at the same time.

In front of the entire dragon and Phoenix Empire, apart from Wang Xian, there was silence.

The corpse landed heavily in front of them, causing everyone to widen their eyes. Their eyes were filled with astonishment.

This was an expert from the Guardian clan of a level nine Seethrough expert. Now, he was actually killed directly.

In the past one thousand years, there were only two level nine Seethrough experts who died. And these two were all killed by the Sky Demon.

“The sky demon that has been resurrected seems to be even more terrifying than before!”

A terrified expression appeared on the faces of all the experts in the vast area.

To instantly kill a rank nine profound void martial expert, who could match such an invincible appearance?

No one present could match him.

This made them recall that eight months ago, the sky demon led his subordinates to charge into the headquarters of the lone sect and kill Patriarch Fengchi.

After this battle, the vast region was shaken. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

However, the Sky Demon was even more terrifying now.

“Kill!”

All the members of the Dragon Palace roared with excitement when they saw the Dragon King kill a level nine profound void martial expert.

“Ring, Ring, Ring!”

The Dolphin clan played the battle music, and all the Archers of the heavenly eye arrow division charged forward with their bows and arrows.

In the current Dragon Palace, there were more than 15,000 profound void martial experts, and only 5,000 disciples had yet to reach the profound void martial realm.

Even the weakest insightful void stage powerhouse could resist against a second level insightful void stage powerhouse.

As for the 120,000 troops in the vast region, the number of insightful void stage powerhouses was only about the same as the Dragon Palace.

However, with the addition of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire’s insightful void stage powerhouses, there were more than 20,000 insightful void stage powerhouses in the flowing sea region.

Just now, what was missing was the peak combat strength of the ninth level of the insightful void stage.

Now that Wang Xian had arrived, there was no lack of peak combat strength.

“Kill!”

When the seethrough-level members of the Dragon Palace flew down from Xiao Lan’s body, all the powerhouses in the vast area were stunned.

“How can they have so many powerhouses?”

“There are more than 10,000 of them. They also have more than 10,000 seethrough-level powerhouses. Oh My God, how can there be so many powerhouses in such a small flowing sea region!”

The 120,000-strong army trembled. At the strongest position, a group of profound void tier experts were resisting the arrows from the Heavenly Eye Arrow Division.

However, just as they thought that they could withstand the arrows, a wave of special sound waves suddenly transmitted into their minds, causing the bodies of the profound void tier experts to stiffen.

“Ahhhh!”

A miserable cry was emitted from the mouth of the profound void tier experts.

The Heavenly Eye Arrow Division had a thousand insightful void realm experts. With the help of the Dolphin clan, a round of arrows was shot down.

In addition, the arrows were smeared with the poison created by the eight-pointed commander. In an instant, two to three hundred insightful void realm experts were killed.

This was an extremely terrifying number!

“Face the enemy! Face the enemy! We are a majestic and vast region. Why would we be afraid of a tiny place like the flowing sea region? Kill!”

When the king of Wuji saw the sudden burst of combat power from the Dragon Palace and the Dragon and Phoenix Empire, everyone was shocked and shouted loudly.

“Next, it’s Your Turn!”

In the middle of the battlefield, Wang Xian looked at Patriarch Dark Eye and the other patriarch of Wuji Empire and said coldly.

In the sky, an invisible destructive power swept towards the two of them!

“Kill!”

The two patriarchs from the Wuji Empire had extremely gloomy expressions. They gritted their teeth and growled.

“Eye of Darkness!”

“Dark Storm!”

The two of them waved their arms and a terrifying dark light shot out from their eyes. The other one raised both his arms and the sky was instantly covered by darkness. Countless dark raindrops attacked Wang Xian.

“The two of you want to fight against me? !”

After the short clash just now, Wang Xian had a better understanding of his own strength.

The yin-yang Taiji below him spun and numerous shadowy shadows of the Taiji appeared around him.

The dark storm and the Eye of darkness landed on it, but they were all blocked outside.

The most powerful aspect of the great grinding of the five elements was healing and destruction.

The most powerful aspect of the yin-yang Taiji was its defense and concealment.

The Yin-yang dual polarity was activated. As long as the attack power did not exceed a certain level, it would be able to completely block outside.

“Suppress!”

As the attacks landed around him and were blocked, Wang Xian shouted softly.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

On the Five Elements Millstone, the five divine dragons of the five elements roared and pulled the five elements millstone. Streams of energy of the five elements formed a mountain and headed straight for the two of them.

The mountain peak, which was thousands of meters high and filled with the aura of destruction, looked extremely terrifying from a distance.

“Dark Mad Lion devours the sky!”

“Dark Mad Lion devours the sky!”

The two patriarchs of Wuji Dynasty waved their arms, and a 10,000-meter-wide head of the Dark Mad Lion appeared in front of them.

The Dark Mad Lion raised its head and opened its huge mouth, biting toward the huge mountain peak.

“Weng!”

A terrifying collision was heard, and the head of the Dark Lion, which was ten thousand meters long, trembled.

Following that, it slowly trembled under the impact of the mountain peak and gradually disappeared.

The mountain peak, which was filled with destructive aura, shook in the direction of the two patriarchs of the Wuji Empire.

“So Powerful!”

“Roar! Roar! Roar! Roar!”

The faces of the two patriarchs of the Wuji Empire changed drastically. Their mount, the Dark Lion, which was a level 8 insightful void tier, died under the impact of the five elements destructive power.

Their bodies were also sent flying for thousands of meters.

“Southern Emperor Jianghe, come and help us. We are no match for the Sky Devil. Quick, Quick!”

As the dark-eyed elder was sent flying, one of his palms was hit by the invisible destructive power, and two of his fingers disappeared immediately.

His pitch-black pupils were filled with fear as he shouted loudly.

“What?”

The two patriarchs of the southern royal family were working together to fight against Xiao Lan. When they heard the patriarch of the Wuji Empire’s plea for help, their expressions changed slightly.

Southern Royal Family’s Jianghe looked over uncertainly. He gestured to the other elder and flew over.

“With the three of us, kill the Skyfiend as soon as possible!”

Nangong Jianghe flew over and roared loudly.

“It’s enough that we can resist him, but you still want to kill him?”

Patriarch Dark Eye said with a gloomy face when he heard Nangong Jianghe’s words.

His gaze swept to the area below him, and his expression sank.

The power of the flowing sea region had completely exceeded their imagination.

Not only were the skyfiends invincible, but there were also experts who were invincible.

Sword Qi swept across several thousand meters. It was a ruthless and decisive golden swordfish.

The thunder prawns that held the Thunder Hammer and thunder spear covered in lightning.

The Deadly Arrows, the violent dark demon monkeys, and the dancing fiery red thorns...

In the battle against their 120,000-strong Army, they were actually at a complete advantage.

If it were not for the fact that they had more profound void tier 8 powerhouses, they would have been defeated by now!
