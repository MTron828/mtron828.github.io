Chapter 921: 0922 once again made a strong enemy

Translator: 549690339

“The first wave of monster siege has ended. Through the formation, we can clearly record the number of ferocious beasts killed. The corpses of the ferocious beasts will be distributed to everyone!”

“The second wave of monster siege will probably be in half an hour. Everyone, rest as soon as possible. There will be a new mission soon!”

On the city wall, Jin Qianyuan’s gaze swept across all the mercenary groups and said expressionlessly.

Although the first wave of attacks were perfectly resisted, he was still somewhat dissatisfied with the mercenary group’s civil war that occurred during the defense of the city.

However, he couldn’t say anything during this period of time.

After all, the mercenary group accepted the mission to defend the city. Defending the city wasn’t their responsibility, but the responsibility of the city guards.

Even if there was a civil war during the defense of the city, it was still the mercenary group’s own business.

The group of mercenary groups nodded with excitement. Hundreds of thousands of fierce beasts’corpses was definitely a terrifying income for them.

However, there were also some mercenary groups whose faces were extremely ugly.

In the first wave of attacks, although the fierce beasts’strength was relatively low, under the encirclement of many fierce beasts, they still lost five to six hundred people.

“We have a large number of recovery pills and healing pills. During the defense of the city today, all of them will be sold at a 10% discount!”

At this moment, a middle-aged man at the bottom of the city wall shouted loudly.

At the center of the city below, there was a huge temporary stall with densely packed medicinal pills on it.

A woman stood at the center of the stall with a hot figure and a smile on her face.

“Holy item forging workshop, weapons will be given a 10% discount during the defense period!”

A voice also came from the side. An old man was standing in the center, surrounded by more than a dozen salesmen.

“Pills, weapons, 10% discount. Welcome to buy!”

At the bottom of the city, the life and Death Pill Workshop, Holy Item Forging Workshop, Immortal Phoenix Pill and weapons workshop, and all the weapons shops and pharmacies in holy sea town had set up a temporary place to sell pills and weapons.

During the defense of the city, the demand for medicinal pills and weapons was relatively large. When the monsters attacked the city, these medicinal pills and weapon shops were likely to benefit the most.

A group of warriors from the mercenary group swarmed toward the weapon shops of the medicinal pills shop, buying all kinds of medicinal pills to prepare for the upcoming battle.

The three big medicinal pills and weapon workshops occupied the three most central positions. However, at this time, many people gathered in front of the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop. Only the Immortal Phoenix pill and weapon workshop did not have any people in front of it.

In front of the Immortal Phoenix pill and weapon workshop, more than ten members of the Knife Scar mercenary group stood at the side, coldly glancing at any cultivator who wanted to buy pills and weapons from the immortal Phoenix.

When all the mercenary groups saw this situation, they tactfully went to other pill and weapon shops to buy items.

Today, the knife scar mercenary group leader single-handedly killed fifteen extraordinary sixth grade fierce beasts, intimidating the entire battlefield. That invincible fighting strength made everyone fear him.

There was no need for them to offend the Dao Hen mercenary group.

If Dao Hen were to casually kill them as a warning to the others while they were defending the city, then they would be in deep trouble. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

As a result, not a single mercenary group came to purchase pills or weapons.

“Supervisor Yi, this is the situation!”

Manager Liu stood in front of the temporary stall and spoke to the woman beside him with a bitter expression.

“It’s the same as the situation in other places!”

The woman’s face was dark, and she looked very embarrassed.

The Immortal Phoenix pill and weapon workshop had been suppressed by the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging Workshop. It was not only holy sea town, but also many places.

Some places had started to fight back, but most of them were still very miserable.

The Life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop each had a foundation that was thousands or even tens of thousands of years old. It was absolutely not something that the immortal Phoenix, who had been established for more than two years, could resist.

Even if their empress had unparalleled talent.

However, this was still the empress from a thousand years ago. The current Empress needed time. She firmly believed that within a hundred years, their empress would once again be able to cry out to the nine heavens.

“Manager Yi, I do have a method that can solve the current predicament!”

Shopkeeper Liu hesitated for a moment and said to the woman.

“Oh? What method?”

A trace of surprise flashed in the woman’s eyes and she quickly asked.

“The main reason why others don’t dare to come to our Phoenix immortal to buy things is because of knife marks. If we can solve the knife marks mercenary group...”

A trace of coldness flashed in shopkeeper Liu’s eyes as he said in a low voice.

“Our Phoenix Immortal has already sent powerful people to solve this problem, but it’s not the turn of the holy sea town yet!”

The woman shook her head.

They had naturally thought of this method, and had even begun to implement it. However, they were dealing with the life and death pill workshop and the Saint Item Forging workshop.

This was a protracted battle, and it could not be solved just like that.

Moreover, many of the difficulties in the city had not been solved, and it was not Saint Sea Town’s turn.

If it were not for the fact that Saint Sea Town had suddenly sold nearly ten million middle-grade spirit stones in two days, she would not have come here.

“Shopkeeper Yi, I don’t mean to let our experts take action, but to let the assassin organization Take Action!”

Shopkeeper Liu said in a low voice.

“Assassin organization?”

The woman was slightly stunned as she looked at him.

“That’s right. In the past few days, an assassin organization has appeared in our holy sea town, Dragon Spike. In just a few short days, several transcendent rank 6 experts have died at their hands. The entire holy sea town is in a state of panic. Now, Dragon Spike is the underground king of Holy Sea Town. It’s said that even the undercurrents have retreated from holy sea town!”

“We can ask dragon spike to take action, but the price for assassinating a rank 7 transcendent might be...”

Shopkeeper Liu hesitated slightly. According to his understanding, Dragon Spike had assassinated a rank 6 transcendent and offered two million mid-grade spirit stones.

If he assassinated a rank 7 transcendent, it would be at least twenty million mid-grade spirit stones.

This price wasn’t high, because experts were worth this price.

In fact, if one were to offer this price, the other party might not even dare to accept it.

“Show me the information on the dragon Spike!”

The woman’s eyes flickered as she spoke to shopkeeper Liu.

“Alright!”

“We have nearly two million middle-grade spirit stones in our hands. We can sell them first to raise ao Jian’s strength. The strength of the Golden Swordfish is still too weak!”

Standing in front of the city gate, Wang Xian looked forward as he felt the respectful and curious gazes from the surrounding people.

Among all the temporary stalls for elixirs and weapons, only Feng Xian did not have anyone.

“It seems that the current situation of Feng Luan is not ideal either!”

Wang Xian smiled and walked toward the location of Feng Xian’s shop with a smile on his face.

In such a situation, Wang Xian had to make a move. Moreover, with the strength of the knife scar mercenary group, he was not afraid.

The strength of the dragon spike was sufficient to destroy the knife marks.

“Eh? Kid, don’t Court Death!”

Beside the Phoenix Immortal Shop, more than ten members of the knife marks mercenary group saw Wang Xian and the rest walking over. They stared at them coldly and warned them.
