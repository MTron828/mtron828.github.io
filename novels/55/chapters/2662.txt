“Kill!”

In front of the Abyss battlefield on the planet at the edge of the Northern line, over a million Northern line disciples clenched their teeth and fought with the abyss seeds in front of them with blood-red eyes.

The crisis on the demon island this time could be said to have affected everyone.

Those people who were originally on a peaceful planet were instantly broken.

No one could avoid going to the battlefield and fighting.

Some of the cowardly disciples had already fallen, and those who remained had experienced several wars.

Even so, every war was like dancing on the edge of a knife. No one knew if they could survive.

As long as they fought with all their strength, only by becoming stronger could they have a chance to survive.

Roars sounded one after another. Because of the alliance on the northern front, in terms of distribution, the strength of the humans was stronger than that of the abyssal seed.

This made it easier for them.

Even if it was easy, in a battle, 1 out of 10 would die.

“Sou Sou Sou!”

However at this moment, a piercing sound could be heard.

Some people and the abyss species were shocked, quickly looking to their right.

“This is?”

Everyone was shocked at the rain of arrows, some of them were shocked.

“Pu Pu Pu!”

However very quickly, a few relatively fast arrows pierced through the undying god Emperor level abyss seeds.

The warriors who were fighting against the Undying God Emperor Abyss seeds felt their faces burn, blood dripping onto their faces.

They stared blankly ahead.

“Howl Howl!”

A few of the stronger abyss seeds let out a scream before dying.

“PFFT! PFFT! PFFT!”

Before they could react too much, the abyssal seeds in front of them were pierced by arrows one by one.

The abyssal seeds that were still fierce just a moment ago all lost their voices in the next moment.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

At this moment, they heard a rumbling sound.

From Afar, they could see an incomparably huge mountain peak that was occupied by a divine dragon flying towards them.

On the mountain peak, there were two huge words: Dragon Peak.

“It’s Dragon Peak, Dragon Palace and the others.”

“So powerful, Dragon Palace and the others are so powerful!”

Exclamations and shocked voices rang out continuously, and everyone was shocked beyond words.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

Soon, Dragon Peak arrived not far from them, and the thorns instantly swept away all the abyss species’corpses.

“The Dragon Palace is so strong. The Dragon Palace is Awesome!”

“Hahaha, too awesome. Thank you for your help, experts of the Dragon Palace!”

Some of the experts and disciples couldn’t help but Roar in excitement.

Wang Xian stood on the command platform and the corner of his mouth curled up slightly.

The Dragon Peak didn’t waste any time dealing with the abyssal seeds on this side.

It was as simple as stepping on some ants while passing by.

Dragon Mountain continued to move forward!

Very quickly, he arrived at another battlefield, again, instant kill!

Dragon Mountain moved forward with unstoppable power.

Pushing horizontally!

“What’s the situation, your abyss species have been cleaned up by the Dragon Palace.”

A minute later, over 10 undying emperors swiftly flew over and saw the empty abyss.

Some of them had already returned to the outside of the Abyss and asked in shock.

“The Dragon Palace just passed by here and wiped them out. The Archers of the Dragon Palace are invincible.”

A warrior said excitedly as he welcomed over 10 of them.

“Rumble, with the power of the Dragon Palace, they should be able to wipe out all the abyss seeds at the edge. Let’s go, we’ll report the situation here to the Lords.”

The dozen or so god Emperors exchanged glances and silently flew out of the abyss.

The Dragon Palace only passed by them and swept through some of the abyss seeds...

“Howl Howl Howl!”

...

In the center, in front of the inviting moon planet, earth shattering roars resounded.

Compared to the edge, this was the meat grinder.

“Strange, the 4 Undying Level 9 abyss seeds didn’t attack, instead locking onto us!”

Within the Abyss, the 4 Undying Level 9 warriors from last month stood together, they stared at the 4 undying level 9 seeds from afar.

It was as though they were restricting the high level battle strength of both sides.

“It’s a little strange, however the stronger ones have higher intelligence, they might know that fighting us wouldn’t result in anything.”

The 4 of them floated in the air and locked onto the 4 undying level 9 seeds, preventing them from attacking.

“Leader, forefather!”

At this time, a silhouette flew over from behind and shouted at the 4.

“Speak!”

Last month’s leader spat out a word without turning.

...

“Leader forefather, there’s news from the edge of the Abyss, the Dragon Palace’s Dragon Mountain is flying towards us from the edge. Along the way, they’ve instantly killed over a dozen of the seeds on the battlefield, over 20 million of them have died in the hands of the Dragon Palace.”

“Over a dozen of our soldiers have been freed!”

The silhouette said to the sect leader and the others from last month.

“HM? They’ve cleared over a dozen battlefields so quickly?”

An ancestor said with slight surprise.

“They are very strong. According to the report from the soldiers guarding the last place, there were over 70 undying god Emperor level abyssal seeds. The remaining 2 million were instantly killed by the Dragon Palace’s archers, 2 million instantly killed.”

The middle aged man who reported was shocked.

“The Archers from the Dragon Palace are indeed powerful, the strength they used this time is much stronger than the previous times. This dragon palace isn’t simple.”

“Instantly killing over 70 abyss seeds and 2 million normal abyss seeds, the Dragon Palace should have sent over 10,000 god Emperor level warriors this time!”

The patriarchs of the great sect last month were also very surprised.

The strength that the Dragon Palace had sent out made them very surprised.

“Transfer the soldiers from those places to another place to provide support.”

The sect master of last month said.

“It’s the sect master!”

The middle-aged man who reported nodded and immediately flew out of the abyss.

“Roar!”

Suddenly, roars came from the front.

“HM?”

Last month’s leader and the rest were slightly shocked, immediately looking ahead.

“They are?”

The 4 looked over, shocked.

In the depths of the Abyss, the 4 undying Level 9 species turned their bodies and looked deeper into the abyss.

The 4 species roared simultaneously.

“Howl Howl Howl!”

“Ga Ga Ga!”

“Howl Howl!” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

At this time, smaller roars could be heard.

These roars weren’t lacking in power, they were too far away.

At least tens of billions of km away.

“Shit!”

“Not good, there’s a powerful abyss species coming from the depths!”

At this moment, the leader’s expression changed greatly as he stared seriously into the depths.

To be able to respond to the four undying level 9 abyss species, they must be of the same level.

In the depths, there were other abyss species of the same level flying over.

The four of them had ugly expressions!
