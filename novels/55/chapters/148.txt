“She will continue to have Elder Fang as her teacher!” Seeing Xiao Yu growing flustered, Wang Xian slowly stepped forward from the audience. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

He knew about the Thistles and Thorns Sect. The Sect Leader was a ninety-year-old man.

When he thought about Xiao Yu becoming the disciple of an old man, he preferred Elder Fang to him.

Besides, as Xiao Yu progressed with her cultivation, the Sect Leader would still be able to guide her. Moreover, Wang Xian would be around too.

“Who are you? This is not something you can poke your nose in. Hmph!” Upon hearing Wang Xian’s comment, Elder Zhou frowned and shouted at him.

“Brother!” Xiao Yu spun around and called him as soon as she heard his voice.

“Hur? Is he your brother?” The Elder Zhou was stunned, and her expression quickly changed. She observed Wang Xian from head to toe. “I wasn’t expecting you to be Xiao Yu’s brother. Not bad. Do you want to join the Thistles and Thorns Sect too? How about this? I’ll take you as my disciple and groom you.”

“Eh...” Wang Xian was speechless as he looked at the middle-aged woman. What a fence-sitter.

“Eh, he is...?”

At that point in time, a young man had stepped out suddenly and declared that he was Xiao Yu’s brother. All eyes were on him.

Those who wished to join the Thistles and Thorns Sect were all people from Pengzhou and Rivertown.

Among those were ancient martial artists from Rivertown who did not join any sects and they were not from any families as their strength was not strong enough. They were considered rogue cultivators.

Some of the rogue cultivators wanted their sons or grandchildren to join the Thistles and Thorns Sect for a better cultivation environment. At the same time, they could get themselves a strong backing. Hence, they brought their offspring here.

Wang Xian had been hiding in the crowd, and hence, no one recognized him.

But when he walked out, those who came from Rivertown recognized him immediately.

“He is here!”

Those rogue cultivators from Rivertown were struck by terror. Whatever happened that night was still vivid to them.

That young man led the Dragon Sect and trampled the Yan Family.

Since then, that terrifying Inborn Expert had cursed every one of them.

Whenever anyone wanted to talk about what happened that night, that person would die an immediate death.

A terrifying curse.

However, they did not mind about the curse as they had participated in that incident as well. They did it to ensure that no one would ever leak out the truth.

She’s the younger sister of the Dragon King. No wonder she has the Inborn Constitution, those rogue cultivators from Rivertown thought to themselves. They walked towards Wang Xian, ignoring all the strange looks cast on them.

“Greetings to the Dragon King!” Dozens of middle-aged old men brought their children over to Wang Xian respectfully and greeted him.

The one over here is the real king. What is Thistles and Thorns Sect to him?

“Isn’t he the Miracle Doctor Wang?”

Not only were those rogue cultivators from Rivertown stunned, but those wealthy people who had some connections were also stunned when they saw Wang Xian.

They might not know what had happened to the Yan Family, but they knew the miracle doctor of Rivertown, Miracle Doctor Wang.

It was said that Miracle Doctor Wang had the ultimate skills in Rivertown, and that even Old Qin and the Qin Family had to treat him politely.

Besides, there were those affluent people who attended the Qin Family’s dinner that night too.

Hence, they did not hesitate at all when they saw the rogue cultivators go up to him and greet him.

“Miracle Doctor Wang!” Another dozen people came to Wang Xian and greeted him with humility too.

This had caused the people from Thistles and Thorns Sect and Pengzhou to be dumbfounded.

“What’s with those from Rivertown? Why are they so respectful to that young man?”

“Dragon King? Miracle Doctor Wang? What a title!”

“Those who are here are somewhat capable people. Yet, they are so respectful to that young man. Who is he? What sort of background does he have?”

“Mm.” Wang Xian looked at those people from the Rivertown, nodded his head slightly and waved them off.

The rogue cultivators and the rich did utter a word and returned to their original spots.

“Gosh!”

“This....”

What did it feel like when some courtiers were paying their respects to their king?

Unbelievable, unbelievable.

All the Pengzhou people were taken aback as they wondered how formidable this young man was, making these people back off with just a gesture.

The higher management of the Thistles and Thorns Sect were staring at Wang Xian with disbelief too. Even Vice Sect Leader Lei showed a doubtful look in his eyes.

“Elder Song, I asked you to check on the information from Rivertown...”

“Vice Sect Leader Lei, I remember! It’s him. So it’s him!”

Elder Song suddenly interrupted Vice Sect Leader Lei as he continued with a shocked face. “According to the info that we got, there was a mysterious young man known as Miracle Doctor Wang in Rivertown. He defeated Fang Huazi, who was ranked 18th in the domestic Miracle Doctors Chart easily with his medical skills. At the same time, he crippled Fang Huazi’s arms. Also, we found out that all the Ancient Martial Artist Families in Rivertown share a close relationship with this young man. When we wanted to dig deeper, we couldn’t find any further information.”

“Now he operates a medical hall in Rivertown. He charges a high consultation fee and is known as the Crazy Doctor. In Rivertown, it is said that he can treat all illnesses!”

Elder Song swept a glance at Wang Xian with radiance flickering in his eyes as he spoke with some shock.

“Miracle Doctor Wang in the Rivertown? I’ve heard of him. He defeated the Sacred Followers Guild, which goes to show that he is formidable!” another elder said with a solemn face.

Xiao Yu was among them as she listened to their remarks about her brother. Her lips were slightly parted, as she did not expect her brother would be so powerful.

“A miracle doctor is equivalent to a sect!” Vice Sect Leader Lei said slowly, and everyone was struck with complex thoughts.

Indeed. A miracle doctor is equivalent to a sect.

Those miracle doctors on the Miracle Doctors Chart would have a strong network. They could even get a Half-step to Inborn Martial Artist over if they asked for it.

The Inborn Experts could even owe those better doctors a considerable favor.

With the strength that could defeat Fang Huazi from the Sacred Followers Guild, and also being ranked 18th on the Miracle Doctor Chart...this was good enough for the Thistles and Thorns Sect to be wary of.

“I did not expect Xiao Yu’s brother was such a famous person.” Radiance flickered in Elder Fang’s eyes. The disciple whom she’d discovered accidentally had a more profound and more terrifying background.

“Xiao Yu’s brother is Miracle Doctor Wang. I’m sorry that I didn’t recognize you!” Vice Sect Leader Lei had a change in his expression. He cupped his fist at Wang Xian and spoke politely.

“It’s fate.” Wang Xian smiled. “I did not expect Elder Fang to take in my sister as her disciple all of a sudden.”

“You should know that Xiao Yu has the Inborn Constitution!” Vice Sect Leader Lei said hesitantly.

“Of course, I know. I thought she could begin her cultivation at a later stage. But since she’s happy about it, I’ll just let her be.” Wang Xian nodded his head. “Besides, I also learned about Thistles and Thorns Sect. You have some good reviews.”

Vice Sect Leader Lei and the rest of the elders felt uncomfortable about what Wang Xian had said.

Obviously, Wang Xian had checked on the Thistles and Thorns Sect.

However, they got over it very soon. After all, his sister had joined a sect out of the blue. As her brother, it was natural for him to find out more.

If they thought further, having Xiao Yu with such a powerful brother would be extremely beneficial to the Thistles and Thorns Sect.
