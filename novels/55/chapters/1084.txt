“Get ready for battle!”

“Get ready for battle!”

“Get ready for battle!”

At the same time, roars could be heard from the four city gates of Shenghai Town.

The ferocious beasts were already in front of them. The battle had begun!

The people of Shenghai town heaved a sigh of relief. The West Gate and the south gate had the fewest ferocious beasts.

Shenghai town had a defensive formation. Under the formation, the weak ferocious beasts could not break through the city gates and enter the town.

“Long-range attack, Kill!”

At the North Gate, Wang Xian looked at the ferocious beasts one thousand meters away and ordered loudly.

“Kill!”

An earth-shattering sound of killing rang out. Everyone who was standing on the city wall of Shenghai town was blushing red. Everyone raised their staffs.

Dense energy gathered towards the city wall.

Red Flames, blue water swords, green wind blades...

Long-range attacks covered the thorny wood demon thousands of meters away.

It was overwhelming.

Although the people of holy sea town were relatively weak, there were more people guarding the city.

Among 1.7 million to 800,000 people, 400,000 to 500,000 had reached transcendence.

Among them, there were nearly 100,000 who were above transcendence level one.

There were also tens of thousands of people at the north gate.

The attacks launched by tens of thousands of people also caused great damage to the thorn wood demons.

The thorn wood demons were the first wave of ferocious beasts that came to seek death. Most of them were at level two or three of the extraordinary realm.

“Continue, don’t Stop!”

Wang Xian stood in the air and commanded loudly.

After a round of attacks, at least tens of thousands of thorn wood demons were killed.

However, these thorn wood demons were fearless as they attacked Shenghai Town.

The attacks on the city wall continued. In just 20 seconds, 70,000 to 80,000 thorny wood demons’corpses had fallen in front of them.

However, at this moment, the thorny wood demons had also charged over.

The thorny wood demons had two black legs, and their upper bodies were strangely shaped like tree demons.

The thorny wood demons at the back were slightly stronger than the ones who had just sent themselves to their deaths, and they were usually around rank 3.

“Use supportive attacks and supernatural powers on the Warriors at the front. Charge!”

When the wood devil was five hundred meters away from the city wall, Wang Xian ordered loudly.

“Yes!”

A group of warriors who were good at supportive attacks stood at the bottom of the city wall and immediately charged at the Warriors at the front. They released supportive energy onto their bodies.

“Charge!”

The five to six thousand warriors charged at the wood devil without any hesitation. They held their weapons in their hands and charged at the wood devil at the front.

Each of them had water currents and earth armor buffs on their bodies, allowing their combat strength to far exceed their usual level.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

At this moment, the 11 golden swordfish did not hesitate at all and directly charged towards the center of the formation.

Charge into the formation and break the formation of the ferocious beasts!

11 golden swords descended from the sky and directly opened up an empty space in the group of ferocious beasts.

With a single strike, at least five to six thousand thorny wood demons were killed.

“Kill!”

The people from Shenghai town also clashed with the thorny wood demons. Rays of sword rays slashed forward.

The thorny wood demons waved their arms and numerous thorns attacked the experts from Shenghai Town.

The bitter battle began!

Wang Xian stood in the sky and watched the battle quietly. This was only the first wave of ferocious beasts. He didn’t make a move but watched the entire battlefield.

As the battle progressed, the people of Shenghai town below relied on the support of the people behind them and their own powerful strength to kill the Thorn Wood Demons one by one.

The thorn wood demons fell one after another.

“If Yinxuan is here, with her special sound wave support, I’m afraid this group of ferocious beasts wouldn’t dare to attack!”

Wang Xian stood in the sky and thought of the powerful sound wave support from Tang Yinxuan and the Dolphins.

That kind of support came from the mind. Not only could it increase one’s strength, but it could also reduce the enemy’s attacks.

The group of people below the city wall didn’t have any professional training support. On the contrary, they were much weaker.

“Huh?”

Wang Xian looked down and moved his arm slightly.

At the spot where he placed it, a middle-aged man was fighting against the Dozen Wood Devils in front of him.

A thorn fell on his body, causing him to stagger. The Earth armor that was supporting him from the back was directly destroyed.

His expression changed slightly. However, at this moment, a thorn suddenly appeared from behind and attacked his chest.

His expression changed drastically, and despair appeared in his eyes. “It’s over!”

“Bang!”

However, at this moment, a wooden shield floated in front of him, completely blocking his body.

He was slightly stunned, and hope of surviving appeared on his face. He sensed the source of the energy and raised his head, his face filled with gratitude.

“Thank you, Commander Wang, for saving my life!”

He roared and continued to fight with a face full of fighting spirit.

Fight! Fight!

Wang Xian stood in the sky. The lightning struck wood in his hand would point downwards from time to time and release wooden shields.

“Thank you, sir, for saving my life!”

“Haha, Thank You, Sir. Fight!”

In a war, especially a war against 100,000 or even 100,000 ferocious beasts, one would die if one was not careful. This was a very normal situation.

However, with the terrifying insight of the light and Dark Fire Dragon Eyes in the sky, Wang Xian was able to detect the people who were in danger in time.

At the moment, Wang Xian had the void interpretation level lightning strike wood in his hand. If he wanted to release the wood shield to help them defend, he could do it in an instant.

Therefore, every life-threatening person was saved easily by Wang Xian. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Commander Wang is so awesome. He is able to control the entire battlefield while standing in the sky. He is able to accurately save every life-threatening person!”

“He is too strong. Such terrifying control over his strategy. Commander Wang is simply too amazing. Not a single one of our men died!”

“I’m impressed. He is really too awesome. With commander Wang around, we are really lucky. We can withstand any kind of ferocious beasts attacking the city!”

“Lord Wang and his men are also very powerful. They have already killed 20,000 to 30,000 ferocious beasts!”

On the city wall, the people of holy sea town were excited when they saw this scene.

They felt that as long as Wang Xian was here, holy sea town would definitely be able to defend itself.

Jin Qianyuan stood on the city wall and looked at Wang Xian in shock.

Standing in the void, he could save the people who almost died with just a casual touch. This kind of control gave him a feeling of being able to dominate the world.

He could not do this at all.

Perhaps only an expert at the insightful void level could do this!

However, at this moment, the battle continued at the East Gate, West Gate, and south gate.

However, the situation there was a little more intense. Even if the cavalry squadron was at the East Gate, they were still facing the place where the attacks were the fiercest.

They suffered heavy losses. In the first wave of attacks, they had lost at least a few hundred people.

Although a few hundred people weren’t much, this was only the beginning, the weakest beginning!
