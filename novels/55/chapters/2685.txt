2686 2686 Dragon Palace vs Tianya

“Eh?”

The middle-aged man ran over in panic. Patriarch Tianya and the Hierarch on the Tianya ruler looked at the middle-aged man and frowned slightly.

“Little Lan, what’s the matter?”

An elder who knew the middle-aged man asked him.

“Elder Mu, hierarch, Patriarch, My Grandpa might have fallen. He might have fallen.”

“This is the amulet my grandfather gave me. Grandfather said that as long as he didn’t die, it wouldn’t break. Now, the amulet is broken.”

The middle-aged man looked at Sect Master Horizon and the others with a panicked expression.

He held the pendant in his hand, and his expression kept changing.

The old man called Elder Mu’s expression changed. He immediately appeared beside the middle-aged man and reached out to take the pendant from his hand.

“It is indeed a life-saving weapon made by elder Lan for his descendants. However, elder Mu’s aura is no longer on it.”

Elder Mu’s expression changed slightly as he looked at the sect leader and the others.

“What? Elder Lan is dead. weren’t they still here just now? How could they be dead? Aren’t they...”

An Elder’s expression suddenly changed as he said, “Did something bad happen to them?”

The sect master, the Patriarch, and the others’expressions also changed slightly.

One of the elders immediately took out his AI and sent a series of messages, but after a few seconds, there was no reply.

The four elders did not reply at all.

“Patriarch!”

In the surroundings, the elders and the sect master stared at the two patriarchs solemnly.

The four bright elders had not returned after looking for elder Yao, and now they were suspected to have fallen. To be able to cause them to fall so quickly, they had yet to sense that the other party’s strength was definitely not simple.

“Damn it. With elder Lan and the other two’s strength, even if they were in danger, they would still cause a huge commotion. How could they fall so quickly?”

“All disciples, get ready. Everyone, immediately head to the left to investigate. Once you find the murderer, dismember him into Ten Thousand Pieces!”

The two patriarchs’faces revealed an incomparably intense baleful aura as they roared furiously.

“Horizon Ruler!”

Sect Master Horizon waved his arm and a wave of energy fused with the horizon ruler!

“All Disciples, prepare for battle!”

Following that, sect master horizon let out a fierce roar as his voice spread throughout everyone’s mind.

“Oh? What Happened?”

“What’s going on? weren’t all the abyssal seeds in the Abyss slaughtered?”

On the horizon ruler, some of the uninformed disciples revealed astonished expressions.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

The horizon ruler flew toward the left at a terrifying speed.

“Patriarch, if elder Ruolan and the others are really dead, the only force on the left that can do it is the Dragon Palace.”

An elder stood in front of the horizon ruler with a gloomy face and said to the two patriarchs.

“Dragon Palace!”

The two patriarchs narrowed their eyes, which were flashing with violent killing intent.

A total of 5 elders had disappeared, to them, it was a huge loss.

In the entire world, they only had 15 undying level 9 warriors.

No matter which faction it was, as long as they killed the 5 elders, it would be irreconcilable.

“Eh? What happened to the world margin sect? Why is there such a strong killing intent?”

“What’s going on with the horizon great sect? Why are they charging towards the left with such an imposing manner?”

“Get all the disciples to prepare for battle? What’s going on?”

At this moment, the experts and disciples of the Nine Heavens Great sect who were at the side heard a voice filled with killing intent. When they saw them charging towards the left, they were slightly startled.

Horizon and nine heavens were fighting against the abyssal seed at the center. It could be said that there was no gap between them.

Both sides could clearly see each other’s situation.

The great change on Tian Ya’s side immediately attracted jiu Xiao’s attention.

“Why are they flying to the left? Come, Let’s go and take a look.”

The two Jiu Xiao forefathers slightly raised their eyebrows and said with sparkling eyes.

They had already killed all the abyssal seeds on their side, so nothing happened.

Since the world margin great sect was acting so strangely, Jiu Xiao naturally had to pay attention to it.

“Whoosh!”

Following that, a group of Jiu Xiao powerhouses and disciples immediately flew to the left.

On the right, the heaven-severing great sect had also finished off the abyssal seeds in the abyss. As the host, some of their disciples had sensed the situation of the two great sects at the center and did not hesitate, immediately, a group of experts came to investigate.

“All Disciples, surround Dragon Peak!”

...

The speed of the horizon ruler was very fast, and the distance between the two sides was not very far to begin with.

Looking at the towering and enormous dragon peak in front of them, Patriarch Horizon immediately ordered coldly.

“Yes!”

The other experts and disciples were slightly startled.

“Surround!”

However, the seven elders immediately took the lead and commanded everyone.

“Follow the elders.”

In the next moment, the experts from the world margin stopped them and immediately followed the elders and surrounded the dragon palace.

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz

Without any hesitation, the world margin patriarch flew out of the world margin ruler.

The two of them floated in the sky.

...

“Dragon Palace!”

An angry roar came from one of the elders as he stared coldly at the enormous dragon peak.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

In the surrounding area, elder Tianya and tens of millions of disciples surrounded the Dragon Palace. Their faces were filled with killing intent.

“Hehe!”

On the command platform, Wang Xian naturally knew about the people from the Tianya sect who were rushing over.

As expected, even if the Dragon Palace didn’t attack them, the other party would still attack them.

“Everyone from the Heaven’s end sect, May I know why you are here?” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly and asked despite knowing the answer.

To start a war at the time of the invasion of the Abyss, one had to be justified.

Otherwise, it would incur the wrath of the public and affect the actions of the Dragon Palace.

“Did you kill elder Lan and the other five from the Heaven’s end sect?”

Patriarch world margin locked his gaze on Wang Xian and questioned him coldly.

“HMM? What’s going on? The world margin sect is here to besiege the Dragon Palace? This... The Dragon Palace killed an elder of the world margin sect?”

“Hiss, what exactly happened? Why did the world margin sect have a conflict with the Dragon Palace?”

At the back, Jiu Xiao and the other experts and disciples who followed them saw the scene in front of them. When they heard Patriarch World Margin’s voice, they were slightly shocked.

Why did these two forces suddenly start fighting? !

At the rear, the experts from the heaven-severing sect also rushed over. They were also surprised when they saw this scene.

“Eh? What’s going on?”

On the left, the sect master patriarch and the others who had received the report from the six experts had also rushed over last month and happened to see this scene.

Their expressions changed, and they were somewhat solemn and embarrassed.

“Dragon King, I’m asking you a question. Did you kill 50 to 60 powerhouses from the five elders of the world margin sect?”

The world margin sect master stared at Wang Xian and questioned him coldly again.

His tone was filled with coldness.

“Everyone from the world margin sect, let’s talk this out nicely. There must be some misunderstanding.”

The sect master of last month gulped and spoke after a moment of hesitation.
