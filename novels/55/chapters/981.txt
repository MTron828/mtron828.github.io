Chapter 982: 0983, breaking through the main peak

Translator: 549690339

The group of people watched the group of experts from the young master’s mercenary group enter. After packing up their things, they also walked towards the Thunder Island.

The Thunder Fruits were their mission item this time around. If they could obtain a few thunder fruits, their trip here wouldn’t have been in vain.

As for that new student, they could already predict the outcome.

Wang Xian entered the Thunder Island and sized up his surroundings with his bewitching gaze.

The Thunder Island was a little dark. If it wasn’t for the occasional lightning bolts falling from the sky, the surrounding area would be pitch black.

Due to the thunderstorm and rainy weather, the island was filled with water all year round. The seawater under his feet reached his knees.

Around him were black thunder-struck trees.

The lightning trees were not very tall. Each of them was about seven to eight meters tall and more than ten meters tall. Their branches and leaves were not very luxuriant.

“There are thunderfish running around on the Lightning Island. They are like lightning. Even the weakest one is at level three of transcendence!”

“The thunder fruits grow on the thunder vines. Ordinary Thunder fruits can reach level five of transcendence. There must be a thunderfish guarding each of the Thunder Fruits!”

Wang Xian recalled the information he had read and scanned his surroundings.

The Thunder Island was very large, with a radius of 50 meters.

Crackle! Crackle

At this moment, a bolt of lightning suddenly struck toward his position in the sky.

Wang Xian leaped and avoided his previous position.

“Let’s go and search for the ferocious beasts and thunder fruits!”

The corners of Wang Xian’s mouth curled up slightly as he spoke to the members of the Dragon Palace around him.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Everyone followed behind Wang Xian and flew forward rapidly.

Wang Xian, who was flying in the sky, scanned his surroundings with his dragon eyes of light and dark fire.

“Seven hundred meters away, there are two thunderfish, one is at level three and one is at level four transcendence!”

Wang Xian looked to his left and pointed with his arm!

Just as he finished his words, the two golden swordfish moved and attacked the left in an instant.

Eleven Golden Swordfish at level four of the extraordinaire could definitely fight against a level five extraordinaire.

The two ferocious beasts below level five of the extraordinaire were instantly killed by them. Their corpses were directly stored in the interspatial ring.

“Three Thunder Beasts, two level three extraordinaires, and one level four extraordinaire!”

Wang Xian continued to fly forward. He pointed with his arm and spoke again.

The three golden swordfish charged forward directly.

After entering the Thunder Island, which made everyone cautious, Wang Xian was like an emperor. He pointed with his arm and the Warriors of the Dragon Palace charged forward instantly.

One by one, the ferocious beasts were killed easily.

“According to the information, the closer to the center, the more Thunder Beasts there will be, and the stronger they will be!”

“There will even be thunder fish at level seven or eight of the supernatural realm on the mountain peak. As for whether there are existences at level nine of the supernatural realm or even stronger, I don’t know!”

Wang Xian raised his head and looked towards the center. There was a huge mountain peak that went straight into the clouds.

This mountain peak was shrouded in lightning all year round. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Thunderfish could only become stronger by absorbing lightning. The Thunder Fruit was also born from lightning.

The location of the mountain peak was the most dangerous place on the Thunder Island.

“Head towards the center and break through the main peak!”

Wang Xian moved his body and scanned his surroundings.

The light and dark fire dragon eyes could scan an area of about 1,500 meters in this environment. This distance was sufficient!

“There are five Thunderfish in front, two are at transcendent level three and three are at transcendent level four!”

Wang Xian said directly as he flew forward and swept his gaze forward.

The Golden Swordfish started to move and so did the strange demons that were hiding in the void.

By the time Wang Xian reached there, the five Thunderfish had already been dealt with.

As they continued to move forward, they encountered more and more thunderfish, and they became stronger and stronger.

Soon, Wang Xian and the rest arrived at the center of the island, at the foot of the huge mountain peak.

“Thunder Fruit!”

Just as they arrived at the side of the mountain peak, Wang Xian saw a purplish-red vine lying on top of the mountain peak with a purplish-red fruit on it.

The fruit was flickering with traces of lightning and looked extremely mystical.

“This is a fruit of level five transcendence. Only by obtaining the lightning fruit can I complete the mission!”

Wang Xian revealed a faint smile as his gaze swept across the surroundings of the lightning fruit.

As expected, not far away from the lightning fruit, there were two lightning fishes of level five transcendence lying beside it.

The lightning fishes had four limbs. Their scales were flickering with lightning and could release lightning attacks.

The Lightning of the Thunder Beast was extremely terrifying. Without sufficient countermeasures, it would be extremely miserable.

Without needing Wang Xian to speak, Ao Jian, Ao Yao, and the rest attacked directly.

In addition to the 21 odd demons of Ao Yao, their combat strength was at least at level six transcendence. Against two level five transcendents, they could be killed in an instant!

Wang Xian grabbed the thunder fruit with his arm.

Thunder fruit: level five of the supernatural realm

Extractable Dragon Energy: 25 Dragon Crystals

“A level five of the supernatural realm thunder fruit is equivalent to a level four of the supernatural realm elixir. The amount that can be extracted is really small!”

Wang Xian waved his arm and placed the thunder fruit into his interspatial ring.

He raised his head and looked at this huge mountain peak that was five to six thousand meters tall. A smile appeared on his face. “There should be quite a number of thunder fruits on this mountain peak!”

Wang Xian moved his body and flew straight up. He scanned his surroundings with his ocular skill.

Crackle! Crackle! Crackle

When he had just reached a height of a hundred meters, a few hundred bolts of lightning came from the mountain peak.

A large number of bolts of lightning enveloped Wang Xian and the rest.

“Eh? So many!”

Wang Xian revealed a look of surprise. “Let’s do it!”

He shouted softly and attacked the surrounding thunderfish.

The density of the thunderfish on the mountain peak was beyond his imagination.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

Wang Xian waved his arm. The dense wood attribute instantly caused some of the thunderstruck trees on the mountain peak to elongate crazily as they attacked the thunderfish one by one.

More than ten extraordinary level five thunderfish were instantly bound by the thunderstruck trees.

Wang Xian clenched his arm and the thunderstruck trees immediately strangled the thunderfish to death.

“Be careful!”

Wang Xian reminded Ao Jian and the rest.

With his Dragon Eyes of light and dark fire, he realized that there were more than a hundred thunderfish within a thousand meters.

The density of the thunderfish made Wang Xian feel a little troubled.

However, with Ao Yao and the rest around, he did not cower.

Ao Yao, who was at level nine extraordinary, was fearless unless he encountered two or more thunderfish above level nine extraordinary.

“There are two thunder fruits over there!”

Wang Xian easily killed more than ten thunderfish. He looked up and flew towards the two thunder fruits.

Crackle! Crackle

At this moment, a large area of lightning appeared around him and attacked him.

On the Dark Mountain Peak, the thunderfish that were flashing with lightning stared at him fiercely.

“The bottom and the top of the mountain peak are like two different worlds. The top of the mountain peak is too dangerous!”

Wang Xian moved his body and flames instantly covered his entire body.

The lightning that covered an area of 1,000 meters flashed around him, causing one’s scalp to turn numb.

“There’s a battle happening on the Central Mountain Peak. What’s going on? Could someone have gone there?”

“The main peak of the Thunder Island is the most dangerous place. Even a level seven or eight supernatural realm expert might die there. However, there are a lot of thunder fruits there!”

“Let’s not worry about thunder fruits, let’s find that kid first, after killing him, we can look for Thunder Fruits!”
