Chapter 1433: On the 1433 order

The entire hall was divided into seventy to eighty regions, and each region had a main seat.

The region where Wang Xian and Feng Luan were located was behind the various family forces in the blood flow empire.

In terms of the various dynasty and sect forces, their seats were at the very front.

Along with them was the heavenly sword sect. Feng Luan looked at this seat and slightly raised her brows.

One by one, the factions walked into the main hall. Soon, all the seats in the main hall were filled.

There were about one to two thousand people.

Beside each dynasty and faction, the flags of their respective factions were hung.

At a glance, it encompassed all the factions in the entire Liuhai region.

Wang Xian scanned his surroundings slightly. He had a rough understanding of the factions in the entire Liuhai region.

Feng Luan, the sect Master of the Heaven Sword Sect, the sect master of the Blood Stream sect, and the king of the Light Dragon Dynasty looked at each other and nodded.

“The Emperor has arrived! The crown prince has arrived!”

Just as all the dynasties and sects in the hall were sizing up everyone around them, a eunuch’s voice came from the front. “Eunuch!”.

Everyone looked forward and landed on the three old men and the middle-aged man in blood-red clothes.

The two old men each held two scepters and followed behind the middle-aged man.

The old man’s eyes did not seem to open. His large red robe completely enveloped his body.

The middle-aged man in blood-red clothes behind him slightly raised his head. His face was filled with an aura of looking down on the world.

He glanced disdainfully at everyone in the hall. His gaze paused on the dragon-phoenix dynasty for a moment, and his face was filled with a faint smile.

“Emperor, those two old men are two emperors. They were once the Blood Emperor!”

“Only experts at the sixth level of the profound void tier are qualified to be called emperors. Those two old men were once the emperors of the blood flow empire.”

“The middle-aged man behind is the Crown Prince of the blood flow empire. I heard that he has reached the fifth level of the profound void tier at the age of 400!”

“I heard that this generation’s blood emperor did not rush over due to some matters. Everything today will be handed over to the crown prince of the blood flow empire to carry out.”

“Too strong, simply too strong. From Afar, I can feel a terrifying pressure from the two elders. It makes one’s heart palpitate!”

When they saw the three people walk over proudly, everyone’s faces revealed an astonished expression. They discussed in low voices.

“Your Majesty, Your Highness the Crown Prince!”

In the front row, the experts from some of the forces and clans within the blood flow empire stood up respectfully and bowed as they shouted.

“Your Majesty, Your Highness the Crown Prince!”

In the back row, some kings and experts stood up and cupped their hands.

These were the subordinate forces of the blood flow empire.

As the only region in the blood flow region, the subordinate forces of the blood flow empire were very terrifying. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Everyone has come from afar. It’s been hard on You!”

The middle-aged crown prince walked to the center seat and waved his hand with a smile.

The two old men beside him sat on one chair on the left and the other on the right.

The height of the two chairs was very high, even higher than the chair behind the middle-aged man.

“Are all the forces here?”

The middle-aged crown prince asked an old man beside him indifferently.

“Your Highness, I’m Sorry We’re Late!”

At this moment, two teams walked over from outside the door.

In front of each team was a middle-aged man holding a flag with the words ‘holy item forging workshop’and ‘Life and Death Pill Workshop’written on it!

The two teams didn’t sit at the back, but on both sides of the two emperors and the middle-aged crown prince.

Even these two forces were qualified to sit at these two places.

“I represent the entire Liuhai region to thank you for coming to the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging Workshop!”

The middle-aged man smiled and nodded at them.

“Haha!”

The old man in front of the two forces smiled and sat on his seat.

“Reporting to your highness, the Xilai Kingdom and the lantern soul sect have not arrived!”

At this moment, the old man held a booklet in his hand and said with a frown.

“Today, all the forces of the Liuhai region have been summoned. It is related to the safety of the entire Liuhai Region!”

“To resist the foreign forces, we must first pacify the domestic forces!”

The middle-aged crown prince slowly sat on the chair. “Those two forces that didn’t come might become our traitors in the future. Hehe!”

“Any unstable factors can not exist. Destroy them!”

To resist the foreign forces, we must first pacify the domestic forces!

And the best way to pacify the domestic forces was to destroy them.

“It’s Your Highness the Crown Prince. We already have two lords bringing people over!”

The old man nodded.

The middle-aged crown prince’s order caused everyone around to take a deep breath as their eyes flickered.

This was the Bloodflow Empire’s tyranny!

Once the flag of the world was out, if they didn’t come, they would die!

This wasn’t the prestige and tyranny that had been accumulated over a day or two.

It was the prestige that an invincible force should have.

“Today, our bloodflow empire gathered all the forces in the Liuhai region. Everyone should be very clear about this!”

“The Demon Beast Clan wants to establish an empire. All along, the Demon Beast Clan has had more experts than us. Based on the hatred that exists between us humans and the demon beasts in the human-demon graveyard!”

“Once their empire is established and all the forces are unified, the Peace of US humans will no longer exist!”

“The cruel blood savage demon beasts are the natural enemies of humans. We absolutely can not let the demon beasts establish an empire. We must stop them at all costs!”

The middle-aged crown prince swept his gaze across everyone and said indifferently.

“All of our dynasties will listen to the orders of the blood flow empire. Your Highness, what do you think we should do?”

A king of a subordinate dynasty of the blood flow empire respectfully said from below.

“That’s right. We will listen to the blood flow empire and listen to your orders. We absolutely can not allow the demon beast clan to unify!”

Another dynasty also spoke up.

All the factions understood this matter and they had to stop it. Otherwise, it would be a bomb to the various dynasty factions in the bloodflow region.

“Good, our Bloodflow Empire already has a plan for this matter. We’ll take the initiative to attack. We definitely can not let the Demon Beast race establish an empire!”

The middle-aged crown prince stood up, and his sonorous voice entered everyone’s ears.

“This time, our blood flow empire will lead all the forces in the flowing sea region to deal a heavy blow to the Demon Beast Clan!”

“Everyone, don’t worry. During this war with the demon beasts, the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop will provide us with a large number of pills and weapons!”

As he spoke, he looked at the two powerful forces on both sides, the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging Workshop.

The elders from the two factions nodded slowly.

“Crown prince bloodflow, I would like to ask how many people each of our factions needs to send out, and how to fight!”

At this moment, the Sky Sword Sect’s sect master spoke slowly.

“The Sky Sword Sect’s sect master’s question is good. For the sake of fairness, each faction will send out one-third of the insightful emptiness realm experts.”

“As for how to fight, it is naturally for our bloodflow empire to formulate a plan!”

The middle-aged crown prince said as if it was a matter of course.
