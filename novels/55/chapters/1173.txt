Translator: 5496903

Feng Luan had spent a lot of effort for this auction.

It was a huge auction house. As for the items that were being auctioned, they were rare treasures.

Among them, the most precious one was Wang Xian’s Demon Beast bloodline of the first level of the Seethrough Void Tier, followed by the half-step Seethrough Void Tier Demon Beast bloodline.

Other than these two bloodlines, there were also weapons and elixirs of the Seethrough void tier.

In addition, in order to attract the top-notch experts of the transcendence realm, Feng Luan took out over a hundred sets of half-step Seethrough void tier and ninth level transcendence set weapons.

All of them were top-notch sets.

Apart from the set weapons, there were also various top-notch elixirs of the transcendence realm that were sent over by the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan.

A total of several thousand items had been auctioned off.

It was also because of so many treasures that they were able to attract so many experts.

“HMPH, he dares to establish a dynasty on his own with just a small city. How arrogant!”

At the east entrance of the Dragon Phoenix Imperial City, seven to eight youths rode on the four-meter-long thunder leopard and entered the Dragon Phoenix Imperial City.

In the center, a fiery-red haired youth saw the recruitment at the entrance and revealed a cold expression. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Hehe, the city protection array in the dragon-phoenix royal city can not be compared to many royal cities. Furthermore, the scale of this auction is so large that this dynasty is not simple!”

Beside the fiery-red haired youth, a skinny girl sized up the surroundings and commented with a smile.

“What’s so special about a small place!”

The fiery-red-haired youth revealed a cold expression, his face full of disdain.

“Hehe, Xing Tianyi, this place seems to have once been the domain of your star-moon kingdom!”

A youth in front turned his head and said with a slight sneer.

“A small town is nothing to our star-moon kingdom!”

Xing Tian’s expression darkened, and he said nothing more with a cold expression.

“Roar Roar!”

Right at this moment, the low roars of fierce beasts suddenly sounded from behind them.

“Ah-fu!”

The seven to eight young men sitting on the Howler Leopards let out a low roar. They were clearly a little frightened.

It was as if they had met their natural enemy.

“Haha, everyone from the six element sect, long time no see!”

At this moment, a provocative voice sounded from behind.

“It’s that bunch of bastards from the Fang clan!”

The faces of the youths riding on the Thunder leopard darkened as they looked behind them coldly.

“You bunch of fellows are really stubborn. Didn’t you just cripple one of your clansmen? Why Are You So Persistent?”

The youth leading the group turned his head and saw the group of five behind him with a cold expression.

“Du Fei Chen, be careful with your words. Otherwise, it won’t be good if I bump into You When You’re alone!”

The five of them slowly walked over on their thunder devouring beasts. They stared coldly at the young man at the front and said coldly.

“You really think I’m afraid of You?”

Du Fei, who was sitting at the front, stared at the five of them darkly.

“Fang clan, you really think we’re afraid of you. Pay attention here!”

Xing Tian Yi looked at the five of them and coldly said.

“Here? If I’m not wrong, this place is the dragon-phoenix Empire. What does it have to do with you, Xing Tian Yi? Haha, I heard that this place was once the territory of your star-moon kingdom, but it was directly taken down by someone. Haha!”

The youth at the back of the group of five suddenly spoke with ridicule, his eyes filled with ridicule.

“You...”

Xing Tian’s expression changed slightly, and he stared at him with an embarrassed expression.

“What? Haha, I came to take a look at the domain of your star-moon kingdom. Ah, it seems to be even better than your star-moon kingdom’s Imperial City!”

As that youth spoke, he laughed loudly. Riding on the Lightning Devouring Beast, he directly charged forward, his laughter spreading far and wide.

The other four youths also looked at him with a mocking expression, directly surpassing the eight of them as they headed towards the location of the auction.

“Damnable Fellows!”

Xing Tian’s face revealed a trace of anger. His body moved slightly and the Hulei leopard that he was sitting on also increased its speed.

“These fellows from the Fang clan really think that we are afraid of them!”

The other youths also had ugly expressions and also increased their speed.

The roads of the Dragon-phoenix royal city were very wide. There were also sidewalks, carriage paths, and beast riding paths.

The beast-riding path was very wide. It was nearly 20 meters wide, enough for four to five meters or even larger beasts to run.

However, under normal circumstances, it was forbidden to ride beasts quickly in the city.

“There are so many mounts. Each and every one of them is simply too powerful!”

“Over the past two days, there have been too many terrifying experts coming to our dragon-phoenix royal city. There are even many mercenary groups inquiring about our living conditions here. It seems that they want to join our dragon-phoenix Royal City!”

“This is all thanks to Her Majesty the Queen. I heard that soon, our Dragon-phoenix royal city will have many new citizens!”

Within the Dragon-phoenix royal city, the citizens looked at the mercenary groups of experts from various countries in the Liuhai region on the streets and revealed smiles on their faces.

Especially those beast mounts. Even though they were exuding a powerful aura, they still caused many citizens to stare at them curiously.

“I wonder how many spirit stones my pet eggs and bloodline can sell for. These spirit stones can be used to upgrade the Dragon Palace!”

Wang Xian stood in front of the huge auction house and looked at the auction house that was 30 meters tall. A smile appeared on his face.

He didn’t plan to use the spirit stones for this auction. Instead, he wanted to use all of them to upgrade the power of the Dragon Palace.

As for the improvement of his level, he would think of a way in the future.

“Lower your speed. Please lower the speed of your ferocious beasts!”

At this moment, Wang Xian suddenly heard a stern voice. The voice sounded familiar.

“Haha, You Are Trash from the six elements sect. You are still a little weak!”

At this moment, an arrogant voice was heard.

“Roar Roar!”

Following that, the roar of a ferocious beast was heard.

“Ah!”

However, along with the roar of the Fierce Beast, a miserable cry was heard.

“En, the fierce beast lost control and hit someone!”

“That is? It’s the young pride of the six element sect and the Fang clan!”

“It’s them. I didn’t expect that they would come as well!”

“Void interpretation level bloodlines, half-step void interpretation level pet eggs, and that set of equipment are all extremely attractive to them!”

The voices of people conversing could be heard from the surroundings.

Most of the people around the auction house were from other countries. Many of them came from the graveyard of the demi-humans. They immediately recognized the group of young men.

Wang Xian looked over and immediately saw a group of young men riding on ferocious beasts.

At the sidewalk, a middle-aged man was lying on the ground with blood all over his face. His entire body was black.

It was obvious that the ferocious beasts that had lost control had accidentally rushed to the sidewalk and attacked the pedestrians at the side.

“The berserk beast has injured someone. Quickly ride your mount in our dragon-phoenix Imperial City. Come Down and follow us to the city Lord’s Mansion!”

In the middle of the road, Feng Lingtian and Liu Qing, who had obtained the bloodline of the demon beasts of the Wind Eye clan, led a group of city guards and shouted at Xing Tianyi and the rest with a solemn expression.
