Translator: 5496903

7th, 6th, 5th, 4th, 3rd, come together, don’t waste time!

When Ling Jian ‘er’s voice rang out in the arena, everyone was stunned!

“Damn, there’s no need to be so domineering, directly challenging five Demonic Beast Heaven’s favorites, this...”

“So confident, Ling Jian ‘er actually wants to directly challenge five, oh my god, Goddess!”

“Haha, Let’s not talk about anything else. Just based on Ling Jian ‘ER’s aura, she will be my goddess in the future!”

“Killing the Eighth Heaven’s favorite of the Demonic Beast clan in one move, directly challenging five demonic beasts. Too Domineering!”

When all the humans around the arena saw Ling Jian ‘ER’s confident figure, all of them had looks of admiration on their faces as they shouted and cheered loudly.

“Arrogant humans, you don’t need us to work together. I alone will be enough!”

The Demonic Lin Demonic Beast, who was ranked fifth among the demonic beasts, had a cold expression in its eyes. Its body moved and it directly flew towards the arena.

Its enormous body, which was about five meters in size, was accompanied by intense flames as it directly attacked.

“Instant golden brilliance!”

Ling Jian ‘ER’s expression did not change. The moment the Demonic Lin Demonic Beast entered the arena, she started to move.

A bright golden light directly attacked the Demonic Lin Beast.

“Roar, Demonic Flame Shield!”

The Demonic Lin Beast opened its eyes wide and roared.

A Flame Shield instantly formed around it to defend itself.

“Weng!”

However, what everyone didn’t expect was that the Golden Light easily penetrated the demonic Lin Beast’s defense.

Under its incredulous expression, the golden light entered its body and directly killed it.

“Peng!”

Sudden, shock, and astonishment!

A demonic Lin demonic beast that rushed out, ranked fifth among the demonic beasts, was instantly killed!

This...

“Hiss, with the combat strength that Ling Jian ‘er displayed, it can completely match an expert at the first level of the profound void Martial Stage!”

“Haha, Too Strong, simply too strong. Exhale with pride, really exhale with PRIDE!”

“Those beasts of the Demonic Beasts, why aren’t you shouting anymore? Continue shouting!”

After two seconds of silence around the arena, the sound of shouting could be heard.

Everyone had excited expressions on their faces. They looked at Ling Jian ‘er in the arena fervently, their faces filled with shock, astonishment, and admiration.

The feeling of being sullen just now was completely released after Ling Jian ‘ER made a move and instantly killed two demonic Beast Heaven’s favorites.

They cheered loudly and began to fight back against the Demonic Beast clan.

Within the Demonic Beast clan, the expressions of the demonic beasts slowly turned solemn. Even the Demonic Beast Heaven’s favorites had slightly embarrassed expressions as their eyes flickered.

“Next, don’t waste time!”

Ling Jian ‘er stood there with a golden longsword in her hand.

Her thin and beautiful figure appeared much taller.

Even many men could not help but feel admiration in their hearts.

Although Ling Jian ‘er had a powerful background, in the past ten years, she had not relied on her background.

Instead, she had made it through on her own.

“Sect leader, Jian ‘er’s talent is much stronger than yours. Especially her luck. I really didn’t expect that our Heavenly Sword sect would also have a successor!”

In a corner of the arena, an old man looked at Ling Jian ‘er below and sighed as he spoke to the white-haired middle-aged man by the side of the mountain.

“All these years, it’s been hard on her. She’s just a girl!”

The white-haired middle-aged man looked at Ling Jian ‘er’s figure lovingly and sighed silently.

“Don’t worry sect leader, Jian ‘er will forgive you!”

The old man revealed a faint smile. When he looked at Ling Jian ‘er, his eyes were filled with surprise and shock.

As the strongest person in the heavenly sword sect other than the sect master, he could see that Ling Jian ‘ER had obtained a shocking inheritance.

“Let me do it!”

The third-ranked Demonic Beast, The Blood Savage Demonic Beast, stared coldly at Ling Jian ‘ER. With a leap, he directly flew onto the stage.

“I never thought that there would be such a genius among humans. However, you are destined to lose today!”

It was obvious that the demonic beast race no longer had the arrogance they had earlier.

They stared at Ling Jian ‘ER with a grave expression.

“Sou Sou!”

However, Ling Jian ‘er did not waste any time and attacked with the golden sword in her hand.

The streaks of golden light caused the blood savage beast to be extremely wary.

The Blood Savage Beast had been in a passive position since the start of the battle.

“How can this human’s attack be like this? That golden light can easily penetrate my attack and defense, this...”

The battle did not exceed ten moves and the Blood Savage Beast’s face was filled with fear and trepidation.

Every time it attacked, Ling Jian ‘ER’s golden light could easily penetrate its defense.

In fact, it didn’t even doubt that if its vital points were hit, it would die instantly.

“Fire wings!” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

When a golden light pierced through its defense and landed on its front hoof, the demonic Lin Beast was completely flustered.

It didn’t hesitate at all and directly fled to the back.

“Haha, I Escaped, I won again. Ling Jian ‘ER is simply too cool!”

“Roar Roar, Ling Jian ‘er Goddess is awesome!”

Cheers rang out from the surroundings of the arena, resounding throughout the entire sky.

Even manager Qian looked at Ling Jian ‘ER in the arena with a face full of shock.

The strength that she had displayed was not inferior to those powerful heaven’s favorites in the vast region!

“This...”

At the Demonic Beasts’seats, all the Demonic Beasts’faces were slightly embarrassed.

What had happened in the training grounds had caused the entire demonic beast clan to be incomparably furious. They did not hesitate to raise the strength of the current generation of Demonic Beast Heaven’s favorites in order to humiliate humans.

But what they didn’t expect was that a third ranked heaven’s pride actually consecutively killed and defeated several of their heaven’s pride.

This made all the demonic beasts extremely angry.

“You, come!”

At this moment, Ling Jian ‘er, who was standing in the arena, pointed at the second ranked Demonic Beast Heaven’s pride, The Blood Savage Demonic Beast, an existence at the profound void first rank.

“Hou Hou, I have to say, you’ve completely angered me!”

The last level one of the Insight Void Tier Blood Savage demonic beast had an extremely cold expression in its eyes.

Its six-meter-tall body moved slightly and directly transformed into a blood shadow, entering the arena.

Ling Jian ‘er brandished the long sword in her hand and instantly attacked.

Facing a level one of the Insight Void Tier demonic beast, she wasn’t the slightest bit afraid.

When all the humans around the arena saw this scene, their eyes flickered.

When Ling Jian ‘er displayed her abilities, she could definitely match up to a powerhouse at level one of the Seethrough realm.

“The current me might not even be able to win against Ling Jian ‘ER!”

On the Heaven’s Pride Bridge, Ren Xingchen looked at Ling Jian ‘er who was fighting against a powerhouse at level one of the Seethrough realm. A solemn expression appeared on his face.

“With her strength, she can definitely defeat a powerhouse at level one of the Seethrough Realm!”

Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled. He was also slightly shocked. Ling Jian ‘ER had improved too quickly in the past few days.

Of course, it was mainly because of the gold of origin. The gold of origin could destroy everything.

Even a dharma idol at the Seethrough realm could be destroyed!
