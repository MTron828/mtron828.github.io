Chapter 1166: The 1167 sacred killing order arrived

Translator: 5496903

“Bright Moon City will be sealed. No one is allowed to leave the city!”

“Anyone who dares to leave the city will be locked up. Anyone who disobeys will be killed!”

“Bright Moon Army, stand by. Activate the formation of Bright Moon City!”

“Activate level 1 battle preparations. During this period, anyone who makes a mistake will be punished tenfold!”

The morning had not yet passed, and the entire bright moon city was in an uproar. Numerous guards and soldiers of the Bright Moon Army flew in the Sky of Bright Moon City and announced to everyone.

Below, everyone in Bright Moon City was stunned.

“What? They actually closed the city gates? This...”

“What are the city lord and general trying to do? They want to completely seal bright moon city!”

“To be so strict and directly seal the entire city... it seems that the star-moon kingdom has issued an order!”

Everyone below revealed shocked expressions. Sealing the city gates was a major matter that would only be done when Bright Moon City encountered a huge crisis.

However, now that the city gates were sealed, no one was allowed to enter or leave.

Everyone knew that star-moon kingdom was furious. They wanted to seal off the entire city, preparing to take action against the dragon assassin organization in the city.

From this series of actions, one could tell how furious star-moon kingdom was.

“It’s best to keep a low profile for the next few days. Take advantage of the incident with the dragon assassin organization and stay in the city!”

“Do not offend the city guards and soldiers at this time. Otherwise, there is a high possibility of killing them on the spot!”

When the warning voices of the city guards and soldiers rang out in every corner, the entire bright moon city was clearly much quieter.

Even the clamoring voices were gone, and the shouting voices were also much quieter.

There was only the sound of torrential rain pouring down.

Obviously, in the face of the Star Moon King’s Fury, everyone kept a much lower profile.

“This dragon Spike is going to be in trouble!”

Some people said slowly. With such a terrifying stance, the crisis of the dragon spike was about to arrive!

...

“Since the dragon Spike has already taken action, there’s no need for peace in this city!”

However, on the third floor of the restaurant, Wang Xian stood in front of the window and watched the soldiers fly past. He smiled when he saw the citizens talking in low voices.

He picked up the Teacup in his hand gently. His eyes were sparkling.

“Ah!”

At this moment, a scream of horror was heard in a restaurant as though it was a bolt from the blue. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Murder! Murder!”

The Scream of horror was extremely conspicuous at this moment.

On the second floor of the restaurant, more than a dozen customers looked at the middle-aged man who was lying on the ground in horror.

“That Red Note... It’s the dragon Spike!”

“Oh my God, the dragon Spike is actually carrying out an assassination at this time!”

“How did he die? I didn’t see anything just now, how did he die!”

Shocked voices rang out one after another. Everyone looked at the middle-aged man lying on the ground in disbelief, looking at the bright red paper.

At this time, the city gates were closed and the formation was fully activated, yet the dragon spike was still carrying out an assassination!

Could he not be so f * cking arrogant and crazy?

“He’s killing people!”

“Ah Ah Ah!”

“The dragon Spike is carrying out an assassination!”

However, at the same time, the entire bright moon city was filled with exclamations.

At this moment, everyone was stunned.

This was in broad daylight. You’re carrying out an assassination mission in broad daylight?

Not only were the citizens of Bright Moon City stunned, even the city guards and soldiers were dumbfounded.

Was there a need to slap their faces like this?

To assassinate them in broad daylight!

Furthermore, the dragon Spike had succeeded!

This...

“Provocation, this is a blatant provocation. Assassins walk in the darkness, but today, the city has just been sealed, and the dragon Spike immediately assassinated them. This is contempt for the star-moon kingdom!”

“This is against the star-moon kingdom, this...”

A city guard captain stood beside the corpse of an extraordinary rank 9 expert, his body trembling as his pupils constricted.

The surrounding soldiers and city guards were also slightly silent.

They felt that star-moon kingdom had encountered a ruthless person this time.

If they could not destroy this dragon spike, then the dragon Spike would rule the entire underground of star-moon kingdom in the future.

“Immediately report this matter to the city Lord and General!”

Without the slightest hesitation, the group immediately reported this matter to the higher-ups.

This matter wasn’t something they could handle.

The strength of the dragon Spike and their madness had already exceeded their expectations.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

Not long after, two figures floated in the sky, their cold gazes sweeping downwards, their faces incomparably gloomy.

“This dragon spike...”

City Lord Liu stood there, his expression so gloomy that it was almost dripping blood.

The city protection surveillance array did not detect any traces of the dragon Spike’s assassination.

A transcendent level 9 expert was directly assassinated during the day.

In a short span of ten minutes, a total of more than 150 people died.

Such a terrifying speed and terrifying assassination made even them feel a little apprehensive.

“Let’s wait for Lord Xing Guang and the others to arrive. This dragon spike is not something we can deal with!”

The general of the Bright Moon Army said with a solemn expression.

“Hu!”

City Lord Liu let out a breath and nodded slowly.

City Lord Liu had learned of the dragon Spike’s actions in East Sea city back then. The dragon Spike had left the city lord helpless.

In Bright Moon City, they didn’t have any good ideas either.

They could only wait for the people of the imperial city to arrive.

The figures of the two disappeared and weakly returned to the city Lord’s manor.

The entire Bright Moon City fell silent once more. Everyone was shocked as they discussed the dragon Spike assassin organization.

The assassination during the day had shocked everyone with the strength of the dragon spike.

During the day, they killed people on the streets. The city guards and soldiers were helpless, and the city lord and general didn’t make a move.

Obviously, they had no way to deal with the dragon spike.

The orders to seal the city and make mistakes in the morning were a joke to the dragon spike.

“Hehe!”

Wang Xian sat in the restaurant. He had the mentality of watching the situation unfold with a smile.

He looked at the changes in Bright Moon City and a smile appeared on his face.

The current strange demons had evolved into the light spike. Their strongest time was not at night, but during the day.

Only by assassinating them during the day could they truly display the full strength of the dragon spike.

“I wonder when the royal family will be able to arrive!”

Wang Xian mumbled.

The strange demons that were sent out had already rushed towards the towns in star-moon kingdom. It was possible that when the royal family’s experts arrived, the strange demons would have already arrived.

When that time came, he wanted to see if the star-moon kingdom would lower their heads or swear to destroy the dragon spike.

The torrential rain lasted for an entire day. Today’s sky had darkened much earlier than usual.

“That’s right!”

At dusk, four figures that were emitting terrifying energy like the bright moon were rapidly flying over from the west.

Two of them were completely red, just like the Sun!

One of them was completely blue, as if carrying an ocean!

The other was yellow like a flying mountain!

“The sacred killing order has arrived!”!

A cold voice rushed toward Bright Moon City!
