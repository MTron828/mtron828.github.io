“Roar Roar Roar! ”

“Roar Roar Roar! ”

The sudden arrival of eight level six hunters who were masters of the universe caused the entire team to show fear on their faces!

Without any hesitation, they immediately issued the order to escape!

When Wang Xian saw this scene, he raised his eyebrows slightly.

It was not impossible to deal with the eight hunters who were masters of level six.

However, he did not want to fight them!

There were only eight of them now. What if there were more coming.

Then, they would not be able to fight them!

Wang Xian could escape easily, but they might not be able to!

With this thought in mind, Wang Xian moved his body and followed the group to fly into the distance!

Buzz

Wang Xian did not have the barbarian saint son, the flowing moon Saintess.

Their energy enveloped everyone and brought them to speed up their flight!

The eight demon hunters let out a furious roar when they saw them fleeing!

Their speed suddenly increased by a lot!

Furthermore, they split up and wanted to surround them from both sides!

“They are very fast! ”

The Barbarian Saint Son’s expression changed slightly when he saw this scene and heard the roar coming from behind!

“Increase our speed and shake them off. If we can’t shake them off, we’ll be in trouble! ”

The flowing moon Saintess said with a grave expression!

Their expressions weren’t very good!

Roar!

But at this moment, a demon hunter behind them let out a sky-shaking roar!

This roar spread out in all directions!

It was as if it was summoning!

“Oh no, this demon hunter is summoning! The demon beasts on the next level can order the demon beasts on the next level to stop us! ”

Seeing this scene, saint son Xu Ni’s expression changed slightly as he shouted!

He was currently at the ruler Realm Level 4. If he was targeted by a demon beast at the ruler Realm Level 6, even if he was of the space attribute, he would still be in danger!

The eyes of the Barbarian Saint Son and the rest focused as they roared in a low voice!

His two-meter-long giant sword had now become 1,000 meters in size!

Everyone was standing on his giant sword!

The flowing water power of the flowing moon Saintess was constantly increasing the speed of the giant sword!

Similarly, Wang Xian’s space power was also added to it.

Based on their speed, it shouldn’t be too much of a problem for them to escape!

At the back, the gap between the demon hunters and them was getting bigger and bigger!

“They should be fine! ”

After fleeing for about ten minutes, Saintess Liuyue turned around and glanced around. She could no longer see the demon hunters behind them!

She heaved a sigh of relief!

If they were to be entangled by these eight demon beasts, they would be in great trouble.

Even if they could escape, the entire team would suffer a great loss!

“We should be fine now. It was really dangerous just now. It’s best that we don’t provoke these demon beasts! ”

“Didn’t our seniors go to the fourth level to clean up? It should be better if some seniors go to the fourth level! ”

The group of holy sons and Saintesses said with lingering fear!

However, just as they finished their sentence, roars came from the front!

The sudden roar stunned everyone!

Wang Xian, who was standing on the Sword of the barbarian saint, was also stunned. He looked ahead!

At the front, hundreds of demon hunters were staring at them. Their eyes were filled with murderous intent!

Among these hundreds of demon hunters, twenty of them were at the level five realm!

The rest were at the level of Tier 2 overlords and above! “Eh? How did we encounter such a powerful Demon Hunter clan again?”

Everyone raised their eyebrows when they saw this scene!

“Holy Son Wu, they are charging over! ”

Hundreds of demon hunters were emitting a violent aura as they attacked them!

“This is? This group of demon hunters has entered a berserk state. This is bad.

Finish them off immediately and leave this place!”

When Saintess Liuyue saw that the group of demon hunters had gone berserk even before the battle started, her gaze froze slightly!

Wang Xian looked at this group of demon hunters with a glint in his eyes!

These demon hunters were slightly different from the group they encountered earlier!

Earlier, they were the ones who took the initiative to search for them and then began to hunt!

And this group of demon hunters seemed to be here specifically to attack them!

Moreover, before they could rush over, their entire bodies went berserk!

When the demon hunters went berserk, their combat power instantly increased by 50% !

In their eyes, this was a little shocking!

Demon Beasts weren’t said to go berserk at will.

They went berserk at the cost of their vitality and potential!

Under normal circumstances, they would only go berserk when they were in danger and injured!FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The fact that they went berserk before they could charge at them made them a little uneasy!

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

Wang Xian didn’t hesitate at all. Numerous space swords instantly floated in the air.

One by one, the space swords flashed and started to condense into a sword tomb!

“Attack!”

The Barbarian Saint Son’s eyes focused. The huge sword returned to his hand. Instantly, it was covered by lightning and charged forward!

The group of Saint Sons and saintesses who practiced swordsmanship followed closely behind!

Saintess flowing moon also immediately cast a powerful spell!

“Roar! Roar! ”

At the front, the group of demon hunters seemed to be fearless as they stared at Wang Xian and the rest.

The violent energy in the surroundings formed a terrifying storm!

Even though Wang Xian and the saint son of Barbarian Wu were stronger, they still charged forward fearlessly!

“Moon Sword Formation! ”

Wang Xian looked at the demon hunter without the slightest fluctuation in his gaze!

Above them, sword mounds were formed one after another, connecting to form a sword formation!

A moon sword disk appeared above them, shining with a luster.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! ”

Following that, countless sharp swords charged towards the demon hunters!

“Roar! Roar! ”

At the front, more than 20 demon hunters who were at level five were feeling threatened. They waved their arms.

Terrifying Sharp swords charged towards Wang Xian and the rest.

They completely covered half of the sky!

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

“Boom! Boom!”

A terrifying collision sound was heard. Apart from Wang Xian, the saint son of Barbarian Wu and Saintess Liu Yue, their attacks had penetrated through their attacks.

The rest of the attacks were all blocked by them!

However, this was already the best!

Wang Xian and the rest’s attacks landed on the hunters who were at the level five realm instantly!

The terrifying destructive power caused their vitality to disappear rapidly!

In an instant, more than 20 demonic beasts who were at the level five realm were killed by them.

Roar!

However, when they killed more than twenty tier 5 sovereign realm demonic beasts, they were flanked on the left and right.

The eight demon hunters charged over at a terrifying speed!

“What?”

Seeing the rapidly charging tier 6 sovereign realm demon hunters, everyone’s faces changed!
