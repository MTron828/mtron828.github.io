Let Me Die in pain. Beast, come and kill me!

When Wang Xian said this, he gave the leader of the Blood Barbarian Demon Beast a middle finger with a face full of disdain.

Wang Xian’s voice reverberated throughout the entire Shenghai town. The Blood Barbarian Demon Beast that was charging over was also slightly stunned.

Although he didn’t know what Wang Xian meant by giving the middle finger, he could feel the intense provocation.

“You want to stop me with a half-step void interpretation level formation? Break It!”

The leader of the Blood Barbarian Demonic Beast was furious. He swung his sharp claws in the direction of Shenghai Town.

He was the leader of the demonic beast. He had just advanced to the void interpretation level and became the king of the demonic beasts. An extraordinary ant dared to provoke him. He swore to devour this human one bite at a time!

Wang Xian floated in the air and looked at the leader of the blood barbarian demonic beasts with a smile on his face.

All the people in the holy sea town looked at the leader of the blood barbarian demonic beasts.

Boom

Crack Crack Crack

Crack Crack Crack

Time seemed to have stopped. When the attack of the leader of the blood barbarian demonic beasts reached the holy sea town, a blue water-element formation appeared.

The array slowly cracked and directly shattered.

Then, the wood element array appeared. However, the wood element array still slowly cracked and shattered under its attack.

When the two arrays were shattered, everyone found it difficult to breathe.

However, when its attack landed on the third array, the fire element array directly blocked its attack.

Only then did everyone heave a sigh of relief.

“Keke, Kid, you’re about to die!”

The leader of the Blood Barbaric Demon Beast revealed a bloodthirsty and excited expression. Two arrays had been broken. At most, two attacks would break them all!

“Not good, there are only five arrays in total!”

The people of Holy Sea town also realized this, and their faces turned pale again.

“Boom!”

Under everyone’s eyes, the Blood Savage Beast, which looked like a life-reaping devil, once again attacked the array formation with all its strength.

“Boom!” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Crack Crack Crack!”

“Crack Crack Crack Crack!”

However, this time, the water-element array formation was broken, and the wood-element array formation was broken. The attack was easily blocked by the fire-shaped array formation.

“What’s going on?”

The leader of the Blood Barbarian demonic beast was slightly stunned. A look of astonishment appeared on his face.

“Break for me!”

His sharp voice resounded across the sky. The tail on his back carried a terrifying dark energy as it landed on the five-element formation once again.

The third time was the same. The broken water-element formation and wood-element formation appeared once again.

“Five-element formation. The five elements are born together, the five elements are fused together, and the five elements are combined as one. Unless the five formations are directly broken, there is no way to break the formation. Although the formation is only at the half-step void interpretation level, do you think a beast who has just broken through can break the five formations together? “Haha!”

Wang Xian laughed and said to the blood barbarian demon beast.

This formation was a low-level formation stored in the Dragon King’s treasure house.

To the Dragon King, this formation was very low-level. It was also because of the uniqueness of the five elements formation that he kept it in his treasure house.

The five elements formation was difficult to break without the strength of a third level void interpretation.

It was definitely the best formation in the transcendence realm.

“No, no, it’s impossible!”

The leader of the Blood Barbaric Demon Beast roared with blood-red eyes. The continuous attacks landed on the five elements array.

However, it was useless!

“Roar, Roar, Roar!”

This made the leader of the Blood Barbaric Demon Beast extremely furious. He roared angrily.

“Great, Great!”

“Hahaha, we’ve defended it, we’ve defended it!”

“Thank you, Lord Wang, thank you, Lord Wang!”

“Ahhhh, we’ve defended it, we’ve defended it!”

However, the anger of the leader of the Blood Barbaric Demon Beast caused everyone in holy sea town to roar in excitement.

“What? We’ve defended it?”

“We’ve defended it. Lord Wang has created a very powerful formation. Lord Wang said that only a powerhouse above level three of the void interpretation realm can break it. That beast outside can’t break the formation at all!”

“That’s great! That’s great! We survived!”

“Thank you, Lord Wang Xian!”

Slowly, the situation at the city gate spread to the back. Soon, it spread to the entire Shenghai town.

This made 1.7 to 800,000 people cry tears of joy. All of them shouted excitedly.

For a moment, the entire Shenghai town was in an uproar.

Even if half of the 1.7 to 800,000 people shouted at the same time, it was still like a tsunami.

Everyone was venting out the depression and despair of the past few days in excitement.

Today, they could finally settle down and defend Shenghai town.

“Thank you, Sir Wang Xian, for helping us to defend Shenghai town. Thank you for saving the lives of 1,700,000 to 800,000 people in Shenghai Town!”

At the position of the city wall, Jin Qianyuan bowed to Wang Xian with excitement.

“Thank you, Sir Wang Xian, for saving my life!”

Around the city wall, a group of soldiers who were guarding the city knelt on the ground and shouted respectfully.

“Thank you, Sir Wang Xian, for saving my life!”

Below, a group of people knelt down slowly and shouted with gratitude on their faces.

When they saw the people in front kneeling down to express their gratitude, the people behind immediately followed. In an instant, their voices reverberated throughout the entire Shenghai town.

Thank you, Sir Wang Xian, for saving my life!

How did it feel to have a million people kneeling down to him?

This was the first time Wang Xian felt a million people kneeling down to him respectfully, reverently, and gratefully.

This made him slightly stunned. A bitter smile appeared on his face as he shook his head slowly.

“All of you, get up. Mayor Jin, continue with the operation of Shenghai Town and settle down all the citizens!”

“In addition, the array can only be used to get out. No one is allowed to come in. No one is allowed to go out!”

As he spoke, his eyes were filled with smiles as he looked at the Blood Savage Beast leader who was standing outside the array with a furious expression.

At this moment, the Blood Savage Beast Leader was so furious that it almost wanted to go crazy, especially when it saw the excited expressions of the humans in front of it.

There was also the mocking look on that fellow’s face. He attacked the formation more than ten times in a row in a frenzy.

However, it was still useless. This made him want to go crazy.

“I will accept the corpses of the ferocious beasts that you brought along and the corpses of your blood barbaric Demon Beast clan with a Smile!”

Wang Xian looked at the furious leader of the Blood Barbaric Demon Beast and said with a smile on his face.

“Roar!”

It was slightly stunned when it heard Wang Xian’s words. Then, it quickly turned its head around. When it saw that the carcasses of the beasts had completely disappeared, it was completely stunned.

“Roar Roar Roar, human, you damn human. Roar Roar Roar, I’m going to kill you. I, the blood barbarian, will not become a demon if I don’t kill you!”

When he saw that there wasn’t a single corpse of the beasts behind him, he started to attack the formation with his claws.

He was about to cry.

He was a demon beast of the profound void tier, he was so angry that he almost cried!
