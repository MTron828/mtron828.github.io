“I’m going to kill you!”

A sharp voice came from Fairy Hua’s mouth on the second floor of the god of cooking tower.

Her face was full of blood marks. Her body was tied up by the Bone Whip, and she was lying on the ground in an unusual sorry state.

She was the dignified fairy Hua, the fourth most beautiful woman in the world. She was the goddess in the hearts of thousands of martial artists. Now, she was lying in front of a little girl.

If the martial artists in the pugilistic world knew about this, she, Fairy Hua, would become a laughing stock.

Today, she would become the biggest stain in her life.

No, when she saw a martial artist take out his cell phone to take a photo, this matter would definitely be spread out. This made her heart surge with endless killing intent.

“Kill me? With just you?”

Xiao Yu stared at Fairy Hua coldly, the bone whip in her hand pointed at her.

“This...”

The surrounding disciples of the immortal sect looked at this scene in astonishment.

Fairy Hua had mocked the Dragon Gate, but in the end, she was easily defeated by a girl from the Dragon Gate.

Moreover, at this moment, she was lying on the ground, her hair disheveled, and her face was full of bloody scars. The ferocious-looking fairy Hua was not as beautiful and noble as she usually was, she was like a fairy.

“You’re courting death! Stop!”

Yuwen Yue, who was standing at the side, moved her arm and an earthy yellow spear appeared in her hand. She pointed it at Little Yu with a cold face.

“Yuwen Yue, this is the grudge between our Dragon Gate and the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect. Do you want to make a move?”

Guan Shuqing and the other girls saw Yuwen Yue taking out her weapon and asked coldly.

“I don’t give a damn about your dragon gate. Stop Right Now!”

Yuwen Yue shouted at them.

In an instant, everyone’s expression changed.

“You can represent your Yuwen clan!”

Little Yu’s expression also turned cold as he asked Yuwen Yue coldly.

“I told you to stop. Little girl, whether I can represent or not, I will teach you a good lesson today!”

Yuwen Yue’s expression was dark and cold. The long spear in her hand carried a murderous aura as it stabbed towards little feather.

“Alright, then I don’t care whether you can represent me or Not!”

Little Feather’s expression did not change. The bone whip in his hand instantly split into more than ten poisonous snakes that instantly shot towards Yuwen Yue.

“HMPH!”

Yuwen Yue’s face was ice-cold as she shook her arm. Earth spikes instantly appeared on the earthen yellow long spear and stabbed towards little feather.

“Boom!”

Xiao Yu swung his bone whip and the earthen spear collapsed!

“What?”

Yuwen Yue’s face changed and a look of shock appeared in her eyes.

“You said that you could crush all the young disciples of our Dragon Gate by yourself. Initially, I didn’t want to argue with you because you are from the Yuwen clan. Did you really think that our Dragon Gate is afraid of You?”

Xiao Yu’s face was cold. Just now, Yuwen Yue had arrogantly said that she alone could suppress all the disciples of the Dragon Gate. Now, she actually dared to arrogantly say that she didn’t care about the Dragon Gate.

This made Xiao Yu slightly angry. A fellow who hadn’t even reached the half-step immortal God realm still dared to be so arrogant.

“Peng Peng Peng!”

The bone whip in Xiao Yu’s hand was like a bone dragon’s tentacle, directly attacking towards Yuwen Yue.

Yuwen Yue’s expression instantly changed. The long spear in her arm shook and an indestructible Earth wall appeared!

“Crack Crack!”

However, the difference in strength was too big after all. The bone whip directly pierced through and heavily swung towards Yuwen Yue’s face.

“Bang!”

The powerful force caused the handsome Yuwen Yue to instantly fly towards the window.

Little Feather did not stop and swung the bone whip once again.

Yuwen Yue’s face was filled with shock. A shield that emitted light and traces of an array instantly appeared on the necklace on her chest.

Little Feather’s bone whip landed on the shield, causing it to not move at all.

She frowned and the bone whip in her hand merged into one as she heavily attacked the shield.

It did not move at all. Under the terrifying defense, it still did not move at all.

“This should be the Yuwen clan’s defensive array. A defensive array that can withstand an immortal God’s attack is very precious!”

Guan Shuqing looked at the indestructible shield and said to Xiao Yu.

“So it’s a turtle shell made by an immortal god. Trash. Now, it’s still hiding in this turtle shell and not daring to come out!”

Xiao Yu looked at Yuwen Yue with disdain and said, “Someone like you? You still have the face to say that you can crush all the disciples of our Dragon Gate? You’re quite good at bragging. Hehe, a heaven’s Pride?”

Yu Wen Yue’s body trembled violently, and his expression was extremely unsightly.

Looking at the surrounding disciples of the immortal gate looking at him, he had no place to be ashamed!

He never would have thought that such a young girl would be able to defeat him so easily.

After all, he had the strength of the peak of the infant realm!

Looking at Yu Wen Yue’s disdainful expression, he clenched his teeth tightly.

He was defeated by a girl, and would end up like Fairy Hua, becoming a laughing stock.

A Heaven’s pride that only knew how to boast!

This caused his eyes to be filled with bloodshot, and he wished for nothing more than to cut little feather into a thousand pieces!

“Just you wait, I won’t let you off!”

Yu Wen Yue’s eyes revealed a crazed killing intent, and she stared at little feather with bloodthirsty eyes.

“Wait? You Dare to say such vicious words just because you’re hiding in a turtle shell? I thought the Yuwen clan was so strong, but I didn’t expect the Yuwen clan to have such a useless existence!”

Little Yu stared at Yuwen Yue without the slightest bit of fear.

“You...” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

When Yuwen Yue heard this, she almost vomited blood.

He had just said that he could crush everyone in the Dragon Gate, but in the end, he was instantly slapped in the face by a girl from the Dragon Gate. This made him feel his entire body burn.

If he continued to argue with this girl, then he, Yuwen Yue, would lose even more face!

“I, Yuwen Yue, will remember what happened today. Very soon, I will make you pay a heavy price for what happened today!”

Yuwen Yue’s blood-red eyes stared at Little Yu. With an embarrassed expression, she walked to Fairy Hua’s side and helped her up.

“Just you wait, just you wait. Tomorrow will be your Doomsday!”

Fairy Hua was so angry that she almost went mad. Her chest kept rising and falling as she shouted at Little Yu.

“Then we’ll see Tomorrow!”

Little Yu raised his head slightly and looked coldly at fairy hua and Yuwen Yue who were in a sorry state.

“Go!”

The two of them walked out gloomily. The four men and women who were at a loss hurriedly followed them.

“What a Killjoy!”

Little Yu watched them leave and said impatiently.

“Xiao Yu, you beat up the current prodigy of the Yuwen clan. Will the Yuwen clan... Do you want to tell your brother?”

Feng Lingtian frowned and said worriedly.

“Don’t worry. This is already giving the Yuwen clan face!”

Guan Shuqing said with a twinkle in her eyes.

“That’s right. If the Yuwen clan doesn’t discipline their own disciples, then we will help them discipline them!”

Lan qingyue echoed from the side. Just now, Yuwen Yue had slandered the Dragon Gate. If it wasn’t for Little Yu, they would have taken action!

As for the price, that would depend on how the Yuwen clan would react.

Even if it was a reaction, they would be able to accept it.

“Bring it back and eat it!”

Guan Shuqing hesitated for a moment and said. A few girls nodded in agreement.

Around them, a group of immortal sect disciples looked on in astonishment.

Things seemed to be getting bigger!
