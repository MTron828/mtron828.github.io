Chapter 1463: 1463 headed to the vast sea region

After the demon Lin clan transformed into the fire Phoenix Dragon Seed, their strength once again received a powerful increase.

The fire Phoenix Dragon Seed couldn’t be considered a peak dragon seed. It was only a dragon seed derived from endless wood and Phoenix Luan’s blood.

In terms of level, it was equivalent to the light thorn dragon seed.

However, for the current fire Phoenix Dragon Seed clan, this could already be considered a huge increase.

From being able to fight against opponents one level higher than them to being able to kill opponents one level higher than them, this was a huge improvement.

After the flowing sea region was completely controlled, the Dragon Palace’s development was seven or eight times better than before. Everything was developing in a good direction.

There were more than 16,000 members of the Dragon Palace.

There were 1,500 members of the Demon War Department!

1,000 members of the Dragon Guard Department!

1,000 members of the Thunder Department!

1,500 members of the Starwood War Department!

4,000 members on mounts!

1,000 members of the Dragon Spur Department!

1,000 members of the Heavenly Eye Arrow Department!

500 members of the Dolphin clan!

1,000 members of the Golden Swordfish of the Dragon Guard department!

1,000 members of the poison-making department of the Ba Qi clan!

Over 2,000 members of the Fire Hammer clan’s forging department!

The special ao crab had tens of thousands of little ao crabs in its body!

Along with the rest of the civil officials and members who took care of the Dragon Palace!

There were a total of over 16,000 members.

Although the Dragon Palace was getting stronger and stronger, Wang Xian couldn’t be happy because of Ling Jian ‘ER’s matter.

In the next few days, another shocking incident happened in the Liuhai region.

The Liuhuang Alliance was disbanded, and all the members joined the dragon-phoenix Empire.

Apart from the ancient blood flow sect, the dragon-phoenix Empire once again unified the forces in the Liuhai region.

There were nearly two thousand insightful emptiness realm experts in the entire dragon-phoenix Empire.

After the dragon-phoenix Empire was unified, the sect master of the Sky Sword sect gave up his position and went to the vast region alone to begin the journey to find his daughter.

Time passed day by day, and the Dragon Palace also entered the proper order.

The daily income of the fire hammer clan could be exchanged for resources, which could allow two members of the Dragon Palace to reach the insightful void realm.

Every day, the strength of the Dragon Palace was increasing.

They fought in the Dragon Palace and cultivated in the Dragon Cave.

They searched for Ling Jian ‘ER in the flowing sea region without stopping. Unfortunately, after a month, there was still no news.

“Xiao Xian, have you decided to go to the vast region?”

A month later, in the Dragon Palace, a group of girls looked at him with reluctance and asked.

“Yes. If I don’t go now, I will go there in the future. Firstly, it’s to find Ling Jian ‘ER. Secondly, it’s to take a look at the vast region. One day, the Dragon Palace will conquer that sea region!”

Wang Xian looked at the group of girls and said with a smile.

“Be careful then!”

A few girls looked at him and reminded him.

“Don’t worry, nothing will happen to me!”

Wang Xian smiled and looked at the front of the hall.

In the Dragon King Hall, 200 strange demons and 200 golden swordfish were standing there.

“This time, we are going to the vast area. We will occupy a place and make preparations for the future of the Dragon Palace. All of you will follow me!”

As Wang Xian spoke to them, his body moved and he flew out of the Dragon Palace.

Two hundred strange demons and two hundred golden swordfish immediately followed behind and flew out.

Guan Shuqing and the rest followed behind to send them off.

“There’s no need for all of you to send us off. You can come over when things settle down over there!”

Wang Xian said to the group of girls.

The seven girls, including Xiao Yu, nodded their heads vigorously.

“Wang Xian, be careful. There are many more experts in the vast area than in the Liuhai Region!”

At this moment, Feng Luan who came over after hearing the news reminded him when she saw him leading his men to leave.

“Don’t worry. I’ll go to the vast area to explore first!”

Wang Xian said to Feng Luan.

“Alright. In two to three years at most, the Dragon and Phoenix Empire will enter the vast area!”

Feng Luan nodded her head heavily at him.

The entire tomb of the demi-human was already under control, and many places could be opened directly.

This could allow some powerhouses to speed up their cultivation speed.

Moreover, with her guidance, she could quickly nurture a batch of powerhouses.

In addition, she could consume resources to directly raise her level in the Dragon Pool. Before long, she would reach the peak of the seventh, eighth, or even the Seethrough realm. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Okay!”

Wang Xian nodded his head and waved his hand at the group. His body moved and he flew into the distance.

Behind him, other than the Golden Swordfish and the strange demon, there were also two civil officials from the Dragon Palace.

The left and right hands of Prime Minister Gui were here to set up a vast area.

The two hundred Golden Swordfish had no emotions on their faces. They were like emotionless machines.

All of them had cultivated the heartless sword principle. They had already condensed their sword hearts and entered the state of forgetting emotions.

Among them, 190 were at the second level of the void interpretation realm, five were at the third level of the void interpretation realm, four were at the fourth level of the Void interpretation realm, and Ao Jian was at the fifth level of the void interpretation realm!

It was the same for strange demon. However, Ao Demon was at the fifth level of the void interpretation realm and was able to assassinate someone at the seventh level of the void interpretation realm!

After Wang Xian’s understanding of the vast region during this period of time, this force of theirs was considered a second-rate force in the vast region.

A third-rate force was equivalent to the blood flow empire in the past.

As for a first-rate force, it had to have an expert at the eighth level of the Seethrough Realm to oversee it.

As for a super force, it had to have an expert at the ninth level of the Seethrough Realm to oversee it.

“There are only three super forces in the entire vast region -- the Wuji Empire, the solipsistic sect, and the southern Royal Family!”

“He Yuan belongs to the He clan. The He clan is the strongest existence among the first-rate forces below the three Super Forces!”

“After they have stabilized their footing in the vast sea area, we will look for he yuan. With the ability of the He clan in the vast sea area, we should be able to find Ling Jian ‘er faster!”

Wang Xian thought to himself. He thought of He Yuan who was located in the vast sea area, the Genius Beast Tamer.

The group of them flew along the sea and passed through a canyon that was only five kilometers wide. From the Sea of the flowing sea area, they entered the northern flowing sea.

After passing through the north flowing sea, they would arrive at the vast sea region.

The north flowing sea was extremely vast. If they wanted to pass through the north flowing sea, they would need to fly a distance of 300,000 kilometers. This was equivalent to flying from the easternmost part of the flowing sea region to the westernmost part.

300,000 kilometers. Even with Wang Xian’s speed, it would take a few days. It would take at least more than ten days to bring along the golden swordfish and the rest.

After flying to the north flowing sea, Wang Xian looked at the endless ocean in front of him. With a move of his body, he entered the sea directly.

Their speed in the water was much faster than in the sky.

There were all kinds of ferocious beasts at the bottom of the sea. Some of them were at the fifth or sixth level of the void interpretation realm.

Along the way, as long as the ferocious beasts were not courting death, Wang Xian did not have the time to kill them.

Sensing the extremely terrifying aura, Wang Xian and the rest took the initiative to take a detour.

The deep sea area reached a depth of 40,000 to 50,000 meters.

After traveling in the sea for more than ten days, the sea area became shallow. Wang Xian looked at a special ship in the sky. He knew that the vast area was approaching!
