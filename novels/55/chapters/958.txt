Chapter 959: 0960 sea monster

“What a huge loss, what a huge loss!”

The caravan continued to move forward. Supervisor du and elder Xiao’s bodies were trembling, and their faces were extremely unsightly.

All the mercenary groups present had their commissions doubled.

And the extra money was all from the Ivy and Xiao Chambers of commerce.

With this sum of spirit stones, they would lose at least a million middle-grade spirit stones on this trip.

After all, the price of a mercenary group was not low.

It would be better to follow the caravan from holy sea town to East Sea city, but to hire a mercenary group with an extraordinary fifth rank expert, it would cost 50,000 to 100,000 spirit stones.

After all, following the caravan was very low risk.

But if they didn’t follow the caravan and hired a mercenary group, it would cost at least 300,000 to 500,000 middle-grade spirit stones.

Now, the death of the transcendent rank 7 experts in the caravan had placed all the risk on the other mercenary groups.

The commission would be doubled. This time, their profit was only a million middle-grade spirit stones.

It wasn’t enough to compensate them.

Moreover, such a business wasn’t common. It would only appear when the monsters attacked the city.

Normally, it would be considered good if the profit was 100,000 middle-grade spirit stones.

However, they had no other choice. They no longer had a mercenary group. It was simply wishful thinking for them to reach the East China Sea by themselves!

“I didn’t expect there to be such a powerful formation in this interspatial ring!”

At this moment, Wang Xian and the rest continued to move forward. He sat on the carriage and flipped through the items in the interspatial ring. A smile appeared on his face.

Spirit explosion formation: one-time extraordinary level eight formation.

Trapping the opponent in the formation and causing the formation to explode in an instant, it could unleash a terrifying attack of an extraordinary level eight divine ability.

If caught off guard, even an extraordinary level eight powerhouse would be killed.

This one-time formation was worth quite a lot. It was worth at least tens of millions of middle-grade spirit stones.

Apart from this formation, the elixirs and various resources inside were also worth millions of middle-grade spirit stones.

An extraordinary level seven powerhouse was still very rich.

Wang Xian looked at the alligator king beside him and revealed a thoughtful expression.

“It’s a pity that this alligator king is not a demonic beast. Its intelligence is too low. Otherwise, I could have subdued some of them and used them as a mount. It would be too troublesome to nurture them again!”

Wang Xian thought to himself.

They continued forward. After driving for two hours, Wang Xian and the rest had already caught up with the caravan in front.

However, they did not meet the caravan. Instead, they staggered from one side to the other.

The entire caravan was slowed down because there were no transcendent level seven experts guarding it.

The speed of Wang Xian and the rest had increased a little.

The carriage was moving at a fast speed. With the strange monsters around, it was much safer along the way.

Some weak imperial crocodiles were killed directly.

After more than 20 hours, they successfully walked out of the Blackwater Swamp area.

This made Father Zhou and the rest heave a sigh of relief. Their faces were filled with joy.

“The journey for the next two days is relatively safe. We only need to climb over the wind arrow mountain to reach Donghai City safely!”

Father Zhou said to Wang Xian with a smile.

“Wind Arrow Mountain?”

Wang Xian nodded his head silently.

Wind Arrow Mountain was a mountain range that was connected to the ocean.

The entire mountain range was like a bow and arrow. Hence, it was called Wind Arrow Mountain.

The most dangerous thing in wind arrow mountain was not the ferocious beasts but the demonic beasts that lived there.

Demonic Beasts that were as intelligent as humans.

It would be fine if they did not encounter demonic beasts. However, it would be troublesome if they did!

In the next two days, just as Father Zhou said, they did not encounter any danger along the way.

“The Wind Arrow Mountain is ahead!”

Two days later, Father Zhou pointed ahead and said to them.

Wang Xian looked ahead and flew straight into the sky.

“The place that I can see looks like a bow and arrow!”

Wang Xian swept his gaze across and returned to the carriage.

“The ferocious beasts in the wind arrow mountain are all different types of ferocious beasts in the ocean. Any kind of ferocious beast can appear!”

“These ferocious beasts are not a threat. The ones that pose a greater threat are the demonic beasts here!”

“Demonic beasts have intelligence. They know how to cultivate. Medicinal pills are also very useful to them!” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“There are greedy demonic beasts controlling the ferocious beasts to attack the merchants passing by. If their strength is weaker, it would be difficult for them to escape!”

“To a certain extent, the wind arrow mountain is even more dangerous than the Blackwater Swamp!”

Father Zhou looked ahead and said to Wang Xian.

Wang Xian nodded his head. The path to the wind arrow mountain was also very difficult. They had to cross over the mountain ridges.

“Let’s Go!”

Everyone got off the carriage and escorted the items in the carriage to prevent them from falling off.

Wang Xian walked at the front and scanned his surroundings.

The area beside him was filled with seawater. Some of the seawater flowed down like a waterfall.

The entire area looked very beautiful.

Wang Xian and the rest slowed down completely as they climbed over the mountain peaks.

Fortunately, there were no other trees on the mountain peaks except for the craggy rocks. Otherwise, they wouldn’t be able to pass through this road.

“Dragon King, there’s a ferocious beast lying in ambush ahead. There’s a sea monster!”

After traveling for three hours and climbing over hundreds of mountain peaks, Ao Yao’s voice suddenly reached Wang Xian’s ears.

He raised his eyebrows, moved his body, and flew forward rapidly.

Behind their mountain peak, there were hundreds of ferocious beasts with six huge legs that looked like crabs lying densely on one side of the mountain peak.

Their rock-like color was a complete cover.

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered as he looked at the bottom of the mountain peak.

There was a small pit. It didn’t look very deep. A snow-white creature was hidden inside. Its intelligent eyes seemed to be waiting for the arrival of its prey.

When Wang Xian looked over, his eyes met with the creature’s.

The naked eye of an ordinary cultivator wouldn’t be able to see if there was a creature hidden in the small pit. However, Wang Xian had the eye technique.

In his line of sight, the three-meter-tall creature that was staring at Wang Xian suddenly squinted its eyes.

Wang Xian moved his body and flew directly into the small pit.

It was the first time he had seen a demonic beast.

Gulp

However, to Wang Xian’s surprise, the sea demon moved its body and disappeared from the pit.

“HMM, what’s This?”

Wang Xian looked over and realized that there was actually a hole in the small pit.

“Such high intelligence. If it senses danger, it can escape from here in an instant. Even a transcendent level nine powerhouse wouldn’t be able to stop it!”

Wang Xian was a little surprised.

Crack Crack Crack Crack

When the ghost-faced crabs that were being controlled saw Wang Xian, they attacked him directly.

This group of ghost-faced crabs were all at transcendent level 4 and Level 5. They looked extremely ferocious.

Without the demonic beast controlling them, they attacked Wang Xian crazily.

As they didn’t have high intelligence, they didn’t sense any danger from Wang Xian at all.

“There are more than three hundred of them, and they are still worth some spirit stones!”

Wang Xian smiled. With a wave of his arm, a large area of flames covered the area!
