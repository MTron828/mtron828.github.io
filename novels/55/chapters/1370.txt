Chapter 1371: 1371, under the terrified Dongyuan dynasty

They were afraid that the air would suddenly become quiet!

When the Dongyuan dynasty was only about two thousand meters away from the dragon and Phoenix dynasty, the entire army stopped.

They felt the strange atmosphere around them and looked up at the city wall.

On top, soldiers stood there with a mocking smile in their eyes.

This caused everyone in the Dongyuan dynasty to be slightly stunned. The 150,000 strong army looked around in shock.

The blood-red river was located in front of the city, and the thick smell of blood assaulted their nostrils.

The ground was covered with corpses.

In the middle of the corpses, there were close to 3,000 strange creatures cleaning something up.

Seeing them arrive, all the creatures stopped and stared at them with wild eyes.

Their bodies were stained with sticky blood, and every creature was exuding a terrifying power and murderous aura.

This was definitely not something that could be obtained by simply killing dozens of people.

Every creature had to kill at least hundreds of people to be able to condense such a terrifying murderous aura.

In the sky, the nine huge swaying flood dragons stared at them coldly.

“HMM, have we arrived? What’s going on?”

The king of the Dongyuan Kingdom who was lying on the palanquin felt the troops stop and the strange atmosphere around him. He immediately sat up.

Placing his hands on his knees, he pulled off his loose dragon robe and stared ahead.

“Long time no see, King of the Dongyuan Kingdom. Are you here to subvert our dragon-phoenix dynasty?”

Feng Luan’s voice rang out. She slowly floated into the sky and stared coldly at the Dongyuan Kingdom!

“HMM? Your Dragon and Phoenix dynasty wasn’t...”

Looking at the dragon and Phoenix Queen floating in the sky, the king of the Dongyuan Kingdom was slightly stunned. A trace of surprise flashed through his eyes.

Boom! Boom! Boom

However, before he could finish his words, he saw the generals on the city walls slowly flying toward the ground.

At the city gates, the soldiers of the dragon and Phoenix dynasty charged out with killing intent on their faces.

Against a force that wanted to destroy their dynasty, they could only return a tooth for a tooth, an eye for an eye!

“Roar Roar!”

In the sky, nine flood dragons roared. Their huge bodies swayed as they slowly surrounded them.

Seeing this scene, all the soldiers of the Dongyuan dynasty were stunned.

They had just arrived, and before they were ready to attack, the enemy had already started to slowly approach them.

What was more frightening was that the dragon-phoenix dynasty didn’t seem to have suffered much loss.

Then...

Where did the hundreds of thousands of corpses on the ground come from?

“Could it be?”

A thought suddenly appeared in everyone’s mind. As they looked at these terrifying creatures, their expressions slowly began to change.

The entire sky was silent.

Only the cold expressions of the dragon and Phoenix dynasty soldiers could be seen.

“You... you killed the Star Moon Dynasty?”

An Dongyuan dynasty insightful emptiness realm expert saw this scene and had a bad premonition in his heart. He asked with a shocked expression.

“If you want to destroy us, then we will also kill the enemy!”

Feng Luan’s incomparably cold voice rang out in their ears, causing the expressions of all the Dongyuan dynasty soldiers to change greatly.

The dragon-phoenix Dynasty had actually killed the three invading armies of the star-moon Dynasty!

Then...

They looked at the nine long and thirty terrifying creatures in the sky, looking at the demonic beasts that were emitting monstrous demonic qi and violent lightning.

“Boom!”

At this moment, the king of the Dongyuan dynasty who was sitting in the sedan suddenly stood up, his gaze fixed on the nine flood dragons in the sky, the demon monkey and the thunder shrimp in front of him.

His arm trembled slightly and he looked at the information in front of him.

There were not many words on the information, but there were a few pictures on it.

These were all sent by the spies planted by the Dongyuan dynasty in the one leaf continent.

Among them, there were three pictures that were more eye-catching. One of them was a thirty-meter long flood dragon.

One of them was a devil monkey with monstrous Devil Qi, and the other was a thunder prawn covered in lightning.

The pictures were very realistic. They were exactly the same as the three creatures in front of them.

“How... How is this possible? Why is that mysterious force...”

“Killing us? Dragon Phoenix Queen, you killed an envoy of our Dongyuan dynasty for no reason. Do you really think that our Dongyuan dynasty is afraid of You? Do you want to give us an explanation?”

The king of the Dongyuan dynasty stood there and muttered. Suddenly, a burly old man on the left took two steps forward with an angry expression. He stared at everyone in front of him with a cold expression and shouted loudly.

His words caused the expression of the king of the Dongyuan dynasty to change drastically.

“Shut up!”

He hurriedly shouted at the old man who spoke. His tone quickly changed as he cupped his hands towards Feng Luan. “It’s a misunderstanding!”

“Your Majesty, the Dongyuan dynasty is not here to find trouble with you. We are here to help you. That’s right, we are here to help you fight against the three dynasties!”

“However, we didn’t expect that you would destroy them all. Hehe, Congratulations!”

The Dongyuan King squeezed out a smile and said, “Since the dragon and Phoenix dynasty is safe and sound, we will leave now and return to the Palace!”

Finally, he said the word ‘return to the Palace'in a somewhat hurried manner.

“HMM?”

Everyone in the entire Dongyuan Empire was stupefied as they looked at their king with a face full of astonishment.

This... This F * ck?

The king was here to make a joke?

Some of the generals frowned slightly. When they saw the king’s tone of submission, their eyes flickered with a luster.

“Return to the palace, immediately return to the Palace!”

A few insightful emptiness realm experts understood the situation and said hurriedly.

“Since you’re here, don’t Leave!”

At this moment, Wang Xian’s voice rang out.

He didn’t understand why the Dongyuan dynasty was so cowardly and left immediately. However, the express delivery that was delivered to them didn’t allow them to leave.

Wang Xian waved his arm. The Five Elements Millstone flew into the sky and covered an area of two kilometers. It covered the 150,000 troops of the Dongyuan dynasty.

“Roar! Roar!” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Seeing the Dragon King making his move, the members of the Dragon Palace roared and charged at the 150,000 soldiers of the Dongyuan dynasty.

The 3,000 creatures charged at the 150,000 soldiers. It looked a little comical, but it was true.

“Run! Everyone, run! Run Now!”

However, what shocked everyone even more was that the king of the Dongyuan dynasty’s expression changed drastically. With a roar, his body moved. Without any hesitation, he fled into the distance.

“What?”

All the generals and soldiers of the Dongyuan dynasty were somewhat stunned when they saw the king flee.

“Flee immediately. The other party is the faction that destroyed the Sky Island dynasty and the one leaf continent dynasty. Immediately!”

When the Dongyuan king saw the 150,000 soldiers of the Dongyuan dynasty who were somewhat stunned, he turned his head and roared with an extremely embarrassed expression.

“How is this possible? Destroy the factions of the Sky Island dynasty and the one leaf continent dynasty?”

“What? This... The King said...”

When the terrified voice of the Dongyuan king sounded again, everyone trembled.

Destroy the forces of the one-leaf Mainland dynasty and the Sky Island dynasty?

The one-leaf mainland dynasty was an existence that was even more powerful than their Dongyuan dynasty.

“Run!”

Everyone in the Dongyuan dynasty was scared to death!
