Chapter 574: Unparalleled In Refining Elixir Pills And Equipment (3)

“This cannot be possible... This definitely cannot be possible...”

If one said that Wang Xian was a blacksmith master and he could forge a Level 11 spiritual equipment in ten minutes, it would already be enough to make one feel a sense of disbelief.

If one was to tell him that Wang Xian was also an alchemist master, this... He definitely wouldn’t believe it.

An unparalleled genius in both fields? There was probably not a single person throughout history and into the future who would be so demon-like. At this moment, Ye Feng’s understanding of the world was thrown into disarray.

He definitely wouldn’t believe there would be a single person who was an alchemist master and blacksmith master at the same time.

It was especially so considering that this person looked just like a young, twenty-year-old man.

“This cannot be possible! Some blacksmiths spend their entire lives engrossed in refining equipment and yet they find it hard to reach the realm of a blacksmith master. Some alchemists spent their entire lives refining elixir pills and yet they can’t refine Level 6 spiritual pills. I don’t believe it. I don’t believe you are an alchemist master!”

Ye Feng could no longer hold back as he screamed at Wang Xian.

He was an alchemist himself and was widely regarded as the most outstanding alchemist in the younger generation of the entire Yong Chang world.

Even so, he could barely refine Level 5 elixir pills currently. Moreover, his success rate was a meager twenty percent.

In other words, he would only succeed once with five sets of materials.

A success rate like this wasn’t high for an alchemist. However, considering his age, it was a commendable achievement.

In fact, if he could use a Level 13 alchemy furnace, he could still give Level 6 elixir pills a shot. Level 6 elixir pills were also considered to be the benchmark of a grandmaster.

Yet, this man who was even younger than him claimed to be an alchemist master. He couldn’t believe him.

As an alchemist, he knew the difficulties of refining elixir pills.

Huh?

Wang Xian raised an eyebrow, looked to Ye Feng and said, “What do you even know?”

“What do I know?”

Hearing Wang Xian questioning him, Ye Feng’s expression turned as cold as ice. He stared intensely at Wang Xian and replied in a solemn voice, “What do I know? I’ve been refining elixir pills since I was ten years old. I was once guided by an Immortal Realm expert and can even refine Level 5 elixir pills currently. You are asking me what I know?

“In the entire Yong Chang world, if my Ye Family claimed to be second in refining elixir pills, no one would dare to claim to be first! You are asking me what I know?

“Are you questioning my ability?” Ye Feng’s lips curved into a smirk.

“I can’t deny you are a blacksmith master. However, if you are saying you are both a blacksmith master and alchemist master, it’s impossible! I have the capital to deny your claims!”

Ye Feng stared harshly at Wang Xian as he shouted coldly.

Hehe!

Wang Xian looked at him with contempt.

The surrounding disciples from Mt. Xue frowned upon hearing Ye Feng’s questions. They were a little doubtful. However, Wang Xian completing Level 11 spiritual equipment in an insanely short period had convinced many of these disciples. They were merely suspecting and doubting but not refuting the possibility completely.

“You are questioning his identity as an alchemist master now? Didn’t you say if he could forge the spiritual equipment in ten minutes, you would eat it?”

When Mu Wanbai heard Ye Feng, she remarked in this way. Her irk for him had grown as she grumbled softly.

“Shut up! Don’t speak if you don’t understand anything!”

Ye Feng heard Mu Wanbai, turned to her instantly and shouted.

When Mu Wanbai heard him shouting at her, she was shocked initially. However, this quickly turned to anger.

The disciples from Mt. Xue were also shocked when Ye Feng shouted at Mu Wanbai.

“Young Master Ye Feng, please watch your actions and words!”

Piao Lingxue looked coldly at Ye Feng and reminded. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Hehe! A family of alchemists? A supreme talent?”

Wang Xian looked to a disciple from Mt. Xue and said, “Pass me the spiritual medicine you have prepared!”

“Huh? Handsome master, you are...”

The girl was surprised but still took out the spiritual medicine from her bag. There was a total of seventy-five spiritual medicines with three sets of each variety.

These were the materials for refining Level 5 elixir pills.

“To slap the face of a pile of trash!” Wang Xian replied directly.

“YOU...”

Ye Feng’s expression was contorted from anger after hearing Wang Xian. His eyes were cold and he didn’t take the warning from Piao Lingxue to heart!

“Here, handsome master!”

The girl handed the spiritual medicine she’d brought to Wang Xian.

“Hmm? Channels Cleansing Pill?” Wang Xian looked at the materials and asked the girl.

“Yeah! Level 5 elixir pill, Channels Cleansing Pill!”

The girl nodded her head as she replied right away. Her bright eyes remained fixed on Wang Xian.

Wang Xian moved his arms and the area before him was shrouded in water energy right away.

Wang Xian squinted his eyes while placing the tufts of spiritual medicine on it. Gradually, they melted.

“Refining elixir pills on the spot! Handsome master is going to refine elixir pills before us. Could it be that he’s really an alchemist master?”

“Handsome master is so confident of it. He definitely is an alchemist master! He’s too cool!”

“Oh, he’s so stunning. A blacksmith master that also knows about refining elixir pills. If only I could find a husband like him!”

When the group of female disciples saw Wang Xian starting to refine elixir pills before them, they were certain that Wang Xian was an incredible alchemist master.

They looked at Wang Xian and could feel their hearts palpitating rapidly.

A blacksmith master who was quite possibly also an alchemist master. Who could possibly be a match to an unparalleled demon-like talent like him?

No one!

“Art of Water Refining, Art of Water Refining!”

When Ye Feng saw that Wang Xian had started refining elixir pills before him, he had a bad premonition.

Nonetheless, he still refused to believe a person could be so demon-like.

“What incredible and precise control! His Art of Water Refining is really strong!”

Piao Lingxue saw Wang Xian starting to refine elixir pills with the Art of Water Refining. Seeing his control over water energy, she was astonished.

She was completely in awe over the extent of the control, as she was certain that she didn’t possess such ability.

Seeing Wang Xian refining elixir pills with the Art of Water Refining, Ye Feng’s expression was constantly changing.

He specialized in the Art of Refining Elixir Pills with fire. As for the Art of Water Refining, he wasn’t adept at it.

Even so, he could still see the smooth actions of Wang Xian.

The spiritual medicine dissolved rapidly and was soon separated and combined.

He was really, really fast.

“He’s insanely fast. I once saw an alchemist refine elixir pills with the Art of Water Refining. However, he was a lot slower than the handsome master!” a girl saw Wang Xian’s actions and exclaimed.

“Form, form, form, form!”

At this moment, Wang Xian shouted softly. At the surface of the water screen, droplets of elixir pills coalesced rapidly.

Following this, they cooled rapidly with the help of water energy.

“Done!” Wang Xian shouted. Moving his hand across, four elixir pills hovered in the air before him.

He lifted his head nonchalantly, looked across the crowd and eventually at Ye Feng.

“Trash! Look! Level 5 elixir pills, Channels Cleansing Pills!”
