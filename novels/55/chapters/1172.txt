Chapter 1173: 1174 dragon and Phoenix Empire auction

Translator: 5496903

Three days passed in a flash.

Wang Xian opened his eyes and looked at the five girls who were still cultivating beside him. A smile appeared on his face.

Some time ago, after the few girls got bored of playing in the dragon and Phoenix Royal City, they devoted themselves to cultivating.

Lan Qingyue left the Dragon Palace in pursuit of strength. This gave the few girls a lot of pressure. This made them not want to be too far away from Qing Yue.

Xiao Yu was cultivating on a mountain beside the Dragon King’s palace while Feng Lingtian had entered the dragon and Phoenix Empire and became a city guard.

In his words, as a man, he couldn’t just stay here all day. He had to make a name for himself.

Wang Xian naturally didn’t stop his brother-in-law’s ambition.

“The auction of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire starts today. Let’s go and take a look!”

Wang Xian moved and flew towards the location outside the Dragon Palace.

“In the time of two people, the entire dragon and Phoenix royal city has undergone tremendous changes!”

Floating in the sky, Wang Xian looked at the huge city in front of him with a smile on his face.

Compared to the previous Shenghai Town, the current Dragon and Phoenix Royal City had expanded by ten times.

The city walls that were dozens of meters tall were now close to a hundred meters tall. From Afar, it looked like a majestic lion lying on the prairie.

Terrifying energy was gathered on the towers that were hundreds of meters tall.

Void interpretation level formations covered the entire city.

The defensive formation of the dragon-phoenix Royal City alone was not something that an ordinary kingdom could compete with.

“CHIRP CHIRP!”

At this moment, the chirping of birds and beasts could be heard from the sky. Wang Xian raised his head and looked over. A hint of surprise could be seen on his face.

A huge green bird that was about ten meters in size with its wings spread out flew towards the Dragon-phoenix royal city. Each of its wings was emitting a green glow.

The entire huge bird seemed to be riding on the wind as it emitted a powerful aura.

“A half-step void interpretation level ferocious beast!”

Wang Xian looked at the five to six people above him. His eyes were sparkling.

There was a void interpretation expert.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

At this moment, there were sounds of tremors coming from below. Wang Xian looked over.

There were four ferocious beasts that were like lions. They were earthy yellow in color and had golden fur. They were about five meters in size.

Behind them was a luxurious palanquin. The palanquin was golden in color. It was rushing towards them from afar.

Its speed was extremely terrifying.

“Four earth-gold lion beasts of transcendent level nine!”

Wang Xian looked over and his pupils constricted slightly.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

At this moment, beams of auroras came from the sky.

He turned his head quickly and saw a middle-aged man dressed in white flying towards them on his flying sword. He looked extremely elegant.

“There are many strong practitioners here!”

Wang Xian looked over and his eyes were filled with surprise. Just the group of people he saw had three insightful void stage powerhouses.

In that case, there would be at least 20 to 30 insightful void stage powerhouses in the auction of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire, or even more.

After all, there would be a demonic beast bloodline of the insightful void stage in this auction.

This item would definitely be a crazy treasure in the flowing sea region.

The huge city gate was 50 to 60 meters tall, and the thickness of the city wall was more than 10 meters.

Wang Xian came to the position at the city gate and saw rows of soldiers of the dragon and Phoenix army standing in a row with cold eyes.

Two half-step insightful void tier powerhouses and ten extraordinary level nine powerhouses were standing at the side to prevent anyone from causing trouble.

“TSK TSK, this dragon and Phoenix Empire that suddenly appeared is so powerful. I’ve never heard of it before, but there are quite a number of powerhouses!”

“I heard that this dragon-phoenix Empire has just been established not too long ago. However, it should have some strength. Even star-moon kingdom can’t do anything about it!”

A few armored members of the mercenary group looked at the soldiers beside them, and a hint of fear appeared in their eyes.

The other experts, even those from the royal families of other countries and powerful sects, were also slightly surprised when they saw the soldiers around the dragon-phoenix Empire and the array formation inside.

“I wonder if this dragon-phoenix Empire will become a crucian carp crossing the river or a fish leaping over the Dragon Gate!”

Some of the experts with extraordinary statuses glanced around and commented indifferently.

To some experts from other countries, the strength of the dragon-phoenix Empire could only be considered not bad.

However, it was still far from becoming a powerful empire that stood tall in the flowing sea region.

However, to some ordinary mercenary group members, the dragon-phoenix Empire wasn’t simple at all.

This was especially true for the star-moon kingdom’s mercenary groups. To the nearby Wind Howl Empire and the Darning Empire’s mercenary group members and families, the dragon-phoenix imperial city had clearly shocked them a lot.

Especially the city protection array, which made their hearts burn with passion.

If they could live in this city, at the very least, their safety would be extremely good.

“Eh? There’s actually a recruitment here. The dragon-phoenix dynasty is recruiting a large number of powerful mercenary group members to live in and recruit experts!”

After passing through the city gate, there was an eye-catching sign at the entrance — recruitment.

The main purpose of the large-scale auction held by Feng Luan was to attract experts and attract people to live in the dragon-phoenix Imperial City.

The Dragon-phoenix royal city, which had been expanded tenfold, could accommodate more than ten million people. However, the population was only less than two million.

The dragon-phoenix dynasty urgently needed a large number of people, experts, and mercenary groups to live in the city.

Moreover, they were given very good treatment.

This was a very good opportunity for many outsiders.

The spiritual energy and safety of the dragon-phoenix Imperial city was not something that other cities could compare to.

Furthermore, joining the dragon-phoenix dynasty would bring great benefits. If one had the strength, one could even become an official.

This made many people extremely tempted.

The members of the mercenary group from the surrounding countries excitedly asked for information one by one.

As for the experts and sect experts from other countries, they did not bother with them and continued to walk in.

Although the spiritual energy in the dragon-phoenix royal city was more abundant and it was much safer compared to other royal cities, it wasn’t very attractive to those who had powerful families.

Their families and sects also had their own formations, so the spiritual energy was even more abundant than the spiritual energy in the dragon-phoenix Royal City.

However, Feng Luan didn’t expect the families with a profound void martial artist to settle down in the Dragon-phoenix royal city, so she didn’t care about their thoughts. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“So many people!”

When Wang Xian was walking on the brand new road, his gaze swept across the surroundings. His face was filled with astonishment.

When Wang Xian came a few days ago, the number of people in the entire royal city of Dragon and Phoenix was still very small. In just a few days, there were at least hundreds of thousands of people who came here.

“Looks like this auction is still very attractive!”

Wang Xian revealed a faint smile and quickened his pace as he walked towards the location of the auction house.

The auction house was located at the newly built Eastern District of the Dragon and Phoenix Royal City.

The entire auction house occupied an area of 2,000 meters. The huge auction house could accommodate 50,000 to 60,000 people.

The scale of this auction house was already considered rare!
