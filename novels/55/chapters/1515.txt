Chapter 1516: In the 1516 purification bar

“Then Uncle Hu, do you think that the sky demon is an evil person or a good person?”

Wang Xian heard what old Hu said and asked thoughtfully.

“To be able to destroy millions of lives in one night, do you think he is an evil person or a good person?”

Old Hu asked with a smile.

“An evil person!”

Wang Xian replied.

“Everyone has a judgment. In a world where the strong are respected, good and bad can not be distinguished. The strong and weak can be distinguished. Killing does not represent a person’s good and bad!”

Old Hu smiled and said with a smile.

“Then, Uncle Hu, what’s the difference between darkness and Light?”

Wang Xian continued to ask Old Hu.

“What’s the difference between darkness and light? Haha, Young Man, I, an old man, can answer your question!”

“I became a radiant priest halfway through. Do you know what attribute I cultivated before I became a radiant priest?”

“Darkness attribute. You wouldn’t believe it, right? I once cultivated darkness attribute and was attacked by darkness in the ruins of the divine kingdom. I lost all my strength and survived!”

“After surviving, I became an ordinary person without any cultivation. I wasn’t even comparable to a child and couldn’t cultivate darkness attribute. Later, I changed to light attribute and became a radiant priest!”

“Let me tell you. There is no difference between darkness and light. The difference lies in the controller of Darkness and light!”

Old Hu drank his wine and chatted with him.

Wang Xian nodded as he was deep in thought.

“Listening to Uncle Hu’s words really benefited me a lot!”

Wang Xian raised the Teacup in his hand and said faintly.

“Haha, you are interesting. You are like an old man at such a young age!”

The tiger patted his shoulder.

During this period of time, Wang Xian had entered a misunderstanding. His heart was focused on the light, and he could not obtain the light.

Strength was cultivated by oneself. The so-called instant enlightenment and instant godhood was a complete lie.

Focusing on one’s heart was the correct path of cultivation.

Wang Xian understood in his heart. Some of the shackles in his heart were slowly lifted.

“Let’s Go!”

Not long after, a voice was heard.

“Let’s Go!”

Old Hu kept his things and walked into the car.

“You guys go first. I’m outside. I Won’t enter the car!”

The girl who was standing beside Li Si said.

The old woman nodded her head and the rest of the group returned to the car.

The few women were obviously more familiar with the few girls as they conversed in a low voice.

Wang Xian was still reading the books about the priest of light. Although he had a deeper understanding of the heart of light and darkness, he could use another method to balance the light and darkness.

However, he did not leave. The trip to the ruins of the Kingdom of God could also solve the problem of the balance of light and darkness.

Furthermore, he was confident that he could balance the light and darkness within two months at most.

This made him in a good mood.

“There is a corner of the Kingdom of God Forest ahead. After traveling for 1,000 kilometers, we will reach the Kingdom of God Forest. Everyone, pay attention!”

After traveling for more than two days, the voices of the judgement mercenary group could be heard from outside.

“Young man, this is your first time coming to the Kingdom of God ruins. The Kingdom of God ruins is huge. The forest around the Kingdom of God ruins is even bigger and there are many dangers inside!”

“Even if it’s just a corner of the forest of the Kingdom of God, it’s still extremely dangerous!”

Old Hu said to Wang Xian from the side.

“With the people from the judgement mercenary group around, we will be fine. The leader of the judgement mercenary group has the strength of a half-step void interpretation stage!”

A female student at the side said confidently, “This is my first time here too. I want to go out and take a look!”

As she spoke, she immediately went out to look for a young man named Li Si.

“It’s good to be young. Young Man, your looks are not bad. You can also... Haha!”

Old Hu teased Wang Xian.

“Looks are a part of it, but strength is also a part of it!”

A girl in the car said softly.

“You’re right. We priests of light have to find someone who can protect us!”

A woman nodded in agreement.

“Hey, what are you guys talking about? This old man is still looking for a wife. Haha!”

Old Hu heard their conversation and said with a smile.

“Old Priest Hu, you are very strong. You can find him even if you want to!”

The girl next to him immediately said with a smile.

Wang Xian smiled at the side. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Ah!”

“Be careful, be careful!”

At this moment, a scream and exclamation came from outside.

The old lady in the car was slightly shocked.

“What happened?”

He quickly walked out.

Old Hu also frowned slightly.

“We have walked this road more than ten times. Usually, we rarely encounter powerful demonic beasts. Let’s go out!”

As he spoke, he walked out immediately as well.

Wang Xian and the rest followed closely behind.

“Hiss, it’s a natural moat demon. It’s actually a natural moat demon!”

As soon as Wang Xian walked out, he saw an endless forest in front of him. The trees in this forest were not green or cyan in color.

Instead, they were black, pitch-black trees.

An exclamation came from the old lady’s mouth. She stared at a black shadow on the surrounding trees with an extremely embarrassed expression.

The humanoid black shadow was two meters tall. They only had one eye, located between their eyebrows.

The eye was very long and looked very terrifying.

It had long arms, sharp claws, and its entire body was covered in sharp thorns.

Heavenly Moat Demons, a group of powerful demonic beasts in the divine kingdom forest.

More than ten heavenly moat demons stood on the trees in front of them, staring at them with a bloodthirsty eye.

“Fifteen natural moat demons, we’re in trouble now!”

Old Hu looked at the more than ten demons in front of him, and his pupils contracted slightly. He took a deep breath.

“How could it be? How could there be more than ten natural moat demons in this corner? No, no...”

The girls and women behind him looked at them with fear on their faces.

“More than thirty humans, that’s too little!”

In the middle, a moat demon held a corpse in his hand and was tearing at it, making a terrifying sound.

His mouth was split open to the bottom of his eyes, and his teeth were densely packed.

“Gulp!”

“We... we’re willing to take out everything. Can you let us off?”

At this moment, the leader of the judgement mercenary group gulped and said to the fifteen moat demons in fear.

Among the 15 demons, the lowest was at level nine of the supernatural realm. Half of them were at the half-step void interpretation realm.

On the other hand, the judgement mercenary group only had two half-step void interpretation realm demons. They were no match for them at all!

“Prepare to escape!”

At this moment, Old Hu’s voice rang in the ears of Wang Xian and the rest.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

However, the moment Old Hu’s voice faded, all the members of the judgement mercenary group, who were holding onto their weapons, fled to the back.

This action made the faces of Old Hu and the others extremely ugly.

“Run, life or death is up to fate!”

Old Hu roared and immediately turned around.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

However, just as they were about to escape, a sword light slashed directly in front of them.

This was to use their lives to buy them a little time!
