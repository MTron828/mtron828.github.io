Chapter 537: A Real Man Faces A Strong Opponent Directly (2)

Wang Xian hugged his arms as he looked at the two supreme experts. With a smile contained in his mouth, he was waiting for the grand war to arrive.

“Emperor Qi, you must avenge Crimson Bug. The Dragon King of Dragon Sect just killed all our clan members of Crimson Bug!”

Out of the blue, the leader of Crimson Bug reported to Emperor Qi of Diabolism with grief and indignation on his face.

“Mm!”

Emperor Qi, who was standing in the air, lowered his chin slowly as he looked at the grievous leader of Crimson Bug. He turned his head slowly towards Wang Xian. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Sect Leader, the Dragon King and Dragon Sect barged into Dong Hua yesterday and slew Supreme Elder Zhou, along with fifteen Inborn disciples and hundreds of our elites!”

Upon seeing the leader of the Crimson Bug making complaints to Emperor Qi, Nie Wuya hesitated before he reported to Nie Wushuang too.

Sect Leader Nie Wushuang was still unaware of the fact that the experts of Donghua Sacred Sect had been killed yesterday.

“How dare you kill the disciples of Donghua Sacred Sect!”

Nie Wushuang narrowed his eyes as he peered over his shoulder and looked at Wang Xian.

At the foot of the tallest peak of Huashan, the Dragon King of Dragon Sect stood out the most.

With more than two hundred people standing in a separate line, they were divided out from the orthodox and devil sides.

At the same time, all of the people were bowing down with respect just now. Only a group of them stood there with smiles on their faces.

Emperor Qi looked at the Dragon Sect!

Nie Wushuang did the same thing too!

Upon seeing this, all the Underworld people held their breath with blank looks.

In particular, the people from Donghua Sacred Sect and Diabolism who had a feud with the Dragon Sect.

“Both Nie Wushuang and Emperor Qi are looking in the Dragon King’s direction. I bet they are finished this time!”

“They received two supreme experts’ attention, making enemies with two expert forces. This time, Dragon Sect is completely doomed!”

“This time, Dragon Sect really played with fire. No one can save them now!”

“Do you guys think Nie Wushuang or Emperor Qi would readily exterminate Dragon Sect before their fight?”

“Possible. Given their invincible combat power, they might be able to annihilate Dragon Sect within a minute.”

“Dragon Sect seems to have recruited another hundred-odd disciples. What a pity that the Dragon King has offended Emperor Qi and Nie Wushuang. They will definitely strike!”

Those forces who stood far in the back were having discussions in soft voices as they witnessed the event unfolding.

Provoking the two supreme experts from orthodox sects and Diabolism would only bring the Dragon King down.

“I think the Dragon King is a cool and dashing person. Why does Sect Leader Nie Wushuang want to kill him? Gosh, he’s a good man!”

“Shut up, Xun’er. Stop spouting nonsense. Under such circumstances, annihilating Dragon Sect is inevitable, and it was caused by his overly unscrupulous actions!”

“Mum, but he destroyed two powerful dominations of Diabolism. Why...”

“Lass, stop your comments if you don’t know anything. No one is to blame except him. All the Sacred Sects and Sacred Clans dislike his way of doing things. Such an existence is just like hugging a suicide bomb. None of us want to get ourselves blown up!”

Back in one of the spots at the foot of Huashan summit, the girl who had cried at the sight of Crimson Bug commented with discontent. Her mother was staring at her, giving her a lecture.

The girl pouted in dissatisfaction. “I’m supporting Dragon King, no matter what!”

This statement drew the harsh gaze of her mother.

“Heh heh!”

Seeing that both Nie Wushuang and Emperor Qi were looking at him, Wang Xian revealed a faint smile with his lips drawn.

“An ant. Let me kill Nie Wushuang first before I slaughter them without any effort!”

Emperor Qi was expressionless when he looked at Wang Xian. Then he turned to glower at Nie Wushuang.

“He’s not worth me striking. After I defeat Emperor Qi, you guys can just exterminate them!” said Nie Wushuang in an icy tone as he swept his gaze at Wang Xian and the Dragon Sect members.

Contempt!

Outright contempt!

Regardless of whether it was Emperor Qi or Nie Wushuang, neither of them regarded Dragon King highly.

To them, they only had one enemy; and that was the one standing before each other.

They would not delay their battle just for an insignificant ant or a weakling.

“Gosh, the overbearing supreme experts. The Dragon King of Dragon Sect is already powerful, but neither Emperor Qi nor Nie Wushuang regards him highly.”

“The Dragon King is indeed strong, but he’s just the strongest at our level. In their eyes, he is a nobody who could be killed anytime!”

“This is the spirit of a supreme expert. We’re impressed by them. Dragon King, who could stir up a ruckus, was not even regarded as being in their league.”

What Nie Wushuang and Emperor Qi had said astounded the members from the Underworld and Diabolism.

This was the demeanor displayed by supreme experts.

They simply disregarded everyone, for they had only one opponent; the rest were not fit for them to waste their energies on.

Upon hearing what his Sect Leader said, a hint of admiration emerged in Nie Wuya’s eyes.

All the disciples of Donghua Sacred Sect were wearing faces that were complacent and prideful.

Look, here’s our Sect Leader, the strongest expert in the Underworld.

Don’t act brazen, Dragon Sect. It will be your death after our Sect Leader kills his enemy.

The two leaders from Crimson Bug revealed a smile, looking elated.

“After Emperor Qi slays his strong opponent and annihilates Dragon Sect, I will pledge my loyalty to Emperor Qi!”

The two leaders of Crimson Bug clenched their fists in allegiance.

Emperor Qi nodded his head impassively as he turned to Nie Wushuang again.

“Hmph, Dragon King. Your death will come when my Sect Leader defeats his opponent!”

Nie Wuya stared at Wang Xian, growling at him with a face of coldness.

“After their battle, it will mark the end of Dragon Sect!”

Be it Diabolism or Donghua Sacred Sect, they had made their stands clear that they would be exterminating Dragon Sect after the battle.

None of the ancestral sects and clans commented, as they just followed the flow.

The entire atmosphere of the battle had changed drastically.

“The orthodox sect and Diabolism were supposed to be at loggerheads, and they vowed to kill each other. Yet, the situation had developed to both wanting Dragon Sect to be annihilated.”

“I must say that a force that has arrived at this stage is considered impressive.”

Some of them expressed their approval secretly as they looked at Dragon Sect. Some of them had pity in their eyes as they heard the gloating over Dragon Sect’s misfortunes.

“Ant?”

“Not fit to fight with him?”

Upon hearing Nie Wushuang and Emperor Qi, coldness flashed in Wang Xian’s eyes as he looked at their scornful eyes.

“Looking down on me, hur!”

Wang Xian curled his lips slightly as he stared at the supreme experts who were confronting each other with flickering eyes. He sensed the mocking gazes from the surroundings, and a faint battling intent surged in his heart.

“I wanted to wait for both of you to have an outcome, or perhaps, reap the benefit after both of you were wounded. But I guess this wasn’t cool at all!”

Wang Xian slowly lowered his chin with a fighting spirit filling his eyes.

“If that’s the case, I’ll show the two supreme experts that you guys don’t rule the Underworld!

“A real man should face a strong opponent!

“And a supreme one!”
