Chapter 1628: The 1628 army arrived

A terrifying and invincible army descended upon the Dragon and Phoenix Empire!

This information was quickly transmitted to the cities and headed towards the Dragon and Phoenix Empire.

The current Liuhai region was very different from the previous Liuhai region.

The entire region was completely controlled by the Dragon and Phoenix Empire. be it the families, sects, or sects, they were all restricted.

A single word from the dragon and Phoenix Empress could destroy any clan or force.

However, within the short period of time when the Dragon and Phoenix Empire was unified, all the passageways of the cities were opened up.

Vicious Beasts attacking cities? Demonic Beasts wreaking havoc?

They didn’t exist at all.

Once a city, even if it was a town, encountered a vicious beast attacking a city, all they needed was a single piece of information, and the Dragon and Phoenix Empire’s army would immediately head over.

In the past, at least a few cities in the Liuhai region were attacked by ferocious beasts every year, and tens of millions of people were eaten by ferocious beasts.

Now, this wouldn’t happen at all.

Order entered every corner of the Liuhai region.

This made the people of the Liuhai region feel extremely grateful towards the dragon and Phoenix Empress.

The entire Liuhai region was flourishing, and there were more and more experts.

“Report, there’s news from Liu City that a terrifying and invincible army has arrived at the Dragon and Phoenix Empire. One expert killed hundreds of thousands of people in two moves!”

The news quickly reached the Imperial Palace of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire.

“What? An Invincible Army has arrived? Killed hundreds of thousands of people in Liu City in two moves?”

The expressions of the important officials of the empire changed drastically when they heard the news.

“Her Majesty the Empress is in the Dragon Palace now. Report immediately!”

The expression of the important minister of the Dragon and Phoenix dynasty changed drastically, and he hurriedly flew toward the Dragon Palace.

The Dragon Palace was not very far away from the imperial city, so the information was quickly transmitted to Feng Luan.

“What?”

Feng Luan, who was with Lan Qingyue, Guan Shuqing, and the other girls, had a drastic change in expression.

“The range of one move can cover a radius of ten kilometers. Only an expert at the ninth rank of the profound void martial stage can do that!”

“An invincible army of more than 100,000 appeared near the north flowing sea and came to destroy us. It must be a vast area. Could it be?”

Feng Luan’s expression changed slightly, and her thoughts turned a hundred times in an instant. Her expression slowly became solemn.

“Could it be that the experts from the vast area came to our flowing sea area?”

Guan Shuqing and the other girls also realized the seriousness of the problem and asked with an embarrassed expression.

“100% . Since they dared to come, then the Wuji Empire must have come!”

Feng Luan said with a gloomy face.

They had come.

She didn’t expect that the Wuji Empire had actually killed their way to the flowing sea region.

They didn’t have any enmity with the Wuji Empire. Now that they had given up on the vast region, they were still chasing after them.

Those who didn’t know would think that there was some deep enmity.

“The Wuji Empire’s methods are very ruthless. Once they provoke them, it’s best to eradicate them. They’re not wrong, but...”

A monstrous flame appeared in Feng Luan’s eyes.

“Let’s Go!”

Feng Luan’s expression was somewhat ugly as she immediately flew towards the dragon-phoenix Imperial City.

“We’ll go too. Prime Minister Gui, send the members of the Dragon Palace to the dragon-phoenix Imperial City!”

Lan Qingyue and the other girls said with serious expressions.

“It’s the Dragon Queen!”

Prime Minister Gui frowned and nodded.

The group quickly flew into the imperial city.

The imperial city was transformed from the tomb of a demi-human, and the entire dynasty was enormous.

It had the prodigy stage and many other paradises.

The main hall became the center of the dynasty.

There were no city walls in the Imperial City because the Invincible Dragon and Phoenix dynasty didn’t need city walls.

“Enter Alert!”

“Prepare for battle in the north!”

Feng Luan flew into the imperial city and immediately shouted.

Her cold voice resounded throughout the entire imperial city.

“What’s the situation?”

“Alert? Alert for what? who dares to invade our dragon and Phoenix Dynasty?”

“Is there an invasion? Is it a fierce beast or something?”

“Who dares to invade our Dragon and Phoenix Empire? They are courting death!”

There were sixty to seventy million people in the entire dragon and Phoenix Imperial City. Most of the experts in the Liuhai region were gathered here.

When they heard Feng Luan’s voice, all of them had shocked expressions on their faces.

Who Dared to invade the Invincible Dragon and Phoenix Empire in the Liuhai region.

“Alert? The North? Could it be?”

However, when the soldiers and generals who had followed Feng Luan to fight in the vast area heard these two words, they all had solemn expressions on their faces.

“Could it be? The experts from the vast area are here, right?”

“If they are here, then the experts from the Wuji Empire are definitely here. Not Good!”

The expressions of the soldiers and generals changed drastically.

“Quick, quick, head to the north immediately!”

All the soldiers immediately flew towards the north.

Because there were no city walls, everyone stood on the plains.

In less than five minutes, hundreds of thousands of soldiers stood in neat rows.

In the sky, void interpretation experts rode on all kinds of powerful mounts.

Many experts of the demonic beast clan also floated in the sky.

Behind them, the curious citizens of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire numbered in the tens of millions.

They were discussing in shock, who was the intruder that made the Empress personally come over!

Everyone was looking at the Empress at the front.

“Reporting to the empress, according to the information from Willow City, with the speed of the intruder, they should arrive in our imperial city in an hour!”

“A minute ago, there was a message. The Spirit Heart City along the way was destroyed, and more than half of the millions of people died!”

“According to the information, the hundreds of thousands of troops were divided into three waves of forces!”

One by one, the message reached Feng Luan’s ears again, causing her to tightly clench her arms.

“It seems that the Wuji Empire has also arrived. This time, it’s going to be troublesome!”

Guan Shuqing and the other girls frowned and said solemnly.

“Emperor Feng, the three forces of the vast area are joining forces. It’s a war between the vast area and our flowing sea region!”

“We are no match for them. There’s only one way now, which is to retreat and defend the Dragon Palace!”

Prime Minister Gui suggested to Feng Luan with a frown.

Retreat and defend the Dragon Palace!

A level four Dragon Palace could defend against the attacks of experts below the age of 10,000, and the combat strength of the members of the Dragon Palace could be increased by four times within a range of 1,000 kilometers.

What kind of concept was this? It was easy for one to fight against four people.

Even if all the experts in the vast area descended, the Dragon Palace would not be afraid.

“Retreat and defend the Dragon Palace?”

Feng Luan’s expression changed, and she quickly shook her head, she said embarrassedly, “No, with the viciousness of the experts in the vast area and the hatred of the solipsistic sect, if we retreat and defend the Dragon Palace, they will slaughter the entire Liuhai Region!”

“Sister Feng Luan, we are not their match at all!”

Guan Shuqing and the others’expressions changed slightly when they heard her words.

“They are not my match!”

Feng Luan clenched her fists tightly and gritted her teeth. Her eyes were filled with killing intent.

“No, didn’t you say that once you transform into a fire Phoenix, you will be easily discovered? If you transform today, even if you kill them, your identity will be 100% exposed in the future!”

“After being exposed, with the Phoenix dynasty’s strength, it’ll be very difficult to turn things around!”

Lan qingyue immediately retorted.

“Boom!”

Then, just as Lan Qingyue’s voice sounded out, waves of terrifying aura suddenly charged over.

An invisible aura rushed over from a direction of dozens of kilometers. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“What kind of Aura is this?”

Below, all the soldiers were shocked and couldn’t help but exclaim.

Behind them, the expressions of the tens of millions of people from the Dragon and Phoenix Empire also changed drastically.

The aura of this onslaught caused them to tremble!

“We didn’t even see the enemy’s figure, yet a terrifying aura was transmitted over, this...”
