Chapter 940: 0941. The darkness descended

It was a great harvest. Wang Xian did not expect the bridgeforest business association to be so wealthy.

These spirit stones and resources were merely the interspatial rings of the transcendent level eight and the other experts from the BRIDGEFOREST Business Association.

For a family like theirs, they would definitely have a treasure vault that was specially used to store treasures. The items in the treasure vault should not be less than those in the interspatial rings.

For a family to be able to accumulate so much wealth, the power of the Bridgewood Chamber of Commerce was not simple.

Even if it was placed in the city, it was still a pretty good family.

“What is this thing?”

“The Dragon Assassin organization? This assassin organization seems to be somewhat familiar!”

“I remember this piece of paper. This is the Dragon Assassin Organization of Holy Sea Town. I heard that the Dragon Assassin organization announced not long ago that they would enter Bridgewood town. At that time, I didn’t pay too much attention to it. I didn’t expect that the dragon assassin organization would really come!”

“The roar from the Lin family mansion. Could it be an assassination by the Dragon Assassin Organization?”

A Wild Roar in the middle of the night made everyone look shocked.

Not long after, they suddenly found a red piece of paper in their home.

On the paper was the contact information of the Dragon Assassin organization.

This made everyone look shocked.

Many people didn’t know about the dragon assassin organization, but some people who were well-informed knew about it.

The dragon assassin organization originated from Saint Sea Town. Their appearance intimidated all the powerhouses in Saint Sea Town.

Even a transcendent level 6 powerhouse couldn’t escape the Dragon Assassin’s assassination.

A few days ago, the Dragon Assassin Organization sent a message to all the customers that they would enter bridge forest town.

“If the assassination at the Lin family mansion is really the dragon assassin organization, then it’s too terrifying!”

In the center of the town, in a luxurious living room, a middle-aged man said with a face full of surprise.

“What’s so terrifying? If the assassins in the Lin family mansion are really from the dragon assassin organization, then they are only so-so. Can’t you see that they have already been discovered by the Lin Family?”

“The old master of the Lin family has the strength of a transcendent level 8. He is not an ordinary assassin organization that can assassinate him!”

“That’s right. I think this dragon spike can only assassinate a rank 6 transcendent at most. It is only so-so after entering the Lin Family!”

The other two middle-aged men in the hall shook their heads and said.

“That’s true. The strength of the Lin family is too strong. It is not something that a small assassin organization can assassinate. Even if it is an undercurrent, only the top-notch assassins can assassinate the Lin Family!”

The middle-aged man who had just exclaimed slowly nodded his head.

Some of the powerful families and mercenary groups in Linhai town had all received the red piece of paper with the Dragon Spike. After seeing it, they began to discuss among themselves.

The next morning, Qiao Lin town was obviously much livelier than usual.

The Sky had just brightened when the center of the town became lively.

“Look at the gate of the Lin family mansion, that huge red piece of paper!”

“Hiss, it’s the dragon spike. The Dragon Assassin Organization of Holy Sea town has set their target on the Lin Family!”

“Could it be that the dragon assassin organization really went to the Lin family to carry out an assassination last night? I have to say, this dragon Spike is really awesome. It immediately assassinated a powerhouse of the Lin Family!”

“But it seems like he didn’t succeed. He was discovered!”

In the early morning, many people came to the Lin family to understand the situation. When they saw the Congratulatory Death Note on the door, everyone had shocked expressions on their faces.

The crowd started to discuss.

Wang Xian also got up early. He found someone to ask about a shop and followed him to a small shop in a remote area.

“Young man, do you want to buy funerary items?”

The person who was doing business was an old lady. She was very thin and frail. When she saw Wang Xian coming in, she asked with a smile on her face.

“Yes, the enemy is dead. Send some funerary items to celebrate. Oh right, old lady, bring more funerary items that you want to make!”

“Also, can you write some words on it?”

Wang Xian said to the old lady with a smile on his face.

“HMM?”

The old lady was slightly taken aback. She nodded and said, “Yes, I can write anything. There are some good ones in the shop. You can choose from them!”

“This, HMM, this. I want all of them. If you want to write some words, it means congratulations to old master Lin of the Lin family for going to hell. The President of the QIAOLIN Commercial Association is going to hell!”

Wang Xian said with a smile.

“Qiaolin... the President of the QIAOLIN Business Association is Dead?”

The old lady was slightly shocked. Her arms were trembling as she asked.

“Yes, he’s dead. He was assassinated!”

Wang Xian looked at the old lady and nodded his head.

“He died well. He died well. I knew it. Selling the grain at such a high price will bring about retribution. He died well. He really died well!”

The old lady said excitedly. She took out the black ink and said with a red face.

Wang Xian was slightly stunned. He looked at the shabby house. There was a small bed, a shabby table, and a piece of leftover hard steamed bun on the table!

“Looks like the Lin family deserves to die!”

Wang Xian said plainly.

“Damn it, damn it. They monopolize the food in Qiao Lin Town. It’s twice as expensive as the food sold in other towns. I’ll give you the blood steamed bun that they sell. Young Man, I’ll give you the burial items. There’s no need for money, no need for money!”

The old lady said with a smile.

Wang Xian looked at the frail old lady. Her handwriting was very beautiful.

He placed them into his interspatial ring one by one.

“Go, young man. Give it to them. Hehe!”

The old lady waved her hand at Wang Xian with a smile.

Wang Xian nodded his head and moved his palm slightly.

“The heavens have really opened their eyes. Good Death, Good Death!”

The old lady said with tears in her eyes. She turned her head around happily. Suddenly, she was stunned and looked at the spiritual stones on the table in astonishment.

A pile of spiritual stones. Although they were only low-grade spiritual stones, there were at least hundreds of thousands of them.

“Such a good person, such a good person!”

The old lady hurriedly walked out of the room and realized that Wang Xian had already disappeared.

“Hundreds of thousands of low-grade spiritual stones are enough to survive for the rest of my life!”

Wang Xian smiled and slowly walked towards the Lin family’s residence.

When he arrived, he realized that there were many people gathered on the streets. Everyone was paying attention to the Lin family’s matters.

The Roar last night shocked many people.

Coupled with the incident with the dragon assassin organization, everyone was filled with doubts.

“Scram, scram, scram! Don’t block the entrance of the Lin family’s residence. Are you courting death? !”

At this moment, a few guards from the Lin family’s mansion opened the door. When they saw the crowd around them, they shouted sternly with pale faces.

The people around them quickly left. After all, this was the Lin family’s mansion. The Lin family was not someone they could afford to offend.

“Who put the red paper on our door? D * mn it!”

When the few guards saw the red paper on the door, their faces turned gloomy as they roared.

“That’s the dragon spike. Congratulations on your death!”

At this moment, Wang Xian’s voice rang out. He walked over with a smile on his face. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Following that, under the shocked gazes of everyone around him, he placed the funerary items in his interspatial ring on the wall of the Lin family.

Wreaths, wreaths.

On the funerary items and wreaths, there were even messages written on them.

Congratulates Lin Jia Lin Old to go to hell!

Congratulates Bridgewood Chamber of Commerce President to go to Hell!
