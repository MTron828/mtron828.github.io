Chapter 980: 0981 returned and set off

Translator: 549690339

Many people in the demon hunters academy were discussing the grudge between Wang Xian and the young master’s mercenary group and the amethyst mercenary group.

Especially the matter between Wang Xian and the young master’s mercenary group.

Many people had already felt that based on Wang Xian’s previous actions, the young master’s mercenary group would only stop after he died.

The grudge between them had already reached a very deep level.

Wang Xian didn’t know what happened in the Academy’s Forum. If he knew, not only would he not be angry, he would even be looking forward to it.

It was more interesting to fight in the wild.

If they attacked him in the wild, he would be able to obtain a lot of things.

At the very least, the people he killed could become resources for the Dragon Pool.

Wang Xian was very welcoming of their revenge.

For the next day, Wang Xian spent the entire day in the library reading up on various information.

“Dragon King, we’re back!”

Two days later, when Wang Xian had just opened his eyes, Ao Yao’s voice came from outside.

Wang Xian smiled. “Call Ao Jian and the rest over.”

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Soon, Ao Yao, Ao Jian, and the rest arrived at the courtyard.

“Dragon King, these are all the spiritual stones obtained from the three assassinations. A total of 89 million middle-grade spiritual stones!”

Ao Yao handed over the two interspatial rings.

Wang Xian took them and looked at the spiritual stones inside. A smile appeared on his face. “Not bad!”

89 million spiritual stones, together with the spiritual stones in his hands, amounted to more than 106 million.

If he were to buy elixirs and exchange them for spirit stones, it would be equivalent to 70,000 to 80,000 dragon crystals.

However, it was still very far away from upgrading to 1,000,000 dragon crystals.

“Bring the badge of the Celestial Phoenix mercenary group and Follow Me!”

Wang Xian said to them directly.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

The group of members of the Dragon Palace nodded immediately and followed Wang Xian out of the city.

When Wang Xian walked out of the courtyard, he sensed a gaze.

Wang Xian swept his gaze across and looked at the thin and weak young man. A hint of mockery appeared at the corner of his mouth.

This thin and weak young man had been following him for a few days. He knew who had sent him here.

On the road, Wang Xian and the rest got off the horse carriage and rushed out of the city.

Donghai city was very big. It would take half an hour to walk out of the city. The speed of the horse carriage was much faster.

Beside the carriage, there were many people riding on ferocious beasts.

All kinds of ferocious beasts were traveling at a speed that was no slower than the carriage.

“Should I get a mount in the future?”

Wang Xian thought to himself. After about ten minutes, the carriage arrived at the entrance of the city.

In front of them, there was an endless wasteland.

Within a radius of ten kilometers outside the city, there were no ferocious beasts. Only in the ocean would there be ferocious beasts.

In the area outside the city, there were many mercenary groups and chambers of commerce coming in and out. It was unusually lively.

After passing through the city wall, it was a completely different world.

Inside the city, it was like a bustling city.

Outside the city, it was like the end of the world.

This was the supernatural world.

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian did not hesitate at all. With a move of his body, he immediately flew towards the location of the ocean.

In the sky, there were at least a few thousand supernatural experts flying.

Wang Xian increased his speed and flew towards the thunderstorm area.

The thunderstorm area was 80 kilometers away from Donghai city. It would take more than an hour to fly there.

Due to the radiation from Donghai city, there were not many flying ferocious beasts within a radius of tens of kilometers.

Even if there were flying ferocious beasts, they would avoid them after seeing Wang Xian and the rest.

“The thunderstorm area is ahead. Lower the altitude!”

Wang Xian looked ahead. There were dark clouds in front of him and heavy rain was pouring down at some locations.

From time to time, lightning would pierce through the dark clouds as though it was tearing apart space.

The entire area was so vast that one could not see the end of it. The dark clouds made the ocean that was tens of thousands of meters deep look extremely deep as though it was an abyss.

The sea and the sky were the same color, and it was extremely depressing.

There were obviously fewer people flying around. As they walked deeper, they could see huge creatures emerging from the surface of the water from time to time.

Most of these aquatic creatures were at transcendent level four and five.

In the ocean, these creatures were very difficult to deal with. Even if they were water elemental cultivators, it would take a lot of time to kill them.

Wang Xian looked down with a strange look in his eyes.

“There aren’t many ferocious beasts!” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

He thought to himself as he looked into the distance. More than ten kilometers away, there was an incomparably huge island standing in the middle of the ocean.

The tallest mountain on the island was pierced through the black clouds.

The strangest thing was that there were dense bolts of lightning around the island.

According to the information Wang Xian got from the information, it was because there was a metal on the island that could attract lightning.

The entire island was huge and there was a type of lightning tree on it.

In the past, no one dared to enter this island. The occasional lightning could cause the death of an extraordinary level five or six powerhouse.

Only those who were not afraid of death and were short of money dared to enter to search for the lightning fruit.

The higher-ups of the Demon Hunters Academy received the news that the lightning here was much weaker than before. Hence, they gave out this mission.

“Eh? Why are there still so many people there!”

As they approached the Thunder Island, Wang Xian saw that there were more than a hundred people gathered at the edge of the island.

“They are the students of the Demon Hunters Academy!”

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly. “Let’s go, Let’s Go!”

He moved his body and sped up towards the Thunder Island.

“Haha, Five Extraordinary Level Six thunderfish. Our Luck is really good!”

“It took us two hours to exhaust them to death. It’s really not easy!”

Wang Xian had just flown over when he saw the corpses of the five ferocious beasts on the ground.

They had four legs but their bodies were similar to fish.

The scales on their bodies were like lightning.

At this moment, the five Thunderfish had already been killed and were lying on the ground.

“Everyone, distribute the meritorious service according to the Merit!”

A burly girl said to everyone around her.

“It’s deputy leader Xiao!”

“We didn’t manage to find the Thunder fruit, but we managed to kill five thunderfish together. It’s also a great harvest!”

“Haha, it’s Our Good Luck!”

As the group spoke, they began to distribute the loot.

“Someone is here!”

“It’s him, the new Wang Xian!”

“Eh? A gold-level mercenary group, the Immortal Phoenix Mercenary Group?”

When the people on the Thunder Island saw Wang Xian, the atmosphere changed instantly. When they saw them, all of them had shocked expressions on their faces.

This new Wang Xian was actually the leader of a gold-level mercenary group?

Everyone looked at the girls from the amethyst mercenary group.

At this moment, everyone from the amethyst mercenary group also saw Wang Xian.

Qin Qing stared at Wang Xian and frowned slightly.

“HMPH, so it’s an arrogant brat like you who is here. It’s great that I can teach you a good lesson in the wilderness this time!”

A girl from the amethyst mercenary group raised her head slightly and flexed her wrist. She sized up Wang Xian and the rest.

Wang Xian’s gaze swept across them. There were seven to eight mercenary groups in total. Among them, the amethyst mercenary group was the strongest!
