2666 2666 Dragon Palace was the father

The humans in this area were all stunned!

They looked at the terrifying energy that was surging toward them and felt a sense of despair.

Some people even closed their eyes and trembled.

“Roar!”

A roar filled with pressure sounded at this moment.

Inside the Dragon Palace, ao Fenghuang’s body was surrounded by flames and lightning. He raised his head and let out a wild roar, and his entire person changed greatly.

Dragon body, Phoenix Wings.

Boom

The Phoenix Wings flapped, and two flaming Phoenix Wings rushed forward. The Phoenix Wings grew larger and larger.

In the end, the two wings covered an area of hundreds of millions of kilometers.

“Double Dragon Association!”

Mou Zesen shouted softly, and two arrows instantly condensed on the bow in his hand.

One was green, and the other was golden.

The two arrows shot out and instantly turned into two divine dragons that intersected. Each of them was a million kilometers in size, and directly tore apart the terrifying energy in front of them.

“Hualala!”

Ao Xingmu stood in front of a cave entrance. He waved the vines on his body and countless leaves flew straight into the void in front of him.

He welcomed the attack of the tens of millions of abyssal seeds.

“Yin and yang Poles.”

Wang Xian stood on the command platform and waved his hands slightly. A Taiji appeared in front of him and pushed it forward gently.

“Buzz!”

The Tai Chi became bigger and covered the sky. It blocked the front of the Dragon Peak.

Boom! Boom! Boom

When the Tai Chi swept across the sky, the attacks of tens of millions of abyssal seeds had already collided with Ao Fenghuang and Ao Xingmu’s attacks.

The terrifying energy was like a meat grinder. At this moment, even an immortal king level 9 powerhouse would be wiped out instantly.

The sounds of explosions rang out incessantly, an apocalyptic scene appeared in front of them!

“Rumble Rumble Rumble!”

All the attacks finally stopped in front of Tai Chi.

Behind, everyone who saw this scene opened their mouths slightly.

Shock!

“Kill!”

All the energy slowly dissipated, the first round of collision had ended.

And at this time, the distance between Dragon Mountain and the tens of millions of Abyss races was only 10 million km.

This distance was already very close!

An earth shattering roar came from the heavenly eye arrow members, dense arrows shot forward.

“Sou Sou Sou!”

“Howl Howl Howl!”

The three brambles formed a monster, locking onto the two undying level 9 abyss races and instantly flying over.

Within Dragon Mountain, Ao Feng Huang and Ao Xing Mu also moved, flying over too!

“Mu Ze Sen, kill the undying level 8 seed, leave the two to them!”

Tian Cheng said indifferently.

“Alright!”

Mu Ze Sen nodded, ignoring the 2 undying level 9 seeds, his sharp gaze fixed on an undying level 8 seed.

“Sou.”

The Arrows flew out.

“Sou Sou Sou!”

In the next moment, another 10 arrows shot towards the undying level 8 seed.

A Level 9 killing a level 8, especially an archer like Mu Ze Sen, easily took his life.

One level 8, in less than 10 seconds, killed!

Following which, Mu Ze Sen continued to kill the other level 8.

“Howl!”

“Ga Ga!”

The two level 9 Abyssal Beasts in the lead roared madly when they saw the brambles charging towards them.

“Sou Sou Sou!”

...

However in the next moment, the three brambles surrounded them in a triangular formation.

“Hahaha, kill them!”

From the rear, Ao Fenghuang and Ao Xingmu flew over. A black and white shadow flashed and entered the encirclement as well.

Six against two. There were also thorny monsters of the same level that could be killed independently.

“Boom Boom Boom!”

The moment Ao fenghuang and Ao Xingmu entered the encirclement, they launched an incomparably violent attack.

The three thorny monsters followed closely behind. In an instant, they opened up a battlefield with a radius of over a hundred million kilometers.

In the surroundings, all the abyssal seeds hurriedly dodged to the side to avoid being affected.

“Fire Hammer clan’s Divine Weapon Attack!”

“Starwood Dragon Seeds, all go out and Hunt!”

“Strange Demon, all go out and Hunt!”

...

Within Dragon Peak, the sky array gave out orders one after another.

There were more than 15,000 abyss species. Just relying on the sky eye arrow to kill them would take too long.

“Yes!”

The Starwood Dragon species and all the strange demons immediately charged into the battlefield.

There were 23,000 immortal king level powerhouses in the entire Dragon Peak. With such strength, they were much more powerful than the abyss species.

“Five Elements Millstone!”

Wang Xian moved his arm and the Five Elements Millstone appeared in front of him. He waved his arm.

An incomparably huge millstone appeared in the void of the abyss. It immediately turned into a radius of over ten million kilometers.

The entire five elements millstone contained the power of the law of destruction. It seemed to be able to destroy everything in the world.

The five elements millstone rushed over and enveloped hundreds of thousands of abyss seeds. With a sweep of the Gray Energy, all the abyss seeds died instantly.

No one below immortal king level 8 could withstand half a second of the five elements Millstone’s destructive energy.

Tens of millions of abyss species seemed like a lot, however in just one encounter, the Dragon Palace had killed 3 to 4 million of them.

“Hiss, this... this... The Dragon Palace managed to withstand it!”

“Not only did they withstand it, the dragon palace is simply slaughtering them wantonly. Look at the 2 undying level 9 abyss species, they are completely trapped, the Dragon Palace also has an undying level 9 warrior!”

“Too strong, too strong, is this the power of the Dragon Palace?”

Behind, all the Warriors and disciples in the area were completely in despair, but seeing this scene, they all stared wide eyed with excitement.

“Father, father, are we... Are We Saved?” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The youth with a face full of despair looked at the slaughter ahead, clenching his fists, he shouted excitedly at his father beside him.

“F * ck, this is too strong! Don’t call me father! The Dragon Palace is the Father!”

The middle-aged man who had survived the disaster responded loudly.

The young man on the side slowly cracked a smile.

The Dragon Palace could do what his father couldn’t.

“Indeed, the Dragon Palace is the father! This is too strong!”!

He murmured.

“This is more than father! This is the father! Without the Dragon Palace, we are all doomed!”

Some people beside heard and couldn’t help but shout excitedly.

Even some of the Warriors and disciples from last month’s great sect were filled with shock.

The power of the Dragon Palace was truly unbelievable.

Howl

At this time, an incomparably shrill voice sounded from the side. Everyone’s faces were filled with shock as they immediately looked towards the undying god King Level 9 battlefield.

Unfortunately, due to the various energy barriers, they couldn’t see the situation clearly.

However, they knew that the scream just now came from an undying level 9 abyssal seed.

The battle and Slaughter continued, every second, over 100,000 or even 100,000 abyssal seeds were killed.

The people behind realized that this battle didn’t require them to do anything.

They only needed to watch from here.
