3404 3403 took out the innate spiritual treasure

“The powerhouses of the godly tiger race have attracted the powerhouses of the Godly Tiger Race!”

“Hiss, the temptation of the innate spiritual treasure is really great. Even the powerhouses of the godly tiger race are attracted here!”

“After all, it is an innate spiritual treasure. It would be a treasure even if it was placed in the top races!”

When the powerhouses of the godly tiger race arrived, everyone around immediately looked over. Their eyes were filled with reverence.

The Divine Tiger clan was one of the top existences in the universe.

Wang Xian heard the sounds around him and looked over. His eyes sparkled.

In his line of sight, more than ten figures in the form of Divine Tigers flew over. Lightning flashed on their bodies. They were not burly but rather slender.

They looked more like large cats!

On their foreheads, there was the word “Wang”. Their fur was long and they looked like cute and beautiful pets.

However, no one in the universe could underestimate them.

Speed-type godly tigers!

They were definitely royalty.

“A universe knight with level eight combat strength and a universe knight with level nine combat strength!”

Wang Xian looked at the dozen of them and thought to himself. He was slightly disappointed.

There were no experts from the Godly Tigers coming over.

Boom

More than ten Godly Tigers flew over and transformed into human forms.

At the front of the stall, the experts immediately made way.

There were more than ten divine tigers, both male and female. They were all middle-aged.

Even among the peak races, those who could reach the level of a universe knight, level eight or level nine, were not too young.

The strength and potential that Wang Xian had displayed in the Thunder Ray race was considered to be at the peak among the peak races.

It was already not bad for a race to have one or two.

“It is indeed an innate spiritual treasure!”

They were also extremely envious of such a treasure.

“How many divine stones are we selling this innate spiritual treasure for?”

A middle-aged man from the Divine Tiger Race asked.

“This is an offensive innate spiritual treasure. It’s the normal price of an innate spiritual treasure!”

Wang Xian heard them asking about the price and said faintly.

Wang Xian had already understood the price of an innate spiritual treasure. This time, he did not seek to sell it at a high price. He only wanted to sell it at the price of an ordinary innate spiritual treasure.

This price was enough for him to achieve a breakthrough in his strength.

“Brother Yin, even if all of us pooled our money together, we wouldn’t be able to afford it.”

Upon hearing Wang Xian’s words, a middle-aged man from the Divine Tiger clan shook his head.

The middle-aged man who was called brother Yin frowned slightly.

“This stall owner, you should be a thunder attribute cultivator, right? I can invite you to enter Roaring Tiger Cliff to cultivate for 10,000 years. Can you sell this innate spiritual treasure cheaply?”

The middle-aged man from the Godly Tiger clan asked.

“Roaring Tiger Cliff? It’s a cultivation treasure land for the Godly Tiger clan. This is a paradise for the members of the Godly Tiger clan to cultivate in!”

“Hiss, 10,000 years of cultivation time for Roaring Tiger Cliff? This…”

All the strong disciples around were slightly shocked when they heard the words of the middle-aged man from the Godly Tiger clan.

“No, I only want to exchange for resources!”

Wang Xian shook his head. The Aura on his body was slightly released.

Buzz

“Huh?”

Sensing the aura that Wang Xian suddenly released, the members of the Divine Tiger clan were slightly shocked. Their faces were filled with astonishment. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“A powerhouse at the peak of the Universe Knight Level!”

Some of the surrounding powerhouses also sensed it instantly. Their hearts were filled with awe.

A powerhouse at the peak of the Universe Knight level. With such strength, he would be a pillar of support among the high-level races in the universe.

No wonder he was able to obtain an innate spiritual treasure.

“Forget it then!”

The middle-aged man from the Godly Tiger clan shook his head in disappointment. He looked at his companions and said, “I can’t afford it. I’ll inform some of the elders and those who have the resources to see if they will buy it!”

“Okay!”

The powerhouse from the Godly Tiger clan nodded his head.

The dozen or so members of the Godly Tiger clan did not stay for long. After a brief look, they left immediately.

When Wang Xian saw them leaving, he let down his guard a little.

He was really afraid that the experts of the Divine Tiger clan would be prepared to buy and sell by force.

If that was the case, he could only change to another place.

Time passed day by day. Half a month passed by in the blink of an eye.

Wang Xian was not in a hurry. He sat there quietly and waited.

The news of him setting up a stall here to sell innate spiritual treasures had basically reached the ears of the experts from the major forces.

From the words of the powerhouses from the various races and factions around him, he also learned that some powerhouses were coming over.

Whoosh

At this moment, Wang Xian sensed a figure with a powerful aura flying over.

He narrowed his eyes slightly and raised his head to look ahead.

An old man who was purple in color and had a pair of purple tentacles landed in front of him.

Wang Xian could feel an energy that made his heart palpitate from his body.

It was stronger than him!

The old man took a look at Wang Xian and his gaze landed on the innate lightning bell. He did not bother to hide his excitement.

“I want this innate Numinous Treasure!”

The old man said.

“Sell it if the price is right!”

Wang Xian said faintly.

“Alright!”

The old man nodded. With a move of his palm, an interspatial ring appeared in his hand.

“This innate spiritual treasure, I want it too!”

At this moment, a sudden voice was heard, causing the old man to be slightly stunned.

Some of the surrounding strong disciples were looking at the old man in astonishment. This sudden voice also caused them to be extremely stunned.

“Ring, Ring, Ring!”

The sound of walking was heard along with the sound of the ringing of the bell.

Wang Xian looked over and was slightly stunned. Then, his gaze landed on the figure.

It was a girl. She was barefooted and had a bell tied to her feet.

The sound of walking could be heard.

There was a purple word ‘king’on the forehead of the girl. Her purple pupils had a pair of exceptionally eye-catching tiger teeth.

There were three purple lines on her two small faces. She looked like a character from an anime.

Behind the girl, there were more than ten middle-aged youths and even two old men.

“Huh?”

“This girl is…”

The surrounding people looked at this girl with surprise in their eyes. Their expressions changed slightly.

The word “Wang”on her forehead should be a disciple of the Divine Tiger clan.

Wang Xian looked at the girl and his gaze landed on the bell on her ankle once again.

This was an innate spiritual treasure. Although it didn’t erupt with power, he could sense it.

The purple-skinned old man’s expression changed slightly when he saw the group of girls.

“Miss, Let’s get it for the highest bidder!”

He opened his mouth and said to the girl.

“HMM, no problem. The innate spiritual treasure belongs to whoever has the highest price. Give me your highest price first. I’m a little higher than you anyway.”

The girl looked at the old man and said with a chuckle.

The old man was stunned. He pursed his lips and shook his head. Then, he took out three acquired Supreme Treasures and handed the space ring in his hand to the girl.

“These treasures, together with the three acquired Supreme Treasures in my hand, are my highest price. If this girl has a higher price than me, then this innate numinous treasure belongs to you!”
