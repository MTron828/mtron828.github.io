“This is the 34th one, right? HMPH!”

In the sky above the six paths universe, a figure stood majestically in the sky.

Around him were tens of thousands of crow-like creatures.

These crows had pale white pupils and their bodies contained a special aura.

He looked in the direction where Wang Xian and Lin Niu had left. His eyes were filled with a cold expression.

“You Want to covet the Ultimate Treasure of our six paths universe? Are you

looking down on our six paths universe? Hehe, I’d like to see what kind of

waves you guys can create!”

He sneered and his body slowly dissipated, turning into decay.

The crows around him also disappeared quickly as if they had been cremated.

“Boss, we should have been discovered by now since we arrived.”

Wang Xian and Lin Niu flew into the distance quickly.

Lin Niu looked behind him and said.

“HMM, this is the six paths universe after all. The Heaven’s origin powerhouses here must have made some preparations. It’s easy for us to be discovered in their territory. However, they didn’t seem to chase after us. ” Wang Xian nodded his head.

“There should be many Heaven’s origin powerhouses in this universe. ”

Lin Niu pondered for a moment and said.

Wang Xian also understood.

The universe was located in a chaotic space. Some Heaven’s origin powerhouses roamed around the chaotic space in search of treasures.

Over time, they would also encounter other Heaven’s origin powerhouses from other universes.

When the two of them met, they might carry out transactions.

This might make many heavenly creation masters stay in contact, making it easy to trade.

There should be a trade area somewhere in the chaos space.

And the news of the six paths universe having heavenly creation true treasures should have been spread in this area.

The number of heavenly creation masters who came to the six paths universe was definitely not less than a few dozen.

After all, there were eight to nine of them in the nine origin universe.

The number of powerhouses in other universes would not be less either.

It was a terrifying thing for dozens of heaven origin creation level powerhouses to enter a universe.

“Let’s see if we can find the city or country where this space civilization is located. ”

Wang Xian spoke and flew in a direction with even more caution.

They were now looking for the city of this space civilization to obtain some information.

Otherwise, it would be like looking for a needle in a haystack if they were to fly aimlessly in search of the ultimate treasure of the Heaven’s origin.

“Boss, there seems to be a city ahead! ”

After the next 500 years, Lin Niu’s single eye looked ahead and suddenly spoke.

After the Unicorn Bull’s single eye was opened, its vision was much better than Wang Xian’s.

Every strong person in the Heaven’s origin realm had their own unique and powerful abilities!

“As long as we can find the living beings of this space civilization, we will be able to know the situation of this universe!”

Wang Xian looked in the direction the Unicorn Bull was pointing at and sped up a little.Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

This universe had the five elements attributes, so it must have the living beings that cultivated the five elements attributes.

This kind of living creature should be different from the one they encountered not long ago.

It should be a normal living creature.

When they continued flying forward, a city filled with vitality appeared in Wang Xian’s line of sight.

This was a city covered in flames. In the city, there were many humans!

There were also some other humanoid living creatures.

For example, the fire men, lava giants, and the like.

“The creatures in this city are all weaklings. Simulate the creatures here. Let’s

As Wang Xian spoke, he came directly to the sky above the city.

His entire body was emitting flames. His appearance was exactly the same as the creatures here.

He entered the city silently.

Buzz Buzz

Wang Xian swept his gaze across the surroundings. With a thought, he activated his soul absorbing power.

In an instant, waves of information were transmitted into his mind.

Wang Xian’s soul-absorbing power could be used to deal with these weak creatures without making a sound.

Furthermore, it would not hurt these creatures!

Waves of information were transmitted into his mind, causing his eyes to flicker slightly.

“Fire field, water field, earth field, grassland, the Ajin mountain range, the basin of the dead.”

Wang Xian read through the information one by one as he mumbled.

These six places were the most important information that Wang Xian had obtained.

And these six places were also the core of these six universes.

Fire Field was a land of fire attribute.

Water Field was a land of water attribute.

As for the last undead basin, it was a land of the undead attribute of the six universes.

The sixth attribute of this universe was known as the undead attribute.

The undead were completely different from skeletons.

The undead were truly dead creatures that were then summoned.

After being summoned, they possessed intelligence, but they didn’t have any life force. Instead, they relied on the energy of the undead attribute to survive.

The undead didn’t know fatigue or pain.

Whatever power they possessed before they died, after being summoned, they would possess the same power.

This was a very special energy.

“What’s the situation with the eyeball creatures when they are summoned and resurrected? How do the powerful undead use the energy of the undead?”

The creatures in this city were too weak, so they didn’t know much information.

Wang Xian could only make some guesses.

In addition, under normal circumstances, the ultimate treasures of the Heaven’s origin would be born in places with rich energy.

The possibility of the ultimate treasures of the Heaven’s origin being born in the six treasured lands in the six paths universe was the highest.

Wang Xian was deep in thought.

“Linniu, let’s go. We’ll continue to head towards the center.”

Wang Xian said to Linniu. They acted as the creatures of this universe and headed towards the center.

Their bodies were covered in flames. After flying for a few years, they arrived at another city.

In this city, Wang Xian obtained some more information.

For example, the other situations in this universe.

The powers of the six paths universe were divided by tribes!

The powerful tribes were all located in those six places.

In the six paths universe, there were three top-tier tribes. Countless strong beings served these three top-tier tribes.

And these three top-tier tribes were tribes that had powerhouses in the Heaven’s origin realm!

As they continued to go deeper, Wang Xian obtained more and more information as time went by.

And the way they acted as the creatures in this universe became more and more real.

Under the circumstance where they could not sense their strength, even the strong Tianyuan creator could not distinguish Wang Xian and the rest.

As time went by, Wang Xian and the rest were getting closer and closer to the center of the six paths universe.

They were also getting closer and closer to the six treasured lands.

The tribes and cities they encountered were also getting bigger and bigger.

The entire universe was rather peaceful. Only occasionally could they see the great battles between tribes.

The overall strength of the creatures in this universe was much weaker than that of the nine-origin universe.

The number of masters in the universe was much less than that of the sword and magic universes.

However, their overall strength was a little stronger than that of the sword and magic universes!
