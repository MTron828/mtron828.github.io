Chapter 1136: 1137 was the cub of the Void Interpretation Demonic Beast

Translator: 5496903

“Crack Crack Crack!”

“Roar Roar Roar!”

The entire hundred Beast City, along with the roars of the two golden lions, underwent a terrifying transformation.

All the nests and ferocious beasts were directly awakened.

One nest after another trembled slightly, and the array formation shattered like a mirror.

This scene caused all the martial artists in the Hundred Beast City to be stunned.

Especially those who were preparing to break the array formation. When they saw that the array formation was broken and the roars of fierce beasts came from inside, their faces showed fear.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

At this moment, the entire hundred Beast City suddenly emitted a terrifying roar. One fierce beast after another rushed out of their lairs with blood-red eyes. They looked at the surrounding humans and pounced on them as if they were bloodthirsty.

“Not good, all the arrays have been broken. All the ferocious beasts have come out!”

“Oh my God, run, run!”

In an instant, the faces of everyone in the surroundings were filled with terror.

There were over ten thousand ferocious beast lairs in the entire hundred Beast City. In each of the lairs, the weakest ferocious beast was at the seventh rank of the extraordinary realm. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

And in this group of them, in the span of half an hour, they had only opened over a thousand lairs.

There were still many lairs that they had yet to open.

However, when all the ferocious beasts in the lairs came out, it was no less than a huge disaster for them.

Everyone had a look of fear on their faces. Without any hesitation, they fled into the distance.

Wang Xian, who was close to the central area, was also slightly stunned. He raised his eyebrows slightly when he saw the ferocious beasts that were emitting a terrifying aura coming out of the lairs.

Around him, the weakest among the huge nests was at level eight of the supernatural realm. The strong ones were able to reach half-step void interpretation realm.

“However, this is also a good opportunity to fish in troubled waters!”

A faint smile appeared on Wang Xian’s face. He quickly scanned his surroundings.

This was because at this moment, there was no need for him to use his light and dark fire dragon eyes to check. There must be pet eggs before he could rush out of the nest of the ferocious beasts.

“All deviant demons, make your move!”

Since the void interpretation experts in the sky were restricted, Wang Xian did not hesitate to let the deviant demons and the rest make their move.

Under this chaotic environment, the forty deviant demons were like fish in the water.

Wang Xian looked at a sealed lair and rushed towards it.

Buzz

The spell-free divine ability allowed him to enter directly. When he saw the two-meter-sized pet egg, he revealed an excited expression.

Half-step void interpretation!

The half-step void interpretation pet egg that Feng Luan had auctioned previously was worth billions of middle-grade spirit stones.

After keeping it in his spirit pouch, Wang Xian immediately rushed out.

“Who is it?”

However, the moment Wang Xian came out, a cold voice was heard. A few pairs of eyes were staring at him.

Wang Xian looked over and raised his eyebrows slightly. He immediately rushed to another place.

“This guy?”

The third prince, who was dressed in a yellow robe, frowned as he stared at Wang Xian’s figure. His eyes flickered as he looked at the formation behind him that was still unbroken.

“That mysterious person’s strength is not weaker than a transcendent level nine. He should have some special treasures on him that can enter the lair directly!”

An elder beside him said to Wang Xian in a deep voice.

“HMM, pay attention to that kid. We should take this opportunity to look for the pet egg!”

The third prince nodded.

The surrounding ferocious beasts did not pose much of a threat to them.

The strength beside him was sufficient to deal with these ferocious beasts.

Boom! Boom

The two old men beside him waved their arms. Their attacks landed on the ferocious beasts that were attacking him and killed them immediately.

Their target was also the surrounding ferocious beasts that didn’t charge out of their nests.

Many people around them had noticed this. However, with their strength, they couldn’t escape in time when facing the thousands of top-notch ferocious beasts around them.

Compared to the rest, the strange demons entered the nests one by one and easily took out the pet eggs and handed them to Wang Xian.

Wang Xian revealed a big smile.

“Take them for me. I’m going in!”

At this moment, Feng Luan’s voice rang in his ears. Following that, he saw six pet eggs being thrown in front of him.

Four of them were at transcendent level seven, one of them was at transcendent level eight, and one of them was at transcendent level nine.

Wang Xian quickly looked over and saw Feng Luan flying directly towards the central hall.

“TSK tsk, Feng Luan, this is the real fish in troubled waters!”

Wang Xian chuckled and placed the pet egg into his storage spirit bag. Then, he looked towards the front once again.

At the back, all the nests had been searched by the strange demon and the rest. Only the dozens of nests at the front had not been checked.

Wang Xian moved his body and flew directly towards the location closest to the central hall.

“There’s one!”

When Wang Xian saw the dozens of nests at the front, he was pleasantly surprised. He moved his body and flew over.

“Get lost!”

At this moment, a cold shout came from behind. Wang Xian swept his gaze across and frowned slightly.

However, he ignored it and flew straight towards the nest.

Crack! Crack

However, just as Wang Xian flew to the front of the nest, the formation of the nest in front of him suddenly broke apart.

He frowned slightly and a demonic glow flashed in his eyes.

Just as Wang Xian was about to check out what kind of ferocious beast was inside, a small head popped out.

It was only the size of a fist. One of its blue and one of its red eyes looked at Wang Xian curiously.

“Meow!”

It opened its mouth and meowed. Its body twisted slightly as it emerged from the formation.

It had a red and blue glow and looked extremely exquisite. What was even stranger was that it had two tails.

The red tail and the blue tail looked very cute.

“Ice fire civet cat, it’s an ice fire civet cat!”

Suddenly, an excited voice sounded from behind. Wang Xian sensed a pair of fiery eyes looking in his direction.

“Ice fire civet cat, a rare demonic beast cub, a rare dual-attribute demonic beast. The exact strength of its bloodline is unknown. However, the strongest ice fire civet cat has reached the terrifying fifth level of the void interpretation realm. I must get it, I must get it!”

A low roar of intense desire was heard.

However, at this moment, Wang Xian’s body started to move. Without any hesitation, he directly grabbed at the ice fire civet cat.

“Meow!”

When the ice fire civet cat saw Wang Xian pouncing towards it, it actually pounced towards him.

Wang Xian was slightly delighted. A smile appeared on his face as he grabbed the ice fire civet cat and flew into the distance.

“Stop right there. Hand it over to me. Quick, hand it over to me!”

From behind, the third prince was flustered and exasperated as he roared with all his might.

“Chase after him! You must catch up to him! You must get the ice fire civet cat!”

The third prince shouted at Wang Xian with bloodshot eyes.

He must get the fire and ice civet cat cub. Once he got it, the throne of star-moon kingdom would be his in the future!
