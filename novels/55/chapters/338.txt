Chapter 339: I Know How to Refine Elixir Pills Too!

“Brat, tell me how to recover Guang Hua’s arm. I can forget about everything in the past!”

Just as Wang Xian was studying the four mutations, an icy-cold voice was heard.

Without looking up, Wang Xian knew it was the elder from Sacred Followers Guild who had been eyeing him the moment he entered.

“Since he lost the bet, he has to bear the consequences. What now? I crippled the young one, and an old one is here to seek revenge?”

Wang Xian spun around slowly as he looked at the Sacred Followers Guild Elder ridiculously.

“Heh, I’m just going to ask you once. Are you telling me or not?” the elder from Sacred Followers Guild asked Wang Xian emotionlessly.

“500 Spiritual Stones, and I’ll treat your disciple’s arm. Otherwise, forget it!”

Wang Xian stared at him with a smile.

“Fine. I hope you always remain firm like you did now!” Sacred Followers Guild Elder quirked his lips and revealed a cold smile.

Wang Xian turned around and ignored him as he placed his focus once again on those mutated creatures.

He reached out and grabbed a Cadaveric Ant, sensing its internal structure and the blood vessels within it. After doing so, he sank into deep thought.

Based on his speculation, the mutation that occurred on these creatures was not caused by any virus. It was caused by some form of powerful blood.

These creatures had evolved due to the blood and transformed into Level 7 or Level 8 existences.

His deduction surprised him. If a drop of blood could allow ants and mosquitoes to evolve into such a daunting stage, how domineering could that blood be?

What kind of existence is it?

At least, it was much stronger than Wang Xian.

“I must be careful if there’s such a daunting bloodline around!”

Wang Xian was slightly stern as such a formidable existence was not something he could deal with at the moment.

“Young Master Bian, the Spiritual Grasses have arrived.”

After an hour, the middle-aged man walked in and spoke to Bian Yaoquan.

“Oh? That’s pretty fast? How many tufts did you bring for the nine different types of Level 3 Spiritual Grass?”

Bian Yaoquan stood up and asked this with a beaming face.

“We brought 100 tufts per type. How many pills can you refine?” the middle-aged man asked with expectation.

“100 tufts per type?”

Bian Yaoquan was slightly taken aback. Instantly, he answered confidently, “I may be a Level 3 alchemist, but my success rate of refining the pills can hit 20 percent. I can refine about two to three Blood Cleansing Pills at one time. With 100 portions of ingredients, I can refine at least 40 to 50 pills.”

“40 to 50 pills?”

The middle-aged man in uniform was looking surprised.

40 to 50 Level 3 pills were equivalent to 40 to 50 tufts of Level 4 Spiritual Grasses.

The value of 900 tufts of Spiritual Grass had increased by more than ten fold.

Only alchemists could achieve such formidable results.

“Wow, that’s scary. Using those Spiritual Grasses alone, he could obtain 40 to 50 Level 4 Spiritual Medicine. The alchemist is indeed powerful!”

“He’s just too formidable. No wonder Medical Saint Sect did not care about losing out in medical skills, and only wanted their core disciples to practice the Art of Refining Elixir Pills!”

“A formidable alchemist is scary!”

The surrounding crowd exclaimed with shocked faces.

The power of alchemy struck horror in everyone present.

Level 3 pills were extremely useful to a Level 9 Martial Artist. With sufficient Spiritual Grass, an alchemist could quickly enhance the strength of a Level 9 Martial Artist, and even allow them to make a breakthrough to Half-step to Inborn.

Medical Saint Sect was insurmountable due to powerful Art of Refining Elixir Pills.

“The power of Art of Refining Elixir Pills is far from what you can imagine!”

Tints of envy flashed in the Poison Duo’s eyes as they looked at the crowd with a disdainful look.

“Young Master Bian, could you help to refine some pills for us if we prepare enough Spiritual Grass? We will, of course, pay you handsomely!”

An Inborn Expert could not help but say this respectfully to Bian Yaoquan.

Initially, all of them had thought that Bian Yaoquan was just some playful and hedonistic disciple. No one had ever felt that he could be such a talented and powerful Alchemist.

So everyone was shocked.

“We can discuss it next time!”

Upon seeing an Inborn Expert speaking to him with respect, Bian Yaoquan curled his lips slightly and spoke impassively.

“Sure, Young Master Bian. Please carry on with refining these pills.”

“Young Master Bian, can you show us your Art of Refining Elixir Pills?”

Some experts around him were gazing at Bian Yaoquan with faces full of expectations. Even the Miracle Doctors had glistening eyes.

They wanted to witness the amazing art as well.

“I’ll permit you to watch if you keep absolutely silent when I’m refining the pills!” Bian Yaoquan answered proudly.

“Of course. We won’t make a single noise. Just hoping you’ll broaden our horizons,” a Miracle Doctor replied with a beaming face.

Bian Yaoquan nodded with a smile as he gazed at the Spiritual Grass by the side, “Watch closely then!”

Bian Yaoquan was not keeping any secrets at all. Even if he had to refine elixir pills in front of a crowd, they would not be able to learn the art.

Refining pills was harder than becoming a Miracle Doctor.

Moreover, every pill has its own recipe. Without the recipe, one could not possibly refine the pill.

Bian Yaoquan flung his arm and grabbed tufts of Spiritual Grass.

He spread out his left hand, and a greenish flame appeared before him.

The flame was giving off bouncy vitality. Firmament flame of Heavenly Flame was a flame that was suitable for refining elixirs. His father had gone through hardships to obtain it.

Using Firmament flame to refine pills could increase the success rate by 10 percent.

Bian Yaoquan focused and squinted his eyes slightly, giving off a vibe similar to a great master.

In sequence, he hurled the various Spiritual Grasses at the Firmament flame as they began to melt slowly.

All the Spiritual Grasses melted into Spiritual Liquid after approximately thirty seconds. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Bian Yaoquan was looking all serious as he matched the recipe bit by bit.

When the crowd saw Bian Yaoquan refining the elixir pills on the spot, they tried to hold their breath as they watched with full attention.

Hah!

After five minutes, Bian Yaoquan exclaimed with a stern-looking face as three pools of liquid slowly coalesced together.

He shouted out with a film of cold sweat breaking out on his forehead.

“Elixir Pill!”

“Form!”

He yelled again as the flame grew intense before him.

The greenish flame cast a shadow on Bian Yaoquan that made him look like some great masters.

Boom!

Just then, a thud was heard, and the greenish flame exploded in different directions.

The Poison Duo at the side was prepared for it as they swung their arms and suppressed the exploding sparks.

“Done!”

Bian Yaoquan was flushed with redness on his cheeks. With a glistening radiance in his eyes, he said, “Haha, I got two pills. Not too bad!”

When the two pills showed up in front of him, he was looking prideful. He had succeeded on his first try. Such talent made him a peerless genius.

“Marvellous!”

“He just refined the pills in ten minutes, bravo!”

“Young Master Bian is a rare talent. His Art of Refining Elixir Pills is formidable. At his age, he’s insurmountable!”

“The most talented youth in this world is you, Young Master Bian!”

All the experts and Miracle Doctors marveled and praised Young Master Bian.

“HA, HA!”

Young Master Bian exhibited an invincible look with hearty laughter. “Talking about Art of Refining Elixir Pills, if I, Bian Yaoquan, proclaim myself to be second among the younger generation, I’m sure no one will claim to be first!”

“Besides, when I improve my Art of Refining Elixir Pills, I can simply use elixir pills to make up for the absence of medical skills. By then, I’ll be unrivaled in terms of medical skills and Art of Refining Elixir Pills!”

Bian Yaoquan exhibited from within himself an immense confidence that was commonly seen in heroes.

Poof!

At this time, Wang Xian could not help but give a half-suppressed laugh.
