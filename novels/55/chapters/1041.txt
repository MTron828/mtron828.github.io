Chapter 1042: 1043, is that him? (10/10)

Translator: 5496903

Born out of thin air!

In the past few days, everyone in Eastern Sea City felt that their hearts couldn’t keep up with the earth-shattering news.

They thought that the appearance of the dragon Spike had already shaken the entire eastern sea city.

In the end, the half-step void interpretation level pet egg once again shook Eastern Sea city.

Before everyone could recover, the half-step void interpretation level Demon Beast Cub appeared, and East Sea city shook again three times!

However, this morning, East Sea city was shaken.

The violent earthquake shook everyone!

“F * ck, who the F * ck would have thought that a half-step void interpretation level demon beast bloodline would be obtained? Whoever can obtain it has a chance to become a half-step void interpretation level expert!”

“Crazy, has the Eastern Sea City gone crazy recently? Where did this immortal Phoenix come from? How could it take out such a precious treasure!”

“If this thing was placed in the Eastern Sea city, it would definitely cause a bloody battle. Even if there were city rules, it would be useless. However, this immortal phoenix is obviously not simple. To be able to take out such a treasure, it must be powerful!”

“It’s a grand event in three days. I must go and take a look at that half-step void interpretation bloodline. Even if I have to take a look, it’s still good!”

In the streets and alleys, every corner of Eastern Sea city was talking about the Demon Beast bloodline.

At first, some people didn’t believe it, but when they saw someone confirm it and saw the immortal Phoenix promoting it on the forum, they had to believe it even if they didn’t dare to believe it!

To everyone in eastern sea city, the half-step Void Interpretation Demonic Beast bloodline was a heaven-defying treasure.

“Hu hu, is it true? Are you sure it’s the half-step Void Interpretation Demonic Beast Bloodline?”

“Sir, I’m sure, I’m 100% Sure!”

“The half-step void interpretation demonic beast bloodline, I must get it, I must get it!”

In a luxurious manor in Eastern Sea City, an old man who was emitting a terrifying aura roared in a low voice with burning eyes.

“Take out all the spirit stones and valuable items in the clan. We’ll fight for the Demon Beast bloodline in three days, even if we have to go bankrupt!”

“Go, go and find out what faction this immortal Phoenix belongs to. Why would it take out such a terrifying treasure!”

“Go and borrow all the people who can borrow spirit stones. This time, we’ll stake everything we have!”

The powerful families of Eastern Sea city were all in an uproar. Prepare, prepare spirit stones!

We must fight for it!

“Half-step Void Interpretation Demon Beast Bloodline, half-step Cave Demon Beast Bloodline!”

At this moment, in a room in the city Lord’s mansion, Lei Feihu heard his subordinate’s report, and his eyes flickered.

He touched his interspatial ring and checked the spirit stones and various resources inside.

“I can give it a try!”

He muttered.

Even if he was a profound void tier expert, he still wanted to obtain the half-step profound void tier demonic beast bloodline.

He didn’t need it, but he could give it to his son.

He knew very well how difficult it was to step into the profound void tier, and how lucky he was.

He had narrowly escaped death to reach this step.

His son couldn’t do it, and he also knew very well that all his descendants couldn’t do it.

Perhaps when he died, the Lei family wouldn’t go into decline, but it would still be vastly different from what it was now.

If his descendants had the half-step void interpretation demonic beast bloodline.

If he used resources to raise one or two of his descendants to the half-step void interpretation level, the Lei family would still be very strong in star-moon kingdom.

He wanted to make a move on this half-step void interpretation demonic beast bloodline.

Wang Xian did not enter the auction. He felt that he had not realized the value of the half-step void interpretation demonic beast bloodline before.

When he saw the pairs of blood-red eyes of everyone around him, he knew that he had underestimated it.

“Things are a little out of my expectations. It seems that I can’t come into contact with long Yi and the rest for the time being. I Can’t let them come back and look for me either. I’ll contact them through the strange demon. We’ll meet again after this matter is over!”

Wang Xian listened to the shocked expressions of the people around him as they discussed about the bloodline of the demonic beasts. A look of deep thought appeared on his face.

For the time being, he couldn’t let others know that the bloodline of the demonic beasts came from his hands. Otherwise, he would be in danger.

“It’s best if I don’t return to my own residence for the time being!”

Wang Xian thought to himself. He looked to his side and whispered, “Get ao Jian and the rest from the residence to bring everything here!”

“It’s the Dragon King!”

A strange voice rang in his ears.

Wang Xian walked around the western district. Speaking of which, he had yet to tour Donghai city properly.

It was a good opportunity for him to tour around these few days!

...

“What? A half-step void interpretation demonic beast bloodline!”

At this moment, in a luxurious auction house located in the Eastern District of Donghai City, a group of workers were decorating it.

When the two managers of the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop heard the news from their subordinates, their faces revealed shock.

They looked at each other, their expressions somewhat awkward.

“Which faction is the Immortal Phoenix? Why is it being auctioned three days later? How can they have such a precious treasure!”

“Immediately report it to the higher-ups. Damn it, why is the water in East Sea City so deep? Why is there suddenly an immortal Phoenix Auction? Immortal Phoenix? Immortal Phoenix? Could it be someone from Immortal Phoenix’s side? But why is there such an unnecessary move?”

“It must be immortal Phoenix’s. I wonder what kind of scheme they have!”

The two old men said with sullen faces. They immediately took out their communication stone plates and announced this major event.

...

“What did you say?”

At the same time, in the Central Region, in the largest auction house in East Sea City, supervisor Yi and the five shopkeepers reported the matter to the two middle-aged elders of the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan with embarrassed expressions.

Their faces were filled with astonishment.

Another auction house suddenly appeared. It actually wanted to auction the half-step Void Interpretation Demon Beast bloodline three days later.

In their eyes, this demon beast bloodline was considered a treasure.

When did such a small east sea city produce so many treasures?

“You guys wait here. We’ll go in and report!”

The two middle-aged men said to supervisor Yi and the others and walked to the door of Feng Luan’s house.

Supervisor Yi’s expression was somewhat strange and somewhat complicated.

“Peng Peng!”

“Your Majesty, we have something to report!”

“Come in!”

Feng Luan was still holding the information in her hands as she frowned and looked at it.

Beside her, their fire cloud sparrow race’s grand supreme stood respectfully at the side.

“Empress, just now, the supervisor and manager of Feng Xian came to report that another auction house has appeared in East Sea city. They are preparing to hold an auction three days later. The item being auctioned is a half-step void interpretation level Demon Beast Bloodline!”

Two middle-aged men walked in and said respectfully.

Feng Luan was slightly stunned and revealed a surprised expression. “A half-step void interpretation level Demon Beast Bloodline?”

“Yes, it’s absolutely true. Right now, it has gone crazy in East Sea City!”

The two middle-aged men nodded heavily.

Feng Luan’s expression changed slightly. This was really bad news after bad news. With a dark expression, she picked up the Teacup on the table.

“What faction is able to take out a half-step void interpretation demonic beast bloodline for auction?”

The old woman at the side asked with a frown.

“I don’t know for the time being. I only know that it’s called the Immortal Phoenix Auction!”

“Huala!”

When the two elders said these words, Feng Luan’s arm trembled and let out a sound.

The old woman was slightly startled. She quickly looked over and asked worriedly, “Empress!”

“Fairy Phoenix? Am I overthinking it, or...”

“Is it him?”
