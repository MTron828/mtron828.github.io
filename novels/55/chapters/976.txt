Chapter 977: 0978 was in an uproar

Translator: 549690339

The entire arena was silent. Everyone stared blankly as the figure disappeared from their sight.

They looked at Qin Shan, who was lying on the ground, and then at the young man in embroidered clothes.

Just now, Qin Shan had used his powerful strength to suppress everyone, becoming the number one freshman and the strongest freshman.

But now, all four of his limbs were crippled.

Just now, the noble and superior member of the young master’s mercenary group, the Jinyi senior, had his arms chopped off.

He was even more miserable than Qin Shan.

It was all because of that young man, that new student, Wang Xian!

“How strong is he exactly?”

A young man mumbled and couldn’t help but swallow another mouthful of saliva.

“This, this...”

Cold sweat kept dripping down Duan Qingwen’s forehead. His eyes were filled with fear.

A guy who dared to cut off the arms of a member of the young master’s mercenary group, even a senior, was too brutal.

If he were to treat him like this, wouldn’t he be finished?

He couldn’t take out spirit stones to restore his arms.

Once his arms were cut off, his life would be over.

Now, he felt lucky that Wang Xian did not pay attention to him at that time. Otherwise...

He could not imagine the consequences!

The expressions on the faces of the rest of the freshmen were also very interesting.

This was the king of the freshmen, the strongest among the freshmen!

A senior at Transcendent Level 4 was cut off in less than ten seconds. This was transcendent level 4!

In that case, his strength was at least at transcendent level 4.

As for whether he was stronger, they didn’t know.

But even so, he was already very impressive.

One had to know that among the first grade freshmen, there were no more than ten students who had reached transcendent level 3. As for transcendent level 4, it was something that the demon Hunter College hadn’t seen in ten years.

Such strength was already on a different level from them.

“Damn it, damn it. Our young master’s mercenary group will not let you off. I, Liu Minghai, will not let you off!”

At this moment, a ferocious expression appeared on the face of the young man in Brocade. An angry voice sounded around the arena.

“Qin Qing, that kid is too arrogant. He actually attacked so heavily!”

The girls from the amethyst mercenary group hurriedly walked to Qin Qing’s side. They looked at her brother’s broken limbs and revealed an angry expression.

“Let’s treat Xiao Shan first!”

Qin Qing’s eyes were bloodshot as she carried Qin Shan and said with a sullen face.

“HMPH, let’s report this to teacher. That fellow’s actions are so ruthless, he should be expelled!”

“That’s right, a mere freshman is actually so arrogant. Does he really think that he’s invincible in the Demon Hunters Academy? It’s easy for our amethyst mercenary group to deal with him!”

A few girls beside her said with displeasure.

“Let’s go. We can’t let this matter go so easily!”

Qin Qing gritted her teeth and said with an embarrassed expression.

The injuries on Qin Shan’s body were not as simple as she said. If he wanted to be completely healed, he would need at least a million middle-grade spirit stones.

After all, even though Wang Xian did not sever his limbs just now, the inside of his body had already been shattered. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

A million middle-grade spirit stones was a terrifying amount of money in their house.

Where did this money come from?

Qin Qing’s expression was extremely ugly. There was only one way, to borrow it from the leader.

However, if she were to repay the debt later...

“Just you wait, just you wait...”

Liu Minghai’s low voice came from the side. He walked out with a ferocious expression.

Qin Qing looked at him. There was some anger in her eyes as well as some helplessness.

If Liu Minghai didn’t say that he would beat Wang Xian up and give him so many spirit stones, her younger brother wouldn’t have made a move.

If it wasn’t for her younger brother giving him 400,000 middle-grade spirit stones, he wouldn’t have fallen into such a situation.

Qin Qing left helplessly.

After watching Qin Qing, Liu Minghai and the rest leave, the new students left slowly.

The events that had happened here today would probably spread throughout the entire demon Hunters Academy soon.

Just as they had said, the events that had happened in the arena for the new students quickly spread through the demon Hunters Academy’s internal communication stone plate.

When everyone saw this news, they were all dumbfounded.

“Damn, it can’t be true, right? are the new students so fierce now?”

“He directly cut off Liu Minghai’s arms. Is He that ferocious? Is He openly provoking the young master’s mercenary group again?”

“That young man is called Wang Xian. He openly threatened the young master’s mercenary group not to provoke him. Otherwise, he would have his limbs crippled. This is the first person who dares to challenge the young master’s mercenary group!”

“Liu Minghai’s arms were directly cut off. If he wants to recover, he would need at least ten million middle-grade spirit stones. He is completely at odds with the young master’s mercenary group!”

“It’s not just the young master’s mercenary group. Qin Qing’s younger brother was also crippled by Wang Xian. He even provoked the amethyst mercenary group!”

“I heard that Qin Qing’s younger brother needs at least 10 million middle-grade spirit stones for his limbs to be healed. Qin Qing has quite a good relationship with the amethyst mercenary group. There are probably many of her sisters who want to avenge her!”

“This new student’s strength is really terrifying. His talent can be ranked at the top in our Demon Hunter College!”

“So what if he’s terrifying? Now that he has provoked young master’s mercenary group and amethyst mercenary group, that Kid is probably finished!”

Within the communication stone plate, a group of Demon Hunter Academy students were discussing what had happened today.

Towards a new student who had offended the demon Hunter Academy’s two large mercenary groups, everyone was somewhat dumbstruck.

No matter how powerful you were, if you directly provoked the Demon Hunter Academy’s two powerful mercenary groups, you would be doomed in the future.

It was not impossible for you to die in the wild.

“What an arrogant kid. Very good, very good. It has been a long time since someone dared to provoke our young master’s mercenary group!”

At this moment, in the west of the Demon Hunters Academy, there was an area.

This area was the base of the academy’s mercenary group.

Some of the top mercenary groups of the Academy would establish a headquarters here.

In a luxurious courtyard, there were tables, chairs, and benches placed all around. More than ten young men sat on chairs one by one.

In the front seat, a young man was feeding a two-meter-long black bird with fresh fierce beast meat.

As he was feeding it, he said coldly.

“Liu Haiming has gone to treat it. That Kid has slapped our young master’s mercenary group twice in a row. Those who don’t know better will think that we are easy to bully!”

Beside them, a young man wearing a black hat leaned back on a chair and said slowly with his head held high.

“Then we won’t play with him. Find an opportunity to directly kill him!”

The young man feeding the Black Bird said faintly.

“Get Someone to monitor that kid. If he leaves the city or accepts any mission, report immediately!”

The group of young men in the courtyard said. They didn’t have much of a reaction to what happened today.

Dogs that bite don’t bark.

They were a group of young masters with extraordinary families. They didn’t just rely on spirit stones to make their young master’s mercenary group become the sixth ranked existence in the demon Hunters Academy.

It was their own strength.
