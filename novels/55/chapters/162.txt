Chapter 163: The Price of Getting Off the Car (1)

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

A fleet of fifty to sixty wedding cars drove into Rivertown in a massive formation as they headed to the Summer Sun International Hotel.

Ten Rolls-Royces, ten Bentleys and the rest were other posh cars like Lamborghinis Aventadors and Maseratis.

This team of wedding cars, worth at least $300 million, looked extremely lavish.

When the cars entered the city area of Rivertown, they drew the immediate attention of many people.

Such a luxurious wedding fleet was uncommon.

Uncle Zhang and Aunt Zhang were sitting in a Rolls-Royce, looking around happily.

Wang Xian and Xiao Yu were beaming as they followed behind the car fleet.

“Sister Li got married in a blink of an eye. I wonder when it’ll be your turn!” Xiao Yu stared gleefully at the car fleet in front.

“You think too much. I’m only a year-two student,” Wang Xian said nonchalantly as he darted a look at Xiao Yu.

“Hehe.” Xiao Yu chuckled. The car fleet quickly arrived at the doorstep of the Summer Sun International Hotel.

There was ample open space for parking in front of the hotel.

Under the direction of the hotel staff, a fleet of fifty to sixty wedding cars was parked in rows. The scene was spectacular.

Wang Xian and Xiao Yu stepped out of the car. Wang Xian fished out his phone and made calls to those who had contacted him yesterday.

After he ended the call, Miao Zhiyong and the rest of them, who were waiting for him in advance, trotted over.

“Young Master Wang!” Six of them greeted him with a beaming face.

“Thank you for taking the trouble to come over here today,” Wang Xian said to them with a smile.

“It’s no trouble. You’re welcome!”

Miao Zhiyong and the rest quickly waved their hands. “It’s our honor to offer you our help. Besides, it’s a small matter.”

“Thank you!” Wang Xian nodded with a smile.

“What? They want us to go over ourselves? This is fu*king too much! Our car fleet has arrived downstairs and yet, they refused to receive us personally? What is this?”

At the same time, Uncle Zhang’s raging voice was heard from the front.

Wang Xian frowned slightly and walked over immediately while Xiao Yu followed behind quickly.

Miao Zhiyong and the rest who were following behind were puzzled as well.

When they received the orders from Old Qin and Young Master Wang to put up a front for the bride in Wei Family’s wedding today, they thought of such a situation.

But now, it seemed more severe than they thought.

“Is the Wei Family seeking their doom?” A middle-aged man could not help but whisper.

“Let’s take a look!”

“What’s wrong, Uncle Zhang?” Wang Xian and Xiao Yu walked to the first Rolls-Royce and asked Uncle Zhang doubtfully. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Wei Zhiwen is such a loser. He wants us to go to the eighth floor ourselves. Going there by ourselves? They are not even providing the wedding car. Now that we’re here, they didn’t even bother to receive us? Do they know the rules? Aren’t they bullying us?” Uncle Zhang raised his voice in a fit of anger. Aunt Zhang, next to him, was looking dreadful.

Sister Li was looking embarrassed.

“This is too much! What a bunch of assholes!” Xiao Yu raged after she heard Uncle Zhang’s account. However, she immediately covered her mouth the moment she realized her choice of words.

“Xiao Yu, you’re right. Those assholes think we’re some pushovers!” Uncle Zhang immediately agreed with what Xiao Yu said.

You think it’s troublesome to fetch us in a wedding car. Fine. Yesterday, you refused to show up at the wedding banquet of the bride. This is over.

And now this? Uncle Zhang could not take it lying down anymore.

When Wang Xian heard this, his face turned sullen. With a pair of cold eyes he said, “Has the Wei Family finished setting up the banquet in the hotel?”

“Yes, they are done. They invited quite a few people over. Still, their family took this wedding seriously,” Sister Li replied immediately.

“Seriously? They’re trying to make themselves look good. What about us? This is not the first time!” Uncle Zhang snarled. Sister Li did not dare to reply to her raging father.

“Calm down. Calm down!” Aunt Zhang comforted him.

“We’ll wait over here. They want to look good, right? Get them to come over and receive us. If they don’t come, we’re not going up. Let’s wait and see!” Wang Xian looked at Uncle Zhang and suggested.

“Xiao Xian is right. Xiao Li, you will tell Wei Zhiwen to get his butt down here to receive us with his family. Otherwise, we’re not going up. Tell him this is what I said!” Uncle Zhang said directly.

Xiao Li showed a bitter expression. But when she thought of Wang Xian’s effort, getting her a fleet of luxurious cars in Rivertown, she was unhappy to walk up herself. So, she called her boyfriend.

Wei Zhiwen, who was greeting the guests, answered his girlfriend’s phone immediately in the hotel.

Soon, he had an embarrassing look as he hurriedly consoled her.

“Mom, Dad, let’s go down and receive Xiao Li, shall we? Xiao Li and her family have arrived!” Wei Zhiwen walked to his parents and said bitterly.

“Hur? Didn’t we tell them to come up straight to the eighth floor?” the middle-aged lady frowned and said with an impatient expression.

“Mom, the father-in-law said we must receive them. Otherwise, we’re not following the customary practice,” Wei Zhiwen answered with an embarrassed look.

“Practice? Since they’re here, they should abide by our practices. Are we going to abide by their practices from the countryside? Can they afford it?” The middle-aged woman threw out mean words.

“Get them to come up now and stop making trouble!” Wei Qingguo frowned and continued. “We still have to entertain our friends and relatives!”

“This...” Wei Zhiwen was feeling helpless. He made a call again.

However, before he could even finish what he wanted to say, an angry voice was heard from the phone.

“Wei Zhiwen, I’m telling you now! Either your family comes down to receive us, or I’ll send my daughter back!”

Upon hearing this, Wei Zhiwen’s face paled slightly.

He was an introvert, and he had been an obedient child to his parents since he was young. This time, he had shown great determination in marrying Xiao Li.

Now that he was in such a situation, he could not do much.

“Dad, Mom?” Wei Zhiwen came to his parents with a dreadful look.

“What’s the matter?” the middle-aged lady raised her eyebrows and asked.

“Father-in-law is unwilling to come up on his own. Let’s go down, shall we? We just need to receive them and bring them up,” Wei Zhiwen pleaded as he asked.

“Such a trouble-maker!” The middle-aged lady sulked as she stared at her son with dissatisfaction.

“Fine. Let’s go. It’s not good if we insist!” Wei Qingguo frowned and said to them.

“Hmph, let’s go!”

“We’re going down to fetch the bride. Please take a seat, everyone!” Wei Qingguo greeted his friends, relatives, and his business acquaintances as he prepared to go down.

“Oh? Picking up the bride? Let’s go and have a look.”

“Yes, we’re going over too. We haven’t seen how beautiful the bride is!”

“Haha, yes. Let’s join the party!”

The friends and relatives around them followed behind with curiosity.

They had yet to see the bride, so they wanted to check her out.
