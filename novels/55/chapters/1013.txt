Translator: 5496903

“Spirit Enchantment!”

Wang Xian waved the lightning strike wood in his hand toward the sky. The entire lightning strike wood seemed to have come to life.

The destructive power of a void interpretation level lightning strike wood after spirit enchantment could reach the destructive power of an extraordinary level nine.

“Bind!”

Wang Xian transformed into a divine dragon. His huge body instantly appeared in the lair of the wind-winged savage fish. He slammed his dragon claws heavily on the ground.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

The dragon energy transformed into thorns and twined around the wind-winged savage fish.

“Earth Burial!”

Wang Xian did not stop moving. His body was emitting earthy yellow energy. The soil that appeared out of thin air was buried towards the wind-winged savage fish.

“Whoosh! Whoosh!”

On the left and right sides, the strange demon and Ao demon instantly attacked the wind-winged savage fish.

The two attacks landed heavily on the body of the wind-winged savage fish.

“Crack! Crack!”

Above his head, the lightning-struck wood struck the wind-winged savage fish’s body.

“Roar, wind domain!”

The wind-winged savage fish struggled violently, but he could not resist the attacks of Ao Yao, the strange demon, and the lightning-struck wood.

Green light bloomed on his body, and the entire nest was instantly covered in green.

“Bang! Bang! Bang!”

The powerful attacks of Ao Yaoyao and the rest landed on the body of the wind-winged savage fish, causing it to tremble. However, it did not suffer any injuries.

Meanwhile, Wang Xian suddenly felt gusts of wind energy tearing at his body from all directions.

The powerful force wanted to tear his body apart.

Wang Xian’s body moved for a while, and his body was covered in soil. He opened his mouth and spat out a mouthful of dragon flames, attacking the wind-winged savage fish directly.

Whoosh

However, just as he spat out the dragon flames, a strong gust of wind blew towards him.

The wind aided the fire. The Flames attacked Wang Xian with an even stronger destructive force.

His expression changed slightly. He opened his mouth and swallowed the flames directly.

“Gold crack void!”

Wang Xian released his supernatural ability directly and attacked the wind-winged savage fish.

Buzz

The skin on the wind-winged savage fish fluttered once again, and the entire space trembled once again.

The golden space-splitting supernatural ability was actually blown away. Numerous wind needles were formed in the void.

“F * ck, how did the strength of this wind-winged savage fish suddenly increase by so much!”

Wang Xian had a serious expression on his face. He moved his body and said, “Water crisis exploding city, control the water!”

He moved his body and the surrounding seawater froze instantly. The speed of the wind needles was reduced completely.

“Vital points!”

Wang Xian stared at the few weaknesses of the wind-winged savage fish and shouted at Ao Yao and the strange demon.

“Kill!”

Ao Yao and the strange demon attacked the wind-winged savage fish from both sides.

“The wood world has descended!”

Wang Xian stared at the lightning-struck wood floating in the sky and roared.

With the lightning-struck wood as the center, trees appeared out of thin air. All the trees pressed down on the wind-winged savage fish.

In the middle, a tree that was emitting lightning turned into a wooden spike and pierced downwards.

“Get lost!”

The Dark Crown on the wind-winged Savage Fish’s head enlarged and formed a tornado that swept towards all the trees.

“Light explosion!”

“Light and Darkness!”

The strange and Ao Yao seized this opportunity and attacked the two places beside him with their sharp claws.

“Bang! Bang!”

Two violent explosions sounded from the body of the wind-winged savage fish.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

The wind-winged savage fish let out a rapid roar. Its body was actually shrinking rapidly, and its entire body was covered by green leather.

Wang Xian waved his dragon claw and the green layer of skin was torn apart, revealing the severely injured leader of the wind-winged savage fish.

There were two huge wounds on both sides of its body, almost causing it to die.

“I surrender, the great leader of the wind-winged Savage Fish clan surrenders. Don’t kill me, don’t kill me!”

The wind-winged savage fish saw Wang Xian staring at it with a strange gaze. Its body trembled as it spoke to him.

Wang Xian stretched out his dragon claws and grabbed its body before throwing it into his mouth.

“Bang! Bang!”

A green crown fell from the top of its head. Wang Xian’s eyes flickered as he transformed into his human form.

After swallowing the leader of the wind-winged savage fish, which was at supernatural level 8, he had gained an additional 100,000 dragon crystals.

With a move of his arm, the wind-winged crown on the ground appeared in his hand.

Wind-winged crown: half-step void interpretation

“A crown of the half-step cave level. No wonder it’s so powerful. It can actually withstand the ao Yao’s attack and even restrain it!”

Wang Xian revealed a look of surprise. He wore the crown on his head, but in the end, he awkwardly realized that he couldn’t wear it since he didn’t possess the wind attribute.

Helpless, Wang Xian could only put it away.

Following that, Wang Xian walked to the side of the green leather on the ground.

It was because of this that the size of the leader of the wind-winged savage fish was increased to ten meters. The attacks it released were also very powerful.

Wind-winged king skin: half-step void interpretation

With the activation of the bloodline of the wind-winged pomfret, it could transform into the king of the wind-winged!

“Another half-step void interpretation treasure. However, only the bloodline of the wind-winged savage fish is useful. I can refine it into a cape or wings!”

Wang Xian looked at the ten-meter-large leather and kept it with a smile on his face.

Looking at the back of the collapsed cave, Wang Xian walked toward it excitedly.

“Bang!”

Beside the entrance, a ball of energy blocked his figure.

This was not a formation but a pure wind-elemental energy.

Wang Xian shook his arm and shattered it.

“What a huge space!”

In an instant, Wang Xian’s eyes lit up.

Spirit Stones, wind chime flower, wind chime liquid, azure stone! 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Wang Xian immediately walked to the front of the pile of spirit stones. His eyes were filled with excitement. There were low-grade, middle-grade, and upper-grade spirit stones.

Spirit stones were treasures to any living creature. Even demonic beasts could consume them as food.

“More than 30 million middle-grade spirit stones!”

Wang Xian placed all the spirit stones into his interspatial ring. His eyes were filled with excitement.

Following that, he came to the side of the azure stone, the wind chime flower, and the wind chime liquid.

Piles and piles.

The wind chime liquid was placed into a pool. It couldn’t be described as a drop at all. It could be described as a pool.

Wang Xian dared to say without exaggeration that the value of the wind chime liquid in this pool was more than 700 to 800 million middle-grade spirit stones.

“I’m Rich! I’m really rich this time. I didn’t expect a demonic beast race to be so rich!”

Wang Xian’s face was filled with excitement as he placed all the treasures into his interspatial ring.

“There’s more here!”

Wang Xian walked forward and discovered all kinds of weapons and armor.

Among them, there were many transcendent level seven weapons and armor.

There were also many interspatial rings.

The hundreds of interspatial rings in Wang Xian’s hands were all filled with the corpses of ferocious beasts and demonic beasts. There were not many of them left now, and these interspatial rings were in short supply.

As he walked deeper into the pool, there were all sorts of miscellaneous items. They should be treasures obtained from the hunting of humans by the wind-winged savage fish. They were worth quite a lot.

“What is this?”

However, when Wang Xian walked to the middle of the pool, he found a small pool. There was a pool of liquid in the pool and his face was filled with curiosity!
