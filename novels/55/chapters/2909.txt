Chapter 2910: relied on the Dragon Palace’s boundless Mana 8

“This is bad. The situation isn’t good. More than 20 god-emperor level demonic beasts have flown out of the demon cave. This is troublesome.”

“We only have a dozen god-emperor level experts on our side. I wonder if we can withstand them with other divine artifacts.”

“Why did so many terrifying demonic beasts suddenly appear in the chimei region? Damn it.”

At the battlefield, the six legions, with the exception of the injured, all entered the battlefield.

Many god emperor-level experts blocked the invasion of the god emperor-level demonic beasts.

This was the most ferocious invasion in the past few days.

At the front of the battle platform, a group of injured people stared at the battlefield in front of them with embarrassed expressions.

Endless demonic beasts pounced on them, and the soldiers of the glazed domain resisted with all their might.

In a war of this level, they could not retreat to their divine kingdoms when they were in danger.

Once they retreated, the others would be in danger.

In that case, they would not be Yao Xie’s match.

Therefore, they could only fight to the death.

The fall of the Divine Emperors was not because they could not escape, but because they could not escape or retreat. That was why the five Divine Emperors had fallen.

“Junior brother, master will be fine, right?”

On the battle platform, the senior sister, who had unparalleled combat techniques, looked at the battle ahead and said with a grave expression.

Facing the battle ahead and the terrifying scene, he was a little afraid.

“Sigh, master, this old man is getting old. His brain is not as bright as it used to be. Come back and take a look at Grand Master. Why did you still come here to fight against Yaoxie and inherit your father’s position? It’s fine now. It’s hard to say if he will still be alive.”

“This kind of thing should be avoided as far as possible.”

Invincible battle technique also helplessly looked at the battlefield in front of him and said. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“This…”

Invincible battle technique’s senior sister looked at him and didn’t know what to say.

No matter what, her master was a hero in her heart. As for her junior brother, he was too cowardly, a bear.

“Do you think everyone is like you, like a coward? What is the purpose of cultivation? Isn’t it to protect our home, to settle scores quickly?”

Right at this moment, an angry voice suddenly came from behind.

“Huh?”

When invincible battle technique heard this, he turned his head to look.

He found that it was the middle-aged man who was dressed like a mech. He curled his lips, and a look of disdain appeared on his face.

“Hmph, although I really hate Shangshui Qingshan, he did not disgrace the name of Shangshui. I really don’t know how he has such a useless disciple like you, Trash!”

When the middle-aged man saw the look of disdain on the face of the invincible in battle techniques, his face was filled with anger as he berated him.

“Hehe, Hei Yao, don’t bother with this guy. He’s a coward.”

“He’s not bad, but he’s cowardly. Why bother with such a coward?”

“That’s right, brother Hei Yao. There’s no need to waste your breath on such a person!”

At the back, a group of wounded soldiers saw the situation and said to Hei Yao.

“I’m not from your glazed tile region. I cultivate in order to pursue longevity.”

Invincible battle technique raised his head, completely ignoring the mockery of the soldiers.

“HMPH!”

When Shangshui Hei Yao saw that he was not afraid of boiling water, he retreated with a black face and stared nervously at the battlefield in front of him.

Invincible battle technique took out a mirror and also paid attention to the battlefield in front of him.

The bitter battle continued. In the void, Yao Xie screamed and humans screamed, accompanied by terrifying collisions.

The sound reverberated throughout the void.

“It’s alright. Grand Supreme Fourth Elder is very strong. He’s not at a disadvantage even when fighting against two divine emperor level Yao Xie. The situation is about to stabilize.”

An hour later, the senior sister who was invincible in battle looked ahead. She heaved a sigh of relief when she saw the current situation.

They had three first level divine emperor level Yao Xie on their side. They were completely held back by the Divine Emperor Shangshui and the Grand Supreme Fourth Elder.

Below them, hundreds of millions of soldiers formed a battle formation. Relying on the war machines and the battleships, they gradually gained the upper hand.

“Di di Di!”

However, suddenly, an urgent alarm sounded in the center of the battle platform.

Hearing this sound, invincible battle technique was slightly stunned.

“Oh no, another demon cave has appeared!”

Behind them, when the injured heard this urgent alarm, their expressions changed greatly.

They flew into the sky one by one and stared straight ahead.

“There are two incomparably huge demon caves flying towards us. There might be divine emperor level demonic beasts in there.”

An old man stared at the front with a grave expression and roared.

“All legions, retreat. Retreat to the third line. All Retreat!”

At this moment, an ice-cold Roar came from the center.

“Fall back! We will hold back the demon cave at the divine emperor level. The rest of the soldiers, fall back immediately!”

Divine Emperor Shangshui’s voice came.

“Fall back!”

Everyone from the third Legion immediately retreated.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

The fighting ring behind invincible battle technique also let out a boom. The entire fighting ring started to move, and countless cannon barrels stretched out.

The cannon barrels were aimed at the position in front.

“This…”

When invincible battle technique saw this scene, his expression changed slightly.

In the position in front, all the soldiers of the third Legion were retreating in this direction.

In the void in front, God Emperor Shangshui and the Grand Supreme Fourth Elder were resisting the three God Emperor rank one demonic beasts.

Meanwhile, terrifying roars came from the two demon caves that flew over.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

At this moment, many ferocious and huge heads flew out from the demon caves.

“This is bad. All the soldiers, retreat quickly. Green Mountain, we can hold on for a few more minutes.”

The fourth Supreme Elder looked over and roared with a grave expression.

“Retreat, Retreat, Retreat!”

The soldiers of the third Legion quickly retreated and soon arrived at the front of the fighting ring.

“Everyone, get on the battle platform!”

The commanders of the battle groups ordered loudly.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

Countless soldiers retreated to the battle platform. Unrivaled battle technique and his senior sister quickly made way and stared at the front with grave expressions.

In the front, countless yaoxie were pouncing towards them.

And in the two huge demon caves, two first level divine emperor Yaoxie led countless subordinates and flew out.

Some of them pounced toward God Emperor Shangshui and the fourth Grand Supreme Elder, while others attacked the battle platform.

“Not good. Master and the other two have to deal with five first-level divine emperor Yao Xie.”

The senior martial sister, who was invincible in battle techniques, looked forward with an ugly expression.

Five against two. If they were not careful, their master might die.

“It’s fine, it’s fine. The fourth Grand Supreme Elder Veluriyam should have a supreme treasure and trump card. Veluriyam is the strongest faction after all, so it should have a trump card.”

Invincible battle technique’s expression changed slightly when he saw this scene. He muttered to himself as he continued to speak.

“All the soldiers on the platform, attack Yaoxie in front of us. Activate the battle platform and retreat from here. Only when we retreat can the commander and the others retreat. Attack!”

“Attack!”

At this moment, a furious roar came from the side.

Invincible battle technique looked at Yaoxie who was charging towards them. In addition to Yaoxie who had appeared from two demon caves, they were already at a disadvantage.

“Alas!”

He sighed heavily.
