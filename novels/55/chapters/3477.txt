3478 2,477 pairs of dragon eyes, the abyss skeleton pool

“You’re courting death. Let Him Go!”

The Divine Dragon of light in the sky was furious when he saw Wang Xian continuously attacking his companions. He roared and attacked Wang Xian once again.

“Hmph, I’m courting death? It’s you guys who are courting death!”

Wang Xian’s eyes were filled with killing intent. He flapped his wings and grabbed the divine dragon of light under him and flew to the side.

This divine light dragon was already severely injured. The consecutive attacks made him unable to move.

Wang Xian was not affected at all as he was carrying him.

Moreover, when Wang Xian was flying, the terrifying dark forces were still ravaging his body.

“Stop!”

The divine light dragon behind him had a drastic change in expression as he continued to give chase.

However, his speed could not be compared to Wang Xian’s. He could not catch up at all.

“Take revenge for me!”

Soon, a roar filled with killing intent came out from the mouth of the divine light dragon beneath Wang Xian.

“Divine light!”

The other three divine light dragons looked at him at the same time as they roared with blood-red eyes.

Bang

Wang Xian grabbed his body and landed heavily on the ground. With a wave of his arm, he kept the corpse of the Divine Light Dragon.

“Next is you!”

He stared at the Divine Radiant Dragon who had been attacking him. A cold look appeared in his eyes.

Whoosh

Wang Xian flapped his incipient saint wings and arrived at the other side at a terrifying speed.

“This is bad. His speed is too fast. He has too many powerful treasures in his hands. We can’t kill him at all!”

The Divine Radiant Dragon’s expression changed drastically as he roared loudly.

A light dragon scale burst out from his entire body and floated around him.

“Bang!”

Wang Xian’s attack landed on it but was blocked by the Divine Light Dragon.

“Boom!”

In the next moment, Wang Xian relied on his continuous attacks on the divine light dragon in front of him.

Under Wang Xian’s speed, he had no ability to resist at all.

Unless he used an all-round attack, he would not be able to touch Wang Xian at all.

He would be completely suppressed.

However, Wang Xian could rely on his speed to fight against three people at the same level, or even kill them in an instant.

However, he had to take them by surprise first.

Take this divine light dragon for example. He was fully prepared. Under his full defense, Wang Xian would not be able to kill him in a short period of time.

This was especially so for the Divine Light Dragon, which was famous for its recovery ability.

“Let’s go back!”

“Retreat!”

“Just you wait. Our Holy Dragon lineage will take your head very soon!”

The three divine dragons of light and red-eye glared at Wang Xian and shouted sternly.

They began to gather immediately!

“Dragon Suppression Mountain, move!”

The three divine dragons of light gathered slowly. Waves of terrifying light waves swept across the surroundings.

“Red-eye world, explode!”

When red-eyed saw that they were about to leave, he let out a furious roar with an embarrassed expression.

Boom

A loud sound rang out. The entire world seemed to have collapsed.

Wang Xian sensed the waves of energy and retreated backward continuously.

The Tai Chi Dragon Plate had yet to recover. It was difficult for him to withstand the waves of energy.

The three divine dragons of light and red-eyed figures started to turn illusory and disappeared!

Wang Xian stood at the back and watched them leave.

He couldn’t stop them either.

These divine light dragons and red-eyed figures were stronger than ordinary level two masters of the universe.

At the very least, they were much stronger than the level two masters of the universe that he had encountered.

Especially the first strike of their spears, which caused cracks to appear on the Taiji Dragon Plate.

If not for the Tai Chi Dragon Plate, he would definitely be severely injured.

“I wonder when the spirit spirit will wake up. If the spirit spirit wakes up, I should be able to save another one.”

Wang Xian mumbled.

Due to the exhaustion of the spirit spirit and Wang Xian’s breakthrough, it was still in a deep sleep, waiting for improvement.

“I have to be more careful from now on!”

Wang Xian was rather surprised by the ambush this time.

He had already changed his energy, yet the other party was still able to find his location and was even able to confirm his location.

Such means were amazing.

This time, the other party had misjudged his strength. Next time, he would definitely send someone stronger.

This was especially so for the Holy Dragon lineage. The next person who would ambush him would probably be the divine light dragon with the level three combat strength of the Master of the universe.

In the Holy Dragon lineage, there were at least a dozen experts of such level.

The Tai Chi Dragon Disk should be able to recover in a few months. I should head to the abyssal skeleton pool first

Wang Xian thought to himself. His body moved and he flew towards a direction.

“What was the battle just now? Was it a divine dragon? Why is there still the power of Light?”

“Was it the Holy Dragon lineage who ambushed and attacked the ancestral dragon lineage? They didn’t seem to have succeeded!”

In the surrounding area, some of the powerhouses from the land of magic bones muttered in shock when they saw Wang Xian leaving.

The previous stand had shocked many of the powerhouses in the surrounding area.

When Wang Xian started his journey, he was at the Endless Divine Mountain of light.

Dragon roars and roars could be heard from time to time.

At an extremely far location, in the sky above the Divine Mountain, there were many sacred palaces floating in the sky.

This was the border of the Angel clan.

Inside a Holy Mountain, three divine dragons were flying toward the huge holy mountain with a stone statue of a divine dragon.

“The divine light has fallen!”

As the three Divine Dragons approached the Holy Mountain, a majestic voice was heard.

“Yes, Holy Dragon King. The powerhouse of the Dragon Palace is very powerful. Not only does he have a powerful supreme treasure, but he also has a ghost avatar. Even if we join forces with red-eye of the Hundred Cities Alliance, we are still no match for him.”

The Three Holy Dragons replied with an ugly expression.

“I know, my son!”

“Father!”

“Go and kill him with Your Dragon Eyes!”

“Yes, Father!”

A voice came from the Holy Mountain.

“Roar!”

Soon, a huge holy dragon about 100,000 meters in size flew out and arrived in front of the three Holy Dragons.

“Greetings, son of the Divine Dragon!”

The three divine dragons immediately bowed respectfully.

“Contact the people from the Hundred Cities Alliance and bring me there to kill him and avenge the divine light!”

The son of the Divine Dragon said coldly.

“It’s the son of the Divine Dragon. With the two dragon eyes, the most precious treasure of our holy dragon lineage, we will definitely be able to kill him easily!”

The three divine dragons immediately responded!

…

“We have arrived at the abyssal Skeleton Pool!”

At the same time, in the land of demonic bones, Wang Xian came to the front of the Abyss Skeleton Pool with a smile on his face. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

The Abyss Skeleton Pool was an incomparably huge depression. The huge pit was covered with all kinds of bones.

This place was unlike the underground demon cave city where there were tunnels.

Here, if one wanted to obtain some bones with energy, one had to dive in.

Using the bones as water, one had to traverse through the interior.

As they were all bone parts, it was easier to traverse through the interior.

However, the danger here was much higher than the underground demon cave city.

“If I dive in by myself, the Hundred Cities Alliance and the Holy Dragon lineage can only use the same method to ambush me. It’s almost impossible to pinpoint my location.”

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered as he flew downwards.
