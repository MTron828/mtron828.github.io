Chapter 2932: conquering the weaponsmiths imperial region 7

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

A roar came out from Wang Xian’s mouth. A seven-colored divine dragon appeared in front of the giant creator.

Behind the seven-colored divine dragon was an incomparably huge holy wing.

The wings emitted a green glow that did not belong to the seven-colored divine dragon. They were covered with densely packed dragon scales.

The other pair of wings was made up of bones. They did not have wings and looked a little strange.

However, the 30,000-meter-long divine dragon’s might contained an endless pressure.

“What is this? Divine Dragon? Why are there eight attributes? What is going on?”

The creator, who was like a space giant, stared at the tiny Wang Xian in front of him. His eyes sparkled as he analyzed all sorts of data.

“Also, why are there so many divine emperors appearing in the Dragon Palace all of a sudden? The Dragon Palace intentionally ordered me to send all the mechanical corps over. They want to capture all of them in one go!”

“Damn the Dragon Palace, damn the Dragon King!”

The creator’s eyes sparkled as he scanned his surroundings. His heart was burning with rage.

If he did not have a mechanical appearance at this moment, his expression would definitely be extremely ugly.

“Roar!”

At this moment, Wang Xian, who had transformed into a divine dragon, moved. He flapped his dragon wings and instantly appeared in front of the Creator’s chest.

Crack! Crack! Crack

The moment Wang Xian arrived, numerous holes appeared in front of the Creator’s chest. Lava-like fire laws charged at him directly.

Wang Xian swayed his body and easily dodged the attack of the lava flames.

“Bang! Bang! Bang!”

The dragon tail swept across the creator’s waist.

Sparks flew in all directions in an instant.

A special liquid flowed out of it.

“Get lost, Dragon King! I’m going to kill you!”

The creator roared furiously. His huge fist smashed towards Wang Xian.

At this moment, Wang Xian’s 30,000-meter-tall body was already very huge. However, he was still very tiny in front of the creator.

It was as though a human was facing a monster the size of earth.

“Creator, you are the one who is going to die today!”

Wang Xian’s eyes revealed a look of disdain.

He opened his dragon mouth and spat out a long river of destructive energy.

Crack! Crack! Crack

The creator moved his arm and an incomparably huge shield appeared on it. It blocked the long river of five elements destruction.

“Roar, Roar, Break!”

Wang Xian’s figure flashed and appeared at the Creator’s leg in an instant. He clawed with his dragon claws.

“Bang, Bang, Bang!”

A huge mark that was tens of millions of kilometers long appeared on the creator’s right leg.

Metal parts were revealed from it.

“D * MN Dragon King!”

“Explode!”

A vast force charged directly at the front of his body.

The earthy yellow energy charged towards Wang Xian’s body.

“Eh? What kind of attack is this?”

Wang Xian was slightly shocked. His body was repelled by this huge force and he kept flying backward.

“Roar!”

However, at the next moment, Wang Xian arrived directly above the creator at a terrifying speed.

He flapped his incipient saint wings and an incomparably huge wind blade slashed towards his head.

Boom! Boom! Boom

At the spot where his head was located, a dazzling metallic giant sword shot out instantly. The metallic giant sword sliced through the entire void and met the wind blade.

Boom

Two terrifying attacks collided and the void exploded.

Crack! Crack! Crack

However, at this moment, Wang Xian used his suppressive speed to fly to the back of the creator. His dragon claw slashed directly behind him, creating a crack that was over a hundred million kilometers in size.

Waves of light and dark energy entered the creator’s body.

“Di di Di di Di, your body is severely injured. The area of damage has reached 35% . The enemy in front of you is undefeatable! Undefeatable!”

The Voice of a notification sounded in the mind of the creator, making him even angrier.

“Weng!”

“Break!”

“Rumble!”

All of a sudden, a voice came from the side, accompanied by a mighty impact force.

“Di di Di di di mechanical planet has been damaged by 300, mechanical planet has been damaged by 300, and 52.1 billion robot subordinates have been killed. Warning, suffering from a rank 3 void God Emperor’s Attack!”

At this moment, the creator’s mind once again sounded.

“What?”

The creator’s vast body trembled, and his gaze immediately swept to the side.

He saw an old man quietly floating in the middle of the mechanical emperor region’s hundreds of mechanical planets.

The surrounding 300 mechanical planets had all lost their energy and were falling downwards.

All the mechanical humans on the mechanical planets were killed.

“A rank three void God emperor expert, and the Dragon Palace has a rank three void God emperor expert. No wonder the Dragon Palace dared to charge in!”

The Creator’s mechanical heart was beating violently, and rays of death rays shot out from his eyes.

“Hahaha, Kill, Kill, Kill!”

“Keke, kill all of these things that are neither human nor Ghost!”

At the side, 1.5 million experts from the Dragon Palace were shuttling through the robot army.

The number of the robot army was thousands or tens of thousands of times that of the Dragon Palace.

However, in front of the experts of the Dragon Palace, they could not resist at all.

The 200,000-strong Mad Dragon was fighting against the creator’s bio-human army.

The bio-humans could not feel pain or fear. They only knew how to fight.

However, the creator’s most elite bio-human army could not resist the mad dragon’s attacks.

In the entire army, there were only four existences that could match a divine emperor.

However, these four bio-humans were surrounded by the eight divine emperors of the Dragon Palace.

There were too many divine emperors in the Dragon Palace.

It was almost double the number of their robot army.

There were not many divine emperors in the robot army, and there were many battleships that could contend against them.

However, these battleships were useless under the wind god Dragon’s mobility and speed.

Many battleships of the strategic level that could contend against god-emperor level battleships were quickly destroyed.

As for those battleships that could contend against a rank 2 void God Emperor, they had already been destroyed by the sky array.

The sky array was not an ordinary rank 3 void God Emperor expert.

A million devouring dragons were excitedly tearing at the mechas and battle mechas.

Their huge bodies were not any smaller than mecha.

With 18 claws, as long as they got close to the mecha, they would be able to destroy it.

As for the arrow dragon species, they were natural enemies to these warships, mechs, mechs and the like!

Under the defense of the imperial dragon species, they were shooting at them without any restraint.

One arrow from Mu Zesen could even destroy a mechanical planet!

A magical battlefield appeared in the void. Terrifying monsters were hunting down all kinds of battleships and armors!

This was a crushing battle. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Beep, BEEP, Beep. According to our analysis, the enemy has the ability to crush us. In an hour at most, all of our robots will be destroyed!”

“Warning! Warning! Retreat quickly! Retreat quickly!”

The creator watched all of this as the AI’s calculated data was transmitted to his mind.
