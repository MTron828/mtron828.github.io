Chapter 469: Team Up

“Can you rob and kill anyone over here?” asked Wang Xian to the old man with an English mustache as he surveyed the spectating crowd with an arching of his lips.

“Lad, you’re really inexperienced. Hand over that token to me, and I’ll spare your life. Otherwise, a new body will be found on the ground!”

The old man with an English mustache grinned with a bloodthirsty look.

Wang Xian chuckled and nodded his head slowly. “I got it!”

As his voice trailed off, he lunged with a swift attack at that old man.

“Hur?”

The four old Japanese men froze for a moment.

“Bastard, Water attack!”

That old man raged as he pulled out his samurai sword from his belt. He wielded it at Wang Xian with a movement that flowed smoothly like water.

“Trash! Slay!”

Wang Xian exhibited a disdainful look in his eyes as he swung his arm and struck at the old man with an aqua blade condensed in his hand.

“Bastard, you’re courting your own doom!”

Murderous intent filled the eyes of the old man as soon as he saw Wang Xian condensing an aqua blade at his will, striking at him with a similar movement. His hands accelerated.

“The speed of a Ninja is considered to be top-notch at the international level. One must not be careless when battling with a Ninja. This young man is just too insolent.”

“Must be disciples from some clans or forces. Kinda stupid!”

The surrounding crowd watched with a teasing look.

Another five young men and ladies in unique attire walked out of the room. With one look, anyone could tell that they were the natives from Dubai.

The five of them revealed a faint smile as they watched the scene unfolding before them.

Bam!

As soon as the long blade formed by water hit against the samurai sword, the aqua blade broke in half. There was a sneer in that old man’s eyes. “Let me cut your abdomen up!”

Shoo!

Just when the voice of the old man trailed off, the broken piece of the aqua blade pointed at the old man directly.

“What?”

That old man was stunned as he raised his samurai sword for a block.

Pow!

Yet, his hands were numbed immediately. To his horror, he realized his arms were wrapped by the water current.

Poof!

During that brief stunned moment, the aqua blade pierced the old man’s body.

Wang Xian exhibited a trace of ridicule as he raised his arm, hurling numerous tangible aqua blades at the remaining three Japanese.

Poof!

“How dare people like you vie for that Token of Authority?”

Wang Xian tossed that token in the air with a scornful look on his face.

Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam!

Four bodies fell to the ground.

“What great strength!”

“That... That old Japanese man is an Inborn Expert. He actually got killed within a stroke!”

“Our bad. None of us expected that young man to be an Inborn Expert!”

“Hehe, they finally met their match this time. They succeeded with the previous trio, but now, Team Liuchuan has met their end here!”

Everyone around them was appalled as they stared at Wang Xian with surprise.

A young man who killed one Inborn Expert and three Half-step to Inborn Experts caught them by a real surprise.

“It seems like the crowd was not too impressed by this. Indeed, there’s a clear gap between the Underworld and the international arena!”

Wang Xian observed the reactions around him and arched his eyebrows as he prepared to head for the Fire Spirit Island.

“Buddy, hold on!” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

At this time, a sudden voice was heard.

Wang Xian paused and spun around when he saw five young people walking towards him.

Wang Xian checked them out and asked, “Anything for me?”

“Are you from Korea?”

The young man in the center fixed his eyes on Wang Xian as he asked him with a beaming face.

“No, I’m from China!” Wang Xian raised his eyebrow. “What’s up?”

“Sorry, I didn’t expect such a talented young man to be coming from the Underworld of China!”

That young man apologized immediately with an apologetic hand gesture. However, his eyes were filled with more surprise.

“Bro, are you alone? Don’t get us wrong. We just want to head to the Fire God’s Graveyard with you.”

That young man reached out with an inviting gesture.

“I’m alone, but I intended to go in myself!”

Wang Xian shook his head at them before he turned around and walked away.

The five of them frowned slightly while the young man at the center hesitated. He called out again, “Bro, I think we can talk for a few minutes. I’m sure you won’t be disappointed. Just a few minutes will do!”

Wang Xian paused as he whirled around and faced the five people.

“This way, please!”

Seeing Wang Xian look back, that young man quickly pointed to a room.

With slight hesitation, Wang Xian looked at the building, which he had bought his token from just now. Apparently, these five young people had some backings.

“Sure!”

He nodded and followed them. The only reason that they invited him over must have been for the Fire God’s Graveyard.

Even Wang Xian had to stay cautious when it came to the Fire God’s Graveyard. After all, to be known as a God in the international arena must have required one to possess a greater strength than him.

Wang Xian was slightly far from being a God-like being.

The dangers lurking in the Fire God’s Graveyard could inflict him with severe injuries.

He followed the five people to a room that looked extravagant.

“Speak up, people, I want to know what you can come up with for me to join you guys!” said Wang Xian to them with a smile.

Out of the five of them, there was a girl who had a veil over her face. Only her beautiful, pink eyes, which looked a little queer, could be seen.

“We have a general map of the Fire God’s Graveyard. We can provide you with some weapons. All in all, it’s much safer to go with us than by yourself. The chance of getting treasures is much higher too!”

That young man in the center continued to add on.

Wang Xian lifted his eyebrow a little as he scanned the five of them briefly. “Honestly, all of you are somehow...weak?”

All of them halted. There was a twisted expression on the face of that young man. “All of us are at Inborn levels, and we have powerful weapons with us. Five of us can manage even a Half-Step to Dan Realm Expert!”

“With your participation, we have ways to explode our strength to Half-Step to Dan Realm level!”

“Oh? Since all of you are so compelling, you guys can just kill me after that. I will be doomed if I follow you people!” said Wang Xian impassively as he looked at them.

“Don’t worry. We can swear a blood oath, and take some cursed beetles. If we defied our oaths, we would die immediately. What do you think?” asked the young man to Wang Xian, staring at him.

“Sure, but it’s up to individual strength after we enter!” Wang Xian chuckled as he answered.

“Sure!” The five of them nodded without any comments.

“Great, when are we setting off?” asked Wang Xian immediately.

“In the wee hours of tonight. We’ll enter at the coldest time, when the Fire Demon at Fire God’s Graveyard is deep in sleep!” answered the young man.

“Sure, we’ll meet tonight over here. I’ll take a stroll nearby.”

Wang Xian smiled and nodded as he headed outside.

“Elder brother, this guy is super arrogant. He thinks he’s good, but I don’t feel he’s reliable at all. Let’s drop the idea of going there!”

The girl with a veil pleaded with the young man at the center as soon as Wang Xian departed.

“He’s not weak. Sigh, and we don’t have other choices. Inborn Experts with water attributes have their own forces. After we lost a Dan Realm expert, we almost wanted to give up. But now, we should give it a shot. If we can find the Holy Water Scripture and Holy Water, all these things will have been worth it!”

“Brother, I still think we shouldn’t go,” the girl pleaded.

“For your sake, I must find the Holy Water!”
