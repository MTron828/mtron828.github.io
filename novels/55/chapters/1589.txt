Chapter 1590: 1590 dyed the sky red

“What? It actually withstood the attack of the defensive formation!”

Outside the city wall, when everyone saw the water energy palm within a five kilometer radius dissipate, their faces revealed an embarrassed expression.

“Don’t be afraid, our imperial city’s defensive formation, unless the profound void tier 9 makes a move, otherwise, it will not break!”

The Ice Heart King looked at the two light and dark divine dragons with a gloomy expression.

The three old men stood on the city wall expressionlessly as they watched coldly

“Rumble!”

The light and dark divine dragons that carried a huge amount of water energy crashed directly into the formation, and a rumbling sound like thunder resounded.

The entire imperial city seemed to tremble.

“HMPH!”

The three old ancestors looked at the spot where the light and dark divine dragons crashed and snorted coldly.

Although the formation was trembling, there were no cracks at all. With the powerful impact force, it was impossible to break the defensive formation.

“Sky Demon, if you still can’t break it, we will go back to sleep!”

Bing jinghuan stared at Wang Xian outside with a ferocious look and said mockingly.

“Haha!”

When the crowd heard Bing Jinghuan’s words and saw that there were no cracks in the formation, they laughed out loud.

“Soon, all of you will be able to rest in peace!”

Wang Xian’s gaze swept across Bing Jinghuan. A hint of a smile and a hint of fury appeared on his face.

“Next, prepare to die!”

“Light and Darkness Ablation!”

Wang Xian let out a wild roar and waved his arm. A wave of light energy landed on the Divine Dragon of light.

Roar! Roar

The Light and darkness instantly lost their balance. The power of the Divine Dragon of light was slightly stronger than that of the Divine Dragon of darkness.

Only a sliver of power broke through the Divine Dragon of Light and darkness.

The two powers began to corrode at a terrifying speed.

The two divine dragons of light and darkness intertwined together, and the corrosive power landed on the defensive formation of the Iceheart Imperial City.

How terrifying was the power of the corrosive power of Light and darkness?

The Soul of darkness entered a person’s body. If one wanted to clear the soul of darkness, one had to find a powerful radiant priest to expel it.

This was because, in the process of expelling the soul of darkness, the corrosion of Light and darkness could instantly kill a person.

The power of the corrosion caused by the two extreme energies could erupt with a destructive power that was even more terrifying than that of a single elemental energy.

This energy was like the destructive power of the five elements that countered each other.

“Zi Zi Zi!”

An ear-piercing sound suddenly rang out. The power of the corrosion of Light and darkness landed on the defensive formation and instantly corroded it.

In front of this destructive power, a small crack slowly appeared on the array formation!

“Oh no, he actually sacrificed those two level 8 profound void realm energy creatures to break the array formation!”

When a crack appeared, everyone from the Ice Heart Empire revealed terrified expressions.

“Attack, stop him!”

The white-bearded old man standing in the middle had a drastic change in expression. He waved his arm, and an azure-colored staff appeared in his hand.

He pointed the staff forward and a water pillar that was a thousand meters long was formed instantly. It charged towards the light and dark divine dragons.

“Use your strength to fight against strength!”

Wang Xian waved his arm and caused the two light and dark divine dragons to maintain the balance between light and dark.

The water pillar that was ten meters thick charged towards the light and dark divine dragons like a torrent that had opened a floodgate.

This force of impact could turn an ordinary insightful void martial artist into a pool of blood.

Boom! Boom! Boom

However, this terrifying force was instead directly transferred to the array formation of the Ice Heart Empire.

The cracks on the array hair were even bigger!

“Not good!”

The white-bearded elder’s expression changed drastically when he saw this scene.

“Prepare for battle!”

He hurriedly raised the staff in his hand and roared loudly.

“What? The array formation is about to be broken? How is this possible? wasn’t it just...”

“Oh my God, not good. The Sky Demon is about to charge in!”

“Don’t be afraid. We three patriarchs are fighting against two opponents. We will definitely win!”

On the city wall, everyone’s expression changed instantly. Their previously calm and even arrogant expressions were filled with fear.

“Break for me!” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Wang Xian roared and the light-dark divine dragon melted rapidly.

The corrosive power caused a huge hole in the formation.

Following that, the sound of the formation breaking could be heard. The formation was slowly disappearing.

“Kill!”

Wang Xian revealed a ghastly expression. He raised his Dragon Claw and activated the Dragon Kingdom in his palm instantly.

“Keke Keke, the slaughter has begun!”

The hunchbacked old man took a deep look at Wang Xian and let out a shrill cry. Demonic Shadows appeared around him one after another.

The demonic shadows appeared one after another. In just two seconds, there were over ten thousand of them.

Each of the demonic shadows exuded a sinister and terrifying aura.

The hunchbacked old man also brought out his true strength.

He was extremely dedicated to destroying the bingxin empire.

He wanted to perform well so that Wang Xian could help him get rid of the dark soul in his body.

“Let’s fight! Let’s fight! All voidhole realm experts, Attack!”

The instant the formation was broken, Bing FA Wu’s expression changed drastically.

They had witnessed the strength of the Sky Demon and the hunchbacked old man. It was definitely not something that the three patriarchs could withstand.

Only by using all the experts in the entire bingxin imperial city would there be hope.

“No one is allowed to retreat. The Bingxin Empire is in a life-and-death situation. Anyone who disobeys will be killed without mercy!”

The heart of the king of Bingxin was beating violently as well. He hurriedly ordered loudly.

“Yes, Kill!”

At this moment, everyone on the city wall felt their hearts sink when they saw Wang Xian and the hunchbacked old man charging over.

Especially when they heard the orders from the Patriarchs and the king, their expressions became even more awkward.

To ask everyone above the void interpretation realm to make a move, it was obvious that the three patriarchs were unable to stop the other party.

“Roar Roar, the slaughter has begun!”

Wang Xian raised his head and roared.

“Dragon head under the Heavens!”

“Dragon Body of ten thousand miles!”

“Kill!”

In an instant, Wang Xian released his strongest strength.

A terrifying divine dragon that was more than ten kilometers long appeared in front of the Ice Heart Imperial City in an instant.

The Divine Dragon exuded a terrifying demonic aura. It opened its mouth and spat out a mouthful of dragon flames. It attacked the city directly.

“Go!”

“Go!”

The three patriarchs looked at each other with a determined killing intent in their eyes.

Boom

The three of them waved their arms. A tsunami-like sound was heard as they attacked the dragon flames that Wang Xian spat out.

“The consequence of provoking our boss devil will be the destruction of... The Nation!”

In the sky, over 10,000 stooped old men spat out a line of words in unison.

Following that, over 10,000 figures flew towards the inner part of the royal city of Bingxin.

“Damn it, stop him!”

The white-bearded Patriarch’s expression changed drastically when he saw the hunchbacked old man charging towards him. He moved his body and was about to go up to meet them.

“The three of you, stay here!”

“Devil scale chains, darkness!”

Wang Xian waved his dragon claw. Terrifying chains extended out from the Abyss and blocked the white-bearded patriarch directly.

At the same time, the dark energy in the light and darkness enveloped the surroundings.

“B * stard, how dare you fight three against one? Kill him as soon as possible and then kill the other one!”

When the long-haired elder saw that Wang Xian wanted to trap the three of them here, he roared furiously.

“Quick, kill him as soon as possible!”
