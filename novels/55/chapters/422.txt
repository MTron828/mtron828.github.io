Chapter 423: Arrival Of the Dragon (1)

She knew exactly what it meant to advance to Inborn Realm at the age of fifteen.

All the more, she knew what would happen to this fifteen-year-old Inborn Expert if he was in Xiao Clan.

At present, her son was a Half-step to Inborn Expert at age eighteen, and he was already receiving the attention of the entire clan. He was almost selected to be the next Clan Leader of Xiao Clan.

He was receiving personal attention and guidance from Laozu.

The entire Sacred Clan was respectful to a woman like her while her son also received firm support from many elders.

Her son’s talent had already received so much attention...what would happen if it was a fifteen-year-old Inborn Expert?

She was almost certain that the entire Xiao Clan would be shaken, and most probably, Xiao Ran would be tagging behind Laozu in the future.

All of these were valid possibilities.

As an Inborn Expert at the age of fifteen, it was too frightening. Not only would it shake the entire Underworld, but the whole world would also be shocked.

His potential was unlimited as he almost had an 80 percent chance to advance to Laozu realm.

The fact was simply too scary.

Besides, when that mull returned to Xiao Clan, he would definitely expose the truth that she had ordered the assassination to kill the three of them, including his mother.

By then, the choice between an Inborn Expert or Half-step to Inborn was clear to Xiao Clan. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

After all, she would receive a sanction from the clan, and her son would also be implicated.

That struck terror into her.

“They’ll be reaching Xiao Clan tonight. We must not let them through.”

The malevolent expression slowly disappeared from that skinny old man’s face. “Now, we need to exterminate Miracle Doctor Wang and that mull. Otherwise, the consequences...”

“They must be killed!”

An old man darkened his expression as he bellowed in a low voice with a twisted expression.

“Yes, we must kill them. Kill them all!”

The wealthy-looking lady panicked as she said, “If they entered Xiao Clan, Fan’er would be finished. So would I.”

“Calm down. Now we need to think of ways to kill both of them!”

The old man screamed at the wealthy-looking lady with a sullen look.

“Dad, we can just kill them on their way. Just do it on their way and stop them from entering Xiao Clan!”

The wealthy-looking lady nodded and suggested this to her father.

“Intercept and kill them!”

Radiance flashed in the old man’s eyes as he squinted slightly. “Call upon all the Inborn Experts from the family here and intercept Miracle Doctor Wang and that mull. Kill them off before they reach their destination!”

“Family Head, I’m afraid Liang Family’s strength is not enough to kill that lad,” the skinny old man remarked slowly with icy cold gazes.

“Hur?” The old man stared hard at the skinny old man. “We have six Inborns in Shang Jing. Can’t we even kill two people?”

“Family Head, that Miracle Doctor Wang of Rivertown is really domineering. I guess he has already advanced to Half-Step to Dan Realm. That mull possesses Heavenly Flame and an Inborn Spiritual Weapon. Six Inborns are definitely not enough. Not even with another two additions!”

Sss...

The old man drew cold breath as soon as he heard the skinny old man. The wealthy-looking lady was stunned for a moment as panic flashed in her eyes, “Then...then what should we do?”

“Think of a way. A fool-proof plan!”

The skinny old man bit his teeth with traces of blood were seen on his gums. That made him look like a devil!

The wealthy-looking lady had a mixed expression. Her fair complexion and beauty seemed ferocious when her eyes were gleaming.

“I have an idea!”

She bit her teeth as though she had made a grave decision.

“What is it?”

That old man quickly turned to his daughter and asked in a deep voice.

“Today’s Fan’er’s 18th birthday. We’re having a huge celebration in Xiao Clan. If they dare to turn up later on, I’ll get an elder from Xiao Clan who is on good terms with us to stop them. Once conflict arises, we’ll strike without giving them the chance to speak!” said the wealthy-looking lady with malevolence.

“This is a little risky, but...”

His eyes glittered as the old man nodded his head slowly. “At that time, I’ll get all the experts from Liang Family. Once they enter, we’ll just attack them, so they have no chance to speak! By then, the experts from Xiao Clan will strike too!”

When Xiao Clan struck, it would be an easy job to exterminate Miracle Doctor Wang. Even though both of them were imba, they would be suppressed.

“Xiao Mei, I’ll leave this to you. You must make it work. Otherwise, you’ll implicate the entire Liang Family!” the old man continued with consternation.

“Don’t worry, Dad. I’ll take care of this!”

The wealthy-looking lady squinted her eyes and revealed a faint smile like any vicious person.

“Xiao Clan is located in Xiao Mountain, one of the three Sacred Mountains in Shang Jing!”

When the plane landed in Shang Jing, Wang Xian brought Xiao Ran and the rest out of the airport. They looked in the direction of Xiao Clan, with Mo Qinglong and the remaining Dragonians behind them.

“It’s five now. Let’s have our dinner and go over there at night. Darkness marks the best time for revenge!” said Wang Xian to Xiao Ran with a beaming face.

“Anything you say, Master!”

Xiao Ran nodded with anxiety at this moment.

They had not stepped into this city for more than a year, which also meant they had been on the run for the same amount of time.

He did not feel the slightest warmth in this place, only coldness!

They found a place and had dinner. Subsequently, they headed for the Sacred Mountain, where Xiao Clan was located.

Xiao Clan was one of the three Sacred Clans, including Sui Clan in Shang Jing. Hence, the territory they occupied was on par with Sui Clan.

Unlike the Siheyuan at the 2nd Ring Road, Xiao Clan was located on the 4th Ring Road.

Xiao Clan’s residence was a huge mansion that used to be a royal residence in ancient times. The entire mansion was huge, with hundreds of rooms.

Behind the mansion sat a mountain–the Sacred Mountain of Xiao Clan.

The sun set relatively early during winter. It was about six, and the sky was in total darkness.

However, it was lively in the Welcome Banquet Block of Xiao’s Mansion.

Lanterns were hung around the vintage buildings. As they lit up the entire Xiao Clan, it was as though it was a time travel back to ancient times.

“Happy Birthday, Xiao Fan!”

“Happy Birthday, Xiao Fan. You’re finally an adult today!”

“Haha, here. Our genius in Xiao Clan. Take a look at the present that I brought you!”

More than three hundred guests were gathered in the Welcome Banquet Block at this moment. All of them were the core disciples of Xiao Clan and Liang Family.

A juvenile in blue-colored Xiao’s uniform was standing in Welcome Banquet Block with a proud-looking face as he accepted the presents from his elders.

Six Inborn Experts from Xiao Clan and six Inborn Experts from Liang Family were all celebrating a birthday for him.

Who else could achieve such an honor?

Immense confidence surged within Xiao Fan!

“Xiao’s Mansion. We’re here!”

At this time, four figures showed up at the entrance.

But more figures were hiding in the dark, waiting for their commands!
