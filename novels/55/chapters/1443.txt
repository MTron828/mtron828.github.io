Chapter 1444: 1444 was three-legged

“This... this... little brother Wang Xian, what have you done?”

Sect Master Ling of the Heavenly Sword sect was stunned when he heard the Blood Emperor’s furious voice coming from the Imperial City of blood flow.

“Blood flow empire is so arrogant. Naturally, we can’t just leave like this. Of course, we have to take some interest and kill their crown prince!”

Wang Xian smiled and said to sect leader Ling.

“What?”

Sect leader Ling widened his eyes and shook his head slowly. “Thank you, brother Wang Xian, for today. If it weren’t for the presence of a powerhouse at level six of the Seethrough Void Tier, we would be in trouble!”

“You don’t have to be so polite. After all, you guys are now allies with the Dragon and Phoenix Empire!”

He shook his head.

“This time, the four of us have completely offended the blood flow empire. In the future, we will be enemies. We need to talk about the next few things!”

Sect leader Ling’s eyes flickered as he spoke. The two of them flew towards the Light Dragon Empire.

This matter had exceeded the expectations of the four of them.

Originally, they only wanted to have a say and not let others treat them as chess pieces. They did not expect the blood flow empire to directly kill them.

Now that they had fallen out with the blood flow empire, they could only form an alliance to the end, and they had to form a deeper alliance.

Only then could they deal with the blood flow empire’s next revenge.

The two quickly flew towards the Light Dragon Empire’s location.

Halfway there, they met Feng Luan and the others.

“Lord Wang, sect leader Ling is here. This time, we have to discuss how to deal with the Blood Flow Empire!”

Sect leader Yi and the king of the Radiant Dragon Kingdom said with some bitterness.

They didn’t expect things to turn out this way.

“Alright, with the four of US joining forces, we can completely contend with the blood flow empire!”

Sect leader Ling nodded.

After arriving at the Radiant Dragon Empire, Feng Luan and sect leader Yi, the king of the Radiant Dragon Kingdom, discussed the matter of forming an alliance.

Wang Xian did not participate. He found long Xiaotian and strolled around the Light Dragon King City together.

Two days later, news that shook the entire Liuhai region spread out.

The Dragon-phoenix dynasty, Heaven Sword Sect, Blood Stream sect, and Light Dragon Dynasty formed the Liuhuang Alliance. It was an alliance formed by four top forces.

Furthermore, there were more than ten forces that joined the Liuhuang Alliance.

These dozen or so forces were all affiliated forces of the Light Dragon Dynasty, the Sky Sword sect, and the blood stream sect.

As top-tier forces in the past, they also had affiliated forces. Although there weren’t many, there were more than a dozen of them in total.

And they weren’t weak either.

The moment this news was released, it shook the entire Liuhai region.

This was a colossus that might be comparable to the blood stream empire.

However, three days later, another piece of news that shook the entire Liuhai region came.

The Demon Beast Clan had already decided to establish the Demon Beast Empire.

Furthermore, the Demon Beast clan had decided to sign a peace treaty with humans to live and develop together.

In a week’s time, the Demon Beast Empire establishment ceremony would be held.

At that time, all the factions in the Liuhai region would be invited to attend the ceremony.

When this news came out, it shocked everyone even more.

The appearance of this news also made all the factions think about why the Bloodflow Empire dared to directly go against the dragon-phoenix Empire’s Sky Sword sect three days ago.

It was probably because they had already obtained the Demon Beast tribe and wanted to sign a peace treaty with the humans.

Otherwise, they wouldn’t have directly started an internal conflict during this period of time!

The establishment of the Demon Beast Empire, the establishment of the Flowing Emperor Alliance, and the former flowing sea region’s emperor’s blood flow region.

In an instant, the entire flowing sea region was divided into three top-tier powers.

From then on, three powers stood together!

The strength of the Demon Beast Imperial clan might be the strongest, followed by the Flowing Blood Empire.

However, the Flowing Emperor Alliance couldn’t be underestimated.

Three days ago, the level 6 insightful void realm expert who was emitting black and white energy and hadn’t shown himself had easily killed the crown prince in front of the flowing blood palace.

This assassination technique made everyone extremely fearful.

Even the blood flow empire was extremely fearful when faced with an expert who was hidden in the void and ready to launch a fatal attack at any time.

“In the following flowing sea region, it might create a three-legged situation!”

The kings and sect masters of some dynasties muttered. It might be chaos or peace, but it was hard to say.

...

“Chief executives, how is the situation with the Demon Beast Clan?”

At this moment, in the Imperial Palace of the bloodshed empire.

Ever since the incident three days ago, the entire bloodshed imperial city had been on high alert.

But even so, everyone was on tenterhooks.

In a side room in the main hall of the imperial palace, the Blood Emperor and the three emperors were sitting inside. When they saw the three old men walking in, they immediately stood up.

They looked over with somewhat embarrassed expressions.

“Haha, everyone, the Demon Beast Clan has been settled. In a week’s time at the Demon Beast Dynasty’s grand ceremony, they will sign a peace treaty with the blood flow dynasty. In the future, there will definitely not be a war between the two sides!”

The old man from the life and Death Pill Workshop said with a face full of laughter.

“Then on the side of the Flowing Emperor Alliance...”

An emperor hurriedly asked with a frown.

“They signed a peace treaty with you, but it doesn’t include the other party. When the time comes...”

The Old Man of the holy item forging workshop stroked his beard and smiled with his eyes slightly narrowed.

“They are willing to take action!”

A bright light appeared in the Blood Emperor’s eyes.

“We paid a price, so of course they are willing!”

The two old men of the life and Death Pill Workshop and the holy item forging workshop smiled and nodded. They glanced at them and said, “This time, there should be no mistakes!” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“No mistakes. As long as they dare to make a move, there will be no mistakes!”

“When the time comes, all the treasures of the so-called Liuhuang Alliance will be 80% yours and 20% ours!”

The blood emperor gritted his teeth and said firmly.

“Alright!”

The three elders laughed out loud.

Seven days later, the so-called Liuhuang Alliance would become a joke and a lamb waiting to be slaughtered!

“Wang Xian, Ling Xiaoyun, and that powerhouse at level six of the Void interpretation stage, just you wait!”

The Blood Emperor and the three emperors looked at each other. Their eyes were filled with endless coldness.

When they learned that the flowing emperor alliance had been established, they wanted nothing more than to destroy it.

However, when they thought of that terrifying assassin powerhouse, they held it in!

Once they made a move, that assassin powerhouse would cause the entire flowing emperor dynasty to fall into panic.

Before they had absolute power, they couldn’t make a move.

However, it was extremely difficult to have absolute power. There was only one way... ...

Unite with the Demon Beast Clan!

“Blood flow Emperor Alliance, I want to use the blood of billions of you to pay tribute to my son. I want to throw all of your flesh and blood to those beasts of the Demon Beast Clan!”

“I want you to be crushed to pieces. Seven days later, I’ll see you in the human-demon graveyard!”

“There can only be one emperor in the flowing sea region!”

The blood emperor stood there and laughed sinisterly.

He waved his arm, and cups of immortal nectar flew directly into everyone’s hands.

“Haha!”

The seven people raised their wine cups and laughed loudly.
