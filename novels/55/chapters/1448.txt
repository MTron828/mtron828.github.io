Chapter 1449: The Strongest 1449 was the emperor

“What does the blood emperor and the king of the wildlands mean? A bloody ceremony? A Carnival?”

“Why do I have a bad premonition? What’s going on? How did this happen?”

The expressions of the tens of millions of people around them changed drastically when they heard these threatening words.

All the factions finally couldn’t take it anymore.

A bloody ceremony!

A carnival!

What could it be?

A bad premonition lingered in everyone’s heart.

Some people even turned pale.

“Boom!”

At this moment, the expressions of everyone from the flowing Emperor Alliance changed drastically. Feng Luan, sect leader Ling, and the rest stood up directly.

“The emperor of the wildlands, Blood Emperor, what do you mean by this?”

Sect leader Ling shouted at the two with an icy expression. His eyes were filled with fury and shock.

“There are still two minutes left. Hehe, if you want to join our flowing blood empire, immediately come to the back of our empire’s experts!”

The Blood Emperor ignored sect leader Ling and slightly narrowed his eyes. His gaze swept over the tens of millions of people as he said coldly.

“This...”

“Gulp!”

“Our icy heart dynasty is willing to join the blood flow dynasty!”

“Our Sky Wind mercenary group is also willing to join the blood flow dynasty!”

“We are also willing to join, we are also willing to join!”

At this moment, the expressions of all the experts from the neutral forces changed. They all hurriedly flew behind the experts from the blood flow dynasty.

They shouted loudly.

Even some of the powerful mercenary groups also shouted loudly that they wanted to join the blood flow empire.

Tens of millions of people instantly moved, all wanting to move behind the experts from the blood flow empire.

They could be said to have completely understood that there might be a bloody battle coming up.

And the enemies might be the humans other than the blood flow empire.

Especially the people from the Flowing Emperor Alliance.

“There’s still one minute left. Now, if there are still people who want to join our blood flow empire, there’s still a chance. Otherwise, Hehe...”

The Blood Emperor watched as almost all the humans came to the back of their empire, and he stared at everyone from the Flowing Emperor Alliance with a smile on his face.

Other than the four forces of the dragon-phoenix Empire, the Flowing Emperor Alliance also had more than a dozen dynasty sects.

It was obvious that his last sentence was directed at those dynasties and sects. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Gulp, dragon-phoenix Queen, sect leader Ling, we... We...”

Behind them, the kings and sect leaders of the dynasties had cold sweat on their foreheads.

They looked at the tens of millions of people who had arrived behind the flowing Emperor Alliance and gulped, their hearts trembling.

The scene in front of them was that the blood flow empire wanted to join forces with the Barbaric Empire to destroy their flowing Emperor Alliance!

They could still resist one, but against two, they had no way to resist at all.

“I... I have to think of the people of our empire. Our Wind Soul Empire wants to withdraw from the alliance. I’m sorry, Sect Leader Ling. We’re not their opponent at all!”

Suddenly, in the center of the Flowing Emperor Alliance, the King of the Wind Soul Dynasty flew into the sky with a face full of fear. He spoke to sect leader Ling, Feng Luan, and the others, leading five or six insightful emptiness realm experts.

“Respected blood emperor, we are willing to join the blood flow dynasty. We hope that you will agree!”

The king of the Wind Soul Dynasty begged the blood emperor with a face full of respect.

“Haha, Yes, Yes. We can turn back now. I will pardon you all for your sins!”

“All of you who join our blood flow empire in one minute will be absolved of your sins!”

The blood emperor laughed and said.

“Hiss, the Dirty Royal Alliance is completely finished!”

“Someone actually left the alliance. Just when everyone thought it would be a three-pronged situation, this kind of situation actually happened!”

When everyone saw the Wind Soul Empire leaving the alliance and joining the blood flow empire, everyone’s expression changed slightly as they discussed in low voices.

However, at this moment, the ones with the most embarrassed expressions were Feng Luan, sect leader Ling, and the others.

“King of the Light Dragon Empire, please forgive me for not being able to follow you!”

Within the Flowing Emperor Alliance, another dynasty King stood out and flew towards the blood flow empire.

This caused the hearts of everyone in the Flowing Emperor Alliance to turn cold once again.

At this moment, they couldn’t stop it. If they did, then their alliance would become even more fragile.

“Sect leader Yi, please forgive us for not being able to follow you. I have to think about the disciples of the entire Golden Mountain sect!”

One after another, three factions left the Drifting Emperor Alliance.

The other factions were also hesitant. Some left, while others gritted their teeth and stood there resolutely.

“They’re too stupid. Why aren’t they leaving? !”

“That’s right. Leaving is the wisest choice. No one will mock them!”

“In the future, the flowing ocean region will be under the rule of the desolate dynasty and the blood flow dynasty. There are still a few foolish factions that won’t leave the Flowing Emperor Alliance!”

In a dozen seconds, half of the factions left, leaving only six.

From then on, there were only around 1200 to 300 people in the Flowing Emperor Alliance.

Compared to the tens of millions of people in the blood flow empire and the hundreds of thousands of demonic beasts, they were completely isolated.

Some people looked at some of the factions that were still standing in the LIUHUANG alliance with slight disdain.

This was a group of people who didn’t know how to appreciate favors.

Even some of the factions that had left the Liuhuang alliance shook their heads.

A wise man submits to circumstances. All of you are simply courting death!

Feng Luan, sect leader Ling, sect leader Wang Yi of the Guanglong kingdom and the rest stood there with gloomy expressions. They looked at Wang Xian, who was calm and composed, and pursed their lips.

It was a dead end now. If they didn’t see Wang Xian’s carefree expression, they might have already collapsed!

When the blood emperor and the blood flow empire saw this scene, their faces were filled with smiles.

“Roar! Roar!”

A minute had passed, and a roar came from the mouth of the Emperor of the wildlands.

Everyone hurriedly looked over, and the blood emperor’s face was filled with smiles.

Next, some people were going to die!

“Our Demon Beast Empire, the Wildlands Empire, has been established. Next, we will hold a grand ceremony of the Empire!”

“I, the Emperor of the wildlands, issue an order!”

The emperor of the wildlands stood in front of the dragon throne. His arms were spread open, and his face was filled with excitement, filled with a domineering aura.

He swept his gaze across all the Demon Beast races.

“Obey my emperor’s orders!”

On the surrounding sculptures, the leaders of the Demon Beast races immediately prostrated themselves on the sculptures and responded loudly.

“Obey my emperor’s orders!”

Below, all the Demon Beast races knelt on the ground and roared loudly.

“Wait, get ready to attack!”

In front of the bloody flow empire, three emperors stood up slowly with smiles on their faces. Their weapons appeared in their hands.

They were here!

The surrounding tens of millions of people held their breaths. They knew that the battle was about to begin.

The flowing Emperor Alliance was about to be massacred!

At the Flowing Emperor Alliance’s position, everyone’s faces were filled with cold sweat as they held their weapons nervously.

“Next, let’s watch a good show!”

At this moment, Wang Xian revealed a smile on his face. His faint voice entered everyone’s ears.

“In the Demon Beast Empire, the strongest is the emperor. Leader of the Blood Barbarians, you guys haven’t asked if our colorful algae tribe has agreed to it!”

Suddenly, a cold voice resounded across the sky!
