Chapter 953: Expelling 0954

It had a huge body, a pitch-black body, and an earthen yellow belly.

The crocodile’s attribute was earth. When its huge body struck the ground, it was absolutely terrifying.

“Roar Roar!”

However, this extraordinary level 5 crocodile slowly lost its life force under everyone’s attacks.

“Put the crocodile away. Its thick skin can create a lot of inner armor!”

After killing the crocodile, the leader of the mercenary group kept it into his interspatial ring.

Wang Xian scanned through the mercenary groups. Among these mercenary groups, the ones in Donghai City and the ones in Shenghai town each accounted for about half of them.

In comparison, the mercenary groups in Donghai City were obviously much stronger than those in Shenghai town.

As they continued forward, death appeared. This time, everyone was even more cautious.

“Caw Caw!”

“Caw Caw!”

After traveling for about two hours, everyone was watching their surroundings with tensed minds.

Suddenly, loud noises came from the sky.

Everyone’s expression changed slightly as they hurriedly looked towards the sky.

“It’s rotten crows, it’s Rotten Crows!”

“Damn it, we actually encountered these greedy things!”

“There’s a total of more than 200 of them. Unless we kill them, they’ll always follow us!”

The experienced mercenary group’s expression instantly turned ugly.

Rotten Crows liked to devour corrosive creatures. Of course, living creatures were also their targets.

In the Blackwater Swamp, there were some places where there was a black-toothed fish. Under normal circumstances, they would feed on the black-toothed fish.

However, once the rotten crows encountered humans, they would constantly follow them and wait for an opportunity to make a move.

They would only give up when they were full!

“Oh no, there are more than 200 rotten crows. Their appetite is very big. If we want to feed them, we will need a lot of food!”

Father Zhou’s face was slightly embarrassed as he stared at the Rotten Crows in the sky with a grave expression!

“Stop the carriage. All the people in charge of the Chamber of Commerce, come over!”

A voice came from the center. Father Zhou did not hesitate and walked towards the center.

There were a total of twenty chambers of commerce. All the people in charge came to the center.

“This is troublesome. These damned carrion crows will cause all the chambers of commerce to lose a lot of spirit stones!”

Zhou Han and Jin Liuyan got off the carriage. They frowned as they looked at the Carrion crows circling in the sky.

“What should we do if we encounter such Carrion Crows?”

Wang Xian frowned as he looked at the carrion crows with their rotting bodies and blood-red eyes. A hint of disgust flashed across his eyes!

“There are more than a hundred carrion crows at transcendence level five. If we were to engage in a battle, the mercenary groups here would suffer heavy losses. Usually, there is only one way to deal with these carrion crows. Ask each chamber of commerce to take out their corpses and feed them. Once they are full, they can last for two days. Two days is enough for us to leave this place!”

Zhou Hanhan said to Wang Xian.

“Oh!”

Wang Xian nodded his head. He suddenly felt that he didn’t know much about the supernatural continent. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

It seemed that entering the demon Hunter Academy this time was the right choice!

“What? You want me to take out 30% of the corpses of ferocious beasts? Why do you want me to take out so many corpses of ferocious beasts?”

Suddenly, an angry voice was heard.

Zhou Hanhan’s expression changed when she heard this voice. She quickly turned her head and looked over.

“Just take it out when I tell you to. Without us, how can a small chamber of commerce like yours travel to and from Shenghai Town?”

A resounding and forceful voice was heard. An old man stared coldly at Zhou Hanhan’s father.

“How Dare You Bully My Father!”

When Zhou Hanhan saw this scene, her small face turned red instantly. She ran over angrily.

Jin Liuyan’s expression changed slightly as well. She quickly chased after her.

Wang Xian hesitated for a moment before following her.

“We formed a team of 20 chambers of commerce. We didn’t take any less money. Why do you want me to take out 30% of the corpses of ferocious beasts now?”

“You guys are going too far!”

Just as he walked over, he saw Father Zhou glaring at the two old men in front of him angrily.

“Your Zhou Chamber of Commerce obtained 100,000 fierce beast corpses from the mayor of Saint Sea Town this time. It’s a great harvest. Of course, you have to pay more!”

The two old men looked at Father Zhou indifferently and said coldly.

“What? They got the fierce beasts from the mayor’s Mansion?”

“No way! In the past, it was the Green Vine Chamber of Commerce and the Xiao Chamber of Commerce who got the bigger resources. I didn’t expect that this Zhou Chamber of Commerce, which I’ve never heard of before, actually got so many fierce beast corpses!”

“I heard that the Zhou Chamber of Commerce has only been established for a short period of time, and they were able to obtain hundreds of thousands of corpses of fierce beasts when they were transported to East Sea City!”

The words of the elder of the Xiao Chamber of Commerce instantly caused the eyes of the surrounding people to turn red.

“Little Zhou, young people do business. If you want to expand your business, you have to make some concessions. Since you’ve obtained so much this time, so what if you take out some fierce beasts? Right?”

“Right, right. I think the Zhou Chamber of Commerce can earn quite a lot even if they feed this group of Rotten Crows!”

“Ai, Brother Zhou, since you have earned so much this time, I think you should take out some. It’s not much for you, right?”

The people in charge of the Chamber of Commerce hurriedly said.

Envy and jealousy flashed in their eyes.

A trip of several hundred thousand spirit stones was also a huge income for their chamber of Commerce.

But not every chamber of Commerce was as powerful as the Ivy Chamber of Commerce and the Xiao Chamber of Commerce.

Their annual profit was at most several hundred thousand spirit stones. If they were in danger, they might even lose money!

“You guys...”

Father Zhou saw that everyone’s gazes were all fixed on him, and his expression instantly became unsightly.

If he were to take out thirty percent of the Rotten Crow’s meat, it would be worth at least tens of thousands of middle-grade spirit stones.

Originally, each person would only get a few thousand, but now that he was asked to take out all of it, how could he feel good?

And the surrounding chambers of commerce were clearly bullying him.

But he had no choice but to glare at them angrily.

“Why are you asking us to take so much? You’re bullying us, aren’t you? We won’t take it, we’ll split it equally!”

Seeing her father’s humiliated look, Zhou Hanhan pointed at them and said angrily.

“That’s right. Why should we pay thirty percent? It’s because the profit is better than yours. Humph, you’re simply bullying us!”

Jin Liuyan also said angrily.

“Excluding the money of the mercenary group, the profit of our group is only about a hundred thousand middle-grade spirit stones. You’ve earned a few hundred thousand and are coming with us. This is equivalent to our mercenary group protecting you. Naturally, you’ll have more!”

Before the members of the Green Vine Chamber of Commerce and the Xiao Chamber of Commerce could speak, a middle-aged man said irrationally.

“What kind of nonsense is this? You blame us for having less income, you blame us for having more income than you, and you want us to pay more? Don’t even think about it!”

Zhou Hanhan was so angry that her body was trembling, and she shouted loudly.

“It’s not like you guys have to pay all of it!”

“That’s right, it’s not a big loss for you!”
