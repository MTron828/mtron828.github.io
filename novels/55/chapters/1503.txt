Chapter 1504: 1504

He Yuan’s birthday banquet continued. Tens of thousands of young people congratulated him once again.

At the same time, he Yuan announced the selection of members for the establishment of the army.

In the next few days, 100 of the most outstanding young people would be selected to enter he Yuan’s army.

Each young man would have a beast pet of the profound void tier.

In comparison, the most enviable person this time was Lone Wood Dazhuang.

He had become the most popular person by young master he Yuan’s side in a single leap. It could be said that he had soared into the sky. Everyone in Nanling City had to be respectful to him when they saw him.

Wang Xian’s appearance had also shocked many people.

Especially he feng, who had easily defeated a dragon among men. He had given he yuan a ferocious beast cub with a level seven bloodline of the insightful void tier.

When this news spread out, it shocked the entire he clan’s forest. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Everyone was filled with curiosity and surprise towards this young man named Wang Xian.

The entire he clan’s forest was discussing the matter between Wang Xian and he yuan.

“Eh? Brother Wang Xian, are you here to look for someone in the vast region? That Miss Ling Jian ‘er?”

On the second day, in a house on the He clan’s holy tree, he yuan looked at Wang Xian in astonishment.

In the room, Lin Yaoyao and he suiqing were also looking at him with sparkling eyes.

“Yes!”

Wang Xian nodded his head slowly.

“Brother Wang Xian, what’s going on between you and Miss Ling Jian ‘er?”

He Yuan looked at him curiously and asked.

“It’s a long story!”

Wang Xian shook his head bitterly.

“Alright, brother Wang Xian, do you have a portrait of Miss Ling Jian ‘er? I’ll tell my father to use the He clan’s power to search for her!”

He Yuan nodded. Seeing his expression, he did not ask any further.

“I’ll have to trouble the He clan. As long as you have all the information about her, tell me everything!”

Wang Xian said to him.

“Alright, don’t worry, brother. Although our he clan is not the strongest in the vast region, the information we have is pretty good. We will definitely do our best!”

As he yuan spoke, he patted his shoulder. “You don’t have to be too sad. I will bring you around the He clan’s forest for the next few days!”

“The scenery and places of our he clan’s forest can not be compared to the human-demon graveyard!”

“Okay!”

Wang Xian nodded his head faintly.

In the next few days, he yuan, he suiqing, and the rest accompanied Wang Xian around the He clan’s forest.

As for the He clan, under the orders of the clan leader, they mobilized all the forces of the He clan to look for Ling Jian ‘ER.

Wang Xian waited quietly for the news every day.

The vast area was too vast. Looking for a person was like looking for a needle in a haystack.

However, with the He clan around, he could still find some information.

Wang Xian lived in a separate courtyard. In the middle, he feng came to apologize.

Ten days later, the first news of Ling Jian ‘ER came. Someone had seen Ling Jian ‘er, but this was more than two months ago.

This was a piece of useless news.

In the next few days, more and more news came, but there was no practical information.

Soon, twenty days passed, and Wang Xian gradually became anxious.

During this period of time, Wang Xian also learned that the He clan was ranked in the top three in terms of information in the vast region.

Even if it was a super force, they didn’t dare to say that they were better than the He clan in terms of information.

It was also because of this that he gradually became a little anxious.

Twenty days later, he stayed in the courtyard every day and sculpted one sculpture after another to ease his mood.

In just a few days, he had sculpted tens of thousands of different sculptures.

Among them, more than half of them were sculptures of Ling Jian ‘ER.

An inexplicable worry would surge into Wang Xian’s heart from time to time, causing him to feel unsettled.

This was the first time since Wang Xian was born that he had such an emotion.

“Brother Wang Xian!”

On the first day of a month later, the selection of members of He Yuan’s army had already been completed.

He Yuan, he Sui Qing, Lin Yaoyao, and Dui Dazhuang rushed over with some worries.

Dui Dazhuang could be considered to have soared to the sky.

According to Dui Dazhuang, his fiancée went to look for him the next day and knelt down to him.

Wang Xian found it hilarious that DUI dazhuang looked so wretched back then.

However, Dui Dazhuang, who had been laughing all this while, had a serious expression on his face today.

The four of them walked in and looked at Wang Xian, who was carving a statue. They walked over with a frown.

“There’s News!”

Wang Xian raised his head and looked at them expressionlessly.

“This!”

He Yuan pursed his lips and said, “There’s a piece of news that came from five days ago. I didn’t bring it to you at that time. Our He clan is looking for Miss Ling Jian ‘ER’s next whereabouts, but... There’s no news!”

As he spoke, he walked slowly to Wang Xian and placed the information in front of him.

Wang Xian looked at the information and had a bad premonition. A terrifying glow shot out from his eyes.

The Dragon Eyes of light and dark fire activated automatically. He looked through the information quietly.

“Eh?”

He Yuan and the others who were standing at the side felt the terrifying aura from Wang Xian. They were slightly shocked and couldn’t help but take a step back.

“Young master Wang Xian, you don’t have to worry. Miss Ling Jian ‘ER is blessed by the heavens. She will be fine!”

He suiqing consoled him softly.

“Huff!”

Wang Xian slowly closed his eyes and exhaled. His body trembled slightly.

News of the He clan. A month ago, Ling Jian ‘er appeared in ancient demon city and was hunted down by some people in ancient demon city!

The news ended here.

When the He clan received the news, they immediately conducted a detailed investigation.

Due to the uniqueness of ancient demon city, they did not find any news.

“Brother He Yuan, please give me some information about the ancient demon city!”

Wang Xian opened his eyes expressionlessly and said to he yuan.

“Here!”

He Yuan was obviously prepared. He handed over a document and said, “Brother Wang Xian, this ancient demon city is a very special region in the vast region!”

“The people living in it are all extremely vicious sinners or some cultivators who have committed heinous crimes.”.

“The ancient city of demons is very strong. There are seven Great Devils at level seven of the Seethrough realm. They are working together, and even some first-rate forces do not dare to provoke them!”

“There are more than a million people in the city. The weakest among them is at level seven or eight of the extraordinary realm. Even the super forces are unwilling to provoke this group of lunatics. They are afraid that they will not be exterminated, and they will seek revenge. These people are very cruel!”

He Yuan introduced the city to Wang Xian.

The ancient demon city was a city built by a group of desperate people. Under normal circumstances, no one was willing to offend them.

“Okay!”

Wang Xian responded with a soft “Okay”and looked at all the information about the ancient demon city quietly.

“Brother Wang Xian, don’t worry. Perhaps Miss Ling Jian ‘ER is fine!”

He Yuan comforted Wang Xian softly when he saw his condition.

However, Wang Xian didn’t say anything. He just sat there expressionlessly.

Dui Dazhuang, he suiqing, Lin Yaoyao, and the rest consoled him for a while, but they still didn’t receive any reply.

The few of them also knew that this was a piece of news that caused some despair. They could also understand Wang Xian’s feelings.

However, none of them noticed that Wang Xian’s eyes had slowly turned black!
