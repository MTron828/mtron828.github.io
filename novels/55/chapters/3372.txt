3373 2272 enemies in the void

Powerful Wind and thunder birds!

Terrifying enemies that could teleport!

Furthermore, these enemies that could teleport were numerous and densely packed.

Who were they?

Was there such a race in the universe?

This made Wang Xian think of an lie and the strange demonic altar.

As well as… The strange space that an lie went to to increase his strength back then!

In the universe, there were nine elements: metal, wood, water, fire, Earth, wind, thunder, light, and darkness. These nine elements had evolved into the present universe.

But he had never heard of space.

In his opinion, to teleport and teleport, one had to be a universe overlord to have it.

But now, it seemed that this wasn’t the case.

There were more than one strange existence like lie an.

“That’s not right. They don’t seem to be as strange as an lie. An Lie’s teleportation is faster and easier than theirs.”

“But even so, the ability of those humans and demonic beasts can also be called teleportation.”

Wang Xian mumbled. The scene in his mind just now shocked him greatly.

Even in the Divine Dragon’s inheritance, there was no record of such an ability.

Forget it. I’ll know when I’m strong enough. From the scene just now, the Tempest Bird might have died. Now that the inoriginator holy wings have completely fused with me, I’ve also obtained an ability

Wang Xian shook his head and mumbled to himself.

Void pursuit was an ability that he had obtained. This ability originated from the Tempest Bird. It was an extremely powerful ability.

By attaching the power of wind and thunder onto the enemy’s body, the enemy would be able to find him no matter where he was hiding.

Moreover, there was another very powerful effect, which was the locking effect.

As long as one locked onto the enemy with the power of void, one’s attack would be able to directly track the enemy.

Of course, there was a flaw in this. Only the power of wind and thunder could automatically track the enemy.

However, even so, this was already very strong in his eyes.

Buzz

Wang Xian’s body trembled. His entire body was completely covered by nine attributes.

These nine attributes emitted various colors of light that surrounded his entire body. It also made Wang Xian’s aura even more powerful.

I’m still a little lacking. The other eight attributes have been improving along with me. In terms of quality, they are stronger than the Lightning attribute. My Lightning attribute is still a little lacking

Wang Xian sensed his body. Five elements, yin-yang, wind and thunder. The nine attributes were divided into three camps. Among the wind and thunder, the energy of the Lightning attribute was slightly weaker.

The energy in his body had yet to reach a balance.

“The Thunder attribute needs to be increased a little. After reaching a balance, my nine attributes can increase my offensive power by another level.”

“In other words, I have to fight across seven levels!”

Wang Xian revealed a smile. Fighting across seven levels? By then, he would have the combat strength of a peak universe knight.

This time, it wouldn’t take long.

“Now, I need to improve my thunder power!”

Wang Xian muttered to himself. His body trembled. The silver-white metal covered all eight attributes, leaving only one thunder attribute.

He felt the energy in his body. It was comparable to a powerful being who had just stepped into the seventh level of a universe knight. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

When he could instantly kill a universe knight with the combat strength of a seventh level, it would be the time when he could fight against a peak universe knight.

Furthermore, it wasn’t just a simple fight. He should be able to kill an ordinary peak universe knight instantly.

“This is perfect. I can go to the Thunder Light Race to upgrade my thunder power.”

Wang Xian mumbled and called an lie over. He asked him to bring him back to the Thunder light race.

“An lie, this is for you!”

After coming to the Thunder light race, he hesitated for a moment and gave him the ancient oil lamp that he had been carrying.

The energy in the oil lamp was enough to withstand a strike from a level one master of the universe.

If there was any more, it wouldn’t work.

It was useless for Wang Xian to take it now. Furthermore, his strength was improving very quickly. Without sufficient energy, the oil lamp wouldn’t be of much use to him.

“HMM? Thank you, Dragon King!”

“With this defense, I can try to continue improving my strength!”

An lie held the oil lamp and his eyes were filled with excitement.

“Be careful. The space you went to is a little strange. When you return, report to me about the situation!”

Wang Xian reminded him.

“Yes!”

An lie nodded excitedly and bowed. His figure disappeared in an instant.

Looking at an Lie’s disappearing figure, Wang Xian’s eyes flickered slightly.

I wonder if the space that an lie went to is the heaven-splitting primordial land?

Or, is it somewhere else?

Returning to the palace, Wang Xian took a look at his surroundings. His figure moved and he immediately walked out.

The place where his palace was located was a blessed land. The cultivation speed of thunder-type cultivators could be increased by dozens of times.

However, Wang Xian did not cultivate here. He was prepared to go to other places. He wanted to go to other thunderclouds and bathe in the lightning to cultivate.

Or perhaps he could hunt some desolate beasts of the lightning attribute and absorb the lightning energy in their bodies.

Wang Xian’s body moved and flew towards the bottom of the mountain peak of the palace.

The first elder gave him a piece of information. It contained information about this thundercloud domain.

There were fewer desolate beasts around the lightning race. The lightning energy was also more gentle.

The direction of Sky Thunder City was gentler.

Behind the Thunder race, there were some violent thunder domains controlled by the Thunder race.

Further away was an area not controlled by the Thunder race. There were desolate beasts living there, and there was violent power of thunder.

Disciples below universe knights were forbidden to go there, and it was extremely dangerous.

Even disciples above universe knights had to be careful.

Although the disciples of the Thunder Light race were good at speed, the desolate beasts in the thunder clouds were better at speed.

If they were ambushed by desolate beasts stronger than them, they could be killed instantly. They couldn’t even escape back to their god country.

Therefore, the great beings of the Thunder light race didn’t recommend their disciples to go there.

Of course, risks and benefits coexisted. One could obtain some acquired lightning spiritual treasures or even acquired supreme treasures there.

There were even quite a number of cultivation treasures.

The other eight attributes in Wang Xian’s body were concealed. There was no need for him to reveal his full strength this time.

As long as he was careful to expose himself during times of crisis, he would be fine. At other times, he would use this strength to train and improve himself.

When he arrived at the bottom, there was a teleportation formation that could directly reach the edge of the formation.

Wang Xian entered the teleportation formation and immediately disappeared.

The next moment, he appeared in a square. Beside him, there were experts from the Lightning race guarding this area.

When they saw Wang Xian coming out of the formation, the six experts guarding this area glanced at him with curiosity in their eyes.

“Be careful when you cultivate in the depths. Don’t Lose Your Life!”

A middle-aged man reminded him kindly.
