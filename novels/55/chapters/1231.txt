“Ling Jian ‘er found out about this at the first moment. Do you know what she did?”

“She directly killed her brother and his wife!”

“A son that was highly valued by the entire sect and doted on by the sect Master of the Heavenly Sword sect was killed by his own daughter. Although it was their fault, it still made the Heavenly Sword sect extremely furious!”

“Two of his wives died, and his son was killed by his daughter. I heard that the sect master of the Heavenly Sword sect vomited blood on the spot and directly expelled Ling Jian ‘er from the heavenly sword sect. He even announced that he would no longer have anything to do with her in the future!”

“After the announcement, the sect master of the Heavenly Sword sect went into closed-door cultivation in anger and did not see anyone. He has been in closed-door cultivation for an entire five years now!”

“Ling Jian ‘ER was expelled from the Heavenly Sword sect. The Heavenly Sword sect is also filled with helplessness towards this matter!”

“However, regardless of whether it is the others or the disciples of the Heavenly Sword sect, they all know that Ling Jian ‘er is the only daughter of the sect master. Furthermore, Ling Jian ‘ER, who has been expelled, has displayed extraordinary talent.”

“No matter how great the hatred is, it is still no match for blood relations. No one knows if the sect master of the Heavenly Sword sect will take her back. Therefore, Ling Jian ‘ER is in a rather special place in the tomb of the demi-human!”

“No one dares to provoke her, not even the people from the bloodshed empire. After all, this is the last bloodline of the sect master of the Heaven Sword sect. There is no guarantee that she will be harmed. It will drive the sect master of the Heaven Sword Sect, who has already lost all his family members, Crazy!”

Long Xiaotian slowly told Wang Xian about Ling Jian ‘ER.

“I didn’t expect her to have such a miserable past. What a pitiful girl!”

Wang Xian was slightly taken aback as he shook his head lightly. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Brother Wang Xian, if you pity her, you can have a deep conversation with her. Haha, Maybe One day when her father comes to look for her, you will become the son-in-law of the Heaven’s sword sect!”

Long Xiaotian joked with him.

Wang Xian shook his head slightly and said with a smile, “Her looks are average and she is cold. No man likes her!”

Long Xiaotian gave him a thumbs up when he heard his words. Then, he scanned his surroundings.

“If I can have all the items you have here, I will definitely be able to build an invincible battle team!”

He looked at all the items around him with some envy.

“Give me 800 billion middle-grade spirit stones. I will give you everything!”

Wang Xian said to him indifferently.

“PFFT!”

Long Xiaotian almost vomited blood when he heard his words. “800 billion middle-grade spirit stones. Even Our Guanglong dynasty’s annual income doesn’t even amount to 800 billion. I don’t even have 80 billion now!”

“The main reason I asked you to come here this time is to ask you to help me advertise. I want to get rid of the items here as soon as possible!”

Wang Xian smiled when he heard his words. “As a reward, you can get something that you like from here!”

“Leave the publicity to me. As for the reward, you are too polite. You have helped me a lot today!”

Long Xiaotian shook his head with a smile.

“Brother, you can give it to me if you don’t want it. I want that Little Yan Monkey!”

At this moment, he had just finished his sentence when long Luo grabbed his arm and said hurriedly.

“Why would a child want a Little Yan Monkey? Refine your pills properly!”

Long Xiaotian glared at her and rubbed her head fiercely.

“You...”

“Alright, I’ll give you a Yan monkey later!”

Wang Xian saw Long Luo’s angry look and said with a smile.

“Hehe, brother Wang is still the best. HMPH, some people are not good at their job at all. Return me my brother!”

Long Luo revealed an excited look. She quickly grabbed Wang Xian’s arm and glared at Long Xiaotian with a mocking look.

“Brother Wang Xian, how can this be...”

Wang Xian waved his hand at him. Looking at his expression, he knew that long Xiaotian might have a request for him. He smiled and said, “It’s alright. If you have anything, just tell me directly. I will definitely help you if I can. You’re welcome!”

“This... I Won’t hide it from you. Brother Wang Xian, there really is something!”

Long Xiaotian rubbed his hands in embarrassment.

After all, he didn’t come here to help Wang Xian much. On the contrary, he had a huge matter that required Wang Xian’s help.

“The matter of the Mount?”

Wang Xian looked at him and guessed.

“That’s right, that’s right. It’s the matter of the mount. Brother Wang Xian, do you think... can you help...”

“I’m a little short on money recently. I need...”

“Sure. This is a small matter. You can look for me after you find the ferocious beast. Forget about the spirit stones. It’s a piece of cake!”

Wang Xian interrupted him and agreed immediately.

“Haha, Thank You, Brother Wang Xian. It’s my greatest fortune to know you!”

Long Xiaotian was so excited that his face turned slightly red when he heard his words. He quickly said.

How could he not be excited!

He had more than 200 subordinates now. If all of them had mounts that were above transcendent level seven.

That would be a terrifying cavalry battle team.

In fact, with Wang Xian’s help during the next year’s assessment, he might be able to build a battle team that was not weaker than the most elite of the Guanglong dynasty.

By then, the position of crown prince would be within his grasp!

The other princes were not qualified to compete with him at all.

Wang Xian smiled nonchalantly. After chatting with him for a while, he came downstairs and sat up, waiting for customers to arrive.

“He is even more terrifying than we expected!”

Walking out of the Dragon and Phoenix grocery store, the old man beside Long Xiaotian said with a sigh.

Bai Qingshan nodded in agreement. “His background is definitely not simple. To be able to bring out so many precious treasures and to be proficient in beast taming techniques, the second Prince’s throne is within reach!”

“That’s right. With brother Wang Xian’s help, the throne is within reach!”

Long Xiaotian’s heart was filled with fighting spirit. For the first time, he felt that the throne was within reach!

“Looks like I have to help promote brother Wang Xian’s shop!”

Long Xiaotian mumbled.

...

“Boss, what do you sell here?”

Not long after long Xiaotian and the rest left, five middle-aged men walked into Wang Xian’s shop curiously.

They looked at the spirit purple qilin and the blood evil turtle lying on both sides with fear in their eyes.

“Other than elixirs and spiritual herbs, we have everything else. Come in and take a look!”

Wang Xian looked at them and said with a smile.

“Alright!”

The five middle-aged men walked in. They were only here out of curiosity. After witnessing the battle just now, they were itching to come in and take a look.

Seeing how easy-going Wang Xian was, they heaved a sigh of relief and walked in.

“Oh my God, there are so many weapons, armor, and complete sets of equipment!”

“Look over there, look, ferocious beasts and demonic beast cubs. Are these for sale as well?”

“What is that? What is that? The half-step void interpretation ferocious beast bloodline? How is that possible? Oh My God!”

However, very soon, the exclamations of the five of them spread throughout the shop.
