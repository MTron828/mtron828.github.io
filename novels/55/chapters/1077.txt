Translator: 5496903

Wang Xian’s cold voice rang out. His eyes were filled with killing intent as he stared at Hai Wen

The long sword in the hand of a golden swordfish not far away shook slightly.

“Whoosh!”

When Wang Xian finished his sentence, a golden swordfish attacked him directly.

“Stop!”

Wang Xian actually dared to let his subordinate kill him. His expression changed drastically. The old man from the Ocean Academy also changed drastically. He shook the long sword in his hand and stood directly in front of the Golden Swordfish.

“Stop!”

He shouted again and looked at Wang Xian with an extremely embarrassed expression. “Student Wang, it’s not good to kill someone before we have a detailed understanding of the matter.”

“Then let him tell us how these four people died. Since I’m the commander of this mission, I have to be responsible for everyone!”

Wang Xian pointed at the corpse on the ground with a cold expression and looked at Hai Wen.

“The one who died was a member of our Ocean Academy and a student of the East Ocean Academy. We will settle this matter!”

The old man from the Ocean Academy said with an embarrassed expression.

“You will settle it?”

Wang Xian looked at him with a cold smile on his face. he shouted softly, “Everyone, come here!”

Everyone, come here!

Wang Xian’s voice instantly spread to the ears of everyone around him. Those who didn’t know what was going on had astonished expressions on their faces.

“Let’s go over!”

“Commander Wang is calling us over. I don’t know what’s Going On!”

“Let’s Go!”

With an order, everyone rushed over.

“What are you doing?”

Hai Wen’s expression changed when he saw Wang Xian calling everyone over. He stared at Wang Xian and shouted in a low voice.

“Tell me what happened just now!”

Wang Xian stared at him expressionlessly.

“What did I say? What does their death have to do with me? It’s because they are too weak!”

Hai Wen gritted his teeth and glared at Wang Xian as he shouted loudly.

“As the captain, you asked your team members to cover you to pick the green vine fruit. Do you think it has anything to do with you?”

“I said, report immediately if you encounter any demonic beasts. Why didn’t you report it?”

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes and said coldly.

“What’s Going On?”

“Someone’s dead! What’s going on?”

The group of people who had just arrived saw the corpse beside them and were astonished when they heard their words.

“Commander Wang, our oceanography school will settle this matter. We will handle it ourselves!”

The old man from oceanography school walked slowly to Hai Wen and stared at him with a solemn expression.

“We are not in your oceanography academy now. I am in charge of the mission now. A student from your oceanography academy has caused the death of four people due to his selfish desires. Your Oceanography Academy is the backup force of the Army of ocean cultivators and is managed in a regimental manner. I would like to ask, how do you resolve this situation?”

The corners of Wang Xian’s mouth curled up slightly as he spoke coldly.

“The situation seems to be that the captain of the team who is at transcendent level six has discovered the green vine fruit. However, there might be danger in that cave. In order to obtain the green vine fruit, he didn’t request for reinforcements. Instead, he ordered his subordinates to help him block the attack. In the end, four of them died!”

“This bastard sacrificed four of his comrades just to obtain the green vine fruit. This is a crime that deserves death. If he were to be placed in the ocean corps, he would be killed immediately!”

Some of the surrounding students and the experts from holy sea town looked at Hai Wen and whispered with disdain.

Only the students from ocean academy frowned as they watched this scene.

“How to resolve this is our ocean academy’s matter. We don’t need to trouble the king to command us!”

The old man from Ocean Academy said in a deep voice.

“People like this should be killed immediately!”

“That’s right. Just like Commander Wang said, we are not in your ocean academy now. We have to obey the rules outside. They should be killed!”

“Damn it, betraying your own teammates. People like this should be fed to fierce beasts!”

However, as soon as the old man finished speaking, a few middle-aged men around him said indignantly.

“All of You Shut Up!”

When Hai Wen heard the words of the people around him and everyone’s disdainful eyes, his face revealed an angry expression. He roared loudly with a ferocious expression.

“How arrogant. I really don’t know how Ocean Academy nurtured such a fellow!”

The president of Holy Sea Town’s employment association pointed at Hai Wen with an angry expression as he spoke.

“He’s here with us now. According to the rules, even if we don’t kill him, we have to cripple him!”

An expert at transcendent-level rank 7 echoed.

“Shut up, Old Geezer. There’s still the few of you. If you dare to kill me, I’ll see that you’re courting death!”

Hai Wen pointed at each and every one of them with a malevolent expression.

“HMPH, such a despicable and despicable person. You Won’t shed tears until you see the coffin!”

The hiring association’s President’s expression changed slightly, and he directly raised the staff in his hand.

“If any of you dare to touch me, your entire family will die!”

Hai Wen directly pushed aside the old man in front of him, and his gaze was cold and disdainful as he stared at the hiring association’s president.

“Forget it!”

At this moment, the long-bearded old man from the East Ocean Academy who was riding a bird and beast frowned and said faintly, “The ones who died were students from the East Ocean Academy and the Ocean Academy. We will settle this matter.”

As he spoke, he looked at Wang Xian.

“Hehe, I really want to know how powerful his background is. He actually protected him so much even after he caused the death of your students!”

Wang Xian smiled faintly and said.

The faces of the instructors of the two academies changed instantly when they heard this. The students of the East Ocean Academy and the Ocean Academy around them also had ugly expressions.

The ones who died were their classmates. They were killed by someone. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

However, the academy still had to protect the person who caused their deaths.

Instantly, everyone felt a sense of sympathy for the dead rabbit.

Some of the students stared at Hai Wen with anger in their eyes.

“My father is tsunami sky. If you have the guts, try touching a single strand of my hair!”

Hai Wen pointed at Wang Xian with an embarrassed expression and shouted arrogantly, “Just You Wait!”

Today, he was extremely furious. He was despised by everyone around him. It was all because of this fellow. He stared at Wang Xian with a hint of killing intent in his eyes.

“Tsunami Sky!”

When everyone around heard this name, they were slightly stunned. Then, they sucked in a breath of cold air.

Tsunami Sky was the commander of the Army of ocean cultivators, the general of star-moon kingdom, and a powerhouse at the insightful void tier.

“No wonder he dares to be so arrogant. No wonder even the instructors of ocean academy and East Ocean Academy have to protect him!”

Everyone had an embarrassed look on their faces.

When Wang Xian heard the words tsunami sky, he was also slightly stunned. After all, this was the son of a void interpretation expert, the leader of the Ocean Corps.

“The son of a top-notch expert. No wonder he dared to be so unbridled. He even dared to threaten me at this moment!”

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly and said faintly.

From the beginning, when he saw that deputy leader Meng of the Ocean Corps was very enthusiastic about Hai Wen, he felt that his identity was not simple.

However, he did not expect that he had such a huge background. He was the son of an insightful emptiness realm expert and a general.

“So what if I threaten you? HMPH!”

Hai Wen stared at Wang Xian with disdain and snorted coldly with a little malevolence!
