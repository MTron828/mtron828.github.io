Chapter 625: Massacre Of The Underworld (1)

“NO...”

A frenzied roar reverberated across, shaking the entire Earth.

A figure was charging towards Guan Shuqing and the rest at a terrifying speed.

“Shuqing!”

The incoming person was none other than Wang Xian. He had flown to Rivertown at an ultra-fast speed, but he was still late.

Fire shot out from his eyes as he stared at the chest of Guan Shuqing that had been pierced through. A cloud of terrifying killing intent surged in his heart as though a devil was going to break out of its shackles!

“Xiao Xian!”

“Xiao Xian!”

“Brother!”

“Dragon King!”

Upon seeing the sudden appearance of Wang Xian, Xiao Yu, Lan Qingyue, Adjaya, Sun Lingxiu, and Elder Fang, who had lost all hope, immediately cried out in happiness.

“Xiao Xian, save Shuqing now. Now!”

Lan Qingyue’s tears rolled down her cheeks immediately. The moment Wang Xian appeared, she could finally let down her toughness and cried out sadly.

“Brother, check out sister-in-law Shuqing. Quick!”

Upon seeing Wang Xian, Xiao Yu finally had someone to rely on as she cried loudly.

“She will be alright. She will be alright!”

With bloodshot eyes, Wang Xian hugged Guan Shuqing as he mumbled.

Seeing the Guan Shuqing’s chest had been pierced through, Wang Xian’s dragon energy rushed frantically into her body.

With an arm swing, he popped some Level 7 Spiritual Medicine into her mouth. Panic filled his face as he stared at Guan Shuqing. “You’ll be alright!”

Wang Xian was quivering slightly.

“Xiao Xian, you’re back. That’s great. I won’t die. I can reach Nirvana and be reborn again!”

Seeing Wang Xian’s return, Guan Shuqing squeezed out a smile as she whispered to him.

“No, rest assured. I will not let you die. Nobody can take you from me!”

Wang Xian touched the chest of Guan Shuqing, sensing her vitality vanishing within her body as she turned cold.

“Good to hear that. I don’t want to leave you yet. I just want to rest. Rest...”

As Guan Shuqing said this, she closed her eyes.

Wang Xian slowly shut his eyes as he sensed her weakening heartbeat. Dragon Energy continued to stream into her body frantically.

But that could hardly maintain her faltering heartbeat.

This struck coldness into Wang Xian.

“Dragon King, it’s the Dragon King. He’s back. Gosh!”

Just then, the surrounding crowd began exclaiming in surprise.

The crowd, including those Inborn Experts, were full of astonishment, with fear in their eyes the moment they saw Wang Xian hover over.

Reputation was all that mattered!

The terror that the Dragon King brought along with him was carved in their bones. Hence, the sudden appearance of the Dragon King struck horror on everyone’s faces.

Many Martial Artists involuntarily staggered back in trepidation. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“What’s there to be afraid of? So what if the Dragon King arrived? Even if another Dragon King arrived, they would die today!”

At this time, the leader of the Crimson Bug of Diabolism yelled, staring coldly at Wang Xian, with eyes that surged with killing intent!

“That’s right. So what if the Dragon King is here? He’s here for his death!”

“He’s just in time. Today we will witness the slaying of the dragon!”

All the Martial Artists had come to this realization after the leader of the Crimson Bug shouted.

They cast their gazes at the Dragon King, then back to the four elders.

With them around, so what if the Dragon King was here?

Even two Dragon Kings would die, let alone the one that was here.

On the Underworld forum, everyone was horrified to see the appearance of the Dragon King.

But soon, they relaxed again after seeing the oppressive four elders.

Given such a situation, even the Dragon King would not be able to turn the tables around. The four elders were simply too daunting.

“Dragon King, I did not expect you would be still alive!”

Upon seeing the sudden appearance of Wang Xian, Nie Wushuang and Emperor Qi revealed a surprised look.

They thought the Dragon King was dead. But it turned out otherwise.

If not for that Immortal from Yong Chang world saving them, they might have perished.

They did not expect that the Dragon King was such a lucky person!

“The Dragon King is tough!”

Emperor Qi stared coldly at Wang Xian and revealed a faint smile.

“Oh? This is that Dragon King?”

The four elders studied Wang Xian with curiosity.

“Hehe, a famous figure in the real world. Dragon King, lucky you’re not dead yet. Otherwise, we would be missing a talent in the real world. That would be a pity!”

Subsequently, the four elders chuckled and fixed their eyes on Wang Xian with ease. There was a taunting look in their eyes.

The unparalleled talent in the real world to them was just a slightly more powerful ant.

So what if his cultivation had advanced to Budding Realm? In terms of combat power, he was still far off.

“Not bad for a lad to reach this stage. Since he could also get his confidants to this stage, he must have obtained some scary legacy. Nice. Tell us about it, and we’ll give you a quick death!”

An elder beamed at Wang Xian as he spoke.

In his view, it was a surprising joy to see Wang Xian.

“Ss, how domineering. Nobody dared to speak to the Dragon King in the Underworld for very long!”

“The ones who dared to do so are now dead men. However, I’m afraid it will not be the same again!”

“They totally disregarded the Dragon King. However, the four god-like elders are fit to do so!”

Everyone was astonished by how the four elders spoke to Wang Xian in an overbearing manner.

It used to be the Dragon King era. But now, it was coming to an end!

“It’s great to have the Dragon King here, now that we can witness the dragon-slaying!”

Everyone switched into a different mood as they fixed their eyes fervently. It was the slaying of Dragon!

That arrogant yet invincible Dragon King!

Wang Xian overheard the conversation around him without any words. He lowered his head and wiped the blood from the corner of Guan Shuqing’s lips.

He stood up gently, carrying her body, looking at his sister.

He turned and looked at Lan Qingyue, Sun Lingxiu, Adjaya, and Elder Fang.

Wang Xian stretched out his hands and wiped their tears off their cheeks.

“I’m late!”

Wang Xian stared at the pale-looking girls with heartache. He took out elixir pills and fed them to them.

“No, Xiao Xian. You’re not late!”

Lan Qingyue’s eyes were red as she could not help but cry again.

“Glad that you’re here!”

Adjaya felt a load off her shoulders as she curved her lips, revealing a goddess-like smile.

“Over to you, Xiao Xian!”

Sun Lingxiu, as usual, believed in Wang Xian as she spoke to him.

Wang Xian smiled at them and spun around slowly. Instantly, his face became utterly cold!

As though the winter had come, with the devil descending upon Earth.

He swept his gaze across the bodies of the dragonians and Golden Swordfish with boiling murderous intent within him.
