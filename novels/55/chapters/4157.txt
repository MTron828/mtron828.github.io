Translator: 549690339

“Hiss, this? ?

Stunned, completely stunned!

The sudden battle on the stage made everyone stunned!

They looked at Tian Chi in shock and disbelief.

What did they see?

What did they see?

A youth from the Hidden Dragon and Phoenix Group, a youth who had trained for less than 100 million years, actually defeated the top 10 of the Heaven’s Pride Group, Liao Fei Yan.

And it was an instant kill.

Liao Feiyan was a pinnacle universe knight.

A Pinnacle Universe Knight, a top-tier Heaven’s pride in the six paths universe!

As for Mu Li Tianci, even though he was ranked at the top of the hidden dragon fledgling Phoenix Group, there was a huge gap between them.

The Pinnacle Young Man from the hidden dragon fledgling Phoenix Group was only at the Level 5 universe Knight.

Now, Mu Li Tian Ci actually killed Liao Fei Yan?

This? ?

“How is this possible? How is this possible? How Can Mu Li Tian Ci have such terrifying power, how long has he been training?”

“Killing Liao Fei Yan, the power he unleashed just now? At such a young age, with such power, is this real?”

“This can’t be real right? He must have used some treasure, this can’t be real

All the surrounding disciples were in an uproar!

They all felt unbelievable!

In the entire history of the six paths universe, no one at such a young age could possess such terrifying strength! This was completely heaven defying!

sister!

Liao Fei Yu looked at this scene and was in a daze. When he came back to his senses, he immediately flew towards Liao Fei Yan, his expression extremely ugly as he looked at the head that only had a sliver of hope left!

“This…

At the seat of Honor, at the Xuan Tu tribe, the expressions of the Liao clan’s elite disciples changed drastically when they saw this scene!

The scene in front of their eyes had exceeded everyone’s expectations!

The Hidden Dragon and young Phoenix Group’s youth had instantly killed the top ten disciples of the Heaven’s Pride Group.

Unbelievable!

Most importantly, Liao Feiyan was an elite disciple of their Xuan Tu tribe!

This was a slap to their black Earth tribe’s face!

“You… You’re courting death! ”

Liao Feiyu looked at his severely injured sister, his expression changed as he stared at Tianci and roared!

“I’m courting death? “Liao Feiyu, some time ago, you pestered my mother. Later on, your sister even scolded my mother and brought her to the arena to fight, causing her to be heavily injured. Now, you’re falsely accusing my mother of pestering you? “You even insulted my mother and me. ”

“For a vicious woman like your sister, this kind of outcome is still a light punishment. ”

“Despicable fellows like you have to pay the price. Why? Do you want to take revenge for your sister? Alright then, we’ll decide the victor in the arena. However, even if you don’t challenge me, I’ll challenge you. I’ll make you, a despicable and shameless fellow, pay the price! ”

Hearing Liao Feiyu’s words, Tianci stared at him with a cold expression.

Just now, Liao Feiyan had insulted him and his mother, causing Tianci’s heart to be filled with anger!

Now, looking at Liao Feiyu, his eyes were filled with killing intent!

“Come, if you are still a man, let’s have a decisive battle. ”

Tianci stared at Liao Feiyu and continued speaking!

Liao Feiyu’s expression changed drastically when he heard Tianci’s words.

He was stronger than his sister, but there was a limit to how strong he was.

Now that his sister was killed in an instant, it would be difficult for him to be Tianci’s opponent.

Once he was defeated, with Mu Litian’s strength, he would definitely be heavily injured!

“What? His sister was seriously injured, and we’re on the same level, so we don’t dare to fight. Hahaha, is this the chosen one of the Black Earth tribe? This must be the top ten disciples of the six paths universe’s chosen one. He doesn’t even dare to accept the challenge. He’s really a coward! ”

“A coward like you still dares to pester my mother, Useless Thing! ” Seeing that Liao Feiyu didn’t answer, Tianci sneered with a cold face!

His face was full of disdain.

Today, he had to make Liao Feiyu pay a terrible price!

Today, even if he didn’t fight, he still had to fight!

“Damn, he is forcing Liao Feiyu to accept the challenge!”

“Who asked Mu Litianci to be so young? Moreover, this time, he is avenging his mother. If Liao Feiyu doesn’t accept the challenge, it will be a huge embarrassment. ”

“How did Mu Litianci cultivate? How could he be so strong?”

“Now, Liao Feiyu can’t step down from the stage. This time, he has lost a lot of face. If he really pestered mu litianci’s mother, he would be even more shameless! ”

All the strong disciples of the surrounding tribes were shocked when they saw Tianci’s powerful appearance.

Who would have thought that today’s scene would happen!

Who would have thought that Mu Litianci would hide his strength.

“Mu Li Tian Ci, the dignity of our Xuan Earth tribe can not be challenged! ”

In the seat of Honor, a universe ruler of the Xuan Earth tribe frowned as he looked at Tian Ci and said coldly!

(‘I did not challenge the dignity of the Xuan Earth tribe. Brother Tu Jiang Tong and the others are all very good people. However, when a tribe is big, there will always be some scum and trash. The Xuan Earth tribe can investigate my mother’s matter. If it is because of my mother, then I am willing to punish her. However, if it is because of them, will the Xuan Earth tribe deal with them

Hearing the words of the universe ruler of the Black Earth tribe, Tianci looked over and calmly replied!

Neither servile nor overbearing!

Hearing his words, the universe ruler of the Black Earth tribe slightly raised his eyebrows. He was surprised by Tianci’s courage!

“Neither servile nor overbearing. He deliberately hid his strength and kept a low profile. Mu Li Tianci will definitely be a powerful warrior in the future! ” “Indeed. If it wasn’t for his mother, he wouldn’t have exposed his strength! ”

The experts of the surrounding large tribes looked at Mu Litianci, who stood proudly on the arena, and commented in a low voice!

“Our Xuan Earth tribe is not a tribe that uses force to oppress others. Since you have a grudge, let’s settle it on the arena. We Don’t care about life and death.”

Suddenly, an old man from the Black Earth tribe’s seat of Honor coldly watched everything and spoke!

His words caused Liao Feiyu’s pupils to slightly constrict! !

“Alright, many thanks to the lord of the Black Earth tribe for being fair! ”

When TIANCI heard this, his gaze focused as he cupped his hands and spoke loudly!

“Feiyu, bring your sister’s body over and prepare for battle. The grudge between the two of you shall be settled on this arena! ”

Another old man from the Black Earth tribe sat in front of the old man who had spoken!

Liao Feiyu’s expression was volatile. He immediately flew over while holding his sister’s head.

“Grandfather, I…”Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Liao Feiyu came before the old man. He opened his mouth and spoke.

“The prestige of the Black Earth tribe can not be provoked. Our Liao clan is not a little fellow who does not know death. Kill him! ”

The elder in front of him looked at him and transmitted his voice to him..
