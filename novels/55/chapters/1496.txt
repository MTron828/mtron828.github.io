Chapter 1497: The Dragon of 1,497 people

In the banquet venue, Wang Xian’s cold voice resounded in everyone’s ears.

The thousands of young men gathered around him. The envious expression on their faces froze as they stared at Wang Xian in disbelief.

He actually rejected.

He actually rejected.

He rejected the position of a corps leader and the benefits of He Suiqing’s promise.

He turned down the opportunity to rise to the top.

Everyone widened their eyes and stared at Wang Xian in disbelief.

Even he suiqing was stunned. He stared at Wang Xian with a slightly unsightly expression.

She didn’t understand why this young man would turn down the offer that she had promised such a high level of benefits to a young man.

This condition of hers was something that many young men could only wish for.

However, he rejected it just like that.

Was it because he had confidence in his own strength and was confident that he could become the commander of the army, or... ?

However, he didn’t think so. This was because as long as he informed he yuan, he would never have the chance to become the commander of the Army.

“This fellow!”

Lin Yaoyao, who was at the side, stared at Wang Xian with some annoyance.

This fellow. The last time he asked him to help him sculpt, he didn’t agree to it. Now, when the eldest daughter of the He Sui family bought his pet, he rejected it directly.

“Hey, why are you so unappreciative? You came here to join brother he Yuan’s army. You are so unethical and still want to join brother He Yuan’s army?”

Lin Yaoyao glared at Wang Xian and pouted her lips as she spoke to him.

Wang Xian looked at Lin Yaoyao and he suiqing who were a little angry and shook his head slowly.

“I didn’t come here to join the He Yuan army. This pet cub is a gift from me...”

“Haha, Miss He Suiqing, Sister Yaoyao, are you guys here early?”

Just as Wang Xian was about to explain to he suiqing and the rest, a loud laughter suddenly rang out. It attracted everyone’s attention and interrupted Wang Xian’s words.

The loud laughter was accompanied by a terrifying pressure. This was the pressure of a powerhouse at level three of the void interpretation stage.

When he suiqing, Lin Yaoyao, and the others heard this voice and the pressure, they looked in the direction of the Holy Tree in shock.

The group of over 20 people was led by a young man dressed in white with a dragon embroidered on his chest.

This was a green dragon that was well-known on the transcendental continent.

Two huge wings spread out, and it had a ferocious head and a huge mouth.

The belly was a little fat, and there was a long tail.

The entire clothing made the young man look even more domineering. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The young man was he feng.

He Feng, the other monstrous genius of the He clan. Although his talent was not that great, he had broken through to the second level of the profound void tier at the age of fifty and was ranked among the top geniuses in the vast region.

His current age was only fifty-three years old.

Because his appearance looked incomparably young, there was not much difference between him and a young man.

“He Feng’s strength?”

He Suiqing and Lin Yaoyao immediately turned around, and a trace of shock flashed across their eyes.

“Third level of the profound void tier, young master he Feng’s strength has actually broken through to the third level of the profound void tier. This... how is this possible? It has only been three years, but young master he Feng’s strength has actually broken through!”

A young man from the forest fairy clan stared in shock at He Feng who was flying over, exclaiming.

After reaching the insightful void realm, he was still able to raise a level in three years, it was simply heaven-defying.

The advancement above the insightful void realm was extremely difficult.

“What?”

“Young master he Feng’s strength has actually broken through, my God!”

“Broken through, he Feng’s strength has actually broken through, this... third level of the insightful void realm, young master he Feng, is completely a dragon among men!”

“Dragon among men, he feng is a dragon among men!”

When the surrounding youths heard the exclamation, they were shocked.

The dragon among men was a great title and honor for humans.

This title came from the Drakonid Empire.

In the Drakonid Empire, as long as a young man reached the 3rd rank of the profound void realm before the age of 55, he would be invited to join the DRAKONID Dragon Combat Division!

The Dragon Combat Division was established by the DRAKONID Empire according to the maturity of the dragon race.

The dragon race, when they were born to the age of 55, would normally grow and eat. Their bloodline power could allow them to reach the third level of the profound void tier.

And when humans could reach the third level of the profound void tier before the age of 55, they could completely be called the dragon among men!

This title represented great honor, strength, and talent.

Even in the Drakonid Empire, there weren’t many who could reach the third level of the profound void tier before the age of 55.

Now that he feng had become a dragon among men, how could it not be shocking?

In the He clan’s current generation, there were two people who had a chance of inheriting the position of clan leader. One was he yuan.

The other was he feng.

Now that he had become a dragon among men, the possibility of him inheriting the position of clan leader in the future was much greater.

It could be said that he yuan was a great competitor for the position of clan leader in the future.

“Young Master He Feng, did you... break through?”

He Suiqing’s eyes revealed a trace of seriousness as she asked he feng.

“I just broke through by luck!”

He Feng and a group of young disciples from the He clan flew over.

He Feng’s face revealed an arrogant expression as he spoke arrogantly.

“Congratulations, Congratulations!”

He suiqing squeezed out a trace of a smile as she congratulated.

He Feng could be considered a competitor of her fiancé he yuan. Now that he had broken through, it was a great pressure for he yuan.

“Today is both brother he Yuan’s birthday and the day of my breakthrough. It really is a double blessing!”

He Feng laughed out loud and said with a smile on his face.

His words were filled with pride and self-satisfaction. It had been a long time since a dragon among men had appeared in the entire Lin clan.

After becoming a dragon among men, he also had the qualifications to contend with his monstrous younger brother.

All the surrounding youths looked at He Feng in shock, their eyes filled with respect.

“Yi, what’s going on? Are there still people sparring here?”

He Feng appeared and instantly became the focal point of the entire arena. At this moment, a core disciple of the He clan beside him saw Gongsun Ning, whose chest was covered in blood and was emitting a faint bloody aura, and asked with a face full of curiosity.

“Yes, Young Master He Feng. I’m sparring with a youth, and my skills are inferior to his!”

Gongsun Ning said hurriedly.

“It’s not good to make a big fuss at our he yuan brother’s birthday party. However, we are very curious about the person who could defeat you, Gongsun Ning!”

He Bing said to Gongsun Ning with a face full of curiosity.

He was very familiar with Gongsun Ning and his strength was even stronger than his. He didn’t expect that there was actually a young man who could defeat him.

“It’s... It’s that young man!”

Gongsun Ning looked at Wang Xian with some embarrassment. He squeezed out a smile and said.

“It’s that annoying fellow!”

At this moment, Lin Yaoyao, who was standing at the side, also looked at Wang Xian and snorted coldly with a displeased expression.

He Feng looked over and was stunned when he saw Wang Xian. He narrowed his eyes slightly!
