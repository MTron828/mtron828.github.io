Chapter 1633: In the invincible stance of 1633

“What?”

Nangong Jianghe, who was charging towards Wang Xian and the rest, heard the words of the Patriarch of Wuji Empire and his face instantly sank.

Even with the strength of three people, they could only defend at most?

This...

The moment the sky demon appeared, he killed one of them. Now, he was fighting against three of them alone.

There were also two experts at level nine of the Seethrough Void who were fighting against the supreme sect leader and another patriarch of the southern royal family.

Their peak combat strength was completely on par!

“Wu Wu Wu!”

Right at this moment, Little Blue’s furious voice was heard.

“Boom Boom Boom!”

Following that, a terrifying collision sound was heard.

Southern Emperor Jianghe hurriedly looked in the direction where he flew over.

“Oh no!”

Looking over, his expression instantly darkened.

Just now, the two experts of the southern royal family were fighting against this space behemoth, leaving several thousand meters long wounds on its body.

Then, at the instant he got up, the enormous body of the behemoth directly crashed towards the direction of the 120,000-strong army below.

The ancestor of the southern royal family directly stabbed a large blade that was several thousand meters long into the body of the Behemoth.

However, the terrifying behemoth seemed to feel no pain as it continued to charge forward.

Its incomparably huge body immediately collided with the bodies of several hundred profound void martial experts.

In an instant, several dozen weak profound void martial experts directly turned into blood mist.

The bodies of several hundred others instantly became flat and lost their vitality.

The Blood Mist entered the body of the giant beast and was quickly absorbed. The wounds healed at a terrifying speed.

This scene caused another ancestor of the southern royal family to feel a wave of fear.

The recovery and vitality of this space beast was too terrifying.

He was alone. Even if the other party didn’t retaliate or Dodge, he would have to kill for a few minutes before he could kill it.

And this giant beast had killed dozens of his subordinates in an instant!

“Dragon Country in the palm!”

Wang Xian saw that their experts were working together to fight against him. There was no hint of fear on his face as he waved his dragon claws.

In an instant, the huge dragon claw clawed downwards.

He placed his target among the 120,000 soldiers below.

“How dare you get distracted when you are fighting with us? Fire is raging! Explode!”

Nanhuang Jianghe was furious when he saw Wang Xian ignoring the three of them and attacking downwards.

He waved his hand and a fireball expanded at a terrifying speed. It attacked Wang Xian.

“Abyss heaven-piercing spear!”

“Abyss heaven-piercing spear!”

Patriarch Dark Eye and the other patriarch unleashed a powerful single-target attack in a fit of rage.

Even though your skyfiend is very strong now, he is not strong enough to ignore us.

The three of them were filled with a monstrous killing intent.

“Yin-yang five elements alms bowl!”

Wang Xian growled and a tai chi alms bowl slowly appeared around him.

Around the Tai Chi Alms Bowl, five divine dragons of the five elements circled around it.

The Alms Bowl slowly draped over Wang Xian’s dragon body.

The entire alms bowl was like a cape.

The pressure was overbearing.

Placed on top of the dragon body, it gave off a sense of mystery and elegance.

“Powerhouses from the vast region, how dare you invade us? Die!”

The Yin-yang Five Elements Alms Bowl appeared. Wang Xian completely ignored the attacks of the three level nine void interpretation stage powerhouses in the sky. His dragon claws, which were a few kilometers in size, directly attacked the dozens of level eight void interpretation stage powerhouses below him.

“Oh no, the sky demon actually dares to divert his attention to deal with us!”

When the dozens of level eight void interpretation stage powerhouses saw the terrifying dragon claws, their faces revealed a look of fear.

They hurriedly dodged to the side.

“Roar!”

“Dragon Head World!”

Wang Xian opened his dragon mouth and activated his dharma idol once again.

Dragon head world!

In an instant, a dragon mouth that was three to four thousand meters in size shot out an invisible force of destruction.

A long river appeared directly on the battlefield.

“Buzz!”

“Ahhhh!”

Seven to eight powerhouses of the eighth level of the seeping void tier were covered by the long river of destruction. The Gray River passed through a distance of 20 kilometers.

The Gray River drew a dividing line across the entire battlefield.

However, what made everyone in the vast area even more fearful was that the river of 20 kilometers had drowned seven to eight thousand people.

These were seven to eight thousand top-notch experts in the vast area!

There was only a total of 120,000 troops, but seven to eight thousand of them were wiped out in an instant. It was definitely a huge loss.

“Sky Demon, you’re courting death!”

The two patriarchs of the Wuji Empire saw Wang Xian killing 7,000 to 8,000 experts in one move.

Most of the people who were killed were from the Wuji Empire.

This caused their eyes to turn red instantly.

One of the patriarchs of the Wuji Empire moved. He did not attack Wang Xian.

Since Wang Xian was killing their disciple, he had to return the favor.

“Yin-yang five elements alms bowl, Unravel!”

Wang Xian saw one of the patriarchs of the Wuji Empire flying toward the members of the Dragon Palace. There was a hint of coldness in his eyes.

His body trembled.

The Yin-yang five elements alms bowl on his body completely disintegrated.

The Yin-yang Five Elements Alms Bowl was formed by the five elements power in his body, the light and Darkness Heart.

The defense was almost invincible among the ninth level of the void interpretation stage.

When the yin-yang Five Elements Alms Bowl was unsealed, it immediately transformed into three divine dragons.

The Five Elements Divine Dragon, the Light Divine Dragon, and the Darkness Demonic Dragon.

Before Wang Xian had completely fused with the heart of Light and darkness, he had a Dharma Idol, the Abyss Demonic Dragon.

Due to the heart of darkness, he could summon a powerful demonic dragon.

After the light and darkness were completely fused, the Dharma Idol, the Abyss Demonic Dragon, disappeared.

However, the disappearance did not mean that Wang Xian could not use it.

On the contrary, he was even more powerful now.

The Yin-yang Five Elements Alms Bowl had transformed into three divine dragons. Each of them possessed the strength of a ninth-level void interpretation.

Even if they were only comparable to an expert like patriarch of dark patterns who had just entered the ninth-level void interpretation, they were still extremely terrifying!

However, after the Yin-yang five elements Alms Bowl transformed into a divine dragon, Wang Xian’s own strength would be reduced by a lot.

He could only match up to an ordinary ninth level void interpretation.

Even so, it was enough.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

The three divine dragons let out three wild roars and attacked the two patriarchs of Wuji Empire and Nangong Jianghe respectively.

“This...”

Seeing the three divine dragons that suddenly flew out from Wang Xian’s body, Patriarch Dark Eye and the other two had extremely ugly expressions on their faces.

In particular, the aura emitted by the three divine dragons was not weak at all.

“Illusory items, kill them as soon as possible!”

Patriarch Dark Eye stared at the three divine dragons with his black eyes. His body trembled and an incomparably huge demonic shadow held a sickle in his hand as he charged towards the divine dark dragon.

“Roar! Roar!”

The Divine Dark Dragon’s body rolled and bit the demonic shadow heavily.

“Crap!”

Another patriarch of Wuji Empire who wanted to kill the disciples of the Dragon Palace was entangled by the Light Dragon God.

After two collisions, his face turned ugly.

It would take him at least ten minutes or even half an hour to kill it.

“Dragon Body of ten thousand miles!”

“All the powerhouses in the vast area, take this!”

In the center of the area, a terrifying divine dragon was rampaging within a 10-kilometer radius.

Without the power of light and darkness of the five elements, a divine dragon could kill in all directions just by relying on its physical body!
