Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

The crowd from Rivertown behind Wang Xian looked on silently.

Although they knew the strength of the Dragon King, they were still slightly surprised to see the sudden appearance of Maniac Ji.

Wang Xian smiled and looked towards the Liu Family and the crowd behind them.

“The Liu Family targeted me and I’m only going to target them. However, if you choose to take action, I wouldn’t mind going on a killing spree!”

Wang Xian revealed a murderous look and looked at Liu Feiyun, who was on the stage. “Oh, Little Sword Celestial, who has inherited the will of the Sword Celestial. Let me see your true strength!”

Wang Xian spoke sarcastically. Behind him, a dragonian walked directly towards Liu Feiyun.

He had a young look and was younger than Liu Feiyun.

“Do you really think that this is your home ground and you can be so brazen?”

Seeing Wang Xian’s confident look that seemed to have treated him as prey, Liu Jingshan revealed a cold look.

He lifted the long sword in his hands slowly and spread a strong aura towards the surroundings.

Bam bam bam!

The cups and plates on the table rattled and made a loud sound. Members of the Lan Family quickly moved to the side in horror.

The crowd behind the Liu Family was hesitating.

Looking at the current situation, it was clear that the Liu Family was the passive side.

The strength of the fifty-odd people that surrounded them was unknown. They didn’t know how to make a decision nor did they dare to make a decision.

Feeling the strong aura from Old Liu, everyone’s attention turned to Maniac Ji.

As long as the battle between Inborn experts was decided, the victorious side would be clear.

“Maniac Ji, I would like to see how strong you really are. If you help him this time, you will be the arch-enemy of the Liu Family.”

Liu Jingshan pointed his longsword at Maniac Ji.

“Hehe. You will be the second Inborn expert that will die in my hands!”

Maniac Ji drew his longsword slowly and wasn’t wary of going toe to toe with Liu Jingshan.

“It’s better if you leave this to the Dragon Sect!” A domineering voice sounded.

Bang!

A black aura exploded instantly and coalesced into material form.

“What!”

The strong aura shocked everyone as they looked at the old man standing at the entrance.

The old man lifted his head. The surrounding black aura masked his appearance but the horrifying aura he emitted suppressed an area spanning over a thousand meters.

A heart-wrenching power could be felt from the old man as the crowd shivered.

Even Maniac Ji or Liu Jingshan did not give them such a strong sense of suppression.

“So strong!”

Maniac Ji’s hand was shivering. He looked in shock at the old man emitting black aura as he clenched his longsword even tighter.

“Inborn expert! It’s another Inborn expert!”

A guest of the Liu Family couldn’t contain himself and exclaimed. That young man had managed to summon two Inborn experts!

“Inborn!”

Members of the Liu Family felt their hearts skipped a beat. Dull clouds cast a shadow over their minds as they stared fervently at Mo Qinglong.

Liu Jingshan, who was holding a longsword in his hand, could feel perspiration breaking out of his palm as he looked at Mo Qinglong in disbelief.

Two Inborn experts! They had to face two Inborn experts while facing off against a small Rivertown.

Moreover, these two Inborn experts were both summoned by the same young man!

This...

Liu Jingshan’s face sank. That horrifying old man had locked onto him with his aura.

He was sure that if he moved, the other party would definitely attack him.

Moreover, he felt that he wouldn’t be a match for this old man.

This made his heart pump violently.

“Little Sword Celestial of the Tyrannical Sword? Sword Celestial’s inheritance? Mo Wushi, Level 8 Martial Artist, seeking your guidance!” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

At this moment, a dragonian walked up to the stage. He stared coldly at Liu Feiyun.

His voice instantly drew the attention of the crowd.

Everyone immediately turned around and looked at the stage. At that spot, a man even younger than Liu Feiyun was standing in front of Liu Feiyun.

Liu Feiyun’s expressions were changing rapidly. He took a glance at the old man with terrifying aura and perspiration covered his forehead. After which, he gripped his sword tightly as he looked to the young man in front of him.

“Miss Lan, be careful not to be injured!”

At this moment, Sect Leader Tang moved and appeared beside Lan Qingyue. Using his Internal Energy to cover her, he sent her towards Wang Xian.

“Xiao Xian, you...” Lan Qingyue looked at Wang Xian, still feeling a little disheveled.

“I know that this isn’t your own intention. Moreover, I will not let you marry a dead man today!”

Wang Xian smiled at Lan Qingyue and walked to her.

“Die!”

At this moment, Liu Feiyun let out a loud roar. With a hideous look, he charged towards Mo Wushi.

Mo Wushi was unmoved. Looking at the constantly changing swordsmanship of Liu Feiyun, he extended his hand to take the attack directly.

“You must be courting death!”

Seeing Mo Wushi was intending to use his body to take his attack directly, Liu Feiyun revealed a savage look. His swordplay turned even sharper!

Bam bam bam!

Sounds of metal clashing propagated. Mo Wushi used his palm to take on the sharp sword directly before pushing forward with his entire body!

This is bad!

Liu Feiyun was shocked as horror filled his eyes.

Bam!

A palm hit Liu Feiyun heavily. Mo Wushi followed up and stepped on Liu Feiyun with his feet as he stared coldly at him.

“How dare you offend the Dragon King with these meager skills!”

Mo Wushi looked down on Liu Feiyun with contempt. “Little Sword Celestial? Inheritance from the Sword Celestial? Trash!”

Liu Feiyun’s eyes popped open and were filled with disbelief.

This man who was even younger than him was surprisingly able to crush him easily.

He had always been a proud person and even swore to make it to the top of the Outstanding Young Heroes Chart. However, what happened now made him feel utterly defeated.

He was one of the top 20 on the Outstanding Young Heroes Chart and yet he lost to an unknown young man easily!

He tilted his head and stared at the young man who was looking at him with contempt.

He was the Little Sword Celestial who had received the inheritance of the Sword Celestial! He was supposed to become an Inborn expert in the future!

Bam!

However, an intense pain cruised throughout him at this moment as he felt his consciousness slipping away from him slowly!

“Feiyun!”

“Feiyun!”

The members of the Liu Family were aghast as they looked in horror at Liu Feiyun who was lying on the elevated stage.

Wang Xian looked at the members of the Liu Family coldly and remarked, “If one tries to kill me, I’ll definitely kill him. Liu Feiyun sent people to assassinate me and my kin. I’ll be returning these right now!”

His voice propagated to everyone’s ears.

Everyone in the Liu Family was horrified. What he meant was that Feiyun wanted to kill him and his family.

Therefore, he would also kill Feiyun and all his family members.

“Qingyue, it’s going to get bloody. Let’s leave this place!” Wang Xian said to Lan Qingyue gently.

Lan Qingyue looked at him blankly. Shortly after, tears streamed down her cheeks as she nodded her head heavily.
