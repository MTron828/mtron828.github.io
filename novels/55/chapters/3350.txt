3351 3,350 to destroy the three forces, the world was shocked

The Dragon Palace landed on the heaven opening desolate continent!

The Lich Kingdom joined hands with the corpse-wrapping race and the iron and Steel Union, and the three forces besieged the Dragon Palace in the nine-origin deep pit.

This matter was the most important thing for all the forces surrounding Lu Xingkong and the edge of the heaven opening desolate continent.

However, no one dared to come and watch the battle between the four forces.

It was too vast and terrifying!

Only on the A.I. chip, countless people were discussing.

Two hours after the war broke out, the A.I. chip had already guessed that the war might have ended.

Some people guessed that the dragon palace had been completely suppressed.

Some people guessed that the Dragon Palace had already been broken through and that the dragon palace had been massacred.

Some people guessed that the Dragon Palace might have escaped.

There were all kinds of guesses and discussions.

But no one thought that the Dragon Palace was a match for the three forces.

The reason was that the three forces were too strong.

The strength displayed by the Dragon Palace was weaker than any one of the three forces.

With such strength, how could they fight against the three forces?

However, in the third hour of the discussion between the strong disciples of the three forces, something happened that shocked everyone.

The Phoenix Vein clan was a force at the edge of the heaven opening primal continent. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

They weren’t far from the nine origin pit, only a few hours away.

More than ten hours ago, the battleships of the steel union had flown over the territory of their race.

However, at this moment, a warning sound came from the clan, and the defensive fire covered their nest.

The sound of explosions came from the front.

“What happened?”

The Phoenix Vein clan’s strong disciples flew to the sky.

Behind them, the battleships fell down with sparks.

The powerful dragons swayed their huge bodies and attacked from behind.

The Feng Wen clansmen’s jaws dropped when they saw this, their faces filled with disbelief.

“What… What’s happening? The steel union’s battleships are escaping, and the dragons are chasing after them?”

“Oh my God, look at those two dragons, their auras are terrifying, are they knights at level 9?”

“The Dragon Palace is chasing after the ship of the iron and Steel Union, the Dragon Palace is chasing after them!”

A shocked voice came from the Feng Wen clansmen.

They watched with their mouths Agape as the iron and steel union fled into the distance.

Behind them, the experts of the Dragon Palace continued to attack and Chase.

Along the way, all kinds of fighter airships fell.

Not long after, they saw four huge dragon palaces following closely behind them, collecting some of the fallen fighter airships.

The Phoenix patterns clan widened their eyes in shock.

Soon, this news was transmitted to the AI of the universe.

Not only were there oral messages, but there were also videos and images.

When the disciples of the races surrounding Lu Xing Kong and the edge of the land saw this result, their faces were filled with disbelief.

“This is unbelievable. The Dragon Palace is actually chasing after the steel union. Doesn’t that mean that the Dragon Palace has won this battle?”

“The three powers besieged the Dragon Palace, but they were chased by the Dragon Palace. If not for the videos, I wouldn’t have believed it. How could the Dragon Palace have such terrifying power?”

“The Dragon Palace actually has a knight level 9 warrior, this… This…”

“For more than a year, the Dragon Palace still couldn’t do anything to the Lich Kingdom. Now, after a year, they are chasing after the steel union to kill them. How did they improve so quickly?”

Countless disciple warriors were in an uproar, discussing among themselves.

No one had expected this outcome.

No one had expected that the three powers would lose.

No one had expected that the steel union would be hunted down by the Destruction Dragon Palace.

The Dragon Palace was too terrifying!

Even the steel union was being hunted down, what about the two powers, the Lich Kingdom and the corpse clan?

Did they escape?

Or were they destroyed?

On the AI, all the living beings were guessing again.

The battle at the Dragon Palace shocked all the powers.

“Two universe knights with level 9 battle power, damn it, how can there be such a great being in Dragon Palace, this is simply unreasonable!”

At the same time, in the Lich City of the Lich Kingdom, after the Lich Emperor escaped back to his god country, he came to the throne in the main palace.

The Great Beings of the Lich Kingdom who had escaped also rushed over one by one.

When they saw the information on the universe AI, their expressions were extremely unsightly.

At this moment, the Lich King’s breathing was a little hurried.

Two universe knights with level 9 combat strength were already enough to annihilate their lich kingdom.

Even if they escaped this time, they would face the Dragon Palace’s Revenge in the future.

What could they use to defend against it?

What was even more unbelievable was, why did two universe knights with level 9 combat strength suddenly appear from the Dragon Palace?

A year ago, they had gone to besiege the Dragon Palace. If there had been such a strong warrior in the Dragon Palace, their lich kingdom would have been finished long ago.

Back then, there hadn’t been one. How could they believe that two universe knights and Level 9 warriors had appeared in the past year?

“How many have we lost this time?”

Lich emperor asked with a gloomy face.

“Reporting to Lord Lich Emperor, only five universe knights and level 8 warriors have returned. About 40 level 7 warriors have died, and one-third of the disciples of the other warriors have been killed or injured, close to 2 million.”

A Lich reported in a low voice.

“Lord Lich King, now… What do we do now? Once that Dragon Palace warrior attacks, we won’t be able to defend!”

A Lich said with a dark expression.

Now that they had become enemies with the Dragon Palace, once the Dragon Palace warrior attacks, their lich kingdom would be unable to defend.

Now, they had to find a way out for themselves!

Hearing his subordinate’s words, the Lich King’s face kept changing.

“Huff! Huff!”

He took a deep breath, and there was a trace of powerlessness in his calm face. “Let’s talk about it. Then, let’s Find a place to hide!”

Now, they could only find a secret place to hide.

Like stray dogs.

Within the main hall, the warriors of the Lich Kingdom were silent, and they started to discuss.

And amongst the group of Lich Warriors, a universe Knight Level 7 warrior’s eyes gleamed, quietly waiting for the best time.

“Gather all the remaining elite disciples of the city, get them here immediately!”

Half an hour later, the Lich Emperor gave an order.

Next, they had to start their escape plan.

They had to find a secret place and hide.

After the order was given, the elites of the other eight cities in the Lich Kingdom quickly gathered.

At this moment, in a corner of the Lich City, a figure was watching everything with a smile on his face.

They could attack immediately!

Those who violated the Dragon Palace would die!
