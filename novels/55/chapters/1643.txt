Chapter 1644: The distinguished guests of the 1644 clan

The situation of the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan was even more dangerous than what Feng Luan understood.

“It should be that the fire cloud sparrow clan doesn’t want Feng Luan to be so worried. For a subordinate to be able to do this, it can be said that he is extremely loyal and has no other intentions!”

Wang Xian sighed in his heart.

After Feng Luan was killed, they chose to go into seclusion directly. However, now that Feng Luan had returned, they were willing to sacrifice their lives for the great cause of the empress.

Such a loyal race was rare.

“Looks like I can’t waste any more time!”

Wang Xian thought to himself. With a move of his body, he turned around and flew in the direction of Fire Cloud Mountain.

“Everyone, get on board. Take the nine gods airship and rush to Fire Cloud Sparrow Fire Cloud City!”

At this moment, a 100-meter-sized airship appeared in the sky above the Holy Fire Race.

The airship shimmered and emitted a powerful formation. Although the entire airship was small, it contained a terrifying amount of energy.

“The nine gods airship?”

Wang Xian looked over curiously.

Buzz

“What a fast speed!”

When everyone from the Holy Fire clan entered the airship, the airship flew forward at a terrifying speed.

This speed was not any slower than Wang Xian’s.

“This should be the top-notch airship of the nine God Empire!”

Wang Xian thought to himself. He stood there for a moment until the airship disappeared from his sight. Only then did he fly in the same direction.

Firecloud mountain was tens of thousands of kilometers away from here. It would take a few hours to reach it by flying.

“This is a completely destroyed city!”

As Wang Xian flew in the sky, he realized that there were destroyed cities below. The gigantic cities were completely in ruins.

In the cities, the fresh blood had dried up long ago. Some of the corpses had rotted away.

After passing through two to three cities consecutively, they were all in ruins.

There were also some people in the ruins of some cities.

The entire area was abnormally tragic.

“We’re Here!”

After six hours, numerous incomparably huge flaming mountains appeared in sight.

In front of the Flaming Mountains, there was an incomparably huge city that was over 100 kilometers away.

It was built with fiery red rocks, and the entire city was completely enveloped in flames.

In the sky, over a dozen flaming skylarks that had spread their wings and were over 10 meters in size were circling in the sky.

Each fire lark was exuding a violent aura. They were at least at the eighth level of the Seethrough realm.

At this moment, the entire city was completely sealed off.

This was the first city that Wang Xian had seen that had not been destroyed.

At this moment, a group of people was floating in front of the city.

Wang Xian looked over. They were the members of the Holy Fire clan.

He hesitated for a moment before flying directly to the city gate.

“What are these people from the fire Lark clan doing? Why aren’t we opening the city gate immediately?”

“They still need to confirm our identities. How troublesome. We are here to help them!”

Impatient voices could be heard.

Boom! Boom! Boom

At this moment, the sound of the gate opening could be heard.

More than a dozen old men and women dressed in fiery red robes walked over hurriedly.

“Everyone from the sacred flame clan is truly sorry. Because the masked assassin organization infiltrated Fire Cloud City two days ago and killed many of our members, we had no choice but to close the city!”

“We have also gone through strict checks on all those who entered. We are truly sorry!”

An old man walked over and immediately spoke to everyone from the sacred flame clan with an apologetic expression.

“Alright, let us go in. These people from our sacred fire clan are here temporarily. In a while, there will be another 500 insightful emptiness realm experts!”

The elder at the front of the Sacred Fire clan said plainly.

“Alright, everyone from the Sacred Fire clan, please come in!”

The elder from the fire lark clan frowned slightly and gestured.

“Who is he?”

At this moment, a faint voice sounded from the back of the Sacred Fire clan.

A young man stared at Wang Xian who was standing at the side and sized him up from head to toe.

“HMM?”

As soon as the young man spoke, the experts from the fire lark tribe immediately looked over. Their fiery red eyes locked onto Wang Xian.

“Everyone, I’m Wang Xian. I’m here to support the fire lark tribe!”

Wang Xian saw the experts from the fire lark tribe staring at him. He smiled and took a few steps forward.

At the same time, he took out a token from his interspatial ring.

“A young lad came to support the fire sparrows? What a joke!”

The young man who was sizing up Wang Xian was slightly stunned when he heard his words. Then, he said with a smile.

“This is?”

However, the elder at the front of the fire sparrows stared at the fiery red token and was slightly shocked.

“Young master, Please, Please, please come in!”

The elder bowed slightly with a hint of respect on his face. He immediately walked to Wang Xian’s side and said to him.

“What do you mean?”

The two experts of the Holy Fire clan, who were at level nine of the Seethrough realm, were slightly stunned when they saw the elder greeting Wang Xian respectfully. They frowned slowly.

“Bring everyone from the Holy Fire clan into the Fire Cloud Hall!”

“Young master, This Way Please!”

The old man said to the other experts of the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan and led Wang Xian into the hall.

Wang Xian smiled and followed closely from the side.

Since he had come to the fire cloud sparrow clan, it was natural for the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan to recognize him.

He had a token given to him by Feng Luan in his hand. It was called the fire cloud token!

Other than the Patriarch of the Guardian clan who did not need to treat him with respect, everyone else who held this token had to treat him with respect.

It could be said that this token represented the arrival of their patriarch of the Guardian clan.

“This old man, please inform your patriarch of the firecloud clan that I, Wang Xian, Am Here!”

Wang Xian entered the city and scanned his surroundings before speaking to the old man directly.

Firecloud city was located on top of a volcano. The temperature of the entire city was extremely high. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

It was a holy land for fire attribute cultivators.

“Young master Wang, why don’t you wait in the Firecloud Hall? I will inform the Patriarch.”

When the old man heard Wang Xian call their patriarch by his name, his heart trembled.

If Wang Xian didn’t have the firecloud token in his hand and just called their patriarch by his name, he would have taken action immediately.

“Okay, sure!”

Wang Xian nodded his head and followed the old man to the back of the Fire Cloud City.

“Young master Wang, please take a seat. I will inform the patriarch immediately!”

The old man brought Wang Xian to the huge fire cloud palace and pointed at the front seat.

“Okay!”

Wang Xian nodded his head.

One by one, the maids came over and poured a cup of tea.

“Fiery Light, where are you going? Aren’t you the one who welcomed the experts of the Sacred Fire Clan?”

“There’s a young master Wang named Wang Xian who has the fire cloud token in his hand. He wants to see the patriarch now. I’ll go to the Fire Cloud Mountain Palace to report to the Patriarch!”

“What? Fire cloud token? Fiery Light, stay here with this young master Wang. We’ll go and inform the Patriarch!”

Wang Xian picked up the Teacup and heard the exclamations from outside. Soon after, he saw the old man walking over again.

“Young master Wang, our elder will inform the patriarch. I will wait here with you!”

Fiery light smiled as he spoke to Wang Xian.
