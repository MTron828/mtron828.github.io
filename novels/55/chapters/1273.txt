Chapter 1274: 1275, a bunch of trash, actually allowed me to enter the arena

Translator: 5496903

“Ling Jian ‘ER’s strength is so strong, to actually be able to fight fiercely against a Demon Beast clan’s profound void tier first level expert, and not at a disadvantage!”

“My God, that profound void tier first level blood savage demon beast is actually at a disadvantage, this... this...”

“Right now, Ling Jian ‘ER’s strength is probably not much weaker than the nameless sword demon, right?”

“Hiss, too strong, too strong. Haha, if Ling Jian ‘ER can defeat the second-ranked Demonic Beast Heaven’s pride, then we humans can definitely hold our heads high, Haha!”

The battle in the arena began. Ling Jian ‘er and the Blood Savage Demonic Beast were engaged in an intense battle.

Facing the Blood Savage Demonic Beast, Ling Jian ‘er did not have the slightest bit of weakness. Powerful attacks came one after another.

Divine Arts versus divine arts, sword rays versus sharp claws.

In a confrontation, Ling Jian ‘er actually had the advantage.

The strength of the origin attribute was far beyond the imagination of ordinary people. Currently, Ling Jian ‘er did not have much origin gold.

Once she converted all the metal attributes in her body into origin gold, her attack power would be even more terrifying.

At that time, even Ren Xingchen, who had two attributes, would definitely not be her match.

Only with at least three attributes would she be able to fight against the origin gold.

“This Level One Seethrough demonic beast has just stepped into the Seethrough realm not long ago. It is no match for Ling Jian ‘Er!”

Wang Xian looked at Ling Jian ‘er, who was fighting in the arena, and a smile appeared on his face.

It was obvious that the Level One Seethrough Demonic Beast, who was ranked second on the heaven’s favorites list, had just reached the Seethrough realm not long ago. It was much weaker than Qian Ye.

Ling Jian ‘ER had a very high chance of defeating it.

“What the hell is going on? A woman ranked third among the human prodigies can actually defeat so many of our prodigies. Damn it, even the blood spirit doesn’t seem to be his match!”

“Damn it, damn it, I didn’t expect the human race to have such a monstrous woman. Her attacks are strange, I must kill her in the future!”

At the Demonic Beast Race’s position, some of the demonic beast experts looked at the battle in the arena with ugly expressions.

“Call the demonic soul over, let it come over and suppress the human elites!”

At the demonic Lin Race’s position, a demonic Lin that was over ten meters in size stared at the arena with cold eyes and said to his subordinate beside him.

“Yes, Elder!”

A demonic Lin immediately responded and flew towards the back.

“How, how, how!”

In the arena, The Blood Savage Demonic Beast turned into many bloody shadows, and the entire arena was filled with its shadows.

Strange attacks were launched at Ling Jian ‘ER from time to time.

However, around Ling Jian ‘ER’s body, there were swords and shields that were condensed from golden longswords.

The swords and shields were extremely heavy and thick. When the bloody shadows landed on them, they could not break her defense at all.

On the contrary, every single attack from Ling Jian ‘ER had to be taken seriously by the Blood Barbaric Demon Beast.

The battle continued for four to five minutes. Faced with a profound void Tier 1 expert, Ling Jian ‘er was still suppressed.

It might not be long before she seized an opportunity to defeat a profound void Tier 1 demon Lin.

When all the humans in the surrounding arena saw this scene, they revealed excited expressions.

“Haha, Ling Jian ‘ER is really invincible. Even a level 1 profound void martial artist is no match for her!”

“After today, Ling Jian ‘ER’s reputation will definitely soar. In the future, she will definitely be a top-notch expert that can shake the entire Liuhai Region!”

“At such an age, she already possesses such terrifying battle prowess. Even her former father is inferior to her!”

Unstintingly, praises rang out in the arena. Everyone cheered excitedly in the surroundings.

The youths were even more so.

Exhale! Exhale!

The third-ranked human genius had defeated the second-ranked demonic beast genius. To humans, this was a great honor!

“A group of trash, a group of trash, hurry up and get out. Don’t disgrace US Demonic Beasts!”

At this moment, an angry howl suddenly sounded, causing the Blood Savage Demonic Beast’s body to stiffen slightly, and a flash of terror flashed across its face.

“It’s the demon soul, the Demon Soul King is here. Once it arrives, it can easily suppress all the human geniuses!”

“This year, the humans are a little strong. However, once the Demon Soul King appears, all the human geniuses will die!” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

A furious roar sounded, causing cheers to ring out from the Demonic Beast’s side.

On the Genius Bridge of the Demonic Beast Clan, a seven to eight meter tall figure that was emitting terrifying demonic flames slowly walked over.

It raised its head high, emitting an invincible aura as it arrogantly glanced at the Blood Savage Demonic Beast and Ling Jian ‘ER who were fighting in the middle of the arena.

Its eyes were filled with dissatisfaction and disdain.

“Hu!”

The Blood Savage demonic beast that was at the first level of the profound void stage moved and directly dodged Ling Jian ‘ER’s attack, flying out of the arena.

It came to the Heaven’s Pride Bridge and looked at the imposing figure as it respectfully shouted, “Demonic Soul King!”

Demon beasts respected the strong, even if they were not of the same race.

However, Demon Soul King suppressed the same generation of Demon Beasts. Even many demon beasts that had lived for thousands of years were not as strong as it.

As the most monstrous demon beast of the demon Lin Royal clan, its position in the demon clan was very high.

In the past thousand years, Demon Soul was the most powerful King of Heaven’s Pride Beast of the Demon Beast clan.

“Humph, get lost. I thought you could kill all the humans in this small battle. I didn’t expect you to ask me to fight!”

“And your opponent is actually a human girl. Roar!”

As it spoke, it walked arrogantly and slowly stood in front of the arena. Its cold eyes swept across all the humans in front of it.

“All the heaven’s favorites that are still alive, all of you humans, come up. A bunch of ants. Today, Your Demon Soul King will eat all of you!”

A domineering voice resounded throughout the entire sky. A disdainful aura spread out in all directions.

“Keke, not to mention the appearance of ten human heaven’s favorites, even if all twenty of them came out, it wouldn’t be enough for Demon Soul King to kill them!”

“Originally, Demon Soul King wasn’t prepared to make a move. To him, fighting against human elites was a great humiliation. I didn’t expect the other elites to be so weak!”

“Roar Roar, human elites, come and Die!”

The Demon Beasts saw Demon Soul King’s arrival and all of them started to roar excitedly.

In an instant, the entire sky was filled with the excited roars of demon beasts.

“Demon Soul King?”

“Not good, it’s that Demon Beast, the Demon Race’s chosen Beast King!”

“It’s it, it’s this demon beast. In the training ground, it easily killed a peak level 1 insightful void martial artist from the blood flow empire. This demon beast is a terrifying existence at level 2 insightful void martial artist!”

“Level 2 insightful void martial artist? Is this the chosen Beast King of the Demon Beast Clan? With the strength of level 2 insightful void martial artist, who would be his match? Even if all the chosen ones were to join forces, they wouldn’t be able to defeat him!”

The originally excited humans saw the King Beast of the Demonic Beast clan walk out, and their expressions changed drastically.

Especially those young men who had followed him into the training grounds. When they saw the appearance of the demonic soul, their bodies couldn’t help but shiver.

That time, if they hadn’t run fast, perhaps more than ten thousand people would have died under its demonic flame!
