Chapter 1193: 1194, it’s You! !

Translator: 5496903

The Light Dragon Dynasty’s Island gradually became lively.

The arrival of the princes had invited many young elites from various factions, as well as powerful members of the mercenary group.

The Light Dragon Dynasty’s influence in the flowing sea region was second only to the blood flow empire. There were no more than five factions that could rival the light dragon dynasty.

As the Prince of the Light Dragon dynasty, it was very likely that he would be the future king of the Light Dragon Dynasty. Now that he had invited everyone to attend the banquet, there were naturally many people who came to give him face.

Moreover, they also knew that it was the time for the princes to take the test. If they could follow the right master and become the favorite of the future king of the Light Dragon Dynasty, they would definitely have the chance to establish a great clan that would last for a thousand years.

For many people, this was also an opportunity and a gamble.

Even if they lost the gamble, the price they had to pay wasn’t very heavy.

In the competition for the throne of the Light Dragon Dynasty, it was forbidden for princes to fight with each other.

As the king of the Light Dragon dynasty, if he saw princes scheming and fighting in secret, he would definitely cripple them.

Therefore, they would follow the Prince and would definitely be able to soar in the future.

After the first Prince and eighth Prince held a banquet, the second Prince’s banquet also began.

The entire Guanglong Empire’s Island was bustling with activity. Wang Xian ignored the clamor from the outside and stayed in his room to refine pills.

“Young master Wang Xian!”

“Young master Wang Xian!”

The maid’s soft voice came from outside. Wang Xian stared at her palm and waved it rapidly. The spiritual herbs formed a pill.

“Phew, what’s the matter?”

Wang Xian asked directly.

“Young master Wang Xian, the second prince asked me to ask you. The second prince will be holding a banquet this evening. Will you come by then, Young Master?”

The maid asked Wang Xian.

“We’ll see when the time comes!”

Wang Xian looked at the spiritual herbs beside him but didn’t give a definite answer.

“HMM? Yes, Young Master!”

The maid outside was slightly stunned and nodded immediately.

The prince had personally asked her to come and ask. She didn’t expect that the other party wouldn’t give a clear answer. What was the identity of the young man inside?

She thought in puzzlement and walked out.

I should be able to finish the refinement in the evening. Should I go over and take a look

Wang Xian looked at the spiritual herbs beside him and thought to himself.

I should go and take a look

Wang Xian thought to himself. The main reason why he came to the tomb of the demi-human was for the Dragon Energy.

He could obtain over a million dragon energy just by refining some medicinal pills for the second prince. If he could get to know more people, he might have some unexpected gains.

After these few days, Wang Xian had a vague idea of the strength of the Light Dragon Empire.

The strongest person in the Light Dragon Empire was at level five of the Seethrough Void Tier, which was one level higher than the Star Moon King.

The strongest person in the flowing sea region was the king of the blood flow empire, at level six of the Seethrough void tier.

The Light Dragon Empire did not only have one expert at level five of the Seethrough void tier. On the surface, there were at least three of them.

There were around a hundred Seethrough void tier experts.

With his strength, he could easily wipe out five to six star Moon kingdoms.

The people that Long Xiaotian and the rest knew had a faction behind them that was stronger than the Star Moon Kingdom.

Being able to get to know some people with status would be very beneficial to his collection of resources.

Wang Xian quickly refined pills one by one. There was a 100% success rate.

By refining two sets of pills, Wang Xian would be able to obtain three pills.

With eight pills, Wang Xian would be able to obtain three pills. He didn’t need to pay for any spiritual herbs. To him, it was simply picking up money!

“It’s Done!”

At around six o’clock in the evening, Wang Xian saw the last of the spiritual herbs turning into pills. A smile appeared on his face. He stood up and put away all the pills.

“I’m going to take a look at this man-demon graveyard!”

Wang Xian’s eyes were sparkling. He pushed open the door and walked out.

“Young Master!”

The maidservant who had been waiting for instructions at the door saw him walking out and shouted hurriedly.

“HMM, where is the second Prince holding the banquet? Bring Me There!”

Wang Xian said to the maidservant directly.

“Young master, the second Prince’s banquet is not held on this island. It’s held by the sea outside!” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The maidservant said to him immediately.

“Not here?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows.

“Young Master, let me bring you there!”

The maid looked at him.

Wang Xian nodded and followed behind the maid as they walked out.

When they walked out from the exit, the bloody smell outside made Wang Xian feel a little uncomfortable.

“It’s in the building by the beach. There’s a manor there. The second prince is hosting the banquet here today!”

As the maid spoke, she flew into the air and brought Wang Xian to the luxurious looking manor by the sea.

Although the buildings in the cemetery of the demi-human were messy, every building was extremely luxurious.

Those who were able to establish a foothold here were no ordinary forces.

“Young master, you can just go in directly. I will be going back first!”

After sending Wang Xian to the entrance of the manor by the sea, the maid bowed to Wang Xian and left immediately.

Wang Xian looked at the manor and walked straight in.

He merely mentioned that he was invited by the second Prince of the Guanglong dynasty, and the guards at the entrance let him in.

It wasn’t that the management wasn’t strict, but that no one dared to impersonate the guest of the Prince of the Guanglong dynasty.

After entering the manor, he walked in under the guidance of the staff.

“This young master, you are in front!”

The waiter pointed to the front and retreated.

Wang Xian looked over and revealed a look of surprise.

In front of him, there were a total of five to six hundred people sitting at a round table. A huge empty space was left in the middle.

There was a ten-meter-tall bonfire in the middle.

Young and middle-aged men were sitting around and chatting.

Wang Xian swept his gaze over and realized that Long Xiaotian was nowhere to be seen. He looked at the empty seats and walked over directly.

“I saw the second prince walking in confidently to call his subordinates. I think the second Prince’s influence is definitely not weak!”

“He should be very strong. The second prince is already a strong contender for the throne of the Kingdom of Light Dragon. Only the first prince, the eighth Prince and the seventeenth prince can compete with him. The rest of them are much weaker!”

“I heard that in the first round of the assessment, the king of the Kingdom of light dragon is most satisfied with the second prince. If the second Prince’s influence is stronger, we can consider joining the second prince and take a gamble!”

Wang Xian walked closer and heard the voices of the people in front of him talking.

He swept his gaze around and found that most of them were above transcendent level six. There were also more than ten half-step void interpretation experts.

Many of the young men were very strong. They must be young talents from various factions or even heaven’s favorites.

Wang Xian walked to the two empty seats and sat down.

“HMM?”

However, when Wang Xian landed, a gaze looked over and his gaze gradually turned cold.

He stared at Wang Xian with hints of killing intent in his eyes.

“It’s You!”

Xing Tianyi stared at Wang Xian and said coldly.

Wang Xian was slightly stunned when he saw him. Then, he looked at the few people beside him. He was slightly surprised!

It was true that enemies don’t meet in the same place!
