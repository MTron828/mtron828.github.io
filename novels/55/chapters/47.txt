Chapter 48: Is This A Confession?

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

The midsummer night was cooling down. Guan Shuqing walked out from a hotel.

A chilling breeze blew past her body causing her to shiver a little. Looking at the bright moon in the sky, she suddenly felt a little helpless.

“Brother Wu, Brother Wu. Please be careful.”

At this moment, her father’s voice sounded from behind her.

He was walking in front of a middle-aged man and was constantly trying to get on the good books of the middle-aged man.

The middle-aged man nodded his head arrogantly and patted on the shoulders of his father. “Alright brother, if I can help, I’ll definitely help you!”

“Thank you, Brother Wu. Thank you, Brother Wu. Please be careful. Sister Wu, you too!” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Guan Shuqing’s father was full of smiles as he spoke passionately at them.

“Shuqing, see you in the morning tomorrow!” Behind the middle-aged man and woman, a juvenile stared at Guan Shuqing fervently.

Guan Shuqing felt uncomfortable at the gaze of the juvenile but still nodded her head slightly.

The edge of the juvenile’s mouth arched upwards as he said, “I’ll go and fetch you in the morning tomorrow.”

Guan Shuqing and her family saw the middle-aged man family leave. Guan Shicheng looked at her and frowned. “From here on, be a little more enthusiastic around Wu Chen and don’t be so cold to him.”

“Dad!” Guan Shuqing looked at her father with displeasure and answered resolutely, “I don’t like him!”

“Huh?” When Guan Shicheng heard her, his face sank. “It’s fine that you don’t like him now. Feelings can be developed over time.”

Upon hearing her father’s reply, Guan Shuqing’s body stiffened up.

“Shuqing, Wu Chen is still a pretty good guy. Moreover, Wu Family’s conditions are good.” Guan Shuqing’s mother tried her best to convince Guan Shuqing.

“Mom, are you all going to sacrifice the happiness of your daughter for the company?” Guan Shuqing asked in a pitiful tone.

“After raising you to this age, you should be thinking about your father. Could you bear to let us stay in that old house till we die? It’s time for you to think about us after raising you to this age,” Guan Shicheng said to her in a solemn tone. “If Wu Chen doesn’t reject the idea, have the wedding completed as soon as possible!”

“What?” When she heard her father, she looked at him with disbelief. “Dad, I’m still studying and am just 21 years old. Are you asking me to get married now?”

“You are going to get married eventually so what’s wrong with getting married now?” Guan Shicheng stared at her.

“No, definitely not. I won’t marry someone I don’t like.” Guan Shuqing shook her head incessantly and her body started leaning back. “I don’t like him and I will never marry him.”

“Shuqing.” Guan Shuqing’s mother saw how her daughter reacted and couldn’t help but feel her heart aching. She walked over quickly and said, “Oh daughter, we are not asking you to get married to him right now. You guys can try to develop feelings for each other first.”

“I... I...” Guan Shuqing looked at her parents, gritted her teeth and exclaimed, “I already have someone I like.”

“What?” When Guan Shicheng heard her words, he stared at her intensely.

“I have someone that I like!” Guan Shuqing gritted her teeth and said resolutely.

“Someone you like? Great! If the guy that you are fond of has family conditions that are as good as Wu Family and could help us, I won’t object to it. If he doesn’t, I advise you to give up on this idea as soon as possible. After raising you for twenty years, can’t you just help out the family? Let me tell you this. Don’t even start having second thoughts about this. My words are final!” Guan Shicheng looked at her and growled angrily.

Guan Shuqing’s expression turned pale and tears were welling up in her eyes.

“Shuqing, your dad and mom are doing this for your own good.” Mother Guan walked over and patted the shoulders of her own daughter.

For my own good? Asking me to marry someone I don’t like is for my own good?

Using me as chips in exchange for benefits is for my own good?

Guan Shuqing felt that her heart was in pain suddenly. Since the unfortunate event happened to her family, she felt that her parents had changed greatly.

Wang Xian! She shouted helplessly in her mind.

If Wang Xian’s family conditions are better than Wu Family, then my parents...

But Wu Family had assets of $400-500 billion. Although Wang Xian is rich, there’s a clear difference between him and the Wu Family, not to mention helping my family.

No, I definitely wouldn’t marry someone I don’t like!

Guan Shuqing sat in the car and her brain was cluttered. It was when she was back in her own room that she finally regained some consciousness.

A determined look appeared on her face gradually as she took out her phone and tapped on “WeChat”.

“Wang Xian, are you there?” She sent the message over anxiously.

At 10.30pm, Wang Xian had just returned to his dormitory room after bathing and happened to see Guan Shuqing’s message. He immediately replied,

“Yeah, what’s the matter? Are you alright?” he asked, concerned.

“Not fine.” Guan Shuqing replied. After which, she asked anxiously, “Do you like me?”

What the...!

When Wang Xian saw this message, he was completely surprised. What’s her intention behind asking this question?

His expression changed rapidly and didn’t know how to reply. He would be lying if he said he had no feelings for a beautiful girl like Guan Shuqing.

“Did you have too much alcohol?”

However, Wang Xian didn’t reply “yes” directly. He sensed that Guan Shuqing was acting a little weird and wasn’t her normal self. There’s always a reason behind an abnormal behaviour. Therefore, Wang Xian cleverly did not answer her question directly.

Guan Shuqing was a little disappointed at this reply and she added immediately, “If you could earn $50 million within 3 years, is it okay if you marry me?”

Cough cough! What the f*ck!

Wang Xian was drinking water when he saw the reply and choked on it immediately. If he was surprised before, he was shocked now.

What the f*ck! What’s with Guan Shuqing today?! Why is she speaking so weirdly? Is this a joke?

Wang Xian was making guesses in his mind and felt that the weather was a little erratic the last few days. He answered in a jokingly manner, “Forget about three years. It shouldn’t be a problem for me to earn $50 million within two years or perhaps even within a year! At that time, will I be able to take a great beauty like you as my wife? Hehehe!”

When Guan Shuqing saw Wang Xian’s reply, she finally had a faint smile on her face. “Yes, you can.”

“Haha, then you will be too simple. Wow! If the guys in school knew about it, wouldn’t they die of envy? The goddess of the school would be marrying me!” Wang Xian answered in a comical manner.

“Yeah!” When Guan Shuqing saw his reply, she smiled wider. She lay on her bed and replied, “My parents are asking for a guy I dislike to go out with me tomorrow. At that time, please accompany me.”

“Sure, absolutely not a problem.” Wang Xian answered directly despite feeling that the message was a little strange.

“Then we have agreed on this. This baby is going to sleep now. Goodnight, Xiao Xian. I’ll call you again in the morning. Remember to wake up early!” [1]

When Guan Shuqing sent that message out, her face turned red. Although Xiao Xian isn’t as successful as Wu Family right now, if he could earn $50 million in 2-3 years and I use death to force my parents, my parents would definitely not pressure me further. Moreover, they would also likely agree to us being together. After all, Xiao Xian is so capable despite his young age.

Oh my god!

When Wang Xian saw Guan Shuqing’s last message, he could no longer hold back his emotions as he jumped upright.

Although their relationship wasn’t bad, they were still addressing each other using their full name. He would address her as Guan Shuqing and she would address him as Wang Xian.

With Guan Shuqing’s personality, she wouldn’t call him Xiao Xian and address herself as “baby” to him.

The last message made Wang Xian’s heart palpitate violently.

He scrolled through the conversation log between the two of them and started pondering the details.

Firstly, something must have happened to Guan Shuqing on her way home. Secondly,...

Hehehe. Could it be that Guan Shuqing really likes me and that this was a confession?

Hohoho~

Wang Xian was in ecstasy.
