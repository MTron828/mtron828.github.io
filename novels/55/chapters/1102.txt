Chapter 1103: 1104 Feng Luan arrived

Translator: 5496903

Hehe, general hai, it’s better for you to take your subordinates and SCRAM BACK!

Jin Qianyuan’s eyes were filled with coldness when he saw tsunami sky attacking the array formation. He didn’t give any face at all and shouted in a low voice.

“Scram back!”

“Scram back!” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

For a time, the people of Holy Sea Town who were standing on the city wall also shouted at tsunami sky and the army of ocean cultivators with disdain.

“Good, good, good, Holy Sea Town!”

Tsunami Sky revealed a furious expression. His chest heaved up and down continuously. It was obvious that he had been greatly angered by the scene in front of him.

He was the general of the Army of ocean cultivators, an expert at the profound void realm. He was a well-known expert in the entire star-moon kingdom.

Anyone who saw him would have to be respectful.

Now, in a small town, he was humiliated and even insulted in front of his subordinates. This was the first time he had encountered such a situation.

The soldiers behind him also had ugly expressions.

The ocean cultivator corps was ranked in the top five in the star-moon Kingdom Corps. Now, they were humiliated in front of a small town!

Was it so easy for the ocean cultivator corps to be humiliated?

“General, let us attack together. Anyone who offends US must die!”

A burly old man raised the huge axe in his hand with a furious expression and shouted.

“Alright, Attack!”

“I don’t believe that a small array can stop the ocean cultivators!”

Tsunami sky shouted with a savage expression.

“Yes!”

“Get Ready!”

“Attack!”

The old man holding the huge axe had a fierce look in his eyes as he ordered loudly.

“Attack!”

Over ten thousand soldiers of the ocean cultivator army launched an attack at the same time.

Each of them even released a divine ability. In an instant, a terrifying energy condensed in front of the city gate.

Tsunami Sky also raised the huge sword in his hand, and his whole body shook slightly.

“Dharma Idol Heaven and earth: sky-high Sword!”

The void seemed to shake slightly, and a 100-meter-long shadow appeared around tsunami sky, holding a huge sword that was at least 1,000 meters long.

The huge sword slashed toward holy sea town.

Dharma Idol, sky-high Sword!

When everyone in holy sea town saw this horrifying attack, their faces changed slightly, and some of them turned pale.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

The attack of over 10,000 ocean cultivators landed on the array formation, and the attack of a tsunami landed on the array formation.

The sound of cracking could be heard again, but what shocked them was that everyone’s full-strength attack still only broke two arrays.

“Hiss!”

This made everyone in the ocean cultivators corps suck in a breath of cold air.

“How is this possible? What Array Formation is this? How can it be so powerful? !”

The soldiers of the ocean cultivator corps sucked in a breath of cold air, their faces filled with shock.

Even tsunami sky’s expression was extremely unsightly, his gaze flickering as he looked in the direction of holy sea town.

“Hu, the array formation that Lord Wang took out is so awesome. Haha, Our Holy Sea Town will be incomparably safe in the future!”

“That’s right. Lord Wang said that this array formation can withstand the attacks of a rank three profound void martial artist, and the star-moon city’s defensive array formation can only withstand the attacks of a rank one profound void martial artist!”

“Then we don’t have to worry about being attacked by ferocious beasts anymore!”

On the city wall, everyone looked excited when they saw this scene.

“Despicable human. All he knows is internal strife. That human expert entered the void interpretation realm before him. I’m not his match, but that human can forget about killing me!”

In the sky, the leader of the Blood Barbaric Demonic Beast, who had been hiding for two days, stared at the spot below with a flickering gaze. He did not show himself!

“Don’t even think about breaking through the city defense formation of Shenghai Town!”

Wang Xian’s voice rang out. He looked at tsunami sky and said faintly.

Buzz

Tsunami sky raised his head abruptly and stared at Wang Xian. “You killed my son!”

He growled in a low voice, word by word.

“Your son deserves to die!”

Wang Xian stared at him and said faintly.

Crack! Crack

Tsunami Heaven’s arm, which was holding the huge sword, let out a crisp sound. He stared at Wang Xian and slowly closed his eyes.

“Since your Shenghai town has betrayed the star-moon kingdom, I hereby sentence all of you to die!”

“Don’t think that a formation can protect all of you for the rest of your lives!”

Tsunami Heaven opened his blood-red eyes abruptly and his majestic voice reverberated throughout the entire Shenghai town.

“Get lost!”

Jin Qianyuan roared furiously when he heard his words.

‘you, star-moon kingdom, still have the face to say such words?’?

“Get lost!”

The people on the city wall also followed suit and shouted angrily.

Tsunami Sky stood there coldly, and his expression gradually became ugly.

He couldn’t break the city protection array, so he had no way to deal with holy sea town.

Was he going to let a small town separate from star-moon kingdom and become independent?

If this were to spread to other cities, wouldn’t it be a huge disgrace?

A town under East Sea city had rebelled and become independent, but in the end, there was nothing they could do!

Wasn’t this a slap to the city Lord’s and Tsunami Sky’s faces?

Tsunami Sky’s eyes flickered. He immediately took out the communication stone plate and passed the news to City Lord Lei with a gloomy face.

“Just get someone to keep an eye on their movements. We don’t need to pay attention to them!”

Wang Xian took a look at the ocean cultivator army in front of him. He spoke to Jin Qianyuan and flew toward the mayor’s residence.

Jin Qianyuan nodded and ordered his men to keep an eye on the ocean cultivator army before returning to deal with the matter.

On the other hand, many citizens of Shenghai town flew up to the city wall curiously and looked at the ocean cultivator army below.

Some people couldn’t help but curse. This made the ocean cultivator army more than 10,000 people furious, and they stared at them with murderous intent.

But later, more and more citizens of holy sea town came to see. Some of them were grumpy and opened their mouths to greet their families.

In the end, tsunami sky, whose face was black, led the ocean cultivator army to retreat five kilometers!

“Don’t think that just because there’s a formation, we can’t do anything to you. I don’t believe that you won’t come out. Since ancient times, it’s not like there’s no way to deal with this!”

Upon seeing the message sent by City Lord Lei, Tsunami Heaven revealed a hint of malevolence on his face.

Donghai city had to settle the matter regarding the holy sea town as soon as possible. Otherwise, if the entire star-moon kingdom were to find out about it, Donghai town would lose all its face.

Time passed slowly. Wang Xian sat in the backyard of the mayor’s residence and sipped his tea. It was a rare occasion for him to lie there comfortably.

Ao Jian and Ao Jian were cultivating.

When Feng Luan arrives, I will give the town of Shenghai to her. I will also have to move the Dragon Palace over

Wang Xian thought to himself.

Currently, he had hundreds of thousands of demonic beasts’corpses in his interspatial ring and the storage spiritual bag.

Wang Xian estimated that the energy of these corpses would be able to increase his level after he devoured them. However, he still chose to stay behind.

This was the foundation of the Dragon Palace. It was important for him to level up, but it was even more important for him to develop the Dragon Palace.

When the Dragon Palace descended, it would be the time for rapid development!
