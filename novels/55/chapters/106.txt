Chapter 107: You Can’t Woo a Girl Like That

“Anyhow Pressure Points Technique!”

When the juvenile heard the technique he mentioned, he trembled and stared hard at Wang Xian.

What the hell was that?

Wang Xian looked at the self-conceited juvenile with a smile on his face.

Acting tough in front of me?

Using me as a stepping stone? Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Serves you right.

As for what Wang Xian did just now, it was true that he was doing it without any thoughts. That was also done deliberately to maintain a low profile.

Otherwise, the girl would be fully recovered with a swing of his arm.

“Fine, just you wait!” The juvenile stared fiercely at Wang Xian.

Wang Xian put away his smile and looked impassively at the juvenile. Slowly, he said, “I’ll be waiting!”

“Hmph!”

With a cold snort, the juvenile went back to his military training.

The doctor and the two leads next to each other parted their mouths. With some hesitation, they dispersed into the crowd.

Doctor Sun did not leave as she observed Wang Xian with curiosity.

Just now, the juvenile from the Sacred Followers Guild had already displayed formidable medical skills. But this young man here was much more powerful than him.

When Doctor Sun thought about it, she had some desires for the astounding medical skills.

“Hey, this is the second time that we meet!” said Doctor Sun, looking at Wang Xian.

“Yes.” Wang Xian smiled to Doctor Sun.

“You are formidable in medical skill.” Doctor Sun stared at him with passionate eyes as she wanted to know him better.

Wang Xian smiled and said modestly, “So-so. I’m not that skillful!”

“I’m a little ashamed of myself if your standard is considered so-so.” Doctor Sun gave a bitter smile, “You’re the most skillful doctor I have ever seen.”

“Haha, it’s nothing!”

Wang Xian chuckled with embarrassment since he was admired by a beautiful doctor who was older than him.

Wang Dahai was dumbfounded as he observed the look of the beautiful doctor. He then shook his head slowly and found himself a seat.

Wang Xian brushed Doctor Sun off with a few words before he sat down beside Wang Dahai.

Wang Xian wanted to chat with the beautiful girl, but Doctor Sun posed some medical-related questions to him.

Wang Xian felt awkward as he knew nothing about it. So, he briefly answered her.

Doctor Sun bit her lip when she noticed that Wang Xian did not seem to welcome her. Hence, she blatantly asked for his phone number and left.

Seeing Wang Xian walking towards him, Wang Dahai gave him a thumbs up. “Bro, you’re terrific!”

Wang Xian smiled, “Your Su Qian has rested enough. Send her the drinks now!”

“Haha, we can do it together. You deliver drinks to your sister while I will give mine to Su Qian.”

Wang Dahai pulled him immediately and headed to the ladies where a crowd had just dispersed.

After fawning over the ladies, Wang Dahai went back to the dormitory with Wang Xian, feeling satisfied.

“Do you want to game?” asked Wang Dahai when they were back in the room.

“Nope. You go ahead. I’ll just lie down for a while.”

Wang Xian shook his head. He lay on his bed, thinking about the Dragon Palace.

To construct the Dragon Palace, he would require a substantial amount of materials. These materials would be worth at least hundreds of billions if they were to convert into monetary value.

Some of these resources could be found in sinking ships or minerals from the ocean floor in the sea.

But he would need to purchase some of the materials like fine iron and silver by himself.

“This would cost a bomb. Now, I need to think of a way to earn money. The First-grade Restaurant is only earning about a million in a day. Compared to what I need, it is way too little.”

Wang Xian knit his brow slightly. Finding ways to earn money was a problem for him.

“Medical skills? Should I open a medical hall?”

An idea came to him when Wang Xian thought of the girl who he’d treated just now. Opening a medical hall seemed viable.

Given his current Five Elements Divine Dragon strength, treating ordinary illness was a piece of cake to him.

Moreover, he could open a high-class medical hall where one consultation would cost about two to three million or even higher.

Once the reputation of the medical hall is established, Wang Xian could take in two to three patients a day. In a month, he would be able to earn hundreds of millions, or even more.

Wang Xian drew a smile at the corner of his lips. He immediately took out his phone and made a few calls.

First of all, he called Old Qin, asking for his help to get a certification to practice medicine.

Opening a medical hall required certification. Otherwise, the medical hall would be operating without an official license.

At the same time, he got Old Xue and Old Qin to promote and refer some clients to him.

Finally, he called Manager Huang too.

He recalled that a shop was put on lease right beside the First-grade Restaurant. He could buy that place over and turn it into his medical hall. It would also be convenient for him to pop by the First-grade Restaurant to have his lunches and dinners.

After making three calls, Wang Xian’s plan to open the Divine Dragon Medical Hall had finally begun.

“It’s 11.30 am now. I’ll ask Guan Shuqing out for lunch. Guys should take the initiative.”

Wang Xian climbed out from his bed, “Dahai, I’m having lunch with someone. You can have lunch by yourself!”

“What a beast. Who are you going out with?” asked Wang Dahai, who was playing his game.

Wang Xian waved his hand and ignored him. He took out his phone and sent a message to Guan Shuqing.

Today, Guan Shuqing had four lessons in the morning. So, Wang Xian headed straight to her classroom.

The University of Rivertown was a huge school. It took Wang Xian five minutes to walk from the male dormitory to Guan Shuqing’s classroom.

Wang Xian looked at the building with classrooms. He then walked over and waited for Guan Shuqing downstairs.

Vroom!

When he just arrived, the sound of a sports car was heard from behind.

Wang Xian looked back with curiosity. He spotted a young man coming out from an Audi R8 Sports Car that was parked beside him.

The young man was wearing formal attire, looking charming. He opened his boot and took out a bouquet of red roses. With a face wearing smiles, he stood beside the car and waited.

Wang Xian looked at the young man and smiled.

The young man also noticed Wang Xian, who was next to him. He drew his lips and glanced at the expensive watch on his wrist.

Ten more minutes until class dismissal.

“Hey, are you waiting for your girlfriend?” the young man asked Wang Xian, as he was bored.

“Well, she’s not my girlfriend yet!” Wang Xian said with a smile.

“Oh? Are you wooing that girl?” the young man looked at him and asked with a smile.

Wang Xian smiled and nodded his head.

“Are you going to lunch with her?” asked the young man smilingly.

“Yes, we’re going to the canteen for lunch.” Wang Xian nodded.

“Canteen?” The young man was slightly stunned as he curved his lips slightly. “Bro, since you’re wooing the girl, you should treat her to something good. In this way, the girl will feel your effort. The canteen?” The young man shook his head as he talked, “You need to be sincere in wooing the girl. If you want to impress her, learn from me. You’re still far from it!”

As he said this, he patted Wang Xian on the shoulder. He was earnest in his words, “Girls are vain. She will be touched by my formal confession. It’s not going to work if you do it like you did now. This is your shortcoming.”
