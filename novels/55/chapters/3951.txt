Chapter 3952: 3951 forbidden ground, Void Moon

Translator: 549690339

Wang Xian was currently cultivating and lacked resources.

A powerful forbidden ground was something that Wang Xian could visit.

If he could obtain some resources, it would be of great benefit to his subsequent cultivation.

Moreover, the resources in the lair of a forbidden ground might be able to benefit Wang Xian’s main body.

After all, Wang Xian’s current realm was only at the fourth level of the universe overlord.

The Forbidden Land, the Void Moon, was located above the sky.

Before the Void Moon forbidden land was destroyed, there were teleportation arrays that could reach the outer area directly.

However, after the destruction, the teleportation arrays there had been destroyed and were never built again.

The Sword and Magic Universe was round and the Sky had an end. At the end of the sky was the chaotic space.

The Forbidden Land of the Void Moon was suspended in the sky.

Their nest was a huge meteorite that looked like a crescent moon. The whole crescent moon was emitting a faint light, which was very eye-catching in the sky. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

There were many buildings in the sky around the crescent moon.

However, at this moment, they looked completely dilapidated.

They had turned into ruins.

After receiving the information about the forbidden land, it took five years to arrive here.

The central continent was huge.

Even with Wang Xian’s full speed, it took him ten days to fly towards the sky.

It could be said that he was living in the sky!

“This crescent moon is really huge. ”

Wang Xian raised his head and muttered as he looked at the core of the Void Moon forbidden ground that was still emitting light.

The strong disciples of the Void Moon Forbidden Ground referred to their core crescent moon as the Holy Moon.

At this moment, Wang Xian could vaguely see that there were a large number of human figures around the Holy Moon.

Some of the figures were even exuding a powerful aura.

“Eh, there are actually quite a number of masters in the ruler realm.”

Wang Xian looked over and his eves sDarkled.

It seemed that there were quite a number of forbidden lands in the Holy Land here.

He thought to himself. He hid his true form and teleported forward.

Very soon, Wang Xian arrived at the location below the Holy Moon.

Located at the Holy Moon, the most eye-catching thing was a door to the void.

The gate to the Void was located at the top of the Holy Moon.

The entire gate to the void was about 1,000 meters in size. It was not big, and one could even say that it was very small.

At this moment, there were many buildings gathered in front of the gate.

There were buildings in various forms. Some of them were like a bridge, and some of them were floating islands.

There were also some special clouds.

One could clearly see that these were different kinds of powerful forces.

Wang Xian swept his gaze across them. Combining the information he obtained in his mind, he knew that these forces all came from the forbidden grounds and saint academies of the various saint lands.

And those masters of the ruler realm were obviously also masters of the forbidden grounds and saint academies of the saint lands.

Wang Xian didn’t know why they were guarding here.

He swept his mind over and sensed that there were dozens of masters of the ruler realm in each force.

Among them, the stronger ones had already reached the level six ruler realm.

This level of strength was considered a core powerhouse of the top races in the nine-origin universe.

“A forbidden territory’s lair has attracted so many forbidden lands and Saint Academies. Moreover, they have sent so many powerhouses. This is definitely not as simple as the opportunity obtained by the disciples. There must be some other reason. ”

Wang Xian looked around and thought to himself.

As for the reason, Wang Xian had no idea.

His gaze landed on the gate of void. He could see that there were disciples entering and exiting the gate from time to time.

Wang Xian swept his gaze across the gate. After pondering for a moment, he decided to enter the gate directly.

His body moved and he came to the bottom of the gate of void.

At this moment, Wang Xian sensed some gazes staring at him.

He raised his eyebrows and prepared to step into the door.

However, when he got closer, he sensed an energy presence.

This surprised him slightly. With a move of his body, he concealed his body and separated it!

Wang Xian’s void dragon body continued to fly into the door.

Buzz

Arriving in front of the Void Door, Wang Xian entered it easily.

In an instant, a majestic power of space was transmitted over.

“Eh? The power of space here is so abundant. Moreover, the area inside is much larger than what it looks like from the outside. Is it because of the power of space?”

Wang Xian’s eyes were sparkling as he entered.

He looked inside and saw a large number of ruins.

Only a few buildings were still intact and were covered by some energy.

Wang Xian looked inside and his body moved. He immediately flew inside.

In the outside world, Wang Xian revealed himself and built a simple building. He sat cross-legged and waited quietly.

“There’s someone! ”

Wang Xian had just entered the Holy Moon when he saw two young men flying out.

One of them even had a terrifying scar on his body. His aura was extremely weak!

“The Tower of Moon isn’t something we can enter. It’s too dangerous in there.”

(‘I really don’t know how those evildoers managed to enter the upper floors of the Tower of Moon. ”

The two of them spoke disappointedly. They glanced at Wang Xian and continued to fly towards the exit vigilantly.

“Tower of the Moon?”

Wang Xian muttered when he heard that.

As the body of the Void Dragon was relatively weak, he could not use the soul-absorbing power.

Therefore, Wang Xian did not know the situation inside. He could only explore it by himself.

Wang Xian scanned his surroundings and came to the nearest complete building.

The space of the entire Holy Moon was huge. Not far from the entrance, there was a complete building.

It was like a courtyard and a small river. However, this courtyard and the small river were covered by a magic array.

It was not destroyed, but it was difficult for others to enter.

Wang Xian came to the front of this building and flew to the sky to take a look.

“The magic array has no blind spots and covers this place. There is no way to enter.”

Wang Xian looked at this place and raised his eyebrows slightly.

From his senses, unless he used a strong force to break into this courtyard, there was no way to break in.

Otherwise, there was no way to break in!

And to break this magic array, he would probably need the strength of a master of the universe at level three or four.

This magic array could also be resisted by space-type cultivators.

As a universe with space-type attributes, the experts here would naturally prevent space-type teleportation.

Therefore, only those with strong strength could enter. Otherwise, they could forget about entering.

A dead zone.

However, Wang Xian guessed that there might be some pretty good treasures in this courtyard.

This was because as the entrance to the Holy Moon, many powerful forces would place some items at the entrance to show their strength. This item might not be the best, but it wouldn’t be too bad either..
