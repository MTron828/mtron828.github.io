Chapter 1163: 1164 killed the prince

Translator: 5496903

“It’s already night time. How much longer do we have to wait?”

The third Prince looked at the middle-aged man coldly.

The middle-aged man lowered his head and revealed a bitter smile. “Third prince, we have already used all the power we can. We will definitely be able to bring those two people to you!”

“Hmph, I want to see the figures of those two people today!”

The third prince snorted coldly. His face revealed a cold expression as he fiercely picked up the wine on the table and drank a cup.

“Get Ready. We will go back tomorrow!”

The third prince continued to speak to the middle-aged man.

“Yes, yes!”

The middle-aged man at the side hurriedly nodded and replied. He slightly let out a sigh of relief.

Night slowly arrived. Many people in Bright Moon city let out a sigh of relief. This was because the dragon Spike had already announced that the mission was temporarily suspended.

Those who had issued the mission were slightly dissatisfied. The mission that they had mentioned two days ago would not be late, and it was happening today. This made them very unhappy.

They felt that the dragon spike was not as powerful as they had imagined.

Compared to the night in Bright Moon City, the forum was much livelier. All of them were talking about the dragon spike and the undercurrent.

After a few days of competition, the attacks were extremely shocking. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Especially the two violent attacks of the undercurrent lord, which shocked everyone.

The night arrived. Because of the continuous rain, the night was even more profound. Looking at the starry sky and the distance, it was like a devil devouring people.

The night was dark and the wind was high. It was a night of killing!

In the center of Bright Moon City, in a luxurious villa.

This manor was incomparably luxurious, far surpassing the manors and manors of the great clans of Bright Moon City.

This was the manor of the royal family of star-moon kingdom.

The entire manor was extremely large, and city guards patrolled the surroundings.

A level 9 transcendent array guarded the entire manor.

And within the manor, there were still dozens of experts guarding a courtyard.

Under the layers of protection, unless an expert at the profound void tier arrived, anyone below the profound void tier would be swiftly killed.

“We don’t know when the prince inside will leave. This way, we won’t have to guard the surroundings day and Night!”

“Shh, shut up. If the adults inside hear you, be careful of Your Dog Life!”

“Hehe, captain, I’m just complaining. It doesn’t make any difference whether we guard or not. Does anyone else dare to assassinate the Prince? !”

“It’s true that no one dares, but we must do our job well. Don’t be like little Li Zi, who rammed into the Prince and was directly killed!”

“Little Li Zi is indeed unlucky. This matter shouldn’t be his fault, but he was killed directly. Sigh!”

Around the manor, guards patrolled the surroundings. A few guards were chatting softly.

The group of people patrolling was not that strict. This was the manor of the royal family of star-moon kingdom. Who Dared to enter?

Furthermore, whoever dared to assassinate a member of the royal family was simply courting death.

Not only were the city guards outside, but the patrol wasn’t that strict inside the manor as well!

That was because no one dared to enter this place!

“It’s not as strict as I imagined. There are two half-step void interpretation experts resting in the two rooms over there!”

Light rain dripped down from the sky, landing on the roofs and the ground.

At this moment, if there was an expert with a powerful eye-bloodline technique here, they would see the shocking scene in the sky.

Twenty strange demonic beasts floated in the sky.

Half of the demonic beasts in the center were white and half were black. Black and white merged perfectly, making them extremely demonic.

The surrounding demonic beasts with white figures were completely hidden in the darkness.

“Don’t disturb the two half-step void interpretation experts. Kill everyone else. You and I will enter the Central Room!”

Ao Yao’s voice entered the ears of every strange demon.

“Do it!”

When he finished saying these two words, twenty figures quickly flew down.

They were completely silent.

If one looked carefully, they would discover that even raindrops passed through their bodies.

“Pu, Pu, Pu!”

In less than ten seconds, the dozen or so guards that were patrolling outside disappeared.

Their corpses were stored in the interspatial ring.

Each of these guards was at least at rank seven.

There were two rank nine transcendents among them.

When the dozen or so guards disappeared without a trace, ao Yao and a strange demon entered the room in the center.

In the room, there was a huge, soft bed. On the bed, the third Prince was lying in the center.

The strange demon and the others easily entered the room. The black and white strange demon’s eyes fell on the third prince!

Ao Yao raised his eyebrows and looked at the armor beside the bed. His eyes revealed a trace of mockery.

He looked at the strange demon beside him. His figure moved and easily came to the third prince’s side. He gently touched his arm.

Death had arrived!

There was no reaction at all. Even the third prince did not know how he died.

Sleeping in eternal sleep was also a kind of painless death.

Things had far exceeded Ao Yao and the others’expectations. It was too easy!

After the corpse was put away, Ao Yao’s eyes flickered as he looked at the two rooms on his left and right.

There, two half-step void interpretation experts were standing on both sides.

His body moved as darkness invaded and light flashed for judgment!

“Let’s Go!”

A minute later, Ao Yao’s voice was heard by every strange demon.

The group of them moved and flew quickly toward the place where Wang Xian was staying.

“Dragon King, the mission has been completed!”

Three minutes later, Ao Yao’s figure appeared in Wang Xian’s room and reported respectfully.

“So Fast?”

Upon seeing Ao Yao and the rest return, Wang Xian was astonished.

“They are too confident and careless. Although their strength is not bad, their defense is too weak!”

As Ao Yao spoke, she threw the third Prince’s corpse on the ground.

“Is that so?”

A smile appeared on Wang Xian’s face. Looking at the corpse on the ground, the corners of his mouth curled up slightly.

“It seems that the third prince and the rest are too arrogant. They think that they will be 100% safe in their own country!”

Wang Xian looked at the familiar corpse.

During the day, he was extremely arrogant and wanted to kill others. However, he ended up lying here at night!

“Hang his corpse at the East Gate. I want to give everyone in bright moon city a surprise. Also, I want to give Star Moon Kingdom a warning!”

Wang Xian’s eyes flashed with a cold glint.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Ao Yao nodded and kept the corpse.

“Stick this next to him!”

Wang Xian gave ao Yao a piece of red paper that symbolized the dragon spike.

“Yes!”

Ao Yao took it and her figure disappeared quickly. She flew toward the east gate.

“Bright Moon City will be in an uproar tomorrow. Let me show you the madness of the dragon Spike!”

Wang Xian looked at the drizzle outside and said with a smile.
