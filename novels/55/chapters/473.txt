Chapter 474: Treasure! Treasure!

When the five of them heard Wang Xian, they almost choked.

However, they didn’t say a thing. This water attribute martial artist that they had found at the last minute was surprisingly much stronger than they had expected.

“You got the staff from below the pool of lava?” the girl in the middle blinked her eyes and asked.

“Yeah! Just a small staff!”

Wang Xian smiled and turned it in his hands. The staff looked extremely exquisite and the fiery-red lotus on it was as vivid as it could be.

It was entirely red and one could tell that it’s extraordinary with a single look.

“Let’s go!” Wang Xian said to the group. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Hmm.

The group nodded their heads and followed.

“There are three paths right ahead of us. Two of them won’t lead to the side hall. Instead, you will find the demon rearing caves at the end of the path. There are over a thousand fire demons there and death is almost certain if one carelessly enters it!” As they walked ahead, a three-forked road appeared before them. The young man explained this to Wang Xian.

“Fire God Hephaestus had a weird behavior. Based on records, he rarely interacted with people. Instead, he lived with the fire demons. The entire Fire God Palace is filled with fire demons. As long as we follow this path, we will be able to reach the side hall. There are two Dan Realm level fire demons guarding the place. However, we will also likely encounter several dozens of fire demons on the way. We have to kill these fire demons first.”

Perhaps he had noticed that Wang Xian was much stronger than them. Therefore, the young man was explaining it in detail to Wang Xian.

“Two Dan Realm level fire demons? With the strength of your group, I don’t think you guys would make it in!”

Wang Xian took a glance at the five of them and raised an eyebrow.

“We have two plans that are worth a try. However, the outcome isn’t certain!” The young man hesitated for a moment and chose not to hide any further.

“What plans do you guys have?” asked Wang Xian curiously.

“First, we can lead the fire demons away so my sister can get in. Second...”

“The second plan is to use my blood!”

While the young man was explaining, the girl in the middle interrupted.

Huh?

Wang Xian looked at the girl in shock.

“I have the fire seed from the Fire God in me. Therefore, if we can use our blood, Dan Realm fire demons which are smarter might be able to sense it!” the girl said to Wang Xian.

“Fire seed from the Fire God?” Wang Xian was taken aback and showed a shocked expression.

The so-called fire seed could also be interpreted as a bloodline. In other words, she was a descendant of a fire god.

However, a fire seed was also entirely different from a bloodline. Fire seeds were implanted by experts to ensure that their descendants could become powerful fire attribute cultivators.

The seed could trigger the cultivation talents of their descendants.

The fire seed of the Fire God was also the powerful affinity to fire.

“This doesn’t make sense! You are a water attribute cultivator!” Wang Xian stared at the girl and frowned slightly.

“This is because I’m also the descendant of a water god. I’ve triggered the fire seed and water seed in me at the same time!” the girl explained plainly and a flash of helplessness ran through her eyes.

“This... Incredible!”

Wang Xian was a little speechless. The descendant of a Fire God and Water God!

Although this didn’t mean that she was born after a Water God mated with a Fire God, it was still within the last five generations.

In other words, the ancestors of the girl had a Fire God and a Water God within the last five generations.

It wasn’t certain that a fire seed or a water seed could be triggered. This depended on talents, body constitution and luck.

Moreover, they would disappear within five generations.

This girl has triggered the fire seed and the water seed subsequently. That’s extremely rare but water and fire can’t coexist!

“A Water God should be able to erase the fire seed in you?” Wang Xian looked at the girl.

“Among our past ancestors, there was only a single Water God and she passed away!” the young man said with a heavy expression.

“Based on what you guys have said, if there are Dan Realm fire demons in the side hall, there should also be stronger fire demons in the main hall. After you guys get in, what are you guys going to do?” Wang Xian raised an eyebrow and asked inquisitively.

“The stronger the Fire Demon, the more intelligent it is. If the main hall really has a powerful fire demon, it must have lived with the Fire God for a long time. My sister has the fire seed from the fire demon. I believe the Fire Demon won’t harm us. We are looking for the Holy Water that was stolen away by the Fire God. The Holy Water can cleanse away the fire seed in my sister’s body!” the young man said with a heavy expression.

Hmm!

Wang Xian nodded his head. Since the Fire Demon was the slave of the Fire God, it would definitely not harm the descendant of the Fire God. It would be especially so for a descendant that had triggered the fire seed.

“Now it makes sense why you guys dare to come in with your strength. Let’s go,” Wang Xian said to the group and walked ahead.

Within the Fire God Palace, the closer one was to the center location, the hotter the flames would be. Even the surrounding rocks were red.

Although the five of them had reached the Inborn Realm, they still had to resist the heat with all their strength.

“There are so many fire demons along the way!” the young man commented solemnly after seeing what was ahead of him.

“Just follow behind me!” Wang Xian chuckled nonchalantly as he walked ahead with the Fire God Lotus. Ahead of him, several dozen Fire Demons stood in the center.

Above them, lava was dripping off the wall as a result of the heat.

Grrrr, grrr!

When the fire demons noticed Wang Xian and the group, they stared at them with their deep and black eyes. At the same time, they charged towards them and attacked.

Wang Xian waved the Fire God Lotus and several lotus flowers flew ahead. When they contacted the head of the fire demons, their heads were blown away.

“Those must be the effects of the staff. That must at least be a weapon that is above the Inborn Spiritual level!”

The group of five was shocked when they saw how powerful it was.

The girl with a veil looked fervently at the staff in Wang Xian’s hand.

Along the way, all the fire demons were easily killed. Soon, a huge palace appeared before him.

The palace was approximately fifteen meters tall. As compared to the Dragon Palace, the architecture seemed a little rough.

However, it was no less majestic than the most spectacular Treasure Hall.

From time to time, lava would drip from the ceiling, making it look exceptionally breath-taking!

Far away, they could see two five-meter fire demons resting at the center of the side hall.

Around them, there were over a hundred Inborn-level fire demons. At one end of the side hall, there were various fiery-red boxes.

Several weapons were placed casually around and each of these weapons gave off a strong vibe.

On the walls of the palace, a Spiritual Flame Ball the size of a human head was embedded.

Sss. There are so many treasures around. That Spiritual Flame Ball is at least Level 11. As for those weapons that are casually placed, they are all Inborn Spiritual Weapons. How crazy is this!

Wang Xian’s eyes beamed with excitement.

If Inborn Spiritual Weapons were casually placed around and a Level 11 Spiritual Flame Ball was embedded into the wall, those treasures in the box would be even more precious!

This was just one of the nine side halls. There was still the main hall. What kind of treasures would there be in the main hall?

Wang Xian was exhilarated. This was indeed the Fire God’s Graveyard that had attracted lots of elite forces in Asia. The treasures of this place were insane!

“Those two Fire Demons are unbelievably strong. A Dan Realm expert from our family was easily killed by them!”

“After that incident, our family also gave up on the treasures of the Fire God. We are only left with the two plans!”

As the young man looked at the two fire demons, fear gleamed in his eyes as he took a deep breath.
