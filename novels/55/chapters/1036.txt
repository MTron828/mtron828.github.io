Chapter 1037: 1038 former Great Empress (5/10)

Translator: 5496903

“King!”

Three women, a middle-aged man, and four young men quickly walked over and respectfully walked in front of the veiled woman, pretending to kneel down.

“Get Up!”

The old woman next to the veiled woman gently waved her hand, not letting them kneel down.

“Yes, Grand Supreme!”

“Two clan elders, her highness the Little Princess!”

The eight people called out respectfully to the five people one by one.

King!

Grand Supreme!

Clan Elder!

Little Princess!

Just these four titles were absolutely not something that an ordinary clan or aristocratic family could have.

“Go in!”

The veiled woman nodded at them and walked straight towards Eastern Sea city.

The veil only covered the lower half of her face, but looking over, it seemed that her entire face was very hazy.

However, her good figure and extraordinary temperament still made people feel that she was extraordinary.

Chief Yi and the five shopkeepers of Feng Xian looked at the group of people walking over in shock.

They had wanted to go over just now, but they were stopped by the middle-aged man. They were not qualified to know their identities.

“Sir!”

When Chief Yi and the others saw them walking over, they called out respectfully.

“Go in!”

The veiled woman nodded at them and said in a very amiable manner.

“Yes!”

Chief Yi and the others looked at the veiled woman with some curiosity.

Although they were the managers of the Phoenix Immortal in East Sea city, they had never seen the highest level of the Phoenix immortal before.

They only knew that the Phoenix Immortal clan was backed by the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan.

The Fire Cloud Sparrow clan was a top-tier clan that had been passed down for four to five thousand years.

More than a thousand years ago, the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan was at its peak.

The Fire Cloud Sparrow clan became the current Empress’newest personal guard, the first empress since ancient times, and the first empress of the transcendence continent.

In just over ten years, the Phoenix Dynasty had developed from a kingdom to one of the five great empires of the continent.

At that time, it had even suppressed the Dragonman Empire.

At that time, the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan stood at the peak of the continent, and the fire cloud guards resounded throughout the continent.

However, more than a thousand years ago, the Empress disappeared, and the Fire Cloud Guards withdrew from the Phoenix dynasty and lived in seclusion in the fire cloud mountains.

Two years ago, it was rumored that the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan had established the Immortal Phoenix Pill and weapons workshop due to a lack of resources.

If not for the fact that the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan was behind the immortal Phoenix clan, they would have been destroyed by the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop in a dark way.

The two behemoths, life and death and holy items, were also afraid of the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan’s strength.

After all, this was the fire cloud personal guard who had fought with the number one empress of the eternal era on the continent.

“Have you heard? The Han clan, which is ranked third in Donghai City, and the Tang Clan, which is ranked sixth, have decided to hold a disciple competition in three days’time. Through this competition, they will completely resolve their past grudges!”

“Haha, I’ve heard about it. It’s really interesting. The competition between the Han family and the Tang family has been going on for four or five generations. It’s been going on for almost a hundred years. Now that the dragon spike is here, they are going to completely reconcile!”

“They are also afraid. They are also afraid that the other party will hire the dragon spike. If the Han family or the Tang family really hire the dragon spike, then the two big families in Donghai City will have one less!”

“I have to say, the dragon spike is like the scythe of the Grim Reaper. It brings not only darkness, but also peace!”

“You don’t know, but I heard that the town under East Sea city is very harmonious. Since the dragon Spike went over, there have been less conflicts in the whole town than before. Everything has been settled on the Arena!”

“Some people say that when the dragon Spike arrives, it brings darkness, but when the darkness passes, it becomes light!”

“Exactly. Because of the dragon spike, there are new rules established by families. Do you know what the first rule is? It’s to be a good person. Haha, How Interesting!”

When the group entered the city, they heard bustling voices.

However, out of the ten sentences, nine of them were about the dragon spike.

That was because the impact of the dragon Spike on East Sea city was too great!

When the veiled woman heard the words around her, she revealed a hint of curiosity, “What is the dragon Spike?”

“Dragon Spike...”

When a middle-aged woman heard her words, she quickly explained, “Not long ago, the dragon Spike entered an assassin organization in East Sea City. This assassin organization is extremely powerful.”

“They announced their arrival by directly destroying a family with a rank 8 transcendent. The next day, they destroyed another family with a rank 8 transcendent!”

“Once, this dragon Spike assassinated the mayor of Bridge Forest Town under East Sea city. He assassinated him on the street and was extremely arrogant. The next day, the city Lord’s mansion surrounded Dragon Spike and captured two spies of dragon Spike!”

“In the end, that afternoon, the dragon Spike assassinated ten city guards in public. At night, he directly wiped out the Yun family, which had a rank 9 transcendent!” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“The sister of the Yun family’s patriarch married the city Lord, Lei Feihu. On the third day, the dragon Spike assassinated another twenty city guards on the street. This time, everyone saw the city guards being assassinated, but no one made a move!”

“And at that time, City Lord Lei Feihu personally watched from the sky. Even he didn’t discover who made a move!”

The middle-aged woman sorted out the events that had happened in the past few days.

“Oh? To be able to kill a transcendent level 9 expert and kill someone under the surveillance of a void interpretation expert, this dragon spike is not bad!”

A red-haired middle-aged man behind said in surprise.

“It is very strong. It is said that they should be a race of Demon Beasts!”

The middle-aged woman lowered her head and said.

“Race of Demon Beasts? The strongest assassin race of the transcendent continent, the Dark Abyss, is able to assassinate an expert at the void interpretation level. I wonder how big the gap is between this dragon spike and them!”

A trace of curiosity appeared on the red-haired middle-aged man’s face.

“How is the business in Eastern Sea City? How are the preparations for the auction?”

The Veiled Woman’s eyes flickered as she asked indifferently.

“Your Majesty, business in Eastern Sea city is on the right track, and the auction venue has been prepared. However, the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop have been suppressing us. The auction will be held on the same day as us!”

The middle-aged woman immediately replied.

“Increase the publicity for the auction. In addition, spread the word in the other cities in star-moon kingdom that Phoenix immortal will have a half-step void interpretation level pet egg, a void interpretation level weapon, and a piece of armor!”

The middle-aged man said to the middle-aged woman.

“Yes, yes!”

The middle-aged woman hurriedly nodded, her gaze turning to supervisor Yi and the shopkeepers.

“We’ll immediately contact the supervisors of the other cities in star-moon kingdom and have them spread the word with all their might.”

Supervisor Yi and the five shopkeepers revealed shocked expressions.

A half-step void interpretation level pet egg!

What level was this item? It was a rare treasure.

If this pet egg could be hatched and nurtured, it could have the combat strength of a half-step void interpretation level.

To many people, this was a rare treasure!
