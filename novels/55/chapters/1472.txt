Chapter 1473: 1473 above the heartless sword sect

“Lord Sword Master, Save Me!”

When the sect master’s terrified voice rang out in front of the sky high sword sect, everyone had shocked expressions on their faces.

The sect master of the sky high sword sect actually called for help?

“This... this... where are the experts?”

The experts and disciples of the aristocratic families who had fled two to three kilometers away saw the scene and were dumbfounded.

They only looked at the sect master of the towering Sky Sword sect in the middle of the battlefield, their eyes flashing.

There were experts?

With their strength, they did not see the moment ao Yao made his move.

“Huh?”

At the top of the towering sky sword, the movements of the two old men who were playing chess froze slightly.

The two men hurriedly stood up. A dazzling golden light shot out from their eyes and looked down.

“SH * t, the other party’s power is not weak!”

The two of them looked over and did not notice Ao Yao’s figure. However, they saw that the Dharma Idol released by the two hundred weakest third level profound void martial experts covered the disciples of the towering Sky Sword sect.

“Hualala!”

An old man waved his arm. The Chess Pieces on the table were like a sharp sword. They suddenly turned into a giant sword that was ten meters in size. The giant sword attacked downwards at a terrifying speed.

“It’s Too Late!”

The other old man’s expression was a little awkward. His figure moved, and with a flash, his figure disappeared instantly.

“Ah Ah!”

“Run, quickly run!”

At this moment, over 10,000 disciples of the towering Sky Sword sect were directly covered by the bloodless sword.

That strange and sharp long sword instantly pierced through everyone.

The sharp sword was like a poisonous snake, cold and full of killing intent.

More than ten thousand towering sky sword sect disciples were killed or injured by this move.

“Damn you guys, all of you will die today!”

A cold voice filled with coldness came from the sky.

A dazzling golden figure descended from the sky like a sharp sword.

The golden figure looked at the disciples who were more than half dead and injured, and his eyes were slightly red.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

At this time, the chess piece turned into a huge sword and fell toward the ground.

The two hundred golden swordfish were affected by their souls, and they quickly dodged to the surroundings.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

The sharp sword fell into the water and directly penetrated into the ocean, causing a wave of water spray.

“Hiss, at least four to five thousand disciples of the towering Sky Sword sect died under the attack of two hundred experts!”

“The Sword Master of the towering Sky Sword sect has made his move. Among this group of people, I think there are also experts at the seventh level of the profound void tier!”

“Oh my God, today is going to be a great battle!”

Shocked voices came from the surroundings. Everyone raised their heads and looked at the Sword Master who was emitting golden light.

“Hehe, you two arrogant fellows are here!”

“Unfortunately, both of you are going to die!”

“Let me test your strength, Haha!”

When Wang Xian saw the two sword masters who were at level seven of the Seethrough realm flying down from the front and back, a mocking look appeared on his face.

Just now, he saw the two strong swordsmen on the sword tip. However, to his surprise, they did not come down at all. They merely took a glance and continued playing chess.

Their arrogance made Wang Xian feel a little amused.

He laughed out loud and the five elements millstone appeared above his head. It expanded rapidly and went straight for the two swordmasters in the sky.

“Who are you people!”

The two swordmasters who had descended from the towering sky sword peak did not have the time to show off. When they saw Wang Xian coming straight for them and felt the palpitating energy from the five elements millstone, their expressions changed slightly.

“Those who want to kill you!”

Wang Xian moved his body and stood above the five elements millstone. A strong fighting spirit appeared on his face.

Ever since his breakthrough, he had not had a good fight.

Today, he would use the two seventh-level insightful void martial artists to test his strength.

“Roar!”

When he finished his sentence, he let out a dragon’s roar.

Following that, his entire body turned into 80 meters in size.

He crouched in the middle of the five elements grinding mill and stared coldly at the two swordmasters.

“What kind of monster are you? What kind of enmity do you have with our towering sky sword sect?” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

When the two swordmasters, who were thousands of meters in the air, saw Wang Xian suddenly turn into a gigantic figure of 80 meters, their eyes revealed a solemn expression.

“You talk too much nonsense!”

A hint of mockery appeared in Wang Xian’s eyes.

The towering sky sword sect thought that they were invincible and completely ignored Wang Xian. They even interrupted him when he was speaking.

Now, it was the complete opposite.

They really wanted to know when they had provoked such a terrifying force.

However, Wang Xian ignored them.

Since you guys are so overbearing, let’s continue...

“Roar!”

“Dragonnation in Palm!”

Wang Xian did not hesitate at all. With a wave of his Dragon Claw, a dragon claw the size of four kilometers appeared in the sky.

The entire Dragon Claw covered the sky and the Sun. It looked extremely terrifying.

“Seventh level of the Seethrough Realm!”

“You alone want to fight against the two of us? You are courting death!”

One of the swordmasters had an extremely cold expression as he charged towards the sky. Huge swords that were 3,000 meters long appeared around him.

“We Gemini swordmasters have roamed the vast region for 3,000 years. We are unafraid of any enemies. Today, we will definitely behead you!”

The other swordmaster also flew into the sky.

Around him, an identical 3,000-meter-long sword appeared. There were three swords for each of them. There were a total of six!

“Slash!”

The two of them let out a soft cry. The six swords attacked the dragon claw from different angles.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

The sound of collision rang out from the sky. In a short instant, the three of them arrived at a height of 10,000 meters.

Even so, this terrifying collision caused a wave of air to rush downwards.

“Splash!”

The seawater churned like a level 10 tsunami.

“Oh my God, the two sword masters were actually blocked by that young man!”

“Is this... is this the terrifying power of a Level 7 Seethrough void martial artist? The energy that blots out the sky!”

“The towering sky sword sect has encountered a strong enemy today!”

Everyone below had a drastic change in expression when they saw Wang Xian charging straight up and seeing the terrifying aura coming from the sky.

Due to the great grinding of the five elements, they did not see Wang Xian transforming into a divine dragon.

“What?”

The sect master of the towering Sky Sword sect had a drastic change in expression when he saw the two sword masters being blocked in an instant.

The black and White Cross earlier was not released by the young man who went up to the Sword Masters.

“Kill!”

At this moment, ao Jian’s order sounded. He stared at the rest of the towering sky sword sect members emotionlessly, and the sharp sword in his hand trembled.

Dharma Idol, Wuwei sword!

A dazzling golden light enveloped it, covering an area of three kilometers.

A long sword was hidden within like a poisonous snake. Without any hesitation, he directly attacked the ten rank 6 profound void martial experts of the towering sky sword sect.

Behind him, another group of Golden Swordfish also started to move, charging towards the members of the towering Sky Sword sect.

The battle where the guest was the main force made everyone feel as if this was their home ground.
