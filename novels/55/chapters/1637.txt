Chapter 1638: The 1638 Sky Demon was still divided in half

“Then... then what should we do?”

Among the 60,000 people, a dozen middle-aged elders standing in the center said with extremely ugly expressions.

They were the masters of the life and Death Pill Academy and the Holy Item Forging Academy.

“Now we can’t even protect ourselves. If you are worried about your own safety, you can stay here with us. We will protect you!”

Dark Eye patriarch glanced at the two continent-level forces and said in a deep voice.

However, dark eye patriarch’s words immediately made the masters’faces turn ugly.

“Protect us. We’ll give you a huge amount of resources...”

“Alright, if you two super forces don’t need protection, you can directly inform your higher-ups and ask them to send experts to destroy the dragon-phoenix Empire. That way, we’ll be very grateful to you!”

An old man from the life and Death Pill Workshop wanted to say something, but he was immediately interrupted by the Wuji Kingdom’s King.

This time, the one who suffered the greatest loss could be said to be the Wuji Kingdom.

Originally, they had been able to sit firmly on the fishing platform and hang high up. However, because of the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop, they had been dragged into the water.

Now, it was no longer up to them to go ashore.

When the masters of the two major forces heard the indifferent words of the Wuji king, their faces darkened.

“Then we won’t disturb you anymore. Let’s go back to the life and Death Pill Academy!”

The Masters of the life and Death Pill Workshop left with angry faces.

The Masters of the holy item forging workshop hesitated for a moment before leaving as well.

“I don’t believe that the sky demon dares to destroy our life and Death Pill Academy and the Holy Item Forging Academy!”

The Masters said with gloomy faces.

As a continent-level faction, this was the first time they had been humiliated like this!

Usually, even the three super factions were polite to them.

“Let’s go back to Wuji Empire Now!”

Patriarch dark eye glanced at them and said in a deep voice.

“Why don’t you go back to our southern Royal Family!”

Nanhuang Jianghe frowned and said immediately.

“You...”

The faces of the two patriarchs of the Wuji Empire darkened.

“How about this, we will temporarily stay in the ruins of the divine kingdom and build a base in the ruins of the divine kingdom in the future!”

The Supreme Hierarch said from the side.

At this moment, he had restrained his arrogance a lot.

The current solipsistic sect was weaker in front of both the Wuji Empire and the southern royal family.

Not to mention the Dragon and Phoenix Empire.

After he finished speaking, he looked at the mysterious and ancient ruins of the divine kingdom.

If the solipsistic sect wanted to survive, they could only obtain huge opportunities in the ruins of the divine kingdom.

“Alright, our Wuji Empire represents the three superpowers and seeks peace with the dragon and Phoenix Empire!”

Patriarch Dark Eye said with a dark expression.

The Supreme Hierarch and the Southern Royal Family’s two patriarchs nodded with a dark expression.

The 60,000 experts dispersed.

In less than an hour, the news of the expedition spread throughout the ruins of the divine kingdom. It spread to the entire vast region at a terrifying speed.

“The 120,000 experts of the vast region were defeated in the flowing sea region. Half of them were killed or injured. One Patriarch of the Wuji Empire perished!”

“Skyfiend resurrected and suppressed all the patriarchs of the vast region in an invincible manner. Patriarch dark patterns of the Wuji Empire was killed on the spot. Our vast region was defeated!”

“Skyfiend and dragon-phoenix Empire counter-attacked the vast area. In the future, the dragon-phoenix Empire will each occupy a spot in the vast area!”

One by one, news came from the people who had escaped from the war.

One by one, the news completely blew up the entire divine kingdom ruins.

In the beginning, everyone in the divine kingdom ruins had the same thoughts as the people in the north stream sea city.

But when the news reached their ears, everyone’s faces were filled with shock.

Skyfiend was not dead, and he had even suppressed the patriarchs of the three superpowers!

The entire vast region had fled in defeat, and Skyfiend and the dragon-phoenix Empire had returned to attack the vast region!

The Divine Kingdom’s ruins were shaken!

Everyone was shaken.

Especially the news of Skyfiend’s resurrection.

Because of the Sky Demon, the vast region was in turmoil.

Now, because of the Sky Demon, the entire vast region was in turmoil once again.

It was very likely that because of the Sky Demon, the vast region would be changed.

And the news of the three superpowers preparing to seek peace was also spread out. It made everyone open their mouths and were extremely shocked.

This sky was really going to change!

“Wang Xian, Emperor Phoenix, the barbarian goddess, and the Wuji Empire have sent news on behalf of the three superpowers. They want to make peace!” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Early the next morning, a group of higher-ups from the He clan and he Sui clan came over to report.

“Get them to prepare the conditions for making peace. Also, clan leader he, give us a share of the life and death sacred relic and the resources of the Dragon and Phoenix Empire!”

Wang Xian said to them directly.

“Yes, yes. Brother Wang Xian, are you going?”

Clan leader he nodded with a smile and asked curiously.

“Of course, I’m going to collect some interest. I haven’t settled the grudge of them invading our Liuhai Region!”

Wang Xian smiled and flew straight into the sky.

“Emperor Phoenix, do you still need the help of the He clan and he Sui clan?”

The higher-ups of the He clan and he Sui clan asked immediately.

“No need. Oh right, tell the three major forces that we, the Dragon Phoenix Empire, want half of the territory in the vast area!”

Feng Luan said to them and followed closely behind Wang Xian.

“Half of the territory, hiss!”

“The vast area is over a million kilometers. If we take up half of it, the strength of the Dragon Phoenix Empire in the future...”

Everyone from the He clan and he Sui clan was shocked.

“Yesterday, brother Wang Xian said that he wants to dominate the transcendence continent. I wonder...”

At this moment, he yuan, who was at the side, pursed his lips and looked at Wang Xian’s figure with admiration.

To have such a brother in one’s life was truly a blessing that came from eight lifetimes of cultivation!

“Brother Wang Xian is less than 30. He is less than 30 and is at the ninth level of the Seethrough Void Tier. In the future, the Dragon and Phoenix Empire will be the sixth Great Empire!”

The He clan leader said with certainty.

They did not dare to imagine that he could dominate the supernatural continent.

However, they were 80% confident that the dragon and Phoenix Empire could be promoted to an empire.

That was because there was an unprecedented person who was less than 30 years old at the ninth level of the profound void tier. It was destined that there would be no one in the future.

“Let’s go. Our target is Tianyun City!”

In the sky, Lan Qingyue said to Xiao Lan.

Tianyun city was the base of the life and Death Pill Academy and the Holy Item Forging Academy.

The first place they wanted to go was to destroy this place.

“Wu Wu!”

Little Blue swayed his terrifying body and disappeared under the respectful gazes of the He clan and he Sui clan.

When little blue flew in the sky, he passed by many cities and instantly attracted everyone’s attention.

“Tianyun city is right in front of us. The Life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop are at their headquarters in the vast region!”

Five hours later, Tianyun city appeared in their sight.

“Destroy everyone from the two major factions and seize all their pills and weapons!”

Wang Xian looked down at the cities below and gave an order.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

All the powerhouses of the Dragon Palace and the Dragon and Phoenix Empire responded loudly immediately.
