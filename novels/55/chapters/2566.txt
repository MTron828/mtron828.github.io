2567 The Battle of 2567 began

“Rumble!”

“Crackle, Crackle!”

In the void in front of draconic star, fifteen starships stood erect in the Void, a terrifying lightning pillar that was billions of miles long piercing straight into the void!

Purple Lightning flashed across the world, but then, the Lightning pillar slowly split apart, shooting out a terrifying energy!

The lightning pillar slowly spread out, forming a huge lightning net!

The net covered an area of over 100 million km, covering all the planets in front of it!

This terrifying scene was like the destruction of the world!

“Si, this is... This is!”

“Damn, what attack is this, quickly flee!”

“Flee flee flee!”

The undyings that were scattered in the surrounding space almost wet their pants when they saw this terrifying scene, their faces filled with fear as they hurriedly teleported to the side!

The Lightning Net that blotted out the sky fell from the void, as though it tore apart the entire void!

The godly monarchs who were watching the show fled!

“Ka Ka Ka!”

“Plasma fire rain law cannon, Attack!”

At this moment, 15 incomparably huge battleships lined up. They extended their cannon barrels and instantly attacked in front of them!

Boom! Boom! Boom

In an instant, waves of terrifying flame laws, each with a diameter of more than 100 kilometers, pierced through the void and attacked Wang Xian and the rest!

With such a terrifying attack, ten planets would turn into dust in just one round!

“Die!”

Inside the starship, everyone from the ninth-grade heaven sect had a ferocious look on their faces!

They stared excitedly ahead!

The Thunder Net of the ninth-grade sky sect’s sect master and Patriarch required the combined efforts of the Dragon Palace and Chaotic Tiger Demon Country’s two undying godly monarch level seven experts to withstand it!

However, they had withstood the thunder net, while the others could not withstand the starship’s attack!

This terrifying starship could vaporize everything within a billion kilometers!

“This...”

Upon seeing this terrifying energy, everyone from the chaotic Tiger Demon Nation had a drastic change in expression. A hint of fear could be seen in their eyes!

“Dragon King!”

The old national advisor of the Chaotic Tiger Demon Nation let out a low growl and looked at Wang Xian anxiously!

“Don’t Worry!”

Wang Xian looked at this terrifying attack with a smile on his face. He looked at the Heaven Formation at the side!

“Hehe!”

The Heaven Formation smiled casually. Looking at the Lightning Net that was about to descend, the compass in his hand moved slightly!

Buzz Buzz Buzz

In the next moment, everyone felt the space around them tremble. A green light pillar fell towards the stars on both sides and below! Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Buzz Buzz Buzz

Following that, the green light pillar connected to the ten planets. An illusory tree blocked the entire void!

“This is?”

All the experts from the Tiger Chaos Demon Nation looked over and widened their eyes!

“Sky-blotting tree, sky-blotting array!”

Sky Formation divine emperor spat out softly, his face filled with intense confidence!

“Ka Ka Ka!”

At that moment, the terrifying Lightning Web’s attack landed on the illusory tree!

“Weng!”

The entire sky-blotting tree trembled slightly, and the Lightning Web’s energy slowly dissipated!

“What?”

At the same time, on the battleship in the center, the ninth grade Sky sect’s sect master and the ninth grade sky sect’s patriarch saw that their lightning net was blocked, and their expressions changed drastically!

Shock appeared on their faces!

With the support and support of this lightning pillar, the attacks released by the two of them together, even if the other party had two immortal King Level 7 experts, it would be much more difficult to completely block them!

However, the god tree rose up and blocked the attack!

“Rumble Rumble!”

At this time, the 15 battleships’attacks landed, the terrifying attacks exploded in space!

Fiery laws shot out in all directions!

...

The God tree that covered the sky still trembled, it was useless!

“Hiss... how is this possible! ?”

“What... What Kind of defense is this! ?”

Everyone who had fled far away to watch the battle was shocked when they saw how easily the ninth grade sky sect’s attack was blocked!

“How is this possible! ?”

Inside the warship, the experts of the ninth grade sky sect were also shocked!

“It’s a formation! It’s a defensive formation! A powerful defensive formation!”

The eyes of the ninth grade celestial sect’s patriarchs narrowed as they exclaimed in shock!

“Have a taste of the sky-shrouding divine leaf’s Attack!”

On the planet, the sky formation didn’t look surprised at all when it saw this scene. The compass in its hand moved lightly once again!

“Buzz!”

...

In the next moment, the illusory leaves of the sky-shrouding divine tree slowly condensed, each of them emitting an incomparably sharp luster!

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

When the divine leaves condensed, countless divine leaves directly attacked the fifteen battleships in the void ahead!

The green leaves emitted a terrifying sharpness, and the entire space was torn apart!

“Oh no, defend, defend, immediately defend!”

Seeing the endless green sharp leaves, everyone from the ninth grade sky sect had faces full of shock, and immediately roared loudly!

“Crack! Crack! Crack!”

The fifteen battleships immediately raised their powerful defenses. In front of the battleships, a defensive metal plate that was a million kilometers thick extended out!

“Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!”

However, in the next moment, densely packed attacks landed on the battleships. It was like the terrifying impact of a secret manual’s freezing point!

“Bang! Bang! Bang!”

The terrifying attack of the secret manual caused the entire battleship to tremble violently!

“Beep! Beep! Beep!”

“The battleship is damaged by 50% !”

“The battleship is damaged by 30% !”

“The battleship is about to collapse. All personnel, please evacuate immediately. All personnel, please evacuate immediately!”

An ear-piercing sound rang out. The incomparably powerful battleship didn’t last a minute!

“Everyone, leave the battleship. Everyone, leave the battleship!”

The ninth grade sky sect’s sect master’s expression changed drastically, and he immediately ordered loudly!

“Sou Sou Sou!”

Within the battleship, a million ninth grade sky sect’s experts and disciples hurriedly fled towards the rear!

“Peng!”

Just as everyone had escaped, the fifteen battleships directly collapsed, disintegrating into pieces!

“How could this be!”

All the ninth grade sky sect’s disciples and experts looked at the scene in front of them with faces full of shock!

From their point of view, when they arrived in front of the Dragon Star, a round of attacks could destroy their star!

However, the defense of the dragon star easily blocked their attacks. Instead, the fifteen battleships were easily destroyed by the other party!

“Damn, the other party might have an array grandmaster that can fight against an undying godly monarch level 7!”

The expressions of some ninth grade sky sect undying godly monarch experts changed slightly!

Only a powerful array master could set up such a terrifying array!

A powerful array master setting up an array in advance was very abnormal!

“Weng Weng Weng!”

At this time, the AI of the sect leader of the grade 9 Sky clan was trembling. He was slightly shocked and immediately opened it to take a look!

“Not good, over 500 undying God kings are attacking our grade 9 Sky clan’s commercial planet. Many undying God kings are wreaking havoc on our commercial planet!”
