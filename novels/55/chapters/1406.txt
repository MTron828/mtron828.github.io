Chapter 1407: 1407 Xiaoyao city was destroyed

“It’s over, it’s over, it’s over!”

“Don’t kill me, don’t kill me, Our dynasty is willing to submit to the dragon-phoenix Dynasty, don’t Kill Me!”

“Our Jin Liang dynasty is willing to submit, don’t Kill Us!”

The moment a rank 5 void interpretation realm expert was killed in Xiaoyao City, the void interpretation realm experts fighting with the Dragon Palace in the sky fell into despair.

The dynasties had been fighting with the members of the Dragon Palace carefully from the beginning. Among them, the death rate was the fewest.

Now that they saw this situation, these fence-sitters understood that if they did not submit, they would definitely die.

After they died, their dynasties would be trampled to death by the experts of the Dragon and Phoenix Dynasties!

The experts of the dynasties quickly begged the members of the Dragon Palace for mercy!

More than a dozen insightful void realm experts huddled together, bowed, and begged the members of the Dragon Palace who were surrounding them with unsightly expressions.

At this moment, they did not have the dignity of an expert at all.

Facing the nearly one hundred insightful void realm experts who were surrounding them, they did not dare to retain the slightest bit of dignity!

“Boom!”

“Kneel down and wait for your punishment!”

Right at this moment, a huge ocean-pacifying needle swept across the void, carrying a terrifying might.

Ao Qitian’s 10-meter-tall figure stood in the air, holding the ocean-pacifying needle god in his hand. He was like a wild and mighty general, glaring at all of them!

“Yes, yes!”

“We’ll kneel, we’ll kneel!”

The expressions of the dynasty experts changed drastically. They gritted their teeth and flew down.

Plop

A rank 3 void interpretation expert knelt on the ground.

A crack appeared on the solid ground. The expert lowered his head and knelt there helplessly!

“Plop!”

“Plop!”

The experts knelt on the ground. They were all lords, ministers, and generals of the dynasty. They were all prisoners!

Below, the members of the Fire Hammer clan looked at the experts kneeling on the ground!

These people were all high and mighty existences.

In the past, when they faced this group of experts, they didn’t dare to look directly at them and just bowed!

Now, they were all kneeling in front of them, waiting for their judgement.

“We surrender too, we surrender too!”

When the experts from the aristocratic families in Xiaoyao city saw this scene, they also shouted with faces full of fear.

“Kill the people in Xiaoyao City. After today, there will be no Xiaoyao city in the world!”

However, ao Qitian’s violent voice greeted them!

“Roar Roar Roar!”

The Demon Monkey roared and continued the slaughter!

After surrendering to more than a dozen insightful void realm experts, only a dozen or so insightful void realm experts in Xiaoyao City were killed.

Among them, three fourth-level insightful void realm experts were struggling bitterly, their faces full of despair.

“Kill!”

Another sound of killing rang out. This time, the three hundred profound void martial stage experts of the Dragon Palace swarmed forward.

Drowned!

The last dozen or so profound void martial stage experts of Xiaoyao City were directly drowned by terrifying attacks!

In the entire Xiaoyao City, tens of millions of people raised their heads to watch this great battle.

They looked at the profound void martial stage experts of Xiaoyao City who were drowned.

One round of attacks, just one round of attacks. The remaining dozen or so figures fell to the ground.

Below them, all the elite disciples of the noble families of Xiaoyao City had long been turned into corpses.

Almost ten thousand corpses covered the surroundings.

This battle lasted less than ten minutes.

A great victory, a complete victory. Everyone even found that none of the members of the Dragon Palace had died.

“Hiss!”

The ordinary people in Xiaoyao City looked over with awe on their faces. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

At this moment, the entire Xiaoyao City fell silent.

“Endless wind and clouds, hundred swords returning to the sect!”

At this moment, a violent voice came from the sky.

Everyone raised their heads and looked at the sky.

In their sight, the city lord of Xiaoyao city was floating in the sky, his clothes fluttering even though there was no wind.

Behind him, dazzling longswords were rotating slowly behind him.

As the mayor of Xiaoyao City, all 100 flying swords were at the profound void realm.

The profound void realm longswords were paired with the dharma idol of the fifth level of the profound void realm.

The mayor of Xiaoyao City unleashed his most dazzling attack!

“SWOOSH SWOOSH SWOOSH!”

“Kill!”

The longswords were slowly covered by the energy of the wind attribute. Each longsword was about 1,000 meters long.

Over 100 longswords that were 1,000 meters long, looked from afar and were filled with a shocking power!

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

The moment the longswords attacked, the five divine dragons let out a roar on the enormous five elements grinding mill in the sky.

They galloped on the grinding mill, and streams of energy of the five elements revolved endlessly.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

The longswords landed on the mill one after another.

“The ultimate of Earth, Defense!”

Wang Xian shouted softly.

“Roar!”

On the mill of the five elements, the Earth God Dragon Roared. The entire mill of the five elements emitted a thick and heavy aura as it withstood the attacks of the sharp swords.

“Roar!”

The mill of the five elements trembled slightly under the attacks. When the last sharp sword landed on it, Wang Xian roared.

His fifty-meter-long body charged straight at the mayor of Xiaoyao City.

Under the sunlight, his dragon scales were shimmering with a luster. He had sharp dragon claws, a majestic dragon head, and a huge dragon tail.

“Divine Dragon Tail Swing!”

Wang Xian swept his dragon tail horizontally and charged straight at the mayor of Xiaoyao City with a terrifying force.

“Carefree wind!”

The mayor of Xiaoyao City roared and dodged to the side!

“Can you dodge it?”

“Five elements restraint!”

A five-colored radiance shot out from Wang Xian’s eyes. With a wave of his dragon claws, waves of restraining force surrounded him.

“Not good!”

The mayor of Xiaoyao City was horrified. The thick wind attribute energy on his body formed an incomparably huge wind shield.

Boom

However, when Wang Xian’s dragon tail landed on it, the wind shield collapsed at a terrifying speed.

In close combat, the divine dragon was no weaker than any race.

“Bang!”

The terrifying strength caused the body of the mayor of Xiaoyao City to transform instantly. His expression changed drastically as blood spurted out from his mouth.

“It’s over, it’s over. I’m not resigned to this. Just you wait, I’ll come for Revenge!”

The mayor of Xiaoyao City had a look of fear in his eyes. His gaze swept across the area below and his expression changed drastically.

His body moved and he let out a roar before he flew towards the back.

“You are too naive to think of leaving!”

Buzz

Wang Xian looked at the mayor of Xiaoyao City who was escaping. The five elements millstone above him trembled slightly and charged forward with a terrifying force.

Boom

The five elements millstone carried a terrifying force and landed directly on the mayor of Xiaoyao City!

“Ah!”

He roared in pain as his body tried to break free from the five elements millstone.

However, the five elements millstone, which was about two kilometers in circumference, pressed against his ant-like body and crashed forward.

“Boom!”

An extremely shocking sound was heard.

“Crack Crack Crack!”

At this moment, everyone watched in horror as the five elements Millstone crashed into a mountain peak 10,000 meters behind Xiaoyao City.

The mountain slowly cracked open!

It slowly collapsed!
