Chapter 3147: At the Hongmen banquet

At that time, due to the arrogance of venerable Lou Shan and the rest and the dragon seed of the Halberd Dragon Guard, Wang Xian and the rest killed him. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

The Dragon Palace had already considered the consequences of killing the venerable of the ancient painting sect.

The ancient painting sect was very powerful. There were dozens of universe knights in the sect.

Furthermore, the sect had a level 3 universe knight.

With such power, they were stronger than the current Dragon Palace.

However, the ancient painting sect didn’t know who killed Luo Shan Knight.

But with the death of a powerful deputy sect leader, the ancient painting sect might have powerful treasures that could find some clues.

If they attended this banquet, it might be a banquet.

If they didn’t attend, the ancient painting sect would suspect the Dragon Palace even more.

After all, in the Milky Way, there weren’t many forces that could kill a level two universe knight.

The Dragon Palace had just exterminated the dragon race, so they obviously had the ability.

“How’s the situation on Lei Ming’s side?”

Wang Xian looked at Prime Minister Gui and asked.

“Dragon King, Lei Ming’s ability should be able to reach level three universe knight in the next few days.”

“As for being stronger, our Dragon Palace doesn’t have enough resources.”

Prime Minister Gui said.

“Alright, Lei Ming and I will go to the banquet in ten days.”

Wang Xian said directly.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Prime Minister Gui nodded his head.

Wang Xian had the eight luminaries dragon scale which could conceal and change his aura. Lei Ming had just joined the Dragon Palace.

Even if they had some treasures, they wouldn’t be able to find out that the human dragon palace had killed him.

Time passed day by day.

The arrival of the two universe knights from the ancient painting sect didn’t attract much attention from the other races.

After the Dragon Palace responded to the goodwill of some forces on the AI, the Milky Way also calmed down.

Rumble

Crackle

Five days later, in the sky above the dragon transformation pool, a lightning dragon swayed its huge body and emitted a terrifying power of lightning punishment.

The Thunder and lightning flashed in the sky above the dragon transformation pool and emitted a tremendous pressure.

Wang Xian’s figure moved and came to the front of the dragon transformation pool. He looked at Lei Ming and smiled.

The Thunder Dragon was a thunder dragon with the combat strength of a level three universe knight.

He was now the strongest combat strength member of the Dragon Palace.

“Greetings, Dragon King!”

Lei Ming flew to the front of Wang Xian and transformed into his human form. He knelt in front of him with a respectful expression and bowed excitedly.

“Get Up!”

“Let Prime Minister GUI show you around the Dragon Palace.”

Wang Xian nodded.

“Hehe, let’s go. You will be a part of the Dragon Palace from now on.”

Prime Minister Gui smiled and showed him around the Dragon Palace.

The addition and improvement of Lei Ming was a significant boost to the strength of the Dragon Palace.

While Lei Ming was improving, the Dragon Palace had also increased the combat strength of ten universe knights at the first level.

The resources of the dragon-descendant race were gradually depleted.

This time, half of the resources of the dragon-descendant race were used on Lei Ming.

Time passed day by day. The Dragon Palace destroyed the dragon-descendant race in a domineering manner. The goodwill of the primary races in the Milky Way also caused the other sub-dragon races in the Milky Way who were watching to rush towards the Dragon Palace.

In just a short span of 10 days, the Dragon Palace had added over 3,000 members.

“Lei Ming, get ready. Follow me out.”

On this day, Wang Xian had finished settling some matters in the Dragon Palace. He looked at the time and called Lei Ming over.

“It’s the Dragon King. I can set off at any time!”

Lei Ming replied respectfully.

“Alright, let’s go.”

Wang Xian nodded and flew out.

“Dragon King, I’ll take you with me.”

Lei Ming’s body moved and transformed into the body of a thunder dragon. He flew to Wang Xian.

Wang Xian smiled and nodded his head.

Lei Ming retracted the Thunder on his body and flew toward the edge of the Milky Way at a terrifying speed.

The Thunder Dragon, which could match the combat strength of a venerable at level three, was much faster than Wang Xian’s speed.

Its body size of over 10,000 meters shuttled through the Milky Way. It contained an incomparably terrifying pressure.

After more than ten hours, they arrived at the edge of the Milky Way.

“The time is just right. Let’s enter the continent ahead.”

Wang Xian looked at the time and pointed at the Wangyin continent ahead.

The Wangyin continent belonged to the foggy race and was also the base camp of the foggy race.

It was the largest continent beside the Milky Way.

This time, the place where the two experts from the ancient art sect held a banquet was within the Wangyin continent.

Lei Ming shrunk his body size to about ten meters. His huge body swayed as he carried Wang Xian and continued to fly forward.

“Eh? What’s that? Is that a divine dragon?”

“It’s exactly the same as the legendary divine dragon. Hiss, there’s someone up there.”

“It should be someone from the Dragon Palace. I heard that a big faction tens of thousands of light years away from us is hosting a banquet for all the major races here.”

When Lei Ming brought Wang Xian into the sky above the Wangyin continent.

When some people saw it, they were astonished and started to discuss.

“Over there. Let’s go over.”

Wang Xian looked at the map and instructed Lei Ming, who was located above a huge lake on the Wangyin continent.

Lei Ming’s gaze swept across the area below. He landed on a spot and flew straight over.

At this moment, beside the lake, it was decorated luxuriously. There were many elders chatting with smiles below.

With a glance, there were more than a dozen universe knights.

“The ancient painting sect is quite famous. Basically, all of them are here.”

Wang Xian looked over.

“Eh?”

“This is?”

When Wang Xian and the rest flew over, everyone below noticed them and looked over with sparkling eyes.

“It’s the people from the Dragon Palace!”

“That should be the Dragon King!”

“Is that a purebred divine dragon? It’s exactly the same as the legendary Divine Dragon.”

They looked over and whispered.

A few elders came over to welcome them.

“This must be the Dragon King, right? Hello!”

A few elders at the level of universe knights came over and greeted them politely.

“Yes, Hello Everyone!”

Wang Xian landed on the ground and replied politely. Lei Ming, who was beside him, transformed into his human form.

“I’ve long heard of your great name, Dragon King. It’s my honor to meet you today.”

The few elders continued to smile as if they were flattering him.

“Are all the races from the Milky Way here this time? It’s a good opportunity to get to know all of you.”

Wang Xian smiled politely.

“Other than the foggy race, the skeleton race, and the two experts from the ancient painting sect, all the other races are here.”

A venerable from the water shadow race replied immediately.

“The people from the ancient painting sect aren’t here yet?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows. As the initiator of the banquet, he wasn’t here yet.

Hehe, as expected, he was still very arrogant.

“He should be here soon. Dragon King, come and sit.”

A few venerables invited him enthusiastically.

With the current strength of the Dragon Palace, it could definitely be ranked in the top three in the Milky Way.

Therefore, the venerables were also very enthusiastic and respectful.

“Alright, thank you, everyone.”

Wang Xian nodded and walked inside.

Buzz Buzz Buzz

At this moment, a few figures shrouded in black robes appeared at the side.

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly and looked over immediately.
