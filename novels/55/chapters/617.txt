Chapter 618: Return (1)

“I’m the Dragon King of the Dragon Sect from the real world. Let me give you a piece of advice. When Yong Chang world descends into the real world, keep a low profile and don’t offend me!”

“Feng Family, Ao Family, Dong Family, Liang Family... step forward to receive your judgement!”

Wang Xian’s voice reverberated across a radius of ten kilometers as he stared coldly at the people before him.

Rumble!

At the same instant he spoke, a terrifying water shockwave appeared in the sky above the entire water region. That catastrophic energy sent chills down the spines of all disciples and Elders from the three Immortal Sects.

Hong Yan stared harshly at Wang Xian and Roving Sword. However, he was fearful of taking action.

There were several hundreds of thousands of disciples around and most of them had not even reached the Inborn Realm. If he had taken action, their attacks would have caused the deaths of these hundreds of thousands of disciples.

These disciples formed the foundation of Yong Chang world and he was fearful of wrecking it.

Around Wang Xian, everyone was extremely solemn and didn’t dare to say a word. They stared at Wang Xian and Roving Sword with fear and trepidation.

“Feng Family, Ao Family, Dong Family, Liang Family... Step forward now!”

Wang Xian’s emotionless voice sounded once again. He looked across the crowd and found that no one was responding.

Boom!

Wang Xian waved his arm and the terrifying water shockwave charged towards the Elders of the Immortal Slaying Sect.

“No...!”

The twenty-odd Elders of Immortal Slaying Sect were astonished and immediately fled with horror.

Bam! Bam!

Yet, that unmatched energy still fell on the bodies of five Elders.

Instant total annihilation!

While they were in the region of the terrifying Great Waterfall Water Shockwave, their bodies couldn’t withstand terrifying attacks from an Immortal.

“If no one is stepping forward, I’ll just have to kill everyone here!”

Wang Xian looked emotionlessly across the crowd and remarked coldly.

“No, no...”

Wang Xian’s words had instilled greater fear into the crowd.

Immortal! They were now facing an Immortal!

Moreover, there were two of them! If the two of them wished to kill them, they would be able to do so with just a wave of their hands.

“Those from these families step forward right now. Don’t implicate others!”

An Elder from Yong Chang Immortal Sect spoke bitterly and softly.

Looking at the circumstances, it was clear that the Dragon King would want to kill those from these families.

Since they had offended the Immortal, they had to pay the price!

“No... No... Don’t kill us! Don’t kill us!”

At this moment, those from the Feng Family, Ao Family and ten other forces could feel the gazes from the surrounding crowd. Instantly, desperation filled their faces.

They would have never expected that they would still be killed when Hong Yan Excellency was around.

The members from these ten-odd forces were filled with despair. They had offended an Immortal!

The terrifying Immortal!

Boom!

At this moment, the entire sky was dyed red. This created a stark contrast with the blue water region that spanned ten kilometers.

Above the water region, two figures stood like blinding suns in the air.

“Yao Yang, Eclipse!”

Hong Yan lifted his head and saw the two figures forming in the sky. He instantly shouted.

Two other Immortals from Yong Chang Immortal Sect had appeared.

“Yao Yang Excellency and Eclipse Excellency are here! Two more Immortals are here. We are saved. We are saved! We have three Immortals on our side. The Dragon King and Roving Sword would definitely dare not make a move now!”

“Three Immortals against two. Things are going to get tough for the Dragon King and his subordinate! With other Immortals from our Yong Chang world here, even the Dragon King and Roving Sword will die in this place!”

“The Dragon King and Roving Sword have to die!”

Seeing the appearance of the two Immortals, those from the ten-odd families were beaming with excitement.

The appearance of the two Excellencies would mean that they wouldn’t have to die!

Mmm!

The two of them stood in the sky and stared right at Wang Xian and Roving Sword with solemn expressions.

“Are you the Dragon King? Let’s end this here and not push it too far!”

A figure stared at Wang Xian and commented coldly.

“Haha! I’ll stop right after I kill those I want to kill!”

Seeing the arrival of the two Immortals, Wang Xian laughed out loud and waved his arm.

Within the Great Waterfall Water Shockwave, terrifying water shockwaves were launched towards various people.

A while ago, he could roughly verify who were from these ten-odd families through the eyes of the rest.

“What? No! No! Yao Yang Excellency! Eclipse Excellency! Save us! Save us....!”

The disciples from these ten-odd families were filled with despair and they cried for help in horror.

When the two figures saw the Dragon King continuing to attack, they frowned and were clearly discontented.

They couldn’t stop and wouldn’t be able to.

Around them, several hundreds of thousands of disciples watched the development with fear.

Despite the arrival of two other Immortals, the Dragon King still did what he wanted. This was undoubtedly equivalent to taunting their entire Yong Chang world.

“Haha! It’s been close to two months since I came into Yong Chang. It’s about time for me to return. Let’s meet again in the real world!”

After the water shockwave, Wang Xian laughed out loud and looked across the three Immortals.

“Let’s go!”

He shouted at Roving Sword. The next instant, both of them turned illusory and flew towards the East at incredible speed.

“Remember my warning! When you enter the real world, keep a low profile!” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

The Dragon King’s voice reverberated through the sky.

The Great Waterfall Water Shockwave dissipated.

And the despondent atmosphere was gone.

“They have headed East!”

“The spirit array in that direction is the weakest. It would appear that they wanted to head out!”

“The attacks of the current spirit array would simply damage them severely and not kill them!”

The voices of the three Immortals sounded and the three of them stared bitterly in the direction where Wang Xian and Roving Sword had fled in.

“The spirit array has been broken and they have left!”

After ten seconds of silence, the fire sparks that were flickering in Hong Yan’s eyes disappeared and he commented.

Yao Yang and Eclipse remained silent and looked across the disciples below them.

Swish swish swish!

At this moment, figure after figure arrived at incredible speed.

“What’s the matter? Why were there Immortal-level attacks coming from here a while ago?”

“Hong Yan, what happened?”

The other three figures stood in the sky, frowning as they asked these questions.

“There were two Immortals from the outside world. One of them is called the Dragon King while the other was Roving Sword. They killed some of our people!” Hong Yan remarked as his eyes flickered. The next moment, he gestured to Xiaoxiao.

“Uncle Yan!”

Xiaoxiao flew over and greeted him softly.

“Immortals from the real world? There are still immortals from the real world?”

The other three men were shocked.

“Greetings, uncles. Those two have likely advanced to the Immortal Realm in our world!”

Xiaoxiao bowed at the group of Immortals and reported respectfully. Fear and respect filled her eyes.

“Huh? Advancing to the Immortal Realm in our world?”

The rest of the Immortals were taken aback and had their attention fixed on Xiaoxiao.

“Yep!”

Xiaoxiao nodded her head before continuing, “I saw him when I went to the real world. His name is Wang Xian and he should be twenty-one years old in the current year. He has risen in an exceptionally short period of time and established the Sacred Sect, Dragon Sect, in the real world!”
