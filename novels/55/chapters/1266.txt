“I have over 260 million dragon crystals. I still need 700 million more to level up!”

Wang Xian looked at his attributes and smiled. He had made the right decision to come to the demi-human graveyard this time.

His strength had increased by dozens of times compared to before.

“Go Back!”

Wang Xian moved and flew directly to the exit of the training ground.

In two days, he had swept through the entire training ground.

In the entire training ground, only a few weak ferocious beasts, Wang Xian, did not make a move. The rest had already been slaughtered.

It could be said that the entire training ground would not be able to return to its previous state without a hundred years.

Wang Xian did not feel guilty about this at all. He did it by relying on his own strength, not by descending.

When he came out of the trial grounds, he looked around with a stunned expression.

There was no one around the trial grounds.

“It seems that the experts from the blood flow empire have been killed, causing everyone to temporarily give up on the trial grounds!”

Wang Xian thought to himself. With a move of his body, he flew towards the outer area of the human-demon graveyard.

When he returned to his residence, he immediately continued to study the combination skills of the four attributes.

He moved his arm and five spirit pearls appeared in front of him. Using the energy of the five elemental spirit pearls, he began to practice.

With the help of the five elemental spirit pearls, it was much easier to study the combination of the four attributes than before.

“The combination of the four attributes can only be metal, wood, water, fire, earth, metal, wood, fire, earth, water, fire, and earth at most. The Battle of the Earth is a combination of the four attributes of wood, water, fire, and earth...”

Wang Xian stayed in the room and immersed himself in the research of the attributes.

Buzz! Buzz

After an unknown period of time, a voice came from the communication stone plate at the side.

He heaved a sigh of relief and stood up. He picked up the communication stone plate at the side and took a look. He saw that it was a message from Long Xiaotian.

It was not a big deal. Instead, he invited him to have a drink.

“Let’s go out and relax. It seems like I have never rested since I came to the tomb of the demi-human!”

Wang Xian revealed a faint smile. He looked at the time and realized that five days had passed.

During these five days, Wang Xian did not manage to come up with four types of combined attribute attacks.

However, it was not as if he had gained nothing during these five days.

His control and understanding of attributes had deepened.

Wang Xian had a hunch that it would not be long before he could comprehend four types of combined attribute combat techniques.

Walking out of the courtyard, Wang Xian looked to the side and realized that Ling Jian ‘er was not there.

The people from the Heavenly Sword sect came to pick her up that day. They should be returning to the Heavenly Sword sect

Wang Xian thought to himself. His body moved and he flew towards the direction of the hiring association.

Ling Yun restaurant was the largest and most famous restaurant in the graveyard of demi-humans. It was the property of the bloodshed empire.

“Brother Wang Xian, come here, come here!”

When Wang Xian arrived at the top floor, Long Xiaotian’s warm voice was heard. He looked over and saw him sitting with five middle-aged young men.

Wang Xian walked over with a smile.

The few people beside Long Xiaotian looked at Wang Xian with curiosity in their eyes.

“Brother Long Xiaotian, is this your good friend?”

A chubby young man sitting opposite long Xiaotian looked at Wang Xian with a smile and sized him up curiously.

“That’s right, this is my good friend!”

Long Xiaotian laughed out loud and waved at Wang Xian. “Brother Wang Xian, let me introduce you to a few friends!”

“This is manager Qian from the third largest trading company in the world. These two are his assistants. This is captain Bei of the beiming mercenary group. This is heaven’s Pride Xiao Shikong!”

Long Xiaotian introduced them to Wang Xian one by one.

“Hello, everyone!”

Wang Xian nodded politely.

“Oh? I didn’t expect that there would be such an outstanding young man like brother Wang in such a small empire like the dragon and Phoenix Empire!”

The slightly plump young man, manager Qian, looked at Wang Xian with a smile and said.

“HMM?”

Wang Xian looked at him and was slightly stunned.

“Brother Wang Xian, don’t mind him. This manager Qian’s news has spread throughout the entire Liuhai region. Isn’t the third largest trading company in the world undeserved? Their business has even reached the level of the Demon Beasts!”

Long Xiaotian saw that Wang Xian was stunned and quickly explained.

Wang Xian nodded his head lightly. From Long Xiaotian’s attitude, he could tell that this chubby young man’s identity was not simple.

However, Wang Xian didn’t mind and sat beside Long Xiaotian.

“Tell me, after the bridge of Heaven’s pride opens, how many people will win the battle between the Heaven’s pride and the Demon Race?”

“It’s hard to say, but one thing is for sure. The Supreme Heaven’s pride is definitely from the Demon Beast Race. The Demon Beasts in the trial grounds are simply too terrifying!”

“Yeah, they’re too strong. Currently, no one dares to take a single step into the training grounds. The Battle of the Heaven’s Pride Bridge this time is not an objective one!”

After Wang Xian sat down, he heard discussions coming from the seats beside him.

“Oh right, brother Wang Xian, are you interested in going to the Battle of the Heaven’s Pride Bridge two days from now? I missed the battle between the nameless sword demon and Qian ye the last time. I Won’t miss it this time!”

Long Xiaotian looked at Wang Xian and asked with a smile.

“The day after tomorrow? I might not have time on the day after tomorrow. I did watch the battle between the nameless sword demon and Qian Ye!”

Wang Xian shook his head and lied.

“There’s no need to watch the battle this time. The humans are definitely one-sided!” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Manager Qian, who was sitting opposite him, suddenly spoke.

“HMM? Manager Qian, do you have any news?”

Long Xiaotian raised his eyebrows and asked in surprise.

“In the training ground, a human expert entered the training ground through a special method and killed hundreds of demonic beasts. Now, the entire Demonic Beast clan is extremely furious!”

“All the heaven’s pride demonic beasts swore to kill the Human Heaven’s pride. Moreover, the demonic clan gave those heaven’s pride demonic beasts a lot of resources in order to take revenge!”

Manager Qian raised his wine glass and took a sip. “In my opinion, the Top Ten Heaven’s favorites of the human race are no match for the Top Ten Heaven’s favorites of the Monster Race!”

As he spoke, he glanced at Xiao Shikong beside him with slight disdain in his eyes. “I advise this brother not to participate, or he might die there!”

“What?”

Xiao Shikong’s pupils constricted, and a shocked expression appeared on his face.

Even Long Xiaotian was slightly surprised!
