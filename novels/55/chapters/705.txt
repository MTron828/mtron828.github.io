“Wow brother, the Jianghu website has been revised. It’s actually divided into eight regions!”

“Xuanyuan, Ji, Huang, Yao, shun, Tang, Xia, and Yongchang. Each region has its own individual information. We actually belong to Shun’s region!”

“Now, jianghu is also divided into eight regions. Each ding world occupies a region, and this region includes cities.”

“Our Jiang city is under the jurisdiction of the Shun Ding world. The Ming King Immortal sect and the puppet immortal sect are the most powerful existences in this region!”

“A hundred kilometers north of our Jiang City is the Shun Ding world, which is the size of four or five cities in our Jiang City!”

“It has changed. Our world has completely changed. Martial arts have entered the school. Now, it basically belongs to the era where all the people are martial artists!”

Xiao Yu’s exclamations could be heard from the hall of the villa.

“Let me take a look!”

Wang Xian walked to Xiao Yu’s side and looked through all sorts of information over the past year together.

All the immortal sects coexisted peacefully. The immortal-level powerhouses were prohibited from taking action.

The immortal-level powerhouses gave the order to forbid killing ordinary people.

Numerous messages flashed past their eyes. Wang Xian and Xiao Yu opened up the posts one by one and read them.

After the emergence of the Nine Cauldrons and the emergence of world after world, the inevitable conflicts had led to many large-scale battles.

This was especially so during the period of seven months ago. Due to some conflicts, the immortal sect continued to fight. The entire jianghu was in a bloody state.

The ordinary disciples of the immortal sect were killed and the elite disciples came out to take revenge.

In the end, the deacons and elders of the immortal sect were drawn out.

Thus, some large-scale battles took place.

In particular, when one of the heaven’s favored disciples of the immortal sects was killed, the immortal god was enraged and killed the core disciples of the other side.

When one immortal sect’s immortal God made a move, the other side naturally retaliated.

There might be some difference in strength between the immortal sects, but it could not completely suppress them.

When the immortal God made a move, it would cause a battle between the immortal gods.

Seven months ago, a total of three immortal God battles took place. Each time, the sun and Moon lost their light, and the terrifying sounds of battle resounded throughout the entire jianghu.

The entire Eastern mountain range became a 10,000-meter-long pit under the immortal God’s battle.

Later, in the Xuanyuan tripod world, the Xuanyuan clan and the Yuwen clan made an agreement with the immortal sects that immortal god-level experts were not allowed to make a move. Once they violated the agreement, they would be punished by all the immortal sects.

Finally, the immortal sects sat down to discuss.

The entire jianghu of China was divided into eight regions. The surroundings of one cauldron occupied a region.

The jianghu gradually calmed down and began to integrate into the real world.

The appearance of the new world caused a huge uproar on the internet. It took two whole months for the people of China to accept the New World.

However, the appearance of martial arts made all the ordinary people of China extremely excited. Everyone wanted to become an expert who could leap over roofs and walk over walls.

Since those immortal sects had entered the real world, they were also prepared to integrate into it.

The people in the real world learned martial arts while the people in the eight tripod world learned modern knowledge.

After five months of integration, the embryonic form of the new world had been finalized.

Science and technology coexisted with martial arts. The martial arts world had also entered the world of the ordinary people.

All the schools had set up a martial arts course to strengthen the body.

In short, the current jianghu was not as bad as Wang Xian had imagined. There were still battles and frictions, but there was already an initial order.

“Xiao Yu, tomorrow, we will visit some of our fellow disciples from Thorn sect. Now, they have joined the Yellow Heaven Immortal sect!”

“Alright, Brother. Are you coming with us?”

Xiao Yu looked at Wang Xian and asked him.

“No, you guys go ahead. Bring some DRAKONIDS and demons over. I’ll go to School Tomorrow!”

Wang Xian shook his head and said to him.

“School? I want to go back to school too. I haven’t even completed my university career for a year!”

Xiao Yu pouted and said unhappily.

“Hehe!”

Wang Xian smiled and looked at Lan Qingyue and Sun Lingxiu. “What about you guys? Where are you going tomorrow?”

“I’m going home. I’ve already told my parents!”

“I’m going to the Divine Dragon Medical Center to check on the medical center and see if Xiao Hong is slacking off!”

Lan Qingyue and Sun Lingxiu said.

“Alright, let’s eat and sleep. We’ll go for a Stroll Tomorrow!”

Wang Xian said with a smile.

“Woof Woof!”

Suddenly, the sound of a dog barking could be heard. Following that, a two-meter-tall dog entered the villa.

“This... every day, every day, come here!”

“The bloody miracle doctor has made him so fat!”

Lan Qingyue and elder fan looked at the heavenly dog with smiles on their faces.

“Eh, his strength has actually reached the infant stage!”

Wang Xian looked at the heavenly dog in astonishment.

“He must have cultivated to the infant stage under the waterfall of spiritual energy. This heavenly dog’s bloodline is extraordinary. It’s very likely that he has achieved a huge improvement!”

Wang Xian touched him and the heavenly dog immediately lowered its head obediently.

The next morning, Xiao Yu and elder fan left directly to visit the people from the Thorn sect.

Wang Xian put on a set of simple clothes and walked towards the school.

Sitting in the luxurious RV, the heavenly dog followed suit. Wang Xian stroked its head with a smile and scanned the surroundings.

The surroundings didn’t change much, but Wang Xian saw many young and middle-aged men with long braids.

There were also some martial artists who were jumping on the trees.

The cars on the street were moving forward. It was obvious that they were used to the situation around them.

Wang Xian didn’t let the heavenly dog follow him. He came to the entrance of the school and took out his cell phone to call Wang Dahai.

“It’s been more than a year. I wonder if this kid is still in school!”

Wang Xian said with a smile.

“Hello, Old Wang. Is... is that you?”

Wang Dahai’s excited voice came from the phone.

“It’s me. Where Are You, Kid? I’m in school now. Are you still in school?”

Wang Xian heard the familiar voice and his face was full of smiles.

“Ah, Old Wang, you’re at school. Boss, I’m here. Where are you? I’ll go look for you immediately!”

Wang Dahai said hurriedly. It was old Wang calling out to him again.

“I’ll go look for you. Tell me where you are!”

“I’ll go look for you. There are some changes in the school. You might not be able to find me!”

In a spacious room, Wang Dahai stood beside a few young men and women. After hanging up the phone, he walked to the side of a woman with a smile on his face.

The woman’s face was exquisite, and there was a proud look on her face. She crossed her arms and held a sword in her hand, looking like an ice-cold heroine.

“Senior sister, I’m going to pick up a friend. I’ll be back soon!”

“Okay!”

The woman nodded coldly. She didn’t even look at Wang Dahai, but stared at the people in front of her.

There, a group of warriors were sparring.

Most of them were at level four, five, or six. This was something unimaginable a year ago.

“Old Wang, Old Wang!”

In less than two minutes, Wang Dahai’s figure appeared in Wang Xian’s line of sight.

Compared to a year ago, Wang Dahai’s fat body had completely turned into muscles. He was a muscular man.

With a simple and honest smile on his face, he pounced on Wang Xian excitedly.

When Wang Xian saw this scene, he didn’t dare to look straight at him.

“Big Brother, Boss, Old Wang, Dragon King, I missed you so much!”

Wang Dahai spread his arms and stared at Wang Xian with burning eyes.

“Scram!”

Wang Xian placed his finger on Wang Dahai’s chest and said in disdain. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“It’s been more than a year. Old Wang, where have you been? I thought...”

“No, no, you are so awesome. How could something happen to you? Let’s Go!”

Wang Dahai patted Wang Xian’s shoulder in excitement.

“I have some things to do. Now that I’m back, I won’t be leaving anytime soon!”
