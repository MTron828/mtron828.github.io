Chapter 2920: to seek help from the Dragon Palace 6

Evil was the name on Earth.

In the bright starry sky, it was sometimes called evil, or evil. As for why it was called evil, Wang Xian was not sure.

Evil had a very powerful ability. They could be summoned out in some way.

Summoning was not limited by distance.

The summoned evildoers were restricted by the Summoner, but the evil lair of the evildoers would be summoned along with the evildoers.

This evil lair had a terrifying ability. It could assimilate a creature into evildoers, reducing its rationality.

A large number of evildoers were summoned, assimilating the summoner, causing chaos in the void and increasing their strength.

This time, the VELURIYAM domain was in danger because the VELURIYAM domain had detected that the evildoers that had been summoned had returned.

The demons were very strong. There were a large number of demons in a demon cave and there was a leader of the demons.

In the battles of the demons, they would usually bring along the demon cave and invade with a large number of demons.

However, there was also a fatal weakness.

That was that once the opponent’s strength was strong, they would be able to counterattack and attack the Demon Cave and kill all the demons.

The reason why Wang Xian agreed to the invitation of the glazed domain was firstly for their reward and secondly for the demons in the demon lair and the demon lair.

If the Dragon Palace wanted to improve tremendously, they would have to go through war and slaughter.

Obviously, the chimei territory was a good choice.

At this moment, invincible sent a location with such a message.

When Wang Xian saw this message, he stood up immediately.

“Prime Minister Gui, I will head over personally this time. After I get there, I will build a dragon palace in the sea of the glazed domain. I will await your orders then.”

He instructed Prime Minister Gui.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Prime Minister Gui nodded.

Wang Xian moved his body and disappeared in the next moment. He appeared in front of the teleportation formation of the Dragon Palace.

After stepping into the teleportation formation, Wang Xian arrived at the area of the Holy Region. It was a vital planet located near the central region of the Holy Region.

Now that the Dragon Palace had established a dragon palace on dozens of planets in the holy region, it was much more convenient to travel to and from the Dragon Palace.

After flying out of the Dragon Palace, Wang Xian used the teleportation formation of the Holy Region and flew quickly toward the border between the holy region and the glazed tile region.

Whoosh

He flew all the way to a planet at the border between the holy region and the glazed area. With a leap, Wang Xian appeared in the void.

He unfurled his incipient holy wings and looked ahead. He narrowed his eyes slightly and a look of eagerness appeared in his pupils.

“I wonder how fast I can fly at full speed.”

He flapped his wings slightly and disappeared into the horizon in the next moment.

According to some records, it would take ten days for a first level divine emperor powerhouse to reach the nearest life planet in the glazed domain from the boundary of the Holy Region.

However, with Wang Xian’s speed, this time would be shortened by dozens of times.

Wang Xian shuttled through the void at an extremely terrifying speed. He broke through the space and flew into the crack between space.

He was like a ray of light as he dashed forward rapidly.

An hour later, Wang Xian lowered his speed and came out from the space crack. He looked at his position and revealed a smile.

“An hour. My speed is really terrifying!”

Wang Xian looked at the time and the distance. The corners of his mouth curled up slightly.

He continued flying for another three minutes before a planet of life appeared in front of him.

With his spiritual perception, he arrived at the iconic building on this planet, a tall tower.

At this moment, a group of people were arranging something on the tall tower.

The next moment, Wang Xian stood on the tall platform. The group of people at the side had yet to notice his arrival.

“I heard that the Dragon King will be coming to our place soon. Oh, the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace. We will be lucky enough to meet him later!”

“Do you guys think the Dragon King is more powerful or our domain Lord?”

“Of course it’s our domain Lord. Our Domain Lord has become a god Emperor 50 million years ago. He can cover the sky with one hand and is extremely powerful. Even the creator of the Machine Royal Territory is afraid of our domain Lord!”

“The Dragon King should be very powerful too. I just didn’t expect that the battlefield between the glazed domain and the chimei domain would be so dangerous. We were forced to ask for help. Fortunately, the Dragon Palace was willing to help us!”

“It’s mainly because our domain Lord and a group of experts are stationed at the border of the machine emperor domain to prevent the machine emperor domain from attacking. Otherwise, we would be able to easily finish off the chimei domain!”

“Right now, that kid named invincible in battle techniques on the AI is simply too arrogant. He actually said that we are inferior to the Dragon Palace and that we are trash. I’m so angry. If I see him, I will definitely beat him up!”

“That Kid’s mouth stinks like he ate shit. However, it’s true that he killed two first level celestial thearch demons. It seems like he killed them through a treasure. Moreover, this kid can take pictures with us celestial thearchs. He is very capable!”

“I heard from the soldiers at the front line that that kid is much more arrogant. Unfortunately, this guy has the right to be arrogant. However, I heard that many young masters and ladies are preparing to teach that invincible in battle tactics a lesson. They said that as long as he eats in the glazed domain, they will find people to shit in his food. I think this is the way to deal with this kind of guy!”

“PFFT, SH * t, Hahaha!”

On the high tower, the group of people were laughing and setting up things as they chatted.

Wang Xian, who was standing at the side, was slightly stunned when he heard their words. He was extremely speechless.

How long had it been since invincible had arrived in the glazed area?

He was already famous in the entire glazed area, yet he still had to SH * t in his rice?

Awesome! Awesome!

“Who… Who Are You? Who Are You?”

At this moment, someone suddenly noticed Wang Xian’s presence. He was completely stunned and stared at him with wide eyes and vigilance.

“Where is your glazed tile’s celestial emperor?” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Wang Xian asked them indifferently.

“Glazed tile’s celestial emperor?”

Upon hearing Wang Xian’s words, the people who were setting up on the high platform were slightly shocked. They stared at Wang Xian with wide eyes.

There was a five-colored crown on his head with the symbol of the divine dragon on it.

He was wearing the eight-colored divine dragon costume, giving people a profound feeling.

“You… You are the Dragon King?”

An Elder’s pupils contracted slightly as he asked tentatively.

“Yes!”

Wang Xian nodded his head faintly and asked again, “Where is your Liu Li’s divine emperor?”

“Greetings, Dragon King! Greetings, Dragon King!”

The old man’s body trembled and he immediately knelt down. The people around him reacted and their bodies trembled before they knelt down.

“Your Majesty, our Celestial Emperor is rushing towards us. The Celestial Emperor said that you are coming over and asked us to prepare. I didn’t expect you to arrive so soon!”

The old man spoke with reverence.

“Yes!”

Wang Xian nodded and revealed a smile. It seemed that he was too fast and had arrived ahead of time!

“I’m Here!”

However, at this moment, he looked down and saw three celestial emperors rushing over.
