Chapter 445: Sacred Sect: Dragon Sect (5)

Bian Yaoquan from Bian Family was the son of one of the two Sect Masters of Medical Saint Sect.

Hua Mingshan from Hua Family was the son of the other Sect Master of Medical Saint Sect.

The death of two sons of the Sect Masters who were the most outstanding disciples in Medical Saint Sect outraged the Medical Saint Sect.

[Kill him now. We cannot tolerate it any longer!]

The message was passed to some of the Sacred Sects, Sacred Clans, and ancestral sects.

When they received the message, they were shocked by the benefits promised by Medical Saint Sect in the killing order.

“Whoever kills Miracle Doctor Wang of Rivertown and his gang, they will get two Level 6 elixir pills as payment. Apart from this, they will also refine elixir pills free ten times. All participants will receive a handsome reward!”

Two Level 6 elixir pills. Those were two Level 6 elixir pills, which were extremely effective in advancing toward Half-Step to Dan Realm.

Besides, they could refine their elixir pills ten times for free. This reward also brightened up the eyes of all forces.

No one in the entire Underworld could compare with Medical Saint Sect in their Art of Refining Elixir. Those ancestral sects had to pay a huge price to get Medical Saint Sect to help in refining elixir pills.

Now, they offered to refine ten times for free. If someone managed to come up with Spiritual Grass to refine Level 6 elixir pills, they would also do it for free.

Regardless of getting Level 6 elixir pills or refining elixir pills for free, it was a great temptation to any forces.

All the ancestral sects hesitated before they sent the message to those disciples at Huashan. It would be best if they could complete the mission.

All the disciples from various ancestral sects below the arena had received the message. All of them revealed a tinge of shock with radiance flickering in their eyes.

“Second Uncle, shall we...”

Qiao Fuzi looked towards several elders beside him and asked with gleaming eyes. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Those people around Miracle Doctor Wang are quite strong. Besides, a lot of people are aware of this news. It’s a surprise that Medical Saint Sect is so desperate to pay such a price for him to be killed!”

“Hmph, he’s only courting his own doom since he dared to kill people from Sacred Sects!” Qiao Fuzi remarked with a cold look.

“Find a chance to strike!”

“Hey, brother. Here’s the message from the ancestral sect. Should we do it?”

Between Saint Qi and Saint Wen, a young man asked his elder brother at the side.

“What do you think?”

“They want us to strike when there’s an opportunity. Let’s see how many people do it. If there’s a chance, I think we can give it a shot!”

“If we aren’t 100 percent sure, don’t do it. I’ve always felt that he’s not a simple person!”

“Mm.”

“Yinxuan, here’s the message from the ancestral sect. Two Level 6 elixir pills and refining elixir pills ten times for free. I think we can do it too!”

Back at the Heavenly Sound Sect, an elder suggested to Tang Yinxuan with fervent eyes.

“No, we can’t!”

When Tang Yinxuan saw the message sent by their Sect Leader, she shook her head firmly.

“Hur? The Sect Leader hoped that we could kill him off because the reward from Medical Saint Sect is simply too attractive. Didn’t you say both of you were just acquaintances?” the elder from Heavenly Sound Sect asked with a frown.

“Elder Yang, I have decided not to take part in this. He’s very mighty, and it’s far beyond your imagination!”

Tang Yinxuan spoke firmly with a stern look.

“How mighty can he be? We have four Inborn Experts here. I bet the rest of the people received the same message. By then, we are not the only ones who strike. Participations will also be rewarded handsomely.”

Elder Yang raised his eyebrow and rebuked.

“Elder Yang, I know him. His strength...” Tang Yinxuan hesitated. “Not even our Supreme Elder of Heavenly Sound Sect can take him down.”

“What?” Elder Yang froze as he looked at Tang Yinxuan with astonishment. “Yinxuan, are you kidding...?”

“Elder Yang, why would I lie to you? I have seen his prowess.”

Tang Yinxuan answered Elder Yang with a serious look.

Upon seeing her serious look, Elder Yang turned solemn with glistening eyes. He murmured, “Is there such a demon-like existence?”

In fact, you guys have seen his domineering prowess before!

But Tang Yinxuan did not say that out loud as she glanced around with a cold smile.

She noticed all the disciples and supreme talents of ancestral sects fixing their gleaming gazes on Wang Xian. A tinge of contempt surfaced on her face.

They probably had no idea what kind of domineering existence they were facing.

Greed marks the original sin and death!

Another five to six first-class forces received the message from Medical Saint Sect.

Among which, five supreme talents’ eyes were gleaming with greed and excitement.

None of them knew that the atmosphere in the Outstanding Young Heroes Competition had undergone subtle changes!

“Young Lord, there’s a message from our Lord, asking us to complete a mission!”

Two middle-aged men reported to the Young Lord of Sea Serpent Island.

“Oh, let me see!”

“Hur? Level 6 elixir pills and free refining elixir pills ten times!”

A tinge of queerness blinked in the eyes of Young Lord of Sea Serpent Island. “Medical Saint Sect lives up to their name. What a cruel man!”

“Thanks to Miracle Doctor Wang. Otherwise, we’ll not have this opportunity!” a middle-aged man said with a smile.

“Yes, I have to thank him. Just perfect, I’ll kill him in the arena and win the championship title. Killing two birds with one stone!”

Young Lord of Sea Serpent Island revealed a smile.

“The duels are almost coming to an end!”

Young Lord of Sea Serpent Island observed around with his lips drawn. “Miracle Doctor Wang of Rivertown, you’re the current number one supreme talent on the chart. Get on now so that I can slay you today! Hahaha!”

He burst into laughter and jumped into the arena. With his chin lifted, he glared at Wang Xian, beaming.

“Hur?”

“Young Lord of Sea Serpent Island is challenging Wang Xian!”

“The most exciting duel is here!”

“Young Lord of Sea Serpent Island used to be the number one on the chart. Now Miracle Doctor Wang of Rivertown suddenly emerged and took over him. We’ll find out who is more powerful soon!”

“After their duel, we should be able to tell who is the champion for this year!”

The surrounding crowd was thrilled when they saw Young Lord of Sea Serpent Island issue a challenge to Wang Xian. All of them were looking at the two with great anticipation.

“Slay me?”

Upon hearing Young Lord of Sea Serpent Island, Wang Xian was slightly suspicious.

“Young Master, here’s a message from Xiao Ran!”

Suddenly, Mo Qinglong passed a phone from behind.

Wang Xian took over the phone and squinted his eyes as soon as he read the message.

“No wonder he wants to slay me! Haha!”

Upon reading the content, Wang Xian chuckled. “The Medical Saint Sect are quick in taking action!”

“I wonder how many of them in the field want to kill me. But since you guys are up for a game, I will definitely play on!”

Wang Xian laughed as he swept his gaze across everyone. Eventually, he stopped at Young Lord of Sea Serpent Island, who was staring at him in the arena.

“I’m sorry! I’m not participating in the ranking of the Outstanding Young Heroes Chart!”
