Chapter 2993: Dragon Palace vs Universe Central Race 4

“Howl Howl Howl!”

“Howl Howl Howl!”

At this time, continuous roars came from within the Dragon Cave.

The densely packed roars caused the entire space to tremble.

“Rumble Rumble Rumble!”

Following which, swallowing dragons with 18 claws flew out.

A million swallowing dragons, the weakest was an undying emperor level 8.

There were about 4,000 emperor level devouring dragons at the front.

They bared their fangs and brandished their claws, exuding a ferocious aura.

When all the devouring dragons flew out of the Dragon Cave, the expressions of everyone from the two tribes changed drastically.

“This is just the beginning!”

Wang Xian saw the change in their expressions and smiled.

“Woo Woo Woo!” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Woo Woo Woo Woo!”

As soon as he finished his sentence, Xiao Lan’s little house, which was hidden on both sides of the Dragon Cave, let out a roar.

Their voices seemed to come from the ancient times and the horizon.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

At this moment, one by one, berserk dragon, Imperial Dragon, Fire Dragon and Phoenix, and poisonous horned dragon flew out from the Dragon Cave and landed on Xiao Lan’s little house respectively.

Xiao Lan opened his mouth and a black hole appeared in front of him.

Weng

The next moment, Xiao Lan’s body appeared behind the three-eyed race’s four-armed race and blocked their path of retreat.

Roar Roar Roar

The entire Dragon Palace instantly went berserk.

The pressure of nearly 8,000 emperor God realm experts charged toward them.

“Hiss!”

At this moment, the four-armed race and the three-eyed race were shocked.

They looked around, and cold sweat appeared on their foreheads.

“This… this… this…”

Everyone on the nine destruction planet was completely stunned. They didn’t know what to say.

This was the full power of the Dragon Palace?

“What’s going on? What’s going on? Why are there so many experts in the Dragon Palace? Didn’t they say there were only hundreds of divine emperors?”

Elder Ren, who was heavily injured, widened his eyes when he saw that they were surrounded and felt the power of the Dragon Palace.

“We’ve been deceived, Elder. What should we do? What should we do?”

At this moment, the foreheads of everyone from the four-armed race and the three-eyed race were covered in cold sweat.

They looked around in fear. They no longer had the arrogance they had before.

There were seven to eight thousand divine emperors. There were seven to eight thousand of them, which was several times more than them.

Moreover, the auras of those two terrifying beasts made them tremble.

“Run! This is all the strength of the Dragon Palace. As long as we escape, our race’s strength will rush over and easily exterminate them!”

Elder Yi’s expression was extremely gloomy as he roared.

Their gazes swept across the surroundings, but they did not sense any rank 5 divine emperors or above.

This made him even angrier.

There were no rank 6 divine emperors, but they had almost killed him.

He wanted to make the Dragon Palace pay a terrible price!

“Elder Yi, our space has been sealed. They have powerful Magi. We can not escape back to the divine kingdom in an instant!”

However, soon, a terrified roar was heard.

When the members of the three-eyed race heard this voice, their bodies trembled. They realized that they could not return to the divine kingdom in an instant. Their Hearts were beating violently as well.

“We have been sealed!”

The hearts of everyone from the two large races sank.

“Hehehe, we have sealed the entire space. Don’t even think about escaping. Don’t even think about sending any messages. Just wait for your death!”

The injured eight-limbed demonic fiend returned to Wang Xian and the rest with a sinister smile filled with killing intent.

“Kill!”

Wang Xian didn’t give them any chance. He gave a loud roar and gave an order.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

The Million Devouring Dragons roared and attacked the two tribes directly.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

The Dragon Cave moved forward slowly. Countless arrows from the arrow dragon species were aimed at the two tribes.

The Mad Dragon, Imperial Dragon, Heavenly Lightning Earth Fire Dragon Phoenix species, and Venom Serpent dragon behind the two large groups gave off violent auras as they charged forward.

The thorned dragon species flashed and disappeared into the air.

The 1.9 million combat members of the Dragon Palace unleashed all of their strength.

“Not good, not good!”

“Not good, block it, block it now!”

All the members of the two large tribes were pale as they roared loudly.

“Damn it, how could this be!”

The one-headed eight elder of the three-eyed tribe roared in fear.

They were here to obtain an opportunity, not to throw their lives away!

How could this be?

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

The Wrath of the divine dragon caused countless dragon species to overturn the seas and rivers, completely surrounding the two large tribes. Nearly 8,000 divine emperors unleashed their first wave of attacks.

Countless Dragon Flames and Dragon Breath covered the center.

Everyone from the two large clans was enveloped.

“Resist!”

“The weakest member of the Dragon Palace is at least at the eighth rank of the Emperor God realm. How can they be so powerful! ?”

The Emperor God experts from the two large clans roared in fear and released their defenses.

Some experts had ugly expressions and had a bad premonition.

What kind of concept was this? The weakest member of the Dragon Palace had a rank eight godly monarch combat strength?

The core army of their entire race was only so-so!

“Ah Ah Ah, I can’t Hold On!”

“Kill Kill Kill!”

As the energy covered the area, the experts below the godly monarch level from the two races roared in fear.

They were too strong, and they were not on the same level at all.

Other than the number of divine emperor realm rank 5 experts, there was a difference of seven to eight times.

With such a huge difference, if they could not escape back to their own divine kingdom in an instant, would they still have a chance of survival?

“Break through, break through!”

Elder si, who was heavily injured, saw this scene and his eyes were about to split open as he roared out with all his might.

Two divine emperor realm rank 5 experts protected his surroundings and immediately broke through from behind.

“Break through!”

The Divine Emperors roared and tried to break through the encirclement from the back.

As for the members below the divine emperor level, they would have to pray for themselves.

“Ah Ah Ah, no, no, no!”

“Elders, deacons, save us!”

Screams sounded. Under the Dragon Palace’s attack, more than half of the 180,000 members of the two large clans died.

A god-emperor-level powerhouse could not even care about himself. How could he care about the other members?

“Kill them all! Leave No one alive!”

Wang Xian’s face turned cold when he saw them breaking out of the encirclement. He moved his body.

Whoosh

He flew forward at a terrifying speed. His gaze was locked onto the eighth elder of the three-eyed tribe, who only had one head left.

“Be careful!”

Sensing Wang Xian flying over, the deacon who was holding the head of the eight elders of the three-eyed race had a drastic change in expression.

He held the longsword in his hand and slashed at Wang Xian directly.

“Bang Bang!”

Wang Xian did not Dodge. The Tai Chi Dragon that was circling around him spun around and blocked the terrifying sword ray directly.

“Crack!”

His palm turned into a dragon claw and clawed at the Deacon’s body.

The Deacon’s eyes revealed fear and hurriedly dodged. However, the head of the eight elders of the three-eyed race was caught in his hand.

“No!”

Seeing that he was caught, the eighth elder roared out in fear.
