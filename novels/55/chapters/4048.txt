Chapter 4049 - 4049: 4048 sudden change, the Asgard Heavenly Demon God had a breakthrough!

Translator: 549690339

The Heaven’s origin creation was enraged, and the sky collapsed and the Earth collapsed !

Their emotions only changed, and the entire space seemed to change along with it!

No one would have thought that the master of the flowing water forbidden ground would suffer such a terrifying punishment just because he protected his grandson!

Below, flowing water’s body was trembling violently!

Cold Sweat was dripping down his face.

His face was filled with fear and despair.

He did not expect this matter to reach such a stage!

He did not expect that the forbidden space would be destroyed just because he made a move against long Yinhao.

Even the two heavenly Yuan creation realm powerhouses in their universe were alarmed!

He had a premonition that he was probably going to be finished!

Completely done for!

“Dragon King, I will investigate this matter clearly. I will settle everything properly! ”

Liu Lan looked at Wang Xian and said!

“According to the rules you announced, all those who violate the rules will die. For your sake, senior Liu Lan, those disciples who are involved in this matter will be killed immediately and can not be resurrected! ”

“In addition, the Master of the Forbidden Land and the elders who are protecting him will be spared from the death penalty. However, they will not be able to escape alive. All of their strength will be crippled. ”

Wang Xian looked at him and said!

His words caused Liu LAN’s expression to change slightly. Her expression was a little ugly!

“Dragon King, isn’t this request of yours too much?”

Liu Lan looked at Wang Xian with an ugly expression and said!

“It’s not too much at all. You have to abide by the rules that you have set. I don’t wish for an outsider like me to interfere! ” Wang Xian looked at her calmly as he replied!

His tone was filled with dominance as well!

“Regarding the matter of our sword and Magic Universe, we will settle it

internally! ”

At the side, the Heaven’s origin manifestation powerhouse from the unfettered forbidden land spoke coldly as well!

“Hehe, since you guys want to protect me, I’ll have to deal with it myself! ”

Wang Xian swept his gaze across them and smiled faintly!

A wave of energy directly enveloped long yinyin and long yinhao.

He swept his gaze across the surroundings and with a move of his palm, the book of water forbidden spell floated in the sky above him!

The star field fragment turned into a planet and arrived below Wang Xian!

At the same time, a wave of pressure slowly enveloped the surroundings!

Under this wave of pressure, with just a thought from Wang Xian, other than those at the peak of the Universe Dominator and the ninth level of the universe dominator, the rest of them had to die!

“Book of Water Forbidden Spell! ”

Liu Lan saw that Wang Xian did not give them any face and was not afraid of them at all!

Looking at the fragments of the book of water forbidden spell above him, she spoke with an ugly expression!

“Two treasure fragments of the Heaven’s origin creation! ”

The Heaven’s origin creation powerhouses from the undeserved forbidden ground also had an extremely grave expression.

They stared at the star field fragment beneath Wang Xian with an equally unsightly expression!

The atmosphere instantly froze!

“Huff! Huff! ”

“Huff! Huff! ”

All the powerhouses from the Holy Grounds, Saint Academy, and forbidden ground were watching this scene with rapid breathing.

They felt as though they were about to die at any moment!

The terrifying atmosphere made them feel extremely stifled. It was difficult for them to breathe!

The bodies of some weaklings began to tremble violently!

Fear, fear!

If they were to really fight, would they be able to survive?

I’m afraid it would be very, very difficult!

“Dragon King, are you threatening us?”

Liu Lan looked at this scene and spoke again with a sullen face!

Wang Xian nodded his head!

Although Liu Lan had a relationship with senior water dragon, it was merely a relationship!

What did it have to do with him?

Some people in the flowing water forbidden land had to pay a price for their mistakes!

Otherwise, they would not give him face!

Since that was the case, Wang Xian did not need to give Liu Lan face!

“HMPH, your combat strength is very strong, but you haven’t reached the Heaven’s origin manifestation stage after all. If Liu Lan and I were to join forces, do you really think that we won’t be able to kill you?”

The Heaven’s origin manifestation powerhouse from the unexpected forbidden ground raised the golden axe in his hand with a cold expression and stared at Wang Xian coldly!

“You don’t Dare! ”

Wang Xian looked at them and spoke without any fear!

If the two of them were to join forces, Wang Xian would definitely not be their match!

However, Wang Xian was still very confident if he wanted to escape!

Wang Xian guessed that they wouldn’t dare to make a move!

Of course, they might have their own trump cards, or they might dare to make a move!

However, Wang Xian felt that the possibility wasn’t high!

They didn’t dare to make a move. If they did, their losses would be even greater!

“Do you dare to do it?”

Flow blue face gloomily stared at Wang Xian, coldly opened his mouth to say!

Wang Xian smiled and raised his palm slowly! The flow of blue eyes, the body of water flow!

“Boom, Boom, Boom! ”

“Boom, Boom, Boom! ”

However, just when Wang Xian was about to kill the second elder of the Liushui forbidden area.

Suddenly, a terrifying aura came from below. A demon pillar suddenly shot up from below!

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz

The World Shook!

The world resonated!Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The ground of the demonic beast abyss above vanished into thin air!

Yes, from the first level to the eighth level, there were layers of thick soil separating them.

However, these layers of soil disappeared immediately!

A mighty and violent voice came from the heaven and earth.

A terrifying and destructive power came from below, acting as the Heaven and earth!

“Hahaha, Hahaha, I have finally broken through. The Heaven’s origin destiny, the Heaven’s origin destiny, I have finally lived another life!” Following that, an extremely excited and violent voice was heard!

The sudden scene stunned Wang Xian!

It also stunned Liu Lan and the powerhouses of the destiny of the Heaven’s origin in the unfettered forbidden ground! They looked down in astonishment!

He had broken through!

There was actually someone who had broken through to the destiny realm of the Heaven’s origin!

The eighth level of the abyss of Magical Beasts!

There was a powerhouse who had broken through to the destiny realm of the Heaven’s origin!

“The Asgard Heavenly Demon God has broken through. Boss, that Asgard Heavenly Demon God has actually broken through! ”

When Lin Niu heard this voice and felt this aura, he revealed a shocked expression on his face!

He roared out in disbelief!

“Yes, I didn’t expect it to have made a breakthrough! ”

When Wang Xian received this news, he revealed an embarrassed expression on his face!

If it wasn’t for long Yinhao’s sudden incident, he would have come here this time!

He was prepared to kill the Asgard Heavenly Demon God completely!

After that, he would let Lin Niu devour him. Perhaps in the future, Lin Niu would also be able to break through to the Heavenly Yuan creation realm!

At that time, the Dragon Palace would have two heavenly Yuan creation realm experts!

At that time, even if they returned to the nine origin universe, they would not be afraid of the Phoenix and Angel Race!

But what he did not expect was that the AGA heavenly demon God had actually broken through!

This was not good news for him!

And for the entire sword and magic universe, it was even more bad news!

In fact, the Asgard Demon God’s breakthrough would cause the entire sword and magic universe to be destroyed!
