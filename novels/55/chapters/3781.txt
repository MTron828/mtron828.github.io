3782 3781 upgrade of Xiao Lan’s small house

“Let’s do it here. Bring Xiao Lan’s small house over.”

After Wang Xian released the news, he had been searching for a secret place.

After finding a location, he spoke to Lan Qingyue and an lie who were beside him.

“Alright, Xiao Xian!”

Lan qingyue nodded her head and disappeared in an instant.

An lie was waiting quietly by the side.

“Dragon King, I’m going over!”

Sensing the appearance of the demonic spirit altar and the disappearance of an lie, Wang Xian immediately set up a demonic spirit altar as well!

An incomparably huge void pagoda appeared very quickly. In the next second, Xiao Lan and Xiao House appeared in the sky above the Void Pagoda.

“Dragon King!”

“Dragon King!”

Xiao Lan and Xiao Zhai appeared. They looked at Wang Xian and shouted respectfully immediately.

“Oh? Xiao Lan and Xiao Zhai, can you guys talk now?”

Wang Xian smiled when he heard their words.

Xiao Lan and Xiao Zhai nodded their gigantic heads.

“Xiao Lan and Xiao Zhai are very smart.”

Lan qingyue flew to Wang Xian’s side with a smile on her face.

“Hehe, alright. Next, Xiao Lan House and the rest of you, quickly increase your strength here!”

As Wang Xian spoke, he moved his palm and placed a large number of corpses of the Phoenix clan and Angel clan in front of them.

“Woo Woo!”

“Thank you, Dragon King!”

“Thank you, Dragon King!”

When Xiao Lan House saw the large number of corpses of experts from the peak races, her eyes were filled with excitement. She immediately opened her mouth and said.

“Can these corpses help you to advance to the level of a ruler at level five?”

Wang Xian asked them.

“Dragon King, I’m afraid these corpses are not enough. Even if we were to devour them all by ourselves, it would still be insufficient!”

Xiao Lan’s small house replied, “There are too few corpses at the level of a ruler at level six.”

“It shouldn’t be a problem for the two of you to devour all of them and advance to the level of a ruler at level four, right?”

Wang Xian continued to ask.

“No problem. After we level up, we will still have a lot of resources left. The Master of the Dragon Queen can nurture another companion for us. It will be sufficient for him to level up to the level of a ruler at level four.”

Xiao Lan replied.

“Alright, let’s level up to the level of a ruler at level seven first!”

Wang Xian said with a smile on his face.

Xiao Lan and the small house immediately responded. They opened their mouths and the corpses entered his stomach.

Gray energy surged from their bodies.

“Xiao Xian, I’ll nurture another Kun!”

Lan Qingyue said with a smile.

“Yes, three kun. With their strength, our dragon palace will have some ability to fight against the peak races in the Starry Universe!”

Wang Xian nodded his head.

With the addition of the Little Blue House and one kun, they would be able to fight against three masters at the seventh level.

“Also, it’s best if you can improve yourself as soon as possible.”

Wang Xian said.

Now, as long as he improved a little, his strength would be terrifying.

With the help of the Netherspirit avatar, he could really fight against any peak races in the starry universe.

Of course, it was just a fight.

The top races had many trump cards. For example, the powerful water rope that he encountered last time and the defense of the angel race in the Aurora Domain.

These methods were not something that Wang Xian could compare to.

However, if the other party wanted to kill him, the possibility was too low.

However, Wang Xian still needed a lot of resources to level up.

Now that he had killed so many powerhouses from the angel and Phoenix clans, the resources in his hands were still half of what he needed to level up.

If I can kill another two or three powerhouses who are at the level six of the ruler realm, the resources i need to break through on my own will be enough

Wang Xian thought to himself.

His gaze swept to the side. Lan Qingyue had already started to cultivate the third kun.

He used the communication stone plate to contact prime minister turtle and asked about the situation.

When he got the situation of the Dragon Palace, a smile appeared on his face.

There were thirty-nine level one masters in the Dragon Palace!

The fire heart treasure land was a huge treasure for fire element cultivators.

The Dragon Palace had a lot of fire element cultivators. There were seven to eight hundred pure-blooded divine dragons.

However, the number of purebred divine dragons in the Dragon Palace is still a little low. There are only a few thousand of them. I need to increase them a little. Since I have nothing to do during this period of time, I might as well make a trip back to the nine-origin universe and wait for Xiao Lan’s little house to be upgraded before making my move

He pondered in his heart and sent a voice transmission to Lan Qingyue, asking him to stay here by himself!

“An lie, bring me back to the nine-origin universe.”

Wang Xian instructed an lie who was beside him.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

An lie nodded. In the next second, they returned to the Dragon Palace!

The current Dragon Palace was located in a secret place at the edge of the nine-origin universe.

It would take hundreds of thousands of years for a peak race to find this place, even if they were to search with all their might!

If it wasn’t for an lie, the Dragon Palace wouldn’t have come here.

“Bring me to the heaven-splitting primordial land. Did you leave behind the demon spirit altar there?”

After returning to the Dragon Palace, Wang Xian asked an lie again. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“I left behind the Dragon King!”

An lie nodded. In the next moment, the surrounding scenery changed again and they arrived at the heaven-splitting primordial land.

Wang Xian’s figure moved. His gaze swept across his surroundings. He felt a destructive force coming from his body.

In the starry universe, his strength was suppressed by three levels. Here, he could travel to an extremely distant place with a sway of his body.

This feeling of not being suppressed by the universe made him feel very comfortable.

“Hehe!”

As he flew rapidly in the sky above the nine-origin universe, he realized that the heaven-splitting chaotic land was no longer as lively as it used to be.

According to the records on the communication stone plate, 30% of the disciples of the high-level races had entered the starry universe.

This was definitely an explosive number!

A large number of disciples had entered the starry universe, which also made the heaven opening primal continent much quieter.

Apart from the peak races, there were only a few weaklings who remained here.

And these weaklings, because of the departure of the strong, were able to occupy a very good training ground. Their strength could increase by tens of times compared to before.

Overall, this was a very good thing for the nine-origin universe.

After arriving at the land of blood plasma, Wang Xian went straight to the deepest spot.

He sat cross-legged at the seat below. The roots of the ancestral tree pierced into the ground and condensed the blood-refining fruit.

Time passed quickly.

However, in just a few decades, Wang Xian received a message.

It was an urgent message from Prime Minister Gui.

When he saw this message, he frowned slightly.

The strong practitioners of the Phoenix and Angel clans were hunting down the strong disciples of the Dragon Palace.

In just a few decades, more than 2,000 disciples of the Dragon Palace were killed or injured.

“It seems that the angel and Phoenix clans are really going all out. They must have powerful treasures to search for the disciples of the Dragon Palace.”

Wang Xian mumbled.

“Tell all the disciples of the Dragon Palace to hide in an Lie’s void pagoda. Don’t go out for the time being.”

He immediately sent a message.

Everything can wait until the Little Blue House completes its upgrade!
