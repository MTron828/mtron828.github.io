Chapter 440: The Champion Of The Younger Generation

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Rumble!

Argh!

A dull impact noise and two pitiful cries reverberated throughout the competition field of the Outstanding Young Heroes Competition.

The entire crowd had turned towards the source of the noises and everyone was shocked to see the old and middle-aged men from the Medical Saint Sect on the floor.

“Those two middle-aged men with Miracle Doctor Wang are really strong!”

“Really, really strong! The old and middle-aged men from the Medical Saint Sect were completely overwhelmed. Those two middle-aged men that are emitting devilish aura are at least Pinnacle Inborn experts. They might very well be even stronger!”

“Is it my misconception? Why do I feel that the people from the Medical Saint Sect are really weak? They were completely crushed!”

The surrounding crowd were stunned and were discussing softly among themselves when they saw the old and middle-aged men being killed on the spot.

“What! How dare you kill the people from our Medical Saint Sect!” At this moment, Hua Mingshan was furious upon hearing the cries. Fear flashed in his eyes as he growled softly.

Hehe!

Hearing Hua Mingshan, the surrounding crowd found him hilarious.

It didn’t matter if Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown was arrogant or simply courting his demise. Now that he had struck, he would be going after your life next.

Saying those words at this point was hilarious.

“The people from Sacred Sects have been arrogant for too long to the point that they believe no one dares to kill them!” a young man mumbled to himself as his eyes fixed on Hua Mingshan.

The surrounding disciples of the Sacred Sects were taken aback as they witnessed the disciples of the Medical Saint Sect being slaughtered before their eyes. They looked to Wang Xian, raised an eyebrow and sank into thought.

“Don’t you find it hilarious to say such words now?” Xiao Yu looked coldly at Hua Mingshan as she waved the longsword in her hand towards Hua Mingshan.

“YOU... Our Medical Saint Sect won’t let you off. Not a single one of you is getting away. Just wait for the endless revenge from our Medical Saint Sect!” Hua Mingshan screeched wretchedly. Cold sweat had filled his forehead.

Seeing the impossibly sharp bone sword, he gritted his teeth.

Swish swish swish!

The branches of the Spiritual Scale Tree wiggled rapidly and weaved together to become an exceptionally huge wooden spear.

“Is that all you got?”

Seeing the changes to the Spiritual Scale Tree, contempt gleamed in Xiao Yu’s eyes as she threw herself forward with the bone sword.

The Spiritual Scale Tree was just like a poisonous snake with sharp thorns. It grew to over five meters long and struck towards Xiao Yu.

“Kill!” shouted Xiao Yu.

The bone sword in her hand emitted a black glow that extended to over a meter long.

The black glow had turned the bone sword into a giant blade that slashed against the Spiritual Scale Tree.

Ka ka ka!

Sounds of the Spiritual Scale Tree cracking reverberated while the bone sword slashed toward Hua Mingshan as though there was nothing in its way.

“No!”

Hua Mingshan was desperate. He dodged, turned around and fled immediately.

“Running? It’s a little too late for that!”

Seeing Hua Mingshan running away, ruthlessness gleamed in the eyes of Mo Yuan. He moved and caught up with Hua Mingshan instantly.

Bam!

A terrifying devil claw gripped onto his back instantly.

The next moment, it pierced through his body.

Cough cough!

Hua Mingshan’s body stiffened and he was spitting out a mouthful of blood.

He turned around and looked towards the direction where Wang Xian was with disbelief.

“I... Our Medical Saint Sect will never... never... let you off!”

Bam!

Hua Mingshan fell to the ground and vitality deserted him.

When the crowd saw Hua Mingshan being killed before them, they felt a chill run down their spines.

Thinking back, Hua Mingshan was still basking in the limelight a while ago. He arrived here as the disciple of the Medical Saint Sect and one would regard him as a distinguished guest. When he was here, he was looking down on everyone around him.

It was also because of his connection with the Medical Saint Sect that he was brazen and felt that no one dared to offend him. This eventually led to his death.

“He’s indeed savage and brutal! How lucky are we... Fortunately...!”

Saint Qi and Saint Wen, who were standing beside Sun Longxuan a short distance away, swallowed their saliva. They could feel cold sweat over their foreheads.

Fortunately, he had not offended Miracle Doctor Wang completely the previous time. Otherwise, even his identity of being the son of the richest man in the Southern Province would mean nothing.

“He’s really fearless!” Saint Qi and Saint Wen exchanged glances and heaved a sigh of relief.

“However, this type of person often dies young. No matter how great his talents are, it will just be a matter of time until he is killed because of his arrogance!” A short distance away, Qiao Fuzi snorted. He looked at Wang Xian and contempt flashed in his eyes.

“Those who are insanely gifted often die prematurely. Considering his personality, Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown won’t live past a few years!”

“He’s too fearless. The Underworld has its rules and a Sacred Sect is a Sacred Sect after all. Considering his style of actions, he won’t survive for long!”

“Unless he can run to a faraway place, otherwise, the Medical Saint Sect will definitely finish him off. Even if that means deploying all the strength of the Medical Saint Sect, they won’t let him off!”

“He was blinded by anger. In my opinion, Miracle Doctor Wang is too foolish to offend a Sacred Sect completely. The consequences won’t be that simple!”

“Perhaps he felt he could be fearless and disregard all rules after living well subsequent to slaughtering the Elders of the Sacred Followers Guild!”

Seeing Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown ordering his men to kill the three people from the Medical Saint Sect, the surrounding crowd was stunned. At the same time, they felt that Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown was fearless.

It was especially so for the disciples from strong backgrounds. When they witnessed the development, they snorted.

The current Miracle Doctor Wang did look incredible when he ordered his guys to kill the disciples of a Sacred Sect in the public.

However, they knew clearly the consequences he had to bear after the moment of glory.

“Hehe! This is interesting. This is interesting!”

Flower Monk looked at Wang Xian and squinted his eyes. “The battles of the Outstanding Young Heroes Competition aren’t contests of one’s background. They are contests of strength!”

“That’s right. The titles of Saint or Saintess mean nothing here. The champion of the younger generation isn’t something you can obtain by relying on your background.”

A bewitching young man stared at the crowd before turning his attention to Shi Ming from Imperial Beast Sect and revealing a cunning smirk.

He was that demon-like young man in the carriage. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Hehehe! That’s right! The Outstanding Young Heroes Chart is all about one’s personal strength. In a while, I’d like to seek guidance from everyone here!” At this juncture, the crisp voice of a lady resonated. The crowd turned around and saw a young girl in the traditional attire of a minority group. She had over ten metal rings around her neck and was flicking her hair flirtatiously.

“Let’s meet again in the arena!” a young man commented plainly before turning around and heading in another direction.

The atmosphere of a battle was starting to form. Outstanding young disciples from all over the world lifted their heads proudly while looking at their competitors. They were all confident in what they were capable of.

Having reached the Inborn Realm at a young age, they were all favored by gods and fully confident in themselves.

Even when facing other insanely gifted talents, they didn’t feel that they would lose.

They strongly believed they were the champions of the younger generation.
