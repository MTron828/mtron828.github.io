Chapter 318: Zhan Lu And Hao Zhong

“What horrifying vibes!”

“This... They are so powerful!”

When Roving Heavens led his Devil Division in the charge, the eight Inborn experts and the injured old Inborn expert were shocked.

The violent aura sent chills down their spines.

Behind them, the disciples of the three forces trembled. Looking at the devil monkeys that were charging towards them, they felt as though they were facing a ten thousand strong army.

“Shit! They have multiple Inborn Realm existences among them!”

The Inborn experts were shocked and felt fear grip them.

“Kill!”

An Inborn expert gritted his teeth and swung the longsword he was holding upward. The glow of the sword spanned several meters and clashed towards Roving Heavens who was at the front of the pack.

Bam!

Roving Heavens smashed his long metal rod towards that Inborn expert domineeringly.

The rod and longsword clashed. However, it was an exercise in futility as the horrifying strength of Roving Heavens instantly broke the longsword in the hand of the Inborn expert.

Rumble!

That Inborn expert also exploded into pieces without putting up much resistance.

“What? How can this be possible?”

Seeing their companions being crushed into pieces, the group of Inborn experts were petrified.

“How horrifying!”

Behind them, the crowd of disciples had witnessed what had just happened. None of them could help but shiver and take steps back.

Roar!

However, the group of devil monkeys charged into the crowd of the three forces.

Argh!

Soon, incessant cries sounded. Without putting up much resistance, they were completely crushed.

Some of these Inborn experts retreated in fear. Seeing how Roving Heavens killed several Inborn experts with a single strike each, they were desolated.

“No... Don’t kill me! Please! Don’t kill me!” shouted a desperate Inborn expert.

“Just like what you have done, this is the consequences of being weak!” Wang Xian glanced coldly across them and remarked emotionlessly.

Since they had established these rules, they should follow them even if the rules led to their death.

Roar!

Roving Heavens jumped and charged ahead of the group of Inborn experts in a horrifying manner.

Crushing!

Soon, cries started going quiet. Wang Xian looked around him. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Young master!”

At this moment, Mo Qinglong, Mo Yuan and Mo Shiwu, who were recuperating, had recovered. They walked deferentially to Wang Xian and explained, “This is the spiritual medicine garden on the Spiritual Island. There are two Level 6 spiritual medicines in it. One of them is White Valley Lotus and the other is Green Fruit Tree.

Mo Qinglong pointed at the two spiritual medicines while looking towards the buildings behind.

“We have not searched the buildings. However, I believe there will definitely be lots of spiritual treasure in them.”

“Let’s go take a look!”

Wang Xian looked gleefully at the garden of spiritual medicine and grass.

Two Level 6 spiritual medicines were more than what the Sui Family had. As for the remaining Level 4 and 5 spiritual grass and medicine, Wang Xian was just a little worse off than the Sui Family.

I’ll be able to refine lots of elixir pills from these spiritual medicine and grass. At that time, I’ll sell them in exchange for resources for the Dragon Palace. I should be able to gather most of the required resources.

Wang Xian thought to himself. After a quick walk around the spiritual medicine garden, he headed towards the row of buildings behind it.

Ka Ka Ka!

When they entered the first room, the decayed wooden door fell to the ground instantly. Wang Xian looked around the room before pulling out different drawers enthusiastically as though he was on a treasure hunt.

“Huh? This is a bottle for elixir pills?”

Wang Xian picked up a porcelain bottle. After opening it, he found that the elixir pills in it had already become scraps. He shook his head slightly and continued his search.

Within the rooms, there were all kinds of weapons and jewelry made of jade. Wang Xian even found two hairpins made from top tier jade.

As they combed through the different rooms, Wang Xian and the group found a substantial amount of precious treasures.

“Young master, there’s an entrance leading underground here!” At this moment, Mo Qinglong spoke to Wang Xian.

“Huh? Leading underground?”

Wang Xian’s eyes lit up. He looked over and saw stairs leading underground, which he walked down immediately.

“This is...? This is the treasure room of the Sect!”

When Wang Xian entered, he immediately saw various exquisite weapons and precious antiques. His eyes lit up instantly.

There were paintings and calligraphy pieces hung on the walls. However, they had decayed and were thus valueless.

“This is...?”

Looking ahead, Wang Xian saw a sword hung on the wall. Below it, there was a zither on the table and a box made of jade.

The three items were in a prominent position in the treasure room. Clearly, they were also the three most precious objects in this treasure room.

Wang Xian’s attention fell on the treasured sword hung on the wall.

Weng!

Just as Wang Xian contacted it, the treasured sword seemed to tremble. This gave Wang Xian a shock.

He held the sword scabbard tightly. The entire sword was over a hundred kilograms. For a long sword, this was really heavy.

Wang Xian’s eyes burned fervently. Holding the hilt of the sword lightly, he drew it out slowly.

Ka!

A crisp voice sounded. A dazzling gold light shimmered and the sharpness of the sword made Wang Xian’s arm tremble a little.

“Great sword! What a sharp sword!”

Wang Xian stared at the long sword. Suddenly, a message appeared in his mind.

Zhan Lu: Level 10

“Spiritual sword! This is a spiritual sword!”

“Zhan Lu! Oh gosh! This is Zhan Lu!”

Wang Xian was shocked and thrilled. Zhan Lu was one of the ten famed swords and regarded as the best among the five unparalleled famed swords.

It was said that it was forged over three years using the best metal and within a cold spring.

“I had not expected this to be Zhan Lu, one of the ten famed swords in history. This historic sword was forged by Ou Yezi. In that case, Ou Yezi must be a grandmaster blacksmith. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been able to forge a famed sword classified as one of the ten famed swords.” [1]

Wang drew the fame sword out of its scabbard completely. The bronze shade and the sharp aura around it were dazzling.

Wang Xian moved his arm and injected Metal attribute energy into it. Instantly, a sharp glow covered the sword.

From a far place, one could already sense the sharpness of the sword.

“Great, great. Zhan Lu is known to be the Sword of Benevolence or the Sword of the King. I can use this!”

Wang Xian laughed and put the sword aside. After which, he looked to the zither below it.

A zither that could be placed with Zhan Lu would definitely not be ordinary.

“Hao Zhong?

The zither was made of wood. However, Wang Xian noticed that the wood showed no signs of decay despite the passing of a few hundreds of years. Moreover, it looked just like a new zither.

Wang Xian moved slightly and the information on the zither appeared in his mind too.

[Hao Zhong: Level 10]

It’s another Level 10 spiritual object! This zither wasn’t simple but Wang Xian had no use for it and didn’t know how to use it.

Looking at this extremely stunning zither, Wang Xian picked it up to take a closer look.

“Eh? There’s another long sword below the zither! Enchantment Sword? It seems like the sword and the zither come in a set. This sword is Level 9? What a great treasure!”
