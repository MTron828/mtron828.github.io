Chapter 1603: 1603 Battle of Madness 2

“You...”

Mo Sha’s somewhat mocking words resounded throughout the entire Ying Tian Peak. When the supreme headmaster and Patriarch Feng Chi heard his words, their faces were filled with fury.

“Let me tell you, no one dares to be so arrogant towards our supreme headmaster!”

The supreme headmaster stared at Mo Sha and growled in a low voice. His terrifying aura caused the entire sky to change.

The sky-facing sparrows were already flying around in fear as they stared in their direction.

“So what if you’re arrogant? I’ll ask you, are you going to give me the person?”

Mo Sha Glanced at the two of them and questioned them without any fear.

The supreme headmaster and Patriarch Feng Chi’s expressions changed.

“Father, do i. . . Really Want to...”

Ao Tian looked at his father and the Patriarch’s hesitant expressions. His expression changed instantly and he opened his mouth in embarrassment.

Around them, Bing Fa Wu and Bing Jing Huan’s faces were as though they were dripping blood. Their bodies were trembling as they stood there.

“I’ll give you three seconds to consider!”

Wang Xian stared at them and said faintly.

“Three seconds to consider? This isn’t just threatening our sect. It’s suppressing them!”

“The words of the sky demon are a little...”

When everyone around heard Wang Xian’s words, their expressions changed slightly.

They felt that the words of the Sky Demon were a little too arrogant.

After all, the sect had two people at level nine of the Seethrough void tier. They were just fearful, not fearful.

Now that the sky demon was so domineering and said that he would give them three seconds, his tone that was close to an order would cause the sect to retaliate.

“Hehe!”

The supreme headmaster laughed when he heard Wang Xian’s words. He squinted his eyes slightly and looked at Wang Xian.

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz

With a wave of his arm, gusts of wind elemental energy surged. The clouds in the sky dispersed crazily in the surroundings.

The entire sky was as blue as the horizon.

Gusts of heart-palpitating energy gathered rapidly in the surroundings.

The array formation rose, and the world changed.

The entire world seemed to have changed its master.

“Array formation, supreme sect leader has activated the Array Formation!”

“What is this?”

“It seems like Heavenly Devil’s words have forced supreme sect leader into a corner!”

Everyone around was slightly startled as they hurriedly sized up their surroundings.

“If any rank nine profound void martial expert can step on our faces, then our lone sect has no need to exist anymore!”

Patriarch Fengchi stood up from the Azure Dragon Chair and moved to the Supreme Hierarch’s side.

“Activate the array. Even a rank nine profound void martial expert can be trapped!”

He swept his gaze around and said indifferently.

This was the place where the sect had been established for tens of thousands of years. It was still possible for the array to trap a rank nine profound void martial expert!

“Brother Nangong, 50% of the profits will help us kill two reckless people!”

The supreme sect master suddenly looked in the direction of the southern royal family.

“This is?”

When the surrounding forces saw the formation, the supreme sect master said to Nangong Jianghe, and their expressions changed.

Nangong Jianghe sat there, and his eyes flickered.

“Supreme Sect Master, I Won’t help you kill a rank 9 void interpretation expert!”

Nangong Jianghe lightly shook his head.

“70% , 70% of the profits!”

Supreme sect master’s face darkened as he shouted in a low voice.

“80% . If we fail, your sect must give us the equivalent of an item!”

Nangong Jianghe directly said.

“Alright, no one can threaten our sect. Even if we have to pay a huge price, we must kill them!”

Before the supreme headmaster could reply, Patriarch Fengchi who was beside him replied.

His gaze swept toward Mo Sha. He extended his arm and a huge fan appeared in his hand.

The green fan was filled with special patterns.

“I haven’t participated in a battle of the same level for a long time!”

Nangong Jianghe stood up slowly. He swept his gaze across Mo Sha and Wang Xian with a smile and continued, “Remember, never challenge the bottom line of a powerful force. Otherwise...”

As he spoke, he shook his head slowly.

“I’m sorry, Brother!”

Nangong Jianghe looked at Mo Sha. Wisps of flames started to rise from his body.

“Not good!”

“This... Solitaire sect actually paid a price to invite the patriarch of the southern royal family to take action!”

“This time, Sky Demon and the rest have gone overboard!”

Upon seeing Nangong Jianghe agreeing to help solitaire sect, the expressions of all the powerhouses from the factions changed slightly.

“Are we going to watch a world-ending battle today?”

Everyone thought to themselves.

Everyone from the He clan and he Sui clan initially thought that he yuan and he sui Qing would be able to tide over the crisis. However, when they saw this scene, their expressions changed drastically again.

Three people at level eight of the Seethrough void tier would be able to defeat one of them.

“Don’t you southern royal family know that it’s best not to get involved in other people’s Affairs?”

Wang Xian turned his head to look at the southern royal family expressionlessly and questioned coldly.

“Oh? So what if I’m involved? My Southern royal family’s disciples went missing in the Iceheart Imperial City seven days ago. You should be the ones who killed them, right?”

“It doesn’t matter if you admit it or not. In fact, I’m going to make a move too!”

Nangong Jianghe looked at Wang Xian disdainfully and questioned faintly.

“How is it?”

Wang Xian looked at Nangong Jianghe and slowly closed his eyes.

“Then I’ll show you how it is!”

“Mo Sha, block the other two guys for me!”

Wang Xian growled and opened his eyes instantly.

At this moment, his eyes were filled with blood.

Boom

Waves of blood energy erupted from his body.

The five elements crown on his head enlarged instantly and attacked Nangong Jianghe.

“Five elements millstone, obliterate!”

Wang Xian roared and flew toward the members of the southern royal family.

His blood was burning rapidly in his body. It turned into dragon energy and unleashed a terrifying attack.

Wang Xian’s arm turned into a dragon claw. The Five Elements Millstone on his head turned into a radius of five kilometers.

A gray beam of light shot toward Nangong Jianghe.

“What?”

The sudden change alarmed everyone in Yingtian Peak.

Nangong Jianghe’s expression changed drastically when he sensed Wang Xian’s attack.

“Break for me!”

He raised his head and opened his mouth. A pillar of fire shot toward the five elements millstone.

“Oh no, let’s escape!”

“What a terrifying aura. Let’s Dodge! Let’s Dodge quickly!”

The sudden outbreak of the battle caused the expressions of the few factions around the southern royal family to change drastically. They fled to the left and right in terror.

“This aura!”

When the supreme headmaster and Patriarch Fengchi saw Wang Xian attacking the southern royal family, their expressions changed drastically.

This time, a hint of shock appeared in their eyes.

“Five elements millstone, explode!”

Wang Xian, who was charging towards the southern royal family, shouted again with a murderous aura.

In the sky, another five elements millstone appeared.

One was a dharma idol and the other was a weapon.

A destructive energy attacked the experts and disciples behind the southern royal family.

“Run, this energy is not something you can resist!”

“Only my sect, Attack!” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Southern Royal River revealed a panicked expression and shouted anxiously.
