3382 2281 among the eldest senior brothers of the Thunder Ray race

“Did you hear? Senior brother Wang Xian is instructing a group of disciples in the martial arts practice field. Many female senior brothers and sisters are there!”

“You just found out. I heard that even senior sister Lei Yunzi is serving senior brother Wang Xian tea. Ahhh, my goddess!”

“Senior brother Wang Xian is ranked third on the ranking list of the disciples of our Thunder Ray race. He is simply a monster!”

The news of Wang Xian teaching a group of disciples in the martial arts practice field spread quickly. Many disciples rushed over upon hearing the news.

Since Wang Xian had decided to teach them and repay the Great Elder’s kindness, he was not impatient at all.

In the heaven-opening and Primal Chaos Continent, there was no distinction between night and night. Age was calculated according to the era.

Therefore, ten days to half a month might just be the time for them to think about a problem.

It would take them a few months to travel casually here. One could imagine how worthless time was.

Wang Xian continued to teach for five days. Later, more disciples rushed over.

He didn’t mind and patiently taught them one by one.

This allowed his prestige to rise rapidly in front of the disciples of the Lightning race.

At this moment, more than a thousand disciples gathered in the martial arts practice field. All of them were looking at the figure sitting in front of them with admiration.

“Senior brother Wang Xian is so powerful. He can easily point out any difficulties in his cultivation. He’s too powerful!”

“Yeah, I feel that he’s even more powerful than eldest senior brother!”

“Eldest brother? I feel that he’s even more powerful than our elders. You must know that even fourth senior sister is asking senior brother Wang Xian for advice!”

Some of the surrounding disciples were discussing in low voices.

“Senior brother Wang Xian, have some tea.”

Beside Wang Xian, Lei Yunzi, Lei Zhengyun and the rest were talking enthusiastically.

Wang Xian smiled faintly. He looked at the disciples in front of him and gave him some advice.

“That Wang Xian is too strong. Let’s report this matter to eldest senior brother!”

“HMM, from the look of senior brother Lei Yunzi, he must have a good impression of that Wang Xian. If eldest senior brother knew about this, he would definitely be furious!”

“He should teach Wang Xian a good lesson!”

Three middle-aged men at the side transmitted their voices to each other.

Although his current strength had not reached the level of a level eight universe knight, he was almost invincible among level seven universe knights.

The three of them had obtained a lot of benefits from following the eldest senior brother.

Now, they could be ranked in the top 20 among the group of disciples.

They knew that their eldest senior brother liked Lei Yunzi.

They would also report to their eldest senior brother on the situation regarding Lei Yunzi in a timely manner.

Now that Lei Yunzi was so attentive to Wang Xian, it was definitely a big deal for their eldest senior brother. If they didn’t report to him immediately, he would definitely punish them afterward.

The three of them exchanged a glance and left immediately.

They had absolute confidence in their eldest senior brother’s strength.

Previously, second senior brother and third senior sister were Frank. Even if they joined forces, they weren’t a match for eldest senior brother.

One could imagine how strong eldest senior brother’s strength was!

“Oh? Is What You Said True?”

Half an hour later, in the Thunder Ray grotto-heaven above the main hall of the Thunder Ray Tribe!

This grotto-heaven was the most powerful grotto-heaven of the Lightning race, and it was also the most important one.

However, not everyone could cultivate here.

Among the disciples, only the most powerful eldest senior brother or eldest senior sister had the qualifications to cultivate here.

At this moment, a burly middle-aged man flew out from inside.

The middle-aged man had an unangry look on his face and was surrounded by lightning. At this moment, he asked with a gloomy expression.

“Eldest senior brother, we only came to report after we went to investigate!”

A middle-aged man said respectfully.

They were filled with reverence towards eldest senior brother.

Among the group of disciples, eldest senior brother was the strongest existence in the current generation.

“Wang Xian? Tell me all the information about him. The martial arts practice field is teaching disciples. Humph, I would like to experience it!”

As eldest senior brother spoke, he snorted lightly and flew directly in the direction of the Thunder Ray Race’s Disciple’s martial arts practice field.

The three middle-aged men immediately followed behind and told eldest senior brother all the information about Wang Xian.

“A purebred divine dragon? Less than 20 eras? The combat strength of a universe knight at level seven?”

When eldest senior brother heard the information about Wang Xian, his expression changed slightly.

“HMPH, all the heaven’s favorites are still weaklings before they become strong!”

He was silent for dozens of seconds before he snorted coldly with a sullen face.

However, there was a hint of pressure in his eyes.

Whoosh

When they arrived at the Lightning Race’s martial arts practice field, eldest senior brother scanned his surroundings.

“Eldest senior brother, this way!”

The three of them brought him to the martial arts practice field.

Around them, there were some disciples walking towards that place.

“Eh? Eldest senior brother, greetings, eldest senior brother!”

“Greetings, eldest senior brother!”

When some of the disciples saw their eldest senior brother, they were slightly shocked and quickly greeted him with respect.

Eldest senior brother did not say anything and walked straight in.

“Wow, that junior brother is really lucky. He actually made a breakthrough on the spot under the guidance of senior brother Wang Xian!”

“It’s senior brother Wang Xian who is too powerful. He is simply invincible!”

The moment they entered, they heard exclamations coming from the front.

Eldest senior brother frowned slightly and looked forward.

When he saw Lei Yunzi who was standing beside a young man, his expression changed slightly.

He had liked Lei Yunzi for a long time, but his attitude towards him was very ordinary.

Now that he saw Lei Yunzi looking at the disciple named Wang Xian with admiration, he clenched his fists slightly.

“Eldest senior brother, you have to calm down. The elders in our family have instructed us to befriend this Wang Xian!”

The three middle-aged disciples at the side sensed the aura emitted from him and immediately reminded him.

“Only by sparring between disciples can we improve better!”

Eldest senior brother’s gaze was a little cold as his figure moved slightly.

“Next problematic disciple, come up!”

At this moment, Wang Xian’s voice sounded.

In the middle, the young man bowed with an excited face and walked to the side.

“I have…”

A female disciple was about to go up when she suddenly saw a figure appearing in the middle. She was slightly stunned. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“I have a cultivation problem!”

The eldest senior brother who came to the middle stared at Wang Xian and asked faintly.

“Eh? This is… This is the eldest senior brother!”

“What is the eldest senior brother doing here? Is he here to consult senior brother Wang Xian? This…”

“Does the eldest senior brother need to consult senior brother Wang Xian about his strength?”

The sudden appearance of the eldest senior brother in the middle shocked all the surrounding disciples.

Lei Yunzi, who was beside Wang Xian, was slightly stunned. Then, he frowned slightly.

“Ask Away!”

When Wang Xian heard the discussions around him, he raised his eyebrows slightly and took a sip of tea.
