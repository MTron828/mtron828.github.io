Chapter 572: Unparalleled In Refining Elixir Pills And Equipment (1)

All the female disciples from Mt. Xue were stunned. Those few other young disciples from Yong Chang Immortal Sect were equally shocked as they stared at the shop before them in astonishment.

A small shop. Moreover, it was among the smallest shops in the vicinity.

Within the shop, the walls were empty without any dazzling spiritual equipment. There wasn’t any aroma of elixir pills either.

The entire shop was at most twenty to thirty square meters.

This is the shop of a master?

A master would stay in a shop like this?

The group was completely dumbfounded.

“Pfft! Senior sister Piao Lingxue, are you sure this is the shop of that master? Would a master stay in a shop like this?”

A young disciple from Yong Chang Immortal Sect found this hilarious and commented.

Behind them, the group of disciples from Mt. Xue looked at the small shop, baffled.

“There seems to be a young man in it. Could it be that the young man is the blacksmith master?

“This... Why do I find this to be unbelievable?”

“Take a look at the signboard on the doors of the shop. Alchemist master and blacksmith master! How reassuring!”

The group broke into discussions after seeing the small shop.

“This is obviously a front for scams. Girls, don’t be scammed by them!”

A middle-aged man passing by reminded them out of good will after seeing the group of beautiful girls and hearing their conversation.

When the group heard the middle-aged man, they nodded their heads instinctively.

The shop is obviously a front for scams...

“Let’s go in!”

Piao Lingxue took a deep breath. Seeing the small shop once again, she found herself to be a little ridiculous too.

Why did I even decide to go in previously? However, she was lucky to have gone in. Otherwise, she would have missed out on a great blacksmith master!

“Let’s go!”

Seeing their Grand Senior sister walking in without further explanation, the group of disciples from Mt. Xue entered out of curiosity despite feeling a little weird.

“I would like to see what kind of master would be in a shop like this!”

When Ye Feng saw the entire small shop, the edge of his mouth inclined upwards as he walked in.

It’s a shame that the shop was a little too small. After a dozen-odd people had gone in, it became a little crowded.

This caused the group of disciples from Mt. Xue to feel a little speechless.

Every single shop nearing the center of Yong Chang City was huge. For large elixir pill shops and weapon shops, customers wouldn’t feel squeezed even if there were a hundred customers in them.

This...

Huh?

At this moment, Wang Xian saw the group stepping into his shop. Seeing Piao Lingxue and that little brat at the front of the pack, his eyes beamed with excitement.

“You girls are back!”

Wang Xian stood up with a smile. He looked around and commented, “It seems like Ms. Piao has brought me quite a number of customers!”

Wang Xian smiled radiantly. From this group of people, he could pick up the smell of metal and spiritual medicine.

“You are the blacksmith master?” Ye Feng squinted his eyes, scrutinized Wang Xian from head to bottom and asked plainly.

“You are interested in refining equipment?” Wang Xian looked at Ye Feng and asked directly.

“Refine equipment?” Ye Feng shook his head and answered plainly, “I saw your signboard saying that there is a blacksmith master and alchemist master. I would like to meet both masters!”

“Oh! The shop is small. If you wish to see them, perhaps you can come again when you are here to refine equipment or elixir pills. If you aren’t, please get out and let the real customers in!”

Seeing Ye Feng putting up a haughty front, Wang Xian remarked emotionlessly.

“YOU...”

Ye Feng was stunned and his face became flushed from embarrassment instantly.

“These are the customers we have brought you. What do you think? Can you lower the price you charge for refining equipment a little?”

Upon seeing Wang Xian embarrassing Ye Feng, Piao Lingxue interrupted and stopped their conversation.

She knew that Wang Xian would only give her back her swords after she paid up despite her telling him her name.

The temper of the master was undoubtedly bad!

“What’s the price Saint Forge Workshop is charging for Level 10 spiritual equipment and a Level 5 elixir pill?” Wang Xian asked the group directly.

“Two sets of materials for the equipment with a hundred spiritual stones for workmanship!

“As for pills, it would be three sets of materials for three elixir pills! Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“These are the prices of Saint Forge Workshop. All the other forge workshops and elixir pill shops in the entire Yong Chang City also charge around these prices!

“Although you are a master, I hope you won’t charge prices that deviate greatly from these prices!” Piao Lingxue said to Wang Xian.

“For the refining of spiritual equipment, I’m not charging for workmanship. As for elixir pills, I’ll give you guys four pills!” Wang Xian replied directly.

“What? You are not charging for workmanship?”

Piao Lingxue was taken aback and astonished.

“Yeah! Pass me the materials and tell me what kind of weapon you would like!” Wang Xian said to the group behind Piao Lingxue.

“Not charging for workmanship? Are there really such great deals in this world? Really?”

Behind Piao Lingxue, the group of female disciples from Mt. Xue was shocked to hear Wang Xian. Their eyes widened in shock and were fixed on Wang Xian.

They were hesitant. The lower price had instead given them the feeling that this shop wouldn’t be reliable.

“Bei Ling, pass him your materials!”

Seeing the disciples behind her hesitating, Piao Lingxue spoke to Bei Ling, who was standing beside her.

“Alright, Great Senior sister!”

When Bei Ling heard Piao Lingxue, she handed the materials for forging the spiritual equipment to Wang Xian.

“Level 11 Crystal Metal. I would like to forge a Level 11 spiritual sword!”

Bei Ling handed the metal to Wang Xian but was still a little doubtful of him.

“What’s the length, thickness, weight and special requirements, if any?!”

Wang Xian took the materials. The two sets of materials were each the size of a human head.

It was definitely more than two sets of materials!

“I can even have it custom made?”

Bei Ling was taken aback and looked at Wang Xian in shock.

Custom-made weapons. If a blacksmith master was to custom-make a weapon for a customer, the price would be hefty.

This could be considered as specially crafted and would be a lot more troublesome for the blacksmith master.

The fees for custom-made weapons by a blacksmith master would definitely not be lower than a thousand spiritual stones!

“It isn’t much more troublesome. Tell me all your requirements!” Wang Xian said plainly to Bei Ling.

“Alright. Thank you!”

Bei Ling nodded her head. Following which, she told Wang Xian the most appropriate length, breadth and weight for her sword!

“Wait here for ten minutes!”

Wang Xian nodded his head as he headed for the second story with the materials.

“Grand Senior sister, he... Is he really a blacksmith master? Ten minutes? Ten minutes to forge Level 11 spiritual equipment?”

When Bei Ling heard Wang Xian, she was once again shocked as she asked Piao Lingxue blankly.

“Yeah. Grand Senior sister, how could he possibly finish a piece of spiritual equipment in ten minutes? Moreover, we are talking about Level 11 spiritual equipment. Which blacksmith master wouldn’t take one to two days?”

The surrounding disciples turned to their Great Senior sisters and clearly couldn’t believe Wang Xian.

“You will know in ten minutes!”

If she had not witnessed him using just ten minutes to restore her Bo Yu sword and forge six other miniature Bo Yu swords, she wouldn’t have believed either.

“Ten minutes! It’s impossible to forge Level 11 spiritual equipment in ten minutes. Putting aside blacksmith master, even a blacksmith grand master wouldn’t be capable of that!”

“If he really forges Level 11 spiritual equipment in ten minutes, I will eat the spiritual equipment!”

Ye Feng heard Wang Xian. With his understanding of refining equipment, he snorted and remarked right away.

“That’s right. Even Senior brother Ou Ziming requires a day to forge an Inborn Spiritual Weapon. Even if he relied on a Level 12 forging table, he would still require several hours. How could he possibly forge Level 11 spiritual equipment in ten minutes? Senior sister Piao Lingxue, is this a scam?”

Another disciple beside Ye Feng also commented with indignance.
