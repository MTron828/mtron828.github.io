Chapter 154: Venomous Sea Snake

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

Note: The venomous sea snake within this chapter refers to a type of snake often found in historical Chinese culture that has the ability to evolve into a dragon.

Xiao Yu grumbled as she explained to Wang Xian.

After learning the causes and effects, Wang Xian also frowned. No matter how one looked at this, the groom’s actions weren’t right.

A wedding should be a joyous event. Since they had decided to get married, they should complete the wedding joyously. Now that it had turned out this way, it was only natural that Uncle Zhang wasn’t pleased.

“Perhaps the groom’s family is trying to show they are infuriated by doing so. What an egocentric family! Sister Li’s boyfriend isn’t helping the situation. He doesn’t have a backbone,” Xiao Yu grumbled and felt indignance for Sister Li.

Wang Xian frowned and commented, “Forget it. It’s not appropriate for us to speak on this. Let’s just follow Uncle Zhang’s decision.”

Since this was relating to Sister Li’s wedding, it wasn’t appropriate for Wang Xian to comment on it.

“Xiao Xian, Xiao Yu. Are you guys there?”

“Can it be that these kids have gone to bed?”

At this moment, a foreign voice sounded from outside their home. The voice seemed to be from a neighbour of theirs.

“Sleep!”

Wang Xian said softly to Xiao Yu before walking towards his room.

Xiao Yu also stuck out her tongue playfully as she headed for her room.

They had seen the true colors of these people and there wasn’t a point to keep in contact with them.

When one got rich, others would claim to be your relative even if you stayed deep in the mountains. On the contrary, when one was poor, no one would show concern for you even if you lived in a lively city.

“Can it be that these kids aren’t at home?”

“Their car is still here. Where else could they go?”

“I guess they have gone to bed?”

Some people commented at the doorstep. Seeing that they weren’t getting a response from within the house, they shook their heads helplessly as they turned back.

In this small area with 70-80 families, the news of the Wang siblings getting rich had spread within a few hours.

They drove a luxury car that cost several million and even gave Old Zhang’s family gifts that cost $400,000 – $500,000.

This made many people jealous.

And they had come over to get on the good books of the Wang siblings in hopes of getting some benefits.

“You guys don’t even take a second look at them and weren’t willing to help them with the simplest thing in the past. Now, you guys are trying to curry favor from them? These kids aren’t silly!”

Just a short distance away, Uncle Zhang sat at the entrance of his house. He shook his head in contempt as he saw the group of people.

Only by treating others with sincerity would you be returned with sincerity.

Wang Xian took an hour nap in the afternoon. He took out his phone to play after getting bored.

If it wasn’t because of Sister Li’s wedding, Wang Xian wasn’t thinking of returning during the National Day holidays.

Other than Uncle Zhang’s family, there wasn’t anything that he felt sentimental about in this place.

After having dinner at Uncle Zhang’s place, he returned to his home.

Xiao Yu continued with her cultivation enthusiastically. One could easily tell the advancements she was making as she had the Inborn Constitution.

Xiao Yu got a little addicted to the feeling of getting stronger quickly.

8 pm. The sky had turned dark. In places like the village, there wasn’t anyone walking around at 8 pm.

Around the village, faint moonlight shone on the hazy world.

“I’ll go take a look.”

Xiao Yu was practicing her cultivation. Wang Xian was bored from having nothing to do. Recalling his conversation with Uncle Zhang in the afternoon, he got up and headed out.

Lake Xianfeng was just three to four hundred meters from his house. The lake was so huge that one could not see the end of it.

This was a naturally-formed lake. The villagers had occupied the area near the shores to rear fish. As for the deeper waters, there was a rule that limited fishing to five days a year.

During these five days, Lake Xianfeng would be extremely lively. Even people from nearby cities might come over for fishing.

Although it couldn’t be compared to other large sized lakes in the country, Lake Xianfeng was still rather famous.

Wang Xian arrived at the lake and saw the glittering water under the moonlight.

He removed his underwear and jumped right into the lake.

Based on Uncle Zhang’s account, the fish in Lake Xianfeng had mysteriously disappeared. This was definitely not common. Perhaps this is caused by some animals or even Ancient Martial Artists! Let’s take a closer look! Wang Xian thought to himself before jumping in and swimming deeper into the lake.

As he dived into the lake, he gradually changed into a five to six meters long five-colored divine dragon.

The water near the edges was shallow. Wang Xian swayed his dragon tail as he swam rapidly towards the center of the lake.

His current speed was incredibly fast. In just five minutes, he had swum seven to eight kilometers.

The depth was over ten meters and the bottom of the lake was just mud.

Indeed, there aren’t many fish in the surroundings!

Wang Xian looked around in shock. Due to restrictions on fishing in Lake Xianfeng, there should be a lot of fish. Whenever the fishing season arrived, the people had been able to catch over 100,000 tons of fish easily.

Yet, there were barely any fish left at this moment.

Wang Xian observed the surroundings carefully as he moved within the lake.

Nope, nope!

He covered the surrounding with his Dragon Power but couldn’t sense any abnormality in the surrounding.

He looked across and hesitated for a moment before swimming in the East direction.

After swimming four to five kilometers, Wang Xian found that the bottom of the entire lake was abnormally ordinary. However, it was also because it was so ordinary that it was a little creepy.

Wang Xian felt like he was in a no man’s land while staying under the water. There wasn’t anyone around and the surroundings were serene and cold.

“Eh, this place...”

Wang Xian observed his front direction.

This place was even more desolate than the center of the lake. There wasn’t even any animal in the surroundings.

Not even one or two small fish.

And at the bottom of the lake in front of Wang Xian, it was abnormally pitch dark.

He swam over and realized that it was a strange species of seagrass.

“Black seagrass?”

Wang Xian was surprised and grabbed it with his dragon claw.

Sss sss!

Wang Xian felt a corroding sensation on his dragon claw and was instantly shocked.

These seagrasses were poisonous!

Looking ahead, he noted that the areas covered by the seagrasses weren’t small. It spanned approximately two thousand meters in radius.

He swam slowly above the seagrass and looked down at this strange region.

“That is...!”

Wang Xian squinted his eyes and looked at the middle of the grass.

At that place, there were nine caves. As to how deep these caves were, Wang Xian couldn’t sense it.

Nonetheless, the entrance of each cave was at least one meter in width.

What’s inside must be what’s responsible for the disappearance of all the fish within Lake Xianfeng!

Wang Xian swam slowly above the cave entrance as he focused on the cave.

Growl!

The cave was extremely deep. Based on his senses, it should be over ten meters deep and he couldn’t see what was in there.

He let out a light roar that carried the dragon power towards to cave.

Sss sss sss!

At this moment, a sound that resembled a poisonous snake hissing propagated across.

There were nine caves and nine pairs of black eyes were staring at him. Their black tongues had the shape of a triangle.

This was a species of snake. What really surprised Wang Xian was that where their heads were, there were bulging “buns.”

The nine snakes only revealed their heads and stared coldly at Wang Xian.

“These are...”

Seeing the snakes that extended from nine caves, a thought came to his mind.

Venomous Sea Snake: Level 10

Extractable Dragon Energy: 235,432

Possess Wind Divine Dragon’s bloodline

“Venomous Sea Snake! An animal that possesses the bloodline of the divine dragon!”

Wang Xian looked at the nine venomous sea snakes in shock. Extractable Dragon Energy from them was even higher than Roving Heavens. They must be horrifyingly strong.

Suddenly, he recalled the animal in ancient Chinese culture.

A venomous sea snake evolved into a serpent in 500 years. A serpent evolved into a dragon in 1,000 years. A dragon evolved into a horned-dragon in 500 years and into a winged-dragon in 1,000 years.

Winged-dragons had wings and were commonly known as the Wind Dragon.

This animal was an existence that had the bloodline of the divine dragon. Looking at their bulging heads, they must be evolving into serpents soon!
