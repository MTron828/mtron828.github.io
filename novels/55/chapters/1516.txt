Chapter 1517: 1517, under the purification bar

“Damn it, the judgement mercenary group, when you encounter danger, not only do you not protect your employer, you want us to buy you time!”

In the Divine Kingdom Forest, when a sword light directly landed in front of them, blocking their path, Old Hu and the others revealed angry expressions.

The old woman could not help but loudly rebuke them.

“Life and death are in the hands of fate, don’t blame us!”

The leader of the judgement mercenary group said with a ruthless expression.

They knew that once the heavenly moat demons encountered humans, they would definitely not let them off.

Therefore, they pretended to beg for mercy, buying some time before turning around and escaping.

As for the hiring? In front of their lives, the mission was no longer important. Today, it was already good enough for them to be able to save their lives!

“How could this be? Li Si, save me, save me!”

At this moment, the body of a girl who was standing at the front had already frozen.

She looked at the youth who had directly escaped and looked at the ferocious heavenly moat demon in front of her. Her face revealed a terrified expression.

“Cunning humans, escape? Can you escape?”

“Not good, they have surrounded the entire area!”

“It’s over, it’s over, we’re completely finished. There are still ten heavenly moat demons!”

Suddenly, when the old woman, Old Hu, and the others saw the sword light disappear and were about to escape, a terrified and despairing expression came from the front.

They hurriedly looked over and found that the members of the judgement mercenary group who were about to escape were slowly retreating towards them.

“The heavenly moat demon is very intelligent. How could he let you escape so easily!”

Old Hu’s face was ashen as he looked around. His face was so gloomy that it was almost dripping blood. He looked at the old woman beside him.

“Everyone, come to my side!”

The old woman moved her hand and a formation compass appeared in her hand.

“Kill them. Don’t let them hide in the formation!”

The heavenly moat demon saw the formation compass appear in the old woman’s hand, and immediately opened his huge mouth and roared.

“Quick, Quick!”

The old woman roared loudly, and a light barrier covered their surroundings.

“Wait for us, we’ll enter too, we’ll enter too!”

The two half-step void interpretation experts of the judgement mercenary group saw the formation light up, and a trace of hope appeared on their faces. Their figures moved, and they directly flew in this direction.

“Ahhhh!”

Just as the judgement mercenary group fled into the formation, miserable screams sounded.

In the surroundings, a group of heavenly moat demons had already attacked them.

Those weaker members were directly captured and turned into food.

“Quick!”

The judgement mercenary group revealed terrified expressions, and they desperately fled into the formation.

“You people of the judgement mercenary group are shameless enough to come back!”

Seeing that they wanted to rush in, the old woman’s face was extremely gloomy.

“Let us in, there’s hope in numbers!”

The leader of the judgement mercenary group shouted anxiously. He was very fast, and just as the array was about to close, he directly rushed in.

“Hurry Up!”

He looked at the demons around him and shouted at his subordinates.

“Peng Peng Peng!”

The members of the judgement mercenary group rushed in one by one. The array was just about to close.

“Zi Zi Zi!”

A terrifying power landed on the array, emitting a sound of corrosion.

“Do you think we can’t break through a Level 1 void interpretation array? All of you humans will become our food!”

Brutal sounds came from outside as attacks fell one after another.

“Boom!”

With a loud sound, ripples and roars appeared on the formation.

“Judgement mercenary group, I didn’t expect you to be so despicable. Not only did you run away, you even wanted us to stay behind. You guys are really ruthless!”

A woman saw their judgement mercenary group enter the formation and roared angrily.

Because the members of the Holy Medicine Hall were all together, the array formation directly enveloped them.

Even the girl at the front was also enveloped.

“Now you still want to stay inside our array formation. Let Me Tell You, Our Holy Medicine Hall will not let you off this matter!”

The old woman turned her head and stared at the judgement mercenary group with a cold expression.

“We... We only made this decision in a moment of desperation!”

The members of the judgement mercenary group said with a somewhat embarrassed expression.

“Let’s not talk about this for now. We don’t even know if we’ll be able to escape this time!”

The leader of the judgement mercenary group glanced at the old woman and the others with a gloomy expression and looked around the array formation.

“Peng Peng Peng!”

“The void interpretation first rank array formation won’t be able to stop us for long. Break it for me and eat them!”

A violent collision roar came from outside, causing their expressions to constantly change.

“Father, what should we do? The formation can only last for five minutes at most. After five minutes, what should we do?”

Li Si walked over with a face full of fear and said in fear.

“Hehe, a bunch of cowards. Since they are surrounded by the heavenly moat demons, they can only fight since they can’t escape!”

“The array can only last for three minutes at most!”

Old Hu held the scepter of light in his hand and looked around helplessly.

“What? Only three minutes? I don’t want to die, I don’t want to Die!”

“I just took the graduation exam, I don’t want to Die!”

A few girls heard Old Hu’s words and shouted in fear. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

The eyes of the three women were filled with fear.

A sense of despair slowly spread.

Wang Xian stood there and coldly glanced at the members of the judgement mercenary group. He looked at the demons outside.

“Young man, you are not afraid in such a situation. Your Courage is commendable!”

At this moment, Old Hu’s exclamation could be heard from the side.

He passed a jug of wine over. “Wine strengthens one’s courage!”

“It’s just a few demonic beasts below the insightful void tier. They can’t die, so why are you afraid?”

Wang Xian said to him nonchalantly.

Old Hu was slightly stunned by his words and looked at him in astonishment.

Around him, the old woman and the three women who were closer looked at Wang Xian in astonishment.

“Young man, you... You have a solution?”

The old woman looked at Wang Xian with uncertainty and asked in anticipation.

“They’re just a bunch of animals. Just kill them directly!”

Wang Xian said with a smile.

“Kill? How Do I kill them? You make it sound so easy?”

Li Si looked at Wang Xian and growled with an embarrassed expression.

“Of course, your judicial mercenary group will be the ones to kill them. Aren’t you responsible for our safety?”

Wang Xian looked at them indifferently.

“You... YOU MOTHERF * cker...”

Crack! Crack

“Ah, the formation is about to crack!”

Just as Li Si was about to curse out loud, the sound of the formation cracking was heard in horror.

Everyone looked over in horror. Cracks appeared on the formation.

“Young man, if you have any ideas, just say it now. An old man like me can’t Take It!”

“If not, it would be worth it even if I Die!”

Lao Hu’s expression changed slightly as he said bitterly to Wang Xian.

“Holy light illumination, exorcism, light shield!”

Wang Xian waved his arm and a staff appeared in his hand. Beams of holy light landed on their bodies.
