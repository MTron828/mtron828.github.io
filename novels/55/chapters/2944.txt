Chapter 2945: easily swept through the glass region’s tremor 3

“Hahaha, I’ve broken through, I’ve finally broken through!”

“Roar Roar Roar!”

An incomparably excited roar sounded. Within the Creator’s secret base, the 35,000 meter devouring dragon let out an excited roar in the sky.

Its huge and savage body gave off a savage and bloodthirsty aura.

!!

That terrifying dragon head, 18 sharp claws, and huge body were like monsters from the depths of the universe.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

“Congratulations leader! Congratulations leader!”

A Million Devouring Dragons roared loudly from the surroundings.

“TSK TSK TSK, the combat strength of a fourth rank void God Emperor. What a terrifying aura. I feel that even a single look from ao crab can make me tremble!”

At a place below, Mo sha looked at Ao crab who was emitting an endless might in the sky and said with envy.

“You are three levels lower than ao crab. You have no chance of resisting in front of ao crab.”

The sky array said to Mo Sha with a smile.

“Dragon King!”

At this moment, ao crab, who was in the sky, turned into a human form excitedly. He came to Wang Xian’s side respectfully and shouted.

“Very good, very good. A fourth level void God realm divine emperor. He should be an invincible existence in this resplendent starry sky!”

Wang Xian said with a smile.

“Hehe, this is all thanks to the Dragon King and the brothers of the Dragon Palace who gave all the resources of the machine royal territory to us, the devouring dragon. After we leave, we will immediately help the brothers sweep through the chimei territory and get all the resources for the Brothers!”

Ao he said with a smile.

“At least you have some conscience!”

Ba Qi and the rest said in satisfaction.

“Let’s go. We have been here for a long time. It’s time for us to leave!”

Wang Xian looked around. All the machines in the entire base had been devoured by the devouring dragon. There was nothing left.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Everyone nodded happily and flew out immediately.

Buzz

They broke through the spatial rift and returned to the void.

“Let’s go to the glazed domain. They should be done with the other side!”

Wang Xian scanned his surroundings and said.

“Huh?”

However, as soon as he finished speaking, he sensed that the communication stone plate in his mother nest was trembling violently.

He raised his eyebrows slightly.

The secret base created by the creator used a special material to isolate all kinds of signals.

Now that he was out, all kinds of messages were displayed.

Wang Xian took out his communication stone plate and realized that many people had sent him many messages.

Invincible battle technique, Hong Fengyan, the god Emperor of Shangshui, and the domain Lord.

“Invincible battle technique has also sent me a lot of messages!”

At this moment, Heaven Array, who was at the side, said in surprise.

“This is?”

When Wang Xian opened the messages one by one, he was slightly taken aback.

Invincible battle technique had sent him over a hundred messages. The last message was that boss Wang was already crying. Hurry up and reply. If you don’t come back soon, you probably won’t be able to see me anymore. I’m going to die!

The Governor had sent him over a dozen messages. Hong Fengyan had also sent him over a dozen messages.

When he saw the messages one by one, he revealed an extremely shocked expression.

“The chimei territory has actually conquered the entire glazed domain, the four great demon caves, and the leaders of the four great divine emperors?”

Wang Xian asked in astonishment.

“Oh?”

Prime Minister Gui and the rest were also in shock.

“The chimei territory actually has such a powerful existence?”

They were slightly surprised, but soon, the eight-limbed demon fiend and the rest were excited.

Good. The stronger the demons of the Chimei region were, the more resources they could obtain.

“Dragon King, the glazed region is in a great crisis!”

Tian Chen frowned slightly and said. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Okay!”

Wang Xian nodded. “I’ll contact invincible battle technique and ask him about the situation there!”

As he spoke, he immediately called invincible battle technique.

At this moment, at the frontline of the Holy Region, invincible battle technique and his senior sister were standing there, quietly waiting for all sorts of news.

“Ahahahaha!”

All of a sudden, invincible battle technique jumped up in excitement.

At the side, the soldiers and powerhouses who were enveloped by sadness and fear jumped up in excitement when they saw invincible battle technique. Their faces were filled with anger as they glared at him.

Second senior sister also looked at him in astonishment.

“Ah Ah Ah Ah, I finally got in touch with boss Wang. I finally got in touch with him. Boohoo!”

At this moment, invincible battle technique shouted in excitement.

“Huh?”

Second senior sister looked stunned at the side. Soon after, an excited expression appeared on her face.

“Boss Wang, Boss Wang, you finally replied to the message. Do you know that invincible battle technique missed you so much? I missed you so much!”

Invincible battle technique looked at Wang Xian in the picture on the communication stone plate. He was so excited that he almost cried.

“Scram. Don’t be disgusting. Tell me what’s going on in the glazed area now.”

Wang Xian had a disgusted look on his face when he heard his words. He immediately said.

“Boss Wang, we are in big trouble. The entire glazed area has been occupied by Yaoxie. Now, we have escaped to the Holy Region!”

“But behind us, there are two great devil dens pursuing us. Many people from the glazed domain have not escaped to this side. The situation is very dangerous now.”

“Boss Wang, what is the situation on your side? We thought that you were ambushed by the Machine Emperor Realm. Help us, boss Wang!”

“The glazed domain can’t do it now. They are no match for Yaoxie from the Chimei territory. Now, there are two third level divine emperors in the two devil dens. There are about fifty other divine emperors. If they attack us now, we will be finished!”

“The holy domain and the glazed domain are preparing to fight to the death here. They will definitely not allow Yaoxie to occupy the Holy Domain Again!”

Invincible battle technique was full of excitement as he spoke non-stop.

“Is the situation so critical now?”

Upon hearing his words, Wang Xian raised his eyebrows slightly and asked.

“It’s extremely urgent, boss Wang. Hurry up and come over. If you are late, you will have to collect my corpse!”

Invincible battle technique said loudly.

“Alright, ask your master for all the information on the chimei territory. Send the information over. I’ll send the members of the Dragon Palace over immediately!”

Wang Xian pondered for a moment and said.

“Alright, boss Wang. Alright!”

Invincible battle technique nodded immediately.

“Hahaha, boss Wang said to send the powerhouses of the Dragon Palace over immediately. Let’s go, let’s go and tell master and the rest!”

Seeing the video end, invincible battle technique immediately flew toward the center.

Second senior sister also followed behind with excitement.

The experts and soldiers of the glazed domain all looked excited. They were hopeful.

The Dragon Palace was here. At least they could resist the attacks of the two demon caves.

“Master, master, boss Wang sent a video. He has contacted boss Wang. The Dragon Palace will send its members over immediately!”

In the center of the battle line, a group of celestial emperors sat there quietly.

The voice of invincible battle techniques made all of them stand up immediately. Their eyes were filled with hope.
