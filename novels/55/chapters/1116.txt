Chapter 1117: 1118 Star Moon Kingdom’s counterattack

Translator: 5496903

“Leader of the Wind Eye clan, Mou Zesen pays his respects to the Dragon King. I swear to follow the Dragon King to the death!”

In front of the Dragon Palace, the leader of the Wind Eye clan, a powerhouse at the first level of the Seethrough void stage, flew directly to Wang Xian’s side and bowed respectfully to him.

“Mou Zesen? You guys have your own surnames?”

Wang Xian looked at Mou Zesen with a hint of surprise on his face.

“Yes, Dragon King. Our Wind Eye clan once entered human society and lived with humans for a period of time. However, we were betrayed by humans, so we returned to the ocean once again!”

Mu Zesen replied respectfully.

Wang Xian nodded. It was not unusual for Demonic Beasts to live together with humans.

Looking at the first expert of the Dragon Palace who was at the profound void tier, Wang Xian was very satisfied. He had just arrived at the transcendence continent, but he had already subdued an expert of the profound void tier. This was great news.

Moreover, with the addition of the Wind Eye clan, the Dragon Palace’s strength would be much stronger.

“How many people are there in the Wind Eye Clan?”

Wang Xian asked directly.

“Reporting to the Dragon King, there are a total of 430 people in the Wind Eye clan. The people who came with me are the main force of the Wind Eye clan!”

Mou Zesen replied respectfully.

“Call all your clansmen over and break through the Dragon Gate!”

Wang Xian gave him an order.

After breaking through the Dragon Gate, they would officially become members of the Dragon Palace. Only then could they enter the Dragon Palace to cultivate.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Mou Zesen nodded. He looked behind and roared.

His clansmen immediately flew over.

Mou Zesen didn’t pay much attention to Wang Xian at the beginning. From his senses, Wang Xian’s strength had yet to reach the insightful void realm.

He was willing to join the Dragon Palace because of Prime Minister Gui’s threat.

However, after consuming Wang Xian’s bloodline, his vast will allowed him to consume Wang Xian 100% . Even his will was 100% obedient.

“Come and pay your respects to the Dragon King!”

Mu Zesen said directly to his clansmen.

The members of the Wind Eye clan were a little surprised by their leader’s performance. However, they were 100% obedient when their leader gave the order.

The Demon Beast clan was different from humans. The suppression of the Demon Beast bloodline was very great. The leader had the greatest authority in a clan.

Although some demon beasts had learned the human etiquette, there was one thing that had not changed. The strong were King.

Once a Demon Beast’s strength had reached the first level of the Seethrough Void Tier, they could challenge the leader. After defeating the leader, they could become the king of the clan.

It was slightly different from the human race.

“Greetings, Dragon King!”

The members of the wind-eye race knelt in front of Wang Xian respectfully.

“Keke, it seems like the poison we refined is quite effective!”

Ba Qi, who was at the side, looked satisfied when he saw the more than 100 members of the wind-eye race behind him. Their faces were pale and they looked a little drowsy. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Wang Xian smiled faintly. “Get up. Do you see the Dragon Gate behind us? Charge through it!”

“It’s the Dragon King!”

They looked at their leader and nodded immediately. Then, they moved and flew towards the Dragon Gate.

The Dragon Gate was 2,000 meters wide and over 300 meters tall. It looked very impressive.

However, all the members of the Wind Eye clan didn’t take it seriously.

They rushed towards the Dragon Gate.

“Huh?”

However, when they came to the side of the Dragon Gate, they felt a strong attraction and repulsive force.

They suddenly had a feeling that as long as they passed through, it would be like a carp leaping over the Dragon Gate.

However, they found it extremely difficult to pass through.

The members of the Wind Eye clan who looked down on them looked a little embarrassed. Soon, their eyes began to burn.

They had a strong desire in their hearts to rush over. They had to rush over.

“Come with us. I will teach you the cultivation method later!”

Wang Xian said to Mou Zesen and brought him into the Dragon Palace.

Mou Zesen followed behind Wang Xian and entered the Dragon Palace. Immediately, he felt a terrifying spiritual energy entering his body.

“This...”

A shocked expression appeared on his face as he stared at the magnificent buildings with his mouth agape.

Even though he was a powerhouse at the dimension sundering realm, this was the first time he had experienced such a powerful paradise.

“Joining the Dragon Palace and becoming the Dragon King’s subordinate is indeed the best choice!”

His eyes were burning with passion.

“Prime Minister Gui is in charge of the operation of the entire Dragon Palace. When I’m not around, listen to his arrangements!”

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Wang Xian said to him. Mou Zesen nodded his head heavily.

“Are your clan good at archery? Do you have eye-bloodline techniques?”

Prime Minister Gui asked from the side.

“That’s right. Our wind-eyed Demon Beast Clan has eye-bloodline techniques. It can increase our vision by five times and allow us to see the flow of the wind clearly. We are best at archery. The supernatural ability that we have awakened is also beneficial to archery. In the transcendence continent, our wind-eyed archery can be ranked among the top in the transcendence continent!”

Mou Zesen said confidently.

“Archery skills. Not bad. What our Dragon Palace lacks at the moment is long-range attacks. Archers are very important in both attacking and defending the city!”

Wang Xian nodded his head. Archers were like snipers. Naturally, there was no need to mention the usefulness of a sniper on the battlefield.

After practicing the Divine Wind Dragon Transformation, the wind-eyed demonic beasts would become even more terrifying!

“I’m in. Oh My God, is this the Dragon Palace? What terrifying spiritual energy!”

“I... Thank you, Dragon King. I’ve leaped through the Dragon Gate and possess the potential to become a divine dragon. I can’t feel the upper limit of my bloodline. Haha, this is great, this is great!”

The excited voices of the wind-eyed demonic beasts could be heard from behind.

Wang Xian also revealed a happy smile.

The wind-eye clan could be considered to have been lured in by Prime Minister Gui’s coaxing and threats.

In addition to the mysteriousness and intimidation of the Dragon Palace, Mu Zesen had consumed his bloodline.

However, this was also a great opportunity for them.

In the next few days, apart from attracting the wind-eye Demon Beast clan, the migration of the Dragon Palace did not cause too much of a commotion.

What made Wang Xian happy was that not only did he manage to subdue the wind-eyed demon beasts, he also obtained all the treasures of the wind-eyed demon beasts.

There were not many precious treasures, but there was one that made Wang Xian’s eyes burn with passion.

The bloodline of the wind-eyed demon beasts.

Currently, this bloodline was completely useless to the wind-eyed demon beasts. However, to Wang Xian, this was a priceless treasure.

Buzz! Buzz

Just as Wang Xian was busy dealing with the matters of the Dragon Palace for the past two days, a message suddenly came from the communication stone plate.

After reading this message, Wang Xian’s elated mood turned cold.

Zhang Fengying’s family was wiped out. Now, she was the only one who escaped.

Her younger brother, her uncle, and her other relatives were all wiped out by the ocean cultivator army.

Apart from her information, there was also information about Feng Luan.

Star-moon kingdom began to counterattack.

A kingdom’s insightful emptiness realm expert was killed, and a town was occupied. Star-moon kingdom couldn’t just ignore this!
