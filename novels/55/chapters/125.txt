Chapter 126: Challenge (1)

“That’s strange! Someone actually decided to open a medical hall here.”

“Medical halls are rarely seen nowadays, although there might still be some in the rural areas. Nonetheless, isn’t this medical hall a little too much? Treatment starts at a minimum of $2 million? Are they crazy?”

“This is likely just their publicity stunt. Each of its four rules gets more and more absurd!”

“They are probably just fooling around. Look, there’s no one here to see the doctor. Moreover, I don’t see any medicine in it.”

Outside the Divine Dragon Medical Hall, a curious crowd had gathered to take a look at this new medical hall.

Looking at the notice board placed outside, every one of them shook their head.

Disregarding the other rules, treatment fees at a minimum of $2 million could already deter many people.

$2 million? What kind of illness would require treatment of $2 million?

The crowd exchanged their views and quickly scattered. That old man that had joked that this medical hall was treating deities had also left after seeing the exorbitant price.

Wang Xian sat in the medical hall and smiled upon hearing the conversations outside the medical hall.

This was what he wanted to achieve. He did not wish that his medical hall would be as noisy as the wet market.

His positioning had been set to focus on the high-end market!

“Brother Wang Xian, you seem to be in high spirits!”

At this moment, Wang Xian heard Old Qin and Old Xue’s voice from outside the shop. There were also some family members of the Qin and Xue Families behind the two family heads.

“Congratulations on the opening of your medical hall!”

Five to six people walked in. They were all wearing smiles as they observed the surroundings.

Xue Jing and Qin Lianhui each held onto a congratulatory gift which they eventually placed on the table by the side.

Wang Xian stood up to welcome them. “I’m still waiting for Old Qin and Old Xue to direct some business to me!”

“Haha, there’s definitely business for you.” Old Xue laughed heartily. “I have introduced you to a few Ancient Martial Artists. All of them had hidden injuries on them that require treatment!”

“The directors from several hospitals in Rivertown will also be coming over in a while. They could also help to introduce patients if they fulfil the criteria!” Old Qin replied.

“I really have to thank you guys then! Let’s have a feast for lunch,” Wang Xian smiled and replied.

Just as they were chatting, a middle-aged man and an old man arrived at the entrance.

Carrying the congratulatory gifts in their hands, they took a look at the signboard to confirm the location before entering.

“Eh, isn’t that the director of the Number 1 hospital in Rivertown? I recognize him. He’s incredible!”

“That... That seems to be the director of the Number 3 hospital in Rivertown!”

“They aren’t the only ones. The directors of several other large hospitals are all there!”

“Who’s the owner of this Divine Dragon Medical Hall? Why are there so many influential figures?”

With a dozen-plus people suddenly entering a rather unique medical hall, it immediately drew the attention of many people.

Passersby, who were initially curious about the medical hall, were all shocked by what they had seen.

Considering that the directors of several large hospitals had come, it was easy to tell that the owner wasn’t someone ordinary!

“Director Li, you are here! Come in!”

As the group of hospital directors and influential people in Rivertown entered the shop, Old Qin immediately went over to welcome them.

Wang Xian smiled and followed. These were all his guests and he had to rely on them to refer business to him.

“Thank you, directors, for coming. I’m really grateful!”

Wang Xian went over and exchanged customary words.

“This must be Brother Wang Xian! Indeed, heroes are often developed from youth! May your medical hall prospers in years to come!”

“Congratulations!”

The group of hospital directors greeted enthusiastically.

Wang Xian smiled in response and exchange customary words.

He was clear that they were here because of Old Qin. Otherwise, he really wouldn’t be able to invite this group of people.

“Old Xue, I hope we aren’t late!”

Less than half an hour after the arrival of the hospital directors, another group of people entered the shop.

Different from the first batch of guests, this group of people had a unique disposition around them.

All of them had terrifying powers contained within their bodies.

“Not at all, not at all! Old Brother Duan, please come in!”

Old Xue immediately walked over and invited the old man at the front of the group.

Old Qin turned his head over and greeted with a smile, “Old Duan, I did not expect you to be here!”

“Hehe, just coming to take a look. For a miracle doctor that even Old Xue and Old Qin recommend, I naturally had to come and take a look!”

The old man smiled in response as his attention fell on Wang Xian.

“Old Duan, welcome!”

Seeing how Old Qin and Old Xue had acted, a thought struck him and he recalled a family.

Ancient Martial Arts Family, Duan Family. They were the third strongest family in Rivertown!

As for this old man in front of Wang Xian, he was most likely the family head of the Duan Family, Duan Guozhi! He’s a Martial Artist Level Eight expert!

“This must be the young miracle doctor, Wang Xian! I will have to trouble you in a while!”

Old Duan looked at Wang Xian.

“Not at all, I’m doing this as a business after all!”

Wang Xian laughed, took a glance at Old Duan and thought to himself that Old Duan must have some hidden injuries.

“Haha. Old Duan was injured during a sparring session when he was young and has not recovered since. Brother Wang Xian, you’ve got to take a good look at it in a while. The Duan Family isn’t lacking in money!” Old Xue joked.

“As long as you can cure me, money isn’t an issue!” Old Duan waved his hand proudly.

The Ancient Martial Arts Families in Rivertown weren’t dishevelled. The seven to eight families were often not seen or known by the general public. Moreover, there wasn’t deep animosity between families.

Xue Family was on the rise recently and had formed a good relationship with the Qin Family. During this period of time, things were smooth sailing for the Xue Family, and the Duan Family had chosen to maintain a cordial relationship with them.

Just as Wang Xian was entertaining his guest, a voice sounded from outside the shop suddenly.

“Divine Dragon Medical Hall? How arrogant! The divine dragon serves as our totem. Its prestige should not be encroached or infringed upon. A small medical hall dares to call itself the Divine Dragon Medical Hall? Inappropriate! It has to change its name!”

Instantly, the lively hall quietened down.

Old Xue frowned and lashed out, “Come in! You guys sure are haughty!”

“Hehe. That’s because we have the strength to back it!” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

The voice sounded again and the crowd immediately looked to the door. There were 5 people standing at the entrance with two middle-aged men in the middle.

There was also a juvenile and two young men by their left and right.

The group of five people walked into the shop. They looked around arrogantly before turning their attention to Wang Xian.

“Not bad. I can see that you have invited quite a number of people.” The slim middle-aged man smirked and commented sarcastically, “The medical hall isn’t big but there sure are quite a number of rules! As for the medical skills, it’s worth looking into but you sure are arrogant!”

Wang Xian looked at the five of them emotionlessly.

He knew two of the five people and they were none other than the middle-aged man and juvenile from the Sacred Followers Guild.

“It seems like I should have added another rule for my medical hall!”

Wang Xian looked at the five of them and smirked, “Uninvited people... And DOGS are prohibited!”

“Haha, great. What a sharp tongue you have!”

Wang Xian’s words immediately made the five of them embarrassed. The slim middle-aged man looked coldly at Wang Xian.

“You are the first person who dares to be so unruly to the Sacred Followers Guild!”

“There’s also no one in Rivertown who dares to speak to me, Yan Zhongyuan, in such a way!” the sturdy middle-aged man beside the slim middle-aged man added in a cold tone.

“Sacred Followers Guild!”

“Yan Family!”

Exclamations sounded in the medical hall!
