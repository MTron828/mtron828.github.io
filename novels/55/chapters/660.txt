Chapter 661: Dragon Vein

Translator: Larbrestudio

Argh!

Blood-curdling screams resounded in the skies constantly. Over a thousand people from the six forces had come to this place.

Among the thousand people, those below Dan Realm would be equivalent to cannon fodder in a battle of this level.

They couldn’t escape at all. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Budding Realm experts were dying under the attacks from the dragonians.

In the sky, the battle between a dozen-odd Budding Realm experts gave the martial artists of the Underworld the feeling that the apocalypse was happening right before their eyes.

A casual strike would bring with it terrifying auras that extended over several hundred to several thousand meters. Each attack seemed capable of splitting the space and sky.

As compared to the four-way battles between the Dragon King, Emperor Qi, middle-aged swordsman, and Nie Wushuang, the battle that was happening before their eyes at this moment made them feel even more fear.

The martial artists from the six overseas forces were horrified. For the very first time, they regretted their decision to step into the territory of China.

“When the Nine Cauldron Worlds descend into the real world, you guys will then know what the real Underworld is!”

Wang Xian recalled the group of people he had encountered from the Xia Cauldron world while looking at the overseas forces being annihilated rapidly.

They had said that all of Asia would be ruled by the Underworld of China. Various forces in Asia would have to pay pilgrimage to them.

If the Nine Cauldron Worlds were to truly descend into the real world and ally together, they could easily crush all other forces in Asia.

Bam!

As expert after expert from the overseas forces died, those forces and martial artists from the Underworld that had sought refuge with the overseas forces were incomparably bitter and embarrassed. They had complicated feelings and felt a little fear deep down in them.

Would the Dragon King kill them?

There was a high possibility that he might!

“Let’s go up the mountain!” Wang Xian said to Xiao Yu, Lan Qingyue, and the girls who were beside them before walking towards the mountain shrouded under the spiritual energy waterfall.

Sui Huang and Xiao Quanshan followed closely behind him.

The remaining martial artists of the Underworld hesitated for a moment before following and walking towards the mountain under the spiritual energy waterfall.

“What a dense concentration of spiritual energy. Cultivating here would shorten the time required by over ten times!”

When they reached the peak of a mountain, Lan Qingyue and the girls exclaimed in surprise.

Even for Dan Realm or Budding Realm experts, cultivating under the spiritual energy waterfall would be several tens to several hundreds times more effective.

For martial artists at the Inborn Realm and lower, the effects would be even more insane.

“Cultivating here will be just like immersing yourself in spiritual liquid!”

Wang Xian was slightly surprised too when he sensed the spiritual energy that was falling on him.

Even if he were to cultivate here for a day, he would be able to gain several tens of thousands of dragon energy.

“Dragon King, we have left six alive and kept the rest here!”

At this moment, Mo Qinglong walked over and reported.

Mmm!

Wang Xian nodded his head and looked towards the group of martial artists that had sought refuge with the overseas forces.

Sensing Wang Xian’s gaze, all the martial artists were shivering anxiously.

“Ask them to get out of this place! As for the rest, find a place and cultivate!” Wang Xian announced plainly.

“Yes!”

Mo Qinglong nodded his head and his terrifying aura swept towards those martial artists that had joined the overseas forces.

Those martial artists paled and were exceptionally bitter when they heard Wang Xian.

Their expressions changed drastically and intense hatred welled up in their hearts.

All of them left while feeling despair.

They would have never expected that the seemingly invincible overseas forces they had joined would be toyed with and killed by the Dragon King and the Dragon Sect.

Those seemingly invincible experts were all killed!

“Dragon King!”

Some martial artists gritted their teeth. Their eyes were filled with horror and a tinge of anger.

However, they could only hide this little tinge of fury away as they dared not to offend the Dragon King.

The current Dragon King was an immortal-like existence in the Underworld.

“Thank you, Dragon King!”

As for the martial artists that were following behind Wang Xian, they bowed down instantly to express their gratitude.

Every single one of them was shaking with excitement.

They had initially thought they had lost even the slightest hope.

To their astonishment, the Dragon King had returned to kill all the overseas forces and allowed them to cultivate in this place.

As for those martial artists that had joined the overseas forces previously, they were chased out of this place directly.

In the future, with the Dragon King stationed at the place where they were cultivating, they could cultivate in peace.

Wang Xian waved his arm, lifted his head and stared at the sky. A huge cauldron appeared in his sight.

“The spiritual energy of this place will likely disappear within a month or two. After its disappearance, terrifying forces will descend into this world. At that time, watch your own actions!”

Wang Xian reminded the crowd of martial artists from the Underworld.

The descent of the Nine Cauldron Worlds would be a huge blow to the martial artists of the real world.

If it wasn’t for the spiritual energy waterfall, the martial artists of the Underworld would be in a terrible state.

The appearance of the spiritual energy waterfall would give them some strength to hold their ground!

Huh?

The surrounding people looked at Wang Xian with confused looks. However, none of them raised any questions.

“Let’s cultivate here too!” Wang Xian said to Xiao Yu, Lan Qingyue and the girls.

Mmm!

The group of girls nodded their heads. They wouldn’t want to let this great chance encounter slip either.

The six of them flew to the peak of the main mountain. Xiao Yu and the other four girls sat on it and started absorbing the endless spiritual energy.

Around them, all the martial artists weren’t willing to let a single second go to waste as they sat down right away and started cultivating.

Wang Xian stood below the spiritual energy waterfall while staring at his body, which was immersed in the white spiritual energy. He looked down the mountain.

The spiritual energy is so dense that it doesn’t dissipate as it enters the mountain vein. This is truly strange!

A red and blue light flashed across and Wang Xian looked below him.

Huh?

No spiritual ore mine is formed after the spiritual energy enters the mountain vein. There isn’t any spiritual stone either. Instead, the spiritual energy seems to be modifying the mountain vein. How queer! It feels a little like a spirit array!

Wang Xian’s eyes lit up.

As the spiritual energy entered the mountain vein, it seemed to have undergone a unique change. It felt a little like dragon energy. Wang Xian started absorbing the spiritual energy and converting it into dragon energy.

The spiritual energy that entered the mountain vein was converted into another form of energy. Vaguely, Wang Xian felt that it was similar to his dragon energy.

With a change in thought, a stream of dragon energy was injected into the mountain.

“This is...?”

Wang Xian was stunned and astonished.

The spiritual energy seems to be transforming into dragon energy... It’s really dragon energy!

Wang Xian’s eyes beamed with excitement.

Dragon Energy is a middle to high tier energy in the universe. Its greatest effect would be modification.

If a place has dragon energy, it would be modified to become a place where talents and great wealth would emerge. Generally, the place would change positively.

This spiritual energy that entered the mountains is being converted into dragon energy automatically!

Spiritual energy is converted into dragon energy and the dragon energy is completely locked within the mountain vein. It seems like something is forming!

If my guess is correct, a dragon vein will be formed as dragon energy enters the mountain vein.

Legend has it that those who occupy the dragon vein will claim the throne to the entire world. This is because the dragon vein has dragon energy deep within it. The dragon energy will enlighten the people and nourish the land. It’s easier for talents and experts to be raised in this place!

That’s the reasoning behind those who occupy the dragon vein often claiming the throne to the entire world!

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered as he stared below him with fervor.

Dragon vein... Earth is the flesh of the dragon, stones are the bones of the dragon, plants are the hairs of the dragon and water is the blood of the dragon. As for the dragon vein...the only thing that would be lacking is a soul.
