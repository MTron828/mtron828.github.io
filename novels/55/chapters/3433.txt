3434 3433. The 12th cave master

“I want it!”

Wang Xian walked over slowly and spoke directly.

He was still very interested in the water lotus.

The ancestral tree could allow the water lotus to grow rapidly. Even if he could not use it for the time being, he could cultivate it slowly.

In the future, he might be able to cultivate it into a 12th grade water lotus.

“Oh?”

When everyone saw Wang Xian asking for it directly, they were surprised and looked at him.

The old man who was selling the fruits smiled.

“I don’t have any weapons, but these resources should be enough!”

Wang Xian took out some water-type fruits and presented them in front of him.

“Alright, it’s Enough!”

When the old man saw the fruits, his eyes lit up and he immediately said.

Wang Xian waved his arm and the fruits came before the old man.

The old man’s eyes lit up and he immediately kept the fruits.

“Wait!”

“I want this water lotus too!”

Just as the old man waved his hand and gave the water lotus to Wang Xian, a voice suddenly sounded.

“Huh?”

Wang Xian was slightly taken aback. The old man also turned around immediately.

Two men and a woman walked over from the side. They had four arms and tails.

All four arms were holding sharp swords. They were more than two meters tall and were green in color.

“Hey, those are… the people of the cave master of the Demoness Cave!”

“They want it too. Looks like there’s going to be a competition.”

When the crowd saw the three figures, they were surprised and whispered.

“The Cave Master of the Demoness Cave?”

When Wang Xian heard this title, he was curious.

“Venerable one, I want the Water Lotus!”

The three of them arrived. The woman in the lead spoke directly to the old man who was selling the water lotus.

“This…”

The old man looked at Wang Xian with an embarrassed expression.

“Our deal has been completed!”

Wang Xian said plainly. With a wave of his arm, the water lotus in front of him flew towards him.

Whoosh

However, when the water lotus was flying towards him, a figure started to move. With a wave of his arm, a thorn directly wrapped around the water lotus.

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly and looked at the lady who was attacking him.

“I want this water lotus. Please give my master, the Cave Master of the Demoness Cave, some face.”

The woman looked at Wang Xian indifferently and said.

“The disciple of the cave master of the Demoness Cave?”

The surrounding experts were slightly shocked when they heard his words.

“Hehe.”

Wang Xian smiled and shook his head slowly. “I have already bought it.”

“Hehe, I can bring you into the cave to cultivate. Give me this water lotus!”

The woman chuckled and ignored Wang Xian. She looked at the elder beside her.

“Cultivate in the demoness cave!”

The old man’s expression changed. He looked at Wang Xian and gritted his teeth. “This… Venerable one, I’m not selling the water lotus anymore!”

“It’s a deal.”

Wang Xian looked at him. He had already kept the divine fruits that he had given to the other party.

Now, he still wanted to go back on his word?

Sorry, it’s a deal!

He wouldn’t agree to it!

When the old man heard his words, his eyes flickered.

“Deal? Hehe, this venerable one, do you think this water lotus should be sold to him or me?”

The woman smiled and asked the old man.

“Naturally, it should be sold to you, female venerable one!”

When the old man heard her words, his eyes flickered and he took two steps back.

“Very good. Therefore, the Water Lotus is mine!”

The woman waved the sharp sword in her hand and said to Wang Xian without a doubt.

“How dare you be so arrogant here?

Wang Xian shook his head.

In the next moment, his figure disappeared instantly.

“PFFT! PFFT! PFFT!”

Sounds of penetration rang out. When he reappeared, he was already at the side of the water lotus. He stretched out his hand and kept it.

“Bang Bang Bang!”

The woman’s body fell to the side, and that old man also fell to the ground.

There was no life left!

He didn’t even have the chance to scream before he died instantly!

“Oh? Hiss, this is?”

“What speed. He… he actually killed the disciple of the cave master of the Demoness Cave!”

“So Powerful!”

When the two corpses fell, everyone around was shocked and hurriedly took a few steps back.

“How dare you kill our senior sister? You’re courting death!”

The man next to the woman reacted. His expression changed drastically as he shouted sternly.

Wang Xian looked at them and frowned slightly.

With a flick of his finger, a surge of terrifying energy instantly entered their bodies.

Boom

A loud explosion sounded from within their bodies. They died immediately!

They were courting death!

This wasn’t a city, nor was it the domain of some races. He could be considered to have seen some rules.

Rules meant that there were no rules.

Just now, the old man and the woman had completely disobeyed the rules, wanting to use their power to suppress him.

But this was simply courting death. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Perhaps that woman was used to being arrogant, or perhaps she had a background.

But what was the use?

There were foolish people everywhere.

“He is a powerful expert, but those three are the cave master of the Banshee Cave. Does he not want to live here anymore?”

“Ha, that woman is a fool. She offhandedly offended someone. She deserves it!”

Some of the surrounding people saw this scene and said softly.

“Boom!”

At this moment, a terrifying energy covered the sky and covered the earth.

Everyone’s expression changed drastically and they immediately flew into the distance.

“Who is courting death? How dare you kill my disciple!”

A woman with four arms flew out from a flower petal cave on the Lotus Mountain.

Her face was filled with a strong murderous aura.

Her gaze locked onto Wang Xian. Without any hesitation, she attacked him with her sword aura.

Wang Xian squinted his eyes slightly. The incipient Saint Wings appeared behind his back instantly and his figure disappeared.

“Crash!”

The next moment, he arrived at the side of the Banshee. His arm transformed into a dragon claw and attacked the banshee directly.

“What? What a fast speed!”

The Banshee’s expression changed drastically when she sensed Wang Xian’s speed. The four sharp swords in her hands immediately blocked the attack.

“Boom!”

The powerful force immediately sent her flying backward.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

“Large-scale battles are prohibited in the river of eternity. No one is allowed to violate the rules. Cave master, if you are going to fight, go to the sky!”

Just as Wang Xian was about to continue his attack, waves of power came from the lotus flower caves.

A cold voice entered their ears.

“I know.”

The cave master wiped the blood from the corner of her mouth and stared at Wang Xian with a fearful expression.

Wang Xian swept his gaze across the flower petal caves below and did not continue his attack.

He could sense waves of powerful threats from these caves.

All of them were at the level of the Masters of the universe.

“Little brother, I can sense the aura of a divine dragon from you. Are you a newly advanced powerhouse from my ancestral dragon lineage?”

At this moment, a dignified middle-aged man walked out from the cave entrance and asked Wang Xian.

“HMM?”

Wang Xian looked at the middle-aged man with a twinkle in his eyes.

The other party was a divine dragon!
