“Haha, Cowards, you only know how to launch sneak attacks. If you have the guts, fight head-on with our Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal Sect!”

“We’re out, we’re out of the city. Dragon Gate’s trash, where are you? You only know how to launch sneak attacks. If we dare to kill you openly, you only know how to hide!”

After a young man finished speaking, a few young men around shouted loudly.

There were also a few youths who took out their phones with smiles on their faces and posted mocking posts on the jianghu.

“Dragon Gate Cowards, this young man has already left the city gates. Come and kill us, Haha, Cowards, all you know how to do is Sneak Attack!”

One by one, similar posts were posted on the Jianghu website.

The mocking voices continued without end.

When the disciples of the immortal sect who had just woken up saw how lively the jianghu website was, they were also slightly stunned.

“The Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect has started to provoke the dragon sect. They may have set up an inescapable net in the surroundings to wait for the Dragon sect to attack again, and then set up an ambush!”

“The Dragon sect doesn’t dare to come out anymore. It looks like the dragon sect is really weaker than the two great immortal sects in terms of strength!”

“The Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect has provoked the dragon sect so much. This time, the Dragon sect is a little embarrassed!”

“In terms of momentum, the dragon sect has been completely suppressed!”

“Haha, I Want to go to the scene to take a look!”

A group of immortal sect disciples looked at the information on the page. Some of the immortal sect disciples even expressed that they wanted to go to the scene to take a look.

Although the Dragon Gate experts killed the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect disciples yesterday, this was, after all, a trivial matter to them.

However, the Dragon Gate had lost six forging workshops and eighteen infant realm experts. The Dragon Gate’s losses were much greater than the two immortal sects.

Today, the two immortal sects had provoked them once again. It was obvious that the Dragon Gate was at a disadvantage.

“Dragon Gate Brat, hurry up and kill your grandfather!”

Another voice resonated in a radius of more than ten kilometers. More than a hundred disciples of the two immortal sects roared mockingly.

“Dragon King, should we give them a surprise?”

Mo Qinglong looked at Wang Xian, who was sitting on a chair and playing with his phone.

“There’s no rush. We’ll wait!”

He looked at the posts on the Jianghu website and said with a smile.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

...

“Elder, the people from the Dragon Gate haven’t appeared yet. Will they be too timid to come out?”

In the holy city, a disciple said to the elder beside him with a smile.

“There’s no rush. If he dares to come today, we’ll kill him once and for all. If he doesn’t come, it’s within our expectations. We can continue to set up our plans. We have time to play with them!”

An old man stroked his beard and said with a smile.

There was no rush. Neither Wang Xian nor the Holy Medicine Immortal sect was in a rush.

“Eh? As expected, the disciples of the Holy Medicine Immortal sect are mocking the dragon sect outside the city. The Dragon sect doesn’t dare to make a move like yesterday!”

“It seems that the Dragon Palace is bluffing. There are many immortals in the dragon sect, but they are still far from the two great immortal sects!”

When it was almost noon, some other disciples of the immortal sects who came to watch the show rushed over and discussed with smiles on their faces.

“It seems that there won’t be a fight today. The Dragon Gate can only cower. It Can’t be helped. The difference is too big. Although it’s very embarrassing, at least we won’t Lose Our Lives!”

“Let’s stay here for a few days and watch the Show!”

“But we have to be careful in a few days. If we’re not careful, we’ll be affected by the battle between the infant realm experts!”

One after another, several hundred people came to watch the show on the road outside the sacred city. They stood at the road in front and watched with a smile.

“Hey, brothers in front, did you see those cowards from the Dragon Gate? If you see them, tell them that their young masters are here. Don’t let them cower like cowards!”

“That’s right. F * ck, if the Dragon Gate had a base, our experts from the Holy Medicine Immortal sect would have blocked the entrance of their base long ago. If they dare to sneak attack us, they are courting death!”

Suddenly, a thousand meters ahead, the disciples of the Holy Medicine Immortal sect greeted a group of people who were watching the show.

This made the group of people who were watching the show slightly stunned. Then, they shook their heads with a smile.

The difference in strength was obvious!

The difference in strength between the Dragon Gate and the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal sect was simply too great.

Perhaps it was as they said, if the Dragon Gate had a base, the powerhouses of the two immortal sects would have already gone to block the gate.

“Excuse me!”

At this moment, a cold voice came from behind them.

When the crowd heard this voice, they felt their breathing become sluggish, and they hurriedly turned their heads.

“This...”

When they turned their heads to look, their faces revealed a stunned expression.

A group of more than 30 people were dressed in black, and there was a ferocious devil dragon embroidered on their chests.

“It’s... Dragon... Gate!”

When the crowd of immortal sect disciples saw the group of more than 30 people, their faces were filled with shock as they stammered, and their bodies hurriedly moved to the side.

A faint smile appeared on Mo Qinglong’s face as he slowly walked forward.

“Eh?”

“Who is that?”

However, at this moment, the 100 or so young men from the two immortal sects saw the group of Drakonids who suddenly appeared and strolled towards them. Their faces were filled with astonishment.

“They’re here, they really dare to come!”

The 100 or so disciples from the two immortal sects were stunned, and then a trace of a smile appeared on their faces.

They looked around and found that there were only more than thirty members of the Dragon Gate, and the smile on their faces became even wider.

“I don’t know whether they are stupid or idiots, Hahaha!”

A young man said with a mocking smile.

“Children of the Dragon Gate, I didn’t expect you to really dare to come. I thought you would be cowards. Not Bad, you are men!”

“Haha, Do You Dare to come and kill us? Come on, come on, Haha!”

Wild laughter came from their mouths. They raised their heads and looked down at Azure Demon Dragon and the others.

So what if they were infant realm experts? They still dared to curse!

“Hehe!”

Azure Demon Dragon saw that they were fearless and revealed a faint smile on his face.

They slowly walked towards the group of young men.

“Activate the formation!”

The youth saw that the distance between them was less than 1,000 meters and immediately said.

“Weng!” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

The formation was activated and a green protective barrier surrounded them. This made them feel at ease. Their gazes swept towards the surrounding areas, and their eyes were filled with smiles.

“A bunch of fellows who are seeking death. In a while, we’ll be here to enjoy their deaths!”

A young man laughed lightly and said in a low voice.

“They’re here. I didn’t expect that they would actually come looking for death. Then, we’ll treat you well!”

“I really didn’t expect that there would actually be such a stupid person in this world!”

“Be careful, be careful of any traps!”

“Haha, What’s there to be afraid of? There are 50 infant realm experts lying in ambush around us. Including us, there are a total of 90. Moreover, the Lord Immortal God is also paying attention to this matter. Be prepared!”

Within the sacred city, the elders revealed a trace of excitement on their faces as they said with a loud laugh.

“Since you all are courting death, then we will fulfill your wish!”

Mo Qinglong and the others came to the front of over a hundred disciples of the two great immortal sects. Their gazes were filled with ridicule as they raised their palms and prepared to attack.

“HMPH, you all are courting death!”

“Elders!”

When they saw Mo Qinglong’s attack coming, they hurriedly shouted towards their surroundings.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

As the roar sounded, the figures on both sides flew towards the road.

However, the flying posture of these figures was a little strange. They didn’t have the slightest bit of vitality!
