Chapter 1167: Kingdom 1168 lowered its head

Translator: 5496903

“The sacred killing token has arrived!”

The voice covered the entire bright moon city, and everyone could hear it clearly.

The cold voice revealed a murderous aura, causing everyone in bright moon city to hurriedly look over.

“Hiss, this is... Star Moon Kingdom’s void interpretation experts have arrived!”

“How terrifying! Four void interpretation experts have actually arrived!”

“The sacred killing token. This is the star-moon kingdom’s sacred killing token. Once the sacred killing token is released, it represents the star-moon kingdom’s sacred killing token!”

Everyone’s gazes turned over. Those figures that carried boundless might surged with reverence in their hearts.

“Including City Lord Liu and the Bright Moon Army general, there are a total of six insightful void realm experts. Six! This is a rhythm that will not rest until the dragon Spike is dead!”

Everyone muttered to themselves. When they saw that majestic figure flying over, their knees were slightly bent. The Aura was too strong.

“Holy Killing Order!”

“The Dragon Assassin organization receives the order. The holy killing order arrives. The Dragon Assassin Organization, Kill!”

The old man in the middle held a yellow imperial edict. With a wave of his arm, he threw it directly into the sky above Bright Moon City.

The imperial edict suddenly became larger. On the golden background, there were large blood-red words that revealed endless killing intent.

“Hiss, what a terrifying killing intent!”

“Is this the strength of the star-moon King? Even if it’s just a single word, it already possesses such a terrifying aura!”

All the citizens of Bright Moon City raised their heads and looked over. The words that were several hundred meters in size emitted a powerful pressure.

The might of the imperial edict was so terrifying.

Looking at the words, everyone couldn’t help but lower their heads, not daring to look at it for a long time!

“HMPH!”

The old man snorted coldly, his eyes revealing endless killing intent.

“Welcome, Lord Ling, Lord Xing, Lord Gu, Lord Shao Wei!”

Within the city Lord’s Manor, City Lord Liu and the Bright Moon Army general hurriedly flew out. When they saw the sacred killing token, they were slightly shocked as they called out respectfully.

“En!”

The four of them nodded and immediately flew towards the city Lord’s manor.

“Huala!”

“The royal family of star-moon kingdom has sent someone over. Next, it will be the battle between the Royal Family and the Dragon Spike!”

“I wonder what the outcome will be. The strength of these four experts is so terrifying!”

“The Holy Killing Order has been issued. Six insightful void realm experts are dealing with the dragon spike. This time, the dragon spike can’t continue to overturn the rivers and overturn the seas, right?”

There was an uproar within Bright Moon City.

This was the first time many people had seen so many terrifying experts.

Everyone waited quietly, waiting for what would happen next.

“Are they here?”

Standing in the restaurant and watching the four insightful void realm experts enter the city Lord’s mansion, Wang Xian’s face revealed a hint of coldness.

“The Holy Kill Order is for the dragon assassin organization to receive the imperial edict. What a joke!”

Wang Xian smiled coldly. He took out the communication stone plate and sent two words.

Action!

When Wang Xian sent out these two words, the eyes of the group of demons in the cities and towns of star-moon kingdom froze slightly!

Murderous intent was condensed!

Star-moon kingdom had 80 towns and 10 cities. Each town was similar to holy sea town.

In comparison, holy sea town was considered a relatively large town because it was close to the ocean. The former mayor, Jin Qianyuan, was an expert at level nine of the supernatural realm.

As for the rest of the towns, a large portion of the mayor’s strength was only at level 8 supernatural realm. Of course, there were also quite a number of level 9 supernatural realm experts.

At this moment, in 20 of the towns in star-moon kingdom, many strange demons had arrived.

One level 7 supernatural realm strange demon led four level 6 supernatural realm strange demons.

They were able to assassinate level 9 and level 8 supernatural realm experts.

A total of 100 strange demons were separated into 20 towns.

When they received Wang Xian’s message, they immediately took action.

The mayor of a town had the strength of a level 9 extraordinaire. When faced with a group of dragon spikes, he was like a bunch of lambs waiting to be slaughtered.

They didn’t have the ability to resist at all.

100 strange demons easily entered the mayor’s residence one by one to carry out the assassination.

It was clean and without any surprises.

Following that, the group of strange demons directly threw the mayor’s body into the entrance of the mayor’s residence.

Beside them, there was a red congratulatory Death Note and a line of words.

“Reporting to Dragon King, it has been resolved!”

“Reporting to Dragon King, it has been resolved!”

...

When Wang Xian’s message was sent less than ten minutes later, one message after another was sent.

A total of twenty messages came from the twenty towns of star-moon kingdom!

“Very good. Next, we’ll have to see the reaction of star-moon kingdom. If you don’t surrender, let’s continue!”

Wang Xian mumbled.

At this moment, the twenty towns were in a state of chaos.

The mayor was killed, and he was thrown directly at the entrance of the Mayor’s residence. Beside them, there was a red congratulatory Death Note.

Beside the red note, there was a line of words.

Tell your king that it was us, the dragon, who assassinated him. If you want to continue, then we will continue as well!

This line of extremely arrogant words stunned everyone in the town.

The other officials hurriedly reported back to the city with terrified expressions.

The death of the mayor of a town was a very big matter for a town.

...

“Lord Ling, this dragon Spike is incomparably arrogant. Before your arrival, it had assassinated over a hundred people during the day. The third prince was also killed by this group of Damnable Fellows!” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Within the city lord’s residence, City Lord Liu respectfully spoke to the old man seated in the middle.

The old man, Ling Kai Tian, was the most powerful existence in star-moon kingdom apart from the king.

One could imagine the fury of the star-moon king by sending him here this time.

“Humph, this dragon Spike won’t be arrogant for many more days. Even if we have to search them one by one, we must capture this group of evildoers and execute them by cutting them into pieces!”

Ling Kaitian snorted coldly, his expression incomparably cold.

“Lord Ling, it’s US who have failed to protect the third Prince’s safety. We are guilty!”

City Lord Liu and the Bright Moon Army general stood up and apologized when they saw the old man’s cold expression.

“After we destroy the dragon Spike, go and personally apologize to the King!”

Ling Kaitian glanced at the two of them and slightly narrowed his eyes. “We’ll start planning the operation to deal with the dragon Spike now. I want to destroy them all within a day!”

“With the four lords here, we’ll definitely be able to destroy the dragon spike assassin organization. We’ll let them know the consequences of daring to oppose us!”

City Lord Liu hurriedly said.

There was also a huge gap between the insightful emptiness realm experts. As the second strongest expert in star-moon kingdom, Ling Kaitian was able to instantly kill him.

Even though he was a city lord and an insightful emptiness realm expert, he still had to lower his stance in front of this person, even to the point of being respectful.

“Buzz Buzz!”

“Buzz Buzz!”

However, just as he finished speaking, the communication stone plate on the table started ringing.

At first, he didn’t care, but the communication stone plate kept ringing, which made him slightly surprised.

Generally speaking, no one dared to send him messages continuously, unless it was an emergency.

City Lord Liu moved his arm, and the communication stone plate flew into his hand.

However, when he saw the message on it, his pupils constricted slightly, and his face stiffened!
