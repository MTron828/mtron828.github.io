Translator: 549690339

“Swoosh!”

Lan Qingyue flew out of the Dragon Palace and stared at the Emperor of Phoenix coldly!

“Dragon Palace, I want you to die!”

The Emperor of Phoenix stared at the Dragon Palace, his eyes full of hatred and anger!

“Humph, a stray dog dares to invade our Dragon Palace!”

Lan qingyue stared at the Emperor of Phoenix coldly.

She slowly raised her arm and threw a punch towards the void.

“Kun, fist!”

As she threw out her fist, an incomparably huge Kun phantom appeared in front of her and directly attacked the Emperor of Phoenix!

“Oh? What?”

“The Dragon Palace has produced another Heavenly Yuan creation realm expert?”

The Emperor of Phoenix watched as the incomparably huge Kun phantom attacked him.

Feeling the terrifying energy on it, his expression changed drastically!

He roared in disbelief!

“Choo-choo!”

The Emperor of Phoenix raised his head and spat out Phoenix Flames from his mouth, burning towards the humongous Kun Phantom!

“Emperor of Phoenix!”

At this moment, Wang Xian, who was in the sky and was about to attack the two void towers, saw the sudden appearance of the Emperor of Phoenix. His expression turned cold!

This emperor of Phoenix was actually connected to the Void Universe!

In the next moment, Wang Xian gave up on attacking the two void pagodas. He moved his body and disappeared!

Teleportation!

His pair of dragon eyes contained endless pressure as he charged towards the Emperor of Phoenix!

“Damn it, that Dragon King has locked onto me!”

When the Emperor of Phoenix saw that Wang Xian had given up on the two void pagodas and locked onto him, his expression changed slightly!

“HMM? Space Power, attack, interfere with this Dragon King!”

In the Void Tower, Duke Xining and the rest saw Wang Xian suddenly attacking downwards.

They had also sensed the emperor of Phoenix. Both of them focused their eyes and were prepared to attack Wang Xian at the same time!

Although they were only using each other to their advantage,.

At this moment, they did not want to see the Emperor of Phoenix being killed.

With the Emperor of the Phoenix around, they could pin down the Dragon King better.

Furthermore, they also realized that besides the unicorn ox, there was another strong cultivator in the heaven’s origin realm in the Dragon Palace.

This was beyond their expectations!

Now, this unexpected strong cultivator needed the emperor of the Phoenix to pin down!

On the Void Pagoda, the space energy condensed into a spatial cannonball and shot directly at Wang Xian!

Wang Xian sensed this energy and his body trembled.

The body of the void divine dragon carried the Taiji dragon disc, the five elements grinding mill, and the power of the ancestral tree, forming a powerful defense.

An umbrella-shaped energy defense shield appeared in front of Wang Xian.

At the same time, after Wang Xian teleported, his main body erupted with all the energy in an instant.

The energy in Wang Xian’s main body was at the level of Great Dao without the aid of any treasures.

As for the Emperor of the Phoenix, he was only at the beginner level!

The difference was huge!

Boom

Wang Xian rushed to the front of the Emperor of the Phoenix in an instant!

“What? This is impossible!”

When the Emperor of the Phoenix saw the two powerhouses in the void space helping him to pin down the Dragon King, he was secretly delighted.

When he suddenly saw Dragon King rushing in front of him, his expression changed drastically!

How was this possible?

How could he still have the power to kill him when he was defending against two control-level void space universe great beings.

“I don’t believe it. Most of his power has been used to defend against the attacks of the Void Space universe great beings. I don’t believe that his power can defeat me!”

The emperor of Phoenix gritted his teeth and the flames on his body rose abruptly.

Endless Flames were burning around him, forming a terrifying defense!

Boom

However, in the next second, Wang Xian’s dragon claws clawed into the flames.

He grabbed his body directly.

The Emperor of Phoenix had no ability to resist at all!

“No, no, no!”

“This is impossible!”

The emperor of the Phoenix’s terrifying and unbelievable voice rang out!

This was impossible!

How was this possible?

How could he be suppressed by the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace in an instant.

One had to know that a large portion of the Dragon King’s strength was still resisting the attacks of the Void Universe Masters!

How could he still have such terrifying strength!

“Clown, Die!”

Wang Xian’s face was filled with coldness and coldness. He squeezed with his Dragon Claw!

Death descended on the body of the Emperor of Phoenix!

“Bang!”

The flames around him were extinguished instantly. His life force vanished instantly!

Wang Xian waved his dragon claw and the corpse of the Emperor of Phoenix landed heavily in front of the Dragon Palace!

“Hiss!”

In the Dragon Palace, the powerful disciples of the Dragon Palace were filled with shock when they saw this scene.

They hadn’t seen the Dragon King make a move for a long time!

The last time he killed the emperor of the Phoenix, it wasn’t as easy as this time.

Instant Kill!

Instant Kill!

And it was when he was blocking the two experts of the Void Universe!

“Our Dragon King is too strong, he’s Invincible!”

“The Blue Dragon Queen can also unleash the power of a Heavenly Yuan creation realm expert. Our Dragon Palace is getting stronger and stronger!”

“The Dragon King is invincible!”

The powerful disciples of the Dragon Palace said excitedly!

“What?”

In the sky, the two Heaven’s origin creator powerhouses of the Void universe were shocked when they saw the emperor of Phoenix being instantly killed by Wang Xian.

Just now, the Emperor of Phoenix was still killed by the Dragon King even when they launched an attack?

According to their understanding, the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace should not have such powerful strength!

“Since you dare to step into the nine-origin universe, today will be the day you die!”

After killing the Emperor of Phoenix, Wang Xian’s body moved and instantly locked onto one of the Void Pagoda.

The body of the Void Divine Dragon carried the Tai Chi Dragon Disc, the great mill of the five elements, and the unicorn ox as it attacked the other Void Pagoda!

The strength of the Void Divine Dragon, the Tai Chi Dragon Disc, and the five elements millstone were already stronger than the ordinary control level.

Together with the LINNIU, it was already comparable to two control level existences.

It was easy to deal with a void pagoda!

As for Wang Xian, there was no need to mention him!

“Roar!”

Wang Xian flew toward a void pagoda and swept his dragon tail across!

“This is bad. The strength of the Dragon Palace is much stronger than we expected.”

Duke Xining and the rest felt the energy from the Dragon King’s attack and their expressions changed slightly!

“Dodge!”

The other Duke of the Void Universe’s expression changed slightly and he immediately roared loudly!

Buzz Buzz

The two void towers trembled slightly and immediately teleported far away to dodge!

“Too slow!”

Wang Xian locked onto Lord Xining’s void tower. His eyes were filled with killing intent.

Spatial-type powerhouses did have a huge advantage in terms of speed.

However, this was also seen in terms of the same level.

As for Wang Xian, he was at the Great Dao level and Lord Xining was at the control level!

The gap between the two was huge!

When Lord Xining’s void tower teleported to another location, Wang Xian had already rushed over.

The dragon’s tail swept directly toward the Void Pagoda!
