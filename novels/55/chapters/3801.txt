3802 Congratulations from the experts of the 3801 peak races!

“CHIRP CHIRP CHIRP!”

The mournful cries of the Phoenixes continued to ring out as the two experts of the Phoenix race who had forcefully upgraded fled in fear.

But behind them, the small house and Little White were too fast!

At Little Blue’s side, the experts of the angel race who had lost their fighting spirit were swallowed into their stomachs.

The group of angels was dealt with by Xiao Lan and flew over again.

Lan qingyue stared at the powerhouses of the Phoenix race. The terrifying aura from her body caused the remaining fire phoenixes to tremble violently.

Wang Xian looked at this scene and a hint of coldness appeared on his face. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

He waved his arm and a chain appeared in his hand. The chain instantly coiled towards the Green River Water Phoenix.

“Dragon King of the Dragon Palace, don’t you dare to humiliate me!”

The Green River Water Phoenix shouted at Wang Xian with a cold expression. The fire of life around her body was burning intensely.

Even if she had to die, she didn’t want to be humiliated. She didn’t want to become like the third prince.

Hualala

However, when the chain wrapped around his body, a strange black hole instantly appeared around her. Her body couldn’t move at all!

“What!”

“No, no, no, no!”

The Green River Water Phoenix felt that her body was completely confined. Her face was filled with horror.

Crash

The chains wrapped around his body and drilled into her body.

The chains penetrated her body completely, causing her energy to be unable to circulate.

Wang Xian pulled with his arm and the Green River Water Phoenix’s body flew towards him.

The five elements under her body became bigger. The huge body of the Green River Water Phoenix fell there.

Her body trembled violently.

She wanted to raise her head, but she couldn’t.

The confinement of the energy made her unable to move!

However, she could see a pair of eyes. She could see a pair of dull eyes.

Those were the eyes of the third prince.

Their eyes met. No one had expected such a situation.

No one had expected that they would end up like this.

They were trampled under the Dragon King’s feet and couldn’t move.

Their eyes were filled with despair!

“I have no enmity with your Phoenix clan and the Angel clan, but since you want to kill me, let’s be enemies. I know that you might not die this time, but that’s even better. I will let you see that I will slaughter more powerhouses of your Angel clan and Phoenix Clan.”

Wang Xian said coldly. His face was filled with mockery and disdain.

His words once again caused the Green River Phoenix and Dragon King to tremble.

If that was the case, they would become sinners of the Angel clan and Phoenix clan.

In the surrounding area, following Xiao Lan’s arrival, the powerhouses of the Phoenix clan were slaughtered one by one.

The entire sky fell silent.

“They’re all dead. The Angel clan and the Phoenix clan, with the exception of the third prince and the Green River Water Phoenix, are all dead!”

“They’re too powerful. The Dragon King and the others are too terrifying. After this, the Angel clan and the Phoenix clan will be in Big Trouble!”

“It’s not just big trouble. If what the Dragon King said is true and they want to expel the Angel clan and the Phoenix clan from the universe, who knows how much they’ll lose!”

“The Dragon Palace has really risen this time. As long as the Dragon King and the others have been hiding here in the starry universe, the Angel clan and the Phoenix clan have been helpless. After billions of years, the Dragon King’s strength and the Dragon Palace’s strength will not be afraid of the two peak races at all.”

In the surrounding area, all the powerful disciples looked shocked when they saw the experts of the two peak races being killed.

They mumbled in shock.

The Dragon Palace had truly risen!

“Congratulations Dragon King, for killing your enemy!”

At this moment, a great elf who was at level seven suddenly congratulated Wang Xian.

“Thank you!”

When Wang Xian heard the congratulations from the ELF race, he looked over with a smile.

“The blue and Green Moon Dragon Queen’s strength is really terrifying. If I’m not wrong, Dragon Queen, Your Kun is not suppressed by the starry universe. Currently, your realm is only at level five.”

The Great Elf continued to laugh.

“Yes, Little Blue and the others have not been suppressed by the starry cosmos. That’s because they are creatures of the starry cosmos. Just like those space beasts in the mountains and seas, they will also be able to get rid of the suppression of the Starry Cosmos in the future. This is their home.”

Blue Moon replied with a smile.

The Dragon Palace had a good relationship with the Elf clan, so blue moon naturally knew about it.

“That’s good. They still have a lot of room for improvement in the future.”

The Great Elf nodded, and his eyes flickered slightly.

Because there was no suppression from the starry universe, Kun, who was a ruler of level five, was able to fight against their masters of level eight.

What if he was promoted to a ruler of level six? What if he was a ruler of level seven?

Then wouldn’t he be able to sweep across the entire nine-origin universe here in the starry universe?

In addition, Kun originally belonged to this universe, so the other space beasts in the starry universe would naturally not sense the invasion of powerful enemies.

Therefore, in the starry universe, the Dragon Palace would have a huge advantage.

“This… If this is the case, wouldn’t the Dragon Palace be invincible in the Starry Universe?”

“Damn, so that’s how it is. I was still wondering why the ruler of the Dragon Palace, a level 8 expert, could move around in the starry universe. So that’s how it is. In the starry universe in the future, the Dragon Palace’s strength will be invincible!”

“If that’s the case, the Dragon Palace will definitely be able to get a lot of resources from the universe. The rise of the Dragon Palace is inevitable!”

Hearing Lan Qingyue’s words, the experts of the peak races around were moved.

The Dragon Palace would have a huge advantage in the universe.

They wouldn’t be a match for the Dragon Palace.

If the three Kun beasts were to improve a little, they would be invincible.

Naturally, their words were transmitted to the third prince and the Green River Water Phoenix.

Their already desperate expressions became even more desperate at this moment!

They lay there motionlessly, their faces ashen!

“Congratulations on the rise of the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace. Congratulations!”

“Congratulations on the rise of the Dragon Palace. Congratulations!”

At this moment, a skeleton expert who was at the seventh level of the skeleton clan cupped his hands at Wang Xian.

This was a form of goodwill and recognition.

First, it was the Elf clan, then the skeleton clan. The surrounding disciples of the high-level races were stunned.

Even the peak races had such recognition for the Dragon Palace?

“Congratulations to the Divine Dragon Clan!”

“Congratulations to the Divine Dragon Clan!”

The experts of the Divine Tiger clan and the Saint clan also gave their blessings.

“Congratulations to the Divine Dragon Clan!”

“Congratulations to the Divine Dragon Clan!”

Soon after, the experts of the other peak-level clans started to congratulate them.

It didn’t matter what they said.

They do not say to make friends, but a kind of goodwill, a recognition.
