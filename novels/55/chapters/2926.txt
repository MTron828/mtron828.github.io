Chapter 2927: War Machine Imperial Region 2

The creator was at least three to four meters tall when he stood up.

His entire body was emitting golden rays of light. There were gemstones embedded in his chest that contained boundless energy.

On both of his arms, he wore Golden Gloves. On the gloves, there were also many resplendent gemstones.

His cold eyes were filled with killing intent as he stared at Wang Xian.

“Hehe, so what if I’m involved?”

Wang Xian stared at the creator and asked faintly.

“Then you will pay for everything that happened today!”

The Creator’s mechanical voice was filled with coldness.

“Creator, if it weren’t for the threat from the Chimei territory, would you dare to be so arrogant here?”

The governor turned around and stared at the creator as he said with a face full of killing intent.

“Sooner or later, your glazed domain will be incorporated into my territory. All humans will become a member of my biochemical army!”

The creator stared at the domain Lord and replied coldly.

“I have to say, creator, you are really arrogant. How dare you speak so arrogantly in front of the Dragon Palace and the glazed domain!”

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly and said to him.

“Because my subordinates are not afraid of Death!”

The creator replied faintly.

The robots were not afraid of death. They would obey his orders 100% .

Now that the glazed domain was under threat from the Chimei territory, it was impossible for them to join forces with the Dragon Palace to attack the Machine Empire at this time.

Even if the glazed domain and the Dragon Palace could defeat them together, this battle would take at least a few months or even longer.

The veluriyam domain didn’t dare to fall into their hands for a long time.

Secondly, just as he said, his subordinates weren’t afraid of death, but the Veluriyam Domain and the Dragon Palace were different.

If the two forces attacked them, the creator was confident that the two forces would suffer heavy losses.

After his AI calculated, the probability of the two forces attacking them together was only 3.3% .

“That damned metal lump, he’s really arrogant!”

“There’s no choice, the Machine Emperor region is much more troublesome than the Chimei region. This damned creator has absolute control, and all his subordinates are 100% obedient. They aren’t afraid of death, and as long as they have the resources, they can be quickly created. Robots are deformed, and everything they do is to serve the Creator.”

All the retreating soldiers and disciples of the glazed domain had ugly expressions on their faces when they heard the conversation between the three leaders of the resplendent starry sky.

The Machine Emperor Domain was a tough piece of metal to the glazed domain.

It was not worth it to trade one person’s life for a hundred robots’lives.

Robots could be created at any time, but humans only had one life.

“Oh? is that so? Then let’s see if you guys are afraid of death.”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows slightly when he heard his words.

“Roar!”

The Nine Divine Wind Dragons let out a roar as soon as he finished his sentence.

All the members of the Dragon Palace stared at the direction of the mechanical imperial region and the countless mechanical troops there.

“HMM?”

When the creator who was more than a billion kilometers away heard Wang Xian’s words, he frowned slightly. Information flashed across his eyes as he calculated the meaning of his words.

“All the disciples of the Dragon Palace, Get Ready!”

Prime Minister Gui stood beside Ao tu in the middle of the back and roared loudly.

“Roar!”

“Roar!”

In the next moment, all the devouring dragons, berserk dragons, and Imperial Dragons let out a roar. A strong fighting spirit rushed forward directly.

“This… What is the Dragon Palace trying to do?”

“What’s going on? Are the divine emperors of the glazed domain going to attack the army of the machine imperial territory together with the Dragon Palace?”

“It’s highly possible. After all, the Dragon Palace has sent quite a number of experts this time. Perhaps our domain Lord and the Dragon King have come to an agreement to kill their spirit!”

“It’s really possible. After all, we lost five divine emperors because of those fellows from the Machine Imperial Territory!”

At the back, everyone felt the terrifying might of the Dragon Palace. They were slightly shocked and couldn’t help but speak out.

However, their guesses made some of the high-level soldiers frown slightly.

They hadn’t received any notice of such a matter. If they wanted to kill the spirit of the machine royal territory, they should take action as well.

“Attack!”

“Kill!”

Without allowing anyone to think further, Wang Xian stood on the Dragon Throne and gave the order to attack.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

The next moment, he was the first to bear the brunt of the attack. Led by the godly monarchs of the Dragon Palace, 1.5 million godly monarchs of the Dragon Palace charged directly at the Machine Army of the machine royal territory.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

The nine godly dragons also let out a roar and flew directly to the two wings of the army of the Dragon Palace.

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly and followed closely behind the Dragon Palace Army.

“What? The Dragon Palace is attacking them directly!”

“Our governor and the others are not following them!” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

All the soldiers of the glazed domain were shocked when they saw the Dragon Palace and the others attacking the machine royal territory. When they saw that the divine emperor did not make a move, they were shocked.

“Could it be that the Dragon Palace is going to fight the machine royal territory alone?”

All the soldiers were shocked.

“Dragon Palace, how Dare You Challenge The Machine Royal Territory? All the machine armies, Attack!”

The creator was calculating all kinds of possibilities in his mind, but he couldn’t figure out why the Dragon Palace would attack them.

However, he stopped calculating and gave the order to attack angrily.

Crack! Crack! Crack

In the next moment, the sound of machinery turning could be heard and countless holes were opened.

Boom! Boom! Boom

Boom! Boom! Boom

The entire process took less than a second. In the next moment, the millions of battleships around them released terrifying attacks.

Countless flame bombs, storm bombs, and lightning pillars lit up the entire starry sky and attacked all the members of the Dragon Palace.

“Humph!”

The creator snorted and hit a button in front of him.

The warship that was tens of millions of kilometers below him let out a roar.

A black hole-like attack shot toward the Dragon Palace.

“All members of the Dragon Palace, Attack!”

“The imperial dragon seed is in front to defend!”

Prime Minister Gui ordered loudly.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

In the next moment, the arrows of the arrow dragon seed, the blood-red energy of the berserk dragon seed, and the black and yellow flames of the devouring dragon seed met the countless artillery fire.

The sky array was in the center. It stared at the terrifying black hole in front of it and quickly set up a formation to meet the black hole.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

Then, when the attacks of the mechanical corps and the experts of the Dragon Palace collided, the entire void seemed to tremble.

A catastrophic energy rose from the center of the collision.

The void shattered like a mirror.

The collision was earth-shaking!

“Hiss! The first round of attacks collided. The world seems to be shaking. The war between them has begun!”

“What is this situation? Is this a probing attack or something?”

All the soldiers of the glazed domain were filled with shock. The war had just broken out like this?

However, the main character was not their glazed domain.

They wanted to know now, was this a probing attack?
