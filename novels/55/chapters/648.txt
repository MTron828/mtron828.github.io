Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

[Mysterious Demon: Level 11]

[Extractable Dragon Energy: 553,353]

When the information appeared in Wang Xian’s mind, the figure before his eyes had completely disappeared.

Despite the region before him being part of the Great Waterfall Water Shockwave and a region controlled by Wang Xian’s water energy, he still couldn’t sense the Mysterious Demon at all.

Perfect concealment visually and energy-wise! This Mysterious Demon is truly terrifying and a natural-born assassin!

Wang Xian was a little shocked. It wasnot surprising to him now that such creatures would be able to survive within the territory of that Manta Ray King.

The Mysterious Demon was just like a chameleon. However, it was a lot more incredible than a chameleon!

Sss!

The disappearance of the Mysterious Demons before their eyes made the group of dragonians gasp and stare vigilantly at their surroundings.

Roving Sword was equally shocked. He waved his arm and blinding golden energy shrouded around him for several kilometers.

Under the illumination of his metal attribute energy, several figures appeared in his sight.

These figures were roughly 1.5 meters tall with emaciated bodies and razor-sharp arms.

Weng!

However, the moment these Mysterious Demons noticed they’d been discovered, their bodies shimmered and disappeared from sight a second later.

Dynamic talents!

A flash of light ran across Wang Xian’s eyes. The blue water energy around him flickered and the range of the Great Waterfall Water Shockwave shrank rapidly.

Weng!

At his moment, he felt movement from a direction.

“Water Imprisonment!”

Wang Xian tightened his dragon claws and rods made of water streams formed a solid cage.

Bam!

At this moment, a figure surfaced. Razor-sharp claws extended into the Water Imprisonment. It was clear that a Mysterious Demon was trying to save its companions from the Water Imprisonment!

Wang Xian gripped his dragon claws once again and streams of water trapped the other Mysterious Demon.

Wang Xian could easily crush a Level 11 creature to death.

With two Mysterious Demons trapped within cages, the entire space quietened down. Not a single Mysterious Demon dared to show itself again.

The space of the Great Waterfall Water Shockwave shrank further as Wang Xian observed the region.

“Appear now and surrender. Otherwise, die!” Wang Xian shouted coldly. The water region controlled by him contracted rapidly. In just a dozen seconds, the area had contracted to a radius of a thousand meters.

Huh?

Wang Xian frowned and was clearly becoming impatient.

Whoosh!

The seawater started boiling and terrifying heat emitted from him.

Screech, screech, screech!

In an instant, figures appeared one after another. They had blue skin and relatively long ears.

There was a total of more than a hundred Mysterious Demons who were staring at Wang Xian and the group with deep grudges. White-colored energy emitted from their bodies as they resisted Wang Xian’s boiling water attack.

Hehe!

“Are you guys going to surrender?”

Wang Xian stared at the hundred-odd Mysterious Demons and revealed a faint smile. At the same time, water ropes extended and wrapped around the Mysterious Demons.

“What are you trying to achieve? We have no feud with you!”

The water ropes wrapped around the necks of the Mysterious Demons. When they tried to break free, they were surprised to find out that their attempts were futile.

A relatively larger and bulkier Mysterious Demon stared at Wang Xian and questioned him.

“Surrender to me and my Dragon Palace!” Wang Xian said in a low voice as the water ropes around their necks tightened.

“What benefits would we get for surrendering to you?” that Mysterious Demon asked Wang Xian once again. It looked solemn and had eyes that seemed to be brimming with intelligence.

Wang Xian was pleasantly surprised and answered plainly, “You wouldn’t have to die!”

You wouldn’t have to die! ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

In other words, if they did not surrender, they would die.

The group of Mysterious Demons exchanged glances and some of them were clearly bitter about it.

Wang Xian stared at them curiously. Looking at their expressions, his desire to subdue them grew even stronger.

The intelligence of this group of Mysterious Demons could almost match the Immortal-class Manta Ray King!

However, they were clearly a lot weaker than the Manta Ray King.

Intelligence was an exemplification of the strength of a race. Although this wasn’t the only criteria, creatures with higher intelligence would find it easier to reach a higher level.

Nonetheless, this wasn’t the main reason why Wang Xian had such interest in these Mysterious Demons.

The main reason was for their concealment abilities. Those were simply too insane!

“We are willing to accept your deployment!” the Mysterious Demon replied with a solemn face.

Hehe!

Seeing that they were feeling a little indignant, Wang Xian smiled faintly. Drops of essence blood hovered in the water.

“Absorb it and do not put up any resistance. Otherwise, you will die!”

Wang Xian waved his arm and drops of essence blood flew to them.

A total of a hundred and thirteen Mysterious Demons.

They looked at the essence blood before them before turning their attention to the Mysterious Demon that had spoken to Wang Xian.

That Mysterious Demon shook his head helplessly and absorbed the essence blood.

The surrounding group of Mysterious Demons observed the reactions of that Mysterious Demon silently.

“A race that is filled with intelligence and is peace-loving!”

Wang Xian stared on. That Mysterious Demon that had absorbed the essence blood beamed with excitement.

“Let the other Mysterious Demons absorb the essence blood!”

“Yes, Dragon King!”

That Mysterious Demon bowed respectfully and nodded his head at the surrounding Mysterious Demons.

The surrounding group of Mysterious Demons did not hesitate any further as they absorbed the essence blood.

“Fifteen Budding Realm and the remaining are all Level 11. The Mysterious Demon race is really strong and powerful. Moreover, their talents are really insane!”

Wang Xian’s eyes beamed with excitement.

“Greetings, Dragon King!”

At this moment, the Mysterious Demons that had consumed the essence blood went down on a knee and bowed respectfully to Wang Xian.

“You must be their leader, right? Are the members of the Mysterious Demon clan all here?

Wang Xian waved his hand at the Mysterious Demon that had spoken up previously.

“Yes, Dragon King!”

That Mysterious Demon nodded his head before saying, “All our members are here. This region is our nest!”

Mmm!

Wang Xian looked at the approaching Mysterious Demon and placed his dragon claw on his body.

“Indeed! Just as I expected. A really unique body composition!”

Wang Xian stared at the Mysterious Demon while mumbling to himself.

Unique body constitution and bloodline were both “bug”-like advantages for any cultivators.

Body constitution and bloodline could be differentiated into different tiers. Elite tier body constitution and bloodline could allow a creature to stand at the very peak of the entire universe.

Sun Lingxiu’s holy light constitution, Wang Xian’s divine dragon constitution, the bloodline of the Heavenly Hound and the body constitution of the Mysterious Demon were all unique.

The reason why Wang Xian was certain that the uniqueness of the Mysterious Demons lay in their body constitution and not their bloodline was because of their flesh and skin.

Their flesh and skin possessed a very unique form of energy.

This energy allowed them to conceal their figures.

Natural born killers and terrifying shadowless assassins!

They could blend into any environment within a second. This ability of theirs could no longer be described as concealment.

Assimilation. Perfect assimilation! Even if Wang Xian had released a region controlled by his water energy, they could still assimilate into the region rapidly, making it impossible for Wang Xian to detect their location.

“I wonder what kind of constitution this is...? It’s truly exceptionally powerful for assassination, sneak attacks, and making it hard for others to guard against an attack!”

Wang Xian heaved a sigh emotionally, feeling he had chanced upon a treasure this time.

The value of the Mysterious Demon race could even match the golden swordfish race!
