Chapter 3044: 3043 fishing rod

The fishing rod was very important to anglers.

The extension of energy, the bearing of energy, all depended on the fishing rod.

First of all, the fishing rod had to be completely refined and refined into a part of one’s body.

Only in this way could it be driven like an arm and transmitted energy to the fishing rod to form a fishing line.

It could be said that the fishing rod was equivalent to the angler’s weapon.

Moreover, the fishing rod needed to be refined and strengthened. A powerful fishing rod had a special effect.

Wang Xian took the willow deity’s branch and used his hand to sense it.

With his current combat strength, he couldn’t destroy this branch at all.

The branch had a very strong energy conductivity. Just as the willow deity said, this branch was very suitable to be used as a fishing rod.

“First, I have to refine it. This will take some time.”

Wang Xian mumbled.

If one wanted to do a good job, one must first sharpen the weapon.

From the information, he knew the importance of a fishing rod.

Wang Xian did not hesitate. He immediately started to refine the rod according to the method of refining the fishing rod.

Time passed day by day. Wang Xian was in seclusion in his room.

The spiritual energy in the room was extremely high. Even for a powerhouse at the peak of the Divine Emperor realm, it was a rare paradise.

The news of Wang Xian hanging a signboard in front of the door had also reached the ears of the other disciples of the Willow deity Daoist sect.

The disciples of the various races did not pay too much attention to it.

On the other hand, the group of unaffiliated disciples revealed a faint smile on their faces.

To them, they had one more friend in the same boat.

“Phew, I finally managed to completely refine it. It took me a full two months.”

Wang Xian muttered to himself as a smile appeared on his face.

He looked at the fishing rod in his hand. With a thought, he could directly lengthen it.

According to his guess, the limit of its length was ten million kilometers.

In addition, he could condense the energy to form a fishing line that could cover an area of one billion kilometers.

This area was extremely terrifying.

“Let’s go take a look in the Milky Way.”

Wang Xian stood up and walked out immediately.

“Junior brother Wang Xian, where are you going?”

As he walked out of the room, Du Dalong happened to come out as well. He asked him.

“I’m going fishing to hunt some dire beasts.”

Wang Xian replied.

“Fishing? It’s safer to fish well.”

Du Dalong said with a smile.

“Where are you going, Senior Brother Dalong?” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Wang Xian smiled and asked.

“I’m going to the nearby planets to buy some resources.”

After exchanging a few pleasantries with Du Dalong, Wang Xian flew directly to the market place of the Willow deity Daoist sect.

Sensing the aura of the Mi Xin Lu, he came to the front of a house.

The house was rather beautiful.

“Mi Xin Lu, let’s go. I’ll bring you out of the Milky Way for a stroll.”

Wang Xian stood at the door and transmitted his voice to her.

“Brother Wang, you’re here!”

When Mi Xin Lu heard Wang Xian’s voice, she flew out with a face full of pleasant surprise.

Ever since Wang Xian saved her life last time and brought her here, she was filled with gratitude.

When she heard that he was bringing her out, she flew out excitedly.

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian waved his arm and the five elements Millstone turned into a ten-meter-long millstone. He brought her into the Milky Way.

Soon, they arrived at the surface of the Milky Way. The five elements millstone floated on the surface of the water and flew toward the depths of the Milky Way.

“Brother Wang, where are we going now?”

Mi Xin Lu asked him curiously.

“To go fishing. I might need you to do something later!”

Wang Xian said to her.

“Fishing? Fishing is very interesting!”

Mi Xin Lu said happily.

Standing on the five elements grinding mill, Wang Xian was in a good mood as he was surrounded by a vast ocean.

It had been a long time since he flew in such a vast ocean.

The place where Wang Xian was going to fish was a little far from the willow deity Daoist sect.

As a venerable Daoist Rite Temple, there were no powerful aquatic creatures nearby that dared to approach.

Flying in the Milky Way, he could occasionally see some powerful ships and some powerful underwater artifacts.

He could occasionally see powerful people fishing on the surface of the sea.

Wang Xian kept flying forward.

“Brother Wang, we are already very far in.”

After flying for five hours, Mi Xin Lu looked around and saw that there was no one around. There was an extremely deep ocean below. She was slightly afraid.

Especially when she could sense waves of terrifying auras from time to time.

Some of the auras made her heart palpitate.

“HMM, it’s about time. As expected of the Milky Way. There are so many terrifying aquatic creatures here.”

Wang Xian sighed slightly.

“Water is the source of life. There are usually the most creatures in the ocean.”

The Mi Xin Deer said.

“We will be here. This is our first time fishing. I wonder how many dire beasts we will be able to catch!”

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly. With a wave of his arm, the fishing rod appeared in his hand.

“Next is the bait.”

He mumbled. Fishing required bait. The stronger the bait, the more it would attract the aquatic creatures.

The bait could be the flesh and blood of a powerful dire beast, or it could be a divine herb.

“Dragon Blood should have a strong attraction.”

Wang Xian mumbled. Back in the Abyss, he had used dragon blood to attract the abyssal species.

Dragon blood had a fatal attraction to any dire beast.

With a move of his palm, a large amount of dragon blood flowed out. The dragon blood condensed into the shape of a fish.

“This is?”

At the side, Mi Xin Lu felt the pressure from the dragon blood. Her body trembled slightly.

There was reverence and passion in her eyes.

She swung the fishing rod in her hand and waves of energy condensed into a line. The line coiled around the arowana condensed from Dragon Blood.

Splash

The arowana swayed its body and entered the Milky Way below. It swam towards its surroundings.

Under Wang Xian’s control, the small arowana swam at a very fast speed. Very soon, it had dived to a distance of a few hundred million kilometers under the sea.

Through the arowana below, Wang Xian was able to sense the situation around him.

The aura emitted by the arowana, which was condensed from Dragon Blood, had a fatal attraction to any aquatic creature.

Wang Xian transformed into a stool and sat on it. He closed his eyes and sensed it slightly.

Mi Xin Lu watched curiously from the side.

“It’s Here!”

In less than a minute, Wang Xian sensed that the arowana was being stared at by an aquatic creature.

This aquatic desolate beast was only at level nine of King God realm. When it saw the small fish condensed from Dragon Blood, a greedy look appeared in its eyes. It immediately chased after it.

However, Wang Xian was not interested in such a weak aquatic creature. He made the arowana swim quickly.

“Roar Roar!”

A muffled sound was heard faintly. Wang Xian immediately sensed that a powerful aquatic dire beast was attacking the arowana.

Furthermore, the surrounding atmosphere had changed slightly. Waves of aura were locked onto the arowana.

Wang Xian ignored it and continued to control the arowana to swim within the maximum range that he could control.

He could faintly sense that more and more aquatic dire beasts were locking onto the arowana.

“This method of fishing is even more convenient than entering the sea by myself. Moreover, the danger is extremely low!”

Wang Xian sensed this scene and his eyes revealed a look of excitement.
