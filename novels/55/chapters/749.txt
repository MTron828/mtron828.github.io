The hundred flower liquid was placed on a stone table on the table.

There was a special flower growing on the stone table. The flower was like a palm, holding it on top.

“Everyone, the first drop of hundred flower liquid, everyone can take out their own items to trade. Those who are selected will carry out the trade!”

The hundred flower fairy gently tapped, and a flower on the stone table grew longer and was placed in front of them.

She wore a flower dress, had delicate hands, two beautiful butterflies, and had a delicate face. She was the third most beautiful person in the world, so she definitely deserved her name.

“Two grade-7 radiant wind grass, one stalk!”

“One grade-6 medicinal pill, Ganoderma Orchid Pill!”

“Grade-11 wood attribute scepter!”

“Ten clear blue flower seeds!”

...

Just as the flower fairy sect finished speaking, a group of middle-aged youths took out their items and shouted loudly.

The group of girls beside the Hundred Flowers Immortal sect were looking at the items happily.

The Hundred Flowers Liquid was a special item. It was comparable to a top grade grade grade-6 elixir. However, it was very special. Even for an infant stage powerhouse, it had some use. Therefore, it was very precious.

“A grade-10 wood spirit Pearl!”

The skinny young man beside Wang Xian also shouted loudly.

When he shouted out the wood spirit pearl, the girls’eyes lit up as they looked over. Flower Fairy also looked over. It was a pity that there was a hint of disappointment in her eyes.

The wood spirit pearl was very useful to them, but it was a pity that its level was too low!

“Two level-11 wood-attributed spirit weapons!”

Wang Xian swept his gaze across the items around him and took out two wood-attributed scepters.

Currently, Wang Xian had the most spirit weapons. He also had more than 20 wood-attributed spirit weapons, including five to six grade-12 wood-attributed spirit weapons.

All of these were obtained from killing the disciples of the Holy Medicine Sect of the Holy Doctor sect.

“Eh?” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The crowd was slightly surprised when they saw Wang Xian taking out two grade-11 wood-attributed spirit weapons.

Compared to spirit weapons, elixirs were more precious.

The hundred flower liquid could at most be compared to one grade-11 spiritual artifact. It was a loss for Wang Xian to take out two of them!

“Alright, the first drop of hundred flower liquid will belong to this young master!”

The flower fairy looked at Wang Xian and said with a smile. With a wave of her arm, the hundred flower liquid flew directly towards him!

Wang Xian also threw the spiritual artifact over and caught the hundred flower liquid!

“Brother, you really don’t show your true colors. You’re just a nouveau riche. Exchanging two grade-11 spiritual artifacts for the hundred flower liquid, Tsk Tsk!”

The skinny young man at the side looked at Wang Xian and sighed with envy.

Wang Xian smiled. He opened the jade bottle and sniffed it.

Instantly, a fragrance that made him quiet came from inside. It seemed to have a calming effect on his soul.

Wang Xian moved his arm and placed the crystal box behind him on the stone table in front of him!

After opening it gently for half a meter, Wang Xian poured the hundred flowers liquid into Guan Shuqing’s mouth gently!

“This...”

The skinny young man at the side was stunned when he saw Wang Xian opening the crystal box and seeing Guan Shuqing inside.

He widened his eyes when he saw Wang Xian pouring the hundred flowers liquid into her mouth directly.

“He... he is really someone that I like!”

The skinny young man muttered with a shocked expression.

Pouring the hundred flowers liquid that was exchanged for two grade-11 spirit tools into her mouth directly was extremely extravagant!

Wang Xian stared at Guan Shuqing’s expression. When he saw her flushed face slowly returning to normal and her breathing becoming more stable, a hint of surprise flashed across his eyes.

“It works, it really works!”

He heaved a heavy sigh of relief. As long as it works!

“I’ll take the second bottle of hundred flowers liquid. It’s a level-12 wood attribute spirit weapon. This spirit weapon is not an ordinary spirit weapon but a wooden hairpin. Wearing it on the body of the flower fairy is its best destination!”

At this moment, the second bottle of hundred flower liquid began to be exchanged, and a young man’s voice sounded.

“A level-12 wood attribute spirit tool. My God, Glacier Cloud has invested a lot!”

“Exchanging for a level-12 spirit tool is simply a huge loss. Glacier Cloud’s intentions aren’t in the wine, he’s clearly trying to curry favor with Flower Fairy!”

“TSK TSK, I’ve always heard that glacier cloud likes flower fairy, but now it seems like he lives up to his reputation!”

“A perfect match. Senior Brother Bing is the most outstanding disciple of Our Ice God immortal sect. He is worthy of flower fairy!”

When the surrounding people saw the item that Bingchuan Yun took out, they automatically put away their own items. They did not want to compete for this drop of hundred flower liquid!

When the girl sitting next to Bingchuan Yun saw him looking at her junior sister with admiration, her eyes revealed a look of jealousy and her face was embarrassed.

Seeing that he was holding a grade-12 spiritual artifact, flower fairy frowned slightly and said, “Young Master Bing’s grade-12 spiritual artifact is too valuable. I’ll give you two drops of hundred flower liquid!”

Bingchuan Yun’s expression turned ugly when he saw her giving him two drops. He shook his head slowly and said, “Alright then, we’ll do as fairy says!”

“Wait!”

At this moment, Wang Xian stood up slowly and said, “One grade-12 wood-attribute spiritual artifact and one grade-11 wood-attribute spiritual artifact!”

“What the F * ck? Are you serious?”

“This is crazy. is he going after flower fairy as well?”

“It’s that young man again!”

One level-12 spiritual weapon and one level-11 spiritual weapon in exchange for two drops of hundred flower liquid. This was a huge loss.

No one would make such a stupid deal!

It was no exaggeration to say that these two spiritual weapons could be exchanged for at least six to seven drops!

“Which Immortal sect is he from? If he isn’t from the ice god Immortal sect, he doesn’t seem to be from our true Martial Immortal College!”

“Could it be that some rich second generation from an immortal sect is chasing after fairy flower?”

Some people stared at Wang Xian in bewilderment.

Others did not pay much attention to his purchase of the first drop of hundred flower liquid. However, the price he offered this time was simply too extravagant.

It was even more extravagant than glacier cloud.

Flower Fairy was stunned as well. She looked at Wang Xian with astonishment in her heart.

Could it be that he was really pursuing her?

Otherwise, why would he spend such a huge price to purchase her hundred flower liquid?

Thinking of this, flower fairy couldn’t help but size up Wang Xian.

Based on his looks, he wasn’t any worse than glacier cloud. He had an ordinary aura about him. He wasn’t very attractive, but he was very attractive.

“Young master, are you sure you want to exchange two spirit tools for two drops of hundred flower liquid?”

The flower fairy asked Wang Xian curiously.

She was just curious, but she didn’t have many thoughts.

“That’s right!”

Wang Xian nodded. The hundred flower liquid was very useful to Shu Qing. He didn’t care about one or two spirit tools.

Beside him, Bingchuan Yun frowned as he stared at Wang Xian. He then raised his eyebrows.

“Since this young master wants to exchange two drops of hundred flowers liquid for such a valuable item, I will give it to you. I will also let the flower fairy earn a little more. Hehe, I want the lower ones!”

He said with a smile as though he was thinking of the flower fairy. It was indeed able to give the flower fairy a good impression.

The flower fairy nodded her head slowly. After all, this was a trade and not a direct gift to her. There was no reason for her to reject him.

“Here!”

The flower fairy threw two drops of hundred flower liquid over. Wang Xian also threw the spiritual weapon over.

“Then give me the next two drops of hundred flower liquid, Flower Fairy!”

Bingchuan Yun said with a faint smile on his face.

“Alright!”The flower fairy nodded her head.

“Wait, I want the remaining seven drops of flower liquid. What do you need?”
