Ding! “Do you want to build the sea-pacifying needle? Level one sea-pacifying needle requires one ton of level 13 materials and three tons of level 12 materials!”

After comforting Xiao Yu, Lan Qingyue, and the rest, Wang Xian went to the location of the sea-pacifying needle.

The sea-pacifying needle could be taken away. The main function of the needle was to stabilize the calm within a hundred-kilometer radius of the Dragon Palace. Even if there was a tsunami, it would calm down once it arrived here.

“When I first built the Dragon Palace, I only needed a little bit of materials. It was completely a blessing. Now, I need a lot of materials to build a sea-pacifying needle!”

Wang Xian looked at the huge sea-pacifying needle and looked at the materials in his interspatial ring.

“With all the materials in my interspatial ring and the metal rod in AO Qitian’s hand, I can create a sea-pacifying needle!”

Wang Xian thought to himself. Then, he asked Ao Qitian to bring over his broken metal rod.

This time, he had to be fully prepared when he entered another world.

Ao Qitian’s weapon had to be at least a good one.

Ding! “Do you want to create a sea-pacifying needle?”

When all the materials were ready, the system’s voice sounded.

“Confirmed!”

Boom! Boom! Boom

Beside the first ocean-pacifying needle, another huge ocean-pacifying needle slowly appeared.

The ocean-pacifying needle was five meters thick and two hundred meters tall.

Wang Xian stretched out his hand and held the ocean-pacifying needle. “Shrink!”

Buzz

The ocean-pacifying needle instantly shrunk and turned into a two-meter-long golden cudgel. The words “Ocean-pacifying needle”in gold were very obvious.

“A level-one ocean-pacifying needle is comparable to an immortal-level weapon!”

Wang Xian waved his arm and threw it at Ao Qitian. “This ocean-pacifying needle is a gift for you!”

“Thank you, Dragon King!”

A burning look flashed across ao Qitian’s eyes as he caressed the ocean-pacifying needle with a face full of love.

“Big!”

With a flick of his arm, the ocean-pacifying needle expanded to a size of four meters.

Ao qitian grinned. This kind of weapon that could expand and shrink was the best weapon for him.

He could even make the ocean-pacifying needle grow to a size of 200 meters when he was fighting!

He moved his body excitedly and flew toward the dragon field. He was prepared to wave it around.

“Ao Qitian is the only one in the entire Dragon Palace who has a weapon at the level of an immortal God!”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows. The sword in his hand was still a level-12 spiritual weapon.

He did not know how to forge a level-13 spiritual weapon because it involved a formation. Hence, he had to engrave a formation on the weapon.

Due to the formation, the ocean-pacifying divine needle could become bigger and smaller.

“Currently, the wood dragon bead and the fire dragon bead still require at least a year of nurturing before they can be upgraded to the level of an immortal God!”

“The water dragon bead is only level 12. It’s still a little lacking to upgrade it to level 13. I don’t have the gold dragon bead and the earth dragon bead at the moment!”

Wang Xian looked at his three dragon bead weapons and had a thought.

“After this revival, my dragon energy has increased by more than 10 million. However, I’m still 800 million away from leveling up.”

The next morning, Wang Xian, Ao Qitian, Ao Jian, and the rest of the mysterious clan stood in the air. They stared at the sky with cold expressions.

“Xiao Xian, you have to be careful!”

“Brother, be careful. Don’t let me and my sisters-in-law worry!”

Below, Xiao Yu, Lan Qingyue and the rest raised their heads to look at Wang Xian and instructed him loudly.

“Don’t worry. You guys wait for Me Here!”

Wang Xian nodded at them and took a deep breath. Red and blue light flickered in his eyes.

“The formation is not activated yet. We will definitely be injured after entering. We have to find a place to recover from our injuries first!”

Wang Xian instructed them.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

A group of more than 100 members of the Dragon Palace replied to Wang Xian.

“Alright, let’s Charge in!”

Killing intent flashed in Wang Xian’s eyes. He stared at a spot where the formation was weak. With a wave of his arm, a crack was torn open.

“Go in!”

Ao jian shouted loudly. The strange demons quickly entered the formation. Following AO Jian and AO qitian, they tore through space and entered the formation.

Crack! Crack! Crack

The terrifying attack of the formation instantly arrived. The stronger the person was, the stronger the attack of the formation would be when he entered.

Those at the immortal level could protect those at the infant and Dan Stage from entering, but they could not allow Wang Xian to enter safely.

Hiss

The attack of the formation instantly caused many wounds on their bodies, causing Wang Xian’s expression to change slightly.

In just a split second, another piece of sky appeared in Wang Xian’s sight.

In a sea area, there were numerous islands. There were many strange black birds flying in the sky. The black birds looked like crows!

They had blood-red eyes as they scanned the area below them ferociously.

The buildings on the islands were mainly black. Even the seawater below was a little black, causing the entire sea area to be filled with a gloomy feeling.

It did not look like the Fairyland in the Yongchang World!

Wang Xian and the rest of them moved and went straight to the sea below.

“Ao Yao, lead your clansmen to investigate the surroundings first!”

Wang Xian and Ao Jian sat cross-legged at the bottom of the sea to recover from their injuries. They ordered the strange demon clan to investigate the surroundings.

With the strange demon clan’s terrifying concealment ability, even an immortal God level existence would not be able to detect them if they did not use their full strength.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Ao Yao nodded his head. He waved his hand at the group of people and immediately dispersed to his surroundings.

“Phew!”

Two days later, Wang Xian opened his eyes. Ao Jian and AO qitian, who were at the side, also stood up slowly.

“In these two days, not a single living creature has appeared around us!”

Wang Xian stood up and looked ahead. According to his senses, there were no living creatures.

The entire seabed was like a dead zone, emitting a terrifying atmosphere.

“Dragon King, the demonic middle-aged man who attacked us back then cultivated a strange cultivation technique. It should belong to the demonic path!”

Ao Jian said in a deep voice.

“Yes!”

Wang Xian nodded. “Ao Yao is here!”

“Dragon King!”

At this moment, figures appeared in front of them one by one.

“Have you investigated everything?”

Wang Xian asked.

“I have a rough idea of this world!”

“This world is called the Yu Ding world. There are only two million living people in the entire world. The Jade Hand Immortal sect and corpse Chief Dao are the two immortal sects that rule this world!”

“According to our understanding, in the past, there were three immortal sects in this world with a population of ten million. The other immortal sect was destroyed by the collaboration of the Jade Hand Immortal sect and corpse Chief Dao!”

“Besides the two million living people, there were also nearly ten million dead puppets. The whole world was like a demonic domain
