Chapter 554: My Name Will Start To Spread (3)

“What?”

When Hua Yu heard Wang Xian mumbling, he looked at him in shock.

Thrashing through the entire Immortal Sect?

“Nothing?”

Wang Xian shook his head and added plainly, “Practice diligently!”

Hua Yu’s face was flushed as he stepped aside, feeling embarrassed.

The twenty disciples stared at Wang Xian with complicated feelings.

Swish!

“What’s the matter?”

At this point, a voice sounded suddenly. Mentor Yu appeared in the sky and was looking down at the disciples who had all fallen into the water. She was baffled.

“Nothing, nothing!”Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Yu Ling’er shook her head immediately. There was no way she could tell her mother that Wang Xian had defeated all of them.

That would be too embarrassing!

Hmm.

Mentor Yu didn’t pursue the question further. She looked to Wang Xian and said, “Wang Xian, here’s a sword for you!”

A blue treasured sword was thrown towards Wang Xian.

Wang Xian reached out his hand, caught the sword and was taken aback.

[Phantom Sword: Level 11]

Level 11! It’s a Level 11 Spiritual Weapon!

Wang Xian was astonished. Pulling the sword out of its scabbard, he realized that the blade was blue and almost transparent.

Moreover, the edge was incomparably sharp. As he swung it, Illusory Swords were left behind.

“Great sword!”

Holding the Phantom Sword in his hands, Wang Xian’s eyes beamed with excitement.

“If there’s anything you need, you can let me know!” Mentor Yu added.

“Mentor Yu, do you have battle techniques or tactics?” Wang Xian asked directly.

“I’m not imparting battle techniques or tactics. The disciples of our mountain sect are allowed into the scripture depository for an hour each month. In five days, you will be able to enter the scripture depository to choose. I have an elixir pill here too!”

As she spoke, she threw a blue elixir pill to Wang Xian.

[Ripple Pill: Level 5]

[Extractable Dragon Energy: 110,983]

Wang Xian didn’t hesitate at all as he caught it. He bowed at Mentor Yu and said instantly, “Thank you, Mentor Yu!”

“Alright. Practice diligently. I hope you can lead Mt. Fengyu to a new level!”

Mentor Yu smiled and shook her head. She looked across the surrounding disciples before taking off on her sword to return to the mountain peak.

I’ll definitely return this favor!

Looking at the disappearing figure of Mentor Yu, Wang Xian thought to himself.

He lifted the elixir pill and swallowed it instantly.

“Mentor Yu probably knew about Wang Xian’s strength. Otherwise, she wouldn’t give him a spiritual sword and an elixir pill!”

When the surrounding crowd saw the spiritual sword in Wang Xian’s hands and the elixir pill he had just consumed, envy filled their eyes.

Even Yu Ling’er was envious of him.

“What’s the ranking of our mountain sect currently?”

Wang Xian diverted all the dragon energy he obtained to heal his injuries as he asked Hua Yu.

“Nineteenth. There are a total of twenty mountain sects and we are currently ranked nineteenth!”

Hua Yu felt a little embarrassed as he answered.

“Where’s the eighteenth-ranked mountain sect?” Wang Xian asked Hua Yu.

Huh? Hua Yu was stunned for a moment but quickly replied, “They aren’t very far from us. You... You are going to challenge them?”

As he spoke, his eyes lit up. The surrounding crowd also looked at Wang Xian with surprise and shock.

“Lead me there!” Wang Xian replied directly.

“Alright, alright...”

Hua Yu’s eyes beamed up. Considering Wang Xian’s strength, he definitely could defeat the eighteenth-ranked mountain sect.

“Let’s go! Follow me!”

Hua Yu turned to Wang Xian and stepped on his sword.

“Let’s go!”

Wang Xian nodded his head and took off on his sword!

“Go. Let’s go too!”

“Follow them!”

The disciples of Mt. Fengyu were exhilarated. Wang Xian would be challenging the eighteenth-ranked mountain sect. Even if Mt. Fengyu was to just advance by a single position, the resources they would be getting would still be substantial.

Yu Ling’er hesitated for a moment but still took off on her sword and followed behind.

“Wang Xian, the eighteenth-ranked mountain sect is Mt. Tianshui. They have twenty-five disciples and the strongest disciple is Wang Beichuan. He’s a little stronger than me. However, you are rather strong. Together with Junior sister Ling’er, Zhao Qian, Liu Dong and me, we definitely will win against them!” Hua Yu explained to Wang Xian with ecstasy.

To challenge a mountain sect, each mountain sect would have to send five representatives. They could choose team battles or individual battles. The challenger would be the one to choose.

These were the rules of Da Hong Immortal Sect.

However, Wang Xian didn’t pay any attention to the rules. He really had no regard for the strength of Hua Yu, Yu Ling’er and the rest at this moment.

Mt. Fengyu was roughly three kilometers away from Mt Tianshui. However, the distance of three kilometers was only a matter of several minutes.

“Wang Xian, let’s fly in directly on our swords. Flying directly into a mountain sect on the sword symbolizes taunting and challenging!”

Hua Yu continued to explain the rules to Wang Xian.

Wang Xian nodded his head and followed behind Hua Yu towards the training ground of Mt. Tianshui.

At this very moment, twenty-odd disciples of Mt. Tianshui were practicing. Some were resting by the side.

There were also disciples who were flirting with each other.

A petite girl sat on the huge rock by the side and was chatting joyously with a few other young men and girls.

“Huh? Someone’s coming? A challenge?”

At this moment, the disciples who were practicing saw a group of people approaching while riding on their swords. They were astonished.

“Challenge? Who dares to challenge us?”

The disciples of Mt. Tianshui squinted their eyes as they tried to catch a glimpse of Wang Xian and the group.

“Mt. Fengyu is here for the challenge!” Hua Yu shouted loudly and his voice reverberated across several kilometers.

“Mt. Fengyu! They are from Mt. Fengyu! They actually dare to challenge us! We just gave them a tough beating last month and yet they dare to come to us today?”

“They must be asking for a beating!”

“Tsk! Could it be Hua Yu has made great improvements in swordsmanship?”

The disciples of Mt. Tianshui stared harshly at the disciples of Mt. Fengyu who were approaching.

“Yo~ Who would have expected people to challenge your Mt. Tianshui!”

At the huge rock, a young man turned to the petite girl and commented with a smile.

“They are disciples from Mt. Fengyu. They are most likely no match for us!” the petite girl answered.

Her eyes squeezed into a line when she smiled, making her look adorable.

“Hehe! This is interesting. Sparring between rookies? Let me go take a look!”

“What do you mean, Senior brother Liang. What do you mean by sparring between rookies!” the petite girl grumbled unhappily at that young man.

“Isn’t the battle between the eighteenth and nineteenth ranked mountain sects a great example of rookies sparing? Haha!” the young man laughed loudly.

“Tsk. I’m not going to talk to you. You are the rookie! So what if your mountain sect is ranked twelve?” The petite girl stared at the young man unhappily.

“Alright, it’s my fault. Let’s go take a look!” The young man carried the girl up as he walked ahead, seemingly going for a show.

Several young men around him also followed him ahead.

“Hua Yu, didn’t I teach you a lesson last month? Why are you here again?”

On the training field of Mt. Tianshui, a young man lifted his head up slightly. He stared harshly at Hua Yu as he remarked.

“Hehe! You guys are definitely going down today. A five on five group battle! Do you have the guts to accept?” Hua Yu snorted coldly. Wang Xian’s presence had emboldened him.

“Haha. Great. My hands are still feeling a little itchy and would love to have you as a punching bag!”
