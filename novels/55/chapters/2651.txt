2652 2652 world-suppressing bell

Boom! Boom! Boom

Just as Wang Xian was conversing with Di Xingnu, waves of powerful force swept over. The sky let out a series of rumbling sounds!

“Eh?”

Wang Xian looked over and revealed a hint of surprise in his eyes!

Everyone in the square quickly looked towards the front of the center. Soon, all of them had their mouths slightly agape. Their faces were filled with shock!

In front of the center, 3,000 to 4,000 youths, middle aged and old flew over, each of them filled with pride!

Amongst them, the weakest was a pinnacle god Lord!

The strongest had an undying emperor level 8 or 9, and there was even a pinnacle undying warrior!

3,000 to 4,000 people flew over in a row, their aura was terrifying!

Their aura wasn’t that powerful, it was that invincible aura!

It was invincible in this generation, strong confidence, even the weak would feel inferior looking at it!

This aura was hard to cultivate.

And this aura, in battle, had a huge boost.

He was invincible!

“This is our emperor’s daughter from before, what a powerful aura.”

“This is the emperor and daughter of our imperial court over the past tens of millions of years. The emperor in the lead has already become a guardian and has reached his twilight years!”

“These are all geniuses who have suppressed generations after generations!”

In front of the viewing stairs in the plaza, all the disciples of the imperial court looked at the figures in front of them with reverence!

Any one of those three thousand or so people was an existence that had suppressed generations in the Imperial Star Field.

They were the most brilliant existences in the same generation.

The emperor’s son and the Emperor’s daughter represented the two most outstanding people in the Emperor Star area.

“Sou Sou Sou!”

When the 3,000 or so Emperor’s daughter stood in front, another group of people flew out from behind.

Similarly, more than 10,000 people flew over from behind. There were still young, middle-aged, and old people.

They were also the most outstanding people of their generation.

There were even some who caught up, surpassing their generation’s emperors and daughters.

These were the disciples who had participated in the competition before, they were the best.

Over 10,000 people had arrived, 80% of them had already reached undying emperor level, in other words, there were over 10,000 undying emperors.

“Ring the Bell!”

A group of Emperor Warriors arrived, the leader of the group was leaning on his walking stick, his white hair was grey, even his face was filled with wrinkles as he spoke softly!

Although his voice was gentle, it reached everyone’s ears!

This was an old man who had lived for nearly ten million years, the former emperor!

“Dong!”

“One bell to warn the world!”

“Dong!” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Two bells to warn the world!”

“Dong!”

“Three bells to suppress the world!”

“The competition between the 100,000 and 3rd generation disciples of the imperial court begins!”

As soon as the old man finished speaking, the huge ancient god Bell in the middle of the hall automatically struck!

Furthermore, a pale voice came from the bell.

The bell sound was like a voice from the heavens, striking straight at the soul.

When Wang Xian heard this voice, his heart trembled slightly.

“What kind of divine artifact is this? It’s actually so terrifying. One Bell to warn the world, two Bell to awe the world, three bell to suppress the world!”

“There are also 100,003 generations of the imperial court? Every 5,000 years, there will be a generation. In other words, the imperial court has existed for more than 500 million years.”

Wang Xian’s heart was shaken. The powerful bell chimes and a long history.

“All the disciples participating in the grand competition will make their appearance.”

“The rest of you can watch the ceremony from the observation stairs. There’s no need to be restrained.”

A smile appeared on the elderly face of the presiding protector as he said faintly.

“Yes, Protector!”

Some of the disciples responded immediately and leaped towards the open space in the middle of the square.

One by one, the disciples entered the square, and soon, millions of disciples landed among them.

“It’s the happiest thing for us old guys to see the imperial court become more and more prosperous, Hehe.”

...

The old protector looked at the hundreds of thousands of disciples below with a smile!

“Dong!”

His walking stick gently landed on the ground with a loud bang.

“Next, the world-suppressing bell will test your strength, mentality, and only 100 to 150 emperors will be left in the square.”

“All disciples must work hard. Even if they can’t enter the top ranks, those who perform well will have a high chance of being accepted as disciples by the experts present!”

At the same time, the voice of the old protector sounded.

The imperial court’s disciple competition was not a competition that went through layers and layers of battles. It went through several days or even more than ten days of selection.

With a powerful divine artifact, the selection was very simple, and there would be no injustice in it.

“Yes!”

The disciples immediately responded loudly.

“Immediately spread out, five hundred meters apart.”

...

The old protector said lightly.

All the disciples immediately spread out, spreading out across the entire square.

“World Suppression Bell, inspect.”

The old protector lightly shouted.

“Weng!”

The world suppression bell in the center lightly trembled, and bolts of lightning covered the entire sky. In the next moment, every surrounding space was torn apart, becoming a separate domain.

“Crackle! Crackle!”

Bolts of lightning fell on everyone’s bodies, and bolts of lightning appeared in front of the millions of disciples.

The Lightning was illusory, and it transformed into a human figure. Each human figure had the combat strength of an eternal God Lord at the fourth rank.

“The first test begins. Defeat the opponent in front of you.”

The Old Protector said.

“Yes!”

“Kill!”

“Fight!”

All the disciples knew that the assessment had already begun. They stared at the Thunder and lightning in front of them as they gathered their opponents and charged over immediately.

“This world-suppressing clock is really magical.”

Wang Xian saw the scene in front of him and swept his gaze across the world-suppressing clock that was standing in the middle.

The assessment had already begun. The first round of the assessment would eliminate 99% of the participants.

“The Thunder of the fourth level of the Eternal Celestial Master is of no threat to the star Lady.”

Bei Shuang looked at the position of the star Lady and said calmly!

“There is indeed no threat.”

Wang Xian nodded his head and swept his gaze over.

At this moment, the dragon blood sword appeared in the hands of the star Lady of the imperial court. She waved it at the Thunder figure in front of her.

A beam of energy swept past and the Thunder figure collapsed instantly.

There were also many people who could destroy the lightning figure in one strike.

There were also some who looked extremely relaxed.

Those disciples who were more relaxed raised their heads slightly, waiting for the lightning figure to appear ten seconds later.

Ten seconds later, two lightning figures appeared, and their strength was the same as before.

The imperial court’s disciples also waved their arms, and they were instantly destroyed.

Ten seconds later, three figures appeared.

“The first test is a little boring. The disciples with real ability can’t show it. I almost fell asleep during the test!”

“Hehe, you really know how to brag. The first test is just to select people. Some disciples can’t reveal their trump cards!”

“Oh right, I think that Emperor Soul song is more optimistic. His strength is now at the seventh rank of the Eternal God Lord, Right?”

“I think di Ming is a good candidate. Yesterday, my brother came to me and I gave him a treasure. Now, Di Ming has broken through to the seventh level of the Eternal Master God Realm!”

“Realm is one thing, but it’s more important than actual combat and power!”

In the front, the former emperor and his daughter, the former Heaven’s favorite, were talking and smiling.
