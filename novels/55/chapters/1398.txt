Chapter 1399: The members of the 1399 Dragon Palace came to pick up the brothers and bring them home

“City Lord, what happened? Do you want me to go there too?”

Two figures flew out of the cave in the middle of the 10,000-meter-high peak.

At this moment, a voice suddenly sounded.

The city lord of Xiaoyao City immediately stopped and looked toward the huge waterfall.

“It’s a small matter. You Don’t need to do anything. If you’re bored, you can go and take a look!”

He said indifferently towards the waterfall.

“Alright, I’ve been here for a few years now. Let’s go out and breathe some air!”

“Pop!”

A Shadow flew out from the center of the waterfall and disappeared.

The mayor of Xiaoyao City smiled and moved towards the weapons district.

However, at this moment, the entire Xiaoyao City started to move.

Luxurious carriages and powerful experts riding on powerful fierce beasts drove toward the weapons area.

“Hurry Up! The order of Xiaoyao city has been given. Next, we have to obey the orders of the young mayor and destroy those guys from the dragon-phoenix Dynasty!”

“Haha, how Dare You Be So arrogant in our Xiaoyao City? You are courting death!”

“That’s right. Our Xiaoyao city is a neutral city. Although it’s neutral, it doesn’t mean that we’re easy to bully. A brat from a dynasty dares to provoke our young city lord. It seems like he thinks that Xiaoyao city is easy to bully. Haha!”

On the road, the families and experts were all laughing.

As the most powerful city within a 100,000-kilometer radius, as a city that would have dozens of top-tier factions come every five years, when all of them moved, the power they unleashed would definitely be far beyond the imagination of ordinary people.

It was possible that the owner of a shop was an expert at the insightful void tier.

“Hiss, so many insightful void tier experts. There are simply too many. In just a few dozen seconds, we saw over a dozen insightful void tier experts go over!”

“Xiaoyao city was established by the mayor of Xiaoyao City. It is the safest city within a 100,000-kilometer radius. At the same time, it is also the most prosperous city. In just a hundred years, a large number of insightful void tier experts have been born in Xiaoyao City. All the experts who live here have to listen to the orders of Xiaoyao City. This is the rule. When the Xiaoyao order is taken out, all the experts in Xiaoyao city must be present!”

Some of the experts from the dynasties and sects looked at the experts in Xiaoyao City in shock and followed behind them in a low-key manner.

“Not good, Dragon King. Something has happened. The young city Lord has taken out the carefree token to deal with us!”

At this moment, in the manor where Wang Xian and the rest were temporarily staying, more than 2,000 members of the Fire Hammer tribe were packing up their belongings.

The Fire Hammer tribe leader walked to the hall hurriedly and ran over with a face full of panic.

“Carefree order? What’s going on?”

Wang Xian was sitting in the main hall. When he heard the report from the chief of the Fire Hammer tribe, he asked him.

“Once the carefree order is issued, it can order all the forces and powerhouses in the entire Xiaoyao city. The young master of the city will take out the carefree order to kill you, Dragon King!”

The chief of the Fire Hammer tribe said with an embarrassed expression.

“Order all the forces and powerhouses in Xiaoyao City to come and kill me?”

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly and revealed a smile.

“Yes, Dragon King. There are already powerhouses gathered around our manor!” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Boom! Boom

“Be careful, be careful!”

Just as the fire hammer chief finished his sentence, there were loud noises coming from the surroundings.

Ao Jian and a few golden swordfish had a slight change in expression. The longswords in their hands were aimed at the sky to block the attack.

“This is bad. They actually attacked directly!”

The fire hammer tribe leader’s expression changed drastically. He raised his head and looked at his surroundings.

“Let’s go. Let’s go out!”

Wang Xian frowned slightly. His eyes revealed a hint of coldness.

Boom! Boom! Boom

Just as they walked out of the house, the energy that supported the house dispersed. The entire house collapsed immediately!

In the surroundings, the entire huge manor and all the buildings collapsed.

“Not good, Jin Ming. It’s all my fault. It’s all because of me that the young city Lord...”

“Third miss, you don’t have to worry. With Our Dragon King Here, you don’t have to worry. Don’t Worry!”

As she spoke with a pale face, Duan Jinming quickly comforted her.

“Hiss, all the experts in Xiaoyao city are here!”

“It’s over, it’s over!”

“They want to kill the Dragon King, Let’s fight it out with them!”

“That’s right, let’s die. Rather than live in vain, it’s better to die in glory. These few days, we have enjoyed unprecedented respect. It’s the Dragon King who makes us proud. If they dare to attack, we’ll fight it out with them!”

As soon as they walked out of the room, the angry voices of the Fire Hammer clan came from around them.

Even though their faces were extremely pale, they were still clenching their fists tightly.

Wang Xian swept his gaze across them. A satisfied look appeared in his eyes. When he looked ahead, his gaze froze slightly.

In the sky, seven to eight experts at the profound void tier were staring at the entire manor with cold eyes.

On the street in front, hundreds of figures were walking towards them.

The leader was the young city lord of Xiaoyao City. He held a long sword in his hand, and the Xiaoyao token floated above his head.

The four top families of Xiaoyao City followed behind him, and a group of youths followed on his left and right.

In all directions, the manor within a one-kilometer radius was completely surrounded.

Behind the young city lord of Xiaoyao City, there were some experts from other dynasties and forces watching curiously.

Basically, all the voidwalkers in the entire Xiaoyao City were gathered around.

With a glance, there were at least a hundred of them.

“Pah Pah Pah!”

The sound of footsteps could be heard. The young city Lord walked to the front of the messy manor with a cold expression.

He swept his cold gaze across everyone who was in the ruins. His gaze landed on Wang Xian and was filled with killing intent.

“Young castellan, I don’t know what kind of rules we have broken in Xiaoyao City. Please bring your men to attack us!”

The Fire Hammer tribe leader felt the cold atmosphere around him. He quickly cupped his hands and said loudly.

“The Order of Xiaoyao has been issued. There is no reason nor need for any reason!”

However, before the young castellan could speak, a voice filled with authority came from the sky.

Everyone present was slightly shocked as they all looked towards the sky.

“That is...”

“Hiss, the city Lord has actually come. I didn’t expect the city lord to come personally!”

“My God, he has actually alarmed the city Lord!”

“Once the carefree order is issued, the city Lord will personally make a move. This is the rule that the city lord set when he issued the Carefree Order!”

Everyone’s faces were filled with shock.

“Father!”

“City Lord!”

The young city Lord bowed, and all the families and experts of the carefree city hurriedly bowed as well.

Even the experts from the other dynasties looked at the expert in the sky with respect.

This person was the strongest existence within a 100,000 kilometer radius.

“Soldier, the carefree order has been issued. Next, you will be the Judge!”

“All the families and experts in the carefree city, including me, will be led by you!”

“Begin, the Judge!”
