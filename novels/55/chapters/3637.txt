3638 3637 invincible zone

The Dragon Palace’s auction this time was mainly for medicinal pills, divine herbs, and five elements innate spiritual treasures!

Therefore, they could use innate spiritual treasures to bid!

When the auction started, there was nothing much to say about this auction!

As long as you had enough treasures, you could bid for what you needed!

The items that the Dragon Palace took out this time were very large. Apart from a few innate spiritual treasures, there were also hundreds of darkness and light elements innate spiritual treasures!

There were also three soul returning fruits and all sorts of strange treasures!

Other than that, there were also some items that were auctioned by experts from high-level races!

The total number of items auctioned was over a thousand!

With over a thousand items, the speed of the auction was very fast.

In order to prevent those experts from the peak races from auctioning the items, the high-level races did not dare to make a move. Hence, they could hide their identities in this auction!

The auction officially began. One by one, the treasures were auctioned off.

Wang Xian sat there and watched with a smile on his face!

One by one, the items were auctioned off. Half a day later, the auction for the innate treasures began!

The first innate treasure was of the darkness attribute. The competition was very intense!

Not only did the powerhouses from the top-tier races make a move, there were also the powerhouses from the higher-tier races making a move in secret!

The high-level races couldn’t be underestimated. Many of them had accumulated over tens of billions of years.

A Universe Master of a pinnacle race might not be able to compete with them!

However, the first innate true treasure was obtained by a great being of the dark race!

The second innate true treasure was light-elemental, and this one was finally obtained by a great being of the Immortal Empire!

The third innate true treasure was of the metal element!

When this innate true treasure came out, the Mad Demon Seal of the Invincible region was used!

This mad demon from the invincible region had a lot of resources!

The more great beings they killed, the more they gained!

Even ordinary pinnacle race great beings didn’t have as many treasures as him!

Unfortunately, when he attacked, he met a great being from the Godly Tiger Race! Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

This great being’s power was above universe master level one!

When he made his move, the Mad Demon Seal of Invincible region was defeated!

Weng! Weng

When this metal-elemental innate true treasure was bid for by the great being of the godly tiger race, an intense energy fluctuation came from the back!

“A trash who can’t even control his mind is useless no matter how powerful he is.”

The black vulture king glanced at the restriction behind him and commented with disdain!

Wang Xian looked over curiously. He was very curious about the crazy demon of the Invincible Region!

Such an existence was stronger than the Tai Shui Demon King and the rest!

There were two reasons for such a strong person to become a crazy demon.

One was that he had not broken through for a long time and the passage of time had changed his mind!

The second reason was that they would think of ways to improve their strength after not breaking through for a long period of time. After their strength had increased, they did not have a corresponding realm to match with each other. It was easy for them to lose control, which meant that they could not control themselves!

This was the reason why they were crazy!

They had become stronger, but they were also crazy!

With such an existence, it would be even more difficult for them to break through!

Wang Xian sized up this old crazy demon called Ban with curiosity!

It shouldn’t be too much of a problem for him to deal with him!

Although he was very strong, he couldn’t kill the Supreme Water Demon King in an instant!

However, he didn’t even manage to get an item, yet the energy in his body was already emitting such a huge fluctuation. One could imagine how serious the situation was!

After the metal-elemental innate treasure was obtained by the Godly Tiger clan’s experts, there weren’t many items left!

Finally, there were three soul-returning embryo fruits!

These fruits had a fatal attraction to any Great Beings’disciples!

After all, these were treasures that were equivalent to having one more life!

To some Great Beings’disciples, these were even more important than innate true treasures!

Of course, the value of soul-returning embryo was much lower than that of innate true treasures!

The three soul-returning embryo fruits were auctioned off by the experts one by one, and the auction ended successfully!

“The auction ends here. Friends who have auctioned off the items can contact us to collect the items!”

As Prime Minister Gui spoke, some of the experts around him left immediately!

“Wang Xian, I’m going to leave with my father, Wang, and grandfather. Let’s meet again in a thousand years. By then, I’ll have reached the realm of the ruler of the Universe!”

Ling honggu bade farewell to Wang Xian directly!

“Hehe, alright, then I’ll see you in a thousand years!”

Wang Xian smiled and nodded at her.

“Haha, Little Brother Dragon King, I have high hopes for you. When the day comes when Honggu makes a breakthrough, I’ll invite you over to witness Honggu’s breakthrough together. I’ll also bring you to see our skeleton domain!”

The black vulture king laughed heartily as he spoke to Wang Xian!

“Alright, I will see you in a thousand years!”

Wang Xian nodded and agreed!

“Farewell!”

The spirit demon king cupped his hands. They returned to their divine kingdom and disappeared!

Wang Xian cupped his hands at them as well!

In the surrounding area, most of the experts from the peak races had disappeared!

They either returned to their divine kingdoms or returned to their races through special items!

Boom

“What are you doing?”

However, at this moment, a terrifying aura swept across the surroundings!

Following that, an urgent voice sounded.

“Huh?”

The sudden change of events stunned Wang Xian. He immediately looked ahead!

In front of them, a middle-aged man with a terrifying longsword in his hand stared ahead with a grave expression!

Beside the middle-aged man, there was a young man and a young girl!

They were looking at the figure in front of them with some fear!

In front of them, there was an old mad demon from the invincible region with blue and golden horns, ban!

At this moment, he opened one of his eyes strangely. However, his eyes were filled with madness!

Around the middle-aged man and the others, there was a blue light barrier that enveloped them.

Clearly, this blue light barrier could prevent the middle-aged man and the others from escaping!

“What? It’s cold light sword God. That’s the mad demon expert from the Invincible Zone. What is that Mad Demon expert doing? Why is he attacking Cold Light Sword God?”

“What happened?”

The sudden turn of events shocked everyone around, and they all looked over!

“Is it a spar or something? Cold Light Sword God is very powerful. He once swept through an entire region with a single sword strike, and with a connate cardinal treasure in his hand, he is nearly invincible. His reputation is very well-known!”

Some experts from the high-level races looked over and said in astonishment!

“Give me the innate true treasure in your hand within three seconds.”

At this moment, the opened eye was jumping crazily as if it was suppressing the violence in its body. It said in an extremely low voice!

He wanted the innate true treasure in cold light sword God’s hand!

An innate true treasure of water attribute!
