Chapter 662: Steal The Dragon Vein

Translator: Larbrestudio

The dragon vein ran through all the dynasties of China!

All the Emperors in the olden days would choose their capitals, and build their palaces on the dragon vein.

Wang Xian did not understand the relationship between the Nine Cauldrons and the dragon vein. But he was sure that the Spiritual Energy from the Nine Cauldrons had flowed into the mountain range, coagulating into a dragon vein.

“If this is a well-formed dragon vein, the Dragon Energy from within can keep a dragon sealed. But if the Dragon Energy is exhausted, the dragon vein will be lost forever!”

But now that the dragon vein is undergoing coagulation. Can I...

Wang Xian had a bold idea.

Steal the dragon vein!

The dragon vein was dead. But if he could bring it to life, that would mean he could use it for himself!

To bring the dragon vein to life might be difficult for others, but it was not as difficult as imagined for Wang Xian.

As he moved his finger, a drop of blood slowly descended to the peak.

Under Wang Xian’s control, it flowed toward the interior of the mountain range after the blood dropped onto the peak.

Om!

Once the blood landed on the dragon vein, invisible ripples seemed to rise out from it.

“A Mighty Divine Dragon can be resurrected by a drop of blood because the blood contains domineering energy...Dragon Energy!

“With the Dragon Energy and the soul in the blood, the Divine Dragon could be resurrected. With my blood and the Dragon Energy from the dragon vein, a Divine Dragon will be born!

“Even if a Divine Dragon cannot be born, the dragon vein will come to life and be under my control!”

Wang Xian was looking thrilled in his eyes. The incessant Spiritual Energy condensed into Dragon Energy, and in turn, formed the dragon vein, which contained incomparable mightiness.

Be it a Divine Dragon being born or a dragon vein that came to life, this was a huge opportunity for Wang Xian once the dragon vein was completed.

“When the dragon vein takes shape, the dragon will roar through the sky from here! Haha!”

Wang Xian could not help but let out a burst of laughter while all the Martial Artists of the Underworld looked over with astonishment.

He looked around, sat cross-legged on the mountain, and began his cultivation.

Such cultivation took half a month.

Within this half a month, Wang Xian accumulated a million points of Dragon Energy. However, it was not a lot to him.

But to the rest of the Martial Artists and the five ladies, including Xiao Yu, they benefited a lot from it.

Xiao Yu and Elder Fang were Half-Step to Budding Realms in the first place. Naturally, they advanced to the Budding Realm. On the other hand, Lan Qingyue, Adjaya, and Sun Lingxiu took one step further in the Budding Realm!

The spiritual energy waterfall was a huge opportunity, but the effect was mild for Dan Realm and Budding Realm experts.

However, this was like a free lunch to those who were Inborn and below.

Half a month ago, Level 5 and 6 were the most common levels. There were even Level 3 and Level 4 Martial Artists. But now, it had become Level 8 and Level 9, and almost four hundred had advanced to Inborn level.

The number of Inborn Experts was almost on par with the Underworld before the massacre.

“Dragon King, something big happened in the Underworld again!”

At this time, Mo Qinglong walked over and whispered in his ear.

“What’s the matter?” asked Wang Xian as he stood up slowly.

“Another spiritual energy waterfall emerged in the Guta Mountain Range!” Mo Qinglong reported to Wang Xian.

“Another spiritual energy waterfall?”

Wang Xian was slightly stunned, but a tinge of pleasant surprise flashed in his eyes soon after. “Where is the Guta Mountain Range?”

“The Guta Mountain Range is located not far from the intersection of China and India’s border. The spiritual energy waterfall appeared one day ago, and those Martial Artists who surrendered themselves to the overseas forces previously are rushing over there now!” said Mo Qinglong to Wang Xian.

“Is that so?”

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes. “It looks like the Nine Cauldron Worlds will be descending into the real world one by one from now on. Let’s get there now!”

The appearance of the spiritual energy waterfall also represented the coagulation of another dragon vein. Wang Xian saw that as something more valuable.

In the future, the dragon veins might become powers that surpassed the Immortal class.

“Yes, Dragon King!” Mo Qinglong nodded.

“Xiao Yu, Qingyue, Adjaya, Lingxiu...” Wang Xian called out to the girls beside him.

“Hur?”

They opened their eyes and stared at him, puzzled.

“Another similar place has appeared in the Underworld. I’m heading there now while you girls can practice here!” said Wang Xian to them.

“Sure, Xiao Xian!” The girls nodded.

“If the Spiritual Energy becomes exhausted over here, all of you must leave this place immediately. Remember, all of you MUST leave!” Wang Xian reminded them.

“Mm! Got it. Don’t worry, Xiao Xian!” The girls nodded.

“Continue with your cultivation. I’m off now!”

Wang Xian nodded his head and gestured to Mo Qinglong, Dragon Kid, Dragon Spirit, and the rest of the dragonians.

“Let’s go!”

“Yes, Dragon King!”

A group of dragonians followed behind him, flitting towards Guta Mountain Range at a rapid speed.

Guta Mountain Range was a small mountain range without any fame.

There were hundreds of mountains with the highest peak at about a thousand meters with barren surroundings.

Within the mountains, the wild pheasants and boars would let out cries of excitement from time to time, as though they had evolved into demons. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The cries of wild boars and pheasants caused the surrounding peaks to be even more chaotic.

At this time, blossoming white clouds descended from the sky.

An immense amount of Spiritual Energy gushed down like a waterfall!

“Haha, Spiritual Energy from Heaven. Spiritual Energy from Heaven! Heaven has blessed us!”

“Yes, it’s the Spiritual Energy similar to Mt. Taibai. Finally, we have a chance to become experts!”

At this moment, all the loud and thrilling exclamations had replaced all the howls and roars of the wild pheasants and boars.

All the Martial Artists of the Underworld raced toward the peaks that were shrouded by Spiritual Energy in exhilaration.

None of them could hide the excitement on their faces.

The number of Martial Artists had reached more than two thousand people.

“Hahaha, Dragon King. Even though you didn’t allow us to cultivate over there, we have our own place now!” an elder involuntarily exclaimed with a malevolent look!

“Yes, what have we done wrong? We just want to be stronger. Dragon King, you’re too overbearing. One day...”

Fighting spirit and anger filled that young man’s eyes. He opened his arms with elation and eagerness. “Without such a huge opportunity, how could you, Dragon King, get this far?”

“Now the chance belongs to us. One day, I’ll surpass you and become the most powerful existence in the Underworld!”

All the Martial Artists cried out in happiness. Ever since they’d been chased out by the Dragon King half a month ago, they were filled with anger and unwillingness.

When they heard daily news that some Martial Artists had attained a breakthrough in their levels, their hearts wrenched. Why had they been banned from cultivating over there?

Didn’t they join the overseas forces just to become stronger?
