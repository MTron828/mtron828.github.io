Chapter 488: Princess And Prince

“What? You dare to go against the rules and cause a disturbance here?”

When the surrounding crowd heard the young man with short hair, they were astonished and looked towards Wang Xian.

“You came to our country and won’t show respect to the ladies here?”

A rather plump Dubai lady walked over and stared at Wang Xian coldly. “Hey brat, you are a little too brazen!”

“Get the security of the hotel over! Call the police and lock him up for a few days. After which, deport him back to his country and ban him from ever stepping into our country again!”

“He must be courting death to create a disturbance and bully the ladies of our country!”

Some Dubai citizens chanted angrily and stared at Wang Xian as though he was their common enemy.

As for the rest, they simply went along with these furious people.

Dubai was an exceptionally traditional country. A foreigner being touchy and not following their rules had undoubtedly encroached on their bottom lines.

Wang Xian frowned upon seeing the crowd staring and chiding him.

He stared coldly at the group before him and said, “Do you guys know that you are playing with fire!”

“Brat, you are the one that’s playing with fire. How dare you be rude here and attempt to molest others! You must be courting death, and you’re embarrassing yourself!”

“A person like you shouldn’t travel overseas and bring shame to your country. Moreover, a person like you will be looked down on by others in your country!” Qing Wen smirked and commented sarcastically as he stared at Wang Xian.

“What’s the matter?”

All the people in the banquet hall were looking over. When Mu Xiaowan saw them, she immediately ran over.

“What’s that matter, uncle? What happened?” shouted the little brat as she squeezed through the crowd.

“Nothing! Just a few damned brats who are trying to frame me!”

Wang Xian revealed a chilling smile as he replied to Mu Xiaowan.

“Frame you? Who’s framing you? You are the touchy one and even wanted to pull me out for a dance. When I rejected you, you resorted to violence and even tore my clothes apart!”

That girl that had been lowering her head all along now had tears in her eyes as she stared and shouted at Wang Xian.

“Bastard! How dare you bully the ladies of our country!”

When the girl completed her words, another young man roared at Wang Xian furiously.

“Could this be a misunderstanding?”

Mu Xiaowan looked at the girl, turned to the furious crowd and asked this. She was clearly flustered.

“A misunderstanding? Xiaowan, you can never really tell one’s true nature. You have only known this guy for two days but we have seen with our own eyes that this guy was touchy with the lady!” Gao Yang said to Mu Xiaowan. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“That’s right. Xiao Wan, you should stay away from people like him!” Qing Wen also interrupted. His eyebrows were lifted slightly as he remarked emotionlessly.

“It can’t be. Uncle wouldn’t do such things!” Mu Xiaowan shook her head forcefully, lifted her head and looked at Wang Xian.

At one side, Mu Xiaowan’s mother frowned. The middle-aged and old men that were sitting around her were also baffled.

After all, Wang Xian was from the same country as them and he had embarrassed them here.

“Get the security of the hotel here to contain him. After which, call the police and get him away. Ban him from entering Dubai forever! He’s embarrassing us!” a middle-aged man shouted harshly at Wang Xian.

“That’s right! Get the security and ban him from ever entering our Dubai!” a rather influential Dubai citizen glowered at Wang Xian and remarked.

“I feel that there’s a need to investigate the matter clearly. My friend wouldn’t commit such acts!” Mu Xiaowan looked around and shouted loudly.

Her eyes were a little red. As she lifted her head and looked at Wang Xian, she said, “Uncle, please explain to them. I don’t believe you would do such things!”

“There’s no need to explain!” Wang Xian smiled at Mu Xiaowan and killing desire flashed in his eyes.

He lifted his head slightly and looked across the crowd. Eventually, his gaze fell on the group before him. “I don’t care where we are. If you guys are framing me, all of you deserve death!”

“Deserve death? How brazen! How can you still be so brazen after being caught red-handed in the act! I really wonder who’s giving you the guts!” Tang Lingling’s boyfriend stood beside her and said to Wang Xian with contempt.

Tang Lingling was frowning but didn’t say a word.

“Security, take this arrogant guy away and issue a deportation order. Ban him from ever stepping in!” An old man from Dubai looked at the brazen Wang Xian and shouted loudly.

“Yes, yes!”

As one of the most elite hotels, the security personnel had arrived after hearing about the incident. They nodded their heads at the old man.

Wang Xian smirked and pulled his arm away from the little brat. Killing intent welled up within him.

“What’s the matter?”

At this moment, a voice reverberated from the entrance.

Everyone was taken aback and turned around curiously.

“That’s...”

Everyone gasped in shock.

“That’s Prince Adallen and Princess Adjaya!”

“Why are they here? Why are the Prince and Princess here?”

When the crowd saw them at the entrance, they were astonished.

“I heard that Prince Adallen was conferred as the crown prince suddenly while Princess Adjaya was appointed to supervise. Currently, Prince Adallen is taking over some matters. He’s probably here today to get to know us. He’s the one we really need to keep a good relationship with in the future!”

“Princess Adjaya possesses unprecedented special rights currently. Even her costumes aren’t restricted by the rules!”

“We have to leave a good impression on Prince Adallen later!”

The surrounding crowd whispered while the crowd from Dubai stepped ahead and greeted their Prince.

Seeing a few familiar figures approaching, Wang Xian released the aura around him and smiled.

“What’s happening?” Adallen frowned and asked upon seeing a few security personnel holding weapons.

“A foreign brat was rude to our female citizen. We are getting the security to send him away before deporting him,” an old man answered while lowering his body.

“Who dares to kick up a ruckus here. Ban him from ever entering our country!” Adallen replied solemnly.

“Yes, Prince. It’s our honor to meet our Prince and Princess today!” The old man moved aside and gestured to the Prince and Princess to move in.

“Who’s the guy who is causing trouble?”

Adallen lifted his head and looked towards where the crowd had gathered.

“Shit! The prince and princess are here. Now that this guy has caused such a ruckus, the prince won’t have a good impression of us. This brat really deserves death!” an old man beside the mother of Mu Xiaowan commented softly with a heavy expression.

The other few middle-aged and old men weren’t particularly happy either.

Gao Yang, Qing Wen and the other young man also frowned.

The incident today was blown a little out of proportion!

Nonetheless, it didn’t matter. The bigger it got, the worse the outcome would be for that brat.

For example, the national press might be reporting that this embarrassing foreigner attempted to molest a female citizen of Dubai on a banquet attended by the prince and princess of Dubai. He would definitely be deported and would not be forgiven!
