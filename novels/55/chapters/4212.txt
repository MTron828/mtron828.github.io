“Dragon King, do you want to destroy the Phoenix Clan?” Queen floating water broke through.

She floated in the air and looked at Wang Xian as she spoke.

This was also a way of expressing her stance!

She was able to break through this time because of the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace.

This favor was greater than the heavens!

From now on, she would do whatever she wanted!

Previously, when the Floating Queen received the Dragon King’s investment, she wanted to stand on the Dragon Palace’s side and fight against the Phoenix clan!

Now, she would act without the Dragon King’s permission!

This was gratitude!

“All the disciples of the Celestial Nation will fight for the Dragon King! ”

When the floating queen spoke, all the powerhouses of the celestial nation immediately cupped their hands and replied loudly to Wang Xian!

All the disciples from the Celestial Nation were fighting for the Dragon King!

At this moment, a sharp killing intent erupted from their bodies.

At this moment, the expressions of all the surrounding powerhouses’ disciples changed drastically.

No one expected that after queen floating water broke through, she would fight for the Dragon King.

She would become the enemy of the Phoenix clan!

No one expected that the entire celestial nation would start a war against the Phoenix clan.

When the group of Heaven Origin Destiny Realm powerhouses heard the words of queen floating water, their brows instantly furrowed!

The expression of the emperor of the Phoenix changed drastically as hints of fear appeared on his face.

“What are you guys trying to do?”

The Emperor of the Phoenix roared loudly!

“Roar Roar Roar! ”

“Roar Roar Roar! “

As the Emperor of the Phoenix’s voice faded.

Wang Xian’s crown and the black and white dragon cannon on his body let out

a roar at the same time.

One on the left and one on the right, they turned into two divine dragons.

Five Elements Divine Dragon, Yin-yang Divine Dragon.

The power of the two divine dragons was no weaker than that of a beginner-level heaven origin creator.

“Roar Roar! ”

In the next moment, another divine dragon flew out from Wang Xian’s body.

It was a special illusory divine dragon.

However, the power it emitted caused the space around Wang Xian to crack.

A special energy surged towards the surroundings!

“Space Energy?”

When the body of the Void Divine Dragon flew out, the twelve ancestral witches’eyes narrowed as they shouted in a low voice!

“Roar! Roar! ”

The Unicorn Ox roared and came to Wang Xian’s side, revealing its true form.

Tianci held the branch of the Ancient Tree of destiny in his hand and was on the other side!

Their might was fully displayed!

“Our Dragon Palace is inherited from the Divine Dragon Clan. Today, we will help our ancestors resolve their grudges! ”

“I hope everyone will not stop us! ”

Wang Xian stood there quietly and began to speak!

“This? ?

At the side, a few other powerhouses of Heaven’s origin creation saw that Wang Xian was really going to attack the Phoenix clan.

When they saw the might displayed by Wang Xian, they took a deep breath.

“How… How can the Dragon King be so strong? Not counting the few divine dragons of the Heaven’s origin realm around Wang Xian, his body still contains a majestic energy that can easily kill me. How is this possible? Didn’t he just break through?”

The Emperor of angels saw this scene and spoke while trembling.

Beads of cold sweat appeared on his forehead.

What the F * Ck.

What kind of strength was this?

How long had it been since the Dragon King broke through?

In the past, under the pressure of the angel and Phoenix clans, even the disciples of the Dragon Palace didn’t dare to appear in the nine-origin universe.

Later on, because the Dragon King had broken through, he had a mount of the Heaven’s origin creation level.

At that time, he thought twice and decided not to make the Dragon Palace his enemy!

He resolved the past grudges.

Now, it seemed that this decision was the best decision he had ever made in his life.RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

The current Dragon Palace, not to mention killing the emperor of the Phoenix, even including his Angel clan, was not enough for the Dragon Palace to kill!

He was 100% sure that the fallen Shadow Demon Emperor would avoid the Dragon King’s power!

He would have to avoid it!

This power had reached the Great Dao level, and the ordinary Great Dao level would have to be suppressed by the Dragon King and the others.

It was too terrifying!

(‘I don’t know! ”

The other Heavenly Yuan creation realm experts also shook their heads with grave expressions.

Saint Hetian pursed his lips, not knowing what to do at this moment.

Stop the Dragon King?

But with his strength alone, how could he stop it?

Moreover, even if the fallen Shadow Demon Emperor spoke up and stopped it with him, wouldn’t that be making things difficult for the Dragon King?

With the current power of the Dragon Palace, if the Dragon Palace didn’t get along with the nine-origin universe, it would also be a huge loss to the nine-origin universe.

The main reason was that this power of the Dragon Palace was too powerful.

If the fallen Shadow Demon Emperor didn’t exist, they would probably need all the other heavenly yuan creation realm experts to fight against him.

He looked at the Fallen Shadow Demon Emperor!

If the fallen Shadow Demon Emperor did not speak, he would not have the right!

“There’s something fishy about the divine dragon clan being exterminated. I don’t know what role the Phoenix clan is involved in. Feng Qing Lou, if you can’t come up with a reasonable explanation, we won’t help you. ”

“Dragon King, if the Phoenix clan really did something, My Angel clan will also stand on your side! ”

The expression of the emperor of angels kept changing.

In the end, he gritted his teeth and decided to curry favor with the Dragon King.

After all, the Dragon Palace and the Angel clan had a grudge.

Although it was resolved in the end, the way they dealt with it at that time was only to put the grudge on hold and neither side would pursue it.

However, what if the Dragon Palace pursued their Angel clan in the future?

F * ck, with the power of the Dragon Palace and the Dragon King’s strength, he might not even know who killed him.

The Dragon King already had the strength to kill him in an instant.

Now, he absolutely couldn’t let the Dragon King have any opinions about the angel clan.

Otherwise, who knew if he would secretly take revenge?

Who could stop him?

As for the agreement between the powerhouses of the nine-origin universe? What was the use?

They didn’t even know how they died.

What did it have to do with the Dragon Palace?

“Emperor of Angels, you…”

The emperor of Phoenix’s expression changed drastically when he saw the emperor of angels saying such words. He roared in shock and anger!

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

At this moment, Prime Minister Gui waved his arm from below.

Divine Dragons, the peak dragon species of the Dragon Palace, rose up directly!

They swayed their huge bodies and came to the back of Wang Xian. They stood in opposition to all the strong disciples of the Phoenix clan.

Next, as long as Wang Xian gave the order, a huge battle would break out at any moment!

“Oh my God, is this a fight?”

“It’s not a fight. They are going to destroy the Phoenix clan. The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace and the rest are too strong. Their power is too strong! ”

“Which peak race in the nine-origin universe can compete with this power?

Even the demon clan can’t do it, right? are the Dragon King of the Dragon

Palace going to make a move next?”

“The Emperor of angels is on the side of the Dragon King of the Dragon palace !

At this moment, all the powerful disciples of the other races in the surroundings saw this scene.

They saw the powerful disciples of the Dragon Palace making their move.

They watched the might of the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace and the faint killing intent.

They were all filled with shock.

Were they really going to kill the Phoenix Clan?
