Chapter 380: Bloodbath (6)

“You guys... You guys...”

When the Inborn expert from Mortal Sect saw Mo Qinglong and Mo Yuan charging towards him brimming with killing intent, fear flashed across his eyes.

He was aghast and looked to be filled with fear.

The two men before him were too domineering. They attacked his disciple out of nowhere. When he tried to stop them, they wanted to kill him.

Domineering and arrogant!

“If you can’t stop the mouth of your disciple from spouting nonsense, we can only let him shut up forever. If you dare to stop us, we’ll just have to slaughter you!”

Mo Qinglong swung his Claws of the Devil Dragon rampantly. Dreadful and strong devilish aura was mixed with his bloodlust. This caused the Inborn expert from the Mortal Sect to be overwhelmed with fear.

This momentum was something he could never withstand.

Moreover, there was another incredible expert beside him. This expert also had an identical devilish aura and wasn’t someone he could stop.

“I... I’m just trying to protect my own disciple...”

Fear flashed across the eyes of the old man. Facing two experts who were determined to kill, desperation slowly crept in.

Rumble!

In the second strike, Mo Qinglong and Mo Yuan attacked together.

“Arghh! I’ll fight it out with you guys!”

Incredible aura erupted from the Inborn expert from the Mortal Sect as he growled loudly.

Bam!

However, the all-out attempt from the Inborn expert only managed to stop the attack from Mo Yuan.

Mo Qinglong’s claws of the devil dragon penetrated through the body of the old man from Mortal Sect and smashed him heavily onto the ground.

The old man from Mortal Sect was killed on the spot.

Just because the disciple from his Sect was vulgar and he tried to protect his own disciple...

The surrounding crowd shivered in fear. Even the Inborn experts of these sects and families felt horrified.

“What incredible strength! Within the Inborn Realm, they have likely reached the Pinnacle. It is especially so for that middle-aged man. He has likely reached the Half-Step to Dan Realm!”

“Sss. Our disciples previously...”

Several Inborn experts turned solemn. They recalled their disciples criticizing Wang Xian previously. Although they didn’t use any vulgarities, the two men before them couldn’t be judged with rationality.

Domineering and brutal. Because of a single comment, they had killed the old man.

“No... Don’t... Don’t...”

At this instant, the young man who had been rude previously crumpled on the floor in fear. He looked at the corpse of the expert from his sect as fear and desperation slowly overwhelmed him.

Rumble!

As Mo Yuan waved his arm, a stream of monstrous devilish flames fell onto the young man.

The young man stared, opening his eyes wide as his body was reduced to ashes before the astonished crowd.

Mo Qinglong and Mo Yuan turned their attention towards the Mortal Sect.

“No. Don’t kill us... We have nothing to do with them. Don’t kill us...”

When the disciples from the Mortal Sect felt their gazes, their eyes were filled with horror as they begged for mercy.

The disciples from the Mortal Sect were truly terrified. The Mortal Sect only had two Inborn experts and one of them was killed right before them. Moreover, he wasn’t even able to put up a fight at all. This petrified them with fear.

It’s all the fault of that damned brat! He shouldn’t have mocked that young man.

Mo Qinglong and Mo Yuan looked across them. Seeing the spineless disciples of the Mortal Sect, all they felt was contempt.

Moving again, they attacked the group of dumbfounded disciples of the Nine Lotus Sect.

Argh!

In an instant, pitiful cries resounded within the Sky Mountains. None of the disciples of the Nine Lotus Sect had managed to escape from this massacre.

The fresh blood and pitiful cries resulted in a heavy and solemn atmosphere around the crowd.

“They are going to annihilate the entire Nine Lotus Sect!”

An Inborn expert looked on in shock as the young man with the longsword walked towards the back of the wheelchair and pushed the girl towards the cave.

“This way, please...”

At this moment, the disciples of a few other forces, who were guarding the entrance of the cave, immediately opened a path upon seeing Wang Xian approaching.

Woof woof!

The voice of the Heavenly Hound resounded. It wagged its tail as it moved beside the young master of the Nine Lotus Sect. After which, it bit him and flung him towards the side of the cave.

It did the same to Fang Huazi and threw him beside the young master of the Nine Lotus Sect.

“You... You...”

The young master of the Nine Lotus Sect lifted his head and looked around him. Seeing that all the disciples from the Nine Lotus Sect had been killed, he couldn’t help but feel petrified. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Our Sect Leader won’t let you off!” He gritted his teeth as he remarked bitterly.

“I’ll not let the Nine Lotus Sect have another day of peace. Moreover, I’m going to let you witness it!”

When Wang Xian heard the young master of the Nine Lotus Sect, he lowered his head and said this coldly.

Cough cough!

The young master of the Nine Lotus Sect shivered in fear. Fresh blood oozed out from his severed limbs as vitality was slowly leaking from his eyes.

No matter what the outcome would be, his future had been determined.

From the high and mighty young master of the Nine Lotus Sect, who held extremely great powers, and an Inborn expert, he had become just a handicapped person now.

Furthermore, he might very well die from these injuries.

This made it hard for him to swallow the truth as he slouched on the floor, feeling hopeless.

Why did I offend a death reaper like him?

“The Sacred Followers Guild won’t let you off. They will definitely not let you off...”

From the side, Fang Huazi cursed incessantly.

Wang Xian responded with a cold and mocking smile.

Around them, the corpses of the disciples of the Nine Lotus Sect were scattered all around, filling the Sky Mountains with the scent of blood.

Wang Xian stood at the entrance to the cave and waited silently for the people of Nine Lotus Sect and the master of Miracle Doctor Fang Huazi to return.

Around him, all the other forces were hesitating and eventually chose not to leave.

They wanted to witness the outcome.

The sun set gradually.

It was already into the winter season. As a gust of chilling wind blew past, the surrounding Martial Artist unconsciously pulled their clothes closer to their bodies.

The chilling sensation they felt wasn’t just from the chilling wind. It was also from the situation around them.

Corpses were scattered around them and the scent of blood filled the atmosphere.

Ta ta ta!

“They are back!”

The sounds of footsteps broke the silence of the surroundings. The crowd felt their hearts skip a beat as they stared attentively at the cave.

“Hahahaha! An Inborn Spiritual Weapon and the Ancient Spiritual Sword Technique. My Nine Lotus Sect shall kindly accept them this time!”

“The Ancient Spiritual Sword Technique is extremely powerful. Among all the known sword techniques, it could easily rank among the top three. It is said that it is comparable to the Sacred Seas Sword Technique of the Sacred Seas of Swords. With this sword technique, the strength of the Nine Lotus Sect will increase substantially!”

“Brother Wan, can you give me the Nine Lotus Ossein as soon as possible? My disciple still requires it for treatment!”

“Rest assured, Brother Feng! Since Brother Feng has asked, I would naturally not reject!”

From the cave, the sounds of a conversation propagated out. Soon, a group of people emerged from the cave.

The group that came out wore black attire. At the forefront of the group were two old men and they looked a little exhausted.

The raiding of the ancient tomb had brought them substantial rewards this time.

“Scent of blood?”

When the two old men picked up the smell, their eyebrows knitted together instantly.
