2553 2553 Dragon Star started the game

“Dragon King, everything is ready. Now, we will officially start the teleportation in two days!”

In the Dragon Palace at the bottom of the sea on Dragon Star, Prime Minister Gui came to report with a smile on his face!

Wang Xian stood in front of a group of desolate beasts and paused for a moment!

“Is there anything wrong?”

He asked!

“Currently, everything is going exceptionally smoothly. We haven’t encountered any problems. However, I have a feeling that Xing hua planet will definitely take action!”

“Also, the demon Slayer sect and the Chaotic Tiger Demon Nation have a deep enmity. I don’t think they will watch our commercial planet rise smoothly!”

Prime Minister Gui said!

“What about the Heaven Array?”

Wang Xian asked Prime Minister Gui!

“The Heaven Array is ready. He said that no one will have any problems. As long as someone makes a move, they will definitely not be able to escape!”

Prime Minister Gui said!

“Alright, you guys handle these matters. I will tame these desolate beasts first!”

Wang Xian opened his mouth and said!

The next night, Wang Xian finally tamed more than half of the desolate beasts. He stretched his body and returned to the Dragon King’s Palace!

“Dragon King!”

At this moment, Prime Minister Gui Tiancheng and a group of girls were gathered in the Dragon King’s palace. There were also many experts from the chaotic tiger demon kingdom around them!

“Okay!”

Wang Xian nodded his head and went to the Dragon Throne!

The experts from the chaotic Tiger Demon Kingdom took a look and did not have any objections!

After all, there was an existence in the Dragon Palace who was stronger than them who had submitted to the Dragon King!

“The war pets are almost ready. Is there any problem with the chaotic Tiger Demon Nation?”

Wang Xian looked at the leader of the chaotic Tiger Demon Nation and asked!

“Don’t worry, Dragon King. We have recruited a lot of businessmen and corporations to move into our dragon planet. When they sensed the energy of the dragon planet, they even wanted to move their headquarters here!”

The leader of the chaotic Tiger Demon Nation said happily!

Not only was the Dragon Star’s training grounds heaven defying, its spiritual energy was also about 10 times that of other planets, this was comparable to some heavenly paradises!

However, everything about the Dragon Star was kept secret, the others still didn’t know!

“HM, the most important thing tomorrow is safety, there might be an undying god King making a move, everyone has to be careful!”

“There will be a large-scale concert tomorrow morning. When the time comes, the crowd will be very dense. What about safety?”

As Wang Xian spoke, he looked at the sky array!

“When we enter tomorrow, everyone will be given a spirit token. Please rest assured about the safety, Dragon King!”

The sky array said confidently!

“Alright, then let’s celebrate the glory of Tomorrow’s Dragon Star Tonight!”

Wang Xian smiled and said to everyone!

After a round of celebration, the night passed quickly!

The next morning, Wang Xian led the members of the Dragon Palace and the experts from the chaotic Tiger Demon Nation to a room in the teleportation formation!

“Dragon King, the teleportation formation will be activated in one minute. The concert between the goddess of stars and the Dragon Queen will be held not far away in one hour!”

Prime Minister Gui looked at the time and reported to Wang Xian!

Wang Xian nodded and waited with a smile on his face!

“Dragon King, according to the information we received, there are at least a billion people lining up on the dozens of planets in our chaotic Tiger Demon Nation, waiting for the formation to be activated!”

The king of the chaotic Tiger Demon Nation said excitedly from the side!

“The formation is about to be activated!”

The Heavenly Demon Imperial preceptor said in a low voice!

“Buzz, Buzz, Buzz!”

In the next moment, figures appeared on the teleportation formation on Dragon Star!

“Wow, what dense spiritual energy. The spiritual energy here is so abundant!”

“This teleportation formation is so magnificent. It doesn’t seem crowded even for the hundreds of millions of people here!”

“This isn’t a technological planet. Look around you, it’s a magical formation!”

In an instant, figures walked out from the formation one by one. Some of them were discussing in astonishment!

Some of them were even broadcasting through the AI!

Wang Xian stood at a high place and looked down at the densely packed figures!

At the same time, the Dragon Eyes of the five elements of yin and yang scanned the area ahead!

“Sky Formation, can the immortal king who has entered sense it?”

Wang Xian asked the sky formation at the side!

“Dragon King, no matter how hard they try to hide, they can’t hide from the detection of my formation. All the immortal kings have locked onto it. There are people on the nine planets on top who are monitoring their every move!”

The Sky Formation replied!

“Focus on that person, the Fat Old Man!”

“And that seemingly ordinary woman in white!”

Wang Xian’s dragon eyes of Yin Yang and five elements scanned around. With the heart of Light and darkness, he could sense the good and bad of some people!

This good and bad came from the evil and kindness in their hearts!

Wang Xian asked the heaven array to focus on these people!

“It’s the Dragon King!”

The Heaven Array nodded!

At this moment, on the nine planets around Dragon Star, the members of the Dragon Palace were located in an underground space inside the planet!

...

In front of them was a huge screen that displayed everything on the entire Dragon Star!

There were a few important spots that were locked onto one figure after another. They were all undying godly monarchs!

When the Dragon Star had just opened, they had to be absolutely safe!

“The spiritual energy on this dragon star is so thick, about ten times more than the other five commercial planets!”

“That’s right. The spiritual energy on dragon star far surpasses that of the other commercial planets. It seems that the Tiger Riot Demon Kingdom and the Dragon Palace have invested a lot!”

“The concert will begin in less than an hour. After the concert begins, there will be a pet sale. Let’s hurry to the concert venue and take up our seats!”

Countless people entered dragon star and were shocked by the spiritual energy on Dragon Star!

Then, they walked toward the concert!

The concert of the goddess of stars and goddess Yinxuan attracted a lot of people!

“I didn’t expect the Dragon Star to be so capable!”

“Hehe, a concert with hundreds of millions of people. I’d like to see who dares to come to the dragon star if hundreds of millions of people die here!”

“When the time comes, let’s make a move and leave immediately!”

Following the tens of thousands of people, more than ten figures followed the flow of people and walked towards the concert ahead!

They looked at each other and transmitted their voices!

However, what they didn’t know was that in an underground hall located on the surrounding nine planets, their voice transmitted clearly!

“We have found twelve capable people. Three of them can be confirmed!”

The eyes of a civil official of the Dragon Palace flickered!

Buzz

The arm of the heaven array trembled where Wang Xian was!

“Dragon King, I have found twelve suspicious people. All of them are immortal godly kings. Three of them have been identified!”

The corner of the Heaven Array’s mouth curled up slightly. Twelve images of figures appeared on his body and he said to Wang Xian!

“Old National Advisor, leader of the Chaotic Tiger Demon Nation. The moment they make a move, the formation will seal them. I’ll leave the rest to you guys!”

Wang Xian looked at the twelve figures in front of him and said to the people from the chaotic Tiger Nation!

“This sir is really impressive. Leave the capture to us!”

The experts from the chaotic tiger nation were slightly shocked. They looked at the sky formation in awe and nodded in agreement!
