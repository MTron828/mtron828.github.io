Chapter 860: Under the might of the 0861 Dragon Palace

Translator: 549690339

The Divine King’s roar resounded through the heaven and earth. His voice was filled with anger and despair.

A subordinate of the Dragon King had power comparable to his own. He did not dare to imagine how strong the Dragon King would be.

He had already lost the battle from the very beginning!

“It’s almost over!”

When the strange demon launched its first round of attack, the entire battlefield had already lost its balance.

The Immortals and gods hiding dozens of kilometers away watched the battle in shock.

The strength of the Dragon Palace was too terrifying.

In a one-on-one battle, they had killed thirty immortals and gods in just five minutes.

They were immortals and gods!

“The terrifying demon monkey, Swordsman, and Lei Xia can even fight against two immortals of the divine realm and the Yuwen clan. Even if those terrifying assassins don’t take action, they will be defeated very quickly!”

“The light creature that assassinated them made people’s scalps go numb. In an instant, they assassinated thirty celestials. Even if they were hit in the body, even if they didn’t get hit in the vitals, they would still be poisoned to death by the powerful poison!”

“Not only that strange light creature, but also the girl beside the Dragon King and those special dolphins. The sounds they released felt like they had a powerful magic power!”

“The strongest godly monarch in the west and the strongest divine realm are going to be finished. The Yuwen clan is going to be finished too!”

Some immortals and gods in the surroundings were discussing. As the live broadcast platform was too far away, they could only listen to the live streamer’s description.

But that was all. Everyone on Earth was also very shocked.

Especially not far from here, the power and sound of this war resounded over thousands of kilometers in the surrounding area.

When one raised their head, they could see the battle. It was even more dazzling than the sun.

“Holy Judgement!”

At this moment, the godly monarch’s furious roar sounded again. He held the divine staff with both hands solemnly, and a golden disk slowly rose from the top of his head.

Behind him, an angel with huge wings formed.

The angel held the long sword of light in his hand and attacked the octahedron.

The Angel was at least a thousand meters tall and was extremely terrifying.

“Divine ability, is it? Alright, I’ll let you see my divine ability too, Keke!”

“Serpentium Dock Sky!”

Ba Qi’s eyes were filled with excitement. His huge body curled up together and curled up in the sky. It made one’s scalp go numb.

A corrosive demonic aura surged up from his body.

The nine heads grew longer and attacked divine king Odin from all directions.

“Boom!”

The powerful and terrifying sword of light was hundreds of meters long. When it slashed at Ba Qi’s head, a huge gash instantly appeared.

However, at this moment, the tail curled up together and corrosive demonic qi spread towards the Gash, instantly healing it.

“Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!”

Ba Qi opened his huge mouth, and a terrifying corrosive power spread out like rain.

Every one of them was the size of a washbasin.

“Holy Light, sweep through all darkness!”

God King Okerdin waved the divine staff in his hand, and the Sword of light that was hundreds of meters long immediately swept through the surroundings.

Light restrained darkness, and darkness similarly corroded light.

Sizzle! Sizzle! The sound was endless, and at this moment, the corrosive liquid turned into sinister vipers.

Vipers filled the sky and attacked the angels.

“Keke, go berserk, Keke!”

Nine heads that were dozens of meters in size, carrying countless small vipers, attacked. This scene caused everyone to be terrified.

“What? Die!”

The god King’s expression changed drastically. He waved his divine staff and the thousand-meter-long angel, which covered his body, swung the sword of light at the same time.

“Bang! Bang! Bang!”

The three heads opened their huge mouths and bit the sword of light. Their sinister eyes were full of mockery.

“How can a weak human compete with me? !”

The other six heads of the octahedron let out sinister smiles. The six heads and countless small vipers attacked the angel.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

The sound of an explosion rang out as the angel rapidly melted. The Sword of light also quickly disappeared.

The nine heads and nine pairs of eyes coldly looked down at the godly monarch below. With a sinister smile, they opened their huge mouths and rapidly dived down.

“Ah!”

A miserable cry rang out. This miserable cry caused the bodies of the gods in the divine realm, as well as the immortal gods of the Yuwen clan, to tremble violently.

The Godly monarch had fallen!

“The Godly monarch is dead!”

Everyone was shocked, and despair appeared in their eyes.

The godly monarch was, after all, still a human. The eight-headed serpent was a heaven and earth mutant, and now that it had cultivated the demonic dragon transformation, killing the godly monarch was not too difficult.

After a battle, the eight-headed serpent was not even injured.

“Hiss, hiss, hiss!”

The eight-headed serpent floated 10,000 meters high in the air. Its nine heads looked down coldly, watching the godly monarch’s body fall to the ground and watch the battle below.

“Roar!”

Ao Qitian was also aroused by the death of the godly king. He was originally the strongest existence in the Dragon Palace, but he was caught up by a snake.

The competitive AO Qitian let out a wild roar. His body was covered in black scales and horns. He held the 50-meter-long ocean-pacifying needle in his hand and smashed it toward the ancient Greek leader.

Below, ao shrimp and Ao jian swept their eyes over, unwilling to fall behind.

“Thunder Spear piercing the sky!”

“Merciless sword thrust!”

Two cold sounds rang out as the Thunder Spear in Ao Qi’s hand seemed to be a sharp weapon that could pierce through the heaven and earth. It was thrown directly toward the Mad God.

“The last song, Boiling!”

Seeing this scene, Tang Yinxuan smiled. With a shake of his arm, the strings of the guqin in front of him also began to vibrate.

Waves of violent sounds covered the entire battlefield.

Interweaving, chaotic, and boiling!

Each sound wave was stronger than the last. Together with the members of the Dragon Palace, they were able to activate 150% of their combat strength.

Moreover, they could greatly interfere with and even suppress other creatures.

“Ahhhhh!”

In an instant, the blood of the immortals spilled all over the ground, and the corpses of the gods fell.

“Flee!”

A terrified voice sounded. The Gods of the Garden of Eden, Ancient Greece, and Rome saw the rapidly falling gods and were filled with shock. Fear made them flee in panic.

If the first God escaped, there would soon be a second.

“You still want to escape, Trash!”

The eight-limbed eyes in the sky revealed a trace of mockery as his terrifying tail swept out.

“Peng!”

The escaping immortal God did not even have time to react before he was killed by the terrifying snake tail! FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“The heavens want to destroy our Yuwen clan!”

There were only a dozen or so of the Yuwen clan’s immortal gods left. They were in a sorry state, and their eyes were filled with regret and misery.

“Haha, the Heavens Want to destroy our Yuwen clan!”

An immortal god from the Yuwen clan shouted crazily, his hair disheveled.

“You brought this on yourself, you can’t live with yourself!”

The immortals hiding in the surroundings looked at the Yuwen clan’s immortal God who was roaring crazily with emotion.

If they knew this would happen, they wouldn’t have done it in the first place.

Three days ago, the Dragon King came to your wedding and gave you a congratulatory gift. You humiliated him in public.

Now, the Dragon King has given you a huge funeral!

After today, the Dragon King’s power will shock the whole world!
