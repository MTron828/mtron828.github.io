Chapter 426: Suppression (2)

Xiao Fan held a longsword in his hand while staring harshly at Xiao Ran.

“Son, don’t!”

The wealthy-looking lady tried to stop her son immediately. She was truly worried.

She knew about the strength of Xiao Ran and that her son was a far cry from him. If she allowed her son to fight and the situation to play out, her son would be killed!

“Mom, don’t worry. He’s just a useless brat. I can kill him with a single strike!”

Xiao Fan looked at his mother before lifting his head proudly, staring at Xiao Fan and walking calmly towards Xiao Ran.

“Son, stop there!”

The wealthy-looking lady hurried over and pulled Xiao Fan back. She shook her head at him and gritted her teeth tightly!

“What’s the matter, mom? He is so arrogant! He even declared that he’s going to kill you. Let me slaughter him!”

Xiao Fan looked at his mother before turning his head over and glowering at Xiao Ran.

Tsk!

Just as Xiao Fan completed his words, the old lady snorted. She looked across at Xiao Ran and her gaze finally stopped on Wang Xian as she remarked coldly, “Do you think you could suppress our Xiao Clan with just twenty-five Inborn experts?”

Wang Xian looked at the old lady and chuckled. “In that case, summon all the experts in your Xiao Clan over!”

Weng!

The old lady smashed her truncheon on the ground and tremors were sent reverberating through a radius of five to six kilometers. Her eyes were fixed on Wang Xian and she was clearly discontented. “With just twenty-odd Inborn experts, I wonder who gives you the guts to barge into our Xiao Clan and kick up a ruckus?”

Huh?

“What’s happening?”

“Strong enemies have infiltrated our Xiao Clan?”

“Let’s go take a look at the one who is eager to die!”

“Who? Haha, it’s been a long time since I have killed someone!”

A confused voice reverberated from the location of the Sacred Mountain of the Xiao Clan. Soon after, a group of old men moved rapidly over.

One after another, black figures flew towards Wang Xian. Every single one of them released their aura and shrouded the sky over the entire Xiao Clan.

At the same time, the commotion had also alerted the entire Xiao Clan. All the lights were lit and the disciples were all rushing over.

In an instant, twenty Inborn experts arrived and were hovering in a row above the ground while staring coldly at Wang Xian and his group.

“Xiao Yu, these are people causing troubles in our Xiao Clan?”

At the middle of the row, an old man looked down plainly and asked the old lady.

“Uncle, they claim to be here for revenge and have even killed our disciples!” the old lady lifted her head and answered the old man in the middle of the row.

“Oh? They are pretty strong. Twenty-five Inborn experts?”

“Which force do you guys belong to and give me a reason. Otherwise, all twenty-five of you shall remain here forever!”

The row of old men stared down at Wang Xian’s group as they demanded coldly.

When the wealthy-looking lady saw the older generation experts from Xiao Clan arriving, she finally heaved a sigh of relief while staring harshly at Xiao Ran and Wang Xian.

“It’s true that people act tougher when they get older.”

Wang Xian looked at the twenty Inborn experts in the sky and revealed a mocking smile. He turned to the old lady and asked, “Are there any more experts from Xiao Clan?”

The moment he completed his sentence, another twenty-five dragonians that had been hiding themselves jumped into the air under the leadership of Mo Qinglong and Mo Yuan.

As Mo Qinglong and the dragonians wiggled their backs, pairs of black wings appeared behind them.

The additional twenty-five dragonians released their exceptionally terrifying aura and shrouded their aura towards the twenty Inborn experts from the Xiao Clan.

They hovered in the air just like the experts from the Xiao Clan. The dragonians could do the same as the experts from the Xiao Clan.

“What!”

“How can this be possible?”

“How can there be another twenty-five Inborn experts?”

When Mo Qinglong and the dragonians appeared in the sky, everyone in the Xiao Clan was dumbfounded and horrified.

The group of experts acting tough in the sky shivered after feeling the horrifying aura that was charging towards them. Their expressions instantly turned solemn.

“Fifty Inborn experts! Oh gosh! They have fifty Inborn experts!”

This time, it was the old lady who was completely shocked. She was no longer as cold and composed as before. As she looked across, her face turned gloomier.

“Impossible. This is impossible! How can this kid be...? How can he be...!”

The wealthy-looking lady and the old man from the Liang Family were completely flustered.

The entirety of the Xiao Clan’s strength was here with the exception of those not in Shang Jing.

Xiao Clan had thirty Inborn experts. This was definitely a shocking number. However, the other party had fifty Inborn experts.

Fifty! What kind of horrifying force would have fifty Inborn experts?

“Everyone... How did our Xiao Clan offend you that requires you guys to come to Xiao Clan with such a huge line-up?”

In the air, the old man in the middle of the row was exceptionally bitter. Now that his father wasn’t in the clan, the strength of the other party could completely crush them.

“Whoever dares to make a move will be killed on the spot!” Wang Xian didn’t pay attention to the old man as he repeated himself.

“Aunt Mei, get here!”

Xiao Ran drew his Ancient Spiritual Sword, pointed at the wealthy-looking lady and shouted once again.

The wealthy-looking lady shivered in fear and her face had turned as white as chalk.

She would have never expected such a development.

Initially, she thought they could roll over them by relying on the strength of the Xiao Clan.

However, she was soon filled with desperation as she saw the fifty Inborn experts and the group of experts from the Xiao Clan not daring to make a single move.

Things had deviated completely from her expectation.

It’s no surprise... It’s no surprise that he dares to kill the disciple of the Xiao Clan. It’s no surprise that he didn’t approach the Elders for an explanation. So... So he was apathetic... He couldn’t care about those things!

In one corner, the old man from Liang Family clenched his fist tightly. His back was drenched in perspiration as he looked fearfully at the fifty Inborn experts in the sky.

“I don’t know which force you guys are from. However, if you dare to kill a person from our Xiao Clan, the experts from the Xiao Clan will hunt all of you down!”

Seeing how things had developed, the old lady clenched her fist tightly as she made her threat.

“Shut up! Even if Xiao Quanshan is here, he would have to stand aside and simply watch!” Wang Xian chided coldly.

“YOU...”

The old lady and the surrounding experts from the Xiao Family were dumbfounded. How dare he call our Laozu by his name...

At the same time, they were shocked. Considering he knew about their Laozu, Xiao Quanshan, he must be a maniac or someone with the strength to support his declaration.

Clearly, the surrounding fifty Inborn experts was a glimpse of the strength he possessed.

“Die! Go and repent when you reach where my mother was!”

Seeing the wealthy-looking lady standing there and not moving an inch, Xiao Ran could no longer hold back. He charged towards her with his Ancient Spiritual Sword pointing at her.

“You can’t... You can’t do this!”

When the old man from the Liang Family saw Xiao Ran attacking, his eyes gleamed with struggles and ruthlessness.

He held the longsword in his hand tightly.

“Die!”

Xiao Ran’s eyes were filled with killing intent and he had shrouded a layer of Tranquil Blue Heavenly flame over his Ancient Spiritual Sword.

Capture him! That’s the only way out!

The old man from the Liang Family struck and waved his longsword towards Xiao Ran the moment he approached.

Tsk!

Xiao Ran felt the attack coming from his blind spot. Having been on the receiving end previously, he was on alert. He emitted blue flames from his body and the flames on his Ancient Spiritual Sword raged even more violently.

“Liang Family! My grandfather was from a small family and his entire family was annihilated overnight. This matter definitely had something to do with you guys!”

“All of you are my enemies!”

Xiao Ran was brimming with anger as he released his Inborn aura explosively!
