Translator: 549690339

“Dragon King, this snake’s strength should be close to that of a middle-level immortal. Ao Qitian alone can not take it down.”

In the ocean, Prime Minister Gui watched ao Qitian and the snake’s battle and said with a twinkle in his eyes.

“Dragon King, I’ll go. With AO qitian and I working together, we’ll definitely be able to kill him!”

Ao Jian, who was standing at the side, pleaded to Wang Xian.

“Go!”

Wang Xian nodded his head slowly and looked at the top of the island. “I hope the two immortals don’t make a move. Otherwise...”

A hint of coldness flashed in his eyes.

Whoosh

At this moment, Ao Jian, who was standing at the side, started to move. He stabbed the longsword in his hand at the huge snake that was a few thousand meters away. A terrifying metal sword that was a thousand meters long seemed to pierce through the void as it attacked in an instant.

“Pu!”

The snake that was fighting with Ao Qitian saw the terrifying metal light and its expression changed slightly.

It waved its arm and the seawater below instantly condensed into a defensive water shield.

However, when it was caught off guard, the terrifying sword light still made it spit out blood!

“Another immortal God level existence!”

The snake spat out a mouthful of blood and its expression instantly darkened.

“Today, I will use your blood as a sacrifice!”

Ao Jiandi’s figure appeared at Ao Qitian’s side, and there was no expression on his face.

“Two immortal gods, which faction are you from!”

The sea water behind the snake rose to a height of 100 meters, and it stood motionless behind him. It was ready to attack and defend at any time, and it looked at Ao Jian and Ao Qitian with a gloomy face.

“The force that will take your life!”

Ao Jian said coldly. The long sword in his hand trembled, and thousands of long swords silently attacked him from behind the snake.

The snake’s face changed drastically. A demon monkey had already made him feel a little troubled, and now there was an immortal God who was not weaker than the demon monkey.

Since when were there so many immortal gods? The number of immortal gods in the entire sub-continent was less than two hands!

“We have no enmity. If you want to cultivate at the bottom of the sea, I, snake, will let you have it!”

Snake waved his hands, and his entire body was surrounded by the dark blue seawater, which was at least a hundred meters thick!

“You killed more than a hundred of my dolphins. Today, I will take your immortal God’s blood as a sacrifice!”

Golden Metal Swords appeared behind Ao Jian. The densely packed swords covered an area of a thousand meters.

“What? Killed more than a hundred of your dolphins?”

Hearing his words, the snake widened his eyes and growled with an embarrassed expression.

More than a hundred dolphins?

That was only more than a hundred F * cking dolphins. You F * cking want the life of an immortal God.

Even though the snake had lived for over 200 years, this was the first time it had heard such a ridiculous thing.

They wanted to go against an immortal God for the sake of over a hundred dolphins?

The red-masked elder and the Yanmei two-headed woman who were watching the show were also slightly stunned!

“That’s right, kill our people and Die!”

“Roar!”

Ten Thousand Swords were launched!

Ao Qitian roared. With a violent aura, he raised the metal rod in his hand and smashed it with demonic qi.

The snake’s expression changed drastically. With a wave of his hands, he set up a thousand-meter defense.

“A bunch of lunatics. I’m not playing with you anymore!”

The snake’s expression changed drastically. It moved and was about to flee into the distance.

“Do you think you can escape? !”

Ao Qitian roared and moved his body, leaving behind a terrifying wave trail. He stood in front of the snake and stared at him with his blood-red eyes.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

At this moment, a long sword silently stabbed toward the snake’s chest.

“Pu!”

“Ah!”

“Damn it!”

The snake’s expression changed drastically. He lowered his head and looked at the hole in his chest that had been penetrated without warning. His expression was extremely gloomy!

The flesh on his body squirmed, and the wound quickly healed.

“The snake can’t escape!”

“If we don’t act, the snake might die!”

The Yanmei two-headed woman and the red-masked old man looked at each other, and their eyes flickered.

“Snake, give me the nine spirit snake gallbladder that you nurtured, and I can save your life!”

The Yanmei two-headed woman’s two heads looked at each other, and a cunning smile appeared on her face.

“I want all the territories of your Yin Snake Group!”

The red-masked old man also said with a smile.

“Okay!”

The big snake’s expression changed drastically. It gritted its teeth and nodded heavily.

“Haha, Okay, Okay. The two of you, for our sake, let’s forget about this matter!”

The red-masked old man revealed a smile. His aura shook and an overwhelming aura instantly erupted.

In the sky, the clouds turned fiery-red and contained terrifying flames!

“We have saved the life of the giant snake. So, if the hundred or so dolphins of yours are dead, so be it!”

The face of the Yanmei two-headed woman started to blur. The island that was on the verge of collapsing beneath them started to levitate.

The island that was a few kilometers in size was controlled by her. An immortal-level powerhouse was really capable of destroying the world!

“As expected, he still made his move!”

In the ocean, Wang Xian, who was standing on the Kun, heard the other two foreign immortals making their move. A hint of coldness flashed across his eyes.

“Dragon King, let me exercise my body!”

Prime Minister Gui smiled and reached out to take the turtle shell off his back.

The turtle shell was flickering with a yellowish glow.

“In that case, all three of you stay!”

Wang Xian’s eyes were cold as he moved his body.

“Roar!”

A dragon’s roar came from Wang Xian’s mouth. The dragon’s roar exuded a terrifying majesty.

The shell of the turtle in Prime Minister Gui’s hand emitted a light as he attacked the two-headed woman directly.

Boom! Boom! Boom

Standing in the sky, the red-masked elder and the Yanmei two-headed woman, who were emitting a terrifying aura, released their auras. They stared menacingly at Ao Jian and AO qitian.

However, a power that terrified them came over and their expressions changed slightly.

“There are also immortals!” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Two of them!”

Their expressions changed drastically.

“Madman, Madman, you only killed more than a hundred of your dolphins and you actually sent out four immortals. What kind of force are you? !”

The Yanmei two-headed woman let out a sharp roar and let out a sharp voice.

“Dragon Palace!”

Wang Xian rushed out of the water and opened his mouth. A deep blue water sword flew towards the red-masked elder.

Buzz

At the same time, Prime Minister Gui’s turtle shell emitted a strong earthy yellow light. The island that was suspended in the air for a radius of five kilometers collapsed immediately. The soil on the surface of the island attacked the Yanmei two-headed woman.

“You bunch of lunatics, get lost!”

The Yanmei two-headed woman’s figure moved, and she opened her two faces. With a wave of her arms, she directly scattered the island.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

In the sky, terrifying fireballs directly fell from the fiery-red clouds and met the Azure Water Sword!

“My subordinates only killed over a hundred of you dolphins. Don’t go too far!”

The Big Snake saw a total of four gods, the face revealed a ferocious look, berserk roar.
