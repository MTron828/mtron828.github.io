Chapter 62: A Storm In The Banquet (End)

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

“I’d like to go over and say “hi” to two friends of mine. Old Qin and Old Xue, please have a chat now.”

The banquet continued as per normal. Although the atmosphere had changed a little, the impacts weren’t that great.

After informing Old Qin and Old Xue, Wang Xian turned his attention to the banquet hall and headed towards where Guan Shuqing and Lan Qingyue were.

Feeling the intentional and unintentional gazes from the crowd, the edge of Wang Xian’s mouth started to arch up.

“Chairman Lan, thank you.”

Wang Xian saw Guan Shuqing was talking to her parents and thus went over to Lan Qingyue to express his gratitude first.

Just a while ago, Lan Qingyue had to endure the huge pressure from the crowd to put in good words for him. Lending a helping hand when one was in need was tough, while sucking up to one when he was basking in the light of success was easy. She belonged to the former.

He was a little surprised that Lan Qingyue had chosen to help him but was also grateful to her.

Lan Qingyue, who was in a red evening gown, looked extremely alluring under the warm lights of the banquet hall. While wearing high heels, she was approximately the same height as Wang Xian.

Her beauty couldn’t be appropriately described with words.

“You’re welcome.” Lan Qingyue looked at him with fervent eyes. As compared to their previous encounter, she felt that the strange quality of Wang Xian had gotten stronger by a little.

“It’s too heart-breaking that you have rejected my invitation for a meal twice to thank you for the previous incident!” Lan Qingyue looked at him and recalled his rejections. She couldn’t help but comment unhappily.

“Hehe.” Wang Xian laughed awkwardly. “I’ve really been a little busy in the last two days. However, if you would like to have a meal together, you can come to my restaurant. I’m staying there for almost the entire time each day. I could also give you a treat!”

“Your restaurant? Great!” Upon hearing his reply, Lan Qingyue revealed a faint smile and nodded her head. “In that case, we have a deal.”

“Yeah.” Wang Xian smiled and nodded his head.

Just beside them, Guan Shicheng felt his head aching when he saw Lan Qingyue and Wang Xian chatting.

He naturally knew who Lan Qingyue was, as she was the future successor to the Lan Family. Her family wealth was among the top three in Rivertown currently.

Moreover, there was nothing one could pick on about Lan Qingyue’s looks. Within the entire Rivertown, she was at the highest level.

Seeing how she had tried to protect Wang Xian a while ago, he was able to tell something from it.

When it came to looks, he was confident that his daughter wasn’t inferior to Lan Qingyue. However, when it came to family background, the difference was stark.

It was especially so after what he said previously. At the thought of this, he started to regret further.

He wasn’t just feeling regretful but also feeling a sense of danger. If his son-in-law was snatched away, it would be pointless for him to cry over it then.

Guan Shicheng’s expression was changing constantly. He was thinking of ways to get on the good books of Wang Xian and also to make up for what he’d done previously.

Guan Shuqing saw Wang Xian and Lan Qingyue chatting joyously and was feeling a little uncomfortable about it.

After finishing his chat with Lan Qingyue, Wang Xian turned his head and smiled at Guan Shuqing. He walked over and asked, “Shuqing, are you alright?”

“I’m fine.” Guan Shuqing nodded her head. She looked at him and said, “Thank you, Xiao Xian.”

“You don’t have to.” Wang Xian smiled and shook his head.

“Son-in-law, I’m really sorry. I’m really sorry. I was wrong in the incident previously. It’s all my fault! Please forgive me.”

At this moment, Guan Shicheng came over shamelessly and spoke with a sincere face. He was even calling Wang Xian his son-in-law.

Wang Xian was taken aback and so was Guan Shuqing.

He had not expected Guan Shuqing’s father to be so shameless.

“Father, what are you calling him!” Guan Shuqing’s face had turned red while speaking to her father.

“Hehe.” Guan Shicheng continued smiling and said to Wang Xian once again, “I was foolish and timid previously. Please don’t take it to heart.”

Wang Xian was speechless while looking at Guan Shicheng. The current him was completely different as compared to when he first saw Wang Xian.

What an opportunistic person!

Wang Xian wasn’t too calculative with him, as he was Guan Shuqing’s father after all. However, he wasn’t being too close and friendly with him either. He shook his head, smiled, and replied, “It’s alright.”

“As long as you are fine with it! Have a chat with Shuqing first while I get some food together with her mother. Come over to our house for dinner when you’re free! I’ll get my wife to make you some delicious food.” Guan Shicheng could feel that Wang Xian was keeping a distance from him. However, he was rather thick-skinned and spoke solicitously.

Wang Xian nodded his head. “Sure, uncle.”

“Great!” Guan Shicheng heaved a huge sigh of relief. He turned around and walked towards a woman by the side.

“Xiao Xian, my father is a little... I hope you don’t mind,” Guan Shuqing said as she looked at her father. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“It’s fine.” Wang Xian smiled and shook his head. After which, he turned to Guan Shuqing and said, “This is Lan Qingyue. Shuqing, I believe you know her too.”

“Hello!” Lan Qingyue looked at Guan Shuqing, smiled, extended her hand and greeted.

“Hello!” Guan Shuqing also looked at Lan Qingyue and extended her hand.

A special force field was formed between the two of them.

When the young men in the banquet hall looked over and saw these two gorgeous ladies, they couldn’t help but feel slightly shock.

At the same time, they were envious of the teenager standing beside them.

“You girls are really charming.” Feeling the surrounding gazes, Wang Xian smiled and complimented them.

“Junior Shuqing is really beautiful and has attracted everyone attention.” Lan Qingyue smiled and commented.

“It’s senior’s charisma that is stronger. I’m still a long way behind.” Guan Shuqing replied immediately.

The atmosphere was slightly strange.

“Haha, both of you are beautiful.” The insensitive Wang Xian didn’t notice and simply complimented the two girls.

This caused the two girls to break into laughter while looking at each other.

“Wang Xian, I have to go greet some people with my uncle. Don’t forget that you will be treating me to a meal,” Lan Qingyue smiled and said to Wang Xian.

“Alright, go do what you have to.” Wang Xian nodded his head.

Subsequently, Wang Xian chatted with Guan Shuqing for a while before heading towards where Old Qin and Old Xue were at.

Old Qin introduced him to some people in Rivertown. There were businessmen and also officials working in the government.

For a guy that could make Old Qin bow down to apologize, they naturally wouldn’t dare to be lax in entertaining as they were full of smiles while conversing with Wang Xian.

Through this banquet, Wang Xian obtained a lot of name cards. When he walked out of the banquet hall, it was already 11 o’clock at night.

After bidding goodbye to Old Qin, Old Xue, Lan Qingyue, Guan Shuqing and her parents, Wang Xian rode his heavy-duty motorcycle towards school.

As the cold wind blew on him, Wang Xian was feeling very comfortable. After today, he could be considered as having a strong foothold in Rivertown.

What would come next was to strengthen himself.

The moon was bright and Wang Xian was heading back to school on his heavy-duty motorcycle. The trees along the pathways were moving past him rapidly.

There were barely any other people or cars left on the roads.

Just as Wang Xian was coming to a curve, a black shadow crashed towards him.

Screech!

Wang Xian was slightly shocked and immediately slammed on his brakes. Sharp grinding noises propagated as the motorcycle’s wheels scratched against the road.
