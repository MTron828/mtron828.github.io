Chapter 1272: 1273 ling Jian ‘ER’s domineering aura

Translator: 5496903

The double-sealed ghost of the Ghost Monkey clan stared at the human’s direction with a face full of ridicule as he roared loudly.

Disregard and contempt were displayed without a doubt.

An invincible aura directly rushed towards the human’s direction.

The Monster Race was invincible!

“The sixth ranked on the prodigy roll didn’t come, how can we fight?”

“The tenth, sixth and fourth ranked didn’t come, this... now the ninth ranked monster race wants to fight with our fifth ranked prodigy?”

“This is too embarrassing, this is too embarrassing!”

On the surrounding arenas, when the crowd saw the 7th ranked long Xiaochen retreat, and the 6th ranked genius didn’t come, their faces all turned ashen.

Especially when they heard the arrogant words of the demonic beast race, many people wanted to rush in.

Even those experts at the profound void realm had extremely ugly expressions.

“Haha, the Coward ranked sixth on the human prodigy roll didn’t come. Come, come, let’s put him in fifth place, hehehe!”

A maniacal laughter came out of ghost monkey’s mouth, causing Luo Shihua, who was ranked fifth, to look extremely gloomy.

Fifth on the human prodigy roll versus ninth on the Demon Beast Prodigy roll.

If he lost, it would be a disgrace to humanity.

“Then let me experience it for you!”

Luo Shihua moved and flew towards the arena.

The battle began!

As one of the top five prodigies of humanity, Luo Shihua was also a disciple of a large faction. Whether it was battle experience or strength, he was definitely a peak existence at the half-step profound void tier.

However, Ghost Monkey’s strength was not weak either. The battle between the two of them was actually hard to determine.

Seeing this situation, the human’s expression did not look good.

If this was the case for the ninth battle against the fifth, how was the battle going to continue?

“Luo Shihua will only be able to defeat this ghost monkey at most. Among the demonic beasts, the second-ranked one is a powerhouse at level one of the Seethrough realm. Be careful!”

At this moment, there were only Wang Xian, Ling Jian ‘er, and Ren Xingchen on the Heaven’s Pride Bridge.

Wang Xian looked at the group of demonic beasts in front of him and reminded the two of them indifferently.

“Don’t worry, senior. I’m not afraid even if I were to face that demonic beast at the first level of the Seethrough Realm!”

Ren Xingchen heard Wang Xian’s reminder and said respectfully immediately.

“Okay!”

Wang Xian nodded his head faintly.

“I can also fight against demonic beasts at the first level of the Seethrough Realm!”

Ling Jian ‘er, who was at the side, looked at Wang Xian and said plainly.

“That’s good. Be careful!”

Wang Xian smiled and placed his hands together as he looked at Ling Jian ‘er with a smile.

“Good, good. As expected of the fifth-ranked Heaven’s pride expert. Haha, I, double-sealed Ghost, admit defeat!”

The battle lasted for a full ten minutes. In the end, the Ghost Monkey Demon Beast, double-sealed ghost, wiped the wounds on its body and jumped towards the back.

“Huff, Huff, this guy!”

Luo Shihua looked a little embarrassed. It took him a full ten minutes to defeat his opponent. If another one who was stronger than him appeared, it was uncertain who would win!

“I’ll kill this guy!”

Just as the Demon Beast of the Ghost Monkey Clan flew out, an extremely slender female demon with long mouthparts and a body suffused with red and blue light appeared.

Its two red and blue eyes stared at Luo Shihua and extended a tongue that was two to three meters long.

Bloodthirsty Sea Demon Beast!

Luo Shihua’s expression kept changing. After hesitating for a moment, he moved and walked out.

“I’ll leave it to Ling Jian ‘er, Ren Xingchen, and the Nameless Sword Demon Brothers and sisters!”

Luo Shihua’s departure meant that there were only three people on the human side.

Tang Feng, who was the fourth, did not come, so Ling Jian ‘er, who was the third, could only make a move.

“Keke, there are only three people left. Then I’ll take care of two!”

The bloodthirsty sea monster’s tongue was waving outside, and its entire body was emitting a bloody aura. It stared at Ling Jian ‘er and said, “I like human girls. Keke, come!”

“Humph!”

Hearing the provocation of the bloodthirsty sea monster, a cold expression appeared in Ling Jian ‘ER’s eyes.

“Eighth Challenge, third challenge, this...”

The humans around the arena revealed a bitter expression.

“Eh? Is this Ling Jian ‘er the daughter of the sect master of the Heavenly Sword Sect?”

At a spot around the arena, manager Qian saw Ling Jian ‘er coming to the center of the arena, and his eyes lit up as he asked the young man beside him.

“Yes, it’s her. A few days ago, twenty insightful emptiness realm experts from the heavenly sword sect invited Ling Jian ‘er back to the sect, but Ling Jian ‘er rejected them. In the past, her father didn’t acknowledge her as his daughter. Now, it’s Ling Jian ‘er who doesn’t acknowledge her father. Her personality is very strong!”

The young man beside him said to manager Qian.

“Oh? Is That So?”

Manager Qian raised his eyebrows, and a smile appeared in his eyes.

“What’s the matter, shopkeeper Qian? Have you taken a fancy to this beauty?”

The youth beside him asked with a smile. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Haha, a Graceful Lady, a gentleman’s Dream!”

Shopkeeper Qian narrowed his eyes slightly. “I hope that she won’t be killed by the Demonic Beast clan. Otherwise, it would be a pity!”

“I will kill you gently!”

At this moment, the sinister voice of the bloodthirsty sea monster sounded from the arena. Its body moved like a ghost.

A large amount of water energy surrounded it. This water energy condensed into its clone and attacked Ling Jian ‘er directly.

Ling Jian ‘ER’s expression was extremely cold. The golden longsword in her hand trembled slightly.

“Ling Jian ‘ER’s strength isn’t weak. She should be able to defeat this demonic beast!”

“She should be able to. But so what if she can defeat this one? It’s only ranked eighth. With Ling Jian ‘ER’s strength, it would be difficult to defeat even the seventh ranked Demonic Beast!”

The people around the arena watched the battle below and sighed lightly.

Although Ling Jian ‘er was strong, the Demonic Beast Heaven’s pride was even stronger!

“Weng!”

In the arena, when the surrounding thousands of bloodthirsty sea monsters attacked her, the long sword in Ling Jian ‘ER’s hand directly swung forward.

Resplendent golden light, like stars in the sky, directly attacked the clones one by one.

“Ah!”

In an instant, a terrified cry came from one of the clones.

Ling Jian ‘ER’s figure moved, and the longsword in her hand once again slashed out a resplendent golden light.

The golden light pierced through, easily piercing through the aquamarine defense.

The aquamarine defense disappeared, and the surrounding water energy dissipated.

A corpse fell onto the stage!

“What?”

“This... Ling Jian ‘ER’s strength is so strong!”

“My God, he actually insta-killed her. Amazing, simply amazing, Ling Jian ‘ER is simply too strong!”

“Awesome, Haha, Awesome!”

When the people around the stage saw that Ling Jian ‘ER had actually insta-killed a bloodthirsty sea monster, their faces were filled with shock, and they immediately burst into cheers.

Insta-killing a demonic beast prodigy with one move, this was simply an exciting thing for humans.

“This human woman...”

The demonic beasts looked at Ling Jian ‘er with shock and embarrassment.

Ling Jian ‘er stood on the stage and didn’t show any signs of killing the bloodthirsty sea monster.

She looked at the demonic beast prodigy and said, “Seventh, sixth, fifth, fourth, and third, come together. Don’t waste time!”
