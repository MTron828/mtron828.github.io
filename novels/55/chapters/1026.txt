Chapter 1027: 1028, do you regret it? Let’s Go

Translator: 5496903

“The du family was wiped out by the dragon spike. In just one night, another powerful family was wiped out by the dragon spike. This is too terrifying!”

“It’s said that not only the du family, more than 20 people died last night. The weakest among them was at transcendent level 5!”

“Some people said that the dragon spike came and brought darkness. I still don’t believe it. This is too F * cking awesome. It wiped out two large families in just two days!”

“The du family must have a feud with some family and was assassinated by the dragon spike. To wipe out the du family, it would cost at least 500 million to 600 million middle-grade spirit stones!”

“This is too crazy! How long will the dragon Spike’s assassination last?”

“I heard from Saint Sea Town that the dragon Spike wouldn’t make a move when the assassins weren’t hired. Oh My God, this will take at least one to two months in Saint Sea Town!”

“Not only that, but we must be careful when we make enemies in the future. Who can resist the dragon spike?”

“After the dragon spike, there will be light?”

Early in the morning, the whole East Sea city was in an uproar!

On the first day, the dragon spike destroyed the snake family, and on the second day, the dragon spike destroyed the du family.

The two famous families in East Sea city had all been destroyed.

Their hundreds or even thousands of years of foundation had been easily destroyed. This kind of destructive attack shocked everyone!

The true power of the dragon spike wasn’t as simple as it seemed.

Soon after, all the clans and mercenary groups in eastern sea city became nervous.

F * ck, if their enemies hired the dragon spike, wouldn’t they be finished too?

Perhaps the only ones in East Sea city who were more at ease were those who had not done anything bad, and those who were kinder.

There were also those who had Type 9 transcendents who were not afraid.

Type 9 transcendents had almost reached the peak, and it was hard to assassinate them.

Although they were not afraid, it did not mean that others were not.

After the Du clan was destroyed, there were only 2 paths left for the majority of the clans.

First, hire the dragon spike to eliminate the opponent.

Second, make an agreement with the enemy and shake hands to make peace.

All of a sudden, all the families and mercenary groups were considering this problem.

They didn’t mean to hire the dragon spike just because they wanted to. The commission was definitely a huge expense.

When Wang Xian walked out of the house, he realized that the entire Donghai city was talking about the dragon spike assassin organization.

All of them were either surprised, shocked, excited, or embarrassed.

“I’ll go and purchase some elixirs and spiritual herbs today. Since I don’t have to help Fengxian, I can totally refine the elixirs myself. If I refine them myself, I can save half of the cost!”

Wang Xian thought to himself as he walked straight to the center of the Eastern District.

Yesterday, he obtained 300 million middle-grade spiritual stones from the du family. Currently, Wang Xian had 1.8 billion to 9 billion spiritual stones in his hands.

He also obtained quite a number of elixirs. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

However, he didn’t sell these elixirs. Instead, he kept them. These elixirs were of great use to him.

After exchanging these 1.8 billion middle-grade spirit stones for resources, he could definitely raise his level by one level.

However, he didn’t plan to raise his own strength for the time being. Instead, he wanted to raise the strength of the strange demons first.

In East Sea city, other than the Phoenix Elixir and weapons workshop which had a large number of elixirs, the other one was the life and Death Elixir Workshop.

The Life and Death Elixir Workshop was an elixir shop which was even more powerful than Phoenix Immortal.

It focused on elixirs.

The Life and Death Elixir Workshop was connected to Phoenix Immortal. Wang Xian had seen the competition many times and it was extremely intense.

“This is?”

When Wang Xian walked over, he realized that regardless of whether it was the life and Death Elixir Workshop or Phoenix Immortal, there were a few beauties holding up signs at the entrance.

The price of the pills was written on the signs.

Was this a promotional battle?

At the entrance of Feng Xian’s elixir and weapons workshop, supervisor Yi, the shopkeeper, and the few middle-aged men were all at the entrance.

They looked at the life and Death Elixir Workshop at the side with a grim expression.

Wang Xian looked over with interest and smiled mockingly.

If not for their bad attitude, the pills he bought alone could support the entire business of Feng Xian in the entire Donghai city.

In the future, the entire business of star-moon kingdom might not even be possible.

Wang Xian walked straight to the location of the life and Death Pill Workshop.

Manager Yi and the shopkeeper standing at the door were unusually agitated.

A few days ago, the big shots behind the shop came to East Sea City to alleviate the crisis in East Sea city.

They brought a batch of medicinal pills and the results were indeed very good. In those two days, the number of customers was double that of the life and Death Pill Workshop.

However, what they didn’t expect was that the life and death medicinal pill workshop actually took out the same medicinal pills in less than three days.

Moreover, they even sold the prices even lower than theirs. This instantly caused their business to drop.

Helpless, they could only start a price war this morning.

However, with this kind of method, as the continent’s top medicinal pill workshop, how could they show weakness and immediately follow.

This gave them a huge headache.

What made them even more embarrassed was that the other party was preparing to hold the auction at the same time as them a few days later. Clearly, this was a deliberate attempt to suppress them.

After this matter appeared, even the few important figures who had come to the eastern sea were unable to resolve it. They could only report it to the higher-ups.

It was said that higher-ups with even higher statuses would come.

Thinking of the big shots who came to the shop, manager Yi and the shopkeeper had bitter faces. The disciples who came with the big shots chased away one of their distinguished guests!

“Sigh!”

Manager Yi sighed silently with a worried face. If the big shot who came again couldn’t solve the problem of East Ocean City, East Ocean City would be finished.

“Manager Yi, look, it’s him, it’s young master Wang!”

At this moment, the manager at the side said anxiously to her.

“Huh?”

Manager Yi immediately turned his head. When he saw Wang Xian heading straight for the life and Death Pill Workshop, his expression instantly turned ugly.

“Manager Yi, he went to the life and Death Pill Workshop!”

The manager said with an ugly expression.

“Let’s go over and apologize!”

Now that Feng Xian’s medicinal pills and weapons workshop had fallen to such a state, they would be able to do it even if they had to put down their attitude and try to win back a customer.

Not to mention, they were such a distinguished guest!

“Alright!”

The shopkeeper nodded his head. This matter was originally a problem for Feng Xian.

The two of them walked over immediately.

“Yes, manager Yi?”

A woman looked surprised when she saw them walking over directly.

“It’s the young man from that day!”

At this moment, a girl at the side looked at Wang Xian and sized him up from head to toe.

They didn’t expect that this young man was a customer who had spent 500 to 600 million on medicinal pills at Fengxian.

“Let’s go over as well!”

The woman exchanged glances with the few people beside her and walked over as well.
