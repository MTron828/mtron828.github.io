3329 3328 powerful grotto-heaven blessed land

“What’s going on?”

Wang Xian moved his palm and the grotto-heaven blessed land appeared in his hand.

At this moment, the blurry grotto-heaven blessed land was emitting a white glow. A clear map appeared in the middle of the map.

It was also an ocean basin, but this basin was not pitch-black. Instead, it was emitting a white glow.

As it was shown on the treasure map, Wang Xian did not know the exact situation.

“What’s the situation? A pitch-black basin, and now there’s a basin covered in white light? Things will always go against each other when they reach the extreme?”

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered slightly.

He looked at the route of the grotto-heaven blessed land and flew straight ahead.

“HMM? There are so many aquatic creatures!”

After flying for less than three minutes, Wang Xian suddenly sensed that there were more desolate beasts in the water around him.

It could even be described as a lot.

Each desolate beast was emitting a powerful aura. They were in groups, and the weakest among them was at least a level four universe knight.

Wang Xian hesitated for a moment and did not attack these desolate beasts. He continued flying forward.

There was a white light spot on the map of the grotto-heaven blessed land. The light spot was not very far away from him.

He did not know what was going on. Wang Xian was prepared to go over and check it out.

On the map, the white basin was not too far away from the white light spot. Of course, if Wang Xian were to fly, he would need one or two days.

He hid his body and flew towards the white light spot. Wang Xian realized that the deeper he went, the more dire beasts there were.

This sea area was at the same extreme as the previous location. It was dead silent and full of vitality.

The seabed was abnormally beautiful. There were all kinds of plants and many universe knight-level spiritual herbs and spiritual trees. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Wang Xian even saw a acquired spiritual treasure in the middle of a group of desolate beasts.

This place was simply a Holy Land.

“It should be because of that blessed land. Every blessed land will attract all kinds of powerful forces to fight for it. Naturally, it will also attract desolate beasts.”

He mumbled and avoided the desolate beasts one by one. He walked towards the location of the light spot.

There was a stone under him. The stone looked very ordinary. However, on the surface of this stone, it seemed as though a thin layer had been cut off.

The size of this layer was the same as the grotto-heaven blessed land in his hands.

He raised his eyebrows and placed the map on it.

Buzz

At this moment, the surrounding white light lit up and a teleportation formation appeared.

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly. The tai chi dragon coiled around him and announced that he had stepped into the teleportation formation.

The next moment, his figure appeared at the edge of a basin that was emitting white light.

A warm energy enveloped his entire body, making him feel extremely comfortable.

“This is?”

He looked at the spot in front of him with a look of excitement in his eyes.

The grotto-heaven blessed land. The basin that was emitting white light in front of him was the grotto-heaven blessed land.

Moreover, it was a grotto-heaven blessed land that was not occupied by other factions.

Standing at the edge, Wang Xian could sense a powerful light force. This force could clear his mind and increase his recovery ability tremendously.

At this moment, it was as if he had received a blessing. His entire body was in an extremely mystical state.

Wang Xian had even cut off his arm. He could recover immediately just by relying on this force of light.

“I have yet to enter the grotto-heaven blessed land completely, but I already possess such a powerful ability. What about in the depths?”

Wang Xian mumbled, his eyes filled with excitement.

He didn’t expect his luck to be so good.

A treasure map had brought him directly into this place.

This was simply giving him a grotto-heaven blessed land.

“That’s not right. Are there desolate beasts in the basin?”

At this moment, Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly. His dragon eyes flickered.

Waves of energy were injected into his dragon eyes. Wang Xian could vaguely see the situation inside.

In the basin, there were many desolate beasts that were emitting the power of light.

He did not know how strong these desolate beasts were, but they were definitely not weak.

“Hualala!”

At this moment, Wang Xian sensed movement coming from behind. He was slightly stunned and looked over.

More than a thousand figures were flying over quickly. When Wang Xian saw these figures, his eyes flickered slightly.

There were actually people who came here.

Furthermore, it was a faction.

There were more than 1,000 powerhouses. The weakest among them was a level five universe knight.

“There are powerhouses from the nine-candle demon race and another faction.”

Wang Xian thought to himself.

One of them was from the nine-candle demon race, and the other was from a human race.

However, this human race had a pair of bright wings on their back. They looked somewhat like the angel race, but they shouldn’t be from the angel race.

“HMM?”

When Wang Xian saw them, more than a thousand people who flew over also noticed him. The five powerhouses who were in the lead were clearly stunned. They were filled with astonishment.

Their eyes were fixed on Wang Xian as they sized him up from head to toe.

“Which race are you from? How did you barge into this place?”

The powerhouse who had a pair of bright wings looked at Wang Xian. His eyes flickered as he asked.

“Dragon Palace, which race are you all from?”

Wang Xian did not hide anything after hearing the words of the powerhouse with the bright wings. Instead, he asked them.

“Dragon Palace? Are you the Dragon King?”

The powerhouse with the bright wings was shocked when he heard what Wang Xian said.

Wang Xian did not reply. Instead, he looked at them.

“We are from the light race. They are from the nine-candle demon race.”

The leader of the light race said faintly.

“The light race?”

Wang Xian was slightly surprised when he heard his introduction.

The light race was a famous faction at the edge of the heaven-splitting primordial land. In terms of strength, they were probably second only to the corpse-wrapping race in the Lich Kingdom.

However, no one knew the exact strength of the light race. No one knew how strong the light race was.

The two major races had joined forces to come here. Who were they?

Wang Xian’s eyes were also flickering as he swept his gaze across them.

Among the 1,000 of them, there was a bloody smell on their bodies. It was obvious that they had come all the way here.

“Are you all here for this grotto-heaven blessed land?”

Wang Xian asked them.

“That’s right.”

The leader of the light race answered bluntly. He looked at Wang Xian warily and asked, “Dragon King, are you here for this grotto-heaven blessed land as well?”

“Yes.”

Wang Xian did not hide anything.

“What do you mean by that? Are you leaving now, Dragon King, or are we leaving?”

The leader of the light tribe narrowed his eyes slightly and said, “Or should we chase away the desolate beasts in the grotto-heaven blessed land first? After that, we will determine the victor.”

The light tribe and the nine-candle demon tribe did not underestimate Wang Xian. To be able to force the lich kingdom to such an extent, they also attached importance to the Dragon King.

“Hehe, suit yourself.”

Wang Xian’s gaze swept across the five in front of them, his eyes gleaming.

He was not afraid of the five universe knights and level eight powerhouses.
