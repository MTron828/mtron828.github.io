A yellow fruit appeared in Wang Xian’s hand. When Xiao Yu wiped off the perspiration on her face and saw the fruit, she was completely speechless.

“What? You went to get fruit for me?”

“Huh?”

However, Elder Fang, who was beside Xiao Yu, frowned upon seeing the fruit in Wang Xian’s hand.

“This isn’t any ordinary fruit. This is something your brother had to work an entire night to get for you!”

Wang Xian was speechless as he walked towards Xiao Yu with the spiritual fruit. “This is highly nourishing.”

“Tsk. You must be lying to me. All you like to do now is lie to me.”

Xiao Yu pouted and was clearly not convinced.

“This is...!”

Suddenly, excitement flashed passed Elder Fang’s eyes. She had a shocked expression and her exclaim was filled with disbelief.

“Oh? It seems like Elder Fang has recognized this fruit!”

Wang Xian smiled at Elder Fang.

Puff puff!

Elder Fang’s breathing was rapid. Her gaze was tightly fixed on the yellow fruit in Wang Xian’s hand as she mumbled, “Spiritual Bead takes a hundred years to turn green, five hundred years to turn red, a thousand years to turn orange and one thousand five hundred years to turn yellow. This... This... This is the fruit of a Level 4 Spiritual Beads Grass!”

Elder Fang explained and her body was shivering slightly.

She looked on in disbelief. She did not have a great understanding of spiritual medicine in general but was very clear about Spiritual Beads Grass.

The Thistles and Thorns Sect had paid a huge price to get a Level 1 Spiritual Beads Grass. At that time, she had gone to find out more information about Spiritual Beads Grass.

The fruits from the Spiritual Beads Grass were known as Spiritual Beads. Based on the difference in Level, the colors would be different too.

Fruits from a hundred-year grass, five hundred-year grass, one thousand-year grass and one thousand five hundred-year grass were green, red, orange and yellow respectively.

Based on the color of this fruit, it was clear that it was the spiritual bead of a Level 4 Spiritual Beads Grass.

She had not even seen a Level 3 spiritual medicine, let alone a Level 4.

“Rumor has it that for a peak Level 9 Martial Artist, he has a ten percent chance of advancing to Half-step to Inborn if he consumes a Level 4 Spiritual Bead. If he can gather the entire spiritual medicine, he would have a sixty percent chance of advancing!”

Ten percent might seem low but it was in fact very high for a Level 9 Martial Artist, let alone sixty percent.

Elder Fang’s face was turning a little red from excitement. This made her even more alluring. “The value of this Level 4 Spiritual Bead is similar to an entire city. Miracle Doctor Wang, how did you get it?”

“I did expend a lot of effort to get it,” Wang Xian smiled and replied. Seeing the shocked expression on Elder Fang, he felt a little proud of himself.

It was just something he created by skipping a night of sleep!

Hehe!

“Expend a lot of effort...” Elder Fang’s expression was interesting to watch. She really didn’t know what else to say. Getting a Level 4 spiritual medicine just because you have expended a lot of effort? This...

“Master, is this fruit really that awesome?” Xiao Yu opened her mouth slightly and asked in astonishment.

“This is a Spiritual Bead and isn’t an ordinary fruit!”

Elder Fang gritted her teeth. She felt that this pair of siblings was really strange. One managed to get a Level 4 Spiritual Bead after “expending a lot of effort” while the other asked if “this fruit is really that awesome?”

If it wasn’t because of her great mental qualities, she would probably be spewing blood.

“Level 4 Spiritual Bead couldn’t be bought with anything less than $700-800 million. Moreover, even if you have the money, you need to wait for the opportunity too. The frequency of the sale of Level 4 spiritual medicine might not even be once in an entire year throughout the Ancient Martial Arts circle,” Elder Fang explained.

“This... So expensive?” Xiao Yu’s eyes popped opened and were filled with disbelief.

“Yeah!” Elder Fang nodded her head solemnly. “More often than not, Level 4 spiritual medicine couldn’t be measured using money. Under most circumstances, there have to be exchanged with other objects!”

“Oh my gosh. It’s worth that much?”

Wang Xian was shocked too when he heard Elder Fang’s explanation. He had initially thought that the value of this fruit to be a few dozens of millions at the maximum. It was beyond his imagination that this would worth $700-800 million.

It seemed like he had underestimated the value of a Level 4 Spiritual medicine.

“What do you think? Xiao Yu, do you want to try a fruit that cost $700-800 million?”

Seeing Xiao Yu’s shocked expression, Wang Xian joked.

Xiao Yu swallowed her saliva and stared at the Spiritual Bead in her brother’s hand, which she had previously dismissed as just a normal fruit.

“Miracle Doctor Wang, Xiao Yu’s current cultivation level is a little too low. She wouldn’t be able to withstand the enormous spiritual energy in it. It’s better to wait for her to consume it after reaching Level 9!”

Elder Fang’s mouth twitched a little as she spoke.

“Can we just cut it into smaller pieces before eating?” Wang Xian was taken aback and asked inquisitively.

“That’s possible but a large portion of the energy of the Spiritual Bead would be lost,” Elder Fang said.

“It’s fine. Just cut it smaller and eat it. If Xiao Yu can’t finish it, Elder Fang, you can have some. Although it’s a little hard to get this, it is not impossible to get,” Wang Xian said nonchalantly and emitted the aura of a ruler.

Seeing how he could say those words calmly, Elder Fang was stunned and didn’t know how to respond at the moment.

Her Thistles and Thorns Sect had gone through mountains and seas just to get a Level 1 spiritual medicine to aid Xiao Yu in her cultivation training. In the end, Xiao Yu’s brother easily took out Level 4 spiritual medicine for Xiao Yu to waste.

This...

Can it be that it’s our Thistles and Thorns Sect that is too trash-like?

No, it’s this juvenile who is too insane.

Elder Fang looked at this mysterious and good-looking juvenile and started to go into a daze.

That’s a little beyond her imagination now!

Miracle Doctor Wang from the Old Street of Rivertown is definitely not that simple! She thought to herself and had a desire to demystify the aura around Wang Xian.

“Brother, you are really nice to me. I’m sorry for grumbling about you previously!”

Xiao Yu walked over, feeling touched.

“Haiz. All you have to know is that I’ve done all these things for you.”

Wang Xian smiled.

“However, if you are leaving next time, you still have to inform me. Otherwise, I’ll be calling the police!” Xiao Yu continued. Upon hearing her, Wang Xian’s face stiffened as he patted her head. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

At this moment, Elder Fang commented, “Let’s not let Xiao Yu consumes the Level 4 spiritual medicine. We can head to the auction today and see if we can get some Level 1 or 2 spiritual medicine for Xiao Yu!”

“Auction?” Wang Xian was taken aback slightly and looked at Elder Fang in doubt.

“Yeah. An auction organized by the Nine Stars Auction House. Nine Stars Auction House’s auction is a blend of Ancient Martial Arts and modern style. As long as you have the money, you can enter. They will be hosting an auction in the Southern Province this time. All the wealthy people and Ancient Martial Arts Sects in the surrounding two provinces will likely be sending their representatives over. The scale of this auction is pretty huge and would likely have lots of precious items.”

Elder Fang looked at Wang Xian as she explained.

“Oh? If I have something to put up for auction, can I leave it there for sale?”

Wang Xian raised an eyebrow. He only had approximately $30 million and less than one percent of the resources needed for the Dragon Palace had been gathered. It was time to get some money.

“It’s a little too late to sell it by consignment now. However, there’s a session after the auction that allows one to exchange items for items. Naturally, you could get money for your items. You can even save on the auction fees in this way. Consequentially, you might not be able to get a good price since you lack the publicity!”

Elder Fang explained to Wang Xian.

Wang Xian nodded his head and made up his mind.

“Brother, what are you selling?” Xiao Yu asked Wang Xian inquisitively.

“A few blood corals.” Wang Xian thought about it. That heart-shaped blood coral with the other corals should be able to fetch $100-200 million. However, it was still too little.

“And a Level 4 Spiritual Bead!”

As he spoke, he took out another yellow-colored Level 4 Spiritual Bead.

Elder Fang and Xiao Yu were instantly stunned.
