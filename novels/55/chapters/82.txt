Chapter 83: What’s the Gap?

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

“Sir, I would like to apologize on behalf of my staff. I’ll also answer to you.”

The manager made a bow to Wang Xian, apologizing before he turned to the salesgirl and inquired on the incident.

“Xiao Yu, come over,” Wang Xian beckoned her. “Which salesgirl despised you just now?”

“Brother, it’s nothing. She was just asking if we can afford it. If we can’t, then don’t bother to try it on.” Xiao Yu was slightly embarrassed when she repeated the incident again.

“Hehe, we can’t even try when we’re not buying?” Wang Xian sneered at the manager.

“Of course not. Those who walk into our shop are our customers. We’ll let customers try on the watches.”

The manager was looking woeful when he was being accused by Wang Xian. He looked at those salesgirls and asked coldly, “Who was the one who said no trying?”

“Manager, I... I thought they were...” The salesgirl whimpered as she tried to explain to her manager with a pale-looking face.

“Don’t explain to me. If all our staff behaved like you, could we even do any business? Who told you that customers cannot try on the watches?” The manager cut her off without any emotion. “Pack your things. Our store has no means to keep such an employee like you.”

“Manager, I... I’m in the wrong. Please give me a chance,” the salesgirl pleaded.

The manager frowned and looked at Wang Xian, who was watching everything with his impassive look as always. The manager gritted his teeth, “Cut your words and resign now!”

“What a snob,” said Wang Xian to the salesgirl emotionlessly.

The salesgirl looked over with a pale-looking face as she was filled with regret.

Just then, the other salesgirl packed the watch and said to Wang Xian, “Sir, your watch.”

Wang Xian nodded his head and took over the bag before he passed it to his sister.

“Take it. Everyone says girls need to be pampered when they are growing up. Even though you’re a grown-up now, it’s not too late now.”

Wang Xian smiled as he handed the watch to Xiao Yu. Then, he looked at Jia Wenrui and Jiang Shuang. “You think you’re rich and you can act snobbish? Heh, I didn’t want to say it, but you’re just brats. Many people are richer than you and your family.”

As he said this, he walked to Jia Wenrui and patted his shoulder, “Never mess around with my sister. You’re not qualified yet. If you don’t know what’s good for you, I’ll make sure the consequences are unbearable for you.”

After Wang Xian finished his sentence coldly, he turned to Xiao Yu and smiled. “Let’s go, Sister. We are still short on shoes. Oh, do you want to get a necklace? Shall we go and get one now?”

“No, Brother. Let’s go.”

Seeing her brother standing up for her, happiness and admiration crawled all over Xiao Yu’s face.

Her brother had always protected her like this.

In the past, he would beat up the people who bullied her. Now, it was even more interesting. If anyone bullied her, he would slam them with money.

“Let’s go. I have too many things in my hands. You’ll have to carry some of them later.”

Wang Xian carried the shopping bags and headed outside.

“How did... how did Xiao Yu’s brother become a rich man?” Gazing at their back views, a guy behind murmured in shock.

Jia Wenrui was looking sulky as his mouth twitched.

What Wang Xian had said just now was in outright contempt, humiliation for how he was behaving on the first story just now.

Yet, he did not dare to say anything. Since Wang Xian could take out $880,000 like a breeze for a watch, he could be someone formidable in the Rivertown.

He dared not rebuke as he was afraid Wang Xian would find someone to hurt him.

Jiang Shuang, on the other side, gazed at the back of Xiao Yu with jealousy.

Why? Why does Jia Wenrui detest herself and like Xiao Yu?

Why does she have such a formidable brother?

She took a glance at the watch she bought with heartache. Her face paled when she thought of the expensive watch Xiao Yu’s brother had bought without thinking. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

It was futile to make a comparison.

“Okay, Brother. We’ve got enough stuff. Everything is in.” After getting the shoes, they even bought a few sets of lingerie. Xiao Yu was carrying some shopping bags when she spoke to Wang Xian.

“Yes, everything, including the clothes, is in.”

Wang Xian pondered as he observed the things in his hand, “We’re still short a notebook, a phone, and another iPad. That should be done. Oh, Xiao Yu, what else do you need?”

“Gosh, my dear beloved brother. It’s enough. The computer and such...”

“You will get to use the computer. There’s an Apple store here. Let’s go.”

Wang Xian interrupted her and walked out on his own.

Xiao Yu looked at her brother and followed behind with a happy smile.

The gadgets were not expensive. A laptop, a phone, and an iPad cost only $30,000.

“Brother, we’re really done with the shopping. Let’s put these things in your dormitory, shall we?”

Xiao Yu smiled as she looked at Wang Xian, whose hands were full of shopping bags.

“I’ll get you girls a hotel. Let’s put the things inside and take a rest,” Wang Xian smiled and said.

“Alright, Brother.” Xiao Yu nodded.

Wang Xian looked around and fixed his gaze on the Summer Sun International Hotel, the hotel owned by Xue Family.

“Come on, follow me.”

As Wang Xian spoke, he took the lead in front and headed towards the Summer Sun International Hotel.

When Xiao Yu was at the entrance, she gazed at the hotel’s name and murmured, “Summer Sun International Hotel, 5-star hotel.”

If it were in the past, she would never allow her brother to let her stay in such an expensive accommodation. But now, she has seen how her brother behaved like a nouveau riche. Hence, she was adapting to it slowly.

“Babe, give me a presidential suite,” Wang Xian came to the reception desk and said to the receptionist.

“I’m sorry, Sir. Our Presidential Suites are all fully booked. Would you like to choose another room?” The receptionist apologized to Wang Xian.

“Brother, Xiao Mi and I can stay in a standard room. There’s no need for a Presidential Suite. Don’t waste your money.” Xiao Yu tugged his hand immediately.

“Fine. Just get me any room.”

Wang Xian nodded his head reluctantly. He took out the Family membership card that the Xue Family gave him and handed it to the receptionist.

When the pretty receptionist received the Family membership card, she was slightly stunned as she was shocked to see the Summer Sun membership card.

When she swiped the card on the machine, the computer immediately sounded off. “Welcome our distinguished members for the Family membership card. You’ll enjoy the best service in the hotel.”

The pretty receptionist was stunned while the other two receptionists popped over immediately. They were shocked to say, “It’s the Homeland Card; the most prestigious membership in the Summer Sun Hotel. Members will get to enjoy the best service in the hotel for free. Gosh!”

The pretty girl who was holding the card recovered from her shock. She immediately said respectfully, “Sorry sir. Our hotel has reserved a separate Presidential Suite dedicated to the members of the Homeland Card. I’ll take you there now.”

“Sure, thanks.” Wang Xian nodded.

“You’re welcome,” the pretty receptionist replied immediately.

Xiao Yu and Xiao Mi were staring at Wang Xian with surprise.
