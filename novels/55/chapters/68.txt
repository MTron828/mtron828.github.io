Chapter 69: First-grade Restaurant vs Longxuan Restaurant (1)

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

Days passed by, and soon it was only ten days left before the school reopened.

And one day before the Longxuan Restaurant opened for business.

“Director Wang, the things you wanted are ready!”

When Manager Huang saw the arrival of Wang Xian early in the morning, he was worried sick. He could not help but ask, “Director Wang, almost everyone in the Rivertown knows that the Longxuan Restaurant will be opening soon. Given the market responses, many people will turn up in their restaurant on the first day. How should we deal with this?”

“It’s okay. Make sure the things are ready!”

Wang Xian did not answer his question directly as he looked at the entrance with a smiling face.

These few days, Wang Xian got Manager Huang to prepare a few showcase boxes like those that could be seen in the market.

However, the showcase boxes that came with frozen storage were much more high class and exquisite.

The four showcase boxes were located on both sides of the entrance while a huge aquarium was situated in the center. However, there was no ornamental fish in the aquarium.

“It’s done. Director Wang. Look at all the imported equipment. They neither obstruct the visual nor the passageway,” said Manager Huang, frowning.

“Shuqing, have you printed out all our promotions?” Wang Xian asked with a smile.

“Yes, they are done. We can start our promotions anytime,” said Guan Shuqing with a grin.

“Great, I’ll get the people to move in the stuff in the afternoon!” Wang Xian nodded.

“Xiao Xian, are you confident in winning against the Longxuan Restaurant?” Guan Shuqing asked with some concerns.

“No problem.” Wang Xian nodded.

Seeing Wang Xian acting so secretively, both Guan Shuqing and Manager Huang did not ask anything further. All they did was wait quietly.

Longxuan Restaurant in the distance had already hung up huge red lanterns with fabulous decorations at the entrance.

Just on advertising and promotions alone, Longxuan Restaurant had spent millions in five days. With such a substantial investment in marketing, the results were visible. Some passers-by even made enquiries in the daytime today.

At three in the afternoon, an old man, together with six young men, walked in. The old man was burly while the rest of the young men exuded fearsome auras.

They were carrying things in their hands.

“Our operating hours start at 5 pm...”

“All of you are here. Move the things over here!” Wang Xian intercepted the receptionist when he saw Mo Qinglong and the Dragonians.

“Wang!” When Mo Qinglong saw Wang Xian, he quickly walked over and addressed him respectfully.

Wang Xian requested him to address him in this way. After all, addressing him as ‘Dragon King’ was way too high-profile.

And ‘Wang’ (aka ‘the King’) seemed like a shorter nickname Wang Xian.

“Bring the things over!” Wang Xian stood up and said.

Guan Shuqing, Manager Huang, and the rest of the chefs did not rest. They all stood up and checked out curiously. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“We’re ready!” Mo Qinglong waved to the rest of the six young men behind him.

“Put it in that showcase box!” said Wang Xian to them.

“Yes, Wang!” the rest of the young men nodded.

Two of the young men moved over a huge foam box with ice in it. They opened the box, revealing a fish in it.

The body size of the fish was about three meters long. It was beefy and sleek, flickering with silvery radiance.

“Atlantic Bluefin Marlin. It’s the Atlantic Bluefin Marlin!”

“Gosh! It’s an Atlantic Bluefin Marlin of at least 400 catties!”

“Such a huge and beautiful Atlantic Bluefin Marlin. This one is worth at least 3 million and above!”

The group of chefs standing around could not help but exclaim as they quickly surrounded the box in astonishment!

This was the best fish in the world – Atlantic Bluefin Marlin!

Yet, another box opposite them was already opened while they exclaimed. It was a yellowish of one meter, weighing around 100 catties.

“Chinese Bahaba fish. It’s the Chinese Bahaba fish!”

“The fish gelatine is just beside the Chinese Bahaba fish. That’s just huge!”

“Gosh, there’s another Chinese Bahaba fish!”

When the Chinese Bahaba fish was out, another round of commotion broke out from the surrounding chefs. Chinese Bahaba fish. It’s the Chinese Bahaba fish.

“Director Wang... Boss, you’re awesome. An Atlantic Bluefin Marlin and a Chinese Bahaba fish. Gosh!” Manager Huang exclaimed dumbfoundedly.

With these two top-graded fish, would the First-grade Restaurant be afraid of the Longxuan Restaurant? They did not seem to exist.

Guan Shuqing parted her lips slightly in astonishment as she looked at the expensive fish.

She had not even have a chance to eat such expensive fish before.

“What a huge abalone! Gosh, the abalones are huge!”

Just as everyone was staring at the Atlantic Bluefin Marlin and the Chinese Bahaba fish, the abalones were unloaded one by one.

Among which, a few of the palm-sized abalones drew surprising cries from the chef.

The chef pointed unbelievably at those abalones that were taken out from the box with eyes agape.

“This... One-headed abalone. One-headed abalone!”

“Gosh, this is incredible. Too incredible!”

When Wang Xian saw their reactions, he smiled. “Put the ornamental fish into the fish tank!”

“Yes, Wang!”

A young Dragonian nodded, opened the foam box, and stored the arowanas in it.

There was a total of nine arowanas, and each of them was about 80 centimeters long.

Precious Chilli Red Arowanas, noble Asian Arowana, Domineering Silver Arowana, Elegant Yellow Arowana, and Radiant Blue Arowana...

Each of the Arowana exuded a faint and imposing aura.

They were the top-graded arowanas. Definitely the ultimate top-graded arowanas.

Manager Huang stared unbelievably at those arowanas with eyes agape.

He was not an expert in arowana, but his ex-boss borrowed several arowanas some time ago. Those arowanas were said to be worth more than a million each.

But he was sure that those arowanas back then were far inferior to these arowanas here.

The nine arowanas were sweeping its body from left to right in the aquarium. Its domineering mightiness was fascinating!

“Just these arowanas would cost more than $10 millions of dollars? Manager Huang was a little stupefied.

Lastly, hundreds of lobsters were taken out, relieving the group of people who were still stunned.

Luckily, the last hundred lobsters were worth hundreds of thousands of dollars which were incomparable to the rest of the fish.

“An Atlantic Bluefin Marlin, Chinese Bahaba fish, two one-headed abalones, ten two-headed abalones... Bring out those Wild Giant Yellow Croaker which I caught some time ago, and put them in the showcase.”

Wang Xian looked at a chef impassively.

“Yes, Boss. I’ll get it!” That chef quickly rushed to the kitchen.

Soon, the 10 Wild Giant Yellow Croakers were in place.

The Chinese Bahaba fish and Atlantic Bluefin Marlin were situated on both sides of the door while the abalones were put beside the Chinese Bahaba fish. On the other hand, the Wild Giant Yellow Croakers were placed beside the Atlantic Bluefin Marlin.

Finally, the ornamental arowanas that were worth over $10 million were placed at the center position.

The shock on Manager Huang and the chefs’ faces did not subside.

Anyone who just walked into the shop would form an illusion that they were in a museum which housed the world’s best seafood. This was a “fish castle!”
