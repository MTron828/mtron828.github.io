3729 The Cub of the 3728 Space Beast

“So many resources. There are so many resources and treasures on a Planet?”

The Wizards who first entered the universe floated above a planet, their eyes burning.

A planet with so many resources was a drop in the ocean in the universe.

From this, it could be seen that the starry universe definitely had a huge amount of resources.

The other pinnacle races would soon receive the information, and they would use the communication compass to immediately send it out!

With so many resources and treasures, it was enough for them to take a risk.

“The great beings that have entered have sent news that the starry universe has a large amount of resources, and the resources on a planet are comparable to the collection of the weak and small high-level races. You can take the risk to enter.”

“Before entering, each of you has a communication stone plate. You can transmit information within this communication stone plate. In addition, if you discover a treasure and there are space beasts guarding it, you can tell this news to any peak race. If the treasure is obtained, the person who discovers it will receive 5% of the resources.”

“Or if it’s a treasure that satisfies you. Don’t worry, our peak races won’t kill people and steal treasures just because of some treasures.”

There were still a few powerful wizards who didn’t enter the Wizard clan.

After they received the news, they looked around and said directly.

This time, all the peak races didn’t hide anything from the high-level races.

There were two reasons. One was that the starry universe was a complete and powerful universe, and its area was very large. It wasn’t something that their peak races could explore in a short time.

The second reason was that the disciples of the other high-level races would be able to bring some information and find more treasure grounds.

In addition, they were very weak. The treasures that they could get their hands on were not worth the attention of the peak races.

Some precious treasures that they could not get their hands on could be reported to their peak races.

This could be considered a win-win situation.

“HM? Are there really many treasures?”

“I’ll say it again. The Lords of the pinnacle races don’t need to lie to us. If they want to find coolies, they can totally enslave us. Come, let’s go in!”

“Let’s go in!”

Some great beings pondered for a moment and immediately entered the inner space of the starry universe!

Soon, more and more great beings entered.

All the strong disciples knew that only by entering this place would they be able to obtain a huge opportunity.

Only then would they have the chance to step onto the peak of the universe.

…

Wang Xian didn’t know the location of the entrance to the starry universe. At this moment, Wang Xian was flying rapidly in the void.

At this moment, all the strong disciples from the Dragon Palace had also entered.

They flew towards the surroundings of the starry universe!

I Can’t be too fast. I have to be alert of my surroundings. If I encounter a powerful Cosmic Beast, my strength would be suppressed. It would be dangerous

Wang Xian thought to himself as he kept scanning his surroundings.

“There’s a planet over there!”

After flying for a few hours, a planet with life appeared in Wang Xian’s sight.

He moved his body and came to the surroundings of the planet. He observed it carefully.

This planet was similar to the previous one. It was filled with forests, oceans, mountains, and grasslands.

“Eh, that’s not right. The branches are moving again. They are moving even though there is no wind.”

However, Wang Xian soon noticed the high mountains on the planet.

The high mountains were exceptionally eye-catching. They towered into the clouds. On top of the high mountains, there was a group of special plants.

The plants were gray in color. At the top of a tall mountain, there was a branch swaying.

This branch was alive!

“It seems that some planets still have life.”

Wang Xian mumbled as he sized up this branch.

He realized that this branch was actually connected to all the surrounding mountain branches.

In addition, he also discovered a problem. The resources on this planet were not as much as the resources he encountered in the previous one.

In fact, there was not even half of it.

“Interesting. I can’t sense the strength of this branch. I can test it out.”

Wang Xian thought to himself. He waved his arm and the five elements millstone appeared in his hand. It fell directly toward the branch below.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

The branch seemed to have sensed some threat and aimed at the position of the Five Elements Millstone.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

When the five elements millstone approached, countless branches suddenly shot into the sky and attacked the five elements millstone.

“Huh?”

Wang Xian was slightly stunned. He waved his hand and a wave of energy landed on the five elements millstone. On the Five Elements Millstone, an azure dragon stretched out and attacked the branches directly!

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

However, the next moment, a scene that shocked Wang Xian happened.

The branches on the planet’s high mountain began to shake rapidly. Following that, Wang Xian realized that every part of the entire planet was shaking.

It was as though they had encountered a terrifying earthquake.

Following that, countless branches extended out from the planet. The densely packed branches were extremely terrifying!

It was a terrifying existence that was rooted in the planet.

“Eh? What’s Going On? Is this a space beast? A Wood Elemental Space Beast? Is He resting here? Or did this planet give birth to this space beast?”

Wang Xian was extremely astonished. However, these countless branches did not give him any sense of threat!

“Destroy it!”

He waved his arm and transformed into a flaming dragon claw. A terrifying flaming dragon claw clawed downwards!

“Pitter-patter!”

“Boom Boom!”

Then came the sound of a violent attack.

“Bzzz bzzz!”

And the countless branches, but also issued a strange sound.

“The five elements perish, die!”

This huge branch only possessed the combat strength of the peak of the venerable, much weaker than Wang Xian.

The power of a wipe-out swept past, a branch of the moment lost vitality.

Boom! Boom! Boom

The branches seemed to be feeling extremely hopeless as they trembled violently.

The entire planet shook violently as it cracked open slowly.

The planet had collapsed.

At the center of the cracked planet, a powerful energy was transmitted over.

At the core of the planet, a ball of green energy was gathered together.

The energy was filled with vitality and other unique auras. It was mainly wood-type with other unique energies mixed in.

“What is this?”

Wang Xian was astonished. He felt that this energy had a great effect on his cultivation.

“Could it be that the branch is a space beast that was born on this planet? Most of the energy and resources of the entire planet were absorbed by this Space Beast Cub?”

He guessed and the more he thought about it, the more likely it was.

The entire planet was like a mother’s womb, giving birth to a powerful and terrifying life form! T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

This was also the reason why the space behemoth had such a huge body and didn’t need the Kingdom of God.

“If that’s the case, I have to be more careful!”

Wang Xian thought to himself.
