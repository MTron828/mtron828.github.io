2857 2,857. We will definitely kill him! 2

“Wang Xian!”

Fourth senior sister stared at Wang Xian who was surrounded in the middle and shouted.

At the same time, she took out a communication stone plate without leaving a trace. She pressed it and kept it immediately.

She gritted her teeth and led the group of senior brothers and sisters into the room.

She could understand a little about the situation at a glance.

!!

However, her master had once instructed her to protect Wang Xian’s safety.

Now that they had met, she couldn’t just sit idly by.

Even if the other party’s strength wasn’t something she could contend against.

“Okay.”

When Wang Xian heard the voices from behind, he could also sense ye Lui Ying and the rest.

However, he didn’t expect them to actually dare to get involved.

One had to know that in the current situation, they were in deep trouble instead.

Of course, this was what Wang Xian was thinking from their perspective.

In Wang Xian’s opinion, the current situation could be resolved with a snap of his fingers.

“Wang Xian, are you alright? Why are there so many injuries on your body?”

Ye Lui Ying and the rest flew over. Looking at the bloodstains on Wang Xian’s body and his pale expression, they asked with concern.

“I’m Fine!”

Wang Xian shook his head lightly.

“Hehe, I didn’t expect you guys to have companions. It’s perfect. Kill them all one by one!”

The disciples of the eight barren sect surrounding Wang Xian did not stop ye Lui Ying and the rest from flying over. Instead, they looked at them coldly. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Since their companions had arrived, they had to pay the price together!

“Wang Xian, what happened?”

Fourth senior sister’s expression changed drastically when she heard the words of the mighty one from the eight barrens. She asked Wang Xian.

“It’s nothing. The disciples of the eight barrens saw that I was injured and wanted to snatch something from them. They killed them casually!”

However, his words made the faces of fourth senior sister, Ye Lui Ying, and the rest turn pale.

He killed the disciples of the eight barrens casually. This was breaking the sky!

“Wang Xian, stall for a while. Our master will be here soon!”

Fourth senior sister gritted her teeth and transmitted her voice to Wang Xian.

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz

As soon as fourth senior sister finished her sentence, one after another confinement rings attacked them.

With their strength, they couldn’t avoid the lock-on of elder bhang at all.

One after another, the confinement rings floated above their heads.

This made their hearts sink slightly.

“Capture all of them. If they dare to kill our disciples, we will make them pay ten times or a hundred times the price!”

Elder Zhou’s cold voice rang out.

“Wait, it was you people from bhang who coveted Wang Xian’s treasure first. That’s why we took Action!”

Fourth senior sister’s expression changed and she immediately shouted loudly.

“Regardless of the reason, since they dared to kill our disciples from bhang, they must pay the price!”

Elder lie said with a cold face.

“Boom! Boom!”

After he finished speaking, the disciples around him were ready to move!

“We Are Disciples of the Holy Region!”

Sensing the power around them, fourth senior sister paled and said directly.

“What?”

Hearing her words, elder lie and elder Zhou in front of them narrowed their eyes.

“Hehe, Holy Region, do you think that a disciple of the holy region who killed our disciples of the eight barrens will be able to escape this disaster?”

“Or do you think that our disciples will be afraid when they hear that you are holy region disciples?”

Elder Zhou’s face was cold as he stared at them.

“No, we just want to find out the truth.”

Fourth senior sister immediately shook her head.

The holy region was weaker than the eight barrens. She revealed her identity not to threaten the elders of the eight barrens, but to buy time.

She had to wait for her master to deal with this matter.

What she could do was to stall.

No matter what, the reputation of the saint realm was still useful. Elder eight barrens wouldn’t be as unscrupulous as before.

“Eh? They are disciples of the Saint Realm? The disciples of the saint realm killed the disciples of the eight barrens?”

“This… This isn’t a small matter. If we’re not careful, it might cause a dispute between the two forces!”

“I didn’t expect them to be saint-level disciples. They’ve suddenly collided!”

The seven or eight people who were watching were slightly shocked when they heard their words. Shock appeared on their faces.

This matter involved saint-level disciples, so it wasn’t a simple matter.

While they were conversing, some people rushed over. When they saw what was in front of them, they whispered to each other.

“It doesn’t matter how powerful you are. If you kill our disciples from the eight barrens, you will die. Even the saint realm is useless!”

Elder Zhou roared with a face full of killing intent.

“Our master will be here soon. When he comes, he will give you an explanation!”

Fourth senior sister’s expression changed slightly as she shouted loudly again.

“Master?”

The experts from the eight barrens narrowed their eyes slightly.

“Kill that kid first and capture the other four. Later, I want to see how the Holy Region will answer to us!”

However, what fourth senior sister and the rest didn’t expect was that elder bhang didn’t give them any time at all and gave them an order directly.

“Oh no!”

“Wang Xian, be careful!”

Fourth senior sister and the rest’s expression changed drastically as they hurriedly said to Wang Xian.

The reputation of the holy region was completely useless to the other party.

“F * ck, let’s see which one of you dares to touch boss Wang!”

However, all of a sudden, a slightly arrogant voice came from outside.

A figure flew straight towards them.

“Boss Wang!”

The person who came was invincible in terms of combat techniques!

He was also attracted by the distress signal from the surrounding area. The windless forest was not big.

Bhang loved this kind of lively battle style invincible. Naturally, he was very interested in this kind of thing and rushed over immediately.

However, when he arrived here, when bhang saw Wang Xian, he immediately became anxious.

The people of Bhang actually wanted to kill boss Wang. This was outrageous!

“Big Brother Invincible, don’t get involved in this matter!”

At the back, a few young men hurriedly spoke to bhang. Their expressions changed slightly as they had a bad premonition!

Tian Xin’s expression also changed slightly as she looked at the figure of invincible battle technique. She wanted to extend her hand to stop him.

This was related to the barren lands. It was not something that they could participate in, even if their background was very deep.

“What is invincible battle technique doing? Is he causing trouble? If he really causes trouble, even his master might not be able to settle it!”

The few middle-aged men behind Tian Xin spoke with a slightly ugly expression!

“Boss Wang!”

Invincible battle technique ignored the shouts behind him. He flew to Wang Xian’s side and shouted once again.

“Oh? What a coincidence!”

Wang Xian saw invincible battle technique and asked with a smile.

His expression was calm as if the situation before him had nothing to do with him.

“Hehe, boss Wang, this is fate.”

“Boss Wang, don’t worry. In my invincible battle technique’s territory, no one can bully you!”

Invincible smiled at Wang Xian as he spoke. He then turned his head and looked at bhang and the rest. He raised his head slightly and said, “What? My invincible boss is someone you can bully!”

“Invincible in battle!”

The elders of bhang frowned slightly when they saw invincible in battle.
