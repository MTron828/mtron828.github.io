Okay.

Tianci looked at Wang Xian, his eyes gleaming. “Uncle, Pll be leaving First! ”

“Let’s Go! ”

Wang Xian nodded at him and watched him leave.

Following that, Wang Xian’s mind stirred as he checked the condition of the ancestral tree.

Currently, there was a palm-sized branch on one of the branches of the main trunk of the ancestral tree.

This branch was filled with a sharp aura.

This branch came from the Divine Tree of Heaven’s origin creation in Tianci’s body.

The ancestral tree nurtured the divine tree of Heaven’s origin creation in Tianci’s body.

A few years ago, a branch was cut from it.

This branch had now grown to the point that it was no weaker than the Divine Tree of Heaven’s origin creation in Tianci’s body!

However, it was a cut from the divine tree of Heaven’s origin creation in Tianci’s body. It couldn’t be stronger than Tianci’s parent body.

However, as long as Tianci’s Heavenly Yuan creation true treasure didn’t resist the ancestral tree’s energy.

Then, the small branch on the ancestral tree had endless possibilities.

Of course, the ancestral tree didn’t forcefully take a screenshot of Tianci’s

Heavenly Yuan creation true treasure branch.

While it took it, it would give Tianci’s heavenly yuan creation true treasure energy.

It would also inject its own energy into his body.

This way, it would be of great benefit to the Heaven’s origin creation treasure in his body.

After all, both of them belonged to the Heaven’s origin creation level.

Both of them were of the wood attribute!

One of them belonged to the auxiliary attribute while the other belonged to the offensive attribute.

“Although this is not as good as directly obtaining this Heaven’s origin creation treasure, I can still obtain a lot of benefits.” Wang Xian smiled.

Wang Xian could still accept the current situation!

“Uncle, you’re here! ”

In the evening, Tianci’s voice sounded.

When Wang Xian heard it, he opened his eyes and walked out with a smile on his face.

In the courtyard, Mu Liyin c er had decorated it. It looked very beautiful.

Tianci’s grandparents and some people whom Wang Xian didn’t know.

There were more than ten of them in total, and there were a few young men and women among them!

“Young master Wang Xian, please sit here! ”

Mu Liyin ‘ER’s maid came up to him and said to Wang Xian.

Okay!

Wang Xian nodded his head.

In the courtyard, when the rest of the people saw Wang Xian, some of them had curious expressions on their faces.

Tianci walked over and held Wang Xian’s arm happily. He said in a low voice,

“Uncle, I beat that kid up this afternoon. He won’t dare to Scold Me Anymore! ” Alright.

Wang Xian smiled and patted his head. “In the future, if someone scolds you, you can challenge him. If you defeat him, he won’t dare to Scold You

Anymore!”

Tianci nodded his head and transmitted his voice to Wang Xian. “Hehe, uncle.

If I can use the wood attribute, I can defeat them with one finger. ”

“Keep a low profile. When the time comes, we will amaze everyone! ”

Wang Xian said with a smile!

Tianci nodded his head with a smile.

“Tianci is still on good terms with little brother as always!”

Mu Liyin’s father walked over from the side and said to Wang Xian with a smile!

“Maybe Little Tianci and I are fated.”

Wang Xian looked at the middle-aged man who was walking over and replied with a smile!

“Haha, it is indeed fated.”

The middle-aged man nodded with a smile.

“Tianci is too close to young master Wang Xian. As his mother, I’m a little jealous. However, I have to thank young master Wang Xian for teaching Tianci over the past hundred years. He has taught Tianci many things! ”

Mu Liyin’er also walked over and said with a smile!

She was indeed a little grateful to Wang Xian.Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

After all, Tianci didn’t have a father. Wang Xian was here to make up for the love of Tianci’s father.

Even though Wang Xian wasn’t Tianci’s father.

“Today is TIANCI’s birthday. You will be going to the Academy tomorrow. Do you have anything you want?”

The middle-aged man looked at tianci and asked with a smile.

Although he didn’t like the fact that Tianci was born, he was still his grandson.

Furthermore, the talent that he had displayed so far was very good. This made him accept this grandson who came out of nowhere.

“I don’t have a grandfather. I don’t have anything I need.”

Tianci thought for a moment and shook his head. He suddenly looked at his mother. “Mother, I do have a wish.” As he spoke, his eyes shone.

“Oh? Tianci, what is your wish?”

Mu Liyin’er smiled at Tianci and asked. “Then, mother, Will You Promise Me First?” Tianci continued to speak to Mu Liyin C er. “Okay, okay. You’re the oldest today. Pll Promise You Anything!”

Mu Liyin ‘er smiled and patted his head.

“Then let uncle be my father, okay?”

Tianci looked at Mu Liyin ‘er and said with anticipation!

His words made Mu Liyin ‘er slightly stunned, and then her face turned slightly red!

However, she quickly ran her fingers through her hair.

“Silly child, this doesn’t mean that I agree to it. If you want to take me as your uncle, you also need my permission. If I agree to it, I will naturally agree! ” Mu Liyin ‘er pointed at Tianci’s head!

“Uncle, can you do it? Can you do it? This way, you will be my father in the future and no one will criticize me! ”

Tianci looked at Wang Xian and asked happily!

Wang Xian looked at Tianci and then looked at Mu Liyin’er.

When he saw her nodding at him with a smile, Wang Xian nodded his head.

“Alright, Alright. In that case, you can call me foster father from now on. I have watched you grow up! ”

Wang Xian didn’t reject and nodded his head as well.

Tianci had watched him grow up.

It didn ‘t matter if Tianci was his foster father!

“That’s great! That’s Great! ”

Tianci shouted happily!

“Tianci, when you go to school in the future and we are not around, I will get an uncle to follow you. He is my younger brother! ”

Wang Xian looked at tianci and transmitted his voice to him.

He didn’t say it out loud!

Following that, Wang Xian waved his arm and the unicorn ox appeared at the side!

In the past, tianci would be able to sense Wang Xian and the rest and wouldn’t encounter any danger.

Now that he was about to go to school, Wang Xian got the unicorn ox to follow Tianci just in case.

In addition, Tianci had the strength of a peak immortal godly king.

The Ultimate Treasure of Tianyuan in his body had been greatly improved.

Two more branches with concealed energy had grown.

One could be used to hide the Lin Niu.

Wang Xian had one too!

The last one was naturally to hide his own condition.

“woo woo! ”

After the Lin Niu appeared, he let out a low growl. His gaze was slightly heated as he stared at tianci.

He knew Tianci very well.

This was a heavenly yuan destiny treasure that had just been born.

Lin Niu followed by his side. With the growth of the Heavenly Yuan Destiny Treasure, Lin Niu was also able to absorb some of the Heavenly Yuan Destiny

Treasure’s energy and aura.

From there, he could obtain many benefits.

Even if he had to be Tianci’s mount for a period of time, he would be happy!
