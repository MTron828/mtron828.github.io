“I’m not your match, so I can only let my wife Take Action!”

Wang Xian’s leisurely voice was heard. As he spoke, he looked at Lan Qingyue with a smile on his face!

Around them, the third prince, Qing Jiang, Shui Fenghuang, and the rest were also slightly stunned when they heard Wang Xian’s words.

They looked at Wang Xian with some astonishment.

Faced with their trump cards and strength, how could the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace still be able to talk and laugh?

How could he be so calm?

What trump cards did he have?

And let his wife fight?

They looked at Lan Qingyue, their eyes full of surprise and doubt.

Did the Dragon King really have a trump card?

“The Dragon King still has a trump card?”

“The Dragon King can still laugh when facing such a terrifying trump card and lineup of the Angel clan and the Phoenix clan. What other trump cards does he have? Let his wife fight?”

“What’s going on? I’m no match for you guys, so I can only get my wife to make a move? That Lady doesn’t seem to be very strong.”

“Isn’t that the Dragon Queen of the Dragon Palace? I know about this. There are many Dragon Queens in the Dragon Palace. Back then, they all made an appearance at important occasions in the Dragon Palace. I’ve seen them before. This is one of the Dragon Queens!”

In the surrounding area, some of the strong disciples from the high-level races looked at Wang Xian in shock.

How could he be so calm under such circumstances?

Furthermore, there were people who recognized Lan Qingyue!

Lan Qingyue and the rest from the Dragon Palace would sometimes appear at important occasions in the Dragon Palace when some high-level races came to pay their respects to the Dragon Palace.

Some of the strong disciples from the high-level races recognized Lan Qingyue!

“Huh?”

The experts from the peak races were astonished when they heard Wang Xian’s words. They immediately shifted their gaze to Lan Qingyue.

The Dragon Queen of the Dragon Palace, the wife of the Dragon King. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

She was the Dragon King’s greatest trump card?

This? ?

They found it hard to believe.

Could there be someone stronger than the Dragon King in the Dragon Palace?

One had to know that the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace must have obtained the strongest inheritance of the Divine Dragon Clan. How could there be someone stronger than him in the Dragon Palace?

Lan qingyue smiled when she saw Wang Xian looking at her!

She took a step forward and swept her gaze across all the powerhouses of the Angel clan and Phoenix clan. She raised her head slightly!

“Let me introduce myself, Dragon Queen of the Dragon Palace!”

Lan Qingyue said slowly.

All the powerhouses of the Phoenix clan and Angel clan around saw Lan Qingyue, who was calm, composed, and even a little arrogant. She did not put them in her eyes at all. They suddenly had a bad premonition in their hearts!

“The last inheritor of the ancient god Kun feeding master.”

“Lan Qingyue!”

Another two words gently came out of her mouth.

At the same time, a gray energy surged out of her body. This energy was strange, but it contained Great Terror!

“Little Blue!”

“Little House!”

“Little White!”

She continued to speak with a smile on her face. She lightly waved her arms to the left, right, and front!

“Buzz, Buzz, Buzz!”

In the next moment, under everyone’s shocked expressions, three terrifying black holes appeared in the air above the long trading corridor.

Three extremely terrifying black holes appeared out of thin air around the encirclement of the Angel clan and the Phoenix clan.

These black holes appeared out of nowhere!

They were incomparably deep!

“Wu Wu Wu!”

“Wu Wu Wu!”

“Wu Wu Wu!”

In the next second, roars came from the black hole.

The roars were distant, empty, and ancient.

It seemed to be a terrifying existence from the center of the universe.

It seemed to be a terrifying existence that had transmigrated here!

“F * CK, F * CK, F * ck, the ancient god feeds Kun master, it’s the ancient god feeds Kun master, it’s Kun, that’s Kun!”

At this moment, a divine tiger at the seventh stage ruler realm from the Divine Tiger Clan suddenly roared loudly, his face filled with disbelief.

“How is this possible? How is this possible? Wasn’t the last ancient god Kun-master destroyed by our Divine Tiger clan, Phoenix clan, and Divine Dragon Clan? How can it still exist?”

He widened his eyes and continued to roar.

“Ancient god Kun-master?”

Some experts of the peak races were slightly dazed when they heard the voice of the Divine Tiger Clan’s expert!

“What is the ancient god Kun Sovereign?”

“I don’t Know? But from that Lord Divine Tiger’s exclamation, this is definitely a terrifying existence.”

“Bullsh * t, how can it not be terrifying?”? Didn’t this Lord Divine Tiger say that the last ancient god Kun sovereign was killed by them working together with the Phoenix race and the Divine Dragon Race? How could an existence that requires three peak races to work together be an ordinary existence?”

“F * ck me, I feel like there’s a terrifying existence coming out from that deep black hole!”

The group of high-level race’s expert disciples were somewhat dumbstruck!

Somewhat shocked!

Somewhat inconceivable!

It was the first time the ancient god Feeding Kun master and the others heard it.

But just hearing this name made them feel extremely awesome!

Ancient God?

Feeding Kun master?

“Weng Weng Weng!”

At this moment, three extremely huge figures slowly appeared from within the three black holes.

Little Blue and little white!

They had the strength of a level 5 ruler, and without the suppression of the starry sky, they were comparable to a level 8 ruler.

Their enormous bodies gave people a strong impact.

Everyone felt the sky darken!

Each figure was bigger than the long corridor they were in.

What kind of concept was this?

F * ck!

This was too crazy!

“These three terrifying beasts are called Little Blue? Little House? Little White? How are they small?”

The ELF race experts couldn’t help but mutter.

This was too big!

“I remember now. The ancient god raised the Kun Lord. The Kun they raised used to feed on the divine dragons, phoenixes, and Divine Tigers. There are records of it too. The Kun also devoured our demon race experts to increase its strength by devouring peak races. It was an extremely terrifying existence. However, after a very long time, it was destroyed by the Divine Tigers, Phoenixes, and divine dragons. I didn’t expect it to appear again.”

A demon expert’s eyes flashed with shock as he spoke!

“Feeding on the peak races, I’m F * cking… Scared to death!”

“Ruthless, too ruthless!”

The high-level race’s disciples opened their mouths slightly when they saw this!

This was too fierce, this was the first time they had heard of it.

“Is this the Dragon Palace’s Trump Card? The angel race and Phoenix Race’s experts are going to suffer. The angel race and Phoenix race are going to suffer as well!”

An elder from the saint bloodline murmured with a feather fan in his hand.

“Cough, cough. Everyone, pay attention. The royal family’s defense can at most block the attack of an eighth-level ruler. If a big fight breaks out, our defense might collapse. Be careful!”

At this moment, an expert from the royal family suddenly warned.

All the disciples of the high-level races? ? ?

This? ? ?

What did he mean? ? ?

If their defenses were destroyed, wouldn’t they be finished?

Just the aftershocks of a battle between experts of this level would definitely kill them.

Royal Family, don’t scare us!

“Actually, there’s no need to worry too much. From the looks of it, the angel race and Phoenix race will be completely suppressed. It Won’t be a big problem for us to hide.”

At this moment, the royal clan’s expert said leisurely.

He led the entire trading corridor and the stars to retreat into the distance.
