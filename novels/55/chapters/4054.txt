“Agar heaven! ”

Seeing that agar heaven demon god was blocking Wang Xian and Liu Lan ‘s attacks, he used both his hands to eat the huge axe and slashed at them!

The Sword and Magic Universe was mainly based on sword techniques.

However, due to the huge axe in his hands, he gave up on using his previous sword techniques.

This was because this huge axe was also an extremely powerful treasure.

He was the one who found the weapon from the Chaos!

Although hopeless heaven did not possess the ability to go berserk, his expression was extremely violent at this moment!

This was a good opportunity for him to take revenge!

The huge axe in his hand slashed towards the Asgardian demon god! A dazzling golden ray of light slashed towards the Asgardian demon god!

“Ahhhh!”

The Asgardian demon god blocked Wang Xian’s and Liu Lan’s attacks consecutively. When he saw Wang Xian’s huge axe attack, his expression changed drastically!

His wings were directly blocking in front of him!

He could only use his own defense and his own body to block it!

Now, facing Wang Xian’s and Liu Lan’s attacks, he could only block two of them at most!

And this was in a berserk state!

This was also the reason why he was able to block two existences of the same level by himself back then.

It was also the reason why he dared to be so arrogant just now.

As long as he put up a fight, he would be able to block them.

If he was really in danger, Liu Lan and Wang Wangtian would not be able to block him even if he were to run for his life!

However, it was different now!

In his berserk state, he was able to withstand the attacks of Wang Xian, Liu Lan, and the rest. He had used up all the energy he could muster during this period of time.

In the face of Wang Xian’s attacks, he could only use the strength of his physical body to withstand them head-on!

Wang Xian’s huge axe slashed onto the body of the Agar heavenly demon god, causing cracks to appear on the bones on his wings!

The bones started to crumble!

His body was also sent flying backward, and fresh blood was flowing out!

“Dragon Tomb! ”

At this moment, Wang Xian rushed over. An incomparably huge dragon tomb appeared out of thin air behind the Asmodian God!

The Shadows of the Divine Dragons grabbed towards his body, wanting to grab him into the dragon tomb and kill him completely!

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

Agartian roared, and the eyes of the demon gods appeared around him. The eyes of the demon gods collided with the Phantoms of the Divine Dragons!

“Bang! Bang! Bang!”

The Dragon Tomb slowly cracked open!

“Forbidden spell, water in the sky, purify everything! ”

Liu Lan roared, and the staff in his hand floated in the sky!

The book of forbidden water spells above his head began to shine!

A dark cloud appeared in the sky above Aggar, and a stream of water fell towards him!

This stream of water contained a terrifying destructive power.

It seemed to be able to pierce through everything!

“Demon God’s Claw, Tear! ”

Aggar saw Liu Lan’s attack instantly descend, and he roared furiously.

He stretched out his demonic claws and clawed at the dark clouds in the sky!

Rip

His terrifying claws tore through space. “Die, die, die, die!”

Wang Xian’s furious Roar continued!

He flew in front of agar once again!

The huge axe in his hand slashed once again!

He was exhausted from defending!

At this moment, Agar was completely exhausted from defending against Wang Xian, Liu Lan, and Wang Xian’s attacks!

One terrifying attack after another!

Each attack had the power to destroy the world.

With his full strength, he could defend against one or two of them, but he definitely could not defend against three!

After all, Wang Xian and the rest’s attack power was not lower than his!

“Run, run, run! We have to run! ”

The Asgardian demon god saw the attacks from Wang Wangtian and roared furiously in his heart!

“Bzzz bzzz! ”

Instantly, clones appeared around him. There were more than 10,000 clones!

Hopeless Sky’s attack landed on Asgard’s body once again.

This time, many of his bones were broken again. A terrifying axe mark was left on his body!

His body was also rapidly sent flying!

However, the moment he was sent flying, his figure entered the tens of thousands of avatars!

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

The tens of thousands of avatars turned into streams of black smoke and fled in all directions!

“This one! ”

Wang Xian growled when he saw that the Asgardian demon god was trying to escape!

“Water forbidden spell, heavy water thousand twist! ”

Wang Xian did not hesitate at all. The book of water forbidden spell floated in front of him and immediately released a water forbidden spell!

Streams of water appeared in the sky and below.

The streams of water formed a huge pattern and resonated with each other from top to bottom!

Following that, countless streams of water flowed towards a wisp of black smoke!

“Roar! Damn Dragon God, how did you discover me?”

Agar’s demonic God’s body was locked onto. His face was filled with rage,

Fury, and a hint of fear!

This escape move of his was actually broken by Wang Xian!

How did he break it?

“Hehe, how can it be so easy to escape? You have just broken through to the Heaven’s origin creation stage and you are already so arrogant?”

Wang Xian stared at Agar’s demonic god. His face was filled with a cold expression!

He possessed the incorporeal holy wings and the ability to search for enemies in the void!

Now that the nine attributes had fused, every strike of Wang Xian contained the ability to search for enemies in the void!

It was extremely easy to identify the location of his real body!

Countless streams of water were swirling around him and killing him!

Good!

“Blood boiling, explode!”

Liu Lan’s eyes glowed when she saw Wang Xian locking onto the Asgard Celestial Demon. She pointed the staff in her hand forward.

Droplets of water fell towards the Asgardian demon god!

Scram! Scram! ”

The Asgardian demon god revealed a look of fear when he saw the continuous attacks!

Some of the bones on his wings were broken and turned into a terrifying blood-red blade-like attack. It attacked in all directions!

It was an indiscriminate attack!

This move was equivalent to injuring 1,000 enemies and damaging 800 of himself!

He was already going all out!

He knew that if he did not go all out, he might really be killed today!

He had just broken through to the Heaven’s origin creation realm today!

He had just lived his second life!

Was he going to be killed just like that?

He could not accept it.

However, at this moment, he could only go all out when faced with such a situation!

He could only fight to the death.

He was no match for Wang Xian and the other two. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

He didn’t even have the qualifications to fight.

Arrogant. This time, he was too arrogant.

He didn’t expect that there would be an expert like Wang Xian in the sword and Magic Universe.

“Agatian, even if Pm severely injured today, I, Wang Wangtian, will kill you! ”

When hopeless sky saw this terrifying attack, he was not afraid at all.

He was wearing a golden armor that covered his entire body. He was completely prepared to take Agatha’s attack head-on! He was completely prepared to exchange injuries for injuries.

Not only was Agatha willing to risk his life.

He was also willing!
