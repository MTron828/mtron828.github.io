Chapter 49: Summer Sun Resort

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

“I’m drop-dead handsome!”

The next morning, Wang Xian stood in front of the mirror, looking refreshed after a bath. Looking at himself in the mirror, he was pleased.

While fiddling with his hairstyle, his phone suddenly rang.

Wang Xian spun around and picked up his phone quickly. When he saw Guan Shuqing’s number, a smile surfaced on his face.

“Hello, Pretty Guan!” Wang Xian squinted his eyes and said.

“Have you woken up?”

“Yes, where are we going? Do you need me to pick you up?” Wang Xian said with a smile.

“No, I’ll be going with the annoying guy. Oh, I forgot to tell you yesterday that you’re acting as my boyfriend today. Do you have any issues with that?”

“No, I’m sure.”

Wang Xian chuckled. He had a sleepless night as he was thinking of what Guan Shuqing meant by what she said yesterday.

He was rather into Guan Shuqing.

But he was neither someone who could chat with girls easily nor the proactive type. Otherwise, Qi Chuchu, whom he had been working together with, would have become his girlfriend.

Wang Xian did not put much thought into this, but that did not mean that he did not have the desire.

Now, he was fired up after Guan Shuqing tempted him.

“I’ll send you the address. See you then!”

Guan Shuqing hung up after talking to him. Soon after, an address was sent to his WeChat.

“Guan Shuqing is back to herself today. That’s odd. Women are always unpredictable.”

Wang Xian shook his head. He knew Guan Shuqing must have encountered some problems. Otherwise, she would not have said such a thing yesterday.

However, he still remembered that she promised to marry him if he earned $50 million. That was not a difficult task for the present Wang Xian.

“Hur? Summer Sun Resort? Isn’t that the property of Xue Jing and his family?”

Upon seeing the address sent by Guan Shuqing, Wang Xian was taken aback by surprise.

“What a coincidence.”

Wang Xian laughed as he headed outside. He rode to the old street and had his breakfast before he rode off to the Summer Sun Resort.

When he arrived at the Summer Sun Resort, it was only about 9 am. He came to the car park at the entrance and parked his motorcycle there.

“Should I tell Xue Jing?”

Wang Xian hesitated. After some considerations, he decided to let it go to avoid unnecessary troubles. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

He put the keys back in his pocket and headed to the entrance.

“Kite, don’t run, stop!”

At this time, Wang Xian heard a shout and a cheerful cry from a kid behind him.

“I want to play!”

A kiddish voice was heard, and Wang Xian felt someone knocking into him and hugging his leg from behind.

“Watch out, watch out!”

Wang Xian turned around and saw a little boy hugging his thigh nervously.

“I’m sorry that I knocked into you. I almost fell too.”

As Wang Xian turned around, the little boy lifted his head and looked at him shyly.

“It’s all right.” Wang Xian looked at the cute and well-mannered boy, he could not help but to rub his head.

“Little Kite, why are you running so fast? Wait for your Dad and Grandpa.” A middle-aged man and an elder walked out from a campervan. Along with them were two young men who looked like bodyguards in suits.

“Grandpa, Dad. Let’s hurry up and play.” The little boy released Wang Xian’s leg and continued to run inside.

“You rascal.” The middle-aged man sped up his pace and chased after him. He caught him in his arms, “Listen to me. Stop running.”

“Don’t run, don’t run.”

Following behind, the old man came along with a cane.

Wang Xian smiled when he saw the cute little boy staggering as he ran. Then, Wang Xian headed for the resort.

“Brother Qin, Old Qin.” At this time, another middle-aged man greeted them at the entrance.

Isn’t he the father of Xue Jing, Xue Jiahua? Wang Xian was a little surprised to see the middle-aged man.

As Xue Jiahua was ushering the three people, he also saw Wang Xian. He was slightly taken aback before he walked over, “Benefactor Wang Xian.”

“Just call me Wang Xian.” Wang Xian chuckled at the way he addressed him.

“Sure, are you here for leisure?” asked Xue Jiahua with a smile on his face.

“Yes, I came here to look around.” Wang Xian nodded.

“Why don’t I get Xiao Jing to accompany you around?” answered Xue Jiahua hurriedly.

“No, it’s okay. I have to wait for my friend. Mr. Xue, you can ignore me.” Wang Xian smiled as he declined.

“Sure, then I shall not bother you anymore. Enjoy yourself and let us know if you need anything.” Xue Jiahua nodded hurriedly.

“Alright.” Wang Xian nodded and headed inside.

Xue Jiahua watched as Wang Xian entered. With a slight hesitation, he fished out his phone and texted his son to entertain Wang Xian eventually.

“Brother Xue!”

Just then, the middle-aged man, not far away, knit his eyebrows and called out for Xue Jiahua with the little boy in his arms.

Just now, Xue Jiahua was supposed to greet them, but he cast them aside when he saw a young man. Such a way of doing things was impolite.

However, they did not say anything. After all, they were here to ask for a favor.

“Old Qin, Brother Qin, I’m really sorry.” Xue Jiahua quickly responded to his calling by walking over quickly.

In Rivertown, not many people were qualified for him to greet them personally. Old Qin was exceptional. Qin Family was much more influential than Xue Family. Hence, he did not dare to be a poor host.

“I’m really sorry. Just now, I met my benefactor. So I had to greet him personally.” Xue Jiahua explained with apologies.

“Oh? A benefactor?” The middle-aged man looked at the figure in front of him with curiosity.

“Never mind, I heard that Old Xue not only regained his health, but he also made some improvements. I’m here to check on him.” Old Qin shook his cane, not minding at all.

“Sure, Old Qin. My father is waiting inside. This way, please!”

Xue Jiahua looked at the little boy in the arms of the middle-aged man. Naturally, he knew the purpose of Old Qin to come personally over here. Hence, he quickly led the way.

Summer Sun Resort is quite a posh place.

An usher was leading in front of him as Wang Xian observed the surroundings with slight surprise.

The entire resort was luxurious, surrounded by rockery, streams, and a few trails. There were streams of crystal-clear water on both sides of the road with a myriad of fish swimming in it.

Refined and posh-looking housing could be found ahead. Summer Sun Resort was situated near the sea. He could vaguely see the beach that was full of various activities like surfing.

Not only that, there was a small restaurant on the sea with several tourists having their beverages.

Surrounding the resorts were tall trees which made the place beautiful. There were some ponds with crystal-clear water too.

The entire place was relaxing, and the environment was elegant.

“It’s a five-star resort indeed. The environment is really awesome,” Wang Xian exclaimed softly.

“Sir, if you are waiting for your friends, you can rest in the waiting area for the time being.”

The usher brought Wang Xian to a waiting area.
