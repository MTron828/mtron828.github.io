Chapter 1548: Above the 1548 chosen ones

Madman!

Madman!

This priest Wang was completely a madman!

He directly attacked Young Master Tian and young master di.

He completely disregarded the face of the Crown Prince of Wuqing City!

This guy was simply crazy!

The crown prince of Wuqing City had just said that no one was allowed to make a move in his territory, or else he wouldn’t give him face.

In this place, even young master Tian and young master di did not dare to disobey the words of the crown prince of Wuqing City. Neither of them dared to slap his face.

However, now, Wang Xian had made a move right after Wuqing City had said so!

This was simply a slap to the face of the crown prince of Wuqing City.

He did not give the crown prince any face at all. It was a hard slap to the face!

He had angered the solipsistic sect and now he had provoked the Wuji Empire. In this vast region, if he was not a madman, what else could he be?

“You’re courting death. No one can save you today!”

When young master Tian and young master di saw that Wang Xian was going to attack him directly, a powerful aura of the third level of the Seethrough realm erupted from their bodies instantly.

An aura of the solipsistic sect was completely emitted.

Those who were close to them hurriedly retreated.

When Wu Qingcheng heard Wang Xian’s words, his face instantly turned black.

A slap to the face. It was a blatant slap to the face.

What he said earlier was to prevent the two of them from attacking each other. However, he had forgotten about Wang Xian and his reaction.

He had forgotten how Wang Xian, who was a peerless genius, would react.

Now that he saw Wang Xian attacking him directly, his expression changed. His face turned dark and the corner of his mouth twitched.

He had already decided not to offend Wang Xian. Now that he had been slapped in the face, he could only stay close to him.

“Die!”

Young Master Tian and young master di’s voice was heard.

Both of them stared at the bright arm that Wang Xian had released. They waved their arms that were filled with killing intent.

An incomparably huge green palm attacked the arm of light effortlessly.

“Bang!”

However, the moment the arm of light collided with the wind attribute palm, the two palms seemed to have been cleansed.

The arm of light was not hindered in the slightest. With an even faster speed, it attacked towards the two young masters of Heaven and earth.

“Wha...”

“Cough Cough Cough!”

Seeing the moment the palm dissipated and the arm of light attacking them, the two of them revealed terrified expressions.

Before they could finish their words, the arm grabbed their necks and lifted them into the air, coughing.

“What?”

“How is this possible?”

“Oh my God, this is...”

Before Young Master Tian and young master di could finish their words, everyone around them had incredulous looks on their faces as they cried out involuntarily.

What kind of situation was this? How was this possible?

Instant Kill. One of the three great superpowers of the vast region, the lone sect, the two most monstrous and powerful heaven’s chosen disciples of the current generation were actually instant killed!

Without the slightest ability to resist, they were held by the necks of two bright arms and hung in the air.

Especially since the one who attacked was a young man.

This was impossible!

Unbelievable!

Everyone’s mouth was slightly agape and their bodies were trembling. Some of them even rubbed their eyes fiercely.

They were one of the top five heaven’s favorites in the entire vast region!

When Wu Qingcheng saw this scene, he swallowed a mouthful of saliva and a bitter expression appeared on his face.

“Brother Wang Xian, don’t kill me. Give me some face!”

Wu Qingcheng immediately shouted at Wang Xian with a pained expression.

He was really afraid that Wang Xian would kill the most outstanding heaven’s favorite of our sect right here and now!

At that time, even if he didn’t make a move, he wouldn’t be able to get away with it.

“Don’t worry, I won’t kill them. However...”

Wang Xian nodded his head at Wu Qingcheng indifferently as he looked at the two people in the sky and on the ground whose necks were held by Guang Ming’s arms. Their faces were flushed red and they were in disbelief.

“Don’t you guys want to know my strength and background?”

He looked at the two of them and asked faintly.

“Cough, cough!”

The two of them were floating in the air and staring at Wang Xian. They were completely unable to speak after being held down by the powerful force of the arm of light. A look of shock slowly appeared in their eyes that were filled with disbelief.

“Put our senior brother down. Otherwise, our sect will not let you off!”

In the surroundings, all the disciples of the sect finally snapped out of their daze. With an extremely embarrassed expression, they shouted at Wang Xian sternly.

“Shut up!”

Wang Xian swept his gaze across the people surrounding him and waved his arm gently.

In the sky, he held down the arms of the two people in the sky and ground. Together with their bodies, they swept towards the people surrounding him.

The speed was so fast that they didn’t even have time to react!

“Ahhhh!”

Screams came from the surroundings. Among them were the screams of young master Tian and young master di.

At this moment, their faces were covered in blood under the powerful collision.

Their pathetic bodies didn’t look as high and mighty as before!

Even a few of their teeth were missing.

Was he the supreme?

Was he high and mighty?

How could he still have any imposing manner!

Everyone from the Bingxin Empire and the solipsistic sect who surrounded Wang Xian was sent flying.

It was a miserable scene!

Gulp

All the disciples from the surrounding factions gulped and looked at this scene in astonishment.

If they didn’t hear wrongly, the crown prince of Wuqing City had addressed this priest Wang as brother Wang Xian.

He even said that he would give me some face.

They had a vague guess that the prince of Wuqing City might know this priest Wang and understand some of his strength.

This young man’s strength might even cause the crown prince of Wuqing City to be a little apprehensive.

Fourth level of the void interpretation stage, or even higher? RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Could it be that he had a powerful background?

Impossible, there was no background in the vast region that was stronger than Wuqing City.

Then there was only one. This priest Wang was very strong and talented.

He was so strong that even the crown prince of Wu Qing city was wary of him.

“Bang!”

At this moment, the bodies of young master Tian and young master di in the sky collided violently once again. Both of them fell to the ground.

“Ah, you... you...”

The two of them fell to the ground. The bright arm that was holding their necks dispersed and they let out a miserable scream.

They stared at Wang Xian, and their expressions changed drastically. A hint of fear grew in their hearts.

They were actually killed by this young man in an instant!

“In front of me, Heaven’s favorites like you are just trash. Remember, don’t be arrogant in front of me in the future!”

Wang Xian said as he looked at young master Tian and young master di, whose faces were filled with fear.

“I’m sorry, Wu Qing City’s crown prince!”

He looked at Wu Qing city and spoke again. His gaze swept over he yuan and the rest, and he nodded his head faintly.

Following that, his gaze landed on Ling Jian ‘er.

At this moment, Ling Jian ‘er was staring at him with a look of astonishment in her eyes.

Wang Xian smiled at her faintly and walked out.

Behind him, all the young men and women from all the forces were staring at his back with shock.

Until disappeared!
