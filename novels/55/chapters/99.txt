Chapter 100: Love Bar

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

Love Bar was a bar on a street of Rivertown that was relatively more well-known, relatively well received and had a relatively better atmosphere.

Wang Xian and Wang Dahai reached the entrance of the bar before the girls.

Wang Dahai waited by the side anxiously.

“Why are you so excited? You look just like a bull that’s in heat!”

Looking at Wang Dahai, Wang Xian found it hilarious.

“You wouldn’t understand. This is true love. If you encounter the girl you really like, you would be the same as me. Rongrong is the cutest girl I’ve ever seen. I definitely want her to be my girlfriend.”

Wang Dahai spoke resolutely.

Wang Xian was taken aback. This was still the first time he had seen Wang Dahai being so serious about chasing after a girl. He patted him on the shoulder and encouraged, “All the best!”

“She’s here, she’s here!” Wang Dahai saw them walk out from a rented car and quickly went up to receive them.

When Rongrong saw Wang Dahai, she spoke with a smile. “Let’s go. We can reserve a table for the five of us to chat and drink!”

“Sure, let’s go in.”

Wang Dahai nodded his head and the group of five walked towards the bar.

Once they entered the bar, deafening music overwhelmed their ears.

Wang Xian’s eyebrows knitted together. This was the first time he’d visited a bar and wasn’t used to such an atmosphere.

Looking towards the dancing platform, he saw a group of young men and women fooling around.

Some were even grinding on each other. Under the faint and shimmering lights, there was a sense of vileness filling the atmosphere.

Wang Xian looked at Wang Dahai and noticed that he was also frowning.

The three girls seemed to be familiar with the place as they walked towards a long table. Immediately, the waiter walked over.

“Girls, which set meal would you like to have?” the waiter asked as he handed over a price list to the three girls.

Rongrong took a look at the price list before ordering. “The $1,888 set meal. Besides that, we want two bottles of Chivas Regal!” [1]

“Alright, please wait a moment.”

Wang Dahai and Wang Xian sat down. When he saw the prices on the price list, he frowned.

“Dahai, a $1,888 set meal with two bottles of Chivas Regal of $400. That’s already more than $2,600!”

“$2,600?” Wang Dahai put aside the price list and whispered, “Old Wang, since I’m here, I’ve made preparations. If I don’t spend this, how could I get the girl?”

“Alright then, all the best!”

Wang Xian smiled and patted his shoulders.

“Come, Rongrong. I had not expected your roommates to all be so beautiful!”

Wang Dahai quickly started flirting. As for Wang Xian, he simply sat quietly and observed.

The waiter quickly brought over the alcohol, fruits, and nuts. Wang Xian took a bottle of alcohol and poured some for himself.

After trying a mouthful, he put it down.

Fake alcohol!

“Handsome, are you from the same class as Wang Dahai?”

Just as Wang Xian was feeling bored and looking around, a girl sat beside him.

The girl had a good figure but her face was a little long. She gave off a “vixen” vibe and could be considered as good looking overall.

“Yeah.” Wang Xian nodded his head before looking toward Wang Dahai. “Hey pretty, do you think Dahai has a chance with Rongrong?”

“This...” The girl thought for a while before continuing, “I’ll tell you if you finish two more cups.”

“Alright.” Wang Xian shrugged his shoulders helplessly and gulped down two cups of alcohol. “I believe you can tell me now?”

“I don’t know about it. Haha. If Wang Dahai works hard, he might have a chance!”

Wang Xian was speechless upon hearing her reply. It was equivalent to not saying anything.

“Come handsome, let’s have a toast!”

That girl leaned over and had half of her body on Wang Xian. At this moment, Wang Xian could even smell her perfume.

Wang Xian frowned, “I’m not good with alcohol.”

“Just have a little. Oh right, handsome! Do you have a girlfriend?” the girl asked directly.

“Yeah.” Wang Xian hesitated for a while. “I do.”

“Huh? You have a girlfriend? Do you mind changing one?” The girl looked at him with her pair of large eyes and even blinked flirtatiously at him.

Looking at the girl, Wang Xian felt as though he was a weak little lamb.

The other party had ample experiences with flirting. Although Wang Xian was being picked up by the girl, he wasn’t feeling happy at all.

The girl in front of him couldn’t be compared with Guan Shuqing or Lan Qingyue at all. She was just like a prostitute to Wang Xian.

Shameless and revealing!

Wang Xian wasn’t too interested in continuing chatting, and simply said a few perfunctory words in response. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

That girl saw how Wang Xian acted and started frowning. Contempt flashed in her eyes and she went back to her previous seat beside the other girl directly.

At about 10 pm, Wang Dahai said to Wang Xian, “Let’s go to the bathroom, Old Wang!”

“Sure.”

Wang Xian nodded his head and followed him to the bathroom.

The girls behind them took a look at them but soon went back to playing among themselves.

“How was it?”

Entering the washroom, Wang Xian glanced at Wang Dahai and asked.

“This...” Wang Dahai frowned. “Rongrong is pretty good, but... But...”

“Doesn’t feel like a student and was very open?” Wang Xian hesitated for a moment and added.

“Yeah!” Wang Dahai didn’t know how to describe it and simply nodded his head.

For a female university student to be so open in such a place, it was clear that she was a frequent patron. This made Wang Dahai, who was a little chauvinistic, a little uncomfortable.

“That’s how I felt too. Dahai, you’ve got to think about it!”

“I know. Let’s see how it goes. It was very comfortable to chat with her,” Wang Dahai replied after thinking for a moment.

“Mm!”

Wang Dahai took out a cigarette to smoke. After he was done, he signaled to Wang Xian to return.

The two of them walked towards their seats. There were a lot more people at the bar than when they had arrived. This was natural, as the nightlife had just started after 10 pm.

“Huh?”

To their surprise, they saw four other men when they were back at their seats.

These four young men were sitting in their seats and chatting happily with the three girls.

On the table, there were five bottles of imported wine and over 20 bottles of beer.

Wang Xian and Wang Dahai exchanged gazes before finding another place to sit.

“Come Dahai, let me introduce them to you. This is Lingling’s boyfriend and our friends. We happened to bump into them so I asked them over. It’s livelier with more people!”

Rongrong moved towards Wang Dahai and spoke to him with smiles.

“Rongrong, is this the handsome guy who is wooing you? He’s not as handsome as me!” A young man beside Rongrong took a glance at Wang Dahai and chuckled.

“You are handsome?” Rongrong rolled her eyes at him.

“Am I not?” The young man leaned over towards Rongrong.

“Scram! Get further away from me!” Rongrong stretched over to whack him. “Don’t!”

Seeing the two of them flirting with each other, Wang Dahai’s eyebrows twitched and wasn’t looking well.

“Dahai, shall we go?” Wang Xian saw everything. He moved towards Wang Dahai and spoke softly.

“Mm, alright!” Wang Dahai took a deep breath and forced out a smile. He looked at Rongrong and said, “Rongrong, I’m sorry. We just received a call and have something urgent to attend to. We will be going off now!”

“Huh?” Rongrong frowned upon hearing Wang Dahai. However, she immediately remarked, “In that case, get the bill before you go!”

“Alright!” Wang Dahai nodded his head unwillingly. He shouted to the waiter at the corner, “Waiter, bill please!”

“Alright, sir.” A waiter walked over. “Your total bill...”

“Wait a minute. Get us two more cartons of beer and two bottles of whiskey!” At this moment, one of the young men interrupted.

“Alright, sir.” The waiter nodded his head. After recalculating, he continued, “Adding those that this mister ordered, your total bill is $9,380!”

“What?? $9,380?”

Wang Dahai was shocked and looked at the water in disbelief!
