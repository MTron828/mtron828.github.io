Chapter 1390: 1390 didn’t give him any face

It wasn’t easy to be the boss now!

Wang Xian looked at the water orb on the stage and smiled.

It was a marriage proposal!

As one of the pillars of the Dragon Palace in the future, Duan Jinming naturally had to be in the limelight. The things that he proposed to get shouldn’t be shabby.

Wang Xian wouldn’t let Duan Jinming lose face either.

“Regardless of whether you wear this water orb yourself or give it to your wife or daughter, it is definitely the best gift. The starting bid for the water orb of the first level of the void interpretation stage is five billion middle-grade spirit stones!”

The auctioneer introduced the item on the stage with a smile. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“5.1 billion medium grade spirit stones!”

A young man immediately bid!

“5.2 billion medium grade spirit stones!”

“5.3 billion!”

“5.4 billion!”

In an instant, many people started to bid.

“6 billion!”

When the price reached 5.7 billion, Wang Xian raised the bid to 60.

Some of the people around saw Wang Xian’s bid and looked over.

“7 billion, I want it!”

However, at this moment, a voice suddenly rang out, raising the price to 7 billion!

“Eh? 7 billion, it’s a direct increase of 1 billion middle-grade spirit stones!”

“It’s the young city lord, it’s the voice of the young city lord of Xiaoyao City. He’s bidding!”

“There’s no need for the young city Lord to make a bid anymore!”

“We have to give the young city lord face!”

Some people stopped when they saw the young city lord of Xiaoyao City making a bid. Some people even shouted loudly.

“Young City Lord, you really have a lot of face!”

The woman sitting next to the young city lord heard the surrounding voices and said to him with a smile on her face.

“Haha, since I have made my move, usually no one would compete with me!”

The young castellan raised his head slightly and looked around. He stood up slowly and said, “Thank you for giving me this little bit...”

“7.5 billion!”

However, before he could finish his words, Wang Xian raised the auction house in his hand and handed over a number.

“What?”

Everyone looked at the young city Lord but was stunned by the sudden voice.

All the forces in the king’s auction house looked in the direction of the voice in astonishment.

The young city Lord, who had just stood up, didn’t say the last word.

His face, which was full of smiles, slowly turned gloomy. He looked in the direction of Wang Xian and narrowed his eyes slightly.

“This... this... This young master from the Dragon and Phoenix Empire is bidding for 7.5 billion. Is there anyone who is willing to bid higher...”

The auctioneer looked at his young master in a dilemma.

However, an auction was an auction. It was impossible for others to not be able to bid once his young master made a bid.

This would also make the auctioneer unhappy and affect his reputation.

“Hehe, I didn’t expect this person from the Dragon and Phoenix Empire to also want this item. Alright then, 8 billion!”

The young city Lord had a cold expression on his face as he spoke indifferently.

However, everyone present could feel his anger.

“Is this young man from the Dragon and Phoenix Empire looking for death? How dare he compete with the young city Lord!”

“That’s right. Moreover, it was when the young city Lord had just stood up to express his gratitude. How embarrassing for the young city Lord!”

Some of the surrounding factions were stunned when they saw Wang Xian suddenly bidding for the item.

This fellow dared to compete with the young city Lord. was he courting death?

Did he really think that he would dare to challenge Xiaoyao City just because he had just risen up and destroyed a few dynasties?

“This fellow from the Dragon and Phoenix dynasty is really courting death!”

“It’s good that he is courting death. If he really infuriates the young city Lord...”

Liu Shaohua and Yao Dingfeng revealed a faint smile when they saw that Wang Xian did not give the young city lord any face.

“He dares to not give the young city lord any face. Indeed, with his strength, he has the qualifications to do so. Even the mayor of Xiaoyao city would dare to not give him face!”

The middle-aged man who was not far away from them muttered.

“Eight billion, then 8.5 billion!”

Wang Xian looked at the young city Lord who was staring at him. His expression didn’t change as he continued to shout.

The young castellan froze slightly and said coldly, “Nine billion!”

“Ten Billion!”

Wang Xian increased the price by one billion immediately. He picked up a teacup beside the table and took a sip gently.

He didn’t put the young castellan in his eyes at all.

“Hehe, Alright, Alright. Since the Dragon and Phoenix Empire is so rich, I won’t earn for you anymore. I will offer you one last price, eleven billion. If you raise the price again, I will withdraw!”

The Young City Lord clenched his fists and said coldly.

The surrounding forces were slightly shocked when they saw the ultimatum given by the young city lord.

If the dragon and Phoenix Empire dared to raise the price again, they would have completely offended the young city lord of Xiaoyao!

This was definitely not a wise choice!

“Thank you very much then. 11 billion!”

However, Wang Xian’s voice continued to ring out in less than a second.

“Haha, Good, Good!”

The young Castellan’s face turned ashen as he sat down. He picked up the wine cup in front of him and took a big gulp. Then, he stared coldly at Wang Xian’s position.

“Is this guy courting death? How dare he offend our young castellan!”

“D * mn it, that guy from the Dragon and Phoenix Empire is courting death. How dare he be so arrogant in Xiaoyao City!”

Beside the young castellan, many young men and women saw the young Castellan’s furious look. Then, they looked at Wang Xian’s position with cold faces.

“Young castellan, this guy is not giving you any face. Let’s teach him a lesson!”

The woman beside the young castellan pouted her lips and said angrily with an unpleasant expression.

“Young castellan, do you want us to...”

Yao Dingfeng and Liu Shaohua walked over immediately and whispered.

The young castellan raised his head and glanced at them coldly. He said coldly, “No one is allowed to cause trouble in Xiaoyao City!”

“Yes, yes, Young City Lord!”

Yao Dingfeng and Liu Shaohua nodded respectfully.

“Dragon-phoenix dynasty!”

The Young City Lord clenched his fists unwillingly.

Xiaoyao city was able to become a trading city within a 100,000-kilometer radius not only because of his father’s powerful strength.

It was also because of his neutrality!

He did not interfere with the affairs of other dynasties and sects!

Furthermore, with his strength, he didn’t have the qualifications to deal with a power like the dragon and Phoenix dynasty.

Unless his father said that he was going to make a move!

But even so, he wasn’t willing to accept it!

This made him extremely frustrated!

“Congratulations to everyone from the Dragon and Phoenix dynasty for obtaining the water art bead!”

On the stage, the auctioneer squeezed out a smile and congratulated.

“This young man from the Dragon and Phoenix Empire is really... a newborn calf is not afraid of a Tiger?”

“This time, he has completely offended the young master of Xiaoyao City!”

Some of the people around were discussing in low voices as they looked over with twinkling eyes.

Wang Xian smiled faintly and completely ignored the voices around him.

Giving face to the young master of Xiaoyao City? What a joke.

In front of him, he was nothing. Even if his father was here, Wang Xian still wouldn’t give them any face.

In fact, he might even want to provoke them. If the other party wasn’t satisfied, he would fight!
