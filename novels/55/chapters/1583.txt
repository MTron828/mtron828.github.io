Chapter 1584: One thousand five hundred and eighty-four dead bodies, three thousand miles of blood

“Boom!”

Just when everyone was shocked by Wang Xian’s identity, he swung his arm towards the sky above the heaven’s pride stage.

His arm instantly turned into a dragon claw. Terrifying dark energy landed on the top of the Heaven’s pride stage.

“Bzzz bzzz!”

“Boom Boom Boom!”

A wave of energy rolled on the top of the Heaven’s pride stage. Hexagrams appeared and slowly collapsed.

“What are you trying to do?”

When the supreme elder of the solipsistic sect saw that Wang Xian was the sky demon, his expression changed drastically.

When he saw that Wang Xian had destroyed the long-distance teleportation, he growled in a low voice with an extremely embarrassed expression.

“Of course, I’m going to destroy all of you!”

Wang Xian looked at the supreme elder of the solipsistic sect and said in a calm voice.

“Hiss”

Wang Xian’s words caused the hundreds of thousands of people present to suck in a breath of cold air.

Everyone was staring at Wang Xian in a frenzy.

Especially those from the solipsistic sect. Their expressions kept changing.

If it was someone else who said this, they might feel that it was beneath them.

However, this was the Sky Demon, the famous Sky Demon!

Regarding such a crazy demon, no one dared to doubt his words.

“Destroy us?”

The supreme elder of the solipsistic sect had a slight change in expression when he heard Wang Xian’s words. However, following that, a domineering aura emanated from his body.

“Sky Devil? So what if you are a Sky Devil? In this world, the solipsistic sect is the most powerful sect. Even if you are a sky devil, don’t be so arrogant today!”

The Supreme Elder of the Solipsistic sect roared in a low voice with a cold expression as he stood there.

“Kill!”

“Today, I will destroy the Bingxin dynasty. I will make millions of corpses and make blood flow for thousands of miles!”

“Kill!”

However, Wang Xian did not pay any attention to the threat of the supreme elder of the solipsistic sect. He let out a furious roar.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

Divine Dragon Transformation!

A pitch-black divine dragon that was about 150 meters long appeared in the sky. Its brutal aura filled a radius of dozens of kilometers.

“Keke, Kill, Kill, Kill!”

The stooped old man was able to kidnap Wang Xian to treat his injuries back then. It could be seen that he was not a good person!

The stooped old man was also emitting a monstrous demonic aura as he charged forward to attack.

“Boss Demon, leave these two guys from the Bingxin Empire to me!”

The stooped old man glanced at Wang Xian with some shock and fear in his eyes. He let out a strange cry and went up to meet the Ice Dharma no and long-haired old man.

He was fighting two people at the eighth level of the Seethrough Void tier alone.

Even though his body had just recovered, he had the confidence to do so.

After all, his strength at his peak was not only at the eighth level of the Seethrough void tier.

“Kill!”

Everyone in the Iceheart Empire looked extremely embarrassed when they saw this situation. Their hearts were trembling violently. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

It was out of their expectations. It was completely out of their expectations!

They never expected that they would reach this stage. They never expected that the saint of light was actually a sky demon.

“Roar! Roar!”

At this moment, Wang Xian swayed his huge body and attacked the supreme elder of the Solitaire sect directly.

“Beast, you have offended the solitaire sect. Kill him!”

The Supreme Elder of the Solitaire sect roared with a cold face. Numerous cyan-colored giant swords appeared around him.

“Dragon Kingdom in the Palm!”

Wang Xian didn’t hesitate at all and didn’t hold back at all.

So what if he was from the solitaire sect?

Today, even if he had to risk his life, he would make everyone tremble in fear.

He would also make the solitaire sect tremble in fear.

Only in this way would they not dare to do anything to Jian ‘er!

“Go to Hell, Dharma Idol: Qingming Sword!”

The supreme elder of the Solitaire sect looked at the rumored demon claw with a grim expression. He immediately released his dharma idol.

Numerous huge swords were emitting green wind waves as if they were piercing through the sky. They attacked Wang Xian directly.

“Run! Run quickly! The battle between the experts of level eight of the Seethrough realm is not something we can watch!”

“Quick, quick! Oh My God! Who would have thought that this would happen? Who would have thought that priest Wang is the Sky Demon!”

“This time, the Bingxin Empire has offended the wrong person. Even the solipsistic sect has probably offended someone they shouldn’t have offended!”

When the spectators saw the battle, they all fled in fear.

The area of the Battle of a rank 8 void interpretation expert covered an area of 20 kilometers.

Within these 20 kilometers, if one was hit by the shockwaves, one would die instantly.

Over 100,000 people fled in fear.

“I’ve said it before. The people of the Bingxin Empire and the Soleheart sect must die!”

Wang Xian crushed the Supreme Elder’s Qingming Sword form with his Dragon Claw. His eyes were filled with killing intent as he looked at the soleheart sect and everyone from the Bingxin Empire who wanted to escape.

“Roar Roar, Dharma Idol, Abyss Demonic Dragon!”

Wang Xian roared loudly. The demonic aura on his body burst out. Every scale of his divine dragon body was trembling.

Boom! Boom! Boom

At this moment, a huge pitch-black door suddenly appeared in the sky.

The huge black door was like an abyss as it opened slowly.

Buzz

The Demonic Dragon Pearl of the eighth level of the Seethrough realm in Wang Xian’s body rushed into the huge abyss door.

Roar! Roar

A roar that sounded like a tyrant’s roar was heard from the huge abyss door.

Then, a huge dragon head came out of the Abyss.

It had brutal blood-red eyes and a ferocious face.

With the Demonic Dragon Pearl as its soul and dark energy as its body, the demonic dragon slowly came out.

The terrifying aura on its body made everyone tremble.

“My God, what is that?”

“What a terrifying aura. It’s at least at the eighth level of the profound void Martial Stage!”

At this moment, the experts from the Wuji Empire, the He clan, and the other factions were flying towards them.

When they saw the terrifying creatures coming out from the huge black door that covered an area of ten kilometers, all of them sucked in a breath of cold air.

Even the experts at the eighth level of the profound void martial stage stopped in fear!

“What on Earth happened to make that Sky Demon so angry that he even wanted to kill the disciples of our sect!”

Everyone’s eyes flickered as they looked over and thought to themselves.

“Oh No, run! All Disciples of our sect, run away now!”

“Icy law enforcement, go and block the dark creatures in the sky!”

The Supreme Elder of our sect saw another terrifying creature appear in the sky and his heart pounded violently. He hurriedly shouted.

“Supreme Elder, our opponent is very strong. We can’t separate our bodies at all!”

The two ancestors of the Ice Heart Empire roared with trembling voices.

At this moment, they were completely flustered.

The hunchbacked old man in front of them was actually able to fight two people at the same time without being at a disadvantage. In fact, he was even able to do it with ease.

This caused the sky demon to summon another level eight creature of the profound void martial stage.

He was completely unable to block it!

“Kill!”

The Abyss Demon Dragon let out a hoarse and brutal aura. His black dragon flame landed on all the disciples of the lone sect.

“Ahhhh!”

Screams sounded instantly. The disciples of the Solitaire sect, who had always been high and mighty and thought that they were superior, revealed a terrified expression.

As the dark demon flame landed, screams sounded.

At this moment, they knew that the Sky Demon didn’t care that they were the disciples of the Solitaire sect!

It might really be as they had said, causing millions of corpses to be buried and thousands of miles of blood to flow!
