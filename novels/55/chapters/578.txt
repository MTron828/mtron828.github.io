Chapter 579: Shot To Fame (2)

Looking at the middle-aged man who was staring at him with coldness on his face in the shop, he frowned slightly, revealing a sharp icy gaze.

These five people not only refused to believe what he said but also spoke with a fiery temper. Wang Xian was slightly furious about that.

Slowly, balls of water energy condensed in his hands.

“Lad, I’ll let you know the consequences of cheating us!”

Raging aura surged around the middle-aged man just like violent tornadoes as he glowered at Wang Xian coldly.

“Five blind things!”

A murderous intent flashed across Wang Xian’s eyes as the energy around him thickened.

“Darn you, how dare you scold us!”

When the five of them heard what Wang Xian said, they exhibited icy killing intent, especially when one of the middle-aged men drew his long blade.

Om!

“Master!”

However, just before the five men from Tianwen Sect and Wang Xian struck, a voice suddenly cut the air.

Wang Xian froze as he gazed at the door, dispersing all the aura gathered around him.

With their eyebrows raised, the five middle-aged and old men quickly looked to the doorway.

Soon, the quintet revealed shocked looks.

There were about ten men who were at the door, including the old man from yesterday.

“Master, we’re slightly late!”

The old man swept a look at the five Tianwen Sect people as he beckoned to the group of people behind him with a smile.

“Master, these are the materials from the Mu Family. Compared to what we mentioned yesterday, the materials have doubled now!”

As the old man spoke, four middle-aged men carried the chests and opened them on the floor.

Inside the chests were metals that were Level 10 and 11.

Apart from that, there were chests of intact Spiritual Grass too.

In a moment, the smell of the metal and the aroma of the Spiritual Medicine filled the entire store.

“Doubled?”

Wang Xian revealed a tinge of surprise in his eyes. He ignored the five middle-aged and old men as he walked to the chests.

“Yes, doubled. All the materials are here. We have 400 portions of materials for Level 10 Spiritual Equipment, 400 portions of materials for Level 5 elixir pills, 80 portions of materials for Level 6 elixir pills. We only have more materials and not less. If you are not convinced, you can make a count!” said the old man to Wang Xian with a smile.

“There’s no need to. Given the reputation of Mu Family, I trust you guys!”

Wang Xian swept his gaze across the ten big chests with fervent eyes.

Since the Mu Family got him to refine Spiritual Equipment and elixir pills, they would not dare to shortchange him.

“Thank you for your trust. All the information for the required Spiritual Equipment and elixir pills is here. Just following accordingly will do!” said the old man as he handed a manual to Wang Xian.

“Sure, rest assured that I’ll get it done. You may send someone here to collect it five days from now!”

Wang Xian took over the manual with a smile.

“Great, come directly to us if you have any other requirements!” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

The old man nodded as he swept his gaze at the five people beside him. He chuckled and continued, “Master, since you have other business in the shop, we’ll take our leave now!”

“Okay!”

Wang Xian nodded.

As the group of people from Mu Family left, the remaining five Tianwen Sect people were totally dumbfounded.

What had they just seen? They knew the group of people and that old man who came in just now.

Mu Family, Mu Family!

The noble family from Da Hong Immortal Sect, as well as the top family in the entire Yong Chang world.

Without any exaggeration, the Mu Family was more compelling than the Tianwen Sect!

That old man was a Budding Realm expert, the Great Elder of Mu Family, who took care of all matters in the family.

At the same time, he was an elder of Da Hong Immortal Sect.

Coming from such a family, an old man with his status actually addressed this young man as Master!

Master?

When they spotted the chests that contained Level 10 and 11 metal and Spiritual Grasses, their hearts beat violently.

Mu Family has their own alchemy master, so why would they let others refine pills for them?

That’s because...

The five of them exchanged looks with shock and astonishment in their eyes.

This young man is a master!

A master that even Mu Family has to treat with respect!

Recalling their behaviors just now, the five of them panicked.

“Master... we...!”

That middle-aged man who had been ready for a fight revealed a flustered look. He looked at Wang Xian as he stuttered with a trembling voice.

They were desperately looking for an alchemy and blacksmith master. Now that they finally met one, they almost got into a fight with him.

Oh my, this is absolutely...

How can there be such a young master around?

The five of them felt as if they’d been unjust. Since they were the ones with requests, they had to lower their heads with respect at this time.

“Master, it was our fault just now. We were blinded. We apologize to you!” the long-haired middle-aged man quickly said to Wang Xian after taking a deep breath.

“Yes. It’s our fault. We apologize to you!”

The other four hurriedly echoed.

A master that even Mu Family treated respectfully was not someone who Tianwen Sect could afford to offend.

Even if they could afford to offend him, they would not want to do it since they needed a favor from him.

Looking at them, Wang Xian revealed a hint of a sneer on his face. “Get lost now!”

“Eh, Master, it’s our fault!”

The long-haired middle-aged man gritted his teeth when he saw the cold face of Wang Xian. He fished out two items from his pockets. “Master, it was our fault just now. These are our gifts as a token of apology!”

One of the two items was exuding a blazing flame while the other was emitting a cool and icy blue glow!

“Hur? Spiritual Flame Ball and Spiritual Liquid Ball? Both of them are Level 11!”

Sharp radiance flashed across Wang Xian’s eyes as he gazed at those two Spiritual Beads.

“How many pieces of Spiritual Equipment and elixir pills do you guys want to make?”

Without any hesitation, Wang Xian took the two Spiritual Beads.

On account of the fact that these five people were respectful and even took out Level 11 Spiritual Beads, Wang Xian decided to drop the matter.

After all, he would be the one who benefited the most when they were here to refine equipment and elixir pills.

“Master, thank you for your forgiveness! You’re such a magnanimous man!”

Seeing that Wang Xian accepted the two Spiritual Beads, and hearing his question, the five of them were excited as they licked his boots.

The arrogance and fiery temper that they had when they first came in were long gone.

“We want to refine a hundred pieces of equipment and two hundred-odd elixir pills! ” an old man answered quickly.

“Each piece of Spiritual Equipment will take two sets of material. For every three sets of elixir pills material, you’ll get four elixir pills. This is the price at my place!”

Upon hearing them, Wang Xian’s eyes gleamed.

“What?”

The five of them froze for a moment when they heard the quote and they looked startled.

He did not quote a high price, nor was it the market price.

His price was simply too low!

“Master, what are the extra charges?” the long-haired middle-aged man asked, trying to contain his excitement.

“No extra charges except what I mentioned just now.”

Wang Xian shook his head and replied immediately.

Lowering his earnings was a way to obtain more profit.
