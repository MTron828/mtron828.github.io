Chapter 1402: The 1402 trial began

When the cold voice of the Liu clan’s fourth rank profound void martial stage filled with killing intent sounded.

All the human clansmen of the fire hammer clan gritted their teeth, ready to die.

A clear and cold voice sounded directly.

“Members of the Dragon Palace, come and bring our brothers home!”

The clear and cold voice covered the entire scene, causing the nearly 60 profound void martial stage experts who were about to make a move to be slightly stunned.

The faces of everyone in the surroundings also revealed a stunned expression.

“Eh?”

The city lord of Xiaoyao City who was floating in the sky was slightly stunned, and his gaze swept to the position behind him.

But very quickly, his pupils slightly contracted, carrying a trace of surprise and strangeness, and he frowned as he sensed the strength of this group of creatures.

“My God, what kind of creatures are those? So huge, they are actually over thirty meters in size!”

“Oh my God, this is the biggest creature I’ve ever seen. What kind of Demonic Beast Race Is This?”

Soon, sounds of exclamations suddenly came from behind. These exclamations once again caused everyone to be slightly stunned.

Some of the people around looked behind them. When they turned their heads to look, their eyes widened violently, and their faces revealed a shocked expression.

Nine extremely huge creatures occupied the path behind them. Each creature was thirty meters long.

The thick and heavy scales on their bodies were lifelike under the sunlight.

Their heads were filled with dignity. Even if they didn’t exude any aura, the pressure from their main bodies made people’s breathing slow.

“Look at the position behind us. There are demon monkeys, lightning creatures, and demon beasts with bows and arrows. which force is this?”

“Why do I feel that these 1,000 plus creatures are so terrifying? Which faction are they from?”

“Bring Our Brothers Home? Bring who home? What’s going on?”

When they saw the entire troop of 1,000 plus creatures, they were all discussing in shock.

Even the experts and families of Xiaoyao City who were surrounding Wang Xian and the fire hammer clan were frowning as they looked over.

“Excuse me!”

Ao Qitian and Mu Zesen, who were walking at the front, spoke in a deep voice.

They saw that the front was completely blocked and spoke in a deep voice.

“Who are you people? Which faction are you from?”

The young castellan looked at the powerful demonic beast faction that had suddenly appeared and frowned slightly.

Ao Qitian and Mu Zesen glanced at them coldly. The experts and families of the gilded gold clan looked at them in astonishment and quickly made way for them. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

More than a thousand members of the Dragon Palace walked toward the destroyed manor under their astonished gazes.

“Dragon King!”

A group of disciples of the Dragon Palace walked to the front of Wang Xian and shouted respectfully.

There were more than a thousand members of the Dragon Palace. Among them, half of the insightful emptiness realm experts had come!

Three hundred!

“Dragon King, you asked us to come and bring our brothers home. Is it them?”

Ao Qitian bowed respectfully. Even though he had shrunk, he was still five meters in size.

He squeezed out a smile and looked at the members of the Fire Hammer clan around him.

“That’s right. They will be your brothers and new members of the Dragon Palace in the future!”

Wang Xian smiled when he saw Ao Qitian and the rest arrive.

“Dragon King, it seems like someone is trying to kill our brothers!”

Mou Zesen said calmly from the side. He turned around slowly and swept his gaze across everyone around him.

“Roar!”

“Roar!”

...

Suddenly, nine terrifying howls were heard from the mouths of the nine flood dragons.

The sudden howls of the flood dragons soared into the sky in an instant. Everyone in Xiaoyao City could hear it clearly!

Nine flood dragons flew up and hovered above the heads of Wang Xian and the rest. Waves of terrifying aura were emitted.

“Haha, We Are Here to bring our brothers home. Now, someone wants to kill our brothers!”

“Brothers of the Dragon Palace, what should we do if someone dares to kill our brothers!”

Ao Qitian laughed out loud. His entire figure turned violent in an instant.

His figure instantly increased to ten meters in size, and his berserk roar resounded throughout the sky.

At this moment, all the experts of the nearby Xiao Yao City were stunned.

However, what shocked them even more was what was happening below!

“You dare to offend my brothers of the Dragon Palace, Kill!”

“Kill!”

“Kill!”

Roars and cold killing intent shot into the sky.

The wind and clouds changed color, and the sky dimmed!

Boom

A terrifying and unparalleled aura rushed toward the surroundings.

Hualala

“What... the F * ck...”

“How... how is this possible!”

When the killing intent of all the members of the Dragon Palace soared into the sky.

Even the weakest of the 300 insightful void martial artists was comparable to a level 2 insightful void martial artist!

At the moment when the terrifying aura completely rose up.

The impact directly rushed into the surroundings.

The collapsed buildings and rocks were sent flying backward. The tens of thousands of people surrounding them kept retreating backward.

Some of them who were below transcendent level eight or nine had even fainted.

Even the insightful void martial artists who were floating in the sky were sent flying backward for dozens of meters.

In an instant, the entire encirclement expanded a lot.

Wang Xian’s figure slowly flew into the sky.

Below him, the members of the Fire Hammer clan were standing there. At the periphery, more than a thousand members of the Dragon Palace were standing in front of them.

Three hundred insightful emptiness realm experts were looking down on everyone around them.

Hiss

In an instant, everyone sucked in a breath of cold air. Their eyes were wide open as they looked at the scene in front of them in disbelief.

Three hundred profound void martial experts stood together, emitting a terrifying aura. What kind of scene was this.

Many people had never seen so many experts in their entire lives.

Moreover, many people had thought that the cards of the nearly sixty profound void martial experts who had directly come out of Xiaoyao City were already invincible.

However, compared to what was before their eyes, they were simply on a completely different level.

Everyone felt their breaths become sluggish. The insightful void martial artists surrounding Xiaoyao City had traces of fear on their faces.

That’s right, it was fear.

The aura of these three hundred insightful void martial artists was too terrifying!

In particular, this group of insightful void martial artists were all very powerful!

“Gulu, what force is this, this...”

They all widened their eyes, and their expressions changed drastically!

“They... They are our brothers? Our brothers from the Dragon Palace are taking us home?”

However, at this moment, the most shocked people were all the human clansmen of the fire hammer clan.

They stared blankly at the experts protecting them in front of them.

Each of them emitted an imposing manner that they looked up to.

Especially these three hundred terrifying existences. They actually called them brothers?

What did they do?

The fire hammer clan’s most glorious time was in the last few days, and this was also because of the Dragon King.

But now, they actually had a group of terrifying brothers?

“Our Brothers...”

The fire hammer clan’s hearts trembled, and they couldn’t help but mutter to themselves.

And they had to kill the enemy for them?

It was like a dream!
