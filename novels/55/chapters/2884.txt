Chapter 2885: 2,885 dragon punishment 1

“Is that a divine dragon, a void Behemoth? What a terrifying power, it’s at least at the divine emperor level!”

“Hiss, look, look, there are humans on that Behemoth!”

“Look at the thing behind those nine terrifying creatures, what is that? A divine carriage?”

“Why do I see that the nine creatures in front look like Divine Dragons? is that really a divine dragon?”

The group of Dragon Palace members flew quickly in the Heaven Wizard region. As they got closer to the center of the Heaven Wizard region, there were more life planets and more experts.

More and more people saw the nine wind divine dragons pulling the dragon palanquin. The two giant beasts carried the experts of the Dragon Palace on their bodies.

In particular, the nine wind divine dragons and Xiao Lan’s small house’s terrifying might.

The divine emperor’s might made the experts of the Heaven Wizard region who were relatively close to them turn pale.

The irresistible might caused them to feel fear.

As time passed, more and more news about the flying of the gigantic beasts appeared on the Heaven Magus region’s communication network.

“They are flying towards the center of the Heaven Magus region.”

After six or seven days, many experts on the Heaven Magus region’s communication network were shocked to discover that more than ten gigantic beasts were flying towards the center of the Heaven Magus region.

The center of the Sky Shaman Region was where the Witch Formation Association was located.

After another two days, some people took pictures one after another.

In the pictures, nine creatures with gigantic wings were pulling a dragon sedan.

Behind them, on the left and right sides, there were two gigantic beasts. On top of those gigantic beasts, there were human figures.

The pictures were slightly blurry, but even so, they still caused a huge sensation in the sky shaman region.

Some experts of the Cheng Wizard Association and the imperial court immediately recognized that it was the two giant beasts of the Dragon Palace.

The Dragon King Might Be Here!

The news caused a huge sensation.

Five years ago, the Cheng Wizard Association went to the Imperial Star Field to kill and resurrect the Tianchen God Emperor.

However, what the entire celestial wizard territory didn’t expect was that the Cheng Wizard Association returned in defeat.

Along with them were countless people from the imperial court who had suffered a great loss.

Later, they learned that the success Wizard Association and the Imperial Court had joined forces and were still defeated by the Dragon Palace.

Now, in just five years, the Dragon Palace had actually attacked.

This caused the entire celestial wizard territory to be in an uproar.

“The Dragon Palace actually attacked us directly. Aren’t they too arrogant? How dare they enter the depths of our Celestial Wizard Territory?”

“They’re courting death. Does the Dragon Palace really think that they can destroy our Witch Formation Association? As long as they dare to come, we’ll definitely make them pay a heavy price!”

“Our Witch Formation Association has been established in the Heaven Magus region for nearly a billion years. No faction has ever dared to attack us. A few hundred million years ago, our expert from the Witch Formation Association killed Liu Li’s divine emperor, but they didn’t dare to attack us.”

On the Heaven Wizard Domain’s communication network, countless people were discussing.

Especially the members of the formation Wizard Association. They were filled with anger and disdain towards the Dragon Palace’s attack.

All the factions in the entire resplendent starry sky knew that array masters had the ability to fight above their level. Moreover, they were best at defense.

If an array master took the initiative to attack, he might be able to fight two people at once.

However, if he was given enough time and they were fully prepared, he could fight four enemies at once.

This was the power of an array master.

It was even more so for the experts of the Witch Association.

Now that they knew that the Dragon Palace might have invaded, countless members of the Witch Association were full of disdain and cursed the dragon palace for being too arrogant.

Of course, there were also people who said that the Dragon Palace had come because they were fully confident. After all, the Tiancheng Divine Emperor had joined the Dragon Palace and the Tiancheng Divine Emperor knew the Witch Association better. It was impossible for the Tiancheng divine emperor to attack blindly. He must be confident.

However, there were not many such voices.

“Bang!”

“Damn it, the Dragon Palace actually invaded. Their strength must have increased again. Otherwise, how would they dare to Attack!”

At that moment, in the center of the Sky Shaman Region, in the land of the Witch Mountain.

Inside the tallest mountain, the god Emperor of the Witch Formation Association slammed his hand heavily on the table with an extremely ugly expression. His expression kept changing.

The Dragon Palace had actually charged over. His master had actually charged over.

“Monarch, have you managed to contact monarch Shen Wu and the others?”

At the front, the Magus glanced at son of heaven, looked at the monarch, and asked.

“We haven’t been able to contact them. According to the time, it should still be more than a month before they reach us!”

“I don’t know if it’s because they’re rushing or for other reasons, but they haven’t replied!”

The Empyrean lord frowned slightly and shook his head.

They had not received any news of what had happened in the Holy Region.

They were too far away and could not return to their divine kingdoms directly because they had to come with the eight desolation divine emperor.

Therefore, it would take them a few months to fly to the Heaven Magus region.

From the looks of it, they would not be able to arrive at the fastest speed possible. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“I think that the Dragon Palace’s Dragon King should already know that the eight desolation divine emperor is going to join forces with us. That’s why he’s attacking and is prepared to take the risk!”

The monarch’s eyes sparkled as he guessed.

“I agree with that. No matter how fast they improve, it’s impossible for them to double their strength. The eight desolation divine emperor must have felt immense pressure when he joined forces with our Dragon Palace, so he’s prepared to take the risk.”

A God Emperor of the Wizard Association nodded in agreement.

“Tian Chen, he’s not a fool. I know him better than all of you.”

“If he’s not confident, why did he ask the Dragon King to attack us?”

Tian Zi looked at them and said with a gloomy face.

He did not agree with the emperor’s words. He knew his master very well.

His master understood the power of the Wizard Association, so he was not confident that the Dragon Palace would attack them?

“The Dragon Palace is stronger than before!”

The Wizard said with a slightly embarrassed expression. He waved his arm, and a picture of nine wind dragons appeared.

Compared to the picture on the communication network of the Sky Wizard region, this one was much clearer.

“What is this creature? Why does it look like a dragon God?”

“It looks like the legendary Dragon God. Is it a dragon God?”

In an instant, the monarch and the other divine emperors stood up and roared with varying expressions.

“It should be a creature with the bloodline of a divine dragon. These nine creatures are at the divine emperor level. In the battle five years ago, the Dragon Palace did not have these nine divine emperor creatures.”

The Wizard said with a solemn expression.

“Nine divine emperors?”

Hearing his words, the monarch and the others’expressions slowly became ugly.

Five years ago, the Dragon Palace had more than ten divine emperors, and now there were nine more. It had only been five years.

This kind of improvement was too terrifying!

This kind of enemy was too terrifying!

“Emperor Lord, what should we do now? Hide? meet up with bhang?”

The Emperor Lord’s expression was extremely gloomy as he clenched his fists.

“The Dragon Palace should be afraid that we would join forces with bhang if they attacked at this time.”

“That also means that the dragon palace is not as strong as US joining forces with bhang.”

The Wizard’s eyes flickered.

“The Wizard Association has stood in the Sky Wizard region for a billion years. They are not afraid of any invasion if it comes to defense!”
