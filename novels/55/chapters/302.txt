Chapter 303: Crawl Here On Your Knees And Pay Respect To Great Martial Nanny (2)

Sui Huang, with the phone in his hands, froze, standing in the room.

He was stupefied with what his disciple had told him just now. Upon hearing the haughty voice from the phone now, his expression darkened immediately.

The other party wanted him to go there and kneel in front of him. On top of it, it was the descendant of the Sui Family who had said it.

For a moment, Sui Huang’s face sank with a cold expression. Not only had his descendant bullied his new disciple, but he even wanted him to go over with his knees on the ground.

This unfilial descendant may have not known the truth, but it was still disgraceful and unforgivable. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Looks like some of the younger fellows of Sui Family are accustomed to arrogance.”

Sui Huang darkened his expression. As the pillar and founder of Sui Family, he fought with his life such that they could become a Sacred Clan and achieve their current status.

Now, he was old. He could only have a few decades of life span left. For the future of Sui Family, he had spent twenty years roaming around the country just to find a successor.

He wanted to find a disciple who could take over for him and inherit his prowess.

Nothing is impossible for those who try. He finally found a fantastic disciple, and he was sure that this disciple would be extraordinary. Her strength could reach his realm easily.

When he turned old, his disciple could still maintain the prosperity of Sui Family for another century.

Yet, a lad from Sui Family had dared to provoke his own elders, and even acted arrogantly in front of him.

Sui Huang had a nasty and cold look. “Disciple, where are you now? Someone will be there in five minutes!”

“I have not been meddling with family affairs for twenty years. It looks like some people have forgotten about how their ancestors worked hard for the family!”

Sui Huang hung up his phone and made several calls. “Get your ass to Fenghuo Love Hotel now. My disciple is surrounded by a lad from Sui Family. He was so arrogant that he asked me to kneel and apologize to him. You better get over and settle it for me now!”

A phone call was made to the current Sui Family leader.

The leader of Sui Family, age 75, was the grandson of Sui Huang. When he heard his grandfather’s exclamations, he was so frightened that he almost peed in his pants.

That’s right. Almost peed in his pants. His grandfather was a god-like existence to him.

In his impression, his grandfather may have been a mild person, but anyone who provoked him would be as good as digging his own grave.

“Yes, grandfather. I’ll bring my men over and check out who that is. I’ll ensure Martial Aunt’s safety.”

A film of cold sweat covered that old man’s forehead instantly. As one of the three Sacred Clan’s leaders in Shang Jing, when had he ever being so panicky before?

“Ensure her safety? Get it done in five minutes!”

Sui Huang hung up the phone immediately as soon as he finished.

“Yes, yes!”

Despite hearing the dial tone, the old man continued to answer and nod in fear.

Subsequently, he called his siblings one by one with a darkened expression.

“Grandfather is angry. Check who the trouble-maker is now!”

A phone call got all the third generation of Sui Family to put on their clothes and set off in a panic. They were the current headmen, running the family.

If their grandfather was angry, this was serious.

All the cars, one by one, drove out from siheyuan at late hours.

Sui Family had a score of third-generation members, and the number increased when it came to the fourth and fifth generations. Currently, the Sui Family had over thousands of members, blooming with offspring.

“Haha, you finished making your call? Interesting. Let’s see who your master is. It’d be good if she was a pretty woman. No fun having an old man.”

Sui Ao chuckled loudly.

“Brother Ao, you have unique taste!”

“Haha, what do you know? Brother Ao is growing rapidly. From Lolita, young girls, young ladies to pretty women... we should learn from him!” the bunch of young men remarked with a smile.

“Hmph, I hope you can laugh five minutes from now!”

Upon seeing their cocky faces, Guan Shuqing spoke with disgust.

“All of you will be kneeling before me in five minutes!”

Yuan Fei stared at them with disdain.

“Hmph!”

Xiao Yu, Lan Qingyue, and the rest stared at them coldly. We’ll wait and see if you can laugh later.

The bunch of young men smiled and commented on Xiao Yu and the rest, looking at them from head to toe.

Wang Xian and his gang kept quiet.

“Your five minutes are up. It looks like your master is late. In this case, why don’t you guys just kneel down now? I don’t have the time for you!”

Sui Ao looked at his watch after five minutes and commanded them with contempt.

“Hur?”

At this time, luxurious cars were parked at the hotel entrance with old men walking out from them.

“Brother!”

“Brother!”

“Clan Leader!”

All the elderly people looked over and greeted the old man who was dressed as a clan leader with two golden words, “Sheng, Sui” on his clothes.

“Let’s go!”

The old man swept a glance at the rest before he frowned at the sports cars in front of the hotel. A cold smile surfaced on his face.

As soon as he was at the door, he heard the arrogant voice.

The clan leader immediately pulled a long face and walked in.

Those elders behind him were also looking stern.

This incident not only enraged the clan leader, but it also incensed their grandfather.

That man was the fundamental reason for Sui Family to be standing firm.

“Do we need to kneel before you too?”

A voice resounded in the hotel lobby, stunning the group of young men.

Sui Ao was puzzled as the voice sounded familiar to him.

“Who? Get in here!”

He turned around with some impatience in his soft bellow.

“This...”

When the young man at the door turned around, his entire body stiffened up.

All of them parted their lips with wide and round eyes in disbelief when they saw the group of old men arriving at the door.

A total of twenty old men were walking into the hotel with eye-catching family uniforms.

There was another old man with an expensive-looking walking stick standing to the side.

The bunch of young men at the door unconsciously stepped aside with trembling bodies when they walked in.

The atmosphere was so still that they could even hear their own breaths clearly.

“Clan...Leader!”

Sui Ao opened his eyes wide when he saw that all the third-generation members of Sui Family, including his grandfather, were here. All he had was a surprised look.

“Clan Leader, Grandfather, why are you... why are you guys...” asked Sui Ao fearfully as uneasiness surged. But he did not dare to think further.

The Clan Leader cast an indifferent look on Sui Ao, the current most outstanding offspring of Sui Family.

He did not reply to anything as he swept his gaze across Wang Xian. Eventually, he fixed his eyes on Guan Shuqing, and quickened his pace.

The elders behind him sped up at the same time.
