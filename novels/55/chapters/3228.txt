3229 3228 ferocious dragon 10-headed space beast

In the boundless space surrounding the land, a 100,000 m large space beast was escaping.

It had 10 heads and a huge body, giving off a prehistoric aura.

Over 10 godly dragons surrounded it, wanting to hunt it down. This shocked the people on the surrounding battleships and spaceships.

This Dragon Savage 10 Head Space Beast was a very powerful existence.

Looking at its power, it had the strength of a universe knight level 3 or 4. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

However, the surrounding water dragon palace warriors weren’t weak either. Some of them had at least the strength of a universe Knight Level 4.

Especially that water god Dragon, it was the strongest.

Blue chains completely bound the Dragon Savage 10 Head Space Beast, a law net formed from water attribute energy trapped it.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

The ten-headed Dragon Space Beast shook its huge body and struggled to break free.

“Beast, behave yourself!”

The delicate voice continued to ring out. A water god Dragon shook its huge body and flew directly to the sky above the ten-headed Dragon Space Beast. Her body shook, and water pillars fell from the sky, they directly attacked the ten-headed Dragon Space Beast.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

The ten ferocious dragon-headed space beasts were in pain and shook their bodies crazily. Waves of earth-elemental nomological power spread out in all directions.

“Watch Out!”

A Dragon God roared and they tried to block the attacks.

A few weaker members of the Water Dragon Palace couldn’t help but fly backward.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

At this moment, the ten ferocious dragon-headed space beast let out a furious roar again.

This roar was extremely dull and uncomfortable.

Balls that were 100 meters in size were spat out from the ten dragon heads.

“Be careful, it’s black meteorites. Their attack power is very terrifying!”

A cry sounded and the Water Dragon God in the sky warned.

Ten black meteorites that looked like black holes attacked the ten people from the Water Dragon Palace.

“Huh?”

Wang Xian, who was standing at the side, saw the black meteorites that were attacking him. He raised his eyebrows slightly when he saw a dragon species flying in his direction.

According to his calculations, the dragon species in front of him would definitely not be able to dodge this attack.

With the terrifying attack of this space beast, this dragon would probably perish.

“Shuiyun, be careful! Dodge!”

The exclamations of the other dragon species could be heard from the side as they flew rapidly towards him.

The expression of the dragon species changed drastically when he saw the incoming black meteorite.

Crash

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows slightly. After hesitating for a moment, he flapped his divine wings and instantly appeared beside the water god Dragon.

His arm turned into a dragon claw and grabbed him to the side.

Boom

The terrifying black meteorite shot out from the side.

“What a powerful attack. As expected of the Space Behemoth.”

Wang Xian sensed the terrifying energy from the black meteorite and was astonished.

Space behemoths were the behemoths in the universe. Each of them had terrifying strength when they matured.

It was almost impossible to suppress a space beast of the same level.

Even a warrior would find it difficult to suppress a space beast.

This space beast was able to fight back despite being surrounded by over 10 powerful dragon species, one could imagine how terrifying its strength was.

However, this 10-headed space beast couldn’t compare to Xiao Zhai.

Now that Xiao Zhai Xiao Lan had the combat strength of a level four universe knight, their body size had already reached over a thousand kilometers.

Xiao Zhai Xiao Lan’s body size at the later stage could be comparable to the size of the stars.

“Thank you for your help, Sir!”

The Water Dragon Palace’s powerhouse who was rescued by Wang Xian had a look of a survivor.

He quickly thanked Wang Xian.

“No need, it’s nothing!”

Wang Xian shook his head and retracted his dragon claw.

“HMM? This sir is also a member of the Divine Dragon Lineage?”

When the expert from the Water Dragon Palace saw Wang Xian’s palm, his eyes were filled with astonishment.

He could sense the might of the divine dragon on the Dragon Claw.

Wang Xian smiled and nodded.

“Thank you for your help, brother. Our Water Dragon Palace is extremely grateful.”

In the sky above the ten ferocious dragons, the water dragon God thanked Wang Xian.

She held a huge water rope in her hand. The water rope bound all ten heads of the ten ferocious dragons.

Wang Xian took a look from the side. He knew a little about the water dragon palace from the universe’s AI.

Before the rise of the Dragon Palace, there were nine more famous divine dragons in the universe.

The Weakest Divine Dragon clan and the rest of the divine dragon lineages had all reached the level of mid-level races in the universe.

As for the Water Dragon Palace, among the other eight forces of the Divine Dragon lineage, they were neither strong nor weak.

The strongest divine dragon lineage called themselves the ancestral dragon lineage. They had already entered the heaven-splitting primordial land and had also stepped into the ranks of the high-level races in the universe.

Wang Xian was very curious about the powers of these divine dragon lineages.

Currently, there were not many purebred divine dragons in the Dragon Palace. As for the water god Dragon in front of him, the Dragon Palace did not have one.

“According to the information on the AI, the strongest person in the water god Dragon lineage seems to be a level five universe knight.”

Wang Xian muttered.

Boom

Roar Roar Roar

At this moment, in front of them, the ferocious ten-headed space beast let out a pained cry. Its body was also riddled with injuries.

It could be seen that the battle between the Water Dragon Palace and this cosmic beast had been going on for a long time.

“It’s going to be suppressed.”

Wang Xian muttered as he saw the heads of the ten-headed cosmic beast lowering slowly.

“It’s a success.”

At the side, the dragon of the Water Dragon Palace, who was similar to the water god Dragon but had a completely different head, looked excited when he saw this scene.

“Sir, you have saved my life. This is for you. Welcome to our Water Dragon Palace as a guest in the future. I will help to subdue this space behemoth first.”

He spoke to Wang Xian respectfully. He opened his mouth and spat out a water dragon bead. Then, he flew toward the ten ferocious dragon heads excitedly.

“HMM?”

Wang Xian looked at the dragon bead and raised his eyebrows with a smile.

A level two water dragon pearl of a universe knight. Although it was not a purebred dragon pearl, it was still pretty good.

“I can go to the Water Dragon Palace to take a look.”

Wang Xian mumbled. He was also curious about the other divine dragons.

Since the Water Dragon Palace had a purebred divine dragon, it must have obtained a huge opportunity and the inheritance of the Divine Dragon.

Seeing that they were doing their best to suppress the ferocious ten-headed space beast, Wang Xian did not continue to watch.

He moved his body and continued forward.

The main objective of this trip was the three major races.

He flapped his incipient saint wings and shuttled through the surrounding starry skies at a terrifying speed.

His first target was the Gemini race!
