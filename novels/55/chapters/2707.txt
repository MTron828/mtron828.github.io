“I...”

In the Hall of Heroes, Young Emperor Ye’s face instantly turned pale when he heard the voices around him.

The person who spoke was an expert of the imperial court, and the Empress beside the Empress was a core character of the imperial court.

Such a character, speaking of which, they could give young emperor ye some face, or they could slap him on the spot.

After all, the imperial court was invincible in terms of backing.

Now that they spoke, it was not because they did not give young emperor ye face, but because they thought that young emperor ye was too stupid.

In this world, in the end, the strong were still respected.

If you provoked a strong person, if this strong person found an opportunity to kill you, you would not be able to do anything.

Moreover, young emperor ye provoked the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace.

He was the leader of a powerful force.

“Dragon King, it’s our fault. It’s our young master’s fault. Please forgive me.”

When the two middle-aged men beside young emperor ye saw the situation, they bowed to Wang Xian with an extremely ugly expression.

Young Emperor Ye stood there with an extremely ugly expression.

“Hehe, you don’t know what you’re talking about. Kneel down!”

When Wang Xian saw young emperor ye standing there motionlessly, his aura trembled slightly.

“Plop!”

Young Emperor Ye’s expression changed. He kneeled on the ground and let out a loud sound.

“You...”

His expression changed drastically. He wanted to speak but was forcefully suppressed.

“Young emperor, why aren’t you apologizing to the Dragon King?”

At this moment, a voice came from the side. An elder and a few middle-aged men walked over.

The old man looked at young emperor Ye, frowned slightly, and spoke.

“Elder.” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Young Emperor Ye looked over and opened his mouth.

“Dragon King, it was us disciples of the Ye clan who offended you recklessly. I asked him to apologize to you immediately. Please give us some face too, Dragon King.”

The old man cupped his hands toward Wang Xian and said.

“Sure. We still have to give face to the Ye clan.”

Wang Xian looked at the old man and said faintly. Then, he looked at Ye Shaohuang.

“Dragon King, I’m... I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to offend you.”

Ye Shaohuang lowered his head when he felt Wang Xian and the elder’s gaze. His body trembled slightly as he said in a low voice.

“Yes.”

Wang Xian nodded his head faintly and looked at bei Shuang who was beside him.

“Are you looking for a team?”

He asked directly.

“Yes, master. I’m here to take a look. If there’s a suitable team, I’ll join.”

Bei Shuang nodded her head.

“Then, let’s join di Xing nu and the rest.”

Wang Xian looked at di Xing nu and said to her.

“Yes, Master.”

Bei Shuang nodded her head.

At the side, when young emperor ye saw that Wang Xian was ignoring him, he stood up with an extremely ugly expression and walked out directly.

Around him, some people looked at him with mockery and disdain.

“Wow, sister bei Shuang wants to come with us? That’s Great.”

“Wang Xian, you were too domineering just now. You made him kneel with just one sentence and he has to kneel.”

Di Xingnu said happily when she heard Wang Xian’s words.

She looked at the back of young Emperor Ye who left in a sorry state and the smile on her face grew wider.

“Let bei Shuang come with you. Later, I will leave a Dragon Guard to protect you and not participate in your battle in the Abyss.”

Wang Xian smiled.

Wang Xian did not take young emperor ye seriously at all.

A young man who was the Master of the Eternal God, even if he was the young master of the night clan, did not have the right to be impudent in front of him.

With the status of the Dragon Palace, the only people who could talk to Wang Xian on an equal footing were the clan leader of the night clan, the Guardians of the Imperial Court, and the Patriarchs of the other major sects.

If such a nobody offended him, even the powerhouses of the night clan would not say anything.

Because they were not qualified.

...

They were courting death.

“Ah, you’re leaving?”

Di Xingnu looked at him and said with slight disappointment.

“Yes, I’m going back for the time being. You guys have to pay attention to your safety here. Don’t take too much risk.”

Wang Xian instructed her and bei Shuang.

“Yes, Master!”

Bei Shuang nodded immediately.

“Alright, I’ll go back first. Leave a dragon guard at your residence. When the time comes, bring him along.”

Wang Xian spoke to them and looked at poison nine.

“Let’s go. I’ll bring you to the Dragon Palace. You’ll be a member of the Dragon Palace in the future.”

He patted Poison Nine’s shoulder and said.

...

“Dragon King, I, I...”

Poison nine stood there with an excited face, not knowing what to do. “Thank you, Dragon King.”

“Your future will be beyond your imagination.”

He said with a smile and walked straight out.

Poison nine hurriedly followed behind.

“This... Poison nine was actually taken back to the Dragon Palace by the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace!”

The leader of the poison liquid stood at the side and stared blankly at poison nine who had left. His expression changed and revealed an extremely envious expression.

If they had agreed just now, would they have been able to join the Dragon Palace?

“Leaving just like that, HMPH.”

Seeing that Wang Xian had left directly, the empress let out a light snort of dissatisfaction.

“Empress, the Dragon King said to leave a dragon guard to protect you. The strength of this dragon guard...”

At this moment, the Empress looked at the Empress with a twinkle in her eyes as she asked with some anticipation.

“I don’t know what power it is either, but I said I won’t participate in the battle and only protect us, it shouldn’t be below level 8 right?”

The Emperor Lady shook her head.

“Level 9.”

Bei Shuang immediately said.

He had some understanding of his master’s character, protecting them included her, that undying level 9 warrior.

“This...”

The Emperor Lady’s eyes revealed a look of excitement.

Even though it wasn’t to protect her, they fought alongside the emperor lady and bei Shuang, protecting them indirectly.

In the following battles, their safety would be guaranteed.

After all, no one in the entire imperial court had such treatment.

The night clan’s young Emperor Ye only had 2 undying level 8 warriors protecting him.

“Hehe, he’s quite conscientious. Let’s go, sister bei Shuang. I’ll bring you to meet some people. With you joining us, our team will be much more powerful.”

The imperial star lady happily held onto bei Shuang’s arm and walked to the side.

Bei Shuang smiled and followed by the side.

“Dragon King, let’s go back now. Aren’t we going to continue observing?”

On the teleportation planet, Ao Qitian asked Wang Xian.

“We found a special talent. Let’s go back and take a look.”

Wang Xian looked at poison nine and said with a smile.

“Oh?”

Ao qitian, Ao Jian, and the rest looked at poison nine and raised their eyebrows slightly.

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian entered the teleportation formation directly and rushed toward the Dragon Palace.

After a transit, they arrived at the Dragon Palace very quickly.

“Poison nine, come here!”

He moved and brought poison nine to the location of the dragon transformation pool.

His gaze landed on the tail of the Zerg on Poison Nine’s chest. A smile appeared on his face.

“How did the body of the Queen of the Zerg enter your chest?”

Wang Xian asked poison nine.

“AH? Dragon King, I suddenly absorbed this thing when I was absorbing the poison. After I absorbed it, I realized that it actually grew on my body.”

“At that time, I was very frightened. Later on, there would be all kinds of blurry images appearing in my mind, causing me to lose my mind.”

Poison nine hurriedly said.
