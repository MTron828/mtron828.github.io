Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

Devil Monkey King: Level 10

Extractable Dragon Energy: 201,231

It’s Level 10 and its extractable dragon energy is over 200,000! This devil monkey king is really formidable. In fact, he is almost as strong as me!

Wang Xian looked at the Devil Monkey King in front of him and had a solemn look.

His current level was six but in his divine dragon form, he could go beyond his level and challenge Level 11 animals.

However, that was applicable to ordinary animals.

For some Level 11 animals, they were able to fight beyond their level and slay Level 12 existences.

Although the Devil Monkey King was Level 10, the aura it was emitting would easily match a Level 11 animal.

The Devil Monkey King stood on the peak of the mountain that it had sliced off. An unknown metal rod that was about seven meters long was resting on his shoulders as he looked down on Wang Xian with contempt.

That looks...!

Wang Xian stared at the Devil Monkey King in front of him and recalled a character in a popular novel, The Great Sage Equalling Heaven, Sun Wukong! [1]

They both had the disposition of being the one above all and both of them used rods as weapons!

“Surrender or die!”

Wang Xian wasn’t wary at all. The other party wasn’t the Great Sage Equalling Heaven and he wasn’t the Dragon King of the East Seas from the popular novel. [2]

“How dare you kill my disciples and followers. I’m going to slaughter you!”

The Devil Monkey King held the rod in his hands tightly and his blood-red eyes were filled with black gas.

“Water Monkeys! If you aren’t willing to submit to the Dragon King, I’ll kill every single one of you!”

Prime Minister Turtle lifted his huge head as it started emitting a dull-yellow aura.

Around him, the earth started churning. His huge body was also emitting a heavy atmosphere.

Prime Minister Turtle’s strength wouldn’t be weaker than the Devil Monkey King. In fact, he might even be stronger.

Zi zi!

The Devil Monkey King gripped onto his rod tightly and gritted his teeth as he looked at the Prime Minister Turtle. He then turned his attention to Wang Xian.

A tinge of fear flashed past his eyes.

“You’ve got to defeat me to make me surrender. Otherwise...!”

As the Devil Monkey King spoke, he started manipulating the rod in his hand. Letting out a roar, he continued, “Otherwise, I won’t be convinced!”

“Great, I’ll make you submit to me!”

Wang Xian stared at the Devil Monkey King. The intelligence of this Devil Monkey King was terrifyingly high. If he could make it a general under him, it would definitely become an important general in the future!

“If you want me to submit, show me your strength. Otherwise, get out of my region and I forbid you from entering in the future!”

The devilish aura on the Devil Monkey King started raging and the water around him started turning black.

“Sure!”

Wang Xian agreed. Only by completely defeating this obstinate and unruly Devil Monkey King would it be convinced. Otherwise, it would likely choose death over surrender.

Wang Xian waved his dragon claws as the metal claws gave off a metallic glow. Charging ahead, he attacked the Devil Monkey King directly.

“Come to me!”

The Devil Monkey King moved liked a demonic shadow and was surprisingly faster than Wang Xian. Lifting the rod in his hands, he smashed ruthlessly at Wang Xian’s head.

What incredible speed!

Astonishment flashed in Wang Xian’s eyes. He swayed his tails and the seawater around him started getting denser. With him as the center, the area of 100 meters around him seemed to have been turned into a swamp.

Water Control!

Zi zi. “Huh?”

The Devil Monkey King could sense the immense increase in resistance. The devilish flames on him exploded as he forced open a free area.

“Space Shattering Metal Dragon Claws!”

The dragon claws that were glowing slashed towards the Devil Monkey King.

The devilish aura around the Devil Monkey King was shredded immediately and 18 golden marks fell onto the Devil Monkey King’s body.

Zi zi! Rawwr!

Deep cuts appeared on the body of the Devil Monkey King all of a sudden. However, what was creepy was that the Devil Monkey King wasn’t bleeding. Instead, dense black gases started flowing out.

It lifted its head and growled. Strong and dense dark aura started emitting from the rod in his hands as the Devil Monkey King swung towards Wang Xian.

“Earth Dragon’s Imperial Guard!”

Wang Xian could sense the powers of the incoming attack and was shocked. He immediately started emitting dull-yellow Earth energy around his body.

Bam!

The black rod smashed onto Wang Xian’s body directly. His body shook and the dense Earth energy dissipated, leaving behind a mark.

Sss!

Wang Xian gasped as he felt the excruciating pain from his body. The impact of the attack had numbed his entire body.

After he flushed his body with Wood attributes energy, his injuries recovered rapidly.

However, taking on this attack had made him exhaust substantial stamina.

“Even if your devilish flames could blaze the skies, I’d still defeat you today!”

Wang Xian swayed his tail. The surrounding waters moved as though they had a will and became extremely dense. Wang Xian stared at the Devil Monkey King in front of him and opened his mouth slightly.

The Dragon Ball was spat out once again. This time, the dragon ball was wrapped in a layer of water and illuminated the surrounding sea.

The Devil Monkey King looked solemnly at Wang Xian.

His wounds were still emitting a black gas and this was proof that his injuries weren’t light.

The Devil Monkey King clenched his hands tightly around the rod.

“It’s over!”

Wang Xian extended out his palm and was rotating the dragon ball with water control.

He stretched his dragon claws forward before slashing down.

The Devil Monkey King was shocked. The dense water around him had slowed him down substantially. In fact, his current speed was slower than Wang Xian.

If it couldn’t dodge, it could only take it head-on, directly.

It lifted the rod in its hands, clenched it tightly with both hands and roared, “Take this!” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“I’d like to see how tough your rod is!”

Wang Xian maintained a poker face. The dragon ball started rotating even more violently in the middle of his dragon claw as the golden-colored dragon claws ripped apart space.

Bam!

When the dragon claw and the Dragon Ball collided with the metal rod, the water around the Dragon Ball dissipated and the Dragon Ball emitted horrifying heat.

Argh!

The flames of the dragon ball started flaking off. At the same time, Wang Xian opened his mouth and spewed out flames that covered several hundreds of meters.

The flames raged on as they started overpowering the devilish aura on the Devil Monkey King.

Argh! Argh! Argh!

A heart-wrenching scream sounded. It was as though the monkey was placed in a furnace.

“I... I’m willing to submit!” the Devil Monkey King shouted loudly.

Wang Xian opened his mouth once again and devoured the dragon ball with the flames. The Devil Monkey King lay on the floor, feeling completely drained.

The seawater that was vaporized by the flames gushed in once again.

Waving his dragon claw, a five-colored blood essence flew towards the Devil Monkey King.

“Absorb it and don’t resist it!” Wang Xian shouted.

“Yes! I, the Monkey King, am willing to submit!”

The Devil Monkey King lifted his head and got up with the help of its rod. It was still panting violently. Although the battle wasn’t long, it was perilous.

The Devil Monkey King had not practiced any Cultivation Arts and had lost.

Ding! Conquered Devil Monkey King!

The notification of the system sounded. Wang Xian revealed a faint smile. Waving his dragon claw again, he injected dragon energy into the body of the Devil Monkey King to heal its injuries.

“Thank you, Dragon King!”

The Devil Monkey King kneeled down on one knee and spoke with great respect to Wang Xian.

“I’ll form the Nine Divisions of the Divine Dragon in the future. Today, I shall bestow upon you the name of Roving Heavens and place you in charge of the Devil Division! Order your subordinates to come over!”

Wang Xian imparted the Cultivation Arts of Devil Dragon Transformation to Devil Monkey King.

“Thank you, Dragon King!”

“The Devil Monkey King went down on both knees and felt overwhelmed.

“Gather your subordinates!” Wang Xian instructed. Divine Dragon Transformation consisted of nine different divine dragon cultivation arts.

Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth, Wind, Thunder, Light and Darkness. These were the nine different cultivation arts under the Divine Dragon Transformation.

Wang Xian was preparing to establish nine battle divisions of the Dragon Palace to fight in wars for him.

Devil belonged to Darkness. In the future, the Devil Monkey King would be in charge of the Devil Division!
