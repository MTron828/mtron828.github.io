Chapter 1410: Year 1410, Breakthrough! Go

“How are you going to develop next? Do You Need Manpower?”

Wang Xian looked at Feng Luan and asked seriously.

“If you need manpower, just lend me your guards of the Dragon Palace. I have obtained a lot of resources recently. I will be able to break through to level four of the Seethrough realm in a month at most!”

“By then, I can totally fight against level five of the Seethrough realm. It will be much easier to subdue other dynasties!”

Feng Luan nodded and said directly to Wang Xian.

“Sure. Let the strange demon clan follow you during the expedition. Ao Yao’s strength can be used to assassinate a fifth-level void interpretation just in case!”

Wang Xian nodded and said to her.

Feng Luan smiled. She knew the strange demon’s strength.

There were not many strange demons in the Dragon Palace, but their strength was definitely the strongest.

“Xiao Xian, the few of us have also joined the dragon and Phoenix dynasty. In the future, we will be the seven elders of the dragon and Phoenix Dynasty’s Elder Council!”

“Yes, brother. In the future, we will also be the founding ministers of a dynasty. Perhaps the people will build statues for us in the future, Haha!”

“In the upcoming expedition, we are prepared to fight on the battlefield with sister Feng Luan. We will let the people of the extraordinary continent know who said that women are inferior to men!”

Guan Shuqing, Xiao Yu, and the rest said excitedly.

“You guys can do whatever you want. Just pay attention!”

Wang Xian said with a smile.

Many dynasties had a group of elders. For example, in the Light Dragon Dynasty, the group of elders could decide the position of the crown prince.

The elders had a lot of power.

Of course, Guan Shuqing and the rest were just having fun out of boredom.

With the five girls including Shuqing, Xiao Yu, and Zhang Fengying, even the weakest among them was at the first level of the insightful void tier.

In the current Dragon and Phoenix Empire, they were all experts!

“By the way, Fengluan, I plan to monopolize the forging shop in the Dragon and Phoenix Empire. Will this be easy to implement?”

Wang Xian asked her.

Now that the Dragon Palace had the fire hammer clan, they were extremely fast in forging weapons.

If they monopolized the forging of weapons in the entire dragon and Phoenix Empire, they would earn at least tens of billions of middle-grade spirit stones every day, or even more.

If they used these spirit stones to purchase pills to increase their strength, they would be able to quickly increase the Dragon Palace’s strength.

“Monopolize the weapon industry? In fact, I want to monopolize the Pill Refining Industry!”

Feng Luan looked at him and revealed a thoughtful expression. “The benefits of monopolizing are obvious, especially the pills and weapons. However, there’s a problem -- the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging Workshop!”

“These two huge forces will be stationed in every dynasty. If they are not allowed to stay, they will be attacked by the other party.”

“Especially the dragon and Phoenix dynasty. If they really rule over one to two hundred cities in the future, they will definitely not let this market go!”

As Feng Luan spoke, she slowly frowned.

“How big are the forces of the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging Workshop?”

Wang Xian asked Feng Luan.

“On the mainland, these two influences are only weaker than the five empires!”

“Each of them has a person in the realm of longevity overseeing them!”

Feng Luan frowned slightly.

“The realm of longevity, the existence of a demigod?”

Wang Xian also frowned. Now that they were facing such an existence, there was absolutely nothing they could do.

The Life and Death Pill Workshop and the holy item forging workshop said that they wanted to enter your dynasty and open a shop there.

If you didn’t agree, the other party could completely eliminate you in the dark.

“There is one way, and that is to get the fire cloud sparrow clan to make a move. In the past few years, I have gotten the Fire Cloud Sparrow clan to make a lot of preparations!”

“However, there is a problem. The fire cloud sparrow clan can only withstand the attacks of their top-notch experts. However, if the other party uses some tricks in the dark, it would be very troublesome for us!”

Feng Luan’s eyes sparkled as she said.

“Then what do you do?”

Wang Xian looked at her.

“Initially, we only monopolized the medicinal pills and didn’t offend the holy item forging workshop. However, since you want to monopolize the weapons, I will get the fire Lark clan to make new preparations!”

“At most, we should be more careful. The strength of the fire Lark clan is not weak!”

Feng Luan smiled and made a decision.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded. “Let me know when we can enter the weapons market. I will prepare immediately!”

“Okay!”

Feng luan nodded and said, “I have to take care of some things!”

“Wait, I have something for You!”

As Wang Xian spoke, he threw a bead that was half-bright and half-dark to Feng Luan.

This bead was a treasure that Wang Xian saw in the system treasury. It was called the light and dark source, and it was exchanged for 10 million dragon crystals.

This treasure was very magical. It could sense the loyalty of the other party to him.

Nowadays, the dragon and Phoenix dynasty was developing rapidly. Some of the powerhouses who were subdued had no loyalty at all.

Using this light and dark source, one could detect whether a person was loyal to him or not and whether it was harmful to him or not.

This thing was very useful to Feng Luan.

There was a prerequisite to this. The use of the bead required the dripping of the other party’s blood.

“HMM? So Magical?”

Feng Luan took the bead and revealed a look of surprise on her face. Soon after, a smile appeared on her face.

“With this light and dark source, it will save me a huge amount of trouble!”

Feng Luan smiled and left the palace.

Wang Xian dragged the group of girls and started to stay on the couch for a few days.

For the rest of the time, Wang Xian stayed in the palace.

Currently, the sea area within a few thousand kilometers was under the control of the Dragon Palace. The number of members of the Dragon Palace was increasing every day. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

However, the increase was not much. At most, ten creatures could pass through the Dragon Gate and enter the Dragon Palace every day!

A month later, the dragon-phoenix Dynasty started their journey.

The dragon-phoenix Queen led her troops and the seven elders were all at the void interpretation level.

In addition, there were fifteen generals at the void interpretation level and twenty swordsmen at the void interpretation level.

In addition, the entire Bamboo Mountain sect followed the queen.

A total of 80 void interpretation experts led 30,000 soldiers to battle the surrounding dynasties.

Seven or eight of them had already surrendered, and in just two months, eight of them had surrendered!

However, the dragon-phoenix dynasty did not stop and continued to expand.

After breaking through eight dynasties, the number of void interpretation experts that Feng Luan had sent out reached 150.

With Feng Luan, who could fight against a rank 5 void interpretation expert, no dynasty could withstand their attacks.

The entire dragon-phoenix Dynasty expanded at a terrifying speed.

After Feng Luan broke through cities and dynasties, a large amount of resources were sent to the dragon-phoenix Royal City and the Dragon Palace.

The Dragon-phoenix royal city continued to expand.

They vowed to build the dragon-phoenix dynasty into the most magnificent and beautiful city.

When some of the dynasty’s resources were sent to the Dragon Palace, coupled with the resources Wang Xian obtained from Xiaoyao City, the amount of dragon qi he needed had reached the level of leveling up.

During the war, the corpses of the experts were also sent to the Dragon Palace.

The members of the Dragon Palace were also improving rapidly.
