The wedding that shocked the entire world ended in a way that shocked everyone.

Soon after, the wedding turned into a funeral. The death of the Godly King’s daughter, even if it was to be buried in the Nordic Divine Realm.

The entire Yuwen clan was still in silence.

The festive red color was completely removed and replaced with white.

Although it was said that turning from a joyous event to a loss would cause all the immortal sect experts in the jianghu to laugh at them, it was still better to die.

Moreover, the one who died was the daughter of the Scandinavian god King. How could the Yuwen clan still dare to care about their reputation.

Now, they only hoped that the Scandinavian god King would not vent his anger on them and take revenge on the Dragon King.

No matter what, all of this was because of the Dragon King.

“The five thousand experts of the Nordic divine realm are all gathered in the Yuwen clan. In two days, they will take the Dragon King’s head to pay tribute to the death of the Nordic Princess!”

“I heard that the Yuwen clan used level 13 materials to build a coffin for Philomena. How extravagant!”

“No one knows the exact location of the Dragon Palace. If the Dragon King is hiding, the Nordic divine realm might not be able to find him.”

“The Dragon King is currently said to be on the floating island in the River City Bohai Sea. I wonder how the Dragon King will deal with him!”

“The Yuwen clan has mobilized all their forces to find the Dragon Palace’s address. They are preparing to attack the Dragon Palace and destroy all the members of the Dragon Palace!”

Time slowly passed. The entire jianghu was in an uproar. They were paying close attention to every piece of information about the dragon king and the Yuwen clan.

Soon after, the next day, a shocking piece of news broke out in the Yuwen clan.

“There are a total of fifty immortal gods in the Nordic Divine Realm, and twenty-eight immortal gods in the Yuwen clan!”

When this news came out, everyone was dumbfounded.

Fifty immortal gods, and there were actually fifty immortal gods in the Nordic divine realm. This terrifying power was simply invincible in the world.

Fifty immortals and twenty-eight from the Yuwen clan made a total of seventy-eight.

How was the Dragon King going to deal with such a terrifying power?

“The Godly King has announced our power. If the Dragon King finds out that we are hiding, it will be troublesome!”

In the Yuwen clan, the grand elder sat below the godly king. He frowned and said respectfully, “Even if our announced strength is much less than what we actually have, our power can still be said to be invincible on Earth!”

“Invincible? That’s hard to say.”

The elder sitting in the main seat touched a small crow on his arm with a cold expression on his face.

“Elder Yuwen, we can’t underestimate this Dragon King. According to the information we received in the past two days, this Dragon Palace’s strength is not weak. The number of immortals and deities it has will definitely not be less than fifty!”

Divine King Okerdin didn’t answer him. A white-haired elder who was leaning on the crow’s cane beside him said faintly.

“A year ago, the Dragon Palace had eighteen immortals before the recovery of spiritual energy began. The number of infant realm and half-step immortal realm experts had reached seventy to eighty. This is just the strength that was revealed. If he still has hidden his strength, he might be even stronger. Moreover, according to the information we’ve received, the strength of the infant realm and half-step immortal realm experts in the Dragon Palace far exceeds those of the same level. A year’s recovery of spiritual energy is enough for many infant realm experts to break through to immortal realm. The experts of the Dragon Palace also have a very high possibility.”

As the white-haired old man spoke, he touched the walking stick in his hand.

The supreme elder of the Yuwen clan revealed a thoughtful expression.

The Dragon Palace didn’t have any ordinary disciples. The weakest ones were all in the infant realm. During this one year period, the spiritual essence had recovered. If the infant realm experts had a great opportunity and had enough medicinal pills, they could also break through to the immortal realm.

In addition, the Dragon Palace monopolized the medicinal pills in the entire jianghu, so the resources were absolutely terrifying.

“That’s right!”

Suddenly, he remembered that the Dragon Palace had once destroyed the Holy Doctor Holy Medicine Immortal sect.

With the Holy Doctor Holy Medicine Immortal Sect’s strength back then, they were completely comparable to the Yuwen clan. Moreover, the Holy Doctor Holy Medicine Immortal sect definitely had more resources than them in terms of spiritual herbs and medicinal pills.

If the Holy Doctor Holy Medicine Immortal sect still existed, they would have at least thirty immortal gods.

Now that the resources were given to the Dragon Palace, the Dragon Palace would be able to create at least twenty immortals. In addition to the previous ones and the monopolized medicinal pills, the number of immortals in the Dragon Palace might really reach seventy to eighty.

“If the number of immortals in the Dragon Palace really reaches seventy to eighty, I really can’t believe it.”

The immortal gods of the Yuwen clan suddenly sighed.

If it weren’t for the Nordic divine realm, they absolutely wouldn’t dare to provoke the Dragon King.

“According to all the information in the past, there’s a very big possibility!”

The white-haired Elder’s eyes sparkled as he spoke with wisdom.

“Hiss, if that’s the case, even if we want to destroy the Dragon Palace, the possibility isn’t very high. On the contrary, both sides will suffer heavy losses!”

The Yuwen clan’s supreme elder said with a solemn expression.

“If the Dragon King really has such a powerful force, according to his personality, what will he do?”

The white-haired elder continued to speak indifferently.

“If it’s the Dragon King, will he?”

The Yuwen clan’s immortals and deities frowned slightly, immediately after, they said, “If it’s the Dragon King, he will lead the immortals and deities of the Dragon Palace. Before we make a move, they will come to find us. This was the case with the Holy Medicine Holy Medicine Immortal Sect!”

“That’s right. It seems that you are not that stupid!”

The white-haired elder closed his eyes slightly.

The immortals and gods of the Yuwen clan looked somewhat embarrassed. “Wise man, godly king, if the strength of the Dragon Palace is really so terrifying, we can’t deal with them, can we?”

“Reporting, Grand Elder, a group of experts suddenly broke in!”

Suddenly, at this moment, an elder of the Yuwen clan rushed in with a panicked look and said in horror.

“What? Did the Dragon King bring people here?”

The grand elder of the Yuwen clan stood up abruptly with a shocked look on his face.

“Let them in!”

The godly king who was sitting at the front said!

“Godly King!”

“Godly King!”

“Godly King!”

As soon as they finished speaking, a group of people walked toward the hall in the mountain peak. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

There were about sixty people in total. The leader on the left was a burly old man with a beard and a huge war hammer in his hand.

The one on the right was an old man wearing a black robe, completely hiding himself in the robe. He wore a mask and only one eye was revealed.

In the middle was an old man wearing a divine crown and holding a divine staff.

Each of the old men exuded a terrifying dignity.

At this moment, they bowed respectfully to the god King.

“15 immortals in the Garden of Eden’s Divine Territory!”

“20 immortals in the ancient Greek divine territory!”

“25 gods from the Rome!”

“Serve the god King, kill the otherworldlings, get rid of the villains, and avenge Princess Philomena!”

The 60 powerful gods called out respectfully, and their voices resounded throughout the hall.
