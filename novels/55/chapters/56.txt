“Uncle, Aunty!”

Wang Xian greeted Guan Shuqing’s parents when they looked over at him. After all, they could be his future parents-in-law.

“Hur?” Guan Shuqing’s father frowned. He acknowledged, and threw him a glance before he fixed his eyes on his daughter.

“Dad, this is...this is my classmate.” Guan Shuqing hesitated.

“Classmate.” Her father looked at Guan Shuqing and nodded.

Wang Xian was a little stunned, as he could sense that his future father-in-law did not seem to like him. Helplessly, he looked at Guan Shuqing. “I’ll sit over here.”

As he said, he took a seat at the sofa next to Guan Shuqing.

“Dad, Mom, I’ll chat with my classmate for a while,” said Guan Shuqing to her parents as she nodded to Wang Xian.

“Sit with us. We’re bringing you to meet some people later on,” said Guan Shuqing’s father, frowning.

Guan Shuqing knit her brow, sat down with them helplessly, and smiled to Wang Xian with bitterness.

Wang Xian shook his head slightly and gave her a smile.

“Shuqing, what kind of family does your classmate come from?” Guan Shuqing’s mother looked at Wang Xian with doubts and asked her.

“This classmate of mine,” Guan Shuqing threw a glance at Wang Xian and answered with some pride, “is really awesome, Mom. He’s the same age as me, but he already earns millions of dollars. Isn’t he superb?”

“Oh? Is that so? He’s making millions at such a young age?” her mother said in surprise.

Guan Shuqing’s father was stunned too. He looked at his daughter and asked, “What kind of business is he doing?”

“He...!” Guan Shuqing chuckled, “Dad, Mom, let me tell you this. That’s the best part of him. He only has a younger sister, but he relied on himself and became an entrepreneur. Don’t you think he’s awesome?”

“No background?” Her father paused for a moment and frowned again.

“Nope, he relies on his own effort when he is just as young as me.” Guan Shuqing laughed while saying it.

Her father shook his head slightly, “No wonder he entered this place in casual wear. I guess he followed someone here, but that person did not bring him to network with the rest of the people.”

Her father was disappointed. A young man who could earn millions was awesome indeed. But without any backings or background, his achievements would be limited.

When he saw Wang Xian picking some food and beginning to eat alone, all the more he shook his head.

Upon seeing the expression on her father’s face, Guan Shuqing was unsure why.

“Director Wu is here. Let’s go, Shuqing.”

Her father took a glance at the hall and saw a familiar figure. He quickly got up and told them.

Guan Shuqing followed behind reluctantly.

“My future father-in-law seems to have a problem with me!” When Wang Xian realized that Guan Shuqing’s parents did not even look at himself, he picked up some fruit and started to feast on it. Then he fished out his phone and dialed for Xue Jing, asking her when she would be here as he was too bored.

Piak!

Suddenly, a loud slap was heard abruptly in the ballroom.

Everyone was shocked, including Wang Xian.

Wang Xian was toying with his phone when he turned around. Soon after, he stood up with a darkened expression.

At the center of the ballroom, Guan Shuqing was covering her face with her head down while her father was standing there with a hideous look on his face.

Next to them, a few middle-aged men stood there and watched impassively.

His father walked over with a sullen face.

“Director Wu, Director Gong, Master Bi, Director Song, I’m sorry. I didn’t expect she would do such a thing. It was my lack of discipline. I’m sorry.”

Wang Xian came to the middle of the ballroom as he watched Guan Shicheng bowing down and apologizing in fear.

“Do you think you can settle this with a slap? My son is lying in the hospital with broken limbs now!” Chairman Wu glared at Guan Shicheng coldly.

When he knew his son was sent to the hospital in the afternoon, he was shocked. He scrambled his way to the hospital where the doctor told him that the right arm and leg of his son were broken. It would take three to four months to recover.

He raged when his son was immobilized. He learned from his son that everything happened because of Guan Shuqing and the boyfriend of hers.

This made his blood boil. He immediately sent people to investigate the specific details and the culprit who beat his son up.

Yet, Guan Shicheng had the cheek to greet him just now. If this was not the event of the Qin Family, he might just make his move. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

The rest of the three middle-aged men were having the same sentiments as they stared coldly at Guan Shicheng.

Guan Shicheng was fearful as he did not expect his daughter would have created such trouble. He trembled in his shoes.

“Shuqing!”

Wang Xian walked over and called her name gently. As soon as he saw Guan Shuqing was holding her face, he stretched out his hand slowly and caressed her cheek.

“Xiao Xian!” A teardrop fell on his hand. Guan Shuqing lifted her chin with tears rolling in her eyes.

“It’s all right. I’m here.”

Wang Xian stroked her face as his heart ached for her. He used the Dragon Energy to moisturize her cheek.

“Who are you? Get out of my way!” Guan Shicheng looked at Wang Xian first before he stared at Guan Shuqing with a trembling body. “I raised you up. It’s okay if you’re not doing me a favor. Yet, you got into such trouble. I’m telling you, I don’t have such a daughter like you...”

Wang Xian looked at Guan Shicheng and frowned. He then turned and gazed at the four middle-aged men. With a cold smile, he said, “I was the one who beat up all your sons.”

“What?” Before the four middle-aged men could say anything, Guan Shicheng fixed his gaze deadly on Wang Xian. “You were the one who beat up their sons?”

“Yes, Uncle. It was me, and it had nothing to do with Shuqing.” Wang Xian looked at Guan Shicheng and nodded.

“Great, so it was you! You scoundrel, how dare you hit their sons? You’re courting your own doom.” Guan Shicheng pointed at Wang Xian with a hideous face. “You are just a wild kid without your manners.”

Guan Shicheng continued as he looked at the four middle-aged men, “Master Bi San, Director Wu, Director Gong, and Director Song, it was all his fault, and it has nothing to do with me.”

On seeing Guan Shicheng pointing his finger at himself, Wang Xian knit his eyebrows tightly.

“Your daughter is involved in this matter,” Master Bi San looked at Guan Shicheng and said coldly. He then turned to Wang Xian. “How dare you beat up my son. You are really outrageous!”

“You broke my son’s arms and legs. Very well, I’ll make sure you repay this 10 fold.” Director Wu was glaring at him angrily.
