Chapter 1450: The 1,450 strongest were his majesty

“HMM?”

“HMM?”

When this voice suddenly sounded, all the humans and Demon Beasts were stunned.

Especially the leader of the blood barbaric demon beasts who was standing in front of the Dragon Throne.

He raised his arm and received the worship of all the demon beasts.

The sudden voice caused his body to completely freeze.

All the humans and demon beasts looked towards the source of the voice.

On top of a Demon Beast Sculpture, a special demon beast was floating. It did not crouch down, but stood there straight.

It was seven to eight meters tall and had a humanoid upper body, while its lower body was covered with branches that looked like seaweed.

Its body was slightly slender, but it was not very eye-catching.

The leader of the blood barbaric demon beast slowly turned around and looked at AO xingmu, its eyes filled with endless killing intent.

Not long ago, the blood barbaric demon beasts were fighting against the bloodthirsty sea demon Lin and the other three races.

The Blood Barbaric Demon Beast race used their powerful strength to make the other two top-tier demon beasts submit.

Today, their blood barbaric demon beasts became the royal family, and they became the emperor of the wilderness. No one objected, and no demon beast race dared to oppose.

Now, at this critical moment, someone actually dared to ask, “Do we agree?”?

“The brightly colored algae Demon Beast Clan?”

At the position of the demon beasts below, all the demon beasts raised their bodies and stared at the brightly colored algae demon beast leader on the sculpture.

Some of the demon beasts were heading towards the position of the brightly colored algae demon beast clan.

They discovered that all the brightly colored algae demon beasts didn’t lower their bodies to show their submission. All of them were standing there.

“What’s going on? A Demon Beast clan doesn’t want to submit? That brightly colored algae demon beast clan wants to challenge the Blood Barbaric Demon Beast Clan? To challenge the throne?”

“Didn’t the demonic beast race go through a huge battle a long time ago? Why are there still demonic beast races that refuse to submit?”

In the surrounding area, tens of millions of humans were stunned when they saw the multi-colored algae demonic beast race that suddenly appeared in front of them.

Even the people from the blood emperor, the life and death forging workshop, the holy item forging workshop, and the third largest trading company in the world were stunned.

“This... this...”

At this moment, everyone from the Flowing Emperor Alliance recalled what Wang Xian had said to them. Their eyes were filled with excitement.

Watching a good show?

The Good Show had begun?

“The Demon Beast Race, the strong shall be the emperor. However, your colorful algae race wants to challenge my throne?”

The leader of the Blood Barbarian Demon Beast stared at Ao Xingmu with his blood-red eyes filled with killing intent as he growled.

“I don’t think you have the ability to be the emperor of the Wilderness!”

Ao Xingmu stared at the leader of the blood barbaric demon beasts and said indifferently.

“Haha, Good, good. You are just a small demon beast race, yet you dare to challenge the position of the Blood Barbaric Demon Beast Royal Race!”

“Blood barbaric demon beasts, Listen Up! Kill all the members of the colorful algae Demon Beast Race!”

“Roar, kill them!”

The leader of the Blood Barbaric Demon Beast clan commanded with a terrifying expression.

“Roar Roar!”

Below, a group of blood barbaric demon beasts stared at the multicolored algae Demon Beast clan with their bloody eyes and let out a terrifying roar.

“Challenge Our Blood Barbaric Demon Beast Imperial clan, challenge our blood barbaric emperor. You Bunch of damnable things are not qualified yet. Let Me Eat You!”

Below, a blood barbaric demon beast expert of the sixth level of the insightful void tier turned into a blood shadow and directly attacked Ao Xingmu.

“Eat them!”

The rest of the blood barbaric demon beasts charged toward the colorful algae demon beast race.

The brutal aura instantly filled the entire space.

The bloody smell condensed in the sky!

If they didn’t agree with each other, they would directly kill each other!

This was the Demon Beast Race, where the strong claimed the emperor.

“Leave no one alive!”

The leader of the Blood Barbaric Demon Beast stood in front of the dragon chair, staring at the area below with a cold face, and ordered with killing intent.

“Die!”

The level 6 insightful void Level Blood Barbaric Demon Beast drew a blood shadow and instantly appeared in front of AO xingmu. Its sharp claws directly tore at his body.

Ao Xingmu looked at the blood barbaric demon beast that was attacking him, and a smile appeared on his face.

The green vines on his lower body swayed, directly turning into thorns and attacking the blood barbaric demon beast.

“Break!”

The Blood Barbarian Demon Beast at the sixth level of the insightful void tier looked at the countless vines, and its eyes were filled with a crazy killing intent.

Its claws grew to ten meters long, leaving bloody marks.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

However, at this moment, countless roots seemed to grow under AO xingmu.

They condensed into a pair of terrifying palms and grabbed him.

The claws landed on the palms, leaving only traces of blood.

“With just the two of you, you can’t be called the Royal Demon Beast Race!”

Ao Xingmu stood there, looking at the Level 6 insightful void demonic beast expert that was grabbed by his 100-meter-large palm, his face didn’t have the slightest fluctuation.

He extended his emerald green arm, and an emerald green spear appeared in his palm.

His arm moved, and he directly stabbed towards the level 6 profound void demonic beast.

“Break for me, Roar Roar!”

The eyes of the blood barbaric demonic beast that was trapped in the palm revealed a shocked expression. It roared loudly, and many blood-colored snakes attacked towards the huge palm.

It wanted to break free from the shackles of the palm.

“No... leader, save me!”

However, when it saw that the blood-colored snakes only left faint traces on the palm, it finally panicked.

Looking at the long spear that was rapidly attacking it, it begged for mercy in fear.

“What?”

The leader of the blood barbaric demon beasts in front of the Dragon Chair saw that his clansmen who were of the same level as him were instantly trapped, and his face revealed a terrified expression.

“Break for me!”

His expression changed drastically. With a loud roar, a blood shadow that was a thousand meters long slashed directly at the emerald-green long spear.

Its body shook and turned into 15 meters in size as it attacked ao Xingmu. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Pu!”

When Ao Xingmu saw the attack from the leader of the Blood Barbarian Demon Beast, his expression did not change at all. With a shake of the spear, it instantly pierced through the sixth level insightful void Tier Blood Barbarian Demon Beast.

“Ah Ah!”

With a large hole in its body, the Blood Barbarian Demon Beast did not die immediately.

The blood on its body was squirming rapidly.

“Land and take root!”

At this moment, Ao Xingmu’s voice rang out. The emerald-green spear was growing rapidly like roots that had pierced into the soil.

The roots slowly covered the body of the Blood Barbarian Demon Beast, and its life force disappeared.

“Die!”

When the leader of the Blood Barbarian Demon Beast saw that its clansmen of the same level were killed, its eyes were filled with shock.

His body flashed, and thousands of shadows appeared in the sky, attacking ao Xingmu from all directions.

“The king of the wilderness belongs to me!”

Ao Xingmu looked at the blood shadows with a calm face. There was no fluctuation at all.

He slowly spread his arms, and countless roots covered the area behind him.

The area covered by the roots reached a radius of three to four thousand meters, and the blood-filled sky was covered.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

“Ah!”
