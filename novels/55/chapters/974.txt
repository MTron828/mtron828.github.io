Translator: 549690339

I’ll let you make the first move!

Qin Shan was wearing a pair of metal gloves and a black armor on his entire arm.

A faint flame rose from his arm as he stared at Wang Xian with a smile on his face.

His body was a little thin and weak, but he looked full of explosive power. His handsome face had a tough temperament.

Around the arena, a group of students were watching closely and cheering for Qin Shan.

He was born in a poor family, but he was unwilling to admit defeat. With his own hard work, he had achieved the first rank of the new students in the Demon Hunter College.

He was the best among all the students of the same level.

He could be said to be the model of the main character, the true son of heaven.

Wang Xian looked at Qin Shan and revealed a faint sneer. “Then I’ll make my move First!”

“Come on, Hehe!”

Qin Shan smiled faintly.

He was definitely going to get 400,000 middle-grade spirit stones!

Boom

At this moment, Wang Xian moved. He didn’t use any attributes. His five fingers formed into a claw and grabbed towards Qin Shan.

“Eh? You’re Pretty Fast!”

Qin Shan was astonished when he saw Wang Xian’s attack. His face was solemn.

Boom

In an instant, his arm was emitting terrifying flames. The Flames turned into a group of fiery-red snakes that coiled around his arm.

“Come on!”

His eyes were filled with fighting spirit as he went straight for Wang Xian’s Claw.

Boom

The fire snakes that were coiled around his arm charged forward. They opened their huge mouths and bit at Wang Xian’s Claw. Through the flames, Wang Xian could see the cold smile on Qin Shan’s face.

“Left arm!”

Wang Xian said indifferently as his claw suddenly accelerated.

“Bang!”

“What? Not Good!”

In an instant, Wang Xian’s claw directly crushed the fire snake that was almost solid. He clenched his fist tightly, causing his expression to change drastically.

Crack! Crack! Crack

Wang Xian turned his palm and the sound of breaking was heard.

“Hiss!”

Qin Shan felt the breaking of his left arm and his expression changed drastically. His forehead was instantly filled with cold sweat.

However, the tenacious him did not shout out as he sucked in a breath of cold air.

“Ah!”

“His arm is broken!”

However, when the crowd below saw their first move, Qin Shan’s arm was directly broken and deformed. The crowd of girls below cried out in surprise.

Even some of the boys’pupils could not help but constrict as they sucked in a breath of cold air.

Qin Qing’s expression changed drastically as she placed both her hands on the edge of the arena. Her face was filled with worry.

“Let go of me!”

Qin Shan roared as he clenched his right hand tightly. His fist transformed into a ferocious tiger and smashed towards Wang Xian.

Snake Soaring Tiger Roar!

This move was a supernatural ability!

Tiger like real tiger, Red Flame Real Tiger!

“You want to cripple my limbs?”

Wang Xian’s expression did not change as he extended his right hand.

Boom

The terrifying roar of the flames was extinguished as Wang Xian grabbed his right hand.

Crack! Crack! Crack

“Ah!”

His right arm was broken again. This time, Qin Shan couldn’t help but scream out in pain.

When everyone around saw that Qin Shan’s right arm was broken again, they were shocked.

“How... How is this possible? How can he be so strong!”

A girl who was cheering loudly earlier had a look of shock on her face as she mumbled in a daze.

“Stop!”

Qin Qing’s expression changed drastically as she shouted in a hurry.

“If people don’t provoke me, I won’t provoke them either. Four limbs, then four limbs!”

Qin Shan’s face was filled with cold sweat as he looked at Wang Xian in horror.

Both of his arms were grabbed and completely crippled. His body was trembling slightly.

“Bang!”

Wang Xian didn’t stop. I Won’t attack unless you attack me!

Since you want my four limbs, I want your four limbs as well.

Who cares who you are?

Good or bad!

You have to take responsibility for what you have done!

“Ah!”

Wang Xian stomped down and Qin Shan knelt heavily on the ground. His left leg was crippled.

“Stop!”

This time, Qin Qing, who was standing beside the arena, was completely flustered. Her body moved and she flew directly to the arena. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“What? You want to make a move too?”

Wang Xian glanced at Qin Shan who was half-kneeling in front of him. He looked at Qin Qing who was flying up and asked coldly.

“My younger brother has admitted defeat. Let My Younger Brother Go!”

Qin Qing’s expression changed as she gritted her teeth and said.

“Hehe, why didn’t you stop me just now?”

Wang Xian revealed a hint of mockery on his face as he moved his right leg.

“Bang!”

“Boom!”

“Ahhhh!”

Qin Shan’s pained cry was heard. Both of his legs knelt directly in front of Wang Xian as he let out a pained cry.

Wang Xian didn’t even look at him. He looked at Qin Qing and said, “He said that he wanted to cripple my four limbs, so I crippled his four limbs. I have no enmity with him. Now, it’s very fair!”

He smiled faintly and kicked Qin Shan to the ground.

“A trash like you still dares to ask for 400,000 spiritual stones?”

Wang Xian looked at Qin Shan, who was covered in cold sweat, and mocked him faintly.

“Xiao Shan!”

Qin Qing’s expression changed drastically. She quickly ran over and examined his four limbs.

“You... you... how is this possible?”

Qin Shan looked at Wang Xian in disbelief and felt his four limbs. His face was pale.

“Sister, sister, how... How are my four limbs?”

He asked in horror.

“It’s fine, it’s fine. As long as there are enough elixirs, it can be cured, it can be cured!”

Qin Qing’s eyes were slightly red as she spoke. Following that, she turned her head in anger and stared at Wang Xian with a trembling body. “You are so ruthless!”

“I repeat, he is the one who wanted to cripple my four limbs. If there is a next time, I can guarantee that he will be a dead person!”

Wang Xian frowned and said to her with a cold gaze.

Qin Qing bit her lips and stared at Wang Xian. She turned her head with an embarrassed expression.

She also knew that it was her younger brother who wanted to cripple his limbs this time.

However...

“He is so powerful. How could he be so strong!”

“Oh my God. He defeated Qin Shan in one move. He didn’t even have the ability to resist!”

“This... Qin Shan is the strongest student that was selected by the academy in the past two days. He is the leader of the first grade students, but his four limbs were instantly crippled. He doesn’t even have the strength to resist!”

The surrounding students had shocked expressions on their faces.

This was too fast. Their new student was instantly killed and his four limbs were easily crippled.

This made them feel that it was somewhat absurd and unbelievable.

“Luckily, luckily I didn’t make a move just now. His strength is at least at transcendent-level rank 4!”

When the team leader of Class 5 saw Qin Shan’s outcome, he wiped the cold sweat on his forehead. This was too fierce!

The first freshman had been instantly killed. If he were to go up, he would also be instantly killed.

“What powerful strength!”

“This strength... i. . .”

Around the arena, when the senior students saw this scene, they were also dumbstruck.

This strength seemed to be stronger than all of them

Within the Demon Hunter College, 10% of the students were at the peak of transcendent-level 2,60% were at transcendent-level 3,29% were at transcendent-level 4, the remaining 80-90 were at transcendent-level 5, and transcendent-level 6 could be counted with one’s bare hands!

Moreover, these transcendent-level 6 students were all students of the highest age, and among them, a few of them possessed bloodlines.

Only a few monstrous geniuses would normally cultivate to rank 6 transcendents.

In the entire star-moon kingdom, the Demon Hunter Academy’s rank 6 transcendents would rank in the top 50!
