2719 2,719 bad news about Tian Ya

As time passed, more than ten poisonous horned dragons had completely infiltrated into the world margin sect.

Furthermore, all of them were parasitic on some of the more core powerhouses of the world margin sect.

One of the most core parasites was the son of sect master Tian Ya.

War was cruel.

The world margin sect had once hunted down Qing Yue and Lingxiu and almost killed them. Wang Xian wanted revenge for this.

The Dragon Palace had killed so many experts from the world margin sect and turned them into stray dogs. If there was a chance, the world margin sect would destroy the Dragon Palace and kill the experts from the Dragon Palace.

Since there was a chance to destroy the world margin sect, Wang Xian would not show any mercy.

In the past few days, the disappearance of seven to eight teams that entered the abyss did not attract the attention of the world margin sect.

After all, there were still 60,000 to 70,000 undying god King level warriors in the entire world margin sect.

There was no news of the 1,000 to 2,000 god King Warriors entering the abyss, and no one cared.

However, eight days later, a world margin deacon and the son of an elder organized a gathering of 4,000 undying god King Warriors that entered the Abyss without any news.

On the 13th day, it attracted some attention from the world margin sect.

“Deacon Zhou Feng and the others have led over 4,000 world margin disciples, any response now?”

In a large hall on the planet where the world margin great sect was located, the world margin sect leader frowned as he asked the elders.

“No, there’s no news at the moment. There’s another piece of news, the disciples that have been to the abyss recently have no contact at all.”

An elder frowned.

Over the past 10 days, none of the disciples that went into the Abyss had returned, there was no contact at all.

This made them have a bad premonition in their hearts.

Entering the abyss to hunt the abyss species might be dangerous, but now that all of them had disappeared, such a strange thing, there seemed to be a huge hand behind it.

Most importantly, a few days ago, the 4 deacons had led over 4,000 undyings from the world margin sect into the Abyss to hunt an entire race, and now they had actually disappeared, without any connection at all.

Entering the abyss to hunt the abyssal seed, even though it wasn’t something that happened in a day or two, there was no news for 4 to 5 days, and they still couldn’t contact them, which made them have a bad premonition.

Especially since there was no news from any of the disciples who had left during this period, this bad premonition was even stronger.

“Send someone to investigate immediately. I have a bad premonition.”

Sect Master Tianya said with a dark face.

“Yes!”

Several elders nodded.

“In addition, all disciples are forbidden to enter the abyss during this period.”

Sect Master Tianya continued to give orders.

...

“Dragon King, this is our harvest this time.”

Time passed day by day again. The half a month agreed upon by Wang Xian and the poison department had arrived once again.

“There are five level nine abyss seeds of the immortal king, 40 level eight seeds, 100 level seven seeds, and 7,000 level eight seeds of the immortal king.”

Mo Sha grinned and continued.

“Very good.”

Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled and his face was full of smiles.

“You and poison nine continue to exchange for resources.”

He ordered immediately.

Mo Sha Poison nine nodded and flew directly towards the imperial court.

They were already very close to the imperial court. Flying for about 10 hours.

Following that, they would be getting closer and closer to the central region. The risk of hunting the abyss seeds would also become greater and greater.

At that time, they might still have to face human powerhouses.

“After the improvement of the poison-making department, its strength will almost double. It can even surround and attack peak-stage immortal king existences.”

Wang Xian mumbled as his eyes sparkled.

“Dragon King, with the addition of five level 9 immortal king powerhouses, I can now live on the elders of the world margin sect.”

At the side, Ba Qi said with a smile.

“How are things going with the world margin sect?”

Wang Xian asked him.

“The disappearance of over 6,000 undying godly monarchs has aroused their suspicion. Now, they forbid any disciples from entering the abyss. Only the parasitic elders can make a big move.”

Ba Qi said with a twinkle in his eyes.

“Hehe, alright. Let’s find an opportunity to see if we can destroy the two ancestors of the world margin sect.”

Wang Xian’s gaze was cold as he spoke.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Ba Qi nodded his head.

...

The subsequent elevation was very smooth. At the same time, in the dragon transformation pool in the Dragon Palace, some of the abyss species’corpses were sent to the Dragon Palace.

After they were sent here, they were immediately used to give birth to poisonous horned dragons.

5,000 poison horned dragon species were born, and all of them were raised to the undying God emperor level.

After which, these 5,000 poison horned dragon species came to the Abyss and joined Devil Demon’s team.

The entire Poison Department of the Dragon Palace was rising at a terrifying speed.

“Father, we still haven’t found news of our world margin sect’s deacon Zhou Feng and the others?”

In a study room of the horizon sect, a middle-aged man walked to the side of the old man in the center, poured him a cup of tea, and asked.

“No, there’s no news at the moment.”

The old man glanced at his son, shook his head, and said with a gloomy face, “Now we’re wondering if the Dragon Palace did it.”

“The Dragon Palace, it’s indeed possible. The Dragon Palace has a group of strange creatures hiding in the void. If they assassinate the experts of the Horizon sect, thousands of us will never be able to escape.”

The middle-aged man nodded and said indignantly.

...

“We are not sure whether the Dragon Palace will make a move or not. If it is really them, I, Tianya, will fight with the Dragon Palace to the death, no matter how great the price.”

The old man’s eyes were filled with killing intent as he took a sip of tea.

“It’s father. Even if we can’t kill the Dragon King, we have to kill all the people around the Dragon King...”

The middle-aged man nodded. Seeing the old man drink his tea, he pursed his lips and didn’t continue.

“Boom Boom Boom!”

At this moment, the surrounding space suddenly changed. Terrifying attacks attacked the old man one after another.

“Who is it? You’re courting death. How dare you attack me!”

The old man sensed the terrifying attacks coming at him. His expression changed drastically as he roared savagely.

However, when he stood up, his face suddenly turned pale as he felt a chaotic energy attacking his body.

“Old Thing, you still want our Dragon Palace to pay the price. Keke.”

At this moment, the middle-aged man next to him widened his eyes in disbelief.

How could his son say such words all of a sudden?

Also, was the chaotic energy in his body a poison?

Did his son betray the world margin sect?

He widened his eyes, full of anger and fear.

“Bang!”

However, before he could think further, a terrifying attack landed on his body. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

This made his consciousness a little absent-minded.

“The injury is a little severe, but fortunately, a drop of vitality liquid was born in the Moon Bay of the ancient pond of the Dragon Palace.”

At the end of his blurred consciousness, a voice sounded by his ear.
