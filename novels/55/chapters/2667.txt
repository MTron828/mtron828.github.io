2668 2668 quickly went to ask the experts of the Dragon Palace for help

“Three minutes. In just three minutes, he cleaned up the abyssal seeds on our side. Is this the strength of the Dragon Palace?”

“This is not the strength of the Dragon Palace. The strength of the Dragon Palace has not been fully displayed yet!”

When the Dragon Peak was traveling outside, the experts and disciples in this area looked at the rapidly disappearing dragon peak and sighed with emotion. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

One of the elders from last month’s great sect stared deeply at the silhouette of the Dragon Mountain. ,

the scene just now was too shocking to him.

Thinking back to a few days ago, their great sect had wanted the Dragon Palace to guard this place with them, now it seemed a little laughable.

The Dragon Palace didn’t agree, but they sent out undying level 9 warriors in this battle, killing countless abyss species, and even getting rid of two undying level 9 abyss species.

This achievement, this achievement, even their great sect didn’t do it last month right?

And, he was suspicious, was the Dragon Palace stronger than the great sect last month?

If the great sect had forced the Dragon Palace to defend last month, the result would have been extremely tragic!

“Gather all the disciples, we’ll go support the Central Region.”

Last month, the great sect elder exchanged glances with the warrior from the Dragon Python group and A Level 8 warrior from the Bei Chuan Sect, saying.

“Let’s go to the central area. The central area is the most tragic right now!”

The Beichuan sect elder nodded.

“The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace and the others should have also gone to our central area, right?”

Beside them, an expert from the grand cult from last month said suspiciously.

“All disciples, get ready and immediately go to the central area through the teleportation array.”

Last month, the grand cult elder immediately ordered.

Then, they immediately flew toward the teleportation array.

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz

The speed of teleportation was much faster than that of Dragon Peak. When they arrived at the central area, Dragon Peak hadn’t arrived yet.

“Eh? Third Elder, why are you all here?”

The middle-aged man who connected the lines here was slightly surprised when he saw the third elder leading more than ten million people to teleport over. He asked in astonishment.

“The Dragon Palace Dragon King led the Warriors to help us destroy all the abyssal seeds over there. Our side has been freed.”

The 3rd Elder from last month said.

“What? How is that possible? The leader said that the 3rd Elder’s side might be in danger because two undying level 9 abyssal seeds flew over, and now...”

The middle aged man was slightly shocked and asked in disbelief.

“The Dragon Palace Warriors have already destroyed it, alright, all disciples enter the battlefield, Fight!”

Last month, the third elder didn’t say anything more, looking at the intense central battlefield, his expression was slightly ugly.

Guarding this side, they had the most disciples and the most sacrifices last month.

This was also thanks to the fact that the Dragon Palace had liberated quite a few places, with tens of millions of people rushing over, they barely managed to hold off the abyssal seeds.

Now, with them, they should be able to stabilize the situation.

If the Dragon Palace’s Dragon Peak arrived, it would be the time for a massacre.

“Eh? Third brother, can you spare some hands to come and support us?”

Tens of millions of people rushed into the battlefield. When an elder of last month who was fighting in front saw it, his face lit up with joy, and he asked with some excitement and surprise.

“Hahaha, the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace led the powerhouses to finish off the abyssal seeds on our side!”

“All brothers hold on, we’ll help you.”

Last month’s third elder laughed loudly and roared.

“HM? What? The Dragon Palace actually destroyed the abyssal seed on third brother’s side, how is that possible?”

Some of the elders were slightly shocked, however this wasn’t the time to delve too much into it.

Ahead, there were many powerful abyssal seeds that needed to be dealt with.

And in the air above them, last month’s leader and 4 others were struggling against 6 undying level 9 abyss species.

They heard the voices below, their eyes filled with shock.

Did they just see 2 undying level 9 abyss species heading to the right?

Did they not attack the north?

Instead, they went somewhere else?

Rumble

At this moment, in front of the inviting Moon planet, the Dragon Peak flew past at a terrifying speed.

Wang Xian, who was standing on the command platform, took a glance at the situation over here and didn’t stop.

“That’s the Dragon Peak? They didn’t Stop?”

The middle-aged man who connected the call was slightly stunned when he saw the dragon peak flying past.

“This... The Dragon Palace has gone to support other places?”

On the battlefield, the third elder of the great sect had also noticed the dragon peak flying to the left last month. He was slightly stunned before he frowned.

...

“The Dragon King has to support our dragon Python group first.”

However, the Type 8 powerhouse of the Dragon Python group had also noticed Long Feng, and his eyes lit up with joy.

Although the northern front had united, they still hoped that their planet would suffer the least losses.

“Seems like giving the Dragon Palace 10% of the shares is the right choice. Even with their current strength, 10% is still too little!”

The Type 8 powerhouse muttered.

“Master, the battle line here is extremely tense.”

After flying past the domain of last month’s great religion, the front of the planet appeared in sight.

Because of the sudden appearance of the abyss species, every place was in a dire state.

In the void ahead, there were already millions of human corpses floating there.

The two level 8 powerhouses of the Dragon Python Group, the Beichuan Sect’s patriarch and the two elders of the great sect from last month were guarding this area.

However, their opponents had seven Level 8 undying godly monarch abyss seeds, and their numbers completely suppressed them.

...

The five level 8 undying godly monarch powerhouses were completely suppressed by the abyss seeds.

“Hunt!”

Wang Xian squinted his eyes slightly and gave an order.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

At this moment, Mou Zesen pulled the bowstring fully and shot out over a thousand arrows in a second.

The rest of the members of the Heavenly Eye Arrow Division also shot out arrows.

“It’s the powerhouse from the Dragon Palace. It’s the Dragon King.”

“The powerhouse from the Dragon Palace is here!”

An excited voice was heard. Even though they didn’t know that the Dragon Palace had killed two level 9 immortal god King abyssal seeds.

However, they still trusted the strength of the Dragon Palace.

“Sou Sou Sou!”

However, the next scene made them look exactly the same as the other disciples.

Seven level 8 abyssal seeds were turned into corpses under the barrage of arrows.

The two level 8 Dragon Python Group Elders, the Beichuan sect elder and the two great sect elders from last month were stunned. Their pupils dilated slowly.

“Our Dragon Palace will take care of this. You guys should recuperate and rest.”

Wang Xian swept his gaze over and said faintly.

Gulp

The five powerhouses swallowed a mouthful of saliva and continued to look ahead in a daze.

The rest of them were also stunned. Their battlefield had turned into a slaughterhouse.

...

“Oh no, Old Feng, be careful.”

“Block it. Work together to block it. Don’t let this beast pin US down.”

However at this time, at the center of the battlefield, a crisis suddenly occurred.

Last month’s leader and 4 others were fighting against 6 undying level 9 abyss species.

However all of a sudden, 3 undying level 9 abyss species were madly attacking last month’s leader and the other 2 ancestors.

And the other 3 were madly attacking the last last last month’s leader.

The situation changed!
