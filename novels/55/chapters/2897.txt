Chapter 2898: might of the Dragon Palace

“Boss Wang, Bring Me along! Bring me along!”

The next morning, Wang Xian’s Heaven Formation and the Nine Divine Wind Dragons were preparing to head to the eight desolates and six harmonies in front of the teleportation formation of the Dragon Palace.

This time, the eight desolates and six harmonies were in front of them. Even if the experts from the eight desolates and six harmonies were still there, it was enough for them to head there.

When Invincible in combat got the news, he immediately flew over and asked Wang Xian with a grin.

“What are you going over there for? To see your girlfriend?”

Wang Xian looked at him and asked mockingly.

“Hehe, although we are not in a relationship, it’s about time!”

Invincible battle technique said with a smile.

“Alright, let’s Go!”

Wang Xian nodded and stepped into the teleportation formation.

Invincible battle technique immediately followed closely behind.

The nine divine wind dragons and the Heaven Formation also followed immediately.

Buzz

When they reappeared, they had already arrived at the edge of the Holy Region and were close to the Heaven Punishment Ancient Heaven region.

“Let’s Go!”

The nine wind divine dragons moved their bodies and immediately transformed into divine dragons.

Roar! Roar

Low roars sounded and the nine wind divine dragons flew directly into the sky.

A Dragon sedan appeared beside Wang Xian.

Wang Xian moved his body and stood on top of it.

“Dragon Chariot!”

Invincible battle technique’s eyes lit up. His eyes were filled with excitement.

“Kid, stand aside!”

Heaven Array said to invincible battle technique.

“Alright, Alright, I know!”

Invincible battle technique smiled and nodded.

Naturally, he could not sit inside the dragon chariot. Not to mention whether the Dragon King would agree or not, even the nine wind divine dragons had their own dignity.

As the Dragon King’s personal ride, other than the Dragon King, even the Dragon Queens would have to inform the Dragon King in advance if they wanted to sit in it.

The arrogance of the divine dragons still existed.

Invincible in battle techniques, he also knew that as a level two divine emperor, it was already good enough for a peak divine dragon in the universe to carry him.

He stood in front of the dragon carriage with his head held high and his chest puffed out, his gaze sweeping the surroundings.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

A few divine dragons let out a roar and flew at a terrifying speed in the direction of the desolate land.

“Those are nine divine dragons. The Dragon King is coming!”

“Where are they going? The desolate land? Are they going to destroy the desolate land?”

“Nine divine dragons pulling a dragon palanquin. Hiss! The Dragon King should be out patrolling!”

On a planet not far away, a group of experts and disciples from the Holy Region looked in the direction of the Dragon’s Roar in shock. They guessed in confusion.

“What terrifying speed!”

However, in the blink of an eye, the nine divine dragons pulled the dragon palanquin and disappeared from their sight! Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Soon, the news of the nine divine dragons pulling the dragon palanquin to the heaven punishment ancient sky region spread throughout the holy region.

The entire holy region’s AI was discussing again.

“Roar Roar!”

In the vast starry sky, the nine divine dragons were pulling the dragon palanquin. The various demonic beasts and desolate beasts in the starry sky immediately retreated far away when they sensed the aura.

The speed of the wind divine dragons was very fast, especially under the leadership of the two divine emperor level two wind divine dragons. According to Wang Xian’s estimation, it would take at most ten days to cross the Heaven Punishment Ancient Heaven region by flying.

“Urgh, this speed is too fast. I can’t see anything.”

Invincible battle technique stood in front of the Dragon sedan and squinted his eyes.

If not for the wind god Dragon resisting the impact of the speed, his body would have collapsed under this speed.

“Hehe!”

At the side, Heaven’s formation looked at him and smiled. He waved his arm and said, “I’ll give you a little toy.”

“What?”

Invincible battle technique took it and looked at the mirror-like object. He held it in front of him and looked at it.

“Wow, this is a good thing. Thank you, Grandpa Tian Chen!”

Invincible battle technique played with the mirror and showed an excited expression.

Through the mirror, he could see a very distant place and slow down the surrounding scenery.

“Hehe!”

Tiancheng smiled faintly and stood at the side with his eyes narrowed.

Invincible looked left and right with the mirror.

“Dragon King, we are about to enter the heaven’s punishment ancient Heaven’s domain. Should we fly there directly or through the teleportation formation?”

Two days later, Tiancheng asked Wang Xian.

“Let’s go through the teleportation formation!”

In the Dragon sedan, Wang Xian was nurturing the five elements millstone. He pondered for a moment and said.

Although the teleportation formation was a little troublesome, it was faster than flying directly.

It could save about half of the time.

“It’s the Dragon King. Dragon King, just sit in the Dragon sedan. There’s no need for you to come out.”

The Heaven Formation nodded and replied.

“Ao Feng, I’ll send you a route. We’ll go from the planet’s teleportation formation!”

The Heaven Formation spoke to boss Feng Shenlong.

“Okay!”

Ao feng nodded.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

Soon, a message was sent to Ao Feng’s mind. He looked around.

“Go to the planet on the left.”

After sending a message to his brothers and sisters, the nine wind god Dragons flew directly to the nearest planet.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

When the life-form planet appeared in front of them, the Nine Wind God Dragons roared and instantly arrived above the planet.

With a sweep of their minds, they sensed the location of the teleportation array and moved.

“Buzz!”

The next moment, they appeared above the teleportation array.

The huge figure formed a shadow below.

“What is that?”

“Hiss, what is this thing? What a terrifying power!”

“Oh no, is this a space beast? Be careful, be careful!”

“What is this? There’s actually a palanquin behind them!”

The sudden appearance of the nine wind divine dragons made everyone on this planet look nervous and terrified.

“Dragon King, when you travel, the area ahead will be desolate. Let me borrow your teleportation formation!”

Compared to other star fields, the information in the heaven punishment ancient sky field was even more outdated. The Heaven Formation stood beside the dragon palanquin and said, its voice spreading around the teleportation formation.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

“Greetings, Lord Dragon King! Greetings, Lord Dragon King!”

“We’ll clear the teleportation formation immediately. It’s our honor for Lord Dragon King to be able to come to our planet!”

In the next moment, many experts flew out from the rooms below with faces full of fear and respect.

They bowed their bodies and called out respectfully.

They were just short of kneeling down.

“There’s no need to go through so much trouble!”

The sky array said. The nine wind god Dragons moved and flew towards the teleportation formation.

The teleportation formation on every planet took up a large area. However, the nine wind god Dragons were too terrifying.

They shrunk their bodies slightly and fell towards the teleportation formation.

Buzz

They were surrounded by energy and teleported according to the route.

Soon, their figures slowly disappeared.

It had been less than a minute since they arrived and left.

“Divine dragons, those are the nine divine dragons of the Dragon Palace. The one in the Dragon sedan must be the Dragon King.”

“That power is too terrifying. Is this the power of the Dragon Palace? Is this the power of the Divine Dragons?”

“The nine divine dragons are pulling the Dragon sedan. Are they heading to the eight desolates and six directions to destroy the eight desolates?”

At the side, more than ten experts roared in low voices with faces full of shock.
