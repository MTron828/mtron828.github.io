2655 2655 swept down with his sword

“The selection of the empress dowager is about to begin!”

“There are only six women in the top 20. I wonder who will receive the title of Empress Dowager!”

“The one with the most hope is naturally the emperor in plain clothes. The strength of the goddess in plain clothes is publicly recognized!”

“I heard that the elder in plain clothes often gives her pointers. It’s because she thinks highly of her. The goddess in plain clothes should have reached the level of an eternal God Lord Tier 7!”

“That woman named Liangyi is a big black horse. She had a lot of battle experience during the battle just now.”

“The Imperial Star Lady. The Imperial Star Lady Can’t be ignored either. This time, she seems to have brought a leader of a force. The leader of that force is also the master of the Frost Goddess.”

The selection of the Imperial Star Lady began. Everyone in the surroundings widened their eyes as they watched, and one by one, they began to discuss.

The selection of the Empress was about to begin, causing the surroundings to boil with excitement.

They analyzed the six girls one by one.

Among the six girls, four of them were heaven’s favorites who lived in the vast palace and possessed the best resources in the Imperial Star Field.

The other two were the empress and the Dark Horse Girl.

Di Suyi was the most popular, and many people thought that she could become the empress.

Although the Empress was a top star in the imperial star field, these core disciples of the imperial court didn’t care about celebrities at all, and they were even ashamed of themselves.

“I heard that the Empress is very strong. Among the six of them, you may be the only one worthy to be my opponent!”

In the arena, Di Suiqian turned his body slightly, completely ignoring the other four female disciples, and stared at the Empress.

“Eh?”

At the side, the expressions of three of the women changed slightly. They were somewhat embarrassed by di Suqian’s contempt.

The other woman looked at him expressionlessly, slightly clenching the longsword in her hand.

“Eh? It seems that di Suqian thinks highly of Di Xingnu.”

“It’s said that Di Xingnu’s strength isn’t weak either. She’s already a star, and she doesn’t lack resources. It’s just that I didn’t expect di Suqian to think so highly of her.”

Some people around were slightly surprised when they saw this scene.

“Di Suyi, I’ve long heard of your name!”

The Empress looked at her with a faint smile on her face. She looked in the direction of the group of princes and her gaze paused on di haosong for two seconds.

“However, with your strength, you’re still a lot weaker!”

She raised her head slightly and her gaze slowly swept across all the women around her and the sixteen young men who were thousands of meters away from them.

“Ji-ji!”

As soon as she finished speaking, the dragon blood sword appeared in her hand and let out an incomparably cold voice.

“Imperial Star Lady, you’re a little arrogant!”

Di Su pretended to hear her words and her gaze turned cold. She, Di Su, had always been superior among the women of the imperial court.

This was the first time someone had looked down on her.

With a shake of her arm, a snow-white sharp sword also appeared in her hand!

“Let’s do it together and save some time!”

The corners of Imperial Star Lady’s mouth curled up slightly as her gaze swept across the surroundings!

“Clang!”

In the next moment, the dragon blood sword in her hand moved and directly covered everyone in the surroundings.

“Imperial Star Lady, you are too arrogant. You actually want to challenge all of us by yourself.”

At the side, the expressions of the four women changed slightly when they saw imperial star lady’s attack enveloping all of them. They shouted sternly.

“This... This emperor star lady is so arrogant. She actually wants to take on five of us by herself.”

“Arrogant. To be able to reach the top 20, the difference in strength isn’t that great. She actually dares to challenge five of us.”

The faces of the 16 youths in the surroundings turned cold when they saw the emperor star lady directly attacking the five ladies.

“What! Her energy is actually enveloping us as well!”

However, in the next moment, what shocked everyone was that the fiery red sword light was also enveloping them.

Now, they suddenly understood what di Xingnu had said.

Let’s save some time together!

Was she trying to save the strength to fight against them?

Was she confident that she could challenge the nineteen of them alone?

“Arrogant and arrogant, you don’t know what you’re talking about.”

Di hunge, who was in the middle, had a cold expression on her face. Her face was instantly filled with killing intent.

Was she looking down on them.

“Di Xingnu, are you looking for a fight?”

Di Ming, who was at the side, was also stunned. He immediately shouted.

“Block this sword of mine first.”

Di Xingnu’s sword wasn’t very fast. In fact, in order to deliberately show off her strength, the speed of this sword was very, very slow.

...

“What does Emperor Star want to do? Does she think that she can fight the other nineteen people alone?”

“That’s not right. Look at the power of her sword.”

Everyone in the surroundings was in an uproar. However, some of the experts in front of them could sense that something was wrong.

They were all experts, so they could clearly sense the power of Emperor Star’s sword.

This shocked them.

“No, her sword is so powerful.”

At this moment, Di Suyi and the others, who were closest to her, sensed the terrifying power contained in Empress Star’s sword. They were shocked!

“So powerful.”

The Dark Horse woman had a grave expression on her face.

“Break for me.”

Di Suyi’s face was full of panic. She swung her snow-white sword forward.

...

“Block it.”

The other women gritted their teeth and immediately took out their weapons to block it.

“Not good.”

“She’s very strong.”

“How is this possible?”

The flaming sword aura arrived at the fourteen youths.

When they felt the might of the flaming sword, their expressions changed drastically.

“Boom Boom Boom!”

In the next moment, everyone’s expressions turned ugly as they released all their strength to block it.

“Bang!”

“Crack Crack Crack!”

“Oh no!”

“How can she be so strong!” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The sound of collision and the sound of disbelief rang out, and all the attacks that met the celestial lady’s attack instantly collapsed.

The Flaming Sword Ray of the dragon blood sword continued to sweep towards them.

“Dodge.”

The nineteen young men and women hurriedly dodged to the back in fear, their expressions constantly changing.

Because star Empress deliberately slowed down the sword light, the nineteen people’s faces were somewhat pale as they retreated from the range of the flaming sword light.

“It’s just one sword!”

There was no one around star Empress. She stood there, looking down on the nineteen young men and women, and said indifferently.

Indeed, it was just one sword!

With her current strength as a peak eternal God Lord, she could kill all of these strongest eternal God lord rank seven disciples with one sword if she wanted to.

“Hiss, peak god Lord!”

Her words caused the nineteen young men who had escaped to take in a deep breath of cold air. They stared at her with fear and shock on their faces.

Peak God Lord, and Emperor Star Lady had the strength of a peak god Lord.

With such strength, she was much, much stronger than them.

“This... how can emperor star lady be so strong?”

“Peak god Lord, she’s actually a peak god Lord. It’s been a long time since our emperor star field had such a powerful disciple.”

And in the surroundings, one after another, incomparably shocking voices rang out.
