2619 Dragon Peak 2619 arrived

Countless abyssal seeds gathered at the front, and among them, there was a steady stream of abyssal seeds rushing over!

A portion of the abyssal seeds that were killed were taken away by humans, and a portion was devoured by the abyssal seeds!

After these abyssal seeds were devoured, their strength received a huge increase!

By devouring humans, they also received a significant increase!

This method was akin to raising a Gu!

The weak would be eliminated while the strong would become stronger!

“Master!”

“We have finally resolved this crisis. The strength of the abyssal seeds is getting harder and harder!”

Bei Shuang flew over and said to Wang Xian with a smile on her face!

“On the battlefield, we can also quickly hone our strength and increase our strength a lot faster!”

Wang Xian said with a smile!

With sufficient resources, it was easier for the human powerhouses to break through in battle!

The abyssal seeds could nourish their combat strength through battle, and the humans could do the same!

However, in terms of efficiency, the humans were much weaker than the abyssal seeds!

This was the talent of a race!

“Eh, our elder bei Shuang is very respectful to that young man? Who is that young man?”

“I don’t know. He is not an expert from our bei Chuan sect. Elder bei Shuang even lowered his head slightly in front of that young man!”

“Who is that young man?”

All the Bei Chuan sect disciples who were flying towards the planet saw bei Shuang standing respectfully in front of Wang Xian. Their faces were filled with shock!

“Elder Gong, who is that young man? Elder bei Shuang is actually so respectful!”

Even the Immortal King Level Beichuan sect experts looked at Wang Xian in shock!

They could not help but ask elder Gong!

“It’s bei Shuang’s Master!”

Elder Gong looked at the young man who looked extremely young. He could even sense the aura of the young man. His eyes sparkled!

“Bei Shuang’s master? He is bei Shuang’s Master?”

“Dragon King of the Dragon Palace? Level 7 immortal King!”

“I didn’t expect bei Shuang to be so respectful in front of her master. Elder bei Shuang’s current strength is no weaker than her master!”

“Elder bei Shuang is a person who values friendship!”

The Immortal King experts were discussing!

“Let’s go and get to know each other!”

After elder Gong said that, he immediately flew towards Wang Xian and the rest!

“Elder bei Shuang, this must be your master, the Dragon King!”

Elder Gong flew to the front and asked with a smile!

“Yes, Elder Gong, this is my master!”

Bei Shuang nodded her head!

“Hello, Elder Gong!”

Wang Xian nodded his head faintly at him!

“Haha, Thank You, Dragon King, for imparting the cultivation method to bei Shuang, making her shine once again!”

Elder gong sized up Wang Xian and said!

“It’s her talent that’s better!”

Wang Xian nodded politely!

“Elder, sect master and the rest are here!”

At this moment, an immortal godly king said!

“Huh?”

“Sect master!”

“Patriarch!”

Everyone turned around and saw more than ten figures flying over!

When they saw sect master and the rest, they immediately shouted!

“HMM, who are these people?”

Sect Master Beichuan looked at Wang Xian and the rest and asked curiously!

“Sect master, this is my master!”

Bei Shuang immediately introduced!

“Oh? This is the Dragon King? Haha, it’s a pleasure to meet you. It’s Shuang ‘ER’s luck to meet the Dragon King!”

...

A hint of surprise flashed across sect Master Beichuan’s eyes. Following that, he cupped his hands and said with a smile!

“You’re Too Kind, Sect Master of Beichuan sect!”

Wang Xian cupped his hands and replied!

“During the war, there were a lot of things to do. I Can’t entertain the Dragon King. I’m sorry. If the crisis on the demon island can be resolved, I’ll definitely entertain the Dragon King Well!”

The sect Master of Beichuan sect said with a smile!

Wang Xian shook his head and exchanged a few pleasantries with him!

“Elder gong, Shuang ‘er, after the war, take out all the abyss seeds and distribute them to your disciples!”

After exchanging a few pleasantries, sect Master Beichuan got down to business. He looked at Elder Gong and the others and said!

“Oh? Sect master, take out all of them?”

Elder Gong was slightly shocked and immediately asked!

“Take out all the fallen disciples and our sect will take out subsidies from other places. Give all the abyssal seed crystals to the disciples and let them cultivate!”

...

Sect Master Beichuan nodded heavily and said!

“The other factions have also implemented this. Based on these few battles, we can already see that the abyssal seeds inside are nurturing the battle. The weaker ones will die and be devoured. The stronger ones will become stronger and stronger!”

“We will also take out all the abyssal seed crystals and let all the disciples improve!”

A Beichuan sect master beside him said!

“Yes!”

Elder gong and the rest nodded their heads!

“Leader of the Beichuan sect, our Dragon Palace would like to send some powerhouses over. We would like to hunt some abyss seeds to obtain some crystals. Is there any problem?”

Wang Xian looked at the leader of the Beichuan sect and said!

“Oh? The powerhouses of the Dragon Palace are coming over? Of course, we welcome them. The number of abyss seeds in the abyss can be killed more and more. We also welcome anyone to come over. This way, we can reduce our burden!”

The leader of the Bei Chuan Sect said with a smile!

“Alright, I will send my disciple over in a few days. At that time, the Dragon Palace will be free to move about!”

Wang Xian nodded his head!

“You are most welcome, Dragon King. I have to go to other places to inform them. Sorry, I can’t accompany them!”

As the leader of the Bei Chuan Sect said that, he led the group and left!

“According to the information from the Dragon Palace, there are many level 7 immortal king powerhouses. I wonder how many powerhouses will be sent over!”

The bei Chuan clan leader and the rest flew forward, an elder beside said!

“They probably won’t be able to send many, they just want to take the chance to get some abyss seed crystals, however it won’t affect us much!”

An elder beside said!

“Xiao Shuang this child is too respectful towards the Dragon King!”

The bei Chuan clan leader beside suddenly said!

“There’s nothing we can do about it, but we have to think of a way to keep bei Shuang in the Bei Chuan clan. Grandfather, why don’t we open the mystic realm and let Shuang ‘er enter!”

The Patriarch of the Bei Chuan clan pondered for a moment and said!

“Open the mystic realm? Okay, although it will consume a lot of energy, we have to let Shuang ‘er know that the bei Chuan clan has given a lot to her!”

The patriarch beside him nodded slowly!

...

“Ao Jian, inform Prime Minister Gui to send someone over!”

In the palace where bei Shuang was located, Wang Xian instructed ao Jian who was beside him!

“It’s the Dragon King, Dragon King. Ao Yao contacted me just now. He obtained a life planet and the people on it have escaped. It’s not too far away from us. We should be able to fly there in three to four hours!”

Ao jian nodded and said!

“Is that so? Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian’s face lit up and he stood up immediately! ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

With a life planet, he could build a dragon palace here. As long as he built it, he would be able to teleport over immediately through the teleportation formation!

This way, it would be much more convenient for the Dragon Palace to move!

Moreover, after obtaining the abyssal seed, they could directly teleport to the main dragon palace through the Dragon Palace. They could quickly increase the strength of the members of the Dragon Palace, and they would not have to fly back and forth!
