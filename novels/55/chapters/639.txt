Chapter 640: People From Xia Cauldron World

Wow!

After he swam out from the bottom of the sea, Wang Xian noticed the yacht in ruin.

A hole was found at the head of the yacht, but no water seeped in. Sailing with it was still possible.

The ship from Century Ghost Group that we saw was made from Level 7 materials. When there’s a chance, I shall look for some material to build my own!

Wang Xian pondered to himself as he looked ahead while the yacht continued to move on.

“Someone is here!”

After traveling for more than ten kilometers, a ship appeared in their sight.

The opposite ship was apparently traveling in the same direction as they were.

...

“This is interesting. I’ve realized this world is rather interesting. Haha!”

At this moment, fifteen men stood on the deck of that boat. They looked into the distance, exhibiting pride on their faces from the bottom of their hearts.

Out of the ten men, the eldest was in his forties while another five ladies looked like in their thirties.

They spoke Mandarin, wearing peculiar clothing with long hair regardless of gender. Beside them stood eight ladies looking frightful in their swimsuits.

These ten-odd people exuded a faint demonic aura, which made them look devilish.

“Tsk, look at this babe. Even though her look is average, the way that she is dressed is rather common in the real world. Such a beautiful world. For the past four hundred years, no one from the Xia Cauldron World entered the real world. Four hundred years! I was almost bored to death in that little world!”

A middle-aged man wet his lips as he looked ahead with an evil charm.

“We must enjoy ourselves in this world these next few days. Despite the air over here being filthy, it’s more exciting and interesting!”

A young man reached out his hand and hugged a babe in his arm, caressing the girl all over with excitement!

“After our world descends into the real world, we can enjoy ourselves again. Sect Leader did not deplete so much of his energy just so that we could come out and have fun!” a middle-aged man who stood in the middle said to them plainly.

“Senior Brother, aren’t we doing serious business now? Currently, our strength in that world was too weak since all the resources were exhausted!” a young man said with a smile.

“The Xia Cauldron World was, after all, too small. Even though this world is lacking in Spiritual Energy, there are many locations with hidden resources. Some of it was even better than our world!”

The middle-aged man in the center surveyed the surroundings as he spoke slowly.

“The ocean, indeed. Those creatures in the sea were already an incredible resource.”

“We must get hold of more information on this world before other worlds descend into the real world. We should occupy some treasure grounds first!”

“This place is comparable to our resources in Xia World a few thousand years ago. If we can take control of the disordered region, this will mark a great achievement for the Immortal Sect!”

“Since the remaining worlds have not descended, it’ll be a piece of cake to control this place!”

Everyone revealed strong confidence with their lips curled slightly. One of them looked behind and said, “Senior brother, there’s a ship behind us. Should we take them down first?”

“Don’t bother. Wait till it gets here and we’ll take it down once and for all!”

The middle-aged man in the center swept a glance behind him and remarked coldly.

“You’re right. We don’t have to waste our time on this!”

A young man chuckled as he sat in a chair leisurely and beckoned to the babes beside him!

Wang Xian withdrew his gaze from that boat and looked ahead.

Over there, the island slowly came into sight.

It was like a ghost island within this pitch-black sea region.

The yacht was moving fast. When Wang Xian arrived, he saw the ship that was ahead of him just now had already docked at the shore.

More than a dozen ships surrounded that boat.

“Disordered island!”

Wang Xian looked ahead and spotted a gigantic boulder erected with a couple of letters on it.

Beside the boulder stood two ferocious-looking middle-aged men, baring their arms and staring at them with cold gazes.

“They must be the men from Devil Kid!”

Wang Xian jumped off from his boat while over thirty Dragonians and Mo Qinglong followed behind him.

“You may enter, but don’t make trouble. Otherwise, we’ll kill you for sure!”

Two middle-aged men from Devil Kid reminded the gang coldly at the entrance.

Wang Xian nodded nonchalantly as he stalked straight in.

The not-so-huge island spanned a radius of five kilometers with many places filled with rugged rocks.

There were no trees on the island which made it even bleaker.

Conversations were heard from the island.

Wang Xian walked along a road and saw luxurious houses at the end of the road.

There were five thousand people in the houses, and some of them were making trades. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Men from Devil Kid were constantly patrolling around the area.

Wang Xian went in with eyes flickering with blue and red radiance. He looked around the place where the trading was taking place.

“48 Half-Step to Dan Realm experts, 15 Dan Realm experts, and only 2 Budding Realm experts!”

“Not bad for the disordered region. There are many experts over here. Given such a strength, it’s compelling for international standards!”

Wang Xian quirked his lips. Taking in this group of people would significantly enhance the strength of Dragon Sect.

“Hur?”

At this moment, Wang Xian squinted his eyes as he stared at a group of fifteen standing by the side.

Fifteen people were standing there, looking ahead without any concern. They were surveying every one with arrogance.

“Fifteen Budding Realm experts. Fifteen of them!”

Wang Xian was taken aback and surprised, as that strength was terrifying.

“All of them have long hair, even the guys. Their clothes look similar to those of Yong Chang world!”

Wang Xian’s eyes were beaming with radiance. Ancient clothes with long hair...

“Could it be?”

A tinge of seriousness welled in Wang Xian’s eyes. Could it be that one of the Nine Cauldron Worlds had descended into the real world?

What are they doing here?

Wang Xian furrowed his brows, but soon, he relaxed them. “Regardless of whether they have descended into the real world, I should subdue this place first. Control the entire disordered region and enhance the strength of Dragon Palace and Dragon Sect!”

Wang Xian drew his lips and walked forward, looking at each of the trading shops.

“Senior brother, there are only two Budding Realm experts here. When are we striking?” a young man asked the Senior brother in the center with a smile.

“Didn’t a fellow say there will be several large wandering groups here for trading too? Let’s wait until they are here. Be patient!”

“In the past, all the forces had to bow down to us wherever we were near the various Immortal Sects. Back then, only the experts from Europe could match up against us. Now it’s time for them to succumb to us!”

The middle-aged man looked around and commented plainly.

“All of them shall bow down to us. Wait till our master’s arrival!”
