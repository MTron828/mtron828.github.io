Chapter 961: 0962, a terrifying new student

Translator: 549690339

The thirteen people in luxurious armor stared at Wang Xian with displeasure. Their faces gradually darkened.

Especially the middle-aged man on the left. He raised his eyebrows coldly.

With their status, status, and strength, who wouldn’t give them face in Donghai City?

The Kid in front of them actually told them to scram? Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

No matter how good their tempers were, they still looked at this young man with dissatisfaction.

“Hehe, don’t challenge my patience. Scram!”

When Wang Xian saw that more than ten members of the mercenary group dared to surround him, a hint of coldness flashed across his eyes.

“Kid, you’re really arrogant!”

The corner of the middle-aged man’s mouth curled up slightly. A playful look appeared on his face as he slowly walked toward Wang Xian.

Wang Xian looked at the middle-aged man.

His silver-white armor shone brightly under the sunlight. There was a black ‘lie’character on his chest. He raised his head slightly and looked at the middle-aged man.

Wang Xian looked at the middle-aged man and smiled. He stood up with a smile on his face. “What?”

“What? I’m going to educate you!”

The middle-aged man chuckled. His body suddenly moved and transformed into numerous shadows. He attacked Wang Xian at a terrifying speed.

Seeing this scene, a ferocious look flashed across elder Xiao’s eyes. He lowered his head slowly and his face gradually turned ferocious.

“With just you?”

Wang Xian saw the middle-aged man’s figure and a mocking look appeared on his face. He moved his arm.

Boom

Scorching flames instantly covered his arm. His entire arm turned into two to three meters in size.

The middle-aged man’s body was instantly grabbed by Wang Xian. The terrifying flames caused his expression to change drastically.

“This...”

The middle-aged man widened his eyes as he looked at the palm that was grabbing onto him. His eyes revealed a look of horror.

The faces of the twelve middle-aged men behind him changed slightly.

“Stop!”

The green-armored old man who was standing at the front had a solemn expression. His body moved and appeared in front of Wang Xian in an instant.

A terrifying aura came over. The terrifying pressure caused the expressions of everyone around to change drastically.

“Let Go!”

The green-armored elder stared at Wang Xian coldly as he spoke in a deep voice.

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly and looked at the Elder. He said coldly, “It seems like all of you want to Die Here!”

“Huh?”

The green-armored Elder’s expression changed slightly as he stared at Wang Xian with a burning gaze.

“What an arrogant brat. He wants all of us to die here. Haha, then let us see if you have the qualifications to speak to us like this!”

Another white-haired old man grunted angrily and came to the side of the green-armored old man. A strong murderous aura emanated from his body.

The other ten men also emitted a terrifying pressure and surrounded Wang Xian and the rest.

“You’re courting death. You’re really courting death!”

“Kill this bastard brat. He spoke rudely and arrogantly!”

“He’s courting death. How dare he provoke a bunch of adults!”

Behind them, a group of people from the Chamber of Commerce and the mercenary group stared at Wang Xian and the rest coldly. Their eyes were filled with both shock and anger as they shouted loudly from behind.

One of their hands grabbed onto the body of an expert. This strength was a little terrifying!

“The strength of this group of people is not lower than level six of the extraordinaire. For that Brat to be able to capture one of them so easily, his strength is not weaker than level seven of the extraordinaire. No wonder he was able to kill Deputy Captain Ling and the rest!”

Elder Xiao and supervisor Du’s expressions changed. “However, since he dared to provoke this group of powerhouses, he is simply courting death!”

“Such an ungrateful kid. Sir, teach them a good lesson!”

The two of them echoed as they spoke to the green-armored elder and the rest.

“A bunch of scoundrels. Not long ago, I let all of you off. This time, it won’t be as simple as that...”

Wang Xian’s gaze swept across the group of people who were shouting arrogantly behind him. His eyes revealed a cold expression.

“If we have anything to say, we can talk it out...”

When Father Zhou saw this situation, his forehead was filled with cold sweat. He hurriedly spoke loudly.

However, everyone ignored him.

A terrifying aura slowly condensed from Wang Xian’s body. A murderous aura condensed as the strength and flames in his hands slowly rose.

The face of the middle-aged man who was held by Wang Xian changed drastically. He felt that the other party could kill him at any time.

“Wait...”

At this moment, a panicked voice was heard. A figure hurriedly ran to the center of Wang Xian and the group of people in front of him.

He looked at the group of the green-armored elder and his gaze landed on the only woman among them.

The woman had short hair and exuded a vigorous aura. She held a short sword in her hand and looked valiant and valiant.

“Teacher Bai Wen, it’s a misunderstanding. It’s all a misunderstanding!”

Jin Liuyan quickly shouted at the woman.

“Huh?”

The woman holding the short sword was slightly stunned. She raised her eyebrows and looked at Jin Liuyan. “Who are you?”

“I’m a student of the East Ocean Academy. Teacher Bai Wen, I know you!”

Jin Liuyan said hurriedly and looked at Wang Xian.

Wang Xian was slightly puzzled and the strength in his hand loosened a little.

“A student of the East Ocean Academy? Who Is He to you?”

The old man in green armor asked Jin Liuyan with a sullen face.

Jin Liuyan looked at the woman and then at Wang Xian. She said bitterly, “Captain Wang, Bai Wen is a teacher of the Demon Hunters Academy!”

“Huh?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows. A teacher of the Demon Hunters Academy?

This was a little troublesome. He had not even enrolled in the academy yet and had already offended a teacher. It was not a good thing.

“Young Lady, what are you trying to say?”

Bai Wen looked at Jin Liuyan and asked with a frown.

“This... teacher Bai Wen, Commander Wang is a new student of the Demon Hunters Academy. You are a teacher of the demon Hunters Academy. We are all on the same side. Don’t make such a fuss...”

Jin Liuyan said bitterly.

However, when Bai Wen heard Jin Liuyan’s words, he widened his eyes and looked at Wang Xian in disbelief.

Even the rest of them had a slight change in expression as they stared at Wang Xian in unison.

“It is even more unforgivable for a subordinate to offend his superior. What right does such a person have to enter the Demon Hunters Academy!”

However, elder Xiao’s anxious voice was heard from behind.

He had created such a situation with great difficulty. Now that both parties were involved, how could he let them be so kind!

“Shut up. HMPH, all of you are not good people!”

Jin Liuyan heard elder Xiao’s shout and shouted at him angrily.

“Cough Cough, I’m also a teacher of the Demon Hunters Academy!”

The middle-aged man who was caught by Wang Xian coughed with a flushed face and said in a low voice.

Jin Liuyan was stunned. She turned her head around in astonishment.

The corner of Wang Xian’s mouth twitched. He looked at the instructor of the Demon Hunters Academy who was caught by him.

“I am the vice-principal of the Demon Hunters Academy!”

At this moment, the voice of the green-armored old man was heard. He kept the long saber in his hand back into his interspatial ring. He sized up Wang Xian with a surprised and weird expression.

“I am the Dean of the Order Department of the Demon Hunters Academy!”

The white-haired old man said in a deep voice with a twinkle in his eyes.

Jin Liuyan, Zhou Hanhan, Father Zhou, and even Wang Xian and the rest were dumbfounded!

They had already started a fight with the higher-ups of the academy before the start of the semester?
