Chapter 432: Gathering Of The Outstanding Heroes (1)

The bi-annual Outstanding Young Heroes competition was about to start. For all young disciples, this was a grand event.

They could compete for supremacy among the youths of the Underworld, challenge the strongest experts in their generation and aim to reach the top of the Outstanding Young Heroes Chart.

They could become the strongest champion among the youths!

For every young disciple, this was a dream and a form of motivation.

The thought of standing above the entire generation of youths made everyone excited for the competition. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The Outstanding Young Heroes Competition was not just a stage for the young disciples. At the same time, it was a stage for Sacred Sects and powerful forces to display their strength.

The strength of the young generation also represented the future of a force.

As compared to before, the current Outstanding Young Heroes Competition was attracting way more attention.

There were too many geniuses and demon-like talents that had mushroomed out.

In the past, one could be ranked in the top-five when one reached the Inborn Realm. However, the news over the past year had been more and more explosive and impressive.

Even those experienced Inborn experts were at a loss for words over why the current young generation had become so terrifying.

Just a while ago, the twenty-year-old Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown emerged from nowhere. He killed four to five Inborn experts and was widely regarded as the strongest on the Outstanding Young Heroes Chart.

The entire Underworld was shaken and countless people were dumbfounded.

However, an even more demon-like existence emerged from the Xiao Clan four days ago. He was an unparalleled demon-like talent which many regarded as having started his cultivation when he was still in his mother’s womb.

A fifteen-year-old Inborn expert and the current clan leader of the Sacred Clan, Xiao Clan. He was the youngest clan leader of a Sacred Clan and the very first in history.

When the news came from the Xiao Clan, everyone in the Underworld was shocked.

This had completely refreshed the norms many people had taken for granted. A fifteen-year-old Inborn expert! What a terrifying existence he was.

When they were fifteen years old, how strong were they? Level 3 or Level 4 Martial Artists?

The appearance of one after another demon-like existence made countless people speechless.

When more and more young Inborn experts emerged in the Underworld, people were going crazy about it.

With over ten Inborn experts around the age of thirty participating in the Outstanding Young Heroes Competition, the competition would be exceptionally explosive and competitive.

Those who hadn’t reached Half-step to Inborn wouldn’t even make it to the chart.

“Brother, are you going for the Outstanding Young Heroes Competition? I’ll be going with my master and the sect tomorrow!”

At night, Xiao Yu called and asked excitedly when Wang Xian was having dinner with Guan Shuqing, Lan Qingyue and Sun Lingxiu.

“Yeah, we are joining in for the show tomorrow,” Wang Xian replied with a smile. The entire Underworld had been about the youth competition over the past few years and he had prepared to go and take a look.

To witness the strength of the current generation of experts in the Underworld.

In addition, Wang Xian had another task. That was none other than announcing to all that he would be establishing a Sacred Sect.

The truth was, Wang Xian had some of the matters arranged and settled. For example, the dragonians...

He wanted to shock the entire Underworld with the establishment of the Sacred Sect, Dragon Sect. The current Outstanding Young Heroes competition happened to be a great opportunity.

At that time, the Dragon Sect would be established and he would invite all sects to pay pilgrimage to him.

Wang Xian’s lips curved into a smile. “Let’s meet at Huashan then!”

“Alright, brother. Haha, at that time, I’ll be announcing the advancement of the Thistles and Thorns Sect to a first-class force. Hehe! With my master and I around, our Thistles and Thorns Sect will be known throughout the entire Underworld!” Xiao Yu said contentedly.

“Alright. All hail the great Sect Leader Xiao Yu. Sect Leader Xiao Yu shall be recorded in history forever and will rule the world!” Wang Xian teased.

“Hehe! I’ll protect you in the future!” Xiao Yu laughed proudly. After a brief casual chat, they hung up the phone.

“With Xiao Yu and Elder Fang’s current strength, no one will likely be a match for them unless you participate too!” Guan Shuqing said to Wang Xian with a smile.

“Yeah, no one will be a match for them!”

Wang Xian nodded his head. Considering the strength of Xiao Yu and Elder Fang, no one in the younger generation could possibly defeat them.

Even Mo Qinglong was a far cry from them now. After turning into the Skeletal Dragons, they could even fight on par with Dan Realm experts.

With their strength, no one would have differing views if they announced their ascension to a Sacred Sect.

“I used to be the strongest and now I’m the weakest!” Guan Shuqing grumbled unhappily.

“You are considering yourself weak? You could release such tremendous flames the moment you reached the Inborn Realm. Even a Pinnacle Inborn expert would be exhausted to death against you!” Wang Xian joked.

A few days ago, Guan Shuqing had finally reached the Inborn Realm.

After reaching the Inborn Realm, the flame within her body underwent huge changes. The flames she could release were even more terrifying than the Tranquil Blue Heavenly Flame.

What was most horrifying about her was that the flames within her seemed to be limitless.

When Sui Huang asked her to launch long-range attacks, Guan Shuqing released a full hour of flames without feeling the least bit of fatigue or exhaustion.

With limitless flames, huge long-ranged attacks would be just tricks to her.

Sui Huang was stunned for a long time. The next day, he informed her that he would be heading overseas to get her a fire attribute long-ranged attack skill.

In other words, he was looking for attacking techniques of magicians in Euramerica.

At this juncture, Guan Shuqing could simply act as a flamethrower tower.

“I’m still really weak in close combat!” chuckled Guan Shuqing.

“Alright, let’s finish our dinner quickly and go to bed. We still have a long journey tomorrow!” Wang Xian said sheepishly.

Lan Qingyue and Guan Shuqing rolled their eyes at him while Sun Lingxiu was flushed with embarrassment.

With her current cultivation attainment, she could hear clearly any movements within the villa. Recently, she had heard all kinds of sounds.

On the next morning, Wang Xian headed towards Huashan with the three girls.

Huashan was a mystical place in Chinese novels.

It was most famous for the discussion of swords.

The Outstanding Young Heroes competition would be held in Huashan.

The competition wasn’t held in the scenic region of Huashan. Instead, it was an isolated region.

However, the region wasn’t open yet.

As the winter holidays had just passed and it was the winter season, there weren’t many tourists around.

Nonetheless, there were still lots of people around. Most of them were martial artists who used longswords or short daggers.

They wore neat uniforms from various sects and families and looked exceptionally imposing.

The scholars of Jiangnan couldn’t possibly be a match. [1]

Wang Xian was in exceptionally elaborate attire. He had Zhan Lu sword beside his waist and a golden fan in his hand. Three beautiful ladies stood beside him with Mo Qinglong and Mo Yuan following closely behind them.

He resembled a rich and young man.

Flap.

The fan was extended. Wang Xian chuckled. “Dears, let’s find accommodation first!”

“Can you act more decently? There’s a hotel ahead. Let’s head there before we climb the Huashan in a while!”

Lan Qingyue rolled her eyes at him. Soon after, the group of six headed towards the hotel ahead of them.

When they entered the hotel, Mo Qinglong and Mo Yuan stepped ahead immediately to reserve rooms.

Wang Xian stood behind with his fan and beautiful ladies as companions. He was just like a wasted rich young man illustrated in novels.
