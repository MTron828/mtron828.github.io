Chapter 1081: Before the 1082 storm

Translator: 5496903

“Don’t apologize to me. Think about how to explain to the academy about the students who were killed by you!”

In the sky above the ocean, Wang Xian looked at director Qian and Qian Hu who were standing in front of him and said expressionlessly.

The death of the students of the Demon Hunter College had nothing to do with him. Just like the East Ocean College and the Ocean College, he wouldn’t delve into it. Everything was a matter of the Academy itself.

To them, Wang Xian was just a passerby. It would not be long before he left the Demon Hunter College.

Director Qian and Qian Hu’s expressions were a little ugly.

He did not expect that Wang Xian would ignore them even if he came to apologize to them personally.

However, when they recalled how Wang Xian dared to attack the son of an insightful void martial artist, they fell silent.

“Leave the command of the Demon Hunter College to student Wang Xian. We will definitely cooperate!”

Even in the face of Wang Xian’s cold face, director Qian still lowered his attitude and said respectfully.

“Okay!”

Wang Xian nodded his head lightly.

The few instructors from the East Ocean Academy beside him had some understanding.

“So the reason why the demon Hunters Academy suffered losses when they rushed here was because they didn’t listen to Commander Wang’s orders. No wonder!”

“Commander Wang’s insight is simply heaven-defying. His commanding ability is also very strong. I feel like he can see every angle!”

Some of the people following behind heard the conversation in front of them, and a look of realization appeared on their faces.

Soon, this matter spread to the people behind them.

...

“He crippled all of my cultivation, crippled all of my cultivation. I want to kill him, kill him!”

However, at this moment in holy sea town, when Hai Wen woke up from his coma and felt the energy in his body, a ferocious expression appeared on his face as he roared indignantly.

“Young master hai, please calm down first. When you return, the general will be able to completely heal your injuries!”

The old man by the side said with an ugly expression.

“Calm down? Others have already crippled me, how can I calm down?”

Hai Wen stared at the old man with a ferocious expression. “I want to kill him, kill him!”

The old man saw his condition and didn’t dare to say anything.

The young masters who were high and mighty were suddenly crippled. He, who hadn’t experienced any hardships, couldn’t accept it at all.

“Where’s Vice Regiment Commander Meng? Where’s Vice Regiment Commander Meng?”

Hai Wen suddenly stood up and stared at the old man with a ghastly pale face.

“Young master hai, I don’t know whether Vice Regiment Commander Meng has returned or Not!”

The old man shook his head and said with a bitter face.

“Let’s Go!”

Hai Wen directly walked out. His body became anxious and he almost fell to the ground. The old man beside him hurriedly helped him up.

This made his face even paler. He directly walked towards the mayor’s mansion.

When he had just arrived at the mayor’s mansion, the members of the wind riding squad happened to be walking towards him.

However, at this moment, there were only about 3,000 people in the 5,000 man squad. Many of them were walking on the ground. It was obvious that the wind wildebeest had already been sacrificed.

Walking at the front, there was a long wound on vice regiment commander Meng’s chest. The wound had already stopped bleeding, but it looked extremely serious.

“Oh?”

The old man from Ocean Academy was shocked when he saw the heavily injured wind riding squadron. He hurriedly went forward to welcome them.

“Vice Regiment Commander Meng, you guys?”

“We’ve encountered an ambush. Although we managed to kill the Scarlet Fish Craftsman Beast, the wind riding squadron has suffered heavy losses!”

Deputy Captain Meng’s expression was extremely grave. When he looked at Hai Wen, he was slightly stunned. “Xiao Wen, your body?”

“Uncle Meng!”

Hai Wen’s face revealed an aggrieved expression. He walked over with a pale face and said, “Uncle Meng, you have to stand up for me. That Wang Xian actually ordered his men to cripple my cultivation. You have to avenge me!”

“Wang Xian?”

Deputy Captain Meng extended his hand to check Hai Wen’s body. His expression was extremely unsightly. “Xiao Wen, didn’t you tell him your identity?”

“I did!”

Hai Wen nodded. His expression was a little distorted. “I told him my father’s identity, but he...”

“Alright, Alright. Even though he knows that he’s the son of the captain, he still dares to make a move!”

Deputy Captain Meng’s face revealed a ferocious aura. Coupled with the wounds on his body, he looked like a god of death. His eyes flashed with a cold murderous intent. “Xiao Wen, I’ll settle this matter for you!”

“Thank you, Uncle Meng!” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

A pale smile appeared on Hai Wen’s face. His eyes were filled with excitement.

..

“I wonder how deputy captain Meng is doing!”

Wang Xian and the rest returned to Shenghai town. The President of the hiring association looked at the dark sky outside and said softly.

“There shouldn’t be a big problem. After all, with the strength of the riding wind battle team, it should be easy for them to destroy a group of ferocious beasts.”

The long-bearded old man from the East Ocean Academy said in a deep voice.

“En!”

The president of the hiring association nodded. After all, the riding wind battle team was one-fourth of the strength of the ocean cultivator corps. If they couldn’t even annihilate a group of fierce beasts, how could they defend East Ocean City.

“I think that with Commander Wang commanding the battle from now on, holy sea town can still be defended!”

Director Qian, who was at the side, smiled and flattered.

As the crowd spoke, a few experts flew directly toward the mayor’s residence.

“Huh?”

When they landed in front of the hall, they saw deputy commander Meng sitting in the center with injuries all over his body.

Beside him sat a young man, Hai Wen.

The mayor was sitting in the lower seat, and his expression was very ugly.

“Deputy leader Meng, Mayor!”

The President of the hiring association walked over, cupped his hands and shouted.

“Take him down!”

However, deputy leader Meng’s voice suddenly rang out.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

In the surroundings, one figure after another attacked Wang Xian’s position.

“Hehe!”

Wang Xian revealed a faint smile.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

Behind him, eleven golden swordfish charged out directly. Their eyes were fixed on the three figures who had charged out.

“Boom!”

Deputy Captain Meng squinted his eyes slightly. He stood up and stared at Wang Xian coldly.

Even though this young man had extraordinary insight, he had helped the riding wind battle team once not long ago.

However, Hai Wen was the son of his general and the only descendant.

He dared to cripple the son of the general. No matter who he was, he would have to pay a terrible price!

The aura of a half-step void interpretation was emitted directly, causing the expressions of everyone in the hall to change slightly.

“Deputy leader Meng, the Great Calamity of Shenghai town is at hand. Aren’t you guys being too cold-hearted by doing this?”

The mayor of Shenghai Town who was sitting at the side sighed and said, “Also, does deputy leader Meng Know What Happened?”

“Deputy leader Meng, Let’s talk things over. Let’s deal with the threat of Shenghai Town First!”

The hiring association’s leader saw Wang Xian’s eleven subordinates standing beside him. His expression changed drastically as he said hurriedly.

“Let’s talk about it after we kill him!”

Hai Wen stood up slowly and stared at Wang Xian with a ferocious expression. His eyes were filled with the excitement and malevolence of revenge!
