Chapter 829: 0830, kill them

Translator: 549690339

Stunned, shocked!

Everyone in the room was shocked when they heard what Wang Xian said.

What the Dragon King said was too overbearing!

The Ancient Greek divine realm has a good relationship with you guys. I am not happy that my friend, the Celestial God of the puppet immortal sect, was killed.

Since our business is not doing well, I will use you guys to make up for the unhappiness in my heart!

Wang Xian’s way of doing things was completely the same as the ancient Greek celestial realm. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Two celestial gods from the puppet immortal sect were killed. The ancient Greek celestial realm directly said that the puppet immortal sect didn’t keep their word and was pushing their luck. Now, I will also kill all the gods in the Garden of Eden Celestial Realm. It can also be said that you guys didn’t keep your word.

This overbearing way of doing things shocked the four great celestial sects. At the same time, they also felt very good.

Damn it, you can kill the people of our Huaxia Immortal sect, but why can’t we kill you.

Anyway, it was a kind of nihility.

Although this method was very comfortable, among all the immortal sects in Huaxia, none of them dared to do this because every divine realm was stronger than the immortal sects. If the immortal sects didn’t join forces, they wouldn’t be able to contend with the divine realm.

But now, the Dragon King dared to do it.

This made them feel a sense of relief.

The disciples of the four immortal sects stared at Wang Xian with admiration. Some of the female disciples wanted to marry him.

When the eight gods of the Garden of Eden heard Wang Xian’s words, their faces instantly turned cold. When they saw Ao Jian and Ao Jian, who were full of killing intent, behind Wang Xian, they looked embarrassed.

“Dragon King, do you mean to kill us?”

The eyes of the angel of okra sparkled as she said coldly, “Do you really think you can kill us with just the two of you?”

“That’s more than enough!”

Wang Xian turned his body to the side and released a terrifying pressure instantly. The power of a superior immortal instantly filled the entire room as traces of killing intent brewed in the air.

The faces of the gods in the Garden of Eden changed slightly. Each of them held the divine staffs in their hands tightly and pointed them at Wang Xian. “Dragon King, do you want to be enemies with the Garden of Eden?”

“So what if we are enemies? You guys are too annoying!”

Wang Xian said coldly.

“Stop it, Dragon King. This is the territory of the Nine Snakes Association. Don’t be impudent in our territory!”

The expressions of the five elders changed instantly. They stood up immediately and stood beside the gods in the Garden of Eden. They stared at Wang Xian with an embarrassed expression.

“This is my territory!”

Wang Xian said to the elder indifferently.

“Your territory? Hehe, our Lord Ba Qi is not afraid of you, Dragon King!”

The elder said with a sinister look in his eyes.

“Then call Ba Qi over. Otherwise, I will make my move!”

Wang Xian smirked at the five elders of the nine snakes association and said with a mocking look in his eyes.

He spat out three Dragon Balls which contained a terrifying power.

The three Dragon Balls were suspended in the air and could launch a terrifying attack at any time.

“Dragon King, if you dare to make your move, the Garden of Eden will not let you off.”

Sensing the power of the three Dragon Balls, the faces of the gods in the Garden of Eden changed slightly as they spoke with a solemn expression.

Crack! Crack

At this moment, a cracking sound was heard. The thin elder of the nine snakes association was holding a cracked snake head in his hand.

“Dragon King, you forced me to do this. Our great god of eight orbs doesn’t have a good temper. If you anger him, even if you are the Dragon King, you will have to pay a heavy price!”

The thin elder said coldly.

“Why did you call me?”

At this moment, a slightly impatient voice came from underground.

Okra’s Angel was slightly delighted, and a light flashed in his eyes. He immediately shouted, “Lord Ba Qi, we are the gods of the Garden of Eden. We hope to cooperate with the Nine Snakes Association to deal with some fellows who are courting death!”

“Lord Ba Qi, someone is disrespecting the nine snakes association and wants to kill us and all the guests of the Garden of Eden!”

The thin and weak elder hurriedly shouted.

“Superior Immortal, there really is a superior immortal in the Nine Snakes Association!”

“Hiss, it can’t be. A small force actually has a superior immortal!”

The sudden appearance of the voice startled everyone from the four great immortal sects. Even the ten immortal gods frowned.

They had heard of Ba Qi from the Nine Snakes Association, but they had always treated him as a mythical creature.

If these mythical creatures really existed, then to the four great immortal sects, they were also a very powerful existence.

After all, they were powerful upper level immortals.

“Crack Crack Crack!”

A crack appeared on the ground, and a long hand stretched out from the ground. With a gentle wave of its white and slender arm, a hole appeared.

A head appeared. The head was somewhat slender, and its face was extremely pale. It had a pair of extremely cold eyes.

However, what was even more shocking was that after the head appeared, a second, third, and fourth head appeared.

Everyone around had shocked expressions on their faces. They stared at the nine heads with solemn expressions. The monster gave off a cold and gloomy expression.

Nine heads and nine arms. It gave off an extremely sinister feeling.

“Great god Ba Qi, it’s him. He wants to kill us, and he also wants to kill our distinguished guests in the Garden of Eden!”

The skinny elder quickly laid his body on the ground and spoke to Ba Qi as though he was in awe of God.

The other four elders were also lying on the ground. Their respect was as though they were slaves.

“He wants to kill all of you and him!”

When the Ba Qi Serpent came out, a few of the nine heads had already spotted Wang Xian.

However, he did not greet him immediately.

As an extremely intelligent eight-headed snake, he knew what was best for him.

“Yes, Lord eight-headed snake. We are currently cooperating with the nine-headed Snake Society. This Dragon King actually wants to destroy us. Please help us, Lord. In the future, the Garden of Eden will definitely reward you handsomely!”

When okra saw the eight-headed snake appear, he glanced at Wang Xian with a smile on his face. Then, he cupped his hands and said.

“Is that so?”

Octavia slowly nodded his head. His nine heads stared at the Octavia Angel.

Suddenly, the nine heads opened their mouths at the same time, and their terrifying tongues swept towards the Octavia Angel.

The Octavia Angel was instantly stunned. His pupils dilated, and a look of terror appeared in his eyes.

However, Octavia was a highgod after all. His strength was definitely not something a god could withstand.

“Lord Ba Qi, are you trying to...”

The nine terrifying tongues became seven or eight meters long, wrapping around Okra’s body. A dense amount of light energy surged from his body as he roared loudly, wanting to break free.

“Lord Ba Qi!”

The faces of the other garden of Eden Gods changed dramatically, and the divine staffs in their hands began to emit terrifying power.

“Keke, a bunch of bastards who want to Die!”

The eight-limbed Serpent’s nine arms were like venomous snakes, directly growing longer. The serpent heads instantly bit onto the bodies of the Garden of Eden Gods.

In less than a second, the bodies of the gods turned pitch-black. The terrifying poison caused the lower gods to instantly lose all their offensive power.

“The Dragon King said that he wants to kill you all, so let’s kill you all!”
