3851 3850 at the edge of the boundless starry sky

“Let’s leave this place. The 24 temples of the belief universe are still too powerful. It’s extremely dangerous for us to stay here alone.”

Wang Xian brought Lan Qingyue and fled rapidly in the starry sky.

The strength of the belief universe was still too powerful.

Just the strength of the 10 temples was enough to make Wang Xian pay such a price to cause them to be severely injured.

If the other party was determined to destroy him, he might send out even more powerful forces next time.

Therefore, he was prepared to leave this place.

He would let an lie bring him out of this place. This way, it would be safer.

With this thought in mind, Wang Xian looked at Lan qingyue and said, “Qingyue, we will leave this place directly later!”

“Alright, Little Xian!”

Lan qingyue nodded her head without any objections.

“Woo Woo!”

However, at this moment, Xiao Lan, Xiao Bai, and the rest suddenly let out a low growl.

When Wang Xian and the rest saw it, they were slightly stunned and looked over.

“What’s wrong, Xiao Lan?”

Lan Qingyue asked Xiao Lan as well.

“Master, we can feel a strong energy in that direction.”

Xiao Lan looked in one direction and spoke.

“A huge amount of energy?”

When Lan Qingyue heard that, she revealed an astonished expression.

“What kind of energy?”

Lan Qingyue asked.

“The huge amount of energy that can be absorbed. We don’t know the exact details.”

Xiao Lan replied.

“Is there any danger? If there’s no danger, let’s go and take a look.”

Wang Xian hesitated for a moment.

They had already escaped for more than ten days.

Wang Xian did not know how long the power of the sacrifice could last. However, he guessed that it would only last for a few months at most.

Perhaps it would be shorter.

The current strength of the experts who believed in the universe, as well as the peak races of the nine-origin universe, had also given birth to the combat strength of a ruler at the ninth level.

Wang Xian and the rest did not have much of an advantage anymore.

Of course, this advantage was probably due to the five or six peak races.

If it was a one-on-one, Wang Xian was still very confident.

In the starry universe, the Dragon Palace was not afraid of any peak races or a palace that believed in the universe.

However, the situation where the Dragon Palace was almost invincible in the past had been broken now!

Now, he couldn’t improve his strength, and it was very difficult for him to improve the tai chi dragon plate and the five elements grinding mill.

The only improvement was Xiao Lan and the others.

Xiao Lan and the others were only at the ruler realm level 6, so it was easier for them to improve.

If they could improve to the ruler realm level 7, Xiao Lan would be able to fight against the peak ruler realm.

This power was extremely terrifying.

Now that they could sense the energy, they could go and take a look.

If Xiao Lan and the rest had all advanced, they would be invincible.

“Woo Woo!”

Xiao Lan and the rest let out a low growl. Their bodies moved and flew in that direction.

After flying in that direction for more than ten days, Wang Xian and the rest saw an incomparably huge ocean.

The water of the entire ocean was azure blue.

There was a special energy contained in the ocean.

“Master, Dragon King, this is the edge of the infinite starry sky.”

At this moment, Xiao Lan’s voice suddenly sounded.

When Wang Xian and the rest heard it, their hearts trembled slightly.

The edge of the Infinite Starry Sky?

The status of the infinite starry sky in the starry universe was more important than the heaven-opening primeval continent in the nine-origin universe.

The space beasts that could live in the infinite starry sky were all abnormally terrifying existences.

Even those at the heaven origin creation level existed.

Other than these terrifying space beasts, they were either the babies of other space beasts.

In the infinite starry sky, it was the paradise of the Space Beasts and the treasure land of the starry universe.

At present, whether it was the belief universe or the nine-origin universe, no powerhouse dared to step into the infinite starry sky.

“Oh right, little blue, the other space beasts that came with you to the starry skies, what’s their current situation?”

Little Blue and the others had been brought to the starry skies.

That was because the exceptionally terrifying space beasts had broken through the universe’s passageway, allowing the powerful disciples of their 9-origin universe to be able to enter here.

“They formed the king race of Space Beasts, wanting to rule over even more space beasts, wanting to educate the space beasts, causing them to give birth to intelligence.”

Xiao Lan replied.

The Space Beasts in the universe didn’t have much intelligence because this universe didn’t give birth to intelligent creatures.

Their inheritance and everything they had had no civilization.

They were all hunting, growing, and evolving! Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

This was their main theme.

This was also the reason why they didn’t give birth to intelligence and civilization.

However, the space beasts in the 9-essences universe gave birth to their intelligence.

“Is it to enlighten the space beasts? To give them intelligence? If the Space Beasts are born with intelligence, the overall strength of the entire universe would probably increase by a lot.”

Wang Xian opened his mouth and said. His eyes were shining.

“Is there any danger in this sea?”

Wang Xian looked at the endless sea water floating in the universe in front of him. He was astonished.

“We don’t know either. With our strength, we didn’t dare to step into the territory of the other space behemoths. Once we discovered that this territory was occupied, we wouldn’t go near it.”

Xiao Lan and the rest replied.

Their strength was still too weak.

Even now, they weren’t very strong in the endless space.

Wang Xian and the rest nodded their heads and looked at the ocean.

“This special ocean contains a powerful energy. This energy is of great benefit to our cultivation.”

Wang Xian sensed it and felt a little tempted.

This place was at the edge of the boundless starry sky. Wang Xian felt that he could take a look inside.

If he could find some treasures, Xiao Lan and the rest’s breakthrough would be shortened for a long time.

“Sure, maybe we can find some treasures. Xiao Lan and I have the pure aura of a space beast. Be careful and we won’t be chased by the Space Beasts.”

Lan qingyue nodded her head.

“Alright, let’s go and take a look!”

Wang Xian nodded his head. He still had a random space scroll in his hand. If they were really in danger, they could escape immediately.

As for Lan Qingyue and the rest, if they were really in danger, Wang Xian could ask an lie to come over.

With this thought in mind, Wang Xian gestured to Xiao Lan and the rest.

Xiao Lan and the rest moved their bodies and entered the ocean directly. They swayed their bodies happily.

Kun was biased towards the ocean.

The Divine Dragons naturally lived in the ocean.

Wang Xian entered the ocean and felt comfortable all over. He swam towards the ocean.

Their speed was not fast. They were alert as they sensed their surroundings.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

When Wang Xian and the rest entered the ocean, they were at the army of the ten palaces.

Eight figures flew over from afar.

“Eight messengers, you are here!”

The gods of the ten palaces were delighted when they saw the eight level seven gods flying over.

“HMM, where is the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace Now? Let’s destroy him.”

The eight rank seven gods asked calmly.
