Chapter 1591: 1591 dyed the world red

The three ancestors of the Bingxin dynasty revealed furious expressions.

This arrogant skyfiend actually dared to pin down the three of them in a one-on-three fight.

This caused the killing intent in their hearts to soar to the clouds.

They looked at each other, their eyes filled with viciousness.

Kill, they had to kill him as soon as possible, and then kill the other one.

“Aspect: Wrath of the Sea God!”

“Aspect: Wrath of the Sea God!”

“Aspect: Wrath of the Sea God!” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Without any hesitation, the three of them unleashed their powerful aspect attacks. Three identical aspect attacks charged towards Wang Xian.

“Boss Devil, if you can’t Hold On, give me a shout. Outside, I’ll help you kill. hehehe!”

The hunchbacked old man swept his gaze in the direction of Wang Xian. His slightly reddened eyes were staring at the majestic and magnificent city ahead.

“I will dye the blood of this lake red!”

“Ten thousand shades of annihilation!”

The hunchbacked old man roared. One by one, the demon shadows pounced towards the city wall.

“Stop him!”

The king of Bingxin shouted in fear when he saw an expert at level eight of the Seethrough realm charging over.

“Kill!”

The group of Profound Void Tier 7,6, and 5 experts looked at the devils, gritting their teeth as they charged over.

Facing a profound void tier 8 expert, to them, this was simply courting death.

However, at this moment, they had no other choice.

“I hope the forefather and the rest kill that Sky Devil as soon as possible, otherwise...”

Everyone stared at the demon shadow, their faces filled with determination.

“With just a bunch of ants like you?”

The tens of thousands of demon shadows glanced at the thousands of insightful emptiness realm experts who were attacking them with disdain in their eyes. Then, they reached out with a ferocious claw.

“Ah Ah Ah Ah!”

In an instant, a miserable cry sounded.

“Jie Jie Jie!”

A sinister and terrifying voice came from the hunchbacked old man’s mouth. Only five thousand of the demon shadows were completely blocked.

The other half of the demonic shadows charged straight into the city wall.

The Bloody Demonic Shadows waved their demonic claws, attacking indiscriminately.

If they met someone, they would directly charge over.

A blood-curdling scream instantly resounded throughout the entire ice heart imperial city’s city wall.

“Demonic Shadow Explosion!”

Right at this moment, a voice suddenly came from behind.

“Boom Boom Boom!”

To everyone’s horror, the tens of thousands of devils suddenly exploded.

A terrifying corrosive power of darkness spread out in all directions!

“Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!”

Yet another miserable cry sounded out.

“Awesome! Come, take another move from me, Great Sun of Darkness!”

All the Devils disappeared. In front of the city wall, the hunchbacked old man raised both his hands, and a great sun of darkness slowly appeared above his head.

It was a sun that was like the Sun.

Unlike the Sun, the entire sun was filled with violent dark energy.

The entire dark sun floated 10,000 meters high in the sky, with a diameter of five to six kilometers!

“Enjoy the darkness!”

The hunchbacked old man excitedly ran directly into the ice heart imperial city.

“Oh my God!”

“They... they are too terrifying. What can we use to defend against them!”

At this moment, on the city walls and within the city walls, everyone’s faces were filled with terror as they stared at the terrifying great sun.

The Great Dark Sun was like a meteorite as it descended towards the inner regions of the Bingxin Imperial City.

“Jing Huan, hurry up and escape to the lone sect!”

The bingxin king stared at Bing Jing Huan by the side as he shouted anxiously.

“Father, let’s... Let’s leave together!”

Bing Jing Huan’s face was filled with fear as he exclaimed.

“How can I leave? This is the root of our ice heart empire. I’m the king here, I can’t Leave!”

The Ice Heart King gritted his teeth as he stared at the Great Dark Sun that was charging over.

A few seventh level profound void martial experts tried to resist, but they were directly melted by the Great Dark Sun.

Hitting a rock with an egg.

With their strength, they were simply hitting a rock with an egg.

“Boom!”

The Great Dark Sun descended, and the city walls were like paper, directly shattering.

“Weng!”

The moment it descended, the great dark sun directly exploded.

The area of the Great Dark Sun’s radiation had reached a radius of dozens of kilometers.

At this moment, a radius of dozens of kilometers fell into darkness.

“Ah!”

The terrifying dark energy made millions of people scream in pain.

One move had caused rivers of blood to flow, and one move had destroyed one-fifth of the entire ice heart imperial city.

One move had only allowed a few rank 7 and rank 6 profound void martial artists to escape the range of the Great Dark Sun’s attack.

Panic and death instantly covered the entire ice heart imperial city.

“Just what kind of existence has our icy heart empire provoked? !”

“The sky demon once destroyed millions of lives in the ancient demon city. Today, is he going to destroy tens of millions of lives in our icy heart imperial city?”

Behind the main cities, tens of millions of people watched this world-destroying attack as their bodies trembled.

Only at this moment did they realize that they were no different from ants.

“Keke, this move feels so good!”

“Everyone in the iceheart imperial city, kneel down. Otherwise, we don’t mind destroying the city!”

The evil aura of the hunchbacked old man spread out in all directions. The surrounding demon snakes were useless.

A ten-meter-wide dark sun stood behind them. He ordered the tens of millions of people in the Iceheart Imperial City.

“This...”

Hearing the stooped old man’s words, everyone looked extremely embarrassed. They looked at the place in the sky that was covered in darkness.

There, the horrifying battle and the impact formed a huge mushroom cloud in the sky.

The three ancestors of the Bingxin dynasty were still inside, but they hadn’t come out yet.

The dozens of experts of the Bingxin dynasty who were hiding from the Great Dark Sun near the city wall looked at the stooped old man in fear.

“Keke, I like your hesitation!”

The hunchbacked old man saw everyone standing there in a daze. He didn’t hesitate at all.

He waved his arm and unleashed terrifying attacks towards the imperial city.

He didn’t show any mercy at all!

In terms of means, even Wang Xian couldn’t compare to the hunchbacked old man.

“Ahhh!”

“Let’s kneel, let’s kneel!”

“Don’t Kill Us. It has nothing to do with us. It has nothing to do with us!”

“No!”

One attack after another, at least hundreds of thousands of people died at the hands of the hunchbacked old man. His cruel means terrified everyone.

In the entire imperial city, tens of millions of people were kneeling on the ground.

Some were praying loudly while others were crying.

At the side, the three insightful void martial artists and the group of level six insightful void martial artists standing beside the king of Bingxin were trembling.

“King, should we also kneel...”

A Level 6 insightful void martial artist asked in fear.

“Do you think that the sky demon will let us go if we kneel?”

The bingxin King said with a slight tremble. His face was full of regret.

How could he have thought that the Saint Prince of Light, who looked kind, would be the extremely cruel Sky Demon.

He swept his gaze across his surroundings. Fresh blood gathered and flowed into the ice heart lake in front of him.

Especially in front of him, the river water had already been dyed red by millions of fresh blood.

The river water reflected into the sky and dyed the entire sky red.

It was like the end of the world!
