Chapter 2926: conquering the machine imperial region 1

“Retreat? What’s going on? The governor actually ordered all the soldiers on our side to prepare to retreat?”

“What’s going on? The machine imperial region hasn’t retreated yet. Should we retreat now?”

“I heard from the divine emperor that we’ll leave this side to the Dragon Palace to guard. We’ll go deal with the situation over at the Chimei region!”

“We have asked the Dragon Palace for help. The Dragon King has already sent people over to help us guard this place.”

“So we have really asked the Dragon Palace for help. However, with their strength, don’t they need some of our legions to help them?”

“The kid with invincible battle techniques in the AI said that the Dragon Palace’s strength is even stronger than ours. I don’t know if it’s true, but with the Dragon Palace’s help, we will have less pressure.”

At the border of the machine royal territory, two-thirds of the Corps and forces of the glazed area were guarding there.

Many soldiers were surprised when they heard the order to retreat.

They were slightly relieved when they heard that the Dragon Palace had come to support them.

They knew the situation of the glazed area now. With the support of the Dragon Palace, they would have less pressure.

They were also very curious about the strength of the Dragon Palace because of the two pieces of information released by the Intelligence System.

All the soldiers also wanted to know how strong the Dragon Palace was and whether it was as strong as them.

All the soldiers retreated in an organized manner.

…

“The Dragon Palace, are they going to guard this place for the glazed area? Humph!”

At this moment, in the front, there was an endless fleet of starships.

On the battleships that were emitting a cold aura, the dark and deep cannons were filled with a terrifying power.

On the battleships, rows of fighter jets were about to spread their wings and soar.

Other than that, on an incomparably huge space battleship, there were densely packed bio-humans.

Every single bio-human was wearing heavy armor. Their terrifying and ferocious faces were like powerful zombies.

Other than the battleships, battle mechas, and bio-humans, there were also gigantic battle mechas.

Some of the battle mechas were tens of thousands of meters in size. Some were in the form of humans, and some were in the form of spiders. There were all sorts of battle mechas. These were terrifying battle mechas.

On a high platform in the middle of a battleship that was tens of millions of kilometers long, a burly mech that was shining with golden light was sitting inside.

He was the creator, the ruler of the Machine Imperial region.

A supreme existence.

In the Machine Imperial region, no robot dared to disobey him.

The creator sat there and looked at the other side quietly, his eyes shining.

He had already received the news of the arrival of the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace.

He was very angry that the Dragon Palace had interfered in their affairs with the glazed area.

“How dare you interfere in our war? One day, I will make the robotic battleship whistle over the sky of the Dragon Palace and capture the legendary Divine Dragon for Research!”

The creator’s huge, cold eyes were flashing with information and were filled with coldness.

Buzz

At this moment, he shifted his gaze and stood up slowly. All sorts of data appeared in his eyes.

The direction of his gaze was the planet where the Dragon Palace was located.

Roar! Roar! Roar

Roar! Roar! Roar

The roars of the dragons reverberated throughout the glazed domain and the machine emperor domain. In the middle of the confrontation between the armies of the two domains, they were filled with unbridled fear.

Nine Wind Divine Dragons were pulling a dragon chair in the middle.

Wang Xian sat on the Dragon Chair. Around him were more than a dozen divine emperors of the Dragon Palace.

As for the other divine emperors of the Dragon Palace, they were hiding among the members of the Dragon Palace.

At the back, 1.5 million experts of the Dragon Palace were emitting a terrifying aura. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

They were mainly devouring dragons.

They had eighteen extremely sharp claws. Their bodies ranged from 2,000 to 10,000 meters in size. They were filled with the smell of desolation and blood.

The experts of the Dragon Palace quickly flew toward the battlefield.

“That’s the army of the Dragon Palace. They’re here!”

“Hiss, what a terrifying aura. Most of the experts of the Dragon Palace aren’t human, but that aura is so terrifying!”

“So powerful. Just this aura is enough to make people tremble. How many experts did the Dragon Palace send this time?”

“Is that the Divine Dragon in the middle? The Legendary Divine Dragon?”

All the soldiers of the glazed domain revealed shocked expressions when they heard the roar of the Wind Divine Dragon.

Around them, billions of gazes were simultaneously looking in the direction of the Dragon Palace’s army.

In the void in the middle, the domain Lord and the other god Emperors were also looking in this direction, their eyes flashing with a luster.

“Howl Howl!”

The dragon roared, swaying its body as it swiftly rushed over.

“25 emperor level warriors, that doesn’t seem like a lot, however the disciples of the Dragon Palace are all so terrifying, not one of them is weaker than an undying level 4!”

“The number of emperor level warriors is lower than we expected, are they trying to hide it? However their disciples are really terrifying, about 1.5 million!”

“The lowest undying Emperor Level 4 aura, over a million, this… in terms of strength, our glass region can not compare to them!”

The emperors looked at the terrifying army, their eyes filled with shock.

Even the domain Lord’s eyes gleamed.

“The Dragon Palace is still hiding their strength, however I can’t sense exactly how much.”

The governor said in a deep voice.

“They have hidden their strength? Is there a divine emperor hiding in the Army?”

All the divine emperors of the glazed domain were shocked and widened their eyes.

The governor nodded slowly. His realm had reached the third level of the divine emperor realm. He could vaguely sense that there was a divine emperor hiding in the Divine King Army of the Dragon Palace, but he could only sense it clearly by releasing his mind.

Obviously, he couldn’t do such a thing.

“The Dragon Palace’s Emperor God Army is terrifying!”

The Domain Lord was silent for a few seconds, he couldn’t help but speak again.

The Emperor God army had completely exceeded their expectations.

It was terrifying!

“Hiss, look at the warriors behind the Dragon Palace, why do I feel like there’s no one weaker than me?”

An undying Emperor Level 4 soldier from the surrounding glass region couldn’t help but Howl.

His words caused the hearts of the soldiers to tremble.

“Dragon King!”

The domain Lord’s figure moved and he went to welcome Wang Xian and the rest. He shouted from afar and sized up the nine wind god Dragons. His heart trembled.

“Domain lord, leave this to our Dragon Palace!”

Wang Xian said to him.

“Alright!”

The domain lord nodded and his gaze swept across the surroundings.

“All the soldiers and disciples of the glazed domain, retreat 100 million kilometers and prepare to leave!”

He immediately shouted in a deep voice.

“It’s the Governor!”

The voices of the soldiers immediately came from the surroundings.

“Dragon Palace, are you really going to participate in the war between us and the glazed domain?”

Suddenly, in the direction of the machine royal territory, a voice filled with machines pierced through the void and sounded in the surroundings.

“Eh?”

Wang Xian heard this voice and narrowed his eyes slightly. He stood up slowly and looked towards the source of the voice.

The eyes of the yin-yang and five elements dragon flickered as they stared at the figure on the gigantic battleship that was more than a billion kilometers away.

Their gazes met from afar!
