Chapter 111: Known Throughout University of Rivertown (2)

Wang Xian did not sleep a wink last night.

His thoughts kept him awake until 3 am, and he continued with his cultivation until 7 am.

When the four of them, including Wang Xian and Wang Dahai, arrived at the canteen in the morning, Wang Xian could see people pointing fingers at him.

He could even sense the gazes from people who could not wait to kill him off.

We are sworn enemies now that you’ve taken our goddesses away!

The trio distanced him instinctively. In their words, they said,

“Old Wang, you are notorious in the university now. We have to distance ourselves from you. Otherwise, it will be hard for us to find girlfriends.”

Wang Xian was speechless when the four of them came to the canteen to have a high-profile breakfast.

Wang Xian was feeling helpless. He should not have taken lunch and dinner with the girls.

When he was back in class, Wang Xian felt all eyes on him again. The envy, hatred, and jealousy coming from his male classmates annoyed him.

He had two classes today. After his class, he went out of school instead of going to the field with Wang Dahai.

“You are Wang Xian!”

All of a sudden, a few guys were in his way, glaring at him when he had just left the classroom building.

Wang Xian froze for a while. He raised his eyebrows and looked at the people in front of him. Eventually, his eyes fixed on the student who was at the center of the group.

The guy was about 1.85 meters tall, good-looking, and looked charming. Wang Xian knew his name.

Xu Qingcheng, a year-three student. He was the President of Taekwondo Club with a fourth dan black belt. He had also won the championship of the Rivertown Taekwando district competition.

If it were not for age limit, his black belt dan would be higher.

In the University of Rivertown, not only the five goddesses were the famous ones. They had three rather well-known guys that were commonly known as the campus hunks or the prince charmings.

There were several good-looking guys in the school, but only three of them were the official recognized Prince Charmings.

Xu Qingcheng was one of them. Being the President of the Taekwondo Club, he enjoyed high popularity in the school.

The other two were a famous internet celebrity and a mystery student who was known as Mr. Feng among the students.

“Can I help you?” asked Wang Xian as he looked at Xu Qingcheng emotionlessly.

“Nothing. I just want to check out what kind of guy you are, who can date two goddesses in a day!”

As Xu Qingcheng spoke, he circled Wang Xian and observed him from head to toe.

Upon seeing his brazen behavior, Wang Xian raised his eyebrows. “I don’t like guys.”

He continued his way out after he spoke.

Xu Qingcheng hesitated after hearing him. “You’re humourous, pal.”

As he spoke, he stopped in front of Wang Xian and blocked his way.

“Get out of my way!”

Wang Xian was already feeling irritated. When he saw Xu Qingcheng’s provocative behavior, he could not help but bawl at him impatiently.

“Hur?”

When Xu Qingcheng heard that, his face sank as he stared at Wang Xian with cold eyes. “Lad, you’re bold. How dare you speak to me like this!”

“Brother Cheng, he’s so arrogant. Tsk. I wonder how he managed to take the two goddesses out,” a guy walked over and said as he glared at Wang Xian.

“If you have something to say, spit it out. If you don’t, then get out of my way. I don’t have time for you!” Wang Xian said impatiently.

Seeing the four playful and impudent guys around him, he would have given them a slap if they were not in school.

“How arrogant!”

When Xu Qingcheng heard what Wang Xian said, he clenched his fist slightly. “Of course, I have something for you. I just wanted to check out what ability you possess, such that you can date the two goddesses, in particular, Lan Qingyue. I need to see if you’re worthy of them!”

“Show me your capability or your background!”

While Xu Qingcheng was talking, he stretched his body. He looked at him with a cold smirk at his lips.

“Otherwise, I’m going to embarrass you!”

Currently, many people were pissed off with Wang Xian. But the majority of them only expressed it on the forum. Even though some mentioned that they wanted to fight with Wang Xian, none of them really did.

However, others might be afraid of doing so, but not Xu Qingcheng.

He was one of the few guys who had wooed Lan Qingyue before. But he failed in the end which made him a sour grape.

Yesterday, Xu Qingcheng was surprised to hear about Lan Qingyue having dinner with a guy. He wanted to see how the guy looked.

He wanted to see how this guy got into the book of Lan Qingyue.

“What? Are you picking a fight?” Wang Xian stared coldly at them.

“No, as a student, how can we pick a fight? This is called sparring. Come to our Taekwondo Club for sparring.”

A smile surfaced on Xu Qingcheng’s face again as he spoke with a casual expression.

“I have no time!”

Wang Xian had a disdainful look in his eyes. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

You? You want to spar with me with your Taekwondo?

Ha-ha!

Wang Xian ignored him totally and walked forward again.

Xu Qingcheng did not give way to him. Neither did Wang Xian stop. So, he went on to knock into him.

“Hur?”

When Xu Qingcheng saw him coming, his eyes were filled with sarcasm. He moved away and stepped out of Wang Xian’s way, gazing in the direction he left.

“Brother Cheng, this fellow is too cocky. Why don’t we teach him a lesson?”

The three guys next to him pointed at Wang Xian and spoke as he left.

Xu Qingcheng stared at the guy who spoke with an unpleasant look.

“Sorry, Brother Cheng. I forgot about it.”

When that guy saw Xu Qingcheng’s displeased eyes, he quickly apologized.

Xu Qingcheng had been a troublemaker in the school since year one.

In the beginning, the school was lenient to him since he was the champion of the Rivertown’s Taekwondo District Competition.

Subsequently, he made frequent troubles, affecting the school’s reputation. Hence, the school gave him a warning. If he continued to create trouble, he would be expelled from the school. This finally stopped him.

However, it did not mean that he could not spar with others.

“He is arrogant. But he must be capable of being arrogant. If that’s the case, I’ll make sure you lose your face utterly!”

Xu Qingcheng looked at Wang Xian and let out a faint smile. “Go to the school forum and issue a challenge on it. Then...”

Xu Qingcheng smiled. If he could teach Wang Xian a lesson at this time, he would gain higher popularity. At the same time, he could show Lan Qingyue that the guy she favored was totally useless.

He wanted to prove that he was the best!

“Sure, Brother Cheng. Leave this to us. This time, we’ll show him the power of our Taekwondo in the University of Rivertown!”

“Okay!”

Xu Qingcheng nodded with confidence and walked away.

Wang Xian was not even thinking about Xu Qingcheng as he walked to the First-grade Restaurant.

He needed to speed up the preparation of the medical hall and quickly get the business running.

The speed of constructing the Dragon Palace would depend on the business of the medical center.

However, Wang Xian did not know that the school forum was set ablaze again with the topic of him.

This time, it was the challenge from Xu Qingcheng!
