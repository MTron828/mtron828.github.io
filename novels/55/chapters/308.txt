Chapter 309: Succeed

Boom!

“You’re tired of living. How dare you insult Sui Family?”

As soon as Wang Xian finished his sentence, hundreds of disciples of all ages and generations stood up and glowered at Wang Xian.

“Lad, watch how you’re talking. Who are you to speak to us like this? Apologize now or else...!”

An outstanding middle-aged Inborn Expert stared at Wang Xian coldly as he spoke.

Hundreds of Sui Family’s disciples exploded with immense heat as they gathered like a furnace trying to melt Wang Xian away.

“Just two Inborn Experts?”

Wang Xian shook his head slowly and took a sip of tea before he placed it on the table.

Roar!

A soft dragon bellow came from Wang Xian’s mouth. Subsequently, he spat out a Dragon Ball.

Roar!

Once the Dragon Ball came into sight, it turned into Fire Divine Dragon immediately. The seven-meter long Divine Dragon dived towards the fourth and fifth generation of Sui Family’s disciples rapidly.

Imposing demeanor and domineering oppression struck fear into all the people around the area.

“What?”

A second-generation old man from Sui Family was aghast as soon as he saw the domineering oppression exploded from the Fire Divine Dragon. He quickly stood up and faced the Fire Divine Dragon.

“Hur?”

Wang Xian frowned slightly as he looked at the old man.

“Sit down!”

As Wang Xian shouted softly, the old man, who was about to stand up, grimaced. His body was trembling violently.

He turned his head with disbelief as he gazed at Wang Xian with astonishment.

The rest of Sui Huang’s sons who were around were also shocked as they looked at Wang Xian.

A soft bellow and the imposing demeanor that was exuded was able to trap their leader.

They were dumbfounded by the domineering strength. They swallowed saliva in disbelief.

Could it be?

They looked at Wang Xian in horror, and then back at their father again.

At this point, Sui Huang was knitting his eyebrows at Wang Xian. He could not make sense of what Wang Xian was doing.

But Sui Huang did not make any comment as he, too, realized that the Sui Family members had such a good life that they had forgotten to stay vigilant.

Roar!

Just then, the Fire Divine Dragon arrived above the fourth and fifth generations of Sui Family in the field. Daunting Dragon Power encompassed them over their heads, and the blazing flame struck fear on their faces.

“That’s scary...”

A fifth-generation disciple was appalled as he quickly fled to a far distance.

“Divine Dragon, this is the legendary Divine Dragon!”

More disciples collapsed immediately onto the ground, as they were aghast.

Roar!

Another dragon roar was heard. Five to six hundred fourth and fifth-generation disciples let out a sharp and painful shriek as intense flames swept across.

Most of the disciples of different ages were injured as fear crawled all over their faces. They were crying in pain as they rolled on the floor.

Only a handful of people, five or six, stood below with determination as they gazed at the dragon in the sky with pale faces.

“Child, my child!”

“Child, stop it!”

The elders from Sui Family broke out heart-wrenching pleads.

The situation turned chaotic on the Sacred Mountain of Sui Family.

Yet, not only Sui Huang, but the second and third-generation elders also darkened their expressions upon seeing such a situation. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

They were not furious at Wang Xian, who had made a joke out of their descendants. Instead, they were outraged by the performance of their younger generations.

“Coward, coward!”

A second-generation old man of Sui Family gritted his teeth. He lowered his head with shame.

Sui Family’s Clan Leader was so ashamed that he shook his head.

“Sigh!”

Just then, Wang Xian let out a sigh on the stage. He was looking upset as he took out six glowing beads slowly from his arms.

Six of them were giving off a mixture of sapphire and red glow, which made them look creepy.

Sui Huang was astonished as he stared at the six beads in Wang Xian’s hand.

“Old Sui, these are six Meridians Clearing Beads, which I obtained, almost at the expense of my life!”

Wang Xian pretended to be distressed as he spoke. With a swift movement, he appeared in the center of Sacred Mountain.

Only six people were standing in the square at this time, with two middle-aged men, young men, and juveniles each.

Roar!

The Divine Dragon above them let out a roar and enveloped them with six individual flames.

They were the Body Refining Flame from Body Refining Spiritual Flame Balls.

Painful looks were left on the six faces as the flames were injected into their bodies.

The six beads that were glowing in a mixture of sapphire and red colors in Wang Xian’s palm went directly into their mouths.

Bam, Bam, Bam!

Wang Xian walked to a middle-aged man and jerked his arm. He injected a gust of Dragon Energy into the middle-aged man and unblocked his last Conception Vessel and Governing Vessel!

Boom!

An immense Inborn power came from him.

Subsequently, Wang Xian swung his arm and came to another middle-aged man and repeat his actions!

Boom!

Another inborn oppression was felt.

At this time, those Sui Family members who had been screaming in pain on the floor, or had been distressed over the scene, were stupefied. All of them watched in shock at what had just happened.

“This...this... ”

Two middle-aged Half-step to Inborn Experts had stepped up to Inborn Realm.

At this time, Wang Xian did not stop. He came to the remaining young men and juveniles and repeated what he had just did.

“My...My meridians have all been unblocked...”

An excited voice came from a young girl who was the only female standing in the field.

She looked to be at most nineteen. She was trembling with joy as she sensed the changes in her body.

“Mine too. I have made a breakthrough to Half-step to Inborn!”

Another young man was exclaiming excitedly at the top of his lungs too.

“All eight extraordinary meridians have been unblocked? Made it directly to Half-step to Inborn?”

All the people around were stunned by the six persons as they looked shocked on their faces.

Everyone slowly turned their attention to that young man who had a casual smile as if nothing in the world bothered him.

Wang Xian smiled as he swung his arm. A gust of Azure Dragon seeped into the bodies that were lying around on the floor, whose injuries recovered swiftly.

In a move, Wang Xian leaped to his seat, picked up the teacup on the side, and took a sip.

“We...we recovered from our injuries!”

“Yes, that’s true. What amazing medical skills!”

Those people who picked themselves up from the ground were shocked as they observed their bodies.

Suddenly, a young man muttered, “We seem to have missed an opportunity!”

All of them were stunned as they quickly spun around and looked at the six people.

Only they had persisted up to the very end. Now, their eight extraordinary meridians were all unblocked.

This was the opportunity, a big opportunity!

“Thank you, young master, for your kindness!”

“Thank you, young master, for your kindness!”

The second and third generations of Sui Family quickly stood up from their table and greeted respectfully.

They were no longer enraged or infuriated as before, instead showing a high level of respect for this young man since he had done so much for the good of Sui Family!
