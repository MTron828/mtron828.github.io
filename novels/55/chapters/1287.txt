Chapter 1288: 1289 who will be the underling? Get Down

“Little Yuan!”

The two middle-aged men saw Wang Xian standing there with a smile on his face.

Seeing that his heaven’s favorite was still taming the first ferocious beast, one of the middle-aged men couldn’t help but call out.

“Eh? Uncle?”

Young master he was slightly stunned when he heard the middle-aged man’s voice. He opened his eyes.

However, when he opened his eyes and saw Wang Xian standing in front of him and more than ten ferrybirds beside him, he revealed a shocked expression.

Slowly, his expression began to change drastically.

“Young Brother, your beast taming technique should be inherited from Bai Xun, right?”

A middle-aged man looked at Wang Xian and asked in a deep voice.

“That’s right. By chance, I obtained the heritage of the Bai Xun Master!”

Wang Xian nodded and did not hide anything.

His beast taming technique indeed originated from Bai Xun. However, his current beast taming ability was definitely not something that the Bai Xun Master could compare to.

“Bai Xun Elder?”

When young master he heard this name, he was slightly stunned. He thought of some of Bai Xun’s deeds.

“Bai Xun Elder, you actually obtained Bai Xun Elder’s inheritance. The essence of Bai Xun Elder’s beast taming technique is to dominate and become the king of fierce beasts. With the suppression of the bloodline, this method of taming low-level fierce beasts is very fast!”

“However...”

He frowned and didn’t say anything else.

However, according to the records, Old Man Bai Xun’s beast taming technique wasn’t that fast.

However, the records were just records.

“Hmph, although Old Man Bai Xun’s Beast Taming technique is powerful, there is a drawback. Ferocious beasts are easily betrayed!”

When young master he saw the lark behind Wang Xian, he snorted coldly and said unwillingly.

“That’s right. You won against young master he only because your beast taming skills are different. The strength of a beast tamer still depends on one’s own strength!”

“All spells are secondary. The most important thing is still one’s strength. There’s nothing to compare with a beast taming skill!” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

The young men from the Yan clan saw that young master he was in a bad mood and quickly tried to help him out.

“HMPH, that’s right. Strength Comes First!”

Young master he found an excuse for himself and said forcefully.

Wang Xian was a little speechless. He shrugged his shoulders and said, “Whatever you say!”

When young master he saw Wang Xian’s expression, he looked a little embarrassed. This made him feel a little humiliated.

He, who was competitive, clenched his fists tightly.

Wang Xian ignored him and walked to the side with a dozen dodo birds.

“I want to compete with you in terms of strength!”

Suddenly, young master he’s figure appeared in front of him. He stared at him and spoke with full of fighting spirit.

Wang Xian looked at him and frowned slowly. “Compete in strength? You are not my match!”

“Not your match? We have not fought before. How Can We Not Be Your match? Kid, don’t be arrogant!”

He Shao glared at Wang Xian with a gloomy face.

Seeing the competitive look of their own heaven’s favorites, the two middle-aged men shook their heads slowly.

However, they didn’t stop him. This time, they brought him out because the clan leader wanted to bring him to the tomb of the humans and demons for training.

The tomb of the humans and demons was considered a relatively bloody and cruel place. Moreover, the danger level of the tomb of the humans and demons wasn’t very high in the eyes of the He clan.

The clan leader was obviously aware of the deficiency in he Yuan’s state of mind and asked him to come here to gain some experience.

“Pretty Boy, you have provoked me time and time again. Do you want me to accept the challenge in vain? What if you lose?”

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly and said to he yuan.

“I lose. How is this possible? It’s impossible for me to lose!”

When he yuan heard Wang Xian’s words about being a pretty boy, he glared at him angrily and gnashed his teeth.

“You didn’t believe that you would lose just now!”

Wang Xian said plainly.

“Alright, Alright. If I lose, I’ll be at your disposal. But if you lose, give me the beast taming technique of the Bai Xun Master!”

He Yuan stared at Wang Xian coldly.

“Alright, I’m not interested in dealing with you. 100,000 spiritual liquid. The beast taming technique of the Bai Xun Master is worth more than that. Give me 100,000 spiritual liquid. Also, don’t be so narcissistic in front of me in the future. Call Me Big Brother when you see me!”

Wang Xian said with a smile.

“Alright, 100,000 it is. If I lose, so what if I Call You Big Brother? But if you lose, you will follow me in the future and serve my pet!”

He Yuan gritted his teeth and said.

“You are really shameless. However, I agree!”

Wang Xian saw that he yuan had added another condition and said speechlessly.

However, he naturally wouldn’t reject it. He was taking 100,000 spiritual liquid for free.

Looking at this pretty boy, he felt that this guy was a little cute.

At least, he wasn’t like the good-for-nothing disciples from other big forces. He didn’t have too many schemes either.

It was much easier to communicate with such a tsundere person.

“Alright, Alright. I, he yuan, will accept you as my follower!”

He Yuan stared at Wang Xian arrogantly and roared loudly, “Roar Lion, daughter, Ao Yuan!”

“Roar!”

“Roar!”

With He Yuan’s order, three void interpretation level ferocious beasts flew over from behind.

The other twenty or so ferocious beasts followed closely behind him. They stood behind him in an orderly manner and looked menacing!

The group of people around hurriedly retreated.

Long Xiaotian’s expression changed slightly when he saw the three level one void interpretation level ferocious beasts under him and the twenty or so half-step void interpretation level ferocious beasts.

“Brother Wang Xian, be careful!”

Long Xiaotian quickly reminded him.

“Don’t Worry!”

Wang Xian nodded his head and faced he yuan slowly.

Ling Zilin and the blood evil turtle came to his side.

The void interpretation level dodos and more than ten half-step void interpretation level dodos also came to his side.

“Roar! Roar!”

The group of beasts roared.

“HMPH, today, I will defeat you and let you know my strength!”

He Yuan snorted coldly. The strength of a level one void interpretation realm expert was emitted from his body. “Go!”

Go!

With a command, all the ferocious beasts behind him charged toward Wang Xian.

Ling Zilin and the rest of the ferocious beasts didn’t need to give orders. They charged forward directly.

Three level one void interpretation realm ferocious beasts against three level one void interpretation realm ferocious beasts.

It could be said that they were evenly matched.

He Yuan had more than twenty half-step void interpretation realm ferocious beasts against more than ten half-step void interpretation realm ferocious beasts.

He had the upper hand!

Wang Xian didn’t mind. He moved his palm and lightning wood appeared in his hand.

He Yuan also moved his palm slightly and a wood-attributed staff appeared in his hand.

His wood-attributed staff was emitting a bright light. It was at least a level three void interpretation weapon.

Following that, he moved his palm again and two wood-attributed bracelets were attached to his arm.

They were still at least level 3 void interpretation weapons.

If he were to include his armor, shoes, and the like, he would have at least five level 3 void interpretation weapons.

He Yuan was almost armed to the teeth.

Upon seeing the equipment on he yuan, long Xiaotian’s expression changed drastically.

Such luxurious equipment, even if he were to become the crown prince, he would not be able to get it.

“Brother Wang Xian, be careful!”

He quickly reminded loudly with a hint of worry in his eyes.

With such powerful equipment, coupled with his strength of A Level 1 insightful void tier, it would be very difficult for him to fight against a level 1 insightful void tier!
