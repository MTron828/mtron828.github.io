“My pet is very obedient!”

Wang Xian looked at the lady’s cold expression and said faintly.

“HMPH!”

The lady snorted coldly. She took a glance at the Ling Zilin and jumped down from the wall.

Wang Xian shook his head. He didn’t take this arrogant, cold, and unreasonable lady to heart.

“Let’s go to the tomb of the transvestite!”

The Sky had already turned dark. Wang Xian didn’t take it to heart and walked out directly.

In the territory of the cemetery of demi-humans and demons, there was no distinction between day and night.

To the strong ones, the dark night couldn’t obstruct their vision.

Wang Xian let Ling Zilin lie in the courtyard. His body moved and he flew out.

At night, there were at least a hundred thousand people flying in the sky. They were densely packed.

Wang Xian could even see that there were more than 10 people fighting in the sky. Furthermore, they were fighting with their lives on the line.

“As expected of the graveyard of demons and men. There is no order at all. The strong ones can kill whoever they want here.”

Wang Xian thought to himself as he headed straight for the center of the human territory.

There was a huge building there. This building was the largest in this area and was very eye-catching.

That was the Demon Hunter Mercenary Association.

This Demon Hunter mercenary association was definitely the largest mercenary association in the entire Liuhai region. It was jointly established by all the dynasties and mercenary associations in the Liuhai region thousands of years ago.

The entire mercenary association could hold at least a hundred thousand people without appearing crowded.

Wang Xian flew over and looked around.

There were two more eye-catching shops around the mercenary association, the life and Death Pill Workshop and the Holy Item Forging workshop.

These two behemoths occupied a very good position.

Wang Xian entered the demon Hunters Association. There were many people there. There were people who received missions, commissions, and members of the mercenary group.

Wang Xian glanced around and walked to the front of the service counter.

“I accept the mission to hunt Demonic Beasts!”

Currently, the Fairy Phoenix Demon Hunters Association was a two-star gold mercenary group. Every time the mercenary group leveled up, he would receive a reward from the system.

Therefore, Wang Xian was prepared to accept some missions. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The mission of hunting demonic beasts was a mission that all mercenary groups would accept. There was no commission for this mission, but there were a lot of mission points.

“Hello, Young Master. This is the demon spirit token. Every Time You Kill a demonic beast, the demon spirit sect will record it automatically. The more demonic beasts you kill, the more points you will receive!”

“At the same time, there is a ranking list of demon beasts killed in the demon spirit sect to show the strength of Your Demon Hunter team!”

The staff member passed a token to him.

Wang Xian took it and looked at the demon spirit sect.

“The blood flow God sect’s mercenary team killed 3,252 Demon Beasts!”

Wang Xian looked at the number one mercenary team with a hint of surprise on his face.

However, following that, Wang Xian kept it and looked at the mission list.

The top-ranked three-star epic-level mission was to kill the king of the Blood Barbarians, Oakley. The reward was ten cities, an honorary Prince of the blood flow empire, and ten billion upper-grade spirit stones.

The top five missions were all epic-level missions. All of them were to kill the king of the demonic beasts in the human-demon graveyard.

Wang Xian looked down. There were all kinds of missions. He took a look.

“Eh, there are so many missions to collect the pets of demonic beasts and ferocious beasts. The commission is also quite high!”

Wang Xian looked at the dozens of missions in a row and made a mental note in his heart. He did not accept them. After looking at them, he walked out.

“According to the Information Long Xiaotian gave me, the four great trial grounds are one place to obtain the spiritual liquid. In addition, there is also the mansion left behind by the insightful emptiness realm experts!”

Wang Xian flew into the sky and headed south according to the information long Xiaotian gave him.

To the east was the ocean, and to the west was the forest. In front of him was the ruins of the blood stream sect, the real battlefield of the cemetery of human and demon!

Humans occupied the north, demonic beasts occupied the south, and the cemetery of human and Demon was sandwiched in the middle.

Suspended in the sky, under the moonlight, the ocean on the right was slightly red, like a huge blood pool.

The trees on the left were hundreds of meters tall, towering into the sky.

Wang Xian looked ahead and saw dilapidated buildings appearing in his line of sight. After flying for more than ten minutes, mountain peaks appeared in front of him.

The mountain peaks were located in the middle of the forest, and many of the mountain peaks were filled with dilapidated buildings.

“We’re Here!”

Before he could get close to the mountain peaks from afar, Wang Xian could feel a murderous aura. His heart skipped a beat and he immediately landed on the ground.

In the real battlefield of the human-demon graveyard, very few people dared to fly. This was because once one entered this place, one could be ambushed by ferocious beasts or demon beasts at any time.

There were many demon beasts here. Almost 50% of the demon beasts in the flowing sea region were here.

According to human speculation, there were at least hundreds of thousands of demon beasts in the nest of the demon beasts in the south.

Just like humans, they established tribes and races. In order to increase their strength and increase the strength of their races, they entered this place to hunt humans.

Wang Xian landed on the ground. The ground was even redder than where he came from and emitted a strong bloody smell.

The ground was extremely sturdy. It was obvious that it had been struck by a terrifying force.

Wang Xian scanned his surroundings and noticed that there were a few people looking at him from not far away. His eyes were flickering.

“In the tomb of the human-demon race, not only do I have to be careful of demonic beasts, I also have to be careful of my own kind!”

Killing and snatching treasures, killing one’s own kind, these were the bad roots of humans. Wang Xian did not bother about those few people. He took out the map and flew straight ahead.

The entire tomb of the human-demon race occupied the territory of the forest and the ocean. It had an area of about two to three thousand kilometers. It was extremely huge.

In this area, there were over a thousand mansions of void interpretation experts. Most of them had been hollowed out. However, there were still some mansions of void interpretation experts. Due to the chaotic formation, no one was able to enter.

Wang Xian’s first target was those mansions of void interpretation experts.

The chaotic formation was a formation. After a few thousand years, the collapse of the mansions of void interpretation experts caused the formation to intersect. Some of the formations dissipated immediately, but some of the formations intersected by chance, forming a more complicated formation.

It was like clothes that were messed up.

Countless warriors wanted to break the formation and enter the Dongxu mansion that was covered by the chaotic formation.

Wang Xian’s first target was there because of his supernatural ability, no formation.

No Formation, no formation.

Opening his dragon eyes of light and dark fire, Wang Xian scanned his surroundings and dashed forward quickly.

He didn’t fly. Only experts at the fourth or fifth level of the Dongxu were fearless here. Those below the fourth level of the Dongxu were more low-key.

“Up ahead is the mansion of the blood stream sect’s ancient adage. It is now covered by a chaotic formation!”

After dashing for about half an hour, he met dozens of groups of people along the way.

Looking ahead, Wang Xian looked at a mountain peak that was a hundred meters in size.

The mountain peak was not big. It was not even as tall as the surrounding trees. However, there was a mansion of a powerhouse here.
