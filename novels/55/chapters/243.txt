Chapter 244: Pilgrimage Or Tearing Down The Place (3)

“The realm above the Inborn Realm is often regarded as a myth. However, such a realm really exists. I can already feel it. However, it will be a little difficult to achieve the breakthrough,” said Mo Qinglong to Wang Xian.

Wang Xian nodded his head slightly. The realm above Inborn Realm was referred to as Immortals of the Land by the people in the Underworld. However, Inborn Realm experts would refer to it as Dan Realm.

That would involve compressing Internal Energy within the Elixir Field into a Dan so as to achieve an advancement! [1]

However, it’s extremely hard to compress one’s Internal Energy into a Dan. The first issue lies in the Art of Cultivation.

Art of Cultivation has to have an elemental attribute. For example, Dan formed with metal, wood and water Art of Cultivation would give Metal Dan, Wood Dan and Water Dan respectively.

While Wang Xian was chatting with Mo Qinglong, the assessment was going on quickly.

Soon, only twenty-five qualified candidates emerged from an initial number of over a hundred and ten candidates. The twenty-five candidates remaining would gain the qualification to join the Flame Palace.

There were plenty of genius-level talents in First-class Forces that failed to make the cut. From this, one could tell how stringent the Flame Palace’s assessment was.

At the same time, it demonstrated how powerful the Flame Palace was!

For ordinary sects, the Flame Palace was incredible and almighty!

“The selection of disciples below thirty years old had now ended.”

Saintess, Luan Fanghua, looked across the crowd of qualified disciples. Seeing their excited faces, she smiled and looked to the crowd below the stage.

“Before we carry on with the subsequent assessment, I have something personal to settle!”

As she spoke, her gaze looked down and eventually landed at where Thistles and Thorns Sect was.

“My master, Elder Duan, has had a little personal animosity against Sect Leader Tang of the Thistles and Thorns Sect in the past. This has to be settled first!” said the Saintess, Luan Fanghua, as she smirked.

Rumble!

When she finished her sentence, the surrounding families and sects erupted into discussions.

Thousands of people from the entire field looked towards where Thistles and Thorns Sect was. Sympathy, contempt and expressions of pleasure in others’ misery was written across their faces.

“A small Thistles and Thorns Sect has offended an Elder of Flame Palace. It’s over! They are completely finished!”

“Based on the strength that was demonstrated by the Flame Palace, annihilating the Thistles and Thorns Sect will be just like killing an ant!”

“Thistles and Thorns Sect is going to be annihilated!”

“My master is an Elder of a Sacred Sect and will naturally not lower her status by bullying a second-class force!”

Saintess, Luan Fanghua, opened her mouth again and the crowd went silent immediately.

“Our Flame Palace will also not lower our status by targeting you. In that case...!”

Luan Fanghua paused for a moment and looked to where the Thistles and Thorns Sect was. “Send your best disciple forward. Based on my understanding, the Thistles and Thorns Sect seems to have assigned a Saintess. Let our disciples take a look at her. If your Saintess’ cultivation level isn’t bad, we might just spare you. However, if she can’t make it, you guys can start disbanding!”

You guys can start disbanding!

When the last five words of the sentence ended, she emitted a faint aura towards where Thistles and Thorns Sect was.

“Domineering! This is the might of a Sacred Sect. They aren’t killing you because they are afraid of staining their hands. However, they could force you to disband directly!”

“The Flame Palace is indeed deserving of the name of a Sacred Sect. Domineering, with contempt for everything else! Although they aren’t taking actions themselves, they can make you disband directly!”

“Incredible and mighty!”

The surrounding crowd sighed and looked towards Thistles and Thorns Sect.

At this moment, everyone in the Thistles and Thorns Sect was embarrassed. Some of them were even shivering from anger.

The face of Sect Leader Tang, who was standing in front of the group, was as white as a sheet. Asking me to disband the Thistles and Thorns Sect?

That would be the greatest humiliation ever! He would be letting down his ancestors and would bear the insults and shame for life if he had to disband the sect!

Elder Tang looked bitterly at an Elder of Flame Palace.

Elder Duan looked down at Sect Leader Tang with scorn and disdain.

The two of them weren’t on the same level at this moment. A word from him and he could make the Thistles and Thorns Sect disband.

“Sect Leader, didn’t they want me to step forward? Tsk! I’ll show them what I’m capable of!”

Xiao Yu saw the crowd looking at them with scorn and saw how the disciples of the Flame Palace looked down on them. At this moment, she was filled with rage.

“Xiao Yu, Sect Leader has let you down!” Sect Leader Tang looked bitterly at Xiao Yu.

“Rest assured, Sect Leader. Thistles and Thorns Sect won’t disband. Didn’t they want to see my strength? I’ll show them how incredible I am!” Xiao Yu clenched her small fist and answered angrily.

“Yeah!”

With the Flame Palace identifying Xiao Yu specifically, Sect Leader Tang had no ways to go against the Flame Palace. He could only nod his head slowly and turn to glance at Wang Xian.

Wang Xian didn’t say anything.

Letting Xiao Yu fight would be an important trial for her.

If she wanted to become an expert, she had to be able to face some of the issues.

If Wang Xian had kept her protected under his wing, Xiao Yu would never be able to spread her wings and fly in the vast skies.

There are some things that she had to face alone!

“Saintess, Wang Yu, of the Thistles and Thorns Sect seeking guidance from the disciple of the Flame Palace!” [2]

After obtaining the approval of the Sect Leader, Xiao Yu stepped forward and stared coldly at Luan Fanghua.

“Pfft! Just a little brat! The Saintess of Thistles and Thorns Sect is just a little brat!”

“What the... How old is this Saintess? Eighteen or nineteen? My guess is she’s not even twenty and yet she was already made the Saintess of the Thistles and Thorns Sect?” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Could it be that she’s the illegitimate child of Sect Leader Tang? Haha? She’s so young and she’s already the Saintess of the Thistles and Thorns Sect!”

“It seems like Thistles and Thorns Sect is really going to be disbanded. They shouldn’t have offended the Flame Palace! What a group of reckless people!”

When the crowd saw Xiao Yu step forward, almost everyone was waiting to see her get destroyed. A little brat who wasn’t even twenty could become the Saintess?

This was probably a joke!

Tsk!

Xiao Yu could hear the mockeries of the crowd who weren’t even trying to mask it. She clenched her hand tightly over her treasured sword and stared ahead furiously.

“A little brat!”

When Luan Fanghua saw Xiao Yu, she didn’t see her as a threat at all as she commented plainly.

“Who would like to educate the Saintess of the Thistles and Thorns Sect!”

Luan Fanghua looked in the direction of the disciples of Flame Palace and asked loudly. She had also intentionally chosen to use the word “educate.”

Her contempt for Xiao Yu was clearly evident in her choice of words!

“That’s the sister of Miracle Doctor Wang!”

“Who would have expected her to be the Saintess of the Thistles and Thorns Sect!”

At this moment, among the disciples of the Flame Palace, Mu Wanwan and the few other young men around her saw Xiao Yu and were a little surprised.

“Saintess? Let me educate this Saintess from the Thistles and Thorns Sect!”

Mu Wanwan’s lips curved into a smile. Recalling the day when Wang Xian had embarrassed them in the school canteen, her expression turned as cold as ice.

She was fearful of Miracle Doctor. However, that Miracle Doctor Wang had rejected the invitation of Flame Palace consecutively.

Under such circumstances, with Flame Palace as her backing, she wasn’t fearful, even if she was to face Miracle Doctor Wang.

The embarrassment on that day shall be returned to your sister here!

Mu Wanwan walked forward. She held a belt sword in her hand and looked down on Xiao Yu arrogantly.

“I’m Mu Wanwan from Flame Palace. Let me educate you a little, Saintess of the Thistles and Thorns Sect!”

As she spoke, she lifted one of her hands before continuing, “Seeing that you are just a little brat, I shall just use one hand!”

“Tsk! As to who’s going to educate who, this isn’t set in stone yet!”

Xiao Yu gritted her teeth, stared at Mu Wanwan and gradually drew her long sword.

“Give this Saintess from the Thistles and Thorns Sect a lesson she wouldn’t forget!” remarked Saintess, Luan Fanghua, emotionlessly.
