Chapter 1082: 1083 killed and left

Translator: 5496903

In the main hall of the mayor’s residence, the entire atmosphere became solemn.

Hai Wen stared at Wang Xian with a murderous look.

Vice-captain Meng also stared at Wang Xian with a cold expression. The Aura from his body suppressed the entire mayor’s residence.

Beside Wang Xian, the eleven golden swordfish all unleashed their extraordinary level-8 strength as they stared at vice-captain Meng coldly.

When the mayor, Jin Qianyuan, and the President of the hiring association saw this scene, they looked extremely embarrassed.

Now that the holy sea town was facing the greatest crisis in its history, such a situation had occurred internally.

“Deputy commander Meng, the ferocious beasts are about to reach the holy sea town. If the holy sea town is lost, I will definitely report everything to the king truthfully. At that time, even general hai will have to bear the responsibility!”

Jin Qianyuan looked at the soldiers who were gathered around the riding wind battle team. His face was solemn as he stared at Deputy Captain Meng slowly. He stood up and said.

“Shut up! He must die today!” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Hai Wen roared with a ferocious look on his face. His eyes were fixed on Wang Xian.

Deputy Captain Meng’s cold eyes swept across the eleven experts around Wang Xian. He then looked at Jin Qianyuan and said, “Defend the city. There is an army of ocean cultivators here!”

“Haha, a bunch of trash. They want to kill me!”

However, Wang Xian, who was standing in the middle and treated as a lamb waiting to be slaughtered, laughed out loud. He swept his gaze across the surroundings and landed on Hai Wen. His eyes were filled with killing intent.

“Initially, I had already spared your life. However, you didn’t cherish it!”

“You dare to be arrogant in front of me?”

When deputy captain Meng saw how arrogant Wang Xian was, a look of disdain appeared on his face. He extended his arm and a wave of destructive energy shot towards him. “You’re courting death!”

“Since you guys want to avenge him, I’ll kill him first. Haha!”

Wang Xian laughed out loud. In an instant, a wave of darkness burst out from his body. The Darkness instantly enveloped the entire hall and even the outside.

“Bang!”

Wang Xian’s arm shook and transformed into a dragon claw. It went straight for deputy captain Meng’s energy arm.

The powerful collision caused deputy captain Meng’s energy arm to dissipate.

“Oh no, he’s very strong!”

When his strength collided with Wang Xian’s, deputy captain Meng’s expression changed slightly.

He was actually able to block his attack head-on.

Even though the attack was just a casual attack, it was difficult to block it without the strength of a level nine extraordinary.

However, at this moment, he had fallen into the darkness and could not see anything.

Supernatural powers, light and darkness.

Wang Xian had only released darkness. With his current strength of a level seven extraordinary, he could unleash the strength of a peak level nine extraordinary even if he was in his human form. It was a piece of cake for him to block deputy leader Meng’s attack.

He could even tremble for a moment when facing the injured deputy leader Meng.

However, Wang Xian didn’t get entangled with him. With a thought, Hai Wen, who was within the range of the supernatural ability, appeared beside him instantly.

Wang Xian’s palm grabbed Hai Wen’s neck directly.

“Ah, Uncle Meng, save me!”

The battle in an instant left Hai Wen completely dumbfounded. When he was plunged into darkness, he had no ability to resist since his cultivation was crippled.

“B * stard, let him go!”

Deputy leader Meng’s face was filled with shock and anger.

He didn’t expect Wang Xian to hide such terrifying strength. D * mn it, he was just a young man. How could he unleash the strength of a level 9 extraordinaire.

With his current condition, it would take some time to take him down.

Furthermore, there were eleven top-notch level 8 extraordinaire powerhouses beside him.

“Let him go? I have already let him go today. He is seeking his own death. If not for the fact that Shenghai town is in danger now, all of you would have died!”

Wang Xian roared loudly. His voice spread across a radius of a few kilometers.

The students from the three major academies and the people from Shenghai Town who had just returned and were resting were slightly stunned when they heard this voice.

“What’s going on?”

“Holy Sh * t, What’s going on?”

Everyone immediately raised their heads. Some of the students even flew into the sky and looked towards the hall of the mayor’s residence.

“Wang Xian, don’t court death. Let him go quickly. Otherwise, our ocean cultivator army will definitely not let you go!”

Deputy Captain Meng shouted sternly when he saw Wang Xian grabbing Hai Wen.

“Haha, you guys didn’t think of letting me off just now. Do you guys think that I will let him off this time?”

Wang Xian laughed out loud. His eyes were filled with killing intent as he stared at Hai Wen who was in front of him.

This D * mn fellow had messed up his plan.

“No... I won’t kill you. Don’t kill me. No, I promise that I will not take revenge!”

Hai Wen felt the intense killing intent from Wang Xian and revealed a terrified expression. He shouted loudly again.

“Coward, do you think I will let you off twice?”

Wang Xian stared at Hai Wen coldly. With a wave of his hand, he threw it directly at deputy leader Meng.

“Die!”

“Don’t... No, no...”

“Stop!”

“Bang!”

The sound of an explosion was heard and Hai Wen’s body exploded in mid-air.

“You deserve to die! Go To Hell!”

Deputy leader Meng looked at Hai Wen who had turned into a cloud of blood mist. He felt like his eyes were about to split open. His only son of his commanding officer had died in front of him. He could not absolve himself from the responsibility.

“Deputy Captain Meng, don’t think that you can keep me here!”

Wang Xian waved his arm and lightning struck wood appeared in his hand. He waved his arm forward.

“Wood world descent!”

“Fire Dragon’s Flame!”

“Boom!”

Wang Xian did not hesitate to place the two supernatural powers in front of him.

The terrifying wood world descended and covered the entire sky above the mayor’s residence. Following that, flames rose up.

Deputy Captain Meng’s expression changed slightly. With a shake of his arm, the yellow soil that filled the sky appeared out of thin air and headed toward the burning wood world.

“What a terrifying supernatural ability. Is this the true strength of that young man?”

“Dual attributes of wood and fire. The strength of this commander Wang is so terrifying. He is not at the level seven extraordinary like what others have said!”

The mayor, Jin Qianyuan, and the President of the hiring association were shocked as they watched the battle that erupted from Wang Xian. Their faces were filled with shock.

“What the F * ck! Student Wang is so powerful!”

“This... Hai Wen was killed by Wang Xian!”

“D * mn, that Guy was the one who asked the vice-captain of the Ocean Corps to avenge him. Wang Xian killed him. How Shameless!”

“Why do I feel that the people from the ocean corps are such trash? When they were drifting in the holy sea town, they even wanted to have an internal war!”

“D * mn it, they deserved to die. This deputy captain Meng isn’t a good person either. Wang Xian had helped them a lot not long ago!”

Around them, the crowd heard the sounds and attacks coming from the mayor’s mansion. All of them said indignantly.

In their eyes, Wang Xian was undoubtedly a hero. However, a hero had to be attacked by an evil person because this evil person had a deep background.

This made everyone feel like they had a common enemy.
