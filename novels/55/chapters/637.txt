Chapter 638: Plotting (2)

The night at Glacier Coral Island was beautiful.

Wang Xian and the five girls were sitting on the yacht, enjoying the sea breeze, and the delicacy. Life was relaxed for them.

“You girls go ahead. I’ll be right back!”

At this time, Wang Xian stood up.

“Alright, come back soon!”

Given Xiao Yu and Lan Qingyue’s strength, they also sensed that someone who was up to no good was lurking around them.

Wang Xian made a move and appeared on the beach.

“Dragon King, we have caught those people. They are from the Yaofeng Wandering Group, and their holed-up area is here!”

Mo Qinglong came to Wang Xian and reported to him under the dim light.

“Yaofeng Wandering Group? It looks like they must be the active Wandering Group in the disordered region!” Wang Xian revealed a smile. “Let’s go to their base!”

“Yes, Dragon King!”

Mo Qinglong nodded and brought him to the center of the island.

Several Dragonians around him carried three Martial Artists.

Their eyes were wide open, filled with fear as they fixed their eyes on Wang Xian and Mo Qinglong.

“This is the place!”

Those three Martial Artists spoke in horror when they arrived at a luxurious manor on the island.

“Let’s go in!”

Wang Xian did not hide. With a swift movement, they entered the manor directly.

In the manor, there were unknown trees, swimming pools, and lawns. Everything looked delicate and exquisite.

The entire estate was at least a size of hundred acres, which was incredibly huge.

He swept around with his blue and red radiance before he walked to the center.

“Who’s there?”

“Who dares to barge in?”

Some of the Martial Artists cast their cold glances over at Wang Xian as soon as he walked into the manor.

Bam!

Before they could see any images, they were already attacked and collapsed on the ground.

“Too weak. Only those that are at least Half-Step to Dan Realm are useful. They will consume a lot of elixir pills to enhance their strength if they are too weak!”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and walked straight in. The group of people swaggered in boldly.

“Someone broke in!”

When he came to the central building, he heard a cold bellow.

Without Wang Xian making any move, the had dragonians already stunned them on the ground.

“Take control of the place!”

Mo Qinglong ordered the dragonians.

“Who are you guys?”

“Oh no, their strength is overpowering! Run!”

Ah!

When Wang Xian came in, all of the people inside had already fallen to the ground.

Wang Xian took a glance.

The middle-aged man and the burly old man who they’d met at the show that night had already fallen on their knees in fear.

Seeing Wang Xian’s arrival, they were staring blankly at him.

“We met before, didn’t we?”

Wang Xian looked at the two men with a smile on his face.

He sat on the sofa as though some member of the mafia in the movie as he looked at the middle-aged and the old man.

“You...You...”

Both of them recognized Wang Xian and were startled.

This was the young man who had sat beside them today. Never did they expect they’d be easily captured by him.

“Tell me more about the disordered region!” said Wang Xian, looking at the duo with a beaming face.

“Who are you?” the old man growled as he stared at Wang Xian in trepidation.

“Speak up!”

Wang Xian flicked his finger, and a water sword stabbed the arm of that old man!

Ah!

The old man let out a shriek in horror.

It was not only the physical pain that caused him to let out a scream, but it was also the terror that came from the strength of the young man.

The fact that he was also a Dan Realm expert, and yet, he could not even see his moves and was injured in an instant.

“I don’t have much patience!” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Wang Xian stared at the old man without any expression.

“I will speak!”

The old man’s forehead was covered in cold sweat as he spoke.

“A total of sixteen forces are active in the disordered region, and Yaofeng is one of them!

“The strongest one is the Devil Kid, an extremely strong faction in Asia. They have several Budding Realm experts, and the leader of the Devil Kid is known as the Lord of the disordered region.

“Next is Heavenly Spirits who came from Japan. Their strength is also compelling!”

The old man quivered as he introduced them to Wang Xian one by one.

“Lord of the disordered region? Does the disordered region have a master?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and asked this of the old man with his curiosity piqued.

“No... there is an island in the middle of the disordered region where major various Wandering Groups trade. That area is controlled by Devil Kid, and they maintain the order over there. Hence, the leader of Devil Kid proclaimed himself the Lord of the disordered region, and no one dared to retort!”

The old man answered quickly.

“Is that so? How strong is the Devil Kid?” asked Wang Xian curiously.

“There are at least five Budding Realm experts, and we don’t know about the rest!” the old man answered with cold sweat breaking out.

“How strong is Yaofeng then?” asked Wang Xian while staring at the old man.

“Not strong. In your eyes, we’re probably ants to you. We have only two Dan Realm experts,” said the old man with trepidation.

“Do you have a map of the disordered region, a detailed one?”

Wang Xian stared at him.

“Yes, as long as you let me live. I will...”

“You don’t have the right to bargain. Stop testing my patience!”

Wang Xian stared at the old man impassively, swarming him with oppression.

“Yes, ahem, yes!” The old man felt like the sky had fallen as he nodded in consternation. “I’ll get it for you!”

Wang Xian sank back in his chair, gazing at the red wine with some interest on his face.

“Oh, there is Spiritual Energy in it?”

Wang Xian poured a cup and was surprised by what he saw.

“This is the pure Blood Coral red wine. It’s very precious!”

The middle-aged man answered his inquiry on the floor, looking fearful.

“Here, for you!”

Soon, the old man held a few sheets of paper and handed them over with respect.

Wang Xian took it with eyes glistening with radiance.

“Let’s go!”

Wang Xian took the sheets of paper and headed outside. When he was at the door, he halted.

“I wanted to take you in as my subordinate. Unfortunately, you harbored thoughts that you shouldn’t have!”

“What?”

The old man widened his eyes when he heard Wang Xian as an Illusory sword penetrated his body instantly.

“This...You...”

The old man’s eyes were wide and round, filled with despair and disbelief.

We have too few Dragonians in Dragon Sect. Recruiting men from the disordered region and Wandering Group is not a bad choice!

Wang Xian recalled the records stated on the sheets of paper as he pondered.

He wanted to boost the strength of the Dragon Palace and Dragon Sect greatly in the shortest possible time so as to cope with the upcoming change in the world.

The Wandering Groups in the disordered region were just in line with his requirements!
