The Dragon King was defeated!

Seeing this scene, whether it was the immortals hiding in the surroundings or the billions of people who had turned off the livestream.

Close to 150 immortals were completely suppressing the 70 to 80 immortals of the Dragon Palace, with a maximum of 100 immortals.

There were quite a number of upper-level immortals in the Dragon Palace, but the upper-level immortals of the Nordic divine realm and the Yuwen clan were not weak either.

In a situation where they were almost equal, the difference in numbers was fifty. There was no chance for the Dragon King to win at all!

“With the blood of the Dragon Palace, I shall pay tribute to my daughter’s Life!”

Above the peaks of the Yuwen clan, the godly king sat on his divine throne. He slowly raised the divine staff in his hand. “Begin the trial!”

Begin the trial! The trial of the gods!

Boom! Boom! Boom

At this moment, the gods instantly scattered around and surrounded Wang Xian and the others.

“It’s about to start. The trial of the godly king is about to begin. The Dragon King is going to be finished!”

The streamer who was broadcasting from afar immediately retreated. His eyes were filled with shock.

“They’re here!”

Prime Minister Gui saw the group of gods surrounding them. He smiled and said faintly.

Wang Xian, who was sitting on the Dragon Throne, was full of smiles.

“Ah, what monster? What Monster Is This? !”

Suddenly, a shocked voice was heard. The voice was filled with shock and fear. It was the voice of an immortal.

The tense atmosphere and the tense battle were about to break out. It was shocked by this sudden voice.

Everyone could not help but look towards the west. What exactly was it that could cause an immortal to be so terrified.

“Hiss Hiss!”

In an instant, the sound of gasping could be heard. One by one, the immortal gods hidden in the void could not help but retreat.

Those who had not reached the level of an immortal God were even more frightened to the point of peeing on their butts.

It was a terrifying monster. This monster had a body size of more than 300 meters and was incomparably huge.

What shocked everyone the most was that it could still fly in the sky even without wings.

A savage aura surged over, as if it came from the primeval world.

This was definitely the largest creature on Earth.

When everyone saw this monster, a shocked expression appeared on their faces. It was too terrifying!

“Ao!”

The monster let out a slight roar, resounding throughout the surrounding sky. Even the surrounding clouds dissipated with this roar.

Kun, the first Kun, Xiao Lan.

“There are creatures on it!”

At this moment, an immortal God suddenly pointed at the top of the Kun and shouted in shock.

There were people and other creatures standing on it.

A swordsman with a golden sword!

A strange prawn that was emitting lightning and a demon monkey that was emitting demonic aura.

“This is?”

Upon seeing the familiar creature on it, everyone around was shocked.

“Dragon King!”

The voices of the members of the Dragon Palace came from the Kun.

One by one, the immortal gods of the Dragon Palace came to the back of Wang Xian.

One by one, a hundred immortal gods came to the back and scanned the surroundings with full of fighting spirit.

The Kun swayed its huge tail and its eyes the size of a house stared in the direction of the godly king. It stood quietly in the void without moving.

“This... this... a hundred immortal gods, a hundred immortal gods!”

“Oh my God, the godly monarch suddenly sent out sixty immortal gods, and the Dragon King sent out a hundred, a whole hundred!”

“Until the end, we’ll never know who is stronger. The Dragon Palace’s Dragon King is Awesome!”

“What godly monarch is that 350 meters or so? How can it be so huge? The Aura it gives off is so terrifying!”

The people who were watching all had looks of disbelief on their faces.

Just when everyone thought that the Dragon King was going to die, another 100 immortal gods and an abnormally terrifying creature appeared in the Dragon Palace.

This plot was too complicated!

The Godly King and all the immortal gods of the Yuwen clan slowly became embarrassed.

100 immortal gods and the Dragon Palace suddenly had 100 immortal gods.

The situation changed drastically in an instant. Now, the Dragon Palace had an additional 40 to 50 immortals compared to them.

This made the godly monarch’s face extremely ugly. His eyes sparkled.

The immortals from the Yuwen clan were even more terrified.

The gods from the three major celestial realms who came to pledge their loyalty also had ugly expressions. Their eyes were filled with solemnity.

“Hehe, is it beyond your expectations now?”

Wang Xian looked at the white-bearded old man with a smile and asked with a smile.

It was indeed out of his expectations that the Nordic celestial realm and the Yuwen clan would send out 148 immortals in one go.

However, Wang Xian did not mind. He had brought along the Hydra and 100 members of the Dragon Palace.

The Hydra was an old monster who had lived for more than 2,000 years. Its strength was already at the peak of the upper-level immortal realm for a few hundred years.

Now, this opportunity had allowed him to step into the extraordinary realm.

With his and Hydra’s strength, they were able to destroy the entire Nordic divine territory and the 148 immortals of the Yuwen clan.

The strength that he brought along was already a foolproof preparation. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

However, Wang Xian was not here purely to destroy them. He was here to train his troops!

That’s right, to train his troops.

It was not easy for him to meet a decent faction. He wanted the members of the Dragon Palace to fight and accumulate experience.

Hence, Prime Minister Gui asked Kun to bring a hundred immortals with him.

“Dragon King, I really didn’t expect this. I really didn’t expect that the wise man of the Nordic Divine Realm would be so wrong this time!”

The white-haired elder was a little agitated. He glanced at everyone around him with an embarrassed expression and growled softly.

“Judge me? Today will be the anniversary of your death!”

Wang Xian stood up and swept his cold gaze across all of them.

As soon as he finished his sentence, the members of the Dragon Palace behind him instantly stepped forward and swept their cold gazes across all of them.

There were more than two thousand members of the Dragon Palace. They were fighting against six to seven thousand members of the Northern European divine territory and the Yuwen clan.

“Good, good. I didn’t expect this. I really didn’t expect this!”

The god King’s face was filled with anger. He held the golden disc above his head and held the divine staff in his hand. “Dragon King, your strength is really far beyond our expectations. However, so what if your Dragon Palace has 200 immortals and gods?”

“As long as I kill you, you, the members of the Dragon Palace, will follow me to slaughter. Victory will still belong to us!”

“I am the king of all gods, Okerdin. I am an invincible existence on earth!”

The god King Okerding held the divine staff in his hand, and the light energy on his body flourished. He gave off an endless divine might, and his face was full of confidence and arrogance as he roared.

His aura, the god King’s Aura, instantly stunned everyone around him.

“So domineering. As expected of the god King. Facing such a situation, he is still so domineering. As expected of the king of the gods!”

“This is a true expert, a true king. The god King is right. If he can really kill the Dragon King quickly, this victory will still belong to the Nordic god domain and the Yuwen clan!”

The surrounding immortals and people watching the live broadcast were impressed by the god King’s domineering aura. They looked on in astonishment.
