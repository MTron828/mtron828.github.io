Chapter 1339: The item of the 1339 Dragon Palace, you are all waiting to die

Arrogant voices came from a huge room in front one after another, causing Wang Xian to slow down his footsteps. A hint of killing intent could be seen in his eyes.

“Sky Island dynasty, don’t think that just because you are in a marriage alliance with the one-leaf mainland dynasty, you don’t put us in your eyes!”

A muffled voice came from inside again. The voice was also filled with anger.

“I don’t think much of you. If you want it, take it. If you don’t want it, our Sky Island dynasty will help you take it!”

A proud voice sounded.

Wang Xian took a step forward and walked straight inside. He looked ahead and saw two old men sitting in the middle.

On both sides, Ba Qi and AO qitian sat on the left.

On the right, there was a dozen-meter-long electric eel and a three to four-meter-long, bloated Harpoon Demon Beast.

There were a few interspatial rings on the table.

“Dragon King!” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Upon seeing the three figures that suddenly appeared at the door, Ba Qi and AO qitian were slightly stunned. Their eyes were filled with excitement as they hurriedly walked over and bowed.

“Yes!”

Wang Xian nodded his head faintly and looked at the two old men in the middle.

“Oh? Dragon King, your name is quite big. Are you the leader of the Dragon Palace?”

The two old men were astonished when they saw Wang Xian walk in.

This was the first time they had seen the leader of the Dragon Palace in the half a year they had been in contact with the Dragon Palace.

“How is it?”

Wang Xian ignored the two old men and looked at Ba Qi and AO qitian indifferently.

“Dragon King, our strength is still too weak!”

Ba Qi’s eyes flickered when he heard Wang Xian’s words.

As an old man who had lived for more than a thousand years, he could naturally understand Wang Xian’s meaning when he saw his expression and simple question.

In the entire Dragon Palace, even Prime Minister Gui was not as experienced as Ba Qi when it came to people’s minds.

Ba Qi led a group of poisonous snakes under him to specialize in developing all kinds of poisons. Wang Xian still attached great importance to this department that had yet to take shape.

Poisons could be used to fight against people of a higher level. They could also kill people invisibly.

“It’s alright. Your strength is weak. You can slowly increase it!”

Wang Xian shook his head slowly.

“Eh? This Dragon King, I’m talking to you!”

The two elders saw that Wang Xian was ignoring them. One of the burly elders stared at him coldly.

Wang Xian turned his head and looked at the two of them. He walked to the front of the table and looked at them.

“How many months has it been since the deep sea spiritual spring was taken?”

He looked at the two people from the sky island empire calmly.

“You must be dumbfounded, Kid. You can ask your subordinates if it has been taken for a few months!”

The skinny elder beside the muscular elder leaned against the chair and looked at Wang Xian coldly.

Buzz

Just as the Skinny Elder finished his sentence, Wang Xian waved his arm and a ray of light instantly entered his body.

“Eh...”

The frail elder suddenly widened his eyes. His mouth was slightly open and he didn’t move at all!

“What?”

Wang Xian suddenly made his move and instantly killed the frail elder. This caused the electric eel, the harpoon, and the burly elder to be stunned.

They widened their eyes and stared at the frail elder who couldn’t sense any signs of life.

This...

This was a powerhouse at level three of the void interpretation stage. How could this be...

“You... You!”

The face of the burly old man changed drastically. He stood up in horror and a shield appeared on his left arm. A weapon that looked like a harpoon appeared in his right hand.

They stared at Wang Xian in horror.

“How many months has it been?”

Wang Xian stared at the old man indifferently and asked again.

“Gulp!”

The burly old man looked at the calm Wang Xian and beads of cold sweat appeared on his forehead. “Four... four months. Only four months including this time!”

At the side, the two level 2 Seethrough electric eel and harpoon demonic beasts swayed slightly and retreated backward.

Their eyes were filled with terror. They killed a level 3 Seethrough expert with a wave of their hands. What kind of strength was this?

“Four months, 100 billion a month, four months, 400 billion. If the compensation is 10 times that, then it will be 4 trillion!”

Wang Xian mumbled, “If the money is not enough, then we can only...”

As he spoke, his eyes flickered.

When the burly elder heard Wang Xian’s words, his pupils constricted slightly and he swallowed a mouthful of saliva.

“Do you guys know that our Dragon Palace discovered this place first?”

Suddenly, Wang Xian changed the topic. He raised his head and looked at the burly elder as he asked plainly.

“It’s an item without an owner. Those who are capable will get it!”

The eyes of the burly elder flickered. “However, if your dragon palace is powerful enough, in the future, when it comes to the distribution of the deep sea spiritual spring...”

“The Dragon Palace discovered a treasure and you guys still want to share it? Are you courting death?”

Wang Xian’s voice suddenly turned extremely cold. “It’s not easy to spit out four months worth of Spirit Stones!”

As he spoke, he waved his arm and the energy of the five elements annihilation was directed towards the burly old man.

“You... What do we have to discuss properly...”

Seeing Wang Xian’s attack, the burly old man’s face was filled with shock. He quickly raised his shield and exclaimed.

Boom

However, when the five elements annihilation energy landed on the shield, it immediately produced a loud explosion sound.

The burly old man’s face instantly revealed a look of horror. He spat out blood and widened his eyes in disbelief.

He was a top-notch expert of the Heaven Island dynasty, yet he was killed so easily.

This Dragon King...

“Dragon King, this Dragon King, let’s talk things over...”

The electric eel and the Harpoon Demon Beast were terrified when they saw Wang Xian killing two third level profound void martial stage powerhouses in two moves.

“Ba Qi, Qi Tian!”

Wang Xian turned around and looked at them.

“Dragon King, back then, Brother AO Qitian was killed by the leader of the Harpoon Demon Beast. The Electric Eel Demon Beast clan is also sinister and cunning. Now that you have returned, Dragon King, we can finally stop worrying!”

Ba Qi and Ao Qitian’s eyes were filled with killing intent as they said excitedly.

A few months ago, the Dragon Palace was weak. Even if they encountered a treasure land like the deep sea spiritual spring, they would not be able to occupy it.

Not only that, for some resources, they had to be suppressed by the Sky Island dynasty.

They had planned to lay low for a period of time and wait for the Dragon Palace’s strength to reach a certain level before fighting back.

They didn’t expect the Dragon King to return. Furthermore, the Dragon King’s strength had reached a terrifying level.

“It seems that many things have happened in the year since I Left!”

Wang Xian’s eyes were extremely cold. He looked at the two demonic beasts in the room and waved his arm.

“No, Dragon King. If you dare to kill us all, we...”

The two demonic beasts were horrified. They turned around and fled while roaring.

“Bang! Bang!”

However, Wang Xian waved his hand gently and the two demonic beasts fell to the ground.

“Kill all of them except the members of the Dragon Palace!”

Wang Xian walked out with a cold gaze. He looked at the group of humans and demonic beasts who were taking spiritual stones.

Among them, there were more than a thousand members of the Dragon Palace.

“Disciples of the Dragon Palace, Listen Up. No one is allowed to offend the items of the Dragon Palace. Those who do, die!”

“Give it to me, Kill!”
