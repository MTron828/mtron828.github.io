Boom! Boom! Boom

The huge fan carried a terrifying wind attribute law power. When he fanned the fan towards him, a vast typhoon was formed in front of the fan.

The terrifying attack made Wang Xian’s expression change drastically. He used the uninitiated holy wings to protect his vital points.

Boom

Waves of terrifying wind energy charged towards him directly.

!!

His arms and legs were blown away like dandelions the moment the wind energy attacked and disappeared.

Only the area protected by the incipient Saint Wings was not destroyed.

The terrifying force of the storm once again caused his body to fly into the distance.

This time, he flew even more ferociously and tragically.

Wang Xian felt that he was whistling in the air. The speed at which he was sent flying was twice as fast as his full speed flight.

When he bumped into other trees along the way, those trees didn’t even have the time to react!

What kind of concept was this?

His head began to crack. Wang Xian mobilized his energy to protect his head and heart with all his might.

He recovered and cracked again and again, causing Wang Xian’s face to be abnormally pale.

“Damn it. It’s been two days. It’s been two whole days, but I haven’t met a single fengyu. What exactly happened in the Windless Forest Valley?”

At the same time, an old man who was shrouded in wind-attribute laws scanned his surroundings with an embarrassed expression.

It had been more than two days since he had entered the windless forest. He had not seen a single wind jade.

There was only one treasure in the windless forest, the wind jade. However, he had not obtained a single one.

A few of the god Emperors who had entered had already returned.

He felt indignant. He had expended a huge amount of energy to continue going deeper. However, the result was the same as the entrance.

The Wind Jade did not even have a single feather.

This made him a little angry.

“The Windless Day has only lasted for three days. Now, time is about to pass. Damn it.”

He could not help but curse. He was prepared to return.

However, at this moment, something seemed to have flown out from the depths.

He was slightly stunned and quickly looked over.

“That’s a human?”

“What terrifying speed?”

“No, he was attacked. He’s already heavily injured!”

He raised his head and only saw a blurry appearance.

Seeing the figure disappear, he looked towards the depths of the windless forest valley again.

“How did he come out from the depths of the windless forest valley? What’s going on?”

“All the Wind Jade have disappeared. Is It related to this figure?”

His expression changed slightly as he looked towards the direction where he had disappeared. Gritting his teeth, he moved his body and chased in that direction.

However, due to the interference of the trees, his speed was extremely slow.

Bang! Bang! Bang

Under the attack of the tree at the end of the windless forest valley, Wang Xian once again experienced the feeling of being sent flying backwards.

This time, it was even more terrifying than the previous time.

The powerful impact caused his body to collapse rapidly. An attack caused him to be sent flying for billions of miles.

Halfway through, his body crashed into the huge mountain peak and directly broke through the mountain peak. One could imagine how terrifying that attack was!

Boom

At a spot in the windless forest, Wang Xian’s body crashed heavily into that spot, forming an incomparably huge pit.

“Cough Cough!”

Wang Xian, who was lying in the huge pit, coughed out fresh blood. His face was extremely pale.

The injury this time was more than ten times heavier than the previous one.

However, as long as he could preserve his life, it wouldn’t be difficult for him to recover.

He scanned his surroundings and revealed a speechless expression.

This attack caused him to fly back more than half of the windless forest.

Unlike the previous time, he didn’t encounter any beautiful women this time.

Buzz Buzz

At this moment, Wang Xian sensed that the communication stone in the mother nest was trembling. He took it out to take a look and revealed a smile on his face.

The Heaven’s formation and the eight Qi were about to rush over.

“Let’s recuperate here!”

Wang Xian hesitated for a moment and thought to himself.

After recuperating his injuries, he would look for invincible battle technique to reminisce about the old days before returning to the Dragon Palace.

His body moved and flew to a spot not far from the huge pit. He sat cross-legged there to recuperate his injuries.

This time, his injuries were indeed very serious. His body had been destroyed hundreds of times. If he did not have the body of a divine dragon and had strong dragon energy, he might have already died.

However, it was all worth it.

Sitting cross-legged on the ground, Wang Xian absorbed the surrounding spiritual energy and quickly recovered from his injuries. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“A loud noise came from this side. Let’s go and take a look.”

“Could it be that some treasures have been unearthed?”

“Treasures? You Dare to think about it. What other treasures are there in the windless forest besides Feng Yu?”

“We are really unlucky this time. We didn’t even get a few wind jade. D * mn it.”

However, not long after Wang Xian sat cross-legged and recovered, voices were heard.

On the right, more than 20 figures were flying over.

As they flew, they were chatting with each other. Their expressions were a little ugly.

After they entered this place, they didn’t have such good luck after encountering more than 20 Wind Jade.

They didn’t even obtain those 20-odd wind jades. This made them furious.

After failing to obtain anything for two days, they became even more irritable.

They rushed over immediately when they heard a loud noise.

“Eh? There’s a huge pit over there. There aren’t any treasures inside!”

More than 20 people flew over. They glanced around and frowned.

“Look, brother long, there’s a person there!”

At this moment, a middle-aged man suddenly pointed at Wang Xian who was sitting cross-legged on the ground.

“Eh?”

Everyone looked over and saw a young man who was covered in blood. His face was extremely pale.

The young man looked extremely weak.

“It’s him, brother long. He’s one of the few people we met earlier!”

Suddenly, a young man stared at Wang Xian and said in surprise.

“It seems to be true!”

The middle-aged man in the lead, brother long, sized up Wang Xian and raised his eyebrows.

He had some impression of the young man in front of him. When they first met the twenty-odd Feng Yu, there were already five people there. This young man was one of them.

At this moment, Wang Xian, who was sitting cross-legged, also sensed that someone had arrived.

He opened his eyes slightly and swept his gaze across them. He also recognized that they were the disciples of the bhang sect.

He took out an elixir and placed it in his mouth. He continued to close his eyes and ignored them.

“This fellow’s injuries seem to be very serious!”

Seeing Wang Xian open his eyes and close them again, one of the middle-aged men said.

“Brother Long, did you notice the elixir that he took just now? It seems to be of a very high level!”

All of a sudden, a slightly skinny middle-aged man on the left had a fiery glow in his eyes.

“What?”

Brother Long looked at the skinny middle-aged man in puzzlement.

The skinny middle-aged man didn’t say anything else. He stared at the figure in front of him and couldn’t help but lick his lips.

The next moment, he moved and took out a confinement ring in his hand. He locked onto Wang Xian.
