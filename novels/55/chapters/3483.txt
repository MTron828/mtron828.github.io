3484 2483 spirit demon king’s domineering aura!

“Double Dragon Eyes, light reversal, Dragon Eye Void!”

Sacred Dragon Son saw spirit demon king’s innate true treasure attack, and his expression changed drastically as he roared.

Two dragon eyes revolved around him, and illusory dragon eyes appeared around him. The two dragon eyes seemed to form a special space domain.

The innate supreme treasure, the two dragon eyes, blocked the attacks of the claws.

“Spirit Demon Race, you are provoking us.”

The Sacred Dragon Son roared with an extremely ugly expression.

“Haha, provoking? In the future, no one from the dragon palace can touch the disciples of my spirit demon race, not even your sacred dragon lineage!”

The Spirit Demon King stood up and laughed wildly with confidence, he stared at the sacred dragon son and said, “You actually brought a connate cardinal treasure. Hehe, then let me see if your sacred Dragon’s dragon eyes are more powerful than my spirit demon claws of hell!”

“Kill!”

As he spoke, he growled and waves of dark power surged toward the hell claws.

“Crack Crack Crack!”

In the next moment, more claws extended out from the void. The densely packed claws seemed to have a life of their own as they clawed toward the Sacred Dragon Son and the others.

Holy Dragon Son’s expression changed drastically when he saw this scene.

“Holy Dragon Heavy Eyes, let’s Go!”

Holy Dragon Son’s expression was abnormally ugly. He waved his hand, and the surrounding Dragon Eye Phantoms slowly overlapped, forming an incomparably powerful dragon eye defense.

He roared at the light dragon and red eye beside him.

The few of them had ugly expressions, but they didn’t dare to stay any longer and directly disappeared.

If there was a conflict between the spirit demon race and the spirit demon king, it was very likely that more level three masters of the universe would come.

At that time, even if they had innate supreme treasures, it would be difficult for them to escape.

Wang Xian looked at the confrontation in the sky. While he was shocked, he was also slightly grateful to the spirit demon king.

He had helped Ling Honggu to capture the pink skull, but the other party had helped him block the son of the Holy Dragon and even threatened to protect him. It still warmed him up.

The spirit demon race could be considered a rare friend of his!

“Princess Ling Honggu, thank you for protecting me, Lord Spirit Demon King. Thank you very much!”

Wang Xian cupped his hands at Ling Honggu and thanked him.

“There’s no need. You’ve helped me. It’s normal for me to help you, isn’t it? This is karma.”

Ling Honggu smiled at him.

“HMPH, a member of the holy dragon lineage dares to barge into my spirit demon race and act so arrogantly? If they don’t have any innate treasures, I’ll kill them all!”

At this moment, the spiritual demon king flew over and transformed into an old man. He smiled and said.

“Thank you, Lord Spiritual Demon King, for your help!”

Wang Xian smiled and thanked the spiritual demon king.

“Haha, it’s a small matter. Just as Hong Gu said, everything has a cause and effect. In the future, no one will dare to touch you, little brother Wang Xian, in the territory of our spiritual demon race!”

The spiritual demon king laughed and said nonchalantly.

“The Holy Dragon lineage is very strong. They also have the angel race behind them.”

Wang Xian said.

“Haha, Little Brother, Don’t worry. They have a backer behind them and so do we. Don’t worry, the Holy Dragon lineage wouldn’t dare to say a word!”

The spiritual demon king smiled and didn’t seem to mind.

Wang Xian smiled. It was rumored that the spiritual demon race had the skeleton king as their backer. It seemed that this was true.

This was also the trump card of the spirit demon king who dared not to be afraid of the Holy Dragon lineage.

“Thank you, Lord Spirit Demon King. Thank you, Princess Spirit Red Bone. I happened to obtain some things in the land of devil bones this time. Princess Spirit Red Bone should be able to use them.”

Since the other party was so loyal, Wang Xian was not a stingy person.

He took out the pink skeleton palm and the pink skeleton finger directly.

“Huh?”

When the spirit red skeleton and the spirit demon king saw the pink palm and the finger bone, they were slightly stunned. Their eyes shone brightly.

“This… This is the pink skeleton palm and the finger bone. Both of them have reached the level of a second-tier universe overlord. This… young master Wang Xian, you actually obtained two of them?”

The spirit red skeleton stared at Wang Xian with a face full of shock.

“It’s also a coincidence. I obtained this pink skeleton palm from a skeleton who ambushed me. That skeleton seems to be on the bounty of your spirit demon race. I suppressed this pink skeleton finger bone in the pool of bones in the Abyss.”

Wang Xian smiled and said.

“This pink skeleton palm and finger bone are very precious to me.” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Ling Honggu’s eyes revealed an excited look.

“Honggu, you have fused the pink skeleton head with this palm and finger bone. Your strength might be stronger than even father!”

The Spirit Demon King also revealed an excited look.

“Okay!”

Ling Hong Gu nodded and looked at Wang Xian. “Thank you, young master Wang Xian. I will use the six universes to dominate the trade with you.”

As he spoke, he looked at his father who was beside him.

“Sure.”The spirit demon king nodded.

“The market price of the Pink Skull’s palm and finger bones is not worth that much. Let’s make it four!”

Wang Xian shook his head and said.

“It’s worth six. These two pink skeleton parts are worth ten of the same level, let alone six. You Don’t have to decline. Let’s make it six!”

The Spirit Demon King said directly.

The spirit red skeleton also nodded with a smile.

Wang Xian looked at them and nodded with a smile.

The six corpses of the level two demon skeletons of the universe dominator were not enough to upgrade the Taiji Dragon disc again.

However, the corpses of the six level two demon skeletons were extremely precious to him.

If he used them to upgrade the strength of the Dragon Palace, he would be able to produce six level two masters of the universe.

He did not say anything and completed the transaction.

“Young master Wang Xian, it seems that the Hundred Cities Alliance and the Holy Dragon lineage are going to deal with Your Dragon Palace. Why don’t the members of Your Dragon Palace come to the land of the demon bones? They won’t dare to be presumptuous here!”

Ling Honggu brought Wang Xian to a large skeletal hall and said to him.

“There’s no need. They want to kill us. We are even prepared to kill them. Thank you for your good intentions, Princess Ling Honggu!”

Wang Xian shook his head.

The Dragon Palace had never been afraid of anyone in a battle.

Over at the Hundred Cities Alliance, the Dragon Palace’s revenge would begin when the eight-limbed demonic fiend and the rest took control of the city.

In a few decades, a few hundred years, Jian Yun would slowly play with them.

He would start with the Hundred Cities Alliance!

As for the Holy Dragon lineage, there would come a day when Wang Xian would destroy them.

“Then, young master Wang Xian must be careful. I’ll give you this. As long as you’re in the land of the demon bones, you’ll be able to teleport directly to the inner regions of our spirit demon race.”

The Spirit Red Bone gave him a teleportation item.

“Then, I shall accept it without hesitation. I wonder if Princess Ling Honggu still has any information regarding the pink skeleton parts? If she does, I can look for them and buy a good price for you, Princess!”

Wang Xian said with a smile.

“I only know that there are still some in the land of blood plasma. However, I don’t know the exact location. I have searched for hundreds of millions of years and only managed to suppress one pink skeleton head. It’s not that easy to find it!”

Ling Honggu smiled and shook his head.
