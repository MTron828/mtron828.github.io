Chapter 1351: 1351

“The one leaf mainland dynasty will be destroyed. Those who submit will live, and those who resist will die!”

The Demon Monkey’s roar resounded across the entire island.

One leaf mainland dynasty, and the island was a city.

300 demon monkeys stood in front of the city wall.

The strongest demon monkey, a rank 1 profound void tier demon monkey, was 10 meters tall. He stood in front and stared coldly at the city in front of him.

Behind him, 300 demon monkeys stood behind him. Their violent auras charged forward.

All of them grinned and raised their heads with ferocious expressions.

In the sky, Wang Xian sat upright on the dragon throne. His gaze swept across the area below and continued to look forward. There were no fluctuations at all.

One demon monkey at the Seethrough realm and 300 demon monkeys who had yet to reach the Seethrough realm. With such strength, it was more than enough to take down a city.

With the bloodline of the Divine Dragon, as the number of demon combat divisions in the Dragon Palace, each demon monkey had the ability to fight above their level.

Now, the weakest rank eight transcendents in the Dragon Palace could fight above their level and could fight against rank nine transcendents.

This was equivalent to the weakest rank nine transcendents.

It was enough to take down a city!

“What? The One Leaf dynasty is going to be destroyed? Submit or Die?”

On the city wall at the north gate of the island, the citizens of the one leaf dynasty glanced at the 300 devil monkeys in front of the city in fear.

Then, they looked at the sky. The group that gave off a terrifying aura flew towards the center of their dynasty!

There were dark clouds in a five-kilometer radius, and nine terrifying creatures that were thirty meters long.

There was also a young man sitting on the throne.

Everything was too shocking.

“City Lord, are we... are we surrendering?”

A middle-aged man walked to the side of the island Lord in the center of the city wall. He stared at the three hundred or so black and violent creatures below with a face full of fear.

The old man stood there, his expression constantly changing. His gaze was fixed on the 300 demon monkeys in front of him!

“That demon monkey at the front is at the first level of the insightful void tier. The rest have not reached the insightful void tier!”

Among the group of people who had issued the alarm earlier, one of the half-step insightful void tier old men stared at the group of demon monkeys with flickering eyes!

“What? There’s only one insightful void tier? And it’s at the first level of the insightful void tier?”

Some of the people around were slightly stunned when they heard his words, and they asked in surprise.

“Yes, the treasure in my hand can detect the opponent’s level!”

The old man looked at the stone plate in his hand, and his eyes flickered.

“Only one at the first level of the void interpretation, and three hundred creatures that have yet to reach the void interpretation want our island to surrender?”

“That group of people just now was very terrifying, but they only left behind this group of creatures, and they want to destroy us?”

On the city walls, the eyes of some experts flickered as their gazes landed on the island Lord.

“Island Lord, if we submit, the other party will definitely take all of our treasures. It’s simply wishful thinking to think that they can take down our sky blue island just by relying on this group of people!”

“That’s right, the majority of their group of experts are flying towards the imperial city, leaving behind only a few weaklings who want us to submit. They simply don’t put us in their eyes!”

Some of the big families on the Sky Blue Island said with cold expressions.

This was their foundation. If they submitted, their family’s treasures would definitely be plundered by the other party.

Their thousand year foundation would be destroyed in an instant.

How could they be willing to accept this?

If it was that group of terrifying creatures from before, they would not hesitate to surrender.

But just the ones in front of them..

They were not convinced!

They could totally defeat this group of beasts and temporarily move all the treasures of their clan to another place, waiting for the news from the imperial city.

“You want to make us submit? Relying on you bunch of beasts, you’re too arrogant!”

“Do you really think that our sky blue island is so easy to break through? Do you really think that relying on an expert at the first level of the profound void tier and a group of people who have not reached the profound void tier can make us submit!”

“What fools! What a bunch of Fools!”

The Sky Blue Island Lord sensed that the enormous strength had completely disappeared from his sight, and he stared at the 300 demon monkeys below with an extremely cold gaze!

“Those who resist, die!”

The leader of the demon monkeys slightly exerted strength in his arm and tightly held the ocean-pacifying godly needle.

The level three dragon palace-level ocean-pacifying godly needle could become five hundred meters long and five to six meters wide.

“Kill!”

He roared, and his black hair stood up like needles.

On the city wall, under everyone’s gaze, the ocean-pacifying needle in demon monkey’s hand grew bigger and bigger.

Finally, a five-hundred-meter-long ocean-pacifying needle appeared in front of the north gate.

His ten-meter-tall body carried the ocean-pacifying needle and directly attacked the city gate in front of him.

“Boom!”

What was the concept of a five-hundred-meter-tall ocean-pacifying needle?

The city wall in front of him was close to two hundred meters high. Such a city wall could be considered extremely lofty.

However, in front of the five-hundred-meter-tall ocean-pacifying needle, it was still not enough.

On the city wall, under everyone’s shocked gazes, the ocean-pacifying needle directly landed on the city wall.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

It was as easy as crushing dried twigs, as easy as crushing dried twigs!

The 200-meter-long city wall was like paper to the people of Sky Blue Island.

Under the powerful attack of the ocean-pacifying needle, it collapsed.

The first-level void interpretation formation was instantly broken.

“Kill!”

The ocean-pacifying needle landed, and the city was broken!

Behind them, 300 berserk demon monkeys were emitting monstrous demonic flames. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Pitch-black dragon scales slowly covered their bodies.

They held metal clubs and directly attacked the destroyed city.

“Roar! Anyone who resists will die!”

The demon monkey holding the ocean-pacifying needle roared, and the ocean-pacifying needle returned to 30 meters in size.

Holding such a huge club, it directly attacked the island owner in the center of the city wall.

“What... this... how is this possible! ?”

On the city wall of Sky Blue Island, everyone was stunned by the Demon Monkey’s staff!

The indestructible city wall and the powerful protection of the array formation were instantly forced.

Looking at the 30-meter-long golden staff in the hand of the level 1 void interpretation creature that carried terrifying demonic qi, everyone’s hearts trembled!

“Damn it, damn it, I completely underestimated the strength of this creature. What kind of weapon is the metal staff in his hand? How can it become bigger and smaller?”

The Sky Blue Island Lord’s expression changed drastically as he looked at the demon monkey that was attacking him. With a wave of his arm, a sky blue staff appeared in his hand.

With a light wave of his staff, a thousand-meter-large wave directly charged towards the demon monkey.

“Boom!”

However, the ocean-pacifying needle directly smashed towards the huge wave that was descending from the sky.

The powerful water energy immediately disappeared.

The ocean-pacifying needle fixed the water energy. It could be said that the ocean-pacifying needle was the nemesis of water energy!

The huge ocean-pacifying needle directly smashed toward the sky blue island Lord.

The old man’s face was filled with shock, and his eyes were filled with fear.

Stomp through the city!

Impudent and unruly!

This rod!

I’ll turn you into ashes!
