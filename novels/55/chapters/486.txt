Chapter 487: A Set-up

“Some of the friends from Dubai are here.”

At about seven, a group of people arrived at the ballroom in white and black robes with neatly-combed beards.

There were young and middle-aged men.

Behind them stood a group of ladies, wearing black robes without their faces veiled except for Shayla.

The colors were distinctive.

When the group arrived, many people from the ballroom crowded over.

Several young men in white and ladies in black stalked over with beaming faces.

“Come over, ladies and gentlemen!”

Several young men waved passionately at them.

“Hey, it looks like we’re late!”

They came over, sat beside them, and replied to them while smiling.

“No, you’re not. We came early, but we just had some boring chats. Shall we have some fun later?”

Tang Lingling’s boyfriend was having a warm chat with them.

“Sure, no problem!”

“I’m bored, lass.”

Wang Xian, who was bored seeing them exchanging conversations, told Mu Xiaowan.

“Why don’t I introduce you to some Dubai girls? What do you think?”

Mu Xiaowan suddenly brightened up her eyes and whispered to him, “You can settle down here and marry four wives. Four! The thought of it is thrilling, isn’t it?”

“I already have two girlfriends now. Why do I care about which country I’m in?”

Wang Xian chuckled as he spoke.

“It’s an exotic taste. Don’t you think it’s a different world with foreign babes?”

Mu Xiaowan raised her eyebrows at him.

“Xiao Wan, come over here. I want you to meet some people!”

At this time, Mu Xiaowan’s mother beckoned her out of the blue.

“Yes, mum!”

Mu Xiaowan was dispirited instantly as she looked at Wang Xian. “Don’t go away. I’ll be right back.”

“My mum is simply too bothersome. She has been introducing friends to me here, and wants me to go to school over here,” she muttered as she got up and walked over.

“Lingling, let’s have a dance in the center!”

At this time, Tang Lingling’s boyfriend cast a glance at Mu Xiaowan and the young men beside him. Then, he pouted his lip and brought Tang Lingling away.

“Heh heh.”

The remaining three young men exchanged smirks with a hint of coldness.

“Liang Liang, take this phone and film it.”

“What? Film what?”

As soon as they took their leave, Yang Ze fished out his phone with his lips curled as he instructed the female companion beside him.

“This brat is such a nuisance. He embarrassed Qing Wen, Gao Yang, and me. Besides, Qing Wen was pissed at the sight of him. I want you to film what happens later on. I’ll make sure he’s a laughing stock even abroad, and I want all the people back in China to know about it!”

Yang Ze curled his lips slightly.

Performing such means was as easy as the ABC’s for him.

He cast a glance at Gao Yang and Qing Wen with a teasing look.

The short-haired Qing Wen gestured an ‘okay’ sign. He then turned and muttered to a Dubaian girl beside him with a beaming face.

“Sure!”

That girl revealed a bright smile. There was a trace of a teasing smirk when she looked at Wang Xian.

Yang Ze, Qing Wen, and Gao Yang rested on the sofa and watched with a playful look.

“Hi, handsome. How are you?”

After Mu Xiaowan left, Wang Xian was playing on his phone out of boredom when he heard a sudden voice.

He craned his neck up and was astounded to see a Dubai girl in a black robe.

“Hi, what’s up?”

“Nothing, I saw you alone with your phone. Are you that bored?” asked the girl with a broad smile.

“Yes, a little!”

Wang Xian put his phone away out of courtesy.

“Shall we have a dance over in the middle of the ballroom?” said the girl with a smile.

“No, I don’t know how to dance. It’s okay.”

Wang Xian was taken aback. According to the white book given to him by Adjaya, the Dubai ladies did not get intimate contact with anyone, in particular strangers.

What’s with the difference here?

“It’s rude to turn a girl down!”

The girl was slightly stunned as she spoke smilingly. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“I’m really sorry!”

Wang Xian shook his head. The girl before him was not pretty at all. Besides, he noticed a bunch of people watching them with a playful look.

He stood up to change his seat.

“Hur?”

That girl frowned and reached out to grab his arm.

Wang Xian raised his eyebrow, looked down and caught her arm. He peered over his shoulder at the three young men with disdain in his eyes.

“You bunch of scumbags!”

“Let me go!”

Upon seeing Wang Xian grabbing onto her clothes, she pulled away from him with force.

Ssst!

She was apparently stronger than the average person as her sleeves were ripped off straightaway.

“Brat, are you seeking your doom? How dare you be so touchy over here?”

Seeing such a situation, the three young men stood up immediately and threw him death stares.

Apparently, the other young men in white robes were not that surprised as they stared at Wang Xian with ridicule.

“Have you filmed it?” asked Yang Ze to the female companion beside him.

“Yes, no audio. From this angle, accompanied by some cuttings and lead-in, this shows exactly how he was trying to take advantage of that girl!” that female star said with a broad smile.

“Great. Later I’ll get my manager to look for a media outlet for some publicity. This will certainly disgrace him to the max!”

“Hehe, Yang Ze, he should count himself unlucky to provoke you guys.”

“Yes, acting brazenly in our territory is as good as seeking death!”

“Molesting and disrespecting our friend here. Brat, you’re insolent, huh!” exclaimed Qing Wen as he pointed his finger coldly at Wang Xian.

“How dare you commit this kind of thing over here. Looks like your nose is up in the air!”

Several Dubai friends stood up and sneered at Wang Xian.

“Arrest him and throw him into the cell for a few days. This kind of person is a disgrace to us!”

They were bawling at Wang Xian.

That girl seemed to be shaking in her shoes with her head lowered, clutching onto the sleeves at her arm where it was torn. That look of hers obviously looked like Wang Xian had bullied a Dubai girl.

“A set-up?”

Wang Xian looked coldly at the crowd, who had been staring at him.

The three young men curled their lips. “Such a disgrace to us. Little did we expect you would do such a thing. People like you should be taught a lesson and let everyone know your true nature!”

“Hur? What’s going on?”

“What happened?”

At this time, some of the surrounding people overheard the commotion and popped over with curiosity.

The ballroom was huge, and there were over three hundred guests in it. Many of them asked around as they were attracted by the commotion.

“This fellow was touchy to my friend!” said Qing Wen to the spectating crowd with a cold face as he pointed to Wang Xian.
