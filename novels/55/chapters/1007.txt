Chapter 1008: 1009 deep pit

Translator: 5496903

Wang Xian didn’t really care about size.

It was fine for an old man to address him as ‘little brother’or ‘young man’. However, Wang Xian had some objections when a lady called him ‘young man’.

Therefore, she could only address him as ‘big sister’or ‘Big Sister’.

Even though she was much older than him.

Wang Xian looked at Zhang Fengying who was completely convinced by him. A faint smile appeared on his face.

“When I lowered my head just now, I saw a demonic beast down there. Hence, I killed it!”

Wang Xian looked at her and said to her with a serious expression.

“You...”

Zhang Fengying saw that he still didn’t tell her. She looked embarrassed as she gritted her teeth and stared at him. “I’ve already called you Big Brother. Why aren’t you telling me?”

“It’s my duty. You’ve lost!”

Wang Xian said indifferently and looked ahead. “Let’s go. Let’s continue forward!”

“Alright, Alright!”

After witnessing Wang Xian’s perverse detection technique, the group of people hurriedly followed behind him.

“Auntie, let’s follow him!”

Zhang Yitian walked to her side, pulled her arm and shouted.

“Xiao Tian, are you sure that he is a new student of Your Demon Hunters Academy?”

Zhang Fengying asked Zhang Yitian with a solemn face.

“Although he hasn’t been to the academy many times, he is indeed a student of our academy. Isn’t he a pervert?”

Zhang Yitian nodded and whispered.

“Do you know what background he has?”

Zhang Fengying asked expressionlessly.

“I don’t know!”

Zhang Yitian shook his head.

Zhang Fengying’s eyes flickered as she followed closely behind Wang Xian.

“Bang, Bang, Bang!”

Wang Xian walked toward the center. With a wave of his arm, Ao Jian and the rest immediately charged toward him.

With a tap of the lightning strike wood in his hand, the wind-winged Savage Fish Demon Beast was killed.

This miraculous technique made the members of the Void Beast Mercenary Group and amethyst mercenary group widen their eyes. Their eyes were filled with shock.

Zhang Fengying had been staring at Wang Xian the entire time. She did not see any trace of him.

“Could it be that his bloodline level is very high?”

She thought to herself. Then, she looked at the group of Golden Swordfish and her eyes were filled with astonishment.

“His subordinates are so powerful. All of them are at extraordinary level six!”

Zhang Yitian and Xia houming were also looking at Ao Jian and the rest in astonishment.

The strength of a transcendent-level rank-6 was equivalent to that of a leader or deputy leader in the East Sea city mercenary group.

In fact, many of the leaders of the mercenary groups were only at transcendent-level rank-6.

Eleven subordinates who were at transcendent-level rank-6 were already quite powerful.

They walked for five hours without any obstacles.

Along the way, they encountered the highest demonic beasts that were at transcendent level six as well. All of them were easily killed by Wang Xian and the rest.

“There’s a deep pit in front of us. It used to be the central area of the territory of the winged howler fish!”

Old Zeng’s voice rang out as everyone looked ahead.

There was a huge empty space there. From Afar, one could see the caracal boas entrenched there. They were entrenched on the surrounding wind chime trees as though they were guarding the empty space!

“Is that the deep pit of the cave?”

Wang Xian looked over.

The deep pit of the cave was the central area of the wind-winged fish in the past. It was also the place where the top-grade wind-winged fish lived.

This was the starting point of the cave. From here, one could enter any part of the cave.

Along the way, they did not discover any treasure with the induction stone plate. They could only enter from here and enter the cave.

Ever since the top-grade wind-wing savage fish were killed, this place had become an entrance.

The wind-wing savage fish entered the main entrance.

According to the information, the wind-wing Savage Fish’s treasure house should be not far from the main entrance.

“It seems that we did not cause any commotion along the way. Otherwise, there would not be a brocade scale boa guarding this place!”

Elder Zeng looked ahead, his face beaming with joy.

As long as there was no commotion, it was a good thing.

If a powerful transcendent rank 8 expert came here and attracted the attention of the wind wing savage fish, they would hide in secret.

You had no idea where they were hiding or where their treasures were.

“First, we have to destroy the hundreds of transcendent rank 5 and 6 Caracas, and not allow them to transmit their voices!”

Elder Zeng looked at the deep pit in the cave and said softly.

“We have prepared a soundless formation at transcendent level seven here. We have set it up in the surroundings so that we can’t transmit our voices out!”

Xia houming took out a formation compass and said to them.

“Let’s end this as soon as possible!”

Zhang Fengying looked at Wang Xian and said.

“Alright, let’s end this as soon as possible!”

A group of people nodded their heads. Four wind attribute experts at transcendent level six took out the formation and immediately went over to hide.

“Kill!”

When elder Zeng saw that the formation was set up, he let out a soft shout and charged forward.

On the way, Zhang Fengying was initially on guard, and then it was Wang Xian. Now, it was finally time for him to show his prowess!

“Charge!”

The members of the amethyst mercenary group and the Void Beast mercenary group charged forward immediately.

Wang Xian followed closely behind. Eleven Golden Swordfish held golden longswords in their hands and followed behind.

Buzz

At the deep pit of the cave, more than a hundred caracal boas noticed their arrival and let out a roar.

A few caracal boas swept their tails heavily on the wind chime tree. The wind chimes on the wind chime tree swayed.

However, they did not hear any sound.

The soundless formation was an extremely useless wind attribute formation. At this moment, it could bring out a miraculous effect.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

“Hualala!”

When Wang Xian rushed into the formation, he heard the roar and the sound of wind chimes.

A smile appeared on Wang Xian’s face. He held the lightning strike wood in his hand. The wood was emitting green and blue rays of light!

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

He waved his arm and a thorny vine that was accompanied by lightning struck the dozen or so caracal caracal at the level six transcendents in front of him.

Bam! Bam! Bam

However, before his attack could land, a thousand-meter-long wind whip lashed onto the caracal boas instantly, tearing their skin and flesh.

“HMPH!”

A cold snort came from beside his ear. Wang Xian looked over. Zhang Fengying rolled her eyes at him and looked at him provocatively. “Let’s see who kills the most!”

Wang Xian found it funny. She wanted to get back at him for her failure in Scouting.

Wang Xian smiled and waved his arm. A dense azure dragon aura landed on a chime tree.

“Spirit Enchantment!”

He shouted softly. The chime tree seemed to have come to life as it instantly attacked the surrounding brocade scaled boas.

He leaped onto the tree. With the lightning strike wood in his hand, he swept across the surrounding ferocious beasts!

“Someone actually arrived before us!”

At this moment, a large group of people suddenly arrived not far from them. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

There were more than a hundred people in total. Some of them were students from the Demon Hunter College, while the others were mercenaries from outside the college.

When they saw the battle in front of them, their faces revealed a look of surprise.
