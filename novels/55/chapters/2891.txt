Chapter 2892: The starry sky of 2892 trembled

“Master, no, no, give me a chance. Don’t kill me, don’t kill me!”

In the middle of the battlefield, Tian Zi’s terrified voice rang out. He was completely bound by the chains. When he saw the killing intent in Tian Chen’s eyes, his body trembled violently and he begged for mercy.

“Just kill him. Let It Pass. Let Everything Pass!”

Tian Chen’s gaze was fixed on this disciple whom he had taught for tens of millions of years. He slowly closed his eyes and said to Ao Qitian and the rest.

“Keke Keke, if you want to talk about Tian Chen, you’re too soft-hearted. Let me help you torture him!”

Ba Qi laughed strangely and moved to the side of Tian Zi. With a wave of his arm, he slapped Tian Zi’s face.

“Deceiving one’s master and destroying one’s ancestors will result in one’s soul dissipating!”

As Ba Qi spoke, he waved his arm, and dark energy surged towards Tian Zi.

“Ahhhhhhh!”

Agonizing screams rang out. Tian Chen closed his eyes, but there was not the slightest fluctuation.

The agonizing screams added some terror to the entire battlefield.

When some of the experts from the Wizard Association heard the agonizing screams from their god emperors, their bodies trembled.

What kind of pain was it that could make a god-emperor so miserable?

“Keke Keke!”

The eight-headed man let out a strange cry. Black Flesh and blood gushed out from his arms and drilled into his body, torturing him continuously.

“Ahhhh!”

The screams of pain reverberated throughout the entire battlefield. Apart from some god-king level experts who were still resisting, the rest of the people were all kneeling on the ground.

When that blood-curdling scream reached their ears, it caused their bodies to continuously tremble.

“Prime Minister Gui, everything is settled!”

In less than five minutes, all the godly monarch powerhouses of the Witch Formation Association were killed.

Ao Jian flew over and reported to Prime Minister Gui with a smile.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

On the side, in the sky above the central battlefield, the Nine Wind Divine Dragons roared excitedly. Their voices spread throughout the entire Wu mountain.

Along with them, everyone on the Wu mountain knelt down.

This meant that the era of the Shaman Association had ended, and a new era was about to begin.

“Eight-limbed demonic fiend, you poisonous horned dragons should have received a lot of information, right? Take over this territory and lead some members to bring all the treasures here!”

“The other disciples of the Dragon Palace, clean up the battlefield!”

Prime Minister Gui immediately ordered.

“Yes!”

The members of the Dragon Palace immediately responded.

At this moment, Wang Xian slowly walked out from the void God nation in the sky and looked down.

Roar! Roar

The nine wind divine dragons let out a low roar and flew toward Wang Xian. They circled around him.

Everyone’s eyes were focused on the Dragon King in the sky. Their eyes were filled with reverence.

In this battle, apart from the monarch who escaped, everyone else was left here.

Everyone above the godly monarch level was killed!

The destruction of the imperial court and the Formation Wizard Association were all created by the Dragon King!

He destroyed the two major forces and killed the formation Wizard Association!

He led the Dragon Palace to rise up in a short period of time and became the Overlord.

After today’s battle, the Dragon Palace would completely shake the entire starry sky.

Destroying two major factions in one fell swoop, ending the era of two peak factions. This was extremely terrifying!

“I am the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace. In the future, the Heaven Wizard realm will be taken over by the Dragon Palace. Anyone who disagrees will be killed without mercy!”

Wang Xian stood there high and mighty as he swept his gaze across everyone below. He swept his gaze across the surrounding void space.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

As soon as he finished speaking, terrifying dragon roars shook the world.

It announced the position of the Dragon Palace in this void space.

“Hurry up and pay your respects to the Dragon King!”

Mo Sha looked down at all the disciples of the Cheng Witch Association and the imperial court who were kneeling on the Wu Mountain and shouted sternly.

“Pay your respects to the Dragon King!”

On the Wu Mountain, everyone’s bodies trembled and they immediately shouted loudly.

“We pay our respects to the Dragon King!”

One after another, shouts resounded throughout the area.

“The Dragon King has discovered us!”

“With the Dragon King’s strength, he can naturally sense our existence!”

“The Dragon Palace is about to take over the Heaven Magus region. With the Dragon Palace’s terrifying strength, submit!”

The experts of the Heaven Magus region who were hiding in the void immediately appeared.

The Heaven Magus region was not unified by the Shamans Association, just like the Imperial Star region in the past.

Other than the Heaven Magus region, there were also a few large factions. Although they did not have existences at the divine emperor level, there were quite a number of peak divine kings.

At this moment, after witnessing the terrifying strength of the Dragon Palace, they did not dare to take any chances.

They revealed themselves one by one.

“We pay our respects to the Dragon King!”

They stood in the void and knelt down on one knee towards the Dragon King.

“Okay!”

Wang Xian swept his gaze across them and nodded his head faintly.

“Let’s go. Let’s go to the center of the Witch Union’s Witch Mountain!”

He looked at the members of the Dragon Palace and flew towards the front of the Witch Mountain.

According to the information he obtained from the Wizards, the Witch Mountain was a huge treasure trove.

It had a strength that had stood for a billion years, and it was a nest that had been in operation for a billion years.

Any item that was taken out would be fought over by countless experts.

It was not an exaggeration to say that if all the treasures inside were exchanged for resources, the Dragon Palace would be able to produce more than a dozen God emperors.

Secondly, he had obtained many treasures in the Magi’s void God realm.

The more precious ones were the substitute puppets, which could represent one’s death. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

They were absolute life-saving treasures!

In addition, there were all sorts of treasures. The Magus’secret manuals were a huge treasure trove.

“Apart from these, the Dragon Palace has killed seven God emperors, including the Magus. The Magus is a rank 2 god Emperor, which can increase the Dragon Palace’s strength by one rank 2 god Emperor.”

“The remaining six corpses can increase the number of six. If It’s the void divine kingdom, we can let the devouring dragon absorb the excess. As for the others, we might have to let the dragon palace absorb them first. The Void Divine Kingdom that the Dragon Palace absorbs nine attributes can reach level eight!”

Wang Xian mumbled as his eyes sparkled.

The harvest this time was absolutely terrifying.

His resources were only at the level of celestial thearch.

There were more than 50 corpses at the peak of the celestial thearch, as well as a large number of treasures in the divine nation.

In short, the strength of the Dragon Palace would be greatly enhanced this time.

“The resources here are enough for me to get another upgrade!”

He narrowed his eyes slightly and was in a very good mood!

He moved and soon arrived at the center of the Witch Mountain. He glanced at the center of this large force and smiled.

“The Dragon King and the others have gone to the center of the Witch Mountain!”

“I’m afraid that the entire celestial wizard realm will be in an uproar soon!”

“In less than half an hour, the success Wizard Association was defeated, the Wizards were killed by the Dragon King, and the monarch fled in fear!”

“The success Wizard Association is not the only one who is shocked. Soon, the whole starry sky might be boiling!”

“The Dragon Palace is going to shake the world!”

The powerhouses of the Celestial Wizard territory murmured as they watched the Dragon King leave.
