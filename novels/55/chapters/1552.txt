Chapter 1553: The evolution of the 1553 Dragon Pearl was a huge harvest

After traveling for more than an hour, Wang Xian had only traveled more than 1,000 kilometers.

In just over an hour, he had harvested more than 200 spiritual fruits and herbs. The Soul of darkness had also devoured more than 40 spiritual fruits and herbs.

Among them, there were also a few soul of darkness at the third level of the Void interpretation realm.

“The higher the level of the spiritual herbs, the higher the level of the Soul of darkness that is guarding them. I can continue to go deeper!”

There were spiritual herbs of the seventh or eighth level of the void interpretation in the black screen garden. Naturally, Wang Xian could not let them go.

He moved his body and flew forward again.

“Spiritual fruits of the fourth level of the Void Interpretation!”

“Two soul of darkness of the third level of the void interpretation are guarding them!”

“Spiritual fruits of the fifth level of the Void Interpretation!”

“Ten Soul of darkness of the third level of the void interpretation are guarding them!”

“Spiritual fruits of the sixth level of the Void Interpretation!”

“Five level four void interpretation spirit fruits are protecting it!”

Wang Xian swept through the spirit fruits along the way. He realized that the level four void interpretation spirit fruits would not be protected by the level four void interpretation spirit fruits.

On the contrary, when he obtained a level six void interpretation spirit fruit, only five level four void interpretation spirit fruits would be protected by the level four void interpretation spirit fruits.

This was both a good and a bad thing for Wang Xian.

Fortunately, it was faster to obtain a high-level spirit fruit. The bad thing was that the speed of the Dark Dragon Pearl’s advancement would be slower.

However, this was something that Wang Xian had no choice but to do. He quickly harvested the spirit fruit.

Perhaps, even the owner of the ruins of the divine kingdom would not have thought that there would be a terrifying existence who possessed the combat strength of level seven of the void interpretation even though he was only at level three of the void interpretation realm.

“Eh? Isn’t this the blackscreen heart fruit? The fruit that Wuqing city is looking for!”

After a day, Wang Xian had already entered an extremely deep region. Looking at the blackscreen heart fruit in front of him, a smile appeared on his face.

The blackscreen heart fruit was at the seventh-level of the Seethrough realm, and there were ten fifth-level Seethrough dark souls guarding it.

He continued to sweep around. A day later, Wang Xian found a eighth-level Seethrough spirit fruit.

“Golden Heart Spiritual Fruit!”

“Two dark souls of the sixth level of the Void Interpretation Stage!”

Wang Xian swept his gaze across the Soul of darkness of the sixth level of the void interpretation stage. Even if all the participants gathered here, they wouldn’t be able to get their hands on this golden heart spiritual fruit!

He smiled and waved his arm. A demonic dragon flew towards the soul of darkness and devoured it.

“There should be half of the energy left. The Dark Dragon Pearl should be able to upgrade to the eighth level of the void interpretation stage. Furthermore, the resources needed for my upgrade should be almost done!”

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered as he looked at the Dark Dragon Pearl and the various spiritual herbs in his interspatial ring.

The upgrade required ten trillion dragon crystals.

Wang Xian had obtained the interspatial ring after destroying the ancient demon city. The resources in the interspatial ring were sufficient to reach about seven trillion dragon crystals.

In addition, he had obtained various spiritual herbs here. The upgrade of his level was just around the corner.

Wang Xian moved his body and continued to search.

There were not many high-grade spiritual fruits and spiritual herbs. After wandering around for four to five days, Wang Xian only managed to obtain ten spiritual herbs of the eighth level of the Seethrough realm.

“Eh? Have we reached the destination?”

At this moment, Wang Xian looked ahead in astonishment. There was an incomparably huge pitch-black stone door standing in front of him.

“Black God Garden!”

Wang Xian muttered as he looked at the huge signboard above the stone door.

That place was obviously another medicinal garden. It might have spiritual herbs of the ninth level of the void interpretation realm, half-step longevity realm, as well as spiritual herbs and spiritual fruits of the longevity realm!

Around the stone door, there were trees standing side by side. The trees were tightly packed together, forming a city wall.

Wang Xian walked forward and wanted to push it away. However, he was directly pushed away.

When he flew to a height of 1,000 meters in the air, he felt a terrifying pressure that made it difficult for him to fly.

“I can’t cross it. With my own strength, I can’t cross it at all!”

After trying for more than ten minutes, Wang Xian finally gave up on the idea of entering the Black God garden and looked towards the back.

“I haven’t gathered that direction yet!”

He moved his body and flew rapidly in another direction. He continued to sweep across.

One day, two days, three days...

The demonic aura on the dark dragon bead became more and more intense. When it was fully unleashed, it could form a terrifying demonic dragon that was a hundred meters long. It could unleash the terrifying strength of a peak level seven Seethrough.

With the power of the Dark Dragon Bead, the current Wang Xian could easily kill ten level seven Seethrough experts by himself.

“Eh? Ling Jian ‘ER is in danger!”

At this moment, Wang Xian suddenly felt a fluctuation coming from the light dragon pearl. He immediately closed his eyes.

Buzz

“Oh no, there are thirty dark souls. There are actually thirty of them. Junior sister Jian ‘ER, run!”

Through the Light Dragon Pearl, Wang Xian saw thirty level three of the Seethrough realm dark souls break through the formation that surrounded Ling Jian ‘er and the rest.

The 30 darkness souls were like ghosts as they attacked them.

“Ah!”

An old man let out a scream. His body slowly turned black as he opened his eyes wide and let out a painful cry.

“Run!”

Around them, the rest of the people from the Bingxin Empire shouted in fear.

Clang

Ling Jian ‘er waved the metal longsword in her hand. It emitted an extremely bright golden glow as it swept towards the darkness souls behind her.

She gritted her teeth with all her might as a look of horror appeared on her face.

Her strength was the weakest among all of them. Now, the rest of them could not care about her at all.

“Roar Roar!”

Sensing the soul of darkness charging towards her from behind, a hint of fear flashed across her eyes.

“He actually provoked 30 soul of Darkness?” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Wang Xian’s gaze swept forward. When he saw that Ling Jian ‘er was in danger, his body moved.

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz

Ling Jian ‘er, who was running for her life, felt the impact of the soul of darkness on her shoulder. Instantly, her body trembled slightly.

However, at this moment, a white figure flashed past her eyes. A special sound came from behind.

This made her slightly stunned. She looked back with a stunned expression.

It had disappeared. All the Soul of darkness had disappeared!

It was as if they did not exist.

“That White Figure?”

The white figure appeared in her mind as her eyes flashed with a luster.

That figure was somewhat familiar!

“What happened? What happened? Why did the dark souls disappear!”

“What happened? Where are the dark souls? Haha, that’s Great, that’s Great!”

“Junior sister Jian ‘er, are you alright?”

In just a few seconds, Bing Jinghuan and the others, who were running for their lives, sensed the disappearance of the darkness energy behind them. They turned around in shock, their faces filled with confusion.

“I’m Fine!”

Ling Jian ‘er shook her head and scanned her surroundings.

“It’s good that you’re alright, it’s good that you’re alright. Why did the Darkness Soul suddenly disappear?”

Bing Jing Huan nodded his head and looked around in bewilderment.

“I don’t know either!”

Ling Jian ‘er shook her head and looked at a statue in her interspatial ring.

The statue in front of her slowly overlapped with the white shadow from before.
