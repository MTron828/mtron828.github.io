Chapter 2946: easily swept through the glazed domain’s tremor 4

“Invincible, the Dragon King and the others are coming over?”

“Have they contacted the Dragon King? Are they alright? Can they rush over?”

In the center of the battle line, seven or eight divine emperors stared at invincible with burning eyes and asked excitedly.

“Yes, boss Wang just sent me a video. I have reported the situation here to boss Wang. He said he would send people over now.”

!!

Invincible battle technique looked at the divine emperors staring at him and immediately said with a smile.

“Did anything happen to the Dragon King and the others?”

The domain Lord teleported to invincible battle technique’s side and asked excitedly.

“Hehe, domain lord, what could have happened? I told you that with the Dragon Palace’s strength, it would be easy to destroy the machine royal territory. When the experts of the Dragon Palace come, wouldn’t it be easy to destroy that evil?”

Invincible battle technique raised his head slightly and said with a smile.

“Good, good. It’s good that the Dragon Palace is fine. It’s good that the Dragon King and the others are fine. If the Dragon King and the others can come here now, there might still be a chance. There might still be a chance!”

The governor said excitedly.

“Buzz!”

As the governor spoke, the communication stone on his body trembled. When he saw the message from the Dragon King, his face was full of excitement. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“The Dragon King said that the people from the Dragon Palace will be here soon!”

When he saw this message, he clenched his fists and immediately told the whole situation.

He also sent the current situation and the situation of the demons and demons of the Chimei region to the governor.

After sending the message, he anxiously waited for the Dragon King’s reply.

“Governor, don’t be anxious. As long as the Dragon King and the other experts of the Dragon Palace are here, it will be no problem to resist the two demon caves!”

The Grand Supreme Elder walked over and said to the domain Lord.

“With the power of the Dragon Palace and our strength, we will be able to hold off the two demon caves. However, we don’t know if we will be able to arrive in time!”

The domain Lord’s expression changed as he said.

“The Dragon Palace has a teleportation array that can directly reach us. If the Dragon King and the others can immediately arrive, it shouldn’t be a problem!”

The Saint Lord also heaved a sigh of relief and said.

“Good, good. I hope we can make it!”

The governor nodded nervously.

This was a matter of life and death for the trillions of people in the glazed domain!

…

“The situation in the glazed domain is very critical. Prime Minister Gui, take six level three devouring dragon God Emperor members and return to the Dragon Palace with Ao Qitian and the others immediately. Then, go to the Saint Domain and meet up with them in the glazed domain!”

“I will bring Ao crab and the other devouring dragons to the glazed area to clean up the evil in the glazed area. Then, I will go to the Chimei region to take a look!”

When Wang Xian saw the message sent by the governor, he immediately ordered Prime Minister Gui and the rest.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Prime Minister Gui and the rest nodded. They looked at AO qitian and the rest of the divine emperors and gestured.

“Let’s Go!”

“Ao he, kill more evil spirits for us!”

“Dragon King, be careful!”

The leaders of the Dragon Palace said, their figures slowly disappearing as they returned to the Dragon Palace.

The Mad Dragon Arrow Dragon and Imperial Dragon followed them back to the Dragon Palace.

In the void, there was only the Immortal King Heaven Array, Ao he and his million men.

After absorbing the machinery from the creator’s secret base, the weakest Devouring Dragon had already reached undying king level 8.

This was definitely a terrifying existence.

An undying king level 8, in the entire starry sky, he was considered strong.

With his might and power, he could easily obtain a few hundred or even more life planets.

They were definitely at the Overlord level.

However, among the millions of devouring dragons, they were indeed the weakest.

One hundred and fifty-five divine emperors with rank one combat strength.

There were more than five thousand peak divine kings.

What kind of concept was that?

The imperial court had hundreds of millions of years of history. There were only fifty to sixty peak divine kings, sixty to seventy.

The Magus Union only had this number!

The strongest peak godly monarch in the glazed domain could exceed 200?

No!

And there were more than 5,000 devouring dragons.

The reason why the devouring dragons could directly increase by 5,000 was related to the mechanical imperial region’s uniqueness.

Unless it was a war, the mechanical imperial region’s robots did not consume much energy.

Secondly, if the robots wanted to possess the destructive power of a peak godly monarch, the resources they needed to consume were very terrifying.

That was because they couldn’t cultivate like human beings!

The resources of one peak king God realm automaton could increase six or seven devouring dragons to peak king God realm.

And those giant battleships that could kill a peak king God realm automaton planet contained even more resources.

The automatons wouldn’t die. They had accumulated more than a billion years to reach their current power.

If it was the imperial star field, if humans did not die, the imperial court would have 5,000 to 6,000 experts at the peak of the godly monarch realm in a billion years.

Furthermore, the imperial star field was larger than the imperial star field. All the places were under the control of the robots.

This was why the devouring dragon had such a terrifying improvement.

“Now that the glazed domain has been occupied by Yaoxie, let’s go and take a look. After killing those Yaoxie, we will go to the chimei domain to see what the situation is like!”

Wang Xian said to Ao crab who was beside him.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Ao crab and the others nodded their heads.

“Ao crab, keep the other devouring dragons in your body. Let’s fly over!”

“It’s the Dragon King!”

“Roar!”

Ao crab transformed into a devouring dragon and let out a low roar.

All the devouring dragons in the surroundings surged into his body.

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian moved his body and leaped to the top of ao Crab’s head. The heaven formation also leaped over directly.

“Roar!”

Ao he let out a loud roar and flew rapidly towards the direction of the glazed area.

With his current speed, he was about the same as Wang Xian.

Just as Wang Xian and the rest were flying towards the glazed area, Prime Minister Gui and the rest had already returned to the Dragon Palace in an instant.

“Dragon of devouring, the six of you. The rest of the celestial thearchs can follow us if they want to. We will head straight to the Holy Region. The situation is a little urgent!”

Prime Minister Gui immediately instructed them.

This time, as long as they had the devouring dragon, they would be able to support the glazed region.

Six third-level celestial thearchs could easily destroy the two demon caves.

Two of the so-called leaders of the demons and monsters would not be able to escape under the Siege of the six devouring dragons!

It did not matter whether the other Dragon Palace Celestial Thearchs went or not.

“Yes!”

The Dragon Palace’s divine emperors nodded. The eight-limbed demon Fiend and a few wind divine dragons joined in the fun, but Ao Qitian and the others didn’t go.

The Ten Dragon Palace’s members were immediately teleported to the center of the sacred zone through the teleportation array.

From the center of the sacred zone to the border, there were dozens of teleportation array transfers.

During this time, it would take four to five hours.

Four to five hours was already very fast!

“They’re here, the experts of the Dragon Palace are here!”

After four hours, the sacred Lord received the news and stood up excitedly, shouting at the domain Lord and the others.
