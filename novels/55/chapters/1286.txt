Chapter 1287: 1288 who will be your underling? Go

Is it the confidence that your pretty boy gives you?

When Wang Xian finished his sentence, young master he, who was standing in front of Wang Xian with his head slightly raised, froze.

Very soon, his expression started to change.

From White to red, from red to black, his eyes were flashing with anger.

In his life, he hated it the most when others called him a pretty boy, even though he did look like a pretty boy.

“I hate it the most when you say this to me. You’re courting death, Bai Ling. Teach him a lesson!”

His aura trembled as he charged at Wang Xian with a powerful aura.

He waved his arm and pointed it at Wang Xian as he commanded the dodo bird.

“Hehe!” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Wang Xian could feel his aura and smiled when he saw him commanding the Dodo bird.

“CHIRP CHIRP!”

The Dodo bird looked at Wang Xian and let out a low growl.

“Shine on his face and make him whiter. Give him some confidence!”

Wang Xian was a little speechless as he ordered the dodo bird.

“CHIRP CHIRP!”

The Dodo bird didn’t hesitate at all. The feathers on its body trembled slightly and a white ray of light covered he shao directly, making him look spotlessly white.

He looked like a saint.

However, when he shaoye saw the dodo’s ray of light enveloping him, his face flushed red rapidly.

At the same time, a hint of shock appeared on his face.

He stared at the dodo and his expression kept changing.

CHIRP CHIRP

The dodo stood in front of Wang Xian and stared at him with its cold eyes.

“How... how is this possible...”

He couldn’t believe it. He had tamed this ferrybird for dozens of minutes.

He had a rare and exquisite heart. On the path of Beast Taming, it was tens or even hundreds of times easier than others.

However, the ferocious beast that he tamed didn’t listen to him.

This made him recall that before he came, this Ferrybird was obviously tamed.

However, even if it was just a simple taming, he could guarantee that the other party’s taming skills were definitely inferior to his.

However, now...

“Haha, Haha, competing with Brother Wang Xian in beast taming skills is really asking for humiliation!”

Long Xiaotian who was at the side saw this scene and revealed a mocking expression. He couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

The subordinates behind Long Xiaotian also felt amused.

This was simply asking for humiliation.

They had witnessed young master Wang’s beast taming technique with their own eyes. It could only be described as heaven-defying.

“This is impossible. I clearly tamed it easily just now. It...”

This was the first time young master he had doubts about his beast taming technique. He growled in a low voice in disbelief.

“Brother Bai, I’m also a Beast Tamer. Don’t think that your beast taming technique is the best in the world!”

Wang Xian said to young master he with a smile on his face.

“My surname is he. Mind your words!”

When young master he heard his sarcastic words, he stared at Wang Xian with a gloomy expression.

He stared at the Dodo bird and found it hard to accept.

He raised his head abruptly and stared at Wang Xian coldly. “As a beast tamer of the younger generation, I am the strongest. I want to challenge you!”

“Challenge?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and revealed a faint smile in his eyes. “How do you want to challenge me?”

“Beast Taming. There are more than ten dodo birds over there. Let’s see who can tame them faster!”

Young master he fixed his gaze on Wang Xian and pointed at the more than ten dodo birds at the side.

“Sure!”

Wang Xian nodded with a smile.

“Alright, let’s begin immediately. I will let you know my beast taming skills!”

With a gloomy face, young master he immediately walked towards the dozen dodo birds.

When Wang Xian saw how serious he was, he suddenly felt that young master he was rather interesting.

His actions were obviously from a powerful family and a canary that was perfectly protected by the family. Although it was a little inappropriate to describe a man in this way, it was indeed the case.

He was much more innocent than the young men who had gone through battles in the graveyard of the demi-humans.

“Get over here!”

Young master he walked over and stared at Wang Xian coldly.

Wang Xian shrugged his shoulders and walked towards young master he. Everyone looked over.

“Let’s Begin!”

Young master he looked at Wang Xian coldly and said with a dark expression.

Wang Xian nodded his head.

Young master he squeezed out a trace of blood and stretched out his hand. He touched the top of the Dodo Bird’s head and closed his eyes slowly.

Wang Xian smiled and walked to the side of a dodo. His aura trembled slightly.

It was easy for Wang Xian to tame a half-step void interpretation level ferocious beast.

In less than five seconds, he squeezed out a drop of blood and placed it into the dodo’s mouth.

He walked towards the next dodo.

However, when they saw Wang Xian walking towards another dodo in just a few seconds, the young and middle-aged men of the Yan clan were shocked.

However, when they saw the Dodo bird submit to them, their eyes sparkled.

“How is this possible...”

“It’s only been a few seconds? How is it possible to tame a half-step void interpretation ferocious beast in just a few seconds? Oh My God!”

The young men of the Yan clan were filled with shock.

Young master he was the favored son of heaven from the He clan, a top force in the vast region. He had a unique physique and exquisite heart. He was also a top-notch favored son of heaven in the vast region.

His beast taming skills were heaven-defying. In the He clan, his status was comparable to those elders.

If it wasn’t for the fact that a beauty from the Yan clan married into the He clan, they wouldn’t have gotten to know such an important figure.

However, he was a top-notch genius in the vast region. How could he be inferior to a young man whom they got to know casually?

This...

“This is?”

The two middle-aged men were also astonished as they looked at the speed of Wang Xian’s beast taming skills.

“In the past, there was a beast taming expert who appeared in a small place like the Liuhai region. I think his name was...”

“Bai Xun, an extremely crazy and arrogant fellow. If he didn’t offend the dynasty, he wouldn’t have been hunted down to the point of almost dying!”

“I heard that he has already died. His beast taming technique is similar to Bai Xun’s. The speed of beginner-level beast taming is extremely fast!”

The two middle-aged men whispered, “This young man might have obtained Bai Xun’s inheritance!”

“It’s possible!”

“Huh?”

Wang Xian, who was taming the Flying Dodos, was slightly surprised when he heard the voices of the two middle-aged men.

He didn’t expect the other party to know that his beast taming technique came from Bai Xun.

“Looks like this Bai Xun Old Man is quite famous!”

He thought to himself, but his hands did not stop moving.

After he tamed more than ten ferrybirds, young master he was still closing his eyes and taming them slowly.

When everyone around saw the serious look on young master he’s face, the corners of their mouths twitched slightly.

Everyone else had tamed them.

You did not even manage to tame one of them.

“Cough, cough. Brother Bai, wake up!”

After Wang Xian finished his training, he couldn’t help but cough when he saw young master he was still there.

“Don’t Disturb Me!”

Young master he was furious when he heard Wang Xian calling him brother Bai.

However, he still didn’t open his eyes so as not to disturb him.
