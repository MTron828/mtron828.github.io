“Kill, Kill, Kill”

In front of the Northern line, millions of warriors rushed out from the planets and flew into the Abyss!

Thousands of planets and billions of warriors rushed into the Abyss!

The bei Chuan sect was very powerful, with over 10,000 undying emperors, the ancient God dynasty dragon Python group was no weaker than the Bei Chuan sect!

As for the great sect last month, their strength was even more terrifying, unfathomable!

Amongst them, there were dozens of smaller powers, they also occupied some planets in the north, the battle now involved all the powers!

“Bei Shuang, be careful!”

Rushing into the Abyss, elder Gong gave bei Shuang a single reminder!

The heavenly daughter had returned once again, she would definitely receive some treatment!

“Don’t worry, Elder Gong!”

Bei Shuang smiled. Her snow-white hands were covered in frost, and her fingernails looked as long as half a meter!

“Bei Shuang, aren’t you good at using swords?”

A woman beside him looked at him and asked!

“I’m better at using my claws now!”

Bei Shuang stared straight ahead and said without blinking!

In front of them, countless abyssal seeds were flying towards them, and they couldn’t see the end of it!

They were also lined up in a row. In front of them, many powerful abyssal seeds were roaring. A terrifying and eerie aura was coming towards them!

“Boom Boom Boom!”

“Bang Bang Bang!”

At this moment, there were already sounds of explosions coming from the surroundings!

One could see terrifying technological artillery shells bombarding towards the front!

The artillery shells instantly traveled hundreds of millions of kilometers and landed in front of the abyssal seeds!

All sorts of technological weapons unleashed their first round of attacks!

“Howl Howl Howl!”

In front, countless abyss seeds roared, their voices shaking the skies!

The warriors below God Emperor gritted their teeth, their faces revealing a savage expression!

Here, there was no chance to escape, one moment of carelessness and one might die!

“Lock onto the undying God Emperor Abyss Seed, Kill!”

“Bei Shuang, attack the Undying Level 4 abyss seed!”

Elder Gong ordered, taking care of bei Shuang!

“Don’t worry elder, I’ll Be Fine!”

Bei Shuang’s gaze was cold, her entire body was slowly covered in frost, behind her, a pair of frost wings appeared!

“Kill!”

When they reached the range of the attack, all the Undying Emperors roared and charged over!

“Howl Howl!”

Bei Shuang flew over, staring at an undying level 5 abyss seed, her short frost hair fluttering!

“Bei Shuang, leave this to me!”

Beside her, a lady said to bei Shuang!

The sect elder ordered that bei Shuang’s future was limitless, if she encountered any danger, she should leave First! Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Now that she was fighting an undying level 5 abyss seed, the lady beside frowned and immediately said!

“Senior sister, there’s no need, I’ll take care of it!”

Bei Shuang’s eyes gleamed coldly!

“Frost Claw, Dragon Tear!”

Her speed didn’t slow down but instead increased, rushing over, her claw instantly grew 10,000 times larger, almost like a dragon claw!

“Pu!”

The Frost Claw landed on the Undying Level 5 seed, instantly covering it!

“Howl Howl!”

The seed’s eyes gleamed fiercely, spewing out a black mist from its mouth, heading towards the Frost Claw!

“Peng Peng!”

However in the next moment, the frost claw pierced through the Black Mist and landed on the abyssal seed’s body!

“Howl Howl!”

The abyssal seed revealed a trace of fear!

The human warriors chose the abyssal seed warriors, the abyssal seed would naturally choose the humans too!

...

From the perspective of this undying level 5 abyssal seed, the frost human in front of it could definitely deal with it!

However, what it didn’t expect was that the Frost Claw instantly landed on its body!

“Ka Ka Ka Ka!”

Its body slowly split open, the level 5 undying fighter instantly killed it!

“What!”

“Bei Shuang seems to have just broken through to level 5 and he can instantly kill A Level 5 undying fighter!”

Around, some of the warriors from the sects that were paying attention to the frost were shocked when they saw this scene!

“Howl Howl!”

At this time, an undying level 6 abyss species saw its own being killed, it let out a howl and attacked!

“Bei Shuang, be careful!”

The woman beside immediately warned!

...

“Frost Dragon’s sorrow, Frost Explosion!”

Bei Shuang saw the attacking undying level 6 abyss species, there was no fear in her eyes!

Her frost claws clawed out, before reaching the level 6 abyss species, it exploded!

Countless ice flowers, like resplendent frost dragons, landed on the level 6 undying god King level seed!

“Peng Peng Peng!”

The sound of the explosion resounded!

“Howl!”

The next moment, there was a scream, Level 6 undying god King level seed, instant!

“What!”

“How is this possible!”

“Bei Shuang is so strong, level 6 undying god King level seed instant!”

Everyone’s faces were filled with shock and disbelief!

He had just reached undying level 5 and instantly killed a level 6 abyss seed, what kind of power was this!

“This is the battle technique of the Frost Dragon that Master taught me? So Strong!”

Bei Shuang’s heart was slightly shaken!

After bei Shuang became Wang Xian’s master, he had taught him the training technique of the Frost Dragon!

Even though she didn’t have the body of a dragon God, she had the origin frost body!

The Frost body, along with the battle techniques of the Frost Dragon God, could allow bei Shuang to fight a level 2 higher!

One had to know that the Frost Dragon God was a powerful existence that could fight a level 4 higher!

It wasn’t surprising that she could instantly kill an undying level 6 abyss seed!

“Is this my current strength?”

She muttered, the ice wings behind her flapped!

Hua Hua Hua Hua

In an instant, countless ice arrows shot forward!

“Frost Dragon Radiance!”

She shouted softly, every ice arrow was like a miniature frost dragon, piercing through the Undying Level 7 abyss seeds!

“AH ao ao!”

“Pu Pu Pu!”

In an instant, over a hundred undying level 7 abyss seeds were killed!

“Hiss, so strong!”

At this time, Elder Gong who was fighting against an undying level 7 abyss seed looked over, his face filled with shock!

This terrifying attack was no weaker than his!

He was an elder of the Bei Chuan Sect, one of the 30 strongest people below the sect leader!

However, bei Shuang’s strength was no weaker than his!

What was the meaning of this?

Bei Shuang, who was less than 40,000 years old, had the strength of an undying god King Level 7, with the potential of an emperor!

In the future, she could lead the bei Chuan sect and become the Bei Chuan sect!

“Elder Gong, the two of us will work together to kill it!”

There was only one undying god King Level 7 abyss seed in their position, bei Shuang swept her gaze over and charged over!

“Alright, Xiao Shuang, let’s Kill!”

Elder Gong was so excited that his face flushed red, shouting excitedly!

“That’s bei Shuang, her strength...”

“Si, that’s senior bei Shuang? The one who once suppressed the entire sect and even the Emperor Court? She’s Back!”

“One move to destroy over a hundred undying level 7 abyss seeds, this is the frost goddess!”
