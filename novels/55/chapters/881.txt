Chapter 882: 0883 had been repressed for a long time

Translator: 549690339

A cold voice rang out, causing the faces of Ao Xue and the rest to darken.

“How Dare You Bully Miss Ao Xue? I think all of you are simply courting death!”

“Scram! Who Did you tell to Scram? Kid, if you provoke miss ao Xue, Young Master bei Ming and the rest, you won’t even know how you died!”

“Where did you come from, you brat? Watch your words, or you won’t be able to live for long!”

However, just as Wang Xian finished his sentence, mocking and cold voices came from the surroundings.

One by one, young men stood out and stared coldly at Wang Xian and the rest.

“Miss ao Xue, do you need our help later?”

One by one, the young men had a look of flattery in their eyes as they asked ao Xue and the rest.

Ao Xue and the rest were among the strongest in the entire square. If they were to take care of them, their chances of completing the assessment would be much higher.

In the Demon Hunter Academy’s assessment, it was normal for examinees to form teams. As demon hunters, it was normal for them to have a team.

As long as they could complete the assessment, regardless of methods or methods.

“If it’s convenient, I’ll lend a hand!”

Ao Xue looked at the fawning expressions of the young men and raised his head slightly.

“Yes, yes!”

The young men quickly nodded their heads.

“What’s going on? Did they provoke ao Xue, Qingfeng, and Bei Ming?”

“Hehe, there will be deaths during the assessment. This group of people is going to be unlucky!”

“Ao Xue and the others are all experts from the mercenary group. I heard that they have gone on a few missions with the mercenary group. Their methods are very strong!”

“They are really courting death. This is good too. They have fewer competitors!”

“Look, the badges on their chests are actually the bronze one-star mercenary group!”

“A bronze one-star cannon fodder mercenary group dares to provoke Ao Xue and the rest? Are they courting death?”

The people around were slightly stunned. However, when they saw the bronze one-star mercenary group badges on Wang Xian and the rest’s chests, they revealed a mocking expression.

A newbie dared to provoke a group of Heaven’s favorites. Furthermore, each of them had an extremely powerful background. Wasn’t this courting death?

It was no wonder that a few people would directly flatter them just now. Using a few newbies to curry favor with Ao Xue and the rest was the most suitable choice!

When Wang Xian and the group of DRAKONIDS heard the voices around them, their expressions gradually turned cold. He swept his gaze across the people around him and a hint of killing intent flashed across his eyes.

In the square, the rest of the few thousand people looked over mockingly. They were filled with schadenfreude.

“CHIRP CHIRP!”

At this moment, the sound of a bird chirping resounded across the entire sky of the square.

“The teachers from the Demon Hunters Academy are Here!”

Everyone in the square had a slight change in expression. They hurriedly whispered and the young men stood up straight.

“Let’s go. Let’s go to the front.”

Qing feng raised his head and walked forward with a knife in his arms.

“Okay!”

Ao Xue nodded her head. As she passed by Wang Xian and the rest, she looked at them with a smile and said mischievously, “Do you regret it? However, it’s useless to regret it now. Hehe!”

After she said that, she walked forward with a smile.

Wang Xian’s face was solemn. His eyes were flickering and he didn’t say a word.

“Crash!”

At this moment, the sound of flapping wings could be heard from the sky.

Wang Xian took a glance at their backs and looked towards the sky.

There were five middle-aged men. Every middle-aged man was exuding a powerful aura.

This terrifying aura was directed downwards without any concealment.

“How terrifying. He’s at least at transcendent-level five!”

“Hiss, rank 5 transcendents are considered experts in Saint Sea Town!”

All of the youths had solemn expressions on their faces.

Although the lifespan of a transcendent expert reached 500 years, it was extremely difficult to increase their strength. They needed large amounts of resources to comprehend divine abilities.

Sometimes, a single rank could trap a martial artist for decades, or even hundreds of years.

Not to mention, the probability of dying in this world was too high.

Even transcendents didn’t dare to guarantee that they could live for two or three hundred years.

“There are quite a number of people. There are more than ten thousand people!”

“If there are too many people, there will be even more deaths. If we eliminate half of them, at least a few thousand people will die!”

Five middle-aged men stood on top of a ten-meter-long black bird, and two of them muttered to themselves.

Their voices echoed throughout the entire square.

The words of the two middle-aged men caused the expressions of all the youths to change slightly. However, all of them gritted their teeth and their faces were filled with fighting spirit.

At this moment, they could not show any signs of cowardice. That was equivalent to being directly eliminated!

The Demon Hunters Academy did not look at talent or age. They only looked at whether one could complete the assessment and Hunt Demon Beasts!

This was the only standard of the Demon Hunters Academy.

“Hehe, they are all quite brave!”

A middle-aged man laughed.

“This year’s assessment mission will be carried out on the Murloc Island. Each person will be given five pieces of jade glue to complete the mission. If so many people go, they will be sent to death. Get lost!”

The middle-aged man standing on the left said. He touched his chin and shouted the last sentence.

“Murloc Island, obtain five pieces of jade glue!”

“This... is actually going to Murloc Island to obtain jade glue!”

“Hiss!”

The faces of everyone in the square changed slightly, and some of the young men even turned pale.

“We have to set off in five minutes. At that time, you will enter Murloc Island directly. We will not be responsible for any casualties. Those who want to leave now, hurry up and don’t waste your lives!”

The middle-aged man swept his gaze across the crowd below and waved his hand impatiently.

“I... I’ll leave!”

“I’ll leave too!”

“Murloc Island, the big-mouthed piranhas above are at least transcendent-level 1. There are even level 4 and Level 5 big-mouthed piranhas at the center!”

The young men’s faces were pale as they lowered their heads and walked out.

For a moment, there was a continuous stream of people walking out. This mission was difficult to complete for transcendent-level 1 and Level 2 transcendents. They had to be careful as well. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Most of the people in the field were at transcendent level 1. They could only awkwardly walk out and withdraw.

Five minutes later, there were only about a thousand people in the square.

“That’s more like it. Everyone receive your assessment tokens. The duration of the mission is two days. As long as you complete the assessment mission, you can immediately withdraw. If you exceed the limit, you will be added to the credits in the future. Credits are very useful!”! “There’s one last point. If you die, you die!”

A middle-aged man said with a smile, “Follow us to the beach. The ship is ready!”

“Yes!”

The people below nodded and flew in the air. Clearly, the demon hunters academy had the privilege of flying in the town.

“Let’s Go!”

The few middle-aged men didn’t waste any time and flew straight into the sky.

“Hehe, I didn’t expect you guys to dare to stay here!”

Just as Wang Xian and the rest were flying into the sky, a mocking voice was heard.

Wang Xian turned his head and grinned. “I’ve been repressed here for a long time!”
