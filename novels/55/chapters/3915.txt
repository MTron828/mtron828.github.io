Chapter 3916: Three thousand nine hundred and fifteen, two peak rulers had fallen. Blood flowed like a river! Go

Translator: 549690339

“This… The great guardian of the Angel clan and Prince Fire Phoenix are going to escape!”

“Hiss, this looks like a battle of two completely different levels. There’s such a huge gap even in a one versus two battle. The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace is already much stronger than a peak ruler! ”

“Two peak-level rulers are trying to escape. They are trying to escape!” All the disciples could clearly see what was happening in front of them.

They saw the great protector of the Angel clan fly into the distance and the Prince of the Phoenix clan take out a treasure to escape.

All of them were surprised.

Although they could see how easily the Dragon King suppressed them.

But to see two masters at the peak of existence by the Dragon King forced to flee, the heart is still shocked!

In particular, the Phoenix clan and the Angel clan’s strong disciples, their faces full of Panic!

Once their two races of strong adults escape, then they are completely finished!

“Escape? Can We escape?”

Wang Xian sneered when he saw that they wanted to escape.

Guardian eles held the scepter in his hand. His entire body was wrapped up as if he had turned into a beam of light.

He flew into the distance at a terrifying speed.

However, this starry sky and this universe belonged to the space of the star field.

With a thought, the eight stars in front of Great Protector Ayres moved and

attacked him!

“Not good, he can’t control all the stars in this space at will, right?”

Great Protector Ayres saw that the eight stars were attacking him, and a hint of fear appeared on his face.

“I’m going to use my escape treasure!”

His eyes revealed a reluctant expression. He moved his palm and pointed forward.

“Heaven’s Gate, open!”

He growled and another gate appeared in front of him.

Heaven’s Gate.

This was a treasure exclusive to the angel race. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Opening the Heaven’s Gate could allow one to instantly escape back to the Angel Race’s sacred mountain.

However, because they were currently in the starry universe, they could not directly escape back to the sacred mountain. However, they could use the heaven’s Gate to directly escape from a very long distance!

“Nirvana Gate, open! ”

Behind them, Feng Yuntian’s low roar sounded.

The Nirvana Gate was a fleeing treasure of the Phoenix race. It was forged with the Phoenix Race’s Nirvana Energy and the Divine Parasol Tree.

Regardless of whether it was the gate of Heaven or the Nirvana Gate, they were both powerful life-saving methods.

It was a powerful life-saving method unique to the peak races!

“The gate of Nirvana, the Gate of Heaven, the most powerful life-saving method of the Phoenix clan and the Angel clan. They can immediately run away from a long distance. It is said that even in a powerful array formation, they can escape in an instant! ”

“The two peak rulers are no match for the Dragon King. They are retreating. They want to escape! ”

On the starry city, the experts of the peak races saw the appearance of the Gate of Nirvana and the Gate of Heaven and said.

These two treasures were only possessed by the top-notch existences among the two peak races.

Even experts who were at the seventh level could not obtain the gates of Nirvana and heaven!

Wang Xian watched quietly as the two gates appeared.

He really did not believe that this fellow from the Angel Race and Phoenix race could escape from the blockade of the Starfield!

Not to mention, there was also the blockade of the Starfield!

He didn’t stop them. He just watched indifferently.

Feng Yuntian and Ayres opened the door to escape respectively. Their gazes swept across Wang Xian.

When they saw Wang Xian watching all of this calmly, a bad premonition suddenly rose in their hearts!

They didn’t release any vicious words. Gritting their teeth, they immediately drilled into the door.

This was especially so for Great Protector Ayres. The eight stars in front of him were already attacking him. If they didn’t escape, they might die!

However, when they stepped into the gates of Nirvana and heaven, they did not enter the gates!

Their figures were still there. The gates had failed!

“Not good!”

“Damn it, how could this be? How could the gates of heaven be useless! ” Great Protector Ayres was terrified at this moment. He roared in disbelief.

His forehead was filled with cold sweat. He hurriedly fled into the distance.

“Boom Boom Boom! ” “Boom Boom Boom! ”

“No no no!”

However, the attack of the eight stars had already arrived.

In an instant, it landed on his body.

In the first two times, he and Feng Yin Tian Fire Phoenix had used their full strength to defend. Only by taking out their trump cards could they withstand the attack of the eight stars with great difficulty.

Now, he was facing the attacks of the eight stars alone. He had already used up all his trump cards.

He could not block them at all!

The terrifying power of the attacks and the terrifying energy landed on his body!

The sounds of fear and despair rang out!

The power of the eight stars collided together. Great Protector Ayres, who was in the middle, was directly hit!

“Flower of the other shore of light, return to life and Death! ”

But at this moment, Ayres ‘furious voice sounded in the center of the eight stars.

“Whoosh! ”

Ayres’figure appeared and quickly flew in the direction of the Star City!

At this moment, a flower appeared above his scepter.

A flower of light, flower of the other shore of light.

Life and death!

He was already dead just now. However, through the flower of the other shore of light, he was instantly resurrected!

However, the flower of the other shore of light now looked much dimmer!

“Let me see how many times you can resurrect! ”

Wang Xian waved his arm and the eight stars attacked Ayres at a terrifying speed once again!

One of the stars emitted an extremely thick energy. When the energy swept past Ayres, his speed was reduced by two to three times!

This caused his pupils to constrict as he looked at Wang Xian with hatred.

“I, Ayres, will remember today’s grudge! ”

He let out a mournful roar.

One after another, the stars crashed into his body. This time, his life force was completely extinguished!

At the side, Prince Feng Yin Tian, the Phoenix, and the Nirvana Gate in front of him had slowly disappeared.

His expression changed as he watched this scene. He gently flapped his broken Phoenix Wings !

He knew that his fate would be the same as Ayres!

“Dragon King of the Dragon Palace, are you really going to kill so many powerful disciples of our Phoenix clan today? “You have to think carefully.

Once you kill the disciples of our Phoenix clan here, our Phoenix clan and Your

Dragon Palace will fight to the death. ”

Prince Phoenix Yin Tianhuo stared at Wang Xian with a grim expression. He growled in a low voice with a face full of unwillingness!

“Hehe, what a joke. We have always fought to the death. If you have the chance to destroy my Dragon Palace, if we have the chance in the future, we will also destroy your Phoenix clan. Not a single one of you will be spared. ” Wang Xian sneered when he heard his words.

With a wave of his arm, eight stars headed straight for Feng Yuntian!
