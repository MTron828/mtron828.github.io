Translator: 5496903

Prime Minister Gui, Ao Qitian, ao Nu, Ao Shi, ao Yecha, Ao Qi, and Ba Qi.

The seven high-level officials of the Dragon Palace, together with Ao Jian and Ao Yao, were the current pillars of the Dragon Palace.

Prime Minister Gui was in charge of the overall situation, AO Qitian was in charge of the Devil War Department, ao Nu was in charge of the environment in the Dragon Palace, and Ao Shi was in charge of the Internal Affairs Department.

Ao Yecha was in charge of the Dragon Defense Department, patrolling the four seas.

Ao Qi was in charge of the Thunder Department, while Ba Qi was a technician who was in charge of developing poisons.

Ao Jian was in charge of the Golden Swordfish clan and belonged to the guards of the Dragon Palace.

Ao Yao was in charge of the Dragon Spur Department and was in charge of assassinations.

Wang Xian looked at his subordinates in front of the Dragon King’s Hall with a satisfied expression on his face.

Although other than Ao Jian and Ao Yao, the rest of them were very weak, their potential was limitless.

Among them, all of them were at transcendent level four. Ao shrimpy and ao nu were slightly weaker.

“I have something important to announce upon my return!”

Wang Xian looked at them and said directly.

Prime Minister Gui and the rest bowed and waited for Wang Xian’s words.

“In seven days, I will move the Dragon Palace to the transcendence continent. At that time, we will develop in the dangerous transcendence continent!”

Wang Xian glanced at all of them and said, “Before we develop, I will improve your strength first. Prime Minister Gui, gather all the members of the Dragon Palace!”

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Prime Minister Gui nodded respectfully.

“Where are the Dragon Queens?”

Wang Xian looked at ao nu and asked her.

“The dragon queens are cultivating in the bedroom!”

Ao nu replied respectfully.

“Okay, I’ll go over First!”

Wang Xian nodded. His body moved and he went straight to the Dragon King’s bedroom.

Looking at the six girls who were sitting cross-legged on the big bed and cultivating, Wang Xian smiled.

“My Babies, I’m Back!”

Wang Xian chuckled and his voice echoed in their minds.

The group of girls were awakened by him. When they opened their eyes and saw Wang Xian, they were pleasantly surprised.

“Haha!”

Wang Xian pounced on him shamelessly. After leaving for such a long time, he really missed him to death.

“You only know how to do this when you just arrived!”

“You Annoying Fellow!”

“Ah!”

The tens of thousands of words that could not be described were omitted. After six hours, Wang Xian walked out in high spirits.

Following him were six beautiful women who were beaming with happiness.

“I’m going to raise the strength of the Dragon Palace. All of you, follow me!”

Wang Xian looked at the members of the Dragon Palace who had been waiting for a few hours. He smiled and flew over.

“Alright, Little Xian!”

The group of girls followed behind him happily.

“Dragon King, Dragon Queen, all the members of the Dragon Palace are here!”

Prime Minister Gui said respectfully when he saw them coming.

Wang Xian nodded and looked over.

The Dragon Palace currently had a total of 3,560 members, including about 900 members from the Demon War Department.

The Dragon Palace had the largest number of members. The rest of the hag clan, the thunder shrimp clan, and the Golden Swordfish clan only had 300 to 400 members.

The Strange Demon clan had the smallest number of members, only 156.

However, the strange demon clan was also the strongest. When Wang Xian came to the Dragon Palace for the second time, he had increased the strength of a group of strange demons.

Now, there were 20 strange demons who had reached transcendent-level rank-3.

The strength of the nine flood dragons had also reached transcendent-level rank-3.

Out of the 3,500 members, only half of them had reached the transcendent-level. There were also many who were at the level of upper-level immortals on earth and were half-step into the transcendent-level.

Other than the few subordinates that Wang Xian had subdued back then, the rest of them were the dolphins.

The Dolphins and Tang Yinxuan cultivated a special type of sound wave. When Tang Yinxuan had broken through to the transcendence stage, she had comprehended a supernatural ability.

It was a water attribute supernatural ability. It used a special wave to boost the morale of the troops. The clarity of mind, energy recovery, and injury recovery of the creatures covered by the supernatural ability would be doubled.

This was a very abnormal divine ability, but it was only effective on creatures of the same or lower level.

For those creatures that were stronger than her, the divine ability had no effect on them.

The other members of the Dragon Palace had different types. There were sea snakes, sea turtles, all kinds of sea fish, and all kinds of sea beasts.

This group of chaotic creatures took up half of the total number.

“Ao Jian, have all the corpses been placed beside the Dragon Pool?”

Wang Xian asked Ao Jian.

“Dragon King, one-third of the corpses have been placed there. There are too many corpses in the storage bag!”

Ao Jian said.

“Alright, everyone head to the Dragon Pool!”

Wang Xian walked in front and headed towards the Dragon Pool. Inside the Dragon Pool, there were nine divine dragons spiraling on the dragon pillars. Their huge dragon heads were spitting out streams of bright red blood.

At this moment, the dragon pool that could accommodate thousands of people had already reached 80% of dragon blood.

This was the first time that so much dragon blood was stored in the Dragon Pool.

However, this amount of dragon blood was not even used on one-third of the corpses.

“So Much Dragon Blood!”

It was the first time that Guan Shuqing, Lan Qingyue, and the other six girls had seen so much dragon blood. They were very clear about the value of dragon blood.

“Hehe, it’s time to upgrade the strength of the Dragon Palace. After this upgrade, the Dragon Palace will be transferred to the transcendence continent. At that time, all of you will be with me!”

Wang Xian smiled.

“Wow, that’s great. In that case, we can be together every day!”

The six girls were filled with joy.

“Prime Minister Gui, Ao Qitian, the seven of you will enter first. After upgrading your strength to level six of the transcendence, come out immediately!”

Wang Xian said to them.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

The leaders of the Dragon Palace entered the dragon pool directly and began to raise their strength rapidly.

“Members of the strange demon clan, enter the Dragon Pool and raise your strength to transcendent-level six. In addition, choose to advance your dragon species as the light spike!”

“Nine dragons, enter the Dragon Pool and raise your level to transcendent-level six!”

Wang Xian looked at the twelve dragons of the bizarre demon clan and gave his order. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The bizarre demon clan’s development in the transcendent continent was of utmost importance. Therefore, the bizarre demon clan had to be strong!

The twelve dragons were the future divine wind dragons. Naturally, they couldn’t fall behind!

“Thank you, Dragon King!”

The group of bizarre demons and the twelve dragons immediately jumped into the dragon pool.

“Dolphins, enter the Dragon Pool and level up your cultivation to transcendent-level five!”

Wang Xian looked at the over 200 dolphins and ordered.

“Thank you, Dragon King!”

Over 200 dolphins, each two to three meters in size. Their eyes were filled with wisdom as they entered the dragon pool directly.

Wang Xian watched them enter the dragon pool and didn’t say anything else.

To Wang Xian, the Dolphins were an important race in the Dragon Palace. Their demonic sound was their strongest technique.

They were extremely useful in large-scale battles.

The strength of the Dolphins could not be too low.

“Xiao Xian, I have something to tell you!”

At this moment, Lan Qingyue, who was standing at the side, looked at Wang Xian and said suddenly.

“HMM? What is it?”

Wang Xian looked at her in astonishment.

“After entering the extraordinary continent, I want to bring Xiao Lan out to explore!”
