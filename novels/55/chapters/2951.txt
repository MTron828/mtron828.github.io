Chapter 2952: King 2 of the starry sky

“With the Dragon King as your king, you will bow down to us?”

Prime Minister Gui could not help but smile when he heard their words.

As the largest region, the glazed domain had a lot of resources. If the glazed domain surrendered, it would be very beneficial to the dragon palace.

“I will report this to the Dragon King. I don’t think the Dragon King will refuse!”

!!

Prime Minister Gui replied with a smile.

“Alright, Alright. We shall wait for news from the Dragon Palace then!”

The governor also nodded with a smile on his face.

“Let your people stay in the void for the time being. It Won’t be long before all the evildoers in the glazed area will be hunted down!”

Prime Minister Gui said to them.

“Thank you for your help, everyone from the Dragon Palace!”

Upon hearing this, the governor and the godly monarchs quickly thanked him respectfully once again.

Prime Minister Gui waved his hand and sent the situation to Wang Xian immediately.

In the void of the machine royal territory, ao crab was flying rapidly with Wang Xian and the heaven array on his back.

When he saw the message sent by Prime Minister Gui, a smile appeared on his face.

“If the glazed area is subservient, doesn’t that mean the dragon palace is the king of the entire starry sky?”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows slightly.

“Sky Array, how long until we reach the Veluriyam Domain?”

He sent a message to Prime Minister Gui and asked the sky array.

“Dragon King, it will take about two hours. We will be able to reach the VELURIYAM domain.”

The sky array looked at the starry sky map and said.

“Alright, let’s go and see what’s going on in the VELURIYAM domain and what’s happening in the chimei domain.”

Wang Xian nodded. He stood at Ao Crab’s head and looked at the surrounding void.

Ao crab was very fast. Two hours later, they flew out of the mechanic royal territory and arrived at the glazed area.

Wang Xian scanned the void and did not find anything unusual.

“Let’s go to the center of the glazed area and take a look!”

Wang Xian instructed ao crab and immediately rushed to the center of the glazed area. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Eh?”

After flying for more than ten hours, Wang Xian noticed that there was an additional trace of violent aura in the surrounding void.

He narrowed his eyes slightly and scanned his surroundings.

“Dragon King, it should be that evil demon who came here. Let me check it out!”

The Heaven Formation immediately set up a formation and began to retrace the situation here.

Soon, an image appeared in front of them.

The image was exactly the same as the surrounding void. Numerous demonic beasts were rampaging through this space.

The Sky Formation stared at it and moved, flying to the side.

Soon, he found a feather in the void. This was the feather that the demonic beasts had dropped in this void.

He used this feather to set up formation after formation.

“Dragon King, I found a demon den. It should be one of the demon dens among the four leaders of the demons and monsters.”

The sky array pointed at the scene in front of them and said.

“Oh? Let’s go and take a look. Prime Minister Gui and the devouring dragon have just destroyed two demon lairs. There are about twenty evil God monarchs in each demon lair and about ten billion others.”

“The overall strength of a demon lair is weaker than that of the glazed domain. To Our Dragon Palace, it is a considerable resource!”

Wang Xian said to the heaven formation.

“It’s the Dragon King. Ao crab, head in this direction!”

The Heaven Formation nodded and passed the information to ao crab.

“Roar!”

Ao crab’s body moved and immediately flew toward the location detected by the Heaven Formation.

“Dragon King, it’s right ahead. There’s more than one!”

“Yes, I see it!”

After a day of flying, two incomparably huge demon lairs appeared in his sight.

Wang Xian stared at the two demon caves with his eyes gleaming.

Beside the two demon caves was an enormous void continent. There were all kinds of plants and trees on the continent.

At this moment, the Void continent was in a mess. On it, countless demonic beasts were wreaking havoc, looking for something edible.

“This continent is too huge. It’s not convenient to take the glazed domain away. It has suffered the ravages of demonic beasts!”

Wang Xian looked ahead and said calmly.

“Dragon King, there are more than two million evil spirits above the god King level. There are forty-nine celestial thearchs and two third-level celestial thearchs!”

Heaven’s formation looked at the red dot on the array compass with excitement in his eyes.

This amount of resources was extremely huge.

“Four demon caves. These are the remaining two. Let’s Go and destroy them!”

A smile appeared on Wang Xian’s face. The incorporeal holy wings appeared behind him and he flew straight ahead.

The Heaven Formation also jumped down from Ao crab’s body. With a wave of his hands, he began to set up the formation.

“Roar! Dragon King, leave it to me alone!”

As Ao crab spoke, he swayed his gigantic body and charged straight ahead.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

Around the two demon caves, some demons noticed them flying over and immediately let out a roar.

“Roar!”

But in the next moment, a roar that shook the sky and made all the Demons’hearts palpitate rang out.

In the two demon caves ahead, all the demons’bodies trembled.

In the deepest part of the demon caves, the bodies of the two demon leaders lying inside also trembled slightly. A sense of horror instantly enveloped their entire bodies.

The pupils of the demonic leaders narrowed slightly, and they revealed anxious expressions.

“Roar!”

At this moment, the roar that contained endless pressure was heard again.

The bodies of the two leaders trembled, and they hurriedly flew out.

“Boom!”

At this time, ao crab, who carried endless pressure, had already charged into the demonic army.

From his body, countless bugs that were the size of humans flew out. The bugs that were formed from the laws of Earth and darkness seemed to have a life of their own as they covered the sky and covered the earth.

They covered an area of 500 million kilometers.

Within this area, all the demonic creatures were instantly dealt a fatal blow.

Regardless of whether it was the divine king level or the divine emperor level, they were all swiftly wiped out.

It was an extremely terrifying attack method.

It was a powerful level suppression.

Ao crab, who had the combat strength of a divine emperor level four, was almost invincible in this void.

“What a powerful strength!”

Tian Chen looked over and was slightly speechless.

“With Ao crab, there’s no need for us to make a move!”

Wang Xian smiled faintly.

Not only did he not need to do anything, he didn’t even need to do anything to the millions of devouring dragons in the Ao crab’s body. He could easily destroy the two demon caverns by himself.

“Roar Roar Roar!”

“CHIRP CHIRP CHIRP!”

At the exit of the two demon caverns, two rapid roars were heard.

In the two demon caverns, two pairs of blood-red eyes were staring outside. When they saw their subordinates being slaughtered crazily, the bodies of the two demon leaders trembled.

They looked at ao crab as if they were looking at a demon that was even more terrifying and powerful than them.

“Roar!”

Ao crab sensed the appearance of the two demon leaders, and a beam of dark yellow energy shot out from his pair of ferocious dragon horns.

The energy quickly turned into a giant horned insect race and attacked the two demon leaders.

“Roar!”

The next moment, a scream of terror rang out.

Easily crushed!
