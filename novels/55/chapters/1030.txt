In the cell, a group of city guards stared at the old man in the interrogation room with an embarrassed expression.

“A spy’s mouth is so tight. I don’t believe that all spies are so tight. As long as the dragon spike dares to accept the mission, we will be able to catch their spy!”

At this moment, an old man walked out of the cell. He stared at the old man in the cell with an expressionless face and said confidently.

“Sir is right. As long as the dragon spike still dares to accept missions in our eastern sea city, we will be able to catch their spies and obtain their information!”

The city guards immediately said respectfully when they saw the old man walk in.

“Okay, let’s Go!”

The old man waved his hand indifferently.

At the same time, the news that two of the dragon Spike’s spies had been caught by the city guards in the morning spread throughout eastern sea city.

In just two days, the dragon Spike had caused chaos in the entire eastern sea city, causing the entire city to shake.

The two families had been wiped out. Today, because of the fear of the dragon assassin organization, many families had already contacted them and arranged a banquet to settle their old grudges.

This scene in the morning stunned many people in Eastern Sea city.

However, not long after, the city guards attacked the dragon spike.

The two spies were caught, causing a great uproar.

Long Ci’s strength was already beyond doubt.

However, behind the city guards was the city Lord’s Manor, the City Lord, an expert at the insightful void realm.

The city Lord wanted to make his move against Long Ci, causing everyone to be dumbstruck.

“It seems that Long Ci’s actions have angered the city lord. He’s arrogant, arrogant, and ignores the authority of the city Lord’s Manor!”

“It should be because dragon spike assassinated the mayor of Bridgewood town last time. He assassinated an important official of star-moon kingdom. This is going against star-moon kingdom. Now that he’s in East Sea city, the city lord will naturally make a move!”

“Now, Dragon Spike is going to be finished. It’s still very easy for the city Lord to deal with an assassin organization. I’m afraid that it won’t be long before dragon Spike will obediently scram out of east sea city!”

“Long CI has only been in the limelight for two days, and now he’s going to be suppressed by the city Lord’s mansion. It seems that there won’t be any long CI in the future!”

On the streets, in the restaurants, the martial artists were talking loudly.

“I think, long CI might be directly eliminated by the city Lord!”

“It’s hard to say. As the saying goes, there are policies and countermeasures. Long Ci’s strength is not weak after all. Perhaps they can really establish a foothold in East Sea city. However, they might not be as high-profile as they are now!”

In front of a shop, a few young men walked out from the shop and chatted with each other.

The white-clothed young man in the middle retorted to his companion. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Hehe, since the city Lord is prepared to deal with the dragon spike, as long as they dare to stay in eastern sea city, they will be destroyed by us. An assassin organization doesn’t have the qualifications to challenge the dignity of our city Lord’s Mansion!”

Right at this moment, an icy cold voice suddenly sounded from the side.

The white-robed young man was slightly stunned, and a fearful expression appeared on his face. “Yes, yes, Sir Is Right!”

“HMPH!”

Three city guards were patrolling the area as they walked over. The middle-aged man in the middle crossed his arms and snorted coldly. “With the strength of our city Lord’s mansion, the dragon spike no longer dares to accept the mission!”

The young men quickly nodded in response. At the same time, they were shocked.

“Long CI actually doesn’t dare to accept the mission anymore!”

“It seems that they are really afraid of the city Lord’s Mansion!”

The few of them looked at each other and quickly walked into the distance.

“Does an assassin organization really think that they can turn the sky upside down?”

The three patrolling city guards disdainfully glanced at their surroundings.

Suddenly, they felt a white light flash in front of their eyes. Then, they slowly widened their eyes.

“Bang, Bang, Bang!”

The three city guards fell to the ground in an orderly manner. In the sky above them, two red pieces of paper slowly floated towards the ground.

“Ah, someone died!”

A young girl next to them heard the sound and looked over. Her face was pale as she shouted.

In an instant, everyone looked over.

“It’s the city guards! It’s three city guards!”

“Why did they suddenly fall to the ground? What happened? Who Saw It?”

“Look at the red paper beside them. There are two red papers. It’s a dragon spike. Oh My God, it’s a dragon Spike!”

The sound of exclamations rang out in an instant. Everyone looked over with faces full of shock.

When they saw the three city guards lying on the ground, dressed in their city guard uniforms, looking at the two bright red pieces of paper on the ground, everyone’s faces revealed shock.

“Oh my God, is this the dragon Spike’s provocation to the city Lord’s Mansion?”

“This is too much, to actually assassinate city guards in broad daylight. Look at the words on that red piece of paper!”

“They’re openly challenging the city Lord’s manor. What is the dragon Spike trying to do?”

Everyone gathered over with faces full of shock, but they didn’t dare to walk over.

The ones who died were the city guards of the Eastern Sea city. They didn’t dare to move recklessly.

“Move, move, move!”

In less than five minutes, more than ten city guards flew over from the sky.

An old man in the middle had a sullen face. His body was emitting a powerful murderous aura as he landed beside the Three Corpses.

At this moment, there were already four to five thousand people gathered here. Their faces were filled with shock as they watched.

The old man walked to the side of the three city guards’corpses. With a glance, he knew that they had lost their vitality.

He looked at the two bright red pieces of paper on the ground and picked them up with a dark expression.

One of the red pieces of paper was the symbol of the dragon Spike assassination. Congratulations on your death.

A line of words was written on the other red piece of paper.

“The Darkness has arrived. Whoever tries to stop it will be enveloped by it!”

The old man stared at the words on the red piece of paper and muttered. An angry expression appeared on his face.

“What a good darkness has arrived. Whoever tries to stop it will be enveloped by it. What a good dragon Spike!”

The old man clenched his fists tightly and growled in a low voice with an angry expression.

“Put away their corpses!”

The old man said to his subordinates behind him with a gloomy face.

“Yes, Captain!”

The three middle-aged men immediately walked over and picked up their corpses.

“Return to the city Lord’s Mansion!”

The old man shouted in a deep voice and directly flew towards the city Lord’s mansion.

The city guards quickly followed.

“F * CK, the darkness has already arrived. Whoever tries to stop it will be enveloped. This is the dragon spike declaring war on the city Lord’s Mansion!”

“This is too awesome. He directly declared war on an expert at the profound void realm. My God, where did this dragon spike get his confidence from!”

“Awesome, Awesome, Awesome. An assassin organization declared war on the city Lord’s mansion of East Sea city. Is he trying to overturn the heavens?”

As the group of city guards left, the surroundings instantly boiled over.

Assassinating the city guards of East Sea city on the street and even leaving a note to provoke the city Lord’s mansion. This was simply a blatant declaration of war.

“F * CK, look at the Forum. Two city guards in the central region were killed in public. It was also done by dragon Spike!”

Just as a young man took out his communication stone plate and was about to spread the shocking news, he suddenly realized that dragon Spike had also assassinated a city guard in the Central Region!
