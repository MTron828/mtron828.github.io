Chapter 1005: 1006 pupil technique

Translator: 5496903

The bottom of the sea in the Dragon Wind region was not completely dark.

The wind chimes on the wind chime tree were emitting a green light, and the bottom of the sea was also reflected in a green color.

The surrounding area contained dense water energy and wind energy.

In the wind chime forest, floating in the sky above the forest was simply courting death.

In the sky, one could float in the sky within a few thousand meters. The fierce beasts and demon beasts in the wind chime forest were easier to ambush and attack.

After entering the underwater forest, they would be able to move more stealthily.

“Here, if you encounter a jinlin boa or a wind-winged savage fish, you must kill them as fast as possible. Don’t make too much noise!”

“Wind and water elemental cultivators must pay attention. Don’t let the sound of the wind chimes spread out!”

Zhang Fengying looked at the people behind him and warned with a serious face. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Yes!”

The members of the amethyst mercenary group were obviously not unfamiliar with Zhang Fengying. They nodded their heads heavily.

Xia houming and the rest also knew of her name and agreed with her.

Wang Xian looked at this woman with a hot body. To be able to reach transcendent level seven, she must be extraordinary.

“Let’s Go!”

Zhang Fengying waved her hand. Everyone stared at their surroundings vigilantly.

Wang Xian also looked around, and a strange light flashed in his eyes.

“Eh!”

Under his gaze, Wang Xian realized that there was a passage under the sea five hundred meters in front of him. The passage was extremely huge, but there were no living things in it.

Was this the nest of the wind-winged savage fish?

Wang Xian looked around curiously. The passage led to the front, and it extended in all directions. It was like a huge maze.

“No Wonder I can’t get rid of this wind-winged savage fish. Their lair is so complicated. Even if an expert from the void interpretation realm came, he wouldn’t be able to get rid of this wind-winged savage fish!”

Wang Xian looked at the bottom of the sea.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

At this moment, an urgent sound came from the front.

Wang Xian raised his head and looked ahead.

He saw that Zhang Fengying, who was walking at the front, was holding a ferocious beast with a green long whip in her hand.

The ferocious beast was seven to eight meters long, as thick as a bucket, and had two antennae on its head.

It looked like a python, but there was a big difference.

“Bang!”

Zhang Fengying moved her arm and tightened the whip, and the seven-to-eight-meter long embroidered scale BOA was instantly divided into several parts!

“Too ferocious!”

“Miss Fengying is not only powerful in her ocular arts, but also a group of powerful ones!”

“After all, she is the only one in the Zhang family who has activated her green eyes!”

Beside them, the group of youths from the void beast mercenary group whispered when they saw the powerful Zhang Fengying.

“Be careful. I discovered him when I was 1,000 meters away. Now that I am 500 meters away, you still haven’t seen him?”

Zhang Fengying turned her head and looked at the group of people behind her with a displeased expression.

Zhang Yitian felt a little awkward. She was used to this aunt of his.

However, Zeng Lao, who was beside Xia houming, could not help but twitch his lips. He lowered his head slowly and wiped the long saber in his hand, pretending that he did not hear anything.

“Zeng Lao is good at fighting. That Little Fellow, what are you good at?”

Zhang Fengying looked at Wang Xian.

As a qualified commander, he had to understand the attributes and abilities of everyone. She did not need to ask about the others. However, he had to understand Wang Xian, who was also an extraordinary level seven fighter.

“I’m good at it?”

Wang Xian hesitated for a moment before saying, “I’m good at Scouting!”

“You’re good at Scouting?”

Zhang Fengying was slightly stunned when she heard his words. Then, she looked at him with a teasing expression. “Little Fellow, you’re good at Scouting!”

“Yes, Big Sister!”

Wang Xian heard him calling her little fellow again and again. He looked at her and replied.

“Big Sister?”

When the surrounding people heard Wang Xian’s words, they immediately looked over and then looked at Zhang Fengying.

This big sister was really well-addressed!

“You...”

Zhang Fengying glared at Wang Xian. When she saw the anger on his face, she immediately restrained herself. She looked at Wang Xian from head to toe and said, “You’re the only one who’s good at Scouting. Didn’t you notice the Jinlin Boa that was five hundred meters away just now? Is this the scouting that you’re good at?”

“I’m indeed good at it!”

Wang Xian nodded his head faintly.

“Alright, then I’d like to see how good your scouting skills are. Come, let’s walk at the front. Old Zeng, you stay behind us!”

Zhang Fengying raised her eyebrows and said to them.

“Alright, Miss Zhang. I’m not good at this. I’ll leave the Scouting to you guys!”

Old Zeng nodded his head with a smile.

Wang Xian walked over nonchalantly.

“Pa!”

“Kid, let’s have a competition. Next, let’s see who will be the first to discover the ferocious beasts lurking around!”

Zhang Fengying placed her arm on Wang Xian’s shoulder and said plainly.

Wang Xian smiled and looked at Zhang Fengying, who was taller than him by half a head. He took two steps to the left and said, “Alright!”

“Hehe!”

Zhang Fengying smiled when she saw his actions and shouted, “Let’s Go!”

As they continued to walk forward, Zhang Fengying looked at Wang Xian with a smile on her face. Her eyes were flashing with a green glow.

He swept his gaze across the surroundings.

“Green Eyes?”

Wang Xian took a glance at Zhang Fengying and thought to himself, I wonder what abilities this green eyes have.

He continued walking forward. The wind chime tree was dozens of meters tall and the sea was calm. It was similar to the forest on the ground.

After walking for more than a thousand meters, Wang Xian scanned his surroundings with a smile on his face. Suddenly, he pointed upward with his arm.

Without him saying a word, a golden swordfish behind him moved and flew directly toward a wind chime tree in front of him.

Buzz

Metal swords pierced through the tree.

Bang

A seven to eight-meter-large corpse fell to the ground.

It was a caracal of extraordinary level five!

The group of people who were walking were stunned. Even Zhang Fengying looked over in astonishment.

“There’s a caracal on the tree?”

Her expression changed as she looked at Wang Xian. “You discovered it? The strength of your subordinates is not bad!”

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian did not answer her and said plainly.

“Who is it? A little cat meeting a dead rat. How arrogant!”

Zhang Fengying saw that Wang Xian was ignoring her. She pouted and her expression became serious.

A dense green energy gathered in her eyes.

When Wang Xian saw her appearance, he retracted his dragon eyes of fire and light.

Now, he was only at the periphery. He would leave it to Zhang Fengying, his big sister!

This way, he was happy to be free.

“500 meters to the left, there is a caracal boa wrapped around the tree. It’s A Level 5 transcendent. Let’s go and take care of it!”

After walking for another 500 to 600 meters, Zhang Fengying’s lips curled up slightly as she said softly.

A Level 6 transcendent girl from the amethyst flew over immediately and took care of it.

“HMPH!”

“One to one!”

Zhang Fengying raised her head and looked at Wang Xian provocatively.

This made him feel a little amused. He nodded his head lightly.

“Continue!”

She continued to move forward with full of fighting spirit. She looked around vigilantly.
