Translator: 5496903

“Oh my God, he’s submitted! That overwhelming prodigy King Beast actually submitted! This... This year’s overwhelming prodigy bridge supremacies battle actually caused such a scene!”

“An incomparably powerful demonic beast overwhelming prodigy actually submitted under the overwhelming strength of the nameless sword demon. Just how powerful is the Nameless Sword Demon?”

“From the beginning until the end, the nameless sword demon did not even use his dharma idol. Do you guys think that the nameless sword demon has the strength of a third-level profound void martial artist? Otherwise, why would the overwhelming prodigy King Beast be so afraid of him!” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Haha, this is really exciting. After more than a hundred years, another supreme-being of the Heaven’s Pride has appeared in our human race. Furthermore, he has subdued the king Beast of the Demon Beast Race. This is really giving us humans a boost in our morale!”

“The Demon Beast race that was extremely arrogant just a moment ago. Look at the expression on their faces now. The nameless sword demon is invincible!”

“The nameless sword demon is invincible! The nameless sword demon is awesome!”

When everyone saw the Demonic Beast King Beast prostrating next to Wang Xian and submitting to him, a deafening cheer broke out around the arena.

Everyone looked at this scene with shock and excitement.

Subduing the Demonic Beast King Beast and suppressing all the other geniuses of the Demonic Beast Clan.

He was truly the leader of the Human Heaven’s pride experts, the Supreme Heaven’s pride expert!

“Traitor, this traitor has disgraced the face of our demonic beast clan. Damn it!”

Within the Demonic Beast clan, the powerful demonic beasts stared at the demonic soul and Wang Xian with eyes filled with killing intent as they roared furiously.

Wang Xian swept his gaze across the surroundings. Regardless of whether it was the praises of the humans or the roars of the demonic beast clan, he didn’t take them to heart.

He raised his head and looked at the supreme platform of the Heaven’s pride experts. A smile appeared on his face.

Wang Xian’s figure moved and flew directly into the sky.

“Supreme Heaven’s pride expert!”

“A True Supreme Heaven’s pride expert! He can suppress all the young people in the current generation of the Liuhai region and suppress all the heaven’s pride experts of the Demonic Beasts!”

As they watched Wang Xian fly towards the supreme platform of the Heaven’s pride experts, all the young people raised their heads in admiration, respect, and admiration.

The moment Wang Xian stepped onto the supreme genius stage, the golden glow on the stage intensified and waves of powerful energy appeared around him.

A shadow was projected directly into the sky.

The shadow was Wang Xian’s figure. He held the demon-free sword in his hand and wore a mysterious black mask on his face.

Everyone looked at the hundred-meter-sized shadow with respect.

The supreme prodigy, the supreme prodigy.

Ling Jian ‘er raised her head and looked at the figure. Her eyes sparkled.

She thought of the figure she saw for the first time.

The first time, he saved her life.

The second time, when the Hanhai Empire attacked her, the figure appeared!

A faint smile appeared on her face. A special emotion was born in her heart.

However, when she thought of Wang Xian’s cold attitude, she frowned slowly. Her face was filled with unhappiness.

“That is? It’s the powerful energy fluctuation that was released from the room of My Heaven’s Pride Stage!”

At this moment, the eyes of the person standing on the supreme genius stage looked towards the Human Heaven’s pride stage. When he saw the light rising over there, a smile appeared on his face.

His body moved and flew directly towards the Heaven’s pride stage.

When the demon soul saw Wang Xian flying over, he immediately followed behind.

Ling Jian ‘Er and Ren Xingchen hesitated for a moment before flying over as well.

It was not only Wang Xian’s arena that was lit up. The top ten on the human’s Heaven’s pride roll were also lit up.

Since Wang Xian had obtained the title of the Supreme Heaven’s pride expert, the entire human side would also receive rewards.

When Wang Xian arrived at the Heaven’s pride stage and allowed the demon soul to enter, he directly entered the cultivation room.

In an instant, he could feel a majestic energy pouring into his body.

The majestic spiritual energy turned into fog and was almost able to condense into spiritual liquid.

Wang Xian revealed an excited expression. “What a majestic spiritual energy. It can be converted into dragon energy rapidly!”

He opened his mouth excitedly and swallowed the dense spiritual fog directly into his stomach.

The Dragon Qi in his body was increasing at a terrifying speed.

Wang Xian sat in the training room. It took him two whole days to completely absorb the spiritual fog.

On the other hand, his dragon qi directly increased by more than 200 million dragon crystals.

“Such a vast amount of energy. If one’s comprehension ability can keep up, it can definitely allow a powerhouse at the first level of the Seethrough realm to break through to the second level of the Seethrough Realm!”

Wang Xian heaved a sigh of relief. He still needed more than 500 million dragon crystals to level up.

He would return when he broke through to the Seethrough realm.

At the thought of this, Wang Xian stood up and walked out of the cultivation room.

“Dragon King!”

Upon seeing Wang Xian coming out, the demon soul that was lying outside greeted Wang Xian respectfully.

Currently, the Demon Soul was completely under Wang Xian’s control. This control was not the control of the beast taming technique.

Instead, it was the control of a drakonid.

In the future, when the Demon Soul entered the Dragon Pool, it could become a member of the Dragon Palace.

The Demon Soul’s physique was extremely domineering. As a mount, it was extremely handsome.

Furthermore, its own strength was not weak. It was definitely a qualified mount.

Next, I have to think of a way to earn more than 500 million dragon crystals. With another 500 million dragon crystals, everything will be perfect

Wang Xian thought to himself as he landed directly on the demon soul.

“Let’s Go!”

He raised his head slightly and flew towards the demon soul with a smile on his face.

“Master Nameless Sword Demon!”

“Master Nameless Sword Demon!”

Just as Wang Xian flew out of the Heaven’s pride stage, a group of middle-aged young men and old men suddenly appeared around him.

They were holding the invitation cards in their hands.

“Lord Nameless Sword Demon, in the name of the bloodshed empire’s emperor, I am here to offer a recruitment letter to Lord Nameless Sword Demon. His Majesty has asked me to inform you that if you join the bloodshed empire, you will be directly conferred the title of the opposite-sex king of the empire. You will be rewarded with two cities!”

An old man walked over respectfully and handed over an invitation card.

“Lord Nameless Sword Demon, I am a teacher of the Divine Wind Academy. Our Divine Wind Academy wishes to invite Lord Nameless Sword Demon to take up the position of Honorary Vice Dean of the Academy. Please consider it!”

“Lord Nameless Sword Demon...”

One by one, people walked up respectfully and handed over the invitations one by one, coming forward to express their goodwill.

After the battle at The Prodigy Bridge, after nameless sword demon obtained the title of supreme prodigy with overwhelming force, his reputation spread throughout the surrounding dozens of dynasties within a short two days.

The emperor of the powerful blood flow empire also sent people to recruit him.

The title of Supreme Genius, Nameless, represented not only great strength and potential, but also great appeal.

The name of the nameless sword demon now represented great power. If he established a mercenary group, a sect, or even a dynasty, countless people would follow him.

Especially the nameless sword demon who had subdued a heaven’s Pride King Beast. His future potential was limitless!

All the factions were fighting to rope him in.

“Give me the recruitment letter. I will consider it!”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and took the letter one by one. Then, he dashed into the distance.

“Sigh! What a mysterious Heaven’s Pride!”

Seeing Wang Xian take the recruitment letter and leave, the people from all the factions showed admiration in their eyes!
