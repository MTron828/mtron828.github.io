Chapter 388: Center Of Attention (2)

“Young master Jiang! Haha! You are pretty early!”

A young man alighted from a Lamborghini and walked towards the young man in a Porsche a short distance away as he spoke.

“I’m here for a show and it’s only natural for me to arrive early. The men from the Sacred Followers Guild should be coming soon. I might miss it if I’m late!”

Young master Jiang had a head of red hair. He smiled as he observed his surroundings. “There are quite a number of people who came for the show!”

“Haha, of course! We are talking about the most demon-like genius and the number one person on the Outstanding Young Heroes Chart. The fact that he will be punished soon is naturally a draw!” From an SUV that was nearby, a plump man alighted with a smile.

“I’m so jealous of him. At the age of twenty, he’s a Miracle Doctor that ranks ninth, a powerful alchemist and a horrifying Inborn expert! I would be so happy that I would wake up from my dreams if I had any one of his achievements!”

A handsome man who was wearing a suit and tie alighted from his vehicle. He looked towards the villa as he sighed emotionally.

“Jiang Yuan, Gu Da, Lu Kaiping! You guys must be really free to come all the way here!”

“Aren’t you the same too? Otherwise, what would you be doing here?”

“I came here to witness if this Miracle Doctor Wang of Rivertown is as incredible as he is in the rumors!”

Several young men alighted from their vehicles. Some knew one another while others didn’t.

However, all of them were part of the Ancient Martial Arts circle and thus would at least have heard of one another’s names.

“Jiang Yuan, isn’t this Supreme Seas Development Zone a seaside development of your family?” the young man in a suit walked towards the red-hair Jiang Yuan and asked with a bright smile.

“That’s right! It is developed by one of my family businesses!”

Jiang Yuan smiled and nodded. “Miracle Doctor Wang of Rivertown stays here. He is not an ordinary man. No one in Rivertown dares to mess with him!”

“He’s not just capable. Based on the information I have gathered, Miracle Doctor Wang embarrassed the Flame Palace during their pilgrimage. Nonetheless, Flame Palace has since been annihilated!” the young man in a suit said with a bright smile. However, his eyes were filled with jealousy.

Having such terrifying strength and authority at the age of twenty would make anyone envious, including elites from these famous families and sects!

“Flame Palace was just a newly promoted Sacred Sect and paled in comparison to the Sacred Followers Guild. Since Sacred Followers Guild have made such claims, they definitely have the confidence to follow it through!” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Jiang Yuan smiled and continued, “My only question now would be if this Miracle Doctor has escaped?”

“Based on my sources, he is still in the villa. I wonder where he gets his confidence from to wait here for the Sacred Enforcers!”

Tsk! The young man in the suit snorted, “The villa is by the sea. If he wishes to escape by the sea, it won’t be easy to find him!”

“You are right. If he were to escape to the sea, even the experts from Sacred Followers Guild would not be able to do anything. However, if he were to escape today, he would have to lower his head and live in shame in the future!” Jiang Yuan nodded in agreement.

“What do you guys think? Will Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown escape?” a young man walked over and asked loudly.

Another young man smiled and made his conjecture: “This is really hard to say. However, my own personal view is that the chances of him escaping are over seventy percent!”

“Haha! Regardless, I’m going to start a thread on the Underworld website and do a live stream for all to see!”

A young man took out his phone, took some photos of the surroundings and started crafting a thread on the Underworld website.

Title of Thread: [Punishment of the Sacred Enforcers. Will the demon-like genius cower like a turtle or would it put up a resistance against the Sacred Followers? Let me make my conjecture first. The genius Miracle Doctor Wang will definitely be dead!]

A thread that was filled with mockeries and some photos of the surroundings was started by the young man.

At this moment, a young man exclaimed, “The vehicles of the Sacred Followers Guild are here!”

Instantly, silence shrouded the area.

Although they were all rich young masters, they were nothing in front of the Sacred Followers Guild.

Moreover, those that came this time were the Sacred Enforcers and Elders from the Sacred Followers Guild.

A single Elder from the Sacred Followers Guild was already more powerful and influential than their entire family.

Eight Audi cars stopped at the entrance of the Supreme Seas Development Zone and a group of people alighted from these vehicles.

“Those... Those are the Elders of the Sacred Followers Guild and there are five of them! They have sent five Elders!”

The surrounding group of young men were astonished to see these old men alighting from the first two vehicles.

The five old men’s identities were evident from the clothes they wore.

“Look behind them! Those two Enforcers are captains of the Enforcing Teams. Oh gosh! They have sent two captains over!”

“The rest of the group is made up of twenty-odd Half-step to Inborn experts. Oh gosh! The team that’s been deployed this time is so powerful!”

“Seven Inborn experts and twenty-odd Half-step to Inborn experts! Considering the strength of the team that is here, the Sacred Followers Guild appears to be determined to kill Miracle Doctor Wang from Rivertown!”

“As the Elders of the Sacred Followers Guild are well-versed in medical knowledge, their attacks are much stronger than ordinary Inborn experts. They are definitely not the same as the Inborn experts from the Nine Lotus Sect!”

“Seven Inborns. Seems like the Sacred Followers Guild are placing emphasis on this issue. This Miracle Doctor Wang is doomed!”

The surrounding group of young men discussed softly among themselves.

As for the young man who had started a thread on the Underworld website, he enthusiastically took photos of the experts from the Sacred Followers Guild and uploaded them immediately.

[Sacred Followers Guild has deployed five Elders and two captains of the Enforcement Teams. If Miracle Doctor Wang doesn’t escape, he will definitely be killed!”

After editing his captions and attaching the photos, he sent them out immediately.

At this very moment, the appearance of this post attracted the attention of umpteen martial artists in the Underworld. The whole thread was exceptionally active and the audience was waiting anxiously for new updates.

[Damn it! Seven Inborn experts! This is enough to annihilate a few First-class Forces!]

[Sacred Followers Guild has indeed acted quickly! This Miracle Doctor Wang of Rivertown is doomed!]

[This is the consequence for offending a Sacred Sect! Even such a demon-like genius is about to be killed! A genius will be falling today!]

There were new comments made in this thread every second. The Underworld Forum was incomparably lively and countless Martial Arts families and sects were paying attention to it.

“Greetings, Elders from the Sacred Followers Guild. I am Jiang Yuan from the Jiang Family of the Northern City. This property belongs to our Jiang Family. Let me bring you over!”

Jiang Yuan mustered up his courage, walked towards the Elders from the Sacred Followers Guild after seeing them alighting from their vehicles, and spoke deferentially.

The few Elders from Sacred Followers Guild looked at Jiang Yuan and glanced at the group of young men who were here to watch a show. The Elders were nonchalant about their purpose and waved their hands.

“Bring us over!” One of the Elders said plainly.

“Yes, yes. Elders, please follow me! According to my sources, that brazen Miracle Doctor Wang is still in the villa. However, I don’t know if he has escaped by now!”
