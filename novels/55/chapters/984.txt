Chapter 985: 0986 was in a fierce battle

Translator: 549690339

Wang Xian was fighting one-on-one while Ao Yao was fighting six-on-one.

The thunderfish with huge wings were emitting blue lightning. They flapped their wings and looked extremely mystical.

With a body size of ten meters, bolts of lightning were falling around them in the sky. They were extremely powerful.

In Wang Xian’s opinion, the strength of these thunderfish was not very strong among those of the same level.

However, in this place, on a peak of five to six thousand meters and in an area filled with lightning, their strength could increase by at least 50% .

Increasing their combat strength by 50% would allow their strength to reach the peak of extraordinary level eight.

Wang Xian’s eyes revealed a hint of seriousness.

“Roar!”

He opened his huge mouth. Dense flames gathered in his mouth as he attacked the thunderfish in front of him.

Whoosh

However, the thunderfish moved its body slightly and easily dodged his attack.

They were only a few hundred meters away from each other. How could they be dodged in an instant?

“What a fast speed!”

Wang Xian was astonished. He didn’t expect the heavy and huge thunderfish to be so agile.

Lightning was considered to be the best in terms of speed! Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Boom

The flames that Wang Xian spat out landed heavily on the mountain peak and dissipated immediately.

The mountain peak here had been struck by lightning for an unknown number of years. The internal structure of the mountain peak had changed and was extremely tough.

Crash

At this moment, the attack of the thunderfish arrived. Bolts of lightning struck at him.

Wang Xian’s body shook. In an instant, earthen yellow shields appeared in front of him and blocked in front of him.

His body moved and he moved forward. His terrifying dragon claws attacked the thunderfish.

The thunderfish’s physical body could not be compared to his divine dragon body at all.

Even though Wang Xian’s current cultivation was only at level five of the extraordinary realm.

“Roar!”

Seeing Wang Xian’s attack, the thunderfish raised its head. The sky suddenly lit up and terrifying bolts of lightning attacked Wang Xian directly.

“Kacha!”

The lightning descended directly. With a move of Wang Xian’s tail, a water screen instantly appeared above him.

“Roar Roar!”

The thunderfish roared again and another huge bolt of lightning descended.

“Boom!”

Wang Xian’s expression changed slightly as he hurriedly dodged to the side.

However, the moment the first bolt of lightning struck him, his body stiffened and his movements slowed down.

“Hiss!”

Wang Xian swayed his body as a painful look appeared in his eyes.

“Crackle crackle!”

At this moment, Wang Xian suddenly realized that the entire sky had turned violent.

He was slightly stunned as he looked to the side.

He saw that the six thunderfish were emitting dense thunderbolts from their bodies. The Thunderbolts in the sky also condensed together.

“Crash!”

Wang Xian quickly regained his senses and saw that the thunderfish in front of him had used the momentum to release the Thunderbolts at the same time.

The Thunderbolts in the sky became even more violent. The Dark Sky was torn into a long line.

Wang Xian’s expression changed slightly. He raised his head and said, “Water hazard explosion city!”

Water Hazard Explosion City!

In an instant, a sea water that covered an area of 2,000 meters and was more than ten meters thick met the Thunderbolts in the sky.

Boom

However, the water crisis exploding city was unable to withstand the lightning in the sky.

The dense lightning was like the might of the heavens.

Wang Xian’s body shook and his entire body turned yellowish-brown.

Boom! Boom! Boom

The dense lightning landed on his body and tore open numerous wounds.

Fresh blood that was emitting light flowed out, causing Wang Xian’s body to tremble violently.

“F * ck, if we were to fight in this place, even a transcendent level nine would have a high chance of dying at their hands. Unless it’s a lightning attribute powerhouse!”

Wang Xian’s face was slightly distorted.

From the corner of his eye, he saw ao Yao dodging continuously in the air. With his powerful speed, he was still struck by lightning many times. Half of his white body was turning black.

The seven thunderfish were like half of a magician. They were floating in the air and releasing lightning non-stop, attacking their bodies.

“Light-dark Fire Dragon Eyes!”

Wang Xian growled in a low voice. Two streams of flames from his eyes attacked the thunderfish directly.

“The wood world has descended!”

The moment the light-dark Fire Dragon Eyes were released, the wood world had descended.

Streams of trees condensed from the Azure Dragon’s energy covered the thunderfish directly.

The tree branches wrapped around the thunder fish.

The Thunder Fish’s body glowed brightly as countless lightning bolts shot out from its body.

The Thunder fruit landed on the trees, causing them to turn black.

However, the descent of the tree world still restricted the Thunder Fish’s movements.

The Dragon’s eyes of light and dark fire landed on its body, causing its pupils to reveal a panicked expression.

“COO COO, Coo Coo!”

It shouted loudly. At the area covered by the flames, bolts of lightning fell onto it, trying to extinguish it.

“This is the time!”

Wang Xian moved his body and attacked the thunder fish directly.

When the Thunder Fish saw Wang Xian approaching it, it flew rapidly into the sky.

“Get Down!”

Wang Xian swung his huge tail and threw it towards the thunder fish.

Boom

A terrifying force landed on the ten-meter-sized torpedo fish, causing it to crash heavily into the mountain peak.

Crack! Crack! Crack

A rock on the mountain peak cracked open, and the ten-meter-sized rock rolled towards the bottom of the mountain peak.

Wang Xian moved his body and rushed over again.

The two-meter radius around his upper abdomen was burned by the endless wood flames. His body was also subjected to the terrifying flames. The torpedo fish could only hurriedly set up a lightning barrier in front of him!

However, Wang Xian’s thirty-meter-long body crashed heavily into the lightning and was knocked away.

The lightning broke apart like glass.

Wang Xian’s twenty-meter-long body landed heavily on the torpedo fish again.

Boom! Boom! Boom

Some of the rocks on the mountain peak cracked open and rolled down slowly.

Boom

At this moment, the same terrifying sound of collision could be heard from the side.

Wang Xian turned around and saw three thunder beasts crashing into the mountain peak. A smile appeared on his face.

On the Ao Yao’s side, it was obviously not a big problem to deal with six Thunder Beasts.

“Go to hell!”

Wang Xian saw the Thunder Beasts spitting out large mouthfuls of blood. Two pairs of dragon claws charged towards them.

It was a fatal blow!

“COO COO, Coo Coo!”

Seeing Wang Xian’s attack, the Thunder Beast’s abdomen began to bulge.

Boom

A lightning pillar was sent straight for the attack.

“A dying struggle!”

Wang Xian’s eyes revealed a cold expression. His body moved and he quickly dodged to the side.

Whoosh

“Huh? You still want to escape?”

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly and the flames in his mouth shot straight at him.

Coo! Coo

The injured thunder fish did not feel it. Even when the flames landed on its body, it did not resist.

Its body flew swiftly to the lightning while the fish scales on its body flickered with light.

A blue-green lightning bolt landed on its body.

The endless wood flames on its abdomen were slowly extinguished.

“Oh no, it’s going to recover!”

Wang Xian’s expression changed slightly.
