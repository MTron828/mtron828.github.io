Chapter 1177: 1178 target, underground of the human-demon graveyard

Translator: 5496903

Currently, the resources required for Wang Xian to level up were too huge.

If he were to devour the ferocious beasts and demonic beasts in the ocean, he would need more than 200,000 level seven extraordinary ferocious beasts and demonic beasts.

What kind of concept was this?

This was simply impossible. Before he could devour so many level seven extraordinary ferocious beasts, he might encounter an even more terrifying existence that would devour him.

A few days ago, when Wang Xian found out about the human-demon graveyard, he was a little tempted.

However, Wang Xian did not confirm it at that time because the human-demon graveyard was at least ten days away from the dragon-phoenix royal city.

He had to travel through many places along the way and it was very dangerous.

Moreover, once he went out, he would need at least half a year, or even a year, to return.

This caused him to hesitate slightly.

However, when he saw the spiritual liquid, Wang Xian made up his mind.

He had to go out and explore. Furthermore, he had to go out and explore by himself.

His current strength was close to the first level of the Seethrough void tier. In the Dragon Palace, even ao Yao was far inferior to him.

Bringing Ao Yao and the rest along wouldn’t be of much use. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Now, it would be better for the Dragon Spur and the Dragon Palace to develop independently.

“Let’s set off immediately. It’s decided then!”

Wang Xian made a prompt decision. He looked at the auction house that had already opened its doors and didn’t enter.

“Let’s go and bid them farewell!”

Wang Xian thought to himself and immediately walked towards Feng Luan’s location.

He didn’t need to bid farewell to Zhang Fengying anymore. A month ago, Zhang Fengying sent him a message saying that she was going out to explore. Then, she disappeared.

“Have you really decided to go to the tomb of the demi-human? It’s extremely dangerous there!”

In the mayor’s residence, Feng Luan frowned as she looked at Wang Xian and spoke to him.

“I’ve decided. Currently, I need too many resources to increase my cultivation level. I have to go out and explore!”

Wang Xian nodded his head heavily at Feng Luan.

The development of the dragon spike was reaching a bottleneck. Even if it could occupy the assassin market of one or two countries, it was still not enough for him to increase his level.

Therefore, he had to solve the problem of resources on his own.

“Alright... Alright!”

Feng Luan looked at him and nodded with a frown.

“Shu Qing and the Dragon Palace would like you to take care of them during this period of time. The spiritual stones for the auction will be handed over to Prime Minister Gui!”

Wang Xian continued speaking to her.

“Why are you in such a hurry to Leave?”

“I have been in the Dragon Palace for more than two months. There’s nothing much to do here. You should leave as soon as possible!”

Wang Xian smiled and said to her.

“Alright, you must return safely!”

Feng Luan looked at him and said seriously.

“Don’t Worry!”

Wang Xian smiled and nodded. He waved at her and flew into the Dragon Palace.

“Prime Minister Gui, I will be going on a long trip for the next period of time. I will be back in half a year or more. I will leave the matters of the Dragon Palace to you!”

Wang Xian returned to the Dragon Palace and instructed Prime Minister Gui.

“It’s the Dragon King. Don’t worry. With the presence of leader Mu Zesen of the eye of the wind tribe, our Dragon Palace’s strength is not weak!”

Prime Minister Gui replied respectfully immediately.

“Yes, you can discuss with the civil officials about all the developments. Also, if you have any questions, you can look for Feng Luan!”

Wang Xian nodded and continued to talk to him. He then instructed a few more questions

Prime Minister Gui listened by the side and memorized them one by one.

After Wang Xian had given his instructions, he went to the dragon palace and interrupted the cultivation of a few girls. Then, he told them about it.

Although the few girls were reluctant to leave, they did not try to persuade them to stay.

They were also prepared to enter deep cultivation after Wang Xian left.

The talents of the girls were all stronger than the members of the Dragon Palace. Their abilities were improving very quickly.

Wang Xian walked in the sky above the Dragon Palace and looked down at the huge palace.

It’s a pity that the level of the nine dragons is too low. They can’t pull themselves to fly in the sky

Wang Xian thought to himself as he scanned the entire dragon palace.

The Dragon Palace was relatively spacious. There were only about 3,000 members in the Dragon Palace which covered an area of 80 kilometers. It was indeed relatively small.

It was only a little livelier at the north gate of the Dragon Palace.

There was a strange race here. It was also a race that Wang Xian had neglected the last time.

The killer crab race. Ever since they subdued the leader of the killer crab race, the killer crab race had been staying in the Dragon Palace.

Now, there were more than 20,000 killer crabs in total. They could enter the body of the leader of the killer crabs, ao crab.

When they were migrating to the Dragon Palace, ao crab was laying eggs in the dragon palace. Hence, he did not increase his strength.

At present, ao crab was only at level three of the extraordinary realm. However, he had more than 20,000 subordinates.

The killer crabs were similar to the Zerg race. Wang Xian placed them in the Dragon Palace and allowed them to cultivate freely.

He swept his gaze across the Dragon Palace and flew into the distance.

After dashing out of the ocean, Wang Xian flew a few thousand meters into the air with a map in his hand.

This was a map of the flowing sea region that Feng Luan had given him.

The map was not very clear. There was only a rough location of the kingdom.

However, this was enough.

“I’ll go out and explore on my own. Haha, it’s been a long time since I’ve had such an exciting feeling!”

Wang Xian’s eyes were filled with excitement. This made him feel the same kind of excitement and excitement as when he had just obtained the divine dragon system to explore the ocean.

Flying at a height of a few thousand meters, the Dragon-phoenix royal city below was getting smaller and smaller.

Wang Xian’s figure moved and his speed suddenly increased.

The vast and extraordinary continent appeared in front of his eyes. It was just like when Wang Xian first came to the vast ocean. Everywhere he went was filled with novelty.

He kept flying forward. With Wang Xian’s current strength that surpassed that of an extraordinary, his flying speed had increased by a lot.

In an hour, he could fly for about 1,000 kilometers.

However, the area of the extraordinary continent was more than 100 times that of Earth. Just the area of the flowing ocean was many times larger than Earth.

After flying for five hours, Wang Xian had already left the territory of Star Moon Kingdom and arrived at another dynasty.

Below him, a city was rapidly passing by.

Compared to the cities inhabited by humans, the area of the wilderness was hundreds or thousands of times larger than the cities inhabited by humans.

Ferocious beasts were rampant and demonic beasts were wreaking havoc.

The entire supernatural continent looked extremely desolate.

The number of humans was probably less than one-tenth of one-tenth of one-tenth of one-tenth of the number of ferocious beasts.

“Chirp, Chirp!”

At this moment, the chirping of birds and beasts suddenly came from the front. The sound was extremely loud and resonated throughout the entire sky.

At the bottom, the ferocious beasts hurriedly hid.

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly and looked ahead.

It was a group of birds and beasts that were completely red in color and emitting flames.

There were more than two hundred flaming birds. Each of them was about seven to eight meters in size. The average strength of these birds was around level eight of the supernatural realm.

The Flaming Bird in the middle had the strength of level nine of the supernatural realm!
