Translator: 549690339

“Weng Weng Weng Weng! ”

A terrifying crystal horn flew out from the Crystal Beast’s head.

In the surroundings, countless ordinary crystals surged towards the crystal horn.

In an instant, they entered the single horn of the Crystal Beast.

The single horn, along with countless ordinary crystals, emitted a terrifying strength.

The horn brought with it a terrifying might as it charged towards the eight rank 7 gods.

The horn’s speed was even more terrifying than the eight star chains of the eight rank 7 gods.

After all, this was the territory of the Crystal Behemoth!

“Not good!”

The eight rank 7 gods felt the horn of the crystal behemoth charging towards them. Their hearts pounded, and their faces were filled with fear.

Especially the last Type 7 god, when he saw the horn charging towards him, he was filled with fear.

“Defend! ”

He quickly shouted out!

The other 7 gods gritted their teeth, preparing to channel their energy into the starfield fragment to defend.

However, the horn suddenly sped up and disappeared.

It reappeared behind the Type 7 god and rammed into him.

A terrifying collision sound rang out.

The body of the Type 7 god crumbled under the impact.

“No, no, no, save me, save me!”

The Type 7 god felt death approaching, and his face was filled with despair as he roared out.

“Damn it! ”

Seeing this, the other seven pantheon gods had ugly expressions on their faces.

They had no time to save them.

One of them was killed by the horn.

The horn continued to attack the second one.

“Quick, quick, block this attack! ”

Seeing the attack coming towards him, the second pantheon God’s heart pounded and he shouted in fear.

“Star field, white dwarf star! ”

The few Type 7 gods in front roared out, and the star beneath their feet disappeared.

A white planet that was thick and heavy slammed towards the horn.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

The white dwarf star collided with the terrifying horn.

The Type 7 god, who was near the center, spat out a large amount of blood under the terrifying impact.

“Faith, sacrifice, heal!”

He hurriedly roared, and the phantoms of his followers appeared in the sky above him.

The Phantoms of his followers collapsed, turning into the power of faith to resist the impact.

The powerful book beneath him also resisted the terrifying attack!

However, the collision between the single-horned beast and the white dwarf star was too terrifying.

His body fell downwards, instantly losing all life!

“Not good, with the two of them dead, our control over the starfield fragment will be reduced by two, and its power will be reduced by a quarter. ”

A tier 7 pantheon saw that the single-horned beast had killed two of his members in an instant, and his face revealed an incomparably grave expression.

“Final counterattack, Starfield Black Hole Tide, Flee! ” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

One of the Type 7 gods roared out, sending his power of faith into the starfield fragment.

The remaining five Type 7 gods also hurriedly sent their power of faith.

Black holes appeared one after another, attacking the Unicorn and the crystal beast.

The powerful unicorn was swallowed by one black hole, coming out from the other.

However, after the horn came out, its energy was greatly weakened.

Similarly, it was also very far away from them!

The Crystal Behemoth hurriedly dodged the attacks of the black holes.

The six Type 7 gods did not hesitate at all, frantically fleeing into the distance. “Hehe, after losing two Type 7 gods, their strength is much weaker. We can’t let them escape so easily, and create some trouble for them.”

At the back, the two netherspirit avatars stared at this scene once more.

The two netherspirit avatars moved their palms, and Soul Spears appeared in their hands.

The Netherspirit avatars hid at the side, quietly waiting for the right time.

“This is the time! ”

When they fled in this direction.

The crystal behemoths behind them continued to chase after them, and the surrounding seawater attacked them.

The remaining six rank 7 gods hurriedly used the power of the starfield fragment to resist.

The next second after they used the power of the starfield fragment…

The Dark Ghost clone’s spear directly attacked two of the rank 7 gods.

If these gods didn’t rely on the power of the starfield fragment, their strength wouldn’t be strong at all.

Relying on the book of faith in their hands, their strength would be able to resist a ruler at the rank 8 realm.

The Soul Spear was a great killing weapon for a ruler of the ninth rank.

The moment they used the star field fragment, the soul spear arrived in front of the bodies of the two rank seven gods.

The sudden attack shocked the two rank seven gods.

“There’s a sneak attack! It’s the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace!”

“That Damn Dragon King of the Dragon Palace is ambushing us! ”

The two tier 7 gods who had been attacked immediately roared!

They moved their palms, and the book of faith under them instantly blocked in front of them.

At this time, the star field fragment could no longer be used in an instant.

However, in the next second, the soul spear pierced through their book of faith and directly pierced through their heads.

The terrifying power caused them to die instantly without even letting out a scream.

Whoosh! Whoosh

The ghost clone controlled the soul spear and flew toward them with the two corpses.

“Damn Dragon King of the Dragon Palace! ”

The death of their two companions instantly caused the remaining four rank seven gods to feel like their eyes were about to pop out of their sockets!

Of the eight rank seven gods, only four were left.

This caused their control over the star field fragment to drop to the extreme.

The amount of power they could mobilize was also reduced by half.

They looked at this scene with bloodshot eyes.

“Grab the corpse. The energy crystal is over there.”

A rank 7 pantheon immediately roared.

“Roar Roar Roar! “

However, at this time, the sound of the Crystal Beast’s roar could be heard from the rear.

The remaining four rank 7 pantheon heard this roar and their bodies trembled violently.

There were only four of them left. With their strength, they were not a match for this Crystal Beast!

Sensing the fatal power coming from behind, they looked at each other and gritted their teeth.

They shouted indignantly and hurried to the sky above the star field fragment.

Waves of energy surged into it, and the star field fragment quickly brought them to escape!

The soul spear pierced through the two corpses and flew toward the Netherspirit’s body.

The two netherspirit’s bodies were only staring at the Crystal Beast!

They made another bet. If the Crystal Beast continued to chase after the four gods, the two corpses would be collected smoothly.

They would be able to obtain more than fifty energy crystals..
