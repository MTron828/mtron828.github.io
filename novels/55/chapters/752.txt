Translator: 549690339

Everyone looked at Wang Xian in a daze, looking at the ice soul stone beside him.

At this moment, flower fairy’s feelings were the most complicated. Her eyes were flickering as she looked at the ice soul stone that was slowly closing.

She looked at the girl who had disappeared from her sight.

The girl who was lying inside the ice soul stone.

She could not help but feel a sense of jealousy in her heart.

She originally thought that this unknown young man was here to pursue her, to gain her favor.

He wanted to woo her by taking out some valuable items.

But now, it seemed that everything the young man did was not to please her, nor was it to gain her favor.

It was for that girl.

As long as it was something you could use, no matter how great the price, I would get it for you.

Even she was moved by such a man.

What a pity!

What a pity!

A hint of sadness appeared in flower fairy’s eyes. For the first time, she was actually envious of a girl.

She missed him, flower fairy. He was the beauty who ranked third among the top beauties in the Jianghu!

“Arrogant, you want to deal with us?”

When Bingchuan Yun heard Wang Xian’s words, a hint of coldness appeared in his eyes. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

He waved his arm and pointed an ice sword at Wang Xian. “I would like to see how you will deal with us. If you don’t give us an explanation for my junior brother’s injuries today!”

“Then, we will have to deal with you properly!”

“Clang! Clang! Clang!”

In an instant, more than ten disciples of the Ice God Celestial sect pulled out their spiritual swords.

They swept a glance at the ice soul stone and a hint of passion flashed in their eyes. They stared at Wang Xian and a hint of mockery flashed in their eyes.

This was the territory of their Tang Ding and the ice god Celestial sect.

They were not afraid of anyone here, even if this young man came from a powerful celestial sect. So what?

The Ice God celestial sect was no weaker than the others!

“Everyone, this is our innate celestial sect, not your ice god Celestial sect!”

Fairy flower looked at Wang Xian and sighed. She looked at Bingchuan Yun and said with a cold expression.

“Guests are guests. At the very least, they are our guests!”

Flower Fairy took a glance at her senior sister beside Bingchuan Yun and added.

That senior sister frowned slightly and didn’t say anything.

“That’s right. This young master is our guest. This is our natural born celestial sect!”

“That’s right. Don’t look down on our natural born celestial sect!”

A few girls behind flower fairy said.

The girls were all emotional. Seeing a young man sacrifice so much for a girl who was in a deep sleep, they were also very touched.

When Glacier Cloud saw flower fairy and a few natural born immortal sect girls speak up for him, his expression was slightly embarrassed.

“Since this is your hundred flower immortal sect, we can not make a move, but we have to take him away!”

“That’s fine. After all, Our Natural Born Immortal sect and the Ice God immortal sect have a very good relationship. Chuan Yun, you guys can’t do anything here. However, it’s not our responsibility to take him out!”

The girl beside Chuan Yun immediately chimed in.

Flower Fairy’s expression slowly turned a little awkward. She pursed her lips and did not say anything.

When the surrounding disciples of the true martial immortal sect saw this scene, they knew that this young man was doomed.

“Bring him out!”

Bingchuan Yun stared at Wang Xian and the corner of his mouth curled up slightly.

“Leave him to us!”

The middle-aged man and a young man beside him walked over directly. They held weapons in their hands and stared at Wang Xian coldly. “Be good. It’s best if you give up resisting. Otherwise, Hehe...”

“How can there be so many people who are courting death!”

Wang Xian looked at the two people who were walking towards him and swung his arm towards them.

The movement of his hand wasn’t fast. It was as though he was swatting a mosquito. There wasn’t any energy in it and everyone could see the trajectory of his attack.

The middle-aged man and the young man had a look of disdain in their eyes. They raised their arms and were about to press down on Wang Xian’s hands.

However, at this moment, a green energy was suddenly released and attacked the two of them at their chests.

“Huh?”

The two of them were stunned and immediately raised the spirit swords in their hands.

“Not good!”

The two of them changed their expressions. Their bodies were struck by the powerful force and were sent to the flower bushes behind them.

“We were too careless!”

“He actually dared to resist. He’s courting death!”

The two of them changed their expressions slightly. Their bodies shook and they were prepared to attack Wang Xian.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

However, at this moment, the beautiful flowers below started to move.

The beautiful flowers were like demons that devoured people. The thousands of flowers grew to a length of about 100 meters. Before the two of them could react, they were surrounded.

“Ahhh!”

Two miserable screams were heard. Then, there was nothing else.

The thousands of beautiful flowers returned to normal. Following that, the middle-aged man and the young man disappeared.

There was no blood. There was only a kind of demonic beauty.

Wang Xian didn’t want to be too bloody, so he turned the two of them into soil.

“What?”

“Damn it!”

“How dare you kill a disciple of our ice god Celestial sect!”

“Kill him!”

At the sight of this scene, the disciples of the ice god Celestial sect of Bingchuan Yun were enraged. A bone-chilling chill spread from the surroundings.

The three disciples of the ice god Celestial sect waved their arms. One of the middle-aged men had a terrifying aura that made people tremble.

Terrifying Ice Swords attacked Wang Xian one after another.

Wang Xian stood there indifferently. He opened his mouth slightly and the green dragon bead instantly attacked the three disciples of the ice god Celestial sect.

“Bang, Bang, Bang!”

The ice swords in front of him directly collapsed and dissipated. The three of them were knocked down in the Sea of flowers.

At this moment, the Sea of flowers once again turned into a terrifying sea of flower demons.

The three ice god Immortal sect disciples were instantly drowned!

“Senior Brother Binghai!”

“How is this possible! ?”

The Ice God immortal sect and everyone else were stunned. If the middle-aged youth who had just attacked had been killed due to carelessness, they could still accept it.

However, of the three ice god Immortal sect disciples that attacked next, the middle-aged man had the strength of the infant stage.

Among the disciples of the ice god Celestial sect, his potential and prestige were second only to Bingchuan Yun. Yet, he was still killed in an instant.

This shocked everyone.

“His strength!”

Bingchuan Yun’s pupils could not help but shrink as he stared at Wang Xian with a serious expression.

“He should be a half-step immortal God!”

“To be able to take out so many precious items, he must be extraordinary. He must be a half-step immortal God!”

“That green bead, if I’m not wrong, should be a level-thirteen spiritual artifact, the artifact of the Immortal!”

The expressions of everyone around changed slightly, especially the group of girls from the innate immortal sect.

Wang Xian was using the wood attribute. He controlled the sea of flowers beside him to turn into a terrifying flower monster. They could sense a terrifying energy.

Wang Xian’s expression did not change. He took a step forward slowly. The green dragon bead slowly emitted a wave of pressure. The green light instantly covered the group of Ice God sect’s disciples who were attacking.

Among them was the girl from the innate immortal sect.

“You... What are you doing? Let me tell you. This is our innate immortal sect. If you make a move here, our immortal God will not let you off!”

When the girl saw the green light covering her, her expression changed drastically. Her eyes were filled with fear.

“Young master, please stop. Don’t hurt Senior Sister!”

Flower fairy also changed her expression slightly and said hurriedly.

With the strength of a half-step immortal God and the artifact of an immortal God, it was a piece of cake to kill them all.

“You dare to make a move, huh? If you dare to make a move, our immortal God will kill you!”

Bingchuan Yun’s expression changed drastically as he shouted loudly.

“Why wouldn’t I dare to?”

Wang Xian said coldly. The green light shone brightly, causing everyone’s expression to change drastically.

“Guji Guji!”

At this moment, a strange sound was heard.

Upon hearing this sound, the girl beside Bingchuan Yun looked as though she had seen her savior. Her face was filled with excitement and malevolence.

“Guji is here. Haha, our deity is here. You are done for. You are done for!”
