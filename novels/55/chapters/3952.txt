Chapter 3953: 3952 treasure location

Translator: 549690339

Wang Xian looked at the location that was covered by the array formation and frowned slightly.

After sizing it up carefully, he couldn’t do anything about it.

Although he could ignore this magic array due to the special characteristics of an lie, Wang Xian couldn’t contact him at the moment.

Since they were in different universes, Wang Xian’s senses towards the dragon palace were very weak.

Therefore, he could not summon an lie over.

When he stepped into this sword and magic universe, Wang Xian made an agreement with an lie that they would contact each other once every 10,000 years.

At that time, he would set up the Devil Spirit Altar. An lie would find this new devil spirit altar and teleport over directly.

There were still 5,000 to 6,000 years before Wang Xian could contact an lie.

However, Wang Xian was not in a hurry. He might be able to stay in this area for another five to six thousand years.

When an lie arrived, he could ask him to take the treasures away.

With this thought in mind, Wang Xian continued to fly in.

He kept flying in. There were collapsed buildings everywhere.

However, there was a building in front of him that was exceptionally eye-catching.

This was a pagoda.

The entire pagoda occupied about one-tenth of the space in this area.

The pagoda stood at the center and was more than 100,000 meters tall.

The entire pagoda was divided into more than ten floors.

Wang Xian looked at the pagoda and scanned his surroundings.

He took a look around. It was either a collapsed building or an area that was covered by a magic array.

Even an area that was covered by a magic array couldn’t be entered.

This pagoda was the most complete one.

He moved his body and flew into the pagoda.

There was only one entrance to the pagoda. Wang Xian stood in front of the entrance and looked up.

The words ‘Moon Pagoda ‘were carved on the entrance.

He moved his body and flew into the pagoda.

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz

The moment he entered, a surge of majestic energy rushed over.

This energy contained the ten attributes of the sword and the magical universe.

The extremely dense energy made even Wang Xian exclaim in admiration.

“The density of this level of energy is comparable to the powerful treasure land occupied by the peak races of the nine-origin universe. ”

Wang Xian mumbled.

This forbidden land, the Void Moon, could be considered a peak race in the nine-origin universe.

“The Moon Tower is already full. Get out immediately. ”

At this moment, if he didn’t have enough strength, he would get out.

However, when Wang Xian entered the tower, a cold voice was heard immediately.

This made him slightly stunned as he looked inside.

The entire first level of the moon tower was spacious enough.

However, at this moment, there were many young middle-aged men sitting cross-legged on the first level.

At the entrance, a young man was staring at him coldly. He was full of warning.

Wang Xian’s gaze flickered slightly as he landed on the floor.

The floor of the hall on the first floor of the Moon Tower was made of a square magic stone.

Each magic stone was the same size, but it was divided into ten different attributes.

On each magic stone, there was an expert sitting cross-legged.

That majestic energy was transmitted from beneath the magic stone.

When Wang Xian saw this scene, he had a slight understanding in his heart.

There were thousands of these magic stones on the first level of the Tower of the Moon.

Each person occupied a magic stone to cultivate.

The number of people here was already full. If he wanted to enter the tower to cultivate again, he would have to use some of his strength!

Furthermore, Wang Xian was a space-attributed cultivator. If he wanted to cultivate, he would have to occupy a space-attributed magic stone.

Sweeping his gaze across the surroundings, Wang Xian’s gaze landed on the space-attributed cultivators.

Sweeping his gaze across the entire hall, most of them were at least level six universe knights.

This was especially so for the nine-attributed powerhouses outside the space. Most of them were at level seven or eight universe knights.

There was a limit to entering this holy moon.

There was an age limit.

Those who could enter this place could become cultivators with good potential.

Those universe knights who were very old and had not broken through for a long time would not be able to enter this place.

Wang Xian’s gaze landed on a space attribute cultivator who was at the fifth level of the Universe Knight Realm. He instantly came to the magic stone where the young man was.

The young man was cultivating. When he saw Wang Xian, his eyes immediately revealed an extremely cold expression!

“You ‘re courting death. Are you challenging me?”

He stared at Wang Xian. With a wave of his arm, a sharp sword appeared in his hand.

“1 want this position! ”

Wang Xian looked at him and said calmly!

“Alright, Alright. ”

The young man stared at Wang Xian coldly. With a move of his body, he flew out.

“Let me see what qualifications you have to snatch my position!”

A voice entered Wang Xian’s ears.

Wang Xian scanned his surroundings and his body moved. He followed closely behind and flew out.

Obviously, there was an unspoken rule here. If one wanted to occupy a position, one had to go outside to spar.

Only the winner had the qualifications.

“Go to hell! ”

The moment Wang Xian appeared, countless sharp swords were flying towards him.

His methods were ruthless and didn’t give him any time to react!

Buzz

Wang Xian saw countless sharp swords flying towards him. He waved the sword in his hand in front of him!

Sword Shield! ”

He shouted in a low voice. A sword shield appeared around him and easily blocked the attacks of the sharp swords.

“HMPH, 10,000 swords in one! ”

In the sky, the young man snorted coldly. He waved his arm and a sharp sword slashed towards Wang Xian.

The densely packed sharp swords in the surroundings merged into the sharp sword and slashed towards Wang Xian directly!

Wang Xian looked over and his body flickered slightly. He disappeared directly and came to the right of the young man.

“Teleportation, I know it too. Man and Sword in one! ”

The young man’s eyes glowed. His figure appeared on the huge sharp sword in a strange manner.

At the same time, he teleported with the sharp sword.

Wang Xian sensed the energy fluctuation in the surroundings and raised his eyebrows slightly.

The sharp sword in his hand immediately slashed toward the position behind him.

The next moment, his sword radiance collided with the huge sword condensed by the young man.

“He actually sensed the location of my teleportation?”

When the young man saw that Wang Xian had already attacked the moment he appeared, his gaze froze slightly!

A hint of vigilance appeared on his face.

In a battle between spatial attribute cultivators, one’s perception was strong and would have a huge advantage. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

This was because the other party could sense the location of your teleportation and attack that location at the instant you teleported.

“Alright, I won’t play with you anymore. ”

Wang Xian looked at the young man and said faintly.

He continued his teleportation and arrived at the left side of the young man.

Sword Cross!”

At the same time, he waved the sharp sword in his hand and shouted softly.

A gigantic cross-shaped sword was formed and attacked the young man..
