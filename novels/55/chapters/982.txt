Chapter 983: Treasure 0984: Lightning Strike Wood

Translator: 549690339

Yun Hanhai and the others looked at the large area of lightning on the main peak of the Lightning Island, their hearts palpitating.

The main peak of the Lightning Island was the most dangerous place on the Lightning Island. With their strength, they didn’t dare to step onto the main peak’s height of 500 meters.

The entire main peak was the place with the highest density of lightning, and there were many thunderfish gathered there.

Similarly, there would definitely be a lot of lightning fruits there, but they didn’t dare to take the risk.

“Speed up a bit, let’s find that Kid First!”

Yun Hanhai scanned the surroundings and said to the members of the young master’s mercenary group.

“It’s Young Master Yun!”

The group nodded and began to search the surroundings.

Among the 20 of them, there were three transcendent-level rank 6 experts, and they were very powerful. As long as they didn’t enter the main peak, there wouldn’t be too much danger.

However, what they did not expect was that the person they were looking for was currently on the main peak!

“Kill!”

Wang Xian and the rest had only flown five hundred meters when they encountered dozens of extraordinary level five thunderfish. They were scattered around in groups.

In the middle of them, there was a lightning fruit that was flashing with light.

Wang Xian moved his body and charged toward the dozens of thunderfish.

He used the Azure Dragon’s energy to control the surrounding lightning trees and charged towards the thunderfish one by one.

Ao Jian and the rest were supporting him from behind. Once the thunderfish were trapped, they would charge forward immediately.

When faced with ferocious beasts of the same level and trapped, their metal longswords could penetrate the thunderfish’s body and kill them in one strike.

Ao Yao brought his subordinates and quickly harvested the thunderfish’s corpses.

“One, two, three, four!”

The four thunder fruits were all at transcendent level five, which made Wang Xian very satisfied.

The four thunder fruits were equivalent to more than 200,000 mid-grade spirit stones. Together with the corpses of the thunderfish, they instantly harvested more than one million mid-grade spirit stones.

Such a speed of harvesting was extremely terrifying.

Not everyone could do what Wang Xian did. If it were a powerful mercenary group, even if they had great strength, they wouldn’t be as freakish as him.

With the unique light and dark fire dragon eyes, it could increase the efficiency of Wang Xian and the rest by more than ten times.

“There are extraordinary level six thunderfish up there. Ao Jian, you guys clean up the battlefield at the back!”

Wang Xian raised his head and looked up. There were already extraordinary level six thunderfish at a height of more than a thousand meters above the mountain peak.

There were extraordinary level six thunderfish at a height of a thousand meters. Wouldn’t there be extraordinary level eight or nine thunderfish at the peak of five to six thousand meters?

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered as he looked at the thunderfish lying on the rocks.

He stretched out his arm and pointed at more than a dozen directions. Then, he waved his hand at the group of strange demons.

A transcendent level six thunderfish was about to be taken seriously.

“PFFT! PFFT! PFFT!”

“Crackle! Crackle!”

One by one, the strange demons concealed themselves in the void and appeared beside the thunderfish. Then, they attacked with their sharp claws.

The sharp claws penetrated the vital parts of the thunderfish and killed them in one strike.

With their piercing eyes, they had a high chance of assassinating creatures with stronger defenses.

However, the counterattacks of some of the thunderfish before they died still alarmed the surrounding thunderfish.

“Coo-coo!”

A strange cry came out from the mouths of some of the thunderfish. The lightning once again covered the entire area.

Wang Xian smiled and moved his body to attack the remaining thunderfish.

The difference in strength between each level of transcendence was huge.

Wang Xian’s combat strength of level seven transcendence in his human form could deal with dozens of ferocious beasts of level six transcendence.

The thunderfish of level six transcendence did not pose any hindrance to him.

“Eight thunder fruits of level six transcendence!”

Wang Xian kept them and looked up again. He did not go to the other side of the mountain peak. He wanted to see how strong the strongest thunderfish at the peak of the main peak of the Thunder Island would be.

If they were not strong, after he finished them off, the entire Thunder Island would be unimpeded. He could easily kill all the thunderfish and obtain all the Thunder Fruits.

He continued to kill his way up. In half an hour, he traveled a distance of two thousand meters and killed more than a hundred level six extraordinary thunderfish.

“Level seven extraordinary. There’s a level seven extraordinary. Could there be level nine extraordinary thunderfish at the summit?”

When he reached a height of more than three thousand meters, Wang Xian looked ahead with a hint of wariness in his eyes.

In his line of sight, three five to six meter sized thunderfish were lying on rocks one by one.

On the rocks at this location, there were flashes of lightning. The long-term lightning strikes caused the rocks to be imbued with powerful lightning.

In fact, a thousand meters above them were thick black clouds. As for the situation above the black clouds, Wang Xian had no idea.

“Ao Yao, it’s up to you now!”

Unless Wang Xian could easily kill a level seven supernatural beast after transforming into a divine dragon, he would have to expend some energy in his human form.

Other than Ao Yao, there were two other strange demons who possessed the offensive power of a level seven supernatural beast.

However, this would waste too much time. Wang Xian directly ordered ao Yaoyao to take action.

“Dragon King, leave it to me!”

Wang Xian passed the location of the thunderfish to AO Yaoyao. With AO Yaoyao’s strength, the thunderfish of transcendent-level rank-7 were quickly killed.

For a ferocious beast of transcendent-level rank-7, even if Wang Xian were to devour it, he would be able to increase it by 700 to 800 Dragon Crystals! Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Four thunder fruits, and they are of transcendent-level Rank-7!”

Wang Xian smiled. He flew over immediately and kept the thunder fruits.

With Ao Yao taking action, his speed was no slower than before.

One by one, the thunderfish were killed. In just 10 minutes, Wang Xian had found more than 10 level seven supernatural thunder fruits.

“Dragon King, do you want to continue?”

After ao Yao killed the last Thunderfish around him, he looked up and asked Wang Xian.

Wang Xian also raised his head and looked up.

Above them, there were thick black clouds. The crackling sound of thunder and lightning could be heard from behind the black clouds.

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered as he looked up with his dragon eyes.

“Eh? Up Here?”

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly and revealed a surprised expression.

“Ao Yao, let’s go up and take a look. The rest of you stay below!”

Wang Xian hesitated for a moment and said to Ao Jian and the rest.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

“Let’s go, Ao Yao. The dark clouds are filled with lightning. Be careful!”

Wang Xian said to Ao Yao and leaped into the dark clouds.

Transform into a dragon!

His body underwent a terrifying transformation. A 30-meter-long five-colored divine dragon appeared directly in the dark clouds.

Ao Yao leaped and followed beside Wang Xian.

“Crackle crackle!”

“Huala!”

“Crack Crack!”

The thickness of the black clouds reached more than 30 meters. Wang Xian slowly poked his head out and the sound of dense thunderbolts could be heard from his surroundings.

Thunderbolts. There were Thunderbolts everywhere.

They covered an area of four to five thousand meters.

The entire mountain peak was covered by the Thunderbolts.

“That is!”

Wang Xian stuck his head out of the Black Cloud and stared at the top of the mountain peak.

There, a blue light was shining.
