Chapter 140: He’s the King of Rivertown (2)

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

Wang Xian’s mocking voice resounded throughout the entire training field as everyone’s attention fell on him.

It was this juvenile who had offended the Yan Family. Yan Family had invited him over and was preparing to teach him a lesson.

However, to the Yan Family’s surprise, he had called along a group of terrifying people with him.

The disciple of the Sacred Seas of Swords was still arrogantly demanding his surrender to the Yan Family just a while ago. As of this moment, all he could do was make empty threats and beg for forgiveness.

What a huge twist of events!

At this juncture, Wang Xian wouldn’t even be bothered by him.

“So what if you are from the Sacred Seas of Swords?” Wang Xian smirked and looked at Yan Feng.

“You...” Yan Feng instantly got embarrassed.

“Watch your words!”

Mo Qinglong swung his arm and dense devilish aura penetrated into Yan Feng’s body directly.

He didn’t even have the opportunity to react when his body stiffened.

“YOU... You destroyed my Elixir Field!”

Yan Feng’s body shivered violently. His eyes were bloodshot as he stared at Mo Qinglong.

“Oh, do you think this is over? Threatening us with the Sacred Seas of Swords?”

Mo Qinglong looked emotionlessly at Yan Feng and his eyes were filled with contempt.

Yan Feng’s body tensed up. He had not expected this group of people to be unafraid of the Sacred Seas of Swords, or to cripple him directly.

Helplessness and despair started welling up in his heart. This was the very first time he felt such emotions since he was born.

“Incredible. This group of people is too strong. They aren’t even flinching when dealing with a disciple of the Sacred Seas of Swords.”

“That old man is an inborn expert. Using Sacred Seas of Swords as a threat wouldn’t be effective. Do you really expect the Sacred Seas of Swords to risk their men to fight with an Inborn expert for Yan Feng?”

“Inborn experts could easily rule over an area. Yan Feng’s threat was simply a taunt to the old man. He has truly caused his own demise!”

“The Yan Family is finished!”

The surrounding Martial Artists and Families looked at this in shock as the Dragonians walked towards the Yan Family members whose faces had turned as white as sheets.

Every member of the Yan Family looked on in despair.

Wang Xian looked across Yan Feng and his family with contempt. He walked directly to Old Duan to heal his injuries before helping him up.

“Thank you! Thank you, my benefactor, Wang Xian!”

Old Duan, who was previously filled with despair, was trembling in agitation and even wanted to go down on his knees to thank Wang Xian.

Wang Xian patted him on his shoulders and replied, “It’s alright!”

“I leave this to you guys. I’ll be waiting for you at the pavilion by the side!” Wang Xian said to Mo Qinglong.

“Yes, Dragon King!”

Mo Qinglong nodded his head respectfully.

“That Old Man was addressing that juvenile as Dragon King?”

“An inborn expert has to be so respectful to that juvenile? This...”

“What is his real identity to have an inborn expert obeying his commands? Can it be that he is from an even stronger Ancient Martial Arts Family?”

Upon seeing how Mo Qinglong reacted to Wang Xian, everyone around was dumbfounded.

Seeing the juvenile walking freely to the pavilion and even pouring himself a cup of tea under such circumstances, they couldn’t help but have even more respect for him.

This was probably what they called the demeanor of a King.

That insufferably arrogant Yan Feng from the Yan Feng was miles apart from this juvenile, who was unfazed by the circumstances!

All he did was say a few words and smile as he watched, and he could decide the survival of your family.

This difference in demeanor was distinct. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Wang Xian sat within the pavilion leisurely. He had vented his frustration that had built up because of the Yan Family, and what was remaining could be easily dealt with by Mo Qinglong.

Mo Qinglong was from the Ancient Fiend Clan and would naturally know how to deal with such matters. This time, the Yan Family would truly be erased from Rivertown!

“Great tea!”

Despite the incessant screams and wails, Wang Xian ignored all of them and simply focused on enjoying his tea.

The tea was fragrant and made one want more of it.

Wang Xian loved to drink tea and disliked drinking alcohol. This was because of the influence of his neighbour, Uncle Zhang.

The Yan Family’s Mountain Villa had beautiful scenery. In front of the pavilion was a small stream. Enjoying the scenery while drinking tea was a great way for one to liven up.

“However, I still like to be near the seas during the spring. Moreover, I could even dive into the sea to look around when I have nothing to do. Hehe!” Wang Xian mumbled to himself.

“Dragon King!”

After half an hour, Mo Qinglong brought a group of people over as he reported to Wang Xian respectfully.

The Dragonians didn’t follow over. The group of people behind Mo Qinglong were all Martial Artists and Families of Rivertown!

“Dragon King!”

All the Martial Artists and Families of Rivertown hesitated for a moment before greeting Wang Xian in the same respectful manner.

Hmm.

Wang Xian nodded his head and smiled faintly to Mo Qinglong. “Are you done?”

“Everything has been settled. Moreover, this incident won’t leak out!”

Mo Qinglong smiled. This wasn’t the doings of the Dragon Sect but the doings of all the Martial Artists and Families in Rivertown.

Everyone who was present wouldn’t spread this incident...they wouldn’t dare to.

All they had to do was to treat the Yan Family as if they had never returned.

The only possible issue would be Yan Feng’s identity as the disciple of the Sacred Seas of Swords. However, the Dragon Sect wasn’t fearful of them.

“Hmm!” Wang Xian nodded his head.

“Thank you, Dragon King, for breaking us free from the control of the Yan Family. If the Dragon King is to encounter any issues, you could instruct our Ren Family and we wouldn’t reject your request!”

“Thank you, Dragon King! Just a word from the Dragon King and we, the Martial Artists of Rivertown, would risk our lives to complete your task in the future!”

“Thank you, Dragon King!”

The family head of the Ren Family immediately thanked Wang Xian. Currently, the circumstances of Rivertown had changed. This juvenile in front of him would be the ruler of the underworld of Rivertown.

The remaining Martial Artists and Families also expressed their gratitude immediately and made their loyalty pledges. Looking from another perspective, they had surrendered their services to the Dragon Sect.

Dragon Sect was different from the Yan Family. Dragon Sect had an Inborn expert. Even if they were restricted by the Dragon Sect, they were willing to be so.

When one’s strength reached a level where others could only look up to them, they would not choose to resist, but rather to follow.

Wang Xian listened to the loyalty pledges of various Martial Artists and Families before waving his hand. “Everything will be as before. Don’t cause trouble in Rivertown and stay within your area. Oh, right! I’ve opened a medical hall along Old Street. If you suffered grave injuries or have lingering injuries, you can come to me for treatment. I have to inform you guys that the fees are very high.”

Wang Xian spoke nonchalantly. However, the Martial Artists and Families in front of them were all shocked.

What does he mean? Everything as before? Don’t cause troubles? He operates a medical hall?

What this would mean is that he will not be consolidating the underworld of Rivertown. He will not be declaring himself as the ruler and will not rob us of our interests.

And he operates a medical hall?

This... This...!

Everyone was taken aback.

Every single one of them had already prepared their pledges of allegiance, prepared to lose a large portion of their interests and prepared to make Wang Xian their leader. However, Wang Xian wanted them to carry on as before!

“Thank you, Dragon King, for your compassion!”

“Thank you, Dragon King, for your compassion!”

All the Martial Artists and Families were agitated and looked at Wang Xian with deep respect. They bowed down immediately as they expressed their gratitude.

Wang Xian smiled and waved his hand. He looked to Old Xue and said, “Old Xue, look for me at my medical hall at noon tomorrow. I’ll take a look at your injuries.”

“Yes!” Seeing Wang Xian talking to him caringly, Old Xue got agitated. He sighed emotionally, “Thank you, Brother Wang Xian!”

“Don’t stand on ceremony. Everyone, I have to go. It’s already past 9 pm and I have something in school!”

Wang Xian smiled, turned around and left.

“This compassion and demeanor! In Rivertown, he’s the King!”

“If he’s the king, I’m convinced!”
