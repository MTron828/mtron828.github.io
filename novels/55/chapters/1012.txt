Chapter 1013: The leader of the 1014 clan

Translator: 5496903

The strange demon that was shrouded in white light was treated as a human by the wind-winged savage fish.

The claws of the Ao demon were blocked by the green wind shield, and its figure appeared instantly.

When Wang Xian saw that the extraordinary level eight wind-winged savage fish was actually able to block the attack of the Ao demon, he revealed a look of surprise.

“Is it another treasure?”

Wang Xian looked over and moved his body. He walked over from the entrance.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

The group of strange demons instantly arrived behind Wang Xian. The strange demon also came to his side.

“Dragon King, this leader of the wind-winged savage fish has a weapon on him to block my attack!”

Ao Yao stared at the leader of the wind-winged Savage Fish and said with a solemn expression.

“Humans, it is indeed you. You Bunch of despicable and cunning humans actually barged into our lair!”

The four-meter-long wind-winged savage fish on the central platform lay there, its huge head staring at them coldly.

On its head, a green crown slowly formed.

Its ferocious face only added a bit of dignity.

“It’s that Green Crown!”

Ao Yao stared at the Green Crown on its head and said with a grave expression.

It was definitely not an ordinary treasure that could withstand his assassination.

“Submit to me. Otherwise, all of you will die!”

Wang Xian’s gaze swept across the entire hall. The leader of the wind-winged savage fish was at level eight supernatural realm, and the leader of the Brocade scale boa was at level eight supernatural realm.

After fifteen of the level seven supernatural realm warriors were killed by the strange demon in an instant, there were only about ten of them left.

This force was not very strong. They could easily destroy it.

“Surrender? Die!”

The leader of the wind-winged savage fish lay on the high platform with its head stretched out. Its eyes were roaring crazily.

It opened its mouth. The crown on its head was flickering with a dense green wind energy.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

In an instant, wind blades that blotted out the sky and the Earth attacked them.

With a wave of Wang Xian’s arm, the Earth Shield appeared in front of them instantly.

“Bang! Bang! Bang!”

The earth shield collapsed immediately after the collision.

“Huh? What a powerful attack!”

Wang Xian’s expression changed slightly. He moved his body and dodged to the side. The group of strange demons behind him dodged in a hurry.

“Kill them!”

Wang Xian ordered Ao Yao and the rest directly.

“Yes!”

Ao Yao stared at the leader of the wind-winged savage fish and attacked it in an instant.

The group of Strange Yaoyao also attacked the wind-winged savage fish and the jinlin boa in the entire nest.

Wang Xian stood there and did not make a move. His gaze swept across the entire nest of the wind-winged savage fish.

Behind him was a ten-meter-long statue of the wind-winged savage fish that was draped in green leather. Behind the statue was a cave.

The cave was emitting a green light. This light blocked his vision.

The entire statue and the cave behind it gave him a mysterious feeling. It was like a place of worship for a race.

Demonic Beasts possessed intelligence that was not inferior to humans. They also had all sorts of strange customs.

“Bang! Bang!”

A violent sound was heard. Wang Xian turned his head and looked at the scene. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

More than a dozen wind-winged savage fish and the Brocade scale boa that were at transcendent level seven were easily killed by the strange demon.

Even the rank eight extraordinary brocade scale boa was instantly killed by Ao Yao.

Only the rank eight extraordinary leader, the leader of the race of the wind-wing savage fish, was left.

However, at this moment, his body also slammed heavily into the wall.

“Damn it, damn it, we are both Demon Beasts, why do you have to listen to the orders of humans!”

The wind-wing savage fish lay on the ground with a furious expression. It stared at Ao Yao and roared loudly.

“If you don’t surrender, die!”

Ao Yao’s expression did not change. A strange black and white energy flickered slightly, and its figure instantly disappeared from the sight of the wind-winged savage fish.

“Roar, damn it!”

It opened its huge mouth and attacked in front of it. Wind blades covered the front without any difference.

“Bang!”

However, at this moment, a claw landed on the top of its head and heavily hit the Green Crown.

“Wind Wing Crown!”

Sensing ao Yao attacking the Crown on its head, it roared loudly.

“Buzz!”

The Green Crown suddenly released a Green Shadow and flew towards Ao Yao comfortably.

“No mortal can touch the crown. Die!”

The Green Crown Shadow instantly bound Ao Yao. The wind wing Savage Fish’s huge mouth fiercely bit at him.

“Light and dark void!”

Ao Yao’s expression changed. He wanted to break free, but he found that he could not break free from the Crown’s binding.

His body trembled and directly turned into nothingness, avoiding the crown’s binding and the wind-winged savage fish leader’s attack.

“Light and dark explosion!”

Ao Yao’s bright claws and sickle-like claws intersected as he gently waved at Ao Yao.

Light-dark explosion, another divine ability of the dragon spike.

Light and dark intersected, unleashing the most terrifying attack.

It could be detonated, or it could be detonated in an area.

Ao yaoguang waved both of his arms, and a light-dark thread intersected.

“Boom!”

The terrifying explosion landed directly on the body of the leader of the wind-wing savage fish. The crown on its head trembled violently, and green wind elemental energy enveloped its body.

“Hua Hua!”

The terrifying explosion caused the entire nest to tremble slightly. The body of the wind-wing savage fish smashed heavily towards the back, landing directly on the statue.

“Roar Roar, Roar Roar, Invaders, you deserve to die, Ah Ah Ah Ah!”

The wind-wing savage fish raised its head with great difficulty. Its entire body was bathed in fresh blood as it stared ferociously at Ao Yao.

The wind-winged crown on its head was extremely dim.

“Go to hell!”

Ao Yao’s figure flashed as he instantly appeared in front of the wind-winged savage fish.

“Great wind-winged Savage Fish Bloodline, give me strength!”

The wind-winged savage fish leader’s body suddenly trembled as the blood flowing out of its body seemed to have evaporated.

Ao Yao’s black and white pupils constricted. With a wave of her arm, three beams of light shot towards the wind-winged savage fish.

“Huala!”

At this moment, the green leather covering the statue suddenly glowed brightly. The green light enveloped the wind-winged savage fish.

The three attacks were easily blocked.

The green leather directly covered the wind-winged savage fish leader.

“Ka Ka Ka!”

“Haha, Ancestor’s Bloodline, go to Hell!”

The body of the leader of the wind-winged savage fish grew rapidly. In just a short second, it turned into a ten-meter-long wind-winged savage fish.

It stared at AO Yaoyao with a ferocious expression.

“It’s so difficult to deal with. The leader of a demonic beast race actually has such means?”

Wang Xian revealed a surprised expression.

The wind-winged crown, this magical green leather, was more magical than the other.

“As expected of the leader of a Demonic Beast Race!”

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered as he looked at the level 6 supernatural demon. “Let’s do it!”

“It’s the Dragon King!”

A level 8 supernatural demon with wings of the wind was attacking Wang Xian and his two most powerful underlings. This demonic beast race was not simple at all.

Wang Xian moved his body and transformed into a divine dragon!

The strange demon at the side flashed with light and charged forward!
