2692 2692, an announcement from the imperial court

“Hu hu!”

“Patriarch, what should we do now? What should we do? According to the news from the east, the Dragon Palace is flying toward us. They want to take over our territory!”

“Damn it! Damn it! Seven of our elders were killed this time. Patriarch, we want revenge! Revenge!”

Just as the Dragon Palace was rushing towards the center of the Demon Island, it was on a planet of the world margin sect.

In a palace surrounded by clouds and Immortal Qi, tens of thousands of undying godly monarchs from the world margin sect gathered together.

In front of them, the Warriors from the world margin sect roared angrily.

“Cough cough, patriarch, we want revenge!”

On the seats in front of them, sect master horizon and the two elders looked like they were about to die. They looked at the two forefathers in front of them and said with hatred in their eyes.

“Hu!”

The two forefathers of the horizon sect slowly closed their eyes and exhaled.

The strength of the Dragon Palace had far exceeded their expectations. Now that they had lost the horizon ruler, they were no longer a match for the Dragon Palace.

“Wait here for a moment.”

Dozens of seconds later, a patriarch slowly opened his eyes and said.

The other patriarch also opened his eyes. They looked at each other and then disappeared.

“What?”

The people of the world margin sect were slightly stunned and fell silent.

The current situation was related to the fate of the entire world margin. Only the two patriarchs could decide.

“Will that person help us?”

At the same time, in a room surrounded by clouds, a patriarch of the world margin sect asked in a deep voice.

The other patriarch shook his head, not knowing what was going on. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

He looked at the mirror in front of him and waved his arm.

“Dong Dong Dong!”

The sound of knocking could be heard from the mysterious mirror.

“Brother of the world margin sect, what’s the matter?”

An old man’s figure soon appeared in the mysterious mirror.

An item of a flame token was sitting cross-legged on a futon on the old man’s back.

“Protector Emperor, our world margin sect has encountered a powerful enemy and suffered heavy losses. The enemy is now heading toward our territory.”

A world margin patriarch cupped his hands and said.

“Oh? You have encountered an enemy? With your strength, few forces are your match.”

The elder in the mirror was slightly surprised and said.

“It’s the Dragon Palace, a newly rising force. They killed seven elders and millions of disciples of the world’s end. We’re not their match. Now, they’re rushing toward us. Please help us, Protector Emperor.”

Patriarch world begged with an embarrassed expression.

“The Dragon Palace? The power of the Master of the frost goddess? Are they so powerful?”

Protector thearch was slightly surprised in the mirror.

He knew a little about the power of the Dragon Palace. The Master of the Frost Goddess on the Demon Island seemed to have a deep relationship with the current empress of the imperial court.

“Yes, it’s that Dragon King. Protector thearch, can you...”

Patriarch Tianya immediately nodded.

“Now that the war has broken out in the imperial court, I can’t manage Tianya for the time being.”

Protector monarch’s face revealed a thoughtful expression as he said softly.

“Protector monarch, our world horizon great sect has done many things for you and the imperial court. Now that we are in danger, we implore protector monarch to help us.”

When forefather horizon heard his words, his face was embarrassed as he pleaded once again.

“Currently, our imperial court’s side is unable to leave with our manpower. How about this, Your World Horizon Great sect will come to our side and contribute to the imperial court. I will arrange a place for you.”

“Everything will be discussed after the Abyss War is over. In addition, I will order the imperial court to issue a notice. During the Imperial Star Field’s all-out war, any factions are prohibited from fighting each other. Those who violate this will be killed without mercy!”

Protector monarch said indifferently.

“This...”

The two world margin forefathers opened their mouths, their expressions changing.

“The void God Kingdom on the Cold Night Island is about to open. At that time, I will give you two spots. If you can obtain a great opportunity, I will respect you.”

At this moment, Protector Emperor looked at them and said.

“Is the Cold Night Island’s void God kingdom about to open?”

The two forefathers of the world margin sect looked at each other with burning eyes.

“Thank you, Protector Emperor!”

The two cupped their hands and thanked him.

“Hehe, I am waiting for everyone at the junction between the imperial court and the Cold Night Island.”

...

The Protector Emperor said with a smile, and then the image disappeared.

“We’ve done so many things for the imperial court, but now that we’re in danger, they’re not willing to take action.”

When the image disappeared, a patriarch of the world margin sect shook his head slightly.

“The Dragon Palace isn’t simple either. Forget it. It’s not bad that the protector emperor can give us two spots. If we can get a great opportunity, everything will be worth it.”

“Although it’s illusory, it’s a slim chance for us.”

As the two conversed, they moved and disappeared again, returning to the Great Hall at the end of the world.

“All disciples pack up and go to the junction of the imperial court and the Cold Night Island.”

The two came back and immediately announced.

“Patriarch, are we... are we going to leave this place?”

All the disciples of the world margin trembled when they heard this, and they said with extremely ugly expressions.

Their world margin sect had been in the central area of the Demon Island for hundreds of millions of years. Now that they had escaped, everyone was very unwilling.

...

“We are not a match for the Dragon Palace. When we reach the border between the imperial court and the Cold Night Island, we will have the protection of the imperial court. One day, we will be able to take revenge for what happened today!”

One of the world’s End Patriarchs roared in a low voice, his eyes filled with killing intent.

“Yes, Patriarch!”

The rest of the disciples nodded heavily and immediately went out to prepare.

They were going to escape from here.

The next day, the entire demon island was shaken.

The news of the world’s end defeating the Dragon Palace had not spread yet. When everyone saw that all the experts and disciples of the world’s end great sect were moving toward the center of the Imperial Star Field, it caused a huge uproar.

Very soon, the news of the Dragon Palace severely injuring the heaven’s end great sect and occupying the territory of the heaven’s end great sect spread at a terrifying speed.

When all the citizens of the Demon Island received this news, their faces were filled with shock.

The Heaven’s end great sect was one of the strongest forces on their demon island. No one dared to provoke them, but now, they were actually forced to flee by the Dragon Palace.

This made everyone feel incredulous.

On the artificial intelligence system, everyone in the Demon Island was talking about it. Soon, everyone learned about what had happened in the East Abyss.

Everyone was shocked by the Dragon Palace’s strength.

One day later, the imperial court suddenly made an announcement on the artificial intelligence system.

The invasion of the Abyss and the start of the race war. Any human forces were forbidden to fight among themselves. Otherwise, they would be killed without mercy!

A very short notice, the entire imperial star field everyone can see.
