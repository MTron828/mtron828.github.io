Chapter 3048: 3047 shook the willow deity Daoist sect

“Brother Wang, these two ships are celestial emperor level six ships. Their value is not low.”

When Mi Xinlu saw Wang Xian killing the ice mountain race, there was not much fluctuation.

This was how the universe worked. They fought each other for resources.

This was the only way to become stronger.

“Okay.”

Wang Xian nodded his head. He moved his body and entered the two ships. He swept his gaze across the ships. Other than some items, there was nothing else.

With a wave of his arm, he kept the two ships and came to the great mill of the five elements.

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian said faintly.

“Brother Wang, you killed a disciple of the willow deity Daoist sect. Is It Bad?”

Mi Xinlu asked worriedly.

“The venerable willow deity does not interfere in such matters.”

Wang Xian said nonchalantly. He swept his gaze across the surroundings and continued to fish.

…

“Huff, Huff, Huff!”

“That Wang Xian actually dared to kill us. He actually killed all the members of Our Ice Mountain race. How dare he!”

“Report to our tribe leader. Report to Our Ice Mountain Race.”

At the same time, on a wide branch of the willow deity Daoist sect, two figures appeared with pale faces and cold sweat on their foreheads.

They were still in shock as they roared in a low voice. Their faces were filled with shock and anger.

They had never expected that the newcomer would be so ruthless. He did not give them any face and attacked them directly.

They had never expected that he was so powerful.

“Tell this matter to the clan leader and the rest. I want to announce this matter to the Divine Willow Daoist sect. I want to tell all the senior brothers and disciples to let them know who that Wang Xian is.”

A middle-aged man growled in a low voice with an incomparably cold expression.

He took out the universal AI and told the entire matter to the group of disciples of the Liu God Daoist sect.

“What? The new junior brother Wang Xian killed Bing Ling Hongyu, Bing Ling Shan Chuan, Ao Wu Yun and the rest? Hiss… this…”

“Is this for real? The new disciple killed Bing Ling Hongyu and the rest?”

“That Wang Xian is not at the third level of the Celestial Thearch Realm? Those who are able to join our willow deity Daoist sect have to go through a test of their temperament. Is there a special reason for this?”

“Is the new Wang Xian so powerful? Is He so unscrupulous?”

In the group chat of the disciples of the Willow deity Daoist sect, when everyone saw this news, they were extremely shocked.

How long had this new disciple, Wang Xian, been in the Willow deity Daoist sect?

Now, he actually killed three disciples of the Willow deity Daoist sect?

And that Wang Xian, what was his strength?

He was actually so unbridled.

All the disciples were extremely shocked and bewildered. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

In the willow deity Daoist sect, although there were disciples who died occasionally, such an incident where they were directly killed by their fellow disciples had never happened before.

It might have happened, but at the very least, it was not exposed.

Now, a new disciple had just arrived for two months, and he had killed three disciples. This…

The entire Divine Willow Daoist sect was in an uproar.

All the disciples were extremely shocked by Wang Xian’s actions.

They were also slightly apprehensive about Wang Xian.

It was best to have less contact with such people.

“Senior brother, we received news from our race. They want us to know everything about that Wang Xian. We will definitely exterminate him.”

In the Willow deity Daoist sect, two middle-aged men had a ferocious expression when they received the news from their race.

Among their ice mountain domain-level race, only the five of them had entered the willow deity Daoist sect.

For a domain-level faction, having a disciple who could enter the willow deity Daoist sect meant that the race would have a few more experts in the future.

The weakest disciple who walked out from the willow deity Daoist sect had reached the eighth level of the celestial thearch.

It was normal for them to reach the ninth level divine emperor.

The ninth level divine emperor was considered a pillar in their domain-level races.

The death and injury of such disciples was not a small loss to their race.

This made everyone from the ice mountain race extremely furious. They were determined to take revenge.

“I’ll find some friends from the willow deity Daoist sect and have them pay attention to that fellow’s actions. Once they discover it, we’ll report it to the clan.”

A middle-aged man’s eyes were filled with hatred as he growled in a low voice.

The other person nodded his head heavily and clenched his fists.

“Heart Deer, announce on the universe’s AI that the Battle Pets for sale this time will be on the ocean in front of the silver gazing continent.”

On the surface of the Milky Way, Wang Xian fished three more times with his fishing technique.

The three times he fished were not very good. The strongest one was only a level seven celestial thearch aquatic creature.

Wang Junbao looked at the time and prepared to tame all the aquatic creatures.

The ten thousand red-winged fish had not been completely tamed, nor had they been tamed during the three fishing trips.

It would take about half a month to calculate the time needed to tame them.

It just so happened that after he had successfully tamed them this time, he would sell them directly.

Initially, he was still considering whether to sell them to some disciples of the Divine Willow Daoist sect.

However, when he saw the contents of the exchange zone for the disciples of the Willow deity Daoist sect, he dismissed this idea.

Currently, there were quite a number of people criticizing him in the exchange group.

Looking at this information, he smiled and did not take it to heart.

“Alright, Brother Wang. I will go and inform them now. There are quite a number of people paying attention to our battle pets. It will definitely be very popular.”

Mi Xinlu said excitedly.

Wang Xian nodded with a smile. Then, he tamed these dire beasts.

“HMM?”

Time passed day by day. When there were still five days before two months, he suddenly felt the fluctuations in his surroundings.

He looked towards the back where the dragon eyes of the yin-yang and five elements were staring at.

“The Ice Mountain Race’s divine weapon warship? It is much stronger than the two that I obtained. It seems that the Ice Mountain Domain race wants revenge.”

Wang Xian narrowed his eyes slightly. A cold glint flashed in his eyes.

“What’s wrong, brother Wang?”

At the side, Mi Xin Lu looked over curiously. There was a look of surprise in his eyes.

“The members of the Ice Mountain race. They should be here to seek revenge on me. Hehe, let’s go. Let’s hide for a while!”

Wang Xian smiled gently. He had no time to play with them.

He would talk about it after he tamed and sold his desolate beasts.

Moreover, Wang Xian could sense waves of powerful auras from the battleship.

These auras belonged to a level nine divine emperor. There should be four to five of them.

“It was them who wanted to kill us. That’s why we retaliated. HMPH, we will teach them a lesson sooner or later.”

Mo Xinlu snorted unhappily.

“Hehe, that’s right. We will teach them a lesson sooner or later. Moreover, it won’t take long.”

Wang Xian said faintly.

If it wasn’t for the urgent matter of taming the dire beasts, he would have played with these guys today.

As long as there weren’t any powerhouses at the peak of the divine emperor realm, Wang Xian wouldn’t be afraid at all.

“It’s a pity that the sale of all the war pets this time isn’t enough to allow my strength to achieve a breakthrough.”

He mumbled as the five elements millstone flew rapidly in a certain direction.

This time the resources are not enough, a few more times, it should not be a big problem.
