Translator: 5496903

“There are so many bone scarabs, at least hundreds of thousands of them. Moreover, there are tens of thousands of green heron fire beasts in the sky. We can see a lot of beasts above transcendent rank 6 at a glance!”

“Can we defend it? If we can’t defend it, we’re finished!”

“Right now, the four city gates are all attacked by beasts. We have to defend it. Otherwise, this time, it won’t be like Xilai Town, where 600,000 to 700,000 people will escape. If holy sea town is breached, millions of people will die!”

“I heard that it’s a group of ferocious beasts controlled by the Blood Savage Beast. They are trying to devour our blood to evolve themselves!”

At this moment, at the East Gate, the city wall was filled with countless people. All the experts in holy sea town were gathered at the east gate.

Looking at the dense ferocious beasts coming from thousands of meters ahead, everyone’s faces were filled with shock.

“F * ck, if I had known earlier, I wouldn’t have accepted this mission of Holy Sea Town!”

Some of the mercenary groups that came from East Sea city also frowned when they saw this scene. Their faces were solemn.

There were too many ferocious beasts, and the level of the ferocious beasts was far beyond everyone’s expectations.

Those mercenary groups that accepted the mission had a regretful look on their faces.

“It should be fine. With the experts from the riding wind battle team and the half-step void interpretation deputy commander of the Ocean Legion, defending the city shouldn’t be a problem!”

Some people comforted themselves in their hearts

“F * ck, Commander Wang actually left. If commander Wang and his subordinates stayed behind, it would definitely be a powerful fighting force!”

“Yeah, just now, commander Wang exploded out with the strength of a rank 9 transcendent and directly resisted deputy commander Meng’s attack. His strength was extremely terrifying. If there was a Commander Wang, the strength of defending the city would increase by a lot!”

“I really didn’t expect that the ocean cultivator corps would do such a thing for their own selfish desires!”

“F * ck! Commander Wang Is Here to help our holy sea town. Moreover, he seems to be a member of our holy sea town. Now, he wants to escape!”

At a place on the city wall, more than ten experts of holy sea town said angrily.

“What’s going on? What happened? Who’s commander Wang?”

The other people on the city wall heard their conversation and asked curiously.

Without hesitation, the experts of Saint Sea Town told them everything.

“F * ck, he’s so F * cking arrogant. After killing four people, he still dares to threaten the commander. In the end, he even asked the deputy commander of the Ocean Corps to take revenge for him!”

“This is too shameless. I didn’t expect the ocean corps to do such a thing!”

“F * ck, Commander Wang killed well. This arrogant guy should be killed. However, this ocean corps is really not human!”

“Shh, Keep Your Voice Down. The people of the Ocean Corps are still down there!”

The people were talking indignantly. Soon, the news spread around. Soon, most people learned about this matter.

At this moment, some students of the three academies on the city wall were very dissatisfied with the actions of the ocean cultivator army.

Even the students of the Ocean Academy began to waver in their faith.

Would they join such an army in the future?

However, no one dared to speak loudly, for fear of being heard by the ocean cultivator army outside the city wall. After all, they were still needed to defend the city.

At the West Gate, the South Gate, and the north gate, news of this matter spread, and many people’s faces were filled with anger.

Facing such an arrogant rich second generation, no one didn’t hate them. At the same time, the ocean cultivators, who had helped the enemy, were also condemned by them.

“Everyone, concentrate and prepare to face the enemy. Behind Us is our home. If we lose, our children and our families will become the food of the fierce beasts. We must defend holy sea town and Fight!”

At the North Gate, the President of the hiring association looked at the densely packed ferocious beasts and shouted loudly.

Everyone immediately stopped their condemnation and looked forward. Their eyes were filled with nervousness and determination.

“The mayor is here!”

At this moment, the voice of a city guard came from behind.

Wang Xian, Jin Qianyuan and the rest flew directly to the position of the President of the hiring association.

“Eh? It’s commander Wang!”

“It’s commander Wang. Why is Commander Wang Here? Isn’t he?”

“What? He’s the Commander Wang that you guys are talking about?”

The position of the north gate was filled with people from Shenghai town and Xilai town who had fled here. When they saw Jin Qianyuan and Wang Xian arriving, their eyes landed on Wang Xian and they revealed a look of surprise.

“Commander Wang, you...”

The President of the hiring association looked at Wang Xian and spoke with some respect. He then looked at Jin Qianyuan.

“Commander Wang is a member of Shenghai Town and is willing to fight for Shenghai town. If there are any other situations, commander Wang will leave immediately. Everyone, pay attention!”

“Commander Wang is an expert at transcendent level nine and his 11 subordinates are also at transcendent level eight. With his help, we will definitely be able to defend our home!”

Jin Qianyuan said with a hidden meaning.

“Thank you, Commander Wang!”

“Thank you, thank you very much!”

On the city wall, everyone looked at Wang Xian with a face full of gratitude as they spoke loudly.

Wang Xian was slightly ashamed. He came to Shenghai town for a large number of ferocious beast corpses. He didn’t expect them to thank him so much.

He felt slightly ashamed!

He looked at the front of the city wall. All the people of Shenghai Town were standing behind the city wall. They were looking at the battle with pleading faces.

The 1.7 to 800,000 people in the city walked out and stood there silently.

It was a life-and-death Battle! Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Listen to my command. I, Wang Xian, will guard the north gate. It will not be broken!”

“Those who are good at close combat, follow me out of the city to kill the enemy. Those who are good at supporting, stand below the city wall. Those who are good at long-range attacks, stand on the city wall!”

Wang Xian moved his body and flew into the sky outside. He shouted softly.

Eleven Golden Swordfish immediately stood by his side and looked at the ferocious beast race that was slowly approaching.

“Yes!”

The president of the hiring association shouted with excitement, “Follow the king’s command and charge. Defend Our Holy Sea Town!”

“Kill! I’m Invincible!”

“Follow the king’s command!”

Behind him, many warriors who were at least at transcendent level three flew out of the city. They stood on the ground and shouted loudly.

Wang Xian revealed a smile on his face as he looked ahead. His eyes sparkled with a strange luster.

“The first wave of ferocious beasts, wood-attributed ferocious beasts. Their weakness lies in the purple spots at the bottom of their necks!”

Wang Xian looked over and immediately saw the weakness of the wood-attributed ferocious beasts. he shouted loudly, “Get Ready, Fight!”

“Yes!”

It wasn’t just the five species of ferocious beasts that attacked Shenghai town. There were about ten of them, which was far beyond Shenghai town’s expectations.

The wood devil was a type of wood-type ferocious beast that didn’t belong to the aquatic species. More than 100,000 wood devils were rushing towards Shenghai town with loud noises!
