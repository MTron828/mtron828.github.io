Chapter 190: I’m Wang Xian (4)

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

“I’m Wang Xian!”

It was just three short and ordinary words but they exhibited endless confidence.

“Wang Xian? Where did this brat come from? How dare he spout nonsense here? Is he courting his own death?”

At this moment, before the Liu Family responded, a burly man among the Liu Family’s guests stood up and shouted emotionlessly at Wang Xian.

“That’s right. How dare you spout nonsense in Young Master Liu’s engagement ceremony! You must be too eager to die!”

“I have not heard of Wang Xian. However, I’ll probably be attending your memorial service the same day next year!”

“What an arrogant brat to kick up a fuss in Liu Family’s engagement ceremony. You must be tired of living!”

After that burly middle-aged man stood up to reprimand Wang Xian, other ancient martial artists stood up one after another and stared coldly at Wang Xian.

Some of the ancient martial artists emitted strong auras directly as they threw their gazes filled with killing intent at Wang Xian.

In an instant, everyone’s attention had fallen onto Wang Xian.

Without having to take actions or say a single word, there was already a group of guests who were willing to stand up for the Liu Family.

In fact, if it wasn’t a joyous event today, they would have taken actions directly to get on the good books of the Liu Family.

“Xiao Xian... Why are you here? Get away quickly!”

Lan Qingyue was shocked to see Wang Xian. After hearing the threats of the crowd while still being in shock, her face turned pale and she blurted out.

She knew that Wang Xian was incredible. However, the other party was the Liu Family, who was one of the top forces in Hailing Province!

Lan Qingyue’s body was shivering a little and her eyes were filled with horror.

Huh?

When the crowd heard Lan Qingyue, they were stunned.

This... What does this mean?

When the female party of the engagement ceremony said those words, the meaning behind it would be great.

Is Wang Xian the old flame of Lan Qingyue?

Or perhaps he was her secret lover.

A bright green grass field slowly appeared over Liu Feiyun’s head. [1]

You couldn’t really blame them for reading too much into this. With the development of the situation, it wasn’t hard for them to reach this conclusion.

In fact, those with a wilder imagination already had a few versions in their minds.

The young missy of the Lan Family is forced to marry the Liu Family. The lover of the young missy appears to snatch the bride!

The young missy of the Lan Family has an affair with a poor kid. Little Sword Celestial of the Liu Family is made a cuckold!

Wait wait wait wait!

“Lan Qingyue!”

Liu Feiyun saw the expression of Lan Qingyue and heard her words. His expression was savage and he was clenching his fist tightly.

Under such circumstances and during his engagement ceremony...

For her fiancée to be involved in a scandal with another man, this was the utmost humiliation to him.

How could he possibly face the public in the future as the Little Sword Celestial of the Tyrannical Sword!

Bam!

“Preposterous! Preposterous!”

At this moment, at the table of the host, the white-bearded old man slammed his hand heavily on the table with a solemn expression.

All the cups on the table were knocked over.

The old man from Lan Family beside him looked extremely pale. The other members of the Lan Family were also as white as a sheet. Some even stared at Wang Xian and Lan Qingyue angrily.

The burly middle-aged man from before saw how furious Old Liu was. He stood up and immediately remarked, “Old Liu, leave this to us. We can handle it!”

“Yeah, Old Liu. Just leave this brat to us!”

Those Ancient Martial Arts Families and Sects who wished to get on the good side of the Liu Family stood up one after another and requested Old Liu to let them help.

“Drag him out!”

Old Liu didn’t say a word but the middle-aged man beside him did.

“Yes!”

Instantly, over ten people nodded their heads. They were from different families and sects. They stood up and stared harshly at Wang Xian before walking towards him.

“Brat, you are courting your own death!”

The burly middle-aged man stared coldly at Wang Xian with killing intent.

“Xiao Xian!”

Seeing this, Lan Qingyue’s complexion turned even paler. A teardrop streamed down her cheek.

Wang Xian looked at the dozen people walking towards him and revealed a mocking smile.

He stood up gradually.

Rattle rattle!

At this moment, sounds of tables and chairs scraping the floor sounded.

To the astonishment of the Lan Family, the Liu Family and the guests, all the Ancient Martial Artist Families and wealthy men from Rivertown and the members of the Thistles and Thorns Sect together with Sect Leader Tang stood up.

They stared coldly at the dozen people walking towards Wang Xian.

The atmosphere dropped below freezing point in an instant. Everyone from the Lan Family looked at this scene with disbelief.

All the major families, Ancient Martial Artist Families from Rivertown and the members of the Thistles and Thorns Sect had all stood up with the young man.

They were shocked by the development. The Lan Family had initially thought that they were only here to show goodwill because of the political marriage with the Liu Family.

They thought that the Thistles and Thorns Sect, Old Qin and the wealthy men from Rivertown were only here in hopes of getting to know the Liu Family.

However, they realized that they were completely wrong. They weren’t here because they wanted to show goodwill to them for the political marriage with the Liu Family.

And they weren’t there because they were wary of the Liu Family.

They were here for that young man!

The dozen martial artists walking towards Wang Xian were stunned. They looked at the Rivertown crowd in shock as their expressions turned solemn.

Just a while ago, they were still commenting that the Ancient Martial Artist Families of Rivertown and Sects from the Southern Province were only here because of the Liu Family.

At this moment, those were just their wishful thoughts. They were here to get on the good books of the Liu Family? Nope, they were here to go against the Liu Family!

“Haha! Great, great!”

The middle-aged man beside the white-bearded old man looked hideous as he saw the crowd stand up.

He stood up gradually and fixed his eyes on Wang Xian. “Brat, I think I know who you are. To have such a huge influence in Rivertown and to be so young, you must be Miracle Doctor Wang who ranks eighteenth on the Miracle Doctors Chart. Not bad! You are pretty good, brat!”

“However, you choose to not enjoy your bright future and instead offend our Liu Family. Do you think this trash from Rivertown is sufficient to challenge our Liu Family?”

The middle-aged man shouted out the last sentence.

Rattle rattle!

As the middle-aged man completed his sentence, the guests of the Liu Family stood up immediately.

In terms of number, they weren’t inferior to the people of Rivertown. When it came to strength, they were much stronger than the crowd from Rivertown.

Among the guests of the Liu Family, there were three to four Second-class Forces.

On the other hand, only Thistles and Thorns Sect was a Second-class Force on the Rivertown side.

“Just a small Rivertown and yet you dare to challenge the Liu Family. You guys don’t know where you stand! The Liu Family doesn’t even need to take actions and we can easily annihilate you guys!”

“Haha, interesting! A small Rivertown that doesn’t even have a Second-class Force and the Southern Province which doesn’t even have a First-class Force are thinking of challenging us and the Liu Family. They must be really eager to seek their own death!”

“I’ll give you guys a chance right now. Cripple that brat and throw him over. Otherwise, we will annihilate the entire Rivertown!”

The guests of the Liu Family looked down on the group behind Wang Xian.

If it was just the forces of Rivertown, they weren’t wary at all. In fact, even if they included the Southern Province, they weren’t afraid if they included the Liu Family too.

“I’m sorry that I’m late!”

At this moment, a nonchalant voice sounded in the ears of everyone. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com
