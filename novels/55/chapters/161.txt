Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

Wang Xian made four to five consecutive phone calls. After which, he smiled satisfactorily.

Every single one of them had promised to be here on time.

What just happened to Miao Zhiyong was also happening to several wealthy and influential people in Rivertown.

They were all people who had the abilities to directly or indirectly affect the Wei Family’s medical equipment company. In fact, if two or three of them were to join hands to mess with the Wei Family, they would be able to force the Wei Family to declare bankruptcy.

Wei Family’s influence in Rivertown was still above average and had assets of $700-800 million. However, it had a weakness, and that was poor connections and background.

“Let’s go to bed!”

After settling all the matters, Wang Xian got on the bed and fell asleep.

The next morning, Wang Xian and Xiao Yu headed over to Uncle Zhang’s house for breakfast.

There were already quite a few people who had gathered there in the morning and were chatting.

“Xiao Xian, when will the wedding cars that you got be coming? I shouldn’t have troubled you with this. If I had known that you were getting the wedding cars from Rivertown, I wouldn’t have asked you to.”

Uncle Zhang sat beside Wang Xian and spoke while drinking Pu’er tea.

“It’s fine, Uncle Zhang. I’ve asked them to be here by 9 am. We will reach Rivertown by 11 and just in time!”

Wang Xian smiled.

“9 am? It’s almost time!” Uncle Zhang nodded his head.

“Xiao Xian is a really great kid and knows about returning kindness. He has settled everything for you. Old Zhang, you don’t have to worry!” an old man beside Uncle Zhang commented.

“Yeah, I’m really lucky.”

Uncle Zhang smiled.

“Look! There are quite a number of cars heading our way!”

At this moment, a middle-aged man standing by the side saw the situation on the road. He was shocked by what he saw.

“The wedding cars are here?”

The rest of the crowd looked over inquisitively.

At this moment, Wang Xian received a message on his phone. He stood up, smiled and said, “They are here. Once Sister Li is ready, we can go set off right away!”

“Let’s go, let’s go!”

Uncle Zhang nodded his head and looked towards the wedding cars lined up from afar. He revealed a smile and went to the room to call Aunt Zhang and Sister Li immediately.

Sister Li changed into her wedding gown. She had exquisite makeup on and looked extremely beautiful.

“What the... What are these cars? They are simply stunning!”

“There are even sports cars. Oh my gosh! There are at least fifty to sixty cars in this line-up!”

“These cars are simply stunning!”

“Wow. Look at the car plates. Look at those car plates...”

When Uncle Zhang and his family member walked out, they immediately heard the exclamations of the crowd.

They looked over and were surprised to see 50-60 wedding cars.

The one leading the line-up was a luxurious Rolls-Royce Phantom that cost over $10 million. Behind it were nine other Rolls-Royces.

Behind the Rolls-Royces, there were 10 Bentleys.

Moving further back, there were Lamborghini Aventadors, Ferrari sports cars, Maseratis and many others.

At the very end, six land rovers concluded the line-up of 50-60 wedding cars.

Seeing such a luxurious wedding car line-up, Sister Li’s jaw dropped in astonishment.

However, what truly shocked her were the car plates of these cars.

The Southern Province cars started with “S.” Cars from Rivertown would start with “SB”.

The car plate number of the first Rolls-Royce was SB11111.

The car plate number for the second Rolls-Royce was SB22222.

Moving back, she even saw car plates like SB88888 and SB12345.

Due to the influence of her finance, she knew a little about the significance of car plate numbers.

An ordinary man would never be able to get numbers like SB11111, 22222, 88888.

Those who owned these car plates were undoubtedly the filthy rich and influential people of Rivertown.

“This... How did Xiao Xian get these luxury cars?” Sister Li was shocked.

“Young Master Wang, the wedding cars are here. Are you satisfied with these?”

At this moment, Ren Anzhi alighted from a car at the back and ran towards Wang Xian. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Wang Xian had asked the Ren Family to help him find some wedding cars and the Ren Family Head had decided to let his son bring them over.

“Great. I have troubled you guys!” Wang Xian nodded his head and smiled.

“Not at all, not at all.” Ren Anzhi waved his hand in response.

“Alright, let’s go then!”

Wang Xian looked at Sister Li and Uncle Zhang.

“Let’s go, let’s go. Xiao Xian, this line up is a little too extravagant!”

Uncle Zhang sighed emotionally.

Wang Xian simply smiled in response. He got onto Xiao Yu’s car and the crowd headed towards Rivertown.

Summer Sun International Hotel was one of the only three five-star hotels in Rivertown. Due to its connection with the Xue Family, the Summer Sun International Hotel also had the best business.

Today, the son of Wei Qingguo, Wei Zhiwen, would be having his wedding in the Summer Sun International Hotel.

The Wei Family could also be considered as a respectable family in Rivertown. Therefore, the wedding of the future successor to the Wei Family was done in a grandiose manner.

“What? The bride’s party is sending their daughter over with the wedding cars that they sourced themselves?”

Within a luxurious room of the hotel, a middle-aged woman looked bitter as she questioned the young man.

“Yes, mom. Isn’t that great? She didn’t have to come from the hotel. Once she arrives, we can start the wedding ceremony!” the young man explained.

“Great? How can this be great? Isn’t that embarrassing? Her family will probably get cars that cost several hundred thousand as wedding cars. When they arrive at the hotel lobby, tthey will embarrass us. NO WAY! This won’t do!”

The middle-aged woman spoke with a hideous look.

They could choose to not go to the bride’s house, but their son’s wedding had to be luxurious in Rivertown.

“Tell me, Qingxiu is such a fine lady! Her family background isn’t any inferior to ours. Furthermore, she just returned from her overseas studies. YOU...!”

The middle-aged woman pointed at the young man and remarked angrily.

“Alright, alright. Now that they are getting married, let’s not talk about these scenarios. Just get someone to escort her to the eighth floor when she arrives,” Wei Qingguo interrupted.

“Dad, aren’t we going to receive them at the lobby?” the young man said bitterly. He was none other than Wei Zhiwen.

“Doesn’t she have legs? Is she handicapped? After this wedding, if her parents aren’t satisfied, get them to look for a better family,” the middle-aged woman commented grumpily.

“Mom, how can you say that? Xiao Li is my wife and your daughter-in-law.” Upon hearing his mom’s comment, Wei Zhiwen wasn’t pleased.

“Alright, mom shall not speak of her in such a manner. I’ll try to manage our relationship in the future!” the middle-aged woman replied. She still loved her son deeply.

Mm. Wei Zhiwen nodded his head with satisfaction.

At this moment, the middle-aged man added, “We are not going to receive them. Just get Xiao Li to come up directly!”

Wei Zhiwen revealed a bitter look. After giving some thought to it, he finally nodded. “In that case, I’ll let Xiao Li know!”

“Sigh. It would be great if you married a girl like Qingxiu. If our families worked together, our business would reach new heights. Why did you choose a girl from a village? Sigh!”

When the middle-aged woman saw her son leave, she sighed emotionally.

“What else can we do? This child is determined to marry her. He even made her pregnant.”

“Tsk. It’s entirely the village girl’s fault!”
