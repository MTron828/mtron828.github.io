3292 With the determination of the righteous God race

Dragon King of the Dragon Palace!

The Dragon King of the Dragon Palace who had defeated the Devil Dragon bloodline and the Fire Dragon Palace.

Not long ago, all the forces in the surrounding starry sky were paying attention to the war and killing of the Divine Dragon Bloodline.

The Righteous God race also paid attention to this.

However, they didn’t take it seriously.

At that time, the righteous God race was already preparing to disembark. Moreover, in their eyes, the divine dragon lineage was just relying on the Dragon Palace. Without the Dragon Palace, they would be nothing more than this.

However, the Dragon King’s strength had actually reached the combat strength of a universe knight level seven. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

This was a universe knight level seven!

In their righteous god race, only two ancestors had such strength.

“You want to exterminate our righteous God Race?”

When the experts of the righteous god race heard Wang Xian’s words, their faces turned extremely gloomy.

“Ancestor, let’s go and exterminate that arrogant Dragon King.”

An expert of the righteous god race could not help but growl in a low voice.

Their eyes were fixed on the Dragon King who was wreaking havoc on the continent in front of them. Their faces were filled with fury.

Their Righteous God race had been invincible in the surrounding starry sky for over a hundred million years.

For hundreds of millions of years, no one had dared to be arrogant with them, and no one had dared to say that they wanted to be destroyed.

Now they wanted to be destroyed?

A ghastly look appeared on everyone’s faces.

“If you want to make a move, then completely destroy the Dragon King.”

The two ancestors of the Central Righteous God race also had murderous looks on their faces.

How long had it been? How long had it been since someone dared to provoke their righteous god race like this.

“Elder ancestor, we still have five days before the battle to land. If there is a conflict with the Dragon Palace, then the battle to land…”

The Patriarch of the Righteous God race said with an ugly expression.

Now, they had no way out.

If they started a conflict with the dragon palace at this time, then the battle to land would definitely be affected. They might even be attacked by the Dragon Palace during the battle.

However, if they gave up on the landing battle because of their unilateral violation of the rules, they wouldn’t be able to land for another 100 million years.

Either way, it would be a huge loss for them.

“At this time, the Dragon Palace is already on top of us. Why should we be afraid of them? “At most, we can wait for another 100 million years. The Dragon Palace now has several dragon palaces. If we can destroy them, our gains might not be less than in the heaven opening desolate continent!”

“That’s right. Destroy the Dragon Palace. Although the Dragon Palace of the Divine Dragon clan is powerful, I don’t believe that we can’t destroy it.”

Several hot-tempered elders roared angrily.

“Okay, let’s give up and destroy the Dragon Palace!”

The two ancestors of the righteous god race gritted their teeth and growled in a low voice.

Their eyes were a bit red.

This decision was a great loss to their righteous God race. There was only one way to make up for it, and that was to destroy the Dragon Palace. As long as they could get those dragon palaces, they could make up for all the losses.

However, they had no other choice. They didn’t dare to continue the land battle. If the Dragon Palace attacked them from behind, they couldn’t bear the consequences.

“Contact the ancient sea race and tell them to prepare. We’ll attack the Dragon Palace Now!”

A patriarch of the Righteous God race ordered.

“Patriarch, should we attack the Dragon King and let him know the consequences of offending us?”

An old man growled.

“No need, there’s no need to waste time. Just kill the Dragon Palace and he’ll come back.”

“I want to kill the entire Dragon Palace!”

An old man of the Righteous God race shook his head and growled.

With their strength, it would be difficult to keep a universe knight Level 7 great being.

Unless the army of the righteous God race surrounded him, otherwise, it would be difficult to kill the Dragon King.

They only needed to kill their way to the Dragon Palace. The entire dragon slaying palace would make up for their losses.

“Let’s go. We’ll disturb our landing. This time, we must destroy the Dragon Palace.”

The experts of the Righteous God race roared with killing intent on their faces. They turned around and flew toward the army of the Righteous God race.

“Boom!”

At this moment, a loud sound came from below the auction of the ancient sea race.

The Five Elements Millstone landed on the ground. Everyone below was instantly killed.

Wang Xian glanced at the void not far away. When he saw the more than twenty rays of golden light disappearing, he raised his eyebrows slightly.

He did not pay attention to it. For this matter, the righteous God race had to give him a satisfactory answer. Otherwise, they would start a war.

Now that they were in the midst of a land battle, they could not escape.

Buzz

His gaze locked onto a figure in front of him. The next moment, his body moved and he immediately flew over.

“No, no, no, don’t kill me!”

The Universe Knight of the ancient sea race shouted in horror when he saw Wang Xian flying towards him.

Buzz

A demonic look appeared in his eyes as he directly performed soul capture.

Waves of information were transmitted into his mind.

There were many treasures on the ancient sea race’s continent. Wang Xian was prepared to get his hands on these treasures first before dealing with other matters.

After some information entered his mind, he moved his body and flew towards the lower part of the auction venue.

There was a cave entrance at the lower part of the venue. This was the ancient sea race’s auction venue’s treasure vault.

All the treasures were hidden here.

This continent had a knight level 6 warrior and a space beast guarding it, they weren’t afraid of anyone coming to snatch it.

“This, this, this… Dragon King, he’s actually the Dragon King, this Dragon King is simply too strong!”

“I didn’t expect him to be the Dragon King, no wonder the Devil Dragon Bloodline Fire Dragon Palace Saint Wen clan and the others were wiped out, not a single one was left, so the Dragon King’s strength was actually so terrifying!”

“The ancient sea race is in big trouble now. They dare to bully the Dragon King. They might be wiped out!”

“They want to bully the Dragon King and take advantage of him. TSK TSK, now the entire ancient sea race’s continent belongs to the Dragon King.”

In the sky, the experts looked down with mockery on their faces.

The ancient sea race had really gone too far this time.

At the same time, what happened in the ancient sea race continent attracted the attention of many people in the surrounding starry skies.

A large number of people had gathered in the nearby starry skies.

When they saw what happened here, their faces were filled with shock and astonishment.

“Look over there. Look, the army of the Righteous God race is actually flying backwards. What’s going on?”

At this moment, a shocked voice was heard.

“Eh?”

Everyone around was slightly shocked.

The entire army of the Righteous God race was moving towards the rear.

They were very fast.

The sudden scene stunned everyone.

What was going on?

The Heaven opening primal continent was in front of them. Why were they suddenly moving towards the rear?

“What is the righteous God race doing?”

Everyone was confused. They didn’t know what the Righteous God race was trying to do.

At this moment, dozens of space beasts were roaming in the void in a space zone.

This was the nest of the ancient sea race.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh

At this moment, countless experts were flying toward a planet of the ancient sea race.

The Great War is coming!
