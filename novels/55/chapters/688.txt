“Dragon King, Look over there!”

Prime Minister GUI pointed to the front.

Wang Xian looked ahead and his expression changed. He moved and appeared directly in the Dragon Field.

He looked at Tang Yinxuan who was surrounded by a type of dolphin and a hint of surprise flashed across his eyes.

Wang Xian walked slowly towards her and came in front of her. He looked at the position of Tang Yinxuan’s chest.

At this moment, the injuries there had completely disappeared. Her entire body was emitting a pink glow.

She was lying there like a young girl with a pink element, making her look exceptionally attractive.

“What’s going on? She clearly...”

Wang Xian’s eyes were sparkling as he stared at the Dolphins around him. He was full of smiles. “It’s good that she’s not dead. It’s good that she’s not dead. You saved Our Lives!”

Wang Xian heaved a heavy sigh of relief and walked towards her slowly.

When the Dolphins saw Wang Xian walking over, they took the initiative to open a path for him.

Wang Xian walked to Tang Yinxuan’s side and looked at her body. He reached out his hand and couldn’t help but touch her face. A smile appeared on his face.

“I knew it. I knew he was a scumbag. A pervert!”

In the Dragon King’s bedroom, five girls were standing on the stage and looking at the Dragon Field. Lan qingyue couldn’t help but Snort coldly when she saw this scene.

Sun Lingxiu smiled faintly. “Speaking of which, Tang Yinxuan can be considered to have saved our lives!”

“Sigh!”

A Jiaya sighed and shook her head.

Xiao Yu stuck out his tongue. “In the past, I decided to find a boyfriend only like my brother. In the future, I will definitely not find someone like him.”

“If I want to find someone, I must find someone who can’t beat me. That way, he won’t bully me and will do whatever I Want!”

As she said this, a figure suddenly appeared in her mind and she couldn’t help but smile.

“Xiao Yu, looking at how happy you are, do you have someone in mind?”

Lan qingyue saw Xiao Yu’s somewhat familiar smile and sized her up from head to toe. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“How... how is this possible!”

Xiao Yu was stunned and quickly shook his head.

“Really? Why do I feel like you have someone in your heart!”

Lan Qingyue said with a smile.

“How is this possible? I haven’t met my Prince Charming yet. Impossible, this is impossible!”

Xiao Yu shook his head hard and firmly denied it.

“Xiao Yu, you’re already 21 years old. You can find a boyfriend now!”

“AH, sister-in-law, you should take good care of my brother now. It’s not good to have too many sister-in-law. You guys are enough!”

“You Little Girl!”

...

“Create a dragon cave for her by the side. Let Her stay in the Dragon Cave and wait for her to recover!”

Wang Xian turned around slowly and said to Prime Minister Gui.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Prime Minister Gui nodded his head.

“Also, call Ao Jian, Ao Qitian, and the strange demon clan over!”

Wang Xian’s eyes flickered as he spoke again.

“Dragon King, are you going to... ?”

Prime Minister Gui hesitated for a moment before asking.

“I’m going to kill my way into that world!”

Wang Xian’s eyes were cold as he spoke. His eyes were filled with killing intent.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Prime Minister Gui felt a chill in his heart. He immediately nodded his head and walked out.

“The ancestral tree has acknowledged me as its master. In the future, I will have the insane ability to resurrect endlessly. However, resurrecting requires a huge amount of energy to reconstruct my physical body. The stronger I am, the more Dragon Blood I will need to resurrect. In the future, it will be extremely difficult to resurrect me. I might not even be able to support myself to resurrect!”

“This time, even if the two demonic middle-aged men wanted to defeat us, it would be difficult for them to kill us!”

“Every nine cauldrons world will have rich resources. There, I will make use of the resources in that world to elevate ao Yao to the Immortal God realm. When that happens, I will turn the Nine Cauldrons World Upside Down.”

Wang Xian was a person who would always seek revenge for his flaws. When the two demonic middle-aged men ambushed them, both parties were already at a stalemate.

That Wang Xian would not wait for them to come to him. Instead, he would go to the nine cauldrons world to look for them.

He would fight his way into the Nine Cauldrons World!

He would fight to nourish the battle and kill to stop the killing!

“Today, my yellow cauldrons world has appeared. Citizens of the real world, please enlighten me. hahaha!”

“Today, Our Yellow Heaven Immortal sect has appeared. Please enlighten us!”

“Today, our Hunyuan Immortal sect has appeared. We are the only Hunyuan in the world!”

“Today, our upper nine immortal sects have appeared. All the talented people in the world can join our immortal sect!”

At this moment, weak voices entered his ears. Wang Xian was stunned and a look of shock appeared in his eyes.

His body moved and appeared in the sky above the Dragon Palace. He looked in the direction of Huaxia.

“Today, the celestial sect of the Yellow Cauldron world has appeared. The celestial sect of Huaxia has reappeared in the world. All the sects have worshiped and all the Outsiders have submitted!”

The overlapping voices of five to six celestials were heard. This voice had spread across more than the entire Huaxia.

“Phew!”

Wang Xian took a deep breath. His eyes were filled with shock.

“The Nine Cauldrons World has appeared!”

“The Yellow Cauldrons world has appeared!”

The Yellow Cauldrons world had appeared in a high-profile manner. The Immortal Gods had used their mighty power to announce their arrival to the world.

One could imagine that Huaxia and even the entire world had undergone a drastic change because of the appearance of the Nine Cauldrons World.

Ancient martial arts would no longer be an ancient martial art but a martial art. It was very likely that more people would come into contact with martial arts and become martial artists.

And one by one, the immortal sects would control the entire martial arts world!

“This is the immortal sect!”

Wang Xian was amazed by the announcement of these few immortal deity statues.

One day, he would also announce the Dragon Palace like this!

“Dragon King!”

“Dragon King!”

At this moment, Prime Minister Gui, Ao Jian, AO qitian, and a group of strange demons came to his side and greeted him respectfully.

“Yes!”

Wang Xian nodded his head. “The Golden Age has already begun. We have to increase our strength as soon as possible!”

His eyes flickered as he turned his head and looked in the direction of the spiritual energy waterfall. “Let’s charge into the Nine Cauldrons World!”

“Dragon King, are we going to take revenge?”

Ao Qitian clenched his fists tightly and said with a ferocious expression.

“That’s right. Let’s go find them!”

Wang Xian nodded his head with a cold gaze. His gaze swept across the members of the Dragon Palace in front of him.

“Prime Minister Gui, you will guard the Dragon Palace. Ao Qitian, Ao Jian, and the Strange Demon Clan Will Follow Me!”

There were three immortals, fifteen nascent realm experts, and more than 130 dan realm experts.

This was an extremely terrifying force, especially for the strange demon clan. Their assassination techniques were extremely terrifying.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Prime Minister Gui and the rest responded loudly immediately.

“Get Ready. We’ll head over Tomorrow!”

Wang Xian said to them. With a flash, he arrived at the bedroom in the Dragon Palace.

“Xiao Xian!”

Seeing Wang Xian enter, Lan Qingyue and the rest immediately walked over.

“I’m preparing to go to that World Tomorrow!”

Wang Xian said to them.

“What?”

The five girls were stunned as they looked at him in astonishment.

“The Yellow Cauldron has already appeared in the world. We have to take revenge this time. Don’t worry, I’m the owner of the ancestral tree and the soul-returning tree. As long as I have the resources to revive, I can revive indefinitely!”

Wang Xian assured them!
