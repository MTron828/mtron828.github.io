Chapter 1570: Title 1570: under the sage

“Thank you for this heart of darkness. If there is anyone who can use my Wu Qing city in the future, I will not decline!”

Wu Qing city continued to speak and bowed heavily to Wang Xian once again.

Two sounds of gratitude and two bows. Wu Qing city’s face was filled with respect and gratitude.

However, at this moment, everyone around was staring at this scene in shock.

When Wang Xian was shrouded in light, no one could see what was happening inside.

All they heard was a majestic roar and a roar. In less than ten seconds, the crown prince of Wu Qing City had recovered?

This speed was no different from healing some minor injuries.

“Qing Cheng, you... you have completely recovered?”

Patriarch Dark Eye had a look of disbelief on his face. He moved and appeared beside Wu Qing Cheng.

“Patriarch, you’re worried. I feel like I’ve completely recovered!”

Wu Qing Cheng looked at the patriarch in front of him and smiled. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

After being invaded by the darkness, he could still sense the outside world.

He could see every move of the outside world clearly.

“Haha, Good, good. Qing Cheng is lucky!”

Dark pupil put his arm on Wu Qingcheng’s shoulder to sense. When he found that the darkness soul had been removed, he was excited.

He patted Wu Qingcheng’s shoulder heavily and laughed.

“Haha, it’s good that Qing Cheng is fine. It’s good that he is fine!”

“Brother! Brother!”

The elder holding the dark staff ran over with Wu Qingyan and the rest. Their faces were also filled with excitement.

“Cough cough, he managed to expel the Soul of darkness at the seventh level of the Seethrough realm so quickly. This is... this is unbelievable!”

“He actually managed to do it. Doesn’t that mean that this priest Wang is even stronger than the forefather of the morning light?”

Around them, the priests of light were staring at Wang Xian with a complicated look on their faces as they gulped.

“That’s impossible. His strength is only at level seven of the Seethrough Void Tier. How... how could it be?”

Patriarch of dawn light looked at Wang Xian in a daze as his expression kept changing.

“Thank you, priest Wang. I really didn’t expect you to have such a powerful ability at such a young age!”

Patriarch dark pupil was in a good mood as he said to Wang Xian.

“Hehe!”

Wang Xian smiled faintly and didn’t say anything.

“Pastor Wang has given me a black veil heart fruit. I reckon that I will be able to achieve a breakthrough soon!”

Wu Qing Cheng looked at Wang Xian and said with a smile.

Other than gratitude towards Wang Xian, there was also a hint of admitting defeat in his heart!

Such a person was really not someone he could compare to.

“Pastor Wang, the three level eight light pearls and the ten level seven light pearls that you require will be delivered by our Wuji Empire within three days. We will not go back on our words!”

Patriarch Dark Eye said to Wang Xian, “Furthermore, pastor Wang has saved the life of the Crown Prince of our Wuji Empire. Our Wuji Empire will not be stingy. Today...”

As he spoke, his gaze turned to all the pastors of light in front of him. “Today, our Wuji Empire will confer the title of Saint of light to pastor Wang Xian!”

“All the families of our empire, those with cultivation levels below the eighth rank of the void interpretation realm, will bow and treat you with respect!”

The last two sentences of patriarch dark eye’s voice resounded throughout the ruins of the divine kingdom.

When the surrounding radiant priests heard Patriarch Dark Eye’s announcement, their bodies trembled and their eyes widened.

Saint of Light, confer the title of Saint!

This was the first time among all the radiant priests to be conferred the title of Saint by Wuji Empire. Furthermore, it was the title of Saint.

Especially in Wuji Empire, all the powerhouses below level eight of the Seethrough void tier had to bow and treat them with respect.

This represented a position, an extremely high position.

Even in the royal family of Wuji Empire, many people had to address him as the saint.

Glory, Great Glory!

“Cough cough, cough cough!”

When the forefather of dawn light heard these words, he coughed violently twice and looked at Wang Xian with jealousy in his eyes.

The Sage of light, the title conferred by the forefather of Wuji Empire. This title was equivalent to the strongest among the radiant priests.

This made the elder of Dawn Light, who was standing at the peak of the radiant priests, feel extremely uncomfortable.

It was no exaggeration to say that just the title of the Sage of light was enough to make him one of the top forces in the vast region.

Among the Wuji Empire and all the first-rate forces, he was considered a guest of honor.

When Wang Xian heard the title conferred by the Wuji Empire, he smiled nonchalantly.

Compared to this title, those pearls of light were what he wanted the most.

As long as he obtained those pearls of light, he would be able to completely fuse the heart of Light and darkness.

“However, this title is also very useful!”

Wang Xian scanned his surroundings and noticed that all the priests of light were filled with shock and awe. The corners of his mouth curled up slightly.

This title represented that he stood at the peak of the priests of light and looked down on all the priests of light.

“Senior, the radiant pearl will be delivered to the holy medicine clinic in three days. I will go there to retrieve it!”

Wang Xian said to Patriarch of dark eye.

Patriarch of dark eye nodded.

Wang Xian smiled and walked towards the location of the Bingxin Empire.

“Sir Sage!”

He walked forward. Everyone around him quickly made way for him. Some of the priests shouted in a low voice.

When he passed by the people from the Divine Light Empire, he paused for a moment and looked at the Chenguang Patriarch and Tian Qingguang.

“Sir Sage!”

A few radiant priests who were at level seven and level six of the Seethrough realm quickly bowed and shouted with an embarrassed expression.

Tian Qingguang clenched his fists. His eyes were filled with helplessness as he shouted as well.

“Now, I have the right to call you trash!”

Wang Xian took a glance at Tian Qingguang and forefather Chenguang before walking straight over.

“I admit defeat, I admit defeat!”

Forefather Chenguang’s face was dark and filled with helplessness.

He had stood at the peak of his life. He did not expect to be knocked off his pedestal today.

In the future, everyone in the world would know that the saint of light was number one.

“HMM? That saint of Light is walking towards us again!”

At the location of the Bingxin Empire, when everyone saw Wang Xian walking towards them, they were all astonished.

The king of Bingxin’s expression changed as well. His gaze landed on Ling Jian ‘er. His eyes sparkled as he raised his eyebrows.

“Haha, Heroes Come From Youngsters. Saint, I heard that you have a good relationship with Jian ‘er. You guys should interact with each other more in the future. Jian ‘er is my adopted daughter. We welcome the Saint to Our Bingxin Empire in the future!”

King bingxin laughed out loud and said to Wang Xian with a smile.

Wang Xian was slightly stunned when he saw King Bingxin’s enthusiastic look. His eyes were filled with a smile as he said, “I might have to trouble king Bingxin then!”

“No trouble, no trouble!”

King bingxin shook his head and looked at Ling Jian ‘er. “Jian ‘er, you should have a good interaction with priest Wang in the future!”

He said with a smile on his face. Obviously, after witnessing the relationship between Wang Xian’s strength and the Wuji Empire, he wanted to befriend Wang Xian.

As for who he should befriend, he obviously had an opinion!
