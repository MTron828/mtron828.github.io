Chapter 54: Crippled

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

If we can’t talk it out, we fight!

Let’s fight!

Wang Xian had his own principles and bottom line. In the past, as long as there was anyone who dared to bully his sister, he wouldn’t care who the other party was. He would just fight it out!

Throughout primary school, middle school and high school, he was more resolute and brave than most kids, as he was a kid without parents.

He knew deeply that only by becoming stronger could he stop others from bullying him.

Therefore, as long as there were people who bullied his sister during primary school, middle school or high school, he wouldn’t care about the age of these people. He would just risk his life and fight them.

Two fights in middle school deterred anyone from bullying his sister.

Three fights in middle school stopped anyone in the high school from bullying his sister.

And a fight outside the bar at that time made all the gangsters in the county wary of disturbing his sister.

To those who dared to bully people he wanted to protect, Wang Xian would not waste his words on them. He never had much to say and would just fight it out.

In the past, he relied on adrenaline and disregarding dangers to his life. As for now, he could rely on his personal strength. Moreover, Bi Xiuming, who had the strongest background in the room, was still weaker than Xue Family.

Therefore, he could strike without being fearful of anything.

Bam!

“How dare you hit me? You are dead this time!”

Bam!

“Argh... My leg is broken, my leg is broken... Don’t hit me!”

“Argh. You are crazy! Stop fighting! Stop fighting!”

Bam!

Wang Xian didn’t say anything when he struck. He didn’t like to speak while fighting as this would disrupt his flow of actions.

Therefore, in less than 10 seconds, the other three young men were already lying on the floor of the room. They had food scattered all over them as they wailed in agony on the floor. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

This was still considering the fact that Wang Xian had controlled his strength. Otherwise, they would have been dead.

“How dare you hit me! How dare you ambush me!”

Bi Xiuming stared at Wang Xian and his body was shaking in anger. He had a hideous expression on him as he stood up and his eyes were bloodshot. “I’m going to kill you!”

“Hehe.” Wang Xian took a glance at Bi Xiuming and mocked, “Just you? You are still too weak!”

As he completed his sentence, he saw a bottle of white wine by his feet. He lowered his body and picked it up.

“Die!” Seeing Wang Xian pick up the bottle of white wine, his eyes twitched violently as he jumped. He lifted his legs and kicked towards Wang Xian violently.

Bam!

However, the bottle of white wine was smashed ruthlessly on his right leg, making him shriek in pain.

“Argh! Bi Xiuming fell to the floor while wailing in agony.

His right leg had been broken!

Bam! Wang Xian heard his scream. He kicked impatiently at him and knocked him unconscious directly.

“Wang Xian, how dare... How dare you hit them? You must be eager to die...” Su Mei’er, who had been staying by the side, shrieked in horror.

Wang Xian looked over coldly.

“Xiao Xia, you... You... How could you start the fight. It’s over Xiao Xian!”

Guan Shuqing saw Wang Xian strike without warning. Moreover, he even broke their arms and legs. Her heart started beating violently as worries filled her and her eyes turned red with tears.

“Big Brother! F*ck! Who the hell dares to offend my Big Brother.”

At this moment, Xue Jing had arrived. Seeing the mess and the four young men lying on the floor, he turned to Wang Xian and asked, “Big Brother, are you alright?”

“I’m fine. Do I look like I’m not?” laughed Wang Xian.

“That’s true. Big Brother is so powerful,” chuckled Xue Jing. He turned his attention to the four young men on the floor and a violent light flashed in his eyes. “Damn it. How dare you offend Big Brother.”

As he spoke, he walked straight into the room, pulled them by their clothes and threw them on the floor.

“Sorry to trouble you,” Wang Xian saw the mess in the room and said.

“Big Brother, not at all.” Xue Jing quickly shook his head. He looked at the four young men on the floor and said, “He is from Bi Family and this must be Gong Liuyun from Gong Family. Damn it. They must be too eager to die. Big Brother, you are too lenient on them.

As he finished his sentence, he kicked consecutively at the arms of the four men under the horrified eyes of Guan Shuqing and the other 3 girls.

Crack crack crack crack!

The sounds of bones breaking propagated over. Xue Jing didn’t hold back at all and crippled the arms of the four young men.

Argh!

The intense pain jerked them awake as they held onto their arms in anguish.

“Tsk. This is just a small lesson to you guys.”

Xue Jing sneered. He had witnessed Wang Xian’s strength. Because of his provocation, he almost died from a single kick of Wang Xian. Based on what his father had told him, if Wang Xian had not stepped in to help, he would have been crippled.

Therefore when he saw that the injuries on the four young men weren’t that serious, he piled on their injuries smartly to appease Big Brother Wang Xian.

“Director Xue!”

At this moment, seven to eight security personnel of the Summer Sun Resort had rushed over. When they saw Xue Jing, they quickly greeted him.

“Call for an ambulance and send them away!” Xue Jing instructed coldly.

“Yes, Director Xue.” The security personnel nodded their heads.

“And the four of you, get out of here.” Xue Jing looked at the girls and shouted.

Su Mei’er and the other two girls were stunned and looked at Xue Jing in horror.

Guan Shuqing was also a little shocked as she shrank her body instinctively and hid behind Wang Xian in fear.

“This is a friend of mine!” Wang Xian patted on Guan Shuqing’s shoulders and said to Xue Jing.

Xue Jing’s body shivered. When he saw Wang Xian’s actions, he immediately said to Guan Shuqing, “I’m sorry Sister-in-law. It’s a misunderstanding.. a misunderstanding!”

Guan Shuqing was a little overwhelmed at this point.

“Big Brother, it would seem like you haven’t gotten your lunch yet. Why don’t I inform my grandfather and let’s have lunch together?” Xue Jing asked with a faint smile.

Wang Xian hesitated for a while and looked to Guan Shuqing. “Have you eaten? Wanna join us for lunch?”

Guan Shuqing nodded her head vaguely but quickly added, “Xiao Xian! Those guys that you beat up had very strong backgrounds. They...”

“Rest assured. It will be fine.” Wang Xian shook his head at Guan Shuqing and smiled. “If you encounter any difficulties in the future, just tell me. If anyone bullies you, I’ll beat him up for you!”

Guan Shuqing looked at Wang Xian, gripped onto the edge of her clothes and replied, “Thank you, Xiao Xian.”

“Hehe.” Wang Xian stared at her and smiled. “That... Do you mean what you said last night?”

“See... See your performance!”

“Hehe!” When Wang Xian saw Guan Shuqing’s reaction, he had a resolve. He knew that he had fallen for this girl. When he saw her being treated unfairly and fought for her, he knew that the number of people he wished to protect had increased by one.

“Big Brother Wang Xian, please go to this private lounge. My grandfather and Old Qin would be there soon. Let’s go and wait in the private lounge!” Xue Jing said.

“Alright!”

Wang Xian nodded his head and said to Guan Shuqing who was beside him, “Let’s go. We will be having lunch with some friends in a while.”

“Mm!” Guan Shuqing nodded her head and took another look at the four young men moaning in anguish.

Just a while ago, Wu Chen had looked at her arrogantly and told her that she would be his wife in the future and that she had to listen to everything he said.

The few other young men around Wu Chen were all looking at her and mocking her about her family’s bankruptcy and that she shouldn’t think too highly of herself.

At this moment, they were all lying on the floor.
