Chapter 370: Female Dragon Riders

After leading Guan Shuqing, Lan Qingyue and the rest into the Dragon Palace, Wang Xian looked at the huge blue whale above him. However, he wasn’t too concerned about it.

The blue whale was just a large creature. Its attacking capacity was very weak and it wasn’t even in the Inborn Realm.

“The Dragon Palace has four entrances. The Eastern Gate, Western Gate, Southern Gate and Northern Gate. What do you guys think? Aren’t the dragon gates majestic?”

Wang Xian smiled and introduced the place to Guan Shuqing, Lan Qingyue and the rest.

“It feels like we are entering the giants’ world. All the structures here are so huge!”

As the girls entered the Dragon Palace, they wrapped their arms around Wang Xian and were dumbfounded by what they were seeing.

Each pillar was at least fifty to sixty meters tall. Some were even over a hundred meters tall.

On both sides, there were majestic mountains. Each step was over half a meter tall.

The path of the Dragon Palace was extremely broad. All these things were new to the girls and they were observing their surroundings carefully.

While the group looked on in awe, Wang Xian stayed by the side and maintained a gentle smile. After walking for ten minutes, they arrived at the Dragon King Hall.

“This is the Dragon King Hall and that’s the Dragon Throne. The two rows by the side are for the officials of the Dragon Palace!”

“Dragon Throne!”

“Oh gosh! What a huge Dragon Throne!”

This golden column is really huge. It must be the Sea Stabilizing Immortal Column! Oh gosh! This must be the Sea Stabilizing Immortal Column in the legends!”

“Every engraving of the divine dragon looks so vivid. It is as though they could come alive at any moment!”

Guan Shuqing and Lan Qingyue pointed at different areas as they exclaimed.

“Behind the throne is the Sea Stabilizing Immortal Column and Dragon Transformation Pool. If one undergoes baptism in the Dragon Transformation Pool, he receives the bloodline of the divine dragon and could evolve into a dragon in the future.” Wang Xian continued his introduction.

“Can one really turn into a dragon?” Guan Shuqing and Lan Qingyue stared at him and asked inquisitively.

“Yeah, it’s possible!” Wang Xian nodded his head and continued, “Let’s go. I’ll bring you guys to the highest point to see the entire Dragon Palace!”

Wang Xian moved and a stream of water surrounded them and brought them to the peak rapidly. Pointing forward, he said jokingly, “Look! This is the empire I have conquered for you!”

Looking down at the entire Dragon Palace, the group was even more in awe.

This place was just like a place of miracles! The sacred ground that only existed in legends!

“Xiao Xian, it’s better if you take a break to recuperate!” After looking around for some time, Sun Lingxiu reminded him of this.

“I’m fine. The injuries will heal gradually!” Wang Xian shook his head.

“Where are your wounds? Let us take a look!” asked Guan Shuqing and Lan Qingyue caringly.

“Uhm... Let’s go! I’ll bring you guys to the last place! My bedroom!”

Wang Xian chuckled. Moving again, he brought them to his bedroom below.

When Mo Qinglong heard that it was the bedroom of the Dragon King, he didn’t follow. Therefore, he continued observing the entire Dragon Palace! CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Wow! What a huge room!”

When they entered, Guan Shuqing and Lan Qingyue were shocked by how big the bedroom was. The bedroom was over a thousand square meters with incomparably luxurious decorations.

It was especially so for the middle of the room. There was a huge bed that spanned fifty meters. This could very well make it to the Guinness World Records.

“What a huge bed! Why is it so big?”

The three girls were dumbfounded.

Wang Xian chuckled, jumped and landed on the bed. The soft bed was exceptionally comfortable.

“Oh right! Xiao Xian, how did you get yourself injured. Are your injuries serious? Let us take a look!”

Guan Shuqing and Lan Qingyue walked over and asked caringly.

“Although the injuries are serious, I’ll be able to make a full recovery in a month or so,” Wang Xian replied with a laugh.

“Let us take a look!” Guan Shuqing kneeled on the bed and pouted. “You don’t know how worried we are!”

“Uhm, alright!” Wang Xian hesitated for a while before releasing his top.

His clothes were made from water streams. Therefore, they disappeared with just a thought.

Sun Lingxiu, who was standing by the side, blushed in embarrassment. She took a glance at Guan Shuqing and Lan Qingyue before heading out.

With the top gone, the wounds on Wang Xian were revealed. Those wounds were still bright red and looked a little horrifying.

Guan Shuqing and Lan Qingyue gasped and expressed their concerns. “Xiao Xian, does it hurt?”

“It’s still alright!” Wang Xian chuckled. He wasn’t willing to expend a huge amount of dragon energy to heal his injuries and therefore he still had lots of wounds on him.

Moreover, they looked extremely serious.

“Are there other wounds?” Guan Shuqing tapped lightly on the wounds of Wang Xian, frowning as she asked.

“I have some injuries on my legs too!” Wang Xian chuckled, rolled his eyes and the pants that were formed from the water disappeared, leaving only underwear.

“This...”

The wounds on Wang Xian’s legs were even more serious. The two girls tapped lightly on the wounds while shivering slightly in fear.

A sizzling and numbing sensation cruised through him and aroused Wang Xian.

Pop!

At this instant, the underwear that was formed from the water was poked through by something.

Guan Shuqing and Lan Qingyue were taken by surprise. Soon, their faces were blushing in embarrassment.

Wang Xian looked at them kneeling on the bed. Those alluring figures... He could no longer hold himself back.

He didn’t seem to have noticed that something had popped out.

“Argh, I’m hurting. I need treatment!” Wang Xian growled softly.

“Huh?”

The two girls were surprised. They shifted their gazes away and asked, “What happened, Xiao Xian? Where are you hurting?”

“I have a treatment method!”

Wang Xian continued mumbling and started his explanation.

The treatment method required the cordial combination of Yin and Yang and neutralizing the desires of one.

Wang Xian held the hands of the girls and was constantly luring and acting pitifully.

Perhaps it was because Wang Xian was injured. Guan Shuqing and Lan Qingyue eventually became noble dragon riders.

Real female dragon riders!

Wang Xian was exhilarated to do so with Lan Qingyue and Guan Shuqing at the same time on the lare, fifty meter bed.

Despite being the proud and noble divine dragon, he didn’t feel aggrieved after being ridden. All he hoped for was more instances of such experiences.

After two hours, the three of them slept on the bed.

When Wang Xian woke up, the two girls were already awake and were wearing their clothes

When they saw Wang Xian opening his eyes, they gave him a harsh stare.

Wang Xian chuckled and pulled Lan Qingyue over. “Qingyue, let your hubby give you a present!”

“What’s the present? Don’t be so touchy!” Lan Qingyue said in a coquettish tone as she fell on the soft bed and covered her body.

“It’s really a present and not the billions I gave you last night!”

Wang Xian smiled bitterly. Waving his hand, the drop of Essence Soul from the cabinet beside the bed flew towards him.

“What’s this?”

Lan Qingyue turned over. Seeing that it wasn’t the billions that he’d given her the previous night, she heaved a sigh of relief and looked over.

Guan Shuqing also stared curiously at the Essence Soul which harbored incredible energy.

“This is an Inheritance from the Ancient God Kun Breeder, a powerful race!” explained Wang Xian plainly.
