Chapter 1667: In the Panic of 1667 Fengtian City

“What’s going on? We can’t contact the Five Elders of our holy item forging workshop?”

“We can’t contact three elders of our life and Death Pill Workshop?”

“We can’t find more than a dozen deacons either?”

In the center of the city, the five elders were sitting in five courtyards. When they heard the news from their disciples, they all had solemn expressions on their faces.

“Clan elder, not only that, many experts of the mercenary group and some families affiliated with our two big forces have also gone missing. We can’t find them at all!”

Three middle-aged men reported to the five clan elders from the front.

“What?”

The five men immediately stood up and looked at each other.

“Gather the disciples of our life and Death Pill Workshop and holy item forging workshop immediately!”

A clan elder directly ordered the middle-aged man.

“Yes, Clan Elder!” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

The two middle-aged men immediately nodded and walked out.

“Go!”

The five elders were somewhat worried. Their bodies moved and directly floated in the air.

The five of them looked at their surrounding positions, and their eyes revealed rays of bright light.

“All Disciples of the life and death forging workshop, holy item forging workshop, gather here!”

“All Disciples of the life and death forging workshop, gather here!”

With two shouts, a middle-aged man moved forward and a middle-aged man moved backward. Their voices instantly covered the entire Fengtian city.

“What’s going on?”

“Why do I suddenly have a bad premonition!”

“What happened?”

“It seems that many experts went missing in the afternoon!”

Everyone in Fengtian city was slightly shocked when they heard the two middle-aged men’s cries. They began to discuss among themselves.

“Oh no, are we going to be alerted?”

Wang Xian heard two cries near the city gate. He frowned slightly when he saw the five half-step Wanshou powerhouses floating in the air.

“Let’s do it. This is the shop of the holy item forging workshop and the life and Death Elixir Workshop. There are more than a thousand void interpretation powerhouses gathered here. There are also five or six void interpretation ninth level powerhouses!”

Wang Xian thought to himself as the corners of his mouth curled up slightly.

“Since the other party is alert, let’s end this quickly!”

“Ao Yao, let’s do it as soon as possible. It doesn’t matter even if we are discovered!”

As Wang Xian spoke, his figure flashed and appeared in front of the two level nine insightful emptiness realm experts.

Under the astonished expressions of the two of them, Wang Xian waved his arm and instantly killed them.

At the same time, he dashed towards the other few level nine Seethrough realm experts.

“Who is it!”

As Wang Xian did not hide anything, he was immediately discovered when he arrived in front of a level nine Seethrough realm expert.

Boom

However, Wang Xian waved his arm and the grey energy hit his body directly.

“Ah, there’s an assassin, there’s an assassin!”

At this moment, there was a sudden exclamation from not far away.

“PFFT! PFFT! PFFT!”

Following that, a series of sounds of assassinations were heard.

“Continue!”

Wang Xian glanced at the center. Due to the distance being too far away, the five half-step Wanshou Masters did not notice him.

His figure shuttled rapidly. Without the strength of a fifth-level void interpretation stage or above, one could not see his shadow at all.

“PFFT! PFFT! PFFT!”

Under the massacre by Wang Xian, the noble Seethrough realm experts were slaughtered like pigs and dogs.

“Clan elder, there’s an assassin! There’s an assassin!”

In less than five minutes, an earth-shattering voice suddenly sounded.

The voice was filled with panic and resounded throughout Fengtian City.

“Strange Demon, come back!”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows and immediately sent a voice transmission to Ao Yao and the rest.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

One by one, the figures flew rapidly towards Wang Xian’s location.

“Let’s Go!”

After keeping the spiritual storage pouch, he concealed himself and teleported to the highest restaurant in Fengtian City.

His gaze swept across the insightful emptiness realm expert in the room. Before he could react, he had already killed him.

“What?”

“Which faction dares to commit a crime in our Fengtian City? !”

In the center, five half-step longevity realm experts heard the distress call from the east gate, and their expressions changed slightly.

The five figures moved, and like a violent sun, they quickly flew toward the east gate.

“Clan elders, there are killers, there are killers. They can actually hide in the void. Several deacons were instantly killed, and their corpses were taken away!”

A middle-aged man saw the five clan elders flying over and hurriedly flew into the air to welcome them.

His face was filled with fear as he spoke.

When they heard the Clan Elders’summons, they immediately rushed towards the center. In the end, more than ten figures instantly appeared behind them.

Other than him, everyone else was instantly killed!

When he saw this scene, he was so frightened that he almost wet his pants. His back was instantly covered with cold sweat as he hurriedly shouted.

Even when he saw the five clan elders flying over, his face was still in shock.

“What’s going on? All the disciples of the life and Death Pill Workshop’s holy item forging workshop immediately flew over and directly flew into the air!”

A clan elder looked at the middle-aged man who was still in shock. His face instantly became gloomy as he shouted loudly.

“It’s the Clan Elder!”

Below, the disciples of the two big forces hurriedly flew into the sky.

One, two...

“Where are the deacon disciples? Where are the disciples above the profound void tier?”

However, very quickly, when the five clan elders saw the disciples flying up one by one, there were very few profound void tier disciples. Their expressions changed drastically as they roared loudly.

Their voices resounded throughout the sky.

“More than a hundred, why are there only a hundred? Aren’t there a thousand or so profound void tier disciple elders guarding this place? Where are they? Where Are They Now?”

A clan elder swept his gaze over the tens of thousands of people floating below. His pupils constricted slightly as he growled in a low voice.

After the life and Death Medicinal Pill Workshop’s medicinal pills were mysteriously snatched away last time, they had sent even more disciples to guard this place.

However, there were only a hundred or so profound void martial disciples now. Where were the remaining people?

“What assassin assassinated all of You!”

A clan elder took a deep breath and asked the disciple who had called for help.

“I don’t know, Clan Elder. I didn’t see it clearly either. I only saw a white shadow, and then they died!”

“It’s too terrifying. This group of assassins is simply too terrifying!”

The middle-aged man said with a face full of fear, but the fear on his face did not disappear.

“Just a white shadow? Trash!”

Seeing a fifth level profound void martial disciple actually look so terrified, the faces of the five clan elders turned black, and their faces were extremely unsightly as they cursed.

“Assassin, an assassin actually entered our Fengtian City!”

“Today, it seems that many experts and mercenary groups directly disappeared. Could it be that the assassin did it?”

“How is this possible? There are so many experts in our Fengtian city. How could the assassin assassinate them so easily?”

“Didn’t you see the frightened look of the deacon of the Holy Item Forging Workshop? He is a fifth level void interpretation expert!”

In the Fengtian city below, exclamations could be heard.

The mercenary groups and the forces attached to the holy items were all filled with fear.
