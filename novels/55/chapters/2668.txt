2669 2669 quickly went to ask the Dragon Palace warrior for help

“DAMN!”

In the sky above the abyss in front of Yao Yue Planet, the Undying Level 9 ancestor from last month who was being attacked by the three abyss seeds had an ugly expression on his face.

Last month, the leader and the rest were fighting four against six.

The four of them were very familiar with each other, and together, they could barely hold back the attacks of the six level 9 abyss seeds. However, these six abyss seeds suddenly split up, wanting to attack the humans below.

This forced the four of them to split up to obstruct them.

However, this split up allowed them to fall into their trap.

Three of them instantly entangled the Hierarch of last month and the two ancestors, while the other three surrounded and attacked one.

In a battle between experts of the same level, if it was not for the great difference between divine artifacts and divine kingdoms, it would be somewhat difficult to kill the other party.

Even in a situation of the same level, two against one, if the difference was not great, it would still take a lot of effort to kill one.

However, a three-on-one situation was different. It could be said that a huge qualitative change had occurred.

If three people attacked at the same time, one of them could only Dodge. Once he couldn’t Dodge, he would suffer a heavy blow.

“Old Feng, hold on!”

A forefather roared with an extremely ugly expression.

“F * ck, Rising Sun, come out!”

The forefather of last moon, who was besieged, cursed. His expression changed drastically as he roared.

“Buzz!”

A huge sun instantly appeared behind him. It was the real huge sun.

The entire huge sun was as dazzling as the sun, emitting terrifying flames.

The Flames directly attacked the three rank nine abyssal seeds in front of him.

Forefather of last moon took out his final trump card.

“Boom Boom Boom!”

However, the three rank nine abyssal seeds did not show any signs of fear. Their three attacks landed on the huge Sun’s flames, directly suppressing it.

100% suppression.

“Gugugugugugu!”

In the middle, an extremely bloated abyssal seed suddenly opened its mouth, and pieces of liquid appeared.

“Whoosh!”

That liquid was like a living thing, directly attacking last moon ancestor.

“Melt for me.”

Last Moon ancestor’s eyes shot out a luster, and a pillar of fire shot out from the Great Sun.

The pillar of fire tore through space, and even the air was burned.

“Roar!”

“Ga Ga!”

The other two rank nine abyssal seeds also attacked.

The pillar of fire didn’t hit the strange black liquid, but was blocked by the two rank nine abyssal seeds.

The strange black liquid landed on the Sun.

“Ah!”

Suddenly, a scream came from last month’s forefather, and his expression changed as he stared at the sun behind him.

A black dot had appeared on the Great Sun. The area of that Black Dot was expanding at a terrifying speed.

His face broke out in a cold sweat.

“Boom!”

He waved his arm and hurriedly put away the great sun.

“Boom Boom Boom!”

However, the moment he put it away, three attacks attacked him once again.

“Come and support me. I can’t hold on much longer.”

The ancestor of Last Moon’s face was covered in cold sweat as he roared.

“Damn it, damn it!”

The three sect masters of Last Moon and the others who were being held back revealed anxious expressions.

They wanted to break through, but the abyssal seed in front of them wanted to exchange injuries for injuries. No matter what, it would not let them break through.

The three rank nine abyssal seeds also knew that as long as they were held back for a while, they would be able to kill that expert.

Once one of them was killed, the three before them would also be killed very quickly.

“What’s going on? Oh No, one of our ancestors is in danger.”

“One of our ancestors is being besieged. Our ancestors aren’t a match for the six rank nine abyssal seeds.”

Below, when the experts and disciples saw this scene, they revealed panicked expressions.

... Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

If the patriarch and the others couldn’t defend against the six rank nine abyssal seeds, they would also be massacred.

“Ah!”

Suddenly, a shrill cry sounded. Hearing this voice, everyone’s bodies trembled.

“Damn it, I can only hold on for three minutes at most. After three minutes, I will be killed!”

In the sky, the patriarch’s shrill voice sounded.

His words made the hearts of the last Moon sect master and the others sink, and a trace of panic flashed in their eyes.

“Use all your trump cards, don’t hold back!”

An old ancestor roared furiously.

“Ah!”

However, when his roar had just ended, the old ancestor who was besieged once again let out a miserable cry.

They glanced over and saw that the two arms of the last moon old ancestor had been completely melted.

...

For such a powerful warrior, breaking his arms would allow them to recover instantly. However, what frightened everyone was that.

The melted arms wanted to grow, but they were completely blocked by the dark energy.

“This... this... can our forefather hold on for three minutes?”

Below, some of the powerful warriors and disciples’faces changed dramatically. They were severely injured in a short moment. It was still a question whether the forefather could hold on for three minutes.

“Where are the Warriors from the Dragon Palace? Why aren’t they here yet?”

A disciple from last month’s great sect shouted anxiously.

“The Dragon Palace has gone to support the dragon Python group, even if the Dragon Palace comes, they can’t change the situation.”

A middle aged man beside replied with an ugly expression.

“The Dragon Palace has an undying level 9 warrior, they can hold on if they come.”

“They’ve already killed two undying level 9 abyss species, their strength is very strong, not weaker than our ancestor and the rest.”

The moment he finished, the other disciples from last month rushed over to help and shouted.

“What? There’s A Level 9 warrior in the Dragon Palace?”

“The Dragon Palace killed an undying level 9 abyss species?”

Some of the Warriors and disciples who had been guarding the area were shocked and asked.

For a time, many people were in an uproar.

“HM? Dragon Palace, there’s an undying level 9 warrior in the Dragon Palace?”

Above, the leader’s pupils contracted slightly, immediately asking below.

“Leader, the Dragon Palace does have a few undying level 9 abyss species, they easily destroyed two of them.”

An elder replied immediately.

“What! Quick, go and get the Dragon Palace warriors to come and help!”

“No matter what conditions the Dragon Palace offers, we’ll agree!”

When the leader heard that, his face filled with hope, he immediately roared.

“Quick, Go!”

The other ancestors also roared madly.

At this time, it was a very dangerous time for the entire last month’s great sect, one wrong move and they would all be destroyed.

If they continued to fight, the four of them might die here.

However, if they escaped, all the disciples of the great sect last month would become the food of the abyss seed.

Now that there was a slim chance of survival, they naturally held on tightly.

However, what was hard for the sect master and the others last month to imagine was that the dragon palace was actually so powerful.

“Yes, yes, quick, go and ask the experts of the Dragon Palace for help. Go and ask the Dragon King for help.”

An elder of last month flew out of the abyss crazily and shouted anxiously.

“I didn’t expect the Dragon Palace to be a life-saving straw for the sect master of last month.”

The experts of the other forces were slightly shocked when they saw this scene!
