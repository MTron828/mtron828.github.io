Chapter 32: Too Weak, Too Weak

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

Emerging from the seas, Wang Xian put his clothes back on.

Since his level had advanced to Level Three, there’d been an invisible might of the dragon emitting from his body. At the same time, his body became slender and of perfect proportion.

Through the strengthening by the dragon energy, his skin was fair and flawless without any marks.

Wang Xian revealed a faint smile. He stretched his back before looking for a string to tie up all the lobsters and swimming crabs.

I’m going to have a good rest when I get back.

Wang Xian clenched his fist as he felt the strength of his body. With a face of smiles, he headed forward.

It’s easier to get a private-hire car nearer to the Summer Sun Resort. Therefore, he had chosen to walk towards the entrance of the Summer Sun Resort.

The sun was hung high up in the sky during the early afternoon. When it was noon time, the skies started to darken. Wang Xian raised his head and took a look at the weather.

Perhaps I might be able to summon clouds and make it rain as I wish one day.

Wang Xian thought to himself. He smiled and arrived at the entrance of the Summer Sun Resort.

There was a huge fountain in front of the main gates of the resort. At the sides of the gate, there were trees and other plants as decoration. These plants cast shadows over an area and there were some tables and chairs under the shade that was available for others to take a break.

Wang Xian noticed that there weren’t any private-hire cars at the entrance. He took out his phone and started calling for one through the internet.

Huh? It’s raining now?

However at this moment, small droplets of rain started falling from the skies. Wang Xian immediately ran towards the shade of the trees.

When he arrived at the shade, he saw a middle-aged and old man within it.

The old man was wearing a white martial arts suit made of silk and looked just like the typical old people who practiced Taichi in the garden in the morning.

As for the middle-aged man, he was wearing a shirt and standing by the side. He was looking at the old man with caring eyes.

Wang Xian’s arrival drew the attention of the middle-aged man. He took a glance at him and didn’t pay attention to him thereafter.

Wang Xian placed the lobsters and swimming crabs by the side before picking up his phone to continue his booking.

At this moment, the revving sounds of the engine of a sports car sounded over. Wang Xian turned his head to took a look and noticed a teenager running out of a Ferrari towards him.

“Grandfather.” The teenager looked very strong and healthy. With a simple jump, he leapt over the grass and started shouting excitedly towards the old man, “Grandfather, I’ve made the breakthrough.”

“Huh?” The old man looked at his grandson and revealed a satisfied look. “Not bad, not bad. You are much better than your father. Your father had only made the breakthrough when he was 27 years old.”

“Grandfather, come and give me some guidance.” The teenager rubbed his hands excitedly.

The old man saw Wang Xian. He waved his hand and replied to his grandson, “Let’s do it at night. It’s not very convenient right now.”

The teenager was taken aback slightly. He took a glance at Wang Xian, who was standing just beside them, and knew that his grandfather was a little wary.

He turned towards Wang Xian and said directly, “Hey brother, do you mind excusing yourself from here. We have some matters to attend to.”

When Wang Xian heard his words, doubts arose in his mind as he looked at the teenager in front of him.

His demanding demeanor pissed Wang Xian off and thus he just ignored the teenager.

Huh? The teenager frowned and a cold and murderous intent flashed past his eyes. He walked slowly towards Wang Xian.

“Xiao Jing, don’t cause trouble,” the old man reminded him when he noticed his grandson was walking over.

“Grandfather, I’ll just be inviting him away. I won’t cause any trouble.” The teenager seemed to be a little fearful of the old man as he turned around and replied to him. After which, he extended his hand over to Wang Xian and grabbed his shoulder.

Wang Xian lifted an eyebrow when he saw the action of the teenager. Looking at his extended arm, Wang Xian moved his right arm and grabbed onto the teenager’s arm.

“What do you want?” Wang Xian lifted his head and said coldly to the teenager.

Eh? The teenager looked surprised. Soon after, the corner of his mouth arched up slightly as he spoke. “Your reaction is pretty quick?”

Moving his arm, he reverse grabbed onto Wang Xian’s right arm.

So fast! A normal person definitely couldn’t achieve this speed. Wang Xian was slightly shocked as he looked at the teenager grabbing onto his arm.

At this point, he recalled the conversation between them and the “Martial Artist” the boss robber had mentioned previously.

Could it be that they are martial artists?

“Hey, brat, please get out of our sight.” The teenager looked at Wang Xian with eyes of mockery and disdain. However, he was gradually applying force with his palm.

Pretty strong! Wang Xian was once again slightly shocked as he felt the strength of the teenager through his arm.

At the same time, he started exerting a little strength onto the arm of the teenager.

“Argh!”

“You are seeking your own death!”

A horrifying shriek of pain propagated. Following which, the teenager growled furiously.

The middle-aged man and old man were shocked when they heard the shriek and quickly turned around.

“Xiao Jing, stop it! Don’t injure others!” they shouted when they saw the teenager lifting his leg and sweeping it viciously towards Wang Xian.

Feeling his arm going numb, the angered teenager didn’t stop but instead attacked furiously with his right leg.

“It’s you who are seeking your own death.”

Wang Xian saw the vicious attack from the teenager. His expression turned colder and he reached out his palm directly.

What seemed like an unstoppable right leg was grabbed directly and no longer pushed ahead.

Similarly, Wang Xian lifted his leg and kicked towards the chest of the teenager.

Bam!

The strong impact force smashed the teenager onto the stone bench by the side. The teenager couldn’t hold back and vomited blood, followed by a horrifying shriek.

“How dare you injure my son!”

Everything happened in just a blink of an eye. They had initially thought that this young man would be injured by the teenager. However, in just an instant, Xiao Jing was the one who was so gravely injured that he spat out blood from the impact.

The middle-aged man was stunned. However, he moved quickly subsequently and attacked Wang Xian like a leopard hunting its prey.

Wang Xian looked at the middle-aged man and murderous intent started to build up.

The speed of the middle-aged man was much faster than the teenager. However, it was still too slow in his eyes.

Looking at the fist that was attacking towards him, he reached out his hand directly.

He stopped the fist with one hand and stopped it from moving an inch.

The middle-aged man was shocked. The punch he had put all his strength in was stopped as though it was being fixed in the position.

“Too weak.”

Wang Xian also lifted his fist and attacked towards the stomach of the middle-aged man.

Bam!

The mighty strength of the Divine Dragon sent the middle-aged man to his knees directly.

“Hey pal, this is just a misunderstanding.” The old man was dumbfounded to see the young man defeating his grandson and son with just a kick and a punch. He quickly interrupted.

Wang Xian looked to the old man and shrugged his shoulders slightly. “I don’t think that this is just a misunderstanding.”

“I’m sorry, son. I’m sorry. I’m Xue Liangren, please accept my apologies,” the old man hurried over and said to Wang Xian with his right fist clasped in his left palm.

“Please forgive us. My grandson and son failed to recognize how mighty you are. If they have offended you, please allow me to apologize for them.”

The old man repeated himself.

Cough cough! The old man was a little agitated and started coughing violently. He quickly took out a white handkerchief to wipe his mouth and his blood was all over the handkerchief.

Wang Xian looked at the old man. He shook his head slightly and remarked, “Forget it.”

He wasn’t a person with violent tendencies. If the teenager’s attitude was better and he hadn’t wanted to show his strength in front of him, he would not have retaliated.

Moreover, he had not controlled his strength well when he attacked previously.

He had thought that the other party was strong but they were unexpectedly weak to spit out blood after just taking a kick. This guy was just too unlucky.

Too weak, too weak! Is this the strength of a martial artist?
