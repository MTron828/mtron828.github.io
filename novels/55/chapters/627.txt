Chapter 628: Blood Flowing A Thousand Miles (1)

All the martial artists were staring anxiously at the Underworld website for updates from Rivertown. However, half an hour passed by quickly and there wasn’t any news updated on the Underworld website.

“What’s the matter? What’s the situation now?”

“Even if the Dragon King has arrived, all the matters should have been settled by now. Why isn’t the thread being updated? Could it be that the original poster was killed?”

Some martial artists stared at the Underworld website and felt that something wasn’t right. A bad premonition started weighing over their minds.

As for the families and members of Dong Hua Sacred Sect, Devil Corpse Palace, Dark Sect and some other Sacred Clans and Sacred Sects, they hesitated for a moment before attempting to make calls. However, none of them got any responses.

This undoubtedly made them feel that something bad had happened.

However, they shook their heads violently soon.

It’s impossible. It’s cannot be. Sect Leader Nie Wushuang and Emperor Qi were so strong. More importantly, there were four other Immortal-like old men with them.

They had witnessed how terrifying these four old men were. Each action of theirs could bring forth catastrophic destruction. Existences like these weren’t something that the Dragon King could handle.

Time passed by gradually.

At this very moment, Xue Family of Rivertown was one of the top Ancient Martial Arts Families in Rivertown. Due to their relations with the Dragon King, no one in the Underworld would dare to offend the Xue Family.

Within the backyard of Xue Family’s villa, Old Xue lay on the floor and was coughing out blood. Xue Jiahua and Xue Jing were also on the floor with pale faces.

The three generations glowered furiously at the group of people before the door and their eyes were filled with despair.

“Tsk! The Xue Family sure is weak and small. The only thing you could blame would be following the wrong master and forces. Since you are on great terms with the Dragon King, you guys can meet him in hell!”

In the middle of the courtyard, a group of twenty-plus martial artists stared harshly at the Xue Family. All of them had hideous and gruesome looks on them.

“Cough, cough! Our Xue Family is contented to have enjoyed the glory days!”

Old Xue smiled bitterly and had seemingly accepted his impending death.

The Dragon King was killed and the Dragon Sect was annihilated. To show their loyalty to the Eternal Sacred Sect, this group of people before them wanted to annihilate his Xue Family.

He looked at his son and grandson beside him. Although he was bitter, he heaved a long sigh.

“Grandpa, there’s nothing to fear about death. After all, we have enjoyed the glory days. Hehe! It’s been worthwhile!”

Xue Jing grinned at his grandpa before turning to stare coldly at the group of people before them. “If the Dragon King can make it past this disaster, he will definitely take revenge for us. All of you will suffer gruesome deaths!”

“Haha! Dragon King? He’s dead by now! Before the four Immortal-like experts, he has probably been reduced to dust by now. You can show your loyalty in hell! Haha! In the future, there’ll no longer be any Dragon Sect or Dragon King in the Underworld!”

An old man standing in the middle laughed hysterically at them. “Today, we will grant you a quick death. Go join your Dragon King in hell!”

Hahahaha!

Hysterical laughter resounded in the backyard of the Xue Family. Three middle-aged men smirked and walked towards the three generations of the Xue Family with their longswords.

“There’s nothing to fear about death!”

Old Xue gritted his teeth, shut his mouth, and then shouted. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Hehe! In that case, die!”

The three middle-aged men swung their swords towards them.

Bam! Bam! Bam!

The three generations of the Xue Family closed their eyes in despair as they waited for death to descend upon them.

However, all they heard were sounds of things falling to the ground. The pain, which they had expected, did not come.

This shocked the three generations of the Xue Family.

“The Dragon Sect would not let the friends of our Dragon King die!”

A faint voice reverberated and Old Xue jerked opened his eyes. He saw over thirty people in the air. After a brief moment of feeling lost, excitement beamed in his eyes.

“Old Mo, you guys...”

Old Xue’s body shivered in agitation as his eyes beamed with fervor.

“Our Dragon King shall shine forever like the sun and moon. Those who offend the Dragon King or the Dragon Sect shall all die!”

Mo Qinglong nodded his head at Old Xue. Following which, he got back onto the golden longsword and flew away.

“Dragon King... The Dragon King isn’t dead!”

“The Dragon King isn’t dead!”

Xue Jiahua and Xue Jiahua opened their eyes and saw the disappearing crowd of dragonians. When they saw the twenty-odd people who were still going on about killing them moments ago on the floor, exhilaration was written all over their eyes.

“If the Dragon King isn’t dead, then...!”

Old Xue stood up gradually and his eyes beamed with fervor.

“Nie Wushuang from Dong Hua Sacred Sect, Emperor Qi of Diabolism and the four old men were finished. They definitely have been killed by the Dragon King!”

Xue Jing continued the sentence for his grandfather. His face was flushed red from excitement as he cheered, “Haha! Great! This is perfect!”

Xue Family, who had been in despair moments ago, were in ecstasy after surviving the ordeal.

“Let me check the information on the Underworld website!”

Xue Jing took out his phone immediately. “There isn’t any news on the Underworld website yet and the livestream broadcast stopped after the Dragon King appeared. It seems like they were all killed!”

“Let’s just wait for news from here onwards!”

Old Xue’s eyes flickered. “From here onwards, they will be awaiting the anger of the Dragon King!”

The anger of the Dragon King!

Old Xue knew Wang Xian well. He was a friend who valued relationships.

If he was your enemy, he definitely wouldn’t show mercy or compassion!

On the Underworld website, it had been an hour since the last update on the return of the Dragon King appeared on the livestream thread.

The more time that passed, the more flustered some people felt.

It was especially so when no one could contact the experts who had gone to annihilate the Dragon Sect. Unconsciously, everyone had a bad premonition about the incident.

“Shocking! Dong Hua Sacred Sect has been annihilated. Not a single disciple remains!”

One hour and five minutes later, a thread appeared on the Underworld website and sent shockwaves throughout the Underworld.

When everyone clicked into the thread, they were instantly dumbfounded.

Blood and destruction represented the current Dong Hua Sacred Sect.

Those pictures of corpses made everyone feel as if their scalps were going numb. Fear that originated from one’s soul spread across their entire body!

The pictures on the thread were all pictures of the corpses of Dong Hua Sacred Sect’s disciples. Moreover, these corpses could be found throughout the entire Dong Hua Sacred Sect.

The original poster was a friend of an Attendant of Dong Hua Sacred Sect. Ten minutes before, he had headed to Dong Hua Sacred Sect and witnessed a horrifying scene.

“Dong Hua Sacred Sect was annihilated. Gosh! What happened? Who did it?”

“Dong Hua Sacred Sect was annihilated! Everyone in the number one Sacred Sect of the Underworld has now been slaughtered. Gosh! Who’s the one responsible?”

“What happened? Why would Dong Hua Sacred Sect be annihilated?”

Looking at the pictures on the thread, everyone shivered in fear. The largest Sacred Sect in the Underworld had been annihilated without a single person surviving!

“Could it be the acts of the Dragon King and the Dragon Sect?”

Some people’s eyes widened. At the thought that no news was coming from Rivertown, a terrifying thought surfaced in their minds!
