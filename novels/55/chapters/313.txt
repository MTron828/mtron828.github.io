Chapter 314: The Spiritual Island That Was Overrun By Monster

“They got in! They actually got in!”

“How can this be? Where are the Patrolling Yakshas? Why didn’t the guarding animals under the sea surface appear?”

“This is bad! Now that three men have entered, should we follow them in?”

At this moment, the three other forces that had gathered in the vicinity were stuck in a dilemma. Three men had charged towards the Spiritual Island. In the end, they were able to get in easily without any obstruction.

This embarrassed the other three forces.

These three forces were all First-class Forces. They were Lei Family from Modu, Wind God Sect from Dafeng Mountain and Water Separation Island from the Sea Islands.

When they saw Mo Qinglong and the other two men enter the Spiritual Island, they were bitter and furious.

“We can’t continue to wait like this. Otherwise, all the good stuff will be taken away by those three people. We have to get through too!” On a huge fishing boat, several old men’s eyes shimmered.

“In that case, who will test it out first?”

Another old man seemed conflicted. He looked down at the sea surface and still felt heart-wrenching powers from the bottom of the sea.

“Since the three of them got through without any trouble, we shouldn’t be in danger either.”

“Elders, we can first test it out with a yacht. If the yacht isn’t wrecked, we will not be in any danger!” said a middle-aged man while frowning.

Under such circumstances, no one had the guts to charge forward despite seeing others entering the Spiritual Island.

“Try it out immediately!” the old man from Lei Family ordered. Subsequently, a yacht charged towards the Spiritual Island.

When the other two Forces saw it, they frowned. They were also waiting. Once their safety could be verified, they would charge ahead immediately.

“Charge!”

When the yacht reached the Spiritual Island, the surrounding crowd could no longer hold back their urge as they charged rapidly towards the Spiritual Island.

In an instant, a few hundred men flew over directly.

At this very moment, Mo Qinglong, Mo Yuan and Mo Shiwu who had entered the Spiritual Island first were carefully observing the ruins of an ancient sect. All of them were shocked.

White flowers were grown around the entire Spiritual Island and these flowers were producing a faint mist.

The surrounding white mist had all originated from these flowers.

The entire Spiritual Island was beautiful. However, weeds had overrun some places as no humans had lived on it for a long time.

On a stone path, Mo Qinglong, Mo Yuan and Mo Shiwu looked in shock at what was before them.

A footprint! It was a huge footprint that was approximately four meters long and was deeply imprinted on the ground.

“What kind of animal would have left this footprint? How can it be so horrifying?”

Mo Qinglong and the group looked ahead and discovered other huge footprints that were all around the entire Spiritual Island.

Around the footprints were several sets of human remains. Some had decomposed, leaving only bones behind.

Many of these bones had cracked. It was clear that this was caused by huge physical impacts.

“Can it be that this Spiritual Island on the sea encountered an attack by terrifying animals in the sea, leading to the annihilation of the entire sect?”

The three of them were baffled. They looked to the side and found several collapsed brick houses around them. Some were even more than fifty percent destroyed.

It was clear that these houses were knocked down by a terrifying animal.

Mo Qinglong and the group turned their attention ahead.

In the middle of the island, there was a huge training ground. Before the training ground was a row of buildings.

These buildings were fifteen to sixteen meters tall. However, even the tops of these buildings had large holes.

“Who would have expected the entire Spiritual Island to actually be wrecked by a horrifying animal in the sea?”

Mo Qinglong was shocked. He moved and approached the central region of the island rapidly. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Based on common understanding, the central location was where most treasures were kept.

Moreover, spiritual medicine gardens would typically be placed in the central region.

“Split up and search for treasures!” Mo Qinglong instructed Mo Yuan and Mo Shiwu before diving towards a building.

No one knew how long ago the sect on the Spiritual Island had been annihilated. All the buildings had clear signs of weathering.

When they entered the room, they immediately started searching it.

“This is... a depository of books. All the books here are really precious and valuable!”

Mo Qinglong scanned across the room. After which, he headed for another room.

A depository of books wasn’t particularly useful for them.

“This must be the accommodation of the higher management of the sect!”

Mo Qinglong entered another room. After looking around, he immediately started searching the room.

At this moment, Mo Yuan shouted, “Master, the spiritual medicine garden is here!” Mo Qinglong moved and charged over immediately.

Spiritual medicine gardens typically contained the most precious resources of a sect.

The spiritual medicine garden was located at the back. At that place, there was a pond that spanned approximately a dozen mu. Within the pond and around the pond, various spiritual medicines were planted. [1]

Beside the spiritual medicine garden were several sets of remains.

There were four huge footprints in the spiritual medicine garden. A substantial number of spiritual grasses were dead but there were still several hundred tufts of spiritual grass that were still emitting spiritual energy.

It was especially so for the huge lotus flower in the middle of the pond. The lotus flower was the size of a basin. Amidst the darkness of the night, it was still glowing in white light.

The middle of the lotus flower was an entirely white lotus seedpod with countless lotus seeds in it.

One could easily tell that the lotus flower, lotus seedpod and lotus seeds weren’t ordinary.

Mo Qinglong looked across the spiritual medicine garden and his eyes lit up.

“Plucking these spiritual medicines away will be a waste. The best option is to let them continue growing here before plucking their fruits.”

Mo Qinglong looked around him. The most precious of them all should be the white lotus flower in the middle of the pond and a spiritual tree beside it.

That spiritual tree had already reached a height of six to seven meters. Based on Mo Qinglong’s understanding, this spiritual tree was known as Green Fruit Tree. This spiritual tree should have reached Level 5 or 6.

Therefore, it shouldn’t be called a spiritual medicine but a spiritual tree instead.

Other than that, there were at least fifty to sixty tufts of Level 4 and 5 spiritual grass and over a hundred tufts of Level 3 and below spiritual grass.

Perhaps it was because this Spiritual Island had been deserted for five to six hundred years or for an even longer time. With no one harvesting these spiritual grasses, there were a lot of them around.

The value of these spiritual grasses alone is astronomical! Mo Qinglong and the group thought to themselves.

“I found it first. Get lost!”

“I held it in my hands first. Scram or I’ll kill you!”

“Do you think my Lei Family is afraid of your Water Separation Island?”

At this moment, noises came from behind them.

Several hundred people from Water Separation Island, Lei Family, and the Wind God Sect had dashed over. The quiet Spiritual Island became raucous instantly.

Although they were shocked by the humongous footprints that were left behind, they were getting frenzied over the treasures they were seeing.

“The spiritual medicine garden is here!”

At this moment, a few young men dashed over. Seeing the spiritual grass in front of Mo Qinglong and the group, they were thrilled.
