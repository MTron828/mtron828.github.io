Chapter 521: The World is Shocked (3)

The world is shocked!

So is the Underworld!

When the news of the Remains getting annihilated was passed around in the Underworld, threads were being added into the forums at a frantic speed.

Many people found it unbelievable, yet were elated by the fact that the Remains were annihilated by the Dragon King of Dragon Sect.

On the verge of the war breaking out between the devil and orthodox sects, having annihilated one of the four devil sects was as good as weakening Diabolism by one-fifth of their strength.

Yesterday, the rumor that Dragon Sect was joining Diabolism had fallen on its own, putting Donghua Sacred Sect in an awkward position instantly.

[The Donghua Sacred Sect is really embarrassed now. From their statement released yesterday, they were too impatient to deal with Dragon Sect.]

[Donghua Sacred Sect and the rest of the Martial Artists simply accused Dragon Sect of joining Diabolism, so they just annihilated the Remains. Which Sacred Sects in the Underworld are capable of doing so? Even Donghua Sacred Sect would need to make tremendous efforts!]

[I don’t understand the actions of the Dragon King from Dragon Sect. He just rejected to join the alliance of the orthodox sects yesterday afternoon and even made Donghua Sacred Sect their sworn enemy. Yet, Dragon Sect annihilated the Remains that night. We’re just average men who can’t see the link!]

[Let me clarify. The Dragon King has made Donghua Sacred Sect a sworn enemy because of Hai Jiao. Hai Jiao wanted to slay the Dragon King. Still, he was defeated by the Dragon King, and Donghua Sacred Sect wanted to protect Hai Jiao. Hence, they became enemies!]

[But why isn’t Dragon Sect joining the alliance of the orthodox sects? Why does no one ask this question? And why does Donghua Sacred Sect want to protect Hai Jiao when he was trying to kill the Dragon King and was eventually defeated? Obviously, Donghua Sacred Sect infuriated Dragon Sect, resulting in Dragon Sect turning their back on them!]

[In any case, it was good that Dragon Sect did not join Diabolism. Otherwise, given the power of Dragon Sect and the strength of the Dragon King, we don’t know how much price the Underworld must pay just to annihilate Diabolism!]

In the internet world, netizens overturned their points of view at the speed of lightning. That is how the internet works.

Yesterday, many of the Martial Artists were still chiding the Dragon Sect. Still, more Martial Artists surfaced to support Dragon Sect and the Dragon King today.

However, Wang Xian would not have the slightest interest in this even if he knew about it. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

At this time, a group of people arrived on the floating island.

“Wang Xian, we’re here to confirm something with you!”

Sui Huang and Xiao Quanshan led some of their disciples to the floating island and spoke to Wang Xian as soon as they saw him.

“Oh? What’s the matter? Have you brought all the Inborn-level materials? Let me see how many Inborn Spiritual Weapons I can exchange with you guys!” Wang Xian said to them with a broad smile.

“Did you really annihilate the Remains of Diabolism?”

Sui Huang and Xiao Quanshan stared at him, setting the Inborn Spiritual Weapons aside first.

“Yes, I met the people from the Remains yesterday, and I don’t like their ways of doing things. Since I wasn’t far from their base camp, I just annihilated them!” said Wang Xian without any emotion.

Sui Huang and Xiao Quanshan exchanged glances with their lips twitching.

Annihilated the Remains as you wished... It is the Remains you are talking about!

Since the Remains could effortlessly annihilate Sui Clan and Xiao Clan, it seemed like their gaps with Dragon Sect was getting bigger.

“Fine, you’re a demon!”

Sui Huang took a deep breath and continued, “All the Inborn-level materials that we could get are here. Take a look and see how many weapons can be exchanged.”

“Sure!” Wang Xian nodded.

The people from Sui Clan and Xiao Clan carried all the materials forward.

Looking at the chests of Inborn-level materials, radiance was beaming from Wang Xian’s eyes as he showed a hint of excitement.

“Take a look!” Xiao Quanshan told Wang Xian as he opened the chests.

[Wind Feather Stone: Level 10]

[Earthy Clay: Level 10]

[Thunder Rock: Level 10]

[Golden Metal Rock: Level 10]

[Ryukinium: Level 10]

[Vibranium: Level 11]

[Ghost Wood: Level 11]

All the Inborn-level materials brought by Sui Clan and Xiao Clan totaled seven types of different metals.

Out of which, two were Level 11 materials while the rest were Level 10. Metal-attributed materials made up most of them.

“This is Wind Feather Stone, which is extremely durable, and you almost cannot feel its weight.”

“Earthy Clay has a strong stickiness, and it’s hard to get rid of once something is stuck on it!”

“Thunder Rock was a rock found on Thunder Mountain. It was formed through millions of lightning strikes, and therefore it contains an immense amount of electricity. It could easily electrocute an elephant!”

...

Xiao Quanshan and Sui Huang began to introduce the metals to Wang Xian.

In which, the number of Wind Feather Stones was the highest, with sixty pieces of it, while Vibranium and the Ghost Wood had the least numbers.

Overall, they had quite an amount of Inborn-level materials. With those, he could craft at least twenty to thirty weapons under the assumption of a 100% success rate.

The success rate of smithing weapons and alchemy were on par.

But compared to alchemy, some of the materials could be recycled when a weapon failed in the crafting process.

“With these materials, you guys can forget about Dan Realm weapons. Since you have too little Vibranium and Ghost Wood, I’ll give each of you ten Spiritual Weapons. What do you think?” asked Wang Xian with a beaming face.

“Sure!”

Radiance flashed in the duo’s eyes as they nodded in agreement immediately.

Initially, the thought of exchanging these materials for five weapons Inborn Spiritual Weapons would have made a great deal to them. Since they could exchange ten now, it had greatly exceeded their expectations.

“Great, come over and pick your weapons!”

Wang Xian nodded and brought them to the Weapon Pavilion.

Back on the floating island, Wang Xian had ordered his men to construct a separate pavilion for weapons and elixir pills to distinguish the treasures.

All the other forces in the Underworld would usually have one treasure vault, but Wang Xian was different!

When they entered the Weapon Pavilion, one could sense a surge of sharpness and heat as a myriad of weapons were hanging on the surrounding walls.

The weapons were exuding a faint fire glow as they possessed a unique spirit!

“This, this....”

As soon as Sui Huang and Xiao Quanshan entered, their eyes flew open with unbelievable looks.

“You lad. How did you manage to get so many Inborn Spiritual Weapons? Gosh! Why are there so many over here?”

The two of them acted like they were some bumpkins, gazing around in shock.

“I can feel daunting power from that staff over there!”

“That knight sword is above the Inborn-level. It’s definitely more than that!”

“Goodness gracious!”

The two of them looked around with surprise as they almost drooled.

Wang Xian looked at them and chuckled. “Okay, each of you is allowed to take ten weapons. Don’t say I’m mean. It’s quite a lot!”

One was the master of his girlfriend, while the other one was the Laozu of his disciple. On top of that, Wang Xian owed them favors. He would not feel bad for giving them ten weapons each.

“Eh, Wang Xian. You see... Since you have so many Spiritual Weapons over here, can you lend me a handy weapon too?” asked Sui Huang to Wang Xian with thick skin.

Xiao Quanshan, at the side, twitched his lips upon seeing the way he acted. But he also looked at Wang Xian with a flattering look.

“I heard that Shuqing was in a bad mood these last few days. I was getting ready to teach her alchemy over the next two days. The timing is just right!”

Sui Huang took out his trump card.
