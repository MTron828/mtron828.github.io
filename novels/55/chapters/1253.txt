Qian ye’s begging voice sounded in the arena. Everyone widened their eyes in silence.

The entire arena was filled with heavy breathing.

When the members of the Thousand Shadows mercenary group saw their leader in such a state, all of them clenched their fists tightly. Their breathing was a little rapid.

“You Want to kill me? How can I let you off?”

Wang Xian stared at Qian ye expressionlessly. The demon-free sword in his hand moved slightly.

“No, no, no...”

Looking at the movement in Wang Xian’s hand, Qian ye’s heart pounded violently. She screamed with all her might.

The fear and the intense sound of survival made everyone’s scalps tingle.

However, his voice stopped abruptly.

Wang Xian gently put down the demon-free sword in his hand.

Qian Ye’s death was fated because he wanted to step on Wang Xian to raise his status. Later on, he wanted to kill him.

If you have the intention to kill, Wang Xian would naturally not let your enemy off.

“Dead, dead, dead! The strength of the nameless sword demon is simply too terrifying!”

“This is too fast. Qian ye is also a powerhouse at the first level of the Seethrough realm. She actually has no ability to resist at all!”

“Hu, it’s over. It’s over so quickly. Qian ye was actually killed so easily!”

“Oh my God, how could the nameless sword demon’s strength be so terrifying!”

“The ruler of the world, looking down on the same generation as Qian Ye, was actually killed so easily. Perhaps even he himself didn’t dare to believe it. If he knew of this result, he probably wouldn’t have been so pretentious!”

When Qian ye fell to the ground, the entire arena was in an uproar.

It was too fast!

Too strong!

Around the exploding arena, more than 200,000 people were shocked, causing the entire arena to be extremely noisy.

Wang Xian kept Qian Ye’s corpse into his interspatial ring and scanned his surroundings with a smile.

“The nameless sword demon is invincible! The nameless sword demon is invincible!”

Some of the young men shouted in admiration when they saw Wang Xian scanning his surroundings.

The strong were respected by people, especially people like Wang Xian. He was the target and idol of every young man.

“Invincible Nameless Sword Demon! Invincible Nameless Sword Demon!”

The roars were heard one after another.

Slowly, the entire arena was covered by this slogan.

Wang Xian did not have the slightest fluctuation in response to these shouts, roars, and gazes of fervent respect and worship.

What he was after was not these empty cheers, but greater strength.

These cheers were more practical than the spiritual liquid obtained from defeating Qian Ye!

Wang Xian moved his body and ignored the cheers from the crowd. He headed straight to the room beside the Heaven’s pride stage.

There was a porcelain bottle of spiritual liquid there.

Wang Xian took it over with an excited smile on his face.

With nearly 90,000 spiritual liquid in his hands, he took out Qian Ye’s interspatial ring. When he saw more than 10,000 spiritual liquid in it, he couldn’t help but laugh again.

“Haha, I broke through a heaven’s pride ranking and obtained close to 100 million dragon crystals. In addition to selling void interpretation level weapons, I still need more than 800 million spiritual liquid to level up!”

Wang Xian couldn’t help but laugh.

...

“This is unbelievable. Qian ye was killed so easily. Oh My God, how strong is the nameless sword demon? Could it be that he has already reached the second level of the insightful void-level?”

“To create history, since the ancient times, who could have such a strong strength at the age of 26? This is almost comparable to those emperors!”

“After today, the name of the nameless sword demon is destined to resound throughout the entire flowing sea region. It’s so powerful that it makes people despair. Qian Ye’s strength is definitely not weak, but in front of him, he’s like an ant!”

“This time, Qian ye will no longer be pretentious and will be easily killed. Tsk Tsk, Qian Ye’s talent is also very terrifying. What a pity!”

“Haha, Now Your Group of people who support Qian Ye won’t be called? Is it a slap in the face? In the beginning, all of you were still mocking the nameless sword demon!”

After the match in the arena ended, everyone was ejected from the arena by the power of the array formation.

However, the shocking discussions about this battle had only just begun.

Even today’s battle had been discussed for at least ten days.

A twenty-six-year-old youth had reached the top of the prodigy roll. He was the only one among the younger generation who looked down on the entire Liuhai region.

Since ancient times, there might not even be a successor.

“Hu!”

In the sky above the prodigy platform, Tang Feng, Tang Yuan, and Tang Ling ‘er took a deep breath. Their eyes flickered.

“How could a 26-year-old possess such powerful strength? Even with so many resources, we weren’t able to step into the profound void martial stage. He...”

Tang Yuan’s eyes revealed a jealous expression, filled with unwillingness.

Tang Feng, who was at the side, was somewhat silent, followed by a cold smile. “No matter how strong a heaven’s favorite is, he must be able to survive!”

After he finished speaking, his gaze looked at the surrounding sky, and a trace of a smile appeared on his face.

“Great Formation, Lock!”

Right at this moment, an ice-cold voice suddenly sounded, and an incomparably huge blue barrier in the sky covered an area of five kilometers.

“What?”

At least hundreds of thousands of people were covered in this space, causing everyone to be slightly stunned. A stunned expression appeared on their faces.

“Who dares to court death!”

An old man at the profound void tier felt this terrifying formation. His expression changed slightly as he hurriedly shouted.

“The boundless sea empire has disturbed everyone. Everyone, don’t worry. After we kill the person we want to deal with, we will immediately leave!”

A voice sounded in the sky, and the hundreds of thousands of people were slightly stunned as they hurriedly looked toward the sky.

A group of thirteen people stood in the sky and glanced at everyone below.

Each of them contained a terrifying energy.

Everyone was slightly shocked.

“It’s the HANHAI domain. This array is the HANHAI domain, the strongest array of the Hanhai dynasty. It can trap a rank five void interpretation realm expert. Hiss, the Hanhai dynasty actually brought the country protection array!”

A shocked voice sounded from a middle-aged man, causing everyone to be slightly shocked.

The nation-guarding formation. The vast ocean empire actually used the nation-guarding formation to trap all of them here.

This made many people feel baffled, but at the same time, they were also extremely shocked.

“What’s going on? The vast ocean empire actually used the nation-guarding formation. Who are they going to deal with! ?”

“Ling Jian ‘er, they must be going to deal with Ling Jian ‘er, the nameless sword demon, and that Ren Xingchen!”

“It should be because of what happened two days ago. I didn’t expect the Hanhai dynasty to send out so many terrifying experts. They are swearing to kill Ling Jian ‘er and the others!”

Shocked voices came from some people, and everyone immediately looked around.

“Ling Jian ‘ER is over there, and Ren Xingchen as well!”

One person hurriedly pointed over and looked at the two people who were standing not too far away in the sky.

At this moment, Ling Jian ‘er and Ren Xingchen’s expressions were extremely unsightly. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

They sensed the formation below and clenched their fists tightly.
