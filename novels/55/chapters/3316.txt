3317 3316 lowered his head and admitted defeat

“Hong, Hong, Hong!”

Above the ocean of the main planet of the ancient sea race, terrifying attacks poured down.

The moment the level 8 knight arrays were activated, the entire planet started to scatter.

The incomparably huge planet slowly became the dust of the universe.

In the void space, there were only three dragon palaces floating there.

Fire Dragon Palace, Demon Dragon Dark World, Dragon Palace.

The Dragon Palace that was mainly attacked was completely in the state of Doomsday.

When the first level 8 Knight Array landed on the Dragon Palace, there were no ripples or fluctuations in the entire dragon palace. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

It stood tall in the void space, under the cover of all kinds of terrifying energy, there were no ripples at all.

One after another, the level 8 Knight Array landed on the Dragon Palace.

When the fifth level 8 universe Knight Array landed on top of the Dragon Palace and was blocked, the expression of the Lich King turned cold.

However, it was not the end yet, and it was hard to say.

At the end of the array, there was the most powerful eye of Darkness Array

“Hahaha, that Dragon King is trapped, trapped, he is going to die!”

At this moment, in the fifth wormhole, when the array formation trapped Wang Xian, a group of Level 7 universe knights from the Lich Kingdom revealed excited expressions.

They knew how powerful this trapping array was. Once the Dragon King entered, he would never be able to come out again.

“Huh?”

In the space of the shell array formation, Wang Xian’s terrifying attacks landed on it. There was no trace of the shell at all.

This terrifying defensive power made his face filled with astonishment.

As what Mo Sha had said, once he was trapped, he wouldn’t be able to break through.

“Now, it’s up to Mo Sha.”

Wang Xian said.

“PFFT!”

A wave of corrosive and evil energy surged into his body and melted his life force.

The formation compass in his hand was snatched away in an instant.

Everything happened in an instant.

“Predemon, what are you doing! ?”

The liches who were laughing and excited a moment ago had a drastic change in expression when they saw this sudden change.

They had never expected that one of their comrades would suddenly kill one of them.

And they even took the array compass away.

With the compass taken away, the array started to crumble without anyone supporting it.

An array of this level couldn’t have any problems at any point. The moment it did, it would be in big trouble.

A hole appeared on the right side of the shell array.

The other eight universe knights looked at the lich with shock and anger.

“Hahaha, die! Those who provoke us, Dragon Palace, will all die!”

It was Mo Sha who attacked.

At this moment, his face was full of excitement and malevolence.

“Who are you? Kill him, he is no longer a predemon!”

“Kill him!”

The group of five Bug City Universe Knight Level 7 liches roared furiously and attacked Mosha with malevolence.

Boom

However, at this moment, a terrifying figure was rapidly attacking them from the formation in front of them.

Pu! Pu! Pu! Pu

The moment Wang Xian caught the problem with the formation, he unfurled his incorporeal holy wings and instantly attacked the eight universe Knight Level 7 liches.

His speed was abnormally terrifying. A level seven universe knight wouldn’t be able to fight back at all.

The only trump card of the five bug city was destroyed by the predemon with the help of the formation in the grotto-heaven!

Wang Xian’s terrifying dragon claws instantly killed five level seven universe knights.

His figure continued to flash as he attacked the other three.

“No, no, no, the speed of the Dragon Palace is too fast!”

“This… We have already passed the news to the great beings in the central city of the Lich Kingdom. According to their speed, they should be here in a few seconds, but they are not here yet. What exactly happened!”

“No, don’t kill me, I don’t want to Die!”

The remaining three universe knights and level seven liches roared in despair.

The betrayal of one of their companions made them feel shocked and furious. However, the news of the invasion of five insect city had already been spread.

According to the speed of the Lord of the Lich Kingdom, they could reach within a few seconds. It had already been dozens of seconds, yet there was still no reaction.

What was going on?

What exactly happened?

“PFFT! PFFT!”

However, they couldn’t figure it out even until they died.

“Kill!”

Wang Xian killed them. When he saw that the Lich Kingdom didn’t send any reinforcements, he smiled.

He knew that the secret teleportation formation of the Lich Kingdom was the one that Mo sha had found out about. It had been destroyed.

Once it was destroyed, once a large number of level eight universe knights didn’t arrive, it was time for him to kill!

“Kill!”

Wang Xian waved his arm and the destructive power formed by the five elements millstone filled the entire blessed land!

Those liches who were hiding in their lairs were instantly killed.

He moved and flew out of the five worms grotto-heaven. His cold gaze swept across the city of the Lich Kingdom.

“Die!”

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

Wang Xian immediately transformed into a terrifying divine dragon. Streams of dragon breath shot downwards.

On the five elements grinding ground, the gray energy was like the river of time, washing away all life.

The Rampage began!

“What’s going on? How did the teleportation formation in five Bug City break down? This is a secret formation that we have set up. Even the higher-ups in five bug city don’t know much about it!”

“Damn it, what’s the situation in five bug city now?”

At the same time, in the center of the Lich Kingdom, seven universe knights and level eight liches stood in front of a teleportation array, looking extremely embarrassed.

When they received the message from five bug city asking for help, they instantly arrived in front of the teleportation array.

However, they were shocked and angry to find that the opposite side of the teleportation array had been destroyed.

Even the teleportation array that they had secretly set up had been destroyed.

They knew very well what this meant.

The situation in five insect city was probably not objective.

“Not good. The disciples of five insect city have sent a message. They are suffering from a terrifying attack from a divine dragon. Five insect city is going to be destroyed. They have no power to resist!”

At this moment, an expert from the Lich Kingdom roared with blood-red eyes.

After Scorpion Imperial City, the five bug city had also suffered a catastrophe.

This was a huge blow to their lich kingdom.

“Hurry to the nearest main city of the five bug city, Hurry there!”

A lich expert clenched his fists and suppressed the rage in his heart as he shouted in a low voice.

Their figures instantly disappeared.

But it would take them a few hours to get to five insects city.
