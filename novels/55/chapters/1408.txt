Chapter 1409: 1409 return to the palace!

In the King’s zone at the center of Xiaoyao City, all the members of the Fire Hammer clan were behind Wang Xian.

A group of members from the Dragon Palace and the Gilded Gold clan walked over one after another and handed him interspatial rings.

“Return to the Palace!”

Wang Xian looked at the items in the interspatial rings. A smile appeared on his face as he shouted softly.

“The Fire Hammer clan is located in the center. Gather around. The rest of you, follow on the left and right!”

Mou Zesen said to everyone from the Fire Hammer clan. He swept his gaze across the gilded gold clan as well as the insightful emptiness realm experts from the few empires.

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

Soft roars were emitted from the mouth of the flood dragon. The nine flood dragons swayed their bodies and arrived at the front.

A dragon chair appeared at the back. Wang Xian moved his body and landed on the Dragon Chair.

“Move back to the Palace!”

A golden swordfish shouted softly. The Dragon flew towards the Dragon Palace.

Buzz

The people from the Heavenly Eye Arrow Division waved their arms. A strong gust of wind enveloped the fire hammer clan.

The members of the Fire Hammer clan were all at transcendent level 4 or 5. Their flying speed was too slow.

With the Heavenly Eye Arrow Division’s insightful void realm expert leading them, their speed wasn’t slow either.

“Boom!”

When the nearly 4,000 members of the Dragon Palace flew into the sky, their terrifying aura caused the surrounding residents of Xiaoyao city to widen their eyes.

“Who would have thought that because of the fire hammer clan, the entire Xiaoyao city would be annihilated, and all the experts and aristocratic families would die!”

“Even the mayor of Xiaoyao City, the most powerful person in the area of 100,000 kilometers, was killed!”

The people looked at the disappearing members of the Dragon Palace in awe and shock.

Xiaoyao city would be destroyed in name only. Soon, the entire city would be taken over by the dragon-phoenix dynasty.

“Dragon Palace!”

The members of the fire hammer clan floated in the air for 1,000 meters. They looked at the scenery around them and the disappearing Xiaoyao city with yearning in their hearts!

The Dragon Palace would be their new place of birth.

On the way back, Wang Xian took a whole four days to bring over 2,000 members of the Fire Hammer clan along.

Wang Xian told Feng Luan in advance and asked her to pick up a few powerhouses from the dynasty as well as members of the Gilded Gold clan.

After that, he brought the fire hammer clan along and headed towards the Dragon Palace.

“Your Fire Hammer clan originally possessed the bloodline of the fire gold dragon species and belonged to the aquatic species. Today, you have returned and will be the first to break through the Dragon Gate!”

When he arrived in front of the Dragon Palace, Wang Xian spoke to all the members of the Fire Hammer clan.

“Oh my God, this is the Dragon Palace. This is simply...”

“A huge palace located at the bottom of the sea. This area is at least a hundred kilometers. It’s not much smaller than Xiao Yao city. Furthermore, this building is simply too shocking!”

“I can feel a kind of attraction from the bloodline inside. This... This will be our home in the future?”

All the members of the Fire Hammer clan widened their eyes in shock when they saw the magnificent dragon palace in front of them.

This huge building that stood at the bottom of the sea was really intimidating.

“Let’s start to break through the Dragon Gate. Not all creatures can enter the Dragon Palace. Those with poor aptitude are not qualified to enter the Dragon Palace!”

The Fire Hammer clan leader asked the members of the Dragon Palace for some information on the way and said to all the humans.

“Yes, yes!”

The members of the Fire Hammer clan looked a little nervous as they rushed toward the Dragon Gate.

When they entered the Dragon Gate, they felt a strong resistance.

However, they had the bloodline of the peak dragon species of the Dragon Palace, so the resistance didn’t stop them.

“What a rich spiritual essence! It’s Too Rich!”

“Wow, is this our Dragon Palace? It’s so beautiful!”

The members of the Fire Hammer clan entered one by one. Their faces were filled with excitement and excitement.

“Dragon King!”

At this moment, ao Nu and ao Xia flew over and greeted Wang Xian respectfully.

“Settle down the fire hammer clan and bring them around the Dragon Palace!”

“Also, get Prime Minister Gui to bring them to the dragon pool to increase their strength!”

“Also, let Gilded Gold Yan enter the Dragon Pool as well!”

Wang Xian said to them.

“It’s the Dragon King!” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Ao shrimps and Ao nv nodded immediately.

“Dragon Pool!”

“Thank you, Dragon King!”

Duan Jinming and the chief of the Fire Hammer tribe looked excited and immediately shouted respectfully.

“Hehe!”

Wang Xian smiled and flew directly to the location of the Dragon King Hall.

“Jin Ming, what is the Dragon Pool?”

“Clan leader, what is the Dragon Pool?”

Jin Yan and the Fire Hammer clansmen asked curiously.

“Let the two lords of the Dragon Palace introduce it to you!”

The Fire Hammer clan leader looked at ao shrimps and ao Nu and said respectfully.

“There’s no need to be so respectful. Our Dragon Palace has the Dragon King’s Palace, the Dragon Pool, the Dragon Cave, and the Dragon Field, which are four of the more important venues!”

“The Dragon King’s Palace is where the Dragon King handles his affairs. The Dragon Cave is where the disciples of the Dragon Palace Live, and the Dragon Field is where they practice their skills!”

“As for the Dragon Pond, it’s also called the Dragon Transformation Pond. You can increase your cultivation base and evolve into other dragon species!”

Ao Nu continued to introduce with a smile, “There are currently 4,000 members of the Dragon Palace. Including you, there are a total of more than 6,000 members. Currently, there are eight leaders...”

“Oh my god, there are actually 600 insightful emptiness realm experts in our Dragon Palace!”

“There are only 6,000 members living in the Majestic Palace within a radius of more than 100 kilometers. Oh My God!”

When the members of the Fire Hammer clan heard ao Nu’s introduction, they all widened their eyes in shock.

“The evolution of our bloodline will allow us to become the Divine Dragon Clan. We can easily break through to the insightful emptiness realm, or even higher than that!”

The Fire Hammer clan leader’s face was filled with excitement.

Even Gilded Gold Yan was a little absent-minded. Her current strength was only at level seven of the extraordinary realm. She was not considered weak among humans.

It might be difficult to break through the insightful emptiness realm in this lifetime. However, as long as one entered the dragon transformation pool, the insightful emptiness realm was merely a starting point.

This opportunity was simply too terrifying!

“Dragon King, Miss Feng Luan and the dragon queens are here!”

Less than an hour after Wang Xian returned to the Dragon King’s Palace, Prime Minister Gui came to report.

“Wang Xian, the news you brought this time really caught me off guard. I made a trip to Xiaoyao city and destroyed it!”

A group of girls followed Feng Luan in. They walked towards Wang Xian with smiles on their faces.

“Hehe, how is it? The dynasties within a radius of more than 100,000 kilometers are waiting for you to reclaim them. When are you going to take action?”

Wang Xian asked with a smile.

“Are you trying to tire sister Feng Luan to death? The matters of the four empires have yet to be settled and you have started to reclaim the seven to eight empires. There are still more than a dozen others!”

Shu Qing and the rest walked over and said with a smile.

“Hehe, I never thought that the dragon-phoenix Empire would develop so quickly. If I were to develop on my own, even with my past experience, it would take at least 10 years to conquer more than a dozen empires!”

Feng Luan looked at Wang Xian happily.

It was good to have someone to rely on!
