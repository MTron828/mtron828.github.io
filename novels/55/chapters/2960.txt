Chapter 2961: rainbow colored glazed stone

The domain Lord personally led the way, and the god Emperors followed by his side.

The nine divine dragons flew directly into the palace.

“Greetings, Dragon King!”

The ten million glazed stone disciples immediately half-knelt in the air and shouted loudly.

!!

They also looked at the figure standing on the dragon palanquin with excitement.

Dragon Palace Dragon King!

Although they hadn’t seen the Dragon King make a move, most of them had seen the six experts of the Dragon Palace make a move.

Those six experts had easily destroyed the two devil dens that were chasing them.

Those two devil dens were existences that the entire glazed area might not be able to resist even if they risked their lives.

However, the Dragon Palace only had six experts, and they had easily destroyed them.

Without the Dragon Palace, there wouldn’t be the current glazed area.

In the surrounding areas, the citizens of the glazed area didn’t have any objection to the governor and the godly monarchs leading the way to let the Dragon sedan enter directly.

Everyone looked over in awe.

“Please, Dragon King. All the powerhouses of the Dragon Palace, Please!”

Coming to the front of the Veluriyam Capital’s main hall, the governor bowed and gestured.

Wang Xian nodded and opened the curtain of the Dragon sedan with a smile.

A group of girls walked out with smiles on their faces.

“Welcome, Dragon Queens. I hope that all of you can have a good time here at Veluriyam Capital.”

Upon seeing Guan Shuqing and the other girls, the domain Lord and the rest also said enthusiastically.

“Thank you!”

The group of girls nodded and followed Wang Xian inside.

“Celestial emperors, they are all celestial emperors!”

The Grand Supreme Elder and the rest swept their gaze across the group of girls and were extremely shocked.

The Dragon Queens of the Dragon Palace were all celestial emperors.

How many celestial emperors were there in the Dragon Palace?

“Dragon King, it’s been tough for you to come all the way here. We’ve prepared a sumptuous feast.”

The governor said with a smile.

“Governor, you don’t have to be so polite. You Won’t be staying here for more than a few days. The situation in the chimei territory hasn’t been settled yet.”

Wang Xian said with a smile.

“Hehe, Dragon King, if there’s anything we can do to help, you can just tell us directly.”

The governor nodded with a smile.

Following the governor and the rest to the main hall, most of the celestial thearchs in the resplendent starry sky had arrived.

Wang Xian had a meal with them and chatted about the situation of the resplendent starry sky in the future.

The holy region and the glazed region were willing to communicate and connect the entire resplendent starry sky together.

The few celestial thearchs from the Heaven Punishment Ancient Heaven region also chimed in immediately.

After that, Wang Xian also mentioned that he wanted to build a dragon palace on some of the planets in the glazed area. The governor and the rest did not have any objections.

The meal was very harmonious.

Following that, the governor brought Wang Xian and the rest around the treasured land that was more than a billion years old in glazed area.

A Day passed very quickly.

The next day, the celebration officially began. The entire glazed area was filled with jubilation.

There were all kinds of performances.

This time, in addition to celebrating the fact that the glazed tile territory had survived the crisis, there was also a very important point, which was to thank the Dragon Palace for their support.

On the high platform in front of the ceremony, countless powerful disciples of the glazed tile territory were standing in front of them.

“To thank the Dragon Palace for saving our glazed tile territory, I, glazed tile, offer the most precious gem of glazed tile, the rainbow colored glazed tile, and the rainbow colored glazed tile, which is half of glazed tile’s storage

“In addition, we, Veluriyam capital, will be here. We will use the glazed stone to sculpt the divine dragon statue, so that the disciples of the Veluriyam capital will always remember the kindness of the Dragon Palace!”

Not long after the celebration began, the governor stood in front and announced loudly.

The two celestial emperors walked toward Wang Xian with the treasures in their hands.

Wang Xian took the treasure box and said a few words with a smile on his face.

Following that, the governor of the Holy Region and the others also sent congratulatory gifts to thank the Dragon King for eliminating evil and the rest of the Holy Region.

Following that, the domain Lord announced that Wang Xian would be addressed as the king of the starry sky.

All the strong disciples cheered for the king of the starry sky!

The cheers resounded throughout the entire glazed starry sky!

Wang Xian’s gaze swept across the billions of people in front of him as a faint smile appeared on his face.

The celebration lasted for three days. After Wang Xian appeared for an hour, he left immediately. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“This glazed seven-colored stone has such a majestic energy. It has all seven attributes of metal, wood, water, fire, Earth, light, and darkness. The domain Lord’s strength can be greatly enhanced with the help of the glazed seven-colored stone.”

“The energy contained in it is much stronger than ao crab’s. It should be at the fifth level of the void God Emperor. Furthermore, the energy contained in these five-colored glazed stones is also very huge.”

Inside the dragon sedan, Wang Xian sized up the gemstones that contained a vast amount of energy. His eyes sparkled.

The value of these gemstones was very high. The most important thing was that they were very special.

The seven attributes of the rainbow colored glazed stone could be linked together completely. Furthermore, if the energy of one attribute was consumed, the energy of the other attributes could be replenished quickly to achieve a balance.

Releasing an attack could borrow the energy within to enhance it.

“It can enhance one’s strength and change one’s appearance. It can also be said to be a divine weapon.”

Wang Xian mumbled. With a wave of his arm, the five elements millstone appeared in his hand.

With a wave of his other hand, the poles of yin and Yang appeared.

“This five-colored glazed stone can be directly devoured by the five elements millstone to increase its level. The seven-colored glazed stone should be able to do the same!”

“Furthermore, I think the material of this seven-colored glazed stone can be used to create a tai chi dragon disc!”

Wang Xian mumbled.

Then, he looked at the rest of the glazed stones. There were more than a thousand pieces of dual colored glazed stone. The energy contained in each piece was comparable to a first level divine emperor level treasure.

However, in reality, the dual colored glazed stone was not as effective as a first level divine emperor level treasure.

The effect was too simple.

Among the dual colored glazed stone, there were many pieces of darkness and light that were fused together.

“The Tai Chi Dragon disk is much stronger than the light and dark forces that I released. The five elements grinding and the Tai Chi Dragon Disk’s defense are just right!”

“These glazed stones are enough to create a very powerful divine weapon.”

Wang Xian mumbled.

“Xiao Xian, we are prepared to play in the glazed domain for a while before returning!”

At this moment, a group of girls walked in and said with smiles on their faces.

“Alright, you guys can play here. Let Feng Shenlong and the rest follow you. I will continue to deal with the matters in the chimei domain!”

Wang Xian said to them.

“Alright, we will send you more photos when the time comes. Remember to check them!”

The group of girls said with a smile.

Wang Xian nodded with a smile. He walked out of the Dragon sedan and called an lie over.

“Ao Crab Heaven Array, let’s go. Ao Yao, follow us and try to settle all the demon caves in the chimei territory as soon as possible!”

Wang Xian said to them.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Everyone nodded. An Lie’s energy enveloped them and disappeared instantly. They appeared in the Dragon Cave at the border of the Chimei territory.

“I’ll leave the rest to you guys to settle. Inform me when you’re dealing with that level four demon of the void God realm!”

Wang Xian said to them. He was not with them for the time being.

“It’s the Dragon King. Don’t worry, Dragon King, leave it to us!”

Ao kao an lie and the rest nodded. They immediately attacked the demon caves one by one.

Wang Xian took out the five elements grinding mill and took out all the glazed stones. He began to upgrade and forge divine artifacts.
