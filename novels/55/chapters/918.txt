Chapter 919: Congratulations on your death!

Translator: 549690339

On the battlefield outside the city gates of Shenghai Town.

Just now, the leader of the Mirage Sea mercenary group was about to launch a sneak attack on Wang Xian. However, after he left, he was instantly attacked by the other party.

At this moment when the city was being attacked, there were around 70,000 to 80,000 people watching from the surrounding and the city walls.

The sudden outbreak of the battle caused everyone to reveal a look of shock.

Especially the counterattack of the Immortal Phoenix mercenary group, it shocked everyone.

Berserk, too berserk.

Although the young leader of the Immortal Phoenix mercenary group was extremely powerful, in everyone’s eyes, there was still a huge gap between him and the Mirage Sea mercenary group.

The leader of the Mirage Sea mercenary group had just advanced to transcendent-level 6 not long ago, and there were two transcendent-level rank 5 experts in the mercenary group.

There were seven or eight transcendent-level rank 4 experts.

On the other hand, there were only twelve people in the immortal Phoenix mercenary group, and the other eleven people had transcendent-level rank 4 strength.

The difference in strength between the two was huge.

“This is too violent. Xiu Qianshan failed his sneak attack just now, and in the blink of an eye, he attacked back. Moreover, he killed seven or eight people from the mirage sea mercenary group, and even killed a transcendent-level rank 5!”

“Hiss, the Mirage Sea mercenary group was too careless. They were suddenly attacked by a group of golden mackerel. They couldn’t Dodge in time and were directly killed by eight people!”

“It wasn’t that the Mirage Sea mercenary group was careless. No one expected that the immortal Phoenix mercenary group dared to counterattack. They actually dared to launch a sneak attack!”

Seeing the eight members of the Mirage Sea mercenary group fall to the ground, everyone around sucked in a breath of cold air.

The timing of the Immortal Phoenix mercenary group was too tricky.

The Mirage Sea mercenary group, which was surrounded by 1,000 to 2,000 golden mackerel, was not in any danger. However, if the members of the Immortal Phoenix mercenary group were included, this would be the ending.

The eight members were killed, including an extraordinary level-five powerhouse.

“I will tear you into pieces!”

When Xiu Qianshan saw that his eight subordinates were dead, his eyes were blood-red. He held the long saber in his hand and slashed at Wang Xian.

The violent aura caused some of the surrounding members of the mercenary group to quickly hide behind.

“This is too f * cking crazy!”

The long-haired young man and the rest were not too far away from Wang Xian and the rest. When they saw the situation, they retreated with pale faces.

They had witnessed this scene with their own eyes. It was a sneak attack and a counter-sneak attack.

They were not afraid at all. It was a battle where they were risking their lives. This made them feel fearful.

“This motherf * cker, even if the immortal Phoenix mercenary group provoked us, we shouldn’t fight back!”

The long-haired youth was completely afraid.

Under the situation where there were fierce beasts around, being attacked by a mercenary group that was stronger than him and still daring to resist was indeed quite irritable.

If it was them, they definitely wouldn’t dare to say a word.

“Lord, the battlefield outside...”

On the city wall, everyone looked at the sudden outbreak of battle in shock. A city guard walked to Jin Qianyuan’s side and hesitated for a moment before asking.

“Since we’re outside the city, let them kill each other!”

Jin Qianyuan’s eyes flashed with displeasure as he coldly said.

The city guard slowly nodded and everyone looked over.

“That young man’s talent is indeed terrifying, but he’s so stupid. He actually dared to launch a sneak attack when he wasn’t the opponent’s match!”

“He’s courting death, Genius. He’s nothing before he grows up!”

“Hmph, this kid is really courting death. He might be killed by Captain Xiu Qianshan!”

Some of them looked at the battle on the battlefield with a hint of disdain on their faces.

Although you are a genius, if you act so arrogantly, you will still be killed.

“You dare to launch a sneak attack on me? Your Mirage Sea mercenary group is courting death!”

Wang Xian’s eyes flashed with a cold glint as the plants around him grew rapidly.

“Hehe, I want to feed that head of yours to the ferocious beasts!”

“Earth-shattering!”

Xiu Qianshan let out a loud roar as he slashed the long saber in his hand toward the ground.

Crack! Crack! Crack

A three-meter wide crack formed instantly and spread toward Wang Xian.

“Tree world’s descent!”

It had been half an hour since Wang Xian had used tree world’s descent the last time. The azure dragon energy in Wang Xian’s body trembled.

The surrounding trees were uprooted from the ground.

However, Wang Xian did not possess any spirit this time. With a thought, he made tree world’s descent form an encirclement.

“This move of yours is ineffective against me!”

When Xiu Qianshan saw that his attack was blocked by the trees from tree world’s descent, a cold smile appeared on his face.

“Go in!”

Wang Xian ignored him and said to the group of golden swordfish that were being suppressed.

Boom! Boom! Boom

Ao Jian and the rest immediately unleashed their attacks and fled into the tree world.

“Destroy them. Don’t let any of them escape!”

Xiu Qianshan roared loudly. The long saber in his hand emitted an earthen yellow glow.

“Divine ability, heaven-shattering and earth-shattering!”

“Boom!”

The terrifying tremors attacked the inside of the tree world. In an instant, large areas of trees were shattered and disappeared.

“Whoosh! Whoosh!”

“Kill!”

The Mirage Sea mercenary group’s bodies emitted all kinds of light as they attacked the tree world.

In an instant, more than half of the hundreds of trees were destroyed.

“You can’t escape!”

Xiu Qianshan charged straight into the forest.

“The Immortal Phoenix mercenary group is done for. They are completely suppressed!”

The people who were watching from the surroundings looked over. The Immortal Phoenix mercenary group was completely suppressed.

“That’s not right. The trees have sealed off the surroundings!”

At this moment, some people revealed a look of surprise.

The moment everyone from the Mirage Sea mercenary group charged in, the tree world descended and surrounded all of them.

“Congratulations on coming in to die!”

At this moment, Wang Xian was smiling as he stared at the more than 30 members of the Mirage Sea mercenary group who had rushed in.

Ao Jian and the rest were standing on the left and right, staring at them coldly. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

When Xiu Qianshan heard Wang Xian’s words and saw that he was smiling, his expression changed slightly. He immediately scanned his surroundings.

The rest of the Mirage Sea members were also looking around vigilantly.

“You’re playing tricks!”

Xiu Qianshan suddenly felt a little uneasy. He growled, “Kill!”

Before he could finish his sentence, he charged at Wang Xian directly.

“PFFT! PFFT! PFFT!”

However, just as he charged into the air, a series of sounds of people falling to the ground came from behind him.

His expression changed drastically and he turned his head quickly.

“What?”

The corpses. In less than a second, more than 30 of his subordinates had fallen to the ground. There was no sign of life at all.

How... How was this possible.

“Impossible, this is an illusion, an illusion!”

His expression changed drastically. His body trembled and the earthy yellow armor instantly covered his entire body. He looked around vigilantly.

“Congratulations, Death!”

Wang Xian waved his arm and a red piece of paper floated towards him slowly.

Xiu Qianshan widened his eyes and stared at the red piece of paper.

He knew this piece of paper very well. Everyone in Holy Sea Town knew it very well.

The red piece of paper represented congratulations on death!
