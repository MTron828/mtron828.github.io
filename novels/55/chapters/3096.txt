Chapter 3097: 3096 battle Angel

An angel represented a race at the pinnacle of the universe.

Once they were related to a race at the pinnacle of the universe, none of them were simple.

Crescent Moon Knight had a force of his own called Crescent Moon Stream. Besides that, other than having some children, he didn’t accept any disciples.

He had a group of subordinates called Battle Angels.

Angels were a race at the peak of the universe, and Battle Angels were the most ordinary army of the angel race, the Battle Angel Army.

Battle Angels weren’t pure members of the Angel race, they were similar to subordinates and cannon fodder.

They used a special method to create subordinates with combat abilities, very similar to robots.

However, they were much more powerful than robots.

The entire third level was filled with these battle angels.

“The method crescent venerable used to create battle angels may only be a replica, but even so, as an existence at the pinnacle of the universe, the replica battle angels are not weak.”

“It’s rumored that as long as one controls the core of a battle Angel, one can control a battle angel. This is even more loyal than a battle pet.”

Senior brother Lu added from the side as he looked around with burning eyes.

In the entire third floor, there were about ten thousand of these battle angels that were stored in glass boxes.

“Battle Angels!”

In the surrounding area, the disciples of the Willow deity Daoist sect were also looking around with burning eyes.

“Everyone, be alert of the surroundings. There are sounds of battle ahead. Let’s get closer and take a look. We must be careful.”

Senior Brother Junzi reminded the surrounding senior brothers.

“Let’s Go!”

Senior Brother Junzi, senior brother Lu, senior brother Kong, and Wang Xian led the way as they flew forward. Soon, the scene of the battle ahead appeared in their sight. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

More than 30 experts from the nine-sword race were fighting with more than a dozen battle angels. Among the dozen battle angels, one of them was at the peak of the Divine Emperor Realm.

In the Crescent Mystic Realm, everyone’s strength was suppressed by 90% , but the battle Angel was able to display its full strength.

A peak of the Divine Emperor Realm Battle Angel was suppressing the seven peak of the nine-sword race.

After the nine-sword race found out about the crescent mystic realm, they sent seven peak of the divine emperor realm experts and more than 10 rank nine divine emperor realm experts. The rest were all at the rank eight divine emperor realm.

One could imagine how much importance they placed on the Crescent Mystic Realm.

“That Jing Yue is over there. That damned traitor.”

When the group saw a young man behind them, anger appeared on their faces.

“Now that they are entangled by the battle angels, should we attack them?”

Senior Martial Sister Lingxin said with a face full of killing intent.

“Let’s focus on the treasures. The battle angels will attack all the invaders. If we charge over, the battle angels will attack us too.”

Senior brother Xu frowned slightly and said.

Senior Brother Lu, senior brother Kong, and the rest nodded slightly.

They did not want to be enemies with the powerhouses of the nine-sword race.

“Alright. This time, we will focus on the treasures.”

Senior Brother Junzi hesitated for a moment before nodding.

“Elder, they are some disciples of the Willow deity Daoist sect. They have the crescent moon key and have sent someone to support them!”

At the front, the nine-sword race was fighting with a group of battle angels. One of the elders glanced at the position of Wang Xian and the rest and said with a solemn face.

“Ignore them. Even if they ask for help, how many experts can they find?”

“From the looks of it, they don’t want to give up the treasures here. Therefore, they won’t announce this place to the public. After we suppress and control this battle angel, they still want to snatch the treasures from us? Dream On!”

“At that time, if they know what’s good for them, we’ll just give them some soup to drink. If they don’t, we’ll just kill them!”

The elder of the nine swords race, who was attacking the Battle Angel, said in a cold voice.

“It’s the Elder!”

The elder nodded his head heavily and swept his gaze around, his eyes were filled with fervor. “Not to mention the other treasures, as long as we control these battle angels, it will be a huge improvement for our nine swords race.”

“Senior brother Jian San, don’t forget junior brother when the time comes.”

At the back, the youth named Jing Yue spoke.

“Don’t worry, you won’t be lacking in benefits.”

The old man nodded, his eyes revealing a smile.

This time, for the entire nine blade race, it was a huge opportunity. The treasures here were also a huge treasure for the universe primary race.

The clan leader would give him a terrifying reward.

And because of this, he had a chance to fight for the position of clan leader…

…

“Junior Brother Junzi, the fourth level didn’t appear. There might be some conditions to enter the fourth level. The nine-blade race must have discovered something. They are fighting with the battle angels. They must be trying to subdue them. We will also take action. These battle angels are even more valuable than battle pets.”

Senior brother Lu and the others looked around and said.

“Alright. The battle angels are also a huge treasure to us. Let’s fight for some as soon as possible.”

Senior Brother Junzi nodded.

“According to our strength, whoever is subdued will belong to whoever. Does everyone have any objections?”

Senior Brother Kong looked around and said.

“Alright!”

Senior Brother Junzi, senior sister Lingxin, and the others looked at each other and nodded slightly.

“This opportunity was given to us by senior brother Junzi and senior sister Lingxin. Therefore, in the end, we obtained some treasures for senior brother Junzi and senior sister Lingxin.”

Wang Xian scanned the surroundings and made a decision.

His words stunned senior brother Junzi and senior sister Lingxin slightly. The disciples of the Willow deity Daoist sect also revealed surprised expressions.

However, they looked at Wang Xian with surprise and gratitude in their eyes.

The disciples of the Willow deity Daoist sect knew Wang Xian’s strength. For him to be able to say these words, it was also a sign of benevolence and righteousness.

“Sure!”

Senior Brother Kong, senior brother Lu, and the rest looked at each other and nodded.

“Let’s talk about this issue at the end.”

Senior Brother Junzi and senior sister Lingxin looked at each other and said.

“Alright!”

Senior Brother Junzi and senior sister Lingxin looked at each other and nodded slightly.

“This opportunity was given to us by senior brother Junzi and senior sister Lingxin. Therefore, at the end, we obtained some treasures for senior brother Junzi and senior sister Lingxin.”

Wang Xian scanned the surroundings and made a decision.

His words stunned senior brother Junzi and senior sister Lingxin slightly. The disciples of the Willow deity Daoist sect also revealed surprised expressions.

However, they looked at Wang Xian with some surprise and gratitude in their eyes.

The disciples of the Willow deity Daoist sect knew Wang Xian’s strength. For him to be able to say such words, it was enough for him to be moral.

“Sure!”

Senior Brother Kong, senior brother Lu, and the rest looked at each other and nodded their heads.

“Let’s talk about this issue at the end.”

Senior Brother Junzi and senior sister Lingxin looked at each other and said.

“Let’s do it!”

Wang Xian looked at the battle angels in the special glass box around him and landed his gaze on a core between the Battle Angels’eyebrows.

This was a control core. The battle angels were a type of special life form. However, they had no emotions and only knew how to obey orders.

After selling these battle angels, they could bring a large amount of resources to the Dragon Palace.

“Everyone, be careful. All the battle angels have the same size. Furthermore, you won’t be able to sense their power even if they are placed in the box. The Battle Angels that you have released might be at the peak of the celestial thearch level.”

“Once a peak of the Celestial Thearch Level Battle Angel is released, all of us will join hands.”

Senior gentleman reminded them as he looked at Wang Xian and the rest.

Wang Xian nodded his head lightly. He did not take these battle angels to heart.

After all, his strength was placed here.

However, senior brother Junzi and the rest did not know his true strength.
