“Boss, should we make a move? If we kill this kid, Young Master’s mercenary group and the Yun family will definitely give us a lot of benefits!”

“The amethyst mercenary group and the Void Beast mercenary group are here. You Want to kill him? Shut Up!”

“Hehe, boss, I don’t know why this kid let the amethyst mercenary group and the Void Beast mercenary group protect him so much!”

“What’s the use of that? Now that he has offended the Yun family, even with the background of their two leaders, they can’t protect this kid. After all, Yun Hanhai is the most outstanding disciple of the Yun Family!”

As they watched Wang Xian and his men walking into the deep pit of the cave, everyone looked at their backs and whispered to each other.

Leader Lian even mocked them.

Only the amethyst mercenary group and the Void Beast mercenary group had ugly expressions on their faces.

They had witnessed Wang Xian’s incredible detection ability along the way. Following Wang Xian was definitely more suitable than working together with them.

However, Wang Xian found an excuse to separate from them. This made them unhappy.

Zhang Yitian and Xia houming exchanged glances. They walked over helplessly and discussed their next move with the other mercenary groups in the Demon Hunters Academy.

Zhang Fengying was the only one who was glaring at Wang Xian’s figure with gritted teeth. He wished he could swallow him whole.

“There are quite a number of people?”

Five minutes later, Zhang Yitian, Xia houming, and the rest were discussing beside the deep pit in the cave when a group of people flew over.

The group of people looked over and revealed a hint of surprise on their faces.

There were thirty people in the group. The weakest among them was at level-six extraordinary.

However, this was not what surprised them. What surprised them was the eight people at the front.

Rank 7 transcendent, eight rank 7 transcendent experts.

“It’s snake mark. I didn’t expect commander snake to come personally!”

“Those four middle-aged men are from the Yun family. Hiss, the Yun family actually sent four rank 7 transcendent experts over!”

“They are?”

Everyone looked over in astonishment.

Even Zhang Fengying and elder Zeng had solemn expressions on their faces.

They knew this group of people and their abilities were not weaker than theirs.

“Everyone, I heard that Wang Xian is here. Have You Seen Him?”

Snake Hen swept his gaze across the group of Amethyst and void Beast and asked coldly. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Yes... We have!”

Commander Lian looked at Zhang Yitian and Xia houming, turned around and said, “Commander snake, they entered the deep hole five minutes ago.”

“Oh Really?”

He looked into the deep hole and said, “If you see them, please inform the communication stone plate. We will definitely thank you!”

“Also, I hope no one will protect them!”

As he spoke, he looked at Zhang Yitian and Xia houming.

“Let me tell you, anyone who dares to protect the person who killed our young master is an enemy of the Yun family. Don’t blame us for being ruthless when the time comes!”

A middle-aged man from the Yun family standing next to Snake Mark warned the members of the amethyst mercenary group and the Void Beast mercenary group with a murderous look in his eyes.

This made Zhang Yitian and Xia houming extremely embarrassed.

Zhang Fengying and elder Zeng, who were standing at the side, also had a glint in their eyes.

They did not dare to help Wang Xian openly after the Yun family had made such a harsh statement.

“Everyone, we’ll go in First!”

Snaketrace took a glance at them and walked straight into the deep pit. A group of experts followed behind him.

“We have to hurry over as well. Snaketrace and the Yun family not only want to kill Wang Xian, but they also want to try their luck!”

Captain Lian said anxiously when he saw them enter.

“Let’s Go!”

Zhang Yitian, Xiaxia, Hou Ming, and a few level 7 supernatural realm experts nodded their heads and entered the deep pit immediately.

At this moment, Wang Xian had already entered the deep pit.

The deep pit had an area of about 2,000 square meters and was about five meters deep.

It was surrounded by densely packed caves.

There were at least a thousand caves, some big and some small.

Through these caves, one could enter the cave of the wind-winged savage fish.

Wang Xian directly chose a relatively large cave entrance in the middle and walked in.

Once they entered the cave entrance, it was as though they had entered a maze. When they walked for about 100 meters, they encountered a fork in the road.

“Let’s go this way!”

Wang Xian’s eyes sparkled. He chose a path and walked straight in.

In his vision, there were passages on both the left and right sides.

The passages were blocked by the soil five to six meters away.

As they were at the bottom of the sea, which was more than 20,000 meters away, the soil was extremely hard. Without the strength of a level five extraordinary, it would be difficult to dig a hole.

“With the light and dark fire dragon eyes, as long as my luck is not too bad, I will definitely be able to find the treasure of the winged savage fish!”

The corners of Wang Xian’s mouth curled up slightly as he walked straight ahead. He scanned his surroundings and could see through an area of 500 to 600 meters.

“Eh, there’s actually an ambush!”

Wang Xian walked forward and a corner appeared in front of him. At the corner, there were two caracal boas hanging above. If anyone came in, they would definitely be attacked by them.

He waved his hand and walked straight ahead.

“Bang! Bang!”

Before he could walk over, two sounds of falling could be heard.

Two caracal boas that were at transcendent level six had been killed by the strange demon and the rest!

The Cave of the wind-winged savage fish was about five meters wide. The strange demon would be restricted a little here.

However, hunting other ferocious beasts and demonic beasts would be a piece of cake.

“Continue!”

With the light-dark fire dragon eyes and the strange demon and the rest, Wang Xian’s speed was extremely fast.

Everything in the surroundings was under control. Once he discovered the demonic beasts and demonic beasts, he would be able to be hunted by the strange demon rapidly.

“After entering this place, I will completely lose my direction. Even if I have the light-dark fire dragon eyes, I don’t know where I came from!”

Wang Xian looked behind him. He had completely lost his direction. If he wanted to leave, he could only make a hole above him and leave.

“No wonder it has been so long. The species of the wind-winged savage fish and demonic beasts have not been eliminated!”

Wang Xian continued to walk forward. Suddenly, he stopped and looked to the left.

“That is the nest!”

Wang Xian looked to the left with his eyes glowing. In his vision, there was a huge cave behind the seven passages. It was different from this kind of passage. It was a real cave!

In the cave, there were more than ten wind-wing savage fish. The weakest wind-wing savage fish was at level four and the rest were at level five or six of the supernatural realm!

Wang Xian smiled. “I’ve finally encountered a cave. I heard that there are treasures in every cave!”

Demonic Beasts were no less intelligent than humans. A cave was equivalent to a small family clan. Within this small family clan, there would be treasures.

Wang Xian held the lightning strike wood in his hand and inserted it into the wall of the passageway on the left. He dug out a hole and walked straight over.

A group of members from the Dragon Palace followed behind him!
