“Be my husband and that way you can be responsible for my life!” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Adjaya’s voice resonated in the main hall. She sounded calm as she stared straight into Wang Xian’s eyes.

Wang Xian was stupefied by her words. He found it unbelievable as he looked at Adjaya.

What made it more embarrassing was he needed to look up at her, which was somewhat humiliating.

“Sorry, I have girlfriends!”

Wang Xian shook his head with a smile, yet, he sized her up from head to toe. A foreign babe...

“The law in Dubai allows you to have four wives. It doesn’t matter if you have girlfriends or are married!” said Adjaya to Wang Xian with the least concern.

Wang Xian was speechless upon hearing that. It was clearly indicated that men in Dubai can marry four wives in the book he read this morning.

In addition, there was a lengthy note on how to treat their wives.

That is, to be fair to every wife.

For example, if one buys a bag for one wife, the other three wives must have a bag too. This is a legal requirement.

Wang Xian arched his lips as he scrutinized her from head to toe. “Given the situation now, your life is in my hands. This is not as simple as having a wife. Hmm, there’s another kind of relationship which is not bad: a maid!” Wang Xian chuckled and waved a dismissive hand. “But I have no interest in maids. Nor do I have an interest in a wife. I’m content with all these treasures. Oh, and the Fire God’s Secret Book!”

Actually, he wanted to call Guan Shuqing and Lan Qingyue and check if he could bring a wife back.

But it was just a passing thought. He knew the consequences as a fire in the backyard is not something fun.

Hence, he should not have the least bit of greed in him.

“No way. If you die, I’ll die with you. I don’t want to leave my fate to a stranger. I don’t want to die without any knowledge!” said Adjaya coldly as she continued to stare into his eyes.

“First, I’m the one who saved your life, your benefactor!”

Wang Xian frowned at her.

“And this is my gratitude!”

Adjaya looked at him with passionate eyes.

“I don’t need such gratitude!”

“You won’t lose out even if I marry you!”

“This... My girlfriends won’t agree to it!”

Both of them were glaring at each other.

Wang Xian shrugged his shoulders at her. He spun around, headed for the treasures, picked up the Wan Forging Hammer, and examined it.

“Then you can tell your girlfriends to agree if they want you alive!”

Adjaya suddenly made a comment from behind.

Wang Xian was slightly stunned as he cast a glance in the direction of the nine halls where Dan Realm Fire Demons were striding towards him.

The Budding Realm blackie that had been staying in the main hall was staring at him with his pitch-black eyes.

He raised his eyebrows as he stared at Adjaya. “You’re playing with fire!”

“If you dared to kill me, you couldn’t leave this place either.”

Adjaya smiled as she looked at the Fire Demons around her.

“I never expected that I’d be forced to get married someday. But marriage does not mean it can resolve everything.”

Wang Xian touched his face slightly as he remarked in a self-deprecating way.

“I believe in my charm!”

Adjaya gave a confident smile.

“You’re good, but you can’t force it on me. I might as well consider you being a slave to me!”

Wang Xian did not want to continue the discussion with Adjaya.

This was the most absurd thing he’d encountered today.

A foreign babe is forcing me to marry her?

And she’s somewhat beautiful.

Yet, he could not even get mad at this sort of thing.

“I’ll leave my treasures with you for now. Get me a vessel, and I’ll leave in two days!” said Wang Xian to Adjaya.

“If you don’t agree to it, you can never leave Dubai!” Adjaya replied confidently.

“YOU!”

Wang Xian pointed his finger at her as he walked to her side.

Adjaya looked at him plainly with a slight curving of her lips.

With some amusement in his eyes, Wang Xian had a thought.

Instantly, tremendous changes happened to Adjaya.

The faint red glow on Adjaya suddenly turned into a blue shade.

With blue eyes and skin glowing in blue radiance, the fuming fiery girl transformed into a gentle and mild water-like woman

Wang Xian wanted to pinch her, but she dodged it.

“Haha, let me feel what it is like to be at Grade 9 of Fire and Ice!”

Wang Xian chortled as Adjaya suddenly became changed from a fiery-red to blue-like water. The transformation just tickled him.

The confidence diminished from Adjaya’s face as she stared at Wang Xian lividly.

Given her current state, there was no way she could fight back except to glower at Wang Xian.

“Haha, babe, don’t act snobbish. You better behave in front of me, otherwise... Heh, heh! Get me a boat, and I’ll leave in two days. Be good!”

Wang Xian chucked and headed outside.

Adjaya recovered herself with flames rising from her body. She stared at the spot where Wang Xian had disappeared with a mixed expression.

“Perhaps I should imprison you or tie you by my side, otherwise...”

“Damm, I’m actually being forced into marriage for the first time in my life. On top of that, she threatened me with her life. Luckily, she’s not an ugly woman!”

Wang Xian walked out of the Fire God Palace, shaking his head.

If he wanted to leave this place, no one could stop him. Not even Adjaya or that Fire Demon.

“But my treasures are still inside the Fire God Palace!”

Wang Xian raised his eyebrows as he came to a restaurant to enjoy his delicacies and the sea breeze.

While he was enjoying his carefree sunny time in the afternoon, a babe actually chatted him up.

Wang Xian could not help but admire his own charm. If not for his attractiveness, that Adjaya would not force him to marry her.

...

“Lingling, Xiao Wan, there will be a business convention in the ballroom of the most luxurious hotel in Dubai. Isn’t your friend staying over there? We can invite him over!”

Back at a tea shop by the beach, Tang Lingling’s boyfriend suggested this to her and Mu Xiaowan with a smile.

“Yes, since Uncle also stays in this hotel, we can invite him to that boring business convention. My mum even wanted to invite him and show her appreciation for him. Nice, we can have some food after the business convention!” said Xiao Wan excitedly as soon as the young man completed his sentence.

“Mm, sounds good!”

Tang Lingling also nodded in agreement.

“Why not? There will be some heavyweight figures in this business convention, including some who came from Dubai!” the young man said with a smile.

“Who cares? It has nothing to do with us anyway. I’m just checking it out over there!”

Mu Xiaowan dismissed it and spoke without the slightest concern.

The young man chuckled and exchanged gazes with the other three men beside him. A hint of coldness surfaced in his eyes.

Today, they were humiliated and scorned.

He would realize the consequences of doing so soon.
