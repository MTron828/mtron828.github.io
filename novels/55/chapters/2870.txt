Chapter 2871: upgrade

A roar filled with killing intent resounded in the sky above the Blue Moon Planet.

This also triggered the conflict between the eight desolates and the Dragon Palace.

Everyone looked at the figures of the godly monarchs and the eight desolates experts in the sky with awe in their hearts.

“F * ck, boss Wang has declared war with the eight desolates. This is too fierce!”

From below, invincible battle technique looked at the sky and couldn’t help but say when he heard this voice filled with killing intent.

The divine emperor of Shangshui frowned slightly.

The Dragon Palace was enemies with bhang, and invincible battle technique had a good relationship with the Dragon King of the Dragon Palace. This wasn’t a good thing for them.

“Let’s go. In the future, when we meet the experts of bhang, keep a low profile.”

The divine emperor of Shangshui patted invincible battle technique on the head and reminded him before leaving with him.

As a divine emperor, bhang didn’t dare to find trouble with him as a divine emperor.

“From today onwards, all members of the Dragon Palace are forbidden to enter bhang six directions. Once they enter, all disciples of the bhang six directions will be killed without mercy!”

Soon, news of what happened on the Blue Moon planet quickly spread throughout the entire bhang six directions.

This news caused the entire bhang six directions to be in an uproar.

Soon, bhang also posted a message on the communication network.

Once all the members of the Dragon Palace entered their territory, they would be killed without mercy.

This meant that eight barrens and the dragon palace had completely collapsed.

Many people had already expected this situation.

However, they were still a little surprised when they heard the news from the people on the Blue Moon Planet.

The Dragon Palace’s Dragon King and the others were very powerful and did not give any face to eight barrens.

Before they left, the Dragon Palace’s divine emperor even asked bhang and the others to wash their dog heads.

This caused many bhang disciples to curse on the communication network.

Even if the Dragon Palace became famous in one battle, their bhang strength was only second to the Dragon Palace.

The Dragon Palace was so arrogant and simply did not put them in their eyes.

This made the bhang disciples very dissatisfied and they sent out all kinds of insults to the Dragon Palace.

“Great desolate celestial emperor, Celestial Emperor Shenwu of the imperial court is here to pay his respects!”

At the same time, in a palace on the eight barrens continent, 15 celestial emperors were once again living in the Great Hall.

A protector of the eight barrens entered and reported respectfully.

“Let him in!”

The desolate celestial emperor, who was sitting on the divine deer, said indifferently.

“Greetings, great desolate celestial emperor!”

Soon, Emperor Shenwu of the imperial court entered the hall again. He bowed respectfully with a hint of a smile in his eyes.

“Yes.”

The barren divine emperor nodded and looked at him.

“Sir Barren Divine Emperor, I heard that the Dragon Palace is not willing to take responsibility for the death of the wind destruction divine emperor, and they are extremely arrogant toward bhang. On behalf of the Imperial Court and the Wizard Association, I once again invite bhang to stand on the same side as us.”

God Emperor Shen Wu said directly.

“Our hatred has not reached the point where you will fight to the death with him.”

The god Emperor of desolation looked at him and said faintly.

“A god Emperor was killed. This is a great hatred. However, compared to the hatred between the imperial court and the Wizard Association, it might be weaker. We don’t need all of Bhang’s forces to deal with the Dragon Palace.”

“We are very clear about the strength of the Dragon Palace now. We only need desolate god Emperor to help us. We are confident that we can heavily injure the Dragon Palace. If eight desolation sends out more forces, we are confident that we can completely destroy it.”

God Emperor Shen Wu said with confidence.

In the previous battle, although they had suffered a crushing defeat, they were clear about the strength of the Dragon Palace.

If they could have one more rank two void God Emperor on their side, they had a 100% chance of defeating the Dragon Palace.

It would cause the dragon palace to suffer heavy losses.

With a few more god emperors, they were confident that they could completely destroy the Dragon Palace.

“Oh?”

Desolate god Emperor raised his brows.

“We can guarantee that none of you from the eight desolate region will suffer any injuries.”

Shenwu continued.

“The dragon palace is so stupid. Will they not think of Our Alliance?”

The barren divine emperor said faintly.

“Don’t worry, Sir Barren Divine Emperor. According to my guess, the eight Barrens and the six barrens are far away from the Dragon Palace and the Celestial Wizard Realm. They might not know that I’m here. If I’m not here, there’s almost no chance for us to join forces.”

“There’s another possibility. The Dragon King has a disciple from the holy region by his side. We need to find out if the dragon palace has any relationship with the Holy Region.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Shenwu god Emperor said.

“We’ll discuss the details of the cooperation with the monarch and the wizard in the future.”

The desolate god Emperor pondered for a moment and said.

“It’s the desolate god Emperor.”

A smile appeared on Shenwu God Emperor’s face as he cupped his hands and left.

“Lord desolate, we can easily destroy the Dragon Palace by joining forces with the imperial court. We can also let them know the price they have to pay for offending us!”

After Shenwu Divine Emperor left, an eight barrens divine emperor said coldly.

“We have to make a detailed plan for such a matter. We Can’t take a wrong step.”

The desolate divine emperor said faintly.

The other divine emperors nodded slightly.

This matter was not a small matter. It was related to the life and death of a powerful faction in the resplendent starry sky.

Before they were confident, it was best for the eight barrens not to fall into a battle to the death.

However, in the eyes of the divine emperors, if they were to join forces with the Imperial Court’s Wizard Association, they had at least a 90% chance of destroying the Dragon Palace.

After all, they were the three major factions in the starry sky.

If they could not destroy the Dragon Palace, then the Dragon Palace would be too heaven-defying.

“The Dragon Palace is still too arrogant.”

The desolate divine emperor muttered.

“According to the information leaked by the eight desolate experts, the eight desolate divine emperor said that the Dragon Palace will soon pay a heavy price for killing the eight desolate divine emperor!”

Not long after, a piece of news spread on the communication network in the eight desolate six directions.

Bhang did not continue to make any statements. This was also like a rumor, and not many people believed it.

The entire bhang and six directions were discussing.

“The harvest this time is not bad. After nurturing all these holy feathers, my strength should be able to improve.”

At this moment, in the distant Dragon Palace of the Imperial Star Field, Wang Xian had returned here for quite a while.

Sitting on the dragon throne, Wang Xian looked at the gains in front of him and smiled.

He had obtained all 49 holy feathers and 42 Feng Yu. One of them was a level two void celestial emperor.

Apart from these, there was also the corpse of a Celestial Emperor and three peak-stage celestial kings.

With these corpses, the Dragon Palace could have one more celestial emperor.

“Prime Minister Gui, call the nine wind divine dragons over.”

Wang Xian instructed Prime Minister Gui.

“It’s the Dragon King!”

Prime Minister Gui replied immediately.

“Roar!”

“Greetings, Dragon King!”

Soon, the nine wind divine dragons arrived at the Dragon King’s Hall.

They had green dragon scales and huge dragon wings. This was the only divine dragon among the divine dragons who had dragon wings.

Nine divine dragons were crouching in the Dragon King’s Hall. Their huge bodies contained vast dragon might.

“Absorb these wind jades as soon as possible to increase your strength.”

Wang Xian passed all the wind jades to them.
