Chapter 636: Wet Their Pants (2)

Having sixty percent of the entire Underworld wiped out was such a scary matter.

Those affluent families and tycoons knew something about the Underworld. Even though it might seem far to them, it was, in fact, not the case.

In the face of those compelling Martial Artists, they had always been in reverence of them, not to mention those powerful Ancient Martial Artist Families.

Yet, such a daunting Underworld had sixty percent of its strength massacred by one man.

Massacring sixty percent of the Martial Artists and the ancestral sects of the Underworld. What concept is this?

This was the massive modern massacre. In this peaceful era, killing one or two people was the most heinous criminal.

Then what about the one who dared to kill more than ten thousand people?

Killing one is a sin, but killing thousands is overbearing!

When those tycoons heard the news, they broke into a cold sweat and almost wet their pants.

They were exclaiming that the Underworld was such a scary place.

Hence, they tried to obtain this person’s information through various ties and channels.

Dragon King of Dragon Sect!

Those who had the resources had already gotten a picture of Dragon King to check out his look.

They did it not out of curiosity but more for a precautionary measure.

They could not afford to offend such a domineering existence, not even for the richest man in the country.

No one could do anything even if he killed the top ten moguls in the country.

Not even the government could control such a person!

Those who had the photo kept the face in mind so that they could avoid him at all costs if they ever encountered him.

Yet, all of them present were not expecting they would meet Wang Xian in person on this very day.

Or even encounter such a drama.

The Dragon King actually bought fake tickets?

They could not help but pray for the fellow who had sold the tickets and secretly praise him for his boldness.

That fellow who dared to cheat this man was definitely seeking his own doom.

Apart from the ticket seller, they also took their hats off to several young people who had mocked the Dragon King and his girlfriends.

They were deeply impressed by their ways of seeking quick death.

Those who recognized Wang Xian had constant mixed expressions. One of the middle-aged men were looking even more dreadful.

He was the Director of Heavenly King Media, the famous bachelor and the boss of the largest media company in the country.

As he fixed his eyes on the five young people, especially the guy with the earrings and the pretty girl, he almost wanted to faint.

“Darn!”

He could not help but curse as he felt like crying out.

He remembered clearly the other time when a big shot from the Underworld had called him, saying that one of his artistes had offended the Dragon King.

Upon hearing the news, he almost jumped. Back then, the Dragon King was a colossus.

Compared to the past, the Dragon King had grown even scarier, driving people to the wall.

“Why are those who offended Dragon King all from Heavenly King Media? Darn!” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Director Wang of Heavenly King Media was shaking in his boots.

He was afraid that this brutal Dragon King would slaughter him straight away.

“Shit!”

With a mixed expression, Director Wang bit the bullet, dragging his stiff body over to Wang Xian.

“Dragon...King!”

When Wang Xian wanted to teach the group of young people a lesson after hearing what they said, a sudden cry came from behind.

“Hur?”

“Hur?”

Wang Xian frowned and turned around, fixing his cold eyes on that middle-aged man.

When both the celebrities saw the middle-aged man, they froze for a moment before standing up straight and calling out fervently, “Director Wang!”

Director Wang ignored the two ignorant celebrities and forced a dreadful-looking smile on his face. “Dragon King, I’m Xiao Wang from Heavenly King Media.”

As Director Wang spoke, he wiped away the film of cold sweat on his forehead. “Our damm celebrities have offended you. I’ll give you a satisfactory answer to this. Just leave it to me, and I’ll make sure you’re happy with the outcome. Please do not mind those two useless beggars!”

“What?”

The words that came from Director Wang struck the two celebrities dumb. Unbelievable looks surfaced on their faces.

Their eyes widened when they saw their director lowering his body, humbling himself.

Director Wang was the CEO of a company with a market value worth billions. Now it turned out...

And he even said those kinds of words...

“Dragon King, I have three tickets over here. I hope you don’t mind. Take them, and I’ll get you another three!”

Seeing that Wang Xian did not utter any words, Director Wang hurriedly handed over his admission tickets.

“Hello, Dragon King!”

Just then, all the suited-up middle-aged men walked over with respect. Their voices were soft as they humbled themselves.

All of them held tickets in their hands.

“Dragon King, I have some admission tickets too. Go in with the ladies!”

“Dragon King, I have some too. Here’s for you!”

“Leave those five fellows to me. I’ll take care of them!”

“Yes, leave it to us. Cease your anger, Dragon King!”

After Director Wang of Heavenly King Media walked over, those middle-aged men hesitated before they gritted their teeth and headed over with their tickets.

They were not trying to befriend or curry favors, but rather, they did it out of awe and fear.

Instinctively, they walked over with the admission tickets.

They were not hoping Dragon King could remember them, or asking for any advantages from him. It was purely out of reverence.

At this time, the five young people behind Wang Xian were completely stunned.

The director of Heavenly King Media, the largest media group within the country.

The director of Donghao Group had a market value worth billions!

The Young Master of the Lin Foundation, whose family’s assets were worth hundreds of billions!

The CEO of Mo Cube Technology Company in Modu with a net worth of over ten billion!

Each one of them was a renowned big shot, but now, they were all walking over to that young man respectfully.

All of them humbled themselves and handed over the tickets in their hands.

Every big shot had at least three to four tickets, acting like they were some minions.

What kind of people could strike reverence and fear into them?

However, what they said shook the five young people.

These several big shots said they were just some insignificant damn figures. Leave it to them!

Their eyes dimmed.

What kind of people did they offend or ridicule?

“I just need six tickets and that will do. Thank you!”

Wang Xian extended his hand and thanked them.

“Dragon King, take mine. I’ll handle the five people!”

“Plus mine, Dragon King. Take mine!”

The other middle-aged man and Director Wang hastened to pass the tickets over.

“Well, thank you!”

Wang Xian nodded to the two middle-aged men.

Director Wang and that middle-aged were so happy as though they were some elementary students being praised by their teacher.
