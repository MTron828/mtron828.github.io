Chapter 1547: 1547 suppressing all heaven’s favorites 10

Three “No”came from the mouths of Wu Qingyan and the other two.

The three voices caused everyone around to be slightly stunned, and their faces revealed astonishment.

The smiles in Tian Qingguang and Tian Qingyuan’s eyes immediately froze.

They originally thought that the Crown Prince of Wu Qingcheng, Princess Wu Qingyan, and the others would agree, but they didn’t think that they would actually refuse.

They did not even give face to the two heaven’s favorites of the unitary sect in heaven and earth?

“Brother Wu Qingcheng, you can’t even give face to them?”

When young master Tian and young master di saw that Wu Qingcheng rejected him directly, they frowned slightly and asked coldly with a slightly unpleasant expression.

Wu Qingyan and Wu Qingyan shut their mouths and looked at their brother.

They said that they could not because they did not want to see Wang Xian being attacked by the people of the unitary sect.

They didn’t have any grudges with him to begin with. Moreover, after reading the information, they felt a slight admiration and admiration for Wang Xian.

A Peerless Heaven’s favorite who was less than 30 years old and a young man who had set foot on the vast territory in search of a woman who valued friendship and loyalty. Naturally, they didn’t want him to encounter any bad things.

“It’s not that I don’t want to give face to young master Tian and young master Di!”

Wu Qingcheng looked at Wang Xian who was standing there calmly. His gaze was fixed on the two people in the sky and on the ground.

“Everyone who came today was invited by My Wu Qingcheng. Since they gave me face and came here, My Wu Qingcheng naturally has to ensure their safety!”

“I won’t care if they leave my territory. However, in my territory, everything will be done according to my rules!”

Wu Qingcheng stood there and spoke to everyone with a domineering expression.

He had the right to be so domineering!

This was his territory. As long as he said no, no one could oppose it, not even the two heaven’s favorites from my sect!

Of course, if the target of the two heaven’s and Earth’s attacks was not Wang Xian, Wu Qingcheng would definitely give them face.

However, it was this extremely talented young man, a powerhouse at level seven of the Seethrough realm who was not even thirty years old.

He did not dare to agree because no one present could make that young man stay.

If he were to give face to the two heaven’s favorites from heaven and earth, he would be offending a powerhouse with unlimited potential in the future.

Between the two of them, he knew what to choose.

Therefore, he said no without hesitation. Of course, he had no intention of revealing Wang Xian’s strength.

He was happy to see the conflict between the only sect and an exceptional genius.

“Wu Qing Cheng, we didn’t expect you to be such a principled person!”

Young Master Tian and young master di looked at each other and mocked with a slightly displeased expression.

Since Wu Qing Cheng had already disapproved, they naturally couldn’t continue to attack.

“Hehe, in my territory, no one is allowed to attack. If we attack, it would be disrespecting Wu Qing Cheng!”

“Outside of my residence, I Won’t care what Young Master Tian and young master di want to do!”

Wu Qing Cheng said in an unquestionable tone.

The aura of the imperial court emanated from within.

The name of the Crown Prince lived up to its name!

His aura also caused the disciples of the surrounding factions to show respect on their faces.

“Hehe, even outside of your residence, you can’t care about it!”

Young Master Tian and young master di spoke coldly.

They looked at Wang Xian with a cold look in their eyes. They said faintly, “I will let you live for two more hours. Cherish the last two hours!”

When the surrounding crowd heard the words of the two heaven’s favorites, they stared at Wang Xian with flickering eyes.

“This guy is dead for sure. Even if the crown prince of Wuqing City doesn’t agree to fight here, young master Tian and young master di will make a move immediately after leaving this place!”

“That’s right. With the two young masters of Heaven and earth, they can completely ignore all the rules. I reckon that guy will be killed when he goes out. The He clan and the He Sui clan will not be able to protect him!”

“Who asked that guy to be so arrogant? He actually said that the two young masters of Heaven and earth are trash. He’s simply courting death!”

The surrounding people whispered as they looked at the cold expressions of the two heaven’s favorites of the Solitaire sect in the sky and Earth.

Wu Qing Cheng’s gaze swept over the two of them. A trace of mockery flashed in his eyes. You might not know who you have provoked!

“I’ve said that you are trash. You Are Trash!”

Wang Xian looked at the two heaven’s favorites from the Solitaire sect in the sky and earth and said with disdain. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

How dare he make a Ruckus?

When they saw Wang Xian speaking directly about the two heaven’s favorites from the Solitaire sect in the sky and Earth again, everyone was slightly shocked. They stared at Wang Xian.

Crack! Crack

When the Young Masters of Heaven and earth saw Wang Xian speaking directly about them as trash again, they clenched their fists and let out crisp sounds.

This was the first time, the first time in history, that someone dared to provoke and insult them continuously.

A terrifying murderous aura erupted from the two of them as they charged towards Wang Xian.

“Wu Qing city, give us some face. We can get the lone sect to help you find the heart of Darkness!”

Young Master Tian turned his gaze towards Wu Qing city and spoke coldly again.

Wu Qing Cheng was extremely moved but he still shook his head, “My rules can not be changed. No one can make a move on me!”

“Alright, Alright!”

Young Master Tian and young master di slowly retracted their killing intent and exhaled heavily as they said coldly.

“There is no point in talking anymore. We can wait for two hours!”

The corners of young master Tian’s mouth curled up as a devilish smile appeared on his face.

He wanted to kill someone, personally!

When everyone saw the expression on Prince Tian’s face, they felt a chill in their hearts!

“You guys can afford to wait, but I can’t!”

“I’m sorry, the Crown Prince of Wu Qing city. I Can’t Give You Face!”

However, at this moment, Wang Xian’s voice rang out once again.

When he yuan heard Wang Xian’s words, the corner of his mouth twitched and he shook his head helplessly.

He suiwen revealed a shocked and excited expression.

Wu Qingcheng was stunned. He looked at Wang Xian with a stunned expression. He had a bad premonition in his heart.

“Huh?”

Young Master Tian and young master di turned their eyes to Wang Xian abruptly. There was a hint of astonishment in their eyes.

Everyone around was stunned when they heard this sudden sentence.

“Is the world ruled by me? Hehe?”

At the moment when everyone was stunned, Wang Xian’s laughter rang out once again. He stared at Young Master Tian and young master di with disdain in his eyes.

“All of you are just ants in my eyes!”

As he spoke, he waved the staff of light in his hand. Two incomparably resplendent palms of light attacked young master Tian and young master di directly.

At this moment, everyone felt that this priest Wang had gone mad!

“He... he actually dared to attack young master Tian and young master Di!”

“He actually didn’t give face to the crown prince of Wuqing City and actually attacked!”

“Is this guy a Madman?”
