Chapter 3832 3031 invincible power, Void Spirit treasured land!

“Weng!”

“Oh no!”

At the passage between the belief universe and the starry universe!

A middle-aged God from the Heavenly Palace sat there with his eyes closed. Suddenly, he opened his eyes and revealed an embarrassed expression.

“Oh?”

The old woman looked at him and frowned slightly.

“The people from the Black Codex Treasured Land are dead again!”

The middle-aged gods said with a gloomy face.

He picked up a faith communication stone plate and immediately sent a message.

“Dead again?”

The old woman frowned slightly.

In the surrounding area, the other gods of the 24 palaces also received the news, their eyes shining.

“Before they died, they didn’t sense that some space beast killed them. It seems that the strength of that space beast is at least at the level of a ruler at level six, or maybe even at level seven or eight.”

Not far away, a group of gods who believed in the universe spoke up!

“Pass the message down. Temporarily declare the Black Codex Treasure land a forbidden area and don’t Go There!”

The middle-aged gods said helplessly.

More than 40 level 7 gods had been killed there in succession. The space of the Black Codex Treasure land was no longer something they could deal with!

Now, they could only give it up and make it a forbidden land!

Otherwise, they wouldn’t be able to bear any more losses!

“The Starry Universe, after all, is still the domain of the Space Beasts!”

One of the gods sighed. With their strength, they didn’t dare to enter the starry universe.

Because the space beasts would chase after them.

At that time, a space beast that controlled level eight and level nine would be able to kill them.

If they didn’t have a life-saving true treasure, they wouldn’t be able to escape!

Therefore, there might be a terrifying space beast in the Black Scripture treasured land, and they couldn’t do anything about it.

They could only make that place a forbidden area, so that the gods wouldn’t go there.

“This time, our heavenly palace suffered quite a heavy loss. Fortunately, we were completely at an advantage in the war with the nine-origin universe. We managed to recruit many believers who came to save the Universe!”

The old woman spoke to the middle-aged man as a faint smile appeared on her face.

The middle-aged man nodded his head.

Good news kept coming from their war with the nine-origin Universe!T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

…

“They’re not coming?”

For the next ten years, Wang Xian had been hiding in the sky above the black scripture treasured land.

More than ten years had passed, and the Gods of faith had never come again.

This made him smile.

Just as he had predicted, the successive losses made them afraid to send more powerhouses over.

“They should be really afraid. In that case, they can leave now. There has been a lot of news from the northern frost eight Qi.”

Wang Xian mumbled.

Recently, although he had been staying here, the eight-headed demon and the others had been searching for the gods who believed in the universe.

Moreover, once they found them, with the five elements millstone, they could kill them instantly!

During this period of time, using the five elements millstone, the eight-headed demon and the others had also killed thousands of gods who believed in the universe.

“Let’s Go!”

Wang Xian sensed the location of the great mill of five elements. With a move of his body, he immediately flew towards the great mill of five elements.

A year later, Wang Xian met up with the Northern Frost Demonic Fiend, eight-limbed demonic fiend, and the rest!

“Master!”

“Dragon King!”

The Northern Frost eight-limbed demonic fiend and the rest shouted at Wang Xian excitedly!

Recently, their gains were extremely huge!

With so many resources, it wouldn’t be long before they achieved a breakthrough!

“Bei Shuang, you guys can leave now. Return to the Dragon Palace and continue to improve your strength!”

Wang Xian looked at them and said!

The main reason they were here was to temper themselves and gain a deeper understanding of the gods in the universe.

If they were to say that they could be of much help, they couldn’t.

They were still too weak!

“Also, I have a large number of faith hearts here. Bring them back!”

As Wang Xian spoke, he set up a devil spirit altar at the side. An Lie’s figure appeared very quickly!

“Alright, Dragon King.”

Bei Shuang and the rest nodded.

They knew that they were weak, especially here, where there were experts who believed in the universe everywhere.

After bei Shuang and the rest left, Wang Xian moved his palm and kept the five elements millstone before flying to the left.

According to the information that bei Shuang and the rest obtained, there were many experts who believed in the universe over there!

Hiding in the Void, Wang Xian flew all the way over there.

Only level eight gods could detect him by relying on the concealment ability of the Tai Chi Dragon Disk.

In addition, he might also possess an extremely powerful detection-type treasure.

However, it was obvious that a level eight pantheon would not be able to enter the starry universe!

Therefore, Wang Xian was basically invincible against the belief universe and the nine-origin universe here! Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐velbin(.)com

After flying for a few years, Wang Xian saw dozens of the gods of the belief universe flying in front of him!

His body moved and came directly to his side.

“Soul capture!”

Before they could react, he instantly controlled it.

Streams of information were transmitted into his mind.

“24 palaces Decree Palace, virtual spirit treasured land!”

Wang Xian received a piece of news, and his eyes sparkled.

Believing in the 24 palaces of the universe, they sent a large number of gods into the starry universe.

During these millions of years, they found many treasure lands in the starry universe!

These treasure lands were occupied by them, increasing their strength!

The Void Spirit Treasure Land was a powerful treasure land that the decree palace had just found.

This void spirit treasure land was a treasure land that could increase one’s soul!

The power of belief involved the power of the soul.

A place that could increase one’s soul was naturally an extremely powerful treasure land for the gods of belief.

They could use the soul power contained in that place to create soul armors through their special methods!

They could create soul battle spirits!

They could use the power of their faith and some battle techniques to create soul battle spirits, forming an extremely powerful battle subordinate.

It was just like the Dark Ghost clones of the Dark Clan.

They could use their special methods to create a special dark ghost avatar!

Other than that, they could also create armor with extremely powerful defense.

Currently, this void spirit treasured land was the most powerful treasured land occupied by the 24 palaces of the Faith Universe!

This treasured land was occupied by the Decree Palace. However, in order to obtain this place, more than a dozen palaces had worked together to kill the powerful space beast that occupied this place and then occupied it!

At that time, more than ten palaces had sent out over a thousand level seven gods!

Over a thousand such powerful existences had occupied this place. One could imagine the experts guarding this space beast.

One could also imagine how important this place was to the belief of the universe gods!
