Chapter 1382: 1382 was shocked by the gilded gold clan

“Lord, we thank the Gilded Gold clan for taking us in!”

Near the 10,000 meter mountain peak, in front of the forging rooms, the fire hammer clan leader respectfully stood in front of a middle-aged man dressed in luxurious clothes.

Beside the fire hammer clan leader, Duan Jinming stood by the side, his expression somewhat ugly!

“Fire Hammer clan, I think you’re courting death. If you leave carefree city, you might become slaves. We took you in, but you still don’t know what’s good for you!”

The luxurious middle-aged man stared at them with an ugly expression and said coldly.

The Fire Hammer clan had an extraordinary eighth rank bloodline. Logically speaking, their clan’s strength wasn’t too weak.

They could easily survive in any city.

However, their forging techniques were too famous. In addition, they belonged to the Demonic Beast clan. Many evil forces wanted to control them.

There was once when the entire fire hammer clan became slaves. Half of the original five thousand clansmen died.

The Fire Hammer clan was extremely united. After escaping time and time again, they met the gilded gold clan by chance.

Although the Gilded Gold clan didn’t treat them very well, at least they didn’t enslave them. They even gave them some spirit stones, which was considered good.

Of course, this was only good compared to their previous life.

If it was based on the value of the items they forged, it wasn’t worth mentioning at all.

“Lord, we have already made up our minds. We hope that Lord will fulfill our wish. Today’s work has been completed!”

The Fire Hammer tribe leader bowed and said again.

“Duan Yan Lie, you have to think carefully. It’s not easy for a lowly race to survive outside!”

The middle-aged man’s eyes flashed with a cold light, and his tone was full of threat.

“We have already thought it through. I’ll tell you one more thing, we are not a lowly race!”

Duan Jinming stared at the middle-aged man coldly and said loudly.

“Hehe, I can guarantee that the moment you step out of Xiaoyao City, you will immediately become slaves!”

The middle-aged man stared at Duan Jinming coldly.

“Who dares? who dares to make us slaves!”

The furious Duan Jinming’s body instantly surged with the power of the profound void tier.

“What... You... you...”

The luxurious middle-aged man widened his eyes, his expression changing drastically as he stared at Duan Jinming.

“Let’s go, Jin Ming. Let’s pack our things and lead our clansmen away!”

The fire hammer clan leader tugged at his clothes.

Their fire hammer clan was not slaves to begin with, so they could naturally leave freely.

“Profound void tier expert, that lowly fellow actually became a profound void tier expert... this... this...”

He widened his eyes and stared at Duan Jinming’s figure with an extremely unsightly expression.

“This won’t do. I must report this matter to the clan head immediately!”

His expression changed slightly and he immediately walked towards the gilded gold clan’s manor.

The Fire Hammer clan was an incomparably cheap labor force to the entire gilded gold clan.

Although the fire hammer clan was unable to refine high grade weapons, they were able to perfectly refine transcendent third, fourth, fifth, and sixth grade weapons.

Moreover, regardless of whether it was the success rate or the degree of refinement, they were all stronger than ordinary blacksmiths.

Most importantly, they didn’t need to pay much spirit stones.

Now that the Fire Hammer clan had left, it could be considered a considerable loss to the gilded gold clan. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Also, the matter of that fire hammer clan brat becoming a profound void martial expert had to be reported immediately.

The Gilded Gold clan, as a clan whose weapon region was second only to the Liu clan, had a huge manor.

In the entire gilded gold clan, there were six or seven insightful emptiness realm experts!

In the study room of the clan leader, a luxurious middle-aged man hurried over.

“What did you say? The members of the Fiery Hammer clan are leaving? And a kid from the fiery hammer clan has broken through to the insightful emptiness realm?”

In the study, a middle-aged man dressed in fiery red clothes sat in the middle, with a woman beside him.

When he heard the report from his subordinate, the middle-aged man dressed in fiery red clothes immediately stood up and shouted with a face full of surprise.

“Yes, clan head, one hundred percent is a profound void tier powerhouse. That kid... Even I can’t believe it!”

The luxurious middle-aged man also reported with a face full of surprise.

“That Kid? You mean that kid called Duan Jinming?”

The eyes of the gilded gold family’s master flickered. “That Kid’s bloodline seems to belong to the phenomenon of atavism...”

“HMM? Is it that kid who wants to be a toad and eat swan meat?”

The woman at the side was also full of astonishment and slightly widened her eyes.

“It’s that kid who wants to pursue third miss!”

The luxurious middle-aged man immediately nodded.

“He actually broke through to the insightful emptiness realm. I don’t know what kind of opportunity he got, or is it the power from his bloodline!”

The middle-aged man of the gilded gold family showed a thoughtful expression. “It seems that we have to face that kid properly!”

“Brother Hai, don’t tell me you agree with Yanyan and that kid... No, I told Mrs. Liu some time ago. Mrs. Liu said that their son has a very good impression of Yanyan and said that he will come to our family to propose marriage!”

The woman at the side shook her head and quickly said.

“What? Madam Liu really wants to come to our house to propose marriage?”

The head of the gilded gold family was slightly stunned and quickly asked expectantly.

“I can still lie to you. Tonight, I will bring Yanyan to the Liu residence. This matter will definitely be successful!”

The woman said with some pride.

“Haha, Good, good. If we can form a marriage alliance with the Liu Residence, our gilded gold family will have no worries in a few hundred years!”

The Gilded Gold clan leader laughed happily. He looked at the middle-aged man in front of him and narrowed his eyes slightly. “Send someone to follow the fire hammer clan first!”

“Yes, clan leader!”

The luxurious middle-aged man immediately nodded.

...

“Eh, isn’t that the Fire Hammer Demon Beast Clan? What are they doing with so many clansmen?”

“The Fire Hammer Demon Beast clan is very good at refining weapons, but it’s a pity that their bloodline is too low. Their powerful talent in refining weapons makes them guilty of possessing treasures. In the past, they were often enslaved!”

“They’re just a lowly race. Even if their talent in crafting weapons is strong, they can only craft some low-level weapons at most!”

In the evening, when Wang Xian and more than 2,000 members of the Fire Hammer clan walked onto the streets, some of the people in the surroundings whispered in astonishment when they saw so many members of the fire hammer clan.

The fire hammer clan could be considered to be somewhat famous. However, the bloodline level of this race was too low, so no one thought highly of them.

“Humph, it won’t be long before we become a powerful clan!”

The members of the Fire Hammer clan heard the discussions around them. If it was before, they would have completely ignored them.

However, when they heard the words of the clan leader and Duan Jinming this evening, their ambitions were aroused.

Who said that we are a lowly clan? According to that Lord’s words, every one of us has the chance to become a powerhouse in the future!

This made all the members of the Fire Hammer clan look forward to the day when they could rise up. They would definitely not allow others to call them a lowly race.

They would definitely not let others look down on them!

“Dragon King, it’s just up ahead. We have rented a large-scale manor. If the members of our clan squeeze together, they will be able to stay!”

The fire hammer clan leader walked beside Wang Xian and spoke softly.
