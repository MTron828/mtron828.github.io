Chapter 821: 0822 Battle of dragons and snakes 3

Translator: 549690339

Out of the nine heads, the one in the middle was the largest. It was different from the five-headed snake. The nine heads of the eight-headed snake were slightly different.

Some of the heads were decayed as if they were corroded by a powerful poison.

The nine heads were all emitting terrifying demonic flames. In this area surrounded by the green and black poisonous water, the eight-headed snake was like a world-destroying snake.

Wang Xian moved his body and attacked Ba Qi at a terrifying speed. The rest of the members of the Dragon Palace also moved.

Among them, three flood dragons attacked the five-headed snake directly.

“Damn it, Dragon King, let’s fight one-on-one if you have the guts!”

When the nine-headed snake saw nearly twenty immortals attacking him, including the Dragon King, a superior immortal, its eyes revealed a hint of embarrassment.

“One-on-one. If you lose in a one-on-one fight, so what?”

Wang Xian’s face turned cold. The six flood dragons immediately came to the opposite position and blocked the Hydra’s route.

“If I want to escape, you can’t Stop Me!”

The three heads stared at Wang Xian’s position while the rest of the heads scanned their surroundings. Their blood-red eyes were sparkling.

“Unless you hide on land, you won’t be able to hide in the ocean!”

A cold smile appeared on Wang Xian’s face as he stared at the snake and said in a deep voice.

“I really didn’t Expect Your Dragon King’s influence to be so strong. Half a year ago, you only revealed 18 immortals. Now, you have more than 20 of them.”

The eight-headed snake glanced at the members of the Dragon Palace with fear in its heart.

“If you submit to me and join the Dragon Palace, I can spare your life!”

Wang Xian stared at the eight-headed Hydra and said coldly.

“Don’t even think about it. How can I, the eight-headed Hydra, become someone else’s subordinate? I Am a God who is high and mighty.”

The nine-headed Hydra’s huge head twisted and opened its largest mouth. It roared in unison.

“Since that’s the case, kill!”

Wang Xian moved his body and a terrifying flame quickly condensed in the air. He attacked the eight-headed Hydra directly.

“Among the gods, I am invincible!”

The head in the middle roared loudly. One of the heads on its left opened its huge mouth and a stream of black liquid met the flame directly.

Sizzle! Sizzle! Sizzle

The sound of burning could be heard. Wang Xian’s expression did not change as he flew over directly.

Boom! Boom! Boom

At this moment, the mountain under the eight-headed Hydra cracked open. Numerous terrifying tails swept toward Wang Xian directly.

The nine tails came with an intense whistling sound and arrived in an instant.

Wang Xian raised his dragon claws to meet them. Earth shields appeared around his body to block the attacks of the other tails.

“Crackle!” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Boom! Boom!”

At the side, streaks of lightning emitted blue rays in the pitch-black poisonous water space. Ao Qitian and two demonic monkeys of the immortal level turned the ocean-pacifying divine needle into the size of 50 meters and smashed it towards the three heads.

“Hiss, hiss, hiss!”

A corroded tongue moved, and the entire area of black seawater suddenly surrounded the lightning.

“BZZT, BZZT, bzzt!”

A scalp-numbing sound was heard, and the bolts of lightning were actually corroded by the poisonous liquid.

“Hiss, hiss, this is my territory. Here, I can unleash 150% of my strength. Dragon King, I advise you to get out of our territory, or else I’ll start a massacre!”

The cold voice of the corroded head rang out.

“Whoosh, Whoosh, Whoosh!”

However, what responded to it were white shadows. Five White Shadows appeared at the position of its body, and a terrifying claw directly cut open its huge skin and flesh.

The five white shadows left five ten-meter-long wounds, each of which was about a meter deep.

“Roar! Damn it!”

The two heads let out an angry roar. The surrounding venom surged toward the spot where they were injured.

The wounds healed at a speed visible to the naked eye.

“What?”

Ao Yao and the four subordinates were shocked.

“What a terrifying recovery ability!”

Wang Xian squinted his eyes slightly. His Dragon Claw grabbed a tail that was swinging toward him.

Crack! Crack

The powerful and sharp dragon claw slowly penetrated one of the eight-headed dragon’s tails.

Roar

The eight-headed dragon was in pain. Its nine mouths were wide open and could easily swallow an elephant.

The terrifying demonic flames attacked them directly.

Demonic Flames were different from flames. Demonic Flames had the effects of corrosion and Poison. Coupled with the surrounding poison, the demonic flames were even more powerful.

However, the current Wang Xian was almost at the peak of the upper-level immortal. Furthermore, he was a divine dragon of the five elements.

“Water blast wave!”

Wang Xian’s body trembled. The seawater outside surged violently as he rushed towards the area of the poison.

“I have used a formation to seal this area. It’s wishful thinking if I want to disperse the poison here. I’m practically an immortal being here!”

Ba Qi didn’t care about the injuries on his body at all. He was a hundred meters tall and had nine heads. It would be extremely difficult to kill him.

Furthermore, with his life force, he could definitely exhaust his opponent to death!

The powerful seawater rushed over but the poison didn’t leak out at all. Wang Xian frowned slightly.

He didn’t expect this Hydra to know about formations.

“You won’t die? Let’s see how you won’t die after I’ve absorbed all the Venom Here!”

Wang Xian’s body moved for a while, and his entire body slowly turned green. With a wave of his dragon claw, seeds were sprinkled around him.

“Ten thousand poison seeds!”

Ten thousand poison seeds were a bunch of precious seeds obtained from the Holy Doctor and Holy Medicine sect.

These seeds were also used by wood attribute cultivators to fight.

The sect of Holy Medicine and Holy Medicine had a few immortals who mainly used poisonous trees to attack with various poisonous plants.

The 10,000 poisonous seeds were one of them. The more toxins they absorbed, the stronger they would be!

The dense azure dragon energy entered the seeds directly. The 10,000 poisonous seeds grew at a terrifying speed.

In just a short second, thousands of white vines that were thousands of meters long appeared in the surroundings.

The venom in the surroundings had obviously become much thinner.

“Damn it!”

The blood-red pupils of the eight-headed snake changed. Five of its heads instantly attacked Wang Xian.

“Hehe!”

He shouted coldly. Numerous poisonous vines were rapidly wrapping around the eight-headed snake.

“Get lost!”

Its two tails met the dense vines directly.

“Pa Pa Pa!”

The vines were soft and coiled around the body of the eight-headed snake.

“Wood fire mass concealment!”

Wood fire mass concealment was a combined battle technique of the two great immortal sects. When the two fused together, it could unleash twice the amount of terrifying attacks.

“Hong!”

In an instant, raging flames burned. The most terrifying thing was that the burning flames of the vines crazily drilled into the body of the eight-headed snake.

“Ah Ah Ah, bastard!”

Ba Qi let out a miserable cry and twisted its huge body.

The terrifying flames were burning at the bottom of the sea, covering its three tails.

Under the siege of the members of the Dragon Palace, the four heads could only defend passively.

The remaining heads and tails that were fighting against Wang Xian only had 60% of their peak combat strength.

The gap between them and Wang Xian was too big!
