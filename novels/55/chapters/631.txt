Chapter 632: Enhance Development

Establishing an underwater dynasty, and civilization!

Establishing a sea region under the jurisdiction of the Dragon Palace dynasty, and the Dragon Palace would be the Emperor Palace.

Wang Xian could never think of such a thing or even dare to think that way.

This was an establishment of a new Kingdom, proclaiming him to be a real King.

Even after Wang Xian obtained the system and set up a Dragon Palace, he had never thought of building an empire or a civilization as a modern person.

Yet, Prime Minister Turtle suggested he established one.

Wang Xian remained silent with a constant mixed expression. But the radiance in his eyes glowed brighter and brighter.

“Oceans occupy seventy percent of the Earth’s surface with races existing in the underwater world. But, there isn’t a real civilization in the sea just like the one on Earth!

“We can establish the first underwater civilization, the first empire. Those who defy our wish will be exterminated while the rest will become our subjects!

“Gather all the resources in the sea for the establishment of the civilization. We will take control of the myriad races in the sea. Even if we can only control a portion of them, we can still command them!

“The unlimited marine creatures will be our eyes, servicing us with the information that we need!

“Besides, we can set up our Dragon Gate. Whoever from the countless marine races that succeeds in leaping over the Dragon Gate will become our General of Dragon Sect. This could help us select and recruit talents!” said Prime Minister Turtle to Wang Xian with excitement.

“Carry on!”

Wang Xian closed his eyes as he sank in his Dragon Throne.

“Currently, we only have the Devil Division, Dragon Guard Division, and over two hundred Anomalocaris. During wars, there are various components such as formations, infantry, cavalry, archers. I think our members should be able to perform attacks, defense, close and remote attacks, air and land strikes and support.” There was a beam of wisdom in Prime Minister Turtle’s eyes. “Not only this, but we also need to complement the attributes of the members in Dragon Palace. In the event that we need to conquer or deal with more powerful enemies, our formations will greatly enhance our combat capacity!

“Among the nine attributes of the Divine Dragon, Metal, Earth, Wind, Thunder, and Darkness are better in close-ranged fights whilst Wood, Water, Fire, and Light are good in remote fights. We can assign different roles accordingly to the members during battles!

“Lastly, we need to have wise civil subjects. They can be weak, but they must have strong analytical abilities and see things in a macro way. This would greatly benefit us in terms of territory management and warfare!”

Prime Minister Turtle slowly spoke while Wang Xian heaved a heavy breath.

Establishing a real dynasty with its own territory and officials.

The benefits of establishing an underwater dynasty were huge.

As for wars, he also thought about the soldiers, ranged, support, and scouts.

However, it was only a vague idea that Wang Xian had in mind. Now, Prime Minister Turtle actually mentioned all these with a proper system.

“The establishment of an underwater dynasty is not an overnight event,” Wang Xian murmured.

“Dragon King, we can make preparations first. At present, the Dragon Palace is the strongest within a radius of thousand miles. We can first unify the marine races, and cultivate generals from them. Every general of the marine races could rule those lower-levels beings of the same kind. Then we’ll make them leap over the Dragon Gate. Those who are able to enter Dragon Palace will be groomed as the soldiers of Dragon Palace. The best thing is, we can manage our territory better and get hold of the updates within it if we had them in control!” said Prime Minister Turtle to Wang Xian.

“Great, you’ll handle this now. Get Roving Heavens, Roving Yaksha, nine Venomous Sea Snakes, Anomalocaris, Roving Lobster, and Roving Girl over here now!”

Wang Xian nodded his head and commanded Prime Minister Turtle.

“Yes, Dragon King. I’ll bring them over now!”

Prime Minister Turtle nodded his head. With a whizz, all of them rushed over.

“Dragon King!”

A group of Level 12 members bowed to Wang Xian, who was sitting on the Dragon Throne. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“From now on, all of you shall listen to Prime Minister Turtle’s commands when I’m not around. Cooperate with him as he’s our majordomo from now on!” Wang Xian ordered.

“Yes, Dragon King!”

Roving Heavens and the rest immediately nodded respectfully.

“Thank you, Dragon King. From now on, I’ll be preparing to set up a team of wise civil officials!” said Prime Minister Turtle, kneeling down.

“Sure. If you need any books, look for Mo Qinglong, and he’ll get them for you!”

Wang Xian nodded.

“Yes, Dragon King!”

“Next, Prime Minister Turtle will make plans on how to expand our territory and get more resources. I’ll leave this to you!”

“Yes, Dragon King!”

“The rest of you keep cultivating. Now, take your leave!”

“Yes!”

The so-called first court meeting ended with Prime Minister Turtle and the members taking their leave.

Wang Xian chuckled as he felt more and more competent as a Dragon King.

He had no worries about the development of Dragon Palace since Prime Minister Turtle was around to save him the troubles.

He could also leave all the things to the Dragon Sect members who were a hundred percent loyal to him.

For the next few days, Wang Xian stayed in the Dragon Palace, waiting for the awakening of Guan Shuqing.

There was no day and night at Dragon Palace. When Adjaya and the rest were tired from their cultivation, they would return to the Royal Residence Hall and rest.

Wang Xian would definitely not miss the chance for a round of love-making.

During these few days, he was leading a relaxing life.

“So beautiful!”

After the love session, Lan Qingyue came to the door of the Royal Residence Hall and cast her gaze outside. There was a look of surprise on her face.

“The sea regions within a radius of a thousand miles have been conquered by the Dragon Palace!”

Wang Xian saw that the densely-packed marine creatures around the Dragon Palace were looking over in their direction in awe.

The number of the surrounding marine creatures was in the billions.

If he could devour all these marine creatures, he could definitely gain an immense amount of Dragon Energy.

However, doing this, it was impossible for him to level up. Besides, these marine creatures were of great use.

Under the gaze of Wang Xian, these marine creatures began their challenge of Dragon Gate.

Their eyes were burning with fire as their natural instinct took over.

After leaping over the Dragon Gate, they would have a completely different life then.

Wang Xian smiled as he watched. He may not understand how to manage a country, but he knew that these marine creatures could increase the strength of the Dragon Palace by many folds.

Those who successfully leaped over the Dragon Gate were all domineering existences.

Even in the universe, they could be considered as wicked ones.

And that is if they continue to work hard!

“Dragon King, there are thirty marine creatures that leaped over the Dragon Gate this time.”

More than ten hours later, Prime Minister Turtle came to report to Wang Xian after the Dragon Gate challenge was completed.

“Only thirty out of tens of billions, that’s one out of ten billion!”

Wang Xian shook his head.

“Dragon King, we have more than these billions of marine creatures in the waters near us. Those who came today were only from one of the batches. After all the marine creatures complete the challenge, I believe our strength will grow by more than one hundred members!”
