3819 The 3818 cursed dragon killed the level seven space behemoth! Go

Boom! Boom! Boom

The Space Behemoth, which was the ruler of a level six space behemoth, erupted with a terrifying energy when it devoured all the space behemoths of the same race as well as the meatball!

This energy rose rapidly, causing Wang Xian and the rest to look fearful.

Lan qingyue held a grayish chain in one hand. The chain wound around the grayish long spear and attacked the space behemoth directly.

However, just as she was about to reach the space beast, a blood ball formed into a shield!

Buzz

The spear landed on it and was slowly devoured by it.

“Not good, Xiao Xian. This space beast is undergoing a transformation. It seems to be about to break through!”

Seeing this scene, Lan Qingyue felt its terrifying power. Her expression changed drastically as she exclaimed!

At this moment, Wang Xian’s expression also changed!

In the universe, a level seven cosmic beast was comparable to the nine-origin universe. It was an existence at the peak of the universe’s ruler.

Wang Xian was very strong with the help of the Five Elements Millstone and the Tai Chi Dragon Disk.

Lan Qingyue and the rest were also very strong.

However, even if they joined forces, they were still not a match for a level seven cosmic beast.

Especially after this space beast had improved, its strength and attack power were extremely strange!

“Retreat!”

Wang Xian made a prompt decision and shouted at LAN Qingyue immediately!

Without any hesitation, they immediately flew backward.

The upgraded Space Beast was able to kill Wang Xian and the rest one by one!

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

At this moment, an incomparably violent roar was emitted from the Space Beast’s mouth!

At the lower position, the substance that looked like flesh and blood actually started to move.

One after another, claws attacked Wang Xian and the rest.

“Tai Chi Dragon Plate!”

“Five elements grinding!”

“Defend!”

Wang Xian immediately unleashed all his defenses!

“Wu Wu Wu!”

“Wu Wu Wu!”

Xiao Bai and the rest let out a wild roar and opened their mouths.

At this moment, Xiao Bai’s body suddenly shrunk a lot.

Little House swallowed its body into his mouth.

Lan Qingyue’s body moved and came into Little White’s mouth.

This scene was like a big kun calling out to Little Kun.

Lan Qingyue was in the center.

Ultimate Defense!

This kind of defense was the most powerful defense of the ancient god Feeding Kun Lord!

Overlapping, defense!

“Little Xian, come to me!”

Lan qingyue shouted!

Wang Xian moved and flew over immediately.

Boom! Boom! Boom

In the next second, the claws collided with the five elements grinding tai chi dragon plate and the defense of LAN Qingyue and the rest.

An impact force was transmitted, and their bodies flew forward instantly.

“Escape immediately!”

Wang Xian ordered!

Without any hesitation, the small house fled into the distance quickly!

Lan qingyue waved her arm and waves of energy surged into the small house’s body to strengthen it.

“I really didn’t expect this space beast to be able to complete such a terrifying transformation, devouring and becoming stronger!”

Wang Xian looked behind him and his expression turned ugly!

“Roar! Roar! Roar!”

“Roar! Roar!”

Seeing that his first round of attack was blocked, the Space Beast’s eyes were bloodshot as he stared at Wang Xian and the rest. He quickly chased after them!

“This won’t do. This fellow’s speed is very fast!”

Wang Xian looked behind him. His expression darkened as he spoke.

The Space Beast was comparable to the pinnacle level of the nine-origin universe. Under such circumstances, even the strongest experts from the various peak races could only fight against it!

Unless they used their trump cards, they would be able to kill it.

Such an existence was not something Wang Xian and the rest could fight against!

Of course, if Wang Xian absorbed all the resources to improve himself, he could still fight against it with his many trump cards.

However, he had no way to fight back now.

Without the speed of the incipient saint wings, he had no way to fight back!

“Roar!”

At this moment, the space beast suddenly opened its mouth and spat out a space beast phantom that was exactly the same as it.

The Shadow of the space beast emitted a terrifying energy aura.

Wang Xian and the rest were in front of them. When they felt this energy, their expressions froze!

The five elements grinding and the tai chi dragon disc had unleashed their defense to the maximum!

The bodies of Xiao Zhai, Xiao Bai, and Lan qingyue emitted a grayish energy.

Boom

A terrifying vibration was transmitted over. Wang Xian could instantly sense that the tai chi dragon disc had collapsed!

He couldn’t even use the backlash!

“Oh no!”

His expression changed slightly!

Fortunately, although the Taiji Dragon Plate had collapsed, they managed to withstand this attack.

But what about the next attack?

“Xiao Xian, this space beast is catching up. He’s very fast!”

Lan Qingyue said anxiously.

“Hang in there and see if we can get rid of this guy!”

Wang Xian gritted his teeth. For such a powerful existence to be born in this precious land, it must be extraordinary!

Wang Xian had to get his hands on it.

He took out his communication stone plate and immediately contacted an lie, sending him a message!

An lie immediately replied when he received the message!

Wang Xian quickly set up a demonic altar in front of him!

“Eh? Xiao Xian, what are you doing?”

Lan Qingyue looked at him with her eyes gleaming.

“It’s not very effective against the intelligent angels and Phoenixes. However, our Dragon Palace has a great weapon against the space beasts without intelligence!”

Wang Xian growled in a low voice!

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz

As soon as he finished his sentence, an Lie’s figure appeared in front of him.

Other than an intense, there were also many black figures.

The aura of each black figure wasn’t very strong, but it was very strange.

This was the cursed dragon!

The cursed dragon that had turned into a curse!

The cursed dragon had many strengths, and its attacking methods were also very weak.

There was no strength that could surpass one’s cultivation level.

At the peak of the venerable realm, in terms of combat strength, it was definitely the weakest!

However, the strength of the cursed dragon didn’t lie in its own combat power, but in the cursed power that was killed!

The cursed creature was an existence that even a ruler realm expert didn’t want to provoke.

The backlash of the cursed creature was enough to kill an ordinary ruler realm expert!

Although the space beast in front of them was comparable to a peak 9-origin universe ruler, the cursed dragon of the Dragon Palace wasn’t something an ordinary cursed creature could compare to.

Their curses were even more terrifying and powerful.

This was the only great killing weapon in the Dragon Palace.

Of course, this great killing weapon was slightly more useless!

This was because all the powerhouses in the nine-origin universe could sense the cursed power of the cursed dragon. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

They would not be stupid enough to kill the cursed dragon. They would transfer it to.

This was also the reason why Wang Xian did not order it to deal with the angel and Phoenix clans.

That was because it was not very useful!

However, it could be used to deal with the space behemoths in the starry universe!

Tens of thousands of cursed dragons appeared in front of Wang Xian and the rest, flapping their wings!

They were waiting for the order!
