Chapter 173: Jewelry Stand-Off

Translator: Larbrestudio Editor: Larbrestudio

“Brother, do you want to buy this painting?” Xiao Yu looked at Wang Xian shockingly in Suite 13.

“Nope!” Wang Xian shook his head.

“Then why are you bidding on it?” Xiao Yu threw him a stunned look.

“He just irks me!” Wang Xian said with a smiling face.

Xiao Yu and Elder Fang looked at Wang Xian, speechless.

“$50 million. Does anyone want to bid any further?”

This time, an elderly man’s voice was heard. Wang Xian looked and realized that many people were casting their glances over their sides.

Wang Xian gave a playful look and stopped his bid.

Since Liu Fei Yun was so determined to get that calligraphy, Wang Xian purposely raised the bid to annoy him.

Liu Fei Yun wanted to save his face. As long as the Liu Family’s reputation was concerned, he would not let go easily.

Wang Xian took this as an advantage to up the price.

“Congratulations to Little Sword Celestial for winning the auction for Li Bai’s authentic calligraphy. I hope Young Master Liu can obtain the Sword Celestial’s inheritance!”

When the elderly man on the auction table saw that Suite 13 gave up bidding, he knocked on the table and gave a final confirmation.

Liu Fei Yun was not as thrilled as just now even though he’d won the auction. His face turned glum, and he went silent.

He might have gotten the authentic Li Bai calligraphy, but he spent an additional $25 million and got a slap in his face. Naturally, he was in a bad mood.

One by one, the items were auctioned away. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Next on the list, a tuft of Level 2 Spiritual Medicine Renling Leaves of 500 years. After consumption, it could enhance body strength and strengthen body skin. This was the famous Foundation Building Spiritual Medicine. The auction began from a base price of $15 million!”

“Level 2 Spirit Medicine is beneficial to your current cultivation. I will bid on it for you!”

Elder Fang stared at the auction item again with an unwavering expression. She immediately increased the bid to $20 million.

“$20 million!”

“$21 million!”

“$22 million!”

The competition for Level 2 Spiritual Medicine was better than those antiques. The number of competitors reached a dozen instantly.

“$30 million!”

Elder Fang was not surprised by this situation. When the bid hit $28 million, she increased to $30 million immediately.

“The price of $30 million has already surpassed the value of Level 2 Spiritual Medicine.”

“$30 million? Forget it. It’s too expensive.”

“Spending $30 million for a tuft of Renling Leaves is not worth it at all. After all, it’s only useful to Level four and five Martial Artist!”

When the price hit $30 million, the individual families and sects shook their heads slowly. $30 million was beyond its own value.

Elder Fang did not feel the pain for such a price that surpassed its own value. Since it was for the cultivation of Xiao Yu, it was worth it.

“Suite 13 bid $30 million. Is there any higher price?” the elderly man stood on the stage and asked everyone.

“Suite 13!”

Cold radiance flashed in Liu Fei Yun’s eyes. He cast a glance upstairs and sneered.

“$31 million!”

“Young Master Liu bid $31 million. Any more bidders?”

Liu Fei Yun’s bid slightly stunned the elderly man. Subsequently, he drew a smile on his face.

“The other party bid $30 million. They should be determined to get this tuft of Spiritual Leaves. Young Master Liu is upping the price.”

“Looks like Young Master Liu bears a grudge against Suite 13 from when they raised his bid just now. This is revenge!”

“People from Suite 13 were ignorant. Provoking Young Master Liu is not a wise choice!”

When the crowd saw Liu Fei Yun raise the bid for another million, they understood immediately and exchanged discussion in whispers.

Back in the suite, Elder Fang’s expression was awful when she saw Liu Fei Yun bid deliberately.

Xiao Yu, at the side, raged as she glared at Liu Fei Yun, who was sneering.

“Forget it. Let him have it. It’s just a lousy Level 2 Spiritual Leaves!” said Wang Xian to Elder Fang. He drew a faint, cold smile when Liu Fei Yun was competing with him.

Elder Fang was slightly stunned with a mixed expression. “Level 2 Spiritual Leaves are not lousy!”

“Uh, heh!” Wang Xian chuckled out in embarrassment as though he spoke too haughtily. He quickly smiled and repeated, “Not lousy, not lousy.”

“Any more bids?”

The elderly man’s voice was heard from the auction table again. He was surprised as he looked towards the second story.

Logically speaking, Suite 13 should continue to bid if they were determined to get this item. Why are they keeping quiet?

Liu Fei Yun at Table 8 was also taken aback. Coldness slowly faded out from his face.

One second, two seconds...Ten seconds!

“Congratulations to Young Master Liu for winning the Level 2 Renling Leaves once again!”

The congratulatory voice of the elderly was heard again.

“Gosh, they people of character. Young Master Liu was obviously provoking them. They actually surrendered!”

“This is not about a man of character, but rather, that there is no need to fight anymore. For a Level 2 Renling Leaves, $30 million is already too much.”

“This... Young Master Liu is unwise. He raised the bid because the other party wanted the item out of spite. In the end, the other party withdrew while he stumbled on it.”

The surrounding people exchanged their conversations in whispers as they looked at Liu Fei Yun and shook their heads.

“What a fool, Little Sword Celestial! If it wasn’t for his gifted talent in cultivation, he’d be totally useless!”

“Hehe, people from Suite 13 know their limits. On the contrary, Liu Fei Yun was too hot-headed. It’s hard for him to succeed.”

In the hall, people from the Ancient Fist Sect and Lingyue Sect looked at Liu Fei Yun as they commented impassively.

“Young Master, we still have to bid for the last few items. We should not overspend.”

A middle-aged man frowned slightly as he reminded Liu Fei Yun.

“I know!”

Liu Fei Yun darkened his expression as he stared at Suite 13 with resentment.

Lan Qingyue, on the side, shook her head when she witnessed this.

“Next, we’re auctioning the Emerald Gemstone, weighing two kilograms at a starting bid of $200 million!”

A jade-green colored Emerald Gemstone was taken out, and it was beaming with dazzling glow under the lights.

Emerald Gemstone was considered to be the top-class jewelry. A carat would cost tens of thousands. A two-kilogram Emerald Gemstone was worth over millions of dollars.

The Emerald Gemstone could be used to make a dozen sets of jewelry.

The price of $200 million had silenced everyone in the hall. The affluent people stopped at the sight of it while the Martial Artists would not buy ravishing but impractical jewelry.

“$210 million!”

Just then, an aloof voice was heard. Lan Qingyue raised the price and spoke emotionlessly.

“$220 million. Haha. The Zhou are determined to get this Emerald Gemstone and all the jewelry today!”

An arrogant voice cut the air as a middle-aged lady stood up with multiple posh accessories hanging around her. She spoke impassively to Lan Qingyue.

“$230 million!” Lan Qingyue said as she looked at the lady with an unchanged expression.
